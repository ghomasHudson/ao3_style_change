The man is largely considered a national treasure, even if he’s widely held to be a little ’eccentric’. Most people have no fucking idea how connected to the world he still is, and that’s the way we keep it. He’s just a very wealthy old soldier from the upper class, he’s ninety-eight years old, and that’s all we treat him as until we’re alone with him, right?”
Daddy tried to take me hunting a few times. Mostly for birds and small game. It was less about eating and more about hanging out with power players and bigwigs while you blow away anything with fur or feathers. I hated it. I always missed on purpose, because I never really wanted to be responsible for killing anything. Plus, they lugged the carcasses around like trophies, crowing about what a fine day it was, and all I remember was looking at the bloody corpse of something that had been flying or scurrying around that morning, and thinking that their eyes looked empty. That was my introduction to the concept of death. One day, something is alive, and then it isn’t, and nothing can change that. Maybe I don’t cope so well with existential angst, so I devoted my energy to pastimes that aren’t potentially fatal to anyone but me.
Those words had sealed Nott's fate, and his blackened bones had been all that was recoverable from the wreckage of the Nott Estate. Harry had been suspended quietly, and the incident had been hushed up and buried. His friends in the Ministry had evaporated after making a final favor of clearing his record and protecting his name, and at nineteen years of age, Harry was alone in Grimmauld Place, walking down empty halls that had once echoed with Draco's voice.
One by one they will arrive. Ron, of course, is early and first, and he pulls a beer from the fridge and heads for the library, giving me a friendly wave and a thumbs up while he compliments my suit. Nice guy…as straight men go…that Ron. Maria has set up a small table and chairs for the occasion, and I’ve glued myself to the entrance, ready to meet and greet people as they come in. I get a little edgy when I’m alone, so Maria is here to take coats and hang them, and the pressure is off when Harry steps into the entryway looking casual but cool.
“It isn’t really unfit…just sensitive, you know. I have this client, and it’s a big job, with a top end payoff if I get the info he wants on this guy. Big money…the kind that really sets things right for a guy. I don’t wanna miss out on this, but it’s been tough going. The kicker is that I’m competing with damn near every P.I. in town, and the rumor is that nobody…and I mean nobody…has found anything worth the big prize yet. That’s unusual enough for starters, but here’s the real twist.
Cissy acted as if she was mollified by that, but she was an insistent little creature of cat-like curiosity, and when she wanted to know something, she wasn’t easily put off.
Am I crazy? The last time I let my desire to be looked after and cared for by a good looking guy make my choices for me, I wound up in prison getting raped for seven years! Am I making the bad choice again…or is this the change I’ve been waiting for my entire life? Harry Black sighs loudly, yanking my train of thought right off its tracks and back to him.
Something subtle had shifted in Harry. A few months ago, the mere topic of sex would have elicited reddened cheeks and the need to look away. Now Harry felt a fierce pride in his sexuality. He was beautiful, and young, and strong, and he had a lover who was in every way his equal, and he knew he had every right to enjoy the pleasures that only lovers could give one another.
Others come to her aid, dragging me off of her and pulling me across the room before I can do real harm, and no doubt I would, so great is my hatred and so all consuming is my rage. Between my incoherent howls and inarticulate curses, I hear her threats of revenge. Everything is burned down in the conflagration between us, every secret opened, every barrier smashed. Everyone will know of the cruel seduction I have undertaken purposefully. However it ends…I am already destroyed.
“Well…he kind of chewed my ass too. About taking care of you. Not like a pet…like a partner. He gave me hell about letting you ignore his recommendations and not thinking about what that might mean. He’s never given me that much grief about anything before. That’s when I realized that he must be worried about you…at least a little.”
There had been shrieks of complaint from Pansy's long widowed mother, and there had been an inevitable court appearance before Ministry arbiters, who ultimately found in Draco's favor. This came about primarily because the Widow Parkinson went mad in the arbitration chamber, firing several Dark curses and at least one Unforgivable before she was Stunned and carried off by the staff. No one could say with any certainty why she had gone insane at that moment, but Harry, who had been there and had shielded Draco from her attack, understood the subtle reason for her antagonism. Draco had listened calmly to her initial snide comments, then stamped his foot twice and whickered. In the chaos that followed, no one cared to ask what that might have meant, but the widow Parkinson had certainly known…and that was that…Draco was a father again.
“What can I say, Dee? There’s something sexy about Filipinos. Just enough Spanish blood to stay horny all the time, just enough Asian to stay small and cute for a good long while. It took a lot to keep my mind off you for this long, but I never forgot, even when I couldn’t say it to you. Don’t lose that number, and be good to yourself…you deserve it.”
“Then it’s as good as done. Doc Snape is incredible. Trust me when I say he does good work. He did all mine. I can’t have any permanent marks, tattoos or disfigurements in my line of work. They increase the odds of being ID’d too much. I took a bullet in Afghanistan, and another a year ago. He cleared the scars for both, and he was the one who got rid of the scar I had on my head when I first started working for the Phoenix Corp. It was from the crash my parents died in. Used to look jagged…like a lightning bolt on my forehead. From a chunk of glass. Gone now, and he can do the same for you.”
“HA! The pompous little beast…is still recovering back at the Room. I didn’t let HIM sleep at all last night!” Harry strolled up the stairs with a mile wide grin on his face, enjoying Hermione’s gob smacked silence all the way.
Northern Ireland had been a hard place in the Sixties, and he was a product of his times…and then the times had left him behind, a remnant of war that no longer needed warriors. How fortunate that his skills still had a market. Killing had been a way of life, and while he was older than some in his trade, he wasn’t the oldest, and this was his way of life still.
Oscar Wilde may be long dead, but his one-liners will last through the ages. I think he would have liked that. That blasé and yet sparkling commentary has been emulated by generations of queens with attitude, and what a legacy to have left behind. I probably won’t leave anything so significant after me, but I can live with that. Especially like this.
Tonks made a great section chief, and her fondness for Harry took the edge off of the slow grind of days. She forgave his occasional lapses at the office, since he really was a better than average Auror. He’d been sensational as a combat mage, but as pencil pushers went, he held his own fairly well, but wasn’t quite distinguished. This had a lot to do with why he hadn’t been promoted. He’d even refused one, fearing the increase in paperwork and the death of field work. Harry shook his head and rubbed his eyes.
The master suite or the study are the most likely places for a computer. I tried to hack him and make this easy, but as you already know, he stays disconnected from the net when he doesn’t need to be, and his router and security equipment are top flight. I can break in very easily if you make sure he’s connected for at least five minutes or just load the contents of the disc I’ve prepared. This way we have two opportunities. One is simple and is based on you getting permission or just making sure he’s online while I’m ready and waiting for him, and the other just uploads what we want onto his computer.
He stood in the alley, thumbing the switch in his pocket. If he tripped it here, the blast would cover him in rubble from the wall. He only remained near out of a desire to know what became of his enemies. Not that it was personal, but he preferred the jobs where he could be closer to the target. He could work this way when asked to, eliminating targets in a haze of smoke and falling rubble, but it wasn’t nearly as interesting as seeing their eyes when they died. He’d never liked bombs, but the irony was that he was a skillful hand with them…and in a way, a bomb had brought him to this lifestyle.
Perhaps…if it could be shared…just for a short time. Or better…if something real took its place, but that hadn’t happened yet, and didn’t show any signs of manifesting anytime soon. No…it was too much to risk. It was his by right, and only he could have opened it. Didn’t that mean that fate had intended it for him? There was no closeness for him here…just like everywhere else. He would keep his one comfort to himself. He knew for a fact that it was better than nothing.
Minerva stood up and smiled ruefully at her former pupil. Uncharacteristically, her hand stretched forward and mussed Harry’s hair while he waited in silence for her answer.
That settled it. They needed a strategy session, and the sooner the better. Congressman Malfoy would have to be observed much closer than ever before, and some kind of intervention or red herring would have to be set up to draw attention off of the names Harry Black and Harry Potter. For now, Harry would have to switch to yet another false ID that had been prepared long in advance. It was a waiting game now. How long before someone on one of two sides finally made a critical mistake? If Hermione had her way, Riddle would be in hell long before a slip-up occurred on her watch. It was time to call in the others.
Harry remained in the office behind his classroom after his classes were done, and when he had the majority of his paperwork ready, he sent an elf to fetch Malfoy. Just using the name still rankled, but Harry had had all day to work out his approach and determine how he would deal with the insouciant boy. Politeness had failed utterly, but the threat of force and a tone of authority had worked quite well, and so Harry decided on a detached sort of vague disapproval, hoping that if he kept the brat wondering what was ’too far’, it might diminish the amount of saucy commentary he had to endure. He’d resigned himself to attempting this, but he by no means intended to be a complete pushover while he did so.
"It starts like this...I stumbled onto Potter in the most unlikely of places, which is probably part of why he was there. You already know a bit about my habits...I see the papers stacked up here and there. I seem to be a favorite when it comes to salacious gossip. Not all of it's true, but enough that you get the idea. I'm not the least ashamed of liking what I like. Sex isn't fun unless there are bruises...pain is reality, suffering is part of life. Some people in this world hunger for that pain...it gives them a moment of clarity...lets them expiate their sins. And just like there are some people born to need that pain...there are people like me who are made to give it. It's what I do...and I enjoy it.
His ankles were resting comfortably on Draco’s shoulders, and Draco’s free hand felt strangely sensual on his right hip. The other was clearly guiding Draco’s cock into place, and the first soft nudge against his entrance made his breath catch audibly.
“And your décor is killing me! It looks like someone spliced the Gryffindor commons into a refuse bin. Where’s the loo? I should be afraid to ask, given the state of the rest of the place, but I have to spell my face off and scrub the memory of you off of it.”
‘Dra…Draco. I love you.’ Harry felt immediate shame for saying it. That in itself made it worse, because words like those should never have been something to be ashamed of. Draco’s silence terrified him, and the notion that he’d spoiled their arrangement for good went careening through Harry’s mind.
‘Sounds good to me.’ Harry leaned back against the wall for support. ‘I can promise this. I don’t think I’ll be forgetting even a second of this.’ His own smirk was a match for Draco’s.
Maybe I’ve been isolated by luxury, and maybe I knew what Harry was up to, but the reality of it comes back again now, this time clearer than ever. He’s a one man army…and he’s starting a war.
The man on the floor gasped deeply, eyes slipping back into focus only for a second, fixing on the warm and yet frightened gray eyes just inches above him, then tilted his neck ever so slightly, just as Draco leaned that last measure closer, his mouth meeting Harry’s as gently as could be.
"I don't think you do. I'm talking about cirrhosis of the liver. I'm talking about a slow and ugly death. I'm not here to mince words with you, and I'm too old to be impressed or offended by much of anything. Tell me the truth…will you make a commitment to work with me on this, or will we continue this discussion with our Headmistress present?"
I make it easy for him. The first nudge…the instant he’s safely inside of me…I shove myself back, impaling myself on his cock as quickly as I can, starved for the feeling of him inside of me.
Fumbling about with his own fingers in the shower was a pathetic substitute for Draco’s gentle entries and skillful thrusts. Harry may have wanted Draco to try bottoming for him, but the only pleasures he had ever physically known had come from his time with Draco, and what pleasures they had been! There was no shame in missing that. However badly he wanted to explore the rest with Draco, at the moment, he just missed the way things had been, and the comforts he’d grown used to over the past months.
Harry’s count was interrupted by the shift of Malfoy’s head and a mouth that suddenly covered his own. Given that Malfoy was scarcely conscious, and that his eyes were closed, it was a fairly adept kiss, and Harry was paralyzed by stark and absolute horror and surprise while his upper and lower lips were gently teased and sucked.
Draco felt the stinging remainder of jealousy. It wasn’t gone. Not really. He could rationalize it and control it, but it was there. Harry was a genuinely nice guy, and good looking too. He was also funny, and honest, and downright decent. Listening to him wax eloquent about his fondness for the opposite sex was not something Draco really wanted to be subjected to at the moment…or ever.
The question is this: If you knew that Harry would be very happy, and not in any danger, and you knew that, after the fact, he’d be grateful for your helping me, and all you had to do was assist me in acquiring a few books and then keep silent for a few days…would you do it?” The ball was in Granger’s court. Draco fought the urge to hold his breath while she processed this information.
The tea was a common store-bought brand and Draco sniffed in vague displeasure at the swill. He really shouldn't have expected any better from a Muggle-born witch known for her love of solitude and privacy, but still, his nerves needed stiffening and this would barely do the trick. The kitchen was a shambles like the rest of the house, cups and saucers and plates and bowls scattered about on surfaces, with books and notes and papers shoved haphazardly among the debris. The chairs and table were the sort of cheap things usually found at sales when someone was moving out of their flat and hadn't any room to move their things...a hodgepodge of unmatched wooden and plastic seating that really added to the sense of chaos and disregard for appearances Draco recognized as symptomatic of a true hermit.
“Either is fine…it doesn’t matter! I…sir? How much…of this is…in confidence? Would anyone else know?”
“That’s because you’re a Slytherin and your mind works in ways much more convoluted than a normal human’s. I still suspect the hand of a Slytherin in the engineering of the London Orbital Motorway.”
“Thanks! I knew you guys would come around eventually. Really…I missed you so much it hurt!” Harry stepped back, releasing Hermione.
His first attempt at sitting up failed miserably. His second was more successful…or less…depending on how you graded tumbling to the floor in an ungainly sprawl and moaning piteously.
Are my nerves rattled? Yes. But more importantly, my hands are sliding across clean, strong lines of muscles, dipping below the water and finding that he’s rising like the tide inside of me, and whatever I may have felt before, I’m feeling that fluttering sense of need and desire once again.
Most people woefully misunderstand drag queens. They keep mixing us up with transvestites and transsexuals. The definitions are specific for the last two, but drag queens are a little harder to explain. Genuine transvestites actually receive a sexual thrill from dressing as a woman, even if they’re nominally straight and only date women. It’s a fetish behavior, rooted in the actual act of donning and wearing women’s clothes. The clothes or the waering of them actually turns them on…and I don’t meet the criteria for this definition.
Draco wrung his hands, looking a bit uncertain still. “I never met anyone who implied that the truth could be insulting, and still be the truth. I don’t…I don’t think I’m very good at pretending I’m less talented than I am. Frankly, I was better than some of my teachers, or at least I had more innate power. I feel that I was sometimes treated harshly or held back when certain teachers felt that I needed to be shown that they were superior to me…even if they weren’t. I should have had perfect marks across the board. I performed the spells better than any of my classmates, but when I was marked poorly, or rather poorly by my standards, I always spoke up. Consequently, I found myself at odds with my instructors. I understand that it looks poorly on my record, but I will not be told to be ashamed of myself for success when others fail.”
“That’s right. You know what that is. Guess you’re not as dumb as the whores who shit you out. Is there anybody else with a fuckin’ comment? It’s all fun and games ‘til they scrape you off the pavement. Now fuck the hell off. Outta here, the buncha ya! Ya fuckin’ apes.”
I can’t leave here without knowing. I can’t. If I go, I can’t come back, but if I stay…there’s no way to know what might happen. Killing time is essential to maintaining my sanity. Not that different from prison really, but given a choice, I’d choose this.
“You might say that. I have to run. Harry will be leaving too. We need a strategy session at the office immediately. It might take awhile. Possibly days. That’s about all I can say right now. It was nice talking to you…and just so you know…I like seeing Harry happy, and that means I like you. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you again. A couple weeks at the most.”
“I can…I can understand that. I think. That’s been my whole life. No one ever really sees me. They see my mother or my father. They haven’t been here for any of this, but I’ve still been in their shadow my entire life. I’ll never understand why I have to pay for it, though. It isn’t fair. I should have had parents! It should have been different!”
It was as pale and smooth as the rest of Draco’s body, and as soft as it looked, it conveyed the impression of firmness and taut muscle at the same time. Harry was almost oblivious to the fact that his body was responding to what he was looking at, and he was very nearly unaware of the erection tenting his pajamas. He just didn’t care.
I just don’t like the idea of you bein’ shacked up with some old guy you don’t even like. Let’s you and me get something going like the old days, right? Doesn’t have to be overnight or anything…just a start, okay?
Dinner is the stuff of legends. The Michelin ratings people didn’t give this place enough credit. Their wine cellar must be very respectable, since I remember just enough from when I was younger to know what some of these vintages are…and they don’t come cheap. This is the kind of place where the prices are all round numbers, because they don’t quibble over change. If you even made it through the door, you have enough money to make a meal here nothing but pocket change. The wait staff here are just incredible. They’re lucky and they know it. These people make the kind of money from tips that would put their kids through college. In exchange for that, they work damned hard to please guests.
I know what to do. I haven’t forgotten it all. It just doesn’t flow right. Too strained. Too tense. The notes are individually correct, but they all stumble out like nervous strangers. I’m still sleepy from staying up half the night. I can take a nap and try again another time…on the piano that Harry Black bought just because he knew I could play one.
It’s surreal. I’m looking at my life in black and white. So much information. Things I never imagined anyone would care to record. It’s all there, and they dug it up just to make sure it was safe for Harry to have me around. Where I was born, where I was schooled, and every small assessment, for good or ill, along the way. Letters from teachers. Pictures from the paper. The blue ribbons I won for English Dressage while riding one of father’s Arabians.
He prodded her ass with his foot. The worthless bitch didn’t even budge! He’d had other girls who got onto drugs, and while they did what they were told to get their fix, it was often as much of a pain in the ass as if they were sober. Had the silly little thing gotten her hands on some dope? He rolled her over and slapped her face just hard enough to wake anyone up, then peeled her eyes open. As he’d half expected, she was as high as a kite, but who the fuck could have gotten her drugs without his permission? Someone was fucking around with one of his girls, and Johnny Wu didn’t take that lightly. That’s when the loud click behind him registered in his brain.
I'm only writing this stupid thing because the staff at St. Mungo's ( you lot) insisted on it...and when Hermione heard me complaining about it she swore a blue streak about it being for my own good and me needing it. I love her, and I am glad that I've got my friend back, but God, she can be a pain sometimes. I'm mostly glad the curse is gone. I'm glad it's over. I want to get on with my life and actually just live it, but they all keep telling me that I have to sort these things out and make my peace with them or they'll eat at me and mess up the rest of my life. I don't want that...but I don't want this either. Draco landing on their side didn't help much. I really expected him to support my desire to tell them all to piss off and let us be, but he's not at all like I thought he'd be. I kind of like that.
“What…exactly, are you sorry for?” There was a hint of acid suspicion in her voice, but there was genuine curiosity there as well.
Greg took his iced tea and cleared his sore throat hurriedly. “I lived there. For weeks. With Vinnie, too. We went to the club, we followed him around everywhere. He never…and I swear to you…never…did anything like that. The cops said he had a warehouse locker full of equipment. We’ve known him since we were kids and we’d never heard of it. None of us even knew why they were there until the cops started askin’ real crazy questions. I mean…we all knew how it is with Blaise…what kinda club he runs…the kinda people he dates. But he never did anything that woulda hinted at that. They said he was makin’ movies and sellin ’em on the internet. He don’t even own a camera. Not even on his cellphone! I’m just sayin’…we woulda known. I’d swear to it, and if I’m wrong…if I’m wrong I don’t care what happens…but I ain’t wrong. Not about this.”
None of this was made any easier by Harry’s ’condition’. In all other respects Harry was feeling better, but his sleep had become fitful and restless, mostly because of the anxiety that came of knowing what his mornings would surely bring. He woke early each day, sometimes hours early, always with the dream memory of his own Draco calling to him. It wasn’t that he woke with horror, or even with fear of some kind. It was sadness.
Draco gave Harry a careworn look of gratitude. He didn’t particularly like the oblique reference to Harry’s knowledge that he wasn’t a killer. His father had killed Muggles by the score, often for sheer amusement, during the war, but Draco knew full well that he hadn’t the nerve for that kind of thing. Not that he didn’t like to see an enemy suffering…but killing someone, for any reason, simply wasn’t something he had ever wanted to do. It was just that, having a Mark on his arm, and a family reputation to live up to, it still stung a bit to be reminded that he wasn’t really a serious threat to anyone. Nonetheless, Harry’s testimony counted for a lot, and it felt good to be reminded that someone believed him completely and without reservation.
Snuggling in warm sun, so brazenly, so openly, is intoxicating in its own way. If he hadn’t put me right through the mattress this morning, not five hours ago, I’d probably give the signal for a prompt and sassy little ‘nooner’, but I wasn’t kidding about being a little sore. I pushed the limits a bit yesterday, and I’m paying a little of the price now. Don’t think I wouldn’t, or won’t, do it all over again in a heartbeat though. It was worth every slight twinge and ache a hundred times over.
And that led to here. A new cell. New cellmates. New bullshit. Blaise knew perfectly fucking well that he’d been framed, but the question was who…the cops, his own people, one of his many ex-boy toys, or even Dee, though it didn‘t seem fucking possible. It didn’t matter right now, but it would matter soon. What mattered now was that no one here cared if you were framed…and most of the time they only cared about what kind of connections you had.
“Shhh…shhh! Hey, hey, hey now. None of that. Not in front of the girls. Besides…I have no intention of doing any such thing. I think I’m a good judge of character, and if I didn’t want you here, believe me, we wouldn’t even be talking now. Breathe, okay? You’re going to be just fine. You can walk out of here anytime, and nothing will happen to you. I’ll give you my word on it. I know how little that counts for these days, but it means something to me. Maria will be here any second, then I think we should talk before the Doc gets here.”
Harry’s hands were working their way down Draco’s hips, and his mouth was slaking some savage thirst as it made a trail down Draco’s chest. It quickly dawned on Draco…what Harry intended.
Then there’s the exercise room, and Harry is a hard taskmaster. Snape may be one mean SOB, but Harry is half drill sergeant at heart. I run and work out until I can barely move in the morning, then I get my shower and breakfast. My butt has been healing fast, and the red and irritated area where I used to have a scar has faded a lot more in just a short while, but it still smarts when I sweat…and although I’ve often claimed that I would never do anything as common as perspire…when Harry puts me through the paces…I sweat like a nervous whore in church, and I can’t help it. I’m sure Doc Snape would approve…since this entire affair involves me being sore and miserable.
Harry handed off a cup of tea and took a seat across from Draco. “Now then, what was it you wanted to talk about…at length? I hope you enjoyed the book.”
Draco’s head rested against Harry’s back, and sharp puffs of breath felt cool and good against Harry’s heated and sweat slick skin. They remained motionless, joined together still, for almost a minute.
There is nothing to be gained from total deception…here the truth is my ally, my perfect sword because there is no shield against it. I shrug hopelessly, smiling like an idiot who knows that he has no chance of redemption and has accepted what is to be without reservation.
’This had better be an emergency. He couldn’t have picked a nice nearby location to have a problem? I hope he’s alright and all…and he is an exceptional wizard in his own right…he can’t be that badly off, can he? Hell…if he’s missed an entire day of classes, something isn’t right. Damn, I wish we could Apparate in here!
Harry is out fetching some iced tea from the kitchen, being the perfect man he is, and I can’t help but grin when I hear that.
He stood motionless, almost afraid to touch himself and the break the spell between them. Draco’s eyes flicked lazily across the details of Harry’s body, and Harry felt the scrutiny more intensely than ever before. Nudity wasn’t out of place in the communal living arrangements of Hogwarts, but this was another matter altogether.
There have been more kisses. Some of them chaste pecks, just sudden thanks for a kind word or a squeeze of his hand while we walk, others deep and with that now familiar hunger lurking beneath their surface. He is frightened of his own capacity for intimacy. I can feel it beating in his breast…the overwhelming lust to cast aside all boundaries, all expectations or barriers…and let the sensual rule him…through me. He wants it…that sweet surrender to someone who will know with certainty how to please him as an adult and an equal. Still I have not pushed him toward this. There’s no challenge to prodding him toward the inevitable. It must come from him, with only the gentlest of manipulation from myself. This is the art, the subtlety I possess.
Then the soft hand coated in slickness lifted and stroked Harry’s straining cock, and it was hard to worry about anything. A skillful hand coated his manhood from base to tip in slippery fluid, exciting Harry nearly to the point of orgasm, then pausing, with Harry’s erection still throbbing, now held almost upright in Draco’s firm hand.
“I’m sorry for the things I said and did that hurt you. If I could take them away, I would. I can’t. All I can do is tell you that it won’t happen again. I hope that’s enough.”
Harry looked relieved, and leaned forward to kiss him, soft and slow, then ran his hands through Draco's thoroughly mussed hair. "Here I thought I was the one who looked sexy with mussed hair. Outshone by Draco Malfoy again."
Draco Malfoy nodded silently and respectfully, which in and of itself was a surprise. His words came a few seconds later, just as Harry had been about to take up where he left off.
It would be a pity to wind up calling the sitter to look after his plants again, especially after that three week stint in London just a little while ago. He just hated leaving his plants alone so long, but what else could one do? Sometimes duty called…and Neville Longbottom always answered faithfully.
“God, yes! I know it might sound boring to some people, but languages were always like a puzzle to me, and I always loved puzzles. Keeps my mind busy, and I like that. I do need that brush up though…I’ve only read a couple of books in French since I met Harry, and while I did speak a little Spanish and Italian over the last seven years, it wasn’t anything really challenging. Just jailhouse chatter. This means I’ll always know what Harry’s up to, right? I don’t think I could worry more than I do now, knowing next to nothing…so that’s bound to help too. I won’t let you down…I promise!”
Naturally enough, considering what they do for a living, not one of them got drunk. Only me. I discreetly numbed myself up really well, because unlike the rest of them, I know what’s coming. Harry isn’t red-faced or strutting around all pissed, but I can feel it under the surface. A stiffness. A forced kind of calm. Inside, he’s angry, and it makes my stomach knot up to even think of it.
“Alright. I accept…that what you felt was real. You’re right. I didn’t know that bit. You never told us. We figured the curse rebounded because of your mum again. Boy Who Lived and all that. How’d you find all that out, anyway?”
Especially in the morning. No whiskey…no nightmares…less grief…and constant reminders of his Draco. It all added up to an uncomfortable and embarrassing fact, one which he’d felt obligated to share with John in session. His libido, long pummeled into submission by a desire to forget and to be left alone, had finally woken up. Most people, be they young or old, had some sense of the sensual that hung about them on a daily basis. Harry had buried his, making sure that he never diluted what he’d felt years ago, never letting anything take away from what had been so precious to him.
Flint doesn’t like boys. He likes women, or rather he hates women enough to assault them, but he prefers to have sex with them…especially against their will. In fact, he hates fags and holds me in contempt, but what else is there here? To make it a little easier for him to enjoy himself, he got cosmetics for me. Eyeliner and eyeshadow, lipstick and nail polish. When I got here, I had the standard prison haircut and a cheap uniform like everyone else. It’s been ’customized’ since then. My slacks were cut so short that they look like something Daisy Duke would wear, and my hair has been allowed to grow since I got here. It hasn’t been cut since that first day, and it’s well past my shoulders now, bound in a pony tail with a rubber band. Not a very long one, but enough that, given my natural features, I look like a white trash prom queen. Being more than a little femme helps too. No one here really looks forward to fucking a man. They make do when they’re too horny to care, but the illusion on my part makes them less violent about it. I make a fantasy come true for a few minutes, and I get to keep my pretty face intact. Flint mauled the last person who bruised my face. Not for love’s sake of course, but because someone hurt something of his without his permission. Yes…that’s horrible. I know.
“Hmmmph! Soooo cruel…but you know it’s why you of all of us here are the one I look to for company. What possible bribe could I offer you for this juiciest of morsels? Hmmm? Surely you have something up you sleeve, don’t you? Name the price and we’ll see…”
“I was afraid. It might sound stupid, but when I saw the news…I saw how much was going on. I don’t want to add another complication, another risk when there are too many already. I don’t want to even imagine losing you over my petty grudge. I can’t even believe you’d arrange this much for me.
Draco leaned into Harry's arms, reflecting mournfully on what fine arms they were, savoring the faint feel of stubble against his lips and chin. After all those years of mocking Harry for being so ridiculously hirsute that his beard was evident early in the afternoon, it seemed fitting that he enjoyed the feel of that face so near his own.
Draco nodded silently, listening intently as Minerva McGonagall intoned the classroom by name and floor, watching as she disappeared in a puff of green flame. A moment later, Draco clambered into the Floo and flung the powder to the floor, calling out the same precise destination.
Jamie took off, wand in hand, ready to immobilize and capture Lily’s run-amuck text, while Harry leaned back against a post of the stairs. It was a hell of a thing. He’d just talked about Draco with his own son. It wasn’t anything like he’d expected, and Jamie seemed a lot more sensible and worldly-wise than Harry remembered being at thirteen, but that was good right? Jamie was a very level headed kid, and no moodier than any other boy his age.
No…those who said they wouldn’t last would never know these things, but Draco and Harry did. Draco knew with diamond clarity that school would be finished, wars would be fought, and times would ebb and change throughout…but what they had would only grow, and deepen, and endure. Harry Potter would never again weep alone in a cupboard beneath a stair, and Draco Malfoy would forever have one person he trusted with his very heart and soul. They would struggle, labor, fear, and love as one…now…and always, and nothing spoken ill of them by the ignorant would ever change that simple truth.
“YES! Now, thanks to you, I have to change the codeword! And I liked that one! Right now my vote is for FUCKING WEASLEY, but you’d better hope I’m over this by tomorrow!”
Hermione had already begun to pull the door shut when Draco jammed his foot into the way and blurted out one last gamble for her invitation. "I apologize! If it will get you to hear this out...I'll apologize in detail for everything...all of it...the things I said, the things I did in school...the whole lot of it! I'm sorry I hurt you...can't change that...but if you'll listen to me for just an hour I'll apologize a hundred times, just let me in and hear me out!"
"Malfoy...you've never apologized for anything in your life. I doubt that you mean it...but still...what on earth would you consider important enough to make throwing around words like those worthwhile? "
He’s standing over them, silent as before, and he’s staring at me. I realize that I’m shaking from head to toe. My teeth are chattering even though it’s hot as an oven in here. I can’t help staring back. His fists are still balled up, and there’s blood on his hands. His face is like a thundercloud. He looks like God. He’s above us all, more powerful, more certain, more inflexible than any of us. Nothing can break him. Not this place or these people. He is here, but he will never be one of us. Nothing could pull him down from the clouds. Nothing. God has green eyes, and his gaze makes me feel like something low that crawled from the muck, on its belly like a slinking dog. I know how far I have fallen when I look in those eyes.
Draco stood at the door of Harry's suite, intoning the last passages of the diary. Within, Harry had heard someone speaking at his door. His skin prickled uncomfortably and he felt oddly cold, despite the fact that there was no reason to feel that way. Some impulse made him go to the door and listen to the strange monotonous speech outside, laying aside his annoyance at being disturbed. The voice sounded vaguely like young Draco's, but it was more like muttering than clear speech, and that wasn't anything like Draco.
I whisper it. Those words will be locked in my head as long as I live. I just didn’t think I’d live long enough to have a reason to say them out loud.
The notion of asking Snape for a special writ permitting him into the restricted section was feasible, but a bit nerve wracking. Severus Snape was bloody brilliant, and facing his scorn when he learned that Draco’s goal was ‘How to shag Harry Potter into a complete stupor in one easy lesson’ would be unbearable.
“I knew it! It’s true. Admit it! You have intense inner fantasies about shagging the stuffing out of me! You do and you know it! You’re just too polite to say it! Go on then…tell me I’m wrong. I dare you.”
It was probably going to be necessary to bring the subtle changes in them to John’s attention, and Harry couldn’t imagine anything more unpleasant than such scrutiny over his traitorous subconscious, but there you had it. Another day would bring conversations that were fraught with tension for all involved, and that was simply the way things were.
If it hadn’t been for the depth of Harry’s voice, the noises would have been similar to the ones made by girls he’d heard from a distance. Draco may have been a virgin, but he was neither deaf nor blind to what had been going on all around him since his fourth year at Hogwarts. In fact, he’d once stumbled upon Millicent Bullstrode in the more-than-friendly embrace of a seventh year Ravenclaw, and the pitch of her voice had been remarkably akin to Harry’s. Thank goodness he was in a situation that guaranteed his excitement, or that mental comparison might well have spoiled the mood!
With that, Draco slipped his hand around his newly stiffened length, and slowly began to pull, almost exclusively around the head of his cock, while giving small sighs of satisfaction, and periodically closing his eyes, only to open them again and stare directly into Harry’s wide and shocked green eyes.
Harry got the words out while trying to remember the power of speech. Draco possessed an enthusiasm for what he was doing that bordered on the mystical, and Harry was definitely benefiting from the extra effort. All those other things, the things that had dogged his heels since the start of it all…they meant nothing now. Draco felt right. Draco felt good.
NEWTS came and went, and Hogwarts celebrated in grand style. In the heady atmosphere of graduation, Draco and Harry were relegated to the background of other’s minds, which was a source of great relief to the both of them. Everyone else was suddenly concerned with their own dates, and this left them a certain freedom they hadn’t had in weeks.
“Oh, come on! Admit it…even if you don’t like guys, you must be flattered that they thought you were hot enough to try hitting on you.”
It started with the prison riots. A man named Harry Black, who, upon further investigation simply did not exist, had been incarcerated for only a few weeks before disappearing after the riots. A handful of dead criminals who were due for early release had been all that was left behind. They were able to ascertain that SOMEONE had been there, and that the prisoners believed his name to be Harry Black, but the trail ran cold after that. It had taken several bribes in the form of luxuries for an injured prisoner named Marcus Flint to spill even the few details they had.
“Wrong answer!” Harry punched Zabini in the nose as hard as he could, rather enjoying the satisfying crunch of cartilage that followed. Zabini howled while he swung backwards from the blow, and blood bubbled out of his nose, as well as from his mouth. Since he was hanging upside down, his howls were quickly drowned out by coughing and spitting as he tried to expel the blood that flowed into his mouth. Nott stopped struggling entirely and just hung there, wide eyed and amazed. No one had ever seen Potter act this cold blooded before.
Harry relented, withdrew his wickedly talented, yet woefully insufficient, fingers, and slicked himself with same substance that he’d worked so lovingly into Draco. The look of satisfaction on his face as he rubbed it on was gratifying, but Draco was certain that if Harry didn’t stop looking so pleased and get back to putting his cock into his boyfriend, he’d just kill the bastard out of pure frustration!
“Blaise Zabini was just a small time pusher for his family when I met him. We were both seventeen. I was crazy over him then, because he had money, looks and attitude, and I’d been in a pretty bad spot in my life until then. He had rivals inside his own organization, and they set him up because they didn’t like the idea of a punk kid who’d never done any time strutting around like a mafia Don. He had friends that were well connected, and they warned him about the sting. Rather than ditch the delivery and let it be known that he was aware of the plot against him, he sent me.
He’s staring at the sky, sunglasses still on, quiet and still. He has the kind of calm a Zen Master would fucking envy. I wonder what he’s thinking.
I’m moaning into his mouth while that tongue plunders me ruthlessly, because he just shifted the angle of the toy and he knows he’s brushing the place inside me that aches for him. I love feel of faint stubble across my neck. Not thick or unshaven…just the little reminder that he is very much a man…and he is very much mine. His free hand has woven its way into my hair, and his teeth are just so delicately scraping their way across my nipple. Indescribable. When all of these elements are combined with the heady knowledge that he is alive and safe and here, I can’t find words for what I feel, and then he shifts that toy again, moving it with a steady hand that isn’t afraid at all, and all I can do is whisper affirmations of desire, letting him know that every little thing he does is right.
I have a lot to think about…before they come here…and before the subject of Blaise comes up. Something different than I’d planned is called for…urgently. An intercom call gets a vodka and tonic delivered to me by Maria while I primp after my shower. I’m fortified and protected from the terrors of my imagination by a nice, comfy haze of alcohol. Not so much that I’m drunk…just enough that I relax. I need to modify my request…in a way that minimizes danger for Harry. There has to be a way.
“Congratulation, Drake. Welcome aboard. As for your actual employment terms, I was thinking of something along the lines of translation work in the offices, alongside the remarkable Miss Granger and Miss Patil. The program for translation of data is presently headed up by the utterly remarkable Ms. Chang, here in our private offices, but she's fully capable of walking you through your duties by long distance communication. They could certainly use your help, given the sheer volume of information through which they regularly sift. I think we can arrange for some refresher courses in French, Italian and Spanish for you, as well as some computer training that will avail you well in your new work. Does that sound like an amenable use of your natural talents?”
Harry’s voice breaks the silence. He gave me space and silence for awhile, but we’re almost to our headquarters now, and it’s going to be time for debriefing in just a few minutes. No more time for thinking quietly, or reflecting on the way my little drama has played out.
As if I’d ever deny the both of us this pleasure. Hah! Ridiculous. But I am an artful tease. Fingertips that barely caress but neatly steady the length in front of me. I let my lips just ghost across the warm skin along the side, flick my tongue against it with the whisper-soft gentleness of a snake. I love that he’s patient and understands that this is my pleasure as well as his. It isn’t to be completely rushed, even though we only have a little time between us.
Harry looked abashed. “I didn’t mean it like that. I just…I don’t want you to feel like you have to do something you don’t want to.”
Harry sat back on his bunk and whistled in amazement. This was better than he’d imagined. Harry grabbed his towel and cloak and made ready to leave. Ron threw in a final warning.
Harry picked up his cloak and walked for the door, while Draco retched noisily behind him. The sound of it stabbed into him and he paused one last time. Draco spoke before he could, this time softer and clearer than before.
It was surprising how liberating a moment like that could be. Harry spilled the worst of it, and things had slipped from his mouth that he hadn’t spoken of in almost two decades. Minerva took it all quite well. She was a good friend of many years, and she’d watched the quiet gentleman she knew so well grow from a nervous boy into a decent and capable man. It was a bit of a shock to her system, learning so suddenly that Harry was not only gay, but had remained celibate since the day Draco had left him, and that he’d carried the guilt of several murders with him since he’d quit the Auror service. For the most part, Harry reiterated his inability to cope with seeing the face of the new Lord Malfoy. The thought of seeing that face, lips curled in an arrogant smirk that echoed through decades, filled him with a terror and apprehension he couldn’t even begin to describe.
“That is acceptable…even if your flippant attitude is not. We can discuss that at a later time. If…you will accept Professor Potter’s unusually gracious offer?”
Harry blushed furiously and found himself hemming and hawing before he could speak. The way he’d felt that night was so different from his current circumstances. It was hard to splice two lives together, one being The Boy Who Lived comfortably with death and danger, the other being Harry Potter, who never knew what to say most of the time.
When he dreamed, it felt as if Draco was close by, nearer to him than could ever be possible. He could almost remember exactly what it felt like to reach out for him and find Draco there waiting for him. When he woke, it was to an empty bed, and an empty life, echoes of yesterday reverberating through his soul. He didn’t wake because his sleep was a hell of the mind. He feared to sleep because it made waking more horrible than slumber. In his sleep, he heard the words he’d wanted to hear then. Draco, proclaiming his love, swearing fidelity, forgiving Harry’s explosion of temper, and apologizing for the silence between them at the finish of it all. It was a sweet fantasy. Too sweet, if one had to wake and return to a world that would never have that Draco in it again.
“I see. That brings us to my final inquiry. You said that you became very anxious when you thought you wouldn’t receive tutoring in Defense Against The Dark Arts by me. That anxiety moved you to barge into my quarters barking questions and demanding answers. It was unseemly, but what I really want to know is why you felt such anxiety. Your marks are still good enough to train anywhere in the world. Why me? Why here? Why such anxiety over a possible refusal?”
“The cruel eld doth palsy. The price of long years I suppose. A man cannot expect to cheat Death of his due forever, and I’ve already made quite a good run of it. Needn’t worry. It hasn’t really diminished my enjoyment of life in any meaningful way…although…I do rather miss clapping. It seems wrong to never applaud something when the occasion seems right for it.”
Slight hints of salt and chalk assailed his taste buds, and the texture was so strange, nothing he’d ever imagined…and Draco’s hand actually held a scent that Harry had only ever experienced alone before. It was his own scent, now emanating from the hand of the person who had just touched him more intimately than anyone else ever had. His mind reeled, and Harry acquiesced, lapping away the heavy droplets he’d left behind on Malfoy’s perfectly manicured hands.
“He WHO? He’s going to kill you? What do you think I’M going to do?! Worry…about…me!” Sarcasm dripped from Harry’s voice like venom.
The silence is eerie. I don’t know how long it will take to get used to being alone or in the company of just a few people. I have privacy! The one thing prison steals from you is privacy, and any sense of it. You’re constantly surrounded, observed, monitored, and handled like a cheap package, which I may have been, but it’s still dehumanizing and just plain rude. Now I’m in open, spacious rooms with no one else, and I find myself willing to clean things with Maria or do dishes for Therese just to be near someone else. Will this ever go away? Thank God there’s satellite radio piped into every room. I can tune into pop channels in the bathroom and try to pretend that I’m a carefree, brain dead sixteen year old again.
Harry sent flowers from wherever he is…or had the people he works with send them. Two dozen roses, long stems intact. They’re beautiful, and the card with them was simple but sweet. ‘Even here, I am thinking of you. Love, Harry.’ I used to be suspicious of the worth of gestures like this, but it’s Harry, and I know he means it. I miss him terribly, but it helps a lot to know that, even with all the things he must have to worry about, he knows that I am here, missing him, and that a reminder that he’s well and thinking of me means so much right now. It reminds me that I am not an idiot for wanting him, even if I have to close my eyes to picture his handsome face.
The genie was out of the bottle just the same. I knew a way to feel better in a pinch. I tried getting dates the normal way, but here's the crazy thing: people are generally fairly decent. In my case that made it a nightmare. I'd try to meet someone for a shag, and even high or drunk, they'd try to be at least a little kind...and it repulsed me. It was awful. Fancying someone and not being able to do a thing about it because they sort of fancy you as well and even if they thought you were a bit of a tart for coming on to them so easy...they at least try to be polite and modest about having one off together. Next thing you know you're yelling at them to fuck off and get away...and they just go.
“There it is! Just like I left it. It’s my photo album. This and a few other things are all I keep here. I don’t really have a lot beside this.”
Remus paused a moment. He’d read about the prison riots in the paper…along with the endless articles and news coverage of the recent mob killings. He hadn’t heard the name Harry Black brought up once. It had to be one of those pieces of inside information that didn’t get shared with the press. That meant it was probably a very, very shaky lead at best, the kind that needed more work before it could even be mentioned on the news. Still…black hair…green eyes. It was something to think about.
Harry had finally drifted back to sleep after a light supper, which he‘d only taken in because Prewett had been adamant about his eating something. The food at Hogwarts was always good, but it still sat like a lump of lead in his stomach. The Dreamless Sleep had worn off hours ago, and his next dose hadn‘t yet been delivered. Hovering on the brink of slumber, memories came easily, suppressed by Dreamless Sleep the day before.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah…and stop calling him that! It’s Malfoy, or Draco, but nothing else. I mean it, Ron. He’s hasn’t given you a minute’s grief since the year started, so just let it go already…please?”
“As long as that’s what you really want. I’ve just gotten used to Harry the Professor...now I’ll have to get used to Harry the Writer. I did want to ask a few questions about Draco though…call it ‘teacherly’ concern, but he’s been a little off his par just lately, and I wondered if you’d sensed anything out of sorts.”
“Very much so. I can’t say this will be easy, but I can say with a certain confidence that I think the Ministry is worried without good cause. He doesn’t really seem any more rash or hasty than other people his age, and the insolence and arrogance we were concerned over seem to be the result of intellectual isolation. I imagine it would be hard to fit in with other children with a mind like his. Shades of Hermione back in the day. I’m a little concerned with his poor control of his temperament and his sharp tongue, which I expect we’ll see again before the year is done, but other than that, I think he’ll be a remarkable student and a credit to whatever endeavor he chooses to undertake as an adult.”
Harry smirked mildly. He’d grown used to Draco’s rather back-handed compliments, and to be completely truthful, he had rather missed them the last few weeks.
“This…this war…this vendetta…this Sicilian thing…must end! Here! Now! No more of it from either of you! Cousin…you have no business here. Go to your section and stay there! If I see you here again, I swear I’ll have your section head drop you off in the middle of Kazakhstan…naked…without a wand! Harry! You are an AUROR! Act like one! Brawling in the halls is a complete disgrace! I don’t care who started what…I’m ending it! Kill each other on your own time, but it stays out of the office from here on in! Am I understood?”
Serves me right. Drunk and stupid and mouthy. My legs aren’t working right. I just dropped like a puppet with the strings cut. It’s hard to breathe and I can feel my gorge rising. All I can see clearly are the clean tiles of the kitchen floor. Panic and booze and nerves and bile is coming up. Jesus, I hate puking. Of course, I always cry when I vomit, mostly because I never vomit unless I’m violently ill and miserable, or very drunk. Not the best conditions for restrained emotions.
Oh my God! I’m going to be James Bond! Or Jane Bond…I don’t know what I’ll wear yet, but I’m probably going to try something just devastating…as Dee, to keep Blaise’s attention on my ass and not my actions.
A time he’d be missing until Harry got back on his feet good and proper. The knock at the door pulled Ron out of his musings and he called out while continuing his search in vain, not bothering to look up from the mess of papers on the desk.
It comes down to this. We leave here in a few weeks. I’m not really well yet, not in the ways that really count, but I don’t…I don’t want to leave here, and not see you again. I could do better, if you let me, but there are a lot of things I can’t handle. I know what you deserve, and the truth is that I can’t give all of it to you. I just can’t. Even when I wasn’t sure how I felt, I never wanted to hurt you, and it still happened. I won’t make a promise I can’t keep, but…I’m trying as hard as I can…and if I could meet you halfway, I’d ask you to start all over with me, and not like before. Not secret, not sex, just, you know, seeing each other like normal people do. Even if all I can do is promise to try, would you come to see me, or let me see you, after we leave here?”
“Wait. I get the distinct impression that you’re glossing over something here. Did Harry say anything to you? Did he answer your questions about your parents?”
The wild frenzy that overtook him faded, and he flopped, boneless as an eel, back onto the bed, whimpering, as his drained cock fell from Harry’s mouth and back onto his own stomach. Harry pulled close, bringing himself deeper into Draco, who was too overcome to care, and kissed Draco deeply, letting the mingling flavors of their own mouths and Draco’s freshly claimed come drift across both their palates. It would have been a more shockingly intimate act, but Draco was too far gone for semantics, and frankly, at this point, he wanted nothing more than to feel Harry thrusting into him deeply again.
“Oh nothing much. The usual. Sweet Fucking Merlin, Harry…my eleven year old asked me if I was a bottom! We’re nothing alike! She’s blunt and direct and absolutely confounding to me at times. The degree to which I am woefully unprepared to cope with this isn’t covered by any chart you can imagine!”
“So that’s how it is. Either you go with me, tomorrow, to England…or we run right now and never turn back, but if we run, we’ll be hiding forever, and they’re damned good at searching. You fucked up, and you were warned about fucking with the program. All you need to know is that I love you, but this one is your call. If we head for England, it could be the best thing that ever happened, or the worst, and the same goes for running. I wish you hadn’t put me in a situation where I have to ask this, but what’s it gonna be?”
Harry cried out loudly when Draco gently nipped at the flesh just below Harry’s balls, and Draco suddenly realized that there was no need for silence on Harry’s part. At last they were in a place where they could not be overheard or interrupted. No pleasure would be denied them here. How fitting.
He’d said things like that before, always afterwards, while he was still willing to embrace Harry and keep him close, and though such things had slipped from his glib tongue many times, Harry thought he could hear something different, and more genuine, in Draco’s voice now.
“Irrelevant. Irrelevant. Irrelevant! If I must be droll, it’s called magic…I’m sure you of all people must have heard of such things. When I want to know something, I find it out, one way or another. Now about my question. Why don’t you want to teach me? Or if you will teach me, stop wavering and just say so, and this conversation will be done.”
There was nothing…no response at all. He’d expected something different. A man in distress demanding aloneness. Outrage at this intrusion. Not this. Draco took a few steps more, each painfully slow, and took in the spectacle before him.
Harry stopped his musing and quietly peeled away his clothes. If Draco was that tired, Harry would just strip to his underclothes and slip some covers over them. Missing the sex was one thing, but no night that included Draco in his arms could ever be called a failure.
I am very much his equal. His opposite number. His doppelganger. For all the vigor he possesses, all the power to plunder and conquer and satiate, I can match him with a need to be sundered, taken and pleased. I can provoke him, prod him past his limits, bring forth from him a capacity to give that he didn’t even know he had. Whatever he gives, I can take, and I demand more than he imagined.
That was what he saw in their eyes. They weren’t even restricted to nights. No one admitted to witnessing anything. They just didn’t care enough to be bothered. In the morning, if he couldn’t get up, the guards would haul him off to the infirmary again, and the process would start all over.
Seeing Draco naked the night before had changed the dynamic between them irrevocably. Draco hadn’t flinched in the slightest when he’d seen the erection tenting Harry’s pajamas. In fact, he’d looked amused, comfortable, and speculative.
Maria knocks politely and brings the juice, and Harry sets it on the nightstand and thanks her with a smile. She pulls a worried face for me, and asks if I’m alright. I don’t know if I can speak properly yet, so I just nod and gulp the orange juice. As soon as the door closes, Harry seats himself on the edge of the bed and sighs.
It took every iota of will he had to do it, but he was the soul of discipline in the face of pain. He had known that this was a risk. Precise location was almost impossible to achieve when bending space and time around him. The best he could have hoped for was this...to be near enough and close enough in time to make a critical difference. Everything hung in the balance. A misstep and all would be wasted!
“You shit! You absolute shit! You’re holding out on me and you know it! Spill! What’s your secret?!”
Draco suddenly looked sad and serious, his smirk fading to a worried and tired expression that seemed out of place on a face that was still that of a young man.
Harry nodded, then made for the pot of coffee in the kitchen. “I’ll assume you’ll pass on the coffee, but I could use some. Grab a seat in the kitchen. You can stand watch and make sure I don’t maim myself or burn the place down while pour a cuppa, okay?”
“No, as a matter of fact, I’m not. Remember…I don’t get around that much. When I really feel enthusiastic about someone, it isn’t that unusual for me to stay excited for quite awhile before I finally tire out. Ginny and I were the same way for the first two years. We were like bunnies on Ecstasy.”
Feeling my body stretch to accommodate the thing moving into it, crushing my eyes shut and savoring the way my own prick pulses just a bit more desperately with every perfect inch. God, if only it were Harry! There’s the spot! That’s it! Fuck! If I could just feel HIM there instead of this! God…PLEASE! Get Harry home SOON! NOW! HURRY! His name is on my lips, breathy and needy, while I plunder myself, imaging him with every stroke.
There was something magnificent in that determination, something awe inspiring and intimidating. Something desirable beyond sex, beyond physical satisfaction...something he wanted to be near and experience fully. He didn't want to beat or break that beautiful strength anymore...he wanted to cradle it to his breast and guard it with his life if need be.
Normally I’d make a smart remark to break the tension, but I can’t even imagine what he’d say if I said, ‘What? No candles or wine first?’ I’ve been known to make the occasional bad call in my life…but even I wouldn’t do anything as stupid as baiting this guy. It would be like rubbing myself in bacon grease and slapping a starving, rabid bear with my belt!
But today, none of that matters. Today is different. Today is special. This is Harry’s twenty-fifth birthday. He made mine the best birthday of my life so far, so how could I do any less for him? This won’t be a day of sit ups and push ups, of burning abs and tired legs. It won’t be spent firing rounds into targets, or memorizing my fake credentials and history for a name that never really existed. It won’t be spent in front of a computer screen until my eyeballs burn and my head aches from trying to turn French or Spanish or Italian into English on the fly. This day will be different from all the others, because most days, and it might sound shallow to say this, are about me…me…me! I like them that way, and Harry knows this about me, and loves me that way, so it’s all okay. But not today. Today is about Harry.
He’s mumbling, and no one could hear us, but when he lurches to his feet, my beautiful plans die a terrible death over one detail I hadn’t even thought of before. The nearly empty glass of scotch and ice tumbles from his hand…
“No need for apologies, Drake. I wouldn’t have kept you up so late, had it not been for the pressing need to address all this. If you’d like, I’m sure Harry is eagerly awaiting your company, and this old man has monopolized your attention quite long enough. Do have a good evening. I’ll see you and Harry again before you depart.”
Our final toast of the evening rounds out a bottle of Bordeaux. Lafite…1865. Ironically, that was the year my ancestor first fled the ruins of the Old South and made his way to Chicago. Harry couldn’t know that, but the coincidence is wonderful. A toast to new beginnings, with a wine that dates back to my family’s arrival in this town. Delicious. A memory I’ll carry for a lifetime, drifting across my palate in my dreams forever after. Thank you, Charlie Trotter’s. Only in a place like this could I have experienced culinary ecstasy while scheming for vengeance. Those five star ratings weren’t a lie.
“No! Stand up and turn around. Drop the shorts, bitch. Let’s see your ass. You need to know who‘s in fucking charge. I can show you that.”
Harry relaxed in the comfortable chair in the corner, taking the glass of water that John handed him while the older gentleman moved to take his own chair. It was always a pleasure to hear John’s stories, and the man possessed an aura of unflappable calm that soothed those around him.
Harry wasn’t sure how much time passed. It could have been minutes or hours. Eventually, Draco began to stir in his arms, coherent at last. Dazed, unsteady, and with a furious blush rapidly spreading across his face and body, Draco stumbled upright and lurched toward his clothes, forced to stop by the sudden need to vomit.
‘The books…he really has been at those bloody books! If I live through this, I’m thanking Granger, on my knees…in public!’
I tried. I tried so hard to be like him, to not get close, to not let you matter. I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t even hurt you like he would have. I wanted to please you, make you come back again, make you want me enough to never stop coming back. I wanted to keep it simple, but I couldn’t even get that right. I couldn’t push you away, so I stiffened up and talked down to you. It was all a fucking bluff. I couldn’t have stopped coming to see you, even if I’d tried. I guess, when it came right down to it, you were stronger than I ever was.
“I think observing the events of this duel qualifies as an education in itself. Mr. Malfoy? Will you acknowledge that the duel is ended?”
This is where beauty is a curse. It damns you to servitude or suffering, slavery or death. If you aren’t strong enough to take, you become the taken. This is where I fit in. There shouldn’t be any shame in being beautiful, but here, in this forsaken place, I wish I’d been born disfigured, or obscenely hairy, or morbidly obese. Anything but willow slender and smooth as a girl. Here, the way I look makes me a commodity. The only virtue in it is that, being exceptionally pretty, it was inevitable that whoever was strongest would claim me as their own, jealously guarding what they took to be their property.
“Imagine two titans of the ancient myths, in a sensual battle for the ages…two bodies and minds so skilled that their meeting could only be the kind of magic that makes wands passé. The secret involves a person of such notoriety, such interest to us all, so ideal for our meddling and amusements…that the only fitting price would be…our perfect union. Nothing less would ever do.”
The opened door revealed the rather impatient looking form of Draco, the new Lord Malfoy, foot tapping irritably on the stones of the hall floor.
“That’s…that’s generous of you, Harry. I…my therapist says…I have issues with control…and intimacy, and a few other things, but that isn’t here or there. I’m asking if you’d be willing to excuse my not being able to look at you while I talk. It’s easier for me that way. I can say things without losing control that way, but if I look at you, I’ll lose it and I won’t get things out that need saying. Would you be okay with that?”
The mirror. The Mirror Of Erised. This was where it had wound up. It wasn’t real. It wasn’t his Draco of years ago, just as it hadn’t been the parents he’d never been allowed to see. It was just a whispered promise reflected in glass. How it had wound up here Harry might never know, but the battered old thing had been tucked away with who only what other objects, and would have to be moved again. Harry winced while he avoided staring at the image in the mirror and knelt beside his charge. Draco was slack jawed and smiling, past the point of crying with joy, just smiling dreamily and staring into the mirror’s depths.
He’d done it...unconsciously perhaps…but he’d done it just the same as then. Preening…showing off his intellect…striving to attract the attention of someone he’d read so much of and could only dream of in years past. His father’s diary had described a paragon…a man who stood above the world of the small and the petty…and who had been wronged. Was it so wrong to have wanted to know someone like that? To have something to believe in again? He hadn’t expected to find a shy, reclusive and ultimately flawed man, broken by the very circumstances that had made it possible for Draco to meet him! It had been…hurtful…when Harry had kept him at arms length, deliberately distant for reasons that were perfectly understandable now. It had stung to be pushed away by someone he…
But not enough. He had known full well that Draco was very, very good, and was entirely prepared for the flurry of spells that came his way. He took the defensive, which wasn’t generally the best tactic to take, but Draco was owned almost entirely by his anger and would tire himself out much quicker than most.
Harry smirked ironically, a glimmer of irritation evident. “They’re serious. He was a disciplinary problem for most of his years at Durmstrang. Did you know they still use corporal punishment there? Apparently he argued with his instructors so often that, in spite of grades that are impressive to say the least, he was probably beaten with a switch or a whip at least once a month for the last five years. The Ministry feels that because of his talent and his lack of interest in socializing with others, he might be a genuine candidate for future trouble. I won’t argue that the boy can be troublesome, believe me, I’ve already seen that side of him! But I can’t accept that he’s potentially a Dark Lord. I’d just like to see him get the education he wants, and if his time at Hogwarts could help him open up to others a bit and learn to socialize normally, I…I’d want that for him. You know why.”
wandlessly, but he still closed off his mind just in case. He looked at the clock to his left and feigned a gasp. “Oh, look at the time. My mother and I have tea with my friend, Mrs. Hermione Granger-Weasley, very shortly,” he lied. “Are you acquainted with her?”
Tears threatened to spill down Harry’s cheeks, and Draco reached forward with his free hand to wipe them away. He smiled at Draco softly and then pressed their foreheads together. Draco closed his eyes and focused on the way that their bodies felt together, the way their magics felt together, earth reaching to fire, a flame that could burn forever if the world would let it.
She was very still for several moments. “I see.” She stood and sat down next to him on the chaise. Her hand clasped his gently. “Draco—”
On the thirty-first of July, Draco awoke before the sun, too excited to see Potter and too anxious to be surrounded by Potter’s friends to be able to sleep. When getting ready, he snapped at Fitzy who suddenly seemed incapable of tying a cravat properly, sending him on his way to allow Draco to finish it himself. He felt a pang of guilt five minutes later and called him back to apologise.
Draco stood before the floo and closed his eyes, taking several deep breaths. When he felt ready to continue with this foolhardy plan, he grabbed a fistful of floo powder, stated his destination, and walked through the emerald flames.
“Mrs. Figg lived nearby. She offered to let me stay with her when I was six while the Dursleys took a small trip. She said she needed help with keeping her house and could use an extra pair of hands. When I arrived, a bath had been drawn for me and there were clean clothes waiting for me. I asked if I was too dirty to work in her house. She smiled and told me that I would not be working after all.
They reached a clearing a few moments later. The sun had set, but there was still enough light to see the tomb before them. There were two rows of boulders nestled closely together, with five, chest-level stones in each line. Bridging the rows were thin slabs of rock perched upon each pair of boulders, and at the front stood one final stone with a pointed peak.
Slowly, the Lady backed away until Draco could no longer see her, taking all of the light and fairies with her until they were alone in the dark.
“Unfair? The Wizarding World has built monuments to a man who let its saviour needlessly suffer as a child and continuously put him in harm’s way as an adolescent.” Draco laughed incredulously. “This is the man our society lauds and mourns.”
“Miss Lovegood,” she interrupted, “I would like to have a conversation with my son. Perhaps it is time for you to go home.”
“My mother has been active in charity work since the war ended. We are trying to make amends for our family’s misdeeds.”
While Draco had attended university in France the last few years, Mrs. Malfoy had worked tirelessly to separate the Death Eater image from the family name. She was already well known in the charity circuits and well liked in a number of circles.
at the end of the interview as Mrs. Skeeter “has ways of hiding in places she does not belong,” and to say that he was friends with Mrs. Granger-Weasley if things went awry.
“Oh, my mother! I am late to meet her right now, actually. But yes, I am sure we will see you soon. I apologize for leaving so suddenly.”
He gave what some may have called a dramatic sigh. “Very well, Ms. Granger-Weasley. I suppose I can make the time.”
“No need to be,” Draco replied with a forced smile, trying to swallow down the sudden onset of grief and regret. “We housed the Dark Lord in our home. We deserved to lose it.” He wanted to believe it, but he missed his home so much. He wanted it to belong to his family again. Potter said nothing, and Draco knew that he agreed with his statement. All things considered, the Malfoys got off much easier than other Death Eater families. However, he did not want this day to end sourly, so he attempted to move the conversation forward. “I would be very grateful to see your library.”
She gave a weak smile and stood up to take her leave. He waited several minutes after Quelter escorted her out and cast
His father would have called him a blood traitor, but Draco locked that thought away. Lucius Malfoy had betrayed their family more than Draco ever could. So Draco penned a response to Professor Bernard, offering to help in any way that he could.
“Wrong move, Mr. Malfoy,” Weasley responded and stated his last command to the board. He leaned back in his chair with a smarmy grin. “Checkmate.”
“I do not believe in laying the wrongdoings of the mother upon her children,” Mrs. Tonks said. “I hope that I am never judged on the deeds of my parents, Draco, and therefore I will not do the same to you.” She held up a hand when she saw he was about to speak. “That is not to say that I think you are blameless. However, from what I have heard from Mr. Potter, I believe you have been trying to rectify that.” She nodded toward Mrs. Malfoy. “I do not know what the future will hold for your mother and me, but I am willing to reverse the disownment and to give my blessing for Teddy to become your heir.”
Her question wrenched a sob from his chest, ugly and loud, and suddenly, all he could think of was the look of anger on Harry’s face in the forest. He heard her whisper, “oh, dear,” and then she wrapped her arms around him and pulled him close, his head falling to her chest. She held him as he continued to cry, and her fingers, light and cool, brushed his temple and combed through his hair.
A cloud of soft light emerged from the stone beneath their palms. The forest began to awaken to the sound of a low hum — trees standing taller and flower buds peeking from the soil. Draco heard Miss Lovegood gasp behind him, and he looked up to see dozens of fairies rousing from slumber to come closer, their tiny bodies vibrating with delighted anticipation. Small bubbles of light popped into existence and began to drift around them in a lazy dance.
He heard the clink of her tea cup being sat upon the tray, and he felt her hand rest upon his arm. “What about the obligation to yourself? To your own happiness?”
“When it is not trying to murder me, yes.” He helped himself to a large portion of food, his stomach grumbling impolitely in anticipation.
Draco looked up and saw Nimue coming closer again, her brows knit together in confusion. She went to reach for him again, and he pushed her away weakly. “No,” he said, cradling his head in his hands. “No I cannot.” He took a shuddering breath. “I cannot go through with whatever—” he gestured widely, “ — ritual upon which we have stumbled.”
His mother raised her eyebrows. “Please try to make it through the evening without insulting someone.”
Mrs. Tonks studied him for a moment before speaking. “Good afternoon. I hope —” she squared her shoulders before continuing, “I hope that Teddy has not bothered you too much.”
“Well she has three other sisters, so you would have your pick. And as unfashionably desperate as their mother is, they
I told my friend, Rachael, many moons ago, about Draco and Harry “coming out” through dancing, and she drew
Suddenly, a voice called out, “Mr. Malfoy!” and Draco turned to see Mrs. Granger-Weasley walking toward him, dressed in ivory cotton dress robes, her skirts tangling behind her in the breeze.
“Good day. I have been flying with Mr. Potter. We were just finishing a quick meal,” Draco replied, though they had barely touched their food.
“Oh, um, no. Yes. No. I mean, It was a problem at first. I mean, I did not have a problem with— with,” he gestured toward his cock again, “arousal when we first courted.”
Mrs. Granger-Weasley spoke before Draco could reply. “I am convinced that there is some sort of vortex in the quidditch shop in which time has no meaning or reason. I have learned that the hard way after many, many years.”
Draco responded with a slight bow. “Mr. Potter, thank you for agreeing to meet with me. And to you too, Mrs. Granger-Weasley.”
Harry smiled. “Thank you. I had the kurta made for the occasion but the dupatta,” he stopped, nodding at the shawl draped over his shoulder, “was my father’s. I found it when we moved into the estate.”
This is my little slice of heaven. The wicked, hedonistic, naughty minx in me revels in this, and with the fire of alcohol in my belly and speakers that shake the building behind me, I can move my ass and roll my hips and let the adoring masses just wish they were me. The best part is…it isn’t a dream…and I don’t have to wake up! Dee is back in town, and this town is mine!
There was anger and frustration in his tone…and John heard it as plain as day. Draco was a minefield of prickly emotions he wasn't adept at handling…and this was happening somewhat faster than he'd imagined. He'd envisioned having to coax Draco to this point, but the mirror seemed to have pushed Draco to acknowledge his feelings far faster than any lengthy series of conversations ever could have.
“Seven…seven years.” I’m so fucking humiliated. It’s like my worst nightmare came true. He can see it on me. It’s written all over me. Prison bitch. Trash. Slut. Junkie. Whore.
Draco, true to form, insisted that he had been horribly wronged, and deserved compensation. In this case, compensation meant being the recipient of the first blow job either of them had ever participated in. Harry was actually sort of eager to try it out, but he didn't dare admit that when Malfoy clearly wanted him to do something. Giving in or appearing agreeable would only end in Draco being more smug than he already was...which strained credulity to say the least!
With every stroke into Harry, Draco used his own cock like a lever, bringing pressure down against Harry’s prostate and listening hungrily to the gasps Harry made as he clawed the sheets. It wasn’t long before Harry went over the top again. Being pounded through the mattress was simply more than his normally sensitive body could take.
Harry settled back into the pillows while John Prewett returned to his own chambers. So many things raced through his mind that it made his breath catch even without moving or speaking. What was real? What was dream? He’d almost forgotten…after twenty years, what it had felt like to be close to someone who cared for you…who was intimate with you and you alone. He’d been better off forgetting. Now he had the clear memory of what he’d lost…and it hurt bitterly.
They were two of a kind, from a special time and place, and they understood one another in ways that made them work oddly well together. They'd had experiences, in war and in peace, that had made them who they were today...and they each grasped how those events had changed them and molded them. It was sealed when they'd finally taken up a true relationship...complete with the kind of intimacy that only came from a relationship between equals. Harry might not have been gay, as some saw the word and its meaning, but he was honest with himself and able to thoroughly enjoy intimacy with another man. Draco...well...he might have been married and a father and divorced as well...but he knew himself well and knew that he would never have chosen another woman as his partner...his preferences were simply stronger in the male direction than Harry's, but that hadn't changed the dynamics of their relationship at all.
Today’s largest annoyance had been the total absence of any staff for the bar. Whoever had opened the place probably had some warrants out for his arrest on something minor, and he wasn’t showing his face anywhere. No one had heard shots, and no one living nearby had seen anything out of the ordinary. It was normal for people to keep quiet after something like this, since they didn’t want to get involved or draw the wrath of already angry mobsters, but the complete lack of information was still frustrating.
“Jesus, girl! You’re not doing bad if you can throw that around. Thanks, but just keep it out of sight, okay! Paranoia is your friend, remember?”
He takes the contract back and files it neatly, then holds out his good hand. A handshake and a smile, and I’m a member of the Phoenix Corporation. Hello, new life, meet Drake Malfoy. For the first time in my entire life, I have a real job, which is a lovely change of pace from a long career based almost solely on my willingness to put out in exchange for money or protection. It feels pretty good, too.
“I don’t believe you! Without even trying you’ve made us into the talk of the school! I don’t…grrr…I don’t want you to hate yourself…but…I just…I can’t go out with you. You say those things…but they call you a silver tongued devil everywhere you turn. How am I supposed to believe anything you say after the things you’ve done? You've toyed with or fucked around with everyone you've ever gotten within arm's reach of!!”
Just the voice set Ron’s nerves on edge. Actually, it was a little higher than the voice of the Draco Ron remembered so well. More of a clear, high tenor than the father’s had been. Even so, the sound of a Malfoy speaking never boded well. Never. Ron kept his irritation in a stranglehold and concentrated on the papers in front of him, answering distractedly.
“Yeah…about that. Let’s talk about that ‘measure of assistance.’ I want to hear from anyone who has actually had to teach a class with him in it. Just to be fair. You already know my opinion…but let’s at least look at what the rest of you have to say about this. Especially since I’m the one who’ll have to make use of him as a teacher’s aide.”
He finished off his eggs and toast, then gulped the last shot of coffee before heading for the shower in his bedroom suite. The teenage tramp he’d picked up last week was still out cold in the bed, snoring softly. No stamina. Nice ass though.
“The bullet grazed my shoulder. Didn’t even really enter. Just ran along the side of me. I swear to God! Snape looked at it and bitched me out for even waking him up! I’m not lying! I’m just fine, love. Take it easy and don’t let yourself get overworked about this. It’ll be ancient history in a few days…really!”
Toward the last month, Draco had ceased even that, and simply ignored Harry as best he could, and somehow that stung in a way that his silent scorn hadn’t. At least when Harry had been a source of emotion, he’d felt like he had some kind of impact on the blond boy, but now he was beneath notice, and it left him empty and cold inside.
I didn't start off in London. I actually headed for Manchester. It was fairly far off, and a big city that would have enough people in it for me to hide. I'd switched most of my Galleons to Euros and pounds just before dropping off the map. I just kept a hoodie over my scar or a cap on at all times. I stuck to the Muggle areas. I rented a cheap flat in the worst part of town for cash. There was nothing much to do but eat, drink and watch telly. It doesn't take much to imagine that getting boring. It wasn't a good neighborhood, but even with the way people treated each other there, people started to know me. The local grocer, the old lady who watered plants in her window every day, the postman who never had anything to deliver me but seemed nice anyway. It started adding up. People would ask my name, ask if I was well, say hello. I already hid indoors mostly, but it seemed like every trip out got a little harder.
Maria and Therese have been cleared, and their mail and other interactions are handled carefully. P.O. boxes. Yours would be too. Therese and Maria make trips for groceries and supplies twice a week. Mail leaves with them or comes back with them. They believe I’m eccentric and obsessed with privacy. They respect the rules, and have clean records of employment, or they wouldn’t be here. They’re paid very well, and they work well together, and this place runs like clockwork. We all follow the rules, no one has any problems.
He had his own little estate, smaller than this by a long shot, but he didn’t wave his money around. He…I guess he knew that I hadn’t been...treated well, so he took a lot of time just to be with me and pound it into my head that I was worth something. It’s amazing what knowing that you matter to someone can do to your outlook. I was a really quiet kid. Didn’t like a lot of sports or take any risks. I was so fucking self conscious of every thing I did. No confidence at all. Until him. I could always tell that I was the most important thing in his entire world. I wanted to be like him more than anything else.”
Draco was not sure what he should do and he was not sure what to expect when he followed Harry upstairs. Well he definitely did not expect Potter to make tea or to kiss him tenderly pressing him against the wall while holding him close. He did not expect himself to lean into the kiss and press himself closer to the man that had just tortured him moments – or seconds – or hours ago. After all that happened today, Draco did not expect any of this. Fresh tears streamed down his face while he just enjoyed this moment of peace. He couldn’t put together the events of what just happened how he walked upstairs and saw Harry make tea and how he decided to hug his tormentor and how that cruel man decided to kiss him so deeply and sweetly at the same time. Draco started to feel warm and cozy and he realized he could not feel those warm sweet lips pressed to his own or the body holding him close. Did he just imagine it, was he actually going insane? What he also couldn’t feel was pain. Just moments ago everything hurt his whole body had been burning in pain with every move, he hasn’t been able to properly breath as Potter surely managed to break more than just one of Draco’s rips. Grey eyes found an deep ocean of green that made his heart beat faster as he was consumed by the intense bright gaze. Potter was standing in front of him wand in his hand as he healed Draco’s broken rips. Slowly the bruises and welts started to disappear one by one as Potter moved the healing spells down the blonde ones body. Tender fingers brushed over burnt letters as Potter was able to heal some of the burnt skin making the letters faint slightly. “I will need a potion to properly heal this one fast…” the man before him said but Draco was not able to answer him or react in any way. He was too confused. Slowly the blonde wizard tried to back away but felt the cold wall immediately. He saw the concern and confusion in Potters eyes, saw the hand reaching for him for comfort but Draco could not take it any longer. This moment was too good to be true surely it was only a matter of time until he somehow pissed the dark haired wizard off again making him inflict more pain on Draco over and over again. It was best for him to just try and stay away from the broken man as much as he could. The still stinging letters on his hips had marked him and the touch reminded Draco of the contract and the situation he was in. There was no escape and there was no time for bonding or kindness. He is Harry Potters property and he would be treated as such. This man before him is not the boy he used to know in school. He might have been slightly dark and traumatized at that time but the war had changed him for good. The man before him was a broken mess that could explode at any moment. Draco managed to bow his head slightly before he ran off to Potters room where he laid down in front of the metal cage as it was still locked.
That is where Harry cracked. His eyes turned dark and with the swing of his wand Draco was lifted to the air unable to breath. “ You think this is a game Malfoy? You want to play Master and poor little boy with me like you did with him? He killed my parents, my friends, innocent people and you helped him! You think you had it hard because you spent a month in prison for what you did? You have no idea what pain means, what loss means you are just a coward selling yourself like you always did! Hiding behind excuses that you have no other choice. You are weak and I should watch you die right here in front of me. No one would miss you. Just another whore that died who cares? I would like to see that you know. I would like to see you fighting for your life and I would really like to see the look on your face when you finally realize there is nothing you can do to stop me. You think I paid you to fuck this poor excuse for a body? You are pathetic, you look like hell and smell like cheap perfume who would actually want you?” Tears swelled up in Dracos, the lack of oxygen was showing in his features already. He looked like he was passing out any moment when there was a knock on the door. The sound seem to distract Harry and he let go. Draco fell to the floor coughing hysterically and gasping for air. “Leave it in the corridor I will pick it up myself” Harry said loud enough to be heard outside. He shot Draco one hateful look before standing up to catch the food. Draco stayed on the floor to afraid of what to expect from the dark haired wizard he thought he knew. This wasn’t Harry Potter. Hero of a nation, always goody good boy Potter who saved the fucking day just by being Potter. No this wasn’t the boy he knew from school. Sectum Sempra, blood and pain all around him, hateful looks and nasty comments. This wasn’t Potter? Maybe it was. Draco was confused and he was scared. “What are you doing? Stand up you useless slut and take a seat. I have a proposition for you.” Draco did as instructed. “And what would that be, Potter? If you didn’t pay me for some sick revenge sex and not to just chitchat for old times sake what are you going to propose to me?” Harry smirked. “ I offer you a life. You are already selling yourself without getting enough to properly live your pathetic little life.” Draco just laughed. “Seriously Potter? You almost killed me just moments ago! You think I am fucking stupid?” Harry just lifted the cover over the food and casually took a bite of a chicken leg. “Actually I think you are a coward and desperate, not stupid but maybe that you are too. After all you did follow me in here and even after this little incident you did not try to run from me once so far.” Draco laughed coldly. “ Oh so that’s what happened to your little weasle girl huh, Potter? Did your girlfriend run away because you are…” Harry slapped him hard, without warning. “Don’t you dare talk about her. From now on you will call me sir or master. This was your idea after all wasn’t it Malfoy. This is what you wanted. You need a new lord to serve because you are a pathetic little coward. You will not disrespect me any longer. I give you this offer and only once. Get on your knees like the useless slut that you are and bow before your master and take my generous offer. I will give you back a life to live under my command and rules. If you refuse my offer you can go back to that pathetic excuse for a living and starve to death knowing that I will make it impossible for you to every get out of your misery. So what will it be Malfoy?” Draco hesitated for a moment stunned by Harrys words and the slap. It wasn’t the first time someone had slapped him, it wasn’t even the first time somonis tried to kill him. But it this was new no actually this reminded him of something – of someone -  it reminded him of the dark lord. What was Potter up to what was he supposed to do know. Did he even have a choice? Right know it did not seem to matter what he did – Potter would make his life a living hell either way. Or he would probably kill him either way. So Draco did what he always did, trying his best to safe his life. He got on his knees before Harry and bowed his head. “ Thank you for your kind offer, master. I will do whatever satisfies you.” His body was trembling slightly and Draco could barely stop the tears from freely running down his cheeks. Strong hands grabbed his chin and he was forced to look into cold unforgiving green eyes. “Of course you will.” Potter said coldly. “Now take a seat and start eating, the food is getting cold.”
The room was slightly dark. No lights where on and the sun was already very low giving not too much light through the one small window. The big king sized bed in the middle of the room was a mess. Bloody sheets surrounded a naked bruised body in the middle of the bed. It looked almost like a child – small and curled up. He heard slow breathing in an uncontrolled irregular pattern. Right Harry had broken Draco’s rib this morning and he forgot to fix it. Regret shot through him for a second when he looked at the broken body before him sleeping but not peacefully like this morning. Pain was painted on Malfoys face. Dried blood mixed with dried tears surrounded his lips. Come and blood leaking out of his ass. Shameless slut didn’t even clean up his mess. Rage shot through him. He deserved this. Harry turned around to leave but somehow he couldn’t. Slowly he walked over to the sleeping figure on the bed and studied him harder. He had to fix this otherwise there could be permanent damage. Harry did not care for Dracos feelings but he had to at least bring him into good shape otherwise he would be useless. With the swing of his wand he healed the broken rib and the teared flesh, the bitemarks and even the older bruises. Afterwards he used a cleaning spell. Draco was still asleep. Face still with a pained look. Potter was annoyed. He woke him up with a hard slap. “Clothes are in the drawers next to your cage. Get dressed and get downstairs. Lunch is waiting for you and I don’t want to ask twice so don’t make me wait any longer.” And with that he left and ordered Kreacher to make him new food immediately as his lunch was cold by now.
When Merlin takes out Arthur dripping with salvia he moans at the sight. Without warning he grabs the man’s little arm and pushes it inside his stretched peephole. He fucks himself with the kings arm for a while Arthurs cum easing the way for it but it still isn’t enough. Slightly frustrated Merlin grabs Arthur at his ankles and rests his kings head at his dickhead. He can feel Arthur struggle weakly too exhausted to properly fight the giant man that he considered his loyal friend. With a slow and gentle push Merlin inserts the kings head that is still slick with his salvia. He can feel the king tremble in fear as he pushes him in deep. A long moan escapes his lips as he fucks his dick with his kings body. One hand stroking his cock as he grips Arthur tight. Merlin can feel his own orgasm approach but he can also feel Arthurs fighting weaken. He starts to fear for his kings safety so he protects the man with magic. Arthur might feel like he is running out of air now but he wont die. It does not take long for Merlin to cum now that he knows Arthur will be safe. The force of his cum almost pushes the king out of Merlins dick as Arthur feels like he is drowning as he is flooded with thick semen all around him. This time Merlin does not take Arthur out but holds him firmly in place as he can feel the king squished tightly together by the force of his cum load at one side and his strong hand on the other side holding him forcefully in place. Arthur screams and coughs and struggles but it is of no use. Cum fills his mouth, his throat  and his lungs. His body feels like it’s going to get crushed inside Merlins dick. After a few minutes Merlin finally lets go of Arthur and slowly pulls him out watching the little coughing man gasping for air. H moans as he licks over Arthurs face telling him what a good little toy he is for Merlin. Arthur is to exhausted to answer, as he did not have the time Merlin did to calm down after the orgasm. Merlin looks at Arthur closely unsure what to do with him. He decides to use him as a human dildo taking his own anal virginity with Arthurs body who is properly lubed up with Merlins own cum. He fucks himself with his king for a while when he suddenly hears footsteps approach. Quickly he pushes Arthur all the way inside his ass using him like a plug and gets dressed quickly just in time for some knights of Camelot to come around the corner. He listens to them telling him all about the battle and how Arthur is missing and probably dead. Merlin has to hold back moans as the little king screams and fights inside of him rubbing all over the sorcerers prostate while banging on his inner walls to get out. The brown haired man agrees to help search for the king with the knights.
Feel free to ask questions. I tried my best to list all the tags I am willing to write about. I will be adding any missing tags and of course you can always ask about a special kinks that you have. I am not judging anyone I am pretty kinky myself but I will not write stories that I do not feel comfortable with myself.
The smell of burning flesh, the sizzling sound of the burning iron - it brought back childhood memories for Harry. It had all started with an iron rod from the fireplace. Vernon had experimented with it on Harry as a punishment when he was around 7 years old. The first time it had happened they had told the doctor that Harry had played with it and burned himself and when they found out how ‘fast’ it healed they had done it to him over and over and over again. As he had turned older the iron rod had yield to iron letters burned into his skin over and over and over again. FREAK.
When Merlin decides it is save to turn Arthur back he sits down hidden deep in the forest. He decides to turn himself into his young self so he won’t scare Arthur too much. He changes back from his old form and turns into the servant and friend Arthur trusts. He opens his hand and carefully places Arthur on a tree stump. When Merlin lets go of the small king he stares up at him in a mixture of disbelieve, fear and betrayal. Merlin wants to say something to calm Arthur but his hand feels awkwardly sticky. He opens and closes it trying to figure out what’s wrong when he sees the wet spot between Arthurs thighs. The little king has pissed himself. For whatever reason Merlin can’t take his eyes of the blonde little man before him. He slowly puts his hand closer to his face inhaling the scent of his king, a low moan escaping his lips before a tongue darts out of his mouth licking his hand clean. The smell and taste of Arthur turns him on so much he can already feel himself hardening. Arthur trembles even more as he watches Merlin in confusion and disgust. “Merlin…” he says with a shaking voice one tear rolling down his cheek as he looks up to his gigantic servant and closes friend. Merlin picks him up quickly. “shshsh don’t be scared Arthur. You are safe. I made sure of it.” Arthur struggles in Merlins hand hard trying to break free from the light grip. “what…what is going on Merlin?” the king almost screams. The sorcerer tilts his head to the side as he brings Arthur closer to his face inspecting him. “Arthur…” he moans as he takes in more of the kings scent. “ I am so sorry…that you had to find out this way…but I had to protect you!” Merlin looks down hungrily at the small man in his hand trembling and fighting in his palm. Another moan escapes his lips as he feels Arthur fight him, so weak and helpless. The sorcerer licks his lips. “Arthur… You wetted yourself…I am so sorry I scared you…let’s get you out of this before you catch a cold in those wet pants….” Merlins rips away the armor and clothes of his king as thoughts about his helpless king flood his mind. When he takes in the full sight of the little mans naked body he shivers in lust. Slowly he puts Arthur to his mouth carefully licking over his naked body, cleaning him. Arthur screams and fights with all he can but its hopeless as Merlin is so much bigger than him. Merlin moans and pushes Arthurs body almost fully inside his mouth sucking hungrily at him. “don’t worry Arthur…I will clean you up … you are safe with me…don’t struggle so much you might get hurt!” Merlin says around Arthurs body as he plays with the naked man in his mouth letting his tongue caress all of Arthur. The kings screams for help are muffled as Merlin closes his mouth around Arthur feeling him struggle inside.
“Harry are you ok?” Hermione was standing in the doorframe worried look on her face. Harry was trembling, tears where running down his cheeks. He smiled and pointed at a seat for her. “Yeah totally fine. Don’t worry I just got a little carried away by nothing really.” Hermione took a seat but the worried look didn’t really leave her face. “Harry you don’t look fine. This doesn’t look like nothing. What got you carried away?” Harry just shook his head. “I said it’s fine Hermione, leave it for once would you? I am not a child.” His wards sounded harder then he intended them to. He saw the hurt in her eyes when she flinched away. “I am sorry. I didn’t mean it like that. It’s just I sometimes get carried away by everything that has happened during the war. I can handle it really Hermione. I just need time to calm down afterwards. But I am good now.” Hermione looked at him not truly convinced but let it go for now. She had had a bad feeling about Harry for a while now. It was similar to the time when Harrys mind had wandered off during 5th year when Sirius died and Arthur almost got killed. It started then end it never really stopped until Voldemort was dead. And now it was almost the same. She told Harry once before that he had to keep control over his mind he couldn’t let Voldemort in. But how was she supposed to stop memories to take over. This could be something even worse maybe Harry needed help. But Hermione wasn’t sure yet what she should do about it. Then she saw the plate with food in front of her and frowned. “Harry what do you need two plates of food on it for? What is going on here?” Harry looked like he had been slapped, hard. “Harry I mean it. Tell me this instant. What is going on here?” Harry tried to come up with something, anything. “I mean you were coming over so it made sense to you know… and actually I really wanted to talk to you about the party and..” Hermione hit the table hard. “Don’t you dare lie to me Harry Potter! Do you think I am stupid. There are two plates of food here that clearly have been eaten off. There are two seats prepared at different corners of the table. Clearly there is something on your mind too. And don’t you give me that look, it is not working. You wanted me to come over here to talk and when I come just a little earlier I find this and don’t you tell me you had a friend or a date over or whatever crap you come up with. You wouldn’t seat anyone as far away from you as possible if that was the case! So don’t even try that bullshit with me.” Hermione’s face was bright red. Like it always had been back in school when she had tried to talk some sense into Harry or Ron or both of them. It was almost like it used to be during school.
Draco dreamed of nights of pure horror old and new. When he was 9 years old his father had taken him to a meeting with friends – all former death eaters. They had teased him for how ‘pretty’ he was. When his father had left to get something they had talked about how Draco would look more like a girl than a boy. Later that night they had put him into a dress of one of their daughters. They were all drunk. They made him dance. They made him cry. It was the first time he had felt the Cruciatus curse. Laughter had filled the air paired with his screams. The pain had been all consuming. Ha had not known what he did wrong he had not known who he was or where or when. All he had known was that he would do anything to make that pain stop and never feel it again. His father had not said a word during all of it. And when they left to get home all he hissed at Draco was “stop acting like a childish girl, men up.” Draco had cried himself to sleep that night and most of the following nights for weeks.
His anger had dissipated as quickly as it came and he took a calm, clearing breath. “Malfoy and Granger of one accord?” Draco asked, still turned away from Potter. “What has the world come to?”
He peeked an eye open and realized exactly where he was: lying on top of Miss Lovegood on the chaise, muddied and half dressed, with his mother standing before them.
Draco swept his tongue to part Potter’s mouth, eliciting a groan as his tongue met Draco’s. Potter wrapped his arms around him to pull him even closer, and heat pooled in his groin at the feeling of their bodies pressed together.
“And if you already have an heir, then there is nothing holding you back from being with the person you actually love.”
“Mr. Malfoy,” Potter said with a bow, “it is a pleasure to have you here. Thank you for agreeing to fly with me.”
The dinner was as successful as it possibly could be. Weasley looked uncomfortable for its entirety and narrowed his eyes at Draco more than once, but no one hexed anyone or brought up the Dark Lord.
“You had not yet been born, Mr. Malfoy.” Potter took a drink of his punch, standing in silence for a moment before speaking again. “I have spoken of you. To her. I mention her caring nature to you because it would not surprise me to know that she has the capacity to, one day, make room in her life for you if you so choose.”
“Is it difficult to live there?” Draco asked without thinking. It was more than likely too personal to ask if it was a hardship for Potter to live in the same house where his parents were murdered.
“Stop it,” Draco snapped, his hands falling to his sides, anger curling up his spine so quickly that he felt almost dizzy with it. “Just… Circe, for once can there not be a war hanging over us?”
He had already begun; he may as well spill his soul to a woman he barely knew. “Bad history precedes every Slytherin, so much so that many of us simply embrace it. But to visit the Tomb of Merlin, to feel the power that still radiates from its stones, and to know that he was the greatest wizard in history. To know that he, too, was a Slytherin, but did not choose darkness. To be ambitious and cunning but not,” he sneered, “
A minute passed and then the door opened to Kreacher standing before him. “Mr. Draco, it has been so long since Kreacher has seen you.”
“A smart idea,” Potter said. When Draco looked up, Potter’s cheeks were dusted with pink. He feared what his own face must look like.
, he was already dizzy from their kisses, from just their bodies pressed together. How would he make it through a whole evening?
“Draco?” Harry asked as their hands slipped from each other. As Draco moved farther away, his body accelerated its pace toward the ground, magic no longer holding him up as gravity finished the job. “Draco!” Harry cried out as Draco fell, his hand reaching out for him. He glided down quickly after him, reaching for him when his feet touched the earth.
Draco nodded and said, “Just, slowly,” and then Harry was pressing inside, his cock stretching him and filling him. He cried out, and Harry paused and kissed his face, asking if he was alright.
“Oh.” Potter’s eyes widened in surprise. “I do believe I am available. May I confirm and send you my answer by owl this evening?”
“I know, mama. I know.” He looked down at their entwined hands. “I know what is expected of me. I have already ended things.”
.” He paused. “I know I was nasty as a child. Even now, after years of making a concerted effort to not be that person, kindness just... is not natural to me. And I think of how it all stems back to him and his horrid expectations, how he ruined our family and our home. How he isolated us for — what? For purity? And I bought every word of it, believed it without question until the Dark Lord’s return made everything too real and frightening to ignore.”
Potter fell to the side, the most gorgeous smile gracing his lips, and he reached out to stroke Draco’s hair. “Do you have to be on your way soon?” Draco shook his head. “Then we can lie here for a while?”
As he predicted, she was anxious to discuss the previous evening, so he attempted to keep his grumblings in regard to Mr. Weasley to a minimum. She was exceptionally taken with Mrs. Granger-Weasley’s wit and educational accomplishments. His mother, too, was a competent and talented witch, though at times he feared that she had not pursued her own talents and interests in order to stand as a dutiful wife and doting mother. Why had his father not encouraged her more?
She looked the smallest bit relieved to focus on a safe topic. “He fell out of a tree yesterday, but he is just fine. St Mungo’s tended to him, and he is right as rain now.”
Draco realized that he had just passed Madame Joylove’s Tea Parlour for Drinking and Reading, and he retraced his steps, berating himself for becoming so lost in thought. When he arrived, he ducked his head to enter the short door and saw that each wall was crammed with precariously leaning towers of teacups and saucers in a variety of shapes and colors. The shop was perfumed with the sweet aroma of tea leaves, peppered with hints of bergamot, apricot, and ginger.
“Our own home has been abuzz. I am not surprised that the office is as well.” He took a sip of ale. “I have never heard of the Figg family. How are you acquainted?”
“No, at least not intentionally,” Draco responded, reaching for his hand. “I swear it.” He paused for a moment. “My mother added a final goal to the list, which I have never wanted. You must know that I
“I survived every game of Quidditch, and I have no doubt that Teddy will do the same.” Then he smiled at his aunt. “But Aunt Andromeda, Teddy is part of the reason why we have invited you here.”
to mend it (too much enthusiasm in repairing the page would have left him with a blank parchment). When he unfolded the mended page, a smaller piece of parchment fell on his lap and he turned it over to read it.
“I am not in love with any of Harry Potter’s friends,” he finally said. “I am in love with Harry Potter himself.”
“No, mother. We are taught, as pureblood families, that our magic is better and stronger than muggleborns or half-bloods. But it simply is not true. I studied this at university.”
Draco looked up at Harry, their breathing harsh and quickened. The rain had not stopped, and it was pattering against the brick and cobblestones outside.
“Ah,” Harry replied softly, looking down at their entwined hands. “I’ve already gotten so used to having you near.” He took a step forward and pressed their foreheads together. “I will miss you.”
the significance?” he sneered, shutting down his feelings of uneasiness. The last thing he needed was an imposter seer reading
His eyes trailed over Draco’s own ensemble. “Says the Malfoy in Gryffindor. I suppose we will always be at odds.”
“Draco, you should be downstairs to receive guests in five minutes,” he heard his mother call from the door. He had returned home very late in the morning, and after telling her the good news (with the more scandalous parts excluded), she allowed herself half an hour of excitement and wedding planning before they needed to go to Godric’s Hollow to finish the final touches for the ball.
The elf closed the door behind them.“The traitorous Sirius left his mother’s home to Mr. Potter when he died.”
“Use his name for good,” Mrs. Granger-Weasley interjected, giving Potter a look as if they had had this discussion before.
“And in dreams?” Potter’s tongue flicked outward to meet his fingertip as his eyes met Draco’s once more.
“What else should I do then?” Draco asked in a low voice. The conversation and Weasley’s last move had made him nervous. He commanded his rook forward.
Potter gained on him fairly quickly. Draco moved his body closer to the broom to pick up more speed in response. He had not felt so free, so unburdened since fourth year. There was no other feeling like it.
Draco nodded. “Yes.” He kissed him. “Yes,” he whispered before stepping back and heading downstairs to go home.
“Hufflepuff, actually,” she said with a whisper behind her gloved hand. “Much to my family’s chagrin.” Though she did not seem chagrined in the slightest.
, he berated himself. His mother was already suspicious of his letters; this would only make things worse.
“Mr. Malfoy, I apologise for my tardiness. My godson was visiting and I lost track of time.” He stepped aside so Draco could come in.
“And, Gods forbid, if something did happen to you before Teddy came of age, he could be adopted by both his godfather and his benefactor and we could raise him together.”
And Mr. Draco Malfoy, pureblood wizard whose reputation had certainly been slandered by The War (and perhaps even by his own actions in said war), had a plan. It read as follows:
“I dressed myself at Hogwarts, thank you very much, Mr. Potter.” Finally he was finished, removing the waistcoat before making quick work of his cravat. Potter’s collar fell open when he removed it, the pressed, white linen a stark contrast to the dark skin at his neck. He looked so gorgeously undone that Draco momentarily forgot to breathe.
“Thank you, my dear,” the woman responded. “I had so much to carry today that Mr. Potter was kind enough to come retrieve me and let me side-along with him. I didn’t want to take Hilda through the floo, you see.”
She stood and moved to the bureau in the corner of the room to withdraw parchment and a quill. “I shall start on the menu now. Do you know what foods he likes?”
He bowed in apology. “I am sorry for both startling you and subjecting you to such crass and untimely humor.”
“No. No, I am fine.” He could not believe that he was here alone with Harry Potter, with a large, tempting bed and not a soul around to disturb them. Weeks of wanting and unquenched desire would finally give way to the pleasure they both so desperately wanted. So it was not a surprise that his hands were suddenly shaking as they reached for Potter’s lapel, pausing as they brushed the fabric. “May I?” His voice was so soft that it was foreign to his own ears. Potter nodded and Draco slid the coat off of his shoulders, the sound of it hitting the floor breaking the quiet of the night.
Mrs. Granger-Weasley gave an exasperated smile. “Aditi, may I present to you Mr. Malfoy. Mr. Malfoy, this is Aditi Potter, Mr. Potter’s grandmother.”
“It is a paired diary. I have the other. Anything you write in your copy will show up in mine. So we can write to each other without prying eyes.” He reached forward and softly clasped Potter’s wrist, his fingertips caressing the soft skin there. “And this way we can write…
Draco rolled his eyes. “Very well.” It was hard to keep up with his irritation when Potter looked so… so—
“And Hermione Granger-Weasley would never lose hours in a bookshop,” Draco replied, stepping next to her to look over the stationary and calligraphy samples.
“That will work fine.” The broom was beautiful, of course, and sleek with a fresh polish. Draco had never ridden this particular model, however, and he hoped it would not be too difficult to master.
“Uh, yes, I saw,” he replied, a bit uncomfortable with the physical proximity. However, he tried to ignore it. “Though I did not realize that it was your first time. Did you enjoy it?”
“It is… acceptable,” Kreacher replied. Draco did not remember much about Kreacher but he took his response to mean that the house elf was actually quite happy here. “Please allow Kreacher to take your bag.”
“All right. I feel sober enough to Apparate, but I do not think it would be wise for you to do the same. What is the address? You can side-along with me.”
“My darling, listen to me,” she interrupted, taking his hand. “I want what is best for you. I always have. I know it is not a perfect solution, but their pristine social standing would help us tremendously. We have to make sacrifices to make up for our association with the Dark Lord.”
She tore her eyes away from Miss Astoria and looked at him. “I only vaguely remember her from school, and I was... struck by how lovely she is.”
When Draco and his mother arrived home that evening, Quelter handed Draco his letters, including one from Potter.
Draco gasped before he realized that the sound was leaving his mouth, and when he did, Harry sat up and looked at him with bleary eyes. His brows furrowed in confusion.
Potter sighed in faux exasperation and stepped back to allow him inside. Draco took off his hat and gloves and looked around the foyer. It was much lighter than he remembered; the Black family portraits and horrifying elf heads had been replaced with landscapes and still life paintings.
They waited for the aurors to disarm the wards on the manor itself, and then they stepped inside. The foyer was completely empty. Gone were the plush rugs and chandeliers and ancestral portraits. Draco took another step forward and heard his boot echo in the empty hall.
“Oh, yes. I travel when I can, in search of unidentified magical creatures. I have found two already this year! And I often help my papa with
He checked his pocket watch. “I have a couple of minutes. I have decided to Apparate because of the rain.”
Draco sunk to his knees before her and removed the needlework from her hands. He had avoided this conversation for some time, but he did not see the point in furthering the delay. “Think, mother. The Sacred Eight and Twenty. You know its names by memory as I do. Now, think of the most powerful wizards of our time. Are their names on that list? Albus Dumbledore? Harry Potter? The
Mrs. Granger-Weasley nodded. “We have heard very little about you since the trial, and now you are here to give a large sum of money and a great deal of time to a charity that
His eyes wanted to find wherever Potter happened to be, but he quickly reined in that temptation. “Are you implying that I am pining as well, Miss Lovegood?”
“Well there is a first time for everything, is there not? Now let us move on before I regret it.” Fitzy bowed and retrieved Draco’s robes, made of pale grey linen to alleviate the summer heat, and finished dressing him.
“Not worth the parchment upon which it is printed. And,” she stopped after a sudden gasp, “please tell me you used a spell to prevent conception.”
“Fitzy hopes Mr. Malfoy is happy with this evening’s attire,” said his valet. Fitzy was their oldest house elf and had been his father’s valet for many years. He rolled his moveable staircase in front of Draco and climbed it to knot his cravat.
“Very well.” Madam Joylove magicked an additional chair to their table and she sat in front of them. “Miss Lovegood?” She gestured for her teacup. Miss Lovegood handed it to her with glee before pulling a small notebook and pencil from her satchel. She turned to a blank page and awaited her reading, her body taut with anticipation. Madam Joylove produced a monocle and placed it on her eye before inspecting the cup. “Hmmmm. I see an arch, though it is slightly blurry. You will travel soon, Miss Lovegood, though it may not be an advantageous trip.”
“Mrs. Figg,” Potter said, turning from Mrs. Granger-Weasley. “May I present to you Mr. Draco Malfoy? We attended Hogwarts together.”
for when the invitations are dispersed. Who should I list if the paper would like a statement? Mr. Potter?”
“I believe George Weasley may be planning a dastardly prank against me, but other than that, I may live.”
“I know that in theory, and yet.” He dipped bread into a broken yolk and took a bite. “What is he like?”
Draco had not, until that night, touched himself while thinking of Potter. It was not because of a lack of desire, of course. He wanted Harry Potter more than he was comfortable admitting. No, instead he had feared that his feelings were one-sided or that their first kiss had only been a one-time occurence. If he had started thinking about him in such an inappropriate manner, he had been unsure if he would have been able to stop if the attraction had not been mutual. However, now they had kissed like
He grabbed Harry’s arm and escorted him away from Mrs. Malfoy. While the ballroom was a sight to behold — filled with beautiful flowers, delicate crystal and china, and intricately painted house banners — he was more interested in speaking with Harry one-on-one.  “You look incredible,” he whispered the moment they were far from prying ears. “How did I end up betrothed to such a man?”
They were edging closer to the house. “My studies have consumed most of my time the last few years. The magic of the blood is fascinating and I have greatly enjoyed working to understand it better. Otherwise, I read a great deal. And, of course, I am attempting to make amends on behalf of my family.”
Potter huffed a laugh, and his hand brushed hair from Teddy’s face. His face turned serious and then he met Draco’s eye. “Mr. Malfoy, I — I was wondering if you would like to spend the evening with me.”
“They know you are Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived and Saviour of the Wizarding World. I am sure they find your messy hair delightfully handsome and they think your perpetual habit of walking about in muggle clothing is charming and quaint.”
“She is not,” Potter replied, pulling Draco’s attention back to the conversation. “And those witches do not even know who I am.” Potter poured himself a cup of tea.
Harry looked at him, eyes shiny with frustration. “I do not know why I thought we could have a friendly dinner together.”
“Not like this.” He realised that he was trembling. “And not you. You would never.” He squeezed her hand. “You are too good.”
“Well, Hogwarts students are notoriously noncompetitive, so I do not know why you think that would be a good idea.” Potter gave a downright mischievous grin and Draco found himself grinning back.
, he thought when they entered. This was the room where Draco had been brought forward to identify Harry when his face had been hexed almost beyond recognition. It was also the place in which the Dark Lord had subjected him to the Cruciatus curse over and over the night that he had failed to kill Dumbledore. The following room was where he had watched his aunt torture Mrs. Granger-Weasley. Two rooms down was where he had watched the Dark Lord kill Charity Burbage and feed her to Nagini. And these were the steps to the dungeon where they had held a number of prisoners, including Miss Lovegood.
He did not realize that his hand had fallen to the Dark Mark, covering its inky blackness as best as he could, until Harry pried his hand away.
family protected him because it was tied to the blood of his muggle-born mother. It was so strong that the Dark Lord himself could not break it.”
Draco squeezed his eyes shut, not wishing to be awake yet. His head was pounding and he felt positively miserable; could Fitzy not realise that just by looking at him? “Mmph, not yet. Come back in an hour.”
Draco stared at the canopy above his bed as he had done every night this week. Sleep was hard to come by when his heart was in so much turmoil that he did not know how he would ever rest again. Knowing he had to see Harry at the ball tomorrow while everything was still such a mess tied his guts into knots.
“Our sister murdered my daughter. Your Dark Lord’s pet wolf murdered my husband. And I do not hear a word from you until you need something from me.” Her voice was sharp and unyielding, until she looked over at Draco. She deflated instantly. “Excuse me, Draco. I do not… include you in this,” she said softly.
Draco tossed his paper on the table and stood. “Mama, I love you dearly, but that is preposterous.” He had to leave before this conversation took a much scarier turn. “And now I shall leave you to your conspiracies about the adulterous Hermione Granger-Weasley.”
made sacrifices,” he shouted, stepping away. “We lost Father, we lost our home, we lost our standing! We are giving tremendous amounts of money to every charity in Britain!”
“I am not ‘courting’ anyone,” he said. A gentleman kissing another gentleman was hardly courting, was it? There would be no impending engagement or waltz down the aisle.
Draco opened his mouth to do so and then stopped. “To be perfectly honest, Miss Lovegood, I would like nothing more than to go home.”
A small smile graced Draco’s mouth at hearing those words. “We have the book. We will write to one another.”
And he could not tease Potter when he looked so earnest, so full of longing. So he nodded and followed him out of the salon and up the stairs to the open bedroom on the landing. When they entered, Draco saw that a candelabra was already lit and set upon the table next to the bed, and the windows were open to the warm night air.
“Has time caught up with us that quickly?” Mrs Granger-Weasley asked. Draco had not seen Harry, but his faithful friend had just pulled Draco aside to speak with him. She was in navy dress robes, and her hair was adorned with feathers.
There was a freedom in that room that surprised him. It felt easy to not only allow Harry to touch and kiss every inch of him, but to also crack open his sternum and bare his heart to the man who had once been his greatest enemy. It comforted him and flummoxed him all at once.
Draco walked down the hall and knocked on his mother’s door. He entered when she responded, and saw Lokey, the lady’s elf, tying a ribbon at the high empire waist of her Pomona green dress robes. It was the first time he had seen her look so exquisite since his father’s death. “You look lovely, mother.”
He nodded. “If you are agreeable,” he pulled a folded strip of paper out of his pocket and handed it to him. When he opened it, he saw a familiar address.
“No, but thank you very much for the reading,” Miss Lovegood replied. She turned to Draco. “Are you well?”
Thankfully, Potter didn’t seem to mind. “At first,” he said. “The house is so large and I had never lived somewhere so grand. When Ron and Hermione were married, I asked them to move to the estate and take the east wing for themselves. It has made it much more bearable.”
“Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter keeps his circle small for a reason. Everyone wants something from him; everyone is trying to take advantage of his name, his scar, his status. I do not think he has even made a new friend since fifth year. I say all of this because I am trying to give you the benefit of the doubt, much to my husband’s chagrin. But if you are another person in a long line of leeches waiting for their chance to suck him dry, I ask that you stop whatever it is you’re doing now. He deserves better than that.”
She nodded. “Yes. I do not have much patience for divination, and Mrs. Joylove tries too assertively to read one’s leaves whether one wants her to or not. I would rather just not know, thank you.”
“I can make it for us,” she replied. She inquired as to the whereabouts of the kitchen, and when they made their way there, she started to make a pot of tea. Draco sat at the work table with his head in his hands, feeling as though something had reached within him and carved out his insides. He was hollowed. Emptied.
Draco stopped in his tracks. Harry was… stunning. Draco recognised the style of his dress as Indian, and seeing him dressed so beautifully made hunger swoop in his gut. Harry was in a long, dark green, buttoned coat that fell to his knees, which was covered in small, intricately embroidered silver snakes. He wore three strands of pearls, and a silver shawl was draped over one of his arms. His silver trousers were tapered at the ankle, and his shoes, the same color as the coat, were pointed and curled at the toe.
“I’m glad that you did.” She gave him a warm smile. “My mother used to tell me stories about Merlin and Nimue. I have always wanted to visit the Forest of Brocéliande and see his tomb.”
He said his goodbyes to Miss Astoria and rushed to the invitation shop to meet his mother and Mrs. Granger-Weasley.
When they entered, Potter was the only person in the room. Would Draco be spared from an evening with Ronald Weasley after all?
They had spent the entire afternoon in a nearby tavern, getting further into their cups as the day progressed. Professor Bernard had eventually said farewell to return home to his wife, but Miss Lovegood had asked if they could visit the Tomb of Merlin. Draco had taken one look at his compatriots leaning against each other with lazy gazes and soft grins, and decided that none of them were in any state to Disapparate. So they had walked to the Forest of Brocéliande, and by the time they had arrived, Draco’s cravat was loosened at his neck in a poor attempt to cool himself.
“Maybe one day you will learn,” Harry responded, tapping his index finger against Draco’s nose. Then his face grew serious. “Draco, you’re not that person anymore, and if you were, I would not be here. I know who you were and I know what you have done. And I also know what you have done since then. If you continue to make the decision every day to right your wrongs and to make our world a better place, then that mark does not define you anymore.”
“Every day? That is a tall order, Mr. Potter.” He attempted to jest, but his voice belied his uneasiness.
Weasley’s eyes moved between the board and Draco as he warred with himself. He obviously wanted to play but did not want to play with him. Perhaps they could bond over their mutual feelings of disdain. “Very well,” he replied.
He smiled, though obviously still confused. “Gladly. And we hope to see you again soon as well, Mr. Malfoy.”
He looked at his mother and she nodded for him to continue. “I would like to name Teddy as my heir.”
“Ah, here we are,” Mr. Greengrass said as they approached the gate, as if Draco would not know where the entrance to his own home would be located. He motioned for the aurors to come forward to undo the wards. As they did so, Draco looked through the iron barrier before him and saw that the grounds that had once been expertly cared for were now overgrown and in disrepair. Weeds poked out of the gravel path before them, and the grass to either side must have been knee-high. He wondered what happened to their peacocks.
He nodded and gave a slight bow to his aunt before exiting the room. At first he waited in the hall for a few minutes until he realised it might be a while until they finished. So he escaped to the library, though he was unable to do anything except nervously fidget and think about everything he had just heard.
“Hmm, me too,” he mumbled sleepily. When Draco looked down, he saw that the boy had closed his eyes.
Mrs. Granger-Weasley began to tidy up the other samples into a small pile. “Miss Lovegood wrote to me,” she stated. “She said that the two of you met for tea.”
“It specifically looks at how magical healing is so much more advanced than muggle healing, and questions how and whether the Wizarding World should aid them.”
“You are beautiful,” Draco said before he even realised that the words had escaped his mouth. Potter ducked his head, smiling despite himself, before crawling on top of him. Then he ground his hips against Draco’s, and Potter moaned so sweetly, his head tipping back, baring his throat in an invitation for Draco to kiss and bite and suck and bruise.
When she finally calmed down, he reached into his pocket, handed her his handkerchief, and kissed her forehead.
Draco paused and leaned over him. “You absolutely planned this entire thing.” Harry smiled bashfully, and Draco could not help but lean in and kiss him. “Scheming like a Slytherin.”
Potter’s response to Draco’s missive had been brief, but positive. A new charity often needed money and Draco would have been surprised if he had been turned down. However, Draco was still glad for the good response. The Malfoy name connected to the charity of the Wizarding World’s saviour would certainly put them on the proper path to restoration.
If only Harry had seen him for just a moment, just long enough to apologise, not even to try to woo him or fix things. He wondered if Harry missed him, if he thought of him, or had his anger been enough to drive Draco from his thoughts completely?
Potter’s smile slipped for a fraction of a second, and Draco was reminded of the last time Potter graced their home, even if it was a different house. Draco’s aunt had tortured Mrs. Granger-Weasley and his family had attempted to turn him over to the Dark Lord at Malfoy Manor. He could not have happy memories of that visit.
“Well,” She said, averting her eyes in clear discomfort, “I would usually read this and say that a spark of insight is in your future. However,” she turned the cup toward him so that he could see, “the leaves know you more than I do. If lightning is significant to you in some way, follow your own inner eye. What does it tell you?”
“Draco,” she said, pulling him out of his own brooding. “I read your notes like you asked me to. About blood magic.”
She stopped on the path and turned toward him. “I do not think Mr. Potter has minded your presence of late either. ”
He could resist just fine if those lips moved to Draco’s cock, he thought suddenly. He moaned at the image, feeling himself get closer. Had Potter ever done that with anyone? Draco would be happy to teach him, to grab him by his dark curls and guide Potter’s mouth over his cock. Potter would look at him with glistening eyes as Draco’s length slid in and out between his lips, and oh, the thought of Potter pleasuring him in such a manner sent him very quickly over the edge. His eyes squeezed shut at the intensity of his climax, his cock pulsing ribbons of come on his nightshirt. His body shuddered, and he breathed heavily until his body stilled.
“Here you are,” she said upon opening the door. “Mr. Potter should be here shortly. Thank you for the chat, Mr. Malfoy.”
“She was very proud when I told her I was going away. She told me I would do great things. It was not until years later that I realized the truth.”
The party gave way to dancing, starting with Potter and Mrs. Granger-Weasley moving to the dance area. Draco stood on the side, watching as the pair twirled together. What would it be like to ask Potter for a dance, to touch him openly, to allow the world to see his private affection? What would it be like to ask for so many dances that every person at this festive occasion knew the intentions that Draco Malfoy had for Harry Potter?
He squeezed her hand and took a deep breath; the smallest attempt to ready himself for the future before him.
It did not take long for Godric’s Hollow to fill with guests, conversation, and laughter. He kept a weathered eye on the house points hourglasses to see who was winning (Ravenclaw, unfortunately), and made his way around the room to mingle with the crowds.
Draco shook his head and tore his eyes away from Potter, finding himself looking at Miss Lovegood. She was gazing wistfully at the dancers, and Draco came to her side.
Draco shook his head to dismiss it. “I have discussed the idea of the inter-house unity ball with my mother and we have several ideas to get us started. We would like to hold the event off Hogwarts grounds while still giving guests the feeling of being in the Great Hall. Enchanted ceilings, meals traditionally served at the school, and such. The dress code will be formal, however there will be a twist: guests will be required to wear colors that correspond to a house that was not their own.”
Draco paced in an attempt to calm himself, shocked by his own reaction to Potter’s story. “If Mrs. Figg looked after you on Dumbledore’s behalf then he knew. He knew what your family was like and what they did to you. And yet he allowed you to stay there and be treated like chattel.”
“I just… I wanted to come here one last time,” he said, an uncomfortable wave of embarrassment building in his gut. “I thought it would be empty. I did not know that you — I’m sorry again. For intruding.”
Draco did not sleep well that night. He could not stop thinking about his conversation with Weasley, and he kept envisioning his smug grin when he had won the chess match.
“Are you courting anyone? Is there a special someone in your life? You are a wealthy man who must be in want of a wife. My readers are dying to know.” She leaned forward in anticipation at such an unnatural angle that Draco thought a breeze might knock her over.
He decided to start with his most egregious wrongdoings and penned his first letter to Katherine Bell. After writing a missive to apologise for almost ending her life, he did the same for Weasley. He wondered if he should also make amends for his less than idyllic behaviour at Hogwarts and figured it may be for the best.
He sighed as he grabbed his wand to clean himself. He had at least a fortnight until he could see Potter again, and he had no idea how he could wait so long. Even after his body had been sated, he felt such an intense yearning to see him and be with him.
“Potter…” Draco trailed off in disbelief. This was too much. His mistreatment at the hands of his own family, his lack of wizarding education until he stepped foot onto Hogwarts ground, the fact that— “I cannot believe that Professor Dumbledore allowed that to happen to you.” He stood up, anger bubbling so suddenly in his blood that untamed magic rippled under his skin.
They crawled under the covers and faced each other, legs tangling as magic tingled against his skin while Potter cleaned the traces of their coupling.
The suggestion sounded positively revolting, but Draco tried his best to smile. “Thank you for the recommendation. I shall consider it.”
“Potter,” Draco breathed and turned to face him. “I think you and I have always had a peculiar interest in each other’s comings and goings. Unless I was mistaken about the person clumsily following me about in sixth year?” Potter shook his head with an uncomfortable half-smile. “However much I thought I knew about you in school was all wrong, though. I thought that, well, that you were raised the same way I had been — praised for your powerful position in the world and lavished with any plaything you could possibly want. If I had received those things as a Malfoy, then surely the Boy Who Lived had an even better life than I did. However, I now know the truth and I… I would not wish that on most people, let alone someone whom I— I care for.” Draco searched his face, hoping that Potter had heard the meaning in his words.
“Yes, you may be right, darling,” Mrs. Malfoy said. “I will bring this to Mrs. Pearlman and see what else she has.”
“What has your head in the clouds? And why on earth are you sitting like that?” Mrs. Malfoy’s voice pulled him from his daydreams.
Teddy let go of his hand and knelt in the dirt, motioning for Draco to join him with one hand and putting his index finger to his lips with the other to quiet him. He lifted one of the large leaves of the pumpkin plant, and there sat a garden gnome munching happily on a strawberry, his little face covered in red juices. His eyes opened and widened a second later when he saw Teddy. He gasped and then made a very quick escape into the thick of the garden.
Draco stepped forward and took Harry’s hand in his, squeezing it reassuringly as he was unsure of another way to comfort him. He did not know if he and Weasley would ever get along, and he did not want to make promises he could not keep. Not when everything felt so hopeful and new.
“Please, let us speak of happier things! We cannot let the simters ruin our rendezvous. Speak of something good.”
“More stubborn than you are?” Professor Bernard asked with a hearty laugh. “I assume your opinion of him must have changed a great deal since boyhood.” Bernard knew of Draco’s past. He had seen Draco at his lowest point, dusted him off, and given him mentorship and guidance. He had shown Draco how even the mysteries of the Wizarding World could be explained through research and science. He had had no preconceived notions of the Malfoy family and had neither eyed him warily nor shamelessly groveled when Draco had begun his studies. Even after Draco had told him everything, he had still given him a chance to learn and grow into the person he was trying to become. Draco would always be grateful for the kindness Professor Bernard had shown him.
“Mr. Malfoy?” she asked, opening her eyes, which very quickly grew to the size of saucers when she saw his mother. “Oh.”
“Darling,” he responded without thinking. And though that word had pained Harry the first and last time Draco had said it, this time he simply closed his eyes and leaned his head against the wall. Draco climbed the stairs until he was standing before him.
“That may be part of it. Hermione thinks it is a combination of a few things.” He took a deep breath and told Draco about the Elder Wand, that it was more than a children’s tale, that Draco himself had been its master for a time.
“‘And, dear readers,’” his mother read aloud. “‘I asked the question you all want to know: is there a special someone in Draco Malfoy’s life? “Let a gentleman have his secrets,” he responded, with a fetching blush.’” Mrs. Malfoy glanced up from the paper, giving him the same look she gave yesterday over his spilled letter.
“It’s clever, though a bit sneaky,” Miss Lovegood whispered beside him. Her gloved hand curled around a glass of wine. Miss Astoria had not yet arrived, but three of her would-be suitors were already in the salon.
Potter took his hand and pressed against him once more. “I want you too badly, Mr. Malfoy, to play games.” He stepped back, their hands still entwined, and he pulled Draco to encourage him to follow. “Please.”
been in talks, and for a while I thought that I may one day ask for your hand in marriage. But the truth is, Miss Astoria, that my heart belongs to someone else. At first, I thought it would be an impossible match, but I have hope that that is no longer the case. And it would be unfair to both of us if I promised myself to you when I loved someone else.”
“Mr. Malfoy?” There was a hand at his shoulder nudging him. “Mr. Malfoy.” Draco was still on his knees, and when he looked up, he saw Miss Lovegood standing before him. “Are you alright? So much time has passed that I became worried that something had happened.” She looked around. “Where is Mr. Potter?”
When his anger subsided enough to speak evenly, Draco had but one answer. “No,” he replied. “No, I have not.” He called out his play.
Despite his wandering mind, he still felt decently prepared to greet Mrs. Skeeter in their salon, ready not only with his own talking points, but also with Mrs. Granger-Weasley’s prepared statements about the charity. He offered to share the interview with Mrs. Granger-Weasley to make it seem less like the opportunity to help their reputation that it was, but she quickly declined when she realised whom the
They would have ended up on a chaise, cravats left half undone in frustration, fall fronts open so that they could rut against each other with pre-come slicking the way. And kissing, of course. They would never stop kissing. How could Draco resist when Potter’s mouth was so full and pink and such pretty sounds parted from those lips?
And as their palms touched and they turned about the room, Draco thought they could probably get through anything as long as they did it together.
Anger quickly bubbled within him, and he clenched his jaw forcefully in response. Draco had had a temper as a child. He could see now, after years of self-reflection, that he had been spoiled and sheltered and an absolute arse in school. While he had worked to better himself during the last few years, he still found it difficult not to pull out his wand and hex Weasley on the spot. He tried to focus, instead, on the breathing technique he used for occlumency to compartmentalise his annoyance and ire.
