“So I would imagine madam, I have already made them along with my own statement, Harry, I have been working on the spell for your brace, although it is the same spell the sizing needs to be changed. I will need to see if more adjustments need to be made...Stand as straight as you can for me, there’s a good Lad” Tobias flicked his wand and muttered an incantation that caused Harry to feel as though pressure was being tightly woven around his bones. It tugged at his hips and his spine before settling around his shoulders and then his neck. It made him stand straighter than he had ever stood before. It made him cry out in pain and surprise more so when his legs felt as though they were being twisted and straightened. “I’m so sorry my lad, but I promise that it will help once it starts to work. Perhaps we shall keep the spell on for only half a day at first, Lady Malfoy”
“We will be right behind you, Sev” Remus replied, and Harry reluctantly let go of Draco’s hand and stepped over to his father. Severus’ hand came to rest on his shoulder, and he guided him over to the fireplace that was already burning a bright green.
Draco craned his neck over the crowds of people looking for messy hair and green eyes. He had enjoyed his time with his parents, but he was worried about his friend being with so many people he didn’t know.
“Nones of the elven survived. It sents them insane” Jinx shuddered violently her large eyes filling with tears and Remus immediately apologised to the elf.
“Seamus Finnigan and me mam, Bridget Finnigan…You all going to Hogwarts next year?” Seamus asked as they trailed down from the boxes and Harry gave a nod pointing to himself and his friends.
“…Harry…You’re my friend, of course I worry when something like that happens. I worry about Pants and she drives me crazy most of the time. Given how we found you with those muggles of course I will worry more but only because you are my very best friend and you will never embarrass me Harry” Draco promised him solemnly his eyes so sincere that Harry felt tears prickling in his own eyes and he moved forward wrapping his arms around his friend and hugging him tightly. “And whatever is causing this…Uncle Sev and my Parents will figure it out Harry”
Draco stared at the hand as though it were something dangerous before reaching out tentatively and taking it with his own.
“I hate this!” Harry whined as they were both pulled through the fire and down the Floo network. They bounced around for a minute or two, Harry had his eyes closed and didn’t see all the little rooms they passed by before arriving at their destination, but Draco did, and he found that it helped. He stepped out the fire on the other end gracefully while Harry stumbled beside him. Draco caught his friends’ arm, stopping him from falling into the ground while a cleaning spell knocked the dust and soot from their clothes.
Harry drowned out the following conversation between Draco and Seamus, knowing that it was everything that he had already heard. Both his friends were excited about the upcoming year but Harry was terrified. He had only bad memories of school and school kids and the last year learning at home had been amazing. He had wanted to beg Remus and Severus to let him stay home and continue home education, but Draco was excited about real school and he couldn’t bear to be separated from Draco.
“Mother remarried so I was forced to cut time short with my paternal family. My new step father has an estate outside Hogsmeade not far from the Nott estate. Why are you here?”
“God father” Draco responded softly though his eyes were harsh and his face stiff. The boy was just as his father had been and he would be no less intimidating when he was the same age as his father was now. Knowing full well had earned the anger of the Malfoy’s he turned his attention to the boy he had hurt the day before. It hadn’t been a physical hurt but he knew better than most that not all hurt was the physical kind. He was not a man known for his soft nature though he did care for those that were put into his house.
“Dear Harry, you are very welcome and it’s a pleasure to have told you something about your parents, I’m sorry it was not more however, my God father was in the same year as them at school so he would be able to give more information about their time there by the time you have received this I will have written to him. The Scorching Herons are an amazing team, my parents shall be taking me to Japan later in the year and I am hoping to see them play.
“Welcome, Lady Malfoy, Lord Malfoy, Professor Snape, Mister Lupin” She said politely bowing her head. Madam Malkin was always happy to see them and Harry had grown to rather like her. She never seemed to judge them like some of the other store owners. “Robes for Hogwarts? I was surprised that you hadn’t already been in, no matter we will have you all fixed up. If you want to step this way dears and we will get you measured.” The floating tape measure was out before she had even finished speaking and Harry batted it away with a laugh as he stepped up onto one of the stools while Draco and Pansy climbed onto the other two. “Excited to be finally going to Hogwarts, dears?”
“He is pretty much being rewarded for acting like a spoilt toddler. It’s not as if Slytherin house wanted him anymore than he wanted to be there.”
“Very good, it is a shame your trip was so short but it is always there for you to return to when you can, hello my heart”
“Oh…Um…I didn’t…I forgot…” Harry spluttered suddenly realising that they would have to buy a guitar and everything he would need to learn to play. He felt his embarrassment creeping up into his cheeks as his hands twitched nervously. It wasn’t long after Christmas, everyone had already spent so much money on him. He was just about to open his mouth and protest when Severus held up his hand.
“Oh! Good afternoon! How are…Bless my very soul, Harry Potter!” The ghost gasped swooping in and peering closer to Harry so he could see the scar. He didn’t quite touch him but still a cold shiver raced down Harry’s front, but always wanting to be polite he carefully collected himself and corrected the ghost.
“Please, just call me Lucius or even Luci” Lucius smiled setting his paper aside before frowning ever so slightly as he looked him up and down. “You look a little pale, have a drink, some pumpkin juice will bring some colour to your cheeks”
When he woke up again it was to Jinx pulling at his bed sheets her bright elven eyes staring at him as she gave him a smile. Draco’s side of the bed was already empty and cold, and Harry shivered wrapping himself in the heavy blanket. Even in a magical manor they couldn’t deny it was almost winter and his feet were freezing.
“You and my dad were good friends? Uncle Sev’ told me that you would have better memories of dad than he did, it’s why he suggested that I write to you” Harry told the man who looked surprised by that and somewhat hurt as he asked;
Yes my parents are both pure blood, in fact my mother was second cousin to your father through the Black line (I have enclosed a small family tree). I see, father says that muggles get jealous over what they don’t have. The last time we tried to expose ourselves to Muggles they tried to burn/hang us. Of course that is impossible and mostly they ended up killing themselves for the most part. Although you haven’t said much your family sounds like the worst kind of muggles. Your cousin is unable to read?
“Diden youse have fun little masters?” She asked holding up the tray and both boys launched into a happy description of their day. Jinx listened with a happy smile on her face. “Its sounden likes you had the bestest times!”
“Not yet perhaps, but I did not know Draco when I birthed him, he was still family. Now come dry those eyes my little Harry, and smile once more”
“My heart, they have just gotten engaged! How can they have thought of dates yet” Lucius chuckled, but in his heart, Severus knew that he wanted to marry in the autumn. It was when he had first seen Remus sitting under a tree with the red and gold leaves falling around him. If he could recreate that moment somehow, he would be happy.
“Little Masters Harry!” Jinx gasped her eyes almost comically wide before she popped away to fetch Narcissa who had been heading to her nursery to tend to her roses. The matriarch of the Malfoy family appeared a moment or two later holding to Jinx.
“I believe that we should get robes first. Then books. They seem like the least busy.” Narcissa said looking over at a gaggle of children with their noses pressed to the window of quality Quidditch supplies. It was only then that Harry remembered that the new model Nimbus was coming out and that the shop already had a display model. Draco looked longingly over to the shop but both Lucius and Narcissa had refused to allow him to have one stating that there was no need as first years weren’t allowed to play on the house teams. His friend had been whining about the unfairness of it for a few days now and Harry had learnt to drown him out.
“Mr Weasley and Mr Weasley, how unexpected to see you both here, during a weekday...” Severus’ voice was music to his ears and a balm to his heart. He could tell that the Weasley twins had different feelings. Their faces had grown white and their eyes were bulged out of their heads. “I am almost certain that you should both be in a history of magic right now, not terrorising children”
“Looks like I’m in the right place then, Draco” Saying the blondes given name just as deliberately. He flashed a smile and then bowed his head before walking into Madam Malkins. Instead of the plump witch he had been expecting Harry was surprised to find himself looking into the pale face of Theodore Nott. The heir of the Nott house had never stood trial if he remembered correctly so seeing him standing in a fitted suit with a tape measure around his shoulders was a little stunning. He had imagined that Nott had gone into potions or something studious like that, he had always been the more quiet member of Draco’s followers. “Nott”
Severus barely spared a glance up from his potions journal when he heard the portrait to his private quarters opening and closing. He had situated himself in front of the fire his robe removed as he relaxed. There were only three people that could access his rooms uninvited. Himself, Remus, and Harry and since Remus was currently on a mission of sorts with Lucius, trying to find out more about the horcruxes, it had to be Harry. Sure, enough his son and godson were soon walking into the small living room giving him a smile. The smiles came more readily these days and Severus couldn’t help but return it before finishing the article he had been reading and closing the magazine.
“Harry? Are you okay? You have been quiet tonight” Draco whispered slipping into bed beside him and Harry turned onto his side to look at his friend. Draco looked even more pale in the moonlight while his eyes were warm with concern. He was dressed in his light grey pyjamas and his hair was unnaturally straight from brushing it with his magical hairbrush. Harry gave him a very small smile that he knew didn’t reach his eyes before humming;
“No, to do so would be madness but I had hoped he had told you that at least” Lucius sighed taking his wine glass and having a sip. Severus sighed moving back to his own chair and wishing he had something stronger than wine. The images of the abuse Harry had suffered were clearly in his mind and they were over lapping with his own images of his father, alcohol on his breath belt and bible in hand.
“Dragon, if you want to go to the zoo before we must return to the manor you must hurry” Narcissa hummed softly when they seemed to have finished and for some reason Harry was surprised when the face of a clock appeared in front of her. It cast a silvery glow against her face telling them all that it was already half two. “Forgive us for rushing off, we have an appointment for five that we simply cannot miss. Pansy are you still coming with us to the Zoo?”
“What was her problem?” Chao-Xiang growled as they made their way back to the castle for lunch, she and Alice had joined them as soon as possible and the girl looked as angry as Draco. “She seemed to be picking on you both.”
“I think your dad mentioned an ancestor that was a Parselmouth, Harry, don’t worry about it. It’s interesting! Think of all the things you can learn!” Remus grinned with more excitement than Severus clapping him on the shoulder before he turned amber eyes onto the snake who reared back tasting the air rapidly.
“Annoying to be honest” Harry answered with a shrug though he had to admit he did rather like the Doves. They were like alarm clocks that morning waking him up exactly the time he had said he wanted to get up and the song they sang was beautiful much better than Ron singing off key when he showered.
“But I still wish I knew more” Harry sighed not wanting to be a hassle for the Malfoy’s when they were being so nice to him.
“I did, very much, as soon as I knew that the prince I was meant to marry was you I stopped fighting it and tried to learn as much as possible so I won’t embarrass you as your consort” Draco gave a smile but shook his head. He didn’t need him to be anything but his Boy from the forest. He had fallen in love with him covered in dirt and carrying loads of washing.
“Very well, as I see it Narcissa has rights as Guardian at least for the time being, she is head of House Black and Harry is a Black as well as a Potter. It’s not the end of it but from what I have seen and heard if the Malfoy’s wanted to harm Harry they would have left him with his relatives”
“My right!” Pansy said in a breathless way and Harry watched as the man pulled her a little further into the room and then started to look her over. A thin tape measure appeared, and Harry watched as it took the length of her arm, her fingers and even the space between her nostrils. Ollivander had already bustled off with surprising speed for a man that looked to be over 100. He was soon moving around the shop pulling out a dozen or boxes and floating them over to the counter. With a strange fascination Harry watched as the tape measure started to try and measure Pansy’s eyelashes until the man waved his hand and it fell to the floor like a limp snake.
“No, unfortunately I have to speak with some of my Slytherins.” Severus gave a pinched sigh and then ushered them through the portrait before heading in the opposite direction.
“I do, less so now than I once did but sometimes they come all the same. Unlike you I deserve the nightmares” Lucius let out heavy sigh before flashing him a smile and patting him on the knee. “How about we go to the kitchen and have some warm milk? I would call an elf but the walk will do us both some good I feel” Harry nodded slowly pushing back his blanket and stepping out of the bed. “Put on some slippers, the floor is cold on the toes and the last thing you need is to catch a chill”
“You know I love Potions, Dad! And helping curse damage sounds really interesting.” Harry said with sincerity and Severus felt a wide smile spread over his lips. Never in all his years would he have dared believe that he would have a son that would share an interest in potions. “Do you think it would work?”
“Yeah, and that is just one example of how horrible he is. He made little Suzie in Hufflepuff cry the other day and then gave her detention when she wouldn’t stop crying”
“You must learn to only apologise for things that are your fault. This is not your fault and you should not be down-hearted, many fully grown wizards cannot perform wandless magic” Lucius said and before he could stop himself Harry let out a snort saying in a depressed voice
“I see, so Harry Potter is living with muggles, I did wonder where the boy was taken. Many of the wizarding families wanted to take him in but Dumbledore said he had found family that would care for him” She told him when she had finished. She passed him his note back and Draco slipped it into the pocket of his robes. “You should write back to him, Dragon, tell him about our world, his world”
“Yes, morons, but enough! No talking about Dumbledore today of all days Harry! It’s the twelfth day! We have the feast this evening and twelfth night cake today while we burn the yule log”
“Aunt Petunia got fed up with my hair looking like a bird’s nest and so she cut it until I was almost bald. I had to go to school the next day, kids already bullied me” Harry sighed as Draco let out another happy, even louder shout, a look behind him told him that he had almost knocked the dummy completely over and was positively dancing on the spot.
“You’re welcome. Eat, we will have some time to wander around Hogsmeade, would you care to join us, Lupin”
They grabbed their jumpers and the robes the Malfoy’s had brought them for Yule. They were almost identical though Draco’s had a grey fur lining, and he had a deep green. Both had swirling emblems with their initials on the front with an owl and a peacock. Narcissa had stitched them herself each stitch perfect and the threads shimmering different colours as they caught the lights in different angles and Harry couldn’t stop touching it whenever he was wearing it. A silver clasp fastened the robe closed and Harry shivered as he felt a pulse of protection magic settling over him. Remus had been the one to weave the magic into the fabric and he could feel his papa’s magic circling around him like a warm blanket. As always, he smiled and then had his hand taken by Draco again.
“They might, they have a much better keeper now, but the Devils in Amber have better beaters” Draco answered with a nod and Harry bit on his lip looking down at the table only just realising that his plates had been vanished away. Pansy sucked on her top lip for a moment before saying in an uncertain way;
“Yes, professor” The twins said with a bob of their heads before they made a run for the castle obviously realising that they hadn’t been given a detention and didn’t want to stay around in case Severus could think of one. The potions master watched them vanish into the arched doorway of the castle and then made his way back down the drive. He waited until he was through the wards before swirling his magic around him and cracking with apparition to the Three Broomsticks.
“Why? Why did you turn your teacher’s wig blue?” Nino laughed as she asked her eyes twinkling brightly with amusement and Harry felt his cheeks blush. At the time he didn’t think he had turned it blue, but then he hadn’t believed in magic, thinking about it now though he could remember how upset and angry he had been with the man and how stupid his wig was.
“She…It’s a female snake” Harry whispered back looking at the snake who was truly looking at him now her head tilted to one side and Harry was sure that if snakes could smile she would be smirking.
Harry felt confused, he was hurten again, he didn’t know why, he had been a good boy at school, he had written his letters nice! Miss Wright had told him that he had the bestest hand writing in class. He had been so happy to tell Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. He was sure that they would love him then. Petunia had slapped him hard across the cheek calling him a nasty little liar. Dudley hadn’t been able to write the lines so why could he? A little freak. He had to have cheated. She had locked him in his cupboard until Vernon had come home and then she had dragged him out and he had felt the sting of the belt while Vernon had repeated that he was a nasty, no good freak, that he should have died along with his parents. He had then been put back in his cupboard with nothing to eat.
“That was fucking amazing” He moaned and Harry let out a laugh his legs feeling like jelly as he moved to turn around only to find himself sinking to the floor Draco following behind his arms wrapped around him. For long minutes never of them spoke but eventually Draco muttered “As nice as that was Potter, what happens now?”
Okay, I was going to make Brighton or Blackpool the place Harry wanted to go but to be Honest Skegness was just funnier for me to imagine the Malfoys going. Skeggy (For anyone that might not know) was/is a popular tourist destination for not rich families, and would have been popular at the time Harry Potter is set, not that the Dursleys would have gone there.
“Harry! Draco!” Twin voices shouted, loudly, as the doors to the potion classroom were thrown open. Harry looked up with a smile seeing his ginger haired friends coming in the room followed by other students from both Slytherin and Gryffindor. The twins dumped their bags onto a table at the front and then raced to them squeezing their shoulders. “What are you doing here?”
“Trust me, if helping you gets me into trouble it will be the first time I would be proud of why I was in trouble, but have no fear of that. Here we are at the kitchens” Another opening appeared and Harry found himself ushered into a large kitchen. It was bigger than any kitchen he had ever been in before with a large green oven set back into an alcove with a spit and a fire pit attached. A large wooden work surface stood proudly in the centre and more than a dozen cupboards of all shapes and sizes were around. Shiny brass pans were hanging from hooks on a rack which also held dried herbs tied into bundles. “Okay! It’s been some time since I’ve made warm milk but I am positive that we will be able to figure it out”
“Oh, just ignore him, mum was giving us a lecture about the Evil Malfoy’s being death eaters” George said dropping into the seat beside Draco and Harry. “Are you a little death eater, Draco?”
“I...Better...Thank-you, I’m sorry for being so much of a fuss” Harry whispered flushing brightly under the looks he was being given from both the adult Malfoy’s. Lucius hadn’t spoken but he seemed just as happy as his wife that Harry was now awake.
“…I found out that I liked having sex with men…” Harry hummed quietly, and Draco almost choked on the whiskey he had been drinking. His eyes bulged out of his head as he stared at the saviour of the wizarding and muggle world.
“Rosmerta’s been around kids long enough to know what they like Harry and what they actualy need” Remus said taking on of the Doughnuts with a pale flush  coming to his cheeks. “Thanks Severus”
“I’m probably going into Slytherin, but who knows? Only last year I would have said Draco is Slytherin through and through but now, he’s more of a Hufflepuff…And Harry, with his fathers he will end up in Ravenclaw all brains right Harry?” Pansy smiled while Draco huffed out a breath.
“No, Harry, he is the advisor to King Lucius I think…Severus Snape, I really must go, the crowds are making me nervous.” Remus did look a little skittish as he looked at the milling crowd but for once no eyes were on him all focused on the man in front of them who had raised a hand. Remus hurried off in the direction of the forest and Harry watched him go before turning back to the man who had started to speak.
Phew…So I’m back! Sort of, sorry it wasn’t Classmate…(If you are reading that there is a slight note explaining and asking a question!)
“I’m so sorry” Harry whimpered his eyes filling with tears as he looked at the kind and caring faces. Both looked so concerned while he had been acting so mean to them.
“It feels amazing.” Draco said pleased as punch that he had gotten his wand so quickly. He did a few more flicks and lights danced merrily while Harry felt both Remus and Severus’s hands coming to rest on either of his shoulders.
“Very well, but go easy on him, Harry dear do you have a favourite colour?” Narcissa asked as Draco and Harry stood up quickly. Harry shuffled his feet and then chewed hard on his lower lip. His brows creased together as he hummed;
“Oh? You didn’t? Then it must have been another blonde boy crying about the monsters under his bed” Narcissa laughed a merry laugh taking up the book and flipping it open. She cleared her throat delicately and then slowly began reading her voice having an almost magical quality to it. He found himself inching closer to her as she read watching the magical pictures moving “Many thought that Boris the brave was foolishly named. There was naught brave about the little knight from a no name town in the highest hills of Scotland. He had fought no dragons nor killed any werewolves. He told himself daily that he longed for such an adventure but his dearest mother was very old and very sick. It wasn’t right for him to leave her” She read happily turning the page delicately as a fire was lit in the grate by Lucius casting a warm glow over the family and Harry. “He was tired of people saying that he wasn’t brave though. He thought standing in the tallest tower of his castle and looking out over the lands. Nobody thought he was brave, when he passed everyone would say ‘Boris the Brave’ not likely, more like Boris the Coward’ then they would laugh at him.
“Perhaps not but who am I to disallow the son of two Marauders to perhaps cause some havoc in the walls of Hogwarts?” Severus allowed his lips to curl into a smile his own eyes closing as Remus let out a bark of laughter.
“No, he was a muggle, but it was back when muggles and wizards lived together. As time as gone on and muggles have forgotten about magic, they wrote that Umeda Mai opened a school of the arts, for Geisha. Muggle historians have been trying to find it for years” Nino smirked happily at the thought and Harry was beginning to realise she had a slightly sadistic sense of humour and enjoyed the thought of many historians searching for something they would never find. “Since only those loyal to the emperor could attend the school most other areas of Japan continued to practice the natural way of magic and over the years that has remained the same. Most Japanese witches and wizards do it even now only a few bother buy wands for their children and send them to the school…”
“I will come if I may Lady Malfoy” Pansy said happily taking one of the sweet treats and coming over to Harry. “You look very handsome Harry, don’t look so worried, an hour or two here and then you won’t have to return for a year if you don’t want to, of course, Crow likes to shop, he is as vain as one of Lord Malfoy’s peacocks!”
“Nino-chan! Over here!” A voice shouted excitedly, and Harry jerked his head to the sound. The man calling for the teacher was Japanese with black hair that hung to the edge of his chin, though one side was partially shaved above the ear. His teeth were large curved almost like a chipmunk on the front and his cheeks were rounded. He was wearing a suit jacket over a shirt, and grey trousers with polished black shoes. His shoulders were slopped but he looked muscular.
“…Is it? Is that what you really think? Or is that what those muggles told you? I think you should talk to them. I really think you upset Remus” Draco told him and Harry nodded rubbing his face with one hand. He had grown so much in the time that he had been with the Malfoy’s and he knew that he was in some ways a lot more mature than some children his age but in a lot of things he was still very much a child.
“Master Draco sirs, you should take Little Master Harry to your Mama’s sunroom! Jinx will bringen youse some cookies and hot chocolate” Jinx said and Harry watched Draco’s face transform into a huge smile as he asked in a child like way;
“I wouldn’t put anything passed that twinkly eyed coot” Lucius muttered folding the paper and setting it aside showing a picture of the Old Coot in question looking up from the steps of the Ministry. Narcissa pursed her lips before saying softly;
“Nothing so easy Draco, it seems that the wizarding world is fine with leaving the boy who lived in the hands of muggles that starve and beat him but they don’t believe that I could possibly have the best interests of the boy in mind” Lucius huffed and his steely eyes moving to Hestia who swallowed putting her chocolate cup back onto the table. “But have no fear I will contact Fudge about this, I won’t let it stand. Harry is a Black heir, Sirius Black was his God father but as he is in no position to care for the boy your mother has rights, more so than Dumbledore no matter what he is claiming”
“Yes, Mistress Narcissa!” Jinx squeaked appearing at the their side immediately. Her large eyes widened even further as she saw Harry curled against Narcissa “Youse is having a funny turns again, Little Master Harrys! Jinxes here! Youse tells old Jinxes what youse needs!”
“No! It’s amazing! Your magic wants to stay with me! I bet if I did the same spell my magic would want to be with you!” Draco’s thin pale arm landed around his waist pulling him up into a lazy hug as he lay his chin on his head before saying “What did you think of Professor Flitwick? He seems fun! His face when his father made him promise to floo his mother!”
“My heartiest of congratulations, Severus, and you Remus” Flitwick said brightly after they had all toasted the adoption with a glass of champagne. Even Harry and Draco had been allowed a sip, but Harry hadn’t really liked it and he was sure that Draco was pretending.
“I see” Harry hummed making a mental note to read up on Brownies more later but he turned his attention to Jinx passing his books to Lupin. He threw his arms around the elf and hugged her tightly “Thank-you Jinx, and thank all the elves! I love my gift!”
“If you keep saying things like that, I will tell mother about what you were doing in the painting of the nuns. She will lock you in the basement” Draco huffed amused when the Knight put his helmet back on very quickly and then went back to his pose of holding his banner high in the air. “Sorry about that, even as a painting Horologium is full of hot air, but he’s mostly harmless, except when he’s had a drink”
“Is this educational or pleasure?” Severus asked after a few moments watching and was surprised when he saw Lucius give a sheepish expression turning to face him and fixing his hair with his hands.
“Well done, Dray, try again, knock that dummy out!” Nino shouted clapping her chunky hands and Draco puffed up like a Peacock focusing his attention on the dummy again thin beads of sweat appearing on his brow. “So, all of the times your magic has only manifested when you have been upset and angry? It’s not uncommon, heightened emotions are triggers for accidental magic. You have had to deal with a lot, Harry, more than I could possibly know and now you are happy. Your magic doesn’t feel the need to come out and protect you and that’s fine. It’s a good thing, it will learn to adjust to coming out when you’re happy. Draco hasn’t needed that that’s why his magic is freer…I’m guessing your family hated magic?”
“It was interesting, she...She doesn’t seem to be like any teacher I’ve ever met before” Harry admitted thinking back on the lessons. They had been done in a pretty summer house in the middle of the Malfoy estate. Harry had learned it was also where she lived while she was here and the entire place was decorated with figures of strange cartoon characters and snow globes. Some were clearly magical with figures inside while some where just cheap and cheerful ones from gift shops. There had been no structure to the lessons, mostly they had just sat around and talked before play a game of chess and a strange Japanese game Harry had never heard of but Nino insisted was an ancient game. It was sort of like dominoes but the pieces were circular and there were pictures on them that either lied or told the truth. Harry had a hard time with guessing which was which. Thankfully Draco hadn’t done much better. “But maybe it was because she was tired”
“Yeah, I get that but where am I going to keep them when I have to go back to the Dursleys?” Harry asked as the birds sang a surprisingly beautiful song. As he hadn’t been expecting anything more than cooing Harry had to admit to being shocked by the sound. Hermione looked away from the birds to ask in a surprised tone;
“Yes, we shall only be going for a month or so, barely enough time to see everything but Nino has offered her and her fiancés services as guides. We will be leaving on Saturday, Harry you aren’t looking as excited as Draco…Are you not happy?”
“Yes, I would like that very much” She nodded grateful that the man was prepared to indulge her. He quickly reached into the depths of his robes and pulled out a coin purse. Inside was a small square photo. He handed it to her and Narcissa smiled at the young girl. She was dressed in vibrant colours of yellow and blue that held intricate patterns of flowers. Her black hair was tied into twin braids and she was smiling and blowing kisses around her flower petals were raining down on her.
“Thank-you Harry, if you will keep it until tonight then” Severus gave him a very weak smile that didn’t quite  reach his eyes and Harry wanted to hug him but he didn’t know if his touch would be welcome. He nodded again and slipped the shrunken letter and package back into his pocket and Severus gave a nod of his own. “Very good, you should go back and finish your breakfast, your first lesson with the much talked about Professor Ninomiya, you must be excited”
“I would and Remus…I don’t know him as well as I would like but…You think he is a good man and that is all I need” Harry said certainly in almost the same way his father had done in the will but only in the opposite direction. Severus covered his hand with his own, the long potion stained fingers gentle on his skin his eyes continuing to search his face before he nodded.
“Are you planning on running off and becoming a Pirate, Dray?” Harry asked with a chuckle and Draco shook his head his place face becoming a bright pink.
“Draco? Oh, we met last year, in Hogsmeade, Hadrian and Draco were there with Hadrian’s fathers…Was not good timing, we were meant to be in class.” The twins said taking it in turn to speak as they let out loud laughs. “Bit awkward, but it turned out good…”
“Yes, sir” Harry answered closing his eyes as the man cast a spell. As he had been warned his whole body started to tickle as though he had full body pins and needles. It seemed focused in more areas than others but over all it was a full body thing. As it was happening Tobias made a series of snorts and tuts and Harry had a feeling that if he opened his eyes the grandfatherly man would be shaking his head.
“...He did look really frightened, Fred...” George muttered the anger leaving his eyes as slowly his mind started to understand what Severus was telling him. Fred nodded slowly the Adam’s apple, which was just forming in his throat, bobbing up and down.
“Yes, dear, the Malfoy’s have a small chateaux on the outskirts of the wizarding town we will floo there and then visit the town”
“Harry? Are you okay?” Draco asked swiftly patting him down gently before turning and glaring at the older boys his free hand coming to rest on his hip in a move that was almost an exact replica of Narcissa though the look in his eyes was pure Lucius. “How dare you! Touching somebody without invitation! Of course, from your hair you are Weasley’s, of course you don’t know any better”
“I won’t” Harry answered, but he knew that it was a little bit of a lie. The snake had sounded serious when it had mentioned the Ancient One and a shiver moved quickly down his back. Severus ruffled his hair with long, bony fingers and then together they made their way up the stairs of the temple enclosure to the Quetzalcoatl. It was a beautiful creature with a head the same size and shape of a lion but with scales that had the shape of feathers in bright colours however it just lounged around the branch of a tree singing dirty limericks as it swished its gigantic tail back and forth. Once or twice Harry was sure it looked at him but then let out a hiss of
“Forgive me, I was never as adapt as Cissy in reading aloud. Even when Draco was a baby” He explained but Harry shook his head quickly. Vernon had never read to Dudley, Petunia had though Dudley hated it preferring to watch the TV in his bedroom. Harry liked it, even if he was positive that he was a little old to be read to. After everything that had happened today it was nice to hear about the adventures of Boris the Brave.
“Bleeding ‘Ell this maze is huge!” Seamus panted as they took another wrong turn and ended up in a dead end with yet another clue attached to a statue of a long forgotten Malfoy. Draco had to agree, he was sure that the normal maze was never this long or tricky. Around them they could hear dozens of other children and some adults trying to solve the clues. “Don’t yer know yer way through it?”
“How did it go, Harry?” Draco asked as soon as he entered the dining room and Harry gave a small shrug. He had managed to do everything Chuck had told him, but it had felt clunky and unnatural. His fingers hadn’t moved the way he wanted them too.
“Hadrian, Draco, I trust that Misters Weasley kept you entertained?” Severus hummed his tone quiet and almost chilling, but Harry could see the concern in the black eyes as they searched his face. Harry gave a nod swallowing as the teachers at the table were looking over now.
“Too late for sorry! This means war, Potter!” Draco hissed playfully grabbing his own pillow and hitting out at him. Harry laughed jumping up from the bed and running as he used his pillow as a shield. Draco charged at him and before either of them realised they were in the depths of a full-blown pillow war. They laughed and teased, hid behind furniture and simply tried their hardest to hit each other with the pillows until Harry dropped his and held up his hands in surrender.
Albus Dumbledore swept out of the office in a flurry of garish orange robes causing the door to almost explode in a fit of unrestrained magic. Harry just sighed relaxing against Narcissa before realising that he was still on her lap like an oversized baby. He jumped up awkwardly the brace making his movements unsteady as he apologised with a red face. The beautiful witch smiled shaking her head as she cleaned his face with a silk handkerchief.
Hey guys! Sorry not a chapter! It's been a strange few weeks and I haven't had real time to write but I have a question...
“Because if you use too much Arrow-wart you can end up in a coma, Dad” Harry answered with only a moments hesitation. Severus’ lips curled into a genuine smile as he nodded and turned his attention to Draco who was helping George.
“Your mother kindly invited us. My daughter hasn’t stopped speaking of it since. Her first Samhain party”
“Hedwig St Dumount created the first pepper up potion. It is a good name, Harry, and it suits your bird greatly” Severus gave him a thin-lipped smile adding the chopped ingredients to the cauldron that was bubbling nicely. Harry relaxed and smiled his cheeks flushing a little pink. “What is the use of a bezoar?”
“Dragon, please don’t look so sad” She whispered cupping his cheeks in between her hands and Draco gave a long sigh shaking his head. His fingers brushed over the note against his skin. “Come the ball is starting and we have to be there to meet our guests”
“Mother and Father won’t let you go back to them. No matter what Dumbledore says” Draco said with all the certainty of youth. His parents had never let him down before and they wouldn’t now but he knew that Harry would have to tell them what had happened to him but he knew that he wouldn’t tell adults. Adults had always let him down and didn’t believe him.
“Thank-you sir, I am really very happy that you thought about doing this but...I can’t ask you to show me your memories like this. Not when you don’t really know me, even if they are memories of my mum...” Harry whispered shyly his cheeks glowing a warm red. “Honestly I am genuinely happy and I would like to know about her but...If you would like you could tell me about her yourself, or...Maybe when we’ve gotten to know each other better you could show me them yourself? I don’t know how it works but...”
“The dark lord killed all of the House Elves, Potter, Nagini made short work of them I believe” Draco shuddered violently at the thought. He had never really thought of the elves as anything other than the weird little creatures that served wizards but the thought of them being eaten alive by Voldemort’s serpent was enough to cause a lot of nightmares until he was a very old man.
“If one of you may take the children away with my house elf we will happily explain everything” Narcissa said calmly all of her anger seemed to have gone and the female auror gave a nod to her partner moving forward as Narcissa called for Jinx. Harry gasped loudly as Jinx popped into existence  and Draco tried to reassure him but it all felt rather flat. Everything was happening so quickly he was disappointed that he was being sent away but he could understand why. “Jinx, please take Draco, Harry, and the auror...?”
Ive started posting another draco/harry  story the twelve days of Christmas if you would like to read it
“Lucius!” Narcissa scolded her tone icy and sharp. Physically she may not have changed but Narcissa was no longer the woman she had been in Draco’s youth. She had more confidence to argue with her husband now and knew when to make her feelings known. There had been a time after the war when it was thought that his parents would split however at the end of the day the pair truly did love each other and they powered through.
“But...It is as big as the Dursley’s entire house!” Harry gave another hiss almost falling off the bed and Draco shrugged once again watching as Harry wandered around the room almost tripping over Jinx who had been sitting on the floor near the bed. “Sorry, Jinx”
“No, child, she couldn’t hurt anyone. It was hard seeing her; she looks nothing like the woman I knew though her madness is still very much with her. In fact, I would go so far as to say she is with the madness. There is little Bella left now”
“Draco! To what do we owe the pleasure?” Narcissa said happily as Draco swept into the lounge room both his parents were sitting in. Narcissa rose from her chair to place a kiss on each of his cheeks while Lucius barely looked up from behind the rag of a newspaper he was reading. Both his parents had changed little in looks in the years since the war, but Draco was sure their outlooks had. At least he hoped so.
“Of course, we are only here to look after the best interests of Mr Potter” Her tone reminded Harry of his teachers at school who would tell him that he was just an ungrateful brat before hitting him on the back of his head.
“You are very welcome child, I said no more than the truth, you are family. I will summon Tormuld and ask him to send word to Cissy and Draco, would you like Jinx here also? She will happily take Dumbledore away if he grows too tiresome” A grin spread over Harry’s lips at that and he nodded knowing the elf would happily take Dumbledore to the North Pole if it made Harry happy.
Although a part of their group Lupin was more often than not in the Library when he wasn’t sick and had seemed more friends with Lily than James. The tentative friendship had soured when Severus had fallen in with the wrong crowd and it had been irreparable after he had found the truth. Not because he had anything against Lupin he couldn’t help that he had suffered the curse, but because there had been no punishment for Black. Dumbledore had put it down to youthful ignorance but Severus refused to believe it was anything more than an attempt on his life. Severus was also angry that Lupin didn’t seem to fall out with Black.
“They will pay for every little action they did against you, Harry, I promise be it in the courts or by my hand they will pay” Lucius vowed taking his hand and pulling him into a one armed hug. It was brief but warm and Harry breathed in the warm scent of his shirt before looking up into the man’s face. “Now, come on in, get dressed and then come to breakfast if you are ready. You can help me with my crossword. I hope to beat your father this morning”
“Let them in, Rocky, but take them to the study” Lucius was appeared to be calm but Draco could tell that he was ready for a long battle. “Mr Potter, I’m afraid that we will need you, if you would like to stay here with Draco and Narcissa and myself for a while then I will need you to say that”
“Look, Dad! It’s a baby!” Harry gasped gripping Severus’ arm and pointing to the tiny horse that had pale blue wings not seeing the shocked expression that came over Severus’ face or the happy one that came over Remus at his use of the word Dad.
“Stupid, we will be equals, true partners…In all that…I…Potter…In his will he gave reason…He made it seem that there…Its been ten years since. No doubt what passing fancy you had…”
“Pay attention, Harry, send Lupin an agreement that I will be there with you when you meet him next week, Thursday would be the best day for me, if he doesn’t wish to come here we can meet in Hogsmeade, until we see each other again, read your books” Severus jerked his head and then swept off down the hall leaving Harry to stare at the bellowing robes with a smile.
“Very good, Harry, now to land you want to bring the weight of your body forward and lower your legs. Very good” Lucius repeated his praise and Harry beamed at him proud that he had managed to do something correct. “Now kick up again and begin to circle me, the broom will react to the barest suggestion of will...Yes! That’s it! Very good Harry! It’s as I said you are a natural! Just like your father!”
“Black told me you were waiting for me. I told Dumbledore that he made me believe I would catch him and James up to no good but in truth he left a letter saying that you wanted to see me. I was halfway under the Dark Lord’s spell that when it happened, I allowed myself to fall further. I am sorry for believing you capable of that”
“You know what this is?” He asked showing her the clear liquid that flowed up and down in the small crystal bottle and the transfiguration teacher nodded her eyes narrowing.
“Oh, what do we have here? Malfoy and his mummies bastard” A snide voice snarled, and Harry’s smile fell away swiftly as he felt his insides curl. Behind him was two extremely large boys that he had never seen before. Both appeared to have fallen from the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Their bodies were almost as large as Dudley and they seemed to be at least twice as mean.
“I wish that we could just make him forget, let him be a child. When I was watching him with his friends today, he looked just like a normal ten-year-old…I wish he could always be that way” Remus sighed. Harry was so different to himself and James as children. Although Remus hadn’t met him until they were eleven James never had a care in the world beyond the latest broom and collecting famous witches and wizard cards from chocolate frogs. Their summer days had been spent chasing frogs and collecting frog spawn and teasing each other about crushes.
“Thank-you, mama” Draco’s hand darted forward taking his Godfather’s letter first as it was the slimmest of the two. Inside he found a single sheet of parchment saying;
“Tea is fine” Severus pulled the visitors chair from Lucius desk and set it before him, and Remus almost laughed at the strangeness of it all. Here he was, a former member of the order of the phoenix sitting in Lucius Malfoy’s home drinking tea with Severus Snape, both of whom had been deep supporters of Lord Voldemort. Through the window of the study he could see Harry and Draco practicing on Broomsticks under the watchful eyes of both Narcissa and Lucius.
“I deserve an award. Did you know that Granger didn’t shut up? It was two before she finally stopped talking last night. She kept warbling about Dumbledore and how it wasn’t fair that he was no longer headmaster.” Pansy speared a tomato with a fork with such anger that Harry could only imagine she was thinking about Hermione or perhaps Dumbledore. The mention of the old man made Harry’s insides squirm a little and he was thankful when the topic changed to the break in at Gringotts. The twins were convinced that it was Dobby, who still hadn’t been found after escaping the hospital, and Harry listened with only half an ear looking up at the top table where his dad was talking to Quirrell in a low voice. His expression was unreadable from here and probably even if he was closer but when the man looked up and saw him staring, he gave him a smile. Harry was immediately surprised when pain flashed through his forehead. It was short but sharp causing him to gasp out loudly and almost double over at the force of it.
“Forgive me, Mr Potter-Lupin-Snape” The old man said with a polite bow holding out a wand. Immediately Harry could tell that it was wrong for him. It was a strange feeling, rather like the numb feeling before you got pins and needles and he handed it straight back. Ollivander handed him another and then another with different results but the same outcome. Eventually the old man went into the back and pulled out a rather dusty looking box. “Perhaps you would like to try this one? Holly and Phoenix feather”
“But for you it is?” Draco grumbled before looking at the giant of a wolf who was watching him with Amber eyes “Are you perhaps one of the fairy folk?”
“The Goblins aren’t saying. They didn’t even want to admit it happened, I always thought something really bad would happen if you tried to rob Gringotts, but who ever it was seems to have gotten away with it.” Francis spoke with a mouthful of foam and Harry had to struggle to understand him for some reason his scar gave a tingle, as though a sudden burst of electricity had been passed through it. “But since then the stuff about you and Dumbledore has died down a bit. Honestly, though, don’t let Albright bother you, he’s a good guy really…We’ve been friends since we were in nappies…Just everyone thinks its weird…Harry Potter with the Malfoys…I mean…I don’t…But…Yeah…”
“That’s a good boy, Little Master! Youse is gonna be okay now” It said and Harry had the feeling that the little creature was a female.
ALMOST! Almost moving the plot along! The Dursleys will not be dealt with until First Year of Hogwarts…I know its very unlikely that James would want Snape over Black but it’s just as unlikely that Lucius Malfoy would read bedtime stories and allow Harry to call him Luci xD
“Please, just call me Nino, everyone else does” Nino smiled shaking his hand again before bowing a little more politely at Lucius. “Lord Malfoy, thank-you for hiring me to teach Draco again this year”
“I will start work on the Wolfsbane potion immediately. There is almost a month before the next full moon I should have a batch before then”
“Birds, mate...” Ron muttered a mouthful of bacon as he looked at the tree in front of his friend. His eyes were wide showing his bright blue pupils and Harry frowned looking at the tree again.  It seemed even Ron knew something about the tree when he didn’t. After a moment of searching Harry found it. A small brown bird with gold touches on its beak and wings.
“Yes, Master Lucius, Lady Malfoy would youse liken one too?” Jinx asked but Narcissa shook her head giving her a smile as she joined her husband at the table. Her head lay against his shoulder showing a level of intimacy that they wouldn't normally show to somebody that wasn’t family but, he supposed, Harry was family.
So...In canon it seems that all the teachers have different ideas on the structure of their lessons, there isn’t any rhyme or reason, so this is just Nino’s way.
“A pleasure Heir Black-Potter” The goblin bowed low and then left the office with a click of the door as it closed. Lucius waited for a moment or two and then said carefully;
“Fine, I, James Fleamont, lord of the most noble house of Potter blah blah blah, being of sound mind...”
“My mother left you a letter and a package in her will” Harry whispered carefully holding them out not surprised when the smile faded from Severus’ face and his eyes hardened. His tongue scraped over his thin lips as he eyed the package nervously as though it was going to jump out and strike him. “Uncle Luci shrunk  it yesterday. She said that it was personal items. Um you can...Take it and look at it in private...”
“Um...Thank-you for the presents, I really liked them, the broom is cool, I can’t believe that people can actually fly! It all sounds so cool, um...Yours in friendship, Harry Potter” Draco finished the letter getting the impression that Harry wanted to say more but was worried that he was saying too much. He read the letter a few more times and then looked around his bedroom at the many books that he had dotted around the room deciding that it just wasn’t on that Harry Potter, the boy who lived, didn’t know anything about his world. He got up from the bed and swept out of his bedroom looking for his mother.
“Harry my dear boy, how you’ve gown, you look just like your father” The man said rising from his chair and coming over to him with a quickness Harry hadn’t been expecting given his advanced age. Harry shrunk back away from him and Jinx quickly positioned her body in front of him as she said;
Time marched slowly onwards with summer days giving over to autumn. The leaves in the manor garden changed almost over night from bright green to deep oranges and reds. Harry’s every day was spent in happiness with the Malfoy’s and his two fathers along with his friends. The Weasley twins George and Fred had become constant pen-pals, much to Severus’ dismay, talking about all the things that they had gotten involved in at school and about their brothers and sister. They were a cheerful, mischievous pair, but harmless and Remus told him that they reminded him of his group of friends at school. His best friend, outside of Draco was Pansy, the girl had come to stay for the weekend after her parents’ trip around the world had been cut short. At first, she had been scandalised about who he was and that they hadn’t told her but eventually she had gotten over it.
“Both Mr Weasley’s since your potion is finished and I have no doubt it will be acceptable why don’t you show Hadrian and Draco around instead of distracting my class any further? Please refrain from causing mischief and have my son and god son in the great hall in say an hour?” Severus suggested lightly his face not half as scary as it could have been.
The tense silence continued for a long while as Narcissa comforted the boy in her lap. Her heart broke for the couple that had spoken so freely and joyfully in what must have been the hardest part of their lives. She could remember the insanity of the dark lord when he had declared that he was going after the Potters and she had held Draco a little more tightly for the next month or so. She held Harry just as tightly now her lips pressing into his hair line as she rocked him back and forth. Her fingers gently moved up the spine of the boy her eyes  turning to stare into the blank face of the headmaster. It unnerved her that Dumbledore was so silent and she was almost thankful when he puffed himself up like a puffer fish and snapped;
“Good morning, Dad. Nino…” He said causing the Japanese teacher to let out a sleepy grumble as she tried to smile. Severus gave a small chuckle at her actions and then smiled at him. It wasn’t as wide a smile as Harry had grown used to from the man, but it was filled with warmth and love.
“No, they won’t. Father has the best lawyers Harry! And he has the truth, Dumbledore looks like he has finally cracked and is starting to show that. He drugged a teacher, used an unforgivable and tried to break into your mind. If you hadn’t been practicing with Uncle Sev’ who knows what he might have gotten you to do” Draco gave a mock shudder but in reality he could still imagine what it had been like to watch what was happening but not be able to do anything. He was glad that Harry hadn’t fallen for the tricks Dumbledore was spewing but it must have been hard on the boy. “Everything will be okay, you’ll see, for now just forget about it and think that you are about to go to your first Quidditch game!”
“I have a headache so I can’t deal with your attitude today” She snapped though Harry hadn’t said two words to her all morning. He washed the dishes quickly ignoring Dudley who waddled back and forth from the living room to the kitchen to get snacks and drinks. He kicked out at him a few times but Harry was to distracted by the package hidden in his bedroom to care.
“Harry!” She said happily throwing her arms around him. “How have you been? It’s been ages since I saw you…Um…I guess I should apologise for that night in Romania, I’m sorry”
“Do you think they will let us start real magic straight away? I’ve only practiced a few spells, I’ve read all my books though, I wonder what sort of teacher Ninomiya is? She looks really young. Like she only just graduated. Quirrell looks sick, I’m glad we don’t have muggle studies this year” Chao-Xiang said without pausing for breath her thick Scottish buzzing around the table and Harry swallowed a piece of bacon about to tell her about Nino when a flurry of gasps filled the hall and some students started pointing upwards towards the high windows. Harry turned to look and smiled as he saw the owls flying into the great hall packages and letters attached to most. Harry spotted Hedwig easily against the sea of dark coloured owls and she immediately spotted him and came flying down followed by Draco’s owl who had a package tied to his foot. Hedwig had a small parcel, a letter, and a similar package to Draco’s. Harry recognised the messy scrawl on the top of the small parcel as belonging to Chuck and he took it first carefully untying the twine around it. The brown paper fell open to show a leather-bound book with a guitar etched into the front. He smiled tracing the pattern lightly before opening it up and found that the pages were all music sheets aside from the first which had more of Chuck’s scrawl on it.
“We will take you there, Harry, I promise” She said while Draco nodded happily “But for today, we have appointments to keep and places to be”
“Just about half an hour, though I admit I spent my time in the cafe over there. They do the most wonderful salted caramel drink. You should try it."
“Wrong! They are a Colly Bird! They are related to the black bird but...Harry these are super rare” Hermione hissed with all the excitement of a child on Christmas morning and Ron looked at his girlfriend with a genuinely surprised look on his face while Harry asked in confusion;
“In much the same way Muggles believe Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit you have to have a little bit of faith” Remus chuckled with a shrug taking a sip of his wine glass his engagement ring shining in the soft candle light. “Whatever the case, he was an incredibly powerful wizard just as his younger sister Gwenddydd was a powerful witch though not as well known. She was born of Merlin’s mother but had a human father. She married a northern king, Yaris Ravenclaw, and her daughter was one of the founders of Hogwarts. But we can talk about all of this in our next lesson, Harry”
!” Agnus and the third hissed together and Harry was sure that they would be rolling their eyes. He gave a chuckle that he couldn’t hide under his hand and then flushed as three snake heads turned to look at him with interest. Only Josephine didn’t seem to look.
“I saw! You’re amazing, Draco!” Harry laughed wincing as his friend pressed against the brace spell before realising.
“You look very much like your grandmother, the Black hair and the gentle features about your mouth and nose. I was your families healer for many years, in fact I was there at your birth” Tobias told him and Harry swallowed thickly not knowing how to respond. “It is good to see you once more”
“Oh, he told me to come several hours ago, I came in my own time” Severus said moving to sit in the chair next to Draco a wine glass immediately filling with a ruby red wine. “Not for Dumbledore I ask this but for myself, what are you playing at?! Taking Potter’s brat!”
“We have both made mistakes, Severus, we have both lost ourselves over the years, but through Harry perhaps we can find ourselves and be like we were meant to be” Remus sucked as much courage as he could into himself and then reached over the small table to cover the potion stained fingers with his own. “Will you allow us to try, Severus?”
“See? Harry, you’re new to having Parents, you base your reactions on Draco and he is a little strange for being so open about Lucius and Narcissa and then you remembered what you heard and when you thought it was gross to think about us you assumed you were like those muggles. But you aren’t. Now, why don’t you try not avoiding us and not thinking about us…In that way?” Severus gave a tight smile his cheeks a lot redder than Harry had realised and the boy realised how uncomfortable Severus was having this conversation. The fact that he had though made Harry love his adoptive parents all the more.
“Dumbledork tried to keep it pretty well hidden. Refused to let it be read. When father requested Harry’s key because the ministry wanted to check if there was a will he said that he had lost Harry’s key. The Goblins were very angry, which only got worse when Dumble-dweeb said that the will had been tampered with because Lily said that Dumble-dunce wasn’t allowed anywhere near Harry” Draco told Lupin happily his eyes sparkling as he used three stupid nicknames for Dumbledore. The names made Harry giggle ever so slightly but he was watching Lupin’s face waiting for his reaction surprised when he let out a laugh and whispered;
“They are. A strange mix of stag and bird, they came from Atlantis. They are shy creatures for the most part, but they were known for helping the stranded witch or wizard out of the forest if they asked politely. Or perhaps I am being romantic again, Sevvie?”
“And the Malfoy’s, they are my family as well, and you Pans. You’re like the sister I never knew I wanted.”
They were shown to a tiny room that looked like it had been used for storage and had only just been cleaned out. It was dirty, cramped and there were stains that Narcissa didn’t even want to think about covering the floor. A chair had been placed in the centre of the room and Narcissa wasn’t sure if that was for her or her sister, but she wasn’t planning on using it. Her nerves fluttered around like a swarm of terrified butterflies and her hand went to the locket she was currently wearing. It was embossed with two butterflies and when opened had two photos. One of Draco and the other of Harry. The knowledge that she was doing for Harry kept her from physically throwing up what little she had managed to eat for breakfast that morning. Kingsley’s steady presence was calming but Dobble was starting to irritate her, she needed him to leave so they could perform the next part of their plan.
“Forgive me, Mr Black-Potter, you will both be joining us at Hogwarts next year, yes? I look forward to teaching you both”
“Dad loves potions, he has never wanted to do anything else” Harry hummed smiling gratefully as Draco filled his plate for him and poured him a pumpkin juice. It was a lie, at least a little one, Snape did want to do something else. He wanted to run his own potions shop on Diagon Alley and find a cure for Werewolf-ism, but he needed money for dreams like that and he had pride he wouldn’t accept handouts.
“And no matter how long you take you will always look like a ferret…Or perhaps a weasel with a blond fringe.”
“Correction! We were at school! But your dad busted us out and here we are!” Draco and Harry turned quickly as the two red haired twins burst into the summer house wearing matching jumpers and scarfs looking so excited it was possible that they were going to burst. Jinx who had shown them in was looking a little flustered and Draco could only imagine how shocked the elf was that Malfoy manor was playing host to two Weasley’s “Still can’t believe it, right Gred? Snape himself busting us out of school to go to a Quidditch match and not just a Quidditch match the Honeysuckle Hummingbirds!”
“Yeah, I’m continuing my guitar lessons on Saturdays” Harry answered turning his attention to the letter he had been given. It was written in neat copperplate handwriting and he immediately recognised it as being from Gringotts. It wasn’t his monthly statement however as that came at the end of the month, so he tore it open carefully to find a typed letter inside.
He hadn’t known the significance of what had happened until later, when he realised that his body and his fox didn’t react to any of the other omegas or even betas that were around the palace. As he grew it got worse to the point that if an omega, he wasn’t attached to came up to him he would almost gag on the feeling of his fox trying to get away. A frantic search in the large city library told him what was wrong, he had scent bonded with the strange omega in the woods and his fox would never truly be able to accept another. There were ways of forcing a connection with another shifter, but it was never stable and there was a very real chance that he could end up rejecting any and all children his partner bore or worse killing them. As much as he tried to tell his fox that he would never get the mate it desired no shifter could truly fight a scent match.
The Ravenclaw table was silent as Harry and Draco sat down and Harry could feel the overwhelming pressure of peoples’ eyes on him. He smiled weakly at a few of the people closest to him and then looked over at the head table. Severus was looking over at him his eyes warm and a faint smile playing around on his thin lips as Nino chatted happily away on his left and the man in the turban sat pale faced and silent on his right.
“You don’t need to apologise…” Draco sighed rolling onto his side now and lightly running his finger over his forehead avoiding the scar which still looked a little swollen and red. Harry sighed happily at the touch feeling rather like a spoilt kitten. He had discovered that he liked being touched and craved it. After years of only getting beatings a gentle touch was something wonderful for him.
“Yes, they live by the banks of rivers, like the Grindylows they like to pull the unsuspecting traveller into the rivers. But a little politeness goes a long way. If you see a Kappa you bow to it. You see the top of his head? When on land the bowl is filled with water which must remain on its head for it to stay hydrated. If you bow to a Kappa it will always bow back and the water will fall from the bowl. Now, when you have done so you have the advantage and you can then runaway” Remus told him gently his face glowing with excitement as a creature with the head and upper torso of a horse and the tail of a sea serpent swam passed the glass. It was beautiful, if a little eerie, and Harry gasped in delight.
“Dear Harry, I am very glad that my birthday gift reached you safely and that you enjoy the gifts. I admit I was surprised when you said you knew nothing about our world. I have never lived with muggles (Non-wizarding people) do they all hate magic? I had thought they didn’t know about us” Draco wrote and Harry gave a snort deciding that it was only his aunt and uncle that hated magic. He had always thought it strange but now he suspected that they knew he was a wizard and the insults were just another way of putting him don. “I have sent some of my old books for you, a book of potions, one of charms, a history of magic in Britain, and several old volumes of Quidditch monthly” Harry gasped looking at the package resting on the arm of the chair honestly not expecting anything more but wanting to read more about Quidditch. “My mother informs me your father was a keen Quidditch player when he was in Hogwarts, he played chaser I believe, though people thought he should try for seeker. I do hope that you will write again, you will make a refreshing change from my friend Pansy who believes that everyone should be as excited as her about dresses as if they make her look any less like a pug in a wig. Hoping to hear from you again soon, Draco Malfoy”
“I dunno, I’ve never seen a fairy, I wouldn’t know what they looked like. Plus, you have a pet wolf enchanted”
“She is a house elf, they act as servants to some wizarding families” Draco answered while the auror was munching on a rainbow biscuit. She gave a nod a few crumbs escaping as she did so. “Jinx acted as my Nanny elf she loves fussing over people”
“Who knows? Who cares?” Draco mumbled with a careless shrug. “I am sure Hogwarts will survive with one less Weasley.”
Lucius lay the letter down in the space between himself and Narcissa on the bed. He was not a man given over to outwardly displays of emotion. The last time he had cried was when Narcissa had lost the last child she had wanted so very much but right now his eyes were itching with something akin to tears and his heart was breaking for the young Potter lord. It was not a letter he was expecting from the man who had never seemed to take anything even remotely serious but it was a letter that touched him. Narcissa was silent her eyes wet but she was composed as ever.
“Remus and Severus will be having sex” Draco announced suddenly as they sat on the bed together and Harry almost choked on the warm milk, he had been drinking his eyes nearly bulging out of his head. Wiping his milk moustache on the back of his hand Harry stared at his friend refusing to let his mind bring up such images.
“That is something only romantics and poachers believe, Lupin, the feathers of a Pegasus are fragile and not much use in anything. There is only one potion where they will work and that is to soothe colic in babies” Severus said drily his eyes rolling in a fond way “If you are to be writing a book on magical creatures be sure to get it correct”
“They are so in love its gross!” Pansy cooed as they left and the twins nodded shuddering, there was really some things that you didn’t want to see your teacher like.
“Wese is sorry about thats Little Master Harry! Please donna judges all by Dobby’s behaviours” Figgin one of the kitchen elves said happily coming over with sandwiches and cakes clearly thinking that Harry was too thin. House elves were always conscious of their Masters needs and wants and Draco wouldn’t be surprised if there were some nutrient potions mixed into the ones Figgin was pushing towards him. “It’s okay, I hope that he’s okay” Harry said softly taking a bite of one of the beef sandwiches and Figgin gave a look over to the corner where Dobby was now sleeping under the tablecloth. His scrawny chest was lifting and falling a steady way and the Kitchen Elf gave a sniff that reminded Draco of his old aunt Tabitha who he had suffered constantly during Yule. Thankfully she lived in France for the rest of the year or his cheeks would be constantly covered in ruby red lipstick.
By the time the dessert trolley was being floated around Harry was full to bursting. He shook his head at the kindly waiter with a thin moustache and beard and sat waiting for everyone else to finish. Thesidious Parkinson was unlike any man that Harry had ever known before, he was lively and jolly constantly gossiping about people that Harry didn’t know. Unlike his aunt there was nothing cold or cruel about his gossiping but it was rather amusing whenever he looked around the private room they were in before leaning his rather broad body over the table with his hand against his mouth whispering;
“I never touched him, nor would I throw mud. Your...Child, threw mud at young Mr Potter, it is hardly my fault if instead he hit himself. Now madam, as I am assuming you are Mr Potter's aunt you are unfortunately the woman I want to speak with. We can do so here on the street or we can step inside" As Lucius spoke Harry saw him sliding out the smaller ornate looking stick from his cane. Petunia saw it as well and her irate face paled and fear filled her eyes. It told Harry that his aunt knew that he was a wizard and that he was also. Anger bubbled inside of him but he squished it down waiting to see what would happen next.
“You haven’t had one in a while, Harry, was it the Dursley’s?” Draco asked with pure concern in his pale face and Harry shook his head slowly biting on his lip for just a moment. He opened his mouth to explain the dream but realised that it had faded away. He couldn’t remember a single thing about it.
“I remember, she is giving us History of World Magic lessons” Harry grinned that warm happy feeling spreading to his heart. He felt guilty that he was such a hassle to his friend, but Draco never seemed to think of it like that.
“Oh I’d love a hot chocolate as well if you don’t mind” Hestia said her eyes still moving around the home as the twin doors opened and they entered a huge welcoming hallway that very much reminded Harry of the big house he school at taken his class too. The walls were lined with huge life sized paintings of people who looked a lot like Draco with blonde hair and grey eyes. They were all posed with stiff backs their hands regally resting on the heads of statues.
“Ssh, it’s okay, Harry” Draco said sounding almost panicked himself as his arms wrapped around his skinny frame in a nervous sort of hug. “My mother has always wanted more children. She and father tried often after having me they never caught with child again however and when they went to the mediwitch about it they found that my mother no longer has the ability to carry or even produce children. It was a curse, an old family curse put on her by another pure blood family” As Draco spoke Harry found himself slowly calming down enough that he could move out of the hug and look at his friend. The boy’s normally pale face was even more pale but his eyes were serious and focused. Already long graceful fingers moved down the side of his cheek in the same calming way Narcissa’s had the day before and Harry let out a breath his heart lulled into the same beats as Draco’s. “The greatest wish of Lady Malfoy will always be denied. My mother longed for more children that was her greatest wish so of course the curse made her barren”
“It will be an honour sirs! Jinxes will watchen over little Master Harry!” The house elf said beaming with all her might. Jinx was a personal favourite of Severus’ she was brighter than most of her kind, loyal to the Malfoy’s and took pride in her work. Many thought the elves at Hogwarts were the happiest but they had never met the Malfoy elves. “Good days, sirs!”
“What was that about?” Draco asked nudging him on the arm while the twins bid them goodbye and headed over to the table where Lee Jorden was sitting along with another red-haired boy who immediately seemed to start lecturing the twins.
“Uncle Sev’ I would be extremely happy if you would want to blood adopt me” Harry said gently moving over to the man and placing a hand on his arm. Severus looked at him through the curtains of his hair his eyes, dark and unfathomable. “But I can understand if you wouldn’t want that”
The parchment opened as he broke the wax seal and it was covered with more of the Goblin’s swirling handwriting;
Today was the twelfth day and it was the only one that they hadn’t woken to gifts laid out on the bed but there was a large colourful stocking filled to the brim with sweets and decorated fruits. Draco didn’t seem overly surprised by this mumbling,
Later that morning after breakfast both boys entered the study where Nino was waiting for them. She was dressed in a butter yellow kimono style robe with her hair tied up away from her face in a bun. She gave them both a smile and motioned for them to sit down at the desks.
“Yes, Master Lucius!” The elf said before lifting a long finger and beckoning for the auror to follow which she did after giving a clumsy attempt at a smart bow.
“Yup, its that thing you and I do so well, though she wasn’t asking me why I threw a game, she was threatening to hex my balls off” Harry laughed at the statement moaning louder as Draco found a tight painful not in the middle of his shoulder blades and stared to work it out with his fingers. His skin felt amazing and the sponge was forgotten as he moved over him all over. “Why?”
“Harry dear...Please, do not distress yourself, nobody in this house will never hurt you” Narcissa purred getting up out of her chair and approaching him very slowly. She stopped every so often, like one would when trying to coax in a frightened stray cat, but eventually she was on her knees at his side. Her hand lifted as though she was about to touch him but then thought better of it. Instead she sat down beside him with her back resting against the wall making sure she was in his eyesight but far enough away that she didn’t startle him. “I do not know what you have been through, my dear, I could not even begin to imagine but I promise you on my magic I nor anyone else in this house will ever hurt you” As she whispered that she held up her wand and flicked it once. A vine sprang from the wand and then moved down her arm twisting and wrapping there in the form of a Celtic knot. “This is a promise knot, it is almost as strong as an unbreakable vow, should anybody harm you this knot will burn and I will lose all my magic and become a squib...”
Standing in Mrs Figg’s cluttered kitchen Harry stared at the boy who had been writing to him and giving him gifts. He was nothing like he had pictured in his mind while reading the letters and Harry felt uncomfortably nervous feeling almost as though he was being stared at by one of Dudley’s friends though none of Dudley’s gang were as beautiful as the boy in front of him. Draco looked like one of the angels from Aunt Petunia’s Christmas decorations with hair so blonde it was almost white. His eyebrows were also blonde while his eyes were a steel grey. He was dressed in clothes that seemed to be more expensive than anything the Dursley’s owned and Harry pulled at his over sized t-shirt feeling almost like he was about to be called a tramp.
Seamus was fun. Rough around the edges like the twins and had a habit of swearing rather loudly while his mother kept hitting him gently with spells from her wand as she talked to Nino and Sho.
“Yes, she has made it known that she doesn’t believe a word against Dumbledore, sadly she isn’t the only one. She is however one of the best herbology teachers in the country, if not the world, so it is unfortunately almost impossible to remove her from her post.” Severus informed the boys knowing that Lucius would try if needs be but removing too many of what people considered to be light wizards from the school would prove to the more narrow minded that the Malfoy’s were trying to turn the youth into Death Eaters. “Though if she does anything that may endanger you that would be another story.”
“Then you should write to him, I am positive that Lupin would like to hear from you” Severus said and though he was trying to stay calm Harry had a feeling that he was very tense talking about the man Lupin.
Omg! I am so sorry for the long delay between the parts, I promise that future updates will be quicker. I can give a list of reasons but the main one is simply my mental health has been rock bottom at the moment but I am pulling it back.
“Kazal. He said that the ancient one would like me but wouldn’t tell me who the ancient one was. Then he shooed me away” Harry admitted lowering his voice as more people came into the snake temple. Some pushed into him trying to see into the glass where he was standing, and Harry moved quickly half expecting the sharp feeling of elbows and hits. They didn’t come, even young children were politer than Dudley, but he was still prepared for them, more so since Severus was just wordlessly staring at him.
“I was thinking about that too, it is awesome right!” Draco hummed grinning from ear to ear and Harry gave him a small smile rubbing his cheek against his pillow before asking;
“I’m perfectly fine, I will just sit in the library this afternoon though. How did your lesson go Harry?” He asked and Harry repeated what he had just told Draco.
“You would never embarrass me, you’re my fairy from the forbidden forest” He said ignoring the awws from those that were closest to them and overheard his confession. Harry grinned his eyes brighter in the lights of the ballroom as he admitted
“Harry the next dark lord? How stupid does he think people are? Harry is the sweetest thing!” Draco asked his hand slipping around Harry’s as he snorted out a laugh. Harry gave his friend a smile squeezing at his hand while Severus asked
“We shall have to take the hotel long distance floo, we don’t have time to make it back to the château, sorry Pansy dear, you will see Harry again I’m sure”
“Okay! Put that stuff away, Sho, now the boys are here we can start the lesson!” She announced clapping her hands together with glee and Harry thought that if he were being looked at the way Sho was he would feel nervous. Sho on the other hand seemed exasperated but fond as he shook his head and magicked away the papers he had been looking through.
“No, perhaps...Perhaps...I...If may, tonight I will return tonight and we can open it together?” Severus asked his tone so light Harry had to strain to hear it and Harry gave a nod recognising the plea in the man’s voice. He wanted to know what Lily had said but he was terrified. Harry still didn’t know what had happened between his mother and Severus but whatever it was he didn’t think it was something that she wouldn’t forgive him for. Everyone made mistakes after all.
“And you’re not, Harry you are so grown-up in so many ways. You understand more about life than many of your peers ever will, but you are a still a child and sometimes things that aren’t ordinary are scary and confusing more so when so many people are telling you something is wrong” Severus told him seriously, his tone was as annoyingly gentle as it had been the whole time he had been talking and a small part of him wished he would be angry. “It is very much the same in the Wizarding world, not with homosexuality or race, but pure-blood, half-blood, muggle born…And creature status” Severus’ eyes moved to Remus and Remus gave him a small smile and Harry realised that the look didn’t disturb him as much as it would have done. “It isn’t right and you shouldn’t just accept it as the status-quo and not want to change it however, you are ten-years-old, you have had the weight of the world on your shoulders for so long that, for now, I don’t want you to worry about the rest of the world. I want you to worry about you, I want you to be a child. Forget everything you have heard about Homosexuals, when you look at us, what do you feel about us?”
“Dad and Pop think, I will be in Ravenclaw” Harry muttered flushing just a little not wanting to offend the ghost by not being in his house or something. Again, Nick didn’t seem to mind smiling broadly as he nodded with his slightly wobbly head.
“Mrs Figg has agreed to talk to the aurors on Harry’s behalf and tell them that Dumbledore dismissed the concerns she raised about the Dursley’s treatment of Harry, she has saved letters that he wrote which stated that it was needed that Harry stay with those muggles no matter what...” Narcissa stopped talking but Draco saw a muscle pulse in her lower lip telling him that there was more to the story but she wasn’t going to say while Harry was there.
“Lord Potter too, he may not have been as bright as his good lady but he had some sense” Severus opened his mouth to protest but instead Lucius handed him over a letter that was yellowed with age. The messy, almost illegible script of his childhood tormentor stared up at him and he wanted to throw it back at his friend but morbid curiosity kept him reading. A clock ticked steadily as Lucius ate his bacon and eggs and, although he would deny it to his death bed, Severus had to swallow a lump from the back of his throat as his eyes moved over the last line. “He was a child Severus, a spoiled rich kid whom had been doted on, we know how they can be...What he did to you was awful, but he has paid the ultimate pric...”
“And you Professor, Dad has told me a lot about you.” Harry said managing to rein in his emotions and sound collected and proper in the way the Malfoy’s had taught him. It was okay to be nervous and even scared but never let anyone see it. Severus had spoken of the Professor a few times while they had been working on the potions and Remus had mentioned her even more, though his tales were mostly of her catching him and his father and their friends out of the dorm after curfew. “And Pops”
“Yes, because that’s what happens when you were following me, well…I wish I had known this information back in school”
“Severus Snape’s private office, Hogwarts” Severus called out in a deep and calm voice and then threw the powder down around them. There was a woosh and Harry closed his eyes as they were pulled through the fireplace. He was glad of Severus’ protective arm around him, but it did little to ease the sickly feeling that collected in his stomach and he was glad when he was thrown out the other side. Severus kept him standing and moved him away from the fireplace while stroking his back gently. “Still not a fan of floo travel Harry?”
“Lupin sent me a letter this morning, he wants to come and see me” Harry admitted noticing that Severus stiffened just a little bit. It wasn’t enough that he would have been able to notice if he hadn’t gotten to know him as well as he had in the last week. There was something easy about being with Severus that Harry liked he was quiet and easy and seemed to know more than anyone what he was going through. He never said anything when his hands shook or he flinched at sudden movements or loud noises.
“Yer dad is Severus Snape?” Bridget asked sounding shocked from where she was talking to the other adults. Harry nodded swallowing down a lump of nerves feeling like shrinking under her surprised gaze, but he refused to allow her to look at him like that. Severus had warned him that there would be many people who didn’t approve of him as the child of a death eater, but Harry didn’t care. He loved his dad and Remus and he was proud to be their son.
“Well there are the four seasons. Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter, correct? Well each season is said to be run by four deities. The winter witch, the Summer King, the Spring Bride, and the autumn knight. The story goes that the winter witch, was an old crone, her hair grey and her skin wrinkled she believed herself to be in love with the Summer King, the king who only had eyes for his spring bride. The bride was beautiful, young and full of life, with black hair and eyes of emerald. They say that when she laughs spring flowers bloom. So of course, the winter witch, was very jealous of the bride and decided to follow her. The spring bride drank from a spring on the island of Orkney in Scotland” Remus hummed in a soft way that suggested he was trying to remember a story he had heard a long time ago and Harry wondered if maybe his pops’ grandparents had told him the story. Harry knew that Remus’ parents had loved him a great deal. They had done everything they could even when he had been changed, but it hadn’t been easy, and they had died young. “An old beggar man who lived on the island told the witch that the well was the reason the bride was so young and beautiful and that if the witch wanted to be so then she would need to be the first to drink from the spring on the first day of Spring the next year. The witch did as she was told and true enough her skin became fair, her hair became golden, the years of age fell from her. The Spring Bride aged rapidly her looks fading. The earth was covered in an unending winter the power of the Spring bride having faded. The witch was sure that the summer king would love her now and so she went taking the spring bride with her to show him how ‘Ugly’ she had become.
“Oh yeah, great uncle Horologium, he does that a lot the real trick is getting him to shut up” Draco muttered in bored sounding voice his grey eyes rolling and Harry blinked about to speak and say that paintings didn’t move or talk when the knight removed his helmet to reveal bright blonde hair that had been pushed into a style that almost matched his helmet saying;
“And I would rather hear you, please continue…” Narcissa opened the book where it had been saved by a magic marker and held it to him. Lucius was too polite to roll his eyes or smirk but Harry could sense it and he smiled into his bed covers as once again Lucius started reading his deep baritone washing over him in waves. The sound of Lucius speaking and the warmth of Draco settled beside him made him drift easily to sleep were he dreamt of talking Bats.
Harry laughed reaching up to touch his hair. After a week with the Malfoys his hair was softer than ever and had started to take on a natural curl that although not as tame as Draco’s was no the less no longer like a birds nest and he was rather fond of his hair now and the way it curled about his face.  “Go back to your breakfast brat, I will see you tonight”
“Yes, but that is because he is an idiot, I am not. I have been developing a similar potion myself and I believe that it will work, however I have not had a werewolf to test it on”
“I went because Bella was the most trusted of the Dark Lord” She answered slowly taking a few calming breaths to be able to get the words out. “She, more than anyone else alive, she would know secrets that no other would. I was not wrong. Bella knew a secret and she shared it with me”
So! My laptop is fixed! Finally! So now I can get back on track and actually write and post! Harry is getting better with his nerves but from my own experience it isn’t gonna happen overnight.
“Yeah, more awake at least” Harry answered looking at the owl which had moved shoulder and had settled onto the windowsill. “What would you name an owl?”
At the feeling on him relaxing Draco started to move pulling out before pushing in again. It was slow at first, almost torturous but then he started moving faster and harder and Harry ignored everything but the feeling of it. They spoke, he was sure of that, but it was babbles, incoherent and unimportant. Draco fucked with the power and passion he fought with and Harry loved every movement and moment of it. When the blond angled his hips in a certain way he hit something inside that was both numbing and so pleasurable that he couldn’t stop himself from letting out an almost scream.
“You would let me test it?” Remus gasped staring at the man who was staring down at an ant on the floor as if it was the most interesting thing he had ever seen. A faint trace of red was in his cheeks however and Remus felt like smiling.
“Yo, Harry! You ready…Woah you’re looking beautiful” George and Fred said together as they came into his room. The twins had been his guard since that first day he had met them, and he found them both delightfully mischievous. They loved to play pranks, but it was always harmless fun. “Are you sure you want to marry the prince? Old Mouldy shorts is dead now! Why don’t you marry us instead?”
“Whatever shall we do? we can’t have the hero of the wizarding world be seen like this” Draco hummed coming into the shop half a minute later. "I’m surprised it hasn’t already caused a riot"
“Oh you may not think I’m pretty, but don’t judge on what you see. I’ll eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me. You can keep your bowlers black, your top hats sleek and tall, For I am the Hogwarts sorting hat and I can cap them all. There’s nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat can’t see. So try me on and I will tell you where you ought to be. You might belong in Gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart, their daring, nerve and chivalry set Gryffindor apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff where they are just and loyal. Those patient Hufflepuffs are true and unafraid of toil. Or yet in Ravenclaw if you’ve a ready mind, where the those of wit and learning will always find their kind. Or perhaps in Slytherin, you’ll make your real friends, those cunning fold use any means to achieve their ends. So put me on! Don’t be afraid! And don’t get in a flap! You’re in safe hands (Though I have none) for I am a thinking cap!”
“Is he okay?” Harry asked and Draco gave a shrug sitting down at the table and motioning for Harry to do the same.
“Pops and I had to track Dad through the maze once when we were having family day. I remembered” Harry answered with a shrug guiding them back from the dead end and leading them through another opening that they had missed minutes before. “The maze also helps me learn Legilimency and Occlumency. Dad makes me picture it when I’m learning, so I can learn to confuse people that might be trying to read my mind”
“They won’t. I’m not going to say that Dumbledore won’t try, because we know that would be a lie, but mother and father will make sure that you can stay. So please don’t worry about that” Draco tried to sound certain but he knew that there were going to be many challenges. He wasn’t so innocent that he didn’t know what people thought of his family or more accurately his father. Lucius had joined the Dark Lord willingly, no matter how disillusioned he had become with the man’s ideals there was no doubt Lucius had done things he wasn’t proud and those on Dumbledore’s side would use that against them but Draco was certain that his father would be able to convince them. They couldn’t send the boy who lived back to those muggles who had hurt him. “Have your drink! You will like butter beer almost as much as Jinx’s hot chocolate”
“Who is the ancient one?” Harry asked the brightly coloured snake who gave a snake like shrug if that were possible before looking smug as it slithered closer to the glass again. Its body was beautiful in the lights of the cage shimmering like the rainbow it was named after.
“Yes. It is more common than not in Japan, she taught Harry and myself to cast spells wandlessly last year” Draco hummed with a shrug waving his own hand and making his books, quills, and ink float to the table. Harry smiled and copied, embarrassed when his ink very nearly dropped onto the table instead of floating gracefully down like Draco’s.
“Sev’ was worried that if we changed the spell it might make the adoption fail and he wanted everything to go correctly” Remus explained his eyes very fond now clearly not embarrassed at being called the mother.
“Harry?” Draco whispered in disbelief half convinced that he was mistaken. Harry was only a few months younger than he was and yet the pale black haired boy in front of him barely looked to be older than seven years. The clothes he was wearing were four times the size of the boy and stretched out of all shape and style. His unnervingly green eyes widened as Draco stepped out from behind his mother his lips parting in a gasp.
“Hem hem, may I make copies of these?” Umbridge asked looing for all the world as though all her birthdays and Christmases had come bound together in one neat little bundle.
“Severus! You will hold your tongue! You of all people...” To every ones’ surprise Lucius roared his wand appearing in his hand so fast it was as though it had always been there and like Petunia and Vernon Severus’ mouth was sealed shut. “The sins of the father are not the sins of the child! He is naught but a child! They had him in a cupboard, they have beat and starved him, you of all people...You doubt my word? You are a skilled legilimens, I offer no resistance see what I saw and if you cannot see passed the loathing you have for the boy's father I will ask you to leave my home”
He smiled happily even as his alarm went off informing him, he needed to take out the Elder root from the potion bath so he could start fashioning a new wand. His dream completely forgotten in favour of the warm happy feeling Harry’s letter had given him made him get out of bed with a spring in his step. He was even humming as he went into his large wardrobe and picked out his robes for the day. The charmed, or perhaps haunted, mirror moaned loudly trying to talk to him about not being so cheerful in the mornings, but Draco ignored it and sang a little louder remembering his favourite song from Le nozze di Figaro.
“What? You think Professor Snape lives in his supplies closet and doesn’t have a life beyond Hogwarts?” Fred scoffed loudly turning to his classmates while George nodded along adding “Keep yer bleeding noses to yourselves”
The case against Dumbledore was heating up, Lucius was practically humming like a hummingbird every evening as he told them how the council was turning on him and how even the courts, which had been afraid of getting involved with the wizard who took down Grindelwald, was now beginning to agree that there was a case. Overall, everything was looking up and Harry was positive that he had never been happier so he was extremely surprised when he woke up to the extreme feeling of being cold all over and his head burning like never before. His screams echoed around the large bedroom disturbing both Hedwig and Draco and he was positive that his heart was trying to force its way out of his mouth. He panted heavily tears in his eyes as he gripped the bedsheets.
“Never! I am sorry for my reaction and for how it made you feel. You must understand the last time I heard somebody speak like that, it was not pleasant” Severus spoke carefully but thankfully the small groups that had been with them had gone seeing that there were no snakes around. “Knowing that it is you, my son, I think I will enjoy it and as Rem said think of all the things we can learn. Your gift is rare, but it is a gift and you should celebrate it. We cannot talk well here, Harry, let us enjoy the rest of our outing and then we can talk about it when we return home. There is a chance that Lucius may know of this ancient one the snake spoke of, but like Rem I think the snake was just being dramatic on purpose do not let it trouble you”
“Forgive me, Lord Malfoy, it is more commonly a muggle complaint. It is a deformity of the bone due to a lack of Vitamin D, it explains the shortness and the curve of his legs. I shouldn’t wonder if Harry also suffers with a great many toothaches” The healer mumble and Harry remembered the way the dentist the school made them go to would screech about his mouth and the cavities he had. She would jab a large metal spike into them and tell him he was lazy for not brushing his teeth. Once he had had to have a tooth removed and it was as though she had taken great delight in pulling it from his mouth.
“Yes, Aunty Cissa” Harry answered and Narcissa dropped a kiss onto his forehead looking relieved as she saw the truth in his eyes.
“And Draco lives in Hogsmeade now” Luna said knowingly tucking a strand of loose dirty blonde hair behind her ear and showing off a baby carrot earing.  Harry let out a laugh, his friend had been encouraging his relationship with Draco for years now and Harry could tell that she knew what he had asked Draco already. “You and he will make a good pairing, Harry.  You have always been drawn to each other and all your lovers have always been blonde. I’m glad you’ve asked him out.”
“That is why I came, Lucius. The locator spell signalled. Albus Dumbledore you are under arrest” Kingsley said his gravelly voice betraying none of the irritation he was obviously feeling. Kingsley had always respected the headmaster of Hogwarts and when he had first came to the ministry claiming that the Malfoy’s had kidnapped and bewitched the boy he had been prepared to believe it. After all Dumbledore was the beacon of light in the wizarding world while Lucius Malfoy was as good as lord Voldemort to some people. However, seeing the family together, the way Lucius genuinely cared for the boy and only wanted what was best for him proved Dumbledore wrong. The case Lucius was building against Dumbledore was making him seem like an old fool and this was just another nail in the coffin.
“He’s Harry Potter! He is the most famous boy in the wizarding world!” Another of his new dormmates said jabbing the Muggleborn in the side with an elbow.
“Testing, testing, a one, a one, two, three…Okay, I guess it’s working and I’m sure you’re already rolling your eyes and telling me to get on with it” James’ voice came through loud and clear and Harry looked at Remus who was indeed rolling his eyes. “So, I’m brown bread, dead, god I hope it was something cool and not getting caught up in one of Sirius’ schemes…Okay, I know that I was just as involved with those schemes but…Cool and Heroic I hope they lined the streets for miles crying as they held my coffin”
“I’ll remind you that I am younger than you are Sevvie” Remus snorted, and Harry had to hide his own laugh by his hand.
“Shall we head to the summer house?” Nino asked with a smile after breakfast was finished and the support brace spell was once again fixed on Harry. As the healer had instructed over the weekend the brace was tighter today and seemed to twist in his left leg and all he wanted to do was cry but he didn’t want to embarrass himself in front of the teacher from Japan.
“Youse is not to comen too closes to Little Master Harry! Mister Dumbles of Hoggywarts! Master Harry is very frighten”
“I’m fine, it just feels a little strange” Harry admitted breathlessly trying to walk but it was too much. Draco, in a fit of accidental magic summoned a chair and had him sit down. “Draco...”
Narcissa was in her nursery tending to a rather beautiful but deadly Angel’s trumpet plant. It was useful in many potions but it was deadly poison if used incorrectly. Narcissa’s beautiful hair was tied up into a butterfly clip which fluttered every so often as she worked.
“Draco…He told me…When we were in France…I…I told him…I told him I can talk to snakes…” Harry whispered as soon as he saw that they were alone. “He said…He said that only Vol…Um…You know who could talk to them…”
“Of course, my boy, but hurry! The first of the betrothal balls is only a few days away and we have so much to cover!” Dumbledore grinned and Harry nodded swallowing down the thick lump from the back of his throat before hurrying back out of the cottage and running nonstop to the edge of the forest. He whistled to Moony and the wolf was soon there.
His leg twitched again till the point it was practically bouncing up and down under the table. It was completely uncouth behaviour, and he was sure if Draco were here now, he would have sent him a stinging hex to stop it. The sound of a bell alerted him to the door of the café finally opening to admit the red-haired girl he had been waiting for. Harry stood, too quickly, and sent the table skittering over the uneven cobblestone floor. The bowl of sugar cubes and silver tongues went flying and Harry felt his neck flush with embarrassment as eyes turned to look at him. It was strange that he was so nervous about having a coffee with Ginny when all he felt at the prospect of his date with Draco was happiness and excitement.
“I don’t think so. Pant’s father likes men as well as women and nobody is bothered by it even at balls. At least I have never heard anyone say anything”
” Josephine nodded smug that she still had it. Agnus and the third head rolled their eyes but nodded along while Harry blinked slowly in surprise. He had read that the potion would change his magic, however, nobody had believed that the werewolf blood would change him in anyway.
“Draco” “But father, he’s built like a whale” Draco cried and Harry very nearly gave a laugh. He had always said that but of course nobody else would have dared to say it. Lucius sighed sounding amused.
“It’s not that bad!” Draco whined flushing bright red and staring down at his feet while Harry clung to his hand in sympathy at his embarrassment as the adults chuckled.
“Seamus Finnigan! How very dare you? I’ll box your ears, so I shall” She shouted but it was in a way that meant that she would never lay a finger on her son. It was very much an empty threat unlike the ones the Dursley’s had given him.
“Little Boris the Brave crept into the open mouth of the cave clutching his sword to his chest as he called out in a funny squeaking voice that would have sounded better on a mouse. “Hullo? Is there anybody in here? Witch of the woods?” A shrill shriek rose as his voice met the darkness of the cave and Boris the Brave whimpered dropping to the floor as the sound of a thousand bats rose flying towards him. “I wish I have never travelled so far from home! I wish I were brave like my name” Boris cried as the last bat flew overhead.
“You’re mine, Dray, no matter what. You heard what Aunt Cissy and Uncle Luci said. Bella gave them information that will get rid of the dark lord. If you think about it! She has helped stop him…Or she will!” Harry said and Draco let out a warm laugh against his neck and if it was a little wet Harry wasn’t going to say anything. He rubbed circles up and down the taller boys back in the same way he had had done to him and eventually Draco pulled away wiping his eyes before flashing him a brilliant smile.
“Yes, something that we will be talking about later with the healer. But force feeding him is not the answer” Lucius said with a smile towards his son who had sat back down now and was playing about with the food on his own plate.
“I wills! Nobody hurten Master Harry!” Jinx announced and slowly Harry nodded in agreement still holding firm to he Elf’s hand.
I have to go, Harry is waking, I have left things for you, some things that you left with me, and some things that a godfather should have of his godson because no matter what you are the god father of my son, Sevy. Live your life to the fullest and be happy. Your sister Lily-Rose Evans-Potter” The letter jerked for a moment and Harry thought it was going to change back into a letter again but then his father’s voice came out through the lips. It sounded rushed and whispering;
“Narcissa! How absolutely splendid to see you!” A man, dressed in a fancy yellow robe cried as they entered the restaurant. The man was almost as broad as Vernon and had a large moustache his uncle would have been envious of but his hair was long, almost passed his hips, and he was grinning from ear to ear. He strode to Narcissa and pressed a kiss to her cheek before winking at Draco and shaking his hand. “Wow! You look more and more like your father every day! Just like him when he was in school already! And this is your ward?”
“…” Harry flinched again pulling back as the twins stepped easily in front of him their stances protective though there were still smiles on their faces.
“I doubt his family helped” Narcissa put in thoughtfully her delicate nose wrinkled in distaste a sight Harry wasn’t overly familiar with. Narcissa was brought up with breeding and could always be counted on to see the best in everyone, or at least pretend to, for her to show dislike so openly had Harry thinking that Chuck’s family were as bad as his own. “I have met Loretta a few times, a rather brash American who often mistakes loudness for personality, she has not an ounce of true talent in her blood but had people convinced she was as powerful as her grandmother”
“Yup, coming Dray.” Harry hurried over to his own trunk and pulled out the pale blue pyjamas Remus had picked out for him. They had a yellow pigmy puff on the left breast pocket, something the werewolf hadn’t noticed at the time, and Harry touched it gently watching at the way the little fluff ball was spelled to giggle.
“Thank-you” Harry smiled at the elf who gave him a little smile back before Lucius rather dramatically pushed the door open and swept inside. Narcissa followed and although he didn’t want to go in Harry allowed Jinx to carefully usher him forward. She didn’t pull just gently guided him forward until they were standing in a room that seemed to be made completely of wood with thousands of books lining one wall. A huge carved desk took up most of the space though there were dark green arm chairs in front of a fire place. On the wall was another painting who seemed to be glaring darkly at one of the men sitting in the arm chair to the left.
“Mr Black-Potter” Narcissa said briskly clapping her hands together. “Mrs Figg, Healer Hinchcliffe would you like a drink?”
“You did, but clearly I didn’t listen” Remus stuck out his tongue in a childish manner and then turned to look at Harry with his light brown eyebrows lifted on his forehead. “What did you want to speak to us about, Harry?”
“Of course, so many potions?” Lucius asked as the parchment flew into his hand and Tobias gave a slow nod, his thumb and forefinger moved to rub the bridge of his nose his eyes back onto Harry.
Harry felt Draco’s hand slip into his as they walked down the corridor of the bank. They were going in a different direction to when he had arrived and Harry supposed they were going to the main area of the bank. He had been there once briefly when they had first come to inquire about his account manager and Harry had been blown away by it all. He looked sideways at his friend hoping Draco didn’t find it strange that he wanted be with him forever.
“Har! Dray!” Pansy squealed happily running towards them as though she hadn’t seen them in a month and throwing her arms around their necks. “How are you both?! How have you been?”
“Yes, sir” Harry spoke absently, stepping into a pair of dove grey slippers that Draco had given him. They were warm around his toes and the soles were cushioned making him feel like he was standing on a cloud. He was about to follow Lucius but the blonde stopped taking a soft nightgown from the back of a chair. Lucius helped him into it and then tied it around the front once done he lightly combed his hair with his fingers and then together, they made their way to the door that led out to the large landing. The only light came from the lantern that Lucius was holding and Harry made sure he stayed as close as possible. He wasn’t afraid of the dark, the light in the cupboard under the stairs was often broken, but he felt like an intruder in the house.
“Dray? Sorry…I didn’t mean to wake you…” He whispered his voice thick with the remnants of his dream as he realised that he had scratched at his face. “Bad dream.”
“I don’t care, I don’t like it when you make yourself out to be a bad guy. You are a fluffy little dragon”
“It’s a courtship mate!” Ron spluttered showering him with bacon before Hermione could even speak and Harry noticed that that didn’t please their female friend. Surprisingly though Ron seemed to know a lot about the subject. “It’s a pure blood thing, mate, an heir will get it in his head that he likes some girl he sees and then thinks he can’t go up and talk to her like a normal bloke so instead he gives her presents. You know, twelve presents for the twelve days of Yule. It’s an ancient thing, not been done in years...”
“What do we have here George? Little Firsties?” A new unfamiliar voice asked before Draco could answer and Harry  yelped as an unfamiliar arm wrapped itself around his shoulders. The action caused him to dip and pain flooded through him from the magical braces around his body. He twisted out of the grip turning to see two identical red haired boys grinning down at them. Neither one looked in the slightest bit bothered by the fact they had caused him pain, though it was possible that they didn’t know and just thought he was scared by their appearance.  They were wearing black robes with a red and gold tie and the Gryffindor crest on their breasts. Their eyes were a watery blue and freckles decorated pale skin.
Madam Malkins was just in front of him and he gave a fond sort of smile remembering the first time he had stepped into the robe shop before remembering Draco and the conversation that had followed. It was surprising how often he had thought of his former school nemesis over the years. He had spoke for him and his family at their trials and although Lucius had had to go to prison for three years both Draco and his mother had been given home arrest for one year only. From what Hermione had told him in a long letters Draco had, to everyone’s surprise, been apprenticed by Olivander and had opened a wand shop of his own in Hogsmeade. He had married Greengrass but people still spat at him even though he was trying to turn his life around.
“Rickets, Lord Malfoy, young Harry here is suffering from severe malnutrition and as a result has Rickets” The healer answered attempting to get Harry to stand straight but failing as he favoured his left side and his legs were bowed.
“I want to, but sometimes…I still find it hard…” Harry hated to admit that given how much the Malfoy’s and Severus had done for him but his mind still went back to the Dursley’s and the teachers at school. The mind healer said that it was perfectly normal and that it would take time, but Harry still felt incredibly guilty.
“Just Boy” The strange Boy shrugged looking at the horse that had thankfully stayed nearby and was lazily grazing on grass looking completely unaffected by the whole thing. “You have lost a shoe, will you be able to make it home?”
“Masters Harrys…You haven to helps us!” Dobby cried sobbing onto his bare feet “Theys are taken us aways!”
“I’m sure I will” Harry chuckled at the man’s excitement while Draco continued to tell him about Blackbeard or rather Edward Teach.
“He looked at me funny, I am used to that, Harry, it is hardly of import” Draco gave a shrug of his shoulders the twin spots of colour in his cheeks telling Harry that it was of import. Draco hated the looks and sneers he got simply for being a Malfoy, but he was used to pretending that it didn’t bother him. “He outright told you that he took you to those muggles! As if you would be grateful! And then all but accused you of lying!”
The reason I turned my teachers wig blue was because of my cousin, my aunt and uncle hate me getting better marks than him at school so they would pass off my homework as his while I would have to take in his, which was sometimes none at all because he had never completed it. Sadly we had a test and Dudley failed. My teacher accused me of swopping my paper with Dudley as I had never gotten a high grade before. I was angry with him and he had this stupid wig on...It just...Um...Turned blue...”
“That surprises me, but Severus has vouched that he can be trusted. Harry, I hope you know that I will do everything within my power to make sure that you will be kept safe”
“And you did nothing?” Severus growled his heart hot and filled with a righteous anger. He levelled a glare at the woman who flinched.
Once upon a time in the land of Hogwarts there lived a Prince named Draco Lucius Malfoy. His whole life he had been treasured beyond measure his every whim attended to by his overly indulgent parents. He grew from a cute child to a handsome man with blonde hair and grey-blue eyes. One would have thought with the indulgences of his parents that he would have grown into a spoiled brat but thanks to the efforts of another boy, simply named Boy, this had not happened.
“Pants, you’ll make him not want to meet you again!” The blonde huffed tugging her away and Pansy let out a laugh throwing herself at him again her lips pressing frantically to his cheek as she squealed;
“Of course, you are my son…Our son…It is natural I would want you to stand with me when I marry Remus” Severus informed the stunned boy who looked so much younger than he was in his large Christmas hat with Hedwig perched on top. Remus moved away, slightly, blinking away his tears as he grinned at Harry and then Draco
“As am I, but enough of this...Narcissa perhaps Harry should be put to bed and Draco you should go with him. Perhaps not to sleep but to be at his side should he wake. Jinx, will you be with him also? He finds comfort in you”
She moved only when Harry dressed in some more clothes borrowed from Draco that had been shrunk to fit. Draco had gone to his own room to dress himself and they met out on the landing five minutes later. The owl was sitting on his head now and Draco let out a little laugh. “Be careful you she doesn’t poop in your hair, Harry”
Ginny looked up at him and Harry swallowed as he saw how much of a woman she truly was now. The years had been kind to her, her once long ginger hair was now cut into a bob and highlighted making it have more of a true red and not the orange red of her youth. She had about eight piercings in one ear while the other only had one. She had always been pretty but now she was beautiful, and she walked with the grace of a dancer as she came over to him. Her blue eyes shone as she broke into a genuinely happy smile.
“Your father was a very good friend to me, when I believed it was better that I didn’t have friends. He wasn’t a saint Harry, there were times he could be very cruel, spoilt, and selfish and there were times...Or one particular time when I wished I had made a different choice but at the end of the day he was a good friend to me, as was your mother and I am truly grateful that I got to know them both” Remus gave him a sad smile and Harry had a feeling that unlike Severus, Remus had come to terms with the deaths of his friends but then again he hadn’t had the weight of guilt crushing him and Dumbledore twisting that even more. “I will be happy to tell you my memories of him, but, I would also like you to stay in touch because you wanted to. I know that you don’t have any reason to believe me but I tried to get you away from the Dursley’s”
“You judge me?! You have done worse in the service of the dark lord” Severus hissed more out of his own self-loathing than because he meant to hurt his friend. Despite what many believed Lucius truly had been a hot-headed youth who had fallen in with a bad crowd. He had believed that Muggles were a risk to all wizarding kind and even still believed it now.
“I’m sorry, I’m being such an idiot” Harry whispered his voice barely audible over the almost choked sob he let out. “I don’t even know why, they didn’t even hurt me all that much...I’m just being stupid”
“Hey Dray, sorry if this is early, I was up at Luna and Rolf’s first thing and I thought I remembered you saying you woke early to do your thing with wands. I wanted to let you know that I will pick you up for the theatre at 6.30 it’s the muggle one in London, Le nozze di Figaro…” “An Opera? How…Surprising…” Draco whispered aloud to the empty room laughing as he read Harry’s next line. “Yes, I know, surprising right? Me and opera? I can just picture your face. But honestly, I got to really like them, who would have thought it? So, yeah, another reason I’m writing you so early is because I am meeting Ginny this afternoon, I haven’t seen her since the breakup so I’m gonna meet her near Mungo’s so if she hexes me, I will get treated straight away, thought I should tell you in case it ends up on the front of the Prophet or something and you get the wrong idea. Okay! My godchildren are awake, so I must be Hippogriff for a while. Speak to you latter, H.P”
“Youse got to leaves heres Mister Harry Potter! Dobby’s owners are bads people!” Dobby said before growing fearful and giving a nervous laugh “Bad Dobby! Bad, bad Dobby!”
“At least I don’t look like I’m wearing a helmet! Please tell me you’re not keeping your hair like that?” Draco said his lips pulling into a smile as Harry’s nerves slipped away as he watched them and he was glad that he had told Pansy some of the truth as she really did know how to calm down the atmosphere.
“We are continuing your wandless magic, practice on a moving target. Sho has agreed to be the target. We are going to head down to the quidditch pitch! Come on. Sho, you better be ready to start running, my boys are excellent at this…”
“True, but something special happened that night, he who must not be named vanished and hasn’t been seen since” There was a look of pure pride in her face as she gazed at him now and Harry was sure his stomach was feeling like it had been put in a washing machine. It was churning around quickly and he swallowed down a thick lump.
A voice that wasn’t his own was in his head telling him that Dumbledore was right. He did need other friends. Draco wasn’t a very good friend after all. Draco is the best friend! Harry’s voice snarled back at the intruder. You need other friends, being here with this wealth isn’t good for you Harry. You need to be humbled, a humble hero…Broken…No! Harry roared inside his head drowning out the voice that was telling him to leave Draco and the Malfoy’s that they only wanted to hurt him. Whatever was in his head jerked back in surprise at the force of his mental shout.
“I see, then I am very happy to meet you, Heir Malfoy” Remus was polite bowing his head at Draco who gracefully rolled his shoulders into a stiff shrug that Harry had seen Lucius do. It was stiff and awkward but it was something that would be perfect when he grew.
“Dray doesn’t force me to do anything!” Harry hissed throwing open the curtains and glaring at Albright. “Dray sleeps with me cause I have nightmares without him! You keep whispering about Draco, but he is my best friend, he saved my life. I don’t care what your parents told you, or what you believe about the Malfoy’s! Your hero Dumbledore? He left me with my Aunt and Uncle, my aunt and uncle who hated magic and did everything they could to beat it out of me! They locked me in the cupboard under the stairs, they refused me food, hit me if I didn’t listen and Dumbledore knew…He thought it would build ‘character’ make me into a hero…The Malfoy’s saved me, so you can take what you think you know and shove it up your arse!” Harry jumped up from the bed and pushed into Albright’s chest making his way to the bathroom at the far end of the dorm before pausing and lifting up the back of his PJ’s to show the faint lines of scars across his back. “This is what Dumbledore allowed to happen to me…”
“You always think too loudly.” Draco chuckled sleepily his hand trailing up and down his arm. “What’s wrong, Harry?”
“They are here with Professor Snape, Nick, they will be starting next year” Fred explained patting both Harry and Draco on the shoulders and the ghost looked outwardly surprised but smiled anyway.
“Thank-you! You cheered hard! You play Quidditch?” She asked, like Masaki struggling with her English even with the translation spell but she was much better than he was.
He refused to say he had taken time away to find himself but he supposed that was what he had done. He had never been allowed to be himself before. At the Dursley’s he had always been told what to do and how he had to behave. At Hogwarts he had been thrust into a war he hadn’t known anything about and held the expectations of everyone, everyone that had wanted him to be just like his dad. It had been Luna that had suggested Romania and although the Blonde Ravenclaw had always been a little flighty he had gone wit it.
“I have not” He lied smoothly “It is not something that needs to be done right this moment. And it should be left to Harry”
“You have a problem with our parents, Ma’am?” Draco asked his tone clipped and edged with ice. For a ten-year-old he had already mastered imposing and Harry smiled knowing that his Uncle Luci would be proud.
“You’re more than welcome, but please call me Filius, I haven’t been your professor for many years. I was surprised by the wording. My Japanese isn’t what it once was, but Haha is mother I believe?” Flitwick hummed rocking back and forth just a little as he took another sip of his drink and Harry looked at his two…Fathers. Although he had been studying Latin and Japanese, he hadn’t known the words that were used for the spell. Remus chuckled brightly, his amber eyes catching the light of the candles around the chapel room as he looked at Severus who was flushed just a little pink.
“Oh, they are mostly used for storage now. We haven’t had an iron maiden in years, though I’m sure that father could arrange for another one to be brought if you so wished. It’s been ages since I got to play like that” Draco said dryly only the corners of his mouth twitching to show that he was only joking. Harry rolled his eyes and let out a laugh nudging his arm.
“Harry, the healer told you not to ignore the pain! If it’s too much then I will tell mother, you don’t have to suffer” Draco huffed playing around with his fringe his fingers brushing over the scar on his forehead and Harry flushed for a minute looking at the teacher who was looking extremely concerned but was holding herself back from saying anything.
“Come on, Draco, the war is over, we survived and Tom is dead...Can’t we at least pretend that we are okay with that? Even for a short while”
“Professor Quirrell was meant to be Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher this year” Penelope whispered as Sinistra introduced some more of the staff. “He went searching for Vampires or something last year for practical experience, but it messed up his head, at least that’s what some of the students were saying on the train…”
“She is also the reason you have your heart set on your trip to Japan before going to Hogwarts next year, does my Dragon have his first bloom of love?”
“Don’t apologise, if you’re tired you should take a nap, mother and father will wake us if they need us, but not on the chairs, as comfortable as they are they can’t do your back any good”
“I accept Hadrien Junius Peverell as my child” Severus announced confidently taking the knife and slicing his palm. Harry jerked a little at the sight of the blood, but he had been told it would happen and he swallowed down his gasp of shock. Three drops of blood moved into the potion and it bubbled and slurped changing from a dull brown to a coppery red colour. Narcissa smiled taking out her wand and pointing it at the goblet whispering
“This is the office of the most hated person in Hogwarts, Filch…Now the one thing you have to remember about old Filch is…He as a cat Mrs Norris…Mrs Norris is as bad as he is…Unless you know the trick…” The Twins said with twin smirks tapping their noses as they moved to the long-haired tabby who stared up at them with very orange eyes. She let out a meow that was almost a hiss, but it died when Fred pulled out something from his robes, a tin, a large tin of the best mackerel in freshwater money had to offer. “Here kitty-kitty…You want this, don’t you? There’s a good girl!” Fred opened the tin and pushed it to the cat who gave a happier meow before devouring her meal. “Now we have time….”
“Oh…Well…You did it” Harry grinned happily at his friend who ran his fingers awkwardly through his hair and then grinned back. “You’re my best friend”
“You will stay here of course. We have plenty of room and there is a dungeon that you can be locked in” Narcissa said swiftly, her tone light and breezy as though she was offering him a cup of tea. Remus blinked his mouth falling open while Severus nodded stroking his chin.
“There are a great many things that I don’t want to do but I will do it for you, brat, now stop chopping those leaves before there is nothing left” Severus sighed and Harry was almost positive that there was something fond in his expression. “Have you decided on a name for that owl of yours?”
“What?” McGonagall spluttered ripping the hat off Draco’s head while the great hall buzzed with excitement all craning their necks to see where Harry Potter was.
“I am more than happy to rub off on you” Remus chuckled his voice thickening as heat filled his eyes and Severus let out a laugh of his own twin spots of colour forming in his cheeks as he realised too late the suggestiveness of his tone.
“So you...You are telling me...That my one true love is a pure blood who is gonna send me crazy gifts like this for 12 days? Can’t I just tell him no?
He would go on an adventure in the summer, he told himself clenching his fist to the moon, he would go on an adventure and prove to everyone that he really was Boris the Brave. His mother would be well in the summer, surely, yes, the summer, there was no sense in going in the winter. Much too cold and wet. So little Boris the Brave felt satisfied until it came to the summer.
“Not as exciting as last years” Narcissa chuckled and Harry couldn’t help but wonder what Draco’s goal had been last year. When he asked, the blonde blushed to the very roots of his hair and then mumbled so quietly that Harry had to strain to hear him.
“You are very welcome Harry, you are a child for all that you have had to be an adult. And I have nothing I would rather be doing” Lucius told him in a firm tone that seemed to be genuine. Harry gave him a smile, a warm feeling settling in his stomach. Lucius had been furious when he had returned from Hogsmeade in the depths of a panic attack clutching to Severus. He had at first thought Lupin had done something to him, but Severus had explained what had happened with the twins. “Did you enjoy Lupin’s company?”
“Dray, I’m going to go see dad before dinner.” He said carefully shoving his music book away as well and making sure the snake was comfortable around his neck and hidden by his robe. Draco nodded his face shuttering in on itself as the two boys came into the room. Neither boy spoke to them, but the silence was almost deafening, and Harry wanted to get out of there before they did, or at the very least Albright did.
“At least he answered, he has always been fond of you” Draco found it hard to imagine his Godfather being fond of anyone but at least he had given him some information and he was sure that he would be able to get more out of him at another time. Setting that letter aside he picked up the one from Harry and tore it open happily.
“This is the sorting hat, when I say your name, I want you to come over and I will set the hat on your head…Susan Bones…” She called and a nervous girl with wispy hair darted forward and sat on the seat. It didn’t take long for the hat to call out Hufflepuff. The girl sighed happily and then moved over to the table that was cheering. Slowly McGonagall went down the alphabetical list and Draco smiled as Seamus was placed into Gryffindor after much deliberation. As it got closer to his name he felt Harry’s nails digging in painfully to his hand and he swallowed watching McGonagall form the name Draco Malfoy.
“Yes, thank-you” Kingsley repeated ushering the man out while two guards. Both burly and mean looking came in with Bella chained between them. At least, Narcissa believed that it was Bella, her sister had changed so much that it was almost impossible to recognise her. Bella had been beautiful when she had been brought to Azkaban with wild jet back hair that tumbled over stunningly dark features but now. Now she was gaunt. Her hair was a mattered mess, her eyes sunken into her face while her skin looked like it had been stretched over her bones. Her teeth were so yellow they were almost brown and there was spittle clinging to her lips. She was fighting against the guards held in a straitjacket the deranged smile on her face only increasing as she saw Narcissa standing there.
“Are you ready to go down? The gifts for the eleven days are all practical things but those we get on the twelfth are all games and fun things!” Draco hummed happily, his grey blue eyes shone with childish glee and Harry smiled widely, but he could still feel a strange ball of nerves in his stomach. He had never gotten excited by Christmas. At the Dursley’s it had always just meant extra work. Vernon’s sister would come to stay with one or more of her awful ugly dogs. He would start making dinner on Christmas eve and then watch through the hole in his door as the Dursley’s would sneak around putting presents from Santa under the tree. There was always so many that most of the fake garish tree was hidden and Dudley still wanted more. Nothing had been there for Harry, of course, he didn’t even get a thank-you for all the cooking he did. Christmas had always been just another, busier day. “You’re thinking too hard again, Harry, come on! The elves always make a super breakfast today”
“You like the game?” A female voice asked suddenly, and Harry blinked pulling himself out of his thoughts to look at the Hummingbird seeker. She was beautiful, slim with yet black hair that was braided into an ornate style on top of her hair. Her eyes were almost gold with flecks of light brown that appeared darker. She was smiling to reveal small white teeth and a large amount of gum.
“Thank you for this Harry. I won’t let you down...And thank you for the letter. Should I read it now?”
“I think that is a good idea! You’ll be okay, right, Harry?” He asked carefully and Harry gave a nod squeezing his hand back before letting it go. He wasn’t hundred percent convinced that he wasn’t going to have a panic attack, but he did feel that Severus and Remus would look after him.
“Draco, I have just spent time with over 30 omega I can’t not tell you the specific one you are babbling about but take heart…All of the omega I have delt with are coming to your ball…”
“Here you go” Remus said taking the coins from his wallet and handing them over with a friendly smile. Robertson latched on to the smile gratefully though Harry could see that he was seriously trying to work out how somebody as friendly as Remus was with Severus who was scowling like he was about to set both the ice cream cart and seller alight with his mind. “Come on, Severus, Harry, the Kelpies await” Remus chuckled licking his ice cream and guiding them away from the relieved looking Robertson and Severus let out a long breath.
“He seems nice” Harry put out and Nino nodded again grinning as they caught up with Masaki who had stopped outside a door that led to another enclosure.
“Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?” The girl from the train with the bushy hair asked in a nasally tone which Draco knew would soon grate on his nerves. It was the sort of tone that said quite clearly ‘I’m better at anything than you’. Draco knew the tone well, it was the same one that he himself used, however, he hated hearing it on other people. Nick’s top lip curled and then he slowly pulled on of his ears saying,
“Put Pansy’s letter on the side, Dobby" he muttered dismissively deciding he could deal with Pansy’s drivel later. She was his oldest friend in the world but she could be annoying sometimes. Immediately Dobby started pulling on his ears looking like he was about to cry as he almost howled:
The trio spoke for an hour or more about various subjects and Harry felt the tension, that he hadn’t realised he was holding onto, slip away as he breathed in the strange concoction of scents that clung to his dad and by default the sofa they were sitting on. He knew that it was potion ingredients, but they were always so muddled he couldn’t pinpoint the exact ones. It was a warm mix of spices and sweet that seeped into his bones making him feel safe and warm. Eventually though Severus said that it was time for dinner in the great hall and although he wanted to whine and protest Harry dragged himself up into a seated position.
"we since I'm already number one on people nobody wants to eat with I suppose we would make quite a pair"
“Yes, I’m fine, Professor Snape is going to tell me about my mum” He answered smiling at the professor who smiled back before tucking into the black pudding on his plate. Harry looked away as he ate taking some more of his own food, mostly because Draco had started feeding him, surprised when the dark haired man spoke again.
“Dobby?” He called with a grandfatherly smile fixed on his bearded face. His blue eyes where made brighter in the light of the hospital ward and the elf blinked slowly his mouth opening and closing as he tried to get rid of the potions he had been no doubt doused with. “Dobby, my name is Albus Dumbledore…Do you know me?”
“We really did. Your chocolate just keeps getting better and better!” Draco hummed licking foam from his top lip as the elf ushered them towards the crackling fire as the adults finally came in.
A scream tore through Harry’s body as he woke with a jerk. Panting heavily he looked around terrified that the nameless figures from his dreams would be standing over him waiting to finish the   job they had started. His heart racing and his eyes unfocused from the lack of glasses it took him a few moments to realise that he was the bed in the Malfoy’s home. Unlike last night he was alone and the large empty bed was enough to frighten him as much as the dream and the figures that were lurking in there
“Fine, I’ve already searched all the carriages before this one, I’m Hermione Granger, you have a mark on your nose…” She said as the pair left shutting the carriage door behind them.
