"What do you mean?" Harmony pointed to her scar.
"He's picking up the speed, and watching at different angles," Harmony said, "soon one of them will begin to feign seeing the snitch, or when the score becomes more uneven, then one of them will catch it. Right now, they're watching-"
"Thanks Leighton," she said as she went to leave. He saluted her with a wave of his hand and when she got to the door, it swished open for her. She walked along the dark halls in tiptoes, chanting the spell lumos in her mind and watching her wand shroud her arm in fading light, as if a firefly sat on her wand.
Harry said nothing, even as the old man looked broken in defeat. How could he? Harry narrowed his eyes.
"What do you mean?" Voldemort asked, following him with his eyes.
"Does it matter that I am a girl, with the prophecy?"
Draco awoke as the sun slapped his eyes shut, and he jumped up. This may be the only chance for him. He tiptoed to the curtained off section where Harry Potter still slept. Behind the white sheet, Draco glimpsed a pretty face… this couldn't be the right bed, before Madam Pomfrey pulled him aside and told him he was free to go.
"Hogwarts, master," said Lucious Malfoy's voice.
"Someone hexed him. Bad." Ugg, he hoped those weren't tears that fell from his eyes.
"God, he is so infuriating," Harmony said when the bell stopped jingling when Malfoy left.
"Vold-," she quickly stopped herself at the sever expression on his face, "The Dark Lord was torturing someone."
"I'm sleeping, bugger off."
"Just wondering how Potter has been since our last run in at the bookstore." Harmony turned from the window to see steel eyes locked in on her face. No. He continued to scrutinize her as if seeing the girl under her mask. He couldn't know, not even her best mates figured it out, and they spent half the summer together. This had to be some joke he was playing at. He wouldn't stop gazing. No. He knew.
"Whatever," she said and started to walk to the dorms. She didn't care if she had hurt Ron's feelings. He didn't have to be such a prat about it. What, as if he knew better about how she should live her life.
Following Ginny's lead, Harmony took a glass and looked at it skeptically, before taking a sip. The drink was sweet and rich, fruity with a hint of something that Harmony couldn't identify. Harmony drank deeper, finishing it, and placed the empty glass by the side of the pool. She heard a light chuckle as Blaise stepped near and replaced it with a full one.
"Yeah," Harmony muttered, "I really appreciate it."
There was a distinct mumbling of upsetting words coming from Snape's mouth, words that ought not be repeated, though were creative in their dimensions of using wands in their not so conventional uses of shoving them in improbable areas.
"Naturally," Draco said and returned to the tube with renewed resolve.
"The Dark Lord's revival went awry, and now his body is incomplete. He believes that if he reclaims the fragments of his soul, then his body will be whole again." Draco could tell that the older man was withholding something from him.
"Kreacher. What is this?" Harmony asked and brought it closer to her face. The locket was made of a heavy gold with a snake in the center in a serpentine S.
"By the foulest act of dark magic," Leighton said, "an act of such evil, it is a violation of nature."
"I saw it in a dream," Harmony said. It sounded weak even to her ears. "Voldemort and I share a connection," she said and tapped her scar, "that's why Snape is teaching me occlumency."
"Uhh yeah, well Ron and I have just been hanging around the Order, nothing special really."
"Er. You look great too," she said and watched as his smile grew as his eyes lowered to the dragon necklace.
"What? How did you know?" Now this was getting scary, did Malfoy develop mind raping skills from Snape?
"Yes, but it felt so real," she said, "It was real."
"It's Harry Potter's fault." Hermione stated. Hearing the expressionless words, Harmony cringed and dropped a spoon in surprise. Harmony bent quickly, scooped up the spoon and tossed it into the sink, grabbing another one. Hoping that Hermione didn't notice.
"Alright," she said, meeting his gray eyes "here goes nothing. Legillemens." Draco felt her mind poke into his head almost hesitantly. He easily blocked out his most precious memories and allowed only his mundane ones present. He even guarded his thoughts from hers and occasionally said something to her. 'It's alright,' Draco thought, 'try to break through deeper.' He felt as Harmony grazed the surface of his mind. She went further, and Draco smiled at her progress. She snatched one of his memories of when he had been three, and had received his first toy broom. He forced her to let that go, and he reorganized his mind. A brilliant idea occurred to him as he made her see certain things. Of him watching her play quidditch and admitting that she was very good. How he watched her from across the great hall, and heard as he wondered about her. Draco could tell that she was interested as she went further into his mind. But this was dangerous for her as well, if she went too far without knowing where she was going. Draco lead her out, he pushed her from his mind gently at first, then completely without warning.
"I know, it's terrible," Harmony said.
"Nah, he's just angry that I got the girl he wanted."
"What hasn't started professor?"
"You didn't do that to them, did you Honey Dukes?" Luna asked.
"I am so sorry," Draco leaned closer to her, "I couldn't help you."
"Maybe you don't know him so well after all," she said, waving a bye to him. When she was far enough, he took the stained handkerchief and gripped it tightly to a fist. Though the vanilla extract overpowered his senses, he could still trace the aroma of jasmine that lingered, and he crushed the fabric as he walked to his next class. He'd have to follow her later at night.
"Keep that on you at all times," he said, "since I am to be watching out for you." He pulled out his own mirror from his robes, and placed it on a cabinet near them.
"At the moment of life and death, those few seconds before everything is lost are the most important. If you can not produce the antidote, then at least you can preform a spell to slow the poison, or slow the heart. Healing as well as pain comes in many forms. In a battle, we can not always rely on a mediwizzard. So, who wants a taste?"
"Legillimens!" Harmony delved into his mind, and came out almost empty handed. She went deeper, forcing her way into his thoughts. He felt her go blindly against him, and Draco presented a memory which he thought frequently of. It was the time that they had their first date, as he liked to call it, at Hogsmead. It was a simple memory as he walked with his arm around her, touching her bare shoulder. It brought him something akin to happiness, as he allowed a passing thought to be noticed. The one word, beautiful, left him, and Harmony pulled away abruptly.
"No," Harmony said, "I want you to leave."
"Er," she said, realizing that it wasn't such a good idea to talk in the middle of the hall, "are you OK?"
"There's a reason why I started boxing," Dudley uttered rapidly. "I was alone one day and a group of really older kids cornered me because they didn't like my attitude or something. They called me 'fat arse' and took turns beating me up. I wanted to get bigger so that I could punch their cheek bones in."
"Then wouldn't it be good if the Dark Lord retrieves his soul?" Luna asked.
"What am I going to do?" The ferret stuck his head out, facing her, "Voldemort is-" the ferret squeaked at the name, but covered it with a half convincing sneeze, "out there." It brushed its head against her hand, wanting to play. "Aren't you scared, whom do you belong to?" The ferret ignored her, as it tumbled around. "It must be nice being a ferret, and not having a care in the world." The ferret huffed in response before running off.
Harmony grazed his hands after a pause, "of course."
He stepped out after her in time to see her leap on her broom, as her figure soared off, until she was nothing more than a speck. Then she was gone.
"Where did you get this?" Leighton asked, his voice deeper.
"Yeah," Harmony laughed, "I'd like to see you try." She veered right, pressing her body to her broom and shot over the Black Lake. A blast of flames barely missed her, and Harmony swerved each time she heard a shrill 'AVADA KEDAVRA'! She sent curses over her head with meager success, all the while feeling the hot breath of the dragon licking her back. Why the hell did Voldermort have a dragon? It was rather unfair at the moment. Harmony took them further from Hogwarts, deep into the mountains. She dived into the canopy of leaves, dodging branches as she came in too fast, and trees burst in flames around her. The sound of snapping branches was just behind her, and Harmony flew on with a cold sweat making her numb.
"Let me check my schedule," he pretended to pull out a slip of paper, "nope, but I noticed that we haven't bonded in a while so I figured that you missed me." Potter gave him an incredulous look and Draco got comfortable on the opposite side of him. "So anything new happen…hmm?" The other boy chose not to answer. "You know it helps if you say something back."
Draco pushed Ginny away. "Nothing," he said, "and Harmony couldn't care less about me."
"Silly, that's the muggle station we use before boarding the Hogwarts express," Hermione supplied.
Professor Snape had opened his mouth, ready with another retort. His mouth snapped shut instead. Harmony watched as the anger drained out of the man.
Draco did not want to go to Defense Against the Dark Arts class. When he stepped onto the blue and red padding, he immediately regretted it. Leighton was as infuriating as ever. Draco wished that he had some hippogryph shat to throw at the man, anything that would cover his honey eyes and grinning face. Then he really would be a shite headed git. The windows shut on their own accord and the torch light dimmed.
Draco lifted a brow, "For all I care, he could be a sea urchin."
"You are lucky though, considering what's left. Imagine if I had to be with Pansy, and had to listen to her bash your girl all day." It seemed like Draco had gone back to ignoring his friend, and soon they were at the wall. "So did you let Potter in our common room?"
"I am 18, sir. I graduated from Durmstrang about a year ago."
"Yep," he took Ginny's broom as well, "I'll takes these back, they're closer to the Slytherin common rooms."
"Like, you're voice, and the fact that you're not twelve anymore." Harmony snorted.
"Oh Harry," he whispered in her ear. He was now too tall for her and smothered her in a warm embrace. She couldn't help the grin that took over the lower half of her face. Sirius stepped away to get a good look and frowned. "This is strange," he said and caught himself. Her face started to turn pink. It didn't help that she was wearing a flowing cotton white dress with flower embroidery at the hem that reached her mid thigh. She wondered why McGonagall had 'asked' her to wear this one. "What I meant is different."
"Tell me!" Voldemort nearly shrieked.
"Hello professor," Luna said, "have a good break?" Leighton smiled at her and ambled closer.
"This isn't your fault." Harmony said.
"Well I suppose that you wouldn't be able to follow the given instructions, but why would you know how to cook anyway?" She gave him a shrug.
"Things change, and people grow up," Harmony said, "and I'm not asking you to be his friend, just don't judge everybody!"
"Draco, follow me." The severe look that his father gave him left no room for any disobedience.
She watched as Voldemort picked the slender wand from Dumbledore's limp grasp, and lifted it curiously over his head. "At last," he yelled. Theodore Nott stood at the back, where Crabe and Goyle held the slumbering kidnapped students. Fenrir Greyback lay on the ground, a puddle of blood outlining his body. "Dumbledore is dead!" Voldemort laughed. "Nyeah eh hey!"
"Yep," Ginny purred with delight. "So what do you think?"
"What power? He is so much more powerful and ruthless."
Draco didn't say a word, just pulled out his wand.
"Minervra is waiting in the apartment, I'll be back momentarily and trust that nothing further will commence," Snape gave them each the Snape Glare, well mostly towards Leighton, and left the room with his cape billowing for added effect.
The song ended and Kingscross gave her a small bow, and grinned as he thanked her for the dance. It was then, that Draco made his move.
Skin peeled off Voldemort, and his body thudded against the floor. Bones visibly contorted and moved under his skin as he began to convulse violently. His red eyes rolled back and bloody saliva fell from his clenched teeth, and yet still he did not scream in pain. Magic seeped from him, crackling and scorching the walls. His three followers did nothing to help him. His head snapped up, facing Harmony. "It is Potter!" Red slitted eyes were on her. "He did this to me! I must know the prophesy." Magic seared against the door, bursting it open. She toppled over, thrown into the door behind her, which gave way. She fell on her back, feeling the straw prickling at her neck and arms. Without thinking, she sent magic to slam the door. Panic twisted her stomach, and she scrambled blindly, for any way out. A groan came from her left, and she shout out for light. On the floor lay the crippled figure of a man, whose fingerless palm and metal were covering his eyes.
"If you say so, but you missed a great night," Ron muttered. And he began to fill her in what she missed, about what she already knew. She had been there. Seen the costumes, heard the music, tasted the punch that Fred and George had tampered with, witnessed the neon pink of half a certain professor's robes. She had seen that all, and tried to look interested.
"Alright, lead the way." Harmony knew where she was going, well most of the time. It was just with him, when she wasn't really thinking about where she was going. She was reminded of when she had said those same words to him, when they had been under the invisibility cloak. That night had changed so many things. She wished that it hadn't. What could have happened wasn't a mystery. Harmony looked at him and her lips remembered what she had locked away. What the locket had taken from her.
"It will be late at night and no one will see it," Harmony muttered, not wanting the horrid smelling stuff near her fingers.
"Enough of it Miss Harmony James Potter," Snape continued to sneer. "Though knowing your father he had to add James somewhere within your name. The arrogant prat."
"Call me Harmony." They nodded their heads. What was in a name any way? Regardless of whatever others labeled her, she would still be the same inside. Harry was a mask for her. She was the girl who lived; she was Harmony.
"AVADA KEDAVRA!"
He hadn't wanted Harmony to spend the winter vacation without him, but couldn't think of a way to sneak off with her. He would have to face his father sooner or later...
"Yes," she said, "the, er, staircases shifted."
"I think it's to fill our heads with as much as they can and so when we come back, there's still a chance that something is left." Luna brought a new book out.
Draco stood before his bathroom mirror, checking himself out. He wore slim fitting black pants and a chain mail shirt. His skin shown through like modest spots on an animal, and even though he wasn't built like a lumberjack, or a stupid bear, he still prized his physique. He had on a mask of silver that only covered the span around his eyes. The metal had tarnished with time, and appeared darker than it should. When he was sure that he looked absolutely desirable, he left for the Great Hall. He had grown accustomed traveling alone, so it was no surprise that Crabbe and Goyle were not present for his entrance. He was going without a date, and Draco wasn't expecting much from the Halloween masquerade party. It wasn't like he was going there to have a good time.
"Yup."
Like a tree twisting and turning unable to find light, Snape's form hunched crookedly over Ron, his spidery fingers latched to the desk. "Would you like to take his detention instead, Mister Weasley?"
"Your girlfriend is Potter."
"Lumos!" Kingscross said with a clear voice. The light blinded Draco's eyes. "Cub, congratulations." Draco opened his eyes a smidgen, and he saw a cat with its ears back growling in the direction of the hyenas. "Cub," Kingscross snapped his finger, "Harmony." The cat's ears twitched in the professor's direction. "That's well enough." Draco examined the cat from where he sat. It was just about over 100 cm, but wasn't as big as Draco had thought it would be, based on the racket it had made. It was nowhere near the size of a lion or any big cat. It looked at him, and he could see Harmony. She had long black ears with tassels at the end of each ear tip. Across her forehead was a black marking of a thunderbolt. Her nose was a dark pink, and she had the same green colored eyes. Though she was medium sized, she had impressive muscles under sandy golden fur. Her under belly was white, and when she took a few steps, it was like she was taught with power and feline grace. Her tail tapered between her legs and she moved it with delight. Harmony was a beautiful creature. She sniffed some raw meat on the ground and a curious tongue darted on the surface. Ginny and Luna came closer as well to admire the cat.
She had been ignoring him as much as she could, but she didn't know what to do about him. Those words on the train that he would make her change her mind hadn't left her. She wouldn't have been so worried about what those words meant, if it was anyone but him. Like it was inevitable. Harmony bit her lip, hoping that he wasn't planning anything. It was worse than a threat.
"We should go back for them."
"Nervous?" he asked. She shook her head, and betrayed her thoughts. He casually stepped till he was in front of her. She couldn't look away and gripped her broom tighter with it pressed against her chest. Why had she made this silly challenge?
"But you're still here and won't let that happen. Maybe it's better if things stay as they are. Who knows what war will bring. I could very well die." Draco looked in to her green eyes. "But I will destroy Voldemort first."
"Well I got to go finish a letter." Harmony got up from the couch.
She glared at him, wondering why he had to be such a prat all of the time, "Well at least I'm not a little coward, who has to have Mummy and Daddy in order to feel important. And it's a good thing that practically everything can be bought with money, right, enables you to screw people over." He scoffed at her.
"Maybe he can show you how to properly guard yourself, I would think that he would be good at suppressing his emotions." Harmony snorted, and thought that maybe she knew Draco better than he did. Draco hadn't been suppressing himself recently, but perhaps Snape didn't know because she had been guarding her most recent memories.
"What's the matter?" Harmony asked loudly from the start of a new song. Draco had been heading for the door. Her sweetness twisted something inside of him. She was too innocent, and though he had hated that about her before, now it made him want to protect her. And that was completely idiotic.
He heard giggling and looked up. Ginny was brushing wet strands away from Harmony's face. Her hands went to the back of Harmony's neck pulling her close.
Draco busied himself by flipping through the pages, and following the first step of setting the flame so that the cauldron would heat to 193 degrees Celsius. Harmony left with a tray to get the ingredients and Draco laid out knives and a cutting board. He was delighted to note that there were only a few ingredients for this potion, but judging by the book, the directions looked to be complicated. He could not lower his eyes when Harmony reappeared, and from her robes he could make out the slight curves of her hips. Though robes were sometimes a blessing, he wished that they allowed the physique of the wearer to show. His eyes skimmed briefly over her tie, to the white collared shirt that peaked over her vest. He had to direct his attention to her tray as she neared, which thankfully was at her waste level. "Good to see that you haven't mixed everything up this time," Draco said as she sat next to him. She shrugged her shoulders as she bent down to place her book onto her lap. He found himself watching her once more, and forced his head into his own potions book. "We need to grind the roots of that plant into clay," Draco muttered as he pointed at her tray. With a steady hand he picked the salamander tail and sliced it into one-centimeter pieces.
"That makes me feel so good that you know," Ron smiled, "it was driving me mental."
"Are you two going out?" Harmony took a knife and nosily scraped her plate, no longer able to listen to their giggling and whispering. Their Ruddy cheeks and sidelong glances told her everything. "That's so lush," Harmony said.
"Maybe we should play a game where all of us hide, except for one, and that one looks for us!" Ginny exclaimed.
"Then make sure Harry doesn't die," Draco said, "my life depends on that." Through the grave silence, footsteps were approaching. His father noticed as well, and looked down at Draco. There was pain in those eyes and Draco wished that there was another way. "I'm sorry," Draco almost whispered. Mr. Malfoy took a step towards him, and he saw his father's arm come for his wrist. He only hoped that there was no wand there as he turned around and ran for those footsteps. He couldn't bear to see his father so.
"But I don't—"
Ginny kept giving her strange looks, and Harmony unconsciously felt for the locket under her shirt. She was a taught string with fraying threads, sooner or later something had to give. She probably could have made it all the way to Hogwarts, if Draco hadn't appeared, that is.
"I just met this really wonderful girl." Draco replied watching Pansy's eyes narrow.
"What Potter?" Blaise sneered, "got no balls?"
"True," he said, "we havn't had a match yet. I think the next Gryffindor verses Slytherine game is in spring this year."
"Nothing, I just wanted to see you." Draco smirked a bit; he knew Potter was getting uncomfortable. "You look better though without your glasses." One of Potter's eyebrows rose, this was too much fun. Draco continued to stare at him, looking to see if there was anything different about him.
"I have to go soon," she said, and Draco nodded his head. The party was very much alive, but he wanted it to last, before the dream could fall apart. "You know, in time to beat my house mates back to the dorm."
The woman looked dead, like the blood had been drained from her body, from a wound to her heart, but even so, she was beautiful, timeless even. The woman was on a circle array, and the unmistakable thudding of a still beating heart pounded in Harmony's ears. Harmony saw the woman's face and woke up, dread making her cold, staring up at the flickering candles of the Great Hall. Narcissa Malfoy's bloodless face stared at her as Harmony closed her eyes. Harmony sat up, and shook the girl next to her. "Ginny," she whispered, "wake up." Harmony attempted to be quieter as someone else moved. "Ginny!" The girl opened her eyes, "we need to get out of here. Turn into a hawk and wake up Luna," Harmony whispered, as she kept her Potter mask in place.
Ron looked confused. Clearly he was expecting a different reaction. Or perhaps he had simply hurt his mind trying to come up with a reason why someone would want to date a Malfoy. "No. It isn't." Ron retorted.
"I think he's right," Luna said, "she could use our help now." Ginny scowled at Draco before turning the knob.
"Uh huh, and I think you're mental," Draco said amused. Harmony had her mouth open to suggest that they do it over the lake when a biting gust of wind froze her words. Her whole body shivered, as if Dementors had struck her.
"Anyway, I think your room needs some changes." Draco watched in trepidation, as Harmony turned the colors of his room into soft pinks and reds. She made the skull on his wall into a poorly constructed rendition of Snape's face, and scattered his few possessions all over. After she was through with it, it looked like a 12 year old girl had a birthday party in his room. By then he told her that they really needed to leave or else get caught, and salvage the rest of his room. "I think it looks better," she said.
"Great, I need to get ready. Come with me to the Grffindor common room," Harmony said, and Draco smirked. He waited for her as Harmony went to her room and picked up her invisibility cloak and marauders map. She spelled her door shut and grabbed Draco's hand in her excitement. Draco pulled his green scarf with one hand, and hung it over her so that she would blend in.
"I want pay back," she said, "I'm planing something for the Slytherins, care to join me?" Draco saw the glint in her eyes and smirked.
"Let's dance," he guided her to where the band played.
"What was that about?" Ron asked while the color of his checks faded.
Charlie: Attempts at Flirting
"How?" Ginny asked.
"Miss me already?" he teased, allowing her hand to be free. Like all of his previous anger had melted away, he stared at her with new eyes. Heat began to form on her checks, and not from the brisk run she could not convince herself had raised her temperature. Draco must have noticed because the smirk on his face, wasn't a smirk at all. He was smiling. "But really, I had no idea you really wanted me to stay."
"Ron," Harmony said with a flare of anger, "piss off." Hermione grabbed Ron's hand and began to push him back. She whispered something in his ear and looked at them with an apologetic look.
"Where the hell is Professor Dumbledore?" Ron asked, whipping his head to the staff table. Doors from the back of the hall burst open, and some students screamed in fear. Dumbledore stepped out along with other staff members. He walked to his usual seat at the Dining Hall, and each student had his full attention. He sat down, and necks craned to maintain eye contact. Dumbledore began to eat. Students began to whisper amongst themselves, wondering if they were doomed. One of the Professors coughed into their hand intentionally, and Dumbledore, remembering himself, got up once more to address the students.
"Yeah, and what would your girlfriend think if she caught you staring at Harry?" Draco grinned at the boy and laughed. Draco liked how girlfriend sounded to him.
"Well isn't that why the headmaster Dumbledore was with you."
"A poof," Ron continued, "for Malfoy."
"Everyone but Draco," Ginny patted her back, "I know."
"Will give me bad indigestion, anyway, they'll figure that you helped me."
"I think so, Harry must have won," Luna said. Ginny could see as behind them her brothers started up a cheer that spread throughout the hall, yelling, Potter! Potter!
"I suppose," Harmony said, "but I'm not celebrating."
"She looks remarkably like Lily." Snape said through tight lips. Harry made her way to the bed.
"Harry Potter," cried out the Dark Lord, from atop the back of the dragon. Then it all made sense. Why there was a dragon at Hogwarts and where Harmony was running. He understood and he had to stop her. He had to convince her not to do something that left her hurt again, or worse this time.
"The match isn't important," Draco surprised her. "Not compared with the breakout."
"I couldn't face my dad, and didn't protect Harmony. I just froze there like a fool."
"Is she alright?" Draco asked.
"What are you two doing?"
"I ran here," she put a hand to her heated cheeks. A that precise moment, Draco opened the boys' changing room, and a couple of girls turned to see him in a clinging black shirt and loose shorts. Ginny grabbed her hand seconds latter.
"Hospital wing," Snape said, pointing to the exit, and Bulstorde walked down with Pansy, shooting Harmony a sneer. "Anyone else?" Snape asked and no one answered, "how about you, Malfoy?"
"So who do you think will be the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor this year?" Hermione asked.
She pulled out her wand and slicked her wet hair from getting into her eyes, "who cast that?" she demanded. The laughter increased, and it was as if she were up against most of the Slytherin house. "Ya bloody coward!" They continued walking in the hall, and some of them bumped into her.
"No!" Ginny said, "it's definitely Snape's sweat!"
"Really, I find that hard to believe."
"What's wrong with him?" Harry asked as he got up for a better view. Crabbe's rotund body blocked part of his entertainment.
"No, the others just can't find out, nor can my family." Harmony considered that. Though unlikely, he may be labeled a traitor or disinherited by his family, then again the Malfoy's loved him too much for that. He probably just didn't want to be the negative source of the rumor wheel.
"Not before magical fitness," Harmony said, "I guess I never really thought about it." She had always been so thin, and didn't think that bulking up would have even been possible.
"I burned holes in your head for years," Draco said, "I'd think that you'd be immune to it by now."
"Oh, he told me not to tell. You would be surprised at who it was anyway." Strange.
The afternoon classes had ended and many of the students lazed about outdoors. There were four more days of schooling until they would be going home for summer break. That was only four more days to learn Potter's secret. Draco desperately wanted to know. He stood outside his favorite teacher's office wondering how to go about and persuade him to obtain that book.
"Would you?" Snape almost yelled. The Dark mark, which he had seen most of his life, now settled with revulsion. Draco grit his teeth.
"What! Do you think that I will let you throw away your life! Draco, you must understand, you will be killed for being a traitor!" Mr. Malfoy's voice grew and ricocheted off the walls.
"You shouldn't be here," Harmony persisted. Sirius frowned, and Harmony could swear that she saw his eyes droop. She was still mad at Dumbledore for doing whatever the old man pleased, but the thought of Sirius close during the winter break certainly cheered her mood. "You should be somewhere else. I know a good secret room for you where no one will find you." Harmony smiled and Sirius joined her.
"Was that grizzly bear here before?" Luna asked, pointing to a statue against the wall.
Draco could not fathom why Sirius Black was there or why his father was on the verge of murdering a man.
"Are you recovered?" Snape asked expressionlessly, and Harmony nodded in reply, "then I shall return you to Hogwarts."
"So how did you manage that?" Blaise asked amused.
"It's not too late to repent, Riddle." Voldemort's eyes widened in an insuppressible rage.
"Draco? What is the matter?" Draco looked up to see Severus Snape, and it felt like his leg would forsake him.
"Sirius?" Harmony said in disbelief.
"The one that smelled like turnips who got dismembered from a bludger?" Ron leaned forward mouthing the word dismembered.
"He will definitely have a short life at this rate," Hermione agreed.
This time water engulfed him. Surprise struck Draco, and his immediate response was to lash out, splashing madly. He wasn't prepared for this. The water was frigid and something was sucking him further into the current. A wave went over his head, and he closed his eyes from the salinity of the water. He wasn't a good swimmer, having hated beaches and open waters. In fact, he barely knew how to swim. He broke the surface, to breathe, but water gushed into his mouth. The saltiness burned his throat, and his legs thrashed in all directions. He couldn't touch the bottom with his feet and he tried to keep above the waves. A cold dread was eating away at his senses. What was happening? His robes were dragging him down, and he struggled to strip them off. His wand hid uselessly against his belt, forgotten. Fear was making him desperate. He couldn't breathe. His arms scooped through the water, blind with determination. Draco's pounding heart demanded oxygen, and his lungs filled up with icy water. The current swept him down into the dark water, in different directions. He couldn't see, and his limbs were turning numb, losing the fight against the water. His head miraculously broke the surface, and he couldn't see anyone near him. Before he could call for help, a wave swallowed him like a rag doll into the sea below. Draco thrust his arms in different directions. Oxygen! He needed air! This wasn't how he was supposed to die. His arms and legs were limp under the water. This wasn't right. His eyes opened, and through the murkiness he could see light. His lungs ached with pain, and his brain was beginning to go numb. No. This couldn't be happening. He allowed the ocean to carry him. He wanted to live. He closed his eyes, hollow lungs now filled with water. There was no air. He was dragged further under, and the pain ebbed slowly away.
"That's limiting quite a lot. Plus why would I ditch one party to go to another?"
"Most indifferently," Kingscross chuckled, "now on the count of three, we'll all grab the key, the portkey." The students looked stunned, and comical with their hands poised for action. "One. Two. Three!" Draco internally cursed the professor for choosing such a small object for five people's hands, but thankfully his index finger had the pleasure of being crushed next to Harmony's. But then the nauseating feeling of being ripped out of space, and tugged by the belly to unknown danger, made the fleeting moment of pleasure forgotten. Which was also made up for when he landed not so gracefully on his bottom, with a limp Harmony atop his lap. He would have appreciated this if not for the headache pounding his brain.
"I just needed to talk with wonder boy here," He stressed the word and looked directly at Potter, "Till next year, and remember what I said about the glasses." He dropped the glasses on her lap and gave her a wink before passing through the door.
"What are those things?" Harmony asked as she saw a demon looking horse situated in front of the carriage that they were about to board. "They were never here before."
"Where are the ropes?" Harmony whispered to Ginny.
"At least your parents will be happy, thinking that she's a pure blood. Too bad it makes her your cousin now. You sure you don't want to pick another mass murderer to be her father?"
"Yes, sir."
"Then why haven't you smashed it?"
"... people die from untreated dragon burns." Draco ground out, slowly.
"Hmm?" Harmony shot a look back to make sure that Draco wasn't near. "What's wrong?"
"It's still unsafe to be out." Snape said, ending his censored mumbling. "I need to get Minerva, and Dumbledore will surely know by now".
"Oh really?" Harmony said, doubtful.
"I have something to discuss further with Leighton, I will see you all soon." Dumbledore said as they made their way to the exit. Leighton got up to open the door for them and as they passed, Harmony handed him the cloak that he had placed on her to keep warm after the dementor attack.
Leighton's mouth remained closed, and as he tilted his head, a shadow covered his eyes. "It's something that should never exist. It will grant you immortality, but it will also seal your damnation."
"You shouldn't." He's playing with you. "You don't love me."
"Face cream."
"Sounds great." Blaise said, amused that Potter had invited him to go see the school.
"No," Harmony said, "I'm grateful. You surprise me." she said.
"You have no idea how worried I was." He told her, quietly.
The next day Harmony came prepared. She wore her gym clothes under her school uniform and was almost glad to see Draco there. "Hello Harmony," he said, and Harmony rolled her eyes.
An unexpected loathing filled her up as she glared at her two friends. "That's enough," she said "get out."
"I could have still gone home, but when I sent a letter to my folks, I never got a response back." Draco shrugged his shoulders.
"But why didn't you come back?"
"I hate you guys," Ginny said with a smile.
"What the fuck are you talking about?" Ginny, disguised as Harry stated, and walked away.
"Ha ha, tell me really."
"No," Harmony frowned, "but we could put toothpaste on his mouth, so that they think he has rabies."
"Ok, we can appear as enemies, but lay off the severities of the insults. I don't particularly like to be scathed." She turned to the wall and grabbed one long rooster feather. On the lower shelf there were some newt egg shells that she needed. She then noticed that Malfoy had not moved since they had ended their conversation. "Are you going to just stand there, or help me?"
"I'd love to," he said and Harmony felt the warmth run through her.
"What do you think happened?" she asked.
He needed to keep himself in control or else he'd scare her off. Perhaps she knew just how bold boys could get, but he knew that she had never gotten anywhere near that close to a girl. The only thing close enough had been Granger's hugs and at the Yule Ball when she danced with Lavender or Patil, he couldn't remember which. He gripped his hands, and thought of the memories that he had come across as he made his way back to his bed. When he closed his eyes, the last thing he thought of was green watching him intently.
They said goodnight to Luna and continued on a different corridor. Harmony and Ginny walked side by side and just in case, she put on her glasses.
"Why didn't you ask for my help, if you were feeling so ill?"
He sat on that cold floor, and a cold understanding settled within him. It was his own trap he fell for. He opened his eyes, and directly across from him was a hole in the wall. Even though the castle was geriatric like a decrepit old dotard, it normally didn't have random holes. Any other time he would have missed it, but it wasn't so small, it was about the size of his head. He bent down getting closer. There was a strange light coming from inside. As he brought his body close to the floor, the hole began to get bigger till he could squeeze inside. Draco could see well enough and there was enough room for him to crawl as the path turned. It was strange though that he couldn't see so well beyond a few feet. But he was excited to find out where it ended. At last it came to an end. The room was red and grey, and too dark to really see. Lumos Draco said, but it came out as a squeak. He began to get frantic. He couldn't find his wand, in fact, he couldn't find his fingers! He scampered in a small circle, and discovered with concern that he had grown a tail, and had gotten very very hairy. He squeaked again, trying to call for help. He recognized this feeling. It was like when that crazed professor, Mad Eye, had turned him into a ferret. Draco stopped his body. It couldn't be. He whimpered, and fumbled in the dark.
"These articles," Hermione announced, "are completely twisting you, Harry. It's inconceivable how the Daily Prophet can just make up whatever it damn well pleases."
"It's just like that diary." Draco sat near Harmony and watched as her face imperceptibly softened.
"Leave me alone!" Tears hung from her eyelashes. He tried again to hold her, but she would have none of him. "I said don't touch me." She said harshly, and looked behind him to where his father was.
Harmony ignored Ron's glares, as she attempted to enjoy Ginny's birthday party. Inside she was all smiles; it was rather fun to torment people with minimal effort, no wonder the Slytherins did it.
"That's funny. Most people wouldn't say that dragons are beautiful." Charlie said, smiling.
"Hit puberty," Harmony shrugged her shoulders, "and became a girl."
Hermione raised her hand high above her head. Leighton nodded at her to respond. "It's just that we never had to use physical force without magic, what is the point for this task if we are witches and wizards?"
"How did you find me and how would you even know that I have class now?" she demanded irked at being snuck on again by him. "Are you stalking me?"
Draco liked this, "make me," he said softly. Harmony gripped her wand and jabbed it to his ribcage, making him grit his teeth to stop him from yelling out. "That was low," he whimpered and released her.
"I think nothing is wrong with him. I think he just wants to flirt with Harry here. Half the Hogwarts population wants to anyway, even the male ones." Came a voice from behind a glossy page.
"Don't tell me that I have to move back with the Dursleys." She said, unable to be patient. She could see it, her having her wand taken away and shut into that room for the rest of the summer. She could not trust how far the Dursleys change to her would mean. No. She would not go back.
"Are you daft? Why would you do that?" he could already see the explosion erupting his superb face.
"Professor Snape?" Draco asked sweetly, knocking on the door adjacent to the potions class.
"Then the future will tell what I choose, and for whom I do it for."
"Really? That's unusual," Harmony shrugged her shoulders.
"I sent them a letter," Draco said.
"It meant that the one with the only chance to subdue Lord Voldemort was born at the end of July, nearly fifteen years ago, whose parents had already defied him three times."
"Yes, but not for long. It seems like someone wants you to live."
"I see," he said, "So this is it." He shook his head. "I guess I made a fool out of myself, but I understand well enough." His eyes never left hers. "Bye then."
"If you must," she said, and they walked together.
"No, but I was engaged once. A fool in what I had thought was love." The professor looked down with a sudden intense focus on her cauldron burger. "After that I immersed myself into teaching young witches and wizards." Harmony was a little sorry she asked. It was uncomfortable thinking about her Hogwarts professor, who was wise and capable of phenomenal magic, as someone unable to find love. What chance did she, a nearly fifteen year old girl trapped in the semblance of a twelve year old boy have?
"Harmony, I'm sorry about what happened," Ginny said. Harmony clenched the bed sheets.
"Yeah, I punched some walls, tried to get it out."
He thought that he could lock away the image of Harmony and Leighton, but his mind thought otherwise. At the worst times, Harmony would be pressed against him and Draco would snap a quill or hex the nearest thing. When at last he saw Harmony, even as a boy, Draco wanted to push her against a wall and claim her lips as his. He would make sure that Leighton would never cross her mind. It took all of Draco's self control not to corner her, and even more control to stop worse thoughts from making him violent. He trailed behind Harmony with a scrowl itching his face. He did not have to worry about the Slytherins bothering him, because they very well knew what a cross Draco could do.
Harmony looked up at Draco's face to see him smirking again. It irritated her. "Why are you doing any of this?" Harmony inquired, wondering whether he wanted to make a fool out of her, or if he was serious. The tray came down, separating them. "What do you want from me?" Draco regarded her with a cool silence, deciding instead to sip his tea.
She winced as her forehead burst in pain. A foreign wicked pleasure of having killed someone drilled into her scar. A name swept through her head, like a passing thought. "Dumbledore," she hissed and got down to a knee. A blue stream of magic fired at them, and Harmony watched as it bounced off a hastily casted shield and returned to the sender. The man shrieked, with a wand to the dark mark, and Harmony was hoisted up. Her head still pounded, with the drumming all she could contain. She saw the headmaster, on the floor, with a charred arm bent back at an impossible angle. She didn't know if he was dead, and it took all her effort not to join in on Voldemort's uncontrolled glee.
"Alright, now three of you can go up at the same time," Madam Hooch said.
"To help Harmony," Draco said firmly. Severus had not anticipated this. He should have though, Draco was mostly on Harmony's mind. But was Draco safe? He looked at him, trying to read him without intruding. He saw the mistrust there, and knew that they had the same eyes. He nodded his head.
"Nope," Draco muttered, "clawed the raven." The wall opened and Blaise chuckled.
"It seems like you guys have mastered the basic healing arts. These will save you in a dire situation. There are more complex spells that trained medi-wizards know. But for now, we will continue with something new, Wizard Dueling. I heard that you got the basic outline two years ago, but I want to build from that. We won't go over the structure of wizard dueling, since most of the time you wont be able to stand around and take turns firing. So everyone knows expelliarmus, right?" Four heads nodded their heads. "Technically wizard dueling never incorporates any physical contact, though I like to throw a good punch whenever I can. It gives the element of surprise, and wizards aren't so used to close range combat, It cuts their reaction time in half and makes them think that they are fighting a mad man. Heck, if you get lucky, and have your opponent in a head lock, or arm lock, then you win." He looked at their unconvinced faces. "Don't tell me you guys don't know any physical combat. Wrestling?" They shook their heads. "You know how to punch right."
"Yeah, last night was amazing," Ron held Hermione's hand and brought it to his lips.
The ferret lifted a paw, and continued on, scampering faster now. They were heading up a few flights, and she had to carry it, when it nearly fell through the faulty step. "You better be leading me someplace, and not just getting us lost." The ferret stopped suddenly, and brought its nose along the wall. Harmony doubted that many students traveled this hall, if any. There was not much, but Harmony did amuse herself by watching a portrait of trolls receiving ballet lessons. The ferret was going back and forth along the walls three times now. Harmony was surprised to see a little door that she had overlooked, and the ferret pushed against it, and disappeared from sight. It was much too small for her, and as she crouched to fit into the tunnel like space, her shoulders hit the walls. She could see light from the other end, and the smell of flowers. "What the?"
"Do you not feel anything?" their professor asked. Draco did feel comfortable here, but he was reluctant to go further. This wasn't where his animagus form lived.
"Besides Poppy, those who would know would be Minerva and Sirius."
"Er, what?" Harmony asked, she must have misheard him. He reached for her hand and held it.
"Oh and I heard that you are a spoiled prat who thinks he's so great, but who really needs his cronies to act strong in order to hide his craven little self. I know so many people like you who enjoy belittling others and tormenting innocent people." Dud was turning an interesting violet (much like Vernon's infamous Crayola purple) and had his fist clenching and unclenching. "So, are you going to hit a girl too?"
"I will do anything to be with Harmony." Snape's eyes widened, as if he had not expected to see the truth so plainly in Draco's eyes.
"Of course," he said, "I am the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor."
Of course he had to be a bloody ferret, and the awful part was that he knew that it felt right. His chuckles came out as dooks. Perfect.
"If you want forgiveness, then earn it. It's up to you to continue to be with her, or not." Draco stared at Snape's hard expression with surprise. "But if you run away from her now, then you will lose her forever."
"Yeah, I wanted to give it to you. It's been in my family for ages, and it's said that dragon's blood or poison is at the center, I forget which. It's important to me so keep it close." They stood in front of the Great Hall, which was decorated with hearts and red ribbons. "Ready?" he asked. She took a deep breath and chuckled to herself. "Because we could still have our own party," he smirked.
"Harry, that wasn't acting! Don't you lie to me." Harmony couldn't believe it.
Luna and Draco were waiting for them at Moaning Myrtle's haunted bathroom. Draco had a frown as the ghost girl flirted with him, picking at his blonde hair. "Stop it," he said curtly and shooed her away as if she was a fly.
"Report what now?" Leighton said, staring down at Draco and not intimidated at all.
"Oh?" Ron laughed, "you can trust me, Harry." And though they were joking, never would she allow Draco's name to be reveled in such a manner to Ron. It would tear their friendship apart.
Draco stayed where he was, and ignored as Kingscross spouted his nonsense. He was reminded that he still needed to come up with a nick name for Harmony. He didn't want her to be referred to as Cub any longer. "And then you say expecto patronum. Any questions?" Draco looked up from where he leaned against the wall and picked at his nails. Harmony appeared to be worlds away as she stared blankly ahead. No one said anything, and Kingscross cracked his knuckles. "Alright, the begin."
"Ron, give it a rest. It's getting old." Hermione snapped at him, cutting him off.
"Castreo!" The Slytherins laughed as a spell caused a blow to her crotch. She winced, when it hit her, but otherwise it didn't leave her gasping on the floor with tears if she had been a boy. Crabe, Goyle, Pazy, Nott, and Blaise howled with laughter as Harmony glared at them.
"Er, right," Harry said as Harmony let go of his hand, "Draco."
Harmony's face fell as she thought of telling them about underwear shopping with McGonagall. What could she tell them? "Oh you know, Dursleys. The usual."
"I am so sorry Harry, I know that it will take along time to forgive me if you ever do."
They were ugly looking, and there ugliness multiplied in their sheer numbers. One elf in particular seemed happy to see them, and Draco saw in surprise that it was Dobby his old house elf. "It's Harry Potter," Dobby said cheerfuly in a high pitch squeal, "who came to see Dob...by," his smile fell as he saw Draco Malfoy. "Uh, Dobby still hasn't finished taking out the trash. Thank you Harry, for the Christmas present." Dobby waved at Harry, and ducked into the sea of elves.
Draco swerved around the field, and she realized that she never actually had watched him fly before. He flew with a grace that she did not have on a broom. While she flung and hurtled across the field, he knew how to make flying look effortless, elegant like an art. "Harmony," Ginny sent her back to the bleachers, "do you have good vision?"
"Wait, aren't you coming with me?"
"Harmony," Draco said, "I really don't know what's going on."
"Precisely Potter, and we'll do it for months and months till you finally get it." Snape looked sour as he thought of all of the time that that would ensue. Too long even for a sane man. "But perhaps Malfoy can help, or else give you incentive enough to hide something from him. A secret or something delightfully embarrassing. There is a lot, you know." Harmony turned red, and Draco wondered if the girl had lived half her life embarrassing herself. He wouldn't be surprised if it was true, by the way she glared at Snape. "Alright," Snape turned on him, "shall we go again?"
"What do you want?" Harmony asked, and Draco allowed the reality of her anger to wash over him and pass. He gave her a small smile, and though it wasn't the dashing ones he had been practicing for, it had to suffice.
"Draco!" He heard, just as the girl latched to his back, "I surprised you, right?"
"My name is Harmony Black. Bitch." Harmony stated, carefully enunciating the bitch, and glaring coldly as Voldemort gaped.
It was like Malfoy saw him there for the first time, like he was sizing him up and the odds were against him. He scowled and looked up at him; gray meeting honey, and overall dislike. Malfoy went into his robes and retrieved a small piece of parchment paper with tittles scribbled on them.
"It's OK," he said and Harmony leaned into him. She trailed her hands over the thick material of his shirt till she rested them at the back of his neck. Harmony could read the happiness in his eyes and she grinned back. Her head rested against his chest and she shut her eyes from the swirl of colors and students. She relaxed as she felt his arms around her, strong, and Harmony allowed the moment to sink in. "There's a photo booth," Draco suddenly said. Harmony followed his line of sight and saw that Collin had a set where he shot photos of couples.
She watched as a few of the first years cried, and Harmony wondered why she couldn't even muster one tear. If only it would rain, then something would be falling across her face. She crossed her arms, feeling the edge of her dragon necklace under her shirt, which ended a short ways above where the scar ended. Ginny took a step closer, and Harmony reached down and held her hand in her own, and neither of them cared if a student happened to look.
"Yes," Leighton said, and from his wand a clear mist in the shape of a bear barreled through the class. "This week we will begin the basics of the patronus charm." The bear circled the students head before dissipating into the ceiling. "Dementors feed on the positive feelings of their victims, sucking out all the happiness till they devour the soul. To counter this, a patrounus charm is a person's happy thought, memory, of feeling that cannot be taken away from the dementor and instead, dispells them. For those of you who already know the patronus, you can help the other students or work on a different project. Now I want you all to concentrate on the happiest thought that you can, something that fills you with endless joy. That is the most essential part of the spell."
"What has gotten into you?" He shook his head as if in denial, "there are rumors that you are friends with Potter." He spat out the last word with disgust.
"Alright," Leighton stood up and rolled his shoulder blades. "Let's call it a night," he said, "and don't forget to practice on your own time."
"When I go into your room next, I'll be sure to make my own impression on it."
"Bugger."
"And you will tell him," Severu's head shot up, meeting the headmaster's eyes. "But there is something else you must plant in him." Dumbledore pulled out a ring atop a hand that looked like it had been scorched and blackened beyond recognition. "Do you remember this?"
"It's ok, Ron, we're working together now." Harmony found the jar of chicken blood and emptied some in a flask. "This smells revolting," Harmony passed it to Draco, "you hold it." Draco took it and fastened a cork into the flask.
Lucius Malfoy walked over to the rubbish bin and dropped Draco's designer jeans inside as if they were nothing. "Why are you still with her?" His father asked.
"She would think how dreamy he is," Draco laughed, "I don't know, she's quite partial to Harry."
"I don't," Blaise shrugged his shoulders, "but it's still more interesting than school."
"You miss her too, Hedwig." Draco said. Hedwig caught his eye, and he saw the intelligence there and the mistrust. "Do you want to help me find her? You could help me tell her off for abandoning us." Draco continued. The owl regarded him silently, considering and then hooted in reply. "Here," Draco said attaching a short letter to Potter to the owl's leg. "Fly over the clouds, and I'll follow." He instructed. Hedwig hooted what Draco hoped to be an affirmative, and waited for him as he pulled his Nimbus 2001 out of his mokeskin.
"Hey!" she turned around to see that he was nowhere in sight. "Draco?" She went around in a circle before calling his name once more. There. She saw the tiny shadow of a ferret scampering towards the castle and laughed. Draco changed back and began to run a good few feet ahead, and though she ran till the white of the world swarmed around her, she could not catch up with her shorter legs.
It took him a few moments, but he felt the success as he grasped the cotton cloth that surrounded the bed. With an anticipating smile he pushed back the curtain soundlessly. And there was Potter. He scrutinized the boy, and nearly cursed out loud when he saw nothing amiss.
"Harmony, how many lessons do you have with Snape?" Ginny said quietly as they took two empty armchairs in the common room. The room was empty, save for a few 7th years snogging in a dark corner.
"Of course, Sly," he said.
"Harry, there is a time for many young adolescents, when their bodies start changing." One of Harry's eyebrows rose since he heard that line before, and he did not want to hear it from a shriveled old man. "It is perfectly normal for boys to start growing hair in new places and girls to start menstruating and developing. Are you following me, Harry?" Harry gaped at Dumbledore. No way was the other man serious. Sure Harry wasn't much grown and still looked like he was twelve, but he was not completely ignorant.
"I told you to be careful, but I guess Potter didn't get the memo."
"For as long as I choose," Snape snapped, "and these will be your partners. Longbottom," Snape almost shouted, making Neville jump in his seat, "work with Granger." Neville looked miles relieved, and Ron folded his arms across his chest. "Goyle," he boomed, pointing a long bony finger at the massive boy "and Crabbe. Weasley," Snape managed to spit out, "and Bulstrude." Ron looked stricken in his seat, anguish already mortifying his pallid face. He turned around to face the large girl named Millicent, who cracked her knuckles when she saw him. "Thomas, work with Nott. Parkinson and Brown." Pansy gave a little huff of disdain, she had wished to be with Draco. Harmony felt dread seep into constricting lungs, as if wretchedness loved to laden its victims with icy damnation. She shut her eyes. Oh, God no. "Zabini will work with Patil," Snape paused, practically standing over Harmony. "Malfoy…," Snape paused as if wondering if he really knew what he was doing, "and Potter." Her eyes ascended expecting to witness a livid sneer, but she caught only a glint of pensive listlessness in cave black eyes.
"Harry, are you OK?" Hermione sat next to her on the bed, and Harmony sat up leaning away.
Severus almost forgot the meeting he had with Harmony. He was sitting on his desk, absentmindedly. He frowned down at his hands, and saw that they were cracked and bony. He felt a pain inside, like he was missing something. There was a slight knock at his door. Harmony was right on time. "Come in," he said solemnly.
"Figures," Harmony said and the last of the students came in. Ron and Hermione waved at her and Harmony mimicked the gesture. She dully noted that Neville still had yet to show. Snape stepped into the room and glared at the children as if he had been eating a lemon drop.
"What ever it is, I'm not in the mood," Harmony traced the snake on the locket and drew the blanket over her head. Unfortunately her ignoring them would not make them go away. Instead they barged in.
Draco wouldn't admit it, but whenever he sat with Harmony in potions, or was in the same class with her, he got the feeling that more than one person was watching them. He deliberately didn't say anything to her, and pointedly looked elsewhere from the girl who looked like Harry Potter. They had to do something so that no more people would figure it out. Had anyone else realized? Draco looked to Theodore and hoped not.
"You said that you would dress up for me." Distress signals from Harmony's uncomfortable position mingled with signals passed through her brain, searching for a promise she could not have made.
"I was wondering if I could possibly…er…join this class." Harmony pressed her robes close to her body, almost wanting to shrink from all of their stares.
"Like hell you will," Ron spat, "we're not stupid."
"Never, my dearest bestest most handsomest friend of all these lands, would I ever be sarcastic to you."
"Oh, but I will," Blaise walked off, "you've been slipping up, Draco."
"I'll see you two tomorrow," Luna waved and took the path to the Ravenclaw dorm.
"Fine," he muttered through tight lips, but when Leighton told them that they were going to have fun in the snow, he really wished he had trusted his instincts and had turned away once their professor had uttered the word 'fun'.
"He's coming back, right?" she asked.
"Nah," she mumbled, "probably not."
"I'm not a coward, I just have a different level of survival instincts!"
The numbing cold began to dissipate and pain began to radiate to her limbs. She wondered if this could be comparable to a wizard hangover. There was the forming headache, the confusion of what just happened, and the overall dread that she was screwed for life.
"Well, then you can just look at the reactions of people. Take Snape for example. Have you ever noticed that when things went wrong for Harry, Snape tried to protect him." Blaise grinned as he leaned forward, watching Ginny closely.
"Right," Draco said unamused.
"Cool, where should we go?"
"Oh, I was taking my time getting ready, anything happen?" Harmony asked as she placed her head against the fine wood of the desk.
"If anyone is a rodent it's you and your family, you produce like them, and live in a burrow, what more can I say. Oh and Longbottom, someone reported a missing toad, you might want to find it before someone steps on it." Okay, so Ron was soon to explode with furry but thankfully left with Hermione. Neville then squirmed out to look for Trevor. Malfoy gave her a brilliant smile that she knew girls would be melted by. She knew that look though; she had given it to girls too.
"That's what I thought." Ron joined in on the smiling.
'I didn't know what girls like' was evident enough. She thanked them all and allowed Madame Pomfrey to drag her to her room for the check up.
"Thank Merlin for that hangover remover spell," Blaise said, and stretched out to grab some vanilla pudding. "How are you this fair morning?"
"Why," Ginny demanded, but shook her head, knowing that they were doing it in spite of Malfoy Senior, "when."
The rest of the day passed uneventful, and Harmony hoped that whoever was angry with her, would be satisfied. She just wished the Slytherins wouldn't be such sneaky cowards. She left the common room with Ginny who had been waiting for her. "You look bothered," Ginny said.
"You tricked us!" Harry vaguely heard Ron's outraged battle cry.
"Maybe…" Ginny mumbled. At the seat closest to the door, a muffled laugh came from colorful magazine pages.
Blaise sat at the Slytherin table and sipped his pumpkin juice, eyeing Draco who had one of those glints in his eyes. Like something brilliant was about to happen, well, terrible for others in most cases. He was about to ask what was up, when something caught his eye. Harry Potter was coming their way, and looking very much like a girl. Wasn't Potter at the Gryffindor table? He looked over and saw the boy wonder get up from where he was sitting. Blaise's jaw went slack. Two Potters?
"He said that when you were resurrected, you were incomplete, because something inside was missing, and in order for you to reach your full power, you would need these objects." Severus could see within the Dark Lord's eyes, something was flicking. "These objects, he said, were your downfall."
"Hey I didn't mean to upset you." Blaise said, catching up, "your plan worked, I think Harmony's secret is safe from the whole school now. You make a good Harry."
He made his lone trek back to the Slytherin house without seeing many students. He was still mad at her though and many of the students averted their eyes when he yelled at them for staring. He was glad when he saw Theodore, and even happier that he had his wand with him. Revenge felt sweet to him, especially now that he could use all of those new curses.
"I'll get you!" Ginny shouted. Harmony had forgotten that the girl knew the snowball chasing spell, and soon a ball of snow hit the back of her head, knocking the glasses from her face. She grabbed a fistful of snow and aimed it at Luna. The girl hopped away, and Harmony caught a snowball that Ginny had thrown.
"Because Albus has already left Hogwarts. If there is an attack-" she stopped her sentence and clenched her wand, "I fear the worst is yet to break in." Harmony could feel her Professor's thoughts as if they were her own. Her mind was miles away on a certain Dark Lord, and as Ginny stood next to Harmony, she had to stop her thoughts from turning dark.
McGonagall handed her a heavy package which she knew would be a textbook, and thanked her as well. On the table she saw a brown package and cautiously opened the soft material. She was marginally surprised when it was a bag from Margaret's Secret Lingerie store and could imagine skimpy dressed mannequins wearing flashing bright under garments and poor little Snape shielding his eyes from the bright colors. She took a few steps back, and held up a pair of light blue sock with patterns of kittens etched into them. She was so surprised since she had expected a bottle of rat livers.
"Micheal asked me, and I said yes," Ginny said.
"Leave NOW! All of you!" Voldemort shouted. "Find the intruders!" They flattened themselves against the wall, and watched as Death Eaters were driven out of the room. Her eyes turned to slits when she saw Snape among them.
"Hello lovely ladies." Someone's voice had penetrated her sanctuary. Harmony's eyebrow twitched. I will not think about the owner of that voice, I will not acknowledge him. Will not…will not.
"Ginny, that is so wrong. No, gross."
"What are you doing?" Harmony asked, feeling as heat tinged her.
"Potter won't tell?" Snape asked.
She stared in to the mirror and saw her hollow checks and blood red eyes. She hated this mirror, as if it laughed at her. She touched what used to be her nose and grinned with black chipped teeth. Disgusting, like a rotten apple. She touched the smooth surface, and her long nails screeched down her face. It cracked under her hands and a laugh left her lip less mouth. She had her three horcruxes, but not the locket. She had forced the poison down Peter's sorry mouth for nothing. How else was she supposed to be complete? Her scalp was like an ugly dead scull and melted with the white of her skin. "What are you looking at?" she screamed. "I will become the most beautiful!" The mirror fell to pieces and she screamed. Screamed and laughed till she woke up. Harmony shot up from her bed, and touched where she hoped she still had a nose.
Harmony concentrated, making sure that they were the only ones there. "Do you know where we are, at least?" Ginny asked.
"It's almost dark," Luna said.
"And leave you with it?" Draco said while watching the dog. "Hell no." Sirius was taking steps closer while growling. "What's with this dog?" Sirius jumped at Draco, ripping at his robes.
"No," Harmony said, "you don't." And she would show him.
"Now that we are all properly engorged, I am happy to announce the newest member to our Hogwarts staff." Dumbledore paused at the sound of half of the student population's uncontrollable fit of giggles and squeals. "This year we welcome Professor Kingscross who will be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts. I would also like to remind you that the following items are forbid-"
At three flights down, Harmony was led to the language labs, where foreign tongues could be learned. She followed close behind him, not straying too far or spending too long at any one classroom. "The last courses at this time are a free period study or a life management class." She frowned at her options and at the fact that Draco had stressed the life management course.
"The resurrection of my body has gone astray." His words hung in the air.
"Shh— Wait…Promised? And what exactly did I promise?"
"Move," she said in a low voice. She did not have time to be ridiculed by him.
Harmony almost cringed as the curtains billowed shut, revealing Snape, as he came from his new office. He regarded them slowly, as if they were a jaw of cockroaches that needed shaking to make sure that they still lived. Harmony gulped and looked at Draco who seemed to be elated.
"I'm not going to repeat myself, Kreacher, why is this locket so important?" Harmony asked as the house elf began to twitch.
"No!" Moaning Myrtle shrieked and jumped to the toilet, which erupted in a splash as the ghost disappeared in the pipes.
"I see you have dolled up for me, an improvement if I have ever seen one from you," Draco whispered as he rested a hand to her lower back. She wished that she wore a cloak or something to cover her thin pajamas. She glared up at him, at the darkness.
"Sirius!" she called, "Sirius!" Though she was alone in the bedroom, this was not the best place for her to freely converse with her very much still wanted God Father. So she draped the curtains that hung on her four poster bed and cast a silencing charm so that she could hear very little from outside her bed, and no one could hear anything that she would say. "Sirius!" she yelled out, with the mirror an inch from her face much like that of a telephone. She could hear the creak of a door, and the ceiling moved to a face whom she missed.
"My girlfriend, Harmony," Draco replied, "Sirius Black's daughter."
She trailed her wand against the wood of the door, sending her magic inside. She knew that there were four people in the room. As she took another step, she felt something down at her feet and lifted her foot. There was an index finger. Harmony leaned against a wall, sick. Something thudded against the door. "Why do you give me useless books! This does not explain ANYTHING! That Rat didn't know what he had to me, and I cut off all of his fingers till he cried like the filth he is!" The marble floors cracked inside and Harmony put her eye to the small key hole. Her eyes swiveled, not getting a clear view. As she focused on a bald white skull her scar seared. The top of Voldemort's robes were exposed, and she could see raw cracks in his skin, and black veins that spider webbed up his neck. Voldemort gestured at his chest. "And still he could not explain why this is happening to me! Why have I been given my body back, only for it to be falling apart! Must I go out to find the answer myself, do any of you care?" They didn't respond, "Useless!" Voldemort spat. "Where is Snape?"
She turned to her right, careful not to stray too far from Hogwarts. Draco must have anticipated that since she saw him at the corner of her eye. She shot further, making her way to Draco. It took only a moment before they were side by side, and again she observed his face and could see the joy clearly expressed. This time he noticed and returned the gaze in a lazy manner.
"Nope, I can't go in and introduce you like that, people may draw in connections relating us together. This is going to be so much fun! Here is the invisibility cloak and purse." Ginny grabbed her and stuffed the silvery material into Harmony's hand. "Now don't be surprised, you're actually in the girl's dormitory," Ginny laughed at Harmony's groan of disbelief, "Ah! Now how did you get Professor Snape to bend over his own detentions, hmm. Did you grab his cloak and get all close with wide eyes, or did you send him a love letter?"
"That rat." Snape spat in revolution, "…was this vision any different?" She thought for a moment, retracing the line of her scar.
"You're just upset that I caught you," Draco said, "turns out, that even the lion can be bested."
A yellow volume with gold lining caught his eye. He passed it though when he saw its title, Wizard Addictions and Overdoses. Reaching out for a tattered green book titled Wizards and their Little Problems, he leafed through the appendix. If anything the title amused him for he did have an affinity for short things, being one himself. He felt glad to note that there was a chapter on growing, puberty, and such, but kept going to see if there was anything for his specific symptoms.
"After you." Draco said with a hand that gestured out to the open window. He laughed that he was acting more courteously to Potter's owl than he had to any other living thing since Potter disappeared. But none of that mattered. If no one else knew where Potter was hiding, her owl would know; it was part of their own brand of magic.
"Alright," he said and looked at Draco.
"Yeah," he said, "you and me both."
"You know I can," she grumbled while steadily rising to her feet. She wondered why adults bothered to underestimate her, it only made her want to prove them wrong all the harder.
Once inside, Sirius popped into his human form to say, "We're having a meeting now Harm…y, see you at dinner."
Harmony sat next to Draco on the Hogwarts express in their own compartment, leaning her head against him. Her hair came down in waves to her shoulder, and her tanned hand held his. "Excited for your first day at Hogwarts?" he joked. She smiled back at him.
"What did Harry do?" Harmony asked in what she hoped was a neutral tone.
"Then don't say anything."
Harmony watched as the Great Hall door's opened once more, and Snape lead the Slytherins in as well. Harmony instantly spotted the platinum blonde hair, and relaxed her shoulders. She hadn't even thought of what she would have done if he was one of the missing students. His eyes raked through the sea of students till he found her green ones.
"You can let me down now." She could hear them running closer, and Harmony slipped from his arms to run to the cellar door. It didn't open when she touched it. "How do you-"
"Something tells me that even if I don't allow you here, you will still manage to slip in. Remember those who have joined today, that these lessons are for Cub and for her survival. None of you will use what I teach to harm other students." He looked directly at Draco, who did not blink. "If you fall behind, then you will have to practice if you want to continue. These lessons will not be easy." All of the students nodded their heads. "For the next two months we will begin something new. Step back."
"What are you doing?" Draco whispered with indignation. No Malfoy was treated as such.
"How long of a while?" Harmony searched his honey colored eyes, glinting gold in the torch light.
"Then you must guard your most personal memories well, or else i will know everything about you." Harmony opened her eyes, and watched snape. "I told you to empty your mind from emotions. Legilimens!" It was easy for Snape to pick at her most guarded thoughts. Sirius came in her thoughts, and Harmony failed from keeping her emotions in check. The more he came at her, the more anxious and worse she got at blocking him. She would think that she had nothing to hide from him soon, and Harmony couldn't believe that they were doing the same thing for months. All of her fears, dreams, happiness, and desires were open for him to see, and Harmony could still not block him. "Are you even trying?" he asked.
Harmony could see Draco getting to his own feet, watching the entire exchange in confusion. Their eyes met. Please, she thought, help Sirius.
Draco looked at Blaise as if the boy had slapped him, and then laughed. "Shite Blaise, are you high?" Blaise frowned.
"Very good," Snape said, "Weasley, return to your seat. Would anyone else like to try?"
"This is Blaise Zambini," Draco said.
Harmony looked taken aback, and took a few steps closer towards him before stopping. "The Great Hall is in a huge commotion, with everybody asking each other for a dance, I barely escaped from Ginny." The space between them seemed to be widening.
"Draco, you don't understand, Bella and Edward found true love." Harmony said.
"Yes Professor?"
"Thank you Professor," Harmony said and turned to leave.
"Dumbledore told me that if something like this was to happen, then he had something for you." They went to his office, and McGonagall said the password "Twinkies." The statue reared back, and a stairway opened up.
"I've already made my choice," Draco said with a cool composure. Death's grip of fear would no longer stop him.
"Thanks," she said as she felt the warmth that lingered there. Draco slowed to her pace and turned to her. "So, why are you here?" She asked him.
"How'd you get up there?" Ginny asked.
It wasn't until after she had packed her things away into Draco's mokeskin bag that Harmony began to feel nervous. She had to stop herself from laughing out loud; she had faced dementers, basilisks and dragons, she had escaped from and vanquished the darkest wizard in modern times, it was funny that she should be afraid of a trio of muggles.
"That was fun," Luna said when her lips formed.
"What the bloody 'ell is going on in here?" Harmony asked. Fletcher gave a wide grin and lifted both of his hands.
"Blimey, Malfoy is such a git!" Ron announced to no one in particular. "He can do what ever he damn well pleases, and they all act like it's perfectly acceptable!"
"Don't worry about Harmony, I'm pretty sure that she is alive." Blaise stated, as if it was a fact.
Draco waited till Harmony had magical fitness to talk to her. He sat on the bench that bisected the lockers and wandlessly clicked his faded gray locker open. She came in a creak and plopped her bag down before joining him. "So what's up?" she asked and took off her glasses and Potter guise.
"Let's just get this over with." Harmony pulled out the list of ingredients and Draco went with her to the supply room. Other students were milling around, and Harmony scrunched her nose as soon as they stepped in. "Why does it smell like earthworms and vinegar?" she muttered.
Dumbledore was human, and thus fallible. But this was madness. "Harry, your parents before they passed away, they didn't name you Harry, I just used that to fit with your illusion. They named you Harmony."
"You've made a mistake, Potter." Fletcher hoisted himself up and brushed his dust encrusted robes before fleeing the room.
"Change into your animagus form," said a cool voice from beyond the little door. Harmony banged her head in surprise, getting dust into her hair.
"Don't move, you may be hurt elsewhere." She closed her eyes and tried to keep her mind blank. She was gently poked and only winced when there was a particular tender part of her stomach. From the silence an angry growl bounced off the alley walls.
looking at them so happy made her smile. "Congrats," Harmony said.
But she was here for Draco, wasn't she? She didn't know why it mattered that she was there, but it did. Harmony caught Ron's disapproving eye from where he sat and smiled. They both knew who she wanted to catch the snitch. Harmony turned to Ginny, and wondered what she thought of Draco being close to her. Harmony didn't think that Ginny hated Draco, but the other girl definitely cared.
One of Snape's eyelids vellicated. He turned to the redhead boy and glared at him, superciliously, down his hooked nose. "Weasley, would you like a detention as well?"
"What was he doing here?" she asked, and saw that Harmony's blush had not left. "Harry!" She said none too lightly and then began to whisper in her ear, "did you change in front of him?"
"Thanks Sirius," and she meant it.
"You must be kidding." Harmony rolled her eyes before wiping off her Harry Potter face cream mask. She tucked away the glasses, and faced the other girl.
"You do realize that we must be over 70 meters up."
"What do you think would happen if I went into the Slytherin Common rooms?" she asked him.
"Why do you have to be such a prat, just get out of my way!" She pulled out her wand.
"Not exactly," he mumbled. He did not quite meet her eyes as he said that, and Harmony knew that he was holding something back.
It was bloody perfect. He knew that his girl had a bit of a thing for her friend. Some lingering feelings for what used to be Harry Potter. He knew that it would only take some gentle persuasion, perhaps the right circumstances to bring them to the surface.
"Agh," he cried, "don't. Please, Master. I don't know. I followed everything that I was supposed to." He whimpered in freight. "It must have been Potter, not me. Please. No more." Harmony was stuck. Where could she go? "Master? What- Who is there?" Harmony turned away from Peter, unable to face him.
"Or wrestle," Draco grinned, "though I'd have to win". Harmony scoffed at him, in reply. "Well, we should only do that if it comes down to it." Draco touched his leg to hers and she shrugged her shoulders.
"Well I hope you both know what you're doing." Draco forced his body to relax as he heard the two moving closer to him. Unfortunately, they stopped by his bed. He was tempted to fake a snore, but he knew that no Malfoy would ever make such an obscene noise, even when in sleep; much too out of character, even if he was a brilliant actor.
"The hell?" Harmony muttered. The stuffed statue started growling. It rose on its hind legs, looming over their heads. To Harmony's dismay, the bear wasn't as stuffed as she had hoped. Luna grabbed Harmony's hand. Ginny immediately turned to face the brown bear and gave a surprised yelp.
"When my Father came to collect me on Christmas, he probably meant for me to go to the Dark Lord and get turned into a Death Eater. Now my mum has to pay since I refused to do it." Harmony said nothing in reply, just listening to him work out his thoughts. "Maybe that's what happened to Theodore instead. His Father broke out of Azkaban, and wants to get up in the ranks, even if he has to offer his son to do so." He wondered if Theodore was already a Death Eater, but it explained a lot if he was.
Snape watched as the students left his room, placing vials of their potions on his desk. After class, Draco sat on the hard wooden chair that was besides Snape's desk.
"The Ministry of Magic will be here soon," the voice streamed through. Nothing seemed right, and her brain hurt as if when she was five and Dudley had stepped on her head till she howled her throat raw. She could remember running, but not into a wall. "Damn Ministry letting dementors roam free." Oh right, the dementors. She tried to shoot her eyes open, but they lazily rose to the murky gray lights. A hand brushed away the hair from her eyes and slipped away as if caught in the act. Harmony looked into warm honey irises that shown brightly against the cold gray of the sky. His eyes flicked to where her scar had to be exposed and on reflex she brought a lethargic hand to cover it. A bandage covered her hand and red marred white.
"Sir, I work in that shop down there," he pointed where Snape and Sirius came from, "and I stood by the window when I felt something amiss. I hoped that no one was out there, but I heard a shout. I couldn't help but charge out and cast a Patronus charm when I saw the dementors over this young lady. I was just bandaging her wounds when you came along." His eyes flicked to the dog as Snape continued to stare him down and nodded his head in slow reluctance.
From, Minerva McGonagall
"I don't know, but he was afflicted. Cursed."
"Oh." Harmony replied. But it wasn't until she exchanged some of the galleons for muggle money that she understood for the first time in her life how much money she really had. The weight of the money bag felt heavier than it had before, weighing down her pockets, begging to be spent.
"Ginny, nothing is going to happen, I have no interest in starting a relationship with anyone, male or female. I will be fine." Harmony stuck her chin in the air, attempting to jut out her jaw line in defiance. Which failed to look anything but petulantly cute.
"I can't believe this," Harmony muttered and read on. 'It was confirmed that ten high-security prisoners, in the early hours of yesterday evening, did escape. We strongly suspect that the breakout was engineered by a man with personal experience in escaping from Azkaban; notorious mass murderer Sirius Black, cousin of the escapee Bellatrix Lestrange...'
"What about Ron and Hermione, I can trust them with my life."
"Seriously," Hermione said, and Harmony cringed. "We are, er, here for you."
"How much are you willing to risk for this girl, Draco?" Snape's calculating look stopped Draco from answering too lightly. What were the lengths that he would go for another chance? For another kiss?
Fifteen minutes later the eleven of them were staring at two ordinary muggle houses on Grimmauld's place. Severus showed Harmony a paper with an address which Moody promptly burned, and when Harmony looked up from this display of arson there was a dark little house there that wasn't quite there before.
Harmony cradled Sirius Black's head and tears welled up in her eyes. Draco could not understand why. Here was the man who had sold out her parents and had tried to kill her, and Harmony whose tears fell upon him. Black was dead. But still Harmony clenched the man's robes and brought her head down to the dead man's chest. Draco felt a cold dread as he wondered why she looked as if she wanted to join him. Traces of Blood stained her clothes and he stepped closer.
"We could have our own party," he said.
"That's messed up," Ginny muttered.
"A bug," Harmony muttered, causing the others to look her way.
"I still want to try to be friends."
"I'm so glad that I'm not in the boy's dormitory anymore," Harmony said, "and that the locket is finally destroyed. I don't have to listen to any more of Ron's snoring."
Harmony's mouth opened as Draco began to lift his shirt over his head, as if he had planned it so that she would walk in at that right moment.
"To hell if I know," Harmony shrugged, "they'll think he hates me and that I really didn't give a damn about his class. I don't care so much either way."
"Yeah, though I was also warned not to go home."
She continued on to the Gryffindor fifth year bedroom. There was a brown paper bag that had her answer. She recalled the little mirror that Sirius had given her if she needed him, that he would be there. She went through her suitcase, not caring about the mess she was making as she uprooted her clothes and keepsakes. Her search was like digging for treasure, and soon her hands crinkled against the brown paper bag. She pulled it out and examined it. She could see the ceiling of a dark room. She tapped the mirror, trying to activate it.
"You two are getting really close," Ron remarked, "are you guys going out?" Probably it wasn't quite so smart for her to have the globet to her mouth again, because this time the juice did meet its target. "Because I'm fine if you are, you can tell me." Ron dragged his hand over his face and squeegeed the rest off.
"SLYTHERIN!" The sorting hat called out.
"Yep," she said, as they sat with her between them.
"Only a bit at first," Theodore rose to his feet from the comfortable armchair, "I'll do it free of charge too." Draco smiled and nodded, but when the curse hit his stomach, he felt something wrong. His skin was clammy and he his stomach was nauseous.
"No, that's not who I am."
"How do you feel?" Dumbledore asked with a smile.
He was shaking, and it took him a moment to notice that the Dark Lord, too, fell to the ground and lost consciousness. But Draco ignored him, and pushed himself up, crawling his way over to hilt of the knife was still entrenched in her body, and Draco couldn't leave it there. He felt his emotions surging to the surface, and tugging at the corners of his eyes and he pushed them back savagely. His hand slid over the slick blood as he pulled out the knife and tossed it to the side. He didn't think about how the ring on his finger that Harmony had given him turned dull like any other normal ring. He squashed the thoughts that she wasn't a mouse, she was Harmony. He pulled out his wand and began to murmur healing charms. The flow of blood ebbed, but Draco could see that she already had lost too much. Blood traveled back into the wound, and he noticed that part of her heart had been severed.
It was dark. A small boy sat with knees drawn to his forehead. He sat like that most nights under those stairs.
"It's perfect, no one will suspect me to be Harry."
"Let's go." Harmony said and held on to his hand as they made their way out of the dancers. They got on line and Harmony watched the dance floor. There was Ginny and Micheal with their hands in the air and jumping up and down. Harmony didn't know how the girl could do that in heels so high. "Hey it's Leighton." She saw Leighton with the other teachers with a glass of punch occupying him. Leighton pulled out a move or two when he thought that the other professors weren't looking. It seemed like there were a few girls going up to him for a dance, which he shook his head to.
Harmony contemplated what he said. "But what was stolen?" Sirius shook his head.
"Ok, what do you guys think of this," Harmony asked, "The mixture of unicorn sweat and fungus produces a mildew of such potency that when swallowed could make the drinker's pores open and shoot out rainbows of butterflies."
"What are you doing here? And how did you do that?"
"We could practice on branches or spiders," Ginny said.
Blaise:
"How?"
Ginny- New Year Adventure
Harmony really looked out the window then, and spotted him. She regarded him steadily, pushed her window open wider and motioned him on in. Draco pressed himself flat against his broom and flew straight through the window, into Harmony's tiny room. His dismount was shakier than his usually elegant style, and he took a moment to collect himself before turning to face her.
"Even the teachers are staring at you Harry." And sure enough they were. Even Snape had his black gaze set on her. She suddenly wished she could be Harmony, unknown, unfamous.
"You'll regret this," Ron spat. Before Ron could get a curse out, he was tied with invisible ropes that bound his arms, legs, and mouth. The students parted as Leighton hopped off from his desk and flipped his wand in the air.
Harry felt something amiss before being fully awakened. For one, blinding white had replaced the familiar red and gold, secondly Ron's snore could not be heard, and lastly there was an unblinking old man watching him sleep. He would have been completely freaked, but he knew that this old man had no hidden motives or intentions for him.
"And why did you listen to him?" There was a silence. Harmony began to feel a strange heat all over her face and behind her eyes.
"I feel numb." Numb from everything.
"That's because I am young, and the main reason I choose to look older is a matter between the headmaster and myself." The scratch on Leighton's arm disappeared. "Am I wrong to presume that you two, Ginny and Luna, will be frequent visitors."
"She looked so beautiful-" Ron got smacked by a blushing Hermione. "And I went right up to her," he continued, still holding her hand, "And asked for a dance. I tore apart each of her suitors too. Hermione was so impressed by me, that she could not get enough of the handsome Ro-" she smacked him once more. "And then I took her to the balcony, and we were all over ea-"
"Uh, Ginny," Harmony said as she looked at the bed and desk, "what the hell?"
'The Order?"
"Ok." She grinned, as she pulled him close and kissed him again.
It was like a billion hippogriffs ravaged his body at the same time, clawing and tearing, slashing and ripping every part of him. And all Draco could think as the pain took over his body was that he had failed, and his mother was dead. Thinking of his mother was worse than having the locket pressed against him, worse than the crucio and Draco locked the thought of his mother into a dark corner, so he wouldn't drown in it.
"No!" Severus nearly shouted, starling the two standing, "right now you need to concentrate on blocking him out, and protecting yourself. You do not need to worry about anything else." He gripped the arm of his chair. "It is getting late," he seethed.
"True," Harmony said, "but they could still hex me."
She couldn't think; where the hell was her wand? She felt dejection and misery fill her. A second Dementor rasped a sucking breath as she turned to flee. "LUMOS." She shouted, not knowing where her wand was. She wasn't sure if she saw a light. She heard high pitched screaming as they got closer to her. This couldn't be happening. She felt for a door, hoping that one would open, that one of these people would hear her. She couldn't breath. She choked on a scream.
"Anyway," Ginny interrupted, "are you sure that you can't come home with me for Christmas?"
"He should be fine, the spell gradually wears off, and Poppy took out enough numbing potions to take down three bumbling muggles."
"But still we are wizards, not barbaric muggles. We need to develop our magic," Theodore Nott retorted.
She huffed in relief when the front door didn't swing open and push her off into the hard concrete. "Is that a flying carpet, Professor?" she asked with amusement.
"What do you want? I don't feel like arguing right now." He obviously didn't want a fight, cause then he would have brought Cabbe and Goyle to do it for him.
"Watch it Potter, or I'll have to give you detention one of these dark and lonely nights." Malfoy said with a flick at his new prefect badge.
Once under the cover of the forest, a hawk flew over the trees following the ravaging fire that went straight into the mountains. She hoped beyond anything that Harmony wasn't lying somewhere in the dirt, charred black. When the trail of scorched trees ended, Ginny saw with her hawk eyes Lady Voldemort's corpse. She scanned the area, circling around, catching the glint of familiar round glasses.
But there was one pressing emotion that wouldn't go away, and he examined it with curiosity. He loved her. It was a strange time to discover it, but it was the only thing he was sure of right now. He touched the ring that spiraled with an auburn brown color.
"I kid, but really I'm a girl." Dudley stared at her oddly.
"In a dream, I saw it," the torches flickered a misty gray as they passed. It was Peter Pettigrew who was locked up the last time she was there, she didn't want to imagine the students or Narcissa in a similar state. They rushed forward, till the main hall underground opened and leveled out. The ceiling extended to a dome shape and an oculus streamed in light from above. "I don't hear anything," Harmony whispered. They stopped, and Harmony stepped closer, trying to see if there was anyone behind the enclosed cells.
"Okay then. I know a little listen will cheer you up." Fred said holding up a pair of mutilated ears.
Severus Snape sat at his desk for awhile longer. He did not linger through the halls, watching for children to give detentions. He hoped that he could right things, that the Dark Lord's wrath would be away from the girl. And though the blackness would always remain, there was still a light that touched his heart.
"Peter Petigrew."
"Yeah, like what?" Hermione asked.
As he walked through the halls, it didn't hinder his mood that he couldn't actually see her whenever he wanted. Draco had the letter addressed to his father and he chose a random school owl, figuring that his eagle owl may be intercepted. He gave the owl a treat before sending it off, and Draco hoped that his parents would respond. He hadn't heard from them since Christmas either. Anger had stopped him from sending them anything since then.
"Er," Harmony muttered, "right."
"Horcruxes," Severus repeated, and Voldemort glared at him, "so if the missing parts of you were to become whole once more, then your body too."
"This time you must go!" Ron said to Harmony, "and I don't care about whatever Professor Snape says."
Draco was surprised at his self-control. Perhaps all of the mind exercises controlled his emotions, but what ever it was, Draco decided that it was good that he hadn't acted rashly. He knew that she wouldn't have him if he were acting like a child. She would think poorly of him for interrupting her. Kingscross would probably laugh at him, and Draco knew that he wouldn't be able to best him yet. Draco had to wait, even if it tore him apart.
Draco sat across from her and still the girl stared out determinedly at the white scenery. "Harmony," he said, "look at me." He hadn't expect her to look at him like they still hated each other. "I'm sorry, I couldn't help you." Draco wanted to get closer to her, but her eyes stopped him.
"Sure," Draco said. "Crabe and Goyle sleep in the dorm room. Blaise and Theodore's rooms are down that hall." When Draco opened the door the first thing that hit her was the smell. It was a boy's room all right, as if they had sweat in the sheets and had failed to wash it. She knew that smell, it radiated off Duddley like dribbles of mayonnaise. They must have snuck some food in there as well, because something sour and overripe permeated through the room.
Ginny, who sat next to Harmony, tipped the photo so that the picture of Draco kissing Harmony during the Valentines dance was there for everyone to gawk at. Ginny stared, open mouthed, before snapping her eyes in his direction. Now it was his turn to laugh as her friends glared at him. "What is this?" Weasley asked between a glob of pancakes.
He smiled at her, and Harmony felt some of her anxiety quiet. He looked sleek in his black fitting dress shirt and pants. He had a smirk on his face as he turned to her. "You look incredible," he said, "absolutely perfect."
Mr. Malfoy picked himself off from the floor and wiped the trickle of sweat from his brow. "Sirius Black," he said, ignoring her, "it's a pleasure to see you." Harmony hated the smirk on the man's face, and wanted to rip it off.
This could not be happening. What was Professor McGonagall thinking? She was not going to go tell her deepest secrets to them and expect some 'family' bonding. She had been expecting to leave that very day and had kept to her room. How was she going to hide her face for another day without looking like boy Harry? The spell would only last for a few more hours at least and she had no way to use magic to conceal her face.
"I am busy," Snape said through clenched teeth. He saw her disappointment, and he nearly bit his tongue as he shouted, "detention!" at her. "Be here in my office at 9 o'clock sharp." Harmony hid her bright smile as she took a step away and the door slammed behind her. She failed to notice the ferret by her feet and nearly stepped on its tail, and only realized its presence when she heard an angry hiss.
"Thanks Ginny," Harmony whispered as she was pulled into a hug. She caught herself smiling uncontrollably, and the pressure and tenseness that she held within eased.
"Someone I might know?" Draco nodded and Pansy smiled. "Me?" He laughed loudly, and wouldn't look at her for the rest of the ride. He didn't want to lead her on, now that he got new prey to feast on. He couldn't wait for next year with Potter girl, and all the ways he could torment her.
"Unfortunately I cannot leave the flat without Snivellus stepping on my tail, so I may have to bum around here."
There was something amiss about the place Harmony had drifted to. The air smelled of smoke, and a heavy fog masked the long twisting trees, and blotted out the rising sun. Gusts of oncoming winter caused the trees to groan, and branches whacked against branches. There were no animals, not so much as a bug or a bird in the sky. She followed a cobbled road with an iron fence. Peering through was a stone manor. It was beautifully designed, and had pillars that curved like snakes, ready to engulf the roof. Her feet crunched over brown leaves, over stone steps. She watched the manor as she headed towards the entrance. Everything was too white about it, that the unlit interior made it look hollow. When Harmony stepped through the door, she half expected alarms to go off announcing her. She trespassed unnoticed.
"What? Done so soon?" Sirius pouted, but waved back, "Alright, but remember what I said."
Snape glowered at Harmony, "Of all the arrogant, idiotic plans, even you should have known better than that. What were you even doing there?" His look turned from dark to livid, when he saw that the girl didn't even seem to be taken aback.
"Sirius, control yourself," said a very curt annoyed looking Snape sounding as if his mouth had been washed with sulfuric acid, which might have actually happened, considering the fact that Sirius and he were both alive in the same room. She put a hand on the large shaggy dog and quickly closed the door behind her. With the sound of a click he reverted to his real form and hugged her tightly.
"How long have you been eighteen?"
"A snake threatened will strike back."
"He's never given me a detention," Draco said as he leaned back into his chair.
Draco only saw her once before she left on the train. He had asked Snape if he could go with Harmony back to where ever she was going, but he told him to stay. He wasn't even allowed to ride the Hogwarts express with her, so Draco stood waiting on the platform. The snow had picked up and he stood ankle deep in snow. When Harmony came, she had dark circles under her eyes that matched his own. Snape and McGonagall escorted her, and Harmony barely looked at him. He wanted to hold her tight, and see her smile. He didn't care that the professors watched him as he handed her a small velvet bag. He didn't seem to notice that his hair was messed up, or that he wasn't wearing a jacket. All that entertained his thought was Harmony. He wanted to tell her Merry Christmas, but he knew that if he opened his mouth, he would tell her not to go. She looked at the black bag silently before reaching into her own robes and retrieving a pair of bundled up socks. She passed it to him unceremoniously, and Draco felt his hopes rise besides the fact that he was given a pair of worn and fraying pair of socks. She left before he could say thanks, just passed him without a word. Snape looked back at him with a frown as Draco gripped the socks in his hands. He hoped that she wouldn't throw his gift away.
A voice stung through Harmony's thoughts.
Hermione's hand flashed up, and Snape called on her. When the other girl faced her, Harmony felt even more awkward. She only hoped that Hermione wasn't doing it because she embarrassed her precious Ron. When Snape nodded for them to begin, Hermione waved her wand and a binding spell was sent her way. Harmony deflected it, and the spell ricocheted to the floor.
"No; I don't like to read the Daily Prophet."
"See the game, Harry?" George asked.
The story of Regulus Black switching lockets stayed with Harmony all through the night. Each time her eyes closed, Black would be there, dead and so much like Sirius. You must destroy it! Or the red eyes of Voldemort would show Kreacher choking on poison. But what was the locket? The locket rested, heavy on her chest and she clenched her hand around it. Whatever it was, she imagined it to be Voldemort, splintered and destroyed. The Black brothers would be avenged.
He took a few long strides and held her close. "You don't have to do this. We could escape together." This was why she hadn't wanted to see him. In his arms it was almost impossible to tear herself from him. Draco had one hand trailing through her short hair, tenderly, till he slipped her glasses off, hooking them to the front of her robes. His eyes shown like steel with a glint of something more and irresistible. Yes would have been the easy answer.
"What are you doing here?" These words came from Sirius's mouth, but to Harmony it didn't sound like him. They were words from the mouth of a drowning man.
"Harry," he said, "you haven't been yourself, this isn't you. You can come with Hermione and me."
Draco awoke with upturned lips as the prior day's events played back in his mind. He was sure that he was a step closer to Harmony's heart, and as he washed his face, he touched his flawless skin. He didn't think that she could resist him much more longer. He could barely resist himself as he smirked into the mirror. He felt his sore arm muscles in satisfaction, knowing that they were more defined.
"I've faced worse," they stepped through the doors and the Great hall looked like cherubs had spewed out hearts, roses, candy, and strings. A fountain with a statue of a cherub on top had punch spilling over, which Harmony could recall was most likely tampered with by Fred and George. Music came from a band, and already couples were dancing on the floor. Harmony met Draco's eyes as they made their way through the throng of students. Her palm prickled with warmth as he held her hand, and she gulped as she saw students pressed against each other or getting smashed by the punch. There were the few who snogged in the corners, and Harmony couldn't stare for too long. "Er. So what do you want to do?" she asked.
"Yes, Tom's," Ginny almost whispered, "in my fist year." Harmony's eyes widened as unseen memories played behind her eyes. Draco did not know what any of that meant, but he shivered as Harmony whispered Voldemort's name. Harmony put a hand to her scar and shut her eyes.
"Blaise, this is really strong." Draco commented, staring at the drink. He then noticed the three empty glasses next to him, where Harmony had sat.
"Are you alright?" Draco asked her.
"How much are they?" she asked, drawn to the plain looking rings. She had given most of her money to Ron, and hoped that she had enough. As she looked at these rings, she could imagine the cool gray metal. The old man straightened his back and smiled. He knew that he would probably not sell those rings in his life time. Though he did not look it, he was quick with counting money. He knew that he had given the red headed boy 14 Sickles and 3 Knuts back. So at least he could make that much.
Harmony got bored watching the game, and trailed her eyes on Draco. She needed to fly with him again, and maybe snag a snitch so that they could compete. It was much more fun than actually playing quidditch. They could practice getting better without their teams, and fly without hands, or ride it with only their feet like a surfboard. Harmony snapped out of her thoughts and realized that wasn't what she was supposed to do. She shook her head and knew that doing those things with him would make her like him more. Harmony couldn't afford that. She couldn't lead him on like that either.
"No that was yesterday." They both had constipated looks on their faces and Draco figured he would spare them the trouble.
"Yeah, I'd love to," Harmony said, surprising them all.
Draco shook his head, amazed at her stupidity. "You can't just add anything you want, the properties of the potion react specifically to what you put in."
Dean asked, "what is your happiest memory?" Leighton grinned back at the boy.
"What do you want?" Potter sighed "I don't feel like arguing right now."
Snape really wanted to intoxicate Malfoy, and the man walked over to Harry who scampered back to his bed. Luckily, Madam Pomfrey didn't force him to down any more potions which would have been a choking hazard. Snape withdrew an orange bottled potion from his robes and dangled it between his long fingers.
"You already gave it a lot of thought. Perhaps I should hex your room as well, so they can't entirely blame you on it."
"Shortly before the time of your birth there was a prophecy made, and only I know its full contents. Voldemort found out about it, but not all of it. He wanted to kill you before you were to become a great threat. I am certain that he desperately wants the entire prophecy, and that is why it will be hard to tell your friends. He wants the knowledge of how to defeat you. I believe that you are ready to hear it now. In a room above the bar of the Hog's Head Inn I was seeing an applicant for the post of Divination." He took out his pensieve and with his wand withdrew his memory into the basin, instead of going into the memory, he tapped it with his wand and the figure of Sybill Trelawney emerged.
"Yes, but Voldemort did not hear that far. That was why I asked your parents not to tell of your birth or gender to just anyone. I was unsure if the prophecy would apply to you, since you were a girl, and because there was another with similar circumstances, Neville Longbottom."
"Alright, Draco," Harmony said, "just try to keep your eyes to your self. I like my privacy."
"Keeping secrets now? I didn't think that you could contain yourself, just be careful you don't hurt your friends like that. Wouldn't want that now." Malfoy cast an air of his usual hubris. "But I don't mind if you keep our encounters secret."
"What the bloody hell!" Draco and Harmony both turned to see Ron pointing at them in disbelief. "Is anyone else seeing this?" Draco frowned at the red head.
"What's wrong with you, Malfoy?" she didn't know that she had said that aloud. Someone had cursed him because he never had tried this on her before; unless he was that desperate for some action. He rose from his seat with one hand blocking her escape route to the door. His other hand brushed against her jaw line to her glasses making her skin tingle from the small caress. She saw his face clearer now that the fake lenses were off and he was mere inches away. He bent close to her ear and the air stopped in her throat. What the hell?
Draco heard talons hit the forest floor at his side and turned to see those wide unblinking eyes focused on him once again. She had eaten that mouse rather quickly. He pulled himself back to his feet, and back on to his broom. "I'm ok." He said, as the owl stared at him. With one powerful thrust of her wings, Hedwig was off the ground and heading back high above the clouds. Draco shook his head at the quick pace of the bird, "I'm not ok." He muttered darkly and charged off after her.
"I think Luna is cute," Ginny said holding her own arm out and Luna leaped on her, to her head. Draco though, thought the creature creepy looking with its blue eyes. It stared at him and gave a small high-pitched rumble from her throat.
"Get, off NOW!" Harmony screeched with a shove that did nothing. George stood up quick.
"You two better hurry up, you don't want to be late for our next class. I heard that Professor Snape finally lost it."
"Good," Blaise said, "you won us the game." Draco shrugged his shoulders, like it didn't matter. "You are different," Blaise commented, " I didn't take you for such a romantic."
"Sound it out." Draco encouraged.
"If you are wrong Theodore, you are so dead." Theodore just laughed and continued to read whatever book he had in his hands. Draco's legs were already weak, and he motioned for Crabbe and Goyle to be his walking sticks. Draco's eye sight began to get blurry and a headache pounded in his head. He didn't know how long he walked for before he felt like collapsing.
"I didn't know."
He couldn't see Harmony's eyes, but could still practically read the words that must have been floating around her pretty head. She was going to be a human sacrifice. She was going to die for him. "No, Harmony, don't." He said. This couldn't be happening. He couldn't lose his mother and his girlfriend on the same day.
"What?" Harmony said a tad too loud and ducked her head, "really?"
"You tricked us!" Weasley growled. Draco's smirk was even smugger.
"Strange," he said and really looked at her eyes. Eyes that he could have sworn he had seen before. He stepped to the girl with confidence.
"Er. Thanks?" Harmony stood up and the weasley twins leaned against each other. "I'll see you guys around," Harmony said. Before she made it to her room, Ginny pulled her aside.
"Draco and I," she started, not meeting any of their eyes, "are no longer fighting."
"You are an insufferable arse." He gave her a bit of a sneer.
By the time he arrived at the stone steps of the owlery, he was alone. There were only a handful of owls left, the rest about to board the Hogwarts express along with their owners. Even his eagle owl was gone, not yet returned from the trip to his father, claiming that he would be staying at Hogwarts over the summer. The owls there were an assortment of Hogwarts school owls. Except for the one snowy owl that remained, sulking in the corner. Quietly, he approached her.
"That's good, though I heard what happened earlier. You know who did it?"
"Thanks Draco," she said and put the glasses on her face. She stuffed everything into her bag. "Make sure you see all of their reactions," Harmony said.
The room darkened. All side conversations deceased. Like tomb stones in a grave yard, Students stood straight and rigid in their seats. A door in the front creaked and Snape gave them sour looks as he emerged from the black room. His inky eyes narrowed. He had anticipated at least one parchment ball to have been thrown across the room- if not a swarm of salivated miniature paper balls to be dotted across the walls and at Gryffindor faces. He stood squarely at the foot of his desk, not particularly liking the view. His eyes lowered to that of Harmony, and gave a slight twitch. He wondered why there wasn't a commotion, this was his most troubling class. Then his vision traveled past her head to the back of the room where Malfoy sat, something dawned to him.
Her wand alarm vibrated, announcing the stroke of twelve. Harmony clamored from her bed to leave the room.
"You look lovely in a dress." Oh God, she was turning pink in humiliation.
As if Harmony's life wasn't complicated enough. The past fourteen years of life as a boy was relatively simple. But ever since that psycho-murderer Voldemort stole her blood, and she became a girl, everything changed. How was she supposed to like girls after that? How could she ever be with a man? She scoffed at that. No one would want her.
Draco's focus was so engrossed, that he failed to notice the two girls who were with Harmony, even though Ginny wore a phoenix inspired dress, and Luna a cupcake costume. He didn't care to think that he looked like a fool, standing and staring while bodies moved like smoke around him. His world was gone, and she remained. The music changed to a quicker beat, becoming less formal. People were asking for dances, but Draco couldn't go to her. He wanted to get closer, to look into her eyes, and know that her gaze was only set on him as well. But if he were to catch her attention, then all of his insecurities would trouble him. She was perfect by her self, and did not need to be marred by the lies that he fed her, and that were destroying him.
The bottom level was a maze. All along the walls were doors evenly spaced apart by two feet. Some of them had little engraving that were far too cracked to read. The hall divided and when she took her wand to point her the right way, it took her further down the sloping hall. Torches with blue light lined the floor. She took another turn, and knew that if she had to run back, she would instantly be lost. The doorknobs that she tried were mostly fastened, and the ones that opened were empty save for straw on the floor and chains hung from the ceilings. A faint gray light came from the space where a door and the floor not quite touched. The air swelled with a mist that had nowhere to escape.
"The potion," Draco said.
Harmony and Dragons
"Now is the last and most important part," Ginny said and got Harmony to sit at the desk.
The spell on Harmony dropped as she stared at Mr. Malfoy. She did not gain the satisfaction she thought she would have. She felt hollow and as she stumbled to Sirius. Her body was drained. "Sirius," she whispered and put a hand on his chest. A part of her still hoped, but she knew. Knew that the very last part of him was leaving, and he would be dead.
It was the isolation that scared him, and it was worse than the time before being a wizard was a fairy tale. Harry Potter was one of the most famous wizards alive, and the prospect of everyone knowing would be unbearable. He wondered what his friends would say. Ron was his best mate, but sometimes he could be the biggest arse pain ever, even to the point that he would think this sex change was a ploy for attention. Hermione would try to help, but Harry knew that no words could help him now.
"Ron!" Hermione blushed, "I think that Harry gets the point."
Draco reached the Medic wing and shifted Potter's weight to one arm while opening the door. "Madam Pomfrey," he called out. A light poured out from under a door and a woman with the official wand and phoenix medical badge came out.
"Draco!" Harmony reprimanded, joining Ginny and Leighton. "He is a friend and is helping me with extra lessons to defeat Voldemort. This has nothing to do with you."
"Dash," Harmony corrected herself, "where is Dash?" The Professor pointed above his head, where there was an upside down girl with long hair who hung from the rafters. His pointing hand waved to her.
"Going to Divinations today?" Neville asked, as he tried to regain his composure.
"OK maybe I don't hate you two that much."
"Show me."
"Hmm, so you want to fight in the war." Dumbledore mumbled with a twinkle in his eye, which no one could see from the faint candle light. There was a knock at the door and it swung open. Sirius sprung from Harmony's side and tripped the man at the door. Dumbledore cast a wordless lumos spell and lit the room to see a fallen grumbling Snape and a grinning Padfoot on top of him.
"You should come, Fred and George are spiking the punch, and it's going to be a lot of fun. Hermione doesn't want you to be so alone and miserable."
"Who was he- the one receiving the Dark Lord's wrath?" Snape pried.
Her neck arched as she lifted her gaze to meet his, and stopped. A pale light that seeped from a window glistened against his skin. He stood above her with a hand reaching down and Harmony marveled at his incandescent skin. He smirked as she grasped his hand and pulled her closer, till their bodies nearly touched. For a moment too long they stayed like that. And as if realizing it, he broke the contact. "You're- you're..." Harmony started and Draco's smirk grew, knowing that he was too irresistible for his own good, "sparkling."
"But Harmony, we have not even gotten the panties yet." Ah hell, someone kill me now. She did not just hear McGonagall saying panties. Ewwww.
Without hesitation Leighton raised his wand a muttered the charm. A large bear cascaded from his wand and bounced off the walls till it disappeared to a misty glow.
"Alright," she met his grin with her lips, "you can be with me, so long as it's when I'm not looking like the boy who lived." Draco pulled her into a hug and touched her short cropped hair. She couldn't believe that being with someone could bring her such joy. The tightness in her chest returned as she felt him against her with his warm palms now brushing her back. Their lips joined and Harmony still had to reach up as they kissed. She was almost surprised that the lip gloss wasn't all over him and she thanked Ginny in her mind.
Fletcher gave a nervous laugh and got behind a kitchen chair. "Ya don't believe this thing, right Harry?"
"Don't hurt her," Draco said, "she is nobody."
"Exactly. You don't have to go there with anyone, if that's what is holding you back." Draco watched her closely. "Unless you really want to be alone."
Draco looked over at Voldemort and didn't know if his predicament was permanent or not. Even now, some Death Eaters had turned to their master. Without looking at his father, or wondering what he would do if anyone tried to stop him, Draco scooped Harmony up in his arms, holding her gently to him, and unstunned the Hufflepuff students by the wall. Three of them scrambled to their feet, shaking with fear, and Draco gestured them over. He didn't even have time to say his farewell to his mother, as he passed all of the searing eyes and left the room.
Harmony wanted to pull a prank on them, then laugh and laugh till her head hurt. At the library with Ginny and Luna, she thought of all of the things she could do. When she started to draw pictures and diagrams, Ginny gave her input.
"Whatever happens, your family will do everything they can for you."
"Er, two times a week," Harmony said.
"Yes, thank you dear, of course." Madame Pomfrey said, even more suspicious at the gentle manner with which Malfoy placed Harry Potter on a hospital bed. And the sudden manner by which he left. Draco's plans of spying were forgotten for now. What in the world was he doing, voluntarily touching Potter?
But it wasn't like Harmony was in love or anything. She was just friends with Draco, and only happened to like certain things about him a lot. Things that she hadn't thought about before in anyone else. Harmony quit that line of thinking as a certain voice reminded her that she shouldn't be fooling around; like she would ever be in a normal relationship anyway. She'd have to give up a big part of herself is she'd ever be in a relationship with anyone, and she doubted that she would ever tell the person that she had been a boy for 15 years of her life. That wasn't something that guys thought alluring in a girl, and Harmony shook her head at her limited possibilities at happiness.
"Fine," Harry replied "except for the fact that I'm here, though I don't know why." Harry felt fear envelope his mind as he pictured all of the possibilities for his pain. If Dumbledore was there then it must be Voldemort related. Harry shivered as he thought of how Voldemort violated him by taking his blood in the graveyard. "Tell me, is there something wrong with me."
"Beats me," Harmony said. She looked up. "Is that Devil's snare?"
But he didn't.
Harmony had never been in the kitchens at night, and was surprised to find it empty. "Dobby?" she called in the silence. A velvet blue light emptied below a door she had never been in, and when Harmony slid it open, she saw hundreds of rows of beds, stacked up like shelves on a book case. "Dobby?" Harmony called quietly again. She gave a start when bulging eyes of dozens of elves opened. Ginny, and Draco looked uneasy, as Harmony stepped further inside, like it was a parted sea. The house elves probably never had company at night, they stared at her. "Is Dobby here?" Harmony asked.
He wished that he could tell someone, but that would have been absurd. He just couldn't tell his Father and Mother that Harry Potter had turned into a girl and now he was dating her. He would have to send them a lie about the girl, because he knew that they would hear about him and the girl soon. One of the Slytherins would say something. Plus he had to assure them that she was pure blood or something. That would be the first thing that they would ask.
"Something the matter, Draco?" she whispered. He had watched her lips move, and though they weren't as heart shaped as when she was a girl, he still found his stomach reacting. Her voice was the same. He shook his head. Yes, he thought, this is a mess.
"Whom else would it be from?" Draco Malfoy asked with a twist of his lips. "So you better be going, because I will be hunting you down if you don't. I swear I will haul your arse there if I have to."
Draco decided that being in a secret relationship was only fun if it stayed in fact secret. Draco didn't want to kid himself if he thought dating Harmony would be easy. First, he could only flirt with her when they were alone. Second, though most of the day they spent together they had to pretend that nothing more was between them. Well he didn't want the press to hammer that they were gay for each other. He wanted Blaise to stop smirking at him whenever he said something to Harmony in class. Theodore wasn't helping either, the way that he gave them the drop dead glare, like he was a blood thirsty vampire, every freaking time Draco happened to look up.
"It changes," she said, and he stepped closer to her. "Sometimes I think of my parents, or my friends, of Sirius," she hesitated on the last name, "it's all different." Draco nodded his head, and almost felt sorry that most of those she loved were already dead. They were all people that she loved, and Draco wanted her to think of him.
"I don't know," Ron shrugged his shoulders, "but she danced with Malfoy. She has horrid taste."
Harmony sat atop her bed, focusing her mind to enable her face to change at will. The whole process was frustrating, especially in a room filled with snoring boys. She wrapped herself in a thin blanket, in case someone was to peek over and see her not so male face. Her breathing came out deep and regular. Her mind filled with the picture of Harry Potter, and her desire for it. With her eyes still closed she brought a hand up to the planes of her face and marveled at the slight differences. She felt the warmth from the magic, a slight trickle coursing through her veins. Her skin began to cool, and she went over to a window to catch a glimpse of herself.
"Excellent," Harmony replied, reaching up to place a hand on his chest. "I know plenty of fun things that a couple of muggles like us could do."
"Stop," Harmony mouthed out, breathlessly. Her heart clenched and struggled to calm its erratic beat. This wasn't real, was Snape twisting her thoughts, her memories?
"Well, did you see where it went?" she asked and looked around her. "And how did you fit in here, anyway?" And yet he still did not answer. "Draco, are you listening?"
Voldemort turned to Draco and sneered. "Now it's your turn you little traitor." Harmony watched with bristling anger as Draco didn't have time to react and Voldemort shot him with crucio. Hands held Lucious Malfoy back, as his son screamed.
"Suppose that you go to Snape looking all fine," she whispered while giving a wink, "and flutter your eyes about, and don't forget to give a shy smile. He will surely say yes then." Harmony gave a slight snort. She had told Ginny during the summer break that Snape knew her secret.
"Indeed," came a low mutter from Snape which he didn't realize was very much audible. He then proceeded to cough a bit and shuffle away.
Draco saw from above the girl's shoulder, Harry Potter making his way towards them. "Is Harry here now?" she asked and Draco pointed to the boy.
He looked to Harmony and saw her eyes pleading him to do something, and yet he could not move. His eyes locked to his father's back as the man took something from a cabinet. The man pivoted to face him, washing Draco with a lingering disgust that he himself had used plenty times, before directing his attention to Harmony. Draco ignored the pain in his leg as he lifted himself from the floor.
"A little business," Malfoy said.
"I'll bring you food each day," she said, and Sirius shrugged his thin shoulders.
"Good, still following my orders. Has he said anything about Potter?" Harmony took in a breath, and widened her eyes. Snape knew her mind, knew almost all of her secrets.
"It's none of your business." His left eye gave a bit of a twitch; maybe this was not so bad.
"Just convince him, alright," Ron said and she nodded.
"As long as her sister is not physically harmed, then Bellatrix will see it all as a necessity. You do not remember her, but Azkaban has been anything but constructive for her." Snape looked at Draco and the lines between his irascible eyebrows creased.
Had things really gotten that bad? Pansy had stopped talking to him, but he had though of that as a relief. She looked positively awful. Crabe and Goyle were the same mindless brutes, so not much of a change happened there. But he had noticed Theodore become even more withdrawn. His father had broken out of Azkaban, and Draco wondered if that had set off all of their acerbic countenances. He wouldn't have thought that the quidditch game had been won, and that all of them had celebrated. Things would get a lot worse for them all.
"Crabbe, do you remember?"
They placed him on an unoccupied bed on Harry's far left. Madam Pomfrey hurried to the supine boy. Even Harry could tell that Malfoy was not feigning his pain. He watched with curiosity as Malfoy was tantalized by suffering. The nurse forced a pain alleviating potion down his throat and made to get more.
The blood had been removed from her school robes, and the torn up fabric mended. She still wore the bandages over her chest, and when they were cleaned, she traced the pink outline of a faint scar over her heart.
"Er, right." Harmony chuckled, "so I have been a bit busy."
"I'll see if I can get it later, just leave the title on my desk." Draco gave his thanks and left the room. He wondered what to do next; he had enough time to terrorize some first year Hufflepuffs and practice some new hexes. He continued to roam the halls particularly in the direction of the medic wing, till to his dismay he caught wind of Weasley and the infuriating Mudblood. He wondered if they hooked up or something, a perfect couple in his opinion; a mudblood with a muggle loving disgrace. They were heading towards Potter, but he needed a way to spy on him too. He slowly came to a halt as a brilliant idea forced a smug smile to grace his lips. He knew he was amazing for a reason.
Harmony paused, considering. She was young, and rich, and she could do magic. And now there was nothing stopping her. "Everywhere," she answered.
Draco didn't seem so amused as he watched their professor, and instead he pointed out Dumbledore who looked to be doing the macarena with a ghost. She was going to point out Ron and Hermione, but thought better of it, as they snogged the life out of each other. "Next!" Collin howled over the music. Harmony and Draco sat on a white bench with an arch of roses and lilacs. She smiled at the camera as Collin was counting down, and surprise skipped through her as Draco tilted her head gently and kissed the corner of her lips. The camera flashed and Harmony closed her eyes as she felt his lips linger over hers. She met his kiss and didn't pay attention as Collin yelled next. She could only think of the light warmth that spread through her as he pulled away reluctantly, even as other couples rolled their eyes and waited pointedly. A blush pinked her cheeks and Draco held her hand and pulled her to him.
