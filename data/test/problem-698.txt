” he continued. “An’ then
“Harry!” he heard from the back door of the bar. “Oi, Harry! You out here, mate?!” he heard Ron call again, just as he was centimeters away from kissing Draco Malfoy. Harry gasped again, stumbling backwards. Draco was looking at him, his gray eyes still dark, his expression hard.
"Tergeo," Harry whispered, wand pointed on himself as soon as he was alone. The cleaning spell did nothing to remove his immense guilt. He continued walking down the empty hall, arriving at a large, ornate wooden door. Draco's bedroom was the last room he had to search. Harry mentally kicked himself.
to seven,” she said, and leaned in close to Malfoy, her cleavage clearly visible and her skirt that Harry thought was much too short riding up her thighs.
"Coming after this, Potter?" he sneered. Harry's heart had jumped from his stomach into his throat, and he gulped down heavily. "You know," Draco drawled, "You really ought to have been trained more. You're still just as stupid as you were before they inducted you into the force."
Draco finally looked away from him and let his head fall with his tears. Harry, whom he had spent the last six years ridiculing after a rejected offer of friendship and who was supposed to be his
Draco was only too aware how much skill it indeed required. His heart sank into his stomach, making him feel sick.

“Albus. Severus.” Ginny said flatly, still in disbelief. Hermione snorted.
He was selfishly letting his eyes roam over Potter again one last time, committing his naked form to memory when his eyes froze. Potter was still -
"My seventh -" he stopped. Harry looked up from the vials to Malfoy, who's expression was once again perfectly unreadable.

"I refused to go with them."
Draco tensed.
!” Ron smiled, tearing up. “Man – my nephew with m’ best mate’s weirdly green eyes –” he said, getting choked up about it.
Then Harry turned around, making him stir beneath his trousers and he cursed his teenage hormones for running amok. The Quidditch showers were a very long ways away from the Headmaster's office and even the terrifying prospect of changing his allegiance couldn't completely stop his mind from wandering south.
come back to it later. He was running himself ragged at every moment and he was of no use to anything like that. He needed some time to recuperate. He needed to clear his over-burdened mind. He needed room to
"Always," Draco repeated, and the word hit Harry hard, swallowing over an immense lump welled up in his throat yet again. He leaned forward, kissing Draco gently. There was no sexual tension this time, even when their lips parted and the tips of their tongues met. At some point Harry's mind registered that Draco was silently crying, and he climbed into the hot water behind him, wrapping his arms around his slim frame. "Love you, love you, love you," Draco whispered, his lips grazing Harry's shoulder as he spoke.
“Coming, Potter?” Malfoy said, and although the sober voice in Harry’s head was politely saying
“C’mon, Harry!” Someone in the crowd on his left yelled, causing others to do the same.
Could he go over there and interrupt exactly as he had done countless times in his fantasies? It
No. No, because that would have made Potter a murderer, and he wouldn't wish his own future fate on his worst ... enemy.
“Wait – you’re not –” she gasped.
After a very long walk through the castle, in which Draco had to repeatedly think of an array of disgusting things to keep himself from fully hardening every time Harry's bum brushed against his front, they finally arrived at the gargoyle statue blocking entrance to the Headmaster's office.
"Are you sure you're an Auror?" Before Harry could retort he casually walked over to the door and said, "Treacle tart." Harry heard the click, and the door opened slightly. Draco stepped forward first, waving his hand in a rather flamboyant motion, causing the room's light fixtures to spring to life. Harry, whose wand was still pointed at Draco, moved in behind him to find himself in large, elegant marble bathroom.
"I know," Harry whispered back.
Just as he predicted. Potter's consent truly was an unrealistic fantasy. He was thankful enough at least that Potter hadn't
Harry grimaced. "Because I'm in love with you." Draco's hands, which had been calmly resting against the sides of the enormous porcelain tub suddenly gripped the edges as if he were hanging on for dear life.
That's what Slytherins
"Mrs. Malfoy," Harry panted, partially from scrambling for his wand and glasses and partially due to the amazing orgasm he had had only a minute ago.
Another moan, low and quiet traveled from the back of the showers to his ears.
Harry jumped off the bed and raced after Draco. It had only been a few seconds, but Draco was already standing in the doorway to his extravagant bathroom, Harry's wand in one hand and his cloak in the other.
He chanced looking up. Harry blinked back at him, looking just as lost as he was.
"Yeah?" he said sarcastically, letting his anger and bitterness get the best of him. He finally looked up at Harry, his eyes puffy and red from crying. "Can he help my father gain back his reputation and power after Azkaban? Can he help restore glory to the Malfoy family name? Can
"Didn't you ever study your own bloodline?"
For some reason –
“The fuck you
Malfoy’s fingers dug into the flesh of his arse
Harry pointed his wand at the open closet entrance door and waited. A moment later he was once again face to face with Draco Malfoy. If Draco had been embarrassed at all by their earlier encounter, his cool, sleek appearance certainly did not show it. Harry could feel the heat rising in his own cheeks, mentally cursing himself for not being able to appear the same as Draco.
The thoughts he had had for the first time that night challenged all that he knew and his very being. An internal crisis began to quietly wage a war within himself. He had been blindly following his parent's ideals without question for just over fourteen years. And then, as if an answer was appearing before his eyes, he came face to face with the object of his deepest, darkest secret.
"Draco,
interrupt and things went sour, he could just carry on with his business. But could he do it?
They reached St. Mungo’s a few long minutes later.
"It's my fault this time, Professor." Draco said quietly and Harry looked flabbergasted.
if you were enjoying yourself, Potter. It certainly sounded like it." His arms were crossed, his voice his usual drawl despite the explosion of his nerves.
"And you… you don't understand why it's strange that Dumbledore had your Cloak… considering his history with Grindelwald?"
Encouraged and loving the weight of Harry's tight sack against his tongue, Draco continued to lick at him until Harry was clearly going mad from it, evidenced by his hands scrabbling against the tiles. He could feel the hair flattening with each stroke of his tongue and although his face was buried against his balls, he could swear that Potter was practically growling from the sensation. The reality of Harry’s reactions turned him on far more than he had ever imagined they would. He had always thought that the
"Say you don't want this. Tell me you don't want to know what it'd be like. Say it and I'll leave, Potter."
Harry, who had never smoked a cigarette before in his entire life, mimicked the girl’s actions – minus the scandalous look – or so he
“No. I still hate you, Scarhead.”
"From the pensieve room?" She said quietly. She looked at them both and then looked at the spot of chipped paint on the wall whose reappearance had gone unnoticed. "I've been trying to get in there for years. How did you do it?"
The waitress re-appeared, clearing away the fourteen empty shot glasses with a flick of her wand and a smile toying at her candy red lips that suggested she had seen this situation a hundred times before.
"Fuck, Potter," Draco gasped, resting his forehead against Harry's and thrusting his hips up into the exquisite pressure. Harry's eyes locked onto Draco's and he just began to speed his hand up when he felt the other man grab his wrist, stopping him. Harry, unable to stop himself, whined, already desperate for release.
"Right. Well, I'll be getting on with the search then," he said lamely. "Stay in my sight."
"My mouth," Draco repeated, pulling back enough to look Harry in the eyes. "Do you want me on my knees, Potter, with your cock in my mouth?"
"It was more than just that and you know it." he replied, his voice low.
"Draco -
“My friend that I’m staying with – his sister is the waitress, yeah? And
, fuck - please - Draco,
Snape blinked at him as Harry looked back and forth between the both of them, bewildered.
– cigarette lighter from his pocket. The girl held the cigarette delicately against her lips between the index and middle fingers of her right hand, needlessly leaning over and looking up at Malfoy in a positively scandalous way. Malfoy lit hers up first and then, with the same flame, held it out to Harry.
“Yeah,” Harry quietly agreed, watching him.
“Oh my god is that
lie to me," he said, barely above a dangerous whisper. "
"Yessss," Draco hissed into his ear, and Harry very nearly came from that alone. He desperately wanted to throw the vials, evidence be damned, to the floor and rip off every piece of clothing keeping their skin apart. Harry did not dare to stop, however, fearing that if he did so even for a moment, one of them might regain sanity.
“Do you live around here?” Malfoy asked the girl, his low voice once again silky.
Harry’s hips involuntarily canted forward, meeting the other man’s and then their hard cocks were instantly pressed against each other through thick layers of fabric, sending shivers through them both. Harry heard Malfoy’s low groan in his ear before the blonde’s mouth covered his again in another searing kiss.
was all over
"So? Didn't those -" Draco stopped himself. "Didn't your, er - aunt or whomever, give you your family's ancestry book?"
why you've constantly insulted me? And my friends, and my family,
"Do you understand what would happen if the Dark Lord penetrated Potter's mind and found whatever it is you're blocking
"How long?"
He sighed sadly when his feet touched the ground again, as if it were some Portkey that had transported him back to reality.
"It's not fine, Malfoy. Your father murdered an innocent child as a sadistic birthday gift to you."
"Many believers in the Hallows also believe
"I hope you know this doesn't change who I am, Harry," Draco breathed over his wet lips.
“Oh my g-”
Harry blinked at him. Draco sighed.
"You must be strong," he whispered against Draco's hair, holding his own tears back.
"I should have stayed at Hogwarts." Harry Potter muttered to himself, walking briskly along the yew hedge-lined pathway and dreading every step. "I should have just stayed there and helped with the repairs and then joined a damn quidditch te-" Something stark white appeared in his peripheral vision, cutting his self-berating short. He whipped around toward the offending thing and pointed a tightly gripped wand at it so fast, it took him a moment to register what it was.
"That's quite alright, Draco dear, I've accepted my own wrongdoings and I am prepared for the consequences." She drew herself up to full height, her beautiful haughty appearance somewhat intimidating.
"Isn't that what I just said, Scarhead?" he spat. Harry considered hexing him but couldn't bring himself to hex a wandless wizard just for name calling.
Harry stared at him, breathing hard.
“Ohh,” she said, leaning into the table. Harry, who could feel his own drunkenness over-taking him, noticed how her heavy breasts pressed against the wood.
who was due any day now with their second child.
Perhaps if his entire life hadn't already been planned for him at birth and he didn't have to follow in his Father's footsteps to retain the family glory and status and all of that other crap...  he could have been one hell of an Obliviator for the Ministry.
Everything in Harry's life had always happened so suddenly. Suddenly he was a wizard. Suddenly he was famous. Suddenly he had friends. Suddenly he was defeating a basilisk and he had an innocent godfather. Suddenly Cedric was dead and Voldemort was alive. Suddenly Sirius was dead too, suddenly there were horcruxes and suddenly Harry was one of them. But none of it had all been really sudden, had it? He had been a wizard all his life and famous since before he could remember. His friendships had been built through trials and tribulations. The opening of the Chamber of Secrets had been planned, Sirius had always been his reckless, innocent Godfather, and Voldemort would have ordered anyone who had wound up in that graveyard to be murdered regardless. Even his return had not happened suddenly. It was always going to happen as long as he had his horcruxes. As long as Harry had been one of them, as long as Dumbledore had known.
… Potter!” she said, magically transferring the legal document’s information to the bracelet.
“Actually, considering why I’m here in the first place, it really is very much my-”
"I'm - I'm aware, sir. Forgive me, it's just that I have never seen another departed being in this room before." Draco spoke carefully; there were ancient types of magic that ghosts held power to and to anger a ghost by carelessly upsetting one would be a very foolish mistake. Especially if it was an unpredictable ghost like The Baron.
Harry unfroze himself and brought his empty hand up against his other shoulder blade, the pads of his calloused fingers digging as he moaned softly into Draco's mouth, tongue slowly reciprocating.
“Oh! Oh, it’s alright, dear,” she laughed, and Harry gave her a weak smile, reaching for her hand. “I know how those birthdays get on. I – ooh – I, ow – went to them quite a bit with you when I wasn’t knocked up.”
Ginny. His wife. His wife,
“Yes – oh, how sweet! What’s your name, little one?” Hermione said to the baby, expecting his parents to answer her.
Harry's cock sprung up as soon as it was free from its denim prison, tenting the front of his simple, scarlet red boxers. Wasting no time, he curled his fingers over the elastic and pulled them down, purposely letting them catch on Harry's cock so that it slapped the skin of his lower abdomen as it sprang back up. The tip of Harry's uncircumcised, thick cock reached somewhere just below his belly button, beautifully curving towards its owner. Draco wrapped his right hand around the base of it, feeling the black nest of hair brush against his palm. He pulled it down towards him, the head already peeking through the foreskin and glistening.
The Baron was right. He
"Come with me to Dumbledore, Draco." Harry said, hand tightening around his.
“Sorry – I know this is unexpected, but I wanted to tell you both together and not where it was
do. Cunningly use any means to achieve ends, or whatever that old pile of rags had said. But that reckless, radical voice deep inside his head vehemently disagreed.
Just then, the most popular song that summer started to blare throughout the bar, causing many of the girls around them to squeal in delight, tugging their friends away to the dancefloor.
To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy laughed, something he only recalled the blonde doing when he had been belittling his friends or himself at Hogwarts.
"I still live here, Potter." Draco said, sounding just as he did when they had still been school rivals. His grey eyes roamed over the contents of his closet, now strewn about the floor.
"Yes," she said. "I did." Neither of them mentioned what both knew: Narcissa only lied in his favor because Draco had still been alive.
Ron and Hermione laughed and Harry moved in closer to Ginny.
"It's not. I know it. I know there's something there." Malfoy rolled his eyes and pushed himself off the wall to pace around the room yet again.
Malfoy's racing heart tripped, skipping several beats and he pressed his hands flat against the tile on either side of Harry's head.
He tried not to think about any of it. He
begging him,
"I know." Harry said, focused on hastily shoving the Cloak back into his robe pocket.
of my house..."
"I don't have a wand, remember?" Draco sneered.
“Yeah – well, ‘s been a crazy night,” Ron said loudly over their heads as they walked through the crowded London nightlife. “We were all doin’ rounds with Steathers, y’know, for his birthday ‘n’ all, as you do, and you’ll never guess who happened to be at the bar, ‘Mione!”
big, curving just a bit towards his navel - flushed at the crown and still rock hard despite the interruption. He unconsciously licked his lips.
"It must be, Potter. Nothing you've done for the past hour has worked. You should thank Merlin you're so famous, I doubt the ministry would have let such an inept excuse for a wizard into their Auror department otherwise."
"I'm s-"
He had let out quite a bit of pent-up aggression in the air. He was soaked in his sweat, his white cotton shirt stuck to his back. The dust from the Room of Requirement that had clung to his cloak now felt caked onto his skin. He looked at the clock on the wall of the changing room as he entered - 9:46pm. 14 minutes. He put his broom away while deciding that a shower would feel much better than any cleaning charm would.
Hermione scooped the baby up, cradling the little boy in her arms as she stood.
"You are," he taunted, unable to stop himself. "Saint Potter. Not even Dark magic can taint your sainthood..." He felt his breath increase in pace.
Harry told himself – her words made him blush.
"It doesn't," he whispered, afraid to finally admit what he had always known. His eyes were drawn to Harry's hand still gently clasped around his left wrist. Very slowly, he moved his arm back and lightly threaded his fingers through Harry's. "None of it matters."
It was Draco who praised his father at every chance. It was Draco who defended his father at all costs both verbally and physically, giving his left arm to be branded by a Dark Lord who promised to murder his family should he fail in his tasks. It was Draco, Harry realized yet again, who had been desperately trying to uphold the great expectations of those surrounding him in life. Harry was flooded with a sudden onset of understanding and compassion for the other man. The desire to live up to one's expectations was something he knew all too well, regardless of how often he attempted not to care. Stepping slightly closer, he bore his emerald green eyes into Draco's, finally seeing the pain that he was desperately trying to mask.
His hands crept up Draco's back, hooking over his shoulders from behind, using the leverage to sit up. His cock nearly slipped out as Draco, taller than him by an inch, now had to straddle Harry's lap upright. They stayed that way for only a few seconds before Harry was pushing Draco onto his back. He spread Draco's thighs apart, kneeling between them as he pushed his cock back inside completely, making them both gasp. Draco's hips came up to meet his, gripping Harry's biceps as they began to rock together.
"What?"
He swept forward and Draco could do nothing as The Bloody Baron passed right through him, drenching him in the sensation of being dunked in the harshest of icy waters, making him gasp and shiver.
"Auror Potter," she said curtly.
"Erm, ah- Auror Potter. I, er, have a search and seizure grant issued by the Minister of Magic. If you resist allowing me onto the premises, I, ah, I will have to use force."
Wizard's Promise and his stupid
"Do you really want me to?" Draco asked, stepping into the stream. The hot water hit his platinum blonde hair, turning it a very pale gold as it fell heavy around his head, clinging to his ears and neck. His white shirt became nearly transparent, sticking to him like a second skin and his trousers were becoming weighted, drifting slightly from his hips due to the amount of water they were absorbing.
A thin, shiny, scar curved across his chest down to his flat abdomen, like someone had swung a sword upwards and slashed him open. Like Harry had swung a sword and slashed him open. It pained him to see the evidence of his own stupidity. He touched his fingers to the top of it near Draco's shoulder, tracing its diagonal path down. Draco's breathing hitched.
"There's… much more to this than you are aware of, Draco."
"Malfoy," he began, his voice hoarse.
“’Mione?” Harry said, confused. “Wha’s ‘Mione doin’ here?” She didn’t usually come out when someone in their Department had a birthday.
“Eh. Didn’t do much for me. But then again it
"Trust me," he repeated in a hoarse whisper as he glided closer. His cold, undead breath was only an inch away from his face, sending chills down Draco's spine.
"I enjoy my privacy, thank you. Which, speaking of," he drawled, waving his hand again and the taps to a large soaking tub came on. "I'll be needing momentarily, Potter." Harry wished he could slip away through the floor and forget this day had ever existed.
began to dip.
Harry continued to stare, looking at him as if he were trying to figure out what nefarious thing he was up to now, clearly in disbelief what he just said.
“Wanker.” Harry responded.
“No – really – what’s –” and she stopped when she saw Ginny’s face, realizing that her sister-in-law had let her very drunk husband name their second child.
Draco didn't bother to change into his flying gear as he quickly grabbed his broom from the Slytherin changing room. He wanted the most time to fly he could get before Hooch or Filch showed up and started hollering about curfew, house points, detentions and other completely pointless nonsense...
"What's behind this damn door?" he yelled, and Draco smirked.
"Sort of," Harry said, smirking as he pulled a near-liquid like fabric from a deep pocket inside his robe.
"Draco…" Snape said softly, crouching down next to him. His heavy black cloak created a crescent moon behind him on the floor and he wrapped an arm around his shoulders. "I know.
"You told me nothing. You are in no position to keep anything from me. I'll ask only once more, Malfoy. If you don't tell me the truth, I'll have you chucked in Azkaban faster than you can blink. Who. Are. You. Expecting?"
Severus understood the very same pain he had been hiding himself since childhood. The weight of reality struck him hard, realization tearing him to pieces.
“Hey, Ron,” Harry said, not meeting his best friend’s eyes. “’Sup?”
"Always."
Harry was entirely consumed by how
Harry's cock
“You’ve done muggle drugs?” Harry replied in shock.
The look Harry gave Draco was more than an answer.
"Second year."
"I assure you, Potter, I am completely sober of any love potions."
Harry looked back up at him, something nervous in his expression. Panic gripped at Draco, twisting his insides into knots. They had both crossed so many lines already; surely Harry knew there was no point in stopping now - not when they were mere feet from the finish. Worrying that Harry might really change his mind if any more time elapsed, he gripped Harry's hips for leverage and immediately sank to his knees.
"You wanted me to leave? Why?" Harry's heart panged with guilt, but Draco spoke again before Harry could answer.  "You know what? I don't care. You're pathetic, Potter," but it didn't sound genuine at all. He sounded afraid. Unsure. Hurt. "What were you even thinking I'd do? Vanish the vials? There's a hundred more you've sealed off. There's probably enough evidence left in there to put my father away for all of eternity. Or maybe I'd apparate away with your precious wand? Maybe your clothes, too, Potter, so that your fellow aurors, just as brilliant as you, I'm sure, would have to rescue you from my bedroom while you're starkers. For fuck's sake." He threw Harry's things at him and turned on his heels back into the bathroom, where seconds later Harry heard the sloshing of water.
have burst through the gap in the trees and directed his father and the others directly towards him, Weasley, and Granger - exactly as his father would have expected him to. For the first time in his life that night - he did the opposite.
"You expect me to just take the word of an ex-Death Eater?" he said in-between tapping the silver sink faucets.
“Heeeeyyy!” Ron said, coming back in, Hermione at his side as they both went to Harry to wrap him in a tight hug. Harry wrapped his arms around them both for a few moments.
Harry blinked rapidly, noticing his surroundings again. He looked incredibly confused to find himself standing in front of the Headmaster's office with Snape and Draco looking at him.
“Sorry, mate, sorry,” Ron said.
“Yes, yes, yes,” she chanted, and the Healer’s assistant handed her a small vial that she drank immediately, sighing in relief. The Healer was saying “I’m getting you into position now, alright, Mrs. Potter?” waving her wand before she even finished speaking, and Ginny nodded as her feet were being magically supported up.
“Oh dear,” Hermione said. “I’m sure that challenge wasn’t ignored by
It was dark and crowded out back, only a dingy yellow light providing just enough of an amber glow to see. There was a bench meant to seat four people comfortably currently being occupied by seven, not including the girl sitting on her friend’s lap, giggling as they talked to some bloke with a plethora of tattoos who was wearing tight muggle clothing.
There had been only one other time he had had a kiss with such intensity, and it had been from Ginny on his 17th birthday, when neither of them had been sure they would make it out of the war alive. He knew that, had they not been so rudely interrupted, that kiss would have led to his loss of virginity that day. But this - this intense, wet, suddenly open-mouthed kiss was so very different. There was no impending threat of death on either Draco or, for once in his life, Harry. There was no more war, no more Voldemort. Yet Harry felt so similar, like this was his last chance. This was it. It was his moment of now or never.
“Oh, we decided that Harry could name the baby if it was a boy, and I would if it was a girl –”
he was going to hit the brick face first except that Malfoy had moved to catch him and Harry was so surprised in his stupor by it that he didn’t move out of Malfoy’s arms.
least of all Harry himself, to ever know.
He felt Harry reaching up and a hand carefully closed around his left wrist. He slowly pried it away from blonde hair and pulled his arm down between them.
Harry pulled on his robe, the vials clinking, a reminder he had no need for.
Harry's heart was hammering the inside of his chest. He was seconds away from treading into extremely unfamiliar territory. Although very different with another man, the kissing, grinding, blow jobs - he had had his fair share of that with Ginny. But this. This was new. He wasn't completely oblivious to what was about to happen, of course. It's not as if he had never seen porn. He knew why Draco had made the effort to get the lube. Harry watched him uncork the vial and pour some into his hand, and Harry had the uncomfortable feeling that this wasn't the first time Draco had done this. Jealousy surged through him just as Draco's slick hand closed around his cock, making his hips buck involuntarily. In a moment Draco was once again straddling his hips, and Harry was sure his lungs were refusing to function properly. Draco reached behind himself, holding Harry's cock straight as he began to sink backwards. The head of Harry's cock slipped past Draco's opening once, twice, and then past the point of no return. Small sounds were being wrenched from Draco's throat as he took Harry in, slowly sinking further down. Harry watched Draco's pained expression with as much concern as he could muster through the lust that consumed him.
“Scared?” Malfoy said, noting the obvious look of trepidation on Harry’s face, taunting him as if they were still small school children.
"Draco," Harry said, his voice hoarse. Draco snapped his gaze back up to Harry's face. "I'll - I'll c- come if you keep -"
"What happened that day?" Harry saw no change of emotion on Malfoy's pale, pointed face.
“None of your business, Potter.”
Someone moved past Harry, brushing against him to pass, heading back inside the bar. “Sorry!” they said, and Harry muttered “No worries,” as he stepped forward and suddenly, drunkenly tripped on air, sending himself tumbling right into the brick wall –
"That's what I said, Potter, he died. Stop repeating me."
"I can't."
"What … what if he can't -"
from?"
"Then what were you just doing up there?" Harry said, glaring up at him.
A pang of guilt stabbed Harry through his gut at the thought of Ron. One month ago, he had finally decided to break things off with Ginny, simultaneously deciding not to tell anyone else. A week later, Ron had come barging into the office demanding Harry to immediately explain himself. Harry winced as he replayed his own explanation in his mind's eye.
“Really!” he said. “’N’ d’you believe it, ‘Mione, he sent me ‘n’ Harry shots on
Draco woke with a small jolt, turning and blinking at Harry rapidly with bleary grey eyes. Harry stared back, not sure of what to say.
"I - I don't think it is," Harry very nearly whispered. Draco's soft crying continued a minute longer, his back turned to him.
"If the Ministry had really been diligently searching for me they would have found me here six months ago."
it was to have someone – to have
Or he
“Make that ten to seven, love,” he told her, and in the next two seconds, knocked back his remaining two shots, one after the other.
Snape stared at him hard.
"Since first year."
While Harry watched him, he opened his mouth and swept his come-covered tongue over his lips like a whore before licking them clean again. Then, without ever breaking eye contact and with his fist still flying over his prick, he swallowed - his adam's apple bobbing as Harry's thick spunk slid down his throat.
"I've been with you all day while you've torn apart my home searching for evidence to damn me and my family, I've told you things today I thought I would never, ever say aloud even to myself, I even gave myself to you, Potter, and you still come running in here after me like I'm - like I'm just some fucking worthless criminal ready to run at my first chance? I could have taken your wand ages ago, Potter. I could have killed you and fled. I could have left with my mother, when you idiotically left me with her without realizing I could apparate away with her, but I didn't, did I?"
Harry removed the Cloak while Draco's heart began beating faster than a Firebolt at its top speed.
Harry held his second child, his second son, for the first time, pride, joy and an immense amount of love wiping away everything else he might have been feeling in that very moment.
“What can I say? Some of us are just better than others…” he said, his voice silky, knowing that Harry was still watching him and listening. He brought his left hand up, smoothing his blonde hair back, and Harry saw the silver band on his ring finger glint in the low light of the bar.
“’S alright, mate. Let it out.” he said, leaning over and speaking in what he thought was a whisper to Hermione. “I said I stopped at six – Harry made it to
Draco realized what Harry was doing a moment before he did it, and while his brain was screaming at him to stop it, his heart let it happen.
The small difference in their height was now very apparent in their proximity. Draco stared down his nose only centimeters away from Harry's own, their breath mingling together.
"Why do you not return to it later?"
For years and years, Draco had never even thought of asking why. And then he saw his father don his Death Eater robes for the first time, marching with the others who did so to torture those muggles at the Quidditch World Cup. As he watched from the trees, he saw the joyous atmosphere of the campground turn into a horrendous nightmare. Singing turned to screaming, children's laughter turning to pitiful cries and Draco finally wondered why.
“Time for papers, I’m afraid, Dad,” said the assistant Healer, smiling. Harry cleared his throat and nodded, putting his son softly back into his wife’s arms.
Well,
Harry watched the baby squirm a bit in his arms, slowly opening his eyes at Harry’s voice, and Ginny gasped.
“I do not,” he said, staring at Harry and Harry’s eyes went wide. “I may have used to, but not anymore.” He ran a hand over his hair again, nose in the air, looking just as arrogant as ever.
"Leave it," Draco whispered and Harry stopped, looking at him in confusion just as Severus Snape appeared in the entrance way, his wand drawn.
“’M gonna be an uncle again – ha!” Ron yelled to the air. “
Because that's what he thought Potter was. The
Harry, contrary to many of his fantasies, would be prudish, timid and gentle, innocently blushing with loving little sighs and soft touches.
The sounds of panting, soft moans, the bed creaking quietly, and the rhythmic slapping of skin was incredibly intoxicating. Even more so was the sight of Draco beneath him, drastically different from his usual pristine condition. His blonde hair was mussed against the bed, flawless white skin blotched with red, and he was trying his best to trap any moan trying to escape. Harry could tell Malfoy was still holding back. He was still forcing himself to keep his composure, a certain kind of rigidity he was taught to display from infancy. It only furthered Harry's desire to dissolve all of that, to see what was hiding beneath. Amidst a fire raging within himself, he bent his head down to kiss Draco. The intimacy of the act caught Draco off guard, and he let himself whimper into Harry's mouth, the sound sending tremors straight through him. As they parted, Harry felt Draco's left hand release its vice grip from his bicep to reach between them and fist his own cock hurriedly, moaning desperately against Harry's lips as he did so. Enthralled by this, Harry sped up, grunting "God, yes, Draco,” and pounding his cock deep into him. Harry felt Draco's hand between them still, noticing some unreadable expression appear on his face once again, even during this lapse in both their sanities, and Harry groaned in frustration.
"Mm. She does it for you, then, yeah?" he said, the sudden huskiness of his voice surprising both of them.
Draco tried his best to keep his expression simple. He was admittedly shocked, not just from the truth of it, but from the ironic nature of an eternally brooding, usually mute ghost covered in blood calling
"Fuck," Harry breathed, his muscles going slack against his will, collapsing against the other man. His softening cock slipped out slightly as their position changed, and Draco bit his bottom lip as he felt Harry's come leaking from him onto his silk bedcover. "I'm s-sorry about, ah-" Harry stammered, entirely unsure if it had been okay to come inside Draco since Ginny had never, ever let him finish like that during his few experiences with her.
With Harry intently watching him, Draco spit over his prick before he began to take it all back down his throat again at a maddeningly slow pace.
“We’ve always had quite the… rivalry, wouldn’t you say, Potter?” he said quietly.
"You - I - you're not really, you don't actually - it's just lust, just lust clouding your mind. You can't, you don't -" Harry was pretty sure he had just broken something inside of Draco.
"That's it?" Draco asked, peering in from behind. "All that trouble over a pensieve?"
"Who?"
He pulled his mouth off Harry's nipple to look down, watching his own hand move over the long, thick length of Harry's cock in amazement. The muscles under the taut skin of Harry's flat abdomen flexing as Harry rocked his hips to meet his hand was surely one of the most erotic sights he had ever seen. The action of it was almost no different than stroking his own, but it felt infinitely better than anything he had ever tried with girls. There was no guessing here, no need for exceedingly gentle, unsure fingers. He started twisting his fist as he came up, slightly increasing the pressure, knowing just how much he loved that sensation himself.
Harry had lunged forward, knocking Draco's back flat into the wall behind him, his right forearm pressed into his throat, effectively cutting off his speech. He was still holding his wand, it's tip now pointed over Harry's own left shoulder as he held Malfoy in place by his neck. He still held the vials in his other hand, gripping them almost tight enough to shatter the glass into his palm. Draco, being quite strong for his slender frame, pushed his hands hard against the forearm strangling him and panicked when Harry didn't budge an inch.
"It is my understanding that the two of you were dueling
Gulping air, he finally nodded and Snape helped him to his feet again. Draco, still gripping onto his arm, looked up at him and saw the incredible sadness etched into his face. His fingers clutched at the thick black fabric in the crook of Snape's arm.
"Listen," he breathed in Draco's rapidly coloring face, "Don't you dare talk about my family like that ever again." He let Draco struggle a single second longer. He then released his arm and Draco shrilly gasped in air, the purple color quickly fading from his face at the intake of oxygen. He started coughing, and Harry loudly said over him, "And I wouldn't tell you I'm sorry something happened to you unless I meant it."
"Very sorry." he said, at a loss. Malfoy studied him for a moment, trying to detect any trace of malintent in Harry's condolence.
got a small taste of his true feelings, Draco had seen to correct that immediately.
"Romilda Vane - she's a fourth year in my house, she's been messing about with love potions all year and -"
Harry nervously licked his lips, his eyes flicking down to Malfoy's half open shirt before he shook water from his fringe, then looked at him with a hard, daring expression.
“Well, say hello to…” she squinted at Harry’s sloppy penmanship. “
too troubled.
"I mean, I'm perfectly aware most people believe the Hallows are just a myth. I certainly don't blame you for thinking that if you do, but if you really bothered to research it there's loads of evidence throughout history suggesting otherwise. And I must say - in addition to history, I'm quite educated in pureblood lines besides my own. That wasn't
"Don't," Malfoy said quietly, and then in his best expression of disgust, "Do not talk to me with that wretched tone of voice, Potter. Like you suddenly feel sorry for me."
"You're going to the Ministry, Malfoy. And you're going to be tried, and you're going to lose." he ground out, an inch away from Draco's face.
"But it was my father's."
but Draco's brain seemed to cease all other thought because it had noticed Potter was absolutely fucking
"Of course." he muttered. Of course she would send them here. Harry was certainly disobeying protocol by showing up alone but seeing as Ron was probably more dangerous to him right now than an empty mansion would be, he decided against following orders. He tried the handle with no luck. He was raising his wand when the unmistakable sound of a door being unlocked made him freeze in place, wand at the ready. The door began to open. No matter what he was expecting, it certainly was not the appearance of Draco Malfoy himself.
"I'll leave right now if you really want, Potter," he breathed against his lips. "Just say it and I'll go away and pretend this never happened."
Malfoy smirked, and to show just how serious he was, he picked up the first shot and knocked it back without so much as a blink of an eye.
"I'm famished," he said dramatically, rolling over and gracefully leaping out of his bed. Harry slowly sat up, swinging his legs over the side of the bed without half the grace Draco had just displayed. He watched him walk to the closet. Harry picked up his clothes off the floor and began to pull them on. "All I had yesterday before you showed up was a slice of gruyere and half a glass of firewhiskey."
"You can tell me all about my pureblood ancestry and whatever Hallows are later," he said quietly.
Malfoy swallowed the small moan that escaped him, removing his hand from Harry’s face to trail his fingers down the deep dip of Harry’s back, pushing right over the curve of Harry’s arse. He slipped his hand tightly inside his back pocket, gripping the soft flesh covered by the remaining material. Harry gasped, finally breaking the kiss, and Malfoy seized the opportunity to use the hand he still had wound in Harry’s thick hair to roughly pull his head back, his mouth immediately going to the base of his long, exposed neck. He sucked at the dip there before licking a hot, wet trail over his adam’s apple, up the rest of his neck, moving Harry’s head to the side and licking his way along his jaw. Harry panted, his hands scrambling over Draco to pull him closer, and Malfoy's lips found Harry’s earlobe, nipping and sucking on it, hot breath harsh in his ear.
They had no time or place to run, and Draco saw Harry frantically digging for his Cloak again.
He wasn't sure how long they stayed that way or how long they spent bathing together. He wasn't sure what time it was, late night or very early morning when they slowly made their way back to Draco's bed, pausing only briefly on the way to grab his things in the hand Draco wasn't holding. He wasn't sure how long he lay awake curled up against him, listening to his steady breathing deepen with sleep. Harry could see the expansive windows beyond the rise and fall of Draco's back, and he watched the sky start to lighten.
"What were you thinking about?" he asked quietly instead, pressing his luck and tentatively taking the smallest step forward.
"Well, by all means then, Auror Potter." He opened the door in a grand fashion and extended his arm out towards the entrance hall. Harry stepped in, not turning his back to Malfoy. This was not the plan. This was not supposed to be happening. The assignment had only been issued to them, as they were brand new Aurors, because the Manor was almost guaranteed to be empty. Almost.
"Leave, Potter."
"You know, Death? From
"Draco Malfoy, you are hereby under arrest by order of the Ministry of Magic."
"I came back to get some of my things," he said quietly. "I thought you were a muggle knocking on the door."
"Listen," Harry said, holding back another laugh at Draco’s expression. "If I start telling you about the Dursleys, you'll never change your mind about muggles."
Harry was silent for a few moments before he said exactly what Draco expected him to say.
Severus went completely still for a moment, as if someone had replaced his spinal column with a steel rod. Draco silently cried against him and Snape released a breath, finally leaning in, one spindly hand cradling the back of Draco's head and the other splayed in-between his shoulder blades.
Draco remembered The Baron saying the same what now felt like eons ago. He realized he would no longer have to fix that stupid Cabinet. More importantly, he no longer had to devise ways to murder another human being. He felt like an enormous weight had been lifted from him.
?” she asked, gritting her teeth and squeezing Harry’s hand tightly.
They were now both staring in silence at the small, dark room in front of them. Something inside was emitting a faint blue glow. Harry was sure he knew exactly what that glow was. Draco made to slowly step forward, but Harry grabbed his shoulder and stopped him from doing so.
"Fuck, oh my god, I
"Suck them," he hissed. Harry did, wetting Draco's fingers with his tongue, sure that he had never been harder in his life. When Draco removed them, Harry, feeling slightly afraid, was sure he was going to use them to penetrate him. Instead, Draco reached behind himself and made a deep noise in the back of his throat.
it matter?
"Dr-" he started to apologize, but the wind was knocked from him as Draco somehow flipped their positions at lightning speed. He straddled Harry's hips, his hands pinning his arms down on either side of his head.
Draco stopped, staring ahead at nothing. He then turned his head just barely enough to speak over his right shoulder without looking at the other man.
Feeling sick with himself, he turned from Malfoy without a word and stumbled through the sparse few shady looking people who were still out there smoking, praying that they had been minding their own business.
to hear him admit that. He would love to see Potter come like this, just by slowly jerking him off and watching him lose control under
the ponce.”
"Well, who are you expecting, then?" Draco, who had clearly anticipated Harry asking why he had decided against fleeing the country with his parents, looked taken aback for a single second.
he said, and unbuttoned the first four buttons on his most likely very expensive black shirt, pulling it apart to show her part of his pale chest, partially revealing the curve of a long, shiny scar. She gasped.
been funny. He had felt terribly frightened and guilty, and he had remembered that guilt many, many, times over the years since but now – now Malfoy was laughing about it. And Harry supposed – as he saw Malfoy put his forehead down on the table, which shook slightly from his laughter – it
"Draco, what are you-" she stopped cold, eyes meeting Harry Potter's flushed face instead of her son's. He saw her only as a blur until he wordlessly summoned his glasses and jammed them back on his face.
because he definitely did find it impossible
Smirking, Draco gently took part of the fabric in his hands. He had tried convincing his father to buy him his own ever since he found out Potter had one, but for once Lucius wouldn't budge. He had said it was utterly foolish to waste so much money on something temporary.
mate,” Ron slurred quietly in his right ear.
"No, I mean - that's not - you don't really believe that's what happened do you?"
With a noise that sounded like he had just tasted the most exquisite dessert, he deepened the kiss, tilting his head as he explored Harry's mouth.
"Draco," he panted, watching Draco's eyes refocus on his from somewhere far away. "Please, Draco, just let go." It was like Harry had figured out Draco's very own passphrase, opening the wall Draco had been hiding behind. He was suddenly wrapping his legs around Harry's waist and running his free hand through his wild, jet black hair, damp from sweat.
Draco quickly understood that meant Harry hadn't caused it, and he heard quick footsteps descending the spiral staircase.
Snape nodded solemnly and Draco stared at the floor.
Even when he had tread into an awkward, unknown territory with Blaise two nights ago and Blaise - with his stupid guessing games and his
to know. He had to find out for sure before it was too late.
"And if I die… there's a very good chance Harry might not live to defeat The Dark Lord."
“Harry,” she sighed, squeezing his hand. “It’s not that – ow – serious! We already have one –” she laughed and then stopped, scrunching up her face. “It – ah – it makes for a good story, anyway,” she finished breathlessly. He pressed his lips together in a half-smile, half-grimace.
He knew exactly why they shouldn't, but Draco was leaning back onto his bed, his grey eyes dark with lust, slowly pulling Harry by the wrist on top of him, and Harry couldn't bring himself to stop the other man. He found his left knee pressed between the soft flesh of Draco's alabaster white thighs, and Draco had released his wrist to wrap his arm around Harry's waist, pushing his hand into the small of his back. The motion caused Harry to bend forward and Draco leaned in to kiss him. He let his tongue explore Draco's mouth and felt Draco's hand sliding further from the small of his back to grope his arse, wondering how on Earth he could have ever thought of trying to prevent this.
“What were you playing at with her anyway, Malfoy?” Harry said quietly, exhaling smoke, his eyes watching the girl and her friends disappear through the dwindled crowd back into the bar. “You’re married, right?”
necessary, of course - my further genealogical studies were purely out of curiosity, which is a rather long-winded way of telling you how I know that you're related to the Peverells. It all makes perfect sense."
"It's past eleven," Draco said, now fully dressed back in his school uniform that he had charmed clean. He touched the tip of his wand behind his right ear and cast a drying charm on his hair. It fell softly around his face, almost touching his shoulders and naturally parted at the right side. He removed the hair in his eyes with a small jerk of his head and immediately reached into his locker behind him. He pulled out a vial of a thick, purple potion he concocted himself. Uncorking it and pouring a small glob in his left palm, he then carefully returned the cork and vial and shut his locker with his elbow. He rubbed his hands together and carded his long fingers back through his hair only once, leaving it perfectly slicked back as usual.
After a few seconds, Harry gently pushed him back a bit to watch him undress in a dazed fascination, like he had somehow never before seen another bloke undress. As Draco undid the second to last button, the fabric slipped from his grasp, the weight of the wet, heavy wool sinking quickly down his legs.
"Yeah, probably."
"Sod off," he said, nearly too quiet to hear over the water beating against the tiles around them.
In the waiting silence, Harry’s eyes, impossibly green and slightly glazed, focused hard on the innocent looking little glass on the table in front of him.
"I am, yes."
"In the forest. At the end," Harry forced himself to say, really preferring to not remember the events of that day. "After Voldemort's killing curse hit me and I came 'round, he had your mum check to see if I was alive. She lied to him."
” Malfoy answered quickly before Harry could, leaning back and searching his robe for something.
"Yeah. Well, the note said he had it before he died. Wh-"
"Draco," he said in a small voice, feeling his heart ache. "We shouldn't."
"Are - are you serious?" Harry said, his pupils dilating.
"Yeah." Harry huffed, giving him a defiant look that dared him to speak poorly of it. Draco, for once, was headed in a very different direction.
"He'll come up with something. Trust me."
"That's- that's why I left. I thought you would flee with her by side-along."
"Shut it, Malfoy." He desperately wished Hermione was there. While Harry knew he would come up with a solution eventually, Hermione would have long since figured it out.
"Harry," he breathed, shaking his head in disbelief.
"I s'pose, if they read the papers, anyway," he muttered, more so to himself.
Draco.
“What –” he started to ask Ron, but Ron just gave him the drunk version of his ‘I have no idea’ face.
Still in a post earth-shattering orgasmic stupor, he felt himself moving to sit on the tile floor in slow-motion. The water splashed around him a bit as his back hit the left side of the shower stall's wall, resting his forearms on bent knees that were red and oddly indented with the pattern of the tiled floor. The toes of his right foot were mere centimetres away from Harry's discarded wand, and he barely noticed that Harry was moving to sit across from him, the stream of the shower now cascading over their shins.
"You're not hexing me, yet, Potter," he stated, hope flooding back into his veins like some sort of dangerously addictive drug. It infected his brain and made him feel invincible as adrenaline coursed through him. He just
“Y’can’t lose ta
when couples do that!" the assistant told her, continuing to talk, but Harry wasn’t listening.
Harry swallowed thickly.
Harry stood there in shock, staring at him, both of their chests heaving while they still panted. Malfoy’s hair was mussed in a way that looked like someone else other than the blonde himself had mussed it, and Harry realized that it had been his own doing. Malfoy’s lips were swollen and flushed red, and Harry could still feel the tingling on his own, could still feel where Malfoy had licked up his neck, his hand on his arse, the hand that had been tightly gripped in his hair. He could still feel their hard cocks pressing together and he wanted it all to continue
"This is my home, Potter." But there was some underlying tone amidst the sneer that suggested Malfoy knew perfectly well he was not supposed to be here.
"Yeah," Harry mumbled, only half paying attention, deciding on his last option. "What's that?"
What if it
“Absolutely!” Hermione said, grinning and dragging Ron, who was giving Harry and Ginny a thumbs-up, out of the room.
"He was hit by a car."
Snape sneered at him, completely unfazed. "Tell him I'm lying, Potter."
Waving his hand, Snape released Harry, who instantly drew his own wand and pointed it at Snape in fury, breathing heavily.
The seconds passed as he fell from his high, slowly opening his heavy eyelids while his lungs were trying to absorb as much oxygen as fast as they could. Part of the tiled wall, Harry's right leg and his inner thigh were all striped with Draco's come, dripping down like rivulets of wet paint on canvas.
"Did you see it happen?" Malfoy only stared at Harry, so Harry started again. "Malfoy, did you see-"
Draco huffed in impatience and rolled his eyes.
"Fine," he managed, and he quickly began tapping his wand to things, trying to concentrate wholly on the magic at hand.
"He can." Harry said, looking up at him.
Harry was sure that in any second, Draco's fist would be colliding with his face. However, many seconds had now passed, and he was definitely not being punched. Malfoy was kissing him back. Harry's stomach was doing enough flips to earn a gold medal. Draco had actually parted his lips and Harry's heartbeat was thundering so loud in his ears he almost missed the small noise Malfoy made when their tongues first met. Harry could feel a heat that could have been fire for all he cared slowly spreading across his body. Draco's pointed chin was digging uncomfortably against his own, and their noses, smashed together side by side, were fighting to breathe the same air. Harry, still tightly gripping Draco's right arm, tasted toothpaste and something that reminded him of firewhiskey, and he instantly felt intoxicated by the fact that he was tasting Draco. Draco Malfoy. His rival. His sworn enemy. He stumbled a bit into him, losing his footing for a moment, and Draco steadied him by winding his free hand into Harry's thick, wild black hair. He pulled gently, causing Harry's head to tilt back slightly and his mouth to open further, and Draco delved his tongue in deeper. Harry registered somewhere in his mind that he had just allowed himself to moan into Draco's mouth.
. He grit his teeth from the effort, his heart sinking as he looked up. With his luck, Harry had probably finally regained his sanity and was going to tell him to stop.
at him.
“You were all over her,” Harry stated, glancing over at him as he swayed a bit again.
He heard Harry huff a short, awkward laugh and his heart clenched from it, unable to stop his oncoming tears.
“Of course, Harry.”
"He doesn't need to-"
"Enjoying yourself, Potter?"
"Severus." Draco said quietly. Both sets of eyes, green and black, looked at him in surprise. "I can't do it anymore."
She knit her brows together, turning her head to look at him.
"I apologized for grabbing you. Unlike you, I try to respect others."
Water gently splashed against him as Harry moved through the spray to sit directly next to him on his left, Harry's thigh and knee pressed against his own. He swallowed back another sob - Harry's unprejudiced concern and kindness was too much for him.
Apparently unable to speak, Harry nodded again, still breathing hard.
"Oh yes, you were," he hissed back. "From the train to the astronomy tower, Potter, you stalked me. I bet all you thought about was me."
Draco looked as though Harry had slapped him, which Harry concluded was better than any hex could have ever been. It was not often one made Draco Malfoy lose his perfect composure.
"Then - then - I still have to -" he trailed off in a whisper.
"You know," Draco spoke first, his voice deeper than usual from sleep, "for some reason, a part of me thought you would leave, Potter."
“Jessie!” Their misbehaved sixteen-year-old acquaintance squealed back and embraced the other in a tight hug. “How have you
"Malfoy,” Harry said cautiously, “tell the wall your father is dead." Draco's left eyebrow quirked with curiosity while the rest of his face still expressed disdain.
Draco stared at him blankly, his expression perfectly unreadable. "My mother, Potter. She - she brings food here once a month." The facade of Malfoy's pride wore thin and Harry could hear the shame and embarrassment in his words. He lowered his wand.
"Malfoy?" he said in weak surprise and slightly lowered his wand.
"I - I want my cock in your mouth... Draco."
"Oh my g-
"Don't worry about it," Harry said, and for a second Draco blanched, intensely worried that Harry was able to read his mind until he saw Harry look at the clock.
“Who?” Hermione said interestedly, looking up at her husband as they came to a stop at a red pedestrian crossing signal.
"I'll stay in front," he said. He could feel Harry's warm breath on his face and although the Cloak had slightly dimmed their light, he was sure Harry was blushing again.
"Holy shit," he gasped. Entranced, Draco ground against him a second time. Harry's head fell back as he moaned, long and deep, head lightly thumping the tile wall. Crazed by the amount of lust consuming him, Draco bent his head down and licked the base of Harry's throat, dragging his hot tongue up to Harry's ear. He traced over the cartilage with the tip before sucking in the soft lobe.
"Say it out loud, then." Draco said, wanting to be absolutely sure he wasn't imagining it. "Tell me what you want, Harry.
“I’ve done a lot you don’t know about, Potter.” Malfoy said, giving him a look that made Harry’s newly permanent blush deepen even moreso.
“Wasn’t playing anything, Potter.” he said, not answering Harry’s second question as he tossed the butt away carelessly.
Harry let out a long, low sigh of frustration. He was inside the back of a closet bigger than the first floor the Dursley's modest home on Privet Drive when he had noticed it – a small, unassuming, piece of chipped paint on a bare wall.
Snape stared at him.
With his restraint gone, he sped up, his mouth matching the same brutal rhythm his hand had begun. Harry's back arched off of the wall, hands still tightly wound into Draco's hair as he thrust his hips to meet the erratic new pace, his mouth hanging open as he panted.
"Then at least tell me what he's threatening you with."
"You've been here this entire time? What - what about your family?"
When he was still uncertain, Snape bore his eyes into Draco's, and Draco suddenly felt the near-permanent impenetrable fortress around Snape's mind break away.
"So is that why you've been such a prick to me all these years?" he blurted out suddenly, verging on anger.
and then threw his own down near his foot, stepping on it.
Snape shot a spell at him non-verbally and Harry instantly became completely silent and immobile.
"What's he making you do?" Harry said, his quiet voice laced with unmistakable sadness.
he’s an Auror and you still let me say all that? How –”
? How’s life after Hogwarts?! Are you still with what's-his-name…?” she said, and her friend began to reply animatedly, pulling her away.
"I didn't expect you to take anything from me, Potter." His words made Harry's heart sink straight into his stomach. It made him sound like he had assaulted Draco, like it hadn't been consensual. But it had been, Harry told himself, hating the way his cock stirred as he remembered Draco hissing agreement into his ear.
"I don't give a shit, Malfoy, open up the damn wall."
Harry watched silently, remembering just how nervous he had been the first time this had happened a little over a year ago, and he was feeling just as nervous again, but his second child was only half the reason why.
Potter. I can’t help it if I’m better looking than you,” he said, smirk reappearing as his hand reached out to the wall to steady himself.
Maybe he was going mad. That had to be it. The stress of his life and responsibilities was finally getting to him. He was just imagining it. There was no way-
physically
Harry stood for everything Draco was supposed to be against. He
“Another nephew!” Ron exclaimed proudly as he broke their embrace, clapping Harry on the back. Hermione quickly went over to Ginny, who had still not stopped gaping at Harry, even as Hermione said “
"My aunt
Harry had said the name most feared in their world with such ease. He was so brave, so brilliant. So
"How revoltingly Gryffindor of you." Harry glared at Malfoy and quickly brushed past him as he walked into the previously hidden room. As his eyes adjusted, they landed on the source of the faint blue light, confirming what Harry already knew.
Harry's brows furrowed together, eyes sternly focusing on Malfoy's features, trying desperately to detect any trace of a lie. He found nothing but truth.
Whatever was behind the wall had to be incredibly incriminating - so much so that Lucius wanted to make sure no one would ever find it while he remained alive…
“Hey,” he whispered. He was holding him very carefully, still leaning into the bed very close to Ginny, not trusting his whiskey-laden motor skills enough to walk around the room safely with his newborn in his arms. “Welcome to the world, little guy.”
"Harry," Draco gasped, turning to him, drawing his wand. "Harry, I'm sorry."
"Yes, of course, lest I curse you from behind with the wand I don't have." Harry had been making his way over to the large room off to the left, directly behind Malfoy when he stopped.
Snape stopped, his lips pressed into a thin line from being interrupted, his black eyes darting between them.
“Whew, mate, you’re more sloshed than I am,” he laughed, clapping Harry on the shoulder. “Found ‘im, ‘Mione!” he yelled.
Draco looked at the dark pitch with a seeker's keen eye, looking for other fliers or perhaps some snogging couple in the stands - but it was mercifully empty. He mounted his broom and let his horrid stream of anxious thoughts trail behind him as he ascended. He felt marvelously free in the air. It had always brought him a genuine, innocent sense of joy ever since he was a small child.
"What does it look like?"
Draco, I - please, I'm -" Harry was a babbling mess above him and he knew that at this rate this was heading towards the end at full speed.
Harry,” she laughed again.
"Have you figured me out yet, Potter?" he said, so quietly Harry almost didn't hear.
Harry wasn't sure who had first closed that distance, but it was Malfoy who first let his tongue gently pry open Harry's lips, and Harry let him, opening his mouth and meeting Malfoy’s tongue with his own. Malfoy tasted exactly the same as he did – firewhiskey and cigarettes – and the sober voice in his head, no longer polite, was screaming at him from far away to cease and desist this insanity
“Ahh,” Malfoy nodded. “How’d you manage to get in here?”
"Oh. Then - then you -"
. And he was able to block his mind from his own mother, Snape, and even the fucking
It was impossible to concentrate knowing that tomorrow morning he had detention with
His own memory from only two nights ago swam through his mind.
To Draco's complete surprise, Harry laughed.
Ginny gaped at him as the assistant then attached the bracelet to the baby’s tiny right wrist, which had been gently pulled from the bundle. Finished with her work, she happily started out of the room, telling them “I’ll let your brother back in now!” as she left.
"Draco," he said, barely above a whisper. It made Malfoy falter for a single second.
He felt so heavy - weighted down by life's pressures. He pushed his glasses back on, staring out of the Gryffindor Tower window. The pressure pushed into him from all angles, firmly rooting him to the ground - making him decide that maybe the ground was exactly what he needed to get away from.
“Changed your ways, then, Malfoy? Grew a heart over the last six years?”
The Baron nodded. He seemed to be struggling with himself and Draco wondered when the last time he had ever spoken like this to a student was - or if he had ever done so in his long afterlife.
Then he felt Potter's right arm moving up and was sure that Harry was
"Obliviate."
Harry was about to say to hell with it and go back inside the room and view the damn memory for himself, or at least what he could stomach of it, when he heard a choked sob.
. And while the answer to Harry's rhetorical question was mostly yes, The Dark Lord had nothing much to do with his tears this time.
with Malfoy,”
“Yeah, Harry! You can do it!”
"I am," he said, finally pulling his lips away and panting. "I want it. I've wanted you so bad, Harry." He saw lust replace the shock - whether from using his first name or the blatant confession, he didn't know - on the brunette's face.
"I told you, he was hit by a car."
Hermione laughed and blushed as Ron wrapped an arm around her. Harry’s vision blurred and he brought a hand up to his face.
"I find you
He had said that in utter sarcasm, but then Blaise had said:
do if Draco came on to him.
"Of course," she said to herself.
Draco looked up and caught Harry's intense gaze as he slowly wrapped his lips around the first inch of Harry's cock. Harry must have been holding his breath, because he quickly expelled all the air in his lungs.
"I - wait.
“I admire a man who can hold his liquor,” she gave him a flirty little laugh. Harry watched Malfoy’s smirk spread into a small, devilish grin as he looked at her, taking in the show.
"I think you have," Draco gently pushed Harry's wand arm down, and Harry let him. Draco's hands found Harry's shoulders and he slowly pushed off the thick robe. It fell in the shape of a half circle on the marble floor. Harry felt Draco's palms reappear on his chest. He trailed long, delicate fingers down over the material, stopping at the waistband of Harry's jeans.
He then delicately touched the top of it near his left shoulder, his middle and index fingers tracing the path down towards his right hip. This time he didn't hold back the sound he made.
"So, you have some sort of past-curfew privilege, I take it?" he said, relief flooding him.
"I like you calling me Harry better."
“It’s a boy!” the Healer announced to them, as they had chosen not to know until this very moment. Harry, still guilt ridden though he was, leaned in and kissed Ginny sweetly, tears prickling at his eyes as the assistant brought a bundle over to their arms.
this time of night?"
He was thankful she spent so much time in the library. The common room was fairly empty; Fridays meant most students were all out enjoying their wonderful, happy lives with friends or significant others in Hogsmeade.
"...No."
“Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, could you please wait in the hall?” The Healer’s assistant politely asked them.
About 20 or so minutes later, Draco reluctantly began to make his way back to the ground, spiraling the length of the pitch down as slowly as he could - never wanting the blissful feeling to end.
“Good-bye, Steathers, Happy Birthday!” Hermione said brightly to the Auror who had his right cheek pressed to the sticky bar counter, surrounded by empty pint glasses. She pulled them outside into the night on the busy London street. Smiling, she turned to them.
“No,” she said, exhaling as well and expertly flicking the first ash that had formed. “I’m staying the weekend with a friend who has a flat on the west side. He’s inside with his boyfriend on the floor – they’ve been at it dancing all night.” She smiled, taking another drag of her cigarette and looking Malfoy up and down. “X.” she stated, rolling her eyes about it, and Malfoy nodded in understanding while Harry felt stupidly oblivious.
Severus swallowed. "For how long?" he rasped after him.
It took Malfoy every bit of self-restraint he had to not let his shock show.
” he continued, and Harry definitely heard the slur in Malfoy’s low voice this time, “and
As the crowd around their table thinned out a bit, the waitress returned, expertly holding a tray above her head with one hand and turning to her side to move between the patrons. She carefully set it down on the table in front of Harry.
"Yeah. If you stay close," he replied, and Draco felt triumph burst in his chest at Potter's blush.
"Genuinely want an answer," he finished for him. Harry was looking at him more carefully now and he knew his own pale cheeks were flushed. There was no way Harry would miss the unmistakable tent he was pitching.
"Ah, how lovely. It took you two killing curses and a war to grow a brain."
"That's it, Malfoy, I've had it. I'm going to detain you." Harry started moving forward towards him.
"No." Draco said.
He heard Harry's breath hitch and he wrapped his hand around the base of the hard length in front of his face, the little finger of his right hand disappearing into a thick patch of wet, black curls. He licked his lips, his mouth practically watering for it as he quickly leaned in.
A nearby clock showed him it was 9:13pm. He had just enough time to make it down to the Quidditch pitch and fly for a bit. With the final game on tomorrow and nearly everyone most likely to currently be in Hogsmeade, he was sure it would be empty.
“What?!” she exclaimed, her eyes going wide at Harry. “No!”
His courage peaking again at his best friend’s words, his fingers quickly enclosed around the glass and he brought it up to his lips, knocking the vicious liquid back to an eruption of cheers.
"Don't -" he gasped, running his palm flat back up over it. If Harry decided to let this go any further, he wanted to make sure it had nothing to do with guilt. "Don't feel
"We want to see the Headmaster. It's important."
"He was a muggle." Draco's voice was hoarse. Harry couldn't believe what he had just heard. He had just assumed that Draco would have never encountered a muggle willingly. He assumed the boy Draco had called his best friend could have only been another wizard. "He was a muggle, and he was my best friend." He said again, as if he had heard Harry's thoughts.
"I - I'm sorry," he whispered back, unable to shake the image in his mind. He had gone mad, he decided. Here he was, in a gigantic closet, with a wanted ex-Death Eater who was finally showing him a little bit of heart by confiding a traumatic experience to him, and all Harry could think of at that moment was how it would feel to kiss him. He felt terrible.
noticed, however, was unmistakably a moan.
hand. However, as great as that would definitely be, he was dead set on bringing Potter to completion with his mouth.
Malfoy had to force away his prominent Slytherin nature and spoiled upbringing that called for him to disobey order and take what he wanted
A few seconds later Snape gasped, and Draco looked back at him again. Snape hadn't needed to break into his mind to finally figure it out.
Potter getting angry never failed to turn him on. He felt his cock throb and he dared himself to inch forward again.
Biting down on his bottom lip, he let his hands roam up over Harry's biceps and shoulders, bringing them down to wander over his chest. His fingertips grazed over dark nipples, and he felt Harry's breathing quicken. He gently slid his neatly manicured fingernails down Harry's abdomen, watching with awe as the muscle beneath flexed involuntarily. His fingers reached the waistband of Harry's jeans once more, but they didn't stop this time. They ghosted over Harry's cock, hard underneath the denim. Harry gasped at the feather-light touch, sending a slight shiver through his body. Malfoy leaned in and kissed Harry again, swallowing the groan he made as he pressed his palm down, rubbing over the material. Draco could feel his hand getting hot from the friction of it.
He was close enough now that he could hear the small whimper that escaped from the other man - a sound he knew from his own experience that orgasm was near.
"Right, then figure out what passphrase your demented father set on this damn thing."
"What - what did you do to me?" he said, aware that something was very wrong.
“What’s wrong, Harry?” she said, seeing his face.
For one long, terrifying moment, nothing happened except shallow breathing through noses nearly pressed together side by side as their lips gently touched.
Potter? There are over a thousand people at Hogwarts, it really could be anyone...
“Mmm. I see. Good thing Law Enforcement doesn’t know then, yes?” he asked her quietly, looking at Harry pointedly. She caught the look and immediately looked terrified.
He was going to be killed. His attempts had failed and he
"I don't know, do I? Probably somewhere in Germany. And last I checked Potter, full grown adults do not require parental supervision."
Draco still wouldn't meet his gaze. "Look, I - we - we shouldn't have -" Although it was the truth, it was the wrong thing to say. Draco shot up, staring him right in the face, eyes ablaze.
"Mother probably left food in the kitchens if you're hungry," he continued, head down, returning from his closet while he buttoned up his vest. "It's probably not much, just some eggs, breads, cheese and the like, but you're welcome to-" Draco stopped, having finished buttoning his vest and finally looking up at Harry, who was pointing his wand directly at him.
Ginny’s just gone into labor!” she said excitedly, smile growing bigger.
He was still wildly drunk beyond measure, and he couldn’t for the life of him recall any names that he had been possibly considering. Come to think of it, he wasn't sure if he had even given it thought prior to now. He wracked his brain not just for any names, but names that were meaningful. Very meaningful.
He knew why Draco didn't reject him earlier, why Draco had tormented him endlessly at school, why Draco couldn't kill Dumbledore when he had the chance. He knew why Draco didn't give him away when the snatchers had brought them here. The pure emotion of it all struck Harry like a bludger and Harry's mind whirled, thinking of Ron and Hermione's ceaseless bickering for years on end, of Dumbledore's tears of pain and regret over Grindelwald, of Severus Snape, who went to his grave still hopelessly in love with his mother.
"What are you doing, Malfoy?"
"You - you're lying," he said, hot tears beginning to fall.
"The other part figured you'd be too noble." Harry managed a small smile in return, and then Draco was slowly leaning into him, giving Harry all the time in the world to change his mind, to turn away, to flee, but he didn't. He knew he wanted it, despite everything. He selfishly let Draco kiss him and it was terribly wonderful.
He would die without ever having known what Potter - stupid, brave Gryffindor that he was - would
Draco began to protest but Snape grabbed him by the front of his robes.
"And what if I don't say it?" Harry breathed back. Draco was sure his heart was about to pound its way straight out of his chest and fall onto the wet floor.
"I thought I told you to leave, Potter."
Draco knew there could only be one other person at Hogwarts who was as crazy as he was to fly the pitch less than an hour before curfew...
"Say what?" he asked, his eyes nervously darting back and forth between Malfoy's grey ones to his pink, flushed lips, standing out against his pale skin.
"H - how did you get in here?" he asked the ghostly figure of The Bloody Baron, instantly thinking he was rather stupid for doing so. From the look on The Baron's face, he thought the same.
"You clearly failed my every attempt to teach you, Potter. You could never possess the amount of skill required to block the likes of the Dark Lord from your mind."
his mind asked. He had finally decided his own path at long last and he wasn't going to turn away from it without a fight. Not when Harry had pleaded with him. Not now when he finally knew exactly what it felt like to hold Harry's hand and press their lips together. He would teach Harry Occlumency himself morning, noon and night if he had to.
"I couldn't do that," Harry said truthfully, his heart breaking at Draco’s smile.
On Friday evening, the night before the final Quidditch match of the year - the very Quidditch match that just so happened to be the one that determined whether or not Gryffindor would beat Slytherin for the Cup - Harry Potter was nearly at his breaking point.
"If you think it's so damn funny I'll detain you right now!" Harry said, nostrils flaring as he took a step closer and raised his wand higher. Malfoy stopped laughing but his sneer remained.
He was very aware that Harry was intently watching him. He suspected it was because Harry was either still suspicious of him or expected him to get cold feet and change his mind - or both, regardless of the fact that they had just intimately showered together after mutual mind-blowing orgasms.
"M- Malfoy," he squeaked, his left hand wiping excess water from his face before he quickly cleared his throat. "If - if you don't get the hell out of here in the next ten seconds, I'll hex your bollocks off."
Draco quickly glanced at Harry, but instantly regretted it as a blush crept across his face. "I said that father was dead."
Snape inhaled sharply through his long, hooked nose, his hand clenching around his wand.
"Stupid Gryffindor," Draco murmured, but Harry heard no malice in his voice. He looked into grey eyes, letting the fabric of Draco's undershirt slip from his hand, and suddenly, like someone was connecting a jigsaw puzzle in his mind, everything clicked together.
Draco nodded in terror.
"Are you quite sure, Potter?" he said.
"Good. We're on the same page, then, Scarhead," he said, his trademark smirk appearing on his lips that were still only an inch away from Harry's. And although it was true, that these recent occurrences would never change the fact that Draco would always be Draco and Harry would always be Harry, things had changed, and things would still change.
"I can't - I can't," Harry choked out after only a few intense moments of fucking his mouth. "Draco, I'm - I'm going to -
. First his mother, then his father. He would then die next, of course, only after he had suffered from watching his parents die. His mind drifted to a certain someone who had suffered a nearly identical circumstance, albeit they were fortunately too young to remember the horror of it.
And if he couldn't tell Ron, talking to Hermione about it just felt like he'd be betraying him somehow. Not to mention the whole thing would be incredibly embarrassing. He heaved with a heavy sigh, pulling his glasses off and letting them clatter to the table, roughly rubbing his closed eyes.
again, and some people were whooping or whistling while others laughed.
Harry glared at him. He couldn’t possibly have–
," Harry whined, clutching at his back and pressing his cock forward. Draco grabbed hold of Harry's biceps hard to keep himself from coming in his pants, his own answering moan only a hum through lips still closed around the soft flesh of Harry's earlobe.
At least twenty minutes, a lot of panting, pushing and hand squeezing later, the sound of a baby crying had filled the room along with Ginny’s gasping from her efforts.
she said happily, and Harry couldn’t stop the hot tears that began to run down his face as he looked back into his mother’s green eyes.
“Welcome to the world, Al!”
"Mother of Merlin, Potter." Draco said, realizing the extent of Harry's limited knowledge.
more came our way, an’ the waitress told us Malfoy said that
He felt his heart swelling, his emotions beginning to overwhelm him. Harry had been destined to kill The Dark Lord for much, much longer than Draco had been to Dumbledore. And yet Harry was always still kind, still caring - still so strong through all he had endured. One would never know from talking to him that half the Wizarding World was counting on him to be their savior. He couldn't understand it. He knew what that pressure was like, now; he had the entire Dark side expecting him to do something he wasn't sure he was even capable of. And where Harry was a pillar of strength, he was a crumbling ruin, soon to fall apart for good any day now.
“Ah,” Malfoy sighed, his laughter finally subsiding. “Merlin, I need a smoke,” he said, standing up and swaying back a bit, grabbing the pack he had put on the table.
He approached Harry, stopping a few inches away.
"Ohgodohgodoh-" Harry chanted as he watched his cock disappear inch by inch into Malfoy's hot, eager mouth. Draco pulled back after meeting wet curls, his cheeks hollowed from sucking as he went. He stopped at the head, continuing to suck and swirl his tongue around it, purposely tormenting the brunette. Both hands were back in his hair again and Draco forcefully held his hips back, preventing him from bucking. "
I'm gonna come, I'm gonna come,
"Of course." he parroted quietly. "Bombarda!" Malfoy instinctively ducked for cover as Harry exclaimed the explosive spell. Nothing happened.
“Oh, I
“Potter?” she said, eyes widening. “Wait –
"I just want to know who he was to you.” Malfoy turned his back to him. “You said you knew him. Was he your friend?" That's what did it. Harry saw his shoulders tense at the word. Draco’s emotions managed to find a crack in his mental shield and they ripped and tore through it until he was screaming.
"I was hoping you would." Harry said, still speaking quietly.
“Ah! Mr. Potter! Your wife’s just in here,” she said, holding the door open for them.
"You're right. They don't. That's not an answer to my question, though." Harry was not about to let Malfoy get away with half-truths and indirect answers. Draco must have sensed this of him, judging by the way his eyes narrowed. A moment later he spoke in a dangerously low voice.
Harry tried to continue concentrating on his Transfiguration essay with a scowl.
If Draco was successful with his mission, he certainly would not be returning to Hogwarts next year and therefore this miraculous opportunity would never happen again. And if Draco was unsuccessful - he would die.
"Er, sorry," he said quickly, snapping his hand back. Draco gaped at him at for a moment, and Harry was glad to have his sudden strange emotions replaced with irritation. "What?"
"They're not imbeciles, Severus. They'll run if I tell them why they have to."
“Er, thanks,” he said awkwardly, looking up at Malfoy again, and Malfoy was saying “You’re an idiot,” before somehow their mouths were pressed together.
"Right," he said, turning towards them and speaking to Narcissa. "I - I'll be finishing up my search, then. I should be done in half an hour." She nodded her understanding. Harry caught Draco's stunned gaze briefly as he left them there, wishing he hadn't. He knew that by letting Narcissa go, he was losing Draco. While apparition wasn't impossible without a wand, it was immeasurably more difficult. If Draco had decided to get the hell out of there by side-along with his mum, Harry would not have blamed him for doing so.
“Potter, I highly doubt-”
me?" Draco could see the muscles in his right arm flex briefly and his mouth went dry.
The assistant handed him a quill as he walked over to her and he leaned down to the table to write on the parchment.
With an audible gulp, Harry looked back up at him, his expression full of confusion.
me who sent -"
Draco stared at him hard.
“Only –” he gasped. “Only Harry
"I - Draco, I can't just -" he watched Draco turn away quickly, nearly leaping off his bed as Harry's heart sank further by the second. Draco grabbed his undershirt from the floor and practically ripped it down over his head, taking long, fast strides back to his closet where Harry knew he'd be retrieving the rest of his clothes. Harry, whose mind had been clouded with a hundred emotions, suddenly realized with a shock that both the vials and his wand were currently discarded with his cloak on the bathroom floor.
"Then the Dark Lord will kill
Harry suddenly pulled his head back by his hair with one hand, his other wrapping around his own cock to firmly press it against Draco's right cheek and Draco now knew he had been gloriously wrong.
"What?! That's bullsh-"
That didn't go over so well. Ron ranted loud enough for the whole department to hear, ending with "I'll be damned if my sister sits at your beck and call!" and a fist slamming down on to the breakroom table. Ron had left before Harry could explain further, and when he arrived home to their shared flat later that night, Ron's things were gone.
Harry, who had already been flushed from his face down to the top of his chest, turned practically the same shade of scarlet as one-half of Gryffindor's house colours.
it would –” he swallowed thickly, eyeing Malfoy’s look of disbelief, still feeling ashamed all these years later.
Should he ring the bell? Knock politely? Pound on the door with one fist and threateningly shout, 'Auror Department, open up!'? He decided against a barbaric approach and proceeded to knock somewhat politely on the door. So far, the only lead he and Ron had discovered was that the Malfoys had probably fled the country after the battle nearly six months ago, possibly to stay with extended family somewhere in Germany. The Malfoy case had certainly taken less precedence over some of the more pertinent ones, such as that of the whereabouts of Fenrir Greyback. Harry shuddered, mostly over the fact that they had not yet caught the murderous werewolf and partially over the chilly November air. He knocked again, harder. He was not exactly sure what he was expecting, or why he was knocking on the door of a mansion whose former residents had most likely just went on permanent holiday. They had only just been granted permission for search and seizure from Kingsley three days ago, to which Harry and Ron had been assigned to act upon by  their direct superior.
Draco huffed. "What about them, Potter?"
"Then why are you here?"
His extreme satisfaction with this fascinating revelation was quickly replaced with annoyance. Harry had still only blinked in silence, his confusion palpable, and Draco wondered if Harry knew his own family history. It had been required of him to learn his own, as per tradition.
"Yes." Harry whispered, though his expression seemed to say otherwise. He lowered his wand so as to not jab Malfoy in the chest with it and marveled at the sight of him.
Draco felt his feet moving before his mind could catch up to what he was doing. It seemed that his brain had already made the decision for him. That, or his cock had, pushing hard against the front of his trousers. He tried willing himself to breathe correctly.
He had always been told that muggles were practically less than human. He was told that any witch or wizard whose blood had been tainted by muggles made them far less superior. He was told that it was his duty as the sole male heir to uphold the Malfoy family name and it's centuries-long traditions. He had never been told
Draco looked away as he broke into an answering smile, something he knew was extremely rare for himself.
broke the last bit of self-restraint he had. He hurriedly wrapped a fist around his own aching member, his lips buzzing against the silk-soft skin of Harry's dick as they caught his own moan.
ensure a pureblood-centric society?"
Draco bit his bottom lip hard. It was
The girl between them giggled.
“Ex- what?” he asked, realizing that he forgot to ash as he went to attempt a second drag and quickly doing so. He inhaled carefully and surprisingly didn’t feel an urge to cough this time.
Before Draco could nod or say some idiotic cliché line like 'ready as I'll ever be' although it was true, the statue began to move and Harry stepped back in surprise.
No one would know.
going to hex him until he felt a fist - still tightly enclosed around a wand - press into his shoulder blade. It brought him just the tiniest bit closer, increasing the pressure of their closed-mouth kiss just so.
In the last shower stall on the right at the back of the steamy room stood a young man with jet-black hair that only hung flat because it was held down by a stream of hot water. That water flowed over broad shoulders and prominent shoulder blades, down into the deep dip of lower back and over the round curves of his arse - separating into vertical rivers running over toned, muscled thighs and legs. He was bent forward slightly, his left hand splayed out on the wall in front of him. His right arm, half blocked from view, was moving in a rapid motion. Draco tore his eyes away to the pile of clothes resting nearby on a dry shower bench and saw scarlet and gold there - not that he needed any further confirmation.
“No – I – ah, why? Do I – ah – do I not seem – OW,
"Oh fuck,
"Potter, Malfoy - what are you two doing here?" he spat. "Potter, if you -"
"But - but my father is still -"
“Really?!” Hermione said, brushing away the hair that the wind had blown in her face.
He felt the fabric of the Cloak slipping through his fingers as Harry pulled it, stepping closer to him.
Harry should have punched him. He should have thrown Malfoy away in disgust. He should not have closed his eyes and moaned. Catching himself, Harry's eyes snapped back open, and Malfoy was smiling. Not smirking. Not even sneering. There was a smile on the blonde's mouth, and Harry was momentarily stupefied by his beauty.
This didn't seem to change anything.
“Not exactly, love,” he said, and Harry suspected Malfoy wasn’t as immune to the effects of alcohol as he had claimed to be earlier that evening.
"That wasn't a joke and you know it." Harry gritted through his teeth. Malfoy laughed again, and Harry jabbed the tip of his wand into Malfoy's chest.
"Who was he?" Harry asked softly, looking up again when Draco did not respond immediately. This short moment of impassive silence made Harry realize Draco only became unreadable when confronted with anything that warranted emotions beyond malice and conceit. He didn't know why he had never realized that before. That Malfoy was merely acting the way he had been told to act. That Malfoy's ideologies and idiosyncrasies belonged to that of his father, expected to be dutifully carried on by his only son. Harry didn't realize until that moment just how awful having Lucius Malfoy for a father could have been.
“Ooh, like what?” she cooed, stepping closer to Malfoy and shamelessly flirting.
“Better, my
Their cocks brushed lightly together, both still hard and leaking with need, and Draco moaned into Harry's mouth. Harry laid his palm flat against Draco's chest, aggravated by the fabric he found there, and reached down to grab the bottom hem. "Don't," Draco gasped, quickly pulling away and grabbing Harry's hand.
The girl sighed in relief and Malfoy huffed a short laugh. She hit him on the arm playfully.
Harry, exhibiting an equal enthusiasm, pulled against his shoulder blades hard, forcing Draco forward. Their bodies were suddenly pressed flush against one another.
Kissing Malfoy was more intoxicating than all twenty of the shots they had consumed together combined. Harry had never,
"A peacock?" he whispered in bewilderment, lowering his wand as unwanted memories began flooding their way back into his mind. As soon as his heart rate returned to normal, Harry removed his gaze from the majestic bird and continued towards the manor ahead. The last time he had seen that albino peacock he was being dragged up this path against his will, along with Dean, Griphook, Ron and Hermione.
"How long have you … wanted this?"
"I assure you I've already showed you all the Manor's secrets." Harry was still pointing his wand at the offending spot.
"It was punishment, Potter! Punishment for befriending a filthy muggle!"
"You're so easy, Potter," Draco said with his familiar smirk, uncrossing his arms and moving to grip the ledge. Harry looked at him, panic rising. What if Malfoy told everyone? What if he used it as blackmail? Harry thought of obliviating Draco, and immediately felt horrible about himself.
Draco nodded, lowering his hands. Six years... it had to be one hell of a strong Disillusionment charm, even though it didn't explain the weightlessness of the fabric.
"You want it?" Harry rasped, his head bent forward and the water from his hair dripping onto Draco's face. He looked nearly feral with his chest heaving, pressing his cock harder against Draco's cheek, still forcefully holding his head back by his hair. If not for the mild pain he felt at the back of his skull, Draco would have been absolutely sure he was having the most fantastic dream. He moaned as he opened his mouth for it, his erection jumping from his own act of submission.
"I'm afraid the Headmaster is resting, Potter, as it is nearly... midnight," he said through his teeth.
, Malfoy,” he said, knocking it back. He immediately reached for the second and then the third, doing the same.
"You know what needs to happen, Draco." Snape said quietly.
“Yeah, ‘m serious!” he said, swaying dangerously on his stool. “It was in – wrote ‘n – writ in – written in – that damn Potions book tha’ was Snape’s,” he said, old memories swirling around in his mind hazily. "So I jus’ said it – I had no
Then he licked the wet, golden skin in front of him, pressing searing, open-mouthed kisses further down while his knees slowly,
"Ah, so you, er - so you know that then," he said lamely.
he has your eyes! Ron, look –” Ron went over to stand behind Hermione, hands on her shoulders, peering over her left one.
"Don't worry. I'm very good at pretending to be someone I'm not." His long, pale fingers gracefully swept away his own tears and he resumed his haughty, arrogant stature. He gave Snape a curt nod and turned on his heels towards the dungeons.
"Yeah," Harry whispered, accompanied by a small nod. "Yeah."
, may I?” excitedly, and Ginny nodded dumbly.
“You’re friends?” she asked him, her eyes twinkling.
. He wanted to feel that desperate, sinful mouth back on his, but fuck.
“Better go see what the Weasel wants, Potter.” he breathed, reaching for his cigarettes again. Harry felt his heart leap into his throat.
"Touched a nerve, have I?" And there was that stupid smirk which Harry had the sudden urge to knock off Malfoy's face with his fist. He could feel the muscles in his right arm flex on their own accord.
“Right, then,” she said smiling. “Here you are… six more fire shots.” She set three down in a line in front of him, delicately holding each one between the thumb and middle fingers of her right hand as she did so. She placed the others down in the same fashion across the table in front of none other than Draco Malfoy, who had started all this nonsense, the bastard. He tipped her three galleons and she beamed at him before disappearing again.
His charade was finally over. He looked to Harry searching for an answer, and Harry gave it to him with a kiss. It was nothing like earlier, no ferocity, no frustration. It was slow and sweet and filled with unspoken understanding and need. Draco's hands gathered the fabric of Harry's t-shirt, lifting it out of his jeans. It snagged on the metal back of the button closure, and Draco broke their kiss.
to look up at Malfoy as he leaned in with his cigarette to the flame. Sucking in, the tip glowed orange and he promptly tried to stop himself from coughing. Malfoy, a knowing smirk on his face, brought the flame up to his own, sucking in deeply and then exhaling a large plume of smoke in a sigh of relief that sounded far too sexual for Harry’s comfort. He shifted his weight from his left foot to his right, trying not to sway, looking away from Malfoy and cursing firewhiskey for making him feel so pleasantly insane.
, Harry?" he said, the second use of his name still making him feel like he was speaking some undiscovered ancient language. "Say it."
Draco, apparently forgetting who he was and how he was supposed to act, gaped from his mother to Harry, not sure who he was more in awe of - his mother, for effectively lying to Lord Voldemort, or Harry Potter, the boy who wouldn't die.
Harry looked positively alarmed.
"Don't touch me, Potter," he hissed as he jerked his left shoulder out of Harry's right hand. The motion made multiple strands of his white blonde hair dislodge themselves from their neat, combed back positions and take up new residence in front of his grey eyes. Harry became slightly concerned that he noticed such a trivial thing, but the stinging emotion of hurt he felt at Draco's words positively alarmed him.
The bizarre nature of the random question shook him for a second.
Harry was walking sluggishly, wishing Ron would stop where this was going –
Not wasting another moment, Draco gave Harry what they both wanted. He wrapped his lips around the head of Harry's cock, his groan drowned out by the near-scream Harry made.
"There's nothing here," Draco continued, in that superior tone of his that made Harry's skin crawl.
“Oh, I think that’s
"Er… what?"
He could see the rapid rise and fall of Harry's chest and Harry slowly shook his head, green eyes still bearing into him hard.
"It's Voldemort, isn't it?" Harry asked him quietly, though it wasn't a question.
His impossibly hard cock, now free from the only thing that had contained it, sprang forward, wrenching a noise of relief out of him. He stepped out of his trousers, kicking them backwards through the running water with the heel of his foot, now clothed only in his open, wet cotton button-down.
“Can I join you?” the girl asked him enthusiastically.
To top it all off, the only thing he had finally caught Malfoy in the act of was crying. Actually
"Potter," Malfoy drawled, arms crossed while he leaned against said bare wall, "Did it ever occur to you that it could just be chipped paint?"
“Gin –” he said quietly. “I’m – I am really sorry, though,” he said, although he wasn’t sure if he would ever be able to tell her the real reason why.
Harry had very gently turned Draco's left arm over. There was no need to roll his shirtsleeve up; The Dark Mark was so prominent against the porcelain-white skin of his forearm that it showed through the soaked, nearly transparent cotton.
, love,” Malfoy said, moving in closer.
“I’m in – I mean, I
was in
Harry tore himself away from Malfoy with a gasp.
"Were you two fighting?" she asked loudly. Draco's eyes were wide with what must have been fear, and all Harry could manage was an ‘er,’ before Narcissa quickly drew her wand. "If you have hurt one hair on my Draco's head, I will-"
"That's not true," he lied again quickly, horrified that Malfoy was mostly right. Other than horcruxes and his infatuation with Ginny, Harry had been obsessed with the other man. The taps to the tub magically stopped at the perfect water capacity.
The man across from Harry leaned over to her, whispering in her ear. She nodded and smiled, pulling back from him, wiping her hands on her black apron as she turned away and disappeared through the crowd.
He stepped another inch closer.
knows that Golden Boy over there was in
"But Potter's a lot better than Scarhead, at least." Harry said with a smile.
"Listen," Harry said, feeling the familiar rage he experienced in nearly every encounter with the blonde standing in front of him. "You are a wanted man, Malfoy. The ministry has been diligently searching for you and your family since the day after the battle." Malfoy laughed at this, furthering Harry’s anger.
- completely hard.
"I was not stalking you," Harry lied.
“Ten to ten!” the girl laughed. “Boy, you two really go at it
Moments later, Harry and Draco found themselves alone.
His stomach churned. Why was it marked? Who had marked it? Inhaling deeply to calm himself, Harry magically confiscated the book. He would have to interrogate Draco about that at some point. When he found nothing else on the shelves, he examined the rest of the room. Dressers, tables, chairs, the four-poster, an ornate mirror, and even a throw rug were all inspected to be perfectly normal. Harry, who had knelt on the floor to examine the rug, stood up and made his way to the door in the far-right corner. Opening it slowly, he found himself walking into a closet only half the size of the previous one and desperately hoped there would not be another suspicious spot of chipped paint. He quickly noticed another door directly to his right. He leaned over and grabbed the silver handle to open it, but it was locked.
