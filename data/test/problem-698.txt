“If you must know, I was in the midst of a relaxing bath. It was so rudely interrupted by your Gryffindor husband bursting into my private lavatory and summoning me from my tub where he then Apparated my dirty work robes onto me and physically pushed me in here. Where you stood catatonic and most distressed. Now that you are neither, I am going to return to my bath. Do. Not. Disturb me again.” In true Snape fashion, he whirled about and stormed off, slamming their bedroom door behind him.
Silence was her answer. She looked up at a shocked Draco Malfoy, eyes wide and mouth open. “We never… We didn’t think about that. I’m having a child out of wedlock! Great Morgana, I’m a shame to all purebloods everywhere!” His eyes welled up with tears as he turned to look up at Harry. “What are we going to do? Whose name are we going to give it? What will people say? Whose heir will this be? What rights will it have to your ancestry, or my ancestry? Who-?”
A hoard of Weasleys descended upon the castle in a sea of ginger hair and freckles. Fred and George were setting off indoor fire crackers that spelled out ‘Happy Birthday!’ and ‘Harry’s the best!’ and other such things. Ron and Hermione were sitting on a loveseat near the birthday boy, discussing their plans for the upcoming year while Harry kept an eye on Draco. Harry’s friends Neville, Luna, Dean, and Seamus were there. Gryffindors Parvati Patil (and her twin Padma) and Cormac McLaggen were too. From the Quidditch team, Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson, Alicia Spinnet, Demelza Robins, Andrew Kirke, Jack Sloper, and Jimmy Peakes all showed up.
He also loved Harry’s hand at the small of his back. It rubbed and kneaded just when and where he needed it to. All without him telling his lover. Of course, just lying there meant he had a lot of time to think. So he thought about their marriage. It was an old hand fasting, something his father would have flipped shiz about had he witnessed it. Draco smiled. That was okay with him. Of course, thinking about his family got him upset. He wanted to see them again, even if it was only to be ridiculed and disowned before Harry jumped in to save him from their painful words. He wanted to see his mum, and his father. Severus had said that Lucius had tried to warn him, that he didn’t want his son to go through the pain and suffering that he himself went through. Surely that counted for something?
“Well, come along. Draco says that you have a way of seeing things around you. I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised with how Draco has designed a small portion of the Great Hall for this occasion. He put a lot of thought into this, and wanted everything to be perfect for you.” She looked sideways and saw the slightly shocked expression on her student’s face. “Yes, Mr. Potter… Harry. He did all of this for you. I know he is a pureblood and that it is against his upbringing to have a child before he is married, but he wants you to be happy as well. He thought about you when deciding many things.
“You cannot eat in the Great Hall, Draco,” Snape corrected. “If someone sees either of you, it could blow the cover story we have of you in the hospital wing and Potter training. Maybe you can go out, but not with Harry.” That idea was quickly shot down by the silent boy-who-lived. “And of course Poppy will be there. I only know what I needed for the course and to stay alive these last several years. While I may be able to do your check-ups on my own, I may miss something that could be vital to you or your child’s health. We wouldn’t want that, now would we?”
Draco’s hand stilled, and his arms wrapped around him protectively. Lucius Malfoy took a step forward without thinking, refusing to allow any harm to possibly come near his child. And if his child was having his own child, then the protection was even more needed.
I no own, so you no sue. I don’t own any characters or settings from the Harry Potter books. Those belong to J. K. Rowling. I would be so very happy if she’d allow me the use of one or two… or three of them, but I know she won’t so don’t try anything. Thank you, that is all.
“Mr. Potter-Malfoy. We combined named when we married,” Draco answered. He took another sip of water. “That will come in due time. Shortly, in fact. Our detention was in the Forbidden Forest, as I said. As seventh years, along with Hagrid, we were surely able to find some hippogriffs. Instead, Harry and I were separated from Hagrid. Instead of staying on the path as instructed,
And that was the end of the fiasco of the beginning of Harry’s adult life. Moral of the story: ask questions before storming off to Jamaica like a two year old who’s rich enough to do so.
Except, as he looked back now, every adventure in that forest was another tilt, another change in his mindset. He thought he’d found his place in this new world, a place where he was happy and content. He was happy, damn it! He had friends, he had enemies, he knew his place in the school and mostly in the world. But one detention threw all those plans to hell and back. And yet... And yet he was so grateful for that experience.
“It’s my child too, you know. It’s doing well. Look, I’m getting fatter every day. Madam Pomfrey says I should have gained two stone by now! Can you imagine that? Two stone? What’s worse is she says I should gain almost another half a stone by the birthing. She also said the baby is actually a baby now and not just a bunch of cells grouped together. And sometimes, I can feel it moving. And it should weigh about a pound all on its own in there. And I’m over halfway done now. And soon we’ll have a baby. Oh, Merlin. Soon we’ll have a baby. Soon. As in, three or four months. Oh, Merlin, I’m not ready. I’m not ready to have a baby! Harry, I’m not ready!”
“Anyways, it charged us and chased after us. Harry runs rather fast, in case anyone was wondering. I, however, do not. He had to practically pull me along behind him. Then he levitated me up into a tree before climbing up himself. The bicorn proceeded to ram the tree, forcing us to hold on for our lives. He kept it up for over three hours. Harry blasted hexes and curses at it, trying to get it to go away, but I think it only made it madder. Just before that third hour was up, the worst possible thing happened. I dropped my wand. It had been in my inner robe pocket, and all the jostling around got it loose. The bicorn trampled it before it got bored with us and left.”
“Ooh! Does that mean you’re thinking of us staying here? Because I like it here,” Harry said in between bites of fried ham. “This is really good Blaise. Is there anymore?”
“He’s pregnant. He and Harry are together. Something’s wrong with Harry. He’s a pureblood and they’ve been back for a month, so I’m going to assume they’ve gotten married since they got here. Look, even his father doesn’t know.” Ron motioned at Malfoy senior, at the look of shock that clearly stood out on his face. “You give too much away with your emotions. That last outburst told me everything I needed to know.” He stood and started walking toward the door. “We will return when Harry is conscious, and he can fill in whatever details you both agree on. Come on, Hermione.”
“Not yet,” he whispered. “I’m okay. I’m not hurt. I’m happy. It’s good.” He tried to reassure his husband, but felt the wave of magic wash over him anyways as Harry scanned him. “It’s good,” he repeated.
Tonight it seemed to be the first option, and oh how the Dark Lord was pissed. When the curse was finally lifted, Severus lay panting on the ground. As quick as he could, he made it to his feet and bowed once more to his master. “Lucius!” Voldemort called next. The blonde man, although you couldn’t tell it by the mask and the hood, stepped forward and bowed. “How old is your son?”
“You want me to wear this for Draco for when the baby comes? It’s a good idea Potter…-Malfoy, but I cannot wear anything that interferes with brewing. Silver is a highly interactive substance.” The man scowled at the bracelet.
“Oh yes! It came to me just the other night. I was thinking of all the names I like, and how to arrange them in a way I’d like them, and I finally decided on McKay Draconis Malfoy.” All movement stopped. Nobody said a word or made a noise, except for the machine which beeped out the baby’s heart rate. “What? What’s wrong with that name? I thought it was a good idea to make Draco’s name the middle name.”
“It wasn’t too long after we returned, still hidden away mind you, that Lucius Malfoy and Severus Snape were to be killed by the Dark Lord for their failures to him.”
Harry turned his head to look at Blaise with a few tears in his eyes. “Thank-you,” he whispered. “Theresa? It’s… I feel… It’s weird. I can’t explain it. I feel like… It’s like I need… I don’t know!” he cried, giving up on trying to explain the feeling. “Like another craving!” he finally said. “It’s like I want something, and I see it, but I can’t get to it. What does that mean?”
“We didn’t,” Harry insisted, “but I got pregnant and had a baby. They’re not going to believe me! Even if I am Harry Potter, the evidence is overwhelming in the wrong direction. They won’t annul this marriage. We’ll have to get a divorce Blaise, I’m sorry. I know you don’t want to because it will shame your family, but I love Draco and you know this. I can’t stay in this marriage if Draco’s willing to marry me now that he knows the true story and has stopped being a stupid prat.”
Sit up slowly, and I’ll help you to Theresa’s room.” He helped Harry up and then helped him down the hall to Theresa’s. Every time there was a contraction, they stopped until Harry nodded to go on. Blaise knocked on Theresa’s door and called out to her. “Theresa?! Harry’s in labour! Time to wake up!” Theresa was there in a heartbeat. “He was complaining of McKay kicking him too hard so he came to see me. When I was trying to soothe his stomach, he suggested it may be contractions. We came to see you immediately.”
First, he gave Draco a light massage. His fingers worked out the stress from the shoulders and down the spine. Once he got to the hips, he slowly moved his hands around to massage Draco’s extended belly then back again. His thumbs carefully dug into Draco’s bum then, massaging the globes that hid his lover’s most precious place. He poured a little more lube on his right hand and circled one finger around Draco’s puckered entrance. Slowly, he pushed the single digit inside.
Severus nodded. “Yes. That might work just fine. I cannot think of a potion in which tungsten is an issue. High melting point, relatively attractive, not malleable or weak. Yes, this will do.” He clasped the bracelet to his left wrist.
Dimitri gasped, the shock coming from Draco’s openness as to his parents’ alliances. No one said such a thing out loud. It just wasn’t done. After a split second, he realized he should be writing and got back to it. Draco graciously allowed him a moment to catch up.
She walked into the Potion Master’s office without knocking and started to explain the situation in half sentences and jumbled up words. Severus, knowing it was better to just let her ramble than try to stop her, merely went back to grading the seventh years’ thesis for their midterm reports. So far, he hadn’t wanted to violently kill anyone. There were a few close calls, but nothing definite yet. Of course, he hadn’t gotten to the Gryffindor papers yet, so that may have been-
“He incinerated all five of them, then put one hand on my forehead and the other on one of the wounds on my back. And healed it. Then did the same thing for the other four. It had to of been sometime in the afternoon. Harry decided we should rest there for the night and find something to eat. He always found the food, always. And I let him after the first night there. I ate something that nearly killed me. Nothing he’s ever found has killed us, hurt us, or made us sick in any way. He was always within talking distance though, never left too far away. Otherwise he’d take me with him. I usually went with him anyways.
“What is wrong with him?” In an instant, Lucius was by his side. “Did Potter remove his Mark as well?”
“Really, it means a lot to him,” Theresa said with a smile. “The first time I was in their home in France, Blaise was frying some ham for one of Harry’s cravings. Well, he offered some to me and the three other doctors. They each took some, but remembering my sister-in-law’s cravings, I declined until Harry offered me some. Harry came in shortly thereafter and was very grateful for the ham. He learned that I was the only one not to take the ham and thanked me for it numerous times. And then, when we were alone for a private interview, he thanked me again. He didn’t know why he was so thankful, but he was. Just accept the thank-you and move on.”
“My apologies, Harry,” Dumbledore said genuinely. “We were unaware how much our conversation was hurting you and Draco. I believe we shall-”
“But the Dark Lord does not let his followers simply leave. Through their Dark Marks, he has linked each to him. He is able to summon them and punish them via these Marks. And thus he began to do with my father and Severus. Upon seeing this, Harry destroyed the link and the Dark Mark on them both.” Draco waved a hand at Severus, who lifted his sleeve to show the unblemished skin of his left forearm. “No longer are they minions, but free men.”
“Please, it’s not as if–” Draco was cut short by a new voice drifting through the partially open door to their bedroom.
“I was trying to plan a surprise, and it backfired a little bit. I was going to ask what was for dinner, say there was nothing here, and then suggest we go out. But I can see how much that hurt you, so I don't want to keep it from you any longer. I apologize; I didn't think it would affect you so much.” Draco walked forward and sat on the edge of the bed, giving Harry the items in his hands. “So, please come out with me?”
Not that Harry was complaining, but Draco’s sixth month of pregnancy brought about a new symptom: increased libido. He couldn’t get enough sex. If Harry left to go anywhere, he was jumped as soon as he returned. If they were in the living room, there was sex on the couch. If they were in bed, there was sex on the bed. Shower? No problem. Friends over? Who cared?
And just as there were deaths among the Dark Lord’s minions, there were deaths from the Order too. Tonks was, thankfully, the only person Harry actually knew on a personal level. Fred lost an ear; at least people could tell the twins apart after that. Several others had been hexed, cursed, or maimed in the attack. It would take time, but most everyone would recover to their full potential.
There was complete silence for a moment before Harry fell backwards on the bed, holding his sides as he curled up into a ball. The other three rushed to his side to see what was the matter. It turned out that he was laughing, but without noise it looked like he was in great pain. When he finally stopped laughing, Harry explained to Draco why it was so funny.
“Albus, I’m telling you, I can’t take it anymore!” he ranted to the Headmaster. “They’re at it like crups in heat. There is no place in my quarters that hasn’t been desecrated by Potter. The kitchenette, the sofa, the rug in front of the hearth, even the walls! I cannot return to my quarters without some kind of change, a guarantee I’ll not see this again. Maybe they can have their own set of rooms?”
Soon, Draco was huffing and pushing back against his husband. He needed more. He needed faster. He needed harder. And he knew Harry wouldn’t give it to him because he feared hurting the baby. Instead, he tried to take it himself. After two shoves back, Harry caught on to his plans, however, and halted his movements with his hands on Draco’s hips.
“Potter is training. Draco is recuperating from a nasty bite from his detention in the Forbidden Forest. You will be kept updated on everything that we find out. Now, I really must be going.” He turned to leave, but his arm was caught once more.
“I agree with Dr. Mitchsens. Top of the line for everything, and anything you desire for your husband. A male pregnancy is harder than a female one, I won’t lie. However, anything you think is needed I will do my best to get. If I can make it easier on either of you, I will. I’ve worked extensively with these kinds of cases and I believe that a hands-on approach is best when dealing with someone as emotional as your husband. I would tell you everything that related to this pregnancy, and then Harry if you advised it. Adding stress to a pregnancy is never a good thing to do.”
ready to tell everyone. I believe I’ll show Harry around the château in France, if that’s okay? And may I ask for a few weeks alone?” They both blushed, Harry a little more than Blaise. “It is our honeymoon after all.”
that actually made me think of this. So, if I’ve offended you by semi-stealing your story just let me know and I’ll take it down. Her fic was
“In case you don’t know, there’s no time to explain. We must speak with Draco right now. It is an emergency Mrs. Malfoy.”
As he gazed upon all of his followers, he made a mental tally of who was there and who was not. He could see beneath the masks, could tell who was who without seeing their faces or bodies. When he had finished his once over, he smiled and watched all of them tense in preparation for whatever horror was about to befall them. His gaze stopped on one Death Eater, finally, and he laughed to himself. “Luciusss,” he almost whispered, “come forth.”
“Classes end at half past four. I would think… six o’clock would be good? That gives me enough time to finish up things in the classroom, and then come back here to relax a bit before having to deal with Potter. And don’t give me that look. You may be protecting him, but it’s annoying to those of us trying to help him.”
“Anywhere, Harry. You name it, and I’ll find a way to get us there. All four of us, if Theresa wants to come.”
Between the arguments and the pregnancy hormones, Harry was ready to jump off the Astronomy Tower. Thankfully all the students had left for summer hols so he was able to storm from Severus’ rooms to get some air to breathe. He didn’t leave the castle. Usually, he went to the kitchens and got something sweet from the elves there to pacify Draco upon his return.
“Would you at least talk to me? I told you I would be here for you. I can’t help you if you won’t even talk to me. What happened? Is there something wrong with McKay? Did
Harry tore into the gift without so much as a thank-you. He held up a CD a few moments later. “What’s on it? It looks like a blank disk.” Harry looked at him in confusion.
“Weren’t you paying attention this morning? All the potions classes were cancelled. We’re to go to the library and continue our research projects.” Hermione took a bite of her sandwich and chased it with a swig of Pumpkin Juice. “That means he’s been called or they’re having a meeting with Professor Dumbledore. I say we wait about five or ten minutes, then burst into his office again. Otherwise, we’ll never get answers.”
“No, Mr. Volkanov, Severus is not a Death Eater. He has not been for many years now. He has been spying on the Dark Lord for our side, bringing us information whenever possible, withstanding torture both physical and mental for over fifteen years. When they were to be Avada’ed, Severus grabbed my father after he’d been Cruicio’ed and portkeyed them to safety to the Hogwarts infirmary. From then on, my parents were secluded here in Hogwarts Castle as well, for their safety. They had defected.
“And so do you,” Madam Pomfrey insisted, standing up now. She and Snape had been sitting during the tale. “You need to get some rest too. What ails you cannot heal without proper sleep. You’re safe here, now. I will watch over you.”
After nearly a month in the Hospital Wing, Draco and Harry were given permission to move around and not stay in their bed or beds all the time. Harry followed close behind or beside Draco wherever he went, casting spells or testing food anytime they came upon something not provided by Harry. While it irked Snape to no end, he had to admire the boy’s casting ability and spell knowledge. Draco was definitely in good hands. They were told to hurry to their room or cast an invisibility spell if and when someone else came into the ward however, as the rest of the school was not to know they were there.
“Harry and I would like to set the record straight. Harry’s magic didn’t change so that his wand merely needs to be touching his skin,” he clarified. “Harry doesn’t use a wand at all. And I lost my wand in the Forbidden Forest, so I use his wand instead.” He pulled Harry’s wand from the holster on his own arm to show them. Several people gasped, then gasped again when Harry conjured a fireball in his right hand without using his wand. “All of his magic is wandless and wordless. He’s told me he doesn’t even think the spell in his mind, just the outcome he desires.”
“A very diplomatic answer if I ever heard one,” Draco teased. “But thank you. I think I needed to hear that.”
Snape blanched, but put in the order via the Floo anyways. Within minutes, the tray appeared on the kitchen table. He floated the tray to Draco after taking his tea for himself. Then he sat back down in his chair.
Without answering, Harry ran a hand down Draco’s thigh to push his right leg forward. All sex was had on his side, as he couldn’t manage even being on his hands and knees anymore. And while it still bothered Harry, he couldn’t deny his lover what he begged for so prettily.
Harry didn’t move for a moment. Instead, he and Poppy stared into each other’s eyes. Poppy wanted to shudder and look away, his gaze was so intense. But she knew better. To break contact now would be admitting she was untrustworthy. She couldn’t afford that. Even if he couldn’t actually see her. Right now there were two incredibly injured young men before her, one was pregnant and the other was possibly mute and blind for the rest of his life. Finally, Harry began to rise from the floor where he’d been huddling. He seemed to carry Draco with no problems at all, as if he weighed no more than a feather, as he carried him to the bed and gently lay him down once more, as if he could see perfectly.
“Hey, I resent that one! You get plenty from me!” But Harry was still laughing. The song changed to a country song.
Poppy watched as he caressed Draco’s face, tucking a dirty lock of hair behind Draco’s ear. When she took a step forward, Harry started before relaxing minutely at seeing that it was only her.
Harry threw his free hand behind him to close, lock, silence, and ward the door; as if to say ‘Who cares?’ or ‘That’s exactly where I want to get to.’.  They took their time disrobing, using hands and mouths to map each other’s bodies once more, relearning every inch of their lover. Then Harry carefully picked Draco up and lowered him on their bed before lying beside him, careful to never put his full weight on his lover or child. Lots of touching, and lube, later and Harry was sliding home in one long stroke. He paused, giving Draco time and opportunity to move and get comfortable. After so many times together, it didn’t take long however.
trying to talk to him. “Go slowly, but make it quick. I don’t understand you and I have places to be,” he growled. He watched and tried to make sense of the signs. “Death Eater? Yes, okay. No… no bad? Not bad. Not a bad Death Eater? Yes, that’s right Po-
Harry merely gestured with his hand and the charms were set. Draco, meanwhile, never ceased talking and moaning. “I can feel it, Harry, can you? I’m so ready. I’m going to come on your tongue alone. You’re amazing. You’re perfect. No one else can do this to me, only you.”
For the second interview, they’d gone over their ‘adventure’ in the Forbidden Forest in great detail, leaving out the too-personal bits. Even the ‘boring’ bits about walking and sleeping in shifts and finding food was discussed in depth so the readers could really get a sense of understanding what it was like out there. Harry wrote it best:
“And that’s all for now,” Snape interrupted. “That is enough time for Mr. Potter-Malfoy to be sitting up like this. He needs his rest, after all.” Clearly, the interview was over. Snape began ushering the reporters to the door.
“I’ll fry some ham soon for you, but first I want you to meet four of the finest mediwitches and -wizard around. In order, they are Doctors Mitchsens, Johansen, Whittier, and Rhodes. They are here to apply to be your caretaker. I know these four will be as discrete as possible when it comes to your care. Would you like to say hello?”
“Theresa Rhodes, you say?” Dr. Morris asked. “Wow. It’s an honour to meet you, really. I studied all of your work extensively when I tried to get into the field myself. However, I didn’t pass the bar high enough. I wasn’t given the ability to be a labour and delivery specialist, just a regular check-up doctor or a helping hand should one be needed. Sorry. You were saying?”
“Coming right along, dearies. Coming right along.” Madam Pomfrey started waving her wand and taking readings from both Draco and the child, nodding and humming as the results were produced on a piece of floating parchment. “Very good, yes, yes, nicely sized, good readings, excellent levels. Well, all seems to be in order here. We are just waiting on you, ducky.” She patted Draco’s belly lightly.
The spells were unexpected and the Dark Lord, and Snape for that matter, wasn’t ready for them. So a scream was ripped from Voldemort’s mouth at the cutting spell. “Oh shut up Tom,” Harry muttered in a bored tone. “
“No, I mean like a rock hard. Feel for yourself.” He held one of Harry’s hands over where he’d been massaging and just waited for a moment. When McKay kicked, Harry hissed softly. “Harry? What was that?”
“Hello Mr. Potter, er Zabini. Excuse me. I wasn’t told about anything that would be happening with this appointment. Is this a check-up for one of you, or the child?” she asked.
He wiped his eyes hastily before reaching out to apologize for his moody outburst, to explain how his world had been turned upside down and inside out.
“I’m sorry Blaise, but Draco’s not here.” She didn’t get to say another word as Harry’s knees gave out under him and he began to wail most piteously. “What the, what is wrong with him?” she asked over his sobs.
“That doesss not matter to me! Why isss Malfoy absssent from Hogwartsss?! Luciusss! What isss the meaning of thisss?!”
“Calm yourself Draco. I believe, against my better judgement, this could be done. I will speak with Headmaster Dumbledore on the manner. I would suggest writing everything down.” He turned to leave the room, but paused in the doorway. “And Mr. Potter? Would you please try and curb Draco’s enthusiasm in this endeavour? It is impossible to put together the grand affair he wishes to have at this time.” In the blink of an eye, he was gone again.
“Well, I must say Mr. Potter that you clean up very well. With the exception of your black hair, I’d have to say you look exactly like your mother on her wedding day. Well, your hair and your robes. Hers was a white gown of course.”
Harry took pity on him, helping himself out of his clothing to appease his husband. Once naked, he crawled onto the bed and helped Draco into position on his haunches, facing the headboard. He reached into the bedside drawer for the lube kept there and poured some on his hands.
He cried out suddenly, as Harry bit down at the base of his neck along his shoulder line. It was just one of Harry’s ways of getting Draco’s attention. He must have been thinking too much. “Okay, okay,” he panted. “I’ll stop.” Harry just grinned then kissed his love, his
“So the nundu finally went off, but she’d already torn into Harry a bit. I tried to get down to him after she left, but the wards wouldn’t let me. He just lay there on the ground…” Draco trailed off, his eyes glazed over in memory and with unshed tears. He had been terrified that day. A hand on his thigh startled him from his thoughts. “Oh! Sorry. I guess I… got caught up in the memory. He was just laying there, bleeding and coughing, his eyes glazed over and fuzzy. He wasn’t moving after a while. I could see him breathing occasionally, but he wasn’t moving otherwise.
“That’s an excellent question, dear boy,” Albus responded, stroking his beard. “I’m glad to see you are both thinking about your futures. There are a few options available to you. You can start the next year with the current seventh years, though I understand your reluctance to do so,” he said, cutting off Draco’s complaint against that option. Eyes sparkling, he continued. “You can ask the Ministry to sit your NEWTs as you are now, but I sincerely advise against this option without having had any seventh year lessons. You can hire tutors then ask the Ministry to sit your NEWTs, the option I suggest what with the baby coming and all. You can simply not take the NEWTs, and try your chances without them. Sorry to say, Harry really needn’t worry much about them due to who he is. You, Draco, will not fare as well despite recent publicity turning public opinion in your favor.”
“I’m okay, Hawwy,” Draco said with the kerchief shoved up his nose. “Nothing hit my nose so I don’t see why it’s bleeding. I’m sure you didn’t hurt me in any way. Severus is just being overly cautious is all. Look, here’s the potion now.” He took it from Snape willingly and then drank it down quickly. After a moment, he couldn’t feel the blood anymore. “See now? I’m all better.” He cleaned the kerchief with Harry’s wand and handed it back to Snape. “And you know I’m fine, so stop glaring at Harry.”
That night, he heard Snape return after giving his start-of-the-year speech to his Slytherins. The man went to bed early, knowing he’d be up early with the newest batch of urchins to try and teach. Harry figured, with Draco already asleep, he may as well turn in as well. Despite a few wake-ups during the night, Draco and Harry slept soundly.
Harry was still holding Draco’s hand, but he used his other one to gently swipe on finger from his son’s head down to his feet. He counted ten toes, then maneuvered Corvus’ hand to wrap around the finger so he could count his fingers. With Draco’s other hand on the baby’s back, Corvus slowly morphed from shrieks to cries to whimpers to sniffles. He opened his dark blue eyes and looked right at Harry. With a head full of dark hair, he quickly signed to Draco that the poor boy was going to look like him and suffer his hair.
And mere moments later she retracted it again. She sat stunned, watching Harry as he gently stroked Draco’s face. As she tried to get her thoughts in order, certain facts kept jumping to the forefront of her mind. Harry was using strong wandless magic. Draco was pregnant. Harry was alive, but blind and mute. They had survived in the Forbidden Forest for more than five months. Again, Harry picked up Draco’s hand and just held it while the blonde seemingly continued to sleep. When she finally had the events in order of the way she thought they went, she stood and went out into the main room before going into Harry and Draco’s private room.
Ron jumped out of his seat and pulled her close, whispering harshly into her ear, “Calm down, that’s what.” He held her close and tried to comfort her. “Listen, they will find him. Harry isn’t hurt. Everything will be okay. We both know that if anyone could make it out of this situation alive, it would be Harry. He’s come out of worse things before. There’s no way he could face the Dark Lord seven times in his life and live, only to be brought down by something out in those woods. And if it’s Malfoy who’s hurt him, well you can take care of that, can’t you?”
Draco turned to see what Harry’s answer would be, but found his lover dead asleep on the bed he’d been pacing in front of. The pen and paper floating next to him paused in its writing of his thoughts. “Sleep well, Love. You need it.”
“Harry did it,” Draco said in a small voice. “He wants me to apologize to you, Professor McGonagall. He planted those words and thoughts in your head through legillimancy. It takes a lot of energy for him to do so, but he knew it was the only thing that could possibly save us from being seen.”
As Harry softened inside Draco, he eventually pulled out naturally. Harry helped Draco down onto his side on the bed for a post-coital snuggle. This was Harry’s favorite moment. Not that the other stuff wasn’t nice, but cuddling with Draco had always been the reward for the ‘other stuff’ for him. He really enjoyed feeling the baby move beneath his hands. He’d been so jealous the first time Draco had felt It move, but he couldn’t yet. Now, however, it was obvious when It moved. It stretched Draco’s skin and summersaulted around as much as it could in its confined space.
“Excuse me?!” Harry asked, jumping to his feet and swaying slightly. “I'll have you know that I happen to be the top more often than the bottom. Draco just happens to like my cock up his arse. And I just happen to like Draco on his knees. If you really want to know-”
At four months pregnant, he was beginning to truly show. That being said, he was more worried about harm to his child. If he were to hold on to Harry much longer, the additional dead weight could cause him to fall to the floor. He couldn’t risk that. But neither would be let go of his husband so that he could break something as he fell. That’s assuming nothing was wrong from what caused Harry to fall unconscious in the first place.
Narcissa would take time to heal. The physical injuries, those were healed within a day. But the psychological injuries from her brutal beating and rape would take far longer. She seemed to do so much better after Draco told her about the baby. Once she had something to focus on, she really came out of her shell. That’s when Harry learned about the
“Draco, Love, I like the gift. I really do. It makes me happy. Those are some of my favourites. I’m guessing Hermione told you that?” He smiled as Draco started to calm down some and nod. “And I bet she taught you the spell to play it on the player too?”
In a move that would have done any Seeker proud, Severus Snape twisted, turned, and manoeuvred so he had practically jumped on top of Lucius Malfoy and activated his emergency portkey to return to Hogwarts. “Incolumitas!” Before the final word could be spoken, Snape and Malfoy were jerked out of the Dark Lord’s stronghold and whisked to safety in the Hogwarts infirmary.
“Draco!” he called out, running after him. “Draco, wait! It’s not what you think!” But he was gone by the time he got outside. He sank down to his knees in the Entry Hall and started crying. A few moments later, Blaise kneeled before him and pried the box from his hands. He looked inside, sucked in a sharp breath, and then looked down at his friend. “H-he thought I w-was ch-cheating on h-him!” he bawled.
“I’m gonna show you just why Voldemort feared me if you don’t get out of my sight!” Harry threatened playfully.
!” he cried, praying to all the known gods that someone would hear him and help him. He couldn’t hold on much longer. “Somebody help! Please! Anybody?!”
Harry and Draco took to parenthood like dragons to the air. Corvus was such a sweet baby. Oh, his lungs worked plenty well. On the whole, however, he was calm and easy. Narcissa was jealous; Molly was proud. It was hard for Draco to put the boy down or hand him over to anyone else. He’d carried that child within him and felt the need to have him close by at all times. Even Harry wasn’t immune from these fits of need. The dirtiest of diapers, the rounds of spit up, the worst colic – it didn’t seem to faze Draco one bit.
“Albus I am going to ask you to shut your trap or leave my infirmary this instant,” Poppy instructed firmly, but quietly.
Both Dumbledore and Pomfrey whirled from their watch over the Malfoy patriarch to gaze at their unconscious potions’ master.
“Fine, fine. I do swear on my magic and status as a Wizard that whatsoever Severus Snape doth speak before me this night will be told to no one in any means possible. So mote it be.”
“Only if we’re not all killed first,” Snape growled under his breath. “He’s likely to kill us all if he wakes and…” he cleared his throat, “is not there beside him. I have a feeling I will be left the task of explaining?”
Misters Potter-Malfoy, I’d like to present your son.” Without wasting another second, Pomfrey lay the tiny, wailing, naked boy on Draco’s chest. Almost instantly, his heartbeat seemed to calm their son.
Dr. Morris was speechless for a moment. Then she shook her head before looking at them all again. “Let me get this straight. You love him,” she said, pointing to Harry then Draco. They nodded. “And had his baby?” Another nod. “But you married him,” she said, pointing to Blaise, “because he,” pointing to Draco, “left without knowing about him,” pointing to McKay. More nods. “Then you,” pointing to Blaise, “hired her,” pointing to Theresa, “and you,” still pointing to Theresa, “cared for him and him,” pointing to Harry and McKay. Nodding. “Now, you two want to separate?” she asked, motioning between Blaise and Harry. Nodding. “And you want to marry him?” She pointed at Harry, then Draco, only to receive another couple of nods. “And change his name?” She pointed at McKay.
“Not Harry, Ron! Malfoy! Malfoy’s not in the infirmary! Look!” She shoved the parchment under her boyfriend’s nose while he looked. She could see his eyes moving back and forth rapidly, searching for the name that was supposed to be there. “If Malfoy’s not there, then Harry wasn’t taken out of school for training. When was the last time we saw Harry?”
“Oh, please please please,” Draco chanted as he heard the cork on the vial of lube pop. “Yes, sweet Merlin, give it to me, please!”
Harry held Draco’s hand and brushed two fingers over his cheek before repeating the sign on Draco’s cheek.
“Blaise! Blaise, stop!” Harry said, laughing. “Calm down. I will answer you questions one at a time. Yes, I am sure. For two days now. I am two months along. I am fine. No, there isn’t anything you can do. I am perfectly capable of standing by myself. Madame Pomfrey  confirmed it two days ago. I need to tell Draco.”
“Uh, hello? Anyone going to tell us anything, or should we go get Madam Pomfrey?” Ron asked, then shrank down in his chair with the glare Draco shot at him. “Or, we could just sit here and be silent. That works too.”
“Harry,” Blaise soothed, pulling the distraught young man into his arms, “it will be okay. All you have to do is explain to him what’s going on. He’ll understand, I promise. Nothing is going to happen as long as you explain what happened. You must-”
Harry silently chuckled, imagining his father fainting as he was born so suddenly. He was kind of glad Draco was laboring more slowly. It was obviously painful for the other man, but Harry would get to savor the experience. A camera was shoved under his nose.
With gentle thrusts, Harry brought himself to completion within the blonde, tweaking Draco’s sensitive nipples at the same time. He wouldn’t be able to make Draco come again, but it would still feel good. And if the moans were anything to go by, it surely did.
“I led both of them to the birthing room I had set up early on and coxed them through everything from the temporary canal forming all the way through feeding McKay for the first time. I’ll spare the details, but suffice to say I am 100% positive it was Harry that gave birth that night. And I’m sure Blaise can attest to his hand being nearly broken from the pressure put on it.”
“We are well, Harry,” Draco said with a smile. “We have talked much. He is truly upset at the pain he has caused me throughout my life due to his being the Dark Lord’s lackey. I had him explain his place in his army, and he told me everything. We are careful not to let him leave the castle, as we are still unsure of my mother’s true intentions. I’d like to think she is the same as my father, but if that were true, surely she’d have come here seeking sanctuary as well?”
“Thank you, Mr. Za- father.” He’d been asked to refer to them as mother and father, if he was comfortable with it. It would take some time, but he’d manage. “I’m ready whenever you are Blaise, dear.” He wrapped his arms around Blaise’s waist, then touched the portkey to activate it. The hook behind his naval nearly had him cutting off Blaise’s air supply. When they landed in the front room in one of the Zabini residences, Harry let go and said one word: “Bathroom!”
“You know, you need to sleep. We’re back at Hogwarts now. Nothing can hurt us. And I know you’re a light sleeper so it’s not like they can sneak up on us and hurt us. You need to sleep. I know your body heals itself mostly and that you’re fine. I understand this. But I still worry about you, Harry. Please, just for an hour or two? You haven’t slept since before we got back here!”
Luna, on the other hand, married Rolf Scamander and took off on a worldwide tour to document creatures with the zoologist. Neville went on to university to master in herbology. Harry and Draco hired tutors to help them through the seventh year material, an expert in each class. Most were not Ministry-appointed. Severus himself tutored them in potions during his free periods and in the evenings. Dumbledore held a special lecture in the Great Hall shortly before Halloween, having asked Harry and Draco to speak to the school about why the Forbidden Forest was so forbidden. It seemed to have properly scared the students into obeying at least one rule.
“Would it have been that hard to take the potion? I know your magic is amazing and wonderful and just all around astounding. However, you need to rely on someone else for a change. I know this will be hard for you, but please? Do it for me? Allow them to take care of you, so you can take care of me.” He smiled softly and patted the bed beside him. “I think you should lay down and sleep for a bit. You’ve warded the doors, so I bet even Dumbledore himself couldn’t get in. Am I right?”
“Lucius!” Dumbledore urged, drawing the man’s attention to him. “I must ask you some questions now. Severus–”
A notepad and muggle pen was conjured and Harry began writing. Snape continue to sip his coffee until the pad was floated up to him to read. A quick scan caused Snape to raise an eyebrow in surprise. He read through it again more slowly. It was an interesting idea, a mostly well-thought-out plan. There was no way Harry came up with this by himself. It had to be Draco’s doing.
“Mostly, yes. He’d lost his glasses before the attack, but the nundu sealed the deal, so to speak. Moving on. We returned to Hogwarts, finally, on January 28th, going straight to Severus’ classroom. He is the Potions Master here at Hogwarts. The teachers had, of course, all been searching for us as best they could while letting no one know that we were lost. On February 24th, Harry and I were married in a private ceremony here at Hogwarts after we healed from our ordeal. I have two photographs here, one for each of you, that you may print, along with a copy of our vows. If you’d like, you may also take a picture of Harry’s vows, as they were said in our gesture-based language.”
being calm! This is ridiculous! Was this your doing, Malfoy?” She turned back to Draco. “Did you have a hand in keeping Harry from us for another month longer? He’s missed most of his last year at school, he’s missed Christmas, he’s missed so much! And it’s all your fault!”
Harry spent the first three hours testing every little thing Draco could possibly come in contact with while in the rooms, only leaving out Snape’s personal bedchambers. The look he gave Snape as he passed the door said what his vocal chords could not:
“It’ll be okay, ‘Mione,” Ron reassured. “We’ll go see Dumbledore and make sure things are okay. Come on. How about we go up now? That will put our fears at rest.” Hermione nodded and they both stood and left. Slowly, they made their way up to the Headmaster’s office, knowing he would be there. They were hoping Snape would be there as well, and maybe one or two others. They wanted answers, and they weren’t leaving without them.
They stayed that way for a while, just holding one another and basking in the love they felt for each other. They heard Snape return from his classes sometime later, but they didn’t leave their room. Harry eventually got Draco to start talking about the wedding again, and which people he would invite. He could just feel his lover’s excitement over the upcoming nuptials. They did talk about their first wedding, about colours and robes and vows. Draco was of the opinion that they needed to do it as soon as possible so Draco wouldn’t look too big with the pregnancy.
“I was asked, firstly. The stipulations Mr. Zabini has placed on the accepting doctor will meet my requests quite nicely. And a chance to help Harry Potter? No one in their right mind would pass that up.”
“What? Why?” Draco asked. “He’s already passed out. He doesn’t need either,” Draco said as his godfather went to a potions cabinet and retrieved two vials. “There’s no need to choke him! He’s already unconscious so he won’t-” He was cut off as Severus tilted his head back and forced the Calming Draught down his throat only to have it followed shortly after with the Dreamless Sleep. “Damn you… Sev…” Draco too went out like a light. Both he and Harry awoke the next morning.
Harry just laughed at the way his ‘mother-in-law’ was handling things. “Thank you so much Mrs. Zabini. You don’t know how much this means to me. I thought for sure you’d make Blaise and I part for this.”
“Are you really married to him?” the ex-Death Eater whispered. His gaze was on the sleeping Harry on the bed and not his son, but the question was obviously directed at the young blonde. “Did you cultivate such a relationship between the two of you that you married him? I can understand the child; survival takes precedence over all in times such as you have gone through, my son. But marriage?” He looked at his son to see the truth of his statements.
“You fiend!” Draco cried, playfully slapping Harry’s shoulder. “You know Severus is going to have an aneurism.”
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
“Did you not hear me, idiot boy? No one can know about this. Only the six I mentioned, of which you are one of.” Snape sighed and brought one hand up to cover his eyes. “Do you know what your father said to me when we left a Death Eater meeting after you’d been gone for a month? He begged me to keep you from becoming what you were to become, what he is. Do you understand just what it is that Lucius is to the Dark Lord?”
“It hurts, mum,” he whimpered. Harry felt his heart clench. “And they’re still so far apart. It takes hours!”
Harry just looked at Draco. “Harry lost his glasses right around Christmas. He took them off when he went to sleep, put them close by like always. But then it snowed. It snowed heavily. Because it was such a heavy snow, I woke him and we moved. Neither of us noticed he didn’t have his glasses until we’d found a new spot to rest at. We tried to find the spot the next day, but couldn’t. His magic was slowly starting to fix his eyes so he wouldn’t have to rely on me for everything.
He kept one eye on his little family and the other on the game. When the Frisbee came to him, he threw it to one of his teammates down the beach, Leonard might have been his name. However, he overshot his strength and it landed on a porch of one of the beach front properties that was there. Blaise apologized to the other guys and ran up to the house. A man was standing there, Frisbee in hand. “Sorry about that. I didn’t mean to throw so hard. It won’t- Draco?!” There in front of him stood the blond Slytherin himself. “Is this where you’ve been hiding? Holy hell, man. Harry and I searched for you all over the place.” He shot a look over his shoulder at Harry playing with McKay in the water. “What in the hell is wrong with you?!”
we didn't forget!” She was angry alright, but she was also enjoying the little prank they'd pulled on her friend.
But this didn’t seem to bother Draco at all. He may have been down for the count, but he was also nesting.
During the day, Draco and Dumbledore worked on creating name settings, bouquets, and other little decorations. Draco had chose all of the floral arrangements himself, made of five different plants. A fern leaf would be at the back of the bouquet to represent magic, an ivy limb down the side to represent marriage, three red poppies to represent pleasure, three red tulips to represent a declaration of love, and a sprig of white heather to represent protection. There were two bouquets on the table, and a smaller bouquet on the back of each chair. Or there would be, once night fell and they could start decorating the small portion of the Great Hall they’d be using.
“Yes, I believe I do. I shall ask Albus and Minerva what they think about telling Granger and Weasley. I have classes to prepare for. Do try and keep my rooms from becoming grounds for your arguments.” He turned and walked out of the room with a flare only he could handle.
The small kitchen, the loo, the living room, the office, their bedroom, the halls, the walls (stone by stone), the floors, the painting (as Snape only allowed one in his chambers, period), the fireplace (brick by brick), everything! He even added his own ward to the door to recognize his magical signature so he wouldn’t have to be with someone to enter by voice password.
“It hasn’t been real until now,” Harry said softly, still not looking up. “It was okay at first, that he missed his first sonogram and his first kicks and the first time he moved.” Harry looked up now, tears streaming down his face but a fire in his eyes Blaise hadn’t seen in a long time. “But he missed his own son’s birth! It wasn’t real until then! And all the congratulations from your family and friends, congratulating me and you, like you had anything to do with…” He trailed off, once more looking down. “It just hurts.”
He knew Harry was staring at him, because his gaze almost pierced through his shoulder. After several minutes of this, he was about to turn around and ask what the Gryffindor’s problem was when two arms wrapped around him and hauled him back into Harry’s arms. He’d squawked and carried on for a moment, sure. But Harry had kissed his cheek, just below his ear, and said goodnight, and cuddled up against him. It had been weird, sleeping that close to someone, but it had been so perfect! The heat in all the right places, the security, the inner warmth. And every night since they cuddled, whether there had been anything sexual between them or not.
“Draco!” he suddenly thought aloud. “I can go home to Draco and still celebrate just fine.” With a little hop in his step and smile on his face, he took off for the exit. Surely his lover and husband of five years would have something special planned? Dinner, flowers, chocolates, his favourite movie, his favourite position? Something? Anything? Surely...
“I know, baby,” Narcissa whispered. “You’ll be alright. I had a long labor too. But your birthing will be so much easier. You don’t have to actually do anything, you lucky sod.” She stroked his cheek and tucked a lock of hair behind his ear. “I want you to eat some of these ice chips, okay? Eat some for mummy.”
Everyone went silent then. Draco looked up at Harry worriedly. They’d not really wanted to discuss this topic and were careful to leave it out of their interviews with the Luna and Dimitri. It was something they’d discussed with both Snape and Dumbledore, so they luckily had an answer prepared for the masses.
Draco being so calm and collected was confusing to Harry. For the past two months he’d done nothing but gripe and complain, worrying himself into a stupor on occasion. Then, when the time finally comes, he’s as calm as the waters of the Black Lake. Draco wanted to sit in the rocker, so Harry helped him into it. But it didn’t last long; he said it was too uncomfortable. So they went back to bed.
“Is he okay in there? Does he need anything? Has he had meals? What about McKay? Does he see Theresa?”
Draco had tears in his eyes as Harry brushed his fingers over his own cheek before brushing them over Draco’s. “Let me think on it a little more? I’ll answer before we go to sleep tonight. That way there’s still time to tell Severus and Dumbledore whether or not to send for Weasley and Granger. ‘Kay? Are we agreed on that?” Harry nodded. They hugged, then kissed, and then Harry ran a hand down Draco’s back to cup his arse. “And that will get you only one place, Mr. Potter.”
, he began his plotting to attack Hogwarts. He failed spectacularly and fell to Harry’s silent spell. When Draco later asked what spell he’d used, Harry explained that he merely imagined Voldemort gone. Well and truly gone. No trace left to resurrect, no pieces left for nefarious rituals or potions, no soul piece to inhabit another body. Harry had blinked him out of existence. It took all of Harry’s energy and he ended up in a coma for three days after the battle. Muggle science had it correct – mass exists and cannot truly be gotten rid of. Instead, it must turn into something else. Even conjuring was bringing mass together in a different form.
“I am in the middle of a lecture. This had better be-” Severus stopped mid-sentence when he saw just who was interrupting his classroom. There, standing in the doorway as if nothing had happened, was Draco Malfoy. And just behind him a step or two was Harry Potter. “Wha-? Where-?”
Draco was panting after the contraction, sucking on an ice chip. Harry was wide-eyed as looked back and forth between his husband and the mediwitch. In a few short moments, he would become a father. In a matter of literal minutes, he’d be holding a child in his arms. He looked at Draco in wonderment and love, so grateful to this man for carrying their child and loving him and going through everything they’d gone through together…
“Yes, Miss Theresa, ma’am.” She blinked out of the room. Theresa turned away from Harry for a moment and conjured a sturdy table and then a smaller table to place McKay once she could hold him. When Kipper came back, she simply gestured toward the table. “Here is the water, Miss Theresa. And the towels too, Miss Theresa.”
Harry gestured; Draco translated. “He doesn’t have any diseases. His body heals him naturally, professor. Has ever since he started focusing his magic so I could use his wand. And then once we found out I was pregnant, he’s been concentrating even more to me. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with him.”
“Because my father was an arse and I wanted to make sure I lived through any meals I know he ‘oversaw’ or ‘checked’ before eating them,” Draco answered with malice in his voice. “Screw him. What are we going to do now? I won’t let you stay married to Blaise, no offense my friend, or McKay to remain a Zabini.”
“Oh, just happen to be on the same beach as Harry are you? Let go of me and get off my property before I call the police Zabini.” He shoved Blaise back and straightened his clothes before walking inside his home.
Whatever Draco did, he was determined to be the best at it. And if that were true, he was certainly an ace nester. He’d calculated the perfect room size for a baby for maximum mental and physical health with Arithmancy and Numerology. Then he’d directed the elves into shaping the room just right to fit a growing child – no harsh corners, but also a room that had depth and distinction.
“He’s upset and unbalanced. Pregnancy is hard, but so is the time right after you have the baby. The hormones and chemical unbalances are still there. And Harry is hurting even more because he’s a single parent who’s married to someone he isn’t romantically involved with. Draco’s missed everything when it comes to his child, and it was only because he didn’t stop to listen to the explanation. I’m not saying that this is a good thing for Harry, because it’s certainly not healthy to keep a baby from interacting with other people. I’m glad he comes out at least once a week. But he doesn’t say anything. Try talking to him.”
“Yes Draco,” Snape sighed. “As much as I detest Mr. Potter, and I know the feeling is mutual, I will try to get along for your sake. I knew he would inspect my rooms when I offered to let both of you stay. I thank you for staying out of my personal bedroom, Potter. I will try to return the same courtesy.” Harry nodded, then turned his eyes back to Draco, watching him like a hawk. “Now then, I realize that Mr. Potter has your prenatal care all taken care of, but for the rest of us who don’t know what he knows I’d like to do a weekly check-up. Does that suit both of you? I would suggest Tuesday afternoons, as they are my lightest days when it comes to schooling.”
“I was asked because of my expertise to oversee a male pregnancy, but that I’d have to be picked from a small group of candidates.”
, without touching or seeing or ‘hearing’ Harry. He had wanted to say ‘screw tradition, where is he?!’, but didn’t for the sake of tradition. If their child had to go through that day of torture, Draco would insist they didn’t have to if they didn’t want to. It was torture, sheer torture. And all for the sake of tradition?
Snape was silent for a moment, thinking. “If you can tell me all the ingredients in this potion,” he pulled out a new vial, this one with a green potion in it, “with only your sense of smell, I will tell Poppy that you don’t need the enhancing potion.”
Even with their story out to the public, they weren’t to leave the castle. Draco, especially, was in now condition to go traipsing about Hogsmeade or Diagon Alley for baby furniture or supplies. First, Narcissa Malfoy had her personal house elf gather Draco’s baby things and bring them to the couple for perusal. After that, Molly Weasley said she could dig some things up too, and asked if she could knit a few things for the baby. Harry smiled at the ‘few’, knowing better. Draco thanked her and welcomed all gifts.
Harry was quick to reply, doing as asked and shimmying up his husband’s body. After a long, languid kiss, Draco pulled back and panted for breath. “Is there a reason you decided to wake me with that particular method?” He watched as the light in Harry’s eyes dimmed for a moment. “Oh stop. Do you really think I’d forget our anniversary?”
“Are you talking about me?” came a timid whisper. Blaise and Theresa turned to look at Harry who was standing in the entranceway to the kitchen from the dining room. “You are, aren’t you? It’s okay. I deserve to be talked about. I’ve been right awful lately, and I don’t know why I do it. I’m sorry Blaise, Theresa. I just… I don’t know. I’m sorry.” He stood there, head down with his hands clasped together under his slight bump of a stomach.
September second was another boring day. Severus was in classes all day. Harry was by Draco’s side. Draco was refusing to eat, again. Not even the ice chips could tempt him. Instead, he asked to get up and walk around. It was an uncommon request, but Harry helped his husband up and they made a few laps around the rooms. They ended up in the nursery, which wasn’t surprising. Anytime Harry would let him, Draco wanted to sit in the rocking chair Molly had gifted them. It was a comfortable chair.
Harry roared via legillimancy at Draco. Harry so rarely used the mind reading ability that it startled Draco into stillness.
Before he could slam the door closed again, Blaise stuck his foot in the doorjamb and hit hand on the door to keep it open. “Damn it Harry! I know you’re going through a lot of shit right now, but you need to think for just a moment! I am here for you, and although I’m not him I am doing my best. I’m sorry that the one thing you need I can’t get you, but I am trying my best to get you anything and everything else that could help! Now, my mother is downstairs wanting some answers. And I think she could help as well.”
As if on fast forward, his time in the Forbidden Forest ran through his head. The changes in Draco were so gradual at the time, but so obvious now. Draco was not the only one changed by the ordeal. Harry had undergone many changes himself, mostly due to his loss of vision and speech. Giving Draco his wand should have further hindered him, but it only made him stronger. That was another matter. His wand working for Draco so easily.
The voice broke his thoughts and concentration. Draco was standing in the doorway with a concerned look on his face, one hand on his belly. At five months, there was no hiding the baby bump without some serious work. The blonde was always slight and pretty. There wasn’t much else to describe the boy. He was eating properly and taking the nutrition potions, but it didn’t change his genes. He came from a line of thin men and women. The baby showed more prominently on him than it would most other men.
When they were done with her, they dropped her at the gates in front of Hogwarts with a note that read,
“I think it’s a marvellous idea! I suppose this is because of the upcoming child?” The twinkle was at full sparkle in the old man’s eyes.
“Right there,” Blaise said, pointing as Harry ran toward it. Immediately the sounds of retching were heard. Blaise set the bags down and followed his fri-
“I’ll make plans tomorrow. Until then, would you like to walk with Theresa and I in the gardens? It’s not too cold or hot out yet; just a little slippery. We’ll stay close to the house, and only be out for a few minutes.” Harry nodded with a smile and followed Blaise outside. Theresa trailed along behind with a smile on her face.
He looked over at his husband. There was a deeper connection between them, forged and tried through such adversity as most people could not even dream of. There was a true bond between them, one no marriage ceremony could put a name to or a divorce proclamation could rip asunder. Theirs was truly–
“Thanks, Weasley. You're a big help,” Draco hissed sarcastically. He hung up the phone, another object Harry had insisted on having, and looked at the stairs that would lead to his bedroom. He had to find a way to cheer Harry up quite a bit. Thinking quickly, he made a floo call to Harry's favourite restaurant for a quick reservation. Then he conjured Everlasting Flowers, Harry's favourite drink, and his favourite chocolates. Girly, but it worked for Harry. He quietly made his way upstairs again and stood in the doorway. “Harry? Harry, I know what you're thinking, and it's not true. I know today's your birthday.”
Only Dumbledore was there at the time, configuring two squishy chairs and a comfy couch on either side of a roaring fire. Despite it being summer, Draco got cold easily. Harry helped his husband onto the couch in the spot nearest the fire. Draco may get cold, but Harry was plenty warm. Severus had decided to stand behind and slightly to the left of Harry during the interview.
“I’m afraid, my Lord, I have none to give,” he finally got out. “My son is not at home, and if he is not at Hogwarts then I am unaware of where he is.”
“Okay,” Draco agreed. He looked down at Harry. “It’s no problem Harry, just a sign of how much I love you.”
Harry bent one knee, allowing Draco to find satisfaction against his thigh for a moment. The blonde moaned loudly at the feeling against his prick. The jeans Harry wore were perfect in their scratchiness, his muscles perfect in their hardness. Especially when they flexed with every movement Harry made. Aware of Draco’s inability to stand for long periods, he led them to the bed slowly so they wouldn’t have to break their kiss, which had become very needy.
“He’s… making a slashing motion across his neck and drawing circles on his left forearm. Now it looks like he’s raking his fingers across his face. He’s holding his right hand over his heart. He’s taking his first two fingers on his right hand and moving them over his right cheek. That’s it. What’s it mean?”
“Yeah,” Blaise agreed. “In fact, you asked me that other time, just after we were married as well. When you were still extremely upset over Draco and the wedding. Holy shite! I’m glad we’re getting this cleared up here and now. To have anyone else ask if we’d slept together and us answer yes would have meant an immediate no on the application for annulment.”
“It’s just so… weird. I mean, I was wallowing in my own misery this morning and now I have a son!” Draco said, still shocked by everything. “I insist that you all stay here for dinner tonight, my treat. I’ll cook you whatever you want.”
Molly continued snapping pictures, then handed the camera off to Narcissa and went home to tell everyone the news.
She turned her back to them, doing some shuffling and clinking before turning back around with a vial in her hands, swirling it as one would a good glass of wine. “When it turns sky blue I will need some of Draco’s hair and some of Blaise’s hair to determine the paternity.”
Draco stiffened immediately, sobered even faster. As fast as he could, he turned and made his way to the infirmary. There was no sight of any students in the halls, no Madam Pomfrey in the infirmary, no Snape anywhere. “Where are they?!” Draco whispered frantically. His eyes darted back and forth, searching for someone, anyone. But they searched in vain. Until Harry started walking forward, away from Draco. He moved to a wall, reached his hand out toward it. “What are you doing? We’re supposed to be looking for my father!”
“Night, Severus.” As Harry led him back to their room, he kept his hands on him at all times. “I’m sorry I scared you, love,” Draco apologized. “It wasn’t my intention. I just needed to use the loo. I’ll leave a magical trail next time, like I did in the Forest. How’s that?” His response was a nod, but Harry still wouldn’t let him go. Draco sighed. “Come here, Harry.” They crawled into bed together and Draco held him close, allowing Harry to see for himself with his hands and lips that Draco was perfectly alright. Once he reached that spot below Draco’s ear, it was all over.
There was really nothing left to do but wait, and neither Harry nor Draco were any good at that. Bedrest was a chore. Sleeping was a chore. Being awake was a chore. Having to pee all the time was a chore. Eating was a chore. Breathing was a chore. Draco whined constantly. His chest was heavy and sore despite the lack of mammary glands that usually accompanied the feeling. He was having hot flashes and cold sweats. When he was hungry, he couldn’t determine what he wanted. Usually he was just craving something to chew on to stay busy. Harry had taken to conjuring ice chips.
“I knew it!” Blaise whispered. “I knew you’d been acting funny! Are you sure? For how long? How far along are you? Are you okay? Is there anything I can do? Should you be standing up? Do you-?”
then entirety of Wizarding Britain to turn against your husband? He’s going to have a hard enough time when they find out he’s blind and mute. He deserves better, and your child deserves better. And, frankly, of the three Houses, Potter would have the first heir. You would have the second, and Black the third. Should you decide to provide an heir for all three. There are ways to bestow all three Houses on the one child, if you want that instead.” Snape paused there to drink his lavender tea and give Draco some time to vent.
“That’s what Dr. Rhodes said,” Harry continued with a smile. “I like her. She’s sassy, but she gets down to business. And to hell what anyone else thinks. She wants to help me because it is her job to help me. Dr. Whittier is almost the same as Mitchsens, just not as pompous. She believes that her care would be the best and that you would like her simply because of her credentials. Everything was about you, though. I was your husband, and her care would greatly be appreciated by you. Dr. Rhodes said that it was I and not you that was pregnant so who cares about you?”
“So, a simple salad. Vegetable medley soup. Maybe a shrimp kabob or a vegetable appetizer. Fish and potatoes for the main course. Dessert of… Oh! Chocolate mousse! I want some mousse, Harry. And chocolate silk pie. Oh, that will be divine! And afters of port and firewhiskey. What do you think? Not too much? I think it’s perfect.
Blaise and Harry took the antidote to the Veratiserum and breathed a sigh of relief. Dr. Morris took the quill and notepad out of the air, effectively ending both spells on the items. “That was one of the weirdest things I’ve ever done,” Harry said with a slight laugh. “I thought Draco was going to fly off the handle and hurt someone when I said I had slept with Blaise.”
Silence followed the explanation until Snape broke it. “Are you okay Draco? You’ve had your hand over your abdomen ever since we could see you again. And Potter, why are you smiling?”
“Of course, Master Draco, sir! Just bes waiting one moment. I’s be moving yous.” The little elf raised her hands and muttered under her breath. Using her elf magic, she levitated Draco from the bath, magicked him dry, and wrapped a warm towel around him. Running over to another chair, she grabbed the robe there and helped Draco into it. “Yous be getting ready for yous’s wedding to Master Harry, Master Draco, sir?”
Snape grumbled then left for his office. He could grade the Hufflepuff/Gryffindor third year essays before dinner if he started right now…
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
Madam Pomfrey handed Dumbledore an ornate chalice filled with water. Although it was custom for it to be filled with wine, they used water in difference to Draco’s pregnant state. He turned to Harry. “May you drink your fill from the cup of love.” Harry holds chalice for Draco while he sips, then Draco takes chalice and holds it for Harry while he sips. The chalice is then handed back to Dumbledore who sets it on the table. Next Dumbledore takes the plate of bread, giving it to Harry. The same procedure is repeated with the bread, Harry feeding Draco and Draco feeding Harry. Once the bread was set aside, Dumbledore turned to them both. “Severus told me you wished to say your own vows?”
Blaise laughed lightly. “Calm down mother. It’s a boy, and Harry’s decided to name it McKay Draconis Zabini.”
September first came. Harry was nostalgic over all the students returning, seeing the first years line up to be Sorted, and returning to their common rooms for the year. It was the first time he’d not seen his friends and gone to the Gryffindor common room. Tomorrow, classes would begin. Another school year. Things didn’t stop just because Harry’s life had changed, even though it had changed tremendously. As Snape liked to remind him, the world did
But Voldemort was smarter now, and knew what Harry was up to. He resisted. As he resisted, he caused more pain in Snape. Then he started attacking Harry, using the magic link to Snape and the mind link to himself to harm the young Gryffindor.
It was by that time Draco’s contractions were coming fast enough, roughly every eight minutes, that Harry activated the bracelets. Pomfrey came through immediately, checking on Draco and suggesting they move to the private room in the Hospital Wing she’d set up for them. Harry and Molly went through first, then Draco, followed by Narcissa, and the mediwitch. Draco shuffled between Harry and Madam Pomfrey to the back room, stopping once for a contraction.
“As for our robes, I think simple would be best. Our eye colour! Perfect! You look best in green anyways, you Slytherin in disguise. And I’ll wear silver, but not that shimmery, shiny stuff. No, that won’t due at all. Silver hemmed in black. You as well, hemmed in black. I think barefooted. Would you mind being barefooted, Harry? It’s an old tradition, one that’s rarely used anymore. But I’d like to use it. And we’ll join names at the alter, Malfoy and Potter, to become Potter-Malfoy. We agreed on that, right? You don’t want it to be Malfoy-Potter? Harry? Harry, are you listening?”
The whole time, Draco was shuddering and moaning. He kept his eyes closed and enjoyed the sensations.
“Just a few more steps Harry,” Theresa coaxed. “There’s the door, right there. Okay, in we go. On the table, just like for a check-up.” She and Blaise helped Harry lay down on the table. “Do you want Blaise here?”
Harry made a motion like he was brushing his hair back then laid his hand over his heart. Finally, he shook his head firmly ‘no’.
“Evening, Love,” he greeted, bussing Harry on the cheek as he walked by. He toed his shoes off and made his way to the kitchen. “What's for dinner?” he called out, his head buried in the fridge and his bum in the air.
“Yes, my infirmary!” Poppy yelled back. “These two young men have been through hell and back and I cannot treat them unless you leave because you have scared Mr. Potter so badly he will not let anyone near him, and Mr. Malfoy is unconscious! If I am to save their lives I will need absolute silence and no interruptions from anyone. Including you! Now get out Headmaster!” she said, brandishing her wand at him.
“Really Albus, you need to make your passwords something the children can’t guess on a whim,” a voice chastised. The students looked up to see the five adults in the room: Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Snape, and Aurors Shaklebolt and Moody. Minerva continued, “It’s not right that they can just burst in whenever they feel. Not only is it disrespecting your privacy, but what if we had been in the middle of something important? As we were?”
“He doesn’t need to hold it anymore,” Draco answered. “So long as it’s touching his skin somewhere, he has access to it’s use. Right now, it’s up his sleeve. It really came in handy while we were in the Forbidden Forest.”
“Hey Ron,” the boy said. “My name’s Terry Boot. I’m Head Boy.” Ron knew who he was. As he had said, he was the Head Boy. “Listen, I heard Hermione crying last night and I was just wondering if she was okay. I mean, I know it’s been a little rough for her lately. I’m sure it’s been hard for you too.”
“Well, it would be a huge affair you realize. Potter and Malfoy? Since your blood family can’t be there, or you don’t want those few others there, the Weasleys would all be in attendance. They could bring their spouses or dates. Depending on the status of my family, they would be there. My father would stand with Arthur Weasley, much as he would hate it. I can’t help but think that if he would ask Severus to keep me from the Dark Lord then he wouldn’t mind standing near the Weasley patriarch long enough to see his son wed.
“Because he was pregnant and in a right tight spot. Draco had disappeared because he found Harry and I involved in a strictly friendly hug. He got jealous and took off. I couldn’t let my friend go through a pregnancy all alone. It would be his first, and the media would be all over him. He was Harry Potter! The media knew everything about him. So I married him to keep his name clean, and to give his child a name.”
Severus caved and allowed her to take the memory to view in her own pensieve once he’d abstracted it. She was gone in a flurry of robes without any word of thanks or leave-taking. She rushed back down to the infirmary, did a check on Harry and Draco, found that nothing had changed, and then went to her office to view the memory. With some excitement and a little trepidation, she thrust her head into the silvery substance.
Harry indulged his husband while still getting his own bonding time with his son. He convinced Draco to hand the boy over to Molly and Narcissa, even Severus once. Hermione and Ron visited as often as they could. They’d decided to break up, but stay amicable. Draco said he wasn’t surprised. Hermione entered the Ministry, starting in a low position and working her way up through the ranks. She was determined to work on creature reform, Azkaban overhaul, and future legislation in general. Harry was sure she’d be great at it. Ron took some time off to figure out what he wanted to do. He was considering furthering his education, but didn’t know in what field. He decided to intern with his brothers for a couple of months each to see if there was a possible future in dragon care, cursebreaking, the Ministry, or entrepreneurship.
Harry turned back to Severus and started signing to him. “I don't understand, Potter!” Snape sneered, turning back to Lucius to help the mediwizards fix the man. “You need to realize that we weren't there through the months with you like Draco was. We don't understand your language. I am glad that you and Draco found a way to communicate, but that is not something that can be transferred to everyone else. We don't understand, and we don't have the time it takes to interpret what you're trying to say.”
“Draco?” he called out as he entered their small house. Well, small to Draco, pretty large to him. “Draco, I'm home!” There was no answer. “That's odd...” He took out his wand and searched for Draco magically, only to find that his lover wasn't home. Harry stood still for a moment, trying to remember if he was supposed to meet Draco somewhere or if he'd mentioned going out today. Draco was always there when Harry went home so it was weird and unusual for the house to be as quiet as it was.
And then the Quill stopped. Harry looked back at Draco, rubbing his right thumb over the back of Draco’s left hand.
articles so no one expected him to talk. However, it did have the side effect that many people ignored him and some talked about him like he wasn’t there. He let it go; he was focused on Draco and making sure nothing overwhelmed the pregnant man.
“Alright, dears, just as we discussed. Once Draco’s contractions are about five minutes apart, we will begin the process. I know Harry has described a similar method of birthing in the muggle world where an incision is made in the abdomen to remove the child, but we’ll be doing something similar to Apparation to remove this child. No pushing, no cutting, no mess to clean up. Well, that’s not entirely true. The baby will be messy still!” She laughed at her own joke and went about preparing cloths and accoutrements.
What do you think of Lucius? Do you hate my version of him in this story? Does he make sense? What are your thoughts, please?
“Actually,” Hermione cut in, “there were several theories on whether their hatred was purely negative. Most of us girls were wondering. It’s actually a common occurrence to see who we think should pair up with whom.”
When all five arrived in the potions’ master’s rooms, they quickly made their way to Harry’s and Draco’s private rooms within, led by Draco’s sobbing voice.
“Now that’s not fair. You know he’s just worried about me and wants to make sure I’m okay. He doesn’t understand how close we are now. Five months can do a lot to a person. He’ll understand that eventually. He’s my godfather, Harry! You know as well as I do that if Sirius was alive he’d be doing the same thing. I know you two have a history-”
Draco couldn’t wait to get back to the dungeons. A whole day, more than twenty-four hours, without being near and around and touching Harry was almost his undoing. If the next ten minutes didn’t include him, Harry, and a bed, he’d scream! Luckily enough, it did. When they reached the entrance to Snape’s private rooms, Harry touched the door and then swept Draco off his feet to carry him over the threshold… and straight to their bedroom. He didn’t even bother with romantics as he kicked the door shut and put up several warding and silencing charms. He banished Draco’s and his clothes to the other side of the room, stopping only at Draco’s protest.
“Can we not discuss my best mate’s... sex habits while I’m here? Please?” Ron asked, looking slightly green.
Draco had found Harry sulking around outside near the lake one day and went to tease him. When he didn’t get a rise out the Gryffindor, he moved on to more hurtful things: his parents, his friends, his godfather. That last one got Harry to ball his fists and turn to face the Slytherin. Harry began to say things back to Draco, and soon Draco had had enough. He pulled his fist back and punched Harry square in the face. Harry’s head jerked back, but he didn’t do anything in retaliation. As a stream of blood ran from his nose, he looked Draco in the eyes and silently asked him to do it again. That look caused Draco to rear back in shock.
“Yes, my Lord. Of course!” She practically ran forward in her haste to prove herself loyal and useful to her master.
“No, it means he’s wanting to push but doesn’t know it. Give it just a few more minutes Harry. You’re not fully dilated. And if you’re not fully dilated, this is going to hurt like hell. Think of it as not having any preparation before having sex.” Harry and Blaise both winced. “Yeah, compare it to that. I have no clue what that feels like, but your facial expressions sum it up pretty well. I’m going to check again. Hold on.”
Terrified she was going to hug him, Snape sneered, grabbed each teen by a shoulder, and marched them out of the kitchen.
Harry lazily waved his arm over them and then toward the door as Draco pulled the covers up. It only took seconds for those outside to realize the door was once more unlocked. Pomfrey made it in first. “You two ought to be ashamed! Locking us out like that. What if something had happened? If Draco had gone into distress or Harry had passed out? We couldn’t have gotten in in that case! And Mr. Potter, that is highly inappropriate considering you and Mr. Malfoy need to rest after all you’ve been through. If you’re tired, there is another bed just here for you to rest upon.”
“May we have the Map back, please sir?” Ron asked hopefully. Dumbledore smiled and handed it back to him.
Harry quickly deflated and turned to Draco, holding him close. He threw a dirty look to the man in the room over his shoulder. Madam Pomfrey began to talk to Snape in quiet tones. “I’ve told you before, Severus, that you have to be quiet and slow around Harry. He’s very skittish and very protective of Draco. If you cannot keep your temper in check, I will ask you to leave. And not allow you to return.”
Harry smirked at Snape and casually walked away to do just as Draco had suggested. Then, they christened the bed. Without silencing charms. And with lots of noise from Draco to make up for Harry’s lack of noise. Snape wanted to die.
Harry kept laughing, almost falling out of his chair at the song. He recognized them all, but Draco had changed the words to fit their relationship and past histories. The song changed again, this time to a slower pop song.
Harry’s face morphed into a sneer while Draco chastised his godfather. “Really now Severus, that was uncalled for. I think six is a good time. Dinner starts at seven in the Great Hall, so that gives us plenty of time to do the check-up and get upstairs. I presume Madam Pomfrey will be here as well?”
Harry shrugged his shoulders with his hands palm up beside him in the air. He pointed at Snape, pointed at himself, then intertwined his fingers together.
“I was telling Blaise the good news of my pregnancy when Draco came in and misinterpreted our hugging. He was going to propose to me.” Harry paused to gather his wits about him. “We can’t find him now. All we know is that he is at one of the Malfoy properties and doesn’t wish to be found. So, to save me from embarrassment and ridicule, Blaise offered to marry me and take the child as his own as long as I told my son about Draco all the time. We were married yesterday and came here for our ‘honeymoon’. Blaise sleeps just down the hall and respects my privacy. We became friends because of my dating Draco.”
. If all of you would just leave,” he made a sweeping motion with his arms, “I will take Harry and my dirty mouth to our bedroom where I can put both to good use.”
say a word. They’ve been gone for a month now. They were given a detention with Hagrid in the Forbidden Forest after fighting in his class so bad they ended up setting loose all the hippogriffs Hagrid had managed to capture for the lesson. That was after they pissed them off, I might add. They got separated, the boys from Hagrid and his mutt. And they were never found.”
Not there. Where was Harry? Oh yes. He’d run from the infirmary after his father had told him to unlearn everything he’d ever learned about being a Malfoy. Harry must still be there.
Harry cut Draco off with a kiss, holding his husband in place until he relaxed and melted into the embrace. Then he pulled back and smirked.
Harry moved forward and pulled her into his arms as much as her large belly would allow. “Thank-you, 'Mione. You know I love you.”
After a few quiet moments of flipping through the book and snickering, Draco closed the book. “I like the names we chose. I’m actually really glad you didn’t insist on name It after your parents. I’m also really happy you’re honoring the Black family tradition of using constellations for names. I think Cassiopeia Alexia and Corvus Armand are lovely names to add to the Black family tapestry. I think they’ll make all our family names proud.”
Narcissa gave a polite laugh. “He’s right, Harry. Draco was born with a light smattering of dark hair. By the end of June, it had lightened to a blonde color. Over the next couple of months, it turned white blonde. Think nothing of the baby’s coloring right this moment. Corvus Armand, you say? Lovely name. I thank you for honoring the Black House with your choice.” She bowed her head to the young man.
“Yes,” Draco answered, still not taking his eyes off of Harry. “I just wanted to tell you what you mean to me, what everything you’ve ever done for me means to me. We were not friends, Harry, but we became so much more. Through some of the worst trials life could throw at us, we overcame our mutual hatred and found the purest emotion for one another: love. And now we’re to be joined for all eternity, and have a child together. I love you Harry, and I just wanted to tell you that.”
“When the nundu attacked, she did something to his magic, altered it. It stopped fixing his eyes and started deteriorating them. He could no longer see in the typical sense of the word. Instead, his magic started feeling things out around him. He could see almost normally after about two weeks. I figure it works kind of sonar, like for bats or dolphins. He can send out pulses or just steady streams of magic to look for something. Normally it’s just the steady streams. What woke you the other morning was a pulse signalled for me and me alone. Understand?”
With a shrug, Harry held up a hand and pushed his magic out through the crowd. Signing to Draco, he named several people in the crowd while Draco translated.
“Okay then,” Dr. Morris said quickly. “I will get these copied so you can have a copy to take to the Ministry with you to get the annulment. You do realize that this isn’t over yet? You might be put through that again.”
“Are you serious? You’d cut your hair again and again to get us back?” Harry asked. Draco nodded. Quickly, but carefully, Harry handed McKay to Blaise and threw himself at Draco. “Thank-you,” he whispered into his neck. “That means so much to me, that you would give up something so precious for me. Thank-you Draco.”
he corrected again, blocked his way this time. “I don’t know what you want, but I do know that I want you to move.”
“Me, you… Join together? No. Together. Work together? You want us to work together?” He huffed a snort. “And why would I do that? We seem to be just fine circling around one another with Draco as our center. I have no need to work with you on anything other than being rid of the Dark Lord. And my role in that has been greatly reduced.”
“Thank you, Terry,” Hermione interrupted, placing a hand on Ron’s forearm to stop him from completing that sentence. “The gesture is appreciated.”
Snape stared him down. He looked so calm and in control, but Harry could see the signs of the toll the pain was taking on him. The trickle of sweat at his temple; the twitch in his left eye; the muscles spasming in his arm. If he didn't act soon, the damage might be irreversible.
!” A complicated wand movement, and magically there was a baby in Pomfrey’s arms. She continued to wave her wand about, muttering different charms over both Draco and the baby. “
“Yes sir,” they responded. “Um sir?” Ron asked. “I don’t know if it will help, but maybe the Map can help. It shows all of Hogwarts and who’s where.”
Before he moved forward with the obvious, Harry maneuvered himself down to Draco’s hips so he could use his tongue in the manner Draco has specifically asked for.
“And I believe that’s my cue to cut in,” McGonagall said with a faint blush. “Despite the fact of what we have or have not told anyone, Mr. Potter will not allow you out of his sight, Mr. Malfoy. This is unacceptable in a school environment. You both have different classes and different hobbies. Your houses are different. It would not do to allow Mr. Potter to be in the dungeons or you into Gryffindor Tower. Mr. Potter’s physical impairment makes things harder. I realize he is capable of taking care of himself, but we don’t want to scare the other children with wordless and wandless magic. And we don’t want He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named to know either.
“And you are pregnant,” she continued. “That alone changes everything. Your course load would have to be rethought and restructured; no potions, no practical transfiguration, no care of magical creatures. A jostle in the hallway that was just a bit too hard could hurt you, cause you to fall, and further on down the line, cause you to miscarry in the worst scenario. It’s just not a good idea. And we surely don’t want You-Know-Who to know about this either. He would surely kill you and your child, or maybe he would take the child as it is Mr. Potter’s. The things he could do with-” Her mouth kept moving but there was no longer any sound coming out of it. She quickly realized this and her hands went to her throat.
Harry’s grip on Draco’s shoulders tightened minutely, but enough that Snape could see it. He smirked. “Severus,” Draco warned, “if you bait him, I will not stop him from hexing you. Or make him reverse it. I don’t understand why you can’t play nice. Sometimes his mothering is annoying and I feel as if he’s smothering me. But at least I know he’s trying to help me because he loves me and wants nothing but the best for me. Sometimes I feel like you’re only helping so you can get Harry riled up so you two can fight. I will not be a part of this, gentlemen.” And with that, he stood and walked to his and Harry’s room. A second later, his voice rang out loud and clear. “And these two beds will soon be joined to make one bed!”
Harry jumped to his feet and gestured wildly. Without even waiting for Draco to translate, he thrust Snape out of the room using magic alone. Then he closed, locked, and warded the door. Snape immediately began yelling through the door, trying to open it, and banging on it once he realized magic wouldn’t work. As soon as Snape was locked out of the room, Harry turned to Draco and placed both hands over his body, palms down. Draco sighed and lay back, allowing Harry to do the scan without interruptions. After a few moments, Harry lowered his hands.
“Draco, Draco calm down,” Snape soothed. He pulled his godson up into his arms for a hug, but kept his eyes on Harry in case the Gryffindor took offence to him hugging the blonde. Besides a frown and a tightening of his fists, Harry made no complaint. “It’s okay, he wouldn’t do that. He wanted me to get you out. Now you are, you don’t have to worry about any of that, not now not ever. We will protect you. Me and Dumbledore and the other professors and… and Harry.”
He’d have to approach the situation carefully. At seven months in, Draco’s balance was nearly non-existent. He wasn’t able to get off the couch by himself any longer. It caused him great distress. Especially because it meant he couldn’t storm away from a situation. He also couldn’t pace, because turning took a great deal more effort and thought than it used to. More than once, he’d had to catch the boy before he fell. And more often than that, Harry did.
“We’ll need to let everyone know. We have to find a time where Severus, McGonagall, Pomfrey, and Dumbledore can all be together. And sometime when we can leave these rooms. I don’t want my wedding in these rooms, Harry. I want to be in the Great Hall or something. Then I can imagine it’s at least filled with people and that I’m having a grand party. I can at least have decorations on one table for all of us, and pick out robes for us. And vows, we could write our own vows.”
“I-I know,” Draco stuttered, wiping his eyes clear of tears. “I just don’t understand how he could do that. He always taught me to be proud of who I am, that a Malfoy never bowed down to anyone. And then, then I learn this! It’s just not right, not right at all. I was so happy…”
“Yes… well,” Harry said, pulling his hand away from the doctor who was still shaking it. “Please, sit. I wanted to ask you just a few questions. Do you know who I am?”
“Severus!” he shouted. The Potions Master steeled himself and took a step forward, head bowed as the Dark Lord stopped pacing. “Why was I not made aware of the training the boy has obviously been put through?”
Malfoy senior rushed to his child, gathering him close. Despite the public farce he’d had to show, he really did care for his son. Even in private, due to his wife’s allegiances, he wasn’t able to show any concern for the boy. Now a young man, he had a lot of time to make up for in his emotional neglect.
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
, Harry signed, then took Draco in his arms for a deep kiss. With no Dark Lord looming over their heads, he wanted to practice producing the next heir to their Houses.
“Harry and I never slept together,” Blaise said. “We want our marriage annulled so Harry can marry Draco and change McKay’s name to Malfoy, since he is a Malfoy. But, no one will believe that we haven’t had sex since we’ve been together over a year and a child was born. We need you to take a paternity test for McKay and a Veratiserum test for Harry and me to prove this is the truth. Can you do that? And stay silent about it?”
Harry jerked his hands free from Draco’s, which was still covering them, and gestured to his boyfriend. “He says his senses are already strengthened more than necessary, Severus. He doesn’t need a potion.”
“Well that’s a ridiculous question, Headmaster. I know almost as much about Severus as Severus knows. We practically grew up together, once my father took an interest in him. I funded much of his education, for which I became his sounding board. I know of his years with the Dark Lord, obviously. I know of his family; though there are only a handful of living souls left, that is a handful more than he wishes it to be. I know of–”
“He’s pregnant, Hermione. There are a number of men who are able to. It’s not uncommon, though I’ve never met one personally. And I’m assuming the baby is Harry’s. That would be why they stayed hidden when we were in the headmaster’s office the last time. He doesn’t want anyone to know... any of it.”
“Well, they didn’t. They only just now told Dumbledore about it because of how hot it burned when you nearly depleted your magic. By the way, removing two Dark Marks and then using legillimancy to chew me out is
“–change everything! What am I supposed to do?! That’s all I’ve ever known, all I’ve ever been taught!”
“Should we have chicken, duck, or fish as the main course? That will decide everything else, of course. If we have fish, we can have red wine served, but not if we have chicken. On second thought, scratch the chicken. Duck or fish? I wonder if anyone has any allergies? That would be a fiasco. Hmmm, although duck would probably be best, I want some fish. Okay, so fish. What soup goes with fish? Let’s go with… A vegetable medley maybe? Yes, that sounds good. It would also show Pomfrey I’m eating healthy as well, and gaining more weight. Merlin knows I don’t need to gain anymore weight!
There was silence once more. “O-oh,” Harry finally said. “Th-that’s okay, I guess. I… I can do that. Is everything okay with McKay, Theresa?” He pasted an obviously fake smile on his face as he turned to the medi-witch.
“Very wise. If I’m not nearby, they will be alerted. I will take these to them immediately then. Smart thinking, Potter…-Malfoy.” He rose and left the rooms quickly. That blasted name change still confounded him!
Harry pulled out his tongue and quickly lined his prick up at Draco’s entrance. A little faster than he’d planned, he pushed into his husband and bottomed out. Draco cried out and came over the sheets. “Yes, Harry! Yes! Fuck me! Fill me up! I need your seed, your come! Only you, Harry!” He tried to thrust himself back onto his lover’s prick, but Harry held him still. “So big, so full. Oh, I can feel you pulsing inside of me. It’s perfect! So big… Only you, love, only you.”
And Draco did. Because it was their anniversary. And what Harry wanted on their anniversary, Harry got. Just because it ended well for him too, being balls deep in Harry’s arse, well…
Harry smirked and snatched the paper from Snape’s hand, writing something down before giving it back.
“Look at all that hair,” Blaise said quietly. “And it’s so dark. Looks like he’ll have your hair Harry.”
“If I may, Mr. Weasley?” Dumbledore asked, reaching across his table for the parchment. Ron freely gave it. “I would like to see the Forbidden Forest please,” he asked the map. After a few seconds, he continued with, “All of the Forest if you please.” Another few seconds of silence. “It will not show me anything but the edge surrounding the school.”
“She wouldn’t do that Harry,” Blaise said with a smile. “A divorce is just as scandalous as the true story in this case. Not only would we be ridiculed, but she and father as well. No, she wouldn’t do that. Besides, she likes you.”
She grabbed Ron’s hand once more and pulled him behind her as she rushed to Dumbledore’s office. It took a few moments to get past the Gargoyle, but once they did they ran up the stairs and burst into his office. “Professor Dumbledore, sir!” Ron gasped as they hurried into the office. “Professor Dumbledore, sir, we need to speak with you.”
chapter? I rather liked it. It was a bear to write, but I think it was a good one. Let me know what you think in a review please!
Harry nodded and stood to dismiss the woman back to the kitchens. “Dr. Mitchsens?” Harry called next.
He got out to the Apparation point, waited for his cue to go, and then Apparated home. Well, Apparated close to home. Between him and Draco they were so paranoid about everything; they had a ward for insects, temperatures past a certain degree, salesmen, muggles, you name it! Excited, but determined to act like there was nothing special about the day, Harry hurried up to the house. The wards accepted him and his magical signature, allowing him to pass through easily.
“Have you ever had children?” The doctor nodded. “Then you understand. No matter what I say to him right now will be wrong, and it will upset him terribly. Simply put, this ham will be a peace offering in which I can give him what he wants before asking him not to talk to me like he did. I am not his servant; I am his husband.” The doctors merely nodded in understanding and agreement. “Would any of you like some ham?” He held out a plate with some on it in offering to the four doctors. All but Dr. Rhodes took some. “Dr. Rhodes?”
Harry decided to use the spell to write in the air in front of Draco so he wouldn’t have to move from his lounging position curled up behind his mate.
Also from the Malfoy family, a personal house elf to take care of the baby. Harry wasn’t so sure about that last gift. The only real experience he had with house elves was Dobby, Winky, and Kreacher. None were exactly promising. But the longer this elf was around, the more Harry grew accustomed to it. It was very helpful to Draco. Being a nanny elf, it knew what expecting mothers needed most. Sometimes, she even knew what Draco needed before Harry did. She didn’t seem to mind when Draco suddenly changed his mind and needed the whole nursery moved around, repainted, new furniture, etc. Harry had learned not to interrupt his nesting husband and certainly not to question his choices.
“He sure is happy to dole them out,” Snape murmured, then fled the Headmaster’s office with a whirl of his robes. It was completely ludicrous that he had to
“What ‘he’s not’ is going anywhere. He’s unconscious. And I aim to put you in the same state in a matter of minutes.”
“One moment, Madam Pomfrey,” Draco said with a wave of his hand, not taking his eyes off the slowly spinning wand. It was almost stopped now. When it finally did, it was pointing more toward Harry than Draco. “Damn it. It’s a biased wand!” he snapped, snatching the wand from the floor and getting back to his feet; Harry helped him back to the bed. “It’s your wand. Of course it’s going to point to you. It recognizes your magic better than mine.”
“By doing as he was told, yes. Do you know what he is told to do? He was told to do it then, and he’s told to do it now.”
“No, she told me everything I needed to know to gather the information myself. The gift was from me, not Granger.”
“Why are you in the sitting room? I’m hungry. Do we have any fried ham?” Harry walked into the room. “Blaise, are you- Am I interrupting something?” He looked around at the three women, one man, and Blaise as if their faces alone would give him the answers he sought.
“I’m sorry, Harry,” Draco sighed. “I’m not understanding. Here, use this.” He conjured then handed a quill and piece of parchment to his lover. The sign language they used only went so far, and only to the necessary conversations. Whatever Harry was trying to say hadn’t previously been necessary, apparently.
Harry had been livid. You don’t hurt women and children. You don’t go after the vulnerable. Severus and Lucius had betrayed Voldemort – fine, go after them. They were capable of standing up for themselves. Narcissa? Draco? They weren’t a part of this war. It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t right. There were rules to war! When he found out the true extent of Narcissa’s injuries, he nearly went off to find Voldemort right then and there. It took Lucius and Severus to hold him back physically.
“Mister Potter! You will unhand him-!” Again, Severus froze mid-sentence. He looked over the two boys in front of him. They had come into his classroom in their school uniforms, with their hair brushed and bodies washed. Those were not the same two boys in front of him now. Harry was without his glasses, his hair more mussed than usual. Both had a look about them that screamed ‘I need a bath!’. Their clothing was the bare minimum, and even that was ripped to shreds. The only exception was the cloak wrapped about Draco. It seemed as if Harry were trying to shield the boy from Severus. He pulled him closer, and made sure the cloak was covering every bit that could possibly be exposed save his head and feet.
“If I may?” Snape asked quietly. “I think Minerva’s talk scared Draco considerably. When Potter noticed how upset he was becoming, he silenced Minerva so as to remove the threat to his… boyfriend,” he sneered when he could not think of another proper word as to what Draco was to Harry. “I say we allow him to calm down before we resume our conversation. In a different direction, of course.”
“Potter, this is a magical forest outside of a magical school. Pathways may just disappear if they want to.” He sighed and continued walking. “And before you ask, yes I am going to continue walking. Walking is better than waiting. Do you know what’s in this forest? There are-”
“Yes, my Lord. My son has reported that the Slytherin dorms were in chaos for a short time before Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson stepped up to fill Draco Malfoy’s place.”
Harry Potter, yes? Well, the only people who know this marriage is a farce is you, Harry, Blaise, me, and Mrs. Zabini.”
There, a dark and horrible black cloud of pulsing energy there. But it was painful, even for Harry. The energy wouldn't go as peacefully like the rest had; this energy fought back. But he knew he couldn't give up. He was the only one who could help this man. No matter his personal feelings for him, this was Draco's father. This man had tried his best to keep Draco from coming to any harm. This man was important to Draco. If for no other reason, Harry would help him because of that.
“You did it again, didn’t you?” Draco said, his eyes on Harry. “What have I told you about that? If I don’t want to sleep then I’m not going to! You can’t do this alone! I need to-” He stopped suddenly and looked around, as if he was just realizing where he was. “We’re… we’re back? It wasn’t a dream?” He looked at Harry for his answer, and received a shake of the head. “Oh thank Merlin, Harry! You did it! You got us back!” He sat up quick and threw his arms around the dark haired boy’s neck, loudly weeping into it. “I thought it was a dream. I thought it was all a lie and that I’d wake up in your arms back in the Forest and wonder how the day would go. I was so worried that it was all a dream, that my- Harry? What’s wrong?” He pulled back and looked at Harry in concern.
While Snape’s face turned an alarming shade of red, Draco looked at Harry in confusion. Hurriedly, Harry began moving his hands in weird twists and shapes. After a few moments, Draco nodded and smiled softly. Then he laughed outright before turning to his godfather. “They thought you were after the Philosopher’s Stone? Well that’s a laugh!”
“Oh Harry! We’re going to be getting married! I need paper and a pen please. I find it so much easier to use than a quill and parchment.” Harry conjured the things for him, then he was lost in his own world of planning and muttering.
shortly. Suffice to say, Harry and I are married and we are expecting our first child. We do not yet know the gender. I am due next month, after Harry’s birthday.”
Dumbledore turned to Draco. “Repeat after me. I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, in the name of the spirit of Merlin that resides within us all, by the life that courses within my blood, and the love that resides within my heart, take thee, Harry James Potter, to my hand, my heart, and my spirit to be my chosen one. To desire and be desired by thee, to possess thee, and be possessed by thee, without sin or shame, for naught can exist in the purity of my love for thee. I promise to love thee wholly and completely without restraint, in sickness and in health, in plenty and in poverty, in life and beyond, where we shall meet, remember, and love again. I shall not seek to change thee in any way. I shall respect thee, thy beliefs, thy people, and thy ways as I respect myself.”
Harry bowed his head respectfully and bit his lip. He could ‘say’ whatever he wanted and Snape would be none the wiser, but that wasn’t the point. Instead, he looked up at the man, pointed at him, pointed at himself, then interlaced his fingers in front of him.
“My mum made sure I’d be able to sustain myself in case anything ever happened to me. You’d be surprised what all I can do. What sounds good, Harry?”
“Ah, a wise choice, Mr. Potter-Malfoy,” McGonagall cooed. “A hearty vegetable soup for such a cold night. And the salad looks divine as well. How is it, Albus?”
respect my wishes on this! No writing, no air talking, no legillimancy. They don’t need to know that! Nobody does!”
“Blaise!” Harry instantly said, turning to face him before turning back to the mysterious man. “That’s no way to talk-!” He froze when he saw Draco standing in the front room of the home. “D-draco?” he stammered. “Is it really you?” He didn’t wait for an answer before throwing himself at the blonde, bursting into tears. He sobbed and tried to talk as Draco led them to couches in the living room. “I thought you were gone and we couldn’t find you because you didn’t tell anyone where you were going and I was so worried and scared and mad because there was nothing for you to leave over and I cried so much and I was pregnant with your son because I’ve never slept with anyone but you even after I got married so McKay would have a name and I’m so sorry…” He kept going.
“I don’t think we will ever know how he did that, Poppy,” Dumbledore replied. “He was a remarkable young man before this incident in the Forbidden Forest. He is a most remarkable young man now. There are many–”
“It wasn’t a dream?” he asked in barely a whisper. “It’s really gone?” Without waiting for an answer, he slid the left sleeve of his infirmary robes up and gazed upon bare flesh. “It’s gone. It’s gone!”
“Do not blather on to me! I know it is a hopeless situation! He will torture us until we die or we cut off our own arms!”
Draco laughed softly and turned to face his godfather. Harry came around to sit beside Draco on the couch. “It was really just my emotions getting the best of me, really,” Draco said, holding Harry’s hand with both of his hands in his lap. “I was upset when Madam Pomfrey mentioned the name for our child. We both need an heir; we’re both the last of our lines. We are both powerful wizards. I’d say we needed at least two children, but we didn’t even know having one was possible. But that’s off topic. I was upset because when a witch has a child out of wedlock, she’s shunned. I don’t want that to happen to me. I want the Malfoy name to be a wonderful name. And I don’t want to besmirch the Potter name.
Harry looked up, fear in his tearful eyes. “What? What could you possibly want Blaise?” he whispered.
For several days, Harry kept Draco cooped up in Snape’s rooms. Of course, that wasn’t much different from how it had been before the wedding. Now, however, they would laugh at Snape’s attempts to remember to call Harry “Mr. Potter-Malfoy”. Usually the Potions Master would just get flustered and storm away; Draco had talked with him about using his husband’s given name rather than their combined surname. Snape was most displeased.
Lucius internally flinched, not really knowing what to do. He’d been so worried about his son he’d neglected to prepare for this happening. Really, it was a miracle it had taken this long to happen. “My Lord, he is not ready to undergo this taking at this time.”
“Mr. Potter, if you will please follow me,” Poppy said, motioning to a back room. She began to walk forward, but Harry didn’t move. He nodded at Severus, and then motioned for him to follow. “Mr. Potter, Professor Snape has a class to teach and will not be joining us. You will follow me so I may treat you now. Please.” She turned and continued walking, but Harry still didn’t move until Severus had disappeared through the fireplace once more. “Would you care to tell me how you came to be in this state? Lay Mr. Malfoy on the bed here, if you please. And you can lay down on this one here.”
