Remus paused and Harry sit back a bit to process it so far. He figured they were waiting to see if he had questions before continuing. He did, but knew they may get answered later. After a few moments, Harry nodded, letting Remus know to continue.
As the sun made its way into the room, the boys tried to stay asleep just a tad bit longer.  Harry, always the first to wake, turned to look at the boy behind him.
Draco explained that Poppy made him leave and he was taking the cloak back to sneak in.  A knock, more like a slam, started hitting the door and Theo answered, being the closest.  James walked in and grabbed Draco, dragging him out.  The four followed the other two, knowing the father wasn’t going to say anything.  Draco was too stunned by the move that he willingly followed Harry’s dad.  They were going to his boyfriend anyway, which is where he wanted to be.  They bombarded their way into the hospital wing to see Harry throwing up what looked to be blood, Poppy trying to help him, and Sirius keeping Remus from tearing the woman to pieces as he shouted at her about his son.
The older men sighed and Sirius turned to his godson.  “I had to help with that.  I believe the muggle phrase is pulling out.  Moony, during the moon, can’t be controlled, or touched.  After a bit, we learned to tell signs on each other.  Well, when Moony was reaching that point, I helped James get out of the way.  Only twice didn’t it work.  Once before you and then you.”
Harry nodded, trying to come to terms with what to say.  He took in a breath and let it out.
The blonde watched as green eyes widened and took in what was said to him.  A smile graced both faces and hands moved to Harry’s stomach.
“What theory?”  Ron asked.
“I’m not sure.  We will figure it out.  Sirius as been going over some of the journals that tie the Blacks to the Potters and vice versa to see if he has anything in his vaults as well.”
Harry chuckled as they all walked out the door.
“Thank you.”
Harry’s fork paused at her comment and then looked at his ginger friend.
Harry, Remus, Sirius, and Narcissa watched as the young heir marched out of the room with his father trailing like a wounded animal after him.
Harry just moaned, knowing an answer wasn’t needed.  They hadn’t explored enough for the submission part of him to come into effect intimately and they were both alright with that.
“How is Harry, really, Poppy?”
“Yea, and unleashed Moony.  Tried to tell him that since he wasn’t Harry’s father, he had no say to what Harry could chose.  We won’t ever choose for him, but it brought out Moony
He felt draco smile against his chest as his hand moved into the hole in front of the shorts, wrapping his hand around the man under him.
“Yes, Mistress Cissy.  How’s Pipper be of service?”  A cute little elf in a pink pillowcase asked, popping next to the woman of the house.
“Me too.”  Harry whispered.
Draco shrugged.  “I don’t know.  They decided to let you sleep.  What happened out there, love?”
Harry pulled a green tee over his head and smiled at the elf.  “Can you please pop to Malfoy Manor to let Draco know that we accept his invitation and when he would like us, please?”
Harry smiled.  “I was hoping it was soon anyway.  Just figured I would be on top.”
All three men in the room looked at Harry.  Harry took a breath, trying to control the urge now that he knew what it was.  He didn’t want to attack and plead with Draco with his parents in the room.  The one time was enough.
Draco just nodded and Sirius opened the curtain back up to see the girl had woken and was asking about her mate.  Before they could stop him Draco was up and heading over to the other bed.
Harry didn’t take control a lot, not like he seemed to be doing now.  Draco loved it.  They both knew with the gene what their parts were.  They just also knew that being in the moment, being just Harry and Draco was more important in learning how to be intimate with each other.  Harry propped himself up on one arm to get a better grip on Draco and smiled.
“Tell them to give us five minutes to dress, then to just floo.  They have been added when Harry started seeing Draco.”
The more he spoke, the quieter he gotten.  Ron had to lean in to hear him by the end.  They could see his face.  He didn’t quite hear what their friend had said.  Harry had to state the last part again and then they waited.  Waited for who knows how long before Ron nodded and leaned back, the quill he was still holding to fell on the map beside them.  They didn’t say anything for a few minutes and just let Ron process what that could mean for them, for Harry.  They watched as his eyes closed and then open again, revealing nothing.
Harry smiled.  “Yes.  There’s things he still needs to know, but yes.  I’m falling in love with him, Ron.  I think he loves me too.  We just haven’t said anything.”
Draco smiled.  “Not a bit.  You have been without them for quite a while, your whole life.  They being here is fine and makes sense.  They were personal with your parents, especially James.  They know more than us, or even my parents, let alone Hermione Granger.  I think they’ve warmed up to us being together, anyhow.”
Harry’s brow furrowed as he processed that and then looked at Remus.  “I have a sibling?”
"No. Lucius saved Sirius, gave information to the order that even Severus didn't know. I have the memories to prove it. Severus gave them before...before he died. Narcissa saved my life in that forest just minutes ago. Draco saved us at the manor and practically gave me his wand, making it to where I could kill the son of a bitch in their house. They go free. I will fight the ministry if I have to, Kingsley."
The man lifted his head some more and Harry watched as recognition to something showed on his face.  He turned back to the others.
“Morning, babe.”  he whispered.
“Your father helped me out a lot when I went to school here.  It if wasn’t for him, I wouldn’t have met the people that led to my mate and my son.  However, no one really knew him.  He was just as power hungry as Voldemort and was willing to do anything for that power.  I’m sorry honey, and I know you won’t believe.  That’s ok because he’s your daddy.  If I find Harry’s daddy though, I will not like your daddy anymore.”
Draco nodded, and then turned so they could be comfortable, Harry slipping into the floor with Hermione.  They ate dinner with their family and then they all walked to their common room.
“You’re staying?”
“You seem happier, mate.”  he whispered.
“I swear all that and the repercussions the oath on my magic and the house of malfoy.”
Draco nodded.  “Yes, also took an oath on his magic with Remus to not hurt or abuse Harry.  Sirius recited it so it would be bad if he broke it.”
Sirius stood and walked next to Remus.  “Hold Remus’ hand in yours.  I will recite and ignite the oath, but you will be making it to him.  He’s Harry’s father after all.”
Draco knew Harry was wanting his reaction and so he held his finger up so his lover knew he wanted to process before reacting.  It made sense.  They were both overthinking some things because of their experiences.  Could it really be that simple?  Could they relax enough to let the instinct out more?
Draco watched the wolf leave and wondered, not for the first time, how they would really feel about him being with their cub.  He hadn’t voiced the concerns with Harry, though.  He didn’t want Harry to think he didn’t want to face anything with him.  It was the complete opposite really.  While being able to be with the man he had wrapped in his arms and still uphold duty, that’s not what this was for the slytherin.  Harry was always something Draco had, he was a constant.  Someone who didn’t treat him different because of his father, didn’t care much for that really.  In fact, the most intriguing was that Harry didn’t give a rat’s ass about Lucius Malfoy.
Draco laughed out loud.  “She’s waiting on you, dumbass.”
Harry pulled back and looked at her. "What about his parents? Lucius helped hide Sirius, helped Severus. Narcissa lied to the bastard for me, telling him I was dead. They helped our side as much as their son."
The two adults looked at the person who was now in the room with them.  Remus had his arms folded across his chest while Molly’s hands rested on her hips.  Harry could see the determination in her face and ran a hand down his.  He stepped closer to the two adults in the room and sighed.
Harry leans back and stretches his arms. He puts them down and looks at his dad.
“I know.  Hermione said the same thing.  The thing is...I can.”  When he saw the puzzled expression, Harry went into what the marauders discussed with him yesterday.
“It’s open.”
"Harry. Severus figured it out that year. My first moon, I made him bring you as close as he could to my room. I could smell that you already made the human change, but since no one knew you were mine, the wolf thing could have happened. I had to tell him. He promised not to tell Albus because of what it could mean to you. Hell, Potter's getting raped to have powerful children wasn't just that one time. We were both so scared Albus would find out. He was just as power greedy as Voldemort and I didn't trust him, none of us did. He just had the fact Voldemort was scared of him at his side." Remus explained.
“To see a man about a contract.  It’s about time you took your place, Draco.”
Harry just nodded and Draco smiled a bit, a small nod.  All Harry could think of through dinner was how cute Draco looked with a smile upon his face.  No one really talked through dinner, and after it, the adults left the younger ones.  Draco led Harry through the house and out into a small garden, where he gestured for Harry to sit down.  Harry did and waited for the blonde to say what he needed.  He watched as Draco mumbled a bit to himself and touched his shoulder.
“They’ve been like this all summer.  Molly kicked it out of them, not that we all know what exactly that means.  Harry will be quieter and looking to Draco for guidance.  It has to do with what we discussed when making housing arrangements, Minerva.  However, if you watch, they both bring out the best in the other.”
“Did anyone notice she said broken or gone?  What would be gone?  Draco.”
They were looking into that first as those journals had more information in them.  Grabbing the shampoo, he lathered his hands and scrubbed the cleanser into his scalp, using it to thoroughly wash his dark hair.  After he leaned his head forward and watched the soap go down the drain till the water turned clear.  He washed his body and then turned the water off.  Wrapping a towel around his waist, he opened the door and made his way to his room, having left his jeans in the closet.  Harry shut the door and then dropped the towel, grabbing a pair of jeans and slipping them on.  Pulling on a white tee for the day, Harry made his way to the kitchen for some breakfast before Draco was expected at 10.
“I know it’s—” Neville took a gulping breath, “It’s shit but can you—”
“Thank you for the lovely night, Ronald.” She said into his ear, her hair engulfing them both. It smelled like eucalyptus and lilacs.
“But I thought-“ Neville said, frowning and thinking of Draco. He stopped himself, It wasn’t his place. He sighed. “I didn’t kiss you because I like you. Well, I think I liked you a little. But mainly it was because you were there and we’d just escaped death and you pay attention to me.”
she thinks with awe at the leaving feast of her second year. Right then Luna Lovegood’s smile isn’t dreamy or vacant at all- it’s full, full, full. It’s radiant like the first morning sun. It burns.
Ron had been unable to comfort his best friend, too consumed with trying to breathe through his laughter.
Remus seemed slightly surprised by this statement. “Well. Only Sirius legally”
Hermione rolled her eyes at her boyfriend, “And what is Barry up to this time? Giant snake?”
“I need your help” He said, dropping down onto the ground next to her and leaning back against the log. Luna had been sitting near Hagrid’s hut, soaking up the last rays of September sun. “Seriously. I have an ethical conundrum”
Arriving on the platform was bittersweet. It didn’t feel like going home to Hermione but instead as if she was abandoning the first place she’d ever felt truly accepted.
“And that’s only the longest recorder, not the usual. I’d say we would have seven minutes.” Neville shrugged.
“I didn’t have anywhere to go.” Harry said simply, in that way he had of saying entirely tragic things in a casual way. “You and ‘Mione were always good to me like that.”
Hermione was surprised, however, when ten minutes after everyone else had left for the feast Harry suddenly sprung up from his seat (scattering the playing cards they’d been using all over the rug) and declared they were going on an adventure.
“Thank you, sir. It's nice to meet you. I'm sure most of what you heard is exaggerated greatly,” Harry replied shaking Investigator Barnes.
“I don’t think that would be a good idea,” Narcissa interjected before Barnes could continue.
“Could I have a moment with you two?” Hermione asked. Draco and Harry looked at each other, and then Harry nodded.
“You haven’t allowed the bond to finish initiating?” She accused more than asked. “Don’t you know how incredibly dangerous that could be for the two of them?”
“You’re in charge Inspector,” Narcissa said giving forced smile and turned away.
“Who Malfoy is bonded to, it’s Potter,” she said clarifying her statement. McDaniels blanched like Pomfrey had just moments before.
“Well if you both are ready let us head up to the castle and start getting your story down,” Barnes said shifting topics and taking the light off of Harry. Both of them nodded and headed out behind Inspector Barnes.
“I’m sorry for how I’ve treated you in the past. It was ignorance and fear, which is not an excuse, but all I can do is apologize,” Draco replied sincerely.
“I don’t honestly know but I would say no,” McDaniels looked worried. “Why do you ask?”
“Did you think we were just going to sit around having tea with each other for the rest of our lives?” Draco asked with a hint of his old sarcasm. He had tried to stop himself, but it was out before he could stop it. He knew he needed to be more tolerant and patient with others and Harry especially, but it was hard. In reality he was just as nervous thinking about the physical aspect of the bond.
“It’s an unnecessary distraction for them. They need to be concentrating on getting to know one another.”
“Excuse me sir, but I thought I was going to the dorms with the other detainees?” Draco hedged not wanting to cause any issues.
“I won’t take much of your time, but I just wanted to say that I’ve also been doing some reading, and while I have a lot to learn about bonds, I do know this is not something to be taken lightly. We’ve had our differences Draco, but if there is anything either of you needs, I’m here to help.”
“Harry!” Ginny said excitedly as she hugged him. Harry instinctively brought his arms up around her to return the hug. Hermione and Barnes stopped noticing the exchange. “I’ve been going crazy wanting to see you! Everything happened so fast after the battle,” Ginny continued as she squeezed him tighter and then pulling back to look at him. He forced a small smile for her and told her he had missed her too.
“It was my suggestion, Narcissa,” McGonagall spoke up to her right. “I felt that Draco needed someone here for him, in addition to the fact that you may have some specialized knowledge about what we are dealing with. It seems this is a poorly understood area of magic to most.”
“I think I should floo Inspector Barnes about this and hold him here,” Pomfrey said composing herself now that she had a plan formulating.
“The Weasleys, Ms. Granger, and your mother,” Wilcox said, smiling. Draco felt his stomach knot up. He was not looking forward to another confrontation.
Within minutes everyone turned when footsteps were heard approaching. Moments later a knock at the door. Barnes opened the door allowing the royal blue robed guard and Narcissa Malfoy into the room. Despite being disheveled with her white blonde hair falling around her face, half out of the intricate style it had been done in, and her robes torn and dirty, she still was graceful with a regal air to her. However, her previous contemptuous, superior look was gone. She seemed to have aged much since Harry had last seen her.
They both wordlessly forced down a bit of egg and a half of toast. Satisfied, Wilcox gathered the dishes onto the tray and in moments it had disappeared. Harry and Draco had already showered and dressed before coming out to breakfast so with a nod he turned raised his wand and muttered a few words. A flash of blue light came from around the door then swung open.
Sorry about the formatting on this chapter. The tabs are not copying over.
Draco merely nodded, not trusting his voice to respond. He was beginning to regain control of himself. He hoped that whatever they thought was going on would come back negative and he would be allowed to return to his tent. The high emotion and being so far from Potter again was making the ache in his chest grow. He reached up unconsciously and rubbed the center of his chest.
“What is it you wanted to know about Draco?”
“Mrs. Weasley, please try to calm yourself. I understand your anger, but Harry is just doing what he believes is right,” Barnes said trying to calm the situation.
“No,” both boys responded in unison.
I know this is a bit of an odd point to end but I really wanted to get this up. I have been playing with this chapter for about two weeks and I really want to move into some alone time with the two and spend some time with that building the relationship.
“So, he’s free to go then Ramirez said to the retreating healer. He stopped and turned and smiled at her before responding simply with no. She huffed as they walked outside to talk. Knowing they were right outside the door she didn’t turn on Draco again but did give him a withering glare.
She sat him down in the arm chair next to her and gave him a moment to compose himself.
Draco froze at these words. He knew very well that there was a way to break the bond, but both parties had to agree to the break, and breaking the bond would leave permanent changes in both people, unlike with a magically induced bond. Harry was also taken off guard. He was still very unsure about all of this. He could see the expectant looks on the Weasley’s faces waiting for him to agree to breaking the bond excitedly but he couldn’t. Draco had been his enemy for years, but he was different, and Harry wanted to see this through.
“It seems that, from your explanation, that they would be easier to keep apart for the next few days till Mr. Malfoy’s hearing. It would not look good if they were spending so much time in close quarters since Mr. Potter plans on testifying on behalf of Mr. Malfoy.” At this last statement, Draco’s grey eyes widened noticeably. He couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Potter was going to testify for him? Mrs. Weasley was also shocked by this and turned to Harry.
“Thank you, Minerva. You’ve always been a fair woman. I do have quite an extensive understanding of bonding that has been passed down through the Black family.”
“That was said for the others present. Despite coming into this situation late we have been able to gather quite a bit of information thus far as well as listening to the rumblings from Death Eaters we have captured. Your family is not in high regard with them at the moment and you especially,” Wilcox gave Draco a wane smile and opened the flap.
Draco walked out of the tent. “Sorry to have kept you waiting Inspector,” Draco said ignoring the rueful look on her face. She made her dislike of him clear but he was trying to behave, being in enough trouble as it was, but he was struggling to keep his upper crust, pureblood ideology in check. He no longer believed in many of those ideals but years of training and habit were hard to break.
“Yeah, I lived in the cupboard under the stairs once I was too big for a crib till the summer after my first year at Hogwarts.”
Ramirez looked like she wanted to punch someone. “Is this really necessary?” she asked exasperatedly.
Harry was becoming very anxious, so much so that it was smashing into Draco. Without thinking, he got up and went to Harry putting his arm around him. Molly caught this out of the corner of her eye.
Hermione gave a quick smile and left their chambers, leaving the two young men and Inspector Wilcox.
“What about you Mr. Malfoy?” Barnes asked.
Pomfrey and McDaniels looked at each other, their knowledge of spontaneous bonding limited.
“We believe the bond started when Harry saved Draco in the Room of Requirement. Unfortunately, it was only a partially initiated bond. It was just discovered a short while ago,” Madame Pomfrey continued the story.
This chapter was longer than my previous chapters but I had a lot of ground to cover. Hope you enjoy.
“After the medical exam, you will be questioned by one of the interrogators and then returned here. Your initial interrogation will be the lengthiest and you may be brought back for further questioning at a later time.” Draco nodded expecting this already. “After that, it will be a waiting game here till the judiciary panel is ready to hear your case.”
Madame Pomfrey hurried into her office and shut the door. Grabbing some floo powder she quickly connected with Inspector Barnes floo and explained what was going on. He was surprisingly calm to her and said he would be coming up in just a few minutes. She closed out and was heading back to see Draco when Molly Weasley, Ron, Hermione and Harry looking awful.
“Right,”
“What’s going on mate?” he asked sounding worried as well.
Out in the tent, Harry had been laying quietly almost back to sleep when he felt the wave of anxiety and fear coming over him again. He also felt the ache in his chest surge to almost a crushing pain. Scared he decided he had to get Hermione. He stumbled out of bed. Grabbed his glasses and wand muttering lumos. In the cone of light, he looked to the other side of the tent to find an empty bed. She must still be with the Weasleys. He threw on his jeans and shoes and walked the few yards to their tent. Peeking inside he saw Hermione and Ron seated on the couch talking softly and hold hands. He pulled back and rapped on the flap to make some noise before entering. They looked up at him as he entered looking pale and sweaty.
Madame Pomfrey walked back into the exam room to find a still ashen Draco and an impatient inspector Ramirez eagerly waiting for news.
“And why is that Mrs. Malfoy?” Barnes asked, irritation apparent in his voice.
Draco was sitting on a piece of broken stone wall, his back against what had once been the side of a window opening. His eyes were closed and one foot was resting on the opening and the other on the ground. Harry approached cautiously not sure how he would react to him.
“I’m afraid not at the moment,” Harry’s heart sank. He wasn’t even sure why he wanted to see Draco or what he would say but there was something in him telling he needed to see him. He felt the sharp ache in his chest that had been almost gone suddenly return. Barnes obviously detecting Harry’s reaction quickly followed up.” He will be going through his medical clearance exam this evening and then his interrogation tomorrow. Once these are done then you can see him. With his hearing approaching it would not look good to have him getting outsider visits prior to giving his statements,” Harry nodded his understanding, the ache in his chest dulling a note but still very much there.
“Tell me about how you grew up?” Harry asked.
Draco looked down at the Dark Mark on his forearm as he changed, disgusted by it and himself. Disgusted that he had once been foolish enough to believe in this creature and his ideas. Disgusted that he had not been stronger at resisting being branded. He finished changing and pulled back the curtain.
“I think the same is in order for you lot.” Harry noticed that as they were talking Ron and Hermione had also come over with McGonagall and Neville following close behind. “We have tents set up near the lake. You’ll stay there while we are investigating. Once we have finished with you, you may return to your homes. We will try to complete this as quickly as possible but with so many people we thought it best to keep everyone close and deploy as many investigators as possible. Since you four have played such a large part in all this I have decided to handle your questioning personally and it also means you will probably be here the longest.” Barnes explained. Ron opened his mouth to speak but Barnes was already aware of what he was going to ask. Holding up his hand he responded, “I am aware Mr. Weasley that you and many others have tragically lost members of your family and you will, of course, be given time to attend any services.
“Good morning!” Barnes called cheerfully. “How did you both sleep?”
“Yes sit,” Draco replied and headed to bed. He had changed into a pair of shorts and tee shirt for bed and crawled under the covers, exhausted but not sleepy. He lay awake, his mind racing through the events of the past few days and of what might be coming. Sleep finally overcame him about 1:00 am, but even that was fitful, filled with dreams and nightmares of his time with Voldermort.
“Almost done now, just two more spells, but everything is looking good,” Pomfrey smiled at Draco as she waved her wand. Draco began to relax; maybe possible partial bond would slip by. Then Madame Pomfrey’s brows knitted with a questioning look and she mumbled something about being odd. Draco felt as if a block of ice had been dropped into his stomach. He paled and his palms began sweating. He was trying to keep his anxiety in check but it wasn’t working. He was certain that if the bond was discovered between him and Potter that he would be accused of casting it as a way to protect himself even though it had spontaneously occurred. Why it had was still a mystery to Draco but even if he knew it wouldn’t change things now.
“What? Oh, sorry, Hermione. Yeah, that sounds good but I forgot to ask Inspector Barnes something. I’ll meet you back at the tent,” with that Harry turned on his heels and headed back to the small office without waiting for a response from Hermione. Harry knocked on the door to the office and waited.
Draco went to the small nook to look around at his new home for the time being. It was plain and spartan but comfortable. He removed his jacket and sat down in the chair, back stiff not able to fully relax. He had only been sitting a few minutes when the tent flap opened and a Hispanic woman of about thirty with jet black hair pulled back into a ponytail came into the tent. She walked with a quick purposeful stride, in her arms was a pack that Draco assumed was the clothing and other items mentioned by Wilcox. She approached Draco and extended the package to him.
“Inspector,” Harry said holding up his hand. “I don’t mean to interrupt but I had wanted to ask you about attending Fred Weasley’s funeral. Mr. Weasley sent word that they had moved it a few days out to allow for some family to get here.”
“Healer McDaniels I am sure we have taken enough of your valuable time if you would like to return to the wounded,” McGonagall said dismissing the healer. She then conjured a Patronus, spoke to it with a brief message and sent it off. “While your room is being prepared I wanted to have a word with you boys. This is going to be an extremely trying time for you both and I want you to know that whatever you need, either of you, I’ll do my best to help.”
“Oh Draco,” she pulled him close again, assuring him with her hug that he had nothing to worry about. “This certainly wouldn’t be how I hoped this would happen, but I love you Draco and I want you to be happy.” She pulled away from Draco and returned her attention to Inspector Barnes. “Thank you, but I doubt that you brought me here just to tell me this.” Her demeanor had taken a professional rather than defensive tone. She was a smart woman who knew that they needed something for her.
“Potter, I’m glad I found you,” McGonagall said making the last few strides.
Everyone nodded, stood, and said their goodbyes. Harry and the rest stood back allowing Draco to say a private goodbye to his mother before everyone left. Wilcox told them he would be just in the other room if they needed anything. They went into the bedroom on the left side of the sitting room to get ready for bed. They found two four poster beds neatly made with a set of pajamas on each for them. Not sure how far they could be from one another they agreed to each face the opposite way to change before brushing their teeth and crawling into bed leaving the curtains open.
“I’m not sure to be completely honest.” Harry looked at her quizzically. He had not known Professor McGonagall to be anything but to the point. “I’ve just received word that investigators from the International Magical Federation are on their way to investigate Voldemort and the Death Eaters. The Chancellor has convened a special judiciary panel to look into this.”
“No sir,” Draco replied not looking at him.
Ron closed his mouth and nodded satisfied with his response. Harry nudged him slightly and squeezed his shoulder.
By lunch time it was apparent that the boys were being worn down by the testing and they were brought back to their rooms for lunch. Originally they were to come back but the decision was made to allow them to stay in their quarters with a list of activities to help them get to know one another.
Draco looked up with a questioning look on his face. How was he considered a low-risk detainee? Especially with his family housing Voldemort for the last two years. Draco, however, had done everything he could to not involve himself in those atrocities and even prevent some, like his protection Luna Lovegood while she was detained at Malfoy Manor. Inspector Barnes caught the questioning look on Draco’s face.
“When I was old enough to reach the stove and push the vacuum, I was doing all the household chores and cooking all the meals. I wasn’t allowed to eat with them, though. I had to wait for them to finish, filling their glasses and clearing their plates. Whatever was left, which was usually little to nothing, I was allowed to take back to my cupboard to eat before bed.”
“I didn't think that you'd want to see me,” Harry replied not quite looking at Draco, his voice quiet.
“I think we should also go as well,” Hermione said knowing it wouldn’t be long before Ron would be losing his temper as well. Ron opened his mouth to argue but Hermione had already grabbed his hand and was pulling him towards the door. “We’ll be back to see you soon Harry.” With that, both had left the room.
“Why don’t you boys try some of the activities on the list that you were given?” he asked. They both looked at him like he had two heads. “Look, I know this isn’t easy, but the more you fight it, the worse it will be.” They both knew he was right, even if they didn’t want to admit it.
“Of course, write down what you would like and we will have them reviewed. If they are deemed acceptable then you can have them. Also, I wanted to go over some things that will be happening in the next few days. First, you will have a medical exam by a healer tomorrow. All detainees are getting this to ensure that there is no lingering spells or jinxes affecting them.” At this Draco unconsciously reached up and rubbed the center of his chest which was still aching.
“Both are healthy and adapting well to the bond. It’s growing stronger. I can easily detect it now with common detection spells. I do detect they are fighting it a bit, not intentionally. Both are very closed off emotionally and that is definitely slowing the process,” Pomfrey reported.
“Inspector may I go to my son,” she asked.
“What is this about, Hermione?” Harry asked.
“What are you talking about?” Barnes asked.
Barnes, McDaniels, and Pomfrey all looked at one another, knowing that he was lying to them but at this point, there is no reason to push him about it. Pomfrey and McDaniels left to go run diagnostics on Harry. Barnes stayed behind with Draco. Time seemed to crawl by until McDaniels and Pomfrey returned from examining Potter. When they walked back in they nodded to Barnes, confirming what was already known.
She led him up the lawn along the forest line like Wilcox had done, turning towards the back side of the Castle. Once they reached it they walked along the wall till they entered the courtyard and then the main entrance. They climbed the stairs to the fifth floor and walked down a long corridor till they reached the entrance to the hospital ward.
“Sir, I am requesting a transfer,” Ramirez said as soon as the door had closed.
“It’s quite alright, we were just on our way to start our interviews,” Barnes smiled as Mrs. Weasley. Ginny released Harry looking a little embarrassed and stepped back towards her mother. “If you are going to be around for a bit I can have someone find you when we take a break so you can visit?”
“I understand your fear Mr. Malfoy, but we will figure out a way for Harry to go and for you to be safe at the same time,” Barnes assured him although it didn’t seem to assuage Draco’s fears. “I think we should all get some rest we are going to have the first of many long days ahead of us.”
“Not a clue,” McDaniels answered without hesitation. “But I’d wager 10 galleons he does,” He said pointing to the door to the exam room.
“I’m sure it was very similar to yours, just in a non-magical family. I was spoiled and got whatever I wanted. I wish they hadn’t, but it’s what they felt was best.” Draco replied in a clipped voice, looking almost ashamed.
They spent the next few hours recalling their adventures over the last 7 years. Barnes only stopped occasionally to clarify a detail or ask a question. They stopped at the point of Voldermort’s return at the end of the fourth year during the conclusion of the Tri-Wizard Tournament.
“Is this true?” she asked turning to Draco, who looked down and nodded not trusting his voice.
Draco tried desperately to rein in his emotions, knowing that last wave when Ramirez pulled her wand had probably been felt by Potter. He pressed his hands into the table to not show the shaking.
“Yes, he’s quite alright I assure you. He has been placed in a tent by himself with an agent watching him at all times,” Harry nodded relaxing a bit hearing this but did not make a move to get up.
“I am also concerned, Mr. Potter. This stays between us but he will be in one of the tents near where you will be staying. Inspectors Wilcox and Ramirez will be watching him, but I am confident he will not abscond on us.” Barnes smiled and squeezed Harry’s shoulder gently before walking away.
“Molly, I know how hard this is. I’ve lost several people very special to me, and as much as that hurt I can’t imagine if one had been my child. But Potter has very solid reasons for testifying and I believe it is the right thing to do.” At this Mrs. Weasley seemed to calm again.
Once alone again Ramirez spun around her wand pointed at Draco, who was taken off guard, his mind whirling with thoughts about what the healer may discover.
“My mother,” was his response. “I think she could help with what’s going on.”
“Excuse me, Inspector,” Harry said as Barnes was turning to leave.
Out on the lawn, Harry had fallen into a deep sleep, exhausted from the day. Suddenly he was overcome by a heavy wave of fear and anxiety causing him to wake suddenly. He sat bolt upright a sheen of sweat on his face. His heart was racing and he was shaking slightly. Then the wave hit him again but it wasn’t like how he normally woke. He had not been having a nightmare and this second wave that passed through him was causing a physical reaction in him but it was like it was coming from outside of him. He wanted to call to Hermione and see if she knew what was happening but he felt stupid after the years of waking like this he would bother her now. He lay back down and tried to clear his mind and go back to sleep.
“I want to be transferred to another assignment. I didn’t join the investigation department to babysit a spoiled Death Eater.” At this last statement Narcissa visibly bristled, her mouth pursing and her jaw and neck muscles tightening. Barnes was also not pleased with this outburst.
Draco was stunned as Harry began to tell him about his family. He had assumed that he had been treated like a little prince and spoiled and fawned over, but it was the complete opposite. His family had gone out of their way to make him feel unloved and unwanted.
“Not exactly Harry. Your magical signature is what muggles would call a spirit. Despite how different you and Draco may appear, you are clearly more compatible than you can see,” Narcissa clarified. “But as long as you’re willing, we can help you through this.”
The door to the room opened and Madame Pomfrey came bustling in. She had always treated Draco with a kind but firm hand through the years, calling him out when he was faking for attention but also allowing him a safe haven when things were becoming too overwhelming.
“This boy is just as deserving of quality healing as anyone else,” she chided Ramirez. “He will stay here until we can completely clear him. Is that understood young lady?” Pomfrey watched as the use of young lady cut through the Inspector, her own game being played on her. She nodded curtly and Pomfrey bustled out of the room.
The next morning the boys were awakened by Wilcox after a night of fitful sleep. Breakfast was laid out on the table, but neither was very hungry and only picked at it while Wilcox read an American Wizarding newspaper.
“Would you like a sandwich? You must be starving,” Wilcox said offering Draco one of the sandwiches on a plate.
Harry’s mind was swirling. How had he not heard of IMF? Will they be fair in their investigations? Professor McGonagall was already moving away, no doubt trying to alert the key players to the upcoming investigation. There is nothing he could do about it now, so he decided it would be best to keep working and keep distracted. He turned and took one last look at Draco, seated now gazing out, lost in his thoughts. He had seen him try to help a few people but they either shied away or simply refused so he had moved off to the side awaiting his fate. Harry still couldn’t believe what he had done. When Harry jumped from Hagrid’s arms, Draco shot across the courtyard, throwing his wand to Harry. It was the bravest, dumbest, and out of character move, he had seen. If Voldemort had not been so stunned by Harry’s revival he would have certainly been killed mid run, and then to leave himself wandless as well. It very well saved everyone present and ended the war. Harry felt an ache in his chest. It had begun after the escape from the room of requirement, but with all that was happening he had assumed it was stress and nerves getting the best of him. Now however with the fight over he didn't know why it was still happening. Glancing over again at Draco, Harry wanted to go over to him but felt he would be rejected. While he didn't think that Draco would still be holding to childish rivalries, Harry was the last person Draco wanted comfort from since Harry represented everything that was causing Draco’s world to implode. McGonagall was walking toward Draco, a softer look on her face than last time they had faced each other when she ordered Filch to bring the Slytherins to the dungeons.
“Come in!” called Barnes through the door. “Ah Harry, what brings you back? Did you forget something?” Barnes looked questioningly at him.
“But we can talk about that and much later. We'll be interviewing you and everyone else present at the battle. That includes you too Mr. Malfoy.”
Draco nodded his head as she spoke to him, her hand resting on his shoulder. As she went on he looked to the ground and then shook his head no to something she said. She squeezed his shoulder and began to walk away. She glanced over, Harry tried to look away quickly but knew he had been caught. She looked at him with a look that seemed to say “don't just stare at him, go talk to him”. Harry got up and with hands shaking he made his way over to Draco.
“Inspector Ramirez will be here shortly with clothing and supplies,” Wilcox said sitting down in a chair.
“Good morning Harry,” Hermione said as Harry entered the kitchen.
“Absolutely,” Pomfrey replied coldly to her. I’ll be back shortly.
Mr. Weasley was on his feet at this point, trying to calm and restrain his wife. Ron and Ginny were staring daggers at Draco as he attempted to comfort Harry. Ginny was the only one to speak.
“Ah! Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, you look well this morning. Please come in and have a seat,” Pomfrey said looking up as they entered and motioning to the sitting area. Wilcox took a seat in a comfy armchair in the corner of the room, unobtrusive but able to see everything that was happening.
“Come with me young man,” said Inspector Wilcox with a distinctly New England American accent. “We’ll get you settled in and changed.” Draco glanced back at Harry and then walked off with Inspector Wilcox. Harry watched as he walked away, head down. Inspector Barnes began talking again.
“I was wondering when you were going to stop staring and come over,” Draco said as Harry approached not opening his eyes.
“We need to help them open up to each other or the bond will start trying to force the issue by starting to mimic magically induced bonds by not letting them be more than a few feet apart, not be out of sight of each other and not allowing anyone to touch them other than each other,” Narcissa explained to the group. “It will eventually work but will cause serious problems with bringing them out in public.”
“No!” Draco replied emphatically.
“Mr. Potter you’re next,” Madame Pomfrey called to him and he took his turn behind the curtain.
“No nothing,” Draco responded.

“How can you be certain?” McDaniels asked.
“I was supposed to take Draco’s statement in the morning with his appearance the following day. Justice Harrington has agreed to combine his statement and hearing into one private session day after next, so we have one day to figure out how we are going to handle this. What possible reason can we have for Harry to be tagging along for this entire process especially since private hearings only include written statements from witnesses and not in person testimony.”
As he walked towards his tent he noticed a few people standing outside of a tent about 50 yards from his own tent. It was clearly one of the Inspectors with their royal blue robes. A younger woman with a dark complexion and jet-black hair. The other had his back to Harry. He had on jeans and a sweater. As Harry got closer he could now make out Draco’s distinctive blonde hair. Harry had been thrown by the Muggle clothing at first, Draco had never worn Muggle clothing before. He actually looked good in it. Harry fought the urge to continue past his own tent and go over to him remembering Barnes reasoning for keeping them apart. He did not want to do anything that might cause problems for Draco at his hearing. Instead, he slipped into his own tent feeling better knowing Draco was ok and so close to him.
“I need information and answers. We are in a very difficult time immediately after Voldermort’s fall from power and death. I now have the most revered person in the wizarding world bonded to the son of one of the most prolific Death Eaters by an ancient magic known to very few people. As you can imagine trying to accommodate this bond without punishing Harry or seeming to give preferential treatment to Draco is going to be nearly impossible. So, I need as much information as I can. Narcissa, what more can you tell me?” Barnes asked, showing for the first time, tension in his normally calm demeanor.
“That’s simple, the Boy Who Lived wanted to only give his testimony in person. He just defeated the most feared wizard in the world. A request like that wouldn’t raise many eyebrows. It’s keeping them away from everyone coming and going from the ministry. Being seen arriving and leaving together will be hard to explain away,” Narcissa replied. Barnes smiled. This woman was quick on her feet and crafty.
“Madame Pomfrey why don’t you take Draco to the exam area for his check,” Narcissa interjected sensing the tension and anxiety in the group. “Harry why don’t you and I talk while Draco is examined.”
“Wait, what do you mean this bad before,” Hermione interrupted.
Hopefully, I can get the next chapter up soon but with the holidays I am not sure.
“That would be lovely, thank you, inspector,” Mrs. Weasley replied. She turned to Ginny. “We best be going and find your father. There is a lot of work to be done getting this place right.”
“Can I have books?’ Draco asked lenitively. He was clearly being treated special and did not want to push things but he knew that if he had hours of free time he would need something to do or he would go crazy.
“Sir? I don’t have any clothes or other necessities,” Malfoy said with a questioning look.
“Now then, I think it best if we start from the beginning and you tell me everything you can recall since coming to Hogwarts and your first encounter with Voldermort. Oh and to record all of this I’ll be using a Steno-Quill,” Harry and Hermione nodded and began to tell their tale. Harry let Hermione take the lead since she was more thorough and exacting at such things. Harry jumped in occasionally to correct a small detail or to pick up the story at a point that Hermione had not been a part of like Ron and his’ adventure in the tunnel to the Chamber of Secrets with Lockhart or the events within the chamber itself.
“My little dragon,” she whispered to him as she hugged him close. “I’m not upset, I asked you because I know you would know for certain if there was a bond,” She continued comforting Draco.
“I understand how important this is to Potter, but I doubt it will be safe for me to be in a room of my former enemies, especially when they are mourning one of their own,” Draco continued. Harry could feel his anger start to rise in him at Draco’s words and flat tone. Then Draco turned to him and he could see the fear in his grey eyes and the anger dampened but was replaced with a nagging anxiety about what both were going to have to give up because of this bond.
Harry had moved his chair closer to Draco and had also held his hand under the table to try and comfort him, but with each toss of her hair or coy smile in Harry’s direction, his anger flared anew.
“It’s very well known in academic circles that the Black family are the guardians of a secret horde of knowledge on bonding,” she continued. “If this is true then Narcissa could be invaluable in this matter.”
“That was the complete opposite of how I grew up,” Harry began, sounding unsure if he wanted to reveal this about himself. Draco knitted his brows, confused but stayed quiet, letting Harry compose himself. Finally, he sighed and smiled at Draco. “I suppose it’s best to start with a clean slate. No secrets or misunderstandings.”
“Inspector Barnes, I hate to interrupt but I feel that we should notify Mr. Malfoy’s parents of this development. They are in the detainee camp, aren’t they?” McGonagall asked fixing Barnes with a look that didn’t leave room for argument.
“How soon can you find out for certain if that’s the case,” Barnes asked.
“What is it, Molly?” Pomfrey pushed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I was left with my Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon the night that my parents were killed. Aunt Petunia was mom’s sister. What I didn’t know until much later was that she was very jealous of my mom that she was a witch. Uncle Vernon thought the same. They had a son of their own, Dudley. They felt he could do no wrong. When I was young, they would just ignore me for the most part. I was never held or hugged. I never had a birthday party, and I never received gifts on Christmas or other holidays.”
“I don’t think it should be at the expense of seeing his, for lack of a better word, family. Especially since Draco has had you here this whole time.”
“I get your point, but I think it would be best to allow this one visit. We’ll consult before any further visits.”
“I know, but we need to allow the bond to complete. Boys, come over here please,” she gestured to each boy. They both approached after a moment’s hesitation. Each still unsure of this. Once they were both close enough to her she placed a hand on each of their shoulders. “Now to complete this you just need to make physical contact with each other. A handshake should do and shouldn’t be too difficult.” She removed her hand and stepped back as they raised their hands. It seemed like an eternity, Harry looked deep into Draco’s grey eyes. Gone was the hard, cold detachment of years past. Now a softer more vulnerable pair of grey eyes looked back at him. With one final beat, Harry grasped Draco’s outstretched hand.
Remus and Sirius would love the unplanned intrusion” Hermione said, still snappish.
Hermione stopped having to listen to all of Harry’s long speculative rants about how evil Vance was sure to be after that. When Harry raised his hands in lessons for the rest of the year it was only ever to ask a genuine question.
“Wonder who we’ll get next year.” Ginny said with a sigh, “No one as good as you or Lupin.”
Draco made mocking noises which only served to further prove that he was a ginormous child. “It’s nothing I wouldn’t say to a friend”
With clear sight lines the group woefully commiserated their mutual loss through exaggerated gagging gestures and eye rolls. The Slytherins celebrated obnoxiously all night.
Ron looked at him thoughtfully, bubbles of happiness and love crowding in his stomach. He decided to let it go, turning to cheer along with everyone else as Cedric was greeted by a Swedish Short-Snout.
“I kn
“Well there’s no point in the rest of you worrying.” Mum said with bluster, “Off to bed. You all need your rest.”
“Well is he ok? I was worried how he would be treated by other Death Eater after helping me in the courtyard,” Barnes smiled a little bigger at this.
“What is going on with him Edmund?” Madame Pomfrey asked once they were outside the room.
“So, what now?” Harry asked once they were alone.
“And that’s relevant because?” McDaniels asked sounding irritated.
“That was exhausting. We should head back to the tent and get something to eat,” Hermione said looking at Harry who seemed to have spaced out. ”Harry?”
“Can you really help us understand what’s happening?” Harry asked ignoring the thanks. He had only done what was right and didn’t want any more praise. His mind had been a swirl of emotion and thoughts. He knew that he liked both men and women but had never given any thought to Malfoy as a potential love interest. His opinion of him had drastically changed over the last year and he did want to get to know Malfoy better, but this much?”
“That will work fine thank you,” Draco responded quietly and took the package to his corner of the tent.
“Get comfortable Mr. Malfoy,” Wilcox motioned to the nook with the bed and chair. “You’ll be here for a while.”
“Thank you, Headmistress,” Draco said as he squeezed Harry’s hand again. Harry also thanked her and squeezed back.
“Inspector Barnes said he would be coming by to get us once he was ready to get our story,” Hermione said as she placed a plate in front of Harry. He wasn’t hungry but tied to force some of it down since Hermione had taken the time to cook for him.
“Ok, then how would the bond initiation be completed?” Barnes asked.
“What are you playing at?” she hissed at him taking a step forward her wand never wavering from him.
“Here you are,” she said, arms outstretched. “This has several changes of clothes and some toiletries. Unfortunately, we were only able to acquire muggle clothing.” Her tone clipped and to the point.
“I didn’t ask for or cause this to happen; it just did. I don’t want to take him away from any of you, and I would never ask him not to see you, but I’m not going anywhere, so we are going to have to learn to tolerate each other,” Draco replied. The others were surprised by his statement expecting his usual snark, rubbing it in that Harry was his.
“Are you going to be here for this?” Draco asked.
“Let’s get this going then. I need to know how far we can keep them, so I can begin to get Draco’s testimony. Plus, the Weasley’s and Ms. Granger have been pestering me to allow them to see Harry, so I am allowing a visit after dinner tonight.”
“That’s just idiotic,” McGonagall said sternly. “She has nothing to gain by leading us astray or for that matter harming Harry.”
“And what about me?” Draco finally spoke since back in the hospital wing. Everyone turned to looked at him.
“Harry, I’ve always considered you to be one of my own and that will never change. I can’t say that I agree with this decision, but I will support you, especially since things are going to get difficult with this bond.” With that, she turned and walked out of the office with Arthur following close behind. The room again was overtaken by awkward silence.
“How dare you speak to my daughter that way! The only you aren’t rotting in a ramshackle dorm is because your Death Eater son has managed to latch onto Harry. You need to learn your place!” Molly’s face was red as she pointed at Narcissa, who had turned and listened to her tirade impassively, which seemed to irritate Molly further.
Harry's head snapped up. He couldn't believe what he had just heard from Draco. An apology? It blew Harry's mind. How had Draco changed so much in such a short period of time? Harry realized that he had not responded when he felt Draco’s eye on him.
“Harry there is nothing to worry about. As yours and Draco’s relationship grows, you’ll become more comfortable and eventually you both will know it’s the right time to become intimate.” Harry nodded not feeling especially calmed by this but knowing he had no choice but to deal with this.
“Unfortunately, Inspector Barnes, I’m not going to be able to provide you with much. Yes, this is a spontaneous soul bonding of their magical signatures. It was only partially initiated because of the stress of the battle and was completed in front of you just moments ago. Beyond that I can only give generalities. Every bond is unique especially these types. They follow some similar patterns like allowing the bonded parties to have a greater distance between them and for longer periods than the external magically induced bonds but how far and how long varies greatly. We simply have to carefully test it in a controlled environment,” Narcissa explained in her matter of fact tone.
“Can they safely stay as a partially initiated bond for say several days?”
Dinner passed without any major incidents and afterward, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley returned to their tent, while Ron helped Hermione clean up. They had not had any alone time since the battle and with their relationship no longer a secret they needed some time to themselves to process what had happened and begin healing. Harry had ended up next to Ginny on the couch again with her holding his hand, her thumb stroking his. He was trying to be affectionate but he was struggling. It was like there was this inner force telling him no, separate, get away. He figured it was just his emotions still running high.
“Something wrong Professor?” Harry questioned seeing the look on his face.
“Ending a magically induced bond and a spontaneous bond are two very different things, Ms. Weasley. Magically induced bonds only superficially attach magical signatures. Spontaneous bonds actually entwine the signatures, merging pieces of each person’s signature with the other. Breaking that bond leaves permanent damage to both magical signatures and, in turn, to each person. Perhaps you should understand what you are speaking about before tossing out such things with impunity.” Narcissa turned to return to her seat when Mrs. Weasley was on her feet.
“The first order of business is to do a basic magical exam of you both. I’m going to do this daily to track any changes,” Pomfrey said speaking again. “Now did anything happen during the night that we should know about?”
Draco blanched seeing the glint in Molly’s eye. He had been afraid something like this would happen. This would be turned around on him. Suddenly McGonagall reached up and grabbed Molly’s shoulder and turning her around.
Harry and Draco looked at each other. They felt like animals being studied in a lab. Harry knew they had to be cautious and that he and Draco’s situation was very different than normal, but he still hated being the odd ball. Why couldn’t he just be normal.
“Well, ah… we actually did not think of that…”
Once inside Harry smelled the delicious aroma of cooking food filling the tent and as he looked up he saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Ron, and Ginny all seated in chairs around the tent talking with Hermione. They looked up when he came in.
Inspector Barnes and Professor McGonagall arrived shortly after to get an update on Harry and Draco. Madame Pomfrey declared both boys in good health and had them head over to a table on the other side of the room with a list of activities laid out for them to get to know one another.
Once Harry finished telling him about Hagrid coming to find him and the lengths his aunt and uncle had gone to keep him from going to Hogwarts, Draco then picked up the storytelling and began giving more details of his childhood allowing himself to open up for the first time and detail some of the not so nice things of his past like a controlling and overbearing father.
“I believe that is up to Mr. Malfoy. He is of age now so alerting his parents is his discretion.” They all turned to Draco for his response.
“You know exactly what I’m talking about. Slightly off readings? Did you do something to throw off her readings so you could stay here longer?”
“Mrs. Malfoy, do you know what is going on?” Harry asked hesitantly.
Up to this point, Draco had been trying to avoid being noticed and was looking at the ground. At hearing the last statement and feeling all eyes turn to him he looked up but not quite enough to look Inspector Barnes in the eye.
“Yes, a little, thanks,” Draco responded. He noticed Ramirez was seated in a chair reading. She had not looked up or acknowledged Draco since handing him his clothing.
“Thanks, Hermione. I know we need to relay everything as soon as possible to not forget anything but you’d think they could give us a little time to get ourselves together.”
“Let’s go boys.”
“Molly, I know you are upset but there is no reason to be throwing out baseless accusations,” McGonagall stepped into the conversation now. She had been just as shocked as everyone but had regained her composure.
“Excellent, let me know as soon as that’s arranged,” Barnes said seeming to relax a bit with the new plan coming together. “Next we need to figure out what we are going to do after the hearing. At this point, based on all the information and testimony we have, Justice Harrington is going to offer Draco a deal. A fine, house arrest for three months, and participation in IMF diversity training regarding muggles and muggle born wizards.”
“As soon as Poppy gets here, we’ll explain.  Seems we found Annaleise Dumbledore’s other parent but he’s sick.”
Harry had just finished folding the letter as he heard to common room portrait open.  He started to smile, thinking Draco and Hermione may have gotten out of Runes early.  The smile left; however, when he noticed Lavender Brown approaching him.  She sat next to him on the couch and he rolled his eyes as she turned to him.
“Alright.  You and your mother are correct, Draco.  If you don’t want a wife, I will come to terms with that.”
“Let me and Remus cook, aye.”
Harry just walked past everyone, heading to his room.  He actually didn’t know how he was able to make the man disappear and didn’t want to explain what he didn’t know.  He waited about five minutes, sitting on the bed, when Draco walked in with two Gryffindors and two Slytherins.  No one said anything, just waited for Harry to say something, anything.  When Harry didn’t comment on anything, the others decided to just ask about Poppy and what she said to them this morning.  Now that they were alone in the room, their friends could be filled in on what happened the night before and this morning.  Harry was quite grateful they decided to ignore what happened.  All he remembered is that he wished the man was gone and then poof.
“Me too.”  three other people stated as Narcissa decided it was time to change the subject, letting them talk and joke about other things, thoughts of the Weasley’s slowly leaving their minds.
Draco watched as Harry’s eyes got big and he tucked the books close to him, protecting them.  The blonde could see that whatever was going on, Harry didn’t want Lucius to know.  He also looked at his father to see the man calculating on how to get what he wanted and decided to intervene.
Harry nodded.  “Yes, I will tell you later.  What’s wrong with Pansy?”
“Oh I know, I’ve been having the same one.  It’s why Draco and I were coming.”
