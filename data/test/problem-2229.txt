They both nodded grudgingly, and Draco stomped to the door, slamming it behind him. Harry bit his lip keeping his silence, then stalked back toward his office, the look on his face scaring newer people out of his path.
“Love? We were barely old enough to shave! You shagged him…fine…you liked him…fine…but don’t call it love! He wasn’t capable of love! Don’t even dishonor what other people have by comparing him to it. Love is sticking with someone through war, five kids, three jobs and nearly twenty years! You fucking Malfoy’s lily-white arse wasn’t love, or he’d still be with you! You’ve carried a torch for him so long you’re delusional! And let’s not confuse the issue…I’ve nothing against you left-footing it! I’ve wished for years that you’d take up with someone decent and have a good life together, and I don’t give a good damn if they’re a bloke or not, but Malfoy was bad news from day one, and so is his sneaky little spawn!”
Harry looked mortified. “Are you crazy? I forbid you to take this feeling away from me. I wish this would last forever. My knees are weak, the entire lower half of my body is tingling, and I feel more completely alive than I ever have before today. I want to feel this…feel you…as long as possible. If that means a little soreness…then so bloody what?”
He’d hidden it from the world, avoiding the entire subject and everything related to it. It was muddled amongst the many secrets, where no one could find it and force that truth upon him. The silence regarding his sexuality, the clandestine nature of his time with Draco, the killings after the death of Draco and Claire. It all muddied the waters around a truth he’d skirted the edge of for nearly two decades.
Draco put his face in his palm. "Gods, yes...I'm over that, too. What do I have to sign before I get a mouth on my penis? It's been three weeks, Potter! I want this, with you, and I want to do something we've never done before. Is that not enough? I know we don't always, you know, get along...but I'm pretty sure we can manage this without a fight, can't we?"
His back to the Aurors, Draco mouthed the plea he didn’t dare voice in front of others. His lips silently worked to shape the words ’Please…I need you.’ Harry grabbed a coat off the back of a chair and conjured his keys and wand into his hands.
“We’ll see about that, won’t we? Until then, I’m asking this of you, as a teacher, and as a mate. Give the boy the benefit of the doubt. Not for Draco, not for me, but for him. He’s his own person, and he deserves the same chance Dumbledore would have given any of us. Try being decent to him and see how that works, or if you can’t do anything else, at least try to keep that look off your face when you see him. You make me think of Snape and me twenty years ago. It isn’t right and you know it.”
Lean, dark and menacingly slow, a black snake with unusual markings in red and green, some five feet long, slithered silently toward the bathtub…and toward Draco Malfoy, who was rinsing his hair out, completely oblivious to the danger approaching him quickly.
The prison doctor gives away lubricant. Nothing good, just the cheapest brand of greasy petroleum jelly. The stuff that lingers and leaves you feeling like the cheap, dirty whore you are. Not because they approve, or care, or want me to enjoy the experience. It’s about economics. It’s less expensive to give away the stuff than it is to stitch up the torn asses of every queen in the prison every month. Aside from that, I need very little, and I ask for very little. Flint likes that.
“You know me…I always land on my feet. I was fresh out of the joint when I picked a nice daddy. The rich kind. Too old to get it up, but he loves to keep me around. I already have the easy life. What I don’t have is you. Got a phone number? I can come and go as I please, and if I wanted to get a little something Daddy can’t provide, I could swing by your place sometime and make you remember what you’ve been missing.”
How Draco wanted to savage that mouth with a kiss, or fold his arms around those slender shoulders that carried so much weight, and just hold someone he genuinely desired close to himself. He wanted to witness that beautiful face afire with orgasm, or gazing back at him fondly. He hungered to feel that body shudder with genuine pleasure...not pain or relief from some ailment of the spirit that warped everything and everyone into a torment. He couldn't voice it, but at least at a distance he could think it.
"YOU HAVE A SET OF...!!!" Hermione's outraged voice rang through the old church before Draco's upraised hand momentarily silenced her.
“Maria is bringing some orange juice. You worried me for a minute there. Your pulse is a little high, but I don’t think you have a fever. I’m just guessing, but this last few days must have been a little stressful for you, right? Unanswered questions, too many assumptions, incomplete information and too much of a change of pace for such a short time. You need to relax…not that I can blame you for being a little high-strung.”
He’s quiet for a minute, then he snorts. “What’s to tell? He’s that good. I’m pretty sure Hell wouldn’t take him…’cause he’d take over as soon as he got there. He’ll be back. He always comes back. Trust me on that.”
Too many heavy thoughts. Too sobering for an early morning. He still didn’t have apologies written for anyone. He hoped that Prewett would be reasonable about the timing. It might take awhile to work out something that would be acceptable without being utterly humiliating.
“Potter! Don’t be gauche. At least get your wand and clean up after yourself. I’m sure the other Prefects have no desire to traipse through your leftover spunk.”
Many companies and consortiums buy up water rights, usually in places where people have so much water that they don’t realize what might happen when it finally starts running short. They pump the water out of the ground, bottle it, ship it all over the country and make a mint doing it, but they don’t pay for new local wells when the old ones can’t draw deep enough anymore. Like usual, the little guy gets screwed, and the big guy walks away laughing. Dumbledore just happens to be a bigger guy than the water speculators, and if they got wind of the screwing they were going to get, they’d use every trick in the book to stop him.
The other possible origin was Zabini’s mother. She was reputed to be a witch of stunning beauty and power, whose seven previous husbands had all died under questionable circumstances, leaving her their fortunes each time. It was even possible that a fusion of these two possibilities was the answer. Perhaps Zabini acquired the snake from his mother in an effort to eliminate Malfoy on Voldemort’s orders?
When he comes in he has a mask and latex gloves on, and he already has a cart full of equipment waiting beside this table, so I guess it’s about to happen. I get swabbed with cold medical gel that disinfects and makes sure the skin surrounding the scar is pretty much sterile, then patted dry. I feel the small pinpricks of a needle, handled so carefully that I barely notice it. He’s careful and precise, and each step is done with the same cold and clinical air that he showed earlier.
‘SHIT! When did the ice cream distraction stop working? Damn! Not happening, not happening, not happening!’
Harry drifted over to Nott again, watching the tears and snot dripping down Theo’s face while he swung upside down. Zabini was tougher than Harry had guessed, but Theo might be the weak link here. Harry decided to push the last button. He pulled a long knife from his pocket and drifted up to the rope at Theo Nott’s ankles.
Sunlight doesn’t reach in here. The faint blue of the digital clock beside the bed is the only real light. Dawn is coming. The world is waking, but we haven’t yet slept. I’m on my side, in front of him, with his flagging cock buried inside of me while we gently grind against one another, too weak to push any harder than this. Utterly spent. This is how we drift to sleep…fused as one…locked together, his arms holding me close, speared upon the wealth of his desire for me, writhing faintly even as consciousness slips away. Bruised by ardor out of control, still full with him inside of me, whispering words of love…content at last.
Harry stepped out of the room as Ron dashed in, muttering a rather insincere apology for occupying their dorm room’s toilet. Ron hurried in, still half dancing in his pajamas, fighting the rising urge to pee until he reached the toilet. Once the door was shut, Ron unleashed his bladder and shouted over his shoulder.
Well…color me fucking stunned. Declarations of admiration and loyalty were not expected. It’s easy to imagine them not giving a second thought to what happened to me, since I was never really ‘one of the boys’. I was Blaise’s boy-toy, and that bought me a certain place in this little clique, but I never even considered the possibility of Greg or Vinny caring about where I wound up.
“Harry. I talked to Snape. He made the potions for me after he…after I talked to him about some things. I’m just tired, Harry. I don’t want to go out there yet. Don’t you get it? Look at me. Think about how we’re talking right now. Do I seem like my usual self? At all? Well, do I?”
“I’ll give you a minute to see for yourself, but anywhere you move, you drop into a position where I can take your King. Fafnir’s Gambit. I started it nine moves ago.”
Harry drifted to sleep with Draco in his arms, wonderfully aware of the closeness and warmth that came of being curled around the one he loved more than anything in the world. Whatever may have been in the ‘plan’, this night was still a miracle to him, and he wouldn’t have changed it, even if he could.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Yes...I'm over that, too. I totally get it, Potter. I left you high and dry...you got even. It's over...lets get back to having some fun...starting with me, since I'm the one who suffered the greatest level of indignity."
I came from heaven, where the angels sipped champagne and worried over brand names. It was a long way to fall…but I’m learning to stretch those wings again, and I’m not even scared of how high I might fly.
What was I supposed to do? My life is over. I feel numb, and Snape jerks my arm harder, pulling me along after him. My feet move, but my heart is dead. The halls are just a blur to me.
“Stop looking like that, and never presume that others are stupid. Your diet has been crap. The words ‘seven years’ came up half a dozen times while I was questioning you, you admitted to using illegal drugs, and to an unusual amount of sexual activity for a non monogamous relationship with one primary participant beside yourself. I also know where Harry has been this last month. Pardon me if I draw my own conclusions…they’re generally right. Here’s a piece of advice, boy. It happened. Get over it. That was there…this is here and now. You fucked up monumentally, but you don’t have to do anything that foolish twice. The definition of insanity is expecting different results from the same actions, despite seeing the evidence with your own eyes.
Drug companies flog their latest cure-all for every problem you can have. In the background, bright, clear and sunny skies frame women and men who are fit and healthy, smiling ear to ear because the legal dope they’ve been prescribed has taken away all that unfair stress they were suffering. Because, obviously, life should never produce any kind of stress, and no one should ever learn better coping skills when for thirty dollars a pill they can just knock back instant comfort. It's not that people with sever conditions shouldn't get treatment...its that it looks from here like the bar for 'serious' has been lowered until anyone suffering even mild annoyance merits medical intervention. I know what the ugly end of that dependence on chemistry for comfort looks like...and I can't find it pretty or irrelevant anymore.
“Good night? Didn’t expect you to be such a sourpuss today…seein’ as you got your groove on the minute the rest of us were outta sight. Figured you’d be all smiles.”
“I know, Potter…and that’s the part that makes me long all the harder. Perhaps it isn’t fair, but its justice, isn’t it? I shouldn’t be believed. I wouldn’t believe me if another with my record came to me with such a thing. I’d tell them they were a fool or a liar, tell them I couldn’t possibly trust them. What could a person do…to prove their worth after doing so many things wrong? It’s pointless, hopeless even…but I can’t control what I feel anymore. I don’t care about my reputation. To hell with my position or my pride. They’re worthless…compared to being able to hold someone real, someone worth any sacrifice to protect and love.”
The man had done it. It was certain. No one so overwrought could speak a complete falsehood so convincingly. It had to be true. He’d avenged the Malfoys, and had committed murder to do it. Harry Potter was a cold blooded killer, and was terrifying to behold in his wrath. Was that enraged face what Lord Voldemort had seen on his last day of life? Was that chilling look the one his parent’s killers had seen last?
Harry peeled away the rest of his clothes and piled them on the bench alongside his Cloak and shirt. He entered the edge of the bath closest to the bench, just in case he needed to gather his things and leave quickly.
“Well…uh…there was something we both wanted to say. It’s…it’s just…uh. Shit. See…no one figured you for going to the mattresses and staying quiet. I mean…you weren’t really a part of the family, if you know what I mean. We all thought Blaise was crazy when he sent you, ‘cause we didn’t expect you to cover for anybody else.
The result was what mattered. The position wasn’t particularly comfortable, and made blood rush to Draco’s face in a heated flush more intense than the one he’d felt for almost an hour now, but the head of Harry’s prick pressed against the same place with unerring accuracy now. Every carefully controlled thrust against that bundle of nerves within made Draco’s cock leap and twitch in return while his hands clenched tight, wound into the sheets while cords of muscles stood out in stark relief.
“Yes, sir. I…I hope I haven’t been the cause of too much concern. I’m very grateful for the chance to be here, with Harry, tonight. It’s an honor to meet a real, live hero in person…much less enjoy a banquet in your home.”
“Go…go ‘way! Leave me…’lone.” Another string of bile erupted from Draco’s mouth, splashing onto the tiles of the floor.
“Oh…I’ll just forgive your insolence…for a price. If you complete the deal, you’ll have your reward…but I mean to see it done. Go back to him. Destroy him utterly. Make him certain that he’s been exploited and thrown aside…and when his suffering is the talk of the town…you’ll have won the right to me. Nothing less, nothing more. Seduce…and destroy. That was the bargain.”
Draco spat his answer out, chin up defiantly. “Apologize? Hah! The weak deserve what they get! I’ll apologize when you prove you can cast all those spells you claim you know! I want to duel you! I challenge you.”
Their last year at Hogwarts came to its close, and that was the end of happy memories for a time. The war did break out almost immediately after the closing of Hogwarts, and attacks began on Muggle and wizarding targets alike.
There is a den full of shelves with books by the ton. There’s a study with a music system that shames the one I had at home when I was sixteen. Classical music, jazz, swing, big band, blues. CD after CD of it. There’s a computer that looks ready to go and better than the one I grew up with. The funny part is that, with a building to explore and a world just outside of it that I haven’t seen in the better part of this decade…I just want to go to bed.
Third year was when everything really happened. It was his last year at Hogwarts, and I think he pulled out all the stops. He’d done everything, with everyone he’d wanted, for a long time before I became an issue, so I guess he was looking for a new thrill. I was it.
The flat was dark and quiet except for the flicker of the telly, the volume of which had been turned entirely off. Potter was breathing softly on the couch, bare except for a ratty pair of boxers. Draco had steeled himself for these last few nights on the way home. It would take every effort to conceal his thoughts and feelings. He didn't dare come any closer while these thoughts were still in his head. The realization that any selflessness on his part...could only hope to be rewarded by abandonment. Was that what redemption was about? Just a final blow to the ego to smash it all to kindling? Some last acknowledgment that, yes, you'd done something worth the doing of, and your payment was to live with knowing you'd get less than nothing in return?
After that, wanking and such became passé, and in the future, they moved from snogging and groping almost directly to exchanging blowjobs, which made their brief encounters between classes oh so much more satisfying, as well as slightly shorter.
I’ve been in a lot planes, but they were private jets and international flights with Father and Mother. Four seat, two prop Piper seaplanes weren’t any part of my experience. Harry looks thrilled, throwing our luggage into the space behind the seats. We didn’t pack much, since it’s only a couple days that we’ll be gone, but it looks awfully small in there. Ron has already gassed the thing up, and keeps running small checks on instruments and other things. It looks like this kind of plane takes an awful lot of checking…or maybe I’ve just never seen this stuff done before. At least the big goof looks competent and comfortable.
That episode had ended in Ron slinking off, vaguely confused, and keeping to himself for a few days, which had been fine by Harry, who really wasn’t feeling very forgiving at the moment. Perhaps he was a little overprotective of Draco, but he was the only person in Hogwarts, aside from Snape, who knew the things that made Draco tick, and he jealously guarded the knowledge that had been entrusted to him.
It was a nondescript little thing, but the wax seal was elegant and tasteful, and the penmanship on his name was skillful. Upon opening it, Harry felt his heart leap. The brief message within could only have come from one person, and it was worded with great politeness…a compliment in itself when he thought about it.
Pain was nothing to be afraid of. The instructors’ whips and switches at Durmstrang had hurt far worse than this. Pain could be endured, failure…that was unacceptable. If he could accomplish nothing else, Draco could make some small amends for what he’d caused.
Draco, Lord Malfoy, looked out the frost rimed window of Malfoy Manor with pleasure. You could see the Quidditch pitch that had been set up years ago from this vantage, and from here it was clear that several people flew above it in an impromptu match. Harry was still the very devil himself on a broom, and Ron Weasley, great ape that the man might be, was no slouch, either. Draco's own son, as well as several of the young Weasleys, also alternately bobbed and soared above the pitch. Draco himself had retired from the match early, chilled to the bone and more in the mood for a brandy before dinner.
“I love him. I want him to remember this forever. Nothing else is good enough for him. I’ll do anything to make him happy, even telling you things are that only his business and mine.” Draco’s eyes were faintly wet when he looked up, and they held an accusing anger that was aimed at the person who had just forced him to share more than he had wanted to.
“Needn’t worry for my opinion of you, though it might be awhile before we meet again. It’s a useful thing, being able to seemingly change genders before the eyes of others. As a matter of fact, during the War, when I was attempting to slip out of Germany without drawing undue attention, I crossed a river by night, and having drenched my clothes while hurrying to avoid a patrol, I made use of some clothing that I found drying on a line nearby. The tragedy is that I apparently made a rather homely maiden. I must have passed a dozen soldiers and failed to generate as much as a whistle of interest. Quite a bruise to my ego.”
“Alright. No standing on ceremony. Next time I’m in this part of the world, I’ll bring my real wardrobe, but I might as well warn you…by then…we might need another plane to haul it!”
“You know, Tonksy, if it’s any comfort at all, it ain’t any better on my side of the fence. Deirdre has been waiting ‘til I get home to give me an earful of what she thinks about all this, and lemme tell ya, it hasn’t been an earful of poetry! We’ll get through this yet. We’re two of the best in our field, and you know what? If worst comes to worst, maybe we get bumped back down the ladder and our rep takes a hit. Maybe they take us off this and put someone else in the hot seat, but we’ll go down fighting. Are you with me?”
“Well…sod it…I can’t very well leave with a student missing, even that one, can I? Tell ya what…if we can’t find him before I’m supposed to Floo home…well…break out the map.”
“When we get to the dining hall, don’t stand on formality too much. All we do is go to the head table and stand at either side of his chair, which is in the center. The long tables are for the staff that choose to or have to live here, and he usually dines with them. I know it isn’t normal, but trust me, Sir Albus is not normal.”
All in all, it turned out pretty well. He slipped his mouth around Draco's dick and moved back and forth along it, and even though he didn't have any idea what would constitute a 'technique' he still seemed to be making Draco pretty happy. Draco was scrupulously clean and his body smelled of expensive soaps and grooming products, which made the entire business of being nose deep in another boy's groin fairly pleasant. Draco was moaning and mumbling like it was the best thing that ever happened to him, and Harry got enough confidence to actually try things with his tongue that just seemed like they might be good ideas.
The older of the two Aurors cleared his throat and raised a hand for patience. “Needn’t worry for your child. She’s already being transferred to the London office as soon as the paperwork in Belgrade is cleared. We were notified last night that Ms. Parkinson had passed away, and our initial attempts to contact you failed. This morning we activated a few devices at the office and pinpointed your location so that we could expedite this matter. It wouldn’t do to leave your child unsupervised, and so she has been attended to by a representative from the Ministry since last night. She’ll be in London in an hour. All the more reason to please join us at the Ministry and help us clear this up as quickly as possible. I’m sure with Mr. Potter’s statements about your whereabouts, we can lay this to rest very shortly. Shall we then?”
If I play it carefully enough, I might just leave here with only one scar. The one where a modified piece of wire was heated to white-hot and pressed into my lower back, just above my ass. The wire was shaped like the letter ‘F’. Flint’s brand, marking me as his, just to remind me in case I forgot. It only happened because I’d gotten just saucy enough to act demanding about something, and I’d picked the wrong day. He decided to make a big show of reminding me whose grace I lived by, and I didn’t forget again.
“Well…you see…as near as we can tell…the report from Belgrade indicates that…well…she was crushed to death.”
I have to hurry beside him. At least I’m not trying to keep up in heels! I love a tall man with strong legs, but keeping up with one when he’s in a hurry is a bitch. He looks more boyish than ever, grinning from ear to ear as we walk down hallway after hallway and up staircases lined with red carpet. The portraits in here are probably worth a fortune on the open market. There’s enough of them to open a damn gallery right here. Amazing.
A little about how it came to this. There are very few ‘guilty’ people in prison. So many people who were ‘misunderstood’, ‘framed’, or just wrongly imprisoned. Honestly, there are problems with the criminal justice system, but the odds of ninety percent of prisoners being innocent are pretty fucking slim. At least Flint is proud of his crimes, and even if he belongs here, his honesty is occasionally refreshing. I could say I was framed. I could say the judge was unfair, or that my state appointed lawyer was a moron and misrepresented me, and those things might be true…mostly, but at the end of the day, I was caught in an airport with a bag full of cocaine in my luggage. And not just a little for personal use. Lots of it. I did what I was told. I kept my mouth shut and waited for Blaise to send a lawyer and bail me out. No one came.
Harry's breath was like a bellows, and his eyes shone with an intensity that was born of the near desperation to prove his love... by making Draco come one last time before Harry relented. In the hazy fog of his mind, Draco could feel Harry nearing another climax and moved his body subtly in preparation. He was always excited by the sense of his lover's pleasure in him, and he often let that excitement bring him to the edge of orgasm, sometimes even simultaneously with Harry. Any attempt at controlling himself was pointless when Harry shifted slightly and drove deeply into him, leaving him screaming and shuddering while he went over the top... followed a few seconds later by Harry's final, savage thrusts, before the hot jettings of Harry's loins filled him for the final time.
Draco Malfoy was staring at the image of his father, whose gaze had fallen to Harry, smiling affectionately and speaking words that Harry could feel more than hear. So like the dreams he’d lived with, so clear compared to misty memories. A healthy handsome young man, dressed sharply and confident in his stance, lean and tall and full of life. Until Harry’s gaze flickered just a few inches to one side as he stepped forward, silent and almost entranced.
“Even while planning serious ‘business matters’? That’s sooo cute. You wouldn’t believe how sweet he is! Like an angel…but with brilliant abs and great biceps. And his butt’s pretty amazing too!” Hah! Made her blush with that one. “If you want, the paintings are straight down the hall to the end. Last room. Except the one I did of Harry. That’s in the den. He hung it up yesterday.”
“Once upon a time, I dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was myself. Soon I awaked, and there I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man.”
Harry walked the required paces before the door of the Room, and when the door shimmered into reality, he stepped inside and stopped right where he was, smiling wide and just looking with quiet appreciation.
“Minerva! That’s…that’s barbaric! Outrageous! Do you mean that those marks on his record, dozens of them, all signify beatings? It’s unconscionable! The Ministry shouldn’t be investigating him, they should be looking into what kind of maniacs would inflict something like that on a gifted child!”
He’s silent, chewing his sandwich and sipping bottled water to clear his palate. I wait until I almost want to speak again. I wish he wasn’t wearing sunglasses. If I could see his eyes, I could guess at what he must be thinking. Maybe I sound needy. It’s because I am. I want to know. I want to believe in something, and I just can’t let go so easy. When the answer comes, it’s deadpan, voiced as if he knew it all along and wanted the timing to be right. Everything I know about the world dies a beautiful death and is born again in the ashes of his words.
“Malfoy! Get out of my office! I’ve got work to do!” Harry was livid, skin looking red beneath his natural tan, eyes dangerously bright, and his wand hand was hovering near his hip.
“Bloody hell, Harry! I got in at two…and you two were still having it off! Don’t tell me you bastards never heard of a Silence spell! I mean, Merlin’s Fucking Beard, mate…SIX HOURS?! What the fuck is wrong with you two? Can’t you do anything normal? If it takes that long to get off, you’re doing something wrong!”
Obviously, being good at wandless magic is probably all that's kept him alive. Anyone else who lived like he did and pursued as many unsafe sexual encounters would have been diseased to a fare thee well by now, but if he'd caught anything he almost certainly cured it before it took root. Believe me, Granger...I do check for things like that before I take a a new 'toy'.
“Heh. I suppose everyone here probably knows more about my past than I like, but at least it means I haven’t anything to hide.” I get a few grins with that one. That and the warmth of vodka gives me a little more courage.
“Of course…and thanks…for everything else. There are still some things I’d like to talk to you about. They need to be said, worked out, given thought to…not buried away waiting to hamstring me later. I’ve got a few days before I actually start teaching…and we can make use of them while I’ve got the chance. See you tonight.”
“How does an early dismissal from class sound to everyone? For our next class, I want each of you to write up everything that you saw cast today, as well as an analysis of the entire duel. No less than fifteen inches of parchment, since I can personally vouch that that would be a short summary of the match. If you didn’t know the name of a certain spell, simply describe its effects and I will discuss it at length after I’ve read all your papers. You are all dismissed.”
That was ward-fire that crackled across my skin. We’re free of Hogwarts boundaries. Snape jerks us to a halt, never letting go.
“Why? I mean…why all the extra ‘trouble’? I want to hear it.” Her eyes were boring into him, hot and unrelenting.
“SHUT THE FUCK UP! He just saved both your lives! I’m the best chance you’ve got of seeing the end of the year…but you’ll owe me!”
“Mr. Potter. Fifty points to Gryffindor for preventing the assassination of another student, and for ensuring for his future safety…creatively. Your detentions will be considered served. The ten remaining points will stay, for speaking inappropriately to a member of Hogwarts staff, and for being where you have no business, in defiance of school and house rules. That is all. Now go where you belong…for once!”
“Potter! My office…now! Wait until I arrive! We will discuss the matter of you wandering around in MY…HOUSE, when I get there.” Snape’s teeth were gritted, except for when he yelled, and Harry scooted off, ignoring the shocked glances from other Slytherin students in the common room as he left Slytherin’s dorms behind.
I probably just ripped the button off a shirt that cost more than the salesperson made in a week, but I’m not sorry. Tailors can deal with that another time. I’m almost past the point of sanity when I can finally feel his skin on mine. Some of the time, he lets me explore him, with mouth and hands, enjoying the way touching him pleases me, but he also commands, just as I knew he would, prayed he would. He pushes me back, plunders my mouth, dominates me effortlessly, reminding me that he is wonderfully, potently male. At moments like that, it is so very easy to surrender completely. Like a roller coaster, where you know that there is nothing you control, and you let go and scream until your lungs ache, and you can only be a helpless passenger until it’s over. I always loved roller coasters…and at this moment I feel like I’m dangling on the precipice of a plunge that won’t ever end.
But nature wasn’t the same for humans, and his difference was purely internal. What then was their excuse for labeling him as weird or a liar? Some pathetic need to raise themselves up from the muck by pulling everyone else down into it? He’d never spoken of these things openly, to anyone, and there had never really been anyone to speak to about them.
“In this case, expertly sautéed snails. Highest quality, too. Their chef is famous for his standards.”
“I agree. I’ll do my best, Minerva. I don’t know how anyone could endure that kind of thing and come away with a healthy view of the world, but there has to be a way for us to make sure he’s on the road to a decent life. I’m not sure I can do anything about the way I feel, and I don’t think any of you will ever really understand how much I miss his father, but I owe his father this much…I will find a way to do the best I can for Draco, even if it drives me half scatty in the process.”
He’d had to come early this year. His latest Auror mission had been inexplicably moved forward, and there would be no time for reminiscing while he was in Prague. This time he came by night, hoping to avoid the crowds of gawking students.
“I know…I know, kiddo. Nobody wants something like this. I’d rather bust pimps and dealers and bookies any day, but it looks like we drew the short straw. ‘May you live in interesting times’ is an ancient curse for a reason.”
There’s something else I haven’t done in years too. Fear, stress, pain and self loathing do nothing for the libido, not to mention the fact that, for the most part, I have very little interest in my own penis. I’m horny, inside and out, tipsy, and excited by the faint hint of his scent that teases me. I haven’t done this in a long time. It wasn’t important to me in there, surrounded by thugs and with a perpetually sore ass, but here it’s different. I’m clean and smell divine, everything is soft and comfortable, the temperature is perfect no matter what it’s like outside, and I’ve had the best meal of this decade. My dick is as hard as it’s ever been, and I want Harry here now! I want him to do all of those things he wouldn’t force me to do against my will. I want to write his face and eyes overtop of every memory of Blaise or Flint or anyone else I’ve ever been with, and I want to give him everything I have…even if the only thing I have to give is myself.
He tastes like scotch and fire, and I’ve had a few cocktails between extended rounds on the dance floor. Poor Ron has to drive despite the way we’re entwined behind him, with me almost comfortable in Harry’s lap, except for the starved hunger that makes our necks twist while we savage one another’s mouths. He whispers words that melt my mind. Sweeter than cocaine, more heady than Ecstasy. I want him so badly that it genuinely hurts. I want to drown in him, be filled by him, let him drive out the air in my lungs while I float into oblivion in his arms alone. All that I’ve endured, and still such a passion can overtake me? So be it.
James had sat through the entirety of it, watching his parent flinch with obvious discomfort at the telling of it all. It was far less unnerving than he'd imagined...and that was owed to a lifetime of private insecurities about the circumstances of his birth...so perhaps he'd been more ready for it than even he had suspected. That said, he offered his thanks to his mother of sorts, his second father, and smiled.
“As you wish, love. Ice cream for two, hold the worrying. I think I can fend off encroaching old age just long enough for this.”
That didn’t change much for Draco, who had noticed the subtle improvements in his life in general as well as his outlook. He drank alone quite a bit less these days, as did Harry, and he left behind the manor and elves at least twice a week, and occasionally more, always with Harry. He corresponded with others a bit more, like Snape, who was in Barcelona, patronized by some Count or another, or Zabini, who was still a decent mate after all these years, and was living in Sicily now. What hadn’t changed was his sex life…or lack thereof.
“Don’t. Just don’t, Harry.” Draco’s voice was soft and relatively calm, but a certain tension was almost palpable. “It wasn’t your fault. Magic is like that…sometimes. Anyone could wind up holding onto a force bigger than they are. Happens all the time. Just…just forget about it.”
It had been worth the patience. Harry had enjoyed every minute of the past two months, especially the parts where they'd figured out how to 'sixty nine'...at which point almost nothing else seemed to matter and that was about all they wanted to do when they could get time alone. There had been no wands allowed at their trysts since their recent reunion. It was a rule that each of them had followed without fail, mostly because there were some (fairly legitimate) issues of trust that hadn't been resolved. It had been Harry's only major sticking point for the deal that got them back together.
Draco seemed only slightly less tense, eager to change the subject to one he was comfortable with. His own skill was a familiar thing to him, but often a surprise to others. At least Harry accepted that he wasn’t cheating, and didn’t downplay the quality of his work.
“Nonsense. You’re tired, a little distraught, and the youngster in question is who he is. You‘ve got your reasons for missing the signs I picked up. Besides, I’ve counseled professionally now and again over the years. I’d see about having the lad drop by here myself, but I doubt he’d say anything productive if he felt as though people were deliberately prodding about for personal information. He already has a certain rapport with you. Get back to work and do your best, and I’ll get started on checking my potions, alright?”
There would be another time for more than this, with Harry, when other more important tasks were done and done well. But for now, it was time…to grow up…and be a father.
“But…but I heard that…you were going to leave here?! It’s true, isn’t it? You’re going to quit teaching…because of…all this? How can you say you don’t have regrets…when I made this happen? You should stay! You should…”
So strange to think that I’m technically dating ‘a younger man’! Not my normal style at all. It was always older men that caught my eye…with the exception of Blaise…but Harry hardly gives the impression of youth. Something about the confidence…the strength and clarity he possesses makes him feel older and wiser. Certainly enough to make me respond almost subconsciously. Something about that aura of power and ability makes me feel safe, makes me know that it will all be okay. Makes me…
The revelations he’d experienced, both alone and with John, had dramatically shifted his mood. He’d been pensive, restless, unsure of what to do and yet eager to do something. It was past time. He’d been lounging about for almost two whole weeks, taking in company now and again recently, but mostly just reading and thinking. The time for thinking was long past, and the time for deciding and acting had come. This was where Harry felt most alive…in the moment. Things had piled up in his absence, and needed doing. He had a responsibility to fulfill, like he had had years ago, and it was his part to meet that responsibility head on.
Harry’s cock was twitching back to life, albeit sluggishly, before Draco’s ministrations were complete, and a mutual hunger to be joined as quickly as possible made foreplay of any kind a matter of minutes. Then Draco was kneeling before him, slick with the long unused lubricant he’d purchased for them so long ago, and Harry poised himself for entrance.
“I could tell you stories about what a Metamorphamagus can do to her tongue all night, but it would only come off like bad fan fiction. I had a wonderful time, and it was worth every minute of it. Still good friends, but that’s all. It is what you make of it, Harry. Go make up with him. The rest of the world needs a happy couple in the papers, and you need to take risks before you wind up wasting all that sexual talent by never using it…stud puppet.”
Harry barely had the presence of mind to instinctively close his eyes and turn his head as Draco's overstimulated and sex starved member exploded like a fountain of white. The jets of come seemed to last a full half minute, spattering Harry's face and head while Draco gasped.
It’s amazing how many people adore you when you’re rich and pretty, and equally amazing how quickly they have contempt for you when you’re not rich anymore. With only pretty on my side, people had only one use for me, but that was enough to survive on. It wasn’t all bad. I got into clubs and got a fake ID. I knew people who would supply drugs to party with before we ‘played’, and genuinely pretty queens are in demand, which guaranteed me a certain steady income once I got used to it.
“That’s better. You’re gonna be fine. Oh…and Hermione is dropping by tonight. She’s got a few points to discuss about a preliminary plan.”
Here’s the gist of it. We never talk about my work in front of anyone, unless I mention it in front of you first. You remember Ron? The driver? He’s a company man, like me, and a good friend. The chauffeur gig is a cover. He’s one of the few people that comes here regularly. The doctor that’s coming to give you a check up…he’s the company doctor. He’s kind of an annoying bastard, but he’s one of the best. Him you can trust. Maria and Therese know almost nothing, except they've been cleared by the company I work for and know to ignore any unusual things about me or my life. It's why they're paid so well. Let’s keep it that way. The cover story is that I own significant shares of a plastics company. The Phoenix Corporation. All you know, if anyone should ever ask, is that I sit on the board of directors and frequently have to travel. I negotiate solutions to problems. That's all.
“Yeah, yeah. You guys and your lesbian fantasies. Let’s go. Maybe we won’t be the ones who break this wide open, but it won’t be because we didn’t try.”
He wanted Draco as badly as ever, even more perhaps, but to give in now, just to satisfy himself, would reinforce Draco’s current behavior, just as he was beginning to face it. If he wanted Draco back, in a way that was healthy and right and might last, he would have to keep working at Draco’s defenses until the stubborn git opened up and gave Harry something more significant to help him with.
Harry gave the matter a little thought. “Yes…not much…but yes. Try pushing the misunderstood and confrontational genius angle as hard as you can. Assure them that I’m working with the lad personally and that his response seems very positive so far. In my opinion, and you can quote me on this, he seems very interested in overcoming a reputation he was born with rather than earned. Very much an uncompromising over-achiever, and I expect he feels very insecure about people’s opinions of him. I think that’s what really makes him seem so stand-offish. I honestly don’t think he has any ill intent in him, Minerva. He’s just a young man who got handed a few hard blows early on in life, and he’s making the best of it…figuring it out as he goes along.”
Harry sensed the desperation, and raised his final shield, one learned only by Aurors, which was quite nearly impermeable. Draco’s spells deflected helplessly off of it, setting off a frenzy of black and horrible curses, all Dark or at least dangerous, but none Unforgivable for an adult wizard in a formal duel. Each shattered against Harry’s cone of golden light while Harry prepared his final attack in perfect calm.
Draco exploded into action, slapping the teacup from Harry’s hand and sweeping the table clear of dishes with his arm. Book, saucers, cup and tea went crashing to the floor while he stood up and knocked his chair back, roaring into Harry’s face with unconcealed rage.
Ron was fairly gifted in certain aspects of DADA, and the war was responsible for that, but Harry’s comprehensive knowledge had come from spending those first years after the war as an Auror, then as a teacher researching the subject with an intensity that surprised everyone. The result was a man who was familiar with nearly every known spell for DADA and their applications. Ron couldn’t match that overnight, but he could probably hold out for a couple of weeks and keep the dueling practice on par.
The fat man was fresh in from Moscow, fringe of snowy hair curled with expensive oil, nose red from years of good liquor. The woman on his arm was the envy of many, slim and pale, long dark tresses slithering down shoulders like snowy alps, her dress as black and shiny as the crude oil that had made his fortune. The dress was on the floor now and they rolled on the bed of a five star hotel in Brussels, her kittenish giggles almost out of place coming from a woman with such a normally cultured and haughty air about her.
“I guess that’s good enough. You’re a piece of alright, Dee. See ya next time. Get in that elevator and be good to yourself, right?”
“Luna…Luna…Luna…please…damn it…I’m sorry…I am at work. I need you to get straight to the point. Okay…Remus called…I get it. I’ll call him later…fine. I am at work…I need to go, Luna…please. Okay? This is important…I can’t talk now. I’ll talk to you when I get home…but I need to get back to work now. Please? Okay. Okay. I…I love you too.”
He stomps to a cabinet and unlocks it. There are bottles and bottles of pills and liquids. He snatches one and I can’t help flinching when he turns.
“I BEG YOUR PARDON!” Draco stomped forward, hovering over Harry’s desk, eyeball to eyeball with Harry while he shouted his answer.
“I’ll take that martini. I find it disturbing enough that we both named our children for our parents. Funny. I’ve never really talked about Pansy or Cissy with anyone much. Hadn’t really occurred to me that you might be pleasant to be around. You’re a bit of alright, Potter, when it comes right down to it. Just…don’t plan on quoting me on that, understood? Wouldn’t do to let a fine, old rivalry wither on the vine, as it were. Cheers.”
Draco’s mouth formed a single, silent word. Through the haze of grief and anger, even through blurred eyes and a mind bent by incredulity, it was still clear. It was a simple plea.
Harry pulled back a moment, catching Draco a bit off his guard, then gently pulled Draco onto his back, so that Harry could sit astride him and kiss him properly on the mouth. Draco eventually became aware of how still Harry was…apparently his boyfriend didn’t dare grind his hips for fear of instant orgasm, and it occurred to Draco that this might well be the most relaxed they’d ever been as a couple.
Draco hung his head a moment. “I know it seemed like I wasn’t ready for this, but that’s over, love. I told you I’d come, and I wouldn’t break a promise to you. Not now, not ever.”
And then he’s gone, and I’m unpacking things with Harry, getting comfortable in a suite that looks like some Victorian bedroom from Martha Stewart Living. You know…the kind of setting that looks like anyone who touches it gets their hand chopped off for disturbing the perfection. It’s an anal-retentive’s wet dream in here, but Harry doesn’t care. I finally get everything unpacked, and that’s when I realize our plans had a flaw.
Everything about him was sweet. It’s impossible to pair up the image of the man that beat Flint half to death with the polished, bright and eager to please guy I met yesterday. Harry James Potter. How could anyone say no to that? He told me his real name…and he isn’t going to kill me. If anything, I think I’m in less danger than ever. That knowledge alone is enough to make me kind of giddy.
He’d managed to deal reasonably well while talking about the killings. It had been more appetizing than speaking of Draco, and Harry’s mind was already inflicting enough memories of those times on him as it was. The Dreamless Sleep had worked and worked well, and Harry had to admit that physically, he felt genuinely better, rested and energetic, restless and eager for things to occupy his time. More than fit enough to work.
True to his word, Ron pops out of the elevator six minutes after he hung up. Their base of operations must be close by for him to make it here so quick, but it makes sense that Harry would be near transportation and support, even though he can take good care of himself alone. Ron isn’t dressed in the chauffeur’s uniform this time. He looks like a high priced bodyguard. Black coat and slacks, bulge in the left side of the jacket, dark glasses and neatly trimmed red hair.
Harry only took a couple of steps into the water, stopping midway in. His hand slid down his stomach in lazy circles that Draco watched with interest, until it reached the downy fur that surrounded his rapidly rising cock. Harry ran his fingertips down the length of it, pausing at the head, tipping his chin back and smirking wickedly.
“Perfect. Let’s get under cover. Garage first. New vehicle. Back to base second. Nice grouping on those shots.”
The panic is gone, and I know I can deal with it all now. I know he loves me, and that he won’t hurt me to vent his anger. It gives me a confidence I’ve never had before. I don’t mind being totally honest.
And I really think I do. Maybe my instincts make war with me now and then, but the rest of me understands one hundred percent. We’re on the way to dinner, I’m strangely calm, and I just realized something else.
“You need to be shutting the hell up! I don’t know how and I don’t know why, but I’d bet my cotton socks that you’re right at the core of this! You’re a Malfoy right down to your bones, and there’s never been a one of them that brought anything but trouble with them. If you’ve any idea what’s good for you, you’ll get out of my sight in a hurry, and stay that way until you’re called for! Got it!”
Draco looked back with a smirk as he opened the door. "I lied. I was still really bitter about the tie. NOW we're even!" And with that he strolled out into the hall.
Mmm. I think the reading again. I never properly enjoyed ‘White Fang’ until Harry read it aloud. Jack London had a real passion when he wrote that book, and listening to Harry’s voice was soothing in the extreme. Of course, what Harry doesn’t know is that, while he was reading and I was raptly paying attention with eyes wide, I was discreetly imagining him as a wolf, feral and potent, devouring me utterly, sating his hunger and slaking his thirst with me as his sustenance. I just shiver at the thought of him, and think of his teeth on my throat. Can’t help it really. I’m kind of vulnerable to flights of fancy when I haven’t been given a proper and thorough fucking in a while.
I’m just being stupid. No matter how uncomfortable he makes me, the man isn’t supernatural. What he is…is intimidating, and I can deal with that. At least he has good taste. I can cope with anyone civilized, and this place is as nice as Harry’s.
“Ahhh…fucksake, Harry! Merlin, that’s fucking good…just finish me off. I want to come in that pretty mouth of yours.”
Exasperating! That’s what it was. What on earth made such a simple request into a cause for dramatics? Things had gone quite well up until today. He’d expected some outburst of temper or misconduct at some point, but he’d hardly expected it to be over this! Inexplicable!
Malfoy had caught him off his guard, and this time he knew what he’d be seeing when he got there. However glib and cool Malfoy meant to play it, Harry would be ready to answer accordingly.
Draco had gotten more than a little hysterical, flushed and a little ragged and wild about the eyes. Much of the days events were coming back to him clearly, and while he’d been stalwart when he had a purpose to fulfill, now he was panicky, exhausted and nerve-wracked. John Prewett calmly changed the subject.
He leans in conspiratorially, and I wait for him to speak again, made curious by the smirk that forms from the corner of his mouth and rapidly spreads.
“I want you to seek out someone you trust, someone who would be able to help you. And I want you to talk to them, about you, about what happened this past week, even about the past few months.”
The Dark Lord spoke, and I fell beside my father, on my knees, groveling like a slave. Parseltongue made us utterly compliant, but in the back of my mind, some rational part was left, just trapped and watching from a distance, horrified by what it saw…what I saw.
“Really? I’m grateful for the cease-fire and the hospitality, but there isn’t much to be said. You’re straight, I wish you weren’t, and there isn’t anything for it but for me to conduct myself like a gentleman from here on in. You’re worth the effort. I’ll behave. End of story. If I walk out of here and still have a friend that will every so often tolerate an opera with me, I shall consider myself luckier than I’ve a right to be.”
To say that their emergence into Hogwarts’ society as a couple ‘caused a stir’ would have been an understatement of epic proportions, rather like saying that ‘the return of the Dark Lord caused slight anxiety’ for the wizarding world.
The pen was put aside when the hour grew late, and the elves had already conjured away the plate and silverware. Draco never read books more than once. He remembered them all…always. Every word he’d ever taken in was still with him, immortally etched into his mind. There was only book for which he made an exception. His book. His refuge.
“In a scenario like this, we’ll be going for speed. I’ll move room to room, ‘cleaning’ anyone I see until I’ve got Drake safe. You’d be coming straight to the front entrance while I work the building. Once Drake and I are out, all that matters is moving away quietly and quickly…no pursuit allowed. That means terminal force if necessary, and Dean has cooked up some new countermeasures to discourage followers. I’ve got three maps from Hermione covering possible routes home to keep us away from an obvious path of retreat. Those are for you, and just so you know, you’ll be playing the chauffer again, in case any cops stop and inquire about an expensive car parked with a driver waiting. All clear?”
Draco fared only a little better, periodically taking chances on intimacy with the rare fellow intellectual that shared his sexuality, but his inexperience and temperament made these affairs rocky things that usually ended in quiet and amicable separation. On very rare occasions, when he had imbibed enough alcohol to loosen his tongue and only Hermione was present, he would blurt out that he still felt something for Harry, and that he couldn't quite bring himself to commit to another, but didn't dare trouble Harry with it anymore...and on those occasions Hermione would do the motherly thing and let him ramble about it until it was out of his system and he could drift off to bed. It bothered her immensely, that neither of the two had yet found someone that suited them, and while she felt strongly that Harry had been right to reject Draco's youthful pining in as gentle a way as possible, she sometimes wondered if it might have been better for them somehow as a couple, as horrific and awkward as the proposition sounded.
Hermione sat at her desk, or rather, her desks, since with a rolling office chair with a smooth swivel action she could manage three monitors at the same time, rolling from one to the next with ease, printing or forwarding file after file to the others in the office. Her work was less about translation that it was about recognizing and prioritizing information. She acted as a hacker only when necessity called, and generally only translated when there was spare time or a slow period in the office. Most days were like this one, hustling from monitor to monitor, scanning reams of data and earmarking the ones that were of interest. Phone records, wiretaps, legal events, deaths, corporate announcements, money transfers and on and on endlessly.
He'd visited other landmarks of his father's time at Hogwarts. Walked the Quidditch Pitch and even soared above it alone on a borrowed broom. He'd found Moaning Myrtle…and extracted from her, between tearful sobs, the story of his father's nearly mortal injury at Potter's hands. He'd even found the aerie where his father had watched while Severus Snape killed Albus Dumbledore.
Pansy. I know that I desire her, her wit, her magnificent and towering arrogance, her deliberate use of power to suit her needs. So admirable to every proper Slytherin sensibility. I tell myself this was all for the achievement of my ultimate goal. All for my own pleasure. I had purpose and meaning and decisive intent. Where has that gone in these weeks of idle and childlike bliss with a naïve virgin who wandered witless into the jaws of a trap I set for him? I should savor the coming kill…not find myself at cross purposes!
“Hah! They respect it from a distance for a reason! I’m wondering who schemed this up! Do you realize how much we’re paying to eat the things that no sane person would want? There has to be a Slytherin involved in this somewhere near the top…I just know it!”
Johnny slid his coat off and dropped it onto the floor beside the bed, kicking off his shoes while he spoke. The lazy cow didn’t move at all. She was sleeping like she actually worked for a living, instead of humping a few tricks a day. He’d remind her that she could be fucking fifty tricks a day if he wanted her to, as soon as he enjoyed himself first.
I didn’t even see Ron’s hand move, but everyone here heard that finger snap. The big one is screaming and cursing, holding a hand with a finger that’s just been bent backwards until it snapped like a twig, but the others are moving forward. Ron opens his coat enough to show his pistol. That stops them cold.
Fifteen years since he‘d saved the world. He didn’t think of himself as an alcoholic, since he didn’t drink heavily in general, and almost nothing when the kids were around. He could go for days without a drop, and he almost never touched hard liquor. When he was drinking, he never caused trouble or made a nuisance of himself. The very idea of behaving terribly in public mortified him far too much for that. If he could be said to drink too much, it only happened at times like this, when the children were away at school, and the pathetic emptiness and futility of his life and work wore on him most.
He’s standing in the door to an examination room. I still can’t believe he has one in his house! How convenient is that? We’re in a well appointed living room with gorgeous black leather couches and chairs, and he’s standing there with a scowl and an air of complete exasperation.
“He really is a little workhorse, isn’t he?” Ron mused quietly to Harry, all the while watching as Hermione drilled the slim blond on computer protocols and shared notation for comments that would be recognized by the others in the lab.
“Hmm. I heard so much about French cooking. I guess I just assumed that…well…you know…they’d actually cook…with heat. My bad.”
Draco nipped gently at the nape of Harry’s neck, enjoying the little tremor from Harry that echoed against his own body. It was going to be a very long night…and there was no question in his mind that it was only the first of many to come.
Harry expected outrage...and retorts, and he'd been exaggerating out of frustration just to get even, because he and Ron had never gotten past a few side by side wanks...but all Harry heard was sudden silence followed by a loud thump. Harry let go of his dick and peered around the open door of the bathroom. "Draco?"
Fletcher sighed and let go of the sleeve he’d been holding, then dived back into his soup and sandwich.
“What he said was mine to hear. It wouldn’t help anything or anyone to repeat it. He answered my questions, then threw me to the ground. I ran away when he ordered me to leave.”
“Thank you, professor. I’d…I think I’d rather not speak of this anymore. You were very kind to share what you have. I…I have a lot to study…I should probably return to my room and call the house-elves for some supper. May I be excused?”
“You’d be right, too! Nearly getting poisoned to death will give you a long memory! And it wasn’t even because he was gunning for me…but because he was so pathetically incompetent that he managed to botch almost everything he touched! If Harry hadn’t shoved a bezoar down my throat at the last second, I’d have been a lot worse off than a bad bellyache and a case of the green-apple trots. Maybe I look at you and still see him, and maybe it isn’t fair, but that’s how it is. If I can make do with this arrangement, then so can you. Enjoying it isn’t necessary…and it isn’t expected, so don’t trouble yourself over it.”
Draco’s rooms, as it turned out, were warded with ’safe’ wards that didn’t cause injury…but blocked entry completely. The spells were well above the average level of ward that Harry had dealt with for years…but not beyond his ability to crack. It just didn’t bode well that Draco felt such a need for privacy beyond what was normally granted to any student who didn’t reside in the dorms.
Ron shuddered while Draco opened the door to leave in a huff. It made his teeth ache to even say it, but the words came anyway.
On the eve before his own wedding, James asks his parent how he came to be, and Draco finally answers
Either way, these people know food. They have an intimate relationship with it, because in a lot of cases, they came here to live in a place where there was more of it, and they’re used to preparing it from scratch. Like, live chicken…dead chicken…plucked and gutted chicken…add heat…dinner. They didn’t buy it at the supermarket…they raised it from a chick, or grew it in a garden.
It wasn’t that he hadn’t heard of such a thing, or even vaguely glossed over it while imagining sex, but it still seemed like a shockingly intimate thing to do so quickly! And there of all places!
Additionally, though you have specifically cited a desire to study Defense Against The Dark Arts, I will need time to measure your skills myself, and prepare a curriculum accordingly. You strike me as a young man who rises to whatever task is before him, and deals poorly with idle time. I think it would be appropriate for you to take additional classes here in subjects that weren’t covered heavily at Durmstrang. They have no formal course in Divinations, and I suspect the course would be of interest to you, especially since Firenze, the centaur, is our professor for that subject.”
The infirmary doors were never locked during the school year, and Draco paused only a moment before opening one and stepping in. He was invited and expected, so there was no need to knock like some timid titmouse. Strange. He’d never concerned himself with such a trivial thing…until Harry had made it clear that privacy was a thing to be respected. It was something of an alien concept for Draco. He’d never really had any…except for the trunk that held his possessions.
“Fine, fine! You and I will be in the car down the street about a block and a half away. We’ll be wired for headset communication, you with the standard rig and me with the throat patch mic and earpiece. I’ll move to the outside back of the building as soon as Drake is indoors. The most obvious entrance is here…or here. Tentatively, I’d say I’ll wait to enter the back yard until you give me the signal. In the event of security alarms or motion detectors, I don’t want to give any advance notice of my presence. If I have to, I’ll go in fast enough that I’ll still have the edge while they wonder what the hell is going on.
It breaks up into specifics and questions for awhile, fingers pointing at marks on a map, Harry making notes on points of entry to various work yards. This is what I do, what I’m a part of now. We scheme, and then we execute. Harry is uncertain about my seeing my father again, but he leaves the idea in my hands, just like before.
“I knew you’d pass. I never doubted it for a second. As soon as he told me that he was going to put an offer on the table and test your resolve, I told him it wouldn’t work. You proved me right, and I knew you would. Looks like we’re both pretty good gamblers, doesn’t it?”
Strong hands running up my back while he whispers confused and grateful words of need. I can tell. He, in his own way, is sometimes scared of what he feels. The strength of it. The way it complicates. But it’s too powerful to just ignore. The time for that is past. We’re both in too deep to escape. We have to make our way together now, because nothing else would ever be enough.
“It’s the baths, Harry. The Prefect’s baths have a special spell on them, and it only activates if you have the password while you’re in the bath. It makes the temperature of the bath linger on you for hours afterwards. Better than any Cooling or Heating Charm ever cast. I take three baths a day, and so do all the other Prefects. If this got out, it would start a stampede. There’d be fistfights in the halls. It has to stay secret, or the Heads of House would close the Prefect baths down and stop anyone from using it. If you wanted to stay warm in winter, you’d say ‘Kill the chill’, but for this kind of weather, you say ‘Beat the heat’, and the magic kicks in and does the rest.”
Draco was supremely gentle, stroking Harry’s back in relative silence, save for a few whispered words of approval and admiration that felt like loud accolades to Harry, who had starved for approval his entire lifetime, and responded so easily to it now.
“You’re sure you’re alright? I just knew this would upset you, but I swear I’m just fine. You don’t have to worry about anything.”
The words dropped off my tongue like anvils. I feel like I can breathe again, and the quiet smile that looks so good on his face is back again. I can believe he doesn’t want to hurt me. I can believe that…but I just can’t believe that he won’t wind up doing it anyway.
Oh, Daddy. There you are again, hogging the limelight on the evening news as always. The commercials are over, and Congressman Malfoy is turning an interview that’s supposed to be news into nothing more than a different kind of advertising. Every word and look is carefully chosen, every smile and laugh seems genuine. Only someone who truly knows him would know that inside he is as empty and soulless as a shark.
“Yes. Do it. As soon as I’m healed up I’ll be ready when you are. If that’s the best way to make me a part of this, then that’s what we’ll do. Count me in.”
“My father took me to a Dark revel. Just once. I was too young to be marked, and the Dark Lord had just returned. My father was the proudest man I’ve ever known, but when the Dark Lord spoke in Parseltongue, my father groveled on the ground like a commoner, and I was right beside him. As soon as it was over, I made excuses to avoid other meetings. When it was my choice, and my father was sent to Azkaban, I warded the manor off and refused the Mark. I didn’t ever want to feel that way again. Of course, that didn’t do much good, since the only other Parselmouth in existence wound up closer to me than planned.”
Harry chuckled softly and couldn't contain a goofy grin. "Just get them on and put your hands on the wall. This is gonna be awesome."
“I do loathe sounding clichéd, but I’m afraid it can’t be helped. Drake…Harry is very important to me, as is the cause toward which we all labor. Anything that threatens that purpose presents a very serious problem. I’m aware of your past, and of your problems, and quite honestly…you present a rather thorny issue for me.
“Very well. Help is on its way. You may follow me while you explain your abominable conduct! I’ve already heard of your outburst today. Inexcusable. Not to mention-”
“I believe you. I do. It all sounds impossible, but when you say it, I can feel that it must somehow be true. He wrote of that, too. He said you made what seemed unreachable into something that could be real. I wanted to give the book to you. I knew it should have been yours. I just...I...I suppose I always sensed that when you took it, it would change everything. It might not be mine anymore. I've had it so long...and always...it gave me this....what I feel now, because of you. I didn't want to risk it. I didn't know I would feel like this. I feel like anything could happen. Like I belong somewhere. As if every terrible thing that has ever happened mattered not at all. You should read it all. I'll miss it...but perhaps I don't need it at all...if I have this.”
"Oh...oh God. Harry...he's..." Hermione fought the urge to vomit while Malfoy somberly tucked away the small volume and sipped from his brandy.
Draco put his face into his hands and barked out a strangled sob before he could speak. "You don't know me! I'm not like you! I gave you your life back...you should just go!" It was all he could get out before his shoulders started to convulse and he bent over, shuddering, spilling the tea and breakfast in the process.
Harry closed his eyes, remembering exactly how it felt to press his palms against cool stone, trousers at his ankles, while Draco held his hips firmly, thrusting fast and deep into a body that practically begged him for as much as he could deliver.
He does it so well, every little thing I need and demand. I make a question of my flesh, and he is the answer. I need pain to expiate my sins, and he can give it when he truly believes that it’s what I want. And I believe it...and I want it, but it doesn’t mean that I can’t tell how much he dislikes this. I can feel his discomfort, even while he makes sure that I get what I ask for. The sick, dark feeling inside of me doesn’t dissipate easily. The truth is an ugly thing, as warped and bent as we all are. I can see the truth reflected in his eyes…when he stares only at me. The fact that Blaise was no Christ…makes me no less of a Judas. I’m no better than him in the end, and if Harry knew the little things of my life as I do…
He unloaded six rounds, all within an inch or two of the center. Almost perfect. Harry snorted derisively. ’Isn’t that just like life?’
He hadn’t slept properly all week, and even his normally modest classwork was beginning to suffer. Usually it was bloody Voldemort making it hard to get a decent night’s rest, then the weather had to step up to the plate and take over!
He could say it. Harry knew in his heart that he could finally say it. Like this, here in some shadow creation of Grimmauld Place, with his hand stroking through Draco's hair like he'd loved to do in those rare times when they'd had the freedom to just be close.
“How! How can you say that! Say those…things! I LOVE YOU! I’ve never loved anyone like this! ONLY YOU! How…”
After that, it was only a matter of time before Harry spattered himself with come, and collapsed into a limp and inchoate wreck right there on the tiled floor. Draco had promptly knelt above him and relieved his own erection via masturbation, dispassionately aiming his come, quite suggestively, between Harry’s inner thighs, letting it drip and mingle with the saliva that already drenched Harry’s backside.
It must have been embarrassing for them, being defeated that easily, but at least no one was willing to try anything stupid after seeing the duel against Harry Potter. Draco had been left to his own devices, sorting paperwork on Ron Weasley’s behalf while the class was taught, and he took no real part in it, only taking notes out of a vague sense of responsibility to his own grades.
Aw, shit…who the fuck am I kidding? Dee, lemme say this right now and get it out. I really feel like I owe you. I really do. Been thinking about you since you hit the club like a lightning bolt. I did you wrong, and I wanna make it up to you. Tell me you’ll come over some time. No pressure. Just dinner, some good vino, and talk.
Well…assistants in the sense that they hit the streets and pored over the paperwork, picking through facts and possibilities, while Scrimgeour lunched with the mayor and glad handled TV crews all damn day. Even if they blew this case wide open, it would all go to Scrimgeour’s credit as a job well done. Additionally, his version of ’pouring every resource into resolving this situation’ translated to ’keeping every member of the staff on duty almost 16 hours a day’. Jackass.
“Don’t apologize. You had your reasons, you made some mistakes like everyone else, but everything is fine now, isn’t it? I feel better than I have in years. I feel like I can…deal with life on its own terms again. None of that would be true if things hadn’t gone as they had. I have no regrets. Not one. Not about you coming here.”
“Alright then. Welcome to Chinatown. Remember to take a seat facing me while I sit with my back to the room. You eat and enjoy…I watch the crowd and the doors. If I give an order, it’s for a reason, and you follow it! Got it?”
Harry walked the edge of the bath with the grace of a panther, never letting his eyes off Draco Malfoy, smiling like a starving alley cat and giving a look to Draco that suggested that he was the nearest stunned mouse.
Vinnie and Greg were in separate rooms, likely handcuffed on the floor just like Blaise himself. He’d heard the shouts when they’d found Vinnie’s gun, and despite the fact that they were let into the house voluntarily, so far they’d acted like they’d had to fight their way in under heavy fire, and were in mortal danger every second. In theory, they might have been, but in all seriousness, they’d been in Blaise’s home, ripping it to shreds, for almost half an hour while screaming questions at the tops of their lungs, and the only three occupants were cuffed in separate rooms. At this point, pretending that they were ever in danger was beginning to look a little silly.
“Thank God! Even Superman has a Fortress Of Solitude to fall back on when he needs a break. Call me greedy, but I want to steal you away, all for myself, and leave a message telling the world to fuck off instead of calling back later. We’ve never even been in the library at the same time. I want you to pick out your favorites, and read some of them to me.”
Doc Snape has a discreet townhouse in the suburbs. One of those rental types that costs an arm and a leg to lease. It doesn’t look like an actual office of any kind, and there are no signs or anything. He really must be a private doctor, working only for the company. If he had a practice, he’d have a normal office…right?
“I think you’re selling yourself short, but it is your life. This is the twenty-first century! Girls can ask out boys if they like. Even so…if he asked you out…you would say yes, wouldn’t you?”
I lure him off by the hand after breakfast, after savoring the quiet clean up together, dragging him down the hall and into ‘the music room’. The first thing he sees is the paintings.
“I’m very biased…especially from back here. I may have been blinded by the magnificence from where I’m sitting.”
I feel the crackle of Apparition, and the last thing I think of is what I’ve lost. What I have left isn’t worth keeping anymore, and that will be taken from me soon enough. My life is over.
Harry had floundered while Draco broke down, unsure of what to say, uncertain of what would help and what might do more harm than good. He snatched the parchment back eagerly, happy to accept the break in the tension, which was still so thick in the room that it nearly seemed to choke out actual air.
I don’t plan to be out all day, but I make a few purchases along the way, which leads to our final stop. It’s enough to make Ron turn pink all over. Sure, it’s trashy and nasty, but they have what I need. My mind was made up last night. If Harry is going to be gone, sometimes for weeks, I need something to keep me company, and I won’t be chasing any men other than Harry. I need a dildo. For that, I need an adult store.
Awed? Dumbstruck? Those are close, but they don’t quite cover where I’m at. Maybe I shouldn’t use words. I’m not even sure I should use sex. Not that I don’t suddenly want to, but this is bigger than even that. I lean in…curl around his arm, lotion slicked and shining in the sun, and just rest my head on his shoulder. The words come when they’re ready.
I stroll toward the door, making sure my strut sets his loins on fire. I always did it then, and I know I can do it now. The night air makes the sweat on my skin feel cold, even though the last faint hints of summer heat are still here even at night. The silk sticks to my skin and the breeze tickles. I feel so alive! Ron will take me home, as soon as he catches up, but I have my private moment of victory now.
“Thanks, Ron. You’re still my best mate, and don’t worry…I’m not getting into anything I can’t handle. I’ll be fine. I’ve gotta get dressed and go, but I can catch up with you in class.”
What a perfect storm of a week it had been so far. Despite John Prewett’s best efforts, Harry still woke to vague memories of his Draco, as he looked twenty years ago, calling out Harry’s name in the mist of dreams. With whiskey out of the mix, Harry had been vaguely tense, but at least the potions did away with the unpleasantness of withdrawal. His sleep was sound enough, but each morning, as the potion faded, flickering memories and wishes took over, fickle and cruel, making Harry’s mornings a time he dreaded.
Droplets smear the windows, and soft sounds of water on tires is barely audible outside. The refraction from streetlights makes the water shine like a million diamonds, like shards of glass on a hardwood floor. I cleaned up the mess, made everything look nice, and I got away with my ass intact. I should be cheering. Why do I feel as hollow inside as if I’d actually killed him?
Words like bugger, shag, screw and fuck made the act seem inherently wrong and dirty. Even less pleasant terms were applied to the people who preferred to be the one buggered, shagged, screwed or fucked. Punk…bitch…slut…whore…sissy…nancy…the list dragged on endlessly. But when Harry thought of what it would be like to feel Draco inside of him, to be utterly linked to his boyfriend in a fashion that could not be matched any other way, his stomach fluttered nervously, his breath caught in his throat, and he couldn’t imagine anything wrong or evil about being made love to by someone he adored. However the world’s view was slanted, his gut instincts told him they were all wrong.
Every day a different bundle of records came to her desk, and some got shuffled off to other teams for follow up investigation, but Dora and Kingsley pulled key interviews and interrogations, assembled timelines and issued reports, and at least their names were still right in the heart of the biggest task force event in living memory. Even so, the piles of paperwork in their respective offices were getting out of control. Even as she left her office and hurried down the hall, an old man from records was pushing a little cart toward her office with a delivery of new files she’d requested.
Somewhere around two in the morning, an unknown man had walked out of a small bar and bistro in an Italian neighborhood, leaving behind six dead men. Four ‘soldiers’, one capo and a courier. The Italians were keeping quiet about everything, but secretly blamed the Russians, who had lost one man in the riots compared to the Italian’s three. The other death in the prison riot was from a Chinese Tong, and they were harder to get a word out of than the Italians.
Draco pushed his head against his door and breathed slowly while he answered, looking as properly tired and wan as a person who hadn’t likely slept of eaten an a day would look.
Harry had refused the position years ago, content merely to teach, while Neville, who had gained considerable confidence during the war, rose to the task admirably as the Head of Gryffindor House. Divinations was now taught exclusively by Firenze, the centaur that had long ago befriended Harry, earning the wrath of his herd. Arithmancy was now taught by Cho Chang, which had once been a bit of a ticklish situation, but had long since settled into a comfortable working friendship. Astronomy was taught by an elderly Ravenclaw. The professorship for the Runes department was held by a rather genial Slytherin. Charms was still in the capable hands of Professor Flitwick, and old Binns was still making History of Magic an occasion worthy of naps.
Bouncing across small waves, shaking like a monkey on a stick, picking up speed as we go. The weirdest and most familiar moment is that second when we go from skipping across waves to genuinely flying. One second we are of the earth, the next we are in flight. You can actually feel the loss of that connection to the earth. Uncanny. Suddenly, it’s not so bad, and I’m curled around Harry, looking out the window at the clean blue lake beneath us. Freight ships on the horizon. Small fishing boats along the coastline. Endless, deep, dark blue water.
It had been a trying week to say the least. Draco had shown up a half hour late for Monday morning’s Potions class, bringing the wrath of Snape down on both of them. Harry wouldn’t have been involved in it at all, if Nott hadn’t passed along the rumors of Harry and Draco’s weekend tryst directly to Snape. The professor had turned crimson, insisted Nott shut his mouth, given Draco detention, and stripped ten points from Gryffindor when Harry attempted to protest.
That part was news to Harry, and even if Draco wasn’t the topic he’d choose for evening thoughts over coffee with Hermione, it did pique his interest.
“Tell the penis-parking lot to make tracks, love. We need to talk, and I don’t waste time with small words for the junior high set.”
“Fine! So he didn’t put you up to this. It’s nice that you want to help…but if he can’t get up the nerve to ask me out himself, then maybe he isn’t really someone I’d want to date. Ever think of that?”
“I beg to differ. I’m pretty sure thought wasn’t involved, because I thought I made it clear that this insipid Hufflepuff bullshit is off the menu. Was I unclear?”
When you consider that I’m headed for the most important meeting of my life so far, and that I should be very serious and somber about this, in deference to the gravity of our situation, the fact that I’m so giddy that I can’t stop smirking is probably a little juvenile.
"Music to my ears, Potter! Insult me more! C'mon! Admit it! You have some feelings of your own, don't you? What's the matter? Life on the outside world going hard, difficult to make new friends, thinking about the guy who saved your life even though he was a prat to you? Been months since you've had a decent shagging? Or..."
"I told you I could hurt you in ways that no one else had ever dreamed of, didn't I, Harry? Looks like I didn't lie to lie to you about that...and I'm not lying about this: I love you, Harry. Just try to stay alive long enough to remember that." Standing on the chair, Draco surged forward, pinning Harry's body to the old cross, face buried in Harry's neck while he held the slender man tight against the wooden construct.
“Attaboy, Moony. Now let’s go photograph some adulterers in action, cause it’s time to pay the rent, fucker.”
Thank God for Harry. The perfect distraction! I need to think about his birthday. I can hoard the resources I have, think of gifts I can create rather than merely purchase, and maybe pick up a few nice things besides. For what he’s done for me, I have to make his birthday something unbelievable.
There are other pictures of his parents, apart and together. It looks like they met in school or college. Harry’s dad looks tall and a bit gawky, but his mother shares the eyes that I find so hypnotic. These are the people that combined to make him. They only exist on paper and in photos now. He never even met them. When you see his finger brush across the surface of the photo album, you can tell how much that loss is still a part of him.
Harry stood in horror, looking at what he’d had a hand in causing, and wished that he had the means to kill himself that instant.
Draco closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. Cheap soap, Quidditch callous salve, leather oil, a faint hint of peppery sweat, and a delicate wisp of something sweetly musk-like, that must have been a part of Harry’s body chemistry, since Draco recalled it being always present, but always faint. Those were the scents of his lover, and he knew them intimately. He also cherished every one of them.
“You need to eat. You’ve been in here for almost five days, Draco. People are worried. I wanted to see if I could help.”
“It was a feeling. I could tell he wasn’t well. You didn’t see him…what he was like. I thought he’d gone insane. When I stopped running, I knew I shouldn’t have let him alone like that…even if he wanted me to leave. He wasn’t well…but I didn’t know what else to do. I went to the Headmistress and demanded that she seek him out. It…it made sense then. I just acted…there wasn’t time for thought.”
“Good enough. There are other things to talk about, and I hope you can be fair while you listen, mate…because there isn’t much of it that’s pretty.”
Time lost meaning…again…and Draco came back to himself quite suddenly when he realized that Harry was close against his body, snug and warm, at rest as deep inside Draco as was possible. The sense of fullness wasn’t as bracing as he might have imagined, but it was infinitely more satisfying than the aching hunger he’d endured earlier.
“Attractive…hot…sexy…a hunka-hunka burnin’ love? There’s your problem…you can’t even say you find him attractive out loud. We have to get you over that right away! I’ll say this though…it certainly explains that little show between you two at the poker game.” I love the mortified and yet curious look that gets.
The passage wound to and fro, and while he was awfully near the chamber where he’d faced the basilisk so many years ago, he couldn’t have been farther away from it in fact. The map showed the great chamber to his left, and yet he’d walked almost half an hour to get to where he was at now. The gloom was oppressive enough that he couldn’t make out anything more than twenty feet away, but there was a faint twinkle ahead, and Harry knew he was quite close to Draco’s position.
Dear God! Is he? Like Harry…and me? I can’t help but turn back to him, and I can tell he sees the question on my face before I even speak it. He looks sad. Tired and careworn, but resigned.
After all the cocks I’ve seen and had shoved into one end of me or the other, whether I wanted them or not, it just defies explanation that after a few days and some good living, I turn back into a raging slut for the first cock that presents itself. At least it’s a nice one. I want to peel that towel off of him and…damn it…his pajamas are bulging again. I can wait. Tonight. I could indulge a little…if today goes well. If he’s as nice to me as he’s been so far. Maybe it would complicate things…but it can’t get too much more complicated than this, can it? Why shouldn’t I have what I want? Especially after the shitty decade I’ve had.
John Prewett rubbed his chin carefully, looking concerned. “That’s a bit off. I haven’t had that potion let me down before. I’ll check the batch I mixed up and see if it lost some of its potency. It’s usually very efficacious in cases like these, where Dreamless Sleep is too strong and can’t be used long term. I wonder if there’s a more pressing reason for your dreams than I’d expected. Hmmph. Anyhow…we’ll see. I might be able to mix it a bit stronger for you, but this potion doesn’t leave much room for error or for variations of strength. I’ll do my best…I can promise that. So what else is on your mind?”
DISCLAIMER: Warning! I make no claim to any property of J.K. Rowling's, and am in no way profiting by this. I do offer her my sincerest thanks for allowing us this garden of the mind in which we play. Further Warning! This story...and likely any I ever write…are dominated by gay themes and characters. That's how it is, if this in any way makes you uncomfortable...do not read further.
Both men were flaring nostrils, red-faced, and pinched with anger. Silence hung over them while Ron chewed his lip, sneering and grinding his teeth. Then Ron took a deep breath, exhaling loudly, and spoke with determined calm.
Dora cringed. The punch line would be terrible. It always was. Kingsley had many talents…but delivering great comedy wasn’t one of them.
The past week has seen so many little events, some mundane and dull, and some special only because they were ours to enjoy together. Doc Snape took me off the pills officially, and gave me most of my dietary favorites back. While the basic planning for the strike against the Urban Revitalization project took Harry’s involvement, the rest is in Hermione’s hands. The worksite for the development is under observation, and the trucks and wrecking balls and bulldozers are arriving steadily and moving into position. When the time is right, Harry will strike, but the time hasn’t come yet, and my visit to my father will be executed beforehand, mostly to keep it seemingly unrelated to events at the worksite. A simple bug will be dropped in Congressman Malfoy’s office, wherever I see fit, and then I can chat with him as long as he’ll allow and just go.
He stops at an ornate wooden door in one of the halls. No wonder he’s so fit, if he spent any time at all running through this place. The sloppy grin is still in place.
It’s been so long that I’ve forgotten how clean it smells to be outside. The stench of fear, hate and anger from thousands of men blows away on the breeze. It doesn’t seem real. I didn’t get to the yard much. Flint liked to stay near his cell or in the gym. I was always with him. The sky is dizzying. It goes up and up forever. There are a couple of other releases today. There’s a van to take us back to the city. Our papers include the locations of employment services that will place convicts, as well as charitable organizations, halfway houses and shelters. There’s also a black sedan with tinted windows a few feet from the van. The others are shuffling toward the van. I don’t know what to do.
When he was thirteen, his godfather took custody of him, and his eyes light up when he speaks of the man. This person, whoever he was, defined what Harry thought of as a real parent. That man died two years later, and Harry was sent to a military boarding school with the money that was left to him from his godfather‘s estate. That was where he figured out what he wanted, specifically that he liked boys more than girls by a serious margin, but he didn’t do anything about it for a long time to come.
It was a wonderful memory, and Harry’s silent swiftness to make certain of Draco’s pleasure had set the pace for their future progress. After that night, they’d taken to further experimentation along the same lines, learning to wank each other off, and practicing this new skill as often as possible.
It’s hard to tell because his skin is so tanned, but when our eyes meet across the table, I think he blushed! He did! I’d swear to it! He fucking blushed! I can actually feel my half dead ego inflating to new heights. I can make a stone cold killer blush…at six-thirty in the morning…while my hair is a mess and I’m wearing huge pajamas! Maybe I don’t know if I’ll stay or go…but I think this going to be a great day.
”Wait! How can I just…you know…have sex with man to find out if it ’works’ for me? Doesn’t that seem odd to you at all? It does to me! I mean…whole different kind of body. No breasts. No vagina. Different hips. Whole different sounding voice in bed. It’s just weird!”
The young man had already moved toward the door, but turned back with a smile that didn't seem feigned. "I do. It is the first time I could say that truthfully. It was just a difficult conversation. I'm still unused to this, but please don't think I am ungrateful. I am alright. If anything does trouble me, please know that I will seek you out. I hope you will excuse me?"
