“You know that I…” he stumbled. It wasn’t something they had ever really said, in his family. “You know that I—and I think you’re brilliant.”
“And, you know, I get it, I do. And you were angry. So… when you weren’t angry, in the Room of Requirement, or at the trials—what I mean is, it’s something I admire about you, actually.”
But then he doubted himself. Maybe things were pathetic for Draco, that were right for Harry.
“I was just—”
“We can’t have pancakes. It’s night time.”
“Every single thing I’ve learnt about you today has made me respect you more,” he said.
“Harry?” prompted Hermione.
“No need to get defensive.”
“Maybe I’m
Draco’s smug smile rivalled Blaise’s for sheer self-satisfaction.
“No,” he said. “Draco and I are friends.”
“Idiot,” he said. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to freak you out.”
“Did you… did you not know?” asked Potter.
. As if it grew straight out of her head like that, Malfoy-white.
Draco tried to speak, but couldn’t. His throat was so dry and raspy. He gestured for his notebook.
“You shouldn’t tell people,” he said. “She wouldn’t like it.” Then he looked to Ron and Hermione, easier than before. “She thinks of it as
“I just fancied a change of environment. All my flatmates are drug addicts.”
Draco smirked, and Harry realised he was just winding him up.
“I can’t be held responsible for your ignorance. Why are you thinking of doing cam work, anyway, if you’re loaded?”
Neville looked as if he had been inflated. Harry poured the tea. He’d settled on mint, because he thought that might be soothing.
“I’m sorry,” said Harry. “I shouldn’t have assumed…”
Draco stared at his phone.
“I can assure you that I will
He wondered where Mirth fit into all this.
“He’s pretty cute,” said Harry.
“The others will be back in a minute. You’re going to fuck everything up,” said Malfoy.
“It’s not my money. It’s Cassie’s.”
Draco tucked a strand of blond hair out of his eyes.
“They have Charms together, so after that, I guess? Luna reckons he’s just paranoid about bringing up bad memories.” Dean shook his head. “
Draco looked up at the ceiling.
“No, I just forgot.”
“I hear explosions. In my head. They wake me up,” said Draco. He didn’t know why he said it. He often found himself saying things he hadn’t meant to say, these days. He was losing his grip on himself. It was a fucking disaster.
“Harry! You’re so sweet to come, Draco will be thrilled. How are you?”
Harry thought for a moment, tried to formulate his feelings into words.
“Is he all right?” asked Harry, when Timothy went to bed.
Blaise continued to make sexual innuendoes and smirk at Harry until their food arrived. Then he became abruptly earnest again.
Except that it niggled at him, a bit. He took to staring at the Marauder’s map, watching when Malfoy retreated into abandoned classrooms with various boys. Sometimes, Harry even followed him. Malfoy knew he did it, because Harry would make fun of Malfoy’s sex life while they fucked.
“I don’t know,” said Malfoy, looking confused. “Don’t you have a lot of money?”
Pansy tried to fix his hair, and Astoria insisted that he take the cough-suppressant potion, even though each time he used it, it became less effective.
Draco trailed off.
Harry laughed.
“I’m sorry,” he said. “For how harsh I was, the last time we spoke.”
“Malfoy,” said Harry, gently, and he realised that he had never spoken gently to Malfoy before. Malfoy had been soft with him, sometimes, after sex, but Harry never had. “Malfoy, I’m not going to take her away from you. But I do want to be involved. I want to get to know her.”
“Draco?” Harry pulled open Draco’s bed curtains and hovered uncertainly. “Are you okay?”
“I don’t need help,” she kept hissing at him. He ignored her, and approached the Welcome Witch with an ostentatiously friendly smile, hoping she wouldn’t recognise him by his hair.
. It was such an unfamiliar adjective. Draco liked Harry’s goodness, liked how devoted he was to Teddy, liked that Harry understood Draco’s sense of humour (when he was Lamorak, at least), liked that he happily, easily entered into banter and jokes, even at his own expense. Draco just

love with me. But there are a lot of ways to love a person.”
“I know. But…” he glanced up at Harry with eager, earnest eyes. “The Department of Mysteries is operating at a loss, and I think I know how to fix it. A lot of it comes down to how they distribute resources. The trainee selection process is complete mayhem, from a financial perspective; I mean, it costs a small fortune to train each employee, and half of them quit anyway—if we could design some sort of test, incorporating muggle mental health research, we would be able to have a much more accurate idea of the kind of person who would succeed in the department from the outset—I’m boring you.”
“It’s late,” he said.
“There is pleasure in labour. Goodnight!” said Hermione, kissing Ron firmly on the mouth. Harry, Ron and Draco made their way up to their dormitory, Ron and Harry walking two steps in front him. Draco held back a little; he didn’t want to feel
“Timmy, there are plenty of hot people outside of this household,” said Draco.
“I take it this is a yes.”
“Harry!” he called out. Harry looked around, caught sight of him, and broke out into a sunny smile. He came forwards to meet Draco, his hands reaching and then pulling back.
“Oh, er, my place, I mean. I mean—you don’t have to come. You can go back to yours, if you prefer. But I thought there might still be Knutters after you? So I sort of got everything ready? But—”
Next to Harry, Cassie went very still.
Draco’s face was burning hot, but Ron didn’t mention it.
Draco snapped back into himself.
,” said Blaise. “What does it matter what I say about someone when they’re not there?”
Timothy seemed unwilling to go.
“Warm,” said Harry, putting his hand on Draco’s thigh under the table and squeezing. “Good for quidditch.”
“Was a Death Eater. No. I just don’t think he’d like me there.”
Draco did a sarcastic little wave, and Harry disapparated, his face burning.
“I love you,” said Harry. “Please.”
“You should,” said Draco. Harry paused in putting the sofa cushions back.
“How do you know I have questions?” countered Harry intelligently.
Draco huffed, but he did not move from Harry’s chest as he explained about the difficulties of halving a particular potion recipe, how it was all maths and Draco hated sums and the stupid potion probably wouldn’t sell anyway and he’d have to behead and debrain half a dozen bats tomorrow and why the fuck had he ever decided to open a potions shop in the first place?
Dean,” said Harry, who was trying to pull Seamus down from the ceiling by his ankle.
“Bad things happen all the time. It doesn’t bear thinking about,” he said.
And then he left, his steps jerky and wrong, and knocked hard into the edge of the doorway as he fled.
Then, from the hall, Harry heard the door open, and Ron exclaim
“Draco,” said Harry.
“Thanks,” she said, through her tears, then she sat up and poured herself into his lap. He pulled her up, tucked her head into his shoulder, rocked her, and waited.
It was actually a pretty good night for Ron and Hermione to stage their intervention. Draco was meeting up with Dean, so Harry was at a loose end, anyway.
“I’d like to thank you, by the way. Now that you and Draco Malfoy are friendly, people appear less inclined to be rude to me.”
Blaise paused, not looking round. He was still for a few seconds, then pushed the door silently open and slipped inside.
?” repeated Harry in disbelief.
At the third origami crane, Harry’s thanks was muted. This did not seem to deter Timothy in the least.
“You hurt him,” said Harry.
Draco shook his head violently.
“So… so, what, you’re dating Steven now?”
Malfoy really did sleep around, in eighth year. By the time Harry got to him, he had already slept with half the boys in the year, even the ones that Harry had always assumed were straight as a Roman road. Harry didn’t care; why should he care what Malfoy did with his body, when Harry was just using him to get off?
Adelaide was perfectly friendly that afternoon, when Harry came to teach her Stinging Hexes, as if nothing had changed between them, and Harry dared hope again.
“Yeah, that’s fair,” said Harry. Draco gave him a grateful smile, then shivered.
“That’s understandable.”
“…that’s true,” Ron was saying. “Romilda Vane hasn’t been stalking Harry this year, has she?”
he wrote. His handwriting was shit. It gave him a newfound appreciation for how lovely his handwriting used to be.
“He’s okay?” asked Dean.
He had lied about it, though, when Harry found him in the warehouse.
“I’m not going to fucking hurt him! He hurt
“As, as

“Are you?”
been poisoned by a wandering thought,” said Draco. “You should cut a fringe, Mirth. You look prettier when you can’t see your face.”
“Yes,” insisted Scorpius. “He was ashamed and no one would hire him and he had to find a muggle job and he didn’t know anything.”
“What? No, of course not,” said Harry. Malfoy gave him a peculiar look.
“Mind if I Pepper-Up?”
“No, that…” Blaise took an unhappy sip of tea. “Sometimes I see Malfoy, all right?”
Dean made the snide laughing sound again.
“Come on,” he said, and Apparated them to Grimmauld Place. Draco stumbled when they landed, and Harry caught him by the waist. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck. They stood like that for a moment, one of Harry’s hands clutching Sam Barker’s file, the other flat against Draco’s back, holding him close.
“I told Astoria,” said Pansy. Draco sat bolt upright.
“Yeah. Had a bit of temper,” said Draco.
“You seem better,” she said.
“Have you got any apple-flavoured ones?”
“This is stupid,” he told Harry, but his cheeks were flushed, and his eyes bright.
“Why I didn’t say anything?” asked Harry.
Draco’s lips parted in a silent movement. He seemed bewildered.
Harry curled closer into Draco’s arms. Draco kissed him on the top of his head, distractedly.
“Holy shit,” said Ron, sounding as if Christmas, his birthday, and his anniversary had all come at once. “It’s really him!”
“Messy, though.”
“No. Once lust is sated, the object of desire becomes loathsome. You are already too loathed to take such a risk.”
“What if you don’t,” said Draco.
“How do you…?!” said Sebastian.
“I don’t know about Dean Thomas,” Harry answered. “I haven’t seen him in years.”
“I’m so angry with him still,” said Goyle, starting to cry. Harry gingerly patted his Dark Mark. “But I don’t want him to die!”
“God,
“I can’t go back to Hogwarts.”
“Nothing happened,” said Harry.
“No, he wasn’t,” said Harry.
“It’s the same age difference you thought there was between you and L.”
“But you weren’t… you weren’t misreading the signals,” continued Draco. “So don’t beat yourself up, yeah?”
Draco didn’t answer, which confirmed Harry’s theory that it had been years since Draco had actually read one of his letters. He was clearly living life as a muggle. It would be difficult for him to receive owls all the time.
“Draco,” said Harry hoarsely. “I want to kiss you.”
I wanted, why can’t you see… oh, fucking hell, I should never have…I can’t…you’re breaking my heart…”
“What does it say?”
“Shhh,” he said, bringing the tiny, mewling creature into his chin. “You poor thing. You’re going to be knocking into things for weeks, aren’t you?”
“You’ve really got my number,” said Malfoy. He bit his lip. “Okay. So I can be a dick to you and you won’t mind. You might even like it?”
“Potter— stay. We’re just going to get drunk and chat shit. Stay.”
“They treated him worse than us, most of the time,” he said. “He was in over his head.”
Then he went out on a barge on the Thames with his friends and drank himself into a stupor by half past ten.
“Draco.”
“No!” said Draco. The explosions were worse when he slept in new places. “Thank you.”
“He’s all over the place, mate,” said Ron. “
“Iceland? Greenland? Some freezing North country,” said Ron.
, on a scale of one to ten?” asked Harry, once Misty was gone.
he wrote.
“Mr. Resnikoff fancies the pants off him,” Cassie told Harry confidingly.
“He’s sleeping.”
“Okay,” said Harry, his heart flipping over. What did it mean? Draco’s closeness, the way he kept
The silence that fell was loud, like the silence of leaving fireworks. They were in their tiny kitchen. Draco had been proud of himself, when he got the flat. It was little and shabby, and he had worked himself to the bone to afford it. His eyes darted around it now, looking everywhere but at Adelaide, trying desperately to focus.
“How can you tell?” he asked, as if he was testing Scorpius. Scorpius pressed the cloth gently to his father’s head. Harry knew how dittany stung when it touched a wound, but Malfoy didn’t make a sound. He barely winced.
fuck,” he said.
“What the hell are you doing.”
“I don’t know, do I?” said Harry. Draco smiled.
The first time Harry saw Draco Malfoy after the trials was at Zacharias Smith’s bizarre country manor house party.
When he was a little calmer, Harry kissed the bridge of his nose.
“Yes,” said Harry.
Draco bristled. He wasn’t an
“No, thank you. Say hello to Scorpius for me. I’ll write as soon as I know about Teddy.”
“Well, that makes me uncomfortable. Even my pants?”
Draco smiled rather bitterly.
“San Marino,” said Draco. “Vatican City.”
“Oh,” said Harry gloomily.
“I—” L’s tongue was caught by the spell. “During the—” Again. “You won’t—”
“Please don’t use some philosophical, parallel-universe bullshit theory to break up with me,” said Harry.
“That’s what your dad says.”
“That’s my condition. Take it or leave it.”
“Do you want to talk about it?”
“I’m sorry about your mum,” said Potter. Draco was seized by violent memories of all the times he had taunted Potter for being an orphan. He turned away.
“But…” said Harry, hesitantly. “But… you’d want to come to Inverness with me, if it weren’t for the money?”
“For questioning,” said Chief, grimly.
“Yes,” said Blaise. “I think Draco’s happy.”
“Aunt Pansy?”
“Misty. Darling. You have complete and unending permission to laugh at my jokes. I’ll find it very depressing if you don’t, in fact.”
“Because a lot of it is quite silly if you—if you haven’t bought into it. But—”
In Azkaban, where everything was the same, day in, day out, with the exception of Draco’s father’s increasing emaciation—there, he had noticed Potter.
“I turn into a cat when I’m stressed,” said Malfoy.
“Ow!” cried Malfoy, waking up with a start.
You can find me on Instagram and (newly) Twitter at @let_them_eat_books if you're interested in seeing the books I've been getting excited about lately!
But yeah, he was also pretty fucking handsome.
“Yeah, okay,” she said. She really looked completely different, now that she had the rent money. “He’s through there.”
, I don’t know what he’s like now. War does funny things to people.”
‘I ran away from home,’ says our hero. ‘I’m gay,’ he adds, because that might prove a deal breaker.
“I hate to see you sitting all alone every week,” she said.
Draco’s cheeks turned a bright red.
Adelaide had a pretty good idea of what it was like to date a man, or at least, a certain type of man. But what Draco and Harry had wasn’t like that. She watched them, and thought,
“Draco…” he said. Draco made a soft, surprised sound, that made Harry want to kiss him to death. But someone was blackmailing Draco, or whatever it was that had him panicking so badly that he preferred to take the cruciatus than tell Harry anything about it, and Harry had to find out what. “Stay here, okay? I have to find Hermione. I’ll be back as soon as I can. We’re going to sort this out. I promise.”
“Draco doesn’t talk about the war,” said Blaise, “but when he’s drunk he’s quite, quite open.”
Hermione smiled up at him, dazzling in her happiness.
“You spent six months with your arm in a sling because a hippogriff looked at you funny, but you won’t go to a mind healer when your mind’s literally breaking down?”
“Time’s up,” she said. “That was your boring quota for the year.”
“I was in LA.”
Harry laughed.
Potter glanced at him.
“Hi,” said Blaise, hoarsely.
“Do you worry about him?” asked Harry, as Timothy strode towards his blue-haired suitor.
Operation Rescue Draco?” asked Draco.
Draco licked his lips, a nervous gesture, the tongue ring briefly darting into sight before disappearing.
said Hermione.
“Not much of a secret, then,” said Draco.
“Wake up,” hissed Draco.
“Necromancy, then,” said Spooner.
Draco gave a tight smile.
Draco bit the side of his cheek.
,” said Harry, trying to get away. But it was no use, and anyway, the fact that they were freezing barely weighed against the fact that they were
“Okay,” he said, his voice hollow. “I’ll stay, then.”
“Isn’t he?” asked Hermione.
“You’re wrong,” said Harry, stepping so close that they were almost touching. “I was crazy about you. I
Harry froze.
“I should’ve just. I’m just. I’m sorry.”
So Harry did. In a little while he wasn’t angry anymore. A little while after that, he realised that he was hideously embarrassed, and dropped his hands away from Draco’s face.
“I get out,” said Harry.
“We’ll figure—”
“Yes, well,” said Hermione, slightly nervously, “under ordinary circumstances there would be an application procedure—”
“Mmmmm,” sighed Draco happily. “It works.”
“He used to spank me with a paddle,” said Draco, seriously. “And it made me feel humiliated, but also…” he rolled his shoulders, closed his eyes, parted his lips. Parvati’s breath got heavier.
“That first time, you said… It was about trust. Would you… let me?”
, Draco!”
“She won’t do it again,” said Draco. “She was just a bit upset. Can you get her back to Pansy’s safely?”
“It’s good to see you too,” he said.
“You’re a
“Yeah, that’s likely,” he said. “Because you’re both so independent and not-weirdly-obsessed with each other.”
He pulled away. Draco opened his eyes. He didn’t seem angry anymore, just frazzled, distracted.
Weeks later, when Draco needed to, he could not remember the kind and sensible things Hermione had said. They had worked like magic, sunk into Draco’s inflamed mind and quietened the barbed thoughts that curled there. Harry holding him, Hermione calmly and methodically talking him from the extreme to the reasonable. It had been the most wholesome gratitude he had ever felt.
“You must think I’m pathetic,” said Harry, pathetically.
“Affection,” he said, frowning.
“And you believed her?”
Draco had a little under two weeks left when the magical medication stopped working.
. They both froze when Harry opened the door, as if they had been caught doing something illegal.
“I’m just so scared something will happen to him,” she said, through tears. “I know you hate him—”
“You’re a drunkard. What’ll it be?”
“Harry,” said Timothy quietly. “You’re really bad at this.”
“That doesn’t sound healthy.”
He was thinking back, trying to decide where he had come up with the Malfoy-Adelaide relationship theory, where his proof had come from. The club, of course, but now that he knew Malfoy was her guardian, the memory took new form: Malfoy furious because Harry had been dancing with an underage girl, because the underage girl in question had sneaked out of his care.
“No.”
“Ginny? I thought—”
“He drinks less when he’s around
“Oh, all right. But I’m writing a Bucket List.”
Harry laughed.
“Of course you like me!” he said, one night. “That’s exactly what I wanted you to feel! It’s a fucking trick, and you’re guileless Gryffindors, so you all fell for it, like fools!”
“It’s just, Clarence took you to restaurants.”
“What?”
“You would have, if you had been in the DA. Remember how you caught us?”
“I need you to tell Professor Woodruffe about the memory charm. It broke the terms of my parole.”
“Yes.”
“Is there anything that helps?”
uni I’m at, for obvious reasons, but yeah, I’m an English student.”
“I’m sorry about the other day, Draco,” said Eve. “We wanted to be here so you wouldn’t be alone.”
“I’m not paying for you all year.”
“S’okay,” choked Draco.
“If I killed myself and donated my body to science I could probably save like ten people’s lives,” said Draco.
“Write that list.”
Well, it wasn’t surprising that Malfoy didn’t want to talk about anything to do with the war. Especially not with Harry. Harry decided to try something easier.
“Do you love me?” he asked her.
“You could wear the collar. It doesn’t fix anything but sometimes it’s nice to get out of your head for a while. It might help you sleep.”
“Yeah,” said Draco, too stunned to lie.
“Well, on that note,” said Harry. Draco chuckled lightly.
“You think I’m going to let you slither away to warn him that we’re onto him? You must be dreaming. Why did you come here, anyway, were you trying to get information on me?”
“I do stupid things all the time,” said Harry.
Draco couldn’t manage the clasp.
“Let’s take a gap year,” said Harry. “Let’s go bungee jumping.”
His jacket wasn’t by the door anymore; only the bags of groceries.
“I don’t think there is,” wept Draco, and there was no hiding it. His voice wasn’t fine. He wasn’t fine. “I don’t—I don’t want to die, Pansy, I don’t, I’m so scared, I’m so—”
Harry blushed and pushed away from Blaise.
“I think it’s quite good,” said Harry.
“Are you okay?” he asked.
Draco obediently held out a hand. It shook violently.
“Draco. Listen to me. You
“Astoria. The Ministry took everything. I’m barely clinging onto the
“What do you mean?”
“You’ve talked to Scorpius already??”
“No, that’s.” Draco smiled fleetingly at him as he let himself into the house. “That’s fine. Don’t worry about it.”
“Were you listening at the door?” asked Harry. Malfoy ignored him.
Draco took a sip of his whiskey.
Harry wasn’t quite sure what to make of that. In the end, it was the “sincerely” that decided him. He knew that Malfoy’s sign-offs tended to be meaningful, so he assumed that Malfoy was sincere in his willingness to meet up with Ron.
“Yes, he was very brave,” said Harry.
“Hey. Seen Draco yet?”
“Pre-Hays code.”
But the intruder held out his hand. Harry smelled it and recognised it. A clean, friendly smell. A friend, in fact. Harry licked the hand, and the man made a sound.
,” said Malfoy slyly. “
Tepre: Fine. Another party. With maybe, I don't know--just spitballing, here--some more kittens.
“Not going to exorcise me?” she asked.
“I didn’t do anything.”
5. I don’t think about them -
It was like the cottage, Harry realised. Watching Draco with Teddy had felt a bit like stepping into the cottage. It was a similar quality of feeling. A relaxing, a loosening. He noticed it, when he stepped out of the floo, and looked at the soothing paintings on the wall, paintings of landscapes that looked vaguely like the grounds around Hogwarts. He made his way up to his bedroom and he did not know consciously why he was going there until he was standing in front of Draco’s empty wardrobe, looking at the cardboard box at the bottom of it. He hesitated, then pulled it out and opened it.
“It’s rare. Only happens under a special set of circumstances. And if the wizard’s blood is really fucking pure.”
“Fledgeling’s just doing her job,” said Goyle, pulling boxers over his muscular thighs. Draco eyed them unhappily. It was disorienting to know that
“Right. You think if
Anyway, whenever Draco’s mother appeared when Harry was in the room, Harry always noticed right away and talked to him about something mundane until she left. Draco wasn’t sure how Harry knew to make her leave, but he was grateful all the same.
“Astoria!” said Draco, accusatorially.
Draco made a small sound, halfway between a laugh and dry sob.
But after a while, Harry grew uncomfortable with the fact that he still knew so little about Malfoy. It reminded him a little of Ginny’s experience with Tom Riddle’s diary. Ginny had poured herself into it, and received nothing in return. Harry answered Malfoy’s questions, but Malfoy grew distant when Harry asked him anything back.
“Sickeningly in love? Yeah. It’s gross,” said Adelaide, because it was. Mostly.
“The Prophet’s going to be awful,” said Draco.
That was another thing: Draco’s robes. Harry was almost certain they were new. They were the school uniform, of course, but there was something different about the way they had been tailored, all… gathered at the wrist and nipped at the waist and flowing everywhere else. They gave Draco the air of someone standing wistfully on a wind-swept moor.
“Yes,” said Draco. “I’ll take care of you. I love you.”
“So, you aren’t in love with me because I briefly considered the idea that you might not be in love with me?”
He spoke his piece, explaining how Malfoy had arguably saved his life at the Manor, how he had tried to stop Crabbe and Goyle from killing him, how he had lowered his wand instead of harming Dumbledore. Malfoy looked utterly bedraggled, but he sat tall, with his eyes lowered. He had only been in Azkaban for three months, but he was wasting away. Grief had evidently struck him hard. He did not meet Harry’s gaze, even though Harry tried to make him look.
“Draco’s really never told you all this?”
“Do you understand me?” asked Draco.
“I always liked how they looked, so I thought I’d buy one,” said Malfoy. He adjusted his jacket. “Actually, I bought four. I don’t really understand muggle money but I think, from how the shop people behaved, that I was quite extravagant.”
He took Dean to their rooms. Draco leapt to his feet when they walked in, and went very pale at the sight of Dean.
It was what Adelaide called his art. He designed potions for her all the time, like the hair dyes, and eye shadows that never smudged. He made her a perfume every year for her birthday, although that wasn’t really potions. Adelaide only wanted his cosmetic creations, which weren’t his favourite to make, but they had improved his technique. They had given him a focus on beauty, an understanding of how to make a potion elegant in its composition; clean. If only he could find some way to transfer that clarity to the pain elixir—if only his head would stop pulsing with thick throbs, like Tertius was still there, smashing him into a wall, forever—
Blaise and Pansy bodily lifted him from the bed and pushed him towards the door.
Draco’s jaw twitched.

don’t think that. But frankly, Mysteries has been operating at a financial loss for years now, and we desperately need some reforms.”
“To do
“Let’s go clubbing,” said Pansy, her eyes glassy and dilated. Theo Nott swatted her face again.
“You don’t think I
“Yes. You were insufferable.”
“Let’s go downstairs,” said Malfoy, and Harry heard the creak on the stair again. He turned on his bedroom light and started reading
“I’m going to tell them I can’t be godfather,” said Draco.
,” said Blaise.
“Okay, okay. He’s quite good. For a first year.”
“They’re just leaving,” said Harry. Ron and Hermione exchanged looks and got the floo powder down from the mantle piece.
for your opinions! Can’t you see she’s at death’s door?”
“You can be rude to me, Draco. There won’t be any repercussions, if you don’t behave well around me.”
His father’s lip curled.
“Harry told us about the way you sometimes ‘get lost in your own head.’ Could you describe what he means by that?”
He gripped Harry’s bicep and drew him towards the door.
When they got back to Grimmauld Place, Harry went to the kitchen and made pancakes.
“Yes,” said his mother. “It’s tricky. Of course, once you get to Hogwarts, you will widen your net. It’s dangerous for one person to have so much power over you. You need other people to love you. Then it won’t matter that he doesn’t.”
Pansy, because she was perfect, did not say anything. She just lay back down, said “Goodnight, then,” and fell asleep.
“I think he was awake. I doubt he sleeps well.”
and the mess disappeared.
Malfoy sipped his tea, watching Harry, and didn’t answer.
He was outlined in moonlight, but Harry couldn’t see his face.
“Oh, Draco,” said Michael, taking the water from him. “You’re okay, yeah? You’re fine.”
“You all right?” Harry had asked sleepily.
She appeared with a crack.
Hermione was laughing. It wasn’t the way she laughed with Ron and Harry, like the three of them were part of something. It was an affectionate,
Malfoy watched him with cold eyes as Harry finished making the tea, then said,
Goyle made a mournful expression.
“…yeah?”
“Yes, I think that’s probably best.”
“It would,” agreed Hermione. “Is he worth all that? Can you be sure?”
“Eve is under the misapprehension that her rudeness is charming,” said Malfoy.
“I’m not the one who showed up clearly still intoxicated from the night before!”
Malfoy shook his head and leant his hip against the edge of the sofa.
“I don’t think it will be long until they sell the manor. And I think it would be nice for Draco to have something to look forward to.”
“Yep,” said Timothy.
“I know. I’m sorry. Fuck, I’ve really cocked this up.”
thought Harry. It wasn’t something Harry would have expected. He would have thought that gratitude would catch in Malfoy’s throat, trapped by his pride.
“I already knew he hated you,” said Harry.
“Why?” repeated Draco in disbelief.
“They won’t fit properly,” he warned.
“I’m sorry you had to kill her,” said Harry.
Harry exhaled, half laugh, half exasperation.
They were both shirtless in Harry’s bedroom when Harry broke away.
He could almost hear Draco rolling his eyes.
“I wouldn’t
thought Draco. It was probably just too difficult for him. But he kept his mouth shut (that was something Tertius had taught him: when to be quiet, which, depressingly, was always) and waited.
She took a sip of her tea, then put the mug carefully back on the bedside table.
“I was never really…
“South America’s easy,” said Draco.
“Better than nothing, eh?”
“Something you did?”
Harry leant in and kissed him. Draco kissed back, pushing his body into Harry’s.
“Oh, Misty, don’t, darling, I wasn’t going to—”
“Thanks, Harry, you’re a pal,” said Steven. “Come on, Draco.”
“Why did you say you were in love with me?”
“Er, yeah, I hope that’s… okay…” said Harry.
“Is it true that Malfoy’s scared of me?” Harry asked Blaise. Malfoy was cooking something in the kitchen with Ron and Hermione, but Blaise never helped with anything if he could help it. He was ensconced in the sitting room with a gin and tonic in each hand.
They didn’t say anything else after that. They were silent when Harry washed Draco’s hair, when Draco got out of the shower first and held out a towel for Harry, then wrapped him up in it and stood holding him for twenty seconds. They were quiet as they brushed their teeth, although Draco did laugh when Harry dried Draco’s hair with a towel, tousling him like a wet dog.
Harry squared his shoulders, turned on his camera, and went live.
Pansy broke away her gaze and raised her glass.
it, baby!”
“Happy wolf day!” she said.
“Okay,” said Harry, standing up. “Does Tuesday work?”
“Fine. Whatever,” said Harry. “But you’ll back me up if I suggest this to him? The whole marriage thing?”
It was L who kissed him first, although Harry had clearly been angling for a kiss for weeks. They were in the Department library, and Harry reached past L to get a book, purposefully pressing too close. L turned around.
“One of those famous, sixteen-year-old criminal masterminds,” said Ursula.
Harry understood. Not all the Death Eater Catchers had been caught, and although public opinion had changed a great deal since Hermione passed the Reconciliation Act, people were often rude to Draco in the shop (BOOKS— Harry had worn Draco down in the end). Scorpius claimed he had nothing to do with the mysterious boils that bubbled onto people’s tongues all over Hogwarts if they said anything negative about Draco Malfoy. Hermione said it was an incredibly advanced spell, and that Scorpius had a promising future as an Unspeakable.
“I thought I meant it. I mean, I
“Well, I can see why he would have some reservations,” she said.
“You’ve never had Midnight Breakfast?” he asked.
She kissed him on the forehead, and disapparated.
boxes. Seized by an intense and sudden hopelessness, Harry took all the boxes and threw them in the bin.
“I’ll help. No need to play coy. It’s my house, after all.”
“Oh, come on, he’s hot as fuck,” said Ron. “I’m allowed to be
“I’m not sure this is healthy,” said Ginny, kissing him.
“I’d rather have one child with you than a dozen with anyone else,” said Harry.
Harry closed the door and turned to Draco.
“Is it actually, or do you just say that?”
The spell of stillness was broken. Malfoy strode through the platform barrier, heading towards the nearest apparition point.
“Yes, I know how friendly you were with my father,” was what came out.
Draco swallowed.
“Was that true in school, too?”
“Not sure there
Was Hermione pregnant?
“Modest,” said Malfoy.
tried to be happy, and look what happened to him!”
“Clearly, you need help,” she said.
“You know who I am,” said Draco.
“So let’s go out, then,” said Draco, dully. “Whatever you want.”
“All right, bugger off,” he said. “I really am going to figure out a filing system for you, now.”
“Er, no,” said Harry.
Harry told him that the ministry had doubled his stipend.
“Draco,” said Hermione, softly. “No.”
Draco nodded.
Draco sighed and put his hands to his eyes.
Harry frowned.
“Quidditch?” he asked. There was about a foot between them. It was freezing.
“Don’t look at me like that,” said Astoria. “He jumped on the idea. Elf liberation is very stylish just now. And all this will do wonders to clear your name.”
“What do you want?”
Blaise looked smug beyond words.
He knew what L wanted him to say, but Harry couldn’t say it. How could they know if they loved each other, when they didn’t know who they were? Harry
“Never mind,” said Harry. He wished he hadn’t thought of the wild spontaneous sex comparison in his head. It wasn’t helping. “Cool, okay, see you at school then!”
“Ravenclaw,” said Malfoy. “He’s in Ravenclaw.”
Draco grimaced.
love you!” cried Draco, and Adelaide looked as if this was the last thing she had expected him to say.
“How,” said Draco, tonelessly.
“Oh, come on, I poured my heart out to you! You can tell me a few measly secrets.”
“Of course. Why do you think I’d been put on duty with that man? They wanted me to prove my mettle. It was even more suspicious when he was painlessly killed, as well. I had to move all my plans up by several months; it was a fucking mess.”
“Yeah?”
This thought had crossed Harry’s mind, too, but he shook it away.
“She’s trying to impress him,” said Draco. “Do you remember when we met in Madam Malkin’s?”
“If you had just
“This,” said Draco, rubbing his thumb on Harry’s arm where it was draped around his shoulders. “I’m just fucking needy, I guess.”
“I don’t know,” he said. “Justin Finch-Fletchley told me he’d help me get a job in the muggle finance sector. Apparently they do pretty well for themselves.”
“Wouldn’t he?”
’? Or

“How come you and Ginny broke up?” he asked.
“Yes.”
“I know,” said Scorpius, miserably.
“I felt like a right dick being so, you know, when he was totally fine.”
” said Draco.
. She is—or she was—someone I thought of with pure and unadulterated affection, and the fact that that’s more complicated now is absolute shite, basically. God, am I the most boring person in this pub?”
“Oh, please don’t! You terrified him last time,” said Draco. He glanced at Harry. “I didn’t know you were coming, Harry, I would have—”
“Malfoy,” said Potter, struggling to free himself from the welcoming embraces of about a dozen house elves. “You going to bed?”
“Harry,” said Hermione, bursting in between them and throwing her arms around him, “oh,
“Why did you choose to come back?” he asked.
“Like a… a gathering.”
“Thanks,” he said. “Now fuck off.”
“Are you all right?”
Lamorak sat back in his chair.
Malfoy looked scandalised.
“Are you friends?”
“So?” asked Draco, as they filtered out of the church. “What did you think?”
Draco laughed, and Harry suddenly knew just what Draco had meant, in his letter. Harry had told that same anecdote to Ron and Hermione, and they had found it funny enough. But Draco’s eyes were bright with some feeling Harry recognised, because it burned within him, too.
“What?” said Hermione again.
“I just had a deep, meaningful chat with Harry Potter,” said Malfoy.
“Stay weird, Luna.”
“May I touch you?” asked Harry. Draco shook his head, so Harry took the flowers and put them in some water. When he returned to his sitting room, Pansy was sitting next to Draco, her arms around his shoulders, rocking him slowly side-to-side.
“How would you feel if I brought someone home tomorrow night?” asked Harry, and Draco flinched as if Harry had hit him. “If I fucked them in my bed? How do you think
I think you’re good, Draco.”
“I thought if I found you soon enough, you could catch them before they put Father in Azkaban.”
“Anyway, they were surprisingly receptive,” said Draco. “Don’t know why.”
Draco’s act was different, less ethereal, but equally lovely. He wore a crown made of tear drop crystals and a ballgown made of a special paper that disintegrated when water touched it. At first, Draco cried — although Harry could tell that he had used a charm to draw the tears out, because he had seen Draco cry before, and it was a much more heaving affair. Then, he thrust his hands into a bucket of water and ran them all over himself as he danced, until the dress and everything beneath it had been eroded away, leaving him only in some sort of diamante underwear. The lights dimmed, and Lucius clapped louder than anyone.
Draco hoisted himself up to sit on the counter, then tilted his head.
“No,” he said, soothingly. “Of course not. I’ll explain about you, Greg. Don’t worry.”
At midnight, when Harry went to the bathroom, he saw that Malfoy’s light was still on. He stood outside the door, wondering whether he should knock.
Harry left to fetch Draco a cup of tea. When he returned, Bianca was gritting her teeth, and Draco was still talking about grammar.
. “Not an aspiring screenwriter doing research into sex work?”
“That’s romantic,” she announced.
(See the end of the chapter for
“All right.”
“Please don’t,” said Draco. “She’s—I’m sure she’s trying to lie low.”
trustworthy, Weasel,” said Malfoy. “Try me. Tell me all your little secrets.”
“No,” said Harry, tugging him close. “Are you ready for the green light?”
“What the hell are you wearing?” asked Harry.
“I’ve informed the auror office, they’re at his flat now, collecting evidence,” said Ron.
“…what do you mean?”
“Speaking of me not-being-gay, I’m in love.”
“Fine, fine,” said Draco, clanging his tea spoon against his cup as he vigorously stirred yet another spoonful of sugar into it. Cassie laughed and flicked a rubber band at him.
“Ah,” said Blaise cheerfully. “Isn’t that nice. Friends.”

“Draco! How are you! How’s New York? Are you American yet? Do you live in a penthouse?”
“Okay,” said Draco. He couldn’t think, when Harry looked at him like that.
“Yes, you know, Dean’s always banging on about them. By the way, have you noticed how few muggle-borns we’re friends with, as a group? It’s a bit fucked up, isn’t it?”
“You’d just AKed a guy!”
“How long has he been stuck like this?” asked Draco.
“You want to grill me?” asked Harry nervously, as Eve took the bowl of pretzels out of his hands and pulled him to his feet.
“I can lend you—”
“You’re okay,” he told Draco.
“Well,” she said. “Thank you for your help, Mr. Potter. I’m sorry to have bothered you. Could I use your floo to go to my Aunt Pansy’s house?”
Harry pulled a Draco and started talking about how amazing the internet was.
“That, that would be nice. If you don’t mind?”
“Whatever you want,” he said, and left.
“I’m sorry. Steven had a liberal interpretation of what you meant by ‘when you’re done.’”
“I know what you’re trying to do,” said Harry.
“Do you feel like you can say no to me?” he asked. Draco dug his fingers into the base of Harry’s skull, working at the knots. He thought for a long time before answering, which was terrible.
Voldemort had never been more violent than when he was desperate.
Hermione came through the floo. Draco and Hermione had got on perfectly well, all the times they had run into each other since Draco started dating Harry, but that was because Draco had been on his best behaviour. He was keenly aware of how ragged he was now, how utterly incapable of being agreeable.
“You’re having lunch with Pansy?”
But this particular night, the alcove wasn’t comforting. He still felt… jumpy. He opened the window and clambered up into it, sitting with his legs dangling over the edge. It was cold. His breath came out in misty clouds, visual proof that he was still breathing. The stone of the window ledge was wet and gritty. It soaked through his pyjama bottoms. He shivered.
“Potter, you muppet, we haven’t stirred it ten times widdershins yet.”
When the door was shut, he pushed Malfoy against the wall, so hard that Malfoy’s head banged against it with a thud.
not going.”
“Stockholm syndrome,” corrected Hermione.
“Good, yeah,” said Harry. “And you?”
Draco sighed.
“I’m sorry,” said Draco, and he truly did sound it. “I don’t think I can.”
“He’ll get over it.”
It was that night that he realised what Draco had meant, at lunch. When he’d said he would stay. When he’d said that Harry seemed tired.
Someone paid enough tokens for Harry to take off his trousers. It was easier to take them off, knowing Draco was watching.
“I love you, Malfoy.”

“Harry,” said Blaise, and smiled weakly. “Yes. He will, won’t he?”
he loved L. He loved the way L moved in bed. He loved L’s quiet grace, and the way L took care of him as no one had ever thought to before. But he didn’t even know who L had just lost, and L didn’t know that Harry had spent his whole life fighting Voldemort and chasing after Death Eaters.
“You’re really going to die.”
“I believed a lot of it,” said Harry. “I didn’t think you deserved Azkaban, so I said the things your lawyer told me to say.”
“Food,” said Draco.
“Speak for yourself,” said Pansy, but she cast Astoria a glowing look.
Draco frowned.
“Pass.”
“I guess we called it that,” said Harry.
“This is my

“It’s crushed slugs,” said Hermione. “Go wash your hands.”
“Not just a drink. He wanted a bottle of rum. When I said it wasn’t safe for him to leave the flat, he asked me to go buy him one.”

do the therapy thing,” said Harry, after a moment of stunned silence.
“You’ve been better recently,” said Harry. Draco gave a little laugh.
Draco wound a silky strand of hair around his finger.
And Draco could never have abandoned her. Her loyalty condemned him. A week later, the Dark Lord called him to his presence and announced that Draco was to be granted the very great honour of the Dark Mark and a noble task. He had just turned sixteen.
“A friend of mine used to work here. Draco Malfoy. Ever met him?”
“Is my Dad okay?” asked Goyle.
“I’ll think of something,” said Hermione. “Okay? I promise. Just keep him safe here while I deal with the department. Take some time off work.”
“Harry!” said Nancy, pulling him into a hug.
“Shit sorry no think whatever you want!” said Harry. “I just meant, you’re not going to be able to move forward with that attitude.”
again,” he said.
“Harry, is that you?”
“Can you think of anything like that, though?” asked Harry. “When you were younger… did you ever wish you could defend yourself, maybe?”
to believe her. I decided not to believe her. Even though I actually did. It was some pretty complicated mental gymnastics.”
“It’s a bit much, isn’t it? No wonder Potter thought you were gay.”
sort of way. Draco dressed decently, but there was no way he could pretend he wasn’t trying. Which made days like today, when he looked like shit despite all his efforts, all the more depressing.
Harry dropped his hand and hoisted himself to sit on the counter.
“We have a deal. If we’re both single at forty, we’ll get married in a massive cathedral and make everyone buy us extravagant gifts. She’s really quit?”
Cassie frowned.
“Why did you do that? Tell the truth!”
“I know,” said Draco. “It’s not his fault.”

Timothy shuddered.
“James,” he said, and Harry felt a deep unease in his belly, along with a paralysing helplessness, because how could he tell Draco who he really was without Draco realising what that first session had meant? “James… I really appreciate this.”
“That was less funny than I thought it would be,” said Seamus, emerging from the cloak.
“I sympathise,” said Draco.
Draco didn’t text back, or pick up when Harry called. He hesitated to apparate inside. He decided to knock first.
Draco checked the cheerful clock above the stove.
And what a show it must have been. Draco’s shoulder blades strained to break out of his back, as if they might sprout into wings if dislocated. Pain coursed through him, brutal, beating, stinging, burning. It built and built; he had lost all control.
Timothy was in the kitchen.
“No, that’s still happening,” said Pansy. “Soon, in fact. Potter, drink this.” She handed him a shot. Harry downed it.
“Uh—”
“Is that what the kids are calling it these days?”
“I can’t go downstairs,” said Draco. “I told you.”
“You weren’t even looking, Draco.”
Draco closed
altitude?” asked Harry in a strained voice.
“Do you want to go somewhere more private?” he asked. Harry searched the crowd for Draco but couldn’t spot him.
“I thought it was perfect.”
“Sooner the better, then.”
. Potter, are you going to answer my question, or not?”
“It’s okay,” Harry would say.
“Yeah,” he said. “Like that.”
“Hmm? Oh, something came up. You might have to repeat the experiment another time.”
, so if you could refrain from being a massive dick again, I’d appreciate it.”
When he stood, he looked serene.
“Okay,” said Harry, immediately, and sent a Patronus telling Mrs. Weasley that he wouldn’t be coming either.
He handed her a notebook. It was filled with parties he would never be able to attend.
Draco’s expression grew serious.
, yet. And Lamorak was handsome, and clever, and witty…
“Astoria. Please. For the love of God. Do
“Pretend?” asked Draco.
“You… you were a coward,” he said.
It became more and more obvious with each passing moment that Harry was ignoring something crucial, something undeniable.
Not much changed after that. Their routine continued— trips on the weekends, dinner as a family each night, visits from Blaise and Ron and Hermione. Harry updated Ron and Hermione the moment he was alone with them.
“I’ll walk you through it.”
“I’m going out,” she said.
“What the hell are you playing at, Malfoy, telling Scorpius that this is all fine and normal? That you deserve to be treated this way? You’re giving him a complex, you realise?”

“You’re under arrest,” pointed out the Auror holding him.
“Well, that one’s on you, Potter.”
“No, it’s not even that.” He paused. “It sounds so dramatic. They, uh, suggested, they implied, that I would be safer in the muggle world than the wizarding. Which has so far proven true. So.”
Draco leant tentatively forwards, and their lips touched. Harry chased after the kiss. It was gentler than Harry had imagined it would be, and he realised he had imagined it a long time ago, long before he ran into Draco and Scorpius in Diagon Alley. He had imagined it the night after he almost killed Draco in sixth year, and after the Battle of Hogwarts when he thought of the fiendfyre. Maybe he hadn’t noticed imagining it, but he had. This was an old desire. This was a reawakening.
“Look at me,” said Harry. Malfoy turned his grey eyes to him. They were steady and emotionless.
“No, but that’s another thing,” said Hermione. “Harry and I have been pretending to have an affair, so if you hear anything about—”
. You just want to see your name in print.”
“It’s nice.”
“Friday.”
“That was inconsiderate. I’m sorry, Potter.”
“Because frankly, James, if you haven’t got a lot of money, you’re spending it rather recklessly on
“It’s all right to find someone sexually attractive without liking them as a person, Harry,” said Hermione.
“It’s not in any of your interviews.”
“Draco!”
“Harry…” Draco broke free and took a step away. His eyes met Harry’s with a burning look. “I can’t do this. I’m in love with you.”
“I like you more right now than I ever have before,” said Harry, passing him a cup of tea.
“But,” said Harry. “You never say—”
“Potter,” said Malfoy tersely, with a swift glance at Cassie. “Everything all right, Cass?”
“The other day—”
————————
“But I don’t want to declare him legally dead,” explained Draco, because Hermione had clearly misunderstood Draco’s position in this respect. “I want him to be alive.”
“You guys are the fucking worst.” Draco turned to Pansy. “So the whole house just
Pansy frowned at the table.
But when Scorpius got on the train, Malfoy took a step closer to Harry, so that they stood shoulder to shoulder, and Harry knew that Malfoy was glad he was there.

“Aren’t you cold?” asked Malfoy.
“Fuck off,” said Harry, and Draco laughed.

“I know,” said Timothy. “I wasn’t complaining.”
“You’d better go home, Cass,” said Harry.
Draco blinked, coming back to earth.
,” said Neville, at which Draco laughed bitterly and said,
“Draco…”
“Yeah, of course.” Harry got it out of his trunk and gave it back to Draco, who stared at it blankly for a few seconds before pocketing it.
and Harry had been utterly charmed to learn that Malfoy knew all the lines off by heart. Flora had thrown up in a pot plant, and Eve had drunkenly grabbed Harry by the collar and told him that he’d be hot if he stopped wearing hoodies.
Potter let go of him. His anger seemed tinged with confusion, now. Draco was feeling his right hand with his left— a nervous tick, checking it was all right. He forced himself to stop. Potter wasn’t Tertius. It would be a fair fight, at least, if it came to that.
“I don’t even know what that means,” said Harry. “He is irresponsible. He should not be allowed alone with Teddy unsupervised.”
Potter seemed slightly taken aback. He lowered his wand, looking almost sheepish, then shoved a piece of parchment forward on the coffee table. Draco let himself pretend to read it for a few seconds while his heart rate lowered. Fucking
Guilt like this was a physical feeling. There was an abstract sort of justice to the pain, as if Draco had cleared away the ache in Harry’s muscles only to replace it with a relentless pang in Harry’s chest.
to see him, so he made sure Dean came to Draco’s shows every once in a while. Dean and Draco were quiet around each other; wistful.
“I should go,” said Klaus. He was wearing nothing but an old quidditch jersey of Draco’s, and his penis peeped innocently out from beneath the hem.
“But don’t you think…” said Draco. “I don’t know. Don’t you think…”
, it’s going to make him so fucking uncomfortable. I mean, the reason he started being all dickish again was that I kissed him in the pub.”
In bed, the kitten kept trying to get closer to Harry, kept repositioning himself and shivering in strange, vibrating starts. Harry stroked his little head and murmured stupid things into his fur,
“Can I come in?”
“He and I spent a pretty rough hour together, yeah,” said Draco. “He kept using legilimens on me. I’d built up a wall around you in my head already, and he couldn’t tell what was behind it.”
“Ugh,” said Adelaide. “Honestly, I can’t with those bitches. I hate drama.”
anything!” cried Harry, but it was too late, and Seamus sprouted wings out of his head.
“Do you really think so?” asked Harry.
the secret! I’m
“Yeah?”
“Is this a good time?”
“Where are you?”
. Draco thought for a while about what it was that Ron needed from him, before he realised. Ron needed an opportunity to prove to Harry and Hermione that he’d matured. So Draco was cordial to Ron, and Ron was courteous back, and they developed a relationship not unlike that of work colleagues. When Ron stumbled and insulted Draco by accident— which happened with some frequency—Draco always responded with placid grace, to make it easy for Ron to apologise.
“Right. Well…good,” said Harry, who had come prepared to fight. Scorpius went to the desk and took Kingsley’s hand in both his own.
“What,
An hour later, they both lay on the cushions on the floor, lazily talking about nothing. Harry yawned.
Andrew, happily married. Malfoy, dating some beautiful girl. All these shitty people, finding each other, exorcising their loneliness. And Harry stood alone in a Muggle night club, dreading the full moon.
There was no one to celebrate with. He would see Ron and Hermione on Tuesday for bagels. He would tell them then. They wouldn’t be all that happy, in any case. They had both developed an unnerving habit of becoming
“So, I’m crazy,” he told Harry. “Absolutely off my nut.”
Draco tapped his fingers on his teacup, clearly confused.
“Yeah, okay,” he said. “If you want.”
“No,” he said, more confidently. “I don’t think Draco was spying on Mysteries. If he was, he wouldn’t have begged me to believe he wasn’t.”
“Tell me you didn’t defeat the Hammersmith Murderer with a pair of nipple pasties,” said Harry.
Draco smiled so easily when he saw Harry.
sorry for you, Master Draco.”
“Er, no,” said Harry. “I’m just happy Draco’s happy.”
boyfriend you’ve ever had,” he said.
“That you were shy but you liked me,” said Evan. “And that if I did anything you didn’t like he’d kill me.”
“Yeah,” said Draco.
“I wasn’t asking you to come,” he said, his voice going sharp and cold.
“Only because it wouldn’t mean anything.”
“No,” he said. “You were always just— I was your starter husband.”
“I need to talk to you alone,” said Malfoy.
“I’m sorry,” he said. “I’m glad we lost the war.”
Harry moved Draco out of the water and began to massage shampoo into Draco’s hair. Draco shut his eyes. He always loved when Harry stroked him.
“I’ve got some crazy pure Columbian shit, just in,” said Anika. She cast a quick spell so that no one would see them, then got out a small baggie of white powder. “Here, gum it.”
Harry went to the door, intending to knock, but something stopped him: Draco’s voice, low, pleading.
“Kreacher was sorry to hear about Miss Cissy.”
“It feels as if you have been investing more time in your personal relationships, lately,” said Kevin.
and had probably never heard the word “shit” before.
Kevin waited.
“I’ve still got three months,” he said. “I don’t have to tell him yet.” Maybe by the time Harry found out, Draco would be too ill to notice any further heartbreak.
Draco vaguely knew her by sight as Daphne Greengrass’ sister. She was a pretty brunette, but he had never really spoken to her.
“All hail the conquering lawyer!” he cried.
“Uh. Yes?”
“It’s an absolutely insane story,” said Draco sleepily. “I can’t believe you don’t talk about it all the time.”
“No thank you. Oh!” Malfoy jumped down from Dean.
Harry ignored him.
“Until you were,” prompted Harry.
“I would never forgive you, for as long as I lived.”
“Hey,” said Harry.
“We don’t have the time to follow the rules,” said Harry, and thankfully Bianca didn’t argue with him any further. It helped that he was the youngest divisional head since the 18th century.
So Harry just stroked his hair, murmuring into Draco’s ear,

“Cool,” he said, “I’ll be a blackbird.”
When Pansy awoke, she blinked confusedly at Blaise.

“I do want to,” said Harry, helplessly, because he
“We have a standing weekly chess date.”
“I know,” said Harry, again.
Lamorak sighed.
“You have some nerve, Malfoy.”
it only made everything worse.
“Brilliant,” said Malfoy, leaning into his computer and sending Harry a link. “We’ll start with Europe. I’m going to fuck you up.”
Draco felt as if he was coming back down to earth. Remembering who he was.
“How eloquent,” said Harry. “When we get home, you’re going to spend twenty minutes in your room by yourself.”
“I will take
“Boyfriend?” repeated Draco.
,” said Draco, his voice light and trembling. “Some girl asked if I wanted to come to the pub and I freaked out.”
“I don’t either,” said Draco. He looked so happy and relieved that Harry knew he’d made the right decision, even though a significant part of him wanted to tackle Draco to the ground and drag him to this bedroom.
“Is this where you live?” asked Harry. “It’s a bit shit. Aren’t you supposed to be some sort of millionaire playboy?”
“Yes. Is she even still in the country?”
. I’m your
“Draco. Seriously. I got off, remember? You still did your job. And…” Harry tried to put some fragment of the horrible, uncomfortable swelling in his heart into words. “…and you don’t have to be perfect all the time. I like you. I like seeing beneath that.”
“You’re the best person I’ve ever known,” said Draco. “You’re smart and kind and beautiful.”
“It might have done,” said Adelaide.
When he next woke up, she was watching him. Moonlight filtered in through the windows. He squeezed her close.
“How was he?” asked Harry.
“Fine.”
“Did he?”
“It’s not her birthday,” said Draco, sleepily.
“Thank you,” said Luna. “I’ve made you something, too.”
“You know how Draco told you he was in a white supremacist gang?”
“Just to see!” said Harry, and Draco looked utterly delighted, an expression akin to the one he used to get when Harry failed in Potions, but different in some key way.
“Thanks,” said Timothy.
“What,” said Draco blankly.
“I did,” said Malfoy, slowly getting to his feet. He swayed a bit. “Right, I’m off.”
Draco was instantly cowed.
“Please,” he said. “We’d broken up before, and the same thing always happened. He’d quit for a month or two, we’d get back together, he’d hit the wall, relapse, and lie to me about it for months.” He frowned at Harry. “You’re positive he’s sober? Because he’s a good fucking liar.”
“Yes?” said Draco. Clarence beamed, got back to his feet, and put the ring on Draco’s finger. The crowd cheered. Draco smiled, and once he’d started, he couldn’t stop, although he was aware that it was a slightly hysterical smile. He and Clarence hadn’t

“Promise,” said Cassie.
“‘didn’t work,” said Harry.
“And you still haven’t answered my question,” said Harry. “How is he?”
“Hermione helped.”
Astoria sat opposite him and pulled out a book of muggle poetry, a notebook, and a box of chocolates. She caught him looking at the poetry.
“I…” said Draco. His fingers flattened the powder through the plastic. They were trembling. He frowned. “How’ve you been?” he asked Anika.
“As I remember it,
“You’re going to kill yourself because of Tuvalu?”
“It’s my birthday,” he said.
“I can’t,” said Draco. “I’m going to an opium den with the Slytherins.”
“You mean it?”
you!”
He sent a patronus looking for him. A few minutes later, a great silver bear came pacing towards him.
“Cassie, cover your fucking ears,” called Draco.
“What?”
“Just…” Harry continued, “Draco seems always to know everything about everyone. Because he spends time with people one-on-one. So I thought I would try that.”
“Yes,” she said.
“You knew?”
“It seemed like camming was good for the loneliness,” said Harry.
“Yes,” he said. “Me, too.” He wrapped his arms around Harry and pulled him so tightly to his chest that Harry felt all sorts of secret, long-held miseries melt away.
“Hey,” said Harry.
“What?” said Harry. “He is! Ollivander’s been cagey as hell about training him to make wands. Do you want to be a shop boy your whole life, Timothy?”
them I forgave them,” said Draco. Harry smiled a little, his eyes full of sympathy.
“Fine,” said Draco. “Lie down. Don’t touch my hair.”
He was just thinking this when Draco’s slim, pale hand fell upon his wrist. Draco leant into his ear.
“I have to say my piece. I don’t want Harry to wake up tomorrow morning, filled with regret because he’s chained to a worthless war criminal—”
Draco sank back onto the bench, twitching.
“Will you go to sleep with me? Just sleep?”
Draco looked at his shoes.
“Percy, I told you to leave it alone,” he said.
“I hate getting
“Okay! Fine. But I wasn’t reproaching him, you know,” said Harry.
“That’s how they were so rich. You were managing their investments,” he said.
Harry all but ran out of the room, closing the door gently behind him
“I don’t resent you,” said Harry. “Is that what you think? How can you ever relax around me if you think I secretly resent you?”
“Kiss me,” said Harry, and Draco huffed a quiet laugh before obeying.
spoken to him about his childhood. Rather at length, in fact. It had never occurred to him that he was hearing
Draco went to bed early, without saying goodnight. His mind caught itself up in knots.
“And I know you’ll call me stuck up, but I think a lot about my biographies. Dumbledore’s biographies are packed all the way through—” (Draco blinked several times when Harry said Dumbledore, but he stayed present.) “—because Dumbledore accomplished just as much at the end of his life as at the beginning. But my biographies will be top heavy. It’ll be twenty chapters to cover my life up until 17, one to sum up the rest.”
“You won’t spontaneously become gay if you see a man in a thong, Ron,” said Harry drily.
Harry was blushing. He hadn’t thought too much about what he wrote to Scorpius. He certainly hadn’t expected Scorpius to
“Draco.”
“Malfoy,” said Harry cautiously. He was trying this new thing where he didn’t hate people. It wasn’t going well. He hated everyone.
A week after the break-up, Harry had spotted Draco Malfoy in a supermarket. It had felt like fate: like Harry couldn’t possibly trust anyone he hadn’t known before the war, and now here Malfoy was, gorgeous and quiet and smiling.
When Harry woke up in the night, Draco sleepily said, “come here, darling,” and welcomed Harry into his arms. “You’re okay,” he said into Harry’s hair, as Harry trembled. “Poor thing. You’re okay.” But when Harry had calmed down, and said, “Draco?”, Draco had fallen asleep again, and didn’t answer.
“Shut up,” said Draco, shoving at him. “You don’t know me.”
Draco and Adelaide showed up at Grimmauld the next time Harry was due to transform. Adelaide held out a plate of steak with a winsome smile.
“You,” he said.
“I need to go with him!”
“She said you didn’t always have enough to eat,” he said.
“You’re straight.”
“I know you didn’t, you inept git,” he said, as Draco tried to get away from him. “Merlin, I thought Harry was crazy at first, but you’re all right, aren’t you?”
“I think Cassie knows exactly how much you love her.”
“I don’t need a bath,” said Harry.
“Sorry to interrupt,” said Harry.
Blaise looked uncharacteristically lost for words.
“Lie down,” said Draco again. “Don’t touch my hair.”
aurors!”
Harry stared at him.
“That was probably an exaggeration.”
“What’s wrong with me?”
“Sorry,” she said.
“Wrongly accused. Got it.”
“It will,” he said.
“I know. But I still think it’s our best option. He’s not wrong: he really hasn’t got much to live for.”
Scorpius leapt to his feet.
“You fool. She was probably just lost in thought, hatching up
Draco turned to the kitchen cupboards, looking for mugs with tight-lipped determination.
Draco helped him pour over newspaper want ads and draft out a CV.
“You and Potter on one team is going to be one hell of a draw,” said Mirth. “I bet within a year, you’d be making enough to keep the manor.”
“What sort of thing?” asked Draco. It was intimate to have his voice in Harry’s ear.
“I have later gigs occasionally, I’ll let you know next time.” Harry heard Draco stretching over the phone, and wished he could see it. “Although they’re always boozy disasters, I’ll be honest with you. I have a special act I do with a late night crowd.”
“Because you’re being fucking stupid,” said Harry.
“That’s just because he feels threatened,” said Harry. “Once he realises—”
hiking. His hair grew dark with sweat. He slipped down a hill in his impractical shoes and got cut up by brambles. His nose turned pink with sunburn. Harry took a photograph of him, laughing.
“I hope you’re not getting hung up on the idea that Malfoy’s up to something again,” she said.
“I’m sorry,” said Luna, her eyes soft.
,” said Hermione. “That’s why he stopped spiralling after your trial. You make him less lonely.”
“His mother despairs of him,” he said. “He’s incredibly rude to his teachers.”
“You’re not my slave,” said Potter, uncomfortably.
“James, darling, I’m very happy to talk about your self-esteem issues, because they seem wild. You’re hot, you’re sweet, what’s the problem?”
“Love,” he said.
Harry was going over some old case files in his sitting room when Lamorak stepped out of his fireplace.
“It’s nothing to do with him,” he said. “He wasn’t even born.”
Hermione looked at him with pity.
“And I have work tomorrow,” said Hermione. “As you know.”
Three weeks passed slowly, despite how busy he was.
“I’d like to go home now, please.”
“Look, it’s complicated,” he said. “I felt sorry for him, you know?”
Harry made a small, outraged sound.
“Cool,” said Ron, wide-eyed.
“What’s going to happen to them?” asked Harry.
“I know,” said Draco. “Yeah.”
“You’ve always scared me. Even when we were kids. You’re fucking terrifying. ”
“Yes, I can see how it might be. Thank you for telling me, Draco.”
Blaise Zabini opened the door almost immediately. When Harry first moved into his new flat, the fact that Blaise Zabini lived across the hall had been disorienting, horrible, and wholly unfair. Harry suspected the real estate agent had
“Can I move my stuff in here?” asked Harry, after they had been sleeping together for a month.
“Visit him?” said Harry. “Seems a bit… I don’t know. Weird.”
“Maybe, but I don’t want you not to do things because of that. You’d be a good godfather.”
“Hang out?” asked Draco, blankly.
“You’ll arrest them all, and then you’ll arrest Mr. Croome,” said Timothy.
Harry went to Dinsmore’s shop. Bland-faced Cynthia told him Draco wasn’t around. He went back the next day, and bland-faced Cynthia told him that Draco was busy. On the third day, he caught Dinsmore.
“Did you mean
“Harry… something you said after the Reveal—”
“Valerian root,” said Malfoy. “My mother makes it for me when I can’t sleep.”
“Draco gets out in three weeks,” said Harry. “I want us to all get a drink together, or something.”
“Exactly. Anyway. So then, Mad Eye Moody came for me…”
“Too right. Come on, Harry.”
“You’re shaking,” he’d said, and escorted her out, put his jacket over her shoulders, helped her climb over the gate of St Pancras Old Church Gardens. He settled her between his legs, propped up against a tombstone, and held her as she cried. And suddenly, strangely, he had reminded her of Draco—his calm voice, his gentle fingers stroking her hair, the way he rested his chin on the top of her head and didn’t try to speed her tears.
“Well, Greg certainly doesn’t like me anymore,” said Draco drily.
“Yes.”
“If I tell you, you have to promise you won’t, you won’t try to, to report me or—or to get her taken away from me,” he said.
He was perfect.
“Does Michael ever ask about me?” he asked, his voice thin.
have kidnapped him,” said Ginny. “He’s not an easy one to capture.”
“Banoffee pie!” said the waiter, brightly.
“What’s wrong?”
“Nervous.”
“I like them,” said Draco, still looking at the ceiling. Cassie swiped the box, opened it, and ate a chocolate.
“I’m fine,” he said. “It’s fine.”
“Were you going to
“No, you won’t.”
Draco Malfoy. He had let
“It’s Dark Magic,” said Draco, bitterly.
They tumbled their way to Harry’s bedroom, stopping every other step to press against each other in a fervent panic of love, both reassuring each other—
—————
“Really?”
“Yes,” said Harry.
“You can have it, if you want.”
“It looks wonderful,” said Draco.
That said, the casseroles people kept bringing over were nice. Pansy slept over for a whole week after the Memorial Service. They got so drunk that later Pansy said they had had sex, but Draco was 90% sure they hadn’t. It would have been cheating, because he was still married, even if no one else thought he was.
“He’ll be home any minute. And you need to go.”
“A few of your sweet kisses will set him to rights, dear Draco.”
“So what’s going on with the bond?” asked Ginny, as if nothing had happened. “Are you reinstating it?”
did,” corrected Draco.
“I like this,” said Harry.
“Maybe,” said Hermione. She sighed. “I wish I could see the two of you together, it would be so much easier to gauge.”
“Because…” Harry tried to find words. “Because I wanted to?”
Draco pushed his nose into Harry’s neck.
“I know,” said Draco. “I would never expect that of you.”
Harry spent the next few days gloomily reading letters from his pile on the dining room table. The house had organised them for him, and arranged them on silver salvers he didn’t know he owned.
“Not since school,” said Draco.
them not get back together.”
“Hello,” he said. “I… It’s good of you to see me.”
Harry put his drink down too, and let his leg fall further against Draco’s.
Malfoy propped himself up on his elbows.
“Because I don’t want to. And even if I wanted to, violence is never the answer.”
“What?”
Harry went to bed, but couldn’t sleep. At midnight, he heard Timothy laughing and stumbling up the stairs, and Draco shushing him.
“I’m just wondering how everything’s going with the whole prisoner’s bond,” said Ginny. “You wouldn’t believe what people are saying.”
“Oh, I is glad, sir. You is
He shut off his floo, locking Harry out.
“Please don’t hit me,” said Draco, and the rage worsened, or became something else, something wilder and sadder and more like
He stopped short at the bed, his face working, then turned to Harry.
“No,” he said, wishing she would leave.
“Draco!” said Harry.
“That’s because you’ve got a hand full of thumbs. I don’t know how you manage to do your shoelaces, you’re so clumsy.”
The silence in the dormitory was piercing. None of the elves would meet his eye, except Flotsam, who tilted his chin up defiantly.
“Hermione doesn’t agree with you,” said Harry.
“Draco— I didn’t know— I swear—”
“No, come in,” she said. Draco reluctantly obeyed.
Draco wasn’t sure what that look meant.
“Well, aren’t you pure of heart.”
“It was an accident! I was drunk, and he was… he was just
“The guilt fucks him up, you know? He wants to make amends, but he doesn’t want forgiveness. Or to look like he thinks he deserves forgiveness. I think it’s all bollocks, personally.”
“Sorry,” he said. “I didn’t mean cute. I meant
“Oh, God,” said Draco, starting to cry in earnest now, but he rifled through the cupboards until he found a tea caddy. He put the kettle on.
“Er, no,” said Draco, and laughed. “But. I’m all right. It’s good to hear your voice.”
But this didn’t seem to reassure Scorpius at all. He threw himself onto Malfoy’s lap (Malfoy’s arms drew instinctively around him) and pressed his cheek against his father’s. Blood stained his icy blond hair.
“No, I mean, I used to be good for a lot of things—”
“But sir… what about after the apprenticeship?” asked Harry, when he was quite sure that Croome was a) enamoured of him and b) going to move his hand higher up Harry’s thigh if Harry didn’t get out of there soon.
“No, he was glad you came,” said Harry.
Draco just about managed to nod. Harry attached the collar, and had barely shut the clasp when Draco transformed, as if all he had been thinking was
“Oh, that’s no problem,” said Hermione dismissively. “Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. We used it in second year for polyjuice potion and it was fine.”
They were away from the topic of last night. Draco felt the compulsion ebb away.
“I think it embarrassed her.”
, I’ll admit,” he said. “But… in all seriousness, Harry, I was worried about him. I see now that all my scheming has come to nothing, but it was worth it if there was even the smallest chance it would…” he twisted his mouth. “Change the path he was on. But it didn’t. So. Are you going to put me in prison?”
Draco smiled wanly.
Harry ended the session.
“There is nothing that could happen between me and Blaise that would prevent him from helping me if I really needed it,” said Draco.
“It’s none of their business what you do with your body,” said Draco. His voice sounded too fierce. He tried to calm himself. “It’s no one’s business. It’s
Seamus turned out to be a much more trying housemate than Pansy. He did, indeed, blow things up on nearly a daily basis, and it became much less funny when Harry realised the degree to which it was true, what Pansy had said. That he was doing it on purpose. Or, more specifically, that he was purposefully and recklessly not trying to preserve himself. Harry once caught Seamus closing his eyes before he crossed a busy street.
“They had that cider you like,” he said to Harry, passing him a pint.
“I is never speaking to him, sir.”
“I tried to,” said Draco. “Because… because you had told me I deserved to be happy.”
“I knew you didn’t want
selfless,” said Harry.
“Well, that’s time; see you Wednesday? And tomorrow I’m going to be reading Marcus Aurelius’
“Why didn’t you
“And what did you say?”
“Draco always said the people attacking him were enemies from prison,” said Nick.
Draco very carefully finished swallowing his mouthful of bread roll.
Harry wanted to pull away, but at the same time, Draco’s breath on his skin was making him prickle deliciously all over. Draco laughed softly.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake, Potter,” said Draco, immediately, but Steven interrupted him.
“I loathe it. Say what you like about dying, but it does add a certain
Draco lifted his eyes wearily to the ceiling.
“I am beginning to revise that theory,” said Draco, trying to sound unconcerned. He picked up one of Mirth’s perfume bottles and sniffed it.
“You’ve never been to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes?” asked Teddy in disbelief. Scorpius shook his head. “You haven’t
“I’m not,” said Harry.
Harry shook his head.
“Thank you,” said Draco. He barely had give in to the compulsion. He was sincerely grateful. It was harder and harder to tolerate the cruciatus curse, because his entire body was so sensitive.
Pansy shook her head, her lips curling into a loathing sneer.
“Just remembered something I did,” said Draco. “Go back to sleep.”
Draco opened one eye blearily.
“Take him to the station for me,” he said, sounding resigned.
After about forty-five minutes of this, Harry knocked on his door. Draco opened it almost immediately. He was still fully dressed.
“Yes,” said Scorpius. “Dad’s told me all about them. Well, more about your dad,” he said, turning back to Teddy, “because he had him as a teacher, of course. He said he was the best Defence teacher he ever had. Did you know that for their end of year exams, your dad made a sort of dark creature-obstacle course?”
thought Draco, rather stupidly.
“Can produce corporeal patronus,” wrote Draco, biting his lip in concentration.
“Yes. And I’m starting tomorrow. No time to waste.”
“Maybe you will,” said Harry, “maybe you won’t.”
Please don’t do this,” said Draco.
“She seemed like the only war hero I could talk to without getting punched.”
“I can sell it?”
Draco blew out a mouthful of smoke.
“I… maybe. I don’t think so,” he said, because nothing about Malfoy was simple, and yet Harry wanted him more than anything.
“Fuck,” said Harry, grinning. “Really?”
He didn’t have a way to contact Harry as Lamorak, so he went to see Luna. He took the tube, texting Jack when he had signal to pass the time. (Books were beyond him. He had read twenty off his list of fifty. He tried not to think about it.)
,” said Draco, and he raced into his bedroom, slamming the door behind him.
“Yeah, well, I don’t know the whole story between you two, I didn’t want to put my foot in it.”
Draco opened his mouth to say something, seemed to think better of it, and went to the kitchen to make a fresh pot of tea.
When it was time for them to go, Teddy hugged Scorpius and said he’d see him on the train the next day. Scorpius then held out his hand to Andromeda.
You think that’s relevant? Are you serious?”
anything.”
By the time Malfoy showed up with his potion for Harry’s next weekly dose, Harry was a mess of tumbled feelings. But the one that was foremost was pain, and Malfoy was a cure.
“…they were getting off,” he heard Theo telling someone. “Draco and
It probably
“Very likely.”
“Someone important to me,” he said, and then looked surprised that the spell had let him say so much.
“I’m looking forward to it.”
And his friends were more numerous, and had never done anything to deserve being hurt by him.
“What were you looking for, anyway?”
Draco thought of Seven, telling him to breathe in, breathe out, but it was hard, because his throat had closed up, and he was suffocating.
“What? No,” said Draco. “I’m gay. I thought we talked about this already.”
Pansy’s neat black hair kept getting blown into her lipgloss. They looked at each other quietly for a moment.
“Harry
“Draco… you’re not just messing around before you go and marry some pureblood girl, are you?”
After lunch, Blaise took Harry to the cottage in Godric’s Hollow.
“I saw his favourite biscuits in the shop the other day. They’re French, usually nowhere carries them. And I had this moment of thinking, Oh, I’ll get them for him and he’ll be so pleased, and then I remembered.”
” said Draco.
“With—
“I’ll see you soon,” said Harry.
“Okay,” said Harry. “That’s not what I want, but okay.”
“Don’t you think she’d be pleased?”
“I like taking care of you,” said Draco, and Harry nuzzled into his shoulder.
“I can move out,” said Draco.
“I don’t follow your logic,” said Draco.
“Yeah,” said Harry, breathlessly, “I missed you, too—”
“Yeah,” said Harry, pushing his hair out of his face. “Yeah, you’d really think they’d be onto me by now.”
Harry. He liked him, and he loved him.
“Fine. Go on.”
“I went to get Harry a glass of water,” he was saying, mechanically. He was barely conscious of the words. The potion drew them out of him like poison. “When I returned, Steven Hodges was with him.”
,” said Ginny, sounding bored. “But I knew that Steven says he is, yeah.”
“You still want me to come?”
She trained him for hours at a time. She filled him with theories about people, about what they wanted, about how to make them love him. She was so frightened no one would love him again. Draco understood that her fear was grounded in guilt, but he wished she wouldn’t say it so often.
that, do you believe them?” asked Draco. Harry shook his head. Draco’s mouth jerked into a smile and Harry was suddenly aware of how very, very close their lips were.
“Yes, I haven’t forgotten you
Ok I know I said this was silly but then I accidentally gave Draco a bit of an anxiety disorder so, uh, sorry about that
Finally, Harry tried the garden.
“Shut up, Potter. I don’t care that Pansy says there was some sort of Shakespearean misunderstanding. I don’t care that you’re quote unquote
“Right,” said Harry. “Er, thanks.”
“I wasn’t trying to seduce—!”
“No,” said Harry.
“But don’t take the piss,” he said. “I rescued you from Azkaban, you know.”
“Yes, that’s what I’m known for: goodness. Go pick up Cassie, would you?”
“It means that you’re not going to spontaneously revert to being a Death Eater if you hurt me for five seconds during sex,” said Harry.
“Then what
He spent that evening pulling out every item of clothing Harry owned and dividing them into “acceptable” and “please donate to someone you dislike” piles. Harry thought it was all a load of bollocks, but to his surprise, it really was easier to get dressed in the morning with L’s new system. It was even easier to be stylish, because L had paired together likely outfits. Hermione and Ginny both remarked on Harry’s newfound sense of fashion, and Harry felt better, sexier.
“So you’re…”
“Sirius Black was in my family,” interrupted Draco. “He figured it out.” Draco pulled his hand away from Harry’s face. “Goyle’s fine. It fucks me up that he’s in Azkaban and I’m not.”
Harry’s expression hardened.
“Hermione, come on, you have to admit he’s changed.”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Uh, is there a cashpoint nearby?”
“Very sensible suggestion,” said Draco.
Draco nodded.
Harry went to the window and leant his head against the glass.
Robards glanced over his report.
“Th-thanks,” said Draco, not that he was willing to let himself be loud around Potter, either. But Harry stroked his back as Draco shook.
Blaise had started being publicly friendly to Draco—although only tentatively, coldly. He and Etta bought a house and threw elaborate parties, and Draco was always invited. Draco went because he was curious about Etta, and soon wished he hadn’t. Etta was lovely. Not nearly as clever as Pansy, but considerably kinder. She was generous and hospitable, and went out of her way to set Draco at ease.
“I don’t love him,” said Harry, automatically.
“I’m sure I’ll be able to persuade her eventually,” said Lucius. “She’s rather old-fashioned, as you know.”
“No,” said Harry. He started dressing.
“I bet you’ll be able to think about them, eventually,” said Harry.
“Harry,
It wasn’t difficult for him to get into politics. He quit his job. He was elected for the first position he tried for, by a landslide. Hermione was delighted, and helped him with the reading. The first chance he got, he convinced the deputy-head auror to reopen Draco’s case-file, and see if he couldn’t find out anything about the people who had beaten up Draco and his mother.
Draco tried not to show his dismay. He took out his wand and pointed it at Harry with some difficulty, because Harry had his hands clasped at the small of his back.
Draco moved his head, noncommittal.
“What sort of question is that,” said Draco, faintly.
Harry could feel the different threads of him pulling at each other. The wolf in him was furious, wanted to throw the plate at the wall and then push Draco up against it and show him that he wasn’t to belong to anyone else, only to one person, only to Harry. The normal,
“I hate this place,” said Draco.
Luna shook her head.
Blaise raised one eyebrow and leant back in his chair.
It was good to be back in England. He had missed clouds, and decent chocolate, and being able to order tea at a coffee shop without having to patiently walk the barista through the process.
“No,” said Harry. He couldn’t take his eyes off Cassie. “Cassie, there was a misunderstanding between your father and me, when you were born. I didn’t know about you. I didn’t even know wizards could get pregnant. If I’d known, I’d have been there every second.”
Draco looked at Harry as if he was only just remembering he was there.
“Oh,” said Draco. “Because—I don’t know. It caught my eye. It seemed less abhorrent than the rest of your decor. Only briefly. Is that the only font they had?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, stroking his hand slowly up and down Draco’s back.
Draco actually looked over his shoulder, as if he thought Ginny fucking Weasley might be standing behind him. She wasn’t.
“It’s not a problem,” said Draco. Pansy looked stricken.
“We could try it the other way round,” said Harry. They were in bed, even though it was eleven o’ clock in the morning.
“Your accidental magic makes your books lighter? You really are a Ravenclaw.”
Harry lit a fire in the fireplace with his wand and drew the curtains across the mullioned windows.
So for Malfoy to try to prank him was out of order, really, and Harry was well within his rights to prank him back.
Malfoy smiled ruefully.
“I actually think it’s the nights, really,” said Draco. “I don’t think he’d want me to sleep in his bed so often if he hated me.”
Harry stroked along Draco’s jawline, kissed him softly.
“Check the cabinets for Valerian tea, my sweet. This is a Black household, I’m sure Kreacher will have it in stock.”
“You’re mad,” mumbled Draco.
Harry lifted his head.
He grabbed Harry round the waist and pulled them hip-to-hip.
, of all people.”
But Draco was scared of telling Adelaide. She seemed so much better, so much more confident. He was terrified that he would tell her he’d been seeing Harry, and she would spiral into believing she was second-best, unloved, useless. So days passed, and he still had not told her.
“Er, sorry,” said Harry, sitting up. “Thought we were having a moment.”
mystifying. He had gone, apparently, from Chosen One, the Boy Who Lived, to… cake farts guy? When had that happened? (“He’s just fucking with you, Harry,” said Ron, when Harry tried to subtly find out if there was a way he could give off a less cake-farty vibe. “Ignore him.”)
“That’s pretty extravagant,” said Harry.
“Well, the spell seems to have worked. I will send over an informational pamphlet that ought to answer any questions you might have. You are both free to go.”
“No rush,” said Potter, and left.
Draco patted his chin.
“Mother will be devastated,” he said.
“You want proof? I’ve got it right here, baby.” He held out his phone to Harry and Ron.
, he died because of
Back in Grimmauld Place, he missed L with an ache in his chest. If L were there, Harry could have explained— something. He could have said…
“Shut up!”
“Your roof will cave in,” said Jaggers, who was, in Draco’s opinion, a real cunt.
After he had
It took him almost a month to realise that all of his friends were meeting up with Malfoy behind his back. He was at Sunday lunch at the Burrow, and as George left, Hermione said,
Potter turned his head away. His Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed. Draco watched it in fascination.
he decided.
“I’ll go, then,” said Harry.
Draco paused.
“At first, yeah! But then she’ll get used to it! That’s how change works. So will you please stop
“I love you,” he said.
“It’s… you’d know, if you watched my memories.” Draco tried to burn his eyes into Harry’s, so that Harry would look at him. It didn’t work. Harry made an impatient sound.
“Drinking alone is the first sign of a problem,” said Blaise, falling into the seat next to Harry.
L was silent, stroking his fingers listlessly up and down Harry’s arm.
Draco stared at the painting for a long time, almost without blinking. Harry stared at Draco. Finally, Draco wrote in his notebook.
“Timothy, will you…?” said Harry.
“What,” said Potter. He looked tense, as if he was about to start punching something. But Draco knew he wouldn’t.
Draco shrugged nervously. He
“He’s cute.”
Harry was a little late one afternoon—Ron and Hermione had had a fight, and Harry had spent two hours trying, very mildly, to convince Ron he had been a prat, only for Ron to suddenly realise it himself and go rushing home.
“Potter,” said Draco hoarsely, when Harry released him. “What the hell?”
“Mmm,” slurred Adelaide. “What took you so long?”
When Harry tried to cast legimens on her, she simply moved her head out of the way, sighing.
“I’m not trying to shag you!”
“So you’re not angry?” asked Draco again. Harry put his hands on either side of Draco’s face and tilted it towards him.
“Yes,” said his father. “Have I any reason to be concerned?”
said it.”
“You go clubbing alone?” asked Ron.
That night, swaddled in fur and lying on blocks of ice
good to me,” said Draco, because anything to do with Steven had to be answered with rudeness.
Draco went to the kitchen sink and washed his hands, then walked to the nearest jewellery store and bought a ring, because he was never going to be too late for anything ever again.
“Yes, she’s so very decent and trustworthy, that Hermione Granger.”
Harry kept laughing for a while after Malfoy and his girlfriend had left, but he was conscious of something unpleasant growing in his chest. The idea of Malfoy having a girlfriend. The knowledge scraped at his heart, bitterly unfair.
Harry let his eyes drift to where Draco sat at the Slytherin table, looking impeccable and untouchable.
Harry turned back to the piano, his eyes resting on the black and white keys that his fingers flew so easily, so painlessly over.
“It would make a difference to me, Harry. If you let yourself.”
“Blaise says you’ve got a sex dungeon,” said Seamus, putting on the collar. “And that you made Draco crawl around on the floor wearing a latex body suit.”
“Ready,” said Draco.
“It’s just a slowing down,” said Draco again. Harry grimaced.
“Tell Harry Potter we’ve gone home,” he told the Welcome Witch. She perked right up.
“She’s
Draco nodded.
“It’s okay. I’m still here.”
isn’t going to last all that long, so making everything serious and official is just a waste of time.”
“I’ve been busy,” he said. “Thanks for your letters, by the way.”
“Darling, you surely can’t count this blip of a letter as bizarre or fucked up. It’s quite transparently a prank.”
