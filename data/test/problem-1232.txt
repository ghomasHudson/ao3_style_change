Turning his back now towards Harry, the boy dressed in white seemed to ponder over something — seemed to struggle with the situation. "Please…" it then followed as Draco slowly turned around again. "Please do not think of me any differently after I tell you this. Promise me you won't think I'm a bad Guardian because of this." Another sigh escaped Draco's lips, but once again a sigh that didn't seem to be truly real — more an illusion of one.
Harry turned around to face Draco and nodded. 'I share a room with the other Gryffindor boys from my year, but I'm quite used to it by now.'
was skilled in every magical field and taught classes according by level of skill. Of course there were enclosed classes for all the seventh year girls Draco wasn't allowed to follow but he didn't really care; all they learned he could learn in the next years at Beauxbatons as well. As there was a lot of self-studying involved, he often didn't even have time to think about Harry or the Tournament at all which was a fortunate thing.
Seated for dinner at the boy's table in the chateau's dining chamber, Draco awaited what Madame Maxime was about to announce. It was clear to the boy that she had something to say to her beloved students; there wasn't any food on the tables yet and Madame kept moving nervously on her chair. Nobody else seemed to notice, though — all caught up in conversations they didn't even seem to miss the presence of food.
"Of course they will, little one. I am however sure that you shall forever remain in their hearts." Taking a few steps closer now, Draco kneeled down on one knee next to the girl's bed, looking up into those big, brown eyes. "Aren't you tired of hurting then?" A shimmering gaze as a sign of upcoming tears. A small nod. "Shall I take the pain away?" Reaching out his hand once more, the girl finally laid her small hand in his.
'Harry,' he then called out to the boy. He still didn't lift up his eyes but answered with a questioned
it had been to go fly somewhere else, leave the Quidditch pitch alone. Harry hadn't thought much of it; perhaps they had become bored of flying above the pitch without even realizing it. Draco on the other hand had a suspicion of his own that there was something wrong, that there was a certain spell that was keeping them away. In April the smart Wizard had finally presented a theory to Harry that it might have something to do with the final task.
, he concluded, tucking his hands away in a jacket too light for the current weather conditions. A handful of houses identical to that of the Dursleys passed by him in a flash, followed by a lane with large trees on either side — now as white as could be.
February the 24th; the day of the second task. Red and gold ran through hallways, over fields and made an appearance even between bookshelves. Harry had been looking for Draco all morning, but still hadn't found him yet. The blond had disappeared after dinner the previous day, missing their planned meeting at the library afterwards. Harry had waiting for hours but Draco hadn't shown up. A bit disappointed Harry had gone to bed, thinking that the French had simply forgotten.
It didn't seem to work. Harry still looked frustrated or irritated; whatever emotion it was, it wasn't the right one. 'Why aren't you mad at me like all the others? You should hate the fact that Hogwarts now has two Champions and your school only one. You should hate me because I am that second Champion. You should-'
'There is always another way,' Draco bit back, his voice exhausted as he fought the pain from his scars, his cheek burning brightly by the mark his father's palm had left behind.
Draco didn't know what to say. He was panting because of all the overpowering emotions and couldn't think straight anymore. A single tear slid down his cheek again, but he wiped it away quickly, not wanting to let Harry see that he was
'I'm nothing like my father!' Draco interrupted him, now shouting as well. He slammed Harry's hand away from his chest as he looked into his enraged green eyes.
. He had always wanted to be asked to a ball by someone and as Harry was the first ever person to make his heart pace at a speed too high to be healthy, he seemed the perfect candidate to do so. But Harry hadn't asked him anything yet, didn't even mention the ball at all and it had already been two weeks since the announcement.
Looking over his shoulder, Draco spotted the nearing car immediately — but Harry was still so far away from him! Instinct kicking in, Draco ran as fast as he could, taking a leap of fate as he dived in Harry's direction and pushed him out of the way.
to tell me that as I believe what you saw. The man that I should call my father has obeyed the monster without a second thought and forced his family into something they don't want — something
Draco shrugged again. 'I'm just tired,' he said as an excuse. 'And sad that I can't return to Beauxbatons.'
'I don't —,' he mumbled, not really knowing what to reply. He wanted to defend Harry; keep it a secret and tell her one of the Death Eaters was to be held responsible — but he knew Hermione would see right through him no matter what lie he would tell her.
on the blond in front of him. Draco on the other hand took his chance to take in the other boy's body; his broad shoulders, tanned skin, slightly muscular arms from flying probably and a few faint scars here and there. Harry couldn't be more the opposite of Draco whom was as pale as pale could be and basically bones covered with flesh. Well, he wasn't
A sigh escaped Draco's lips. He took off his beret and let his hair fall loose upon his shoulders. Silver waved over his chest and he stroke the strands with his fingers. Raphael observed him from across the room, face resting upon his single hand again. The portrait seemed to mimic Draco's tired eyes and after taking a deep breath, Draco decided it was better to get some sleep. Tomorrow was another day, he told himself for a second time. Raphael's portrait already swung aside at Draco's nearing presence, not saying a word to him. Flower boy might've also been disappointed in his actions.
wanted to join such an important department at the Ministry. Only a week later they were learning about the most complicated curses to protect, defend and capture.
. The only thing his mind seemed to remember were the many death-cases that had happened during the Tournament, and all the chaos around it.
Wizards were readying themselves for an upcoming battle, and Harry knew Draco was hungry to help along. 'You want to go help them?' he asked.
Tonight was Slughorn's Christmas party, and even though Harry couldn't care less about it — Draco knew a lot of important Wizards and Witches would be there. 'I heard he even invited a vampire,' he told Harry as he pulled his Gryffindor jumper over his head, exchanged them for the beautiful robes he had missed wearing so greatly.
Visions of orbs of glass in a cold blue light doomed up in front of Harry's eyes. Faint smoke swirled through them as if it was trying to take Harry into someone else's dream. Was that vision that of a prophecy? 'You think that the prophecy is kept in those glass orbs I keep seeing? The ones we use at Divination?'
'Take a seat, take a seat,' Dumbledore said, pointing at two comfortable looking chairs that were set just far enough apart for them to accept the offer. Draco didn't dare to look at Harry and kept his eyes on the old Headmaster, whom held the slightest grin on his face. Why the man was smiling, Draco had no idea. 'You two caused quite the fuss in the Great Hall, didn't you?'
lonely. But as soon as he takes a step on the awful baroque carpet and takes a look at the faces of the Aurors… he's dumbfounded.
Harry swallowed. Would that be true? But Hermione already shooed those suspicions away. 'It’s the locket,' she said. 'I think it's making him feel weird — maybe more evil than he actually is.'
.' A small smile hovered on her lips and Draco gave her a nod while sitting up straight immediately.
With the photograph safely tucked away, Harry went downstairs to find his friends lingering around the front door. They looked nervous, and Harry couldn't help but feel the same emotion creep over his entire body and run through his veins. 'Ready?' he asked, and his friends nodded as they took each other by the hand — Hermione apparating them away to a place neither Harry nor Ron had ever been before.
— from head to toe and making their way to him by stepping around Draco as if he belonged to the particles of the air. 'So this is
'Yes, Hermione — we're sure.' Harry hiked up the sandy hill with great difficulty. He was tired, Draco noticed, but they all were.
Silence. There was no answer nor sound; only the rustling of trees and a few crows making noises in the background. Draco noticed his hand was slightly shaking and as he started to lower his wand, a pair of green eyes behind round spectacles appeared in his Lumos' light.
'No,' Dudley replied, crumbling the letter in his fist and making a ball out of it. 'I'll tell mum and dad that you're receiving letters from your boyfriend; bet they'll put those bars right back on your window and finally get rid of that owl of yours.'
'Please,' Draco interrupted, placing the ring back on Dumbledore's desk. 'Tell me about it as well so I can help Harry.'
slowly. But it was fading, and that was all that mattered. His battle with the unforgivable seemed to last forever, but it eventually left —and by the look on Voldemort’s face it wasn't the monster's doing.
As if his mind got read, a snowy owl appears at his window. Yellow eyes glowing and staring directly at Harry with great urgency. Confused, Harry opens the window for the white creature and searches for an owl treat in one of his desk's drawers.
And now he was running again; for what he seemed to do every time he was in an argument with Harry. Where had the time gone where he didn't run at all? Where was the time where he envied the girls getting chased — running away from their potential lovers in an innocent way?
A little silence followed before his mother opened her mouth again, struggling to find the right words. 'There is something I must tell you, Draco. Perhaps you should sit down,' she said as she gestured towards the chair beside her.
To Draco's surprise, the boy had lowered his wand and tucked it away in his robe's pocket. Suspicious of what the boy was up to, Draco had kept his wand where it was and watched how the blond Slytherin had pulled up the left sleeve of his robes to expose the Dark Mark — right there on his pale forearm. It had nearly made Draco drop his wand; but his trembling hand had been able to keep it steady anyway. 'You're one of them,' Draco had said as he had glanced from the dark ink to the boy's face and back.
'It calls me its host?' Draco asked with frown eyebrows. A nod followed. 'I thought it was only loyal to You-Know-Who?'
Always had he been surrounded by at least someone; the girls, the twins, his parents. And for the first time in very long, he felt alone.
strange? I'm not the one with wings on my back," he shot back, not quite understanding where the boy was coming from.
He moved a little closer to the boy and swept the haziness away with his wet thumbs. The glass of Harry's spectacles squeaked because of the movement and he winced at the sudden closeness of Draco. It made Draco smirk again as he backed away and looked up at the mermaid. 'Do you know anything about the Merpeople?' he asked Harry.
Choking a little on his tea after this question, Potter avoids looking into Draco's eyes and places the cup back on the table with much delicacy. He bites his bottom lip and shrugs. 'It's complicated.'
'Then why are you acting so strange — and why couldn't I hear about it as well?' Harry asked, not letting go of the subject at all.
They had heard them coming — a nearing evil that wasn’t to be denied. Walking outside, onto the square. Draco had bolted from the bench again, this time with Hermione immediately following by his side. He was lingering behind; unable to force himself through the crowd that wanted to go see what was going on — wether evil had returned and wether they had to fight again. Draco held on to his wand; ready to start defending himself again if necessary, and he saw others do the same. Everyone was wary, and they were right to do so. As people moved aside, and he finally was able to reach the front of the crowd, he almost fainted for the second time that day. In the distance Voldemort was nearing, with behind him Hagrid cuffed and towering above the monster. A sad look that only could be caused by heartbreak was visible on his large face, his cheeks wet and tears continuing to fall. In his arms, a body with its arms and legs swinging as if all life had been drained from them.
"They did. And not only one — they both had their own. Another rare thing, to say the least. As you see, two angels working together so closely — it is extremely difficult."
from everyone and everything. And he finally found his voice again, shouted as loudly as he could; 'Voldemort is back!' The person who was dragging him away stopped and all the eyes of the crowd were pointed at him, gone quiet in disbelief. 'He's alive!'
‘Now, now; you’re looking starved, Harry. And you as well mister Malfoy.’ She glanced between the two boys, a glance that came accompanied with a head-shake.
The man grabs his hands now, both his leather gloved and pale one. Draco feels his own sweat mix with Potter’s as they both sit on the floor staring into nothingness. The pain slowly drifts away and another tear leaves Draco's cheek, making him feel weak once again. Why does he always have to cry in front of Potter?
Draco faced her and put on a little smile. He himself wasn't entirely sure about that, but her words were reassuring in some way. 'Why did you choose me, out of all the boys?' he asked her.
With the portrait door shut again, he let out a deep breath he didn't knew he had been holding in. He reached forward with his hands and felt the smooth fabric of the invisibility cloak beneath his fingers. He clutched his hand around it and pulled it off Harry's body. The boot stood with his back towards Draco, head turned the other way to look around his room. 'So, this is where you sleep? It's quite nice,' he commented.
. Everything was slowly returning. Draco could hear the ripping of flesh again his ears — a macabre memory he had hoped to have lost. Accompanied by the cry of a boy — cries he couldn't recognize as his own yet they were. A nod followed, as he could remember what happened again.
The boy shook his head, tried to form words with his lips but seemed to find himself unable to speak. With a deep sigh, Harry decided to trust this strange boy, and started walking back home.
'Yes, he can,' Harry admitted, pushing Draco's wand-holding hand down and getting a look of squinted eyes from the blond in return. 'But he can't use any dueling spells. Aren't I right, Draco?'
'Harry,' the voice once again repeated at the sign of movement from Harry's side. Finally did Harry recognize to whom that voice belonged; to Draco, of course. Turning himself on his other side he looked into the beautiful but shiny eyes of his lover; tears sparkling on his cheeks as a pale hand slowly wiped them away, trembling.
And as they ran back, through that dark tunnel, Harry realized that what was happening was what Draco had wanted to warn him for; dark magic was surrounding him and his cousin.
'Apparently she thinks I am not qualified enough to help her.' Draco felt a stab through his heart at those words. Admitting it to someone made it real — made him feel like a failure.
He can't surrender himself!' He tried to free his arm from her grip, but it was stronger than he'd ever expect it to be. Hermione's eyes were set with determination.
It also seemed as if every thought of Harry was slowly fading away — the little details he always remembered so well suddenly gone and lost. The few memories he had left played in his head with the narrative voice of the Dark Lord; whispering words that only meant bad things — said bad things about Harry and how he was using Draco, had always used him for everything. He had used him for the Triwizard Tournament — used him to get away from his Muggle-family — to battle against the Dark Lord at the Ministry.
As Ron wanted to say something else to her, perhaps something that would matter greatly to their relationship — the sound of a loud explosion caught their ears. As they turned themselves to the bedroom's window, they saw flames as high as the Burrow itself rise up out of nowhere — followed by flashes of black smoke.
A little before noon, a loud crack resounds through Draco’s room. Hours have passed since he saw the curse spread again — yet he still has no idea what caused it or how it can be stopped from spreading any further. All he could think of was to try and destroy it, try to scratch it off. It had resulted in an even more painful feeling as thick drops of bloods had rolled down to his wrist. The crying had stopped, moved on to the outdoors of Malfoy Manor; heavy rain of his tears now falling down on the rose garden. Drop, drop, drop,
They stayed up in the sky for about an hour, landing with aching muscles. As their feet touched the grassy ground of the Quidditch pitch again, Draco threw himself in Harry's arms  and made the boy stumble. Together they fell upon the soft grass, eyes locked and smiles both wide and bright. He pressed his lips against Harry's and felt the warmth he had lost in the cold air slowly return to his body again. 'I want to try it by myself now,' he then said to the boy. Harry frowned first before smiling and nodding his head.
Getting called away by someone wanting a drink, Draco was quickly left alone again. Letting his eyes roam the room, he soon saw a new opportunity of a conversation. Hermione Granger, dressed in a beautiful pink dress, stood all alone and hidden away behind one of the drapings. Slowly sliding the long piece of fabric aside, he looked at her sulking self which was clearly upset about something. '
They arrived around midnight, the moon shining its brightest and throwing near-blue light upon the chateau. In the book

Draco remained calmness himself compared to Harry whom climbed out of the Lake in an angry fashion. 'It's not working! It nearly drowned me!' he shouted at Draco.
The message ended and Draco rose back to the surface, catching for breath as he watched Harry do the same. 'The Black Lake! It's where the next task will be, right?'
' Draco laid his eyes on the raven-haired boy again; his long eyelashes closed against his cheeks. Suddenly, he saw how much his lover had changed compared to the time they had met; his jawline was more prominent, his cheekbones as well. His skin seemed a bit more rough, his hands stronger. Had his own self changed? He didn't know. His eyes glanced at Hermione, lost in her own thoughts again. She didn't look like the cute girl from fourth-year anymore either. They had all aged without realizing — because although they were still children somehow, they had never had the chance to truly be one. Let alone become adults.
On a Monday morning he hears the sound of a bird's beak ticking against his bedroom window. Still dressed in green silk pajamas and sweaty from another nightmare, he crawls out of bed and makes his way to the feathery creature. It's an old Barn Owl with a beautiful round face, staring at Draco with jet black eyes. He's brought a small package with him and a letter, both tied multiple times with a red and gold ribbon.
But Harry shook his head, already bolting upright with the little energy he had. Almost falling down again, Draco quickly sat beside him and let him lean against his shoulder. 'Calm down a bit,' he told the boy.
hair had become chaotic, his face looked ill and dark circles graced his eyes. Lucius Malfoy simply wasn't the man Draco once used to know, but whom would stay the same when there was an evil monster living in their home?
,' Draco explained to her — getting straight to the point as he knew Madame liked; long explanations were for lies, she once said — short ones for the truth.
,' Draco explained. 'But don't go shouting it at me everywhere; your French is terrible.' Harry laughed at his words and tightened his embrace around Draco a little. The blond sighed of contentment. 'You should go. Before they report their fourth Champion missing or something.'
Wiltshire was more rustic than Harry had imagined. Houses of stone, lined up next to streets of pebbles hundreds of years old. A tree here, a tree there and no-one to be seen as far as their eyes could reach. They also hadn't landed on the square Hermione had told them about, rather on a bridge made of stone with a river running underneath their figures. Just as she was about to explain why they had landed there instead, the most awful alarm went off and made them cover their ears — as if ravens had suddenly become upset and were crying their ugliest cries.
'Good. Well, I believe you have the most friends in Gryffindor, right?' Dumbledore then asked Draco, whom nodded his head. 'Then I now officially sort you into Gryffindor. I hope you won't mind wearing red instead of blue. If you want I can also put you in Ravenclaw—‘
Focusing his attention on his own Mortal again, Draco stepped through the closed bathroom door as if it was the most normal thing in the world. To him it felt like stepping through a shower of cold rain; a little chilly but nothing more. Noticing Harry was looking at himself in the mirror, Draco positioned himself right behind the boy. He himself almost reached six feet two, while Harry stayed at a mediocre five feet six. Keeping his own gaze on the boy's reflection and not his own — vanity was one of the biggest sins angels should not commit — Draco tried to read his thoughts through those emerald eyes of his.
That was really his job after all; following his mortal and making sure he was alright. Of course Draco couldn't do anything about people shouting at him, denying him breakfast or anything alike… but he was there to do his best — to do the most he could.
But Harry only felt mad, felt abandoned and left out of something. How could they ask how he was when he had been worried all summer, had waited for his letters to be answered when they were here, together, chilling on a bed and talking about — about
… how do you know where I live?" A million questions then flooded Harry's mind at once, and he had to do his very best not to feel overwhelmed yet again.
He heard voices whispering and footsteps nearing and turned himself to Cedric. 'We have to go,' he shouted at him, crawling up to his feet again as he searched for the Cup. 'Where is the cup?'
Before either of them could say another word, Petunia's screeching voice called for Harry's name once more. With everything that had happened, Harry'd totally forgotten he still had to do the dishes and peel w
'I'll tell you another time — just know that you're all safe,' he replied with a smile. 'Now, time for a tour,
Eyes opened slowly, their gaze lifted and staring into the cracked mirror of Harry's wardrobe. The reflection he saw confused him at first, but it didn't last very long as such an intense feeling overcame him that his heart stopped beating and his breath caught in his throat. Words weren't there to be said, thoughts weren't there to think. Everything stopped, and the overwhelming feeling of the unknown hit Harry like waves against a cliff.
He made his way through what seemed to be streets with the hill-houses on either side and stumbled upon something that humans would call a square. A circle of green and blue, light shining down like a spotlight. Pointy tridents and weapons; pointed at the boy by the square's guardians. And in the middle; four sleeping figures bound to stone statues of mermaids. Only one of them caught Harry's attention; a pale boy, taller than the other three, hulled in blue robes and his long hair floating around his head.
'Now we destroy these two, with this one,' he explained, pointing at the items. Bending forward, he picked up the sword and reached it out for Draco to take. There was still a bit of his blood visible on the silver blade; gleaming a bright red in the fire's light. Hesitantly, Draco took it by its handle and felt how heavy it actually was — no wonder it had been so hard for Harry to swim to the shore with it earlier. The boy then reached for the locket — its parseltongue whispers still upset and demanding. 'I believe,' he started, turning the locket around in his palm. 'That you should be the one to destroy it, Draco.'
about it. It had been then that he had seen it; the black ink of the Dark Mark spreading towards his wrist — the snake's head extending. It'd looked like a dark, rainy cloud had appeared out of nowhere on a sunny day. Or a jar of ink that had fallen over and had destroyed his Charms homework. Mortified by the sight of such developments, Draco had pulled his sleeve back down and bitten his lip in horror. He'd looked around the room in a paranoid fashion, but had been relieved to notice nobody had seen what he'd saw. Until his eyes had fallen upon Potter. Those green eyes, staring right back into his grey ones.
Hermione and I have done enough research about it to know it'll work. But for how long; neither of us can say.'
'She?' Whom was this man talking about? Mundungus squeezed his eyes a bit as if to block all his surroundings by it — to make himself disappear and avoid the topic all together. Taking a step closer and nearly touching the man's face with the tip of his wand, Harry repeated the question. 'Who do you mean?'
Probably nothing — but knowing the curiosity from the boy and the fact that he couldn't let any little, mysterious thing pass by; it would probably lead to him confessing and eventually dying.
Mother plays the cello beautifully, his Father used to handle a piano quite well. And apparently, Draco was destined to play the violin. One of the little tower-like rooms of the Manor, hidden away from the rest of the house, was transformed into a small space where Draco could make as much noise as he wanted. A white chair, music stand and a bookcase full of written music formed the insides of the room. And of course, now found hung upon one of the walls; Draco's white violin.
It revealed a beautiful room with glass-stained windows from floor to ceiling, a large bathtub the size of a pool in the centre and as they entered, it seemed like they were walking through a thick mist reaching up to their knees. A mermaid was pictured on the window in the middle, brushing through her hair with her fingers as she swung her fin from left to right with much elegance. Draco took a glance at Harry's face as he looked around, mesmerized.
'Of course!' Hermione then blurted out. Everyone turned to her, as if forgotten she had still been there. 'It's Helga Hufflepuff's cup!'
Memories flashed in front of his eyes as he searched his mental library; searched for the glimpse of a sapphire he could vaguely recall.
? What does that have to do with anything?' The boy asked, eyebrows frown and a hint of desperation visible in his eyes again.
way. Maybe Madame also needed him to encourage the girls; to make them look beautiful and to be like a guide to them.
It confuses Draco; only a week ago he scratched his arm so severe he caused it to bleed. It didn't led to anything but Draco had been glad that at least his arm was still able to bleed; to feel pain and to be
“You bought me a Snow Owl?” Draco says in horror. The white creature looks at him with bright yellow eyes and let's out another soft hoot.
Frowning his eyebrows at first, unsure what Draco was talking about, Harry looked down at his arm in Draco's hand — glowing red of burns and forming scars. It had been caused by him supporting Draco on the way home, and back then it had felt so incredibly painful — but his mind had shut it out, had made the fact that angels existed a priority above pain. "Oh," Harry commented on the matter, "I completely forgot."
How could this all be happening? Not only had he been attacked by Dementors, saved his cousin's life but still got the blame for his pain, suspended from Hogwarts, called to the Wizengamot and now was locked up again in his room at Privet Drive number four.
'What happened to you, actually?' Harry asked his friend, tone a little vile because of his earlier words.
. And when they find something else to focus on, it's on the wilted rose laying abandoned between chips of china.
Then a kind of haze went by in front of Harry's eyes; very faintly but Draco noticed it anyway. It was as if the boy suddenly realized something — as if the pieces of a very difficult puzzle suddenly fell into place. 'It is he himself, isn't it?' he said, looking at the white snow underneath them. 'He has given you a task.' Draco swallowed as he himself looked at the white snow as well; his eyes slowly blinding by its clarity. A strong taste of iron now filled his mouth, even though he himself hadn't mentioned a thing about the task. 'You have to tell me more about it,' Harry then said. 'And that Slytherin is involved as well, isn't he?'
With a small nod she disappears out of the room and returns a minute later with Ron on her heels. They both sit back down on the couch, eagerly waiting for what Harry's going to say. Rose makes an anticipating sound as well; as if she's also ready to hear an exciting story.
Not drawing any conclusions immediately, Harry had gone back to bed. But as Draco kept disappearing during nighttimes — Harry also kept on checking on him. Almost every night he met the Slytherin boy on the seventh floor; only to disappear with him a few seconds after. Something was off, Harry concluded.
Ron swallowed and looked away. 'I just — all we do is snog the whole time and it's getting rather boring. Not to mention she makes me wear these dull necklaces with our names on,' the ginger-haired boy explained.
,' he replied, quickly pulling the warm fabric over his head. Warmth. Coziness. A flashback to Harry's warm Christmas sweater on a cold day in February.
"Better do it quick then!" the woman answered, but it reached Harry's ears only faintly as he was already halfway up the stairs.
Another week passes in silence; he doesn't hear anything from Potter nor does he feel like facing his Mother and her waterfall of questions. The mirror only shoots him snide remarks on how he should eat more these days, reflecting prominent cheekbones and bony wrists. Draco's hair doesn't even want to fall decently anymore since he became so unhealthy; since he became a cursed man living up to Death.
Her hair was slightly shorter, Draco noticed, and tied into a braid. It appeared as if she had aged a lot in the few months he hadn't seen her, as he could see the faintest wrinkles appear around her eyes as she smiled. She was too young to have deep wrinkles, Draco knew, but his heart jumped a little at knowing Beauxbatons' princes was becoming a queen. As Fleur let go, Draco's eyes found Bill, leaning against the kitchen counter with a cup of coffee in his hands. He hadn't seen the man before, and now took advantage of taking him in. Three times as much freckles as Ron's, hair the same bright orange and reaching to his shoulders. He was dressed in a burgundy shirt that clashed with his hair, a golden wedding ring around his finger. 'I'm sorry I missed the wedding,' he told the man, suddenly remembering, then turned himself to Fleur again. 'Did you wear my dress?'
Potter touches his glasses ever so slightly and rearranges himself on his chair. ‘So, have you taken a look inside that book yet?’ he asks him.
, Harry. Beside from being attracted to men, I suppose,' he assured him, giving Harry a little smile. 'And you shouldn't feel sorry about that either.’
'Well, you also seem quite close to that Northern beast, Krum. And let's say that it also isn't really normal for a Champion's best friend to befriend another Champion.
"Don't be like that, Draco,' his mother interrupts, sighing once again, "I actually wanted to buy a new owl for you, so you could perhaps exchange letters again with some old friends. I bet they're worried about you… it's been five years.'
Harry kept staring from Draco to Hermione and back. What if Krum wouldn't be able to save Hermione within the hour? Hadn't the clue said that if one didn't succed; it wouldn't come back?
. Laughing of hundreds of Death Eaters followed. A grim atmosphere. Draco's mind a blank canvas as he crawled up again, still shaking and wobbling on his feet. Another leap forwards — hands holding him back as a flurry of desperate aggression overcame him.
Black wings, almost like leather, took off into the sky. The last bit of sunshine shone upon their heads as they flew higher and higher, further away from Hogwarts. A bit of smoke hung above the courtyard, faint memories of firework explosions that had lent them the opportunity to get away unnoticed.
Feeling something clam take ahold of his hand; he looked up in the beaming face of Harry. He couldn't return the look, for as he felt unwelcome and uncomfortable at the same time. Could he please crawl back through that dark tunnel and go live with Dumbledore's brother, please? But of course he didn't actually want to — but it was always an option. 'They don't want me here,' he whispered to Harry, the others not hearing him over their own excited shouting.
Locks turned, spun, twisted — and the heavy door finally opened to reveal a room filled with a huge quantity of shiny objects. Gold greeted them as if they had found a tomb somewhere in the Amazon Forest; long forgotten and now all theirs to keep. '
Opening the door, the freckled face of Ron appeared behind it with a smile. Immediately arms got wrapped around each other and he was held in a tight embrace, before they got pushed aside to make room for the other members. Mad-Eye Moody marched to the living room as if he had visited the house many times before, the others following while looking around at the floral wallpapers.
'Or by someone,' André added to it with a cheeky smile. Draco nudged him in the side. How much he sometimes wished they didn't know about him and Harry; it would prevent him from turning the color of a tomato every once in a while.
Draco handed over the girls to their dates almost as if he was giving them away on their wedding day. He looked every boy so intensely in the eyes that they all winced and couldn't leave his side fast enough, carefully taking one of the
, perhaps not,' Draco answered. It didn't matter what other people thought as long as they didn't make a problem of it. 'Though, I rather keep it to myself and my friends. I would like it if you wouldn’t tell anyone about it?’
It was another photograph of Draco; one where he looked fiercely into the camera and then started laughing — as if someone had made a joke he for once in his lifetime found terribly funny. He still had his long hair, Harry could see, as a few long strands hung over his cheeks — the rest of it tucked away underneath a beret. 'When was this taken?'
Draco mainly taught Charms and gave flying lessons a few times a week while Harry gave DADA class and helped the Quidditch teams prepare for matches. He was also the refugee, and often brought a lot of outsiders onto the school grounds to let them watch the Boy-Who-Lived-Twice blow a whistle at every mistake a bunch of French students made.
With her big blue eyes always pointed at the floor when in the presence of her master, Pibbly has never noticed his arm before.
It also wasn't possible for Harry nor Ron to see the body of Dolohov, as it was kept at a special and new department for cursed corpses. Kingsley didn't want anyone that wasn't authorized to be in close range of the decaying body, thereby forbidding the duo any access. Besides, Harry and Ron should be happy; the last Death Eater had died. The Wizarding World could finally sleep on both its ears.
Swallowing at her words, Harry couldn't help but agree— but Draco was in danger and wether it was real or not, he wouldn't take the risk of having him die. He loved him too much for that. He hadn't spent enough time with him yet. They were supposed to remain together until the end of time — until they would become as old as Nicolas Flamel. Until—
All the girls their eyes looked from Fleur to Draco, awaiting an answer. Of course she understood; the smart Witch she was and always had been. Hadn't Draco told her about it? He didn't remember but he probably did. And so he nodded. It was indeed because of his father. 'But because of Harry as well,' he added to it.
Neville stood next to Draco, a tray in his hands filled with bubbling drinks. 'Neville,' Draco called out as he took in the boy's figure. Dressed in waiter's clothes — Draco immediately saw he wasn't part of the Slug Club. 'I am,
Draco couldn't help but laugh because of it and guided him in the direction of the last door; colored in pure white and decorated with a pale blue number that was his own. 'Here it is,' he said with a little smile and the door unlocked at the touch of his hand. The midday sun was shining its beautiful bright light through the large windows; lighting up the entire space and showing off the elaborate use of gold and blue. Draco could see that Harry's eyes were immediately drawn to the view upon the Quidditch pitch that was one of the best features from this dormitory — but also that he seemed to be surprised by how large the room was.
'Who — who's going to destroy the cup?' Ron then asked in a stammering way — in a fearful way. His voice screamed that he didn't want to be the one, and with an irritated sigh Draco saw how Hermione snatched it from the ground.
Before Draco could have even seen it coming, he got embraced into a hug for the third time that evening. And not a hug from someone he was used to getting hugs from, no; a hug from the green-eyed boy.
'Tell him I don't want to talk to him,' he had replied in French, biting his tongue and suppressing his emotions. It had felt bad to ignore Harry like that but he knew he had to.
Draco stared deeply into his eyes and leaned in a tiny bit closer to Harry's face before pulling away again. 'Make yourself comfortable,' he said as he walked over to his wardrobe and took off his hat and coat. Harry watched him for a few seconds before taking off his own coat as well, handing it over to Draco who hung it away in his wardrobe neatly. He didn't like having clothes cluttered around his room. As he turned himself back towards Harry, he couldn't help but laugh. The boy was wearing a bright red jumper with a golden H on it. Handmade, it seemed, and it made the boy look too cute for Draco to handle. '
The centre of the field of grass was marked with a white circle and the place where Draco was finally released. After being told to stay there, Harry ran to the side where two brooms were neatly waiting to be picked up, ready to fly. Draco's stomach turned around at the sight of the brooms; two sticks of death with a few branches. As Harry neared with them, he even felt slightly dizzy and took a step back. Draco could hear his heart beat in his ears as he remembered his fall again. 'I really can't, Harry,' he said once more to the boy. The Quidditch pitch was spinning in front of his eyes as if he was on a rocky boat, trying to keep it steady.
,' he murmurs, pointing his wand at his left arm. It is an easy spell, yes, but has been found working excellent in front of the eyes of strangers. He himself of course can’t see whether it truly worked or not — but he’s confident in his own spell-work. Draco learnt about the spell from his fellow Slytherin, Zabini, when he’d desperately tried to hide an acne scar from the Wizarding World, and memory draw the faintest smile upon his lips.
"The true gaze of an angel." Soft footsteps on wood then told him Draco'd stood up; had started paced across the room. "Addicting yet extremely dangerous."
Malfoy nods again, eyes looking away from the tea cup and hands drawing back from Harry's. It immediately leaves an empty feelings inside Harry's chest; the warmth that Malfoy's palms spread suddenly missing. 'I think you should leave. It's already late, anyway,' Malfoy then says.
Draco guided Fleur together with a few of her friends to the Great Hall. Gabrielle, Fleur's sister, also joined their little encouragement group and held on to Draco's hand. She had always loved to be around Draco and today was no difference; after Draco had braided her hair this morning she hadn't wanted to leave his side anymore.
!' he shouted back before disappearing into the carriage, leaving the boy behind on the green grasses of Hogwarts' grounds.
With rose cheeks Draco turned around a few times as if to find another blond, French boy in his room — then pointed at himself. '
Looking as if he didn't want to have any of it, Harry shook his head and opened his mouth again; ready to argue about what Draco was saying was absolutely wrong, probably — but professor Slughorn made his way to their table and demanded them to get their potion books out and prepare themselves for class as well. As Draco pulled out his potions book — the French version — he noticed that Ron and Harry had no book of themselves at all. 'Ah, boys,' Slughorn commented on the matter. 'There are two more books in that closet over there, which you can borrow until you've bought new ones.'
, not a potion. Besides, the clouds are hovering underneath my skin rather than above. If they hovered above; the black wouldn’t be permanent.’
He watched the seconds tick away as the moonlight shone on it's glass surface. It had acted strange a few times before that summer, the big hand pointing at the wrong hour only to point back at the right one shortly after. And as Harry thought about its weird behavior — it suddenly did so again. The big hand shot to a spot between one and two, trembling slightly. Harry frowned as he sat up straight, legs swung to the side. Immediately the big hand pointed at the number nine and as Harry followed it's direction, he noticed it was pointing at his door. He rose from his bed and spun around in his room like a mad person, keeping his eyes on the timepiece and noticing that it kept moving along with the direction of the door. As he came to a halt, head still spinning and a dizzy feeling making him the tiniest bit nauseous, he heard a rumbling sound, followed by grumbled French words. '
Harry felt more nervous than before now that Draco was gone, and stared into the mirror again. He could've looked worse, that's true; and since when did he care about what he looked like anyway?
Another movement followed; another one that no-one had expected. Harry’s lifeless body moved again — left Hagrid’s arms as if he had known Draco would perform the perfect distraction. Draco saw his lover race a few feet, fall to his knees to pick up a wand he recognized immediately. A curse of green; fired at the boy straight away. And Harry, defending himself with Draco’s wand.
The golden doors of the dining chamber got thrown open and house-elves walked in holding trays of food. A buffet started to gather on the two tables, filling the room with scents of the most delicious foods. Starting with soup and some bread, followed by complicated dishes like escargot; the French cuisine would definitely be missed in Scotland.
With the promise to himself of taking Harry shopping for some decent clothes — as he wasn't planning on being associated with such a messy dressed person for any longer — Draco had dragged Harry to Muggle London two days before their return to school. A large hat he had decided to wear, together with a jacket too large for him and a scarf too long. He looked like a walking sack of potatoes, or a giant Christmas sock — the metaphor didn't matter; the overall look of it did. He knew no-one would recognize him even if he just dressed the stylish way he always did, but there was always a little risk of someone seeing them together.
Suddenly remembering that conversation, Harry knew why Draco had looked away. 'They don't approve of it?'
Harry didn't know why his lover had said such a thing; the French detested Castor. Yet he felt like there was no way in convincing Draco to leave the other blond behind — and therefore they looped around the pile while Draco desperately tried to take Castor's hand in his.
Harry's grip loosened around his arm as he started to tremble slightly, his muscles losing their strength. Before Draco turned around again, he let his eyes glance at what used to be his hair one last time. Without hesitation he then threw it at the boy in front of him and ran away, leaving Harry behind in a waterfall of silver locks.
, was the first thing he thought before taking off to his room again. That Potion's test could go make itself; he had more important things to do.
Draco sighed and stroke her hair. 'Of course it isn't fair, but we'll see what they'll say once they've calmed down, alright? Perhaps it was just a mistake.'
And so another task was added to Draco's list; providing all of the girls with dates. Every girl from Beauxbatons seemed to want his opinion on their date, dress and hairstyle. The blond got dragged from one corner of Hogwarts to another, taking a look at possible candidates. The girls somehow even planned a day for Durmstrang students to take a chance at asking one of them to the Yule Ball. It was quite the sight seeing those Northern beasts lined up outside in the cold wind, chins held up high and faces expressionless as Draco strode past them. He inspected the boy's face, body, haircut and even fingernails to see if they were fit candidates for the girls. The ones he didn't like, he just sent away by shaking his head at them.
Wearing Molly's jumper with pride, Draco flew back to the forest surrounding the Manor. His lips still tingled with Harry's last kiss and he wished he could feel the slight bruising for more days to come. Landing without a sound he took a look around and heard the wind whisper in his ears, blow by and never return again. With his broom shrunken, he started his search of finding the rotten apple that would once again serve as his Portkey; that would take him back to Beauxbatons. He knew Madame Maxime always sent it to the forest; even when he actually
He dragged the French with him towards the pitch, dooming up in the distance. Draco swallowed at the sight of the three goal posts, high in the air like moons of steel. House colored towers surrounded it and even though Draco had always been interested in getting to know every little detail about Hogwarts and its Houses, he would skip the Quidditch pitch easily if he could. At least, if it involved any flying. But Harry's grip was tight and as much as Draco tried to pull himself away; Harry just wouldn’t let go.
His words seemed to upset his father even more, especially because they were once again said in French — a language his father had never truly been able to speak nor understand. 'We are in England, Draco. You must stop talking in that daft language of yours.'
'I — I don't know, Harry,' Hermione answered, her voice making it clear she was still in terrible pain. 'Snape invented the spell so he'll probably know how to set things right again. He'll know best, Harry. We must trust him.'
,' he then whispered to the pastel blue door — its structure swinging aside to reveal a common room more crowded than Draco could have ever expected.
Opening his eyes, he notices that the sun is slowly starting to break through, giving the red roses a yellow gleam. His eyes land upon a beautiful red rose, faced proudly towards the morning sun. He reaches out to touch one of its petals, gently stretching out one of his blackened fingers. Only the tip of his finger is laid atop the delicate rose when it suddenly starts to decay, its petals turning black and sloppy within a second. Draco pulls his hand away in horror as he remains staring at the wilted rose, hanging limp from her stem with tears welling up in his eyes.
Draco's doing, and therefore kept his mind focused to make the plan work. Harry softly pushed Draco against his shoulder, and Draco's thin figure gave in to lay itself down in the sand. Staring into his dark eyes, Harry hoped to find some sort of emotion — some piece of Draco he recognized from before. But there was nothing but darkness.
Both his friends are silent after that; staring at Harry as if he's not there anymore. Baby Rose keeps making silent sounds but the couple ignores it, lost in their thoughts. It seems like they're both imaging Malfoy with a black arm and thinking about what to do about it at the same time.
' he had shouted, and it had been louder a sound than he had ever thought of being able to produce. Tears had welled up in his eyes as he had ran towards Harry, others following now that they had realized what had been going on.
He wondered what presents Harry had gotten yesterday; they hadn't talked about it. Beside from the knitted hat, he himself had been given a book on special plants and an elaborate golden hand-mirror from his parents. Celebrating Christmas at home was something Draco had always loved, as the Manor for once wouldn't feel so cold when decorated with Christmas trees and ribbons everywhere. He usually got more presents but his parents liked to hand things over in person, and gave Draco the promise of giving him more once he returned home for the summer. But Draco didn't need more presents; he already had all he wished for.
Her portrait swung aside and revealed Fleur’s room. It was exactly the same size and held exactly the same furniture as Draco’s, but Fleur had decorated everything with small seashells and flowers. She had always been interested in everything sea and ocean; she spoke a lot about how she was going to live near the sea once she got married. Draco looked at her slim figure wrapped in a blue blanket and her long silver hair sprawled across her pillow.
'Move,' another voice then said — of which Harry had totally forgotten had still been there. Snape pushed Harry aside as he fell to his knees as well, his wand still at hand, and started mumbling spells while waving the dark piece of wood over Draco's chest. Draco himself moaned from the pain, his eyes still shedding tears while looking dull and absent.
With his dressing gown thrown over his shoulders and a hat pulled over his ears, he sneaked out of his room and out of the carriage, finding Madame waiting by the winged horses a bit further across the grassy field. Draco hurried himself over to her, watched how she held a finger to her lips and looked around before gesturing for him to follow her. She made her way towards a cabin in front of the Forbidden Forest, and as they were only a few feet away she suddenly stopped and turned. 'Wait here and don't get seen,
It had all happened so fast, all in such a hurry and a blur that it was hard for Harry to believe it had actually happened. He lay on his back, his head sunken in his pillow and stared up at the ceiling. He held Draco's timepiece in his hand, wondered when Draco would reply to the letter he had sent only an hour ago. With frustration, worry and wonder Harry had penned down all his thoughts and experiences of the past events; of how Draco's prediction for trouble had come true.
It was evening and time for the final task. The 24th of June it was precisely and Harry had sneaked Draco into the Gryffindor common room to help him prepare. Dressed in red and black, Harry turned himself every possible way in front of his mirror. ‘How do I look,' he asked Draco whom was standing beside him. His long hair was tied up in a low ponytail, draping over his right shoulder. The French himself was dressed in what could be the perfect outfit to go horseback-riding; creme colored trousers tucked in boots and a blue vest with six shiny silver buttons. As Harry took a glance at himself again, he noticed how clumsy and disheveled he looked compared to his boyfriend.
With a sigh — which seems to be the millionth one today — Draco crosses his arms and squints his eyes at the Golden
'You'll see,' Draco replied and bent through his knees to pick up his hat again. Putting it back on in the most elegant way, he looked around Harry's room. 'We'll have to pack all your things,
Harry nodded. 'Yeah, we — er — went for a long walk by the Lake,' he lied. He didn't dare to glance over at Hermione nor Ron, just scooped more scrambled eggs onto his plate.
'At least the book can't sing,' the other Weasley twin then said, followed by the grinning of the other Weasley children and a glare from Molly.
to do. He had never spilled a thing about it to Voldemort — Snape had been the person to blame for that act. Neither could he help to feel a certain sympathy, as he as well had once been under the towering, demanding figure of his father — but that was no more. The only person he would listen to, he would obey now would be Harry. Would be the
Her warm eyes lit up even more as she accepted the present with a smile. 'I've told you before to just call me Molly, dear. Now, let's see what unnecessary gift you bought for me, shall we?' Everyone went silent as they awaited what it was Draco had gifted the ginger-haired woman. A book appeared from underneath the wrapping and was clutched to Molly's chest almost immediately, a bright smile on her face. 'Oh, Draco you know exactly what to get me, don't you?'
, it's not a good idea,' he said to the boy. 'Can't we do something else?' He took a step closer and placed his hands on Harry's chest. A cheeky look into the boy's eyes and Draco was convinced he could make Harry forget all about Quidditch; but he was wrong.
What was it that Davis had seen in Dolohov's body that made it resemble a Dementor that much? Sure enough it could have been as black as Malfoy's arm, but shouldn’t Unspeakables be used to seeing corpses burned and hexed? Wasn't that similar to an entire black corpse, anyway? It all became a mystery Harry was desperate to solve.
Our youngest Champion; in love with the lone boy from his rivalry school!' A voice cried out. Blonde curls bounced on her shoulders with every move she made and her green robes stood out more than a dark cloud to a clear sky.
Draco's heart started to beat fast, his breathing as well and he suddenly couldn't move anymore. The others got up to their feet, hurried themselves downstairs to see what all the fuss was about. But Draco slowly stood up and went over to the window; watched how a circle of fire and flames formed itself around the Burrow. Around a home. The home of a man whom had never trusted him and was right to do so.
'Why not?' Harry asked again. Of course Draco's father would be able to hurt him, even when Draco was probably smarter and better at dueling; there would always be a way.
'Draco,' the voice repeated, but once again Draco ignored it, for his father now had joined her as well. With his hand on her waist, his other locked in hers, they twirled through the room together — making Draco laugh.
Leaving his seat, he made his way towards the portrait and faced the blond boy painted in pastel colors. He wore an aureole of flowers, painted in pastels likewise. One single pale hand was also painted, holding a winged key. '
Dumbledore swiftly glanced at him but didn't seem that bothered at all by having shared such a personal memory without permission. 'Perhaps it is a good thing that you have seen that memory, Draco,' he started. 'Maybe now you will realize a thing or two — keep them in mind.'
With those words blurted out into Harry's face, Draco quickly turned around and made a run towards the carriage again. His heart was beating fast and reached its peak when he felt a hand wrap around his arm, pulling him back. He stared right into Harry's green eyes again that seemed to twinkle a bit in the pale moonlight; reflecting every star above their heads.
And he was running again. A returning theme, as one might remember. The snake of fire had stopped the others in their blasting as one of them was frozen, the others slightly confused. It had created a barrier between them and the French, and it was the perfect way for Draco to run off as fast as his legs could take him. Hiding behind a pile of stuff, he waited for them to round the corner as well as soon as curse of the fiery snake had ended — so he could hex them all at once and blast their figures into Wizarding space.
Curious to know who it was, Harry sneaked up the stairs again and waiting only a few away from the top of the tower. He couldn't hear the Wizard's voice properly; his whispering too soft to be carried to the staircase. Blond, dressed in black and clearly threatening Dumbledore with a wand.
