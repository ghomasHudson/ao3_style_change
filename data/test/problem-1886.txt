Draco loves his job; it’s his life. It gives him reason to get out of bed every evening, bathing in fresh moonlight and preparing to find out what awful things the regular folks have been getting up to behind their loved ones’ backs. And getting paid to do it, no less. He’s a snoopy enough fucker as it is; he’d stick his nose in people’s business for free, really. He’s thrilled to find there is a market for surreptitiously gathering the secrets of those who think they are being ever so carefully devious, and reporting back to those who will line Draco’s pockets for this information. Everyone's got secrets, or things to hide, whether big or small, even more so given all the power vacuums left in the wake of the War. Work for a private investigator is thriving, even one with as undesirable a last name as the one Draco is blessed with. (
Draco exchales thickly, pushes his hair away from his clammy forehead. He inspects his right hand under the low dorm light, then clenches his jaw. There’s blood under the fingernails, and his arm aches. The scratches along it are long and deep and the new scab has been pulled away. It’s no surprise, but Draco groans with frustration all the same; sleep, he just wants to
Draco's answering moan is muffled against Harry's cock, but no less frantic because of it. Harry sucks on the pads of his own fingers, digging the heel of his raised leg into the mattress as his thighs begin to tremble a shudder that runs up his sides, over his chest and up to his scalp. He drags a ragged breath in around his fingers, his eyes slamming shut as his cock twitches. He feels himself start to come.
“Next you’ll be saying you love me,” Harry teased, feeling a blessed wave of sleepiness crash over him. He said a silent prayer to the power of orgasms, and the fit, loving boyfriends who brought them to him.
Draco sucks his lower lip into his mouth, his entire body taut with tension as Potter ups the ante even further, using his hands to set up a slow thrusting motion with Draco’s hips. It takes Draco a moment to realise what Potter wants, and even when he does he keeps his movements shallow. It’s beyond arousing, looking down at Potter’s lips stretched wide as he holds his head still for Draco to fuck into his mouth. Draco feels his balls tightening, the muscles in his thighs straining as his orgasm grows close. His breathing is hectic, as is Potter’s as he draws in air through his nose, his brow creased in a deep frown and a solid flush spreading over his cheekbones and down onto the apples of his cheeks. His lips are the colour of a deep, red bruise.
Draco resists the urge to throw the contents of his glass in the man's face; he lifts it to his lips and throws the last of the vile drink back instead, then follows Potter's irate path out the door.
"I thought I would―" Draco swallows, cutting himself off as Harry breathes over his skin again. Harry's face feels warm in all the places Draco is touching him. "I thought it would feel more―
He rested his free hand against the towel rack as his knees went weak in a way he was very familiar with and would also never, ever tell Draco about; his ego would reach planetary proportions if he ever caught wind of the fact he could sometimes literally make Harry feel like swooning.
He sort of vaguely knew this, but hadn’t had any real confirmation of how bad it was. Hogwarts never had room in their curriculum for topography, and Voldemort never had much room in his killing-Harry schedule to allow Harry to travel that much. As such, he doesn't know his arse from Ireland from his elbow. Still though, when Draco messages him,
"Potter," he says cautiously, coming to a stop in front of him. "Potter," he repeats more forcefully when Potter doesn't appear to notice him. "Are you okay?"
"I'm just saying." Harry grins up at the ceiling, his chest rising and falling. There a damp patch low on his belly, precome leaking from his cock. He doesn't want to touch himself yet, though, for fear that this will be over too quickly as it is. "I'm feeling pretty easy for it right now."
Draco slumps in his chair, then rests his elbow on the bar and his chin in his cupped palm. His date is not going to show up. This whole evening was a waste of effort and hair product. It's hard enough to find someone who's willing to give Draco a go given his, well,
At first, Harry sees nothing. The sky is dark, pinpricks of stars glittering faintly. They’re easier to see here than in London, and it’s a clear night anyway. Harry’s about to tease Draco for staring up at the stars like a spooked dog when there’s nothing there, just a vast stretch of barren nothing to rival even the marshland in front of them, when finally, he sees it.
He also knows he’s deeply biased when it comes to Draco and his respective attractiveness. It seems that as Harry’s fondness grew, so changed the way he saw Draco, affection trickling down inside him and settling into a warm pool of attraction.
Ginny snuggles closer, and Harry leans into her for a moment to make it clear that, terrible metaphors aside, he’s not offended or bothered or uncomfortable. He is, in a way, but he doesn’t want her to know it. "Don’t be a martyr mushroom, got it," he mumbles. "God, I sound a bit rubbish, don’t I?" He’s suddenly feeling tired and emotional, the way honesty always makes him feel. He wants to crawl away from this conversation, skin first, but he doesn’t.
“Yeah, I do,” Harry says, because he wants to stay with him in this bathroom and he wants the way that Draco’s face is both serious and calm and he’s curious, morbidly so. He doesn’t know how it would feel, if he would look nice or just strange with his lips colored and shimmer on his skin. It seems, in the senseless way that felix felicis does, like a good idea.
There’s a moment of silence, before Pansy smiles over at Hermione. “They looked terrified, didn’t they?”
“It is, its bollocks and it’s stupid,” Harry says, angrily spearing a piece of broccoli. Draco is giving him a weird, unreadable look again so Harry ploughs on, unable to stop himself. “I’m serious, I’m fucking sick of it. It was fucking stupid when Lupin had to resign for being a werewolf and its even stupider now. It’s not like you chose to be one, and even if you did, who fucking cares. Being a werewolf has fuck all to do with what kind of person someone is. It’s complete bollocks.”
Harry nods, hoping they aren’t missing something. “That’s what Malfoy thinks too. No past charges, so I can’t figure out why she would intentionally tamper with anything.”
Harry stiffens, but there’s no malice in Draco’s words. Draco disappears behind the blue curtain and Harry looks up as an older man shuffles in. He’s always surprised to find other people in this sanctuary, even though logically he knows this is just a shop. It feels like more, he can’t explain it.
“I suppose,” Draco says, slurping a little on his next sip in a way that Harry is sure is supposed to annoy him. Draco makes as if to raise his wand, but Harry shakes his head, feeling almost nervous.
“I didn’t say you had to care, I’m just saying you didn’t,” Draco said, and Harry didn’t know how they’d gotten here, why she felt so bad for not liking Goyle who’d been nothing but just as nasty as Malfoy. She thought she should have a better defense but nothing was coming to mind.
“Sorry.” Ron grins as the knife deposits itself neatly next to the cutting board. Harry tucks his bare feet on the first rung of the stool and starts chopping up the strawberries, sneaking one into his mouth when Ron turns back to the eggs.
Draco blinks at him, exhaustion and confusion mingling in his expression. “You’re such an aggressively good person,” he says finally, refocusing on his doodling.
Draco looked like he was on the verge of a retort, before schooling his expression into careful coolness. “You’re quite right Potter, I should be going inside.”
“Of course,” Draco replies. “It takes a lot of effort to be as perfect as I am.” He crosses his legs the other way, glancing out the window. “I don’t want to do anything wrong.”
Draco looks down at his hands, folding them neatly in front of him. Even when Draco isn’t flushed his skin is still a soft pink, like the blood is still too close to the surface. “I suppose I should call you Harry like everyone else,” he says, making it sound like a question. Harry is stunned into silence and he rushes to explain himself. “Just, you called me Draco just then, I thought—“
Hermione nods, taking a delicate nibble of a piece of candied ginger now that she’s finished her sandwich. She offers him one, which he accepts. She keeps a nearly unlimited supply in her purse. “You sure the assistant’s innocent? You know how we were at fifteen. Mounting secret plots. Breaking the law. Committing treason.”
Draco makes a sour face, setting the box down next to his cauldron and beginning to spell portions of the brew into the small, blue bottles. “The potion’s ready if anyone is interested.”
The forest made no effort to respond and Harry wandered on, nearly tripping over stray branches, remembering the swinging light of the lantern the night of their detention, the real Draco small and terrified of the dark. They’d been together in the forest once and maybe it was poetic that some version of them was together in the forest again.
Draco nods. "That’s the one, yes. She, well. I spoke with her, and asked after your schedule today in case she knew it and she politely told me to wait here." Draco takes his hands out of his pockets and folds them in front of him, straightening up as he does so. It looks so formal, so stilted, that Harry feels like he’s going to burst out laughing.
He smiled crookedly and Harry snorted at the lie of it; they both knew Draco could sleep through the apocalypse, which was one of the things that had surprised Harry about that first night they’d slept together after an exceptionally dull and drunken Ministry function when they were nineteen. Of course, the first surprise had been that they’d managed to spend an entire evening together without trying to kill each other, beyond the snapped conversation at the beginning of the evening and Harry hitting his head on a shelf during their frantic, drunken grope in the cloakroom when they were meant to be leaving.
“Don’t you dare.” Draco pulled Harry down next to him, with only marginal groaning from Harry. They lay face to face, Draco kissing down Harry’s neck.
He resolves that he’ll take her into town in the next few days. There’s a bike in the garden shed he could use, with a wicker basket on the front he could…well. Perhaps there’s a charm for making cats stay in one place. Harry eyes the cat, which pointedly doesn’t eye him back. He’ll message Hermione. After years with Crookshanks, she must know a trick or two about wrangling cats and feline-adjacent creatures, magical or otherwise. And Harry’s fairly certain this creature isn’t magical. He narrows his eyes all the same.
The glass shower wall is steaming up quickly, yet still cold against Harry's palm as he rests his free hand against it. His other hand slides up and down in a loose fist, his cock thickening as he goes. He rolls his shoulders against the firm spray of the water, letting it give him an impromptu massage. Trust Malfoy to have impeccable water pressure, Harry thinks, hand speeding up as the tension of the night before and his insufficient sleep seems to ebb away.
Across the room, as subdued in movement as Draco's own honey-slowed motions, the figure raises the same hand. There's room between them, three feet or more, but Draco can make this out. He can see the shape of four fingers, a thumb. He can see the raised palm corresponding to Draco's hand. Draco's chest aches, but the feeling seems distant, as if slowed just as his movements are. The melancholy swirling inside him is there, but it feels more peaceful now. Resigned.
"And then Teddy started having night terrors. That something was in his room at night, trying to get him. That he couldn’t move." Potter lets out a shaky breath. "So I left. To try and figure it out on my own, so that no one." He shakes his head. "No one gets hurt in the interim," he finishes grimly.
Draco shrugged, still smiling lazily. He flopped a hand in a careless gesture. “As good as one, though. Malfoy men are very virile.”
"I don’t think I do that." Harry swallows, resisting the urge to get defensive. "Do I?" he asks faintly, after a moment’s pause. He wants to listen to Ginny, even though he also really doesn’t want to. He wishes another drink would magically appear in front of him.
, he tries to say, but the words stick in his throat. He feels warm, his arm tingling where it’s pressed so gently against Draco’s leg. His face flushes, heat spreading from his cheeks outwards, warming his neck and tinging his ears pink. The ground is cold beneath his arse, under his legs, but the light warms his face as he gazes up at it as if he were staring at an open fire.
“Harry?” he mumbled, kissing Harry’s shoulder again. “Did you wake up... something other than hungry?”
Draco feels no threat, now that he understands this broken part of Potter that creeps out in the dark night and finds foothold in dreams. He's struck with the heaviest melancholy for this being, and for the one who is no doubt still sleeping beside him. Draco has no basis of comparison for Potter's life and the experiences he's been shaped by. They are so unique, so unusual, such a mixture of tragedy and success. But this seems especially cruel, even for a boy orphaned before he could speak, even for someone who has lost as much as Harry has. Draco doesn't understand what carrying the Horcrux, the shrivelled and putrid shard of Voldemort's own caustic soul, has done to Harry. It's unmistakable, though, that it's left a hollow where it once was, a void that hasn't been filled. A fracture in what was once a perfect whole.
“C’mere,” Draco says abruptly, reaching back with one hand to thwap at Harry’s chest. Harry laughs softly, confused, as Draco pulls him up behind him. “Third thing,” Draco murmurs, sounding more than half-asleep already. “I like a cuddle.”
“Isn’t it,” the Healer agrees, either in the same position as Harry or simply choosing to ignore it. “Now, side effects. These are thankfully not extreme, which is why I will be discharging you as soon as we are done here. For the duration of the potion-brewing period you will need to be kept in proximity to each other. It’s rare, but we have had some adverse effects between bonded pairs who stray too far away from each other. As such, it would be ideal if you could stay together until Sunday. In the same house, in close quarters.”
"Thanks," Potter mutters as he takes the proffered clothes. Draco does look away when he drops his towel.
"Mmm," he agrees, nodding his head lazily. He needs a nap, a long lie down. And then more of this. Days of this, and just for starters. He can feel himself smiling, tired and dopey. He thinks that of all the things he wants, he might actually get them.
"I thought you knew the answer to that?" he asks, the words a soft rush of breath against Harry's mouth. Harry swallows. They're too close for him to read Draco's expression, but Draco's fingers are soothing as they run over the nape of his neck. The desire pumping through them both hasn't abated.
His dramatic exit earlier was worth it, but it does mean he’s had almost an entire evening to kill on his own since. Figuratively, of course; Draco’s murdered nothing, except the three sheets of paper he shredded while puzzling over what Potter could be looking for. Is he hooked on some mysterious drug, or searching for it? Has he lost a lover? Is he looking for one? Draco pushed that thought away rather quickly, but still. He's been restless and excited, almost agitated, and still is. The rain is refreshing, the cigarette calming his nerves, or acting as placebo for it at least. It's not as if it's going to kill him, anyway.
“Thanks,” Draco croaks. He’s not sure if he means the hand around his wrist, or the bottle of Murtlap Essence.
Harry scratches out his number, ignoring the giddy little swell in his belly in doing so. He's never really given a phone number to someone he's liked before. It feels oddly teenaged, romantic, a stolen scene from one of Dudley's many videotapes that Harry watched as a lonely kid when he had precious time alone in the house.
At 1am, Harry takes himself up to bed. The sheets are soft and cool and comforting, and Harry sort of wants to cry. Things might be fine, he reasons, but he knows in his gut that this radio silence from Draco is not a good sign. If things were fine, and this was something they could laugh off or move on from easily, Draco wouldn’t be avoiding him. And Harry feels like he’s being avoided.
Obviously they would expect Draco to have a contact number. God, he probably even has a bank account. A receipt book.
Harry gets home from his meeting with Aggie at roughly 2pm, after having sat in her office for nearly three hours.
Draco's fingers inside him suddenly feel like too much, but Harry rides it out, letting Draco finish before he tries to shift away. There's nowhere for him to go, really, when they're this close and Harry's half off the bed and uncoordinated to boot, so all he manages to do is jostle Draco slightly. Harry gives up, lies still and tries to catch his breath. Draco’s own breathing is coming out in a damp, uneven rush against the crease of Harry’s thigh.
Potter nods, letting Draco lead the way. He takes the towels Draco gives him, shrugging off his outer layers. He hasn’t spoken much since they left the park. Draco feels almost reluctant to leave him after the conversation they’ve had and the experiences they’ve shared. He forces himself to exit the room and leave Potter to himself.
Harry laughs, then fiddles with his typewriter. It was a gift from Arthur, done up to apparently respond to Harry’s magical signature and automatically correct his spelling into the intended words. Harry hates it. It’s not so much that it doesn’t work, but that it works too fucking well, and Harry ends up with a page and a half about how he wants lemon tart for pudding instead of the next development of Penelope and her sister’s frustrated relationship since Penelope’s divorce. Which is what Harry is currently trying to write, not his bloody shopping list. It’s not his fault he gets hungry and distracted when he’s writing.
“Don’t you want ― oh.” Draco landed on his back as Harry tipped him over and climbed on top of him. He shook his hair out of his eyes in triumph, cock jutting out before him. He gripped it, fisted it slowly then stopped, moving his hands to Draco’s thighs. He stared at Draco’s soft cock, then back up at his face. Draco smirked back at him lazily.
Not an hour after Harry messages. Not during Harry’s Floo call to Ginny. Or the one he had with Ron later. Not during lunch, or in the afternoon, or during dinner. Draco hasn’t responded by the time Harry is pulling his feet up under him on the sofa at 11pm, curled up in a sad ball of hangover, regrets, and cold leftover pizza.
Draco waves a dismissive hand. "Oh, get over yourself, Potter, you’re not that highly sought after," he lies. It’s total horseshit, and both of them know it. Information on Harry Potter’s whereabouts is incredibly highly sought after. "I’ll tell no one. I am the soul of discretion." Draco drops his smile to show he’s being serious here. "But these are my terms. Indulge my curiosity, and it will go no further than this table here." Draco spreads one palm across the wooden table to emphasise his point.
“Anthony Goldstein would you like to go as my friend date?” Harry asked, almost going down on one knee but deciding not to at the last second. “You are not a bad dancer and you use mouthwash so I think it would be great.”
“Why would you believe her over me?” Harry asks, feeling guilty and childish all at once. “You don’t have to worry about it, we’re like, working on things.”
“You weren’t interested in him were you?” Draco asks carefully, and Harry doesn’t know what the correct answer is. Somehow an outright no feels like a lie.
“What are you scared of?” he asked, remembering the first night when Draco had been soft, when he’d read the book aloud and held Harry’s hand even if he pretended he didn’t. This almost felt like that Draco or something close to it, less guarded and more tender. “Other than snakes.”
“She told me her favorite color,” Harry said, trying to shake off the fog of bemusement without success. “I think she is spectacularly drunk.”
“He doesn’t know,” Draco began, stilted, unsure how to convince her to keep his secret with him, to protect Harry, to protect his heart. “He thinks I’m part of the forest. A hallucination.”
“No,” Draco replied, even as Harry saw the tears staining her cheeks and the slow melting of her eyeliner under her eyes.
It’s written in a tight, nervous scrawl, and Harry pictures Draco pacing in his shop, fussing distractedly with a potion while he waits. Harry and the rest of the Aurors have the day off so they can catch up on sleep after the sting, but he knows from experience that going to bed now will just mean staring at his ceiling for another few hours. He dithers on the doorstep before grabbing his broom from the entryway and heading back out into the chill, cloudy morning, a breeze whipping his hair as he pushes off. Even as he flies towards Draco's flat, he's vaguely aware that he has no real reason to go there.
“Why exactly would you smell like a lake?” she pressed, working on the potion like the question wasn’t of much consequence to her.
“She just had to wait it out and eventually she turned back,” Harry says. “This was when we were at Hogwarts together.”
Ron crosses his arms. “Ok, I’ll bite, they don’t know which house to go to because they’re fucking and they didn’t plan it in advance and don’t want to say so in front of us.”
Ever since Pansy and Hermione got trashed and invented an entirely new and dangerous type of strip poker, Draco has been of the opinion that the students at Hogwarts were separated into different houses for their own safety.
The question felt like such a tremendous understatement that he barely even knew where to begin. “A lot.”
“Sorry,” Harry says, letting out a breath too quickly. “That’s not why I brought you here, that was unprofessional.”
He’s beautiful and Harry has known for weeks that he’s beautiful, but has only just found the words for it. Draco says nothing, just watches him and dares him not to move even as the whistle stretches out in the dim kitchen. He looks tired and afraid but almost victorious, like he’s gotten something he wanted, like he’s winning. Harry is so gone.
Draco is looking at him like he’s trying to read his mind. When he finally speaks, it’s as if everything that’s happening is normal.
“Sounds good.” Harry shook out her stiff arms, going to get herself a hair tie. It was only after she’d pulled her hair back that she glanced at Draco, who was standing by the windowsill again, her forehead pressed to the glass.
““They’re okay.” Delia scrunches up her nose. “They don’t know how to fix me yet though. Tried everything in the book, mum says.”
“Good,” Blaise said, stopping by Greg’s bed to rip his covers off and give his hair a muss, startling him out of sleep. “Wake up, you’ll miss all the eggs.”
He hadn’t thought they could find a way to kiss deeper, but it felt deeper still, with Draco’s palm on the bare skin of his shoulder and Harry leaning up to meet him, running his hands up the back of Draco’s shirt.
“Me neither,” Harry says, mulling the problem over. Even as long as he’s been in the wizarding world, he can’t always wrap his head around some of it, the way that people’s prejudices morph in and out of logic. How Ron, who never thought twice about Harry being Indian, would be so callous about Hagrid’s mum being a giant or would mistrust even Professor Lupin. “She’s a pureblood?”
Harry is. The Prophet had given it breathless coverage in the aftermath of the war as they scrounged around for all the feel good stories they could find, gleefully referring to Draco as ‘Chosen One Harry Potter’s former fling,’ which is absolutely the last way anyone should be referring to Draco, reformed Death Eater and general wanker. “Seemed like it was going pretty well.”
Harry wraps his arms around Draco’s shoulders, a hand tangling in Draco’s terribly messy hair. He realizes that if Draco is in love with him, that means he’s allowed to mess up Draco’s perfect hair any time he wants, which makes something explode happily in his chest.
“Luna is lovely,” Anthony agreed. “They offered to let me use their healing crystals yesterday because I told them I wasn’t having a good day.”
“Last suspect is Rob Spreckleroy.” Draco says. The wizard in the third picture looks like the plaster garden gnomes that Muggles have, but in greens and browns. “Halfbood and a long time supplier, so doesn’t seem likely that he’d do something like this, but who knows. He runs a wild frog sanctuary, which I’m not sure is strictly legal. I can’t imagine the climate charms he’s running to produce tropical conditions in rural England, but I don’t ask questions I don’t want to know the answers to.”
Harry is doing a very good job of tamping down a smile, but not quite a good enough job for Draco to not know that’s what’s happening. “Next time, I’m coming all over your gorgeous face.”
“Why does everyone care so much about what I fucking like,” Harry spits, glowering at the far wall, which is blank and white and does nothing to distract him from any of this.
“I don’t know,” Harry replied honestly, thinking guiltily of all the times she’d watched Draco in the Great Hall, over homework, when she should have been doing other things. She wasn’t really sure what it would even be like to cut her out, to have a life that wasn’t in some way tangled with Draco Malfoy. “Do you want that?”
“Maybe, maybe not,” the snake said, continuing its slow loop. The forest was encroaching in around them, growing darker and wilder at the edges, and Harry felt the first flares of fear in his chest. “Your darkness can only hurt you if you pretend it isn’t there. If you pretend you don’t have to know it. Then it’ll encroach in...” the snake slid around and up his leg in one awful movement, curling up over his abdomen and around his neck, never squeezing, just laying there, heavy and writhing. “And swallow you whole.”
Draco scoffs. “You commit, Chosen One. You gave up, what, twenty minutes ago? Don’t pretend its my fault you can’t get your mind to cooperate. You’re lying to yourself ten ways from Friday.”
“You’re a little ridiculous about Malfoy, you know that, right?” Anthony asked mildly, as they continued their waltz.
Draco makes an insubordinate little noise, but doesn’t protest, and Harry ignores him, opening the first door. The child in question has a spout for one arm and a handle for the other, and appears to be the closest thing he’s ever seen to a girl-watering can hybrid. She positively beams when he comes in, huddling shyly under her covers.
Draco materialized a few steps away from where he disappeared, spitting the metal into his palm and pocketing it. Draco’s hair was everywhere, pale white and disheveled in the moonlight. His eyes were far wilder. Harry wasn’t sure he’d describe the expression on his face as a smile. He had such a mouth.
“That would have been my call, two days scrubbing desks for that kind of attitude,” Ron added, fist bumping Harry in agreement. “Calling Ernie hopeless is cold.”
“Oh, right, because Slytherins don’t have feelings,” Potter scoffs, and Draco smiles despite himself.
“Do you really think we’re complementary?” Draco asks, crossing his legs and refusing to make eye contact. “Or were you just saying that?”
That night, the forest smelled odd, something he could only catch brief hints of through the heady scent of earth. It was, he realized after long minutes of walking: roses, a bright winter day, spice, and something else lingering and vaguely familiar.
“Quite sure,” Draco replied, her words prim and crisp even though she smelled like grass and alcohol and ever so slightly of vanilla. “Harry, I have something to tell you.”
“Gender neutral pronouns,” she replies. “You don’t often use those when talking about your romantic interests, so whoever you’re entangled with doesn’t use she/her pronouns.”
“I did see something about capes coming back,” Emma offers, rejoining the conversation. “It’s very glam rock revival.”
Harry stared, the slow elegant sounds of parseltongue making his lips twitch. He hadn’t used it in years and wasn’t sure if he still could, unsure if that part of him had stayed dead.
She thought maybe she was doing an okay job of it, making an effort to correct her posture as Draco whirled her around the room, even shoving her elbow back level when it drifted down. Though Draco had an frustrated glint in her eye as she guided them, she said nothing even as Harry tripped over her own feet.
“Wow,” Harry says, and it comes out more breathy than he’d really intended. At some point, Harry has ended up with both hands looped around Draco’s neck, one tangled in Draco’s hair. “Um. So do I get to touch you now?”
“Potter,” Draco said, raising his voice just loud enough to be heard. “What exactly do you and Weasel-bee think you’re doing?”
“Hope Jenson,” Ron announces beside him, making a dramatic show of relief. “And you got Malfoy, right?”
“I will if you unclench your asshole for two seconds,” Harry bit back, and Draco’s hand tightened on hers in what appeared to be a violent twitch.
“No, you can ask them to start at a certain time like an alarm, they’re very polite,” Blaise said, looking quite pleased at the attention.
“Not particularly wolfy,” Draco says, setting down the napkin he’s pulverizing and nesting his chin on his palm. Harry realizes with a jolt of relief that he’s actually going to answer the questions put to him, which is never a given where Draco is concerned. “As you probably know, the potions have improved quite a bit since the war. Most werewolves choose not to transform at all.”
Harry gave a nod and Draco began to move them in the familiar box, whispering directions as they danced. With Anthony, Harry’d had the distinct impression that he was dragging her through the dance, but with Draco it felt more like they were dancing together, like Draco was just guiding her through the steps.
Harry blinked at her, willing himself to nod. It seemed like he’d been going to the forest forever, like everything that had existed before the forest was a sepia blur and it was only after that he’d been able to shift his life back into color. “Can’t all be steps forward, can it?” he said, shaking himself out and giving her a smile he hoped was encouraging.
She frowned. “I just think that as professional healers they should have some alternative treatment. It’s horrible that they can’t fix it.” Harry knew for a fact that she often went to the library and researched sleeping potions for him and that nothing she tried worked, at least not for long.
“Are you okay?” Harry said, watching the worry lines that appeared on the sides of Draco’s pursed mouth, the shiftiness in his eyes, the way his chest heaved even though he wasn’t moving. “Are you breathing alright?”
“Do you think?” Harry asked, sneaking another glance and meeting gray eyes. The bags under Draco’s eyes were much less pronounced than normal and his hair was artfully arranged like he’d actually put some effort into it. Harry was used to the way it stuck up in the mornings and he was a little irritated that Draco’d had the audacity to style it. “He looks fucking serene. I could just hex him.”
“Is that a come on?” Harry asks, and then, when Draco just glares at him, “Yeah, after shifts a lot when I’m too wired to sleep. It’s weird enough here that no one pays me much attention.”
“You’re going to scuff my shoe,” Draco said, pulling his feet back from Harry. “These aren’t sneakers, you know.”
“You wouldn’t be an experiment,” Harry replies, realizing only halfway through what he’s implying. If he’s not experimenting, then this means something, that all of this is more than he’s trying so hard to pretend.
I wonder if they’d let you visit the manor if you asked. I feel like that’s the sort of privilege they’d afford to you. They have it under guard now, I think if they weren’t so afraid of the house they’d have sent us all to Azkaban already. They’re so skittish, I suspect they’re under the impression that as soon as the Malfoys leave the Manor there will be some horrible House of Usher event and the whole thing will collapse into the ground. I almost hope it does.
"You’re clearly something," Draco presses. "To be here, to get a foot in the door. What is it, werewolf? Shapeshifter? Zombie?" Draco suggests unkindly.
The figures watches him all day, scoping him out, searching. Draco stays in that place that feels like it exists between waking and dreaming, lucid enough to know what’s going on but still unable to move. Neither he nor the figure move for hours and hours.
Harry stands upright again, shaking himself off and running his hands over his overheated face. He chalks it up to the weird night, not enough sleep perhaps making him woozy and hornier than usual, and nothing more.
"You say it." Draco gestures at Potter as he raises his glass to his lips. "You being here, you waiting for me. You want something." He takes a sip. "Don’t be shy, we’re all friends here now." He can’t keep the disdain out of his voice as he says the word
about the war. It wasn’t very nice. It was hideously impolite of them to do it at Sarah’s, and Harry will blame the whisky sours for that, along with a general lack of impulse control. And a lifetime of trauma. That’ll usually set him off. He’s not sure what Draco’s excuse was, but Harry thinks it might be something pretty much along the same lines.
"Yeah," Draco groans his response, fucking Harry on his fingers and pulling Harry off with his other hand. "God, this feels so good." Draco shakes his fringe out of his eyes again, a losing battle giving his damp forehead. He laughs, breathlessly. "And so weird."
"Harry!" Draco touches him on the elbow, gently coaxing him to turn around. "Shut up about biscuits, yeah?" he says, but he’s smiling, fonder than ever.
When Harry comes it’s with a mouthful of Draco’s hair in his gob, his hand fisted in the back of Draco’s shirt and his toes curling hard in his shoes. He gasps, spurting over Draco’s hip and the base of his shirt, making a mess between them. Draco follows soon after with a gut-punched grunt, his mouth open in an almost-bite against Harry's shoulder as he pumps his hips against Harry’s hot skin.
It’s true. Since becoming sort of friendly-ish, to then becoming actually friendly text mates, there has been a lot of speculation about the history between Draco and Harry. It’s all bollocks, of course; Harry properly hated Malfoy in school, and the feeling was mutual. And very fucking warranted as far as Harry’s concerned. It’s just…not so warranted, now.
to cast the room into complete darkness. The silence that comes with it feels deafening. Draco listens to it, tries to make himself feel comfortable. He can hear from the tone of Potter’s breathing that he’s not asleep yet either. It’s not surprising, therefore, when Potter speaks.
"Mmm." Draco pretends to think. "I have to say, if this is how you’ve eluded discovery for all these years, just politely asking people not to disclose they saw you, it’s an unusual approach. But I could be amenable to that. You’ll have to make it worth my while, though."
"Like." Harry licks his lips, unsure of what he wants to say, if he even needs to. He wants to hear it, though. "Is it just right now?"
badly it’s kept you up at night, and then once it’s there, right in front of you, it’s too good. It just, can’t be real." Draco’s fingers curl over Harry’s hip, digging in ever so slightly. Harry's heart feels like it’s trying to thump out of his chest. Draco licks his spit-shiny lower lip. "You’re like that to me."
But those things aside, he was in fine form, and he was still working, because there was no way he was going to sit at home for nine bloody months getting fat on cream biscuits and expanding exponentially in all directions. No, he was Head fucking Auror, and he would continue to be
He’s trying to summon up enough courage to push his hand up Draco’s shirt and feel the skin of his chest when a soft burbling alarm goes off and Draco pulls back, his lips wet and still so red. “That’s me.”
9. On the run, trying to torture a muggle family for sport, Bellatrix Lestrange went up like a gust of wind. She went up into the inkblack night like a cackle the second she cast, the soft, brutal animal engulfing her even as the rest of them tried to put her out. There was no stopping the flames. They should have suspected Draco all along, Harry thought. He always loved a spectacle.
Draco looks up at the window, giving a little wave when he notices him. Harry pushes into the store, embarrassed at being caught. “Hey,” Harry says, pulling flowers out from behind his back. “I brought something for you.”
44. It occurs to Harry that Draco can die, like Hermione can die, like Ron can die, like Neville and Luna and Ginny can die. He knows other people could die but it always comes to him like that, as a revelation. Draco assures Harry that the Death Eaters don’t suspect him, that they’re too stupid, that he’s too good of a showman or a liar. Harry doesn’t know how comforting this is supposed to be, because he knows that Draco is lying, in some way, about something. It’s never been entirely clear how much danger Draco is in.
“It won’t change anything,” Draco says, sounding resigned. His voice has lost the aggressive tilt, going limp like wet laundry on a line. “That’s only one part of the riddle.”
is right up there, too. His father’s never hit him before, and Draco’ll be damned if he hangs around to see if someday Lucius actually will. Draco’s a coward, but he’s also proud, and it seems his pride will trump a roof over his head. Maybe leaving
"Do you, though?" Ginny looks at him disbelievingly. "You don’t have to just let things happen to you when you aren’t enjoying them anymore."
Harry wakes up with two things: a bit of a hangover, from too much wine shared with Aggie over some pretty average korma, and several new messages from both Hermione and Draco.
Draco shrugs. "It’s what I do. I ask questions. I find things out. I’m nosey." He cocks his head to the side. "And I’m a private investigator. I make it my business to know other people’s business." Draco waits to see Potter bristle at this information. Right on cue, Potter tenses.
As far as distraction techniques went, it was very effective. Draco grunted, bottom lip caught between his teeth and the humour leaving his face as his thrust turned choppy. His hair was sticking to his forehead, the damp tendrils turned a darker blond as they curled over his brows and down his neck. God, he was so fucking fit. Harry dug his fingers into Draco’s wrists, grinned at the hissed intake of breath that earned him. Draco always liked things tinged with an edge of pain, Harry had learned, and from the glassy look in his eyes it was working now.
Harry's breath catches on a surprised laugh. "Um. Yeah." He licks his lips as he looks down at Draco's face. Harry feels heat throb through him, his balls tighten, as Draco's smile turns wicked.
"Strange," Draco mumbles, flattening his palm over Harry's jaw and letting his fingers cup behind Harry's ear. "Do you feel…"
Harry sets his quill on the table, telling himself it’s a good idea he’s being thrown over for a two-year-old’s toilet needs, because it’s about time he fucking got this novel on the road. He’s not getting up again until he’s written a chapter. Or, like, a page. A bloody paragraph. Harry cracks his knuckles, determined and motivated and god who is he kidding? He’s not going to write a fucking thing today. Harry gets up to make more tea instead.
." He mimes vomiting with his hand, an accurate representation of the emotional word vomit Harry presented him with.
Draco shrugs, one shoulder lifting and dropping with easy confidence. “Then I'll show you how to get better.”
Harry laughs, almost banging his head on the open cupboard door. "I know, I’m not trying to outdo you." He wriggles when Draco pinches him again, just hard enough to hurt nicely. "What I mean, is. You’re not likely to frighten me off by having a kid and an ex-wife, and…all this," Harry waves a hand over Draco, encompassing all of him: the pale Malfoy hair and grey eyes, the scarred mark on his arm that he tries to hide with long sleeves, the criss cross of scars along his chest. All the marks of their shared history, intertwined and grisly, that they both bare in different ways and which never fully healed over or went away, and likely never will. All of this doesn’t frighten Harry off.
The room is sterile and welcomingly bland. Harry sits in a chair, opposite the Healer attending to them. His head aches, his stomach churning. He doesn’t feel ill, so much as wrong all over. The lights hurt his eyes.
Either way, Draco likes seeing him here too much to risk upsetting their unexpected gentle truce, and their late night garden meetings, by bringing up difficult subjects. He can feel his cheeks heating even as he thinks it.
"Sorry," Draco places an apologetic kiss at Harry's perineum. "Cleaning charm's are always so invasive."
“Hello darling,” he mutters softly, stroking down her sleek, grey body. She trembles with happiness, ears soft and tail wagging. Such an odd thing, Harry thinks as he plays at the soft fur around her ears. She’s elegant the way all Saluki’s Harry's seen are, beautiful and slender and with the loveliest long ears, but she's so awkward, too, such a bundle of nervous energy. Harry's never had a pet that wasn't airborne and never cared much for them either, but he feels a thrill of being special every time she comes up to him, while shying away from other people. Animals are always honest, and Harry doesn't give much of a flying fuck what people think of him, but he values all creatures' opinions. Perhaps it's a throwback to that very first time Buckbeak bowed to him, deemed him worthy of a ride.
"Thank you," Draco says, on a sudden wave of emotion. He's not sure why he feels the need to say it. This isn't a gift. This is a job for him, not something he needs to be grateful for. But equally, it
“Would it have been so bad if, you know.” He shrugged one shoulder, still holding the blue positive paper slip tight between forefinger and thumb. “If it had worked too well?”
The rush of air against bare skin as Potter peels his pants down is jarring, but brief, as Potter leans in quickly. Draco twitches at the first feel of Potter's lips on his semi-hard cock, already overstimulated and edgy. It's a wonderful feeling, so much pent-up arousal filling every vein. When Potter mouths at the head of his cock, hot tongue pressing against Draco's burning skin, Draco's mouth drops open. His head falls back against the dark grey cubicle wall with a thud.
?” Draco asks in lieu of properly responding. Standing in front of Harry now, he’s almost close enough for Harry to touch him with his outstretched hand, to brush his fingers across his chest and the soft wool of his shirt.
"Calm down, Malfoy," Potter mutters, using two fingers to align his coaster with the grain of the wood on the table between them. "Don’t get your knickers in a twist."
Draco bites at Harry’s jaw. "Thank you," he murmurs. "This isn’t too fast. The bits I’m bad at…" Draco sighs. "I’ll try bloody hard at them, I can give you that. I’ve learned that the hard way." His lips quirk up into a smile. "And this"—he presses his thick thigh against Harry’s cock, making Harry suck his stomach in and hiss through his teeth—"this is the bit I’m actually good at," Draco murmurs, pressing their lips together.
“So what are we looking for, again?” Harry adjusts his position on the log; his arse is either too bony, or this log is the most uncomfortable piece of wood Harry’s ever encountered. Not having sat on that many fallen trees, his base of reference is not huge, but he feels a growing sympathy already with Draco’s arse for having already been out here in their makeshift hideout for a good hour before Harry.
Harry laughs, struggling one leg and then the other into his joggers. He remembers that banana bread. He thinks it’s still with the Unspeakables, which is hilarious given that the banana bread kept, well,
Astoria was also not back from France, but Scorpius was. At home with a babysitter, Draco drunkenly told Harry, and Harry just nodded, still concentrating on the wings of his napkin crane. It took him the better part of the evening to realise this was actually a bit odd, and it still didn’t even twig when Aggie told him to keep an eye on Draco as he stumbled off to the loo looking a bit green. "I think his wife’s just left him. Harry," she said, exasperated but not unkind, when Harry didn't seem to understand why he ought to be following Draco into a toilet. "And I think he’s also about to vom."
The home owners are always on their last fraying nerve and feeling less than sensible, and thus more than happy to let the charming man with the scrappy blond bun, denim overalls and stupid name fix up their house while they bugger off to Malta for some R and R and to Obliviate themselves with mojitos.
"Hmm?" Draco looks up briefly before looking at his own hands as he starts to undo the drawstring of Harry's joggers. His fingers bump against Harry's cock, large and insistent and in the way, and they both gasp.
“Sleep well?” Draco asks, gesturing at the display of food before them and signaling for Harry to help himself. Harry smiles his thanks, then runs his hand over his hair. It’s already almost completely dry; there's only about a centimeter of it at the moment, just enough to suggest the tangled curls that threaten to burst back if Harry will let them, and it dries quickly.
The aftermath being, one of them would be pregnant. It would definitely be more proactive than spending another night staring at their pros and cons chart and being aggressively supportive of each other.
Well, he does two things monumental, really. First of all, after a strong mug of tea and a pep talk, he de-cobwebs the bike in the garden shed, greases the chain and evicts several spiders from the wicker basket so that he can take Cat to the vets and find out if she really is looking for a home, or just fancies her freedom and the odd outdoor shit. He even finds a helmet, and cleans it up, before deciding not to wear it because he looks like enough of a dickhead and it doesn’t fit properly over his hair. The thought is there, though.
Draco finally takes a sip, then closes his eyes as he sighs, pleased. Harry watches for a moment, Draco’s breath fogging out in front of him through pink lips. Harry follows the trace of steam back to the curve of Draco’s lips, then quickly looks away when Draco’s eyes blink open.
Harry laughs at him, too charmed by Nettle leaning up to rest her paws on Draco’s thighs to be really offended by the comment. “Oh, piss off,” he says without feeling, “and get out of the way, Malfoy.” Harry slips his way past Draco and the dog, and their strange waltz of a greeting. “And hello, Nettle, you look lovely as always,” Harry adds. “Have you had a haircut?” Nettle wags her tail back at him enthusiastically.
“Who cares about sleep.” Draco ran his hand around the curve of Harry’s arse, underneath his underwear. He pressed his fingertip against Harry’s hole. “I want to eat you,” he mumbled against Harry’s mouth.
attention. He's settled for negative over the years, but to solve a problem for Potter? Draco’s alive with the desire to come through on this.
He dreams that there are vines growing out of his Mark and the raw patches over it, long and twisted and beautiful. Their flowers unfurl their papery petals, blue blood pumping through them, and receding back into the deep green vines. They curl around Draco’s wrists, tendrils creeping under Harry’s loose fingers and across his skin too, twining and growing until they’re a tangled mess with no beginning or end. There’s dirt on Draco’s skin, and in his blood, and the longer he dreams the longer the vines twist and grow until his fingers feel still and the itch under his skin goes quiet.
The closer Draco gets to Potter, the more he realises he doesn't know how to read this mood. Potter is pacing back and forth with short and choppy steps. He has one hand on his hip, the other over his mouth, occasionally moving it up to scrub agitatedly through his hair or to rub at his eyes behind his glasses. There's colour on his cheeks and a brightness to his eyes that Draco doesn't think he's seen on him before. Belatedly, Draco realises that Potter is not angry or pissed off. He's upset.
It occurs two weeks after leaving the Manor, in the company of a tall man with the most impressive pair of incisors Draco’s ever seen. It’s amazingly unexpected and brilliantly inconvenient, and Draco doesn’t even notice it’s happening until what he thought was going to be a quickie behind the back of the Knockturn Alley pub Draco’s been staying at turns into, "
There's only one person it can be. Aneta solely contacts him via correspondence, and their meetings have all been at her residence. She hasn’t come to his place, and has no reason to. Besides her, Draco doesn’t know anyone else in this city, or even this country, who would have cause or desire to visit him.
Potter is standing still against the wall, but there's a frenetic energy coming off him, as if he's ready to buzz out of his skin. Whatever he didn't find out from Darya the Necromancer has obviously deeply affected him. Left to his own devices, Draco suspects Potter might just remain here, leant against grimy bricks in an even grimier alleyway in Prague and staring disconsolately up at the dark sky. Draco doesn't want that. He wants to keep him a little longer.
Harry seems fidgety tonight, Draco slowly notices, as he settles into his usual spot next to him: back against the cool glass, Harry’s wand casting low light before them, shoulder and knee pressed against Harry’s and the overgrown plants hiding them from view. Harry’s not restless enough to disrupt the rhythm of their usual routine, but it is noticeable. Draco sits as still as he can, waiting to see what it is. His arm itches and his fingers twitch, and he rubs the soft heel of his palm over it, fights not to jiggle his knee at the sensation. He needs to leave it alone. He
"Love, you’re a month away from deadline and you’ve written sod all. You can’t get anymore jinxed." Agatha’s words are blunt, but her expression is sympathetic. Harry magnanimously chooses not to take offense, even though every petulant bone in his body wants to get stroppy about it. It passes quickly, thank god; Harry’s far too old to be having a tantrum in front of his agent, no matter how much he wants to. He pours some tea for Agatha, and then for himself, reaching up to grab a packet of chocolate digestives from the highest cupboard. He raises one eyebrow in question and Agatha nods approvingly at the selection. They head towards the small kitchen table.
. He wants to give everything and greedily take whatever he can from Potter, let him fill the hollows deep in Draco's chest where human companionship used to lie.
"He made seven," Potter says after a short while of walking together through the park. He tucks his hands in his jeans' pockets. "Six on purpose, and one unintentionally." His voice is matter-of-fact and bland.
It seems like a bigger admission than it is, and Harry shuts his eyes against the fondness he sees on Draco's face. When he opens them, he looks down at Draco's wrist. He can see the pale blue lines of his veins, the ropey stretch of tendons. There's something vulnerable about this place, Harry thinks, where the skin seems so thin. He opens his mouth, lets his breath gust over Draco’s wrist. Draco’s fingers press more tightly against the soft hair at the back of Harry's head.
Harry thinks. Then makes a face. Most of everyone already knows the bare bones of his early life, and the borderline invasively intimate details of his life since Hogwarts. He’d prefer not to ever write about the Dursleys, really. His expression turns sour.
“At five.” Draco lay back, pulling Harry onto his stomach. It was awkward, Harry’s belly in the way. He braced his hands on the bed, looking at Draco’s sharp grey eyes, just visible in the dim moonlight streaming in through his window.
here." He resists the urge to bare his teeth, let his fangs descend. "This is where my kind are often found." Any doubts he had about whether Potter was aware of what had happened to Draco are gone when Potter’s eyes flick down to his mouth and away again.
Potter is wearing the same clothes he had on at the bar. His hair is getting flattened somewhat by the rain, the drops missing his glasses by clear way of magic. Draco thinks he can see purple bags developing under his eyes. Draco's address is plainly visible on Potters arm, the ink starting to smudge away. He's holding something, a Manila folder half tucked under his jacket. It's charmed, but Draco senses Potter was instinctively protecting it from the rain. Draco desperately wants to know what's in it, if Potter bringing it to him means what he thinks it does.
Harry took a deep breath, or as much of one as he could manage considering Draco was fucking him halfway up the bed. “I want you to come, I wanna feel it inside me, making me,
“Oh, ta.” Draco accepts it gratefully, long fingers curling over the cool silver flask. “Here I am, yes. Excellent surveillance there on your part, Potter, you should consider being an Auror.”
Draco raises his faint eyebrows and Harry is relieved to find he looks somewhat mollified. He thinks that the Draco of their sixth year or even right after the war would have bolted by now. He still looks like he was recently dragged from a swamp, but he’s not going anywhere. Harry is still turning it over in his head, what it means that there’s a version of Draco that wants to do the right thing, even though it’s neither easy nor glamorous.
He wondered what he’d come across that night and felt an unintelligible pang at the thought of Draco stumbling across him in his pants. It made him wish he hadn’t been so quick to abandon his pajamas. He hoped Draco wouldn’t laugh at him, even though he wasn’t sure of much else, he suspected that forest Draco’s laughter would be kind.
10. Harry wished Ron and Neville wouldn’t read the Prophet. This was one of the few things he and Ginny reliably agreed on.
“Point taken,” Harry replied, glancing back down at the little chalk feet she was meant to be stepping in.
The forest breathed a hello, a welcome back, and Hermione looked up at the trees, frowning like she almost understood. The forest rained flower petals on Hermione’s head and made a decision, almost laughing at the fun of it as she led Draco slowly towards her.
They fell asleep among the flowers in the early hours of the morning and when they woke apart at the edges of the forest the tiredness didn’t hang from their bones the way it used to. Draco recognized the feeling from the sleepovers of his youth and smiled all the way back to the Slytherin common room. Harry thought it felt a little like his first year at Hogwarts: all blurry eyed tiredness and the warm memories of friends close by.
“If you can perfect the under-arm turn by the end of the lesson I’ll tell you,” Draco said finally, like she thought the entire prospect unlikely.
The letters arrived at breakfast the second week of November. They looked fairly inconspicuous as they landed on everyone’s plates, but Harry let out a long groan as soon as she got hers open.
Draco jumps away from Harry, doing such a terrible impression of innocence that Harry can’t fight a wicked smile. “I assure you I can explain-”
“Let’s just figure out how to get out of here,” Dara says. “New plan, if we just keep blasting the walls, they’ll eventually cave?”
“Do you think you could trick me into it?” Harry asks, realizing only after its out of his mouth that it sounds like a challenge.
Draco wanted to kiss him again, properly this time. It was pathetic, and it made him want to kick something, to tear something apart because it wasn’t fair that he couldn’t, it wasn’t fair that Harry wouldn’t want to, not even in the forest. He deserved just the smallest bit of something, even if it was stolen dream kisses.
“If you’re buying,” Draco says, which is a little ridiculous considering that Draco is, historically, quite rich. Harry is also historically quite rich, but Draco has been much more of a cunt about it.
He wandered through the woods, a path failing to present itself like she wasn’t guiding him this time, like she didn’t have magic greater than his and he had to choose his own way through the trees. The forest was dark without the phosphorescence of her leaves or the soft glow of bugs and Harry lit the way with his wand, feeling like he had come back to the beginning and back to the end. He wondered with a jolt of fear if Draco would even come or if Harry’d broken the illusion with his decision to leave.
“Ellen is a squib,” Draco replies, his voice almost gentle. “The rest of them are muggles.” He takes a quick breath and Harry can hear it pass his lips. “They don’t know who you are. Ellen won’t say anything.”
Harry just looked at her, her gray eyes and the angles of her face and the way her hair fell into her face sometimes. “I haven’t really had time to think about it.”
This is the only level of conversation that Draco is going to be able to sustain for the rest of the party. “What else is it telling you?” He asks Luna, determined to prolong this as long as he can, when he, mistake of all mistakes, glances over at Harry.
Rob nods, stewing on the question for a moment. “Well, that was about a week ago. I usually bring Puddle a few fresh three banded bulltoads. She uses ‘em for her cooking.”
He pushed open the doors, cringing when they creaked and Draco looked up to see him, his eyes going wide at Harry’s entrance. Last time Harry had tried to ask him how he was, he’d pushed back. He thought that maybe if he just acted normally, like they were friends, it would be okay.
It was frustrating not to have either the glances across the great hall or the sharpness of his tongue in the forest, and it made Harry want to do something rash. He knew it wasn’t in his best interest to antagonize Draco, but it took all of his self control not to march over to the table and say something mean just for the hell of it. He thought he was beginning to understand what forest Draco had meant about not knowing how to interact with him. In the forest, it had seemed to make more sense, but in real life all Harry knew how to do was wind Draco up and try to goad him.
Draco’s carrying tension in his shoulders and Harry wishes he knew what he was feeling if nothing else. “It’s Pansy’s, I’m borrowing it.”
Draco looks up at him with a bloody grin, letting Harry haul him up as they’re approached from all sides by security wizards. Draco slides behind him so they’re standing back to back, firing off spells at the opposition. Harry can see Ron and Dara to their left doing the same, and is pleased to see that Dara has somehow got her hands on a wand and is doling out hexes with impressive gusto.
Draco pushed his wet hair off his face and tugged his wand out of the waistband of his pants, striding up to Harry and spelling his glasses dry. Even as a mirage, he was mussed up and turned around and the familiarity of that was almost comforting.
As the hour ticked from three to four, some part of him began to understand that he was going to return to the forest, could hear the creak of the castle walls as they tried to coax him out, and the whisper of the trees and they called him back. Maybe he could go to the forest without kissing Harry again, or maybe he could kiss him again and have it not matter. He knew he was lying to himself, but it was all beginning to blur together.
“When are you going to get it through your head,” Draco said, his voice going tighter and tighter, like a rubber band pulled taunt and waiting to snap. “That I have never once been able to be anything I want.”
“Wasn’t sure you’d be able to make it. I found a few things,” Draco says, giving him a whisper of a smile and leading him over to a square table boasting a large, green table lamp.
“Almost certainly,” Draco says, and Harry marks it down as he holds up a photo of his next suspect. “Opal McGovern is definitely fine. She’s one of mother’s new pureblood friends, and is definitely just a batty old lady.” Draco waves a photo of what appears to be a gray-haired Stevie Nicks in dress robes standing in a butterfly enclosure. She has a large, pink butterfly resting on her head. “She’s my newest supplier, but I don’t think she’s the issue…” Draco trails off, watching the picture with a furrow in his brow. “I think she just really likes bugs,” he says finally, as if this is the most confusing explanation he’s ever been faced with.
Harry closes his eyes, catching his breath. He can still sense the afternoon sunlight behind his closed lids, hear the breeze rustling through the tall trees in his garden. The cupboard ledge is hard against the back of his head, the edge of the kitchen bench digging a hard line into his bum. This situation between them is getting sticky and gross. Harry slings his free arm low around Draco’s waist, letting his forearm touch bare skin. He kind of wants to stay here forever.
Instinctively, Draco adds, "Don't worry, that doesn't mean you're my type either." It's far more mumbled than he meant it to sound, and a lot less like a casual remark. Draco's always been a shit liar that way. He's not sure why he felt it necessary either; Potter invaded his personal space in a big way only moments prior. Draco suspects his deeply ingrained fear of rejection is running this particular dialogue. The knee-jerk reaction to try and get in and spurn the other person, before they can politely or even rudely dismiss him, is a hard one to fight. Despite all his previous efforts, Draco finds his face is heating now, growing warmer under Potter's scrutiny.
“What’re you so pleased about?” Harry said, running his hands over Draco’s hip bones. Draco raised his eyebrows as if Harry was being especially thick, which he possibly was; it was always just that little bit harder to string together coherent, sensible thoughts when Draco was naked and underneath him. The smirk did get him off a bit, too.
“Um,” Harry says, at a loss for a moment at what to say. He isn’t sure if Draco knows he can feel what's going on inside him, but based on Draco’s expression he would hazard not―Harry’s certain that if Draco knew, he wouldn’t be able to help reacting with embarrassment, or denial. “Guess that’s the downside of being my ex,” he says, hoping a joke will diffuse the tension and ease Draco’s discomfort, currently simmering inside Harry. “Have to still sort through my pants and bring me socks when I get in a tight spot.”
"Ah, shit," says Harry out loud, sagging in his chair. That clearly didn’t work, then. He needs to think of a reply that is somehow dismissive, clever and friendly all at once. He’s basically settled on sending a very mature response of
Draco sighs, and grabs a top off the floor, long-sleeved and grey, and leaves his pyjama bottoms on. He slips on socks, his shoes, and his thickest cloak, then drags a brush through his overly long hair. It needs to be cut; he can tuck it behind his ears, an almost bob. He looks mildly ridiculous ― tall and thin and with blue veins showing through his pale skin, and a Little Lord Fauntleroy hairdo. He’s an awkward scarecrow of a boy.  Pansy would laugh, if she was here, and if she did much of that these days. He hopes she’s drowning her sorrows, at least, in Grappa and Tiramisu in the sweet Florentine sunshine.
“Exactly.” Draco grinned, slow and sated. He stretched one leg out until his ankle was resting on Harry’s shoulder. “We don’t need to come again.” He dropped one arm to the bed beside his head, then stretched languorously. His grin widened, growing more mischievous and self-satisfied at the same pace as Harry’s frown deepened.
Potter stops briefly, shooting Draco the withering glance that his question rightfully deserves. Draco ploughs on regardless.
Harry celebrates this small-yet-enormous victory by getting a sausage roll from the bakery up the street on his way home. As celebrations go, it’s pretty meagre and pathetic but rather suits Harry all the same. He grabs a few other groceries, milk and bread and a newspaper he’s going to pretend to read, and then finds a nice quiet spot around the back of the post office so he can Apparate into his home, because it’s a nice day but bugger the walk. He’s had a heartbreak, he deserves to be a bit lazy.
Draco’s left hand is on his knee. He tightens his fingers on the denim of his jeans, lets his short nails scratch against it. He wants to touch Potter, to offer some comfort. No gesture seems fitting, though, and while the intimacy built from their prior tryst in the club has not dissipated, the mood has so utterly shifted now. "And you’ve been doing that since?" Draco says, his voice rough.
Harry isn't especially vocal in bed, or he never has been before. He isn't silent, far from it, but he's never wanted to moan into a kiss like he does now, or to whine like he does when Draco slips him tongue. Harry's forehead creases, his own fingers tangling in the soft strands of Draco's hair as he pulls Draco closer. Draco’s fingers move to his neck as he kisses Harry again, and again, until Harry's lips feel bruised with it. He clutches Draco's hair tighter.
He extends one hand as far as he can with this limited movement. He feels like he's lifting it though molasses, his motions slowed and heavy. He holds his hand out, palm up, as he watches the figure watch him. He doesn't know if he can touch it, if he would want to—if it's even really here. The soul, Draco knows, is a real thing, but it's also the most intangible of magical elements a wizard may possess. This shadowy being, born of the apparent hollow left inside Potter, seems impossible to touch, like trying to hold smoke in cupped palms. Still, Draco holds his palm out.
“Oh hell.” Draco’s hips worked faster, head dropping so low his hair was tickling Harry’s collarbone now. It was a bit nice.
Potter stares at him for a long moment. Draco is braced for a tirade, for Potter to get up and leave. "It’s hard to find," is all Potter gives him instead.
Draco huffs out a silent laugh, then rubs at his eye with two fingers of his left hand. Like that, the tension between them breaks, the trickle of feeling creeping up Harry’s spine down from his nape is gone. It’s all him now. He likes that he can tell that; it confirms even more so that there was something there that wasn’t coming from him before.
“Its not that I want to kill you,” Harry says, not bothering to clarify the ambiguity. He ruminates over his next words, unsure how to unspool them right. “We’re evenly matched.”
“Maybe choose one that doesn’t have ‘sea’ in the title if you don’t want to hear about fish,” Harry replied, almost affectionately.
“Are you, you know, sleeping okay?” Harry asked, his voice cracking on the first you even as he tried to keep it steady.
“Hey,” Harry says, coming around to where Draco is thumbing through a file cabinet of old issues of the Prophet, repeating to himself that he’s here for casework and nothing else. He wants to pretend that he doesn’t know why he has to keep reminding himself that.
“Weren’t you raised by wizards?” Harry asks, tapping on the counter and watching as Malfoy avoids his gaze. “Most pureblood families don’t teach courses in radio repair, or so I’ve been told.”
“Kind of fucked up,” Ginny said, avoiding his eyes and dropping three seeds in the dirt, covering them with freckled hands. “Like actually doing it. I don’t know. Wouldn’t you feel complicated about it?”
“But you just won’t give up, will you?” Draco asked tiredly, the answer already written on her face.
“We should head inside, it’s getting cold,” Harry murmured when they broke apart for breath, their lips numb and the warming charm beginning to dissipate as its caster became too distracted to maintain it.
“So maybe I did,” Harry said stubbornly. “Sorry I thought maybe what happened last night meant we might consider each other something other than enemies. Considering literally everything we’ve been through.” She knew the second the words came out that they were just a smidge too far over the line.
“Do you wish it was real?” Draco asked, the shaking of his hand making the light quaver. His breathing was wrong and Harry was sorry he’d never been good at compartmentalizing, was sorry that everything ran together.
“They’ve definitely been dating for close to a year,” Hermione corrects. “And the poor girl isn’t out to her parents, it’s lovely of Molly to knit her something nice.”
He’s making a reference to all the nightmares he had after the war, but Draco raises his eyebrows like he’s assuming Harry is talking about the two times that Draco slept in his bed. Harry opens his mouth to correct him but realizes that will only make things worse.
“It would be a bit funny to see you in Slytherin green,” Draco said after a long pause. “You can’t go lime or anything, it has to be emerald or I’m not doing it.”
“I am not wolfy. I feel that in light of my considerable difficulties it’s actually impressive how very not wolfy I am,” Draco says loftily. This isn’t wrong, considering that, particularly in comparison to Harry, Draco is nearly hairless. Even so, there is something about his smile that does sometimes seem a bit too toothy.
Draco remembered being eleven and so terribly scared, felt the ghost of that fear hover at his shoulder and take haughty little breaths. He felt like telling it off as he trampled through the undergrowth and followed the winding, broken paths, but he soon became used to its presence behind him and didn’t mind so much. It was nice to have any company in the forest.
Harry’s form was often sloppy and in the black heat of a fight he had trouble remembering all the new spells he should, but his magic made his body thrum with a brutal strength and he didn’t often lose. Magic was the only thing that always felt right on him, even if it didn’t always feel safe.
“You should get drunk with me,” Draco replies, still staring at him from where he’s slumped against the car door. “We could get fabulously drunk together.”
Draco shook his head, almost smiling almost crying. “You were trying to do what was right,” he said derisively. “And now look at what you’ve done.”
Draco hummed, sounding vaguely disapproving. “No easy questions with you. No, ‘what’s your favorite color, what foods do you like.’ Straight to ‘what’s your boggart?’”
As they made their way out onto the lawn, Ginny bounded up to them, a wide smile on her face. “Neville asked Hannah to the Yule Ball!”
“No,” Draco replies, then scowls. “I don’t drink a lot anymore. Sometimes it’s just nice to not have to think about everything I do.”
It flips and he’s watching Cedric across the dining hall with a languid kind of boredom. He’s just staring, watching him laugh and eat and mess with his hair. He doesn’t know why he thought to watch him like that, doesn’t know where the urge came from even though the memory drips with the echoes of it.
Draco pulls back to mouth along Harry’s neck, brushing his lips against the skin and then biting down, his breath hot. Harry makes an embarrassingly vulnerable noise in the back of his throat, which Draco rewards by sucking a bruise just under Harry’s ear, in a place Harry is sure he’s chosen for how difficult it will be to cover up.
“Draco, it’s me,” Pansy said, frowning. Her bangs were falling into her eyes but she didn’t drop his hands to push them back. “You haven’t had a panic attack in weeks.”
It was much closer to ‘I have feelings, they don’t even know its happening,’ but that was so impossible to explain that Draco just nodded.
Malfoy reaches behind the counter and pulls the radio out. “Belinda said there wasn’t anything wrong with it, it just didn’t have batteries.”
“Scrambled eggs are the best,” Harry replies by way of explanation, watching an old woman talk about her family heirloom. It looks like a set of shitty plates, but Harry doesn’t know anything about antiques.
Draco shakes his head. He has an expression on his face that indicates that Harry is being even stupider than usual, which is an awful lot of heavy lifting for a look to do. “Do you know why I’m here?”
It seemed unfair that Harry should be allowed to haunt him both in real life and in the forest. Even with his bed curtains pulled firmly shut, thoughts of Harry chased themselves around his mind like the tiny animals that crawled around in the forest’s undergrowth.
To tell her that he was sorry he couldn’t stay away from him seemed like too large a confession but he needed to apologize for something, one of the infinite things that were still wrong between them.
He does. Hermione makes them recount the epic rescue and looks appropriately scandalized by how messy it ended up being (“I had no idea they would actually try to
Harry grimaces, finally spitting it out. Maybe Hermione and Pansy will kill them quickly. “We’re together.”
He tried to smell for something other than the normal rawness of the forest, the bright swish of pine trees and slowly rotting leaf litter, but found none of the smells he’d slowly begun to associate with Draco.
“May I repeat, you are not doing a good job of pretending that you don’t want to kiss Harry,” Pansy says.
“A proper one at the time,” Harry agreed. “I got a bedroom eventually. They were right scared of me once I implied that I could hex them half to hell.”
She still smelled like vanilla, that warmth that Harry had begun to associate with her, and her skin shimmered just a little underneath the lights like she’d dusted herself with pixie dust.
“I didn’t know she was so into dancing,” Hermione said, using her free hand to comb her fingers through Harry’s messy hair. “It seems to go beyond her normal melodrama.”
Harry could see groups of her friends beginning to gather on the dance floor and for a moment she almost joined them, but as she pulled out of Draco’s hug and started to walk she found herself pulled toward the doors instead. She smiled as she passed people she knew and drifted outside without a word, something heavy settling inside her as she took the slow walk down the empty corridor.
Draco’s gloved fingers curl around the shape of Harry’s nape just as the blinding light flickers out.
Harry feels, comically, his mouth actually drop open. He closes it again. In the space of time it takes him to do this, he hasn’t thought of anything more cogent to reply with than, "Huh?"
Harry pets her one final time, heading for the kitchen as Nettle trots towards the Pet-Ward wall. She slips through it in a soft blur of magic and out into the garden.
