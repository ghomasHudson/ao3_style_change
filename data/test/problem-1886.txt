, who wouldn’t want Draco with his fierce love for his friends and his gorgeous tattoos and his whole messy life? He tried to say something like that, managed, “You’re not just—of course you come with a whole life, why wouldn’t he want—"
“Oh, Draco,” he purred, “Have I finally hit a nerve?”
“Well,” Harry sighed, “I suppose I can’t be too cut up about it if it means I get to have you. Bloody well timed, actually—” his eyes narrowed, “Wait—Was all this on purpose? Were
Harry nodded mutely. Malfoy’s finger was still touching his nose, and Harry had a sudden, shuddering desire to nuzzle his face down into Malfoy’s hand like a dog, to rub his cheek against Malfoy’s palm. But then the finger withdrew, and Malfoy was taking his arm and leading him inside, and saying words in a calm, measured tone to the host, who was quite possibly giving Harry a highly suspicious look as he led them to a table in the corner and handed them menus. Harry slid gratefully into his seat, blurting out a sudden “Thank you!” just as the host turned away, so that he had to turn back around and then most definitely
“What— No— We’ve been on holiday together, you and I.”
“Honestly mate, why not? It’s the perfect opportunity.”
“Alright, alright, cool it you great honking idiot,” Ron fished a small package out of his pocket, unshrinking it to reveal a fat pastrami sandwich, a dill pickle, a small tin of potato salad and a chocolate chip cookie practically the size of Harry’s face.
Harry looked down at him, breathed, “Yeah? You gonna come?” Draco nodded frantically, whining, high-pitched and desperate. Harry flexed around him, and when he arched off the bed under Harry’s hands, Harry released him, bringing a hand down and barely touching himself before he was spilling over his fingers, onto Draco’s pale stomach.
They went up to the shower together, and washed each other, hot and close in the steam. Harry let himself lean back into Draco's chest, closed his eyes as the water ran over their bodies. He let Draco wash his hair, the pads of his fingers massaging Harry's scalp, drawing a low groan from his mouth. He let Draco's hands make him clean. Then, Harry turned around and said,
Malfoy lit up with anticipation. “Alright, I’ve just got to change—are you dressed muggle under your robes? You can leave them up in my flat.”
Harry didn’t consider himself a particularly adept gift giver. On Draco’s birthday, he usually paid for everyone’s dinner and bought Draco drinks all night; if there was a good show coming up, he would get tickets for the two of them. Solid gifts, but not exactly anything to write home about. Gift giving was an art form, he knew, and not one that he excelled at. Draco, on the other hand, adored gifts and always managed to find something thoughtful and precise. Last year, Harry had been talking about upping the size on his gauges, and Draco had bought him the most stunning pair for his birthday, onyx with malachite fractals. They were simple, but the quality was exquisite, something he never would have splurged on himself. Draco had rolled his eyes when Harry said that and replied,
“You’re never going to give me up?” Draco asked, grinning like a madman, sliding the ring onto Harry’s shaking finger.
Potter looked back at him, self-satisfied and apologetic, so Draco fucked him over the conference table while the muggle song played on a loop in the background, and he hummed it to himself all the way back to Level Nine.
Harry let out a real laugh this time, full and warm, and lifted up on his toes to fit their open, smiling mouths together. And it was easy, too, to tangle his fingers in Draco’s hair, to push him up against the table and roll their hips together. Easy to map Draco's body, searching out how to make him feel good. Easy to let the heat creep up his spine. Harry made a sound—a soft one, vulnerable, exactly what he had been afraid of—stripping himself raw, laying himself bare. But he wasn’t afraid anymore. Now he was open, frantic. He pressed their foreheads together, panting.
carved in curling gold script.
“I really love you, you know,” he said quietly, in Draco’s ear.
“Right, yes, of course—”
Harry strode furiously down the Gringotts hallway, soles of his shoes clacking loudly on the shiny black tiles. They had actually assigned him to
It was already the best Christmas Draco had had in years, and when said it out loud, Harry looked at him all soft and sleepy-eyed, and said, “let’s go to bed.”
Below it, a subtitle:
“Yeah, I knew you probably had Firewhisky for dinner at least three nights this week,” Harry’s eyes crinkled around the corners as Draco grimaced in acknowledgement, “Figured I’d make myself useful over here so you could get some nutrients in you before passing out.”
just AK me on the spot, please.” She shuddered. “I’d have gone soft, it’ll be a mercy killing.”
… By Sunday, the grass was churned up and they were sun-pinkened and dusty from head to toe. Harry’s hair had reached unprecedented levels of dishevelment, while Draco’s was plastered to his face. The first year, Draco had insisted on retreating back to the tent to cast cleaning charms on himself but by now he leaned into it,
“Oh my god— Are you serious? But you were so—” Harry swished his chopsticks around in a vaguely accusatory manner.
Potter huffed out a quiet laugh. “Something like that, yeah.”
dated someone longer than six months?”
.” And Harry said, “Right,” and took a swig of beer, and then when Malfoy walked in a couple of minutes later Harry loudly called him over to their table and told Ernie, who was in charge of teams, that they would both be playing on Hermione’s team that night. Most everyone in earshot raised their eyebrows at that, including Malfoy himself, but Harry just shrugged and scooted over to make room next to him in the booth. Malfoy was fantastic, and they won, and at the end, Hermione (after a whispered conversation with the rest of the team while Malfoy had been at the bar) graciously asked Malfoy whether he’d like to join their team, and he accepted in a rather stilted, formal manner, but Harry could tell he was pleased. Harry didn’t mind at all that Hermione hadn’t asked
Harry grinned, drawling,
“It’s got to be
Harry’s skin tingled where Malfoy’s spells touched him. He wasn’t sure whether he even liked Malfoy, exactly. He was still sharp and prickly, standoffish, most of the time. He was nitpicky, always griping about Harry’s impatience and lack of finesse, shouldering him out of the way at a site to demonstrate how to disentangle the threads of a curse
Draco narrowed his eyes, “I’ll buy your drinks for a month if you do it.”

“It’s not—” Harry tried pathetically, “It wasn’t a
“Had Hermione send me a Patronus when you left,” he shrugged. “I had to time the music right, you know,” he flashed a cheeky smile.
“So you’ve seen it?”
Harry huffed, covering his face with his hands and groaning, “Yes, I’m going to a muggle music show with Draco Malfoy.” He peeked out through his fingers, “Am I insane? Is this a terrible idea? I don’t know what I was thinking, he just asked, and I said yes—”
, fuck, yes.”
Harry kept staring. He swallowed. Draco raised an eyebrow.
Harry took a sip of ale. He was smashed into a booth at The Hawthorn and Holly—yes, sickeningly, a gay bar named after his and Draco’s wands. Their friends loved dragging them there, and he had to admit the ambience was rather nice, and they did always get free drinks so it wasn’t all bad once he got over the crushing mortification of the name. The whole gang was out, probably the last time they would manage it before Ron and Hermione’s wedding in only three weeks. Harry was currently pressed into a corner between Ron and Seamus, absentmindedly eating crisps from a basket while they carried on a heated debate about the relative merits of corned beef versus pastrami.
“Well, as I said,” Draco inhaled sharply, “I’m not losing you.”
“Must I?” Draco whined, “I’m quite tired.”
taller now) and snapping his long fingers once in front of Harry’s face.
“Do it then,” Draco murmured, “Right here.”
Draco hummed his assent and gathered Harry into his side, slapping some money on the counter and steering them both out.
Luna had done a complicated weather ritual in their back garden the week before, a series of incantations she had found in the journal of a seventh century Viking priestess, meant to summon an epic storm. So naturally it was, for once, clear all weekend.

He nodded. “You’re right.”
. He strolled out, rounding a corner, and then—he was there, two ticket windows built in a dark-painted wooden façade, with flat columns between them and a door set back on the left side. Running atop the columns was a sign with the word
“Oh,” Harry relaxed, smiling shyly, “I thought… but wait,” he frowned, “so we have to sneak around and we can’t tell anyone? Ever?”
Draco tried to catch his breath, but it was a bit difficult with Potter dead-weighted on top of him. He hadn’t made to move off Draco at all—he hadn’t even pulled out. Draco didn’t really mind it, the suffocating weight of Potter draped over him, Potter still inside him, but he did have that irritating need to breathe. Elbowing at Potter’s limp form, he managed to gasp out a protest, and Potter obligingly and apologetically rolled off of him. Draco flopped onto his back and sucked in a lungful of air, throwing an arm over his face. After a beat, he waved a hand, sending a gentle cleaning charm over them both. At that, Potter started, and Draco felt a hand hesitantly brush across his chest.
Malfoy’s breath hitched, eyes wide. “What? Are you quite sure you’re alright?”
They made their way north, stopping before San Francisco to spend a couple of days exploring the Big Sur coastline. Harry had put Draco in charge of hotel booking, so he followed Draco’s directions to a place called the Post Ranch Inn. It was quite posh—apparently Draco had dreamt about staying there when he spent weekends in Big Sur as a broke student, camping or crashing at the cheapest hotels. Each accommodation was freestanding, built into the cliffside overlooking the ocean, fencing and natural architecture rendering each one completely private. A winding, wooded path took Harry and Draco to their suite, a tiny chalet with a garden in the back and a deck suspended over the cliff, framed with sheet glass railing, lounge chairs beckoning next to a stainless-steel hot tub. Inside was all rich wood paneling, heated floors, a wood-burning fireplace, a single king bed in the center with crisp white bedding. Harry padded through slowly, openmouthed. He had never stayed anywhere so luxurious. Draco was grinning like the cat that got the cream, exhausted exhilaration shining through his eyes as he tossed his bag onto the chaise and flopped onto the mattress, stretching languid and satisfied.
“And I certainly don’t want to put pressure on us to take any serious steps anytime soon. I’m happy just being with you.”
And this surprised him too: that love was a choice, not an irrevocable force. That he could, if he chose, keep things the way they were, love Draco just as he always had, and he would be satisfied. But he could also choose something else—he and Draco could choose some other kind of love, together. Harry just had to decide whether to ask Draco to make that choice with him.
Harry laughed nervously, eyes darting to the floor and back up, “Well you’re always all—” he gestured at Draco’s sharp suit, “tightly buttoned, and like, when I don’t fill out my equipment reimbursement forms on time, or when I’m rude to the press, or something— you get all—” he flushed, “frustrated and stern about it.” He sucked in a deep breath, “It’s um, it’s really hot?”
“So you’ve just come here to make me dinner and then, what, you’re going to leave?”
They twined close, swaying and grinding together with open mouths and lewd grins.
“Gimme gimme—” Draco reached out, wiggling his fingers, but Harry laughed lazily, leaning out of his reach.
He clenched around Harry, grinding down savagely.
“You were really nervous, when I got here,” Draco marveled, still feeling Harry on his tongue, wondering whether he’d actually thought Draco might say no.
Could it be?
“Sorry,” Potter said, a bit breathlessly, “I never quite stick the landing.”
When the first piano notes of
“Hm?” Harry had eaten so much, he was having trouble thinking. Perhaps all the blood had left his brain and gone to his intestines in a futile attempt to aid his digestion. Was that possible? It felt possible right now.
“Honestly Ron I’ve been here for seven hours now, I’m fucking starving, did you bring me a goddamn sandwich or what?”
Draco’s eyes lit up. “You don’t want to wait for Saturday?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter ran a hand through his hair, half of which was already standing on end, “I knew you were working late tonight—Hermione mentioned—and I thought you might appreciate a break?” He grimaced. Apparently it was finally starting to dawn on him that Draco was not amused.
like that as he pushed inside him, and he saw clearly the source of his fear. He didn’t just want to bend Malfoy over his desk and fuck him again, right then and there (although he certainly did want that). He wanted to call him Draco. He wanted to snog him in the Ministry lifts. He wanted to take him home after pub quiz and suck him off on the sofa. He wanted—
wish you would take my advice on this and just fucking commit to each other already!"
Harry chuckled, wondering aloud— “Are you going to have one? You’re closing up now anyways—are you going to keep me under observation?”
“José broke up with me.”
“Thank you,” he said, “For taking me here.”
Five minutes later, Harry was wrapping his shaking fingers around a mug of hot tea, leaning up against the counter while Draco sat calmly at the kitchen table.
And of course, they were in Harry’s earlobes every day now. So yeah, Harry wanted to get Draco something special this year.
“Ugh, that’s disgusting,” Draco bumped their shoulders together. Harry looked up, blinking the shine out of his eyes. “Ah,” Draco shifted and threw an arm around his shoulders, “I see we’ve reached the maudlin stage of intoxication?”
But he was used to it, is all. He and Draco took each other as dates to most formal functions: ministry events and charity balls, art openings, and in recent years, an ever-increasing number of weddings. It was, for all intents and purposes, just two friends showing up together. But they made it more fun than that. They always found subtle ways to coordinate their outfits, and went out for posh dinners beforehand, and took photos together in front of the flower arrangements. It was another thing that their friends made fun of them for, but really, why should only romantic couples get to do that sort of thing? Harry didn’t see what the difference was; he didn't get why you had to be sleeping with someone to get your place settings next to each other.
Potter grinned, a little insolent, a little bashful, “Is it working?”
with Draco, casual as anything, as if the thought didn’t open a deep well of fear inside of him. Harry’s stomach clenched. Whenever he had considered the possibility of anything more than a bit of friendly snogging with Draco—and of course he had considered it, he’s not blind—the thought was immediately cut off by a rush of gut-twisting mortification. Everything between them was already deep, and heavy, and vibrating with meaning. Sex only had the potential to introduce catastrophic awkwardness into their relationship. How could he know how to be, how to put his hands on Draco’s naked skin? What if he wasn’t good? How could he make himself vulnerable that way, when Draco was so important? The thought wouldn’t even stick in his brain. It made him want to squirm out of his skin. So no, he couldn’t think about Draco like that. But he could hardly explain all of that to Ron either.
think it’s nice,” Draco said, squeezing José’s hand with a smile, “That he’s still spending his day off with me, even if it means having to put up with you lot.”
Draco did his best to look very put-upon, “I suppose I’ve endured worse than your plebian sense of humor… If you truly cannot control yourself, I imagine I’ll manage.” He couldn’t keep the fond note out of his voice. He didn’t even try.
Draco, with his little shop a port in the storm, his perfect flat a cradling palm, his very presence a balm on the raw, scraping edges of Harry’s days. Whatever Harry paid, it wasn’t enough. Overcome, Harry wanted to prostrate himself in supplication, touch his forehead to the floor at Draco’s feet. He sank to his knees, reverent hands, upturned face, parted lips. Draco brought his hands to Harry’s hair, fingers carding through the tangles, slow and gentle, exquisite, excruciating. No one had ever brushed his hair like that before. Harry drew a shuddering breath and took Draco into his mouth. Draco made a quiet sound, low and shaky, and his knees buckled.
Harry came slowly into consciousness, his first clear thought a resounding rejection of the concept of being awake. His head pounded, his tongue was glued to the roof of his mouth, his stomach roiled, and Merlin, he couldn’t breathe—he blinked his sticky eyes open to a faceful of fluffy white fur.
“D’you see them staying together, though?” Neville pressed, and Harry had to take a very deep breath and sip on some water before he responded.
, so he had simply resolved to be very friendly and amiable when he saw Malfoy next, and then they could get back on alright terms. The trouble was that he hadn’t seen Malfoy since.
“I’m not—for Merlin’s sake, I think it’s great, I hope he has a great time, ok? I hope they fall madly in love and get married and have a bunch of tall, beautiful babies, alright?” He stabbed at his salad.
“Did you say that though, Ron?” Harry piped up, “Did you specifically mention in private? Because if that wasn’t in the terms of the wish Draco and I can strip down right now—”
, throwing myself at you for
Harry thought about Malfoy a lot. The sound he had made when Harry pushed into him, and how Harry had looked down and
“Yeah,” Harry reached out, running a finger down Neville’s cheek. “Have you ever touched Neville’s face?” He swiped a thumb across Neville’s brow, turned back to José, who was looking at him as though he’d proposed a quick dip in the Channel.

“Sláinte,” Seamus raised the bottle and took another drink.
He needed advice.
“And how would you feel about that?”
The other eyebrow came up. “Not everyone my age is a sorry bigot, you know. I’m not going to faint away at the idea of two blokes together,” she took a sip of wine, watching them, “You should have seen what we got into, back in my day at Hogwarts—"
metaphorically—I’d die of internal injuries—"
Draco lay still beneath him, panting and sticky. Harry allowed himself to look for one more moment before finally giving into the now hours-old urge to collapse into the plush cocoon of the duvet. He felt the warm wash of Draco’s magic sending cleaning charms over them both, and then the warmer press of Draco’s hand over his ribs. He rolled over to nuzzle into Draco’s chest. He felt wrung out, like the past couple of hours with Draco had squeezed every ounce of tension from his body, leaving him loose, and weak, and—finally—at rest.
After—when they rolled away from the wet spot and lay close under the blankets, half-dozing, Draco running a warm palm over Harry’s back, Harry touching his fingertips to the tip of Draco’s nose, the round knob of his shoulder—he thought about saying it then. Saying
“Besides,” Draco flicked his fingers in a quick gesture of dismissal, “I like my men tall, dark, and handsome,” he winked at José, “And Harry here, unfortunately for him, is short, dark, and handsome, and I simply won’t settle for two out of three.”
Harry kissed him.
Harry scoffed at him. It was just a walk, and only about four miles at that. And for a while, as they traipsed inland through the canyon, winding around a burbling stream, between massive old redwoods, he thought he’d been right. But then they started climbing up, and up, and
, rolled up. And that was odd, since the December edition wasn’t supposed to come out until Christmas Day. As he unrolled it, a free scrap of parchment drifted down to the floor. He picked it up. Scrawled on it, in Harry’s truly horrendous handwriting, was a note:
again, so he dipped back in to kiss Draco on his mouth, plush and tasting of lemons, and under his ear, velvety like the skin of a peach, and down his neck, hot and damp with sweat.
“Well, if they do keep hitting it off, you might need to find another date for the wedding, eh?”
Draco’s gaze hardened. “I’ve been having more nightmares recently, you know…” Harry knew. He didn’t let go of Draco’s hand. They both always backslid a little in the last weeks of April. “He said that I self-medicate with drugs and alcohol and use shows as a way to vent my emotions, and that it wasn’t sustainable. I was like—maybe I just like getting a bit sozzled every now and again and shoving people around in a mosh pit because it’s fucking fun? What the fuck? And then!
They finally did it!!!
” Pansy shrieked, horrified. “He asked you to be
She squeezed his hand. “Potter’s an idiot, we’ve always known it,” she sniffed, “If he had half a grain of sense he would be groveling at your feet right now, offering to suck you off every day for the rest of your lives to make up for how he treated you.”

“Credit to Greg, too,” Ron shifted onto one hand, taking the joint from his mouth and passing it to Harry, coughing a little. “This thing’s a monster.”
and can’t Draco please cancel it? No more Potter in the lunchroom, inhaling food and ribbing his teammates, winking at Draco across the room. No more Potter popping into Draco’s office, perching his pert little professional athlete arse on the corner of Draco’s desk, sitting back on his hands and kicking his feet, batting his eyelashes and asking
Draco went stiff behind him, then huffed a laugh in his ear.
Pansy looked at him sadly. “Draco, don’t go down this road again. Please.”
They hike they take on the Big Sur coastline is called Soberanes (and if you've ever done it, hopefully you can attest that I'm not exaggerating how steep it is 😅)
Draco dragged Harry out onto the dance floor then, bracing a hand on the small of his back, waltzing him around merrily, so Harry was tripping and giggling and stepping on Draco’s toes. The music changed and they found their friends, jumping and swaying and slinging their arms round each other, getting happily sloshed and basking in the joy radiating from all the assembled guests, everyone brimming over with warmth.
“What?”
Draco snorted, “Everyone stomps on the Cannons.”
“Well, we talked about quidditch for 15 minutes and then he left. I’m not sure I’d call that friends, exactly. Friend-
“Let’s go there.”
'The Middle' by Jimmy Eat World is the song mentioned during the concert scene
Malfoy’s frown deepened—he looked a bit sad actually, and Harry had to interject, “But I meant to say yes—yes, anyways, I’ll be your lab anything,” and he immediately felt rather silly, but Malfoy’s cheeks pinked slightly, and he looked pleased.
Of course, Potter was completely, almost maddeningly comfortable in his body, inhabiting himself with such abandon and enthusiasm that Draco really wasn’t sure whether much instruction would be necessary, on his part. But eventually, he lifted his mouth from Potter’s neck to ask, softly, “What do you want to do?”
Harry moved hesitantly, coming to stand in between Draco’s legs, shifting restlessly. Gods, Draco wanted to make him kneel, but he didn’t think he had the patience just then. He beckoned, and Harry climbed cautiously into his lap, straddling him, gingerly resting his hips against Draco’s, letting out a soft whimper. He ran his hands across Draco’s chest, down the line of buttons on his crisp white shirt, rocking his hips just a little bit—
Harry thought about Malfoy frowning sympathetically as Harry shared his anxieties, listing off which establishments he ought to try first.
“Right,” he said, deflating further. ”Well then, this is a bit more awkward than I thought it’d be…”
. He was holding back, and Harry couldn’t figure out why. It wasn’t as if they hadn’t already been deeply, almost shockingly, intimate—no use pretending they didn’t know each other that well. It was driving him batty. But Harry was nothing if not persistent. He even kept showing up to the pub quiz, once Malfoy resumed his regular attendance. And then, Harry realized that Malfoy didn’t have a team. The other regulars had formed standing teams that competed fiercely month-to-month. Pub quiz was the subject of more than one betting pool, and the rankings every month determined who was buying drinks for whom all night. The core team members were impressively dedicated. The drop-ins got divvied up randomly every month to keep the numbers roughly even. But Malfoy, who was indisputably a regular, got shuffled around just like Harry. It was even more puzzling because Malfoy clearly excelled. He knew all the wizarding history (had he actually stayed awake in Professor Binns’ class?), he ran circles around most of the others when it came to the arts and culture categories (especially the pretentious sorts), and Harry had even watched once, astonished, as he demolished the entire group in a round on muggle pop music. Malfoy was knowledgeable, and quick, and just as competitive as he had been when they’d played quidditch at Hogwarts. In other words, the teams should have been fighting tooth and nail over him. But every month he simply got slotted in wherever there was space. And Harry had been watching him, and his demeanor always went very cool and detached when he got assigned, like he didn’t care at all which team he got on, which meant that he cared very much.
And that's a wrap!
“No,” Harry pressed their foreheads together, laughed into his mouth, “Never.”
hopelessly attracted to him. He sighed. Well, at least they were just friend-
“Shall we?” He stood, offering a hand to Draco.
“Oi, would you two disentangle your limbs and stop sucking face for five fucking seconds? You’re hosting a party!” Ron bellowed across the dome.
Harry stepped across the threshold and thrust his hands awkwardly into his pockets. “Er, I was just in the area,” Malfoy raised an eyebrow, “and I noticed your office here, thought I’d, um, drop in and see how it’s going?”
“Yes, Potter, you’ve absolutely shagged my brains out—frankly, I’d thought that was obvious—so for the love of Merlin stop looking at me like that and go to sleep.”
“Want me to shove my head up your arse, Potter? Want to try right now? I know where you keep your lube, I’ll just pop inside—”
Malfoy snorted. “Allow me to explain then, Potter
, this was something he hadn’t known he needed. He tucked his fists in and flung his elbows out, relishing the dull thud of flesh colliding with flesh. Hands shoved him in the back, propelled him forward, a shoulder knocked him sideways, an elbow cracked against his ribs. And his fists were flying too, his hands pushing, his elbows sharp. God, he hadn’t realized this was something he could do. Occasionally, over the past few weeks, he would shut himself in his room and turn the volume all the way up on his speakers. He had closed his eyes and moved like this, thrashed against the empty air. He had felt it a little then, this explosive tightness in his chest, his muscles coiled and snapping. But to hurl himself against another body, to feel the slap of skin against skin, to lose himself in the suffocating chaos of the melee—
Draco raised an eyebrow, “So what you’re saying is that you owe me twenty-five galleons?”
But Harry grinned crookedly, “No, not at all, just it’s one thing being alright with muggles and another thing, shagging them in the loo.” Draco sniffed, pleased. “Besides, why even go to muggle pubs? Surely there are wizarding places? You’re, you know,” he gestured up and down at Draco, “fit and,” he hastily gulped some of his drink, “and you’re actually not half bad to talk to.”
“I’ve been waiting for you to get here,” he whispered, and felt Draco’s breath hitch.
“Oh,” her eyebrows raised, “You didn’t tell him about our wish?”
Harry laughed, throwing his head back, and then fixed his gaze on Draco’s, his eyes gone serious and earnest. “Draco,” he said low, “I want you to fuck me. I want you inside me. I—please.”
Draco awoke slowly, with his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth and his head pounding. Merlin, he felt like utter shite. It took a few labored breaths to register the presence of another body spooned up against his chest. A body that was firm, and warm, and attached to a head of messy black hair—it all came rushing back to him. He’d called Potter over at the bar last night, and they’d talked, and it had been easy and fun, and they’d come back to Draco’s and shagged and
Harry grinned. An enemy of Rita Skeeter’s was a friend of his. “Yeah, we’re queer,” he said, “just not with each other.”
—he knew this feeling—
He pronounced it “Jho-se,” the first syllable vibrating luxuriously in his mouth.
“And you’re so predictable,” Draco shrugged, grinning. “Here, allow me to hasten your journey out of the maudlin phase and into the
José laughed, “I’ll probably have to pop into Mungo’s during the afternoon to check on patients anyways, but brunch sounds lovely, thank you.”
“Oi, how was your date?”
“My first—” Harry felt himself flushing and clenched his fists, digging his nails in. “the time I wouldn’t tell you about.” He dragged his gaze up from the table in time to see horrified comprehension dawning across Ron’s face.
Malfoy looked nothing like Harry had expected. He was lounging back in his desk chair, feet propped on the desk, scowling down at an old, dusty scroll in his lap, chewing on a thumbnail—and Harry had never seen Malfoy doing
“We know each other far too well—”
“That’s enough,” Draco cut in smoothly. “You’re not going to sick up. Brush your teeth and meet me in the kitchen.”
Harry blinked up at him, sprawled on his back, his smirk a little nervous around the edges.
Draco’s birthday was on a Tuesday that year (the Tuesday after Ron and Hermione’s wedding, no less), so they had planned a celebratory outing for the following Saturday. Draco’s birthday was always a big deal—wild parties, lavish dinners, clubbing—whatever he chose, they pulled out all the stops. This year, he was taking everyone out to a posh new restaurant in Chelsea, and then they were hitting the bars. Everyone was determined to get him laid in the wake of his breakup with José—Harry had told Draco that ensuring his sexual satisfaction would be Harry’s special gift to him this year. But that was a lie.
Draco didn’t turn to face him. “I don’t want to hear it,” he bit out.
“Shall we go then?” He stuttered, and Malfoy acquiesced, following him out the door and locking up, very politely not mentioning if he had noticed Harry goggling at him like a goldfish, open mouth working, forgetting his entire life before the last seven seconds since Malfoy walked out of the loo. He tried not to stare at Malfoy’s back (
“What’s the matter, you don’t want me?” He frowned playfully, “I don’t think that’s it… I think you’re just wound too tight—"
They snorted simultaneously, rolling their eyes at each other. “Yeah mate, only everyone.” Harry grinned, “Don’t worry though, we are truly like an old married couple in
Harry had been so fiercely happy for them in that moment he thought it might be enough, just to stand by their sides.
“I make the food and Draco makes a big smoothie.”
Harry grinned mischievously as he turned the handle, stepping back into the hallway. “Haven’t you noticed, Draco? I’m
“At least you can try,” she said. “Let him know how you really feel, what you were thinking. Maybe he’ll understand.”
Draco spat out a mouthful of beer. “Potter… did you just— are you planning to rickroll the audience?”
Potter smiled sadly into his glass. “Yeah, I think I am too.”
So, Harry followed Malfoy through the door at the back of the shop and up a narrow, rickety staircase to Malfoy’s flat, which he had never seen before.
! You did
Before Draco could reply that he'd been under duress when they'd reached that agreement, the first notes of
“I really am sorry. I probably wasn’t as, er, polite as I could have been, when I left.” Malfoy nodded tersely. “And anyways, I thought afterwards, that, you know, I had a surprisingly good time with you, at the bar.” He stuffed his hands in his pockets and shrugged, flushing again. “I thought— well, I thought maybe we could be friends?” Malfoy’s eyebrows shot up. “Or at least, like, friendly.” Harry added hurriedly. “Friendlier than we’ve been, in the past.” Malfoy closed his eyes, took a deep breath in, and let out a long-suffering sort of sigh. The silence stretched.
“Alright,” Malfoy said.
“What about you, how was your night?”
Draco fished the box out of his pockets, and opened it.
Draco blinked and raised his palms, trying to get a grip on what was even going on, “Sorry, did I do something—”
“That’s nice,” Potter sighed, “But what if
“Well why’d you come over anyways, if you don’t smoke?”
at Harry and frankly, curry chips sounded like a vast improvement over this whole situation, so Harry just screamed
“Yeah,” Harry breathed, “Yeah, I am.”
Draco just stared at him.
“Well, they actually didn’t mind me being gay at all. They just insisted I ‘do my duty to the family’ regardless. Honestly, growing up I thought I would—marry a woman and have
Luckily, though, when they went out for Draco’s birthday, Harry was never alone. Only the Slytherins ever fit in at places like this, and Harry could always rely on Seamus and Ginny in particular to poke fun at the stuffy waiter or the pretentious décor. At least the menu was in English at this one, and Harry picked up the first round of drinks for everyone.
“You should see yourself right now,” he murmured, pressing back in a little more insistently, “You’re so gorgeous, you’re driving me mad—”
“What about sex?” Harry shouted back. “It’s your birthday!”
. Circe was a twitchy thing, skinny and spastic, skidding through the rooms and rubbing frantically against Harry’s ankles.
So finally, Harry asked Hermione about it, and she raised her eyebrows and said, “Well, it’s Malfoy.” And when Harry pointed out that he was one of the best players there and everyone seemed to enjoy his company, she frowned and said, “Well yes, he is an asset, and I suppose we all think he’s alright now, but you know, it’s
Harry had said, a choked, wet sound. And then,
—” he stood abruptly, knocking the chair out behind him and slamming his hands on the table, “—is going on here?!”
“Aren’t I always?”
“I take it back; I actually don’t know how I put up with you, you utter arsehole—”
“Oh fuck off, Blaise.”
“Don’t think you can distract me with flattery,” he pointed his fork into Harry’s face, “How are you feeling? Are you ok?”
Ron and Hermine were getting married at the end of May. They were keeping it about as low key as possible for a wedding with close to two hundred guests (it turned out they had rather a lot of loved ones, and there was simply no way around the size of the extended Weasley clan). Early in their engagement, Hermione had unleashed a few impassioned rants against the wedding-industrial complex, and Ron had pretty much taken over the planning from there, with Hermione wielding final approval or veto power.
At that, Draco’s dance partner nimbly extricated himself from between the two of them, nodded politely at Draco, and stepped into Blaise’s welcoming embrace. Harry shrugged and wove through the sticky crowd to close their tab. When he got back and grabbed Draco’s hand, shouting,
over and over again, that should be easy enough.”
“Oui, c’est magnifique,” he proclaimed, plucking the joint from Harry’s fingers and taking another hit before levitating it over to Ginny.
Hermione laughed, “Alright Harry, relax. You don’t want to back out, do you?”
Harry yanked his hands away. “Traitor!”
“With this lot as the competition?” Draco arched an eyebrow, “Yeah, I reckon we can.”
“I mean, what if, what if it’s us?”
“You’re ready for more?” Draco asked, soft and dangerous, withdrawing and pressing two fingers up against his entrance, just the slightest pressure, and when Harry groaned
“That’s alright,” Harry fidgeted, eyes darting to the side. “We don’t have to, if you’re too tired—”
Draco wrinkled his nose, “Absolutely no class in this joint, honestly—Blaise, at least spare a bit of our dignity, would you?”
“Yeah,” Harry said, “I’ll hang out here a bit before I go home so you can see what you’ve done to me,” he grinned, “but you’ve got to take one too or I’ll make a complete fool of myself.”
Draco laughed, wiping his filthy hand on Harry’s shirt and bringing it up to cup Harry’s face, “Indeed.”
, don’t be daft,” Draco yawned, rolling over and stretching, long and languorous, “We’re young, virile men in our sexual prime—”

“It’s the grandest romantic gesture I’ve ever received,” he said, “Now, if you want to go above and beyond, I think I can stay awake just long enough for you to suck me off…”
“I, er, don’t think it’s much fun, actually, for the lab rats. Or rabbits, as it were….”
“Honestly I don’t even remember what I was saying.”
And Harry said, “I’m hungry.”
“Come on, Harry, you know we can’t tell them—”
, and I’d only
Harry clenched his teeth against yet another reminder of why he had ended up here, sad and alone at the bar, left ogling his best friend because everyone else in the world just wanted a piece of
A raucous cheer went up and Harry turned red, hiding his face in his drink.
“Hey! I sabotaged it too!”
Draco felt a thrill up his spine and leaned in, breathing, “Do you want to fuck me?”
“I’ll find my own good-looking healer, then,” he grumbled. Hermione and Ron let out twin shouts of laughter, as if he had said something utterly ridiculous. What did they know, anyways? Draco wouldn’t
Oh Potter, I’m flattered, but of course I can’t say I’m surprised,” he drawled, leaning in closer, reckless, “I knew you were always staring at me in school, you know. You weren’t that subtle.”
, and only Draco had known it was coming, so while the elderly witches in the back were dabbing their eyes with their handkerchiefs at Potter’s fervent declaration of commitment to extracurriculars for underprivileged children, Weasley had snorted half a flute of champagne out of his nose and Pansy had shrieked so loudly that she actually flung herself under the table in embarrassment.
Harry’s knees went fully weak for a moment, but when Draco set him down he found he could stand even straighter than before, and even more of the shake was gone from his fingers.
“It’s from the Auror Department,” he said blankly.
we have to take the bike up the coast, God. Oh, you’re going to love it...”
The morning of Christmas Eve, Draco awoke to an insistent scratching on his window. He’d declined to go to France again this year, preferring to wallow in equal parts self-pity and self-loathing. He’d resolved instead to spend the holiday in bed, getting drunk, just as he had the previous year, only this time he got a couple of days head start. There was something poetically just about it. The seasons might pass but he was still Draco Malfoy, and he always would be, and it wouldn’t do to forget it. No one else would, after all.
Draco raised an eyebrow.
Ginny looked up, cutting in, “You could join us, we’re doing
It was late when Harry pushed open the door to Malfoy’s Mellow Medicinals. He paused for a moment in the doorway, closing his eyes and inhaling the fragrance of patchouli incense and vanilla candles, the sticky, pungent aroma of the weed. His body reacted instinctively to the particular smell of Malfoy’s shop—Pavlovian, the muscles in his neck released, his chest loosened as he inhaled deeply, his mouth tingling and filling with saliva. Every day he thanked Merlin that the Ministry had liberalized their drug laws a couple years back. He had always hated to see the Auror Department waste resources on distribution and possession cases. Frankly, he couldn’t be arsed to care whether any citizens were indulging in mind-altering substances in their free time. They lived in a world of literal magic, for fuck’s sake, what was the big deal about a little psychedelic experience? Anyways, Harry also appreciated the changes in the drug laws because it meant that he himself could partake without risk of investigation by his own Department. He was already Deputy Head Auror—a feat everyone said he had achieved at a shockingly young age—and it wouldn’t do to break the laws he had sworn to uphold. And it turned out that the job of Deputy Head Auror was tremendously stressful, and demanded punishing hours, and followed him home if he wasn’t careful, so he was extremely grateful that he could come into Malfoy’s shop and purchase a little bit of hard-won relaxation.
Harry had been terrified, that the weight of what they’d done would infect everything, make every moment thick and loaded. But he had been wrong, yet again. There was still lightness between them—still ease. The shift Harry felt, the frisson of heat low in his belly, the thrumming possibility, it was different (and it was
“Indeed, Harry, that is—” he hiccupped, “Precisely what I’m laughing at.”
Ron nodded, shoveling a large forkful of cauliflower into his mouth and chewing with smug relish.
Shrugging out of his robes, he moved slowly toward the kitchen, where he found Harry puttering about over the hob, plating some spaghetti in a hearty meat sauce and pouring out a bottle of red. He looked up and caught Draco’s eye, singing,
Harry helped himself to a few bites, mostly content to watch Draco gorge himself. Eventually, he started to slow, dabbing at the corners of his mouth with a spare napkin and fixing Harry with self-satisfied look, “Now that I’ve got my strength back and I can gloat properly—I’ve got a date with José next Friday.”
He broke off. Potter hadn’t started that. He was still on the wall where Draco had left him, wild-eyed, chest heaving. Draco had slammed him into the wall. He had grabbed his face and stuck his
, exactly, or at least not on his own behalf—shouldn’t José want to see Draco’s home? It was a pretty nice home, after all. Harry had worked hard on the restorations and Grimmauld Place was comfortable and well-lit and harbored far fewer cursed objects these days.
us?” Draco was looking more confused by the second. “Did you take a bludger to the head?”
“I mean, pretty fucking sorry for myself, obviously, but I’d take it. I’m sure I’d get over it eventually and I’m going to stay friends with him no matter what.” Harry heard his voice get fierce, and he knew it was true.
“Ready for more?” Harry murmured, and Draco nodded sleepily and allowed Harry to turn him over onto his stomach. He placed a kiss to the nape of Draco’s neck, then began working his way down his spine, trailing his lips over Draco’s skin, breath ghosting over his ribs. He drew his thumbs down and spread Draco open, pressing his mouth to Draco’s hole, flicking his tongue out. Draco’s fingers twitched feebly. Harry didn’t stop when Draco was hard again. He kept going until Draco was leaking, feverishly rutting into the sheets and pressing back into Harry’s face, and then he slipped a finger in, brushing against Draco’s prostate, and sucked, and Draco threw his head back, keening, asking for more.
, that they should actually ratchet
“Alright, alright…” Harry shook his head, resigned, “But I’m serious Ron, nothing’s going to happen.”
“No, it’s…” Harry trailed off, biting his lip. This gift was big, and felt a bit intimate, and he wanted to give it on Draco’s birthday, just the two of them. He didn’t want to say all that, though. Instead, he fished around in his pocket, pulling out and unshrinking a large silver envelope. “Just open it.”
“Is this really a holiday?” José asked, frowning. They were sitting around the wrought-iron table on the back deck at Grimmauld with Greg and Neville, who had come over after work with some new strains in honor of the day.
Draco huffed softly, “Of course I’ve thought about it. Been thinking about it more, recently. Maybe that infernal wish put it on my mind... Anyways, I tried not to, of course. That way lies madness, et cetera,” he gestured vaguely, eyes wild. “You’re already my best friend. It’d be a bit silly of me to want anything more. Greedy, really.”
liked it. The music sounded how Harry felt all the time—it sounded like giving the middle finger to the Auror Corps and the Ministry, it sounded like wanting everyone to leave him the fuck alone, it sounded like his confusion and loneliness after Ginny didn’t want him back, it sounded like his desperate anger at everyone who had died and left him behind, it sounded like the hole in his identity where
, I wanted you to— to put me on my knees, or— bend me over the desk—" He shuddered and curled back in, and Draco took advantage of the moment to stroke over his prostate, making him keen.
Draco snorted, waving a lazy hand, “Me, Harry, what’s the difference?” He took a swallow of tea, “Would you like to come for brunch? I’m sure you’ll be welcome to watch the game after, although…” he trailed off, “it might be a bit… loud.”
Draco snorted, wondering whether he should clarify, but then Harry continued, his grin widening, “Anyways, I’ve got to tell the rest of the team, they’ll be chuffed I finally seduced you,” he winked, and Draco rolled his eyes.
Ron pulled up a chair. “So, are you just going to stay here indefinitely or are you going to go home at any point? Change out of your clothes that’ve got Draco’s guts all over them? I don’t know, take a shower, maybe?”
“Nerves?”
Draco still looked like he was a bit in shock. “You’ve gotten me a holiday to Los Angeles?”
“Oh hell no, I regret ever saying those words—”
“Yes, well, it was rather hard to ignore—like a train wreck, you know...” Malfoy waved a hand at the length of his body and Harry looked down at his baggy trousers and worn, faded shirt. His throat tightened. After the war, he’d burned all of Dudley’s castoffs in the backyard of Grimmauld. He had felt euphoric, on the cusp of something, clutching a bottle of whiskey to his chest as he swayed, watching the flames devour his old skin. But when he had gone the next day to replace it all, he found he had no idea what he liked, and his stomach twisted with embarrassment when he tried to approach a clerk for help. In the end, he bought a small pile of bland basics and hadn’t gone shopping since. He swallowed, trying desperately to regain his footing. But then Malfoy cleared his throat into the silence and clapped twice briskly.
Harry sat in the bed for a few moments, knees drawn up toward his chest, breathing heavily. He wasn’t embarrassed—he and Draco were far too good of friends for that. But he was a tiny bit unsettled, just by the shuddering intensity of what he had felt those few dense, dragged-out moments. He thought back to his last conversation with Ron, twisting his hands in the duvet. He had actually felt, for a brief, precious instant, that everything would be fine—good,
Draco stared at the photos for a few moments, imagining what the coverage would have been had it been him holding Potter’s hand. Then he threw the paper into the fire and flooed into work.
Harry lay there for a few moments, panting, reeling, before deciding he was simply not going to think about the implications of what he had just gotten off to. Instead, he flicked a hasty cleaning charm over himself, rolled back onto his stomach, and fell asleep.
Harry nosed up the column of Draco’s throat, slid his other palm up Draco’s chest, kissed him once, soft, then again.
s, said Ron. Whatever it was, Harry was glad for the music—at least they had this one thing they could experience unreservedly, one bit of new, common ground.
The pale, cool light of the early morning filtered in through the window. The sheets felt smooth under Harry’s skin. He was still half-asleep and cozy, spooned up against a warm chest, feeling the languid rise and fall of breath against his back. Distantly, he heard himself let out a low, contented sigh as the body behind him shifted, pressed closer. Harry was dimly aware that it was Draco’s body, and also that Draco was
Sometimes it felt unbelievable to Harry, that they had all ended up together, this motley crew of Gryffindors and Slytherins (and Luna). It had been he and Draco who brought everyone together; the others hadn’t really had a choice. At first, they had circled around the bruises and grudges, wary, wounded animals. But one night, Ginny looked Pansy straight in the eye and asked her why she had been such a fucking cunt. Everyone started screaming but somehow it ended in hysterical laughter all around. Nobody circled the bruises after that, they just poked at them, incessantly and mercilessly until they settled into the type of friendship where nothing was off-limits—a complete lack of healthy boundaries, Hermione said. Draco called it an understandable response to shared trauma. Now they were the poster children for post-war reconciliation. Seamus looked to be nodding off on Dean’s shoulder while Dean chatted with Blaise and Luna, and Ginny and Pansy were passing a bottle of champagne back and forth, shrieking with laughter about something Harry was sure he didn’t want to know. On his one side, of course, was Draco, and on the other was Ron, leaning back on his hands, long legs splayed out on the rug and bracketed around Hermione, tucked against his chest. She took a long drag on the joint she was holding and passed it up to Ron, fitting it between his lips as she exhaled a cloud of smoke around their heads.
José went extremely red at that, coughing a bit into his drink. He had spent quite a bit of time with their whole group of friends over the past couple of months, but he still seemed a bit uneasy, clearly not used to their vicious, invasive confidences. Draco was still expounding upon just how sexually satisfied he was, to José’s obvious embarrassment, when Luna swiveled around in her seat.
After they left, Neville clapped Harry on the back and said, “You alright?” And Harry had to roll his eyes and assure them both that he was in fact perfectly fine, even as he was thinking about how he could convince Circe and Cassie to get into bed with him later so that the house would feel less empty. In an attempt to deflect from his own misery, he launched a rather over-enthused defense of José and how nice he was to Draco, in response to which Greg grunted, “Seems like a bit of a tight-arse, though.”
“Look, Hermione, sorry to interrupt, but I’ve told Malfoy I’ll go to a muggle rock concert with him tonight and I—"
The day before they were set to leave for Los Angeles, Harry met Ron for lunch at the Leaky. They had already gotten caught up on Ron and Hermione’s honeymoon when they’d arrived back in England the week prior, so the discussion focused on Harry’s upcoming trip.
“So needy,” he murmured, and Harry shivered and squeezed his eyes shut. “So obedient,” he continued, “keeping your hands back there like I asked and fucking yourself open on my cock.” Harry’s whole body spasmed, and Draco pushed a bit farther, “I had no idea you’d be so desperate, such a little slag for it,” Harry shuddered violently, and Draco brought a hand back up, sliding two fingers back into his mouth. Harry whined around them, sucking, and Draco couldn’t help thrusting up, just once. “That’s it,” he whispered, and Harry tightened around him, his spine curling in, “Just like that,” he continued, “You’re doing so well, Harry, you feel—
Inside, Harry kept holding Malfoy’s hand. He looked around Malfoy’s flat, the kitchen nook right by the door, mismatched pottery mugs hanging from hooks over the sink, a loaf of rustic bread cut-side down on a wooden board. The colourful throw rugs scattered across the floor; the beanbag and squat velvet armchair by the single large window. He had so much space at Grimmauld, so many rooms, yet Malfoy managed to fit everything Harry wanted into this tiny, unassuming flat. He turned around to face Malfoy, awed.
“Of course he looks good,” Harry muttered, “Tosser always looks good.” He allowed his gaze to roam up Draco’s long legs—the skinny jeans left very little to the imagination—over the sway of his narrow hips, the sharp planes of his back, his tattoos visible through the fine mesh of his shirt.
Sat at the bar, Harry drank his beer rather faster than he usually would, for lack of anything else to do with his hands and mouth. Malfoy seemed content to sit silently. Halfway through his second beer, Harry asked, “When’s the band supposed to come on?” and Malfoy grimaced, looking down at where his hands clasped around his pint glass, “Oh, er, I think they should be on around nine, I forgot to mention— I usually arrive early, have a drink or two, I didn’t think—”
“Like what?” Harry whispered, eyes downcast, flicking his tongue over his lower lip.
He shook his head, reaching out to squeeze José’s forearm. “If you must know, we’re exceedingly happy together, and I certainly have not contemplated whether he is
“Christ, Potter, yes, it’s good.”
Harry was as attentive as Draco remembered, asking what he liked, gauging his reactions, chasing his pleasure, and Draco realized he was close in an embarrassingly short time.
my arse? Have you seen the size of his head—literally
“You look starving. Ginny wore you out today?”
“It’s just…” Neville cocked his head to the side, leaned his hip against the sinks. “A two-week international holiday? That’s something boyfriends do, yeah?”
Harry brought his fingertips up to ghost against Draco’s chest, spread them wide, flattened his palm slow as molasses. “I feel it.” He let the weight of his hand settle slightly and felt Draco’s breath hitch. “Draco, I feel it. I feel it, but it’s ok if you don’t or if—”
“Is that—is that what I look like?” Harry asked, hating how his voice came out unsteady, pleading.
wish that the two of you would have the most
Draco sniffed, “You know he’s only going to be annoyed for exactly two seconds before he gets smug about us going together instead.”
Of course, Harry knew he looked good too. Frankly, he hadn’t had time to be self-conscious about his looks back in school but if he had, he probably would have fretted most about being so scrawny. He wasn’t underfed anymore, but he had stayed on the skinny side. It suited him, though—Draco always said he was proportionate, compact and wiry. Once, after a few drinks, Hermione had said that his childhood with the Dursleys had probably permanently stunted his growth, and immediately got this horrified look in her eyes and clapped a hand over her mouth, apologizing for being so clinical about it, so callous. Harry wasn’t really bothered though. It was probably true, in any case, and it lent support to his theory that he was stunted on the inside too.
Harry sat back on his hands and let Draco tell him all about everything they were going to do. The crickets buzzed in the grass and the low orange sun was hot on his skin and he closed his eyes, listening to the sound of Draco’s voice.
“I could ask you the same thing, although I might have warmed up to it first—never heard of foreplay, Potter?”
Hermione shot him a sympathetic look as he walked out.
,” he groaned, “I knew Ron would come through with the food.”
rang out, Draco slid his hand into Harry’s and squeezed. Harry squeezed back, looking straight ahead, blinking into the blinding stage lights. The day the single dropped on Myspace Harry had pulled it up on the modified muggle computer they had managed to rig up in one of Grimmauld's back rooms. Draco had been leaning on the wall waiting for it to load, chewing a fingernail in anticipation. When it ended, he cleared his throat and said lightly,
“Near death experience,” he gestured to Draco, “Causing you to realize the true extent of your feelings for him,” he gestured back at Harry, “Hospital bedside confession of love,” motioning at their clasped hands, “Classic stuff, really.”
of when he saw Malfoy, before, it’s just that, when he thought back over the years preceding what he had taken to calling The Christmas Incident, he noted that he usually ran into Malfoy in passing about once every month or two. Harry might see him in the ministry cafeteria at lunch, or by the lifts at the end of the day, or coming out of Kingsley’s office with his financial reports when Harry was stopping by for a spot of tea on his break. It wasn’t at all odd, he firmly told the Hermione-shaped voice in his head, that he remembered where, or when, or how frequently he was used to running into Malfoy. He simply had a finely tuned Malfoy-awareness, like a sixth sense, honed by years of careful attention at Hogwarts. Conveniently, now that he was once again curious about Malfoy’s whereabouts, he found that his awareness hadn’t turned off, or gone dormant, as he might have supposed. Instead, it turned out that his brain had been carefully cataloguing all of his interactions with Malfoy over the past two years and quietly filing them away, and now he was excruciatingly aware that he had gone much longer without seeing Malfoy than could possibly be considered normal.
Draco blinked, then smiled. “Mine I suppose—I’ll just leave now, and maybe I’ll be able to salvage this poor suit.”
Malfoy nodded at him as he resumed his seat, and together they continued to drink in silence. At a few minutes til, Malfoy started in his seat, downing his glass, “Oh! I forgot to mention—you’d better cast a protective ear charm before we get up near the speakers. These muggles have no regard for their hearing, I swear, the first time I went to a show back in LA my ears were ringing for two days afterwards until I healed them myself.”
“Oh,” Harry flattened his palm against Draco’s back and flexed his fingers. “I… wish I could stay. I’ll see you—”
Harry looked at him blankly.
Draco toured Harry around the campus at the Los Angeles Institute for Research of Dark Objects and Occult Magic (or the
The problem was that he knew he was lying. Harry hated lying to his friends. It felt odd, so unfamiliar, when they had all torn down their walls and moved into each other’s gardens years ago. But he couldn’t admit it, when they asked, because he knew he wouldn’t be able stand their reaction. Every single one of them would smirk victoriously and crow about how they had all been right all along, and then Harry would be forced to explain that he wasn’t jealous of José, he was jealous of

Harry had that with Draco. It had crept up on them, over the years, with each shift in their relationship—becoming friends when Harry was still a trainee at Gringotts, then requesting each other as full-time partners, then moving Draco into Grimmauld. Now, Draco was there when Harry woke up, brewing tea for the both of them in the mornings and murmuring to the cats as he set their food out. He charmed the wrinkles out of Harry’s shirts when they needed to look properly starched for something at work; he brewed all the basic potions in their medicine cabinet out of his makeshift laboratory in the basement. They ate breakfast together and went to work together and came home together and went out together. Their days were filled with each other, and Harry sometimes wondered that neither of them ever seemed to tire of it. Their friends made fun of them, saying they were even worse than an old married couple, because even old married couples needed some space, sometimes. Most people they knew said things like that about relationships, things like
. He tore off his shirt, kicked away his trousers, tongue thick in his mouth. He slid his hands underneath Draco’s jumper, up over the taut muscles of his abdomen, as he lifted it over his head. Harry immediately threaded his hands back into Draco’s hair, kissing him again, trailing his fingers down, working his trousers open and pushing them off, ardent, feverish. Naked, Draco stood before him, flushed and pale, glowing in the low lamplight of the flat.

“Right,” Draco heaved in a breath, “Why did I ask.”
impression this bar has ever seen.” Harry grinned wide.
“Ah,” Harry shook his head, some of the fuzz clearing out of his thoughts. “Don’t mention it. It’s—we both gave as good as we got.”
“…Potter?” Draco tried hesitantly, “Are you sure you’re quite alright?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Was it going to California?” Hermione cut in, her tone decisive and knowing, “A romantic getaway… Getting to know Draco’s past like that… Sharing a bed in that, shall we say,
“Ah,” Draco said gently, ignoring the sudden sensation that his stomach was attempting to escape his body through his throat. He swiveled around to knock his shoulder against Potter’s. “Asking for a friend, are we?”
Potter blanched. “Well, this is actually the first time we’ve really gone out in public, so I suppose you won’t have long to wait.”
“A wish for everyone!” Ginny yelled, sloshing champagne on the ground.
“So what was it?” asked Ron.

It didn’t take long to devolve into committed, fervid debauchery. Blaise looked like he was on cloud nine, sandwiched between Neville and Greg with a rapturous expression on his face. Ginny and Luna were wrapped around each other like squids, making out ferociously. Draco was bent low at the knees, dancing up on Pansy. Harry backed up into the cage of his limbs, wiggling his hips and slurping his drink. Seamus immediately plastered himself against Harry’s front, pushing him closer to Draco. Behind him, Dean winked at Harry as he nibbled on Seamus’ ear. Harry leaned back into Draco’s chest, really committing to it, arching his back and rolling his hips sinuously. Seamus whooped and backed off a little, and Harry grinned. He handed his drink off to Draco and leaned forward, putting his hands on his knees and bouncing his hips on Draco’s crotch. Draco’s hand was hot on the small of his back, sticking to the sweat soaking through his shirt. He threw a smirk over his shoulder and saw Draco leaning back and looking very self-satisfied. Pansy was peeking out from behind him, spreading her fingers over Draco’s chest as he reached back and fed her the rest of the drink.
kissed us.”
Malfoy drew in a deep breath. “Potter, I can’t—”
And then Potter was gone. Draco remained sitting up, listening to his footsteps recede, waiting for the telltale rush of the flames. When it died out and he was alone again, he crawled back underneath the covers, drawing the duvet up over his head. He placed a hand in the warm space Potter had left behind, and he breathed slowly, and he did not come out for a long while.
Over a few more drinks, Potter shared his anxieties: the invasive nature of the press, the upending of his own expectations for his future, the fact that he had no idea how to go about living this new life, now. Potter had been with Weasley since the end of the War, and of course
“Oh, yes Draco, my head is

“Right,” Harry said, taking a deep breath, his nerves easing slightly. “Right, ok, yeah, it’s just music, which we both like, we’ll just go and listen to the music and it won’t be weird. Ok.” He started toward the door and then turned back around, “Oh bollocks, Hermione, what do I wear?”
“Mmm, I do like the sound of all that,” he hummed, “But right now I think I want you just like this.”
—Merlin, where had that image come from? He cracked through the thick crust and brought the spoonful up to his lips. At the first taste, Harry heard himself whimper, realizing belatedly and trying to choke himself off, turning the sound strangled.
Harry shoved him off, “You’re such a prick,”
“Pansy going soft, can you imagine?” Ginny leaned forward, eyes glittering, “Like, for instance, if she were now making sweet, sweet love to Anthony Goldstein at home, in a
Cocktail in hand, Harry grabbed a bite-sized piece of bruschetta off a floating tray.
“Hands behind your back,” Draco growled, and Harry obeyed, clasping his hands together, another soft noise escaping his throat.
In the three months that Draco had been a regular member of Hermione Granger’s pub quiz team, he’d started to notice some subtle shifts in the way he was treated. He’d originally shown up at the pub quiz looking for an outlet for his competitive spirit and arcane knowledge about wizarding history and culture. He’d felt sick with nerves that first night as he walked in, terrified that he would be turned away. But he had been treated politely, if not warmly, and he had been satisfied with that. He was happy just to participate, to bounce around between teams of his peers who didn’t object to his mere presence, treated him cordially, even. He didn’t think he could expect anything more, really. But recently, some of them had started to greet him when he arrived, in a genuinely friendly way; Penelope Clearwater asked how his weekend had been, or Padma Patil approached him with the latest gossip out of the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Granger of course was unfailingly polite, and occasionally engaged him in truly fascinating conversation about wizarding politics or magical theory between rounds—it was still a bit awkward, but he genuinely enjoyed her company. It was all down to Potter of course, who’d continued to be bafflingly friendly after strong-arming Draco onto the team (a team he wasn’t even part of himself, by the way). Everyone followed his lead of course, despite their obvious surprise and confusion. Potter pretended not to notice, or perhaps he really didn’t notice. He always was blithely oblivious to the power he had over his peers—the way they looked up to him, deferred to him, adored him, really. No one was immune, not even Draco, despite his best efforts. He had been doing his utmost to maintain some distance from Potter, to convince himself not to want anything more out of their odd little
“I know I said I’d be getting you the usual this year, but…I also got you something else, and I wanted to give it to you now.”
Harry grinned sheepishly, “Alright, yeah, I don’t think that’s going to happen. I guess the real worst case is he doesn’t feel the same way and just wants to stay friends?”
… God, I wanted you, and every day, I thought—”
Draco nodded feverishly. Harry dropped to his knees, nuzzling into Draco’s groin, and then he was looking up, eyes wide, saying, “Yes?” And Draco swallowed thickly, trying to get the word out, “
Back at home, lounging on the sofa with Cassie and Circe, sucking salty grease off their fingers and passing the bowl back and forth, Draco said, "Is this it? Old age?”
“Come here.”
He ran a hand through Harry’s hair when they broke apart, chuckling gently.
Ron grimaced, and Draco cut in, “Speaking from my experience as a rather
“Against my better judgment, I’m sure.”
Draco looked up, eyes sharp. “You asked for this, you know. Be careful what you wish for, and all that...”
For a moment, Harry was forcefully reminded of Malfoy standing over him stark naked, that hysterical laugh bubbling out of him, looking down at Harry with surprise and wonder in his eyes.
Draco made a soft noise, tilting his chin forward, and their lips met. The kiss was tentative at first, and then desperate. Harry pressed Draco bodily against the wall, fisting his fingers in Draco’s hair. The blood left Draco’s brain shockingly quickly, leaving him dizzy and breathless, and before he knew it, Harry’s hands were at the buttons of Draco’s trousers and he was gasping, “Please, Draco—can I—”
Instantly, her arms were around him. Draco buried his face in her hair, trying to steady his breathing.
“You’re alright,” Harry was already at his side. “There was an embedded blasting curse concealed under the floorboard behind the desk but they’ve patched you up, you’re going to be fine.”
all the way down the stairs. But he hadn’t ever seen Malfoy in muggle clothes; he was always wearing his uniform robes when Harry visited the shop. He’d put on a nice pair of trousers, the sort that hugged his lean legs in a very inviting way, and a dark forest green jumper that was probably made of cashmere or something equally luxurious—Harry didn’t know much about fabrics, but it looked very soft, much softer even than the walls in Malfoy’s flat. His fingers ached to reach out and touch it, touch Malfoy. And
“Boys!” Hermione shouted, “I, for one, would like an answer as to whether the universe takes wishes literally,” she turned to Luna, who blinked serenely and said, “I imagine it couldn’t hurt to clarify… Gregory, did you mean your wish to be taken literally?”
Draco looked so pleased, thanking Susan for the invitation and expressing his excitement, Harry could hardly stand it. He managed to extricate himself without doing anything colossally stupid, like launching himself at Draco and licking all the glitter off his chest (he just squeezed his arm like a normal person instead). Then he and Ron made their way out of the party, nicking some hors d’oeuvres for the road. He spent the next few hours filling out paperwork on the smuggling case, and trying not to think about Draco’s jumpsuit, and his hair, and his makeup, and the way his lips had parted when he leaned into Harry’s touch.
. They got stoned and walked the Venice Beach boardwalk, watching the street performers, the buskers and circus acrobats, speculating which ones might be using a little bit of magic.
Harry frowned. He hadn’t expected Malfoy to be this standoffish. He suddenly remembered that they had hated each other for all their formative years, only cooling off into mutual dislike after the war, and finally settling into bland politeness since Malfoy had started at the Ministry. Maybe Malfoy had regretted the whole night? He took a deep breath.
Ron leaned forward, an avid glow in his eyes. “Right then, what was it that finally made you figure it out? Was it when he almost died and you realized you couldn’t live without him?”
José laughed and Harry watched a bit of tension leave his shoulders. He had very nice shoulders, broad and strong, and Harry thought Draco must like those shoulders a lot, and he imagined José crowding Draco up a wall, Draco’s elegant fingers clutching those tall, broad shoulders, and—where had that thought come from? Merlin, he should not be thinking about Draco’s boyfriend that way. He took a large swallow of ale and tuned back in to hear José say something about how
Harry looked over and shrugged. Draco returned the gesture, feigning nonchalance, as if he were indifferent to Rihanna, as if he hadn't been listening to
He stepped through the fireplace and crossed into the kitchen, finding Ron pulling a bubbling baked ziti out of the oven. Hermione emerged from her study a few minutes later and Harry cracked open the wine, the two of them setting the table while Ron dressed the salad. Once they were seated, Harry didn’t have long to wait for the Inquisition.
“It’s true,” Dean piped up, carding his fingers through Seamus’ hair, “I wish you could see how happy you make each other.”
He was silent for a moment, and terror flared up Harry's spine. He was about to take it back, laugh it off, when Draco spoke.
Neville held out the spliff to him, and he shook his head quickly. “No, thank you, I don’t smoke,” he said, voice laced with the barest hint of tightness. Harry arched an eyebrow at Draco, who responded with the tiniest eyeroll.
He had just lifted the bacon out onto a platter and was cracking eggs into the spitting pan when Draco and José rounded the corner, damp haired and flushed, like they’d just sucked each other off in the shower, which Harry knew by now was Draco’s go-to move in the morning. Jackpot.
“So, José,” Blaise drawled, “I have to ask, what is it exactly that you see in our dear Draco here?”
). At the very end was a line of text:
After, they dozed off and roused, showering together and dressing in pajamas—Harry had quite a collection of flannels that Draco was only too happy to snuggle into, and as he shrugged into a particularly cozy number, he popped his head out the top to see Harry looking at him with a dazed, silly smile, eyes shining in his face. Harry led Draco down to the kitchen, where he proceeded to make a full fry-up which they both dug into ravenously. They spent the afternoon under blankets on the couch, talking quietly and watching the snow fall outside, Harry occasionally reaching out to touch Draco’s face disbelievingly, Draco sometimes breaking out into giddy laughter for no reason at all.
“I might—I might want—” he put his fork down, twisting his hands in his lap, “Imightwanttodatehim—”
Draco snorted.
Harry squeezed his hand.
“So there’s no mystery—"
“Go on, then,” Hermione replied, while Ron made an encouraging grunt through a mouthful of food.
, even—if he had touched Draco’s skin, breathed his air. He hadn’t felt hot with self-consciousness, or petrified by the prospect of baring himself, or worried that he wouldn’t be good, that they wouldn’t want the same things from each other’s bodies. But now, as the sleep-haze was receding from his mind, he felt the fear creeping back in. God, what if he hadn’t come to his senses when he did? His stomach twisted as he recalled that sharp instant when he had rocked back, desire singing in his veins—he could still feel it in his mouth now, his tongue thick and heavy with it. He could have gone too far, made a mess of himself in front of Draco, made things strange between them. And he definitely didn’t want that. No, Draco had been right—it was just the morning, just the clinging vestiges of a peculiar dream state. He heaved a sigh and slipped out from under the duvet, rolling his shoulders, physically shaking the lingering restlessness from his body and shrugging into the plush hotel bathrobe thrown over the armchair next to the bed, sliding his feet into the matching fluffy slippers.
Draco reached out, brushed a thumb across Harry’s lower lip, grazed his fingernails along Harry’s jawline. “You want me to be…

“Christ,” he said, “I feel like I’ve been trampled in the pit at a Taking Back Sunday concert.”
“It’s about Draco.”
, and explained to him what the “Moral Majority” was, which he described as
So together, in the cosy flat above Malfoy’s Mellow Medicinals, they drew the starry hangings around the bed, and sheltered under the downy duvet, and wrapped their limbs around each other. And it was almost unbearably easy for Harry to fall asleep, just like that, with Draco's hand in his hair and the taste of lemons in his mouth.
“I’m fine!” he repeated, sounding rather like he was on the verge of a panic attack. “I just need to go home—” dressed, he finally turned to Draco, eyes and fingers twitching like a trapped animal. “This was—” he shook his head frantically, “I don’t know. Just please—please don’t let this get in the papers?”
“Harry,” she asked softly, “what happened?”

planning to seduce
“Why not?” asked Greg, frowning.
It had started at the five-year anniversary War Memorial Gala. The two of them were fast friends by then, working together at Gringotts more often than not, going to shows and dragging their friends out to pubs. Harry of course was the guest of honor, had been asked to give a speech and everything. He was dreading it. Draco hadn’t been invited at all. He pretended like he didn’t care but Harry could tell that he was miserable, wracked with guilt over both his past and the fact that he was upset about still paying for it now.
a real venue that would have hosted these types of shows in the mid-2000s.
Harry looked up at him, eyes wild.
José’s eyes snapped to Harry, “What whole thing?” His tone was light but his eyes were considerably less warm than they’d been a minute earlier.
Draco slit open the envelope, fishing out… two more envelopes, one white and one black. His eyes narrowed. “What is this, some kind of birthday card Russian doll?”
He didn’t quite admit it out loud though, just cracked open his eyes and gritted out, “What do you think?”
“Wow, Ron, this is incredible—”
Greg took a pensive puff and then proclaimed, “He doesn’t smoke. Perfect skin. Goes to all the best muggle movies. Takes Draco to fancy restaurants...” He shook his head, “He likes nice things.” Harry and Neville nodded in agreement. Greg shrugged. “Draco’s not a nice thing.”
“Ok, I’ll tell you, but you guys can’t laugh at me, alright?”
Draco taught Potter how to finger him open, slowly, teasing at first, and Potter was careful and attentive, and so gentle Draco almost couldn’t bear it. When he brushed two fingers against Draco’s prostate and Draco cried out, Potter stayed on the spot, draping his body over Draco’s to murmur in his ear, “Right there? Is that good?” and Draco moaned, “
“Not just you,” Draco exhaled slowly, “We’re getting older, you know, people are settling down or thinking about it—they think we should be thinking about it too, I suppose.”
Harry.
Harry had noticed that Malfoy was good-looking before, of course, but he hadn’t really stopped to think about it; he just noticed it and went back to work. But now he was wondering whether it would be possible to call in sick from work indefinitely and spend all his days in Malfoy’s flat instead, held in by the soft-looking walls, the twinkling bed hangings; held by Malfoy himself, his bright, soft hair falling around Harry’s face.
you know the words to this song. So buck up, Potter, we’re about to deliver the best…
A slight frown creased Harry’s forehead.
. And it was just the sort of thing that he
Harry could have stayed there for ages, on his knees in the little flat above Draco’s shop. But when Draco croaked out, “Bed,” Harry obeyed. Standing, he followed Draco, tripping, delirious, as they stumbled under the hangings, Draco sprawling across the bedspread and tugging Harry down after him. Draco’s skin was flushed and fevered beneath him and when Harry touched him his fingers buzzed and his spine tingled.
Harry grimaced, "Come on, I've got more baggage than anyone knows what to do with, myself included— Look, I don't really want to get into it right now, honestly, it'll put me off my dinner."
Draco looked over at Harry across the back garden at the Burrow. He was lounging against the low garden wall, chatting with Ron, his hair mussed and sticking to his sweaty forehead, a smudge on his glasses. When he lifted his beer to take a swig, Draco could see a dusty scrape on his elbow from when he’d gotten a bit rowdy during their pickup quidditch game earlier and crash-landed out of a dive. They weren’t teenagers anymore, Draco kept trying to tell him.
“My turn,” Hermione declared, setting down her drink and sitting up straight, leaning over to poke Harry in the chest, “Harry, you’re an idiot—”
and held his bottle of ale in the air.
“Fuck,” Draco muttered, slicking himself. As he pushed in, Harry’s eyes fluttered and he made a soft
Draco could have kicked himself. Since he’d started working at the Ministry two years ago and begun crossing paths with Potter and the rest of his former classmates (even, he was proud to say, approaching friendliness with some of them), the schoolboy crush he’d had at Hogwarts had come roaring back full force, approaching truly embarrassing levels. Pansy teased him mercilessly about it at every opportunity. He couldn’t seem to maintain his cool around Potter, always blushing, or overcompensating with too much snark, or doing stupid shite like drunkenly calling Potter over to his corner of the bar on Christmas Eve when he clearly didn’t want to talk to anyone.
“Very funny,” he palmed Draco’s arse as he pulled out almost all the way and stayed there, teasing, moving his thumbs in little circles against Draco’s skin, “I’ve been thinking, since we’ve been fucking—” he thrust all the way back in, long and slow and torturous, “And it’s good, yeah?”
“What rules?” asked José, who had located some tall glasses and was filling a pitcher with ice water. That was good. Harry hated when guests didn’t even try to make themselves useful.
“Oh no, no, no,” Pansy held her hands up, shaking her head, “You’re not pulling this matchmaking shit on me, now—”
“God, yeah,” Harry slumped against the doorframe, running a hand through his hair, “Massive smuggling ring bust, loads of inventory and paperwork to sign off on, warrants, intake, the lot of it—I’ve been in the office for sixteen fucking hours, Malfoy, I am— I am
'Buy You a Drank (Shawty Snappin)' by T-Pain is the song Draco sings in Harry's face
Draco was out with Greg and Neville when Harry got back after dinner, and the next morning he slept in late, while Harry went flying with Ginny for most of the day. By the time he got back it was late afternoon, and when he emerged from the shower and made his way to the kitchen to search out some food, he found Draco making an afternoon cuppa. He waited in the doorway, watching Draco’s nimble fingers as he shut off the kettle, poured out the water, added two spoonfuls of sugar. He kept staring, silent, his very bones humming as Draco turned around with a smile, took a sip, set his cup down on the table and leaned back against it, crossing one leg over the other.
“Ah… I didn’t mean…”
“Er, what?”
On Wednesday evening, Harry met Ron at the catering offices. The tasting was held in a bright dining hall full of small tables filled with other patrons, all of whom were testing out their own menus. An elderly maître-d quickly swooped in, presenting them with printed out menu cards and offering a selection of wines. Harry, who normally relied on Draco to pick out his wine for him, just told the man to bring them whatever he would recommend. They ate their way through a wide selection of appetizers, three types of salads, two pastas, a roast and a fish—small servings, but Harry was stuffed by the end.
“You know,” Seamus whispered conspiratorially, “There’s one foolproof way you can ensure he gets laid tonight,” he waggled his eyebrows.
-ing me, you insufferable—”
Draco swallowed, and brought his fingers back, gentle, into Harry’s hair, nails scratching lightly at his scalp. Somehow, although he wouldn’t have thought it possible, Harry relaxed even further, humming appreciatively.
“Yes,” Draco frowned, “but are you sure you’re alright?”
“No,” Harry waved dismissively, “I already knew that.”
Chuckling himself, he responded without thinking, “I’ve got you and Ron both for regular quidditch talk and it turns out I actually can’t take much more.”
) to how serious he was with Wood (“
“Oh god,” Harry said, a hysterical giggle clawing up out of his chest, “I don’t know
“He looks good, eh?” Seamus elbowed Harry’s ribs.
“Ron, Draco just took a blasting curse to the ribs; I’m covered in his fucking blood; the last thing I’m thinking about is my supposed romantic feelings for him—”
“What?”
“No, I just, I haven’t seen you in a while and I saw your door here and thought I’d say hi. That’s it, really…”
Harry looked around, feeling his chest get tight. Fuck, he loved these people. Distantly, he heard himself sniffling a little and wiped his nose on his jumper sleeve.

Draco attempted an eye roll. “You’ve no idea how long I’ve been ready for this exact scenario, Potter.”
“Are you actually mad at me? Because that was…extremely hot.”
“The hunky healer,” Draco waggled his eyebrows.
Ginny smirked.
It had started about a year into Draco’s tenure with Puddlemere. Just a bit of subtle flirting, at first. Draco hadn’t known how to react, couldn’t allow himself to believe it could be true. He worried that he had tipped his hand, stared too long at Potter’s bare torso that one time in the locker room. He resolved to maintain professional boundaries. But then, predictably, Potter just kept
“Well, I was dropping off the monthly Auror expense reports. Usually we send them through the memo system but I’d been at my desk all day so I thought I’d just walk them over…” he trailed off awkwardly, as Malfoy’s eyes narrowed.
And Draco replied, eyes twinkling,
Harry laughed again, bright and radiant, rolling his hips slow.
The scratching on the window grew harder to ignore. Grumbling, he dragged himself out of bed and across the room. Harry’s little brown owl was at the window again. He contemplated shooing it away, but it looked at him so apologetically he couldn’t help letting it in for a treat. The owl winged over to him and dropped a parcel, hooted at him in solidarity, and flapped back out. Draco begrudgingly unwrapped the parcel, seeing that it was the latest
He wasn’t sure what to do with this line of thought, and his mind was a hot, late-summer haze, so he just kept staring. A silly smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. He giggled again, still looking right at Malfoy. Malfoy had made drugs that had given him some weird, intense dry orgasm in the middle of a fucking muggle restaurant. And now, if Harry could only get his brain to work, he might be able to figure out how he and Malfoy might give each other more orgasms—
Harry started and shut his mouth, clearing his throat convulsively. “Malfoy.” Malfoy glared at him expectantly. “You, uh, you look different,” Harry observed lamely.

“It’s alright,” José flushed slightly. “I just think it’s,” he pursed his lips, “It’s bad for your health.”
excellent,” he grinned, “But it’s not just that... Just being in your shop feels good. Being in your flat feels good; seeing you feels good. I always feel good when I’m with you.”

“You’re right,” he sighed, “I just have to do it. Even if it’s not best case, it won’t be so bad…”

Harry clambered half up onto the bed next to Draco, brushing out the fine, soft strands with his fingers, sweeping the long fringe across his forehead.
late.”
” and Potter mouthed down the back of Draco’s neck and kept at it, slow and steady until Draco was hot and shivering, incoherent, pressing his face into the sheets and whimpering. And when he managed to form the word “please,” Potter breathed over the shell of his ear, “Could you come just like this? Just from my fingers?” Draco whined and nodded violently. “Fuck,” Potter groaned, drawing himself back upright. “I could too. I could come just watching myself do this to you.” Draco made a high-pitched sound and bucked back furiously. “But I won’t.” Potter withdrew and Draco gasped, writhing desperately. “I’m going to come inside you.” He added a third finger.
Harry jabbed his fingers into Draco’s chest. “Unbelievable.” He shook his head, “You are un-fucking-believable! I can’t even—” his eyes narrowed. “Wait a minute. Self-protective?” He raised an expectant eyebrow. Draco opened his mouth to say
“Well, I’m off to the bar… I’ll leave you two alone.” Nott winked and strode away, trench coat billowing.
“Merlin save me,” Draco shoved him down the hallway toward the bedroom. “I’d better adjust my expectations for romance—no flowers or chocolates or weekend trips to Paris in my future, it’s spag bol forever, now—”

Draco brought a hand up to Harry’s face, tilting his chin back up, “No, Harry,” he laughed gently, “I mean, it’s against policy for team members and management to… fraternize... If anyone finds out there’ll be a humiliating inquiry and we could both face sanctions.”
“Oi—” Neville shook a finger at Draco, “You’re one of us!”
“No, no, go on!” Hermione exclaimed.
“Er… yeah. That.”
“No!” Shrieked Ginny, “Please, no! Harry, I’ve gone years without seeing you naked and I don’t fancy a flashback.”

“Smoothie, stat. I’ll take these inside.”
She nodded, “Here he is now, love.”
“I’m sorry—” Malfoy cleared his throat, swaying back infinitesimally. “I’m sorry about the time I broke your nose.” He grimaced. “Least I could do, fixing you up this time.”
“Right,” Malfoy’s shoulders twitched with an abortive movement, a shudder harshly suppressed. He stepped back, unlatching the door. “Shall we?”
“Do I?” Draco shrugged, “Long week I suppose.

Greg shrugged and took a hit, squinting at José. “You know what’s not polite? Coming here on 4/20 when you don’t smoke…” he shook his head morosely. Harry and Neville broke out in twin peals of laughter.

“Well… thank you,” Draco forced himself to look at Harry as he said it, feeling the color rise in his cheeks. “I probably wouldn’t have eaten anything at all; this is much better.”
- rather than admit it was me?” Harry’s ears were ringing. He opened his mouth to protest but found he didn’t have anything to say. Draco held up a hand; his expression had gone cold. “You know Potter,” he said slowly, “I’ve had many uncharitable thoughts about you over the years, but I never did think you were a coward.” He turned on his heel and stalked out.
going to keep you here, god, see if I don’t—
Draco followed his gaze and snorted, “You know I don’t care for blonds.”
“I’m sure you think you’re quite funny.”
Potter’s face fell a bit. “Well… It’s probably better if you knew the song first… Which I guess maybe you don’t?”
Draco shrugged again, then sighed. “I shouldn’t have got my hopes up, anyways.” He cast his eyes down. “I thought maybe if I dated someone normal, then I could be normal, you know?”
“Shut it, Draco, you’re just as bad. The two of you, attached at the hip, disturbingly obsessed with each other, completely blind to the fact that you’re already in a relationship—”

“I want— I want you—” Harry bucked shamelessly, fucking himself on Draco’s fingers.
Getting ready for work the morning after Potter's overture, Draco tried to work out how royally fucked he might be. Truly, he was surprised that Potter had come to his office. He had, of course, been avoiding Potter like the plague. Much to his own chagrin, he’d been aware of Potter’s rough schedule for about a year now, on account of having a gigantic crush on him, so that was finally put to some good use by allowing Draco to effectively evade Potter in the Ministry cafeteria and the break rooms and the hallways and the atrium and the queues by the lifts. He’d known it couldn’t last forever. But he’d hoped that seeing less of Potter would help him move on. He certainly hadn’t expected Potter to ask to be

They didn’t get much work done, listening to the album and talking about the band’s show in a few weeks. At home, Harry played it again as he was brushing his teeth, and the song Draco had poked fun at him about stuck in his brain. He did hate being alone—both of them did. And as the singer went on describing an increasingly ridiculous and idiosyncratic friendship, Harry thought about Draco, and their friendship. He thought about them lying on the floor together in the living room, getting into character as Cassie and Circe, putting on high-pitched voices and comparing the number of mice they’d caught in the cellar. He thought of the night Draco moved in, the two of them jumping on the bed and screaming at the top of their lungs,
Draco threw his head back, laughing heartily. “I’m sorry, Harry, but who knows what the universe would do to us if the collective will isn’t logically consistent?” He smirked, raising an eyebrow, “I think we’re asking enough as it is that we don’t end up with our heads up each other arses.”

“No!” Harry reached out a hand toward Draco’s knee, and he flinched away. “No, Draco please—I’m sorry ok?” He ran a hand through his hair again, “You’ve got to know it wasn’t a disaster, I mean, honestly it was the best fuck of my life, I can't—” he choked out, “I can’t stop thinking about it, I can’t stop thinking about you—"
Draco’s breath caught and he looked down at Harry, trailed his fingers across his chest, “Yes, I want to,” he replied, kissing him again and rocking their hips together. When Harry pressed up against him with an urgent whine, he drew back, questioning, “How do you want it?”

shirt with a skinny black tie. The sleeves revealed most of Malfoy’s arms, baring the full sleeve of ink covering his left arm, tattooed tendrils of fire licking over all the exposed skin. The whole thing was an unfair assault on the senses, and Harry couldn’t be blamed for standing in the doorway gaping, until Malfoy looked up, frowned, and threw the scroll aside, straightening up (and he

“Honestly, I’m not sure,” he said, “I think they’re good together. They seem to make each other happy. I’m not sure what else is required?” He grimaced, feeling acutely the extent to which he didn’t understand what was required to love someone. He took a hit and passed the joint, asking, “What do you think, Greg?”
José nodded, “Yes, that is…” He looked around the table. “You invoked wish magic in order to get your friends to sleep together?”
the intensity between them. Harry didn’t see why that would be the solution at all. His feelings about Draco’s friendship were just that—feelings about a friendship. Intense feelings about an intense friendship. He knew that because loving Draco felt like loving Ron and Hermione, except wilder somehow, like it was trying to break out him. He wasn’t sure it was exactly the same, because the memory had gone fuzzy with age, but he thought maybe it was a bit like the early days with Ron, when he first realized that he had a friend, when he felt that screaming feeling of possibility, the terrifying joy, the asking
“Yes, Harry,” Draco bellowed, “It’s

Days in LA slid by in a bright haze of sunlight and smog. They spent long afternoons at the beach, wading in the cool shallows, striking out to the surf and tussling in the waves, flopping down onto their beach towels where Harry basked in the sun like a lizard while Draco compulsively cast and re-cast sun protection charms on himself. Draco took him to the grotty, sweaty venues he had haunted, to the hole-in-the-wall restaurants he’d loved best when he was a piss-poor student saving his money for shows, to the bars where they could get a cheap beer or a crisp, fresh margarita. Harry had a practically religious experience with some fish tacos sold out the side of a van parked next to the beach, the juicy flesh bursting in his mouth, tortillas hot and steaming in his hand, Draco watching him eat with satisfaction sparking in his eyes, saying,
, Potter, and leave me the fuck alone.” Potter was panting wetly around his fingers and Draco pushed further back towards his throat, wanting to make him gag, wanting to feel his breath stutter, “I’m not your fucking
Harry stared at him for a moment, then dropped his gaze and dragged it slowly back up to meet Draco’s. “You haven’t got anything to say to me? No
Dean swiped his drink, throwing it back and turning a warm smile on Harry. “Really, Harry, it was a lovely ceremony. And you can relax now, eh?”
Harry clambered onto his bike and started home. He might actually have to find another date to Ron and Hermione’s wedding. Or go stag of course, which he didn’t mind at all, and if he was being honest was a lot more likely than finding a date that wasn’t Draco. He wasn’t afraid to admit that the thought sent a little wring of disappointment through his chest, a slight, aching itch behind his sternum. Their friends would probably try to make something of that, say it meant that Harry really wanted to bring Draco as his
“Yes. Absolutely yes.”
“Alright, Harry,” Hermione said, shaking out her napkin and sliding in across from him. “What’s on your mind?”
“You’re very pretty.”
“Shhh…” He giggled. “You’re going to be okay. Just let me do the talking.”
“Not a chance,” Ron grinned.
“Watching you parade around the halls, swishing your little arse around my office, dangling yourself in front of me when I thought I couldn’t have you, teasing me like that every fucking day?”
“Alright, me next, me next,” Ginny demanded, sitting up and swiveling around to pin Harry with a fierce gaze, “I wish that you two would get your heads out of your arses and realize how perfect you are for each other.” She held up a bottle of champagne to toast and took a large swig straight from the lip.

, barely resting his upper arm against Harry’s chest. It was just casual enough that anyone who glanced at them would see friends who had had a few drinks, swaying into each others’ space. But nobody could see them, Harry realized, at least not from behind—they were at the outskirts of the party with their backs facing the wall, and Harry was
“I’d like to say a few words. Harry, if you would—”
. Was that what he thought it was? Did he just get off on eating a fucking
. In a moment of weakness, Harry grabbed him, hauled him in and kissed him. Just once, hard, eyes open. He broke away laughing, still singing, like it was just a joke, just good fun between them like it always was, like his heart wasn’t in his mouth, choking him. Draco grinned, slinging an arm around Harry’s shoulders and turning his face back toward the stage, belting out the words, blissfully unaware that the world was tilting on its axis. Harry wanted to bury his face in Draco’s neck, clutch his face and kiss him again, apparate them home and fuck him in the hallway between their bedrooms. Why the fuck had he been puttering around,
“Ah, before I forget,” Draco pointed his wand at the fireplace mantel and fat joint came zooming into his waiting hand. “The gentle giants left us a few holiday presents.” He took a drag and burrowed further into the couch, passing it to Harry. “Nature’s best hangover cure.”
dignified sex you can imagine—fucking filthy shit, all your most depraved, kinkiest fantasies, the type of stuff you have to get plastered to even admit you want to try—”
“That’s what sobering charms are for,” Harry snickered, “And anyways, it’s just paperwork… much more bearable after a few drinks,” he grinned.
—” Hermione moaned quietly into her hands. “Merlin, mate I’m sorry I had no idea—"
But he had never been brave. He nodded tightly.
“Honestly, though, if I look anywhere near as awful as you, could you spruce me up a bit—a mouth-freshening charm wouldn’t hurt either…”
. Teasing Draco constantly with juvenile sexual innuendo, biting his lip, standing too close. And Draco knew he was being messed with. He knew Potter couldn’t actually be hitting on him. The overtures were too over the top, and he was
“You haven’t mentioned Potter yet.”
Pansy stayed with him all evening, through dinner and another bottle of wine, and a cathartic hour blaring Madonna in the sitting room and dancing on the furniture (after the war, Draco and Pansy had embarked on a personal quest to better understand muggle culture, which hadn’t been too successful, but had resulted in a mutual obsession with 80s muggle music). By the time she left, Draco was quite distracted and thoroughly exhausted. Pansy always knew exactly what he needed. She had found him, on New Year’s Eve, still in bed at four o’ clock in the afternoon and more than a little drunk. He’d been in a haze since Christmas, not leaving the house except to pick up takeaway and booze, eating on his sofa and drinking in bed. She’d taken one look at him and gotten right in the bed, hit him with a sobering charm and insisted he tell her everything. When he said
José adapted well to that, smiling good-naturedly, and he was quite nice during breakfast and offered to help clean up afterwards, so Harry was feeling very charitable towards him when he said, “What are you doing next weekend? You should come over for brunch before the Harpies game on Saturday. We’re going to Seamus and Dean’s to listen, too, if you want to join.”
Yes, Harry knew Gringotts threw their new trainees right into the deep end—he had been looking forward to that specifically, in fact—but Merlin, Malfoy was a
Ron had taken on the wedding planning in good spirits, but he hadn’t exactly been excited about coordinating table and chair rentals. Here, though, he was in his element. Leaning back and rubbing his belly, he let out a contented sigh.
, Blaise,” Pansy interrupted, “
“But it’s Christmas,” Harry pouted, “and you’re in my house, so you’ve got to suffer all my awful Christmas-themed innuendo.”
“Yes,” Harry nodded emphatically, “And if we have to keep this a secret you’d better not come back to the lounge with me right now because I won’t be able to keep my hands off you. I’ll just go and make a quick round of goodbyes, say I’m feeling tired. Yours or mine?”
The song everyone sings for Draco's birthday when they arrive at the club is, of course, 'In Da Club' by 50 Cent
“Yes, well,” José stiffened, “I don’t drink very much.”
“I don’t think it’s insane to contemplate the questions you asked the universe to answer,” she replied.
The garden erupted, everyone whooping and wolf-whistling, but Draco could barely hear them over his heart thudding in his ears and, of course, the dulcet tones of his old friend, Scrawny Ginger Muggle.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Come on, Ron, we have been over this… So. Many. Times.”
After that auspicious beginning, Harry reported to his spindly desk in the corner of Malfoy’s office every day, and they attempted to be civil to one another. And every day, Malfoy blared his music. He flatly refused to wear headphones, something about wanting to preserve his hearing into his old age. On the third day, Harry tried asking him to turn the volume down. Malfoy slowly dragged his gaze up from the report he was filling out and fixed Harry with a withering glare.

“Oh?” Harry raised an eyebrow at him, smiling, small and tentative.
“I’m knackered, though,” Draco sighed, pushing his chair back laboriously and straightening with a grunt, threading their fingers together. “You’re going to have to do all the work in bed.”
“Give me the speech,” he said.
“Can I call you Draco?” And he heard
At his words, Harry flushed deeply and curled in on himself with a soft sound of pleasure, and Draco wanted to see that reaction again, so he asked, “You like that? You like hearing what you do to me?” And Harry nodded, rolling his hips and moaning quietly as Draco started to scissor his fingers, stretching him open.
“You alright?” Draco was next to him.
“I think it’s sweet,” Luna offered, smiling serenely.

Laughing gleefully, Harry wheezed out, “Yes, I did! I fucking did! We’re going to Warped Tour!”
. He’d thought the polite distance they had achieved in recent years was enough. But he found himself stopping down in the financial offices on Mondays after the Tornadoes had played and following Malfoy to his seat to eat together when he ran into him in the cafeteria line. The problem was that Malfoy didn’t seem too keen on being Harry’s friend, or at least, not as keen as Harry would like him to be. Malfoy was everything he had been on Christmas—sharp and incisive, witty, surprisingly warm—but just a little bit
He stepped through the floo in his flat, exhausted and ready to throw back a liquid dinner and collapse into bed. Except—there was music playing from the kitchen. Draco felt one moment of sharp, exquisite fear, before his ears processed the sound and he realized he knew the song. He sagged against the mantel in relief, and something else.
“Sap!” Seamus blurted, apparently conscious again, catching Dean’s hand and bringing it to his mouth, mumbling over the knuckles, “You’re such a fucking sap…” Dean smiled softly down at him and Harry felt a twinge in his chest. He wanted to be a sap, really, he wanted it terribly. But he knew it was never going to happen—

Harry made a strangled sound. “Wait a minute—” he choked out, “Are you— are you fucking rickrolling me right now? Are you rickrolling your own marriage proposal?”
Harry snorted. José grimaced apologetically at him, as if he thought he should be embarrassed or offended on Harry's behalf. Draco, spotting José’s distress, very helpfully added, “Don’t worry, José, our dear Harry suffers no shortage of self-confidence. His ego is exactly what you would expect of a World Savior.”
The orange sun hung low in the sky and Molly had just cut the enormous chocolate cake she had baked. The Weasleys had thrown a small party like they did every year, just family and a few friends—casual, intimate. Draco shifted his gaze to Ron standing next to Harry and raised an eyebrow. Ron inclined his head in the barest hint of a nod. Draco cast a
Harry tried to just be happy for Draco, he really did. After all, what kind of shite friend was he if he couldn’t even support Draco because he was too busy feeling sorry for himself?
“Of course not,” Draco yawned, and waving his hand, extinguished the lights and cast a teeth-cleaning charm on both of them. He felt Potter shiver against him in the dark.
“Goldstein still,
Eric rolled his eyes, “I know who are.”
Harry spluttered, “I dated Meg, just last year? And before there was Hamza, and, and Winston—”
The song Draco wakes Harry up by singing his face on their last morning in Big Sur is 'Left Coast Envy' by The Starting Line
Potter nodded. Draco couldn’t stop himself from asking, “Are you really so surprised? I mean, did you think I still hated muggles?” He felt a small twist of sadness in his chest—he knew he couldn’t expect it, but it still hurt never to feel redeemed.
The memory hit him forcefully then, standing in the kitchen looking at Draco swaying in the doorway, half-lidded and happy to be home. Harry crossed the room and drew him into a hug, resting his head against Draco’s chest. He hadn’t thought Draco would die or anything, but still, it wasn’t a pleasant thing to watch your best friend get a hole blown through the side of their torso. “I’m glad you’re home,” he murmured.
Harry skipped the October pub quiz to break up with Oliver. He found himself at Ron and Hermione’s that Saturday, sprawled on the couch after eating far too much takeaway curry and drinking far too much red wine. It hadn’t been that difficult really, calling it off. Oliver was a good bloke and neither of them had gotten too attached—he took it well when Harry said he thought they would be better off as friends, clapping him heartily on the back and wishing him the best.
“Ok,” Harry said again, “What’s romantic, to you?”
On the morning of Ron and Hermione’s wedding, Harry woke up sweating and feverish, weak and nauseous. His first thought was that he had better not be sick on the day he was set to officiate his best friends’ wedding, and that thought sent such a wave of fear and anxiety through his gut that he staggered up, half expecting to heave the contents of his stomach out right there over the edge of his bed.
“No again, sorry,” Harry cuffed him in the shoulder, as Hermione rolled her eyes fondly.
“I do have my own home, you know…”
“A bit stupid! A bit–!” Harry threw his hands up and raked them through his hair, emitting a strangled sort of noise. “Everyone on the team makes fun of me, d’you know that? How fucking desperate I am to get your attention, how much of a fool I’m willing to make of myself,” he laughed again, slightly hysterical. “I thought if I made it so painfully obvious you’d have to crack eventually—I see how you look at me sometimes when you think I’m not paying attention, you know—I thought if I acted absurdly enough you might finally react, and instead I find out you actually deluded yourself into thinking that I’ve just been
“I just—eurgh.” Harry shuddered. “I can’t think about him like that.”
“You utter prick.” Draco pulled out unceremoniously, swinging his legs over the bed and making for the en suite, Harry’s come dripping freely down the inside of his thigh.
“Come on, Harry, when was the last time you dated anyone?”
“I’m going— I’m going to—”
Malfoy laughed delightedly and said, “Do you know, I thought the same thing, but he seemed like a nice bloke otherwise, whereas I’ve a track record of being a judgmental arse, so I was trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.”
Harry walked out onto the deck, shivering in the chill morning air, drawing the robe tighter around him and breathing hot on his fingers. He looked out over the cypress trees and blooming wildflowers dotting the cliffs shrouded in mist. The edges of the coastline disappeared into the heavy pearlescent fog, the ocean and vast horizon stretching out beneath the pale white glow of the morning sky. Harry could smell the salt on the air, cool and damp on his skin, everything silent and still but for the waves crashing on the rocks below, a low, distant rumble.
“Can I touch your jumper?”
“Ok, ok,” Harry waved his hands, flushing, “I’ll allow you a moment to gloat, but I really need your advice!”
“Fuck off,” Harry muttered through a mouthful of sandwich, “I’m going for a shower and change in a bit, pack an overnight bag and some breakfast. Obviously I wasn’t going to leave until the healers got him stabilized and let me in to check on him—”
Harry sent the dishes off to the sink with a lazy flick of his wand.
Draco pressed a kiss to his mouth, dragged his lips along Harry’s jaw, nipping his earlobe. “Take the edge off, yeah? We’ve got—” he rocked his hips and Harry could feel him, hard and pressed against his stomach, “So much time.”
with you?”
Draco allowed himself to be led, still unsteady on his feet, up a flight of stairs and into Harry’s bedroom. He let Harry maneuver him onto the bed, where, still limp, he closed his eyes as Harry undressed him slowly, lifting each of his limbs in turn as he divested Draco of his clothing piece by piece. Draco finally fluttered his eyes open when he felt Harry move off the bed, and he watched as Harry stripped himself equally slowly, staring at Draco the whole time, intent, hungry.
“Yes, I swear it,” Draco laughed, “Merlin, you’re a public menace, you know that?”
phase,” he grabbed one of the various bottles of champagne bobbing in the air around their heads and topped off Harry’s flute.
ice prince mood, dressing all in gunmetal grey and gauzy silver, silver-glittering eyelids and cheekbones to match. Even his hair, swept severely to the side, had a slight iridescent shimmer. Harry had noticed the eyes on him all night, from the moment they stepped off Sirius’ motorbike outside the venue. He had swelled a little, walking beside Draco, slinging a friendly arm around his slim waist. It always put a bit of swagger in his step, chumming it up with the best-looking bloke in the room—even if they were only friends, even if he was maybe a little biased about just how good-looking Draco was.
“Er, no… sorry…”
“What sort of music do you like, anyways? Not that I’ll be persuaded to play it, but…” Malfoy shrugged.
Draco considered him for a moment—his gaze was trained desperately on the bar and he was blushing furiously, the tendons on the inside of his wrists standing out.
Harry snorted. “Hate to break it to you, mate, but that glass of wine is bad for your health.”
“Yes,” said Harry. He threw some money on the table and got up, wobbly on his feet, reaching out for Malfoy’s arm.
Over the next week, though, thoughts of Draco wouldn’t leave him alone. At work, he found himself staring at Draco’s hands. Out at a site, he couldn’t tear his eyes away from Draco’s long, dexterous fingers, bony knuckles flexing as he plucked at the threads of a curse. When they got home at the end of the day and Draco cracked open a bottle of beer, bringing it to his mouth with a low hum of pleasure, Harry found himself distracted by the way his snakebites scraped against the lip of the bottle, wondering how they would feel grazing up the underside of his cock. When they parted ways in the hallway before going to bed, Harry was possessed by the mad urge to invite Draco into the master suite, brush their teeth side by side in front of the double vanity, crawl under the covers together.
“Harry,” Hermione said, “It’s going to be best case. Draco already loves you, even if he’s farther behind than you are on seeing it.” She sounded so earnest, so sure, Harry wanted desperately to believe her.
Harry went to collect Draco on Saturday. He wasn’t well enough to apparate or floo yet, so Harry took Sirius’ old motorbike, which he knew would make Draco happy. Draco loved the motorbike; he said it made him feel like a muggle flirting with death, except Harry always cast extra-strength protection charms on them whenever they rode it. It was bitterly cold, but they took the roundabout way home, cheeks stinging. Back at Grimmauld, Harry packed Draco a fat bowl and sent him up for a hot bath, ordering takeaway while he waited. He puttered around the kitchen aimlessly until Draco trailed in, baked and bleary-eyed, smiling in exhausted contentment and wearing his old Green Day sweatshirt. Harry loved that sweatshirt. Draco had gotten it when the two of them went to see Green Day at Wembley Arena, a couple weeks before his birthday that first summer that they’d been friends. Harry had just gotten his ears pierced, and Ron had laughed at him in an affectionate sort of way, and Ginny had said approvingly that it was an effective way of letting everyone know that he was definitely never going back to the Aurors. Draco had told him he looked like Billie Joe Armstrong,
“You came,” Harry said. His voice was pained, low and rough. Draco had already forgotten everything he was going to say.
. But anyways, the idea is you trick people into showing them the music video for the song, or playing it when people don’t expect it, or whatever.”
“How sure are you?” He asked very quietly.
Harry nodded. “I think so too. But we’ve got everything else. So we could… cultivate it?”
. With a muttered spell, Harry’s hand was slick and dripping, and when he curled his fingers around Draco’s length he had to grit his teeth and squeeze his eyes shut to keep from coming right then. He withdrew his fingers, cradling Harry’s hips, and their eyes met. Draco felt pinned to the chair with the force of his arousal. And then Harry shifted forwards, positioning himself over Draco’s cock and sinking down on a sharp, broken moan. And they were kissing again, Draco’s hands roaming over Harry’s back and tangling in his hair, Harry clutching his face and moaning into his mouth.
“Did you think about it? I know you did, I want to know— I want to know what you thought about—”
Draco’s face went soft for a moment and he twisted his fingers together over the thin, scratchy blanket. “Thanks,” he said, accepting the glass and gulping down half of it in one. When he emerged, he eyed Harry up and down.
Malfoy grinned, gesturing at his speakers. “Let’s start with Blink-182.”
Draco was squished up against Harry's side, crowded around a sticky table in a grimy muggle pub, flipping through a binder of equally sticky clear plastic sheets. Pansy had dragged them out for karaoke; she and Ginny had their heads together, writing their names down on a scrap of paper for whatever song they were signing up for. Hermione, who had started the whole thing by explaining to
“Yes, but—” Draco snapped his teeth shut, refusing to let the words
Hermione gazed steadily at him for a moment. “Because you actually fancy him,” she said sadly.
Harry blinked; his lips parted in surprise. Then he smiled, slow and sneaky, like he had Draco right where he wanted him, which, Draco supposed (cursing himself internally), he probably did.
Draco flushed further, and surely it was criminal to blush that prettily and frequently, and in that outfit no less—Harry was an Auror, maybe he could bring Draco in for disturbing the peace…? he did have those muggle handcuffs…
“Come around then,” Malfoy strode out from behind the counter, beckoning Harry into his seat. “Make yourself at home and I’ll close up.”
“Harry?” Malfoy had appeared directly in front of him, frowning concernedly. “Are you alright? I was going to say you can call me Draco, but I don’t want to trigger an aneurysm.”
? When had he ever thought that was the best course of action?
Draco held up a silencing finger, “You just love us all so much, your dearest friends, the lights in your otherwise dim life, the very reason you get out of bed every morning to face the day—”
“Oh no,” Draco cut in, “Absolutely not—Harry, you are
By the time Malfoy had swept the last surface and secured the blinds, Harry was starting to feel a pleasant tingling radiating from the base of his skull, down his spine, and out into his limbs. He blinked, looking at Malfoy across the shop with what he hoped was a normal, pleasant smile. He wanted to be smiling, since he felt fantastic and he wanted Malfoy to know that; but alas, he felt
“Oh, Potter, it would be my absolute pleasure to tell you what to do,” he murmured, and then they were kissing again, and Draco was walking Potter backwards down the hallway and into his bedroom. And his head was spinning, and he couldn’t quite believe this was happening, and all of a sudden Potter was naked and laid out on his bed looking up at him like any number of Draco’s recent fantasies come to life and it was all so improbable he couldn’t help it, he started giggling. And then Potter was laughing too, and Draco collapsed on top of him and their limbs tangled and Potter flipped them so he was on top, panting and grinning down at Draco, and he wondered for a moment that it was so
Draco ran a hand through his hair, looking harassed. “Of course I didn’t, because it was bloody ridiculous—”
It was well past close at the Ministry on a Friday and the Unspeakables in the Time Department were working late yet again. It had been a shite day capping off a shite week and Draco really didn’t have the patience for whatever tedious, bullshit request surely awaited within this blasted memo. His eyes flickered over the page and he froze, clearing his throat before he spoke.
“To be fair, though, you never once thought that about yourself either, so maybe you’re not the best judge…” Ron smirked.
Harry caught his wrists and held them to the bed. He wanted to do everything—
“Lemon bars?”
“Can I—?" Harry couldn’t finish the thought; all his awareness was throbbing around the feel of Malfoy’s hair in his hand. But then Malfoy said
“What do you—” Malfoy closed his eyes for a moment, cleared his throat. “What do you mean?”
Potter’s eyes widened. “Here?”
would have asked, if I hadn’t distracted you so successfully, is what made you bring it up? After all this time?”
“Oh my GOD!” Ron bellowed, slamming a hand on the table, “All those things the universe lined up for you—you’re welcome, by the way—and it’s actually down to some blokes with spiky hair whinging about their feelings?”
Draco wrote it down for him and followed Harry to the door, crowding him up against it, running a knuckle along his jaw and tipping his chin up for a kiss. “Don’t be late, or I’ll be
“I mean it,” Harry said, “I never said that; those were Ron’s words, he’s drunk you know—” He ran a hand through his hair. “I didn’t say that; I just said that it was a bit… messy. Which it was!” he finished plaintively.
José fidgeted in the doorway, eyes darting to Draco, clearing his throat.
By the time their names were called, Draco was properly sozzled and more than ready to unleash the Rihanna impression he had been working on in the shower since the year 2005. Harry grinned at him as they clambered up, handing over a microphone and winking.
Hermione whacked him with her napkin.
Harry’s hand tightened around his quill and he shifted in his seat, “I mean, I like music when I hear it, but I never really… got into anything in particular, you know?”
, but he had let his hair loose so it hung around his face, grazing his jaw, and Harry was finding it increasingly difficult to think about anything other than twisting his fingers through those luminous strands.
“You’re in luck Potter,” Draco pronounced, “As I have extensive experience dealing with the expectations of people who assumed I would marry a woman and beget a brood of little pureblood babies.”

He swiveled around to see a man smiling at him. He had a friendly-looking face, all freckles and crinkly hazel eyes. Harry considered him. Maybe this was just what he needed.
“Yes—can I come through?”
“What’s all this?” he asked weakly, gesturing at the table.
Draco nodded, heading toward the refrigerator. They had the hangover routine down pat by now—Harry cooked something terribly unhealthy and Draco made a smoothie loaded with fresh fruit—a habit he had brought back from California, an attempt at nutrition and hydration.
Draco rolled his eyes. It was his last weekend paying for all of Harry’s drinks since the Quidditch Camp Gala. Only their friends in the audience even knew about
On Friday, Draco woke him up by blasting
Malfoy was quicker, and Harry watched him take the first bite, parting his lips, welcoming the succulent pastry into the darkness of his mouth.
“My friends call me Harry.”
“I don’t really want to talk about it,” he said. Ron’s eyebrows shot up and Hermione frowned and opened her mouth in a way that Harry just knew meant a question he didn’t want to answer was coming; he held up his hand to stop her. “It’s nothing, just, we were drunk, and I—” he rubbed the back of his neck, “I’m not sure,” he said honestly, “it’s a bit of a mess.” Hermione nodded and asked a question about the muggle bars and Harry took a sip of wine and thought about Malfoy’s low voice asking him,
