“Oh hello, Potter,” Malfoy says as an afterthought after seeing Harry propped up on the stool behind the counter. “Working hard, I see,” he smirks.
“Not to my knowledge,” Harry said. “Sirius,” he paused as the dull throb of saying his Godfather’s name passed, “the generous benefactor of this house, was the last Black. According to him, anyway.”
? Being an Auror really is ageing him prematurely, he thinks. Or maybe it’s being an entrepreneur? Probably both.
Draco scowled. “All of it’s mine, according to your friend over there,” he said in a low voice, jerking his head towards the portrait of Walburga.
“Anyway,” said Ron, clearly trying to change the subject, “maybe Malfoy doesn’t want to talk about it yet.”
“How many espresso martinis, Katie?” he asks, grabbing her arm and pulling her up like a rag doll. She immediately sinks her head back onto Malfoy’s shoulder and looks blearily at Harry.
Katie, his seventeen year old barista, darts around the shop floor, levitating stacks of coffee cups and side plates, whilst absentmindedly wiping the tables with a rag by hand. Although Harry likes all of his staff members, Katie Cresswell is by far his favourite. She is hard working and diligent, and always there to pull the extra shifts when necessary.
The fact was, Draco had stewed about this issue for the better part of two years. Unlike Harry Potter, Draco was, even in 2008, surprisingly self-introspective. That also meant he was prone to suppressing his feelings. The problem was, he’d never felt as awfully out of control as he did in that moment.
This is what life is now, Harry supposes as he runs his hands through his hair under the comforting jet of hot water. At least during his years of being in mortal peril he could do something about the near-constant anxiety and fear. Now he just dreams about those times with no ability to make the seemingly endless loop of memories stop. There’s next to nothing he can do about the nightmares and the sleep deprivation, but they’re things that he has unwillingly accepted are likely to accompany him to the grave.
Harry wasn’t quite sure where the issue lay. So instead he just threw caution to the wind and made the best assumption he could have, given the circumstances.
From time to time, Harry Potter admitted to himself that there were perks to being the youngest Head of the Auror office in over a century. Unfortunately, the Ministry of Magic Christmas party of 2008 was not one of those times. As soon as he had shed himself of his cloak and stepped into the Ministry’s dedicated event space, he had realised that the night would inevitably be full of compliments regarding his recent appointment, to which he would unintentionally respond in such an awkward fashion that he wished he could
The next Saturday, at an obscenely early hour, Harry rifles through his clothes desperately trying to find something visually pleasing.
Harry groaned. He was finding this painfully difficult, and he had a sneaking suspicion Draco knew what he was getting at was just goading him into it, like usual.
"A double shot evil with a side of snob," she says, sarcasm rich in her voice. When Harry doesn't reply, she says "an Ethiopian blend soy latte. Whats it to you?"
“Well, I know you’ve got that weird thing where you need to know where he is all the time, but after last night…” Ron trailed off, looking at Harry as though he was a tyrannical workaholic. Given how little Harry had professionally achieved that day, nothing could have been further from the truth.
She turns to face him. "Look. We all have our vices, right? Yours is working a million hours a week and mine is having a cigarette every now and again." Her face is friendly but her tone says
The thought that he could have enjoyed more than three months of an extremely normal, clandestine, quasi-relationship with his former-school-enemy-turned-passionate-lover was really too much to ask of the universe.
“Hey!” Harry protested hotly, feeling as if his loyalty had been unfairly brought into question. “You’re the one who keeps prattling on about how good-looking they are.”
"That’s an inappropriate workplace comment," she snaps back, but Harry can see a small smile on her lips.
"Do you mind if I get back to these then?" the cool voice replies, gesturing to the pile of papers next to him.
Grabbing his Firebolt that sat on a rack below Ron’s matching one, he pulled out the two brooms and a small black box containing a snitch.
in the soft, white bed and deliciously warm on top of him? Were his usually compliant post traumatic stress related tendencies really rearing their ugly head when he would otherwise be revelling in the fact that Draco-bloody-Malfoy’s tongue was doing unspeakable things in his mouth and his heart felt simultaneously so full and warm and like it might spontaneously burst out of his chest?
Harry sees Malfoy check his watch. It’s a nice watch, Harry thinks, but it catches his attention mostly because it is a muggle watch. Malfoy using muggle things? The world really was going mad.
In usual Harry fashion, his brain leaps to fifty different conclusions, most of them arousing various levels of suspicion. He isn't sure why he's suddenly so nervous about this turn of events. Maybe, he thinks somewhere in his racing mind, its the after effect of having not seen this particular person in over six years. Not since the battle of Hogwarts. Not since Harry had, quite literally, saved his life. Harry had testified at the trials of course, but he had been called to testify during the amalgamated sentencing hearings, before any of the defendants had actually been presented to face their fate.
“Yes, but literally every other witch and wizard reads it mate,” Ron said, exasperation lacing his tone, “including the hundred odd people who would have walked through the atrium with you this morning, then the ten or so in the lift. Jenkins, in the office down the hall always has it open on his desk when you walk into the headquarters-”
“Why didn’t you tell me you owned this coffee shop, Potter?” Malfoy asks in his infuriatingly relaxed drawl and Harry is quite put off by that question because in all honesty he isn’t quite sure why.
Malfoy simply waves his hand to the exposed table next to him and doesn't look up from the stack of parchment he's reading.
“I do apologise for interrupting,” Draco said, completely unapologetically, over the mumble that spilled out of Potter's mouth. Potter turned slightly to face him, as if to question his authority to speak over the boy-that-lived, but really, at what point in time had Draco Malfoy ever cared about Harry Potter's authority? Perhaps only once, and that was beneficial in getting himself a pardon from Azkaban.
Harry streaked into a dive and collected the small, black receptacle and tucked it back into his pocket. “Lost your touch?” he yelled over his shoulder.
At one point Ron grabs him and pulls him into a tight hug and tells Harry that he’s the best friend he’s ever had and Harry laughs and leans into it but really feels like he wants to cry because he’s a bit drunk and has been fretting about losing track of his best friends for years. They're all growing up and getting married and for
Malfoy,” he finishes, then immediately frowns as he realises his parents appear to have followed similar naming conventions.
“Because I needed to,” Malfoy says, in a way that makes it clear he doesn’t want to explain any further.
“Slimy git,” says Ron, who evidently hasn’t reviewed his choice of insults since Hogwarts. “What’s his business in a muggle cafe?”
"Alright there butter fingers?" he hears Katie say, but he only half registers it. He definitely doesn't turn to reply. He has no time to think about anything else because in that moment his heart leaps to his chest in a moment of panic as he recognises the back of the head of someone he never, in a million years would have thought would enter his muggle-inspired cafe.
“Because he’s a regular and that’s what my mandated invite list includes!” Katie says, with exasperation.
Malfoy snorts. “Well Potter, when a civilisation has been brought to the brink of destruction, the powers that be generally need an injection of funds.”
Harry has to concede that he does not. He hasn’t, in recent memory, ever bothered to exchange his galleons for pounds, because he has no reason to. He lives almost exclusively in wizarding England, and for some reason, Malfoy doesn’t seem to be doing the same.
It got to the point where Draco Malfoy felt so hopeless about the entire situation he considered just changing it. Acting on instinct. Taking risks.
“Is this offer conditional or did you actually manage to get permission from the Department to hire someone like me?” Malfoy smirked, although he looked slightly off-centre.
It was halfway through the couch dinner when Hermione finally addressed the elephant in the room. It was lucky she did, Harry reflected, because he and Ron were possibly the two least likely people on the planet to discuss their feelings.
Harry sighs. She's not wrong. He rests his head against the wall and shuffles himself into a more comfortable position on the hard stool.
"I work here," Harry says. He's not sure why he didn't say something impressive like "I own this place," which would be true and would also make him look like less of an idiot, but the moment has passed and he just lingers.
Hermione said nothing, but pursed her lips slightly. Harry knew this tactic well. It was a ploy to keep him talking.
“RonandHermione’s,” Harry mumbled, almost incoherently. He moaned softly as Draco bit down lightly on the sensitive spot on his neck.
Cursing Meldrid for her love of the Mauritian blend, Harry levitates the dirty dishes from table ten before heading to the storeroom to get more of the coffee beans.
“Not like that you idiot,” Draco continued, feeling Harry’s tenseness, “I just mean that you’re not from a pureblood family. Ensuring the continuation of the genetic line isn’t your
was quite frankly a crime. He wondered whether Malfoy had forgotten to tell him that his second cousins were also vision impaired.
When they finally pulled apart, Draco’s eyes smouldered in the dark as he looked Harry up and down appraisingly.  “I’m here every Friday night, you twit.”
Harry also wonders how his rubbish sleep is going to make him feel later tonight, when he’s hopefully seven glasses deep in elf-made wine. It’s with this thought that his stomach lurches a tiny bit and he wonders if he really has developed the ability to predict his own hangovers. Then he realises it’s because he’s remembered that Katie decided to invite his sworn-enemy to his Christmas party. One that’s annoyingly well dressed, and despite Harry’s hopes, could actually decide to show up.
“You complete idiot, Harry, you’re going to catch a cold,” Hermione had chastised as she pulled him inside, out of the rain and blasted him with a drying charm.
"Harry, would you mind grabbing another, it's awfully popular today," she says, now tapping the cylinder towards herself to get the last of the grind out.
When he makes it to the bench however, he stops dead. He almost forgets about the packets of beans in his hands. One actually drops to the floor.
He isn’t sure why he makes the decision to partake in that unusual form of self-flagellation, but surprisingly he actually does feel better for it after he takes a second shower, eats a relatively healthy breakfast (which doesn’t include four sausages and white bread slathered with butter
“I suppose so,” Harry agreed, face still in his hands. “But how many direct orders have we disobeyed in our lifetimes, Ron?”
Exhaling slowly he turned to face Malfoy, almost involuntarily taking one of his hands with his own.
“You should quit,” she says, in a matter-of-fact way. “Find a new job with better work-life balance. I’ll hire you.”
“On a serious note, Potter,” Draco said, arching an eyebrow again, “do you not think it’s somewhat problematic that I’m a reformed blood purist and you are...well,
One huge benefit to living in a rural wizarding village and not in the middle of London, Harry thought as he kicked off the ground and felt the familiar rush, was that you could just get on a broomstick whenever you pleased. You didn’t need to stash your broomstick at your best friend’s house and apparate there to use it.
Harry momentarily lost his ability to think. He leant in, intoxicated by the closeness and touched his lips briefly against Draco’s, testing his luck.
of all places. It’s a perfectly ordinary thing for Malfoy to be doing and you’d be best just forgetting all about-”
“You weren’t at work today, though,” Harry said, reaching out to brush imaginary lint from Draco’s cashmere-clad shoulder as if he couldn’t bear to break contact, “and I sort of assumed that-”
“Believe it or not, your mild disappointment pales in comparison to the difficulty of forcing three Aurors into witness protection, Malfoy,” Harry retorted, waves of hot irritation washing over him. It was so
in the air, all sinewy muscle and sleek blond hair. It was almost a shame to beat him. Practically speaking through, Harry had always been a more skilful flier. Plus, the Nimbus was never going to be a serious match for the newest edition of the Firebolt.
“Yes, but it’s courtesy to send condolences when someone passes away, Ronald,” Hermione said in a way that said
He scours the shelves for a good two minutes before he remembers he can actually do magic, and accio-ing the Mauritian and Ethiopian blend, he grabs both black packets and hurries back out to the front of house.
The blond hair is slightly messier, slightly less perfect than he recollects. The clothes however, black on black, on more black, are exactly what he expects. The fine, thin limbs and tall stature are the cherry on the top. There's no mistaking it. Draco Malfoy is in his shop.
Not least by Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy who, Harry guessed, probably hadn’t been informed that their son had engaged in precisely six storage-cupboard trysts with him that week.
Harry takes a breath. He hopes it builds the suspense. “Draco Malfoy,” he says. To his credit, Ron looks intrigued.
“You were nothing but horrible to me, Draco,” Hermione said evenly, “but I’d still be sorry if you died.”
“Ouch!” Harry complained, ducking for cover. “If you want to dish it out, you need to be able to take it.”
“I’m the last one,” Draco said, almost at a whisper. It was as if the tapestry had put him under some kind of enchantment. Harry glanced surreptitiously over his shoulder to make sure the sleep-inducing music box had definitely been thrown out during the Molly Weasley purge of 1995.
Harry smiled in spite of himself. “You didn’t know this apartment had lighting?” he asked, playfully.
Draco turned his head to face him. “No, you halfwit,” he said, rolling his eyes. “Don’t you think it’s somewhat problematic that I’m supposed to be copulating with a rich, pureblood witch, but instead I’m obsessed with the idea of sleeping with you?”
"No," Harry says, and then thinks about it again. Would he like Draco Malfoy to leave? It is obviously uncomfortable having him there, but then again, Harry has always liked keeping tabs on Malfoy, and from here it would be easy to see what he was up to. A tiny part of Harry's brain also wonders how many people have asked Malfoy over the years to go away. The thought makes Harry feel slightly guilty.
“Hermione wants that new cookbook and perfume set by Gwenog Jones,” Ginny says, pointing at a lurid green hardback on the shelf of Flourish and Blotts which is accompanied by an equally eye catching glass bottle.
whimpered, refusing to let go. Draco’s lips, deliciously red and swollen, smirked as he grabbed Harry’s wrist again, this time less gently, and pulled away from the wall.
"Well," he says slightly tersely, looking for a way to escape the situation which his curiosity has created, "I hope they're not as tedious as they look."
Harry opens and closes his mouth like a trout. At some point he manages to splutter at her, “I’m not gay!”
doing the urgent tasks which were piling up on his desk. He had taken multiple trips past Draco’s office (to no avail) and had been obsessively checking for interoffice memos. He had avoided talking to anyone else lest they realise how tense he was, but he was just about ready to open an investigation. Harry hadn’t remembered being this interested in anyone’s movements since his sixth year, but then again, that also involved an irritating, blond bastard and maybe the world (or Harry’s world at least) really did revolve around Draco Malfoy.
“Yeah, right, I should probably um-” Harry replies, a little flustered because he should have thought of that earlier but he actually quite likes sitting in the Gallardo and weirdly, talking to Malfoy.
He didn't go looking for Potter, he swore to himself. Potter found him, as he usually did, although it was somewhat strange that it was Draco's feet moving, and Potter's that were stationary. To Draco, it seemed that Potter was forever
"You must have made a good one," Harry says smirking. The old lady who frequents his cafe always had a thing or two to say about the quality of her coffee, despite asking for a quarter shot cappuccino with milk so hot it needs to be burnt twice over.
Harry’s face burns slightly at the accusation (albeit true) and the oddly jarring use of his first name.
“Ron, don’t be immature,” Hermione chastised, evidently disappointed at the interruption to Harry’s monologue.
“Hey,” he asked, spinning his broom around so they faced each other. “Would you say this is a date?”
“You don’t know what it’s like,” Draco sighed, flopping his head back onto the backrest. Thin strands of blonde hair splayed out over the fabric. “Being tasked to produce an heir and being the way that I am…”
doing this weekend,” he complained, stretching his other leg to sit comfortably against Harry’s thigh.
, anyway. To be fair, Draco had never had a friend close enough to impart one’s darkest secrets to. It wasn’t a very Slytherin trait to speak with such candour.
Draco forcefully smiled. He rarely ever smiled, and he envisioned the strained version of his least-favourite expression being hardly welcoming. Good. If he repulsed enough people with his display of clearly faked kindness, perhaps he could negate the people-attracting aura Potter seemed to exude.
“You put your house under Fidelius?” he asked, and Harry was satisfied to hear an inkling of admiration in his voice.
“That’s because he’s a slimy git,” Ron chuckled, grabbing his field bag from the table. “See you later, Harry.”
photographer snapping pictures of them while they look at new broomsticks, Harry is having a good time. He doesn't even mind when Ginny goads them on by kissing him on the cheek in full view of everyone and the shutter clicks ominously from behind him.
“It’s always been my specialty,” Malfoy retorts, but there’s no malice in his tone. He looks at Harry appraisingly. “Why are you talking to me?”
Harry wasn’t completely sure of the events that precipitated the return to his bedroom, but he wasn’t complaining. The tea, along with any mention of Draco’s foreign second cousins, had  been well and truly forgotten as they had lost themselves again in the peaks and valleys of Harry’s sheets until they’d wound up so exhausted and sweaty that Draco insisted the he
“It’s ok,” Draco sniffed, cutting over Harry’s attempt at addressing the delicate situation. His lips touched Harry’s briefly again as one hand encircled Harry’s left wrist.
“So we’ve suffered through an entire year of ranting, raving and general discussion about Draco Malfoy for absolutely no reason?” Ron asked as he picked up his badge which was suspiciously placed right next to where he had gotten his bag not five minutes earlier.
Harry’s hands ball into fists at his sides, the spark of indignation well and truly lit. If there is one thing Draco Malfoy does very well, his subconscious reasons, it is hitting all of Harry’s buttons until one of them breaks.
“Nothing,” Draco said simply, expectantly, as Harry’s consciousness suddenly registered that it needed to quickly change tact and think of something,
Harry was prepared to deal with an irritated reporter when he stalked down the hall to find office number seven. He wasn’t prepared for Draco Malfoy.
Draco spied the Nimbus and raised an eyebrow. “I didn’t realise you wanted a full re-enactment, Harry. I would have worn more green.”
Levi just chuckles and goes about putting together the order by whizzing ingredients from various parts of the pokey kitchen. Harry catches the carrots and puts them down on the bench as he makes his way down to the back of the shop.
Katie is looking more flustered by the minute and if he's not mistaken, three cylinders of coffee need refilling. Katie shakes the Mauritian blend and frowns, flicking the tab more violently towards herself.
He watches Malfoy walk a little further down Moscow Road before ducking into an alleyway and mercifully ending up in one piece on the front step of Grimmauld Place.
“I wasn’t sure what to write,” Harry replied, feeling a bit stupid. He shrugged at Ron and Ron shrugged back, making Harry feel that perhaps he wasn’t alone in not knowing what to say when someone you didn’t particularly like packed it in but you just happened to be in love with their offspring. Such a circumstance required a very bespoke condolence letter Harry thought, and he had no idea how to even start one.
Harry balks. He has half a mind to tell Katie where to shove the coffee on her person and go and do the dirty work herself, but he also doesn't want to appear afraid of Malfoy. She catches him staring.
The uncomfortable thing was how Draco felt about Harry Potter, which was definitely not aligned with his usual proclivity for self preservation.
Harry remembers that he threw Ron under the metaphorical bus this morning and feels as though he should back him up, even if he’s wrong. “I guess I should have mentioned that,” he says, and Ron does a minuscule nod of his head.
Harry snorts, “don’t have a pity party Malfoy, you’re bloody lucky to have escaped Azkaban and besides, no one ever
kind of stuff,” Harry started, “I mean aside from the one time I spontaneously told him that I was in love with him.”
“Would you like me to change the topic?” Harry asked, grinning broadly. He was enjoying himself, but he felt that he probably ought to avoid
She looked at the blini uncertainly, and then frowned at him. “I’ll come back with something more suitable.”
Harry was tempted to say something very lovesick, but somehow avoided total embarrassment. He swore sometimes his brain told his mouth to say something, and the words got lost on the way there and came out totally differently.
"Christmas has got to be the worst time of year," she sighs, scrougifying the foam wand. "Meldrid came in again today you know, and I think this time she only sent her coffee back twice."
“I’m sure you do, Potter, but I’m going to have to insist that you take care of that horrid morning breath first.”
Harry pretended to consider this for a second before leaning in himself. “I happen to know someone with an ugly scar on their forehead,” he said, “but they don’t like to share.”
“No,” Harry replied, smirking as Draco’s frown deepened and he flipped to look at the cover of the book. Upon reading the title, he quickly thrust the book back onto the bookshelf as if it had spontaneously burst into flames.
“I just,” he started, voice ragged and out of breath. “I just wanted to make sure you were okay and-”
Draco cocked an eyebrow at Harry’s face, which must have reflected some element of the frustration he was feeling. His body felt electrified with the closeness and the soft, pitifully brief kiss that Draco brushed against his lips just wasn’t going to cut it. Harry’s hand snaked its hand around the waistband of Draco’s dark wash jeans and, finding the small of his back, pulled his body closer.
Ginny doesn’t bother to notice Harry’s emotional turmoil, as she moves to tap the brick in the wall. “Wait,” he says, coming back to his senses and pulling two flasks from his cloak. He tosses one to her. “To avoid being harassed during the busiest shopping period of the year?”
The thing is, despite the inquisitive stares and the occasional autograph requests, it really isn’t that bad, Harry thinks. In fact, despite catching a
“I don’t really want to think about it properly yet,” Draco said, flipping over to lie on his back, grey eyes staring at the ceiling.
“I can un-invite him,” Katie says softly, swiping a cleaning cloth from the bench and picking at it with her fingernails, “if you want.”
“He’s probably keeping tabs on you for something,” Ron says, directing his attention at Harry and ignoring Hermione who is having a minor meltdown. “We should see if he’s there this Saturday.”
“Ron’s not home, just so you know” she said, as if Ron would have been thrilled to see Draco Malfoy there, in the flesh.
He envelops her in a side hug after a few glasses of Odgen’s Finest and promises her a substantial raise he can’t quite deliver on if he thinks about the financials of the business, but knows he will make it work regardless.
“Don’t be thick, Harry,” Malfoy snorted, but his eyes closed in satisfaction from Harry’s gentle touch on his wrist.
Harry struggles to sleep sometimes, especially when the house he lives in creaks like it actually is every bit of its four hundred years. 12 Grimmuld Place isn't exactly what Harry had envisaged living in for his adult life, however the draw of it proved too hard to resist. It harbours memories of his Godfather Harry never wants to give up, and Kreacher's attitude change ever since the war has greatly increased the liveability of the place.
Harry smiled, a little bemused. “I don’t know. Something normal,” he said. “Why are you looking at me like that?”
Harry groaned. Hermione flopped herself down on the couch next to him and flung her arms around his neck.
“I just-” he started, as Draco groaned and intently pressed his lips on the sweet spot near Harry’s clavicle. Harry was well and truly shut up by this and moaned softly instead of finishing his sentence.
“Why don’t you talk to him then, instead of forcing me to,” Harry grumbles as he scribbles down the takings for the day.
In the end, fearing that he may be more emotionally inept than Hermione had ever accused Ron of being, he dropped his quill back into the ink pot and gave in to the mountains of tedious paperwork that he was actually being paid to do. He did question, as he worked, why wizards hadn’t managed to harness the muggle technology of mobile phones. A lot quicker and a lot less formal than owl post.
Instantly, he felt himself relax as the familiar touch and scent and taste of Draco enveloped him and pushed him roughly up against the opposite wall.
As it turned out, it did make a difference. Firstly, because Malfoy simply refused to take the job unless he reported directly to the Department Head, at which point, Harry had considered just withdrawing the offer. The Department held a certain belief that because Harry was taking a risk on a known offender, he should be responsible for managing his conduct.
He has half a mind in the morning to turn up on Malfoy’s front doorstep and ask him if he wants coffee and a hangover potion, but he thinks that could be a bit weird and full on for someone you just tried to make friends with.
They circled the pitch for about an hour, lazily trading insults and occasionally making half hearted attempts to look for the glint of gold. In the end, it was Draco who spied it and spun into a miraculous spiral dive, arm outstretched.
Harry swallowed a chunk of kebab. “You’re not eating it right,” Harry said, “you have to eat it as a whole, not pick it apart like a vulture.”
The whoosh of the steam wand and the fragrant aroma of the Ethiopian Blend greets Harry as he pushes open the door of the cafe. The shop, hidden away from the remainder of Diagon Alley by virtue of it being situated behind the Apothecary, is one of his favourite spots on earth. Somewhere he can hide behind the ivy covered trellises, and become normal; a nobody.
Harry was stunned. The thought of destroying an old mansion which had probably been the home of Malfoy's for centuries was, in his mind, completely reasonable. But he had to admit, from a pureblood perspective it was highly unusual.
“Get in Potter, we’re going to have to put her on your lap,” Malfoy instructs, and Harry is quite honestly too dumbstruck to do anything but comply.
Hermione lifted the broom out of Harry’s left hand and appraised it. “I don’t think I even know where this one came from,” she said, in a concerned way before passing it to Draco who flipped it over between his hands.
“What?” He says, hoping he sounds incredulous but actually sounds like he is choking on an every-flavour-bean.
Draco looked as if Walburga’s voice had literally stolen his own. Harry was briefly convinced that instead of kissing Draco Malfoy that afternoon, he’d be performing mouth to mouth resuscitation.
Well shit, Harry thought. His heart was racing so fast he had forgotten what he was looking for and why he was in this dingy shed listening to what he was sure would be the next wizarding war breaking out behind him.
"Hello?" Katie says, jabbing him in the side with her wand. "You dropped the Mauritian blend, for the fiftieth time."
“Malfoy?” Ron looked slightly stricken. “Bloody hell, it’s a bit harsh to expect him to come to work today, isn’t it?”
Harry actually stopped dead in the hallway at the sight of Malfoy’s office. It was a strange thing to do, since Draco could easily have been doing just about anything else that he usually did at work and just wasn’t, right at that moment, at his desk. But the routine was a crutch for Harry, he would later come to realise. Each movement in the dance was tangible evidence that his feelings were
"Pleasure's all mine," she replies, tossing the tea towel on the bench and scrugifying it, "but I'm still working the coffee, so you can do till and floor."
Had Harry reflected on his internal monologue pertaining to Draco Malfoy’s appearance, he might have described the man as
or whatever other improper iteration of a person I’m being at the moment-” he began as he pulled back to give Draco some breathing space.
Not a lie, strictly speaking. He had looked at the front covers of a few of them over the last three days they had been inhabiting his office. Point is, he has other loose ends to tie up, and the reports wouldn't become a priority until they were within 48 hours of their due date. The due date happens to be a week before the last working day of the year, upon which Harry will likely be stressing about things like Christmas presents and how to convince Molly Weasley he is, in fact, eating enough.
"Yes boss," he smiles. "You okay to open tomorrow? Ron's going to floo in soon, so I can close this up."
“What are you doing, Malfoy?” Harry asks, eyeing off the open briefcase which Malfoy dragged in. He recalls that the employment search came up with no results, but the evidence would suggest Malfoy is definitely working on something. Harry has an insatiable desire to find out what that something may be.
Harry tries to skirt around it, but what he really needs is a personal stylist. Someone who will help him find clothes that he actually cares about, and isn’t afraid to tell him that something makes him look like a cross between Dudley Dursley and a younger and more eccentric Albus Dumbledore.
"How many jobs does someone like yourself need?" Malfoy retorts, then adds, "surely people are falling over each other to give you their first born child, let alone anything else you may need."
“I’m not sleeping with Draco Malfoy!” Harry exclaimed, a bit louder than expected. He really never envisaged he would have ever said that sentence out loud.
Harry looks at her in a way which he hopes comes across as disapproving but probably looks mildly shocked.
On Friday morning he stepped out of the elevators at Level 2, mind already wandering dangerously close to the black hole which was his infatuation with Draco Malfoy. They had established a solid routine of barely acknowledging each other at eight-thirty, trading insults at twelve, making unnecessary trips past each others’ office at four and finally, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, turning up at Harry’s apartment around six to have dinner in a pretence of civility before snogging each other senseless.
for Malfoy. It’s not as if he doesn’t deserve it. “Maybe you just like to annoy me,” he says lamely.
“Drop it, Potter,” Draco snapped. Harry recognised this as Draco effectively compartmentalising. Harry had learned that Draco Malfoy was remarkably good at shutting off things that he didn’t want to address, sort of like an internal version of occlumency.
“Did you do an employment search?” Ron asks Harry while Hermione is finishing her sentence. Harry nods, but tries to turn it into a shake when he sees Hermione’s incredulous face.
“Okay, you’re right,” Harry hears Ron say, and knows the bickering is almost at an end. Hermione eyes him suspiciously over the rim of her tall glass and takes a sip.
“Is he?” Harry asked, genuinely curious. He wasn’t sure how one established relationships in the post-war adult world where your would-be significant other was a war criminal and you were a war hero and so logically, you didn’t tell many people about it.
Harry balks, then he realises he’s still sitting in Malfoy’s car when he could be outside getting himself home.
“You’ve had too much of that ridiculous hot bean juice again, haven’t you?” Ron accuses, narrowing his eyes.
“There’s no way someone as pretentious as you is allergic to caviar, Malfoy,” Potter said, observant to a fault as usual.
“You met her before, in portrait form. Lovely lady, really welcoming,” Harry said, thankful the conversation had turned away from Death Eaters.
“That’s rich, coming from you,” Draco said, snarling a little, “with the amount of things you accused me of doing you must have been keeping a
Harry didn’t end up leaving the cottage until ten thirty and by the time he stepped out of the floo in the kitchen of his apartment he was ready to drag himself to bed. That was until a shadow moved ominously in the darkness and he almost jumped out of his own skin.
“Spare me,” Draco spat, “if the Gryffindor team hadn’t been so pathetic, you never would have got that stupid broom from McGonagall and we all would have been the better for it.”
To add insult to injury Harry thinks, Luciana wasn’t even able to turn up anything on Malfoy’s employment search. The location search indicated that Malfoy was no longer living in Salisbury, Wiltshire (which Harry envisages is probably the location of the Malfoy Manor), but in Bayswater, London. It is hardly going to be a housing downgrade in Bayswater Harry considers, but he has to admit he is surprised in Malfoy’s choice of suburb. Bayswater is very
Harry’s legs carried him forward, sort of their own volition. Running on instinct, he cupped Draco’s jaw in his hand and lifted his head upwards until the blue-grey and slightly bleary eyes were staring into his own green ones.
Harry, given how he interceded on his behalf at the Death Eater trials. Harry knows Slytherins aren’t the most grateful of people, but they know a thing or two about
Harry knew she said that every night. It had probably lost a bit of its meaning by now. He glanced at the clock - 9pm. He yawned. The shift work element of field Auror work was something Harry didn’t miss.
Harry felt Draco stiffen halfway up the stairs as he led the way to the first floor. Probably at the elf heads, Harry thought, although Draco’s reaction was far more muted than the outright horror most people displayed. Harry wondered whether the Malfoy Manor had a collection of elf heads. He couldn’t recall seeing any, but then again, during his first and only visit to the Manor he had been largely preoccupied with not getting killed.
about kissing anyone, let alone actually kissed someone, since he stopped kissing Ginny five years ago.
“Somewhat messy how Aunt Bella killed him, wasn’t it?” Draco mused, completely oblivious to how such a statement might be painful for Harry to consider.
"Didn't know you were a whiz at divination," Katie says drily, then adds somewhat dejectedly, "Martin says he cant come in tomorrow by the way. His little one is still sick."
Ron is halfway through levitating the stack of reports back onto his desk from their previous position on the floor. He narrows his eyes at Harry. “You should learn to wait your turn, Harry. I might have accidentally hexed you.”
“You know, it’s awfully rude to ignore me,” Draco sniffed, breaking Harry’s convoluted train of thought.
. Removing his hand from Draco’s back, he traced his fingers lightly, quickly around the outside of his leg and then, laying his palm flat, up his inner thigh, coming to rest tauntingly close to the zipper.
this new Malfoy with his weird knowledge of muggle pop culture which is admittedly far better than Harry’s.
“I think that room at the far end used to house a Hippogriff,” Harry said, grinning. “I don’t recall you two taking a great liking to each other, but please, be my guest.”
“Not sure,” Harry said hurriedly, evidently not catching on to the fact that Ron’s question had been entirely rhetorical. “Listen, have you seen Draco today?”
Then again, Draco was not the courageous one. He had a habit of sitting back and waiting for things to happen.
. Or, if he was, somehow Draco's eyes found him without being told to. At various points that very night, his eyes had unwillingly found themselves peeled off the wallpaper he was determined to stare at, and drifting over to Potter's location at the back of the room, hidden by the wall-to-wall, sparkly tinsel and being harassed by both important Ministry officials and pushy waiters.
Harry finishes levitating the dishes into their stacked position. "I was thinking about coming in tomorrow myself, actually. Maybe I can step in for him."
Later, Harry tried to write a letter of condolence to send to the Manor by owl. Unfortunately, despite the fact that he had seen far too many people die in the last ten years of his life, Harry really had no clue how to convey his feelings toward loss. Much less the loss of Lucius Malfoy who, in Harry’s honest opinion, wasn’t much of a loss at all.
Draco Malfoy strides into the cafe, hair windswept but otherwise looking inappropriately well put together despite the mild blizzard that is brewing outside. Harry bets Draco Malfoy has a social life. Rich people are always invited to events, Harry imagines, even if they accidentally become part of a failed, murderous plot for worldwide domination.
He stops to catch his breath and sees the lights flicker on a sleek, black sports car to his right. He stares, incredulously at Malfoy who is motioning for him to hurry up.
“Harry!” she said, at a loss for words, gesturing wildly to the mountain of paper covering his desk and floor.
Harry seethes. He owns this cafe! He can sit wherever he bloody well likes! He doesn’t get a chance to retort, however, because Malfoy stalks away towards the back of the cafe to hide in what appears to be his favourite spot amongst the philodendrons. Philodendrons are highly toxic, Harry thinks. Maybe Malfoy will eat one by mistake.
“Spoken like a true addict, Harry,” she says, grinning. “I’ll make a latte for you if you get up off the bench and stop scaring off the customers.”
“Something like that,” Harry said, smiling in spite of himself. He plucked the folded piece of parchment out from the inner pocket and levitated it across to Malfoy’s left hand with a non-verbal incantation.
“Merlin, Harry,” he remarked, the soft, aristocratic sneer edging into his tone. “First you declare your undying love for me before we’ve even kissed, and now you’re asking me to move in with you?”
she could read his mind. There really wasn’t another witch or wizard in this building that Harry could feel entirely comfortable chatting mindlessly to over a questionable canapé.
“I’m not asking you to marry me, Draco,” he joked, but somewhere inside him lurched a little at that thought. “I just needed to tell you. For my own sanity.”
?” Harry asked as the kettle boiled. He had cast a quick warming charm as neither of them had bothered to put the top half of their clothes back on. He swore the kitchen dipped into sub-zero temperatures, even in spring.
They lapse into a comfortable silence and Harry is lulled by the warmth of the heater and the powerful whirr of the cars’ engine as Malfoy carefully steers through the thinning traffic on Theobalds Road and Rosebery Avenue and out towards Stoke Newington. He glances at the clock, it’s almost one, and wonders how everyone managed to get so drunk so early. Everyone except Malfoy, it seems.
“But he is stylish,” Ginny points out, rummaging around in her cloak pocket for her wand with one hand and shaking soot out of her braid with the other. “Besides, I know that not everyone who is gay is stylish. Case-in-point.”
Harry ignores the question, gazing across at the pile of papers stacked up on the table next to Malfoy. "They look as welcoming as the stack I have on my desk at the moment," he says, then realises he's just told Malfoy he works in a cafe and isn't sure if the other man is going to be able to follow his somewhat disorganised thought process.
Malfoy’s brow unfurrows and he cocks an eyebrow. “Have you been analysing my criminal record, Harry?”
“Put the seatbelt over both of you and for the love of God, please don’t do anything that will draw the attention of the good officers of the law or I will be sending the fine to you for payment,” he says, sliding into the drivers’ seat as the car purrs to life pleasantly.
“I can see it now,” she cackles as they haul their considerable amount of shopping bags into Harry’s cafe and find a table. “Bonding over Broomsticks - The Chosen One rekindles old Weasley flame.”
“Marginally better than being marked as a baby to vanquish a powerful, dark wizard,” Harry quipped, eyes transfixed to Draco’s face.
An additional benefit was that he was in the midst of a seemingly futile attempt to make the house liveable. His rooftop flat, despite its obvious allure, had never really felt like home to Harry. 12 Grimmauld Place was more familiar, but Harry had steadfastly avoided trying to make it habitable due to both the painful memory of Sirius that permeated the place and the fact that he was yet to find a way to remove the family tapestry, Walburga’s portrait and the elf heads.
“You’re the one threatening to fire your only barista on a weekend shift,” Katie points out. “That’s fairly dramatic when you don’t know how to use the coffee machine properly.”
They don’t even bother to revisit the reason that Malfoy lives in muggle London, only that he does and he owns a flashy sports car and works in finance. How that happens, Harry hasn’t a clue, but he swiftly puts his fingers in his ears when Malfoy starts talking about taking certain
Hermione looked stricken, no doubt taken aback by the casual references to death even when it related to someone she wasn’t fond of.
It isn’t until he is hugging Ron and Hermione goodbye and Hermione whispers to him that Katie might have had one too many espresso martinis that he comes down off his high and starts worrying about something. Most of the people in the cafe-turned-winter-wonderland have patted him roughly on the back or enveloped him in a hug or (in Ginny’s case) sloppily kissed him again and stumbled out the door into the winter night.
Harry thinks. But he says nothing as Katie once again hands him the soy latte and sends him into the Philodendron lair.
“You didn’t come to hide amongst the curtains to avoid waiters then, Potter?” Draco countered, smirking. “You can thank me later.”
“This is terribly uncouth, Potter,” he drawled, picking at the top of his kebab with his long fingers and sniffing it delicately.
“He bequeathed his only possession to me,” Harry replied. “I think he just didn’t want to give it to anyone else, to be honest.”
“Yes,” Draco replied slowly in way that suggested Harry was a bit thick, “but that has no bearing on the amount of children his aunts and uncles had.”
“Surely, for two Aurors, there are bigger fish to fry than Draco Malfoy being in someone’s cafe!” Hermione exclaims.
“You have to tell me,” he says, taking a sip of his pint and looking up at Malfoy, “why you drive a car, have muggle money, live in Bayswater and know what the bloody
Malfoy could at least show simple niceties to him. After all, there's a good chance that if Harry hadn't chosen to testify at the sentencing hearings, all three Malfoys could be spending their days in prison. In which case, Malfoy wouldn't be able to be annoyingly superior about his suspicious desk job, and file through his precious papers and sit in Harry's coffee shop just to ruin his day.
As he gets closer he can hear the hooded person softly speaking to Katie and her sleepy laughter emanating in reply. She’s quite clearly leaning into the other person, and there’s something about it that looks platonic and supportive and Harry can’t really say why he thinks that but it’s just the overall impression he gets.
“Since when do you smoke?” Harry asks as she pulls a thin packet out of her bag below the back counter.
"Bit out of practice I'm afraid," Harry says ruefully, setting the cleaning charm on the dishes and hurrying to the storeroom to get two more bags of beans.
"Mad rush?" Harry enquires, stepping into the kitchen behind the main counter and flicking his wand at the remaining dishes in the large, commercial sink.
He elects to simply ignore the question and crouches down next to Malfoy’s left knee and Katie’s head which has slowly started to sink down the side of Malfoy’s arm.
Opening a muggle-inspired cafe in the heart of Wizarding England had been a risk, but the business venture, so far, had paid off. The wizarding world had once again returned to their curious infatuation with muggle artefacts, and the coffee he sources from various specialty shops in London is of good enough quality it can coax away even the most ardent butter beer and tea drinkers. The cafe is usually full, and with Christmas shoppers inundating Diagon Alley in December, the business is struggling to keep up with demand.
Harry had heard it was good practice to keep your friends close and your enemies closer and it was similarly good for the Ministry to keep someone as conniving and convincing as Draco Malfoy out of the media industry and under close watch. As an added bonus, Malfoy ended up being extremely good at managing the Department of Magical Law Enforcement’s PR.
To be fair, he had nothing to compare it to. Mostly because Draco Malfoy had never been able to summon enough fucks to give about another human being in a romantic sense. He was, in all reality, a selfish prat. Which meant that the kind of undeniable, irresistible obsession with following Potter’s every move made him so uncomfortable. It was like being hopelessly addicted to something and having no chance of rehabilitation. Harry Potter was just
“Are you finished?” Harry asks, narrowing his eyes, but he can feel the shadow of a smile on his lips anyway and bites into his bottom one to avoid it showing up on his face.
He takes a sip of his beer. It’s cool on his tongue and simultaneously warms his insides as it makes its way down his throat. Maybe he does have an alcohol problem, he thinks, looking down at himself. The beer definitely isn’t doing anything to improve his physique. Temporarily being stuck in the office isn't either. He makes a mental note to research an exercise routine on the new computer he purchased for himself for his last birthday. The internet is a wild place, he thinks.
,” Ron countered, although it was barely audible due to the quantum of dumplings which were occupying Ron’s mouth. Hermione looked mildly disgusted.
to you. I’m drawn to your intelligence and your sarcastic quick wit. I like you even though you’re stuck up and a bloody snob about food and you can’t just sit quietly and eat a kebab on a rooftop like a normal person.”
“They’re not the only problems you’re going to develop,” he heard Draco mutter as he pressed himself against Harry and collected his lips again, hands pinning Harry’s hips to the wall.
Harry ignores her statement. "Why is Malfoy in my shop?" He blurts out, against his better judgment.
Harry, who had admittedly been trying to distract himself with his long-neglected administrative work, cringed at the sight around him. It looked as if he had been playing exploding snap with his reports rather than reading them.
He keeps smiling as he opens the door and walks inside and collapses into bed. He doesn’t have a single nightmare, either.
the back of the cabinet under the machine. “We invited regulars last year! I thought you wanted a repeat of my incredible organisational feat.”
A somewhat surprising reply, Harry thinks. He wasn't expecting it, but then again he wasn't expecting to see Draco Malfoy in his shop either.
Luciana gives him a reprising look and backs out of his cramped office. "Auror Potter," she says, curtly turning on her heel and striding down the corridor.
rooftop with the most unrefined, greasy and delicious kebab in London was something he thought he would never see.
He has half a mind to tell him to leave. What would a former Death Eater want with an establishment like this? Harry half wishes in that moment the shop was as busy as it had been twenty minutes ago, then he feels as if he wouldn't have had the time to be simultaneously stunned and curious as to why Malfoy was currently sitting at table twenty-one and lazily flicking through a stack of papers larger than Harry's report pile at the Ministry.
Utterly intoxicated by the closeness and the intimacy, Harry breathed in the familiar scent of sandalwood and citrus, and pressed a small kiss into the back of Draco’s neck. His nose felt the soft tickle of the tendrils of blonde hair that lay haphazardly across the pillow. Draco sighed softly, evidently still asleep, and wriggled back into Harry’s arms.
Draco, obedient for once, looked up at him, his head resting on Harry’s stomach. “What’s so important?” he whispered, lowering his lips to Harry’s stomach again but somehow maintaining eye contact.
Harry watched, stunned and transfixed, as Walburga’s ugly blanched face contorted into something which Harry presumed was supposed to be adoration. He had certainly never seen such an expression worn by the portrait, nor had he ever heard her be so benign.
Hermione poked her head around his office door and smothered a scream. Never mind Voldemort and a couple of Death Eaters, Harry thought, Hermione’s real worst nightmare was seeing paper being abused.
“So your mother is with your father’s cousins in France,” he repeated, in an effort to stop himself staring in such a lovesick way. “Why?”
Harry watches her with absolute incredulity as she pulls her wand out deftly. “What?” she says, looking up at Harry’s expression.
He totally forgets about the restless anticipation he had been experiencing as he got dressed in his new, properly fitting black jeans, white shirt and emerald cashmere sweater that Ginny forced him to spend too many galleons on. This is his comfortable place and he’s having the most fun he’s probably had since this time last year.
Capitalising on Walburga’s momentary shock he grasped the curtain and wrenched it closed, just as Walburga had begun screeching “Abomination! Shame!” Her words carried off and dissolved into the air as the curtains hung still.
Two months before the auspicious Christmas Party, Harry had turned up on Ron and Hermione’s doorstep. He was completely bedraggled by rain, had just finished an awful day at work and was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
While Hermione and Ron launch into a bickering session that could last until they are all deceased, Harry scans the crowd at the Cornish Arms. They choose the muggle pub routinely because the muggle paraphernalia and exclusively muggle drinks would likely overwhelm any witch or wizard. It is also full of weirdly dressed, young types which help them blend in.
“Well I suppose I am somewhat unattractive compared to them,” he sighed, now staring judgementally at Harry who had summoned the sugar bowl and was lifting multiple spoonfuls of the granules into his tea.
“You really are an idiot,” Draco said. Harry noticed his voice was light but the sad smile still lingered. Harry hated that look. He wanted to kiss it right off his face.
“You still haven’t learnt to play fairly, I see,” he remarked, looking around for the snitch as they turned in parallel to climb higher into the sky.
Table twenty-one is tucked behind an overflowing pot of heart-leaf philodendron which hangs in tendrils from a long shelf which runs the length of the exposed brick wall. Harry potted a lot of the plants himself, and this corner was particularly full of greenery to make up for the lack of a window. Harry can see the appeal of it, being tucked away in a dark corner but having the benefit of seeing everyone else.
“If you insist, I can volunteer to write the weekly Harry Potter trivia questions,” Malfoy said, contemptuously. “I’m sure that’s what you consider to be legitimate reporting.”
The shop has only been closed for five minutes, but it appears there is only one staff member left. Harry knows instinctively who is on clean up.
“I’m not trying to hide you or anything,” he said bluntly. “I’m not, you know, embarrassed if people know we’re…”
They walked down to the small shed at the back of the garden and Harry rifled through the brooms as quickly as he could to avoid Hermione and Draco having to make stilted conversation with each other. He was desperately trying to eavesdrop as he pushed aside three ancient Cleansweep Sevens which went clattering to the ground.
"And don't spend all of your weekend at that cafe again," she continues, "or you'll come back just as sleep deprived as you are now. I know its almost Christmas, but we have to get that lot back to Shacklebolt in just over a week." She points to the mountainous stack of reports in the middle of Harry's disorganised desk.
Harry hasn’t the faintest what that means, but ten minutes after quickly charming the doors locked and walking at an impressively brisk pace through Diagon Alley, out of the Leaky Cauldron and onto the streets of Muggle London, he finds himself chasing Malfoy through a parking garage, who’s inexplicably now carrying Katie in his arms and still managing to walk faster than Harry has ever walked in his life.
“No,” Draco said simply, as he reached his spare hand into his jacket pocket, “I just don’t want to forget.”
“You should learn to sleep more,” she says, prodding his cheek with her finger as he collapses his head onto his hands on the counter top.
“Actually, my strike rate is very good with everyone except you,” Harry said, anticipating the response, “which is why you were my recommendation for this role.” He dropped the paperweight back onto the desk with a flourish.
Harry snorted and then quickly reflected that humour might be slightly inappropriate given the circumstances.
“Oh,” said Draco, conversationally. He picked up a book from Harry’s bookshelf and flipped through the pages casually. His attempt at nonchalance was admirable, Harry thought, but it wasn’t entirely convincing. He evidently hadn’t looked at the cover, for starters. He found Draco enigmatic, but Harry was fairly certain that he wouldn’t be interested in a book entitled: “Good Godric: The History of Gryffindor House.”
Draco looked down at his hands. “Yes, well it’s lucky you didn’t. Who else would have been insane enough to wait for you for hours in your pitch black kitchen?”
part. His brain feels weirdly disconnected from his body which is strange because he stopped drinking at least an hour ago.
,” she wailed, a tear rolling down her cheek. “Finally! A worthy inhabitant of this most noble house! After the years of the blood traitors, mutants and freaks befouling the house of my fathers the
Harry has to agree with her, the old bat has been demanding as ever today, and the shop had only just started to ease up after the mid-morning Saturday rush. He's cleared sixteen tables in the last twenty-five minutes, which is a miracle considering that every single customer, particularly the old ladies, want to stand and have a conversation with him. It's like he's a magnet for people who want to tell him about their garden gnome infestation or ask if the Auror Office has done anything about their neighbour who they believe to be breeding dangerous chimeras but whom Harry knows is really just setting off a set of muggle fireworks.
“Do you know where I live too?!” Harry exclaims, whipping around in a much more terrified way than he intends to.
“I resent that comparison,” Malfoy said, shooting him a glare. “And you have sauce on your lip. If anyone is an animal here it isn’t me.”
It was lucky he never told Draco about the Marauders Map, Harry thought. He might have been somewhat put off to learn just how much time Harry had spent watching the D. Malfoy dot trail up and down the corridors.
“It’s a muggle thing,” she says flippantly, “Mum and Dad became obsessed with them in Australia. Terrible for your teeth, apparently.”
“Hurry up Potter,” Malfoy growls as Harry struggles to keep up with the pace. Why Malfoy walks like he’s in a professional competition is baffling, Harry thinks. Normal people just don’t
“It was his own fault, Harry,” Ron said, appearing on the bottom step of the spiral staircase. “He knew that head office hadn’t authorised it and he did it anyway.”
Harry had never seriously believed that years of smoking could actually make one cough up a lung. But he swore that Draco Malfoy almost did. It was the most uncivilised coughing fit Harry had ever seen. Harry thought it was deliciously unrefined.
“Nothing,” Ginny and Katie reply together. They smirk conspiratorially though and it’s deeply unsettling, Harry thinks.
Draco looked back at him. There was a small quirk of an eyebrow and Harry held out his hand which Draco took and allowed himself to be drawn back to the top of the bed.
He gets passed around from person to person, group to group, steadily getting more wasted and having more and more fun. At one point someone breaks into a random chorus of 'Happy Birthday' and everyone joins in and puts 'Harry' in the space where you’re supposed to say the birthday person’s name. Harry has half a mind to tell them it should be 'Jesus' instead because, although he isn’t a religious person, they’re either a solid five months too late or seven months too early.
“If you must know, this is how I live now,” he says, grey eyes staring determinedly at the table, “since the Ministry made me an outcast.”
The first thing that registers with Harry is that Malfoy has a very nice tongue. It's a strange thing to think about a person, but it
“Yes, the Benedict,” he says without a second thought and uses his wand to tick the two orders and flicks it back toward the kitchen.
Draco snorted derisively. “She was far smarter than you before you ever got on a broomstick, Potter,” he said. “I’ve never seen Hermione’s potion work literally crawl away from her, and that’s more than I can say for you.”
“Potter, can you please focus on making sure she doesn’t get a neck injury, or worse?” Malfoy hisses and Harry notices that Katie’s head is wobbling precariously off the side of his shoulder. “I’d ask you to do a sobriety charm, but those things are hell, so the very least you can do is make sure we don’t accidentally kill her.”
Harry regrets trying to look so casual. “Kingsley,” he says, straightening up as the tall man rounds the corner. “Ron and I were just discussing our reports.”
Harry’s face flushed at the insult. Those “facts” were barely true, at best. He had a sneaking suspicion Draco Malfoy had been writing them for years. It would certainly explain how half of Wizarding England believed he had a nipple piercing.
“No, don’t do that,” he says, sighing as he lowers himself onto the familiar wooden stool. One of his knees cracks, ominously.
Draco dropped his hand immediately and scowled. “I think you should go back to the part where you compliment me.”
Harry isn’t quite sure where the time goes but all of a sudden it’s four in the morning and he’s standing on Moscow Road in Bayswater and there’s a light dusting of snow falling on his head as he waits for Malfoy to finish his cigarette.
There was a reason Ron was his best friend, Harry thought. If he had gone back to his apartment he would have forgotten to eat all together in his anxiety about how to deal with the Malfoy situation. Ron subconsciously knew when Harry needed to be reminded to eat, even if he didn’t want the backstory.
“You know, nothing about this,” Draco said, gesturing between them, “makes a lot of sense, either. Doesn’t mean I don’t like it.”
When Malfoy says nothing but gives him a somewhat disbelieving look, Harry fumbles onward, "I've never seen you here before, thats all."
“We’ve got to stop doing this,” Harry grinned at Draco’s face, irritation evident and inches away from his own, “I’m going to develop spinal problems.”
“I wonder-” Harry began, thinking aloud. “I wonder if there are certain enchantments on this house which prevent anyone other than a lineal descendant accessing it.”
Katie appraises him whilst simultaneously frothing the milk. “I’d rate your energy levels as two-out-of-ten. I took off one point because your hair is a mess.”
a situation, Harry assumed that it meant he was being sent back to the field. Unfortunately for Harry, it actually meant quickly and quietly stopping the Daily Prophet from printing a story. A story that would have simultaneously alerted the smugglers to the operation, and named three of his undercover operatives.
“I quite like being burned into your memory,” Harry replied, happily turning a loop-the-loop and feeling the wind rush through his hair.
He hoists Katie up to standing, one arm over his shoulder and snakes an arm around her waist for support. Harry eyes him suspiciously, hot, prickly anger coursing inside him.
Surprisingly, Malfoy looks at him with something like respect. Harry has never, ever been on the receiving end of it so he isn’t one hundred percent sure that’s what it is. It might be indigestion.
is linked to caring what a posh, judgemental, former Death Eater thinks of him. But then again, Harry is self-reflective enough to know that not liking someone and not caring what they think are two different matters entirely. Arguably, Harry has always cared
“Did you arrange this gorgeous decor, Potter?” Draco taunted as they scaled another staircase adorned by the mummified heads of house elves.
“Better make it an espresso shot as well,” she laughs, “how many Firewhiskies did you have last night?”
“I want to-” Harry started, searching for permission somewhere within Draco’s eyes. They were so bloody close he had half a mind just to do it, but he didn’t want to discount the fact that he may have misread every single signal he had interpreted on that rooftop.
Draco appeared to have undergone a personality transplant in those preceding minutes because he was, all of a sudden, very compliant. No sooner had Harry requested it but Draco’s mouth was on his, lips moving deliciously slowly as he explored Harry with his tongue.
"You should too," his secretary barks again. "I think you should leave before any further damage is done to your robes."
He holds up a thick, blue and gold sweater from Molly emblazoned with the letter “H” and decides that perhaps it is time to invest in clothes that he actually purchases with his own galleons. As with the skincare and the vanity and the countless other miscellaneous items in his house, nothing seems to have been intentionally put here by him. Plus, he could use the time to do his usual last minute Christmas shopping. He makes a mental note not to buy Ron another set of dragon-hide gloves this year.
“Well, he’s very good at it,” Harry pointed out for the twentieth time. “Someone has finally convinced the Prophet to run stories about something other than the Ministry’s incompetence.”
"No problems," she says, ducking down to grab her coat and boots from under the cafe bench. "Don't forget the password though, I don't fancy waiting out in the dark again because you forgot it and had to change it again."
Malfoy raises one, perfect blond eyebrow. “Other people don’t seem to find me annoying.” He says it so honestly in that disarming way which makes Harry feel guilty. “Prejudiced, maybe. But not annoying.”
“How on earth are we going to tell if Harry Potter looks like a blast-ended skrewt in things if you look like someone else?” Ginny asks. Her tone is slightly incredulous but her mouth twitches like it always does when she’s trying not to laugh.
It's a very Malfoy-esque move, simply waving people and not acknowledging their existence, Harry thinks. He places the soy down a little rougher than anticipated and lingers longer than is probably necessary.
Malfoy looks up, appraising him. Harry thinks he can see a flicker of surprise in the pale grey eyes that meet his, but he second guesses himself because in an instant, its gone. The cool, collected gaze that meets his reverts back to its stoic indifference.
Draco’s face twitched quizzically. Harry wondered if Draco was trying to envisage cleaning a house without a house elf. This, Harry thought, would have been a difficult task for someone who had probably never learned a household charm in their life, or so much as seen a cleaning product.
Harry grinned at her as she lead them through the small cottage to the back door which opened onto a wide, expansive garden. It looked manicured to perfection, but Harry knew that was a testament to Hermione’s brilliant charms work. In fact, the garden beds were hiding a gnome infestation of gargantuan proportions.
Draco cocked an eyebrow. “My second cousins are all part-Veela,” he said. “You’d positively wet yourself over them.”
Katie, very fortunately in Harry’s opinion, chooses that moment to interrupt to tell Harry that she’s closing off the coffee machine. It used to be that Harry would tell her what time to shut off the machine and pack up. Now, he muses, she tells him what to do.
Draco laughed a little bitterly. “Mother is in France right now, Potter and there’s no way in hell you’re making me go there.”
or stupid, or whatever you think it is,” Harry said, pausing to gauge a reaction. Draco’s face remained stoic. “But whether I like it or not, I’m
Draco looked up and smirked, face centimetres away from Harry’s skin. “Do you really want me to talk about my feelings?” he asked, “or do you want me to put my mouth to good use?”
“Good evening to you too, Potter,” Draco replied, nodding an eager, canapé-holding waitress onwards. It felt
His eyes fluttered open and he looked sideways at Harry with disdain. “Thank you for your kind understanding of my predicament, Potter.”
“Hmm,” Ron says, apparently unperplexed. “Sorry Harry, this case has really got me. I can’t think of anyone else right now.”
“Stop thinking,” Draco breathed as they came up for air, his ashy hair sticking slightly to his forehead.
“Please,” he continued, feeling a bit pathetic. “If I’m horrible to sleep next to, you never have to stay again.”
Draco Malfoy found his antithesis in the maze of colourful canapés, downing another self-refilling champagne flute. Later, it would strike Draco that this sight was slightly tragic. Harry Potter was the unneeded hero in the midst of a brilliantly rebuilt world.
“An interesting thought,” Harry mused, for the first time wondering whether or not his succession of the house by Sirius had been successful. Draco was, after all, a living male in the lineage of the house of Black. The Order had assumed that because Draco only had grounds to inherit it through his mother (much like Teddy), that the chain of inheritance had been broken. The house had, so far, been pliant with Harry’s ownership, including his ability to give orders to Kreacher. However, Draco had been unaware of the existence of number 12 Grimmauld Place until this very moment.  Harry wondered whether or not that made a difference.
“Yes, but he didn’t know it’s Harry’s cafe, Ron,” Hermione says slowly, as if Ron and Harry are struggling to comprehend simple logic. “And I can imagine Malfoy would like exotic things, and Harry’s cafe is somewhat...different.”
“Wait, how do you know where she lives?” Harry says, as Malfoy takes a left on Shaftesbury Avenue, then an immediate right down Dean Street.
Not that they needed to know, Harry thought. It wasn’t as if he and Draco ever sat down and talked about their feelings or their absurd attraction to each other or at what point they decided it was acceptable to secretly meet up to snog each other to death at work. It wasn’t as if Draco Malfoy was his boyfriend (although Harry was, by that point, hopelessly in love with him). Hell, Harry wasn’t even sure if he was gay. It didn’t really matter much to him anyway, because he definitely wasn’t seeing anyone else.
Ron raised an eyebrow. “Christ, Harry, you’re wound up tighter than a werewolf at full moon. What did you put in your breakfast this morning?”
“Kiss me, you idiot,” Harry breathed, desire coursing so strongly through him, he was finding it difficult to stay vertical. He swore his imagination was running away with him because it was hard to believe he was standing in 12 Grimmauld Place, bailed up against a wall, wanting to do absolutely filthy things to one Draco Malfoy.
Harry had meant to say something more enlightened about making more honourable choices and avoiding adverse consequences. But Draco Malfoy had an inexplicable knack for getting under his skin, and making his psyche revert back to fifteen-year-old, reckless Harry.
Harry sighs. “Truthfully, I don’t. I just have really good staff and an ability get by on very little sleep.”
“You could be more conciliatory, you know,” Katie argues, as they pack up the cafe together an hour later. Malfoy had left the shop not ten minutes ago and Katie is, for some inexplicable reason, throwing down the gauntlet for a former Death Eater.
“And I suppose you wanted to buy the most nondescript, inconspicuous car on the market,” Harry quips, free hand feeling the soft leather seat underneath him.
being related to any other wizarding family was laughable. Harry was fairly sure there was a Potter somewhere on the Black tapestry (though he had not recognised the name). He wasn’t about to let Draco know that though.
“I can’t believe you woke me up for this,” Ginny says crossly when she twirls out of the fireplace at the Leaky Cauldron two hours later. “If you needed fashion advice, you could have asked Neville.”
Of course, it’s far too early to be anywhere close to Diagon Alley now, so Harry rummages through his draws and pulls out a pair of old, slightly damp smelling running shorts and a hoodie that is a nostalgic, hand-me-down from Dudley. He has no idea how he still owns it, but he definitely doesn’t mind getting it dirty and sweaty.
Malfoy’s head whips around and he cocks an eyebrow at Harry as if to say “what’s your business?” Harry actually feels irritated at that point because he’s really quite sick of people lifting their eyebrows at him today and even though he’s surprised to see Malfoy, Malfoy clearly isn’t surprised to see him, which means Malfoy has been lurking out here in the dark all night and
Draco had to admit, the garlic content of the kebab did make the dry meat taste much better than first expected. He chewed thoughtfully as he watched Harry devour his.
“Or that,” Ron agrees ruefully. “Don’t tell me you got in early to get ahead on yours. You’re very...jittery today.”
, he had never felt so complete. There were no words to explain how right he felt, how at home and how comfortable, and despite the fact that his heart viscerally hurt to think about how the depth of his attachment might not be wholly reciprocated, he was at peace with it. He was totally, hopelessly and irrevocably in love in a way that he had never considered possible.
Draco reached his free hand over to press part of it down. Predictably, it sprang right back up. He cocked his head slightly, as if trying to comprehend it.
Malfoy said nothing. As usual, Harry fell into the trap of having an inexplicable need to fill the silence.
“I’m not letting you leave here without me,” he says, sticking his chin out defiantly. “As her employer, I have a duty of care-”
One thing they don’t talk about is Hogwarts, which is a relief because the Hogwarts-Malfoy that Harry remembers is a merciless bully and an absolute prat and this Malfoy doesn’t seem at all like that. In fact, Harry has to admit that he sort of
“It doesn’t matter,” Draco said quickly, looking away from the tapestry to face him. “You wouldn’t understand.”
As it turns out, Harry doesn’t have much of a chance to make friends, anyway, because the very next week, The Bad Thing happens.
since I had Malfoy hired to do that for me,” Harry said, an insidious feeling of panic now constricting itself tightly around his chest like a tendril of Devil’s Snare.
“The lazy and the impoverished,” Harry retorted, throwing the charred remains of the kebab wrapper at him.
“If they’re so gorgeous, why are you avoiding them?” he asked, trying to sound more blasé about the exchange.
It was after seven thirty by the time they actually sat down to eat their mildly warm noodles. Rose had a tantrum over bath time and then it had taken Ron a solid thirty minutes to convince Molly that she didn’t need to be both their full time babysitter and personal chef. She protested and used Harry as an example by saying that he looked far too thin, but was eventually persuaded by Ron’s argument that Harry wasn’t in fact their child and actually, Harry never said that Molly couldn’t be
“Oh that one doesn’t open-” Harry started, before being lost for words as Draco easily opened the door.
Once he’s satisfied Harry isn’t actually at risk of chundering, he speeds right back up and continues his death defying idiocy right back across London into Bayswater where he takes a sharp left from Queensway and around a few more corners and rolls the Lamborghini into an underground carpark off a very expensive looking street.
“He’s actually very nice once you get to know him,” she says, “although he seems to get under your skin more than the average person.”
“Well, obviously,” he said, stammering a little, “but also I mean, what we’re doing when we’re not having sex.”
Draco smirked, uncrossing his arms and leaning forward on his broomstick. “I wasn’t aware there was a next time.”
She pulls a stool out from behind her and motions for him to come around the counter and sit in the poky corner next to the coffee machine. He stumbles a bit on his way around.
“Great story, Potter,” Draco quipped, but Harry saw his eyes widen perceptively as number 12 revealed itself in front of his eyes.
The alcohol has made him warm and fuzzy and he doesn’t feel the cold of the snowflakes falling on his cheeks. Only that they’re slightly wet and run down his face a bit. He wonders if he’s actually sober enough not to splinch himself on the apparition home.
"I'm leaving," says a familiar voice at around five in the evening. Harry looks up into stern green eyes, adorned by greying, wispy hair.
Malfoy narrows his eyes. “You do realise she’s an adult who is perfectly capable of making her own decisions.”
Harry eventually wanders into the kitchen, chats to Levi for a bit and gratefully accepts an egg on toast. He’s mindlessly rearranging the drawer of spare mugs when Katie ducks her head in and asks Levi if he would mind covering for her out the front for 10 minutes.
Usually, Harry wouldn’t bother. Hermione is usually right, if usually means in ninety-nine point nine-nine percent of cases.
As it turned out, it was not an uncommon occurrence to have to convince the Daily Prophet and its somewhat injudicious reporters to not blow their cover on an entire operation. Harry was on his way to learning that, despite the logical belief that wizarding criminals were their adversaries, the Daily Prophet was the true nemesis of all Aurors.
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry could see Ron biting down hard on his lip to stop himself from laughing out loud. It was only once Kingsley had left, Harry realised he wasn’t quite sure how to broach the subject without seeming a little insane.
Malfoy puts his drink down on the table and flips the cardboard coaster through his long, pale fingers.
father that had just died so he really wasn’t in the position to make any sort of suggestion. Grief was a weirdly personal thing, in Harry’s view.
It’s with this thought that he ends up rifling through his closet before six in the morning, trying to find appropriate attire for an event that is at least twelve hours away. He finds nothing. Usually, he muses, a combination of a well-worn sweater and the only pair of jeans he owns would do. He has put on a few kilograms since he bought them, he supposes, but the stress of working two jobs necessitates a lot of snacking, drinking, forgetting to cook dinner and having Italian takeaway five nights a week. In retrospect, he’s surprised he hasn’t yet turned into a lasagne.
“You bloody cheated your way into the team in the first place, scarhead,” Draco exclaimed, as Harry’s face burst into a sly grin at the outrage he had clearly evoked. “First years had been banned from house teams for decades but I suppose I should have known an exception would be made for Harry Potter.”
the sheets to within an inch of their life on Draco’s insistence, but cleaning so thoroughly that it might have reduced the thread count evidently hadn’t been enough to convince him.
And then the hooded person pushes back the hood and Harry sees a shocking mop of white blond hair and he
“Your self-awareness astounds me,” Harry replied, drily. He wondered what this Draco thought about Hogwarts-Draco. It sounded as if the younger version of himself had drawn on some international inspiration.
Despite his fatigue, Harry grins. He knows Ron is ecstatic about Hermione's pregnancy, but Harry has no doubt that Ron is not the most well equipped person to cope with any sudden, hormonal outburst.
that Harry knew Malfoy couldn’t resist. That is to say, Lucius Malfoy had worked at the Ministry for many years, and until recently, it had been a career opportunity completely out of reach to the prodigal son.
“Because you don’t want children?” Harry asked, briefly considering that this conversation had taken an unexpected turn.
Honestly, the way his life had turned out he was lucky to even have made it to his late twenties, Harry reflected.
“But I think he likes me because he’s always turning up at my place and we always end up snogging for hours and then usually-”
Harry scowls. “I’ll be sure to pass your comments on to the owner,” he says, pushing himself back up to walk away. He honestly isn’t sure why he is bothering with Malfoy, of all people. He must be seriously losing the plot.
But even Draco Malfoy couldn’t have predicted the offer that Harry had put on the table that morning, and there was something so satisfying about catching him completely off-guard.
Harry’s imagination jumped a little too far ahead and he felt his eyes go wide and his throat go very dry. He swallowed. Hard.
The morning rush has subsided by the time Harry walks in, and he’s even more pleased to see Meldrid is nowhere in sight. Blearily, he casts a pleading look at Katie from in front of the register.
Inside the drawing room, he led Draco to the imposing, richly embroidered tapestry that covered the entire right wall. Releasing his hand, he stood back as Draco stared, transfixed at the thin, golden lines that connected the various names. He reached out carefully to trace the strand that connected
Katie rolls her eyes, "you do know the point of being the owner is that you can pay other people to do the dirty work for you?"
Harry saw Draco flatten himself against the wall instantaneously as Walburga Black started her usual screeching, yellow eyes wide open in accusation, stout frame and black bonnet as unpleasant to the eye as her voice was to the ears.
“Perfume and cooking?” Harry asks doubtfully, picking up the copy and flipping it over to read the blurb.
“Of course I want regulars invited!” Harry exclaims, a little shrilly. He needs to get a grip, he reminds himself quickly, or he will end up sounding like Aunt Petunia. “I just didn’t know-”
it better than me,” Draco said, whirling around to face Harry mid-way up the stairs, “you’re just willing to do more idiotic things to catch it.”
“I hardly think I’ll be taking driving tips from someone who doesn’t know how to drive,” Malfoy replies, as he smoothly rounds the last corner of the parking garage, indicates and pulls out onto Gerrard Place.
“But galleons were never part of your plea deal,” Harry says, convinced he has seen the Malfoy file before and never remembering a monetary figure appearing in the records.
“What are you looking at me like that for?” Draco asked, squinting slightly as the sun poked its way though Harry’s blinds.
Harry wouldn’t come to appreciate the intricacies and the differences in one Draco Malfoy until months later. By the time of the 2008 Christmas Party debacle, he swore he couldn’t see the similarities at all.
it’s Ginny, yells “Speech!” after that, and forces him to get up on the bench and make an impromptu speech about the year. He resolves to murder Ginny because there’s nothing he hates more than random speeches and everyone looking at him and expecting him to say something profound.
“Actually, I created the position myself,” Harry said, idly picking up a paper weight from Malfoy’s desk. “I thought that someone who works within the shadowy ranks of the media machine is more likely to be capable of managing it.”
“What are you doing this weekend?” Harry asked compliantly, still distracted by the thought of being in a state of undress with Draco and how his skin would feel against Harry’s and the feeling of Draco’s mouth hot against Harry’s neck and lips and stomach and-
Draco’s eyes flitted around the dark (albeit clean) entrance hallway apprehensively as Harry cast a required warming spell and lit the lamps down the passageway. He was about to make an insidious comment about Draco’s lack of sarcastic remarks when he heard the rustle of a curtain over his shoulder.
“Do you think it wise to play with fire on a rooftop covered by grass?” Draco asked, eyeing Harry as he
Harry took a defiant sip of his tea, which was now at least twenty-five percent sugar. It tasted fantastic if you asked him.
Draco looked stunned. Harry actually had no idea how he proceeded with that conversation. The wine must have helped, he guessed, because he didn’t feel the choking sort of anxiety he sometimes did around Malfoy.
, Draco thought. A sign of a poor upbringing, as Mother would say. Draco knew that Potter was raised by muggles, but he didn’t know much more than that. He knew there were rumours that the boy-who-lived had experienced a less than pleasant childhood considering his infamy in the wizarding world, but it wasn’t something Draco had ever even considered raising with his coworker.
“Is that a backhanded way of saying I interest you?” Malfoy asks. It’s a very Slytherin thing to say, Harry thinks. A Gryffindor would never assume such an inference.
“Who cares about the Ethics Committee?!” Draco shot back, clearly troubled. “What about the witches and wizards of England who adore you and despise me?”
“What are you going to put on yours? Your name, I suppose,” Ron says darkly and Harry feels a twinge of guilt. He has a sudden urge to change the topic.
As Walburga’s monologue continued, and Draco gazed on in utter confusion and horror, Harry sidled closer to the unflapped curtain surreptitiously. Draco’s eyes, wide and panicked, met his as Harry reached the edge of the portrait.
“Ssstill gonna give-me-a-raise?” she slurs through thick lips and what Harry imagines will be a very dry mouth tomorrow.
Malfoy stares icily at him. “It makes it a bit hard to exist in wizarding England without galleons, you halfwit.”
Upon reflection, Draco wasn’t exactly sure what Potter was to him. He wasn’t his friend, or his enemy, or even just his colleague. Harry Potter was, all things considered, the one thing that had stayed consistent for Draco’s entire life. Whether it was insulting him or conspiring with him to eat kebabs on a rooftop, Harry Potter had never changed. He was still the slightly reckless, spontaneous and messy Harry Potter that had a certain disregard for his own safety and an untameable hero complex that Draco had always known.
(quickly skipping over Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange’s names, Harry noticed) and finally down to rest over
“Your feelings,” she replied, setting a charm to the dishes in the kitchen sink and flopping herself down in the opposite armchair, a knowing eyebrow raised.
Of course, Harry had no idea the kind of money the Prophet was paying their reporters. But the Ministry had a certain
“Believe it or not, Potter, but the cup is incredibly difficult to win when the Headmaster insists on awarding Gryffindor seven million house points for having a person with a scar on their forehead,” Draco retorted.
, it’s not as if he doesn’t see his be-speckled mug on every street corner most days, but he supposes it’s one of those endlessly practical things that Hermione buys in bulk and gifts to everyone. He makes a mental note to ask Ginny.
“Where. Have. You. Been,” Draco demanded, words punctuated by rough kisses down Harry’s neck. Harry temporarily failed to respond as Draco attacked the soft flesh where his neck and shoulder met and he sighed in contentment.
“I’m not-” Harry started, then paused. He wasn’t sure if it really was the right time to say it because he wasn’t sure if they had really established what kind of arrangement they were carrying on here.
story, Potter,” Malfoy snapped, bitterly. “I should have expected the quintessential overachiever to swoop in at the last moment to remind me that I am unworthy.”
“This snow is ghastly,” Malfoy says with disdain as he runs a hand roughly through his now-wet hair. “I’m going home.”
It turns out Harry is very scared. Malfoy’s normal driving is like a fucking maniac and it seems with every risky lane change or corner Harry’s heart is about to leap right out of his mouth. He actually has to close his eyes for one part and Malfoy slows down and asks him if he’s going to be sick on the leather interior.
In fairness to runners, Harry is horribly unfit and hasn’t slept enough in years, but the aching in his knees and the shortness of his breath is more than apparent after three kilometres and it takes all of his willpower to make it back to Grimmauld place without stopping.
“Do you live close to here?” He asks conversationally, trying desperately to distract Malfoy from the fact that he can’t work a simple seatbelt. Of course, Harry knows full well from his slightly unethical employment and location search that Malfoy lives in Bayswater and not Stoke Newington or the surrounds.
Draco closed his eyes briefly, sighed and turned around to face him, leaning back on the basin. “You, me, a bathroom. This is feeling oddly familiar,” he quipped, although the delivery was a bit cracked and scratchy. He tried to smile but it looked more like a grimace, Harry thought.
Harry snorted and lifted his arm off, shuffling backwards as Draco flipped over and propped himself up on an elbow to face him.
“Definitely,” Harry breathed into Draco’s shoulder, resting his forehead against the soft skin between neck and clavicle.
. Then Ginny comes up on the makeshift stage and kisses him on the cheek and announces to everyone that in fact, they’re getting engaged, and everyone laughs. Harry shouts everyone down and insists they’re not really getting engaged and Ginny stomps on his foot and tells him of course they’re not and everyone clearly knows that and he needs to remember how to recognise a joke. His eyes water a bit but it’s okay because everyone claps and tells him he’s a
Draco’s eyes, still determinedly looking downwards, crinkled slightly in the corners. “You left me to scheme for too long. You know I have a flair for theatrics.”
Harry thinks this greeting is far too familiar for someone who fraternised with the person that killed her father, but he says nothing.
“Perhaps I should work here,” Draco Malfoy says, as Harry puts the soy latte down and slides into the booth opposite him. “It seems to have a relaxed policy towards actually working. Very
“I’m not sure what else to say,” Harry said, matter of factly. “What does one usually say after a profession of admiration?”
Draco sat up on his broom and pretended to consider it, crossing his arms. “I think you’re supposed to be nice to people you’re dating, Potter.”
Harry rolled his eyes and commenced drawing patterns on Draco’s inner thigh instead.  “If it makes a difference, Draco, you’re not the last Black.”
After ten minutes of warm, comforting shower and sombre early-morning reflection, he stares at himself through the Everclear Mirror that Hermione got him for Christmas a few years ago. He’s not sure why Hermione thinks this is something he particularly
Harry chalks the last one up to his curiosity. It’s just like at Hogwarts, he rationalises. He needs to have one eye on Malfoy at all times for security purposes. Malfoy has always been a threat (albeit a mild one). Harry is right to be curious about it all.
Malfoy snorts in a very undignified sort of way and doesn’t respond. Somehow, it makes Harry feel even more stupid.
an Olympic sport,” Malfoy mutters and Harry hasn’t the foggiest how Malfoy even knows what the Olympics are, let alone what sports are represented, so he just shakes his head and feels relieved when Malfoy steers them into a dimly lit, grungy pub that’s somehow still open despite it being well past two.
“Oh yeah,” Harry mumbles, trying to find the right parting words to your former arch-nemesis who has actually turned out to be a half decent human being. “Well, thanks for tonight, and um...I’ll see you soon?”
“Never mind,” Draco hissed, eyes closed, body close as something perceptibly firm pressed against Harry’s stray hand.
to make sure he passed the muggle certification standard and Harry has to quickly remind him that Harry really is an Auror and
“Actually it was a century,” Harry replied, feeling very accomplished. Draco rarely lost his cool and this was, apparently, a sore point. “I suppose when you’ve got natural talent-”
Ron found him again at quarter to six, buried in his work and with six broken quills piled up next to his right hand.
“Quite possibly,” Draco agreed, shutting the cupboard door. “It wouldn’t be abnormal for pureblood families to protect certain things in that way to prevent their estates from ever being sold to third parties.”
Harry looks down at his lapel and sighs. It is becoming a regular occurrence. He decides to push on with his request. “Luciana could you do an employment and location check for me?” he asks, trying to shift the attention towards work and wondering how he can make this request sound as professional as possible.
“Sorry, I was thinking about...work,” Harry said, unconvincingly, leaning back slightly in his chair. “To what do I owe the pleasure, Malfoy?”
Harry briefly contemplated what it would have felt like if neither of them were clad in Ministry’ approved pants and robes. He felt a familiar sensation flicker, warm below his stomach but he was so caught up in the closeness that he forgot to try and think of something else.
“Boy,” she said, voice shaking with what Harry thought was wonder (having never heard Walburga Black speak so softly before). “Boy, what is your name?”
He knows he's too invested in her. She's just about to turn 18, only 7 years younger than him, but in a way he feels very protective of her. Katie doesn't really need protection, he knows that. She has older twin brothers that could flatten him in a minute. But there is an undeniable connection he feels with people who have lost family in the war. Selfishly, Harry is sort of glad there are now so many survivors who understand the pain of losing one's parents. It makes him feel less alone.
As it turned out, they did manage to make it to Harry’s bed, and Harry was saved from a certain herniated disc. He wasn’t particularly concerned with that fact, however as he allowed himself to be ravaged by Draco’s hands and his mouth. He felt like he was drowning in the most pleasurable way one could drown; lightheaded, unable to draw a proper breath and absolutely saturated with the presence of someone who made his body feel like it was floating. Like it wasn’t really attached to Harry’s head and it had a complete mind of it’s own.
“What about ice cream and chocolate?” Harry asks, wondering if Malfoy is one of those lactose intolerant people who are secretly gluttons-for-punishment and like to put their intolerance to the test.
"Leave those on my desk if you have other robes to wear home," she instructs. "I'll have those wand-cleaned and pressed on Monday morning."
It starts quite well he thinks, thanking everyone for their contributions to St. Drogo the best coffee shop on Diagon Alley, until he rambles off track and starts explaining to everyone that they’ll probably see a two page spread in the
“He’s not scrawny; he’s over six foot,” Harry retorts, then immediately feels a bit weird. Why does he know things like that? He shouldn’t know things like that.
Harry, using the brooms additional speed and agility, ducked slightly below Draco to the left and snatched the golden orb from beneath his outstretched hand. Hearing Draco yell some select profanities from behind him, Harry laughed breathlessly as he manoeuvred the broom into a steep dive and pulled up on the outer edge of the trees.
for us,” Malfoy sneered and for a moment, Harry was transported back to another time, another office with another Malfoy and a diary, a sock and a miserable house elf.
An hour and a half later and Harry was chewing on a corner of white toast, eyes transfixed on Draco Malfoy who was sitting on his couch, legs tucked up underneath him, mug of tea in one hand and horribly out of date edition of The Quibbler in the other. It was a weirdly, lovely sight, Harry thought. He hadn’t a clue how they had managed to end up here, but he wasn’t going to start complaining.
Flicking it towards the door he pulls the first report over from the pile on his desk and stares, unseeing at it’s cover.
Hermione paused, probably to consider what an appropriate response would be. Hermione was very clever like that, Harry thought. She actually bothered to consider her replies unlike Harry usually just said the first thing that popped into his head.
"What are you doing here?" he blurts out, immediately regrets the awkwardness of it, and then realises one cannot literally eat their own words.
It had been more or less two months after the kebab-eating, cigarette-smoking, testosterone- fuelled kissing session when Draco Malfoy swooped into Harry’s office, (completely uninvited, of course) to enquire about Harry’s weekend. Harry hadn’t ever recalled imagining so many possibilities at once. His brain almost exploded in the sixty seconds he took to answer the relatively basic question.
Harry looked a little stunned. Draco thought this was strange because if he had to hazard a guess, he would have thought this wouldn’t have been an out of the ordinary experience for the hero of the wizarding world. A hundred people in that very room would have gladly licked Harry’s shiny, black shoes at that very moment.
Draco didn’t respond. Harry’s heart leapt at the thought. He also felt a bit dizzy, but that was probably the wine. Harry vowed never to underestimate the power of wine again.
Harry honestly doesn’t know how to respond and just says “er, yeah i guess” like the idiot he is, and next thing he knows they’ve pulled up outside Katie’s flat and Malfoy is rummaging around in her bag, fishing out a key, picking her up off his lap and carrying her up into the house.
He gives up trying around four-thirty when he yells himself awake and finds his hair limp, clinging to his forehead and sheets saturated in his own sweat. He growls in annoyance which soothes his frustration, but it settles uncomfortably back into resigned acceptance as he steps into the shower.
I grovel for your forgiveness on how delayed this chapter has been. I started working on it earlier this year and then COVID happened and the whole world went absolutely crazy. I mean, it's still crazy, but it took me a while to work out that I had to prioritise my escapism. So here is the next chapter and I am eternally grateful for anyone who has bothered to continue reading. I swear it won't take me as long next time.
"Haven't got anything else to do," he says simply. He knows he would rather work the eight-til-three shift than do boring things like read the reports that were calling him from his desk at Auror office or help Kreacher tidy his perpetually dusty house. "Besides, sometimes its good to get your hands dirty and mix with the riffraff."
Harry thought about the various other cupboards and hangings which had resisted his demands. He wondered whether Draco would object to being used as an assistant in his quest for victory against the most noble house of Black.
“What would you like to talk about?” Harry asked innocently, accidentally-on-purpose stretching a leg out under the desk to brush against Draco’s.
Harry cautiously props himself up onto the top of the booth. He isn’t ready to commit to sitting back down.
“You know, I’m not really supposed to say this while I’m on shift-” the waitress started, smiling wryly.
hot that Harry almost completely forgot what he was asking or why he was asking it. His body ached with a powerful combination of an insatiable hunger and unbridled pleasure and he wanted to eat all his words back into his mouth so he could stop making an absolute fool out of himself.
Malfoy looks at him for a split second and then bursts into peals of very un-Malfoyish laughter at what Harry can only imagine is the horrified look on his face. It’s sort of disarming the way that the usually haughty, aristocratic face is broken into an unguarded look of pleasure, even when it’s at his expense.
Draco sighed and grasped Harry’s hand in his own, lifting it away from his cheek. “It exhausts me to explain the intricacies of the Malfoy family tree. If we’re really going to do that, I need tea.”
"So if I quit one of my jobs and get a social life you'll give it up?" he asks, teasing her to try and lighten the mood.
“Sorry, I forgot my badge,” he said, with what Harry knew to be a feigned nonchalance. “So wait, Harry’s not gay? I’m disappointed. I thought we knew him better than that, Hermione.”
“Oh?” Harry asked, pouring the tea into two mugs and handing one to Draco. He crossed the room and dropped himself onto the chair opposite. “You don’t like your second cousins?”
Harry sits in the Gallardo and wonders why he hasn’t known these strange things about Malfoy before. That he drives a car and understands muggle pop culture references and knows where Harry’s staff live. It’s all very disconcerting.
Draco looked at him disdainfully. “You’ve drunk three quarters of that bottle since we’ve been up here,” he said. But he didn’t remove his hands from Harry’s.
After another five minutes had elapsed, Harry grew sick of thinking about death. So he picked himself up off the bed and went to look for Draco who was spending a suspiciously long time in the bathroom. He found the latter with his hands spread out over the basin, staring at his reflection in the mirror.
, Hermione,” he said at last, putting his mead down on the table. His left hand joined his right in attempting to tear out pieces of his hair.
“Whatever, Potter,” Malfoy cuts him off dismissively. “But we’re going to use my method of transportation, so you’re going to have to get a bit cosy.”
“Surely someone like you can afford chairs, Potter,” Malfoy sniffed disdainfully, looking down at him.
“Fine,” he mutters. But he’s not fine. His world is spinning slightly and he feels very out of his depth.
If were possible, he would have liked to hide away here with Draco forever in their little bubble of domestic bliss with a side of sarcastic bantering and mind-blowing blowjobs. But Draco also wanted to be distracted, and Harry was determined to deliver if not for the sole purpose of being able to weasel his way into spending more time with him.
“Oh Merlin no, Draco,” he groaned, whipping around to see Malfoy move the curtain over the foreboding portrait slightly ajar. Harry’s hands involuntarily clamped tight over his ears.
Thankfully, Harry’s seatbelt actually releases him this time, and so he can make a somewhat dignified exit although he’s fairly sure he’s as pale as a ghost and wonders if his legs still work. This is possibly the most thrilling Saturday night he has had since the War, and that’s not necessarily a good thing.
“Don’t be sensitive, Draco,” he said, grinning and placing his hand delicately on Draco’s knee instead, “I very much enjoy your obsession.”
Harry’s curiosity piques with a tingle of anticipation running down his spine. He wants more answers, but he knows he is unlikely to get them from Katie. He has learned over their two years working together that it would be easier to escape Azkaban than get a secret out of her.
“Seems reasonable,” Ginny replies, poking her head out from the underside of the table and placing the plant gingerly back on the table top.
At that moment Harry spied golden scrawl on a handle in the back of the shed, reached in and pulled out a Nimbus 2001. Despite the mild panic attack he was still recovering from, he managed to smile. This ought to be good.
“There’s a plural of sanity?” Harry asked, politely. Hermione, mouth still agape, was looking from Ron to the paper to Harry back to the paper.
Harry cocks an eyebrow at her. He highly doubts Malfoy wants to apologise to him, or discuss the goings on of the war at all. In fact, he would hazard a guess that Malfoy tries his hardest not to think of the war, unless it is scheming of ways to repair his image. Harry imagines Malfoy probably hosts a charity ball or two for that exact reason. Then again, he has another reason to talk to people now.
That was today’s task, once Malfoy had reached capacity with him (or the house, whichever was more abrasive) and decided to leave.
“That’s fine,” Harry answered, a little too quickly. He never had been particularly tactful in awkward situations. “I just came by to grab my broom, and wondered if we could borrow another?”
Harry felt as though he was melting into a puddle against the wall. His legs felt like they were somewhat detached from his body and he was fairly sure having Draco pressed firmly up against him was the only thing preventing them from giving way all together.
"Fine by me," Harry says, "I have to go past the cafe first to check on something, so just floo there when you're ready."
"Right. Thanks," he mutters appreciatively. He knows Luciana is only looking out for him, but her strict mothering reminds him of a dangerous combination of Molly Weasley and Minerva McGonagall, and he isn't sure he could spend much more than the ten to twelve hours a day he already does with her at the office. He was warned that being an Auror was a difficult job and involved perfecting the art of reading people. This is something Harry has found exceptionally hard, having a range of emotional intelligence only slightly superior to Ron's. However, he never anticipated the other challenges which accompanied having one's own secretary. A secretary who prefers to act simultaneously as his surrogate mother.
“Er, a potential lead,” Harry says, taken aback by the question. He wonders whether Luciana knows Malfoy in some capacity. Harry dearly hopes not.
“It’s not like I tried to, believe me. But it’s just that I like talking to you and looking at you and being with you, and conjuring up questions I can to ask you at work that I secretly already know the answer to. Or finding you at these god-awful Ministry events because I feel comfortable with you in a way I don’t feel with anyone else. Or inviting you to my rooftop in the middle of winter to eat a kebab and divulge my persistent, unrequited feelings because I just can’t help but want to spend more of my time with you, even if it makes absolutely no fucking sense.”
He froze when he heard Hermione say, “I’m sorry to hear about your father, Draco,” and waited with bated breath for the response.
Katie cocks an eyebrow. "He comes in almost every Saturday," she replies, amusement flickering in her intonation. "Only, you wouldn't know that since you usually drop in at eleven and leave at twelve."
“I don’t think she should side-along like this, Potter,” Malfoy says pointedly. “I can get her home.”
Harry had revelled in the spontaneity of it all. Over the course of his year-long mission to spoil the profit margins of the Daily Prophet, his favourite time of day had become the inevitable verbal battle with his favourite high-school nemesis.
,” he continued, spying Harry opening his mouth again in his peripherals, “of mentioning the time you thanked me for it in front of Flitwick.”
Harry didn’t finish that sentence because one second he was nervously fiddling with a piece of synthetic grass and the next second a warm, soft hand was cupping his chin and his cheek and hot lips were pressed roughly against his and his brain seemed to completely disintegrate in his skull. His free hand somehow found the back of Draco’s fine, blonde hair and pulled him impossibly closer as their lips parted briefly and Harry tasted cigarettes and garlic, both of which should have been off putting but somehow drew him in like nothing had before.
Draco felt his vision tunnel, his heartbeat rising and his skin flushing at the sight of it, and only the feeling of Potter’s hand on his lower back helped to ground him, and kept him moving forward.
A massively long tail, nearly twice as long again as his own legs, which had been kicking and struggling to help him break free of his captor’s grip. He stilled, heart slamming in his chest, at the sight below him.
He was stopped from proceeding with his plan of touching every inch of Draco’s skin, when his mate grabbed at his wrist.
“It’s a very impressive little thing.” The Healer observed, and suddenly the diagnostics charm expanded, showing them both a bright little dot in the middle of a dark image. “It’s only a few cells big, and it’s already so bright with magic.”
Neville was already nodding, but then his vision trailed down to Draco’s midsection, where he must have obviously felt the concealed bump when he’d hugged Draco, and at the arm looped into Harry’s, and up to Harry’s still glowering, possessive face.
“I can’t say I’m surprised, either.” Harry agreed, his skin feeling hot and tight as those grey eyes slid away from him to trail over his seated form, lingering longest at the bulge of Harry’s more-than-half-hard cock in his trousers.
“Well, despite talking himself up to be all that when he was practically sitting in my lap at the bar, the minute I got ‘im back to my place, would you believe he expected me to do every bit of the work? Wouldn’t even undress himself, had me waiting on him, bend and knee, refused to so much as even lick my cock, let alone suck it, and once I’d gotten him off - twice while fucking him, mind you! - he demanded that I fuck him again.’
Draco rolled his eyes again, but felt a slightly pleased flutter in his chest at having this man being so plainly worried for him. He tried to suppress the dopey smile that threatened to bubble up from somewhere inside of him, and crossed his arms, huffing.
“Deep breath, baby.” Harry warned, and began to pull out, the egg wrapped tightly in his clasper, withdrawing both as he pulled back.
“Please, what, baby?” Harry asked, eyes fixed on where the egg lodged into Draco’s now puffy and swollen hole, stretching it obscenely, before receding again. “Please let you keep playing with your slutty little hole?”
“I do apologize, mother, but the situation was all a bit too... sensitive, to convey in letters. I wanted to be able to speak with you in person.”
Suffice to say, it had taken nearly every iota of his Malfoy pride and upbringing to school his features and not go to his knees right there in the middle of the pub, and beg Potter to let Draco earn his forgiveness by sucking the Saviour’s cock
the sensation of the eggs popping back out, and wanted to make the experience as pleasurable as it could possibly be for his sweet, perfect mate.
“No! No, never!” Harry said, feeling incensed at the mere implication. “How could I possibly be ashamed of Draco? He’s the most perfect person I’ve ever met, he - he’s carrying my child, he’s -”
Potter’s hair was much longer now, and pulled up into a disastrously messy bun atop his head, and his
“Ah look, he’s texted me just now. The very minute it turned 9pm. Quite the stickler.” Beckett noticed, moving to stand. “I’ll go collect him then. Try not to get too worked up, Harry.”
“That’s a far cry from your earlier allegations.” Harry commented, amused by Malfoy’s supposition of the dichotomy of his character. “And I’m hardly a saint, else I wouldn’t be into this lifestyle at all.”
“How is he, ‘Mione?” Harry asked, brows furrowed in worry. “Is he alright? I didn’t hurt him, did I?”
He came, and the egg squeezed out again, nearly shoved halfway, stretching Draco’s cunthole wide with it. Draco screamed, his back bowing, but it wasn’t enough, and he fell back again, limp, as the egg popped back inside, making his whole body shudder.
“I take it you’ve done your research?” Harry wouldn’t do Malfoy the disservice of not assuming that he hadn’t immediately used all of his not-inconsiderable research skills to do a deep dive into what BDSM was after his brief introduction to it via Beckett the previous week. Malfoy had proved himself to be almost as thorough as Hermione in that front as a lawyer.
“Yes, but I don’t see what that has to do with anything.” Draco said, aiming for nonchalance, even as he heard Harry make a squawk of surprise at the information.
This was the type of man that Draco had pulled back in bars in France, looking for a quick and dirty fuck in the loos. The type that left your teeth rattling and your asshole feeling battered. The type that fucked you so hard you couldn’t even beg for more.
Draco fixed a smile on his own face. “Oh well, we ran into each other, quite by happenstance, actually. I’ve really come to love the area, and well, Harry and I have grown quite close, of late.”
That dark head pulled back, green eyes flicking up to look at him, a moue of confusion marring his slick lips. “Doesn’t it feel good, sweetheart? You don’t like it?”
“Oh Malfoy.” Harry breathed, feeling precum leak out of his cock at the words. “You want to be bred, sweetheart?”
Thumbing over one of Draco’s sweet pink nipples, Harry’s cock hardened further, his mouth watering. He wondered if his mate’s tits would swell even further, full of milk for his children; for
Malfoy moved again in his seat, body tense, eyes looking wild. “So many promises, Potter. Are you planning on making good on them anytime soon?”
“Safeword for a complete stop to the scene,  no questions asked.” Draco paused for a moment, considering. “And I think... Riddle, for my safeword.”
“Oh sweetheart. I love when you beg me so prettily. I’d do anything for you, you know that? I’m going to make you feel so
Narcissa shot him a look like she thought he was a complete idiot. “To begin with, I expect that you
“Hush, darling.” Narcissa said, tone soft yet chiding. “Stay seated and drink some tea. I will ask Mipsy to order a special blend I used to drink when I was pregnant with you. It will help settle your stomach. You shouldn’t be overexerting yourself.”
Draco keened happily as Harry pulled out, his cock twitching and throbbing, before slamming back in.
He could feel wave after wave crashing around him; love, warm and familiar, like magic sparking against his skin. He was with family, and they would support him.
Though Harry was pleased to have it be incredibly obvious that his mate would never, ever deign to touch Ron, he certainly didn’t appreciate Ron’s tone.
“We’ll be needing a room in Labour and Delivery, immediately. And if you could please page our attending Healer, Hermione Granger-Weasley?”
It took only the smallest amount of effort for Harry to work the plug free. He adjusted his grip again, pressing his hips forward against Draco’s arse, sliding his clasper up between his cheeks.
“I can’t believe it either.” Harry echoed, running his hands over their soft heads, ruffling their downy blond and black hair, the two of them looking like tiny, mirror images of Harry and Draco. “Love is a powerful thing.”
Her sharp eyes cut to Harry, and he feels pinned, caught in a Mother’s assessing glare. He barely moves as she glides forward to embrace him as well, kissing the air by his cheeks, her expression chill.
By that point, every international news outlet was hungry for more about England’s Most Infamous Hero.
Harry rolled his eyes at the snark, moving to stand himself, getting right up in Malfoy’s space. “We can discuss it, but for now I think a verbal agreement is fine, assuming we’re keeping things relatively tame. Let’s head to one of the private side rooms so that we can -.”
your cunt dripping for me, when I talk dirty to you. You can’t pretend you don’t like it. Now let me watch your sweet little hole as you try to push out my egg. I wanna watch you come from the stretch, baby. Wanna play with your little clit and cock while you force it out of you.”
Potter’s tongue was not idle either, and it played languidly along the bottom on his shaft, stroking and coaxing, the only counterpoint to the man’s constant suction.
Harry was dripping with sweat, his heart pounding in a steady thrum as his feet hit the pavement in a familiar cadence.
He was dressed in a light linen suit, his long hair left loose around his shoulders, the silvery blond locks tousled by the warm evening wind.
Harry’s cock was fully hard as his hand trailed down further, his rough palm ghosting over the roundness of Draco’s previously flat belly, his green eyes wide with awe and desire and pride.
Draco starts trying to serve his mother tea, but grimaces as he moves forward, clearly hampered by the swell of his stomach. Harry jumps in, managing to splash tea over the side of the little porcelain teacup, and grimaces himself. He sopped up the mess with a napkin, before he hands the cup and saucer to Narcissa.
He shivered as Potter moved around him, coming to stand behind Draco, and began looping the rope to drape down his chest, manipulating it in loops and knots until it framed his pecks, pressing in on them and around them, and up around his trapezius muscles, down around his back.
Eyes squeezed shut, Draco planted his feet against the ground below him, legs spread wide as he cupped at his left tit with his free hand, squeezing at the slight swell and using his thumb and forefinger to pinch at his nipple.
“Need to plug you up again, sweetheart. Can’t let any of the rest of the clutch out too early.” Harry explained. “But first, I think you deserve a bit of a treat, for doing so well.”
He threw his head back with a loud moan as, after parting his lower lips, he carefully ran his index finger over the sweet little nub of his clit.
So, when Pansy had brought Draco to a hole-in-the-wall pub in Muggle London, saying that Potter had finally gotten back from a job in Brazil, and was finally around for Draco to ‘meet,’ Draco had thought he’d been prepared.
Harry barely tolerated people looking at his beautiful mate at the best of times, and he only agreed to go out after much cajoling from the man. He didn’t like when people could see how swollen Draco was with his clutch, but Harry could rarely deny the gorgeous man anything anymore.
Smirking salaciously up at him, Potter then began to pull at his leggings, peeling the dragon-hide down his hips, exposing his sticky, wet prick, and then the rest of his long, lightly muscled legs.
He allowed himself a moment to just bask in the afterglow, but he was nothing if not thorough in his research, so he was determined to confirm if his body was capable of multiple orgasms, which really, was one of the most fantastic things of being in a female body.
“You smell so fucking good here, baby.” Hot breath tickled against the skin of his arse, and if he had been able to, Draco would have squeezed his legs shut.
“Nah, thanks though mate.” Neville said, looking genuinely apologetic. “It’ll be during the first week of school starting back up while the Thistle are in bloom, so definitely not the best time to try to get away.”
Draco felt himself sob, crying out with need, rutting his arse back as much as he could, trying to make Potter understand.
Harry pouted, but he stood, reaching for a bar of soap, eager enough to get his hands all over his mate’s flushed, pale skin.
Harry let out a sob, and he felt Molly and Arthur wrap their arms around him, ushering him forward, and Hermione stepped aside, letting him walk into the hospital room.
“Of course. Absolutely.” Harry said eagerly. “I love him more than anything else in the world. I want only the best for Draco.”
, fucking his delicious little cock into Harry’s mouth, desperate and full of his clutch, loving the feeling of Harry’s eggs inside of him.
“You can take it, baby.” Potter cooed, squeezing and massaging his cock in one big, hot hand. “You can come again for me, can’t you?”
Draco hummed, but allowed Harry to feed him little morsels of chocolate, sucking and licking at his fingers, causing the man’s cock to twitch and spurt more come inside of him.
Draco’s breathing suddenly kicked in again as the egg approached its widest part, his throat sounding raw as he keened and whimpered, and Harry needed to tighten his grasp on his mate’s hips as he tried to pull away.
Harry looked at him, and found Draco staring, silvery eyes wide, mouth agape, looking down at Harry’s cock.
Draco gasped, sobbing and shaking as the egg tucked back inside again, his hole struggling to close at all now, the little bud of it puckered open. “Please, help me get it out!”
“Oh stop, you two.” Hermione huffed. “You’re confusing poor Harry. He looks about ready to hex you, dear.”
Beckett nodded, “I mentioned that I know a bloke with a sizable cock who might happen to have the patience to handle him, and he almost laughed in my face, but seemed interested enough. Then I mentioned he might be interested in the BDSM scene, and he hadn’t heard of it at all. I gave him a brief rundown of the concept, and suggested I might show him around The Griffin, if he wanted to know more, maybe introduce ‘im to you. He did start drilling into me about the legality of the whole thing, but seemed eager enough. Said he’d think on it, and I gave him my mobile number to reach out if he wanted to know more.’
I have... delivered, on my promise of egg-laying, and I have also subsequently changed my original plan of just 3 chapters of plot/porn/plot, and now you shall get 5 chapters, with this (chapter 3) and the following (chapter 4) with 2 additional sex scenes in each!
The Healer blinked at him again, and then at Harry, who had stood as well, still staring at Draco, his green eyes lit back up with that
“And you have my permission to marry Draco.” She said, “If - and only if, you promise that you truly love him, and that you will do everything in your power to protect him, and cherish him, and give him all he deserves.”
He let out a soft sigh as Potter went back down to his legs, looping another length of rope through each binding at his knees, before lashing them down through some hooks on the floor, locking his legs open, immobilizing them as well.
“I did actually plan to wash, Potter.” Draco said, looking sternly down at him. “Perhaps we could attempt that, sometime today?
It was Hermione’s turn to roll her eyes, and she began muttering a series of spells, her wand flicking and swooping in a blur.
“Perfect, yeah - absolutely.” Harry praised, happy with Malfoy getting into the meat of his limits. “I’m not sure if Beckett mentioned, but I’m not that kind of dom at all. I’m not into pain play in any significant sense, and I’m not a true sadist. I would never try to beat you or inflict any significant pain. The furthest I tend to go is some paddling and flogging, but we don’t have to explore that at all today.”
Pressing his thumbs in, Harry began to carefully work it out, using his sharp nails to hook around the remainder of the plug. It popped out, Draco’s cunt fluttering shut, immediately clenching up to clamp around the egg that began to squeeze down just a bit more along his passage.
Harry growled softly, simultaneously loving Malfoy’s trademark sass, but also getting his hackles up at the thought of Draco getting another, bigger fake cock up his arse.
Draco was a mess by this point, Harry needing to hold his shaking hips still as Draco tried to buck and squirm against the intrusion, his whimpers and keening growing louder and louder the fuller Harry made him.
“Sweetheart, I know you like the feeling of my eggs rubbing up inside of you. But you’re going to have to push it out. You can’t just keep playing with it.”
He stripped out of his light shirt, trousers, and shoes, leaving him standing on the small deck of the boat clothed only in a sleek and tight pair of black swim trunks.
A gasp burst from his lips as he touched his cunt again. It was slick all between his lips now, and as he trailed his sharp-nailed fingers carefully over the still fluttering hole there, he could feel just how viscous and thick his slick was, perfectly suited for the underwater environment.
“I was so surprised when you told me that you were relocating indefinitely to Marseillan.” Narcissa observed, expression placid, eyes narrowed. “You didn’t mention that Mr. Potter was already living here.”
“Harry.” Narcissa’s cool voice drew Harry’s gaze down the hall, to where the statuesque woman was gliding gracefully towards them, looking completely composed and put together despite the last minute summons.
Leaving off touching his tits for now, Draco immediately brought his hands down between his legs, bypassing his hard, aching cock entirely. Curiously, his balls had disappeared, but he barely spared that a thought as his hand trailed along the sensitive seam of his lips, a shiver wracking through him even at that light touch.
By the time Harry had re-set the plug and pulled his cocks out again, Draco’s breathing had evened out. Turning Draco carefully over again, Harry gazed down lovingly at his mate’s gorgeous face, and at the swell of his little tits and heavy belly.
He could just make out the glimmer of moonlight on the waves and the shadowy bulk of the hull of his boat, when suddenly his skin prickled, and his senses went on high alert.
“That really is too bad.” Draco said, truly meaning it. “I’ll be sure to swing round once I’m back - I know you’re eager to see what they look like outside of a book.”
Malfoy did stand then, clicking forward on his heels to tower over Harry, his legs looking to go on for miles, his cock hard and obvious in his tight leggings, directly in front of Harry’s face, causing his mouth to water.
She had helped him put up a Fidelius Charm as well, and only she and her husband, Ron, could access the unplottable location.
“I see it still pays to be the Ministry’s Golden Boy.” Draco observed, taking a very ginger seat in one of the patient chairs, watching as Harry began to pace restlessly.
At a wave of Harry’s hand, the shower sprung to life, and Harry eagerly gestured the other man in, following and shutting the shower door behind them both.
Draco’s tone was still polite, though now with a hint of an edge, and Hermione sighed, plopping into the other chair by the patio table, tucking a loose strand of her curly brown hair behind her ear.
He moaned as he settled into position, feeling himself leak more slick, ready and eager to be fucked.
He could practically smell how flush with blood and precum Malfoy was, and saw how wide his eyes got, even though Malfoy was looking down at the floor beside his feet. There was a certain sweetness growing in his scent, and it was making Harry feel wild, reckless and desperate, and absolutely removing his filter.
Draco couldn't help but moan, eagerly tilting his head back, exposing his throat to the other man’s whims, letting the werewolf scent him. He could taste Potter’s magic against the roof of his mouth, and found himself close to panting as well, his cock leaking precome already.
“You’re really trying to spin this to be all about me, Potter?” He challenged, tone sultry and accusatory at once. “As though you weren’t just talking about how desperate you were to get on your knees for me? I’d have rather thought that any fantasy scenarios would include you finally putting me in my place. Lord knows you must be eager to get me over your knee, to spank me raw for all of my past transgressions?’
“So good.” Draco murmured, bringing a hand up to tangle in Harry’s hair, pulling him down to snuggle up into the larger man. “So
Draco couldn’t help the needy groan that left him as Potter pulled his mouth away, but was pleased when the other man began to swiftly divest him of his clothes.
That had ended in a night of tears, Ginny confessing she didn’t think she liked cock at all, and Harry hating himself for almost having hurt her in the attempt.
With a smirk, Harry watched as Draco’s pupil’s dilated, and the heady scent of his arousal, which had just been a faint but prevalent note before, became vibrant, calling urgently to Harry’s senses.
“Er... Neville.” Draco admitted. “But he did thoroughly and repeatedly warn me about the side effects -”
by sight, as he knew most of Malfoy’s catalogue at this point. It was the Louboutin pair, with the bright red sole underneath. The ones that made him
As the moon rose, and Harry changed into his mermaid form, Draco gingerly placed the little bundle of gillyweed into his mouth, and transformed as well.
“Malfoy, really I’m so sorry about this, I -” Harry started again, the moment the door shut behind her, coming forward to hover over Draco like an anxious mother hen.
“Thank you for summoning me.” She replied. “And for bringing Draco here. I am glad he will have access to some experts to assist with his delivery.”
With one last glance at the map and a navigation charm to check that he had the right spot, Draco reached for the jar of gillyweed.
“And we brought the metric tonne of shite you requested, too!” Ron proclaimed, spreading his arms wide to indicate the massive chest, which Hermione lowered down into a corner of the living room. “Merlin's balls man, we had people coming and going in and out of our house all week. Peons and underlings from your lab, Pansy, Ginny, Luna, Blaise, Neville,
