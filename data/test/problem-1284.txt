-"It's Friday, I know where you're planing to go Draco. Please don't. You said she was making you worse, you said no one can replace Astoria, then don't—if not for me then, please, for...Nott, for him, don't go." His voice cracked towards the end. for Nott. He'd said it himself, knowing it was true. Undeniably. Sadly.
This is bad.
A few hours later, found Harry discarded aside and Draco sitting cross-legged at the edge of the bed, as close as he could get to the TV without falling. Harry hadn't been really following the movie, too busy stroking Draco's hair, braiding it—Draco was so captivated by the movie he didn't even notice, let alone object—caressing Draco's hands, kissing them, staring at Draco...But from Draco's endless commentary, Harry picked up on the fact that the hero was waiting for a very important call. Harry snuck up behind Draco and wrapped his arms around his waist, Harry's chin resting on Draco's left shoulder. He kissed Draco's cheek as he lifted his eyes to the TV, the guy was presently swimming. Whatever. Harry buried his nose in Draco's hair and inhaled that addictive, maddening, delicious and sweet apricot scent.
-"F-Fucking Blaise." Draco said in a broken murmur.
Their food and beverages thankfully didn't—and wouldn't get cold, on account of magic.
A pause.
to write an inappropriate, bordering on creepy, amount of letters for Draco, since he needed the ministry owls to take them; his tiny, blue owl Pigwidgeon couldn't make multiple journeys between London and Wiltshire everyday.
. Because I'm uncouth and been raised in squalor. Thank you for deigning to be with me,"
-"I actually thought it went well. You've earned so many points by being an ungrateful and horrible child and not jumping in your Mother's defense. It was a test. You made it."
Harry did.
Fuck. Harry had forgotten.
It wasn't one of Malfoy Manor's extravagantly luxurious restrooms, it didn't belong in Draco's home, where Draco was.
Theo was trying to take away Draco's nearly finished bottle of firewhiskey. But Draco needed it. He needed the numbness he had at the funeral back. Or to fucking die already. He needed his body to stop fighting the inevitable - and just
-"You're as stupid as you are ugly, Potter. Drop the act. Theo isn't happy. How do you feel about more permanent scarring that might or might not—although I'm leaning towards might, lead to your death?"
They entered through the door. And lined up as Pansy instructed, to make a dramatic entrance. Pansy was superlatively overdressed, wearing an expensive tiny, scarlet-red dress and high-heels. She'd said she wanted to make a statement—none of them knew what it was. Theo, in a tight, fashionable —as usual—
His life was maddeningly oxymoronic.
-"Where will he go then?" Lucius inquired, innocently.
Harry, really, could not be held accountable for kissing Draco.
Draco's loud sharp intake of breath went unheard to him in the midst of the havoc ripping in his being. Salazar, how could his heart hurt so much yet still beat?!
Théo sensed Draco hesitating over saying something else so he turned him around in his arms, tucked Draco's head under his chin, wrapped an arm around Draco's waist, stroking Draco's hair with his free hand. He kissed Draco's hair, temple, ear. And waited.
-"No. I mean everything! I just spilled my secrets to the enemy and I feel sleepy instead of horrified!"
I believe that you don't know that while my son, isn't
Everything went black and Harry experienced the familiar feel of being pressed from all directions and having his eyeballs and ears squeezed tightly.
-"Do you need me to talk to him?" Theo whispered hopefully.

-"Yes, but not too much. Alright?"
Then he would remember how his
-"Can we talk privately?" Harry said frantically.
Harry raised his hands in surrender. Malfoy dropped his wand and continued down the hall.
-"Fuck off everyone." Theo said firmly.
The pain was so intense, so all-consuming, that he no longer knew where he was... white-hot knives were piercing every inch of his skin, his head was surely going to burst with pain; his very bones were on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar... he wanted it to end... to black out... to die. He was screaming more loudly than he'd ever screamed since he'd suffered the Cruciatus curse at Voldemort's hands all those years ago.
sooner, but if I could start all over, not knowing what I know now, I'd choose
-"Potter," Nott said, although he didn't spare Harry a single glance, "He seemed increasingly miserable, suspiciously so, when he ought to be overjoyed, all his dreams were coming true."
Harry Potter didn't think. He knelt between Draco's knees, framed Draco's face with his own hands, leaning close, he pressed his lips to Draco's cheek. It was a chaste kiss. Barely a touch of lips. Harry blushed and sat back on his heels, he was brave. Yeah. His bravery was all his and real, so he looked up at Draco.
-"Fuck me!" Draco exclaimed in frustration.
After the incident in the ministry, Draco Malfoy's days formed a pattern, where in no particular order, he would be - sometimes feeling a bone deep fatigue. It wasn't truly physical, yet, it felt like it. He was just so damned
Turns out Pansy Parkinson has a muggle boyfriend named Samuel, whom she calls Sammy. She said he liked it. Draco said it was stupid but secretly thought it cute. Blaise was a bit cross because he was no longer getting laid, since it was difficult to find someone who only wanted sex, on account of him being
But being near Draco like this stripped Harry off his already flimsy self-control, made him wish for things he can never have.
Whatever.
Harry couldn't do anything but stare at him, confused, hurt, scared, he stared at Draco; pleadingly, silently begging Draco to let him have this for a while longer. Harry wasn't ready. No. Harry would never be ready. Never. Please—
Harry stepped past them and made his way up the long walkway. He didn't get far though when the Manor's door opened and out stepped Theo. Harry was genuinely glad to see him. If Theo's home so would Draco. He smiled at Theo as they both strode across the road.
He wrapped his arms around her waist.
- proved undeniably correct. For Kreacher hadn't even blinked and proceeded to bow down for Draco till his nose touched the floor, calling him

"that's a great idea" Harry agreed "but how will we get all the way to moaning Myrtle's bathroom without being seen by someone"
“Yes Professor Sprout said the same on her evaluations” Augusta stated, “Oh looks like we are starting”
Bella let her Glamour drop showing her eyes, pointed ears, changes to her hair and face, and tattoos. She looked at Edward to gauge his reaction.
Students are allowed 2 extra classes or 3 if one is Astronomy.
Just then Draco returned with the other two and they all began to set the plan in motion.
"Alright so tomorrow it is" Draco said "Father and Remus should be at the airport as quickly as possible"
"What is Foxwood manor?" Hermione asked
Returning to Foxwood manor everyone went about reading their textbooks and picking out their classes.
"No," Bella said "he had one it was just completely unintentional in its making. That is how he was able to come back. However he used it up so hes back and that is it no redos."

Ok guys i really need the votes for the mpreg stuff. While the pregnancy chapters are some of the last the sex scenes are coming up. Please comment even uf you are just a guest and let me know
"Of course," Remus breathed out
Posted by accident
"It was," Bella nodded "gone now. poof out of existence."
Suddenly she skidded to a halt, "actually," she said "it would take too long here why don't we all go down to the chamber of secrets it's more secure and all of our stuff is down there already"
"THATS REAL" the wizards and witch shouted
"Ladies First" Bella cried as she started toward the bathroom.
She nodded everyone grabbed the luggage and started to walk in the pub.
She then began to sing and as she did a soft white light came from her hands and sunk into Harry.
Apparition lessons may also be taken during the appointed time for a fee of 12 galleon

“Bloodquill exposure for at least 4 months, he got detention for 4 hours every 2 or 3 days. On top of that from the tests that Sev and Sirius have done he has about 80% of his core blocked.

"Let us move on to the next charge" Amelia Bones said "There will be no altering of the charge as it stands"
She turned to Lucius,
That's all the male pairings that I can remember that I put down if that changes I will gladly update it to the poll just let me know

The group then headed out to explore the rest of the manor and to be seen to their rooms. The spiraling staircase was daunting, even if it did not wobble or show signs of weakness under their feet. As they climbed Bella explained that the second and third floors were composed of bedrooms and studies.
Outstanding (O)
"Now," she started calmly, "all of us are going to sit down and have a decent conversation about what happened. And before you make any rash decisions, im going to tell you some things that might actually change your minds. Don't you get it Im not leaving or letting you leave. At least not until you know so that you can make an informed decision."

to protect Draco. Merlin. Harry was doomed. He couldn't help but touch Draco's hand tentatively.
Harry blushed. Draco kissed him on both cheeks, before turning around, picking up a handful of Floo powder, and disappearing in a cloud of green.
-"Salazar, Theo! Don't hold back on my account. Im a big boy, I can take the truth. Don't sugar-coat anything, darling."
Black to his death?"
He whispered a profanity and moved towards Draco, dropped down on his knees before him and clutched his legs.

-"I CANT LEAVE. LET ME LIVE."
-"You wound me, Father dearest."
-"I can't believe you made me come here tonight. It's new year's eve! Blaise and I have been invited to the ministry's party. Do you know how many gossip I'd have scrounged. What a waste. Everyone would be there." Pansy complained.
-"Pathetic." He said.
The moment they were alone and safely inside the empty drawing room, Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's waist and pulled him in for a desperate embrace. Draco wrapped his own arms around Harry's neck and said nothing.
She blinked in surprise.
' Pansy had made them attend to that weekend, confiding in Harry that he'd only pretended to hate it for being contrary's sake but secretly loved it and really wanted to see it again, or maybe another movie, maybe a different genre too since he didn't appreciate the sad ending and it'd made him cry, and did Harry know an actor named Tom Felton? Another called Jason Isaacs? They were pretty good, and did Harry have a muggle TV at home? And what did Harry think about Draco sneaking in a TV for his room? Would Pansy find it despite a good disillusionment charm? That cow was shrewd like a hawk, Draco laughed.
accept this! My wife just died. Get up." He snarled.
world.
So, the next day, Harry shoved away all his Gryffindor chivalry and principles and reminded them that he was Harry Potter, didn't they recognize him? He'd defeated Voldemort! When the house-elf on open-the-door-to-Potter-and-tell-him-to-fuck-off duty, for the day, merely stared at him unimpressed, Harry ground his teeth and blurted out that he was Dobby's friend. The house-elf's enormous eyes had instantly welled up in tears and he'd ended up comforting the house-elf for a good hour before she sputtered that she'd been neglecting her chores and ran inside, scandalized, leaving Harry by the door, alone, mortified and ashamed of himself for using Dobby's memory, yet no more closer to his goal.

bed. Great. Why hadn't he said anything to Ginny when she'd come by? Did he even know who it was? That it was Draco? Obviously Kreacher knew, he was part of the house after all—
Harry's psychogenic suffering was so terrible, he had to bail on Ginny when she'd dragged him to accompany her for a check-up at St Mungo's. He'd been seated next to her in the waiting area when the omnipresent pain of separation had him nearly faint and topple over. It didn't help that he was underfed and dehydrated. They'd had to usher him for a check-up of his own, Ginny had been so worried.
-"No one compares to you, Theo. Not even
Harry obviously couldn't risk calling, visiting or owling him, but if nothing else, he would make sure Ginny's pregnancy reaches the news. Draco would understand then that Harry meant it when he'd said he loved him and would always love him, and he would also understand why he couldn't be with him anymore, for Draco was a Father too.
-"Oh, please, like you can afford to take me out, I'm high maintenance, darling."

Which is why everything Draco Malfoy'd said had hit home.
Draco sighed.
-"You know I can neither confirm or deny that." Blaise said seriously. Draco raised an eyebrow.  Blaise smirked and winked.
So Harry Potter skulked for two hours outside the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures waiting for lunch two-hour.
What do u think about Theo?
-"Language!" Scorpius said. "And you can't go, because I'm little and can't go. If I don't go, Oncle Greg and Daddy don't go, if Daddy dont go, Oncle Théo don't go, if you go alone with Auntie Pansy you fight and ruin wedding."
-"We didn't plan to do it, we were just too tired and slept. Your uncle Greg didn't sleep with us either. We'll have one soon, I promise." Theo said.
But no more. Harry Potter was about to see him at last. He ran faster.
-"IM FUCKING TIED UP HERE DONT YOU SEE."
Draco Malfoy was fucking with his mind. Harry didn't want to leave him alone. He pissed Harry off, he brought out the worst in him, he was fucking arrogant and snobbish, Harry hated him. The need to know everything there was to know about Malfoy started to bubble inside Harry. Harry wasn't used to not knowing him. Harry knew him goddamn it, yet, he didn't. He wanted to. Everything. He
-"FUCK YOU! WHY ARE YOU HERE? DID YOU FOLLOW ME ALL THIS WAY TO—"
to move on from my best friend's
-"Do you think I'm up to something again, Potter? You seriously have issues. Are you going to stalk me again? Try to kill me again? Prove I was a dedicated Death-Eater after all?" Draco regarded him with disdain. He honestly didn't care what Potter wanted or thought. Potter's words held no importance, didn't elicit anger nor irritation like they once used to. Not anymore. He felt indifferent. Tired.
Harry was suffering, but isn't that what Draco wanted, someone to suffer
-"Really? How did he react?"
Oh shit.
A match made in Hell.
Oh, well, it's fucking happening then.
he felt on display.
-"I'll be alright, Theo. Please trust me. I promise I'll live. And you and I will need to talk. We should've talked sooner. There are things—we'll talk tonight, alright?"
These people loved Harry. Perhaps he'd loved them too, once. But he couldn't recall any of that love anymore. How could he when he'd given up any chance at real happiness he'd ever have?
Draco was relentless and succeeded in dragging her fully down. She kicked his shin from her position on the ground. It stung. Draco shouted obscenities at her, clutched his most likely broken shin, lost his balance and promptly fell atop her. She kneed him in the ribs, rolled them sideways and ended up sitting on top. Pansy, smirked like the evil witch that she is and pointed her wand at his throat—Only to find Draco's wand, already poking her own belly.

Zabini, the bane of Harry's existence, was lounging on another splendid leather sofa, smirking maliciously, not hiding his enjoyment, gloating and mocking Harry as plain as day, wearing, unsurprisingly, a dark Slytherin-green silky robe. A glass of some fancy wine Harry couldn't afford nor know the name of in his hand. He outright burst out cackling at the sight of Harry, like Harry's humiliation and lack of comfort entertained him greatly, and they
-"Fuck. Where's Scorpius?"

He'd been back two weeks ago. Theo hadn't been happy about it, but Draco was better. Or, in all honesty, feeling as good as he'll ever be.
-"What?"
soft and silky smooth and reaches all the way to my shoulder blades." Draco preened. "You can brush it as much as you want, darling." Draco said. Throwing more air kisses in Théo's direction.
-"Why aren't you together then?" He hated that he needed to ask, but he had to. He had to. He'd go mad if he didn't. Harry held his breath, dreading Draco's answer.
He distantly registered Pansy and Theo holding him. But his heart terribly ached, his world ended and he couldn't even remember it ending.
Theo dropped his cigarette, stepped on it and hugged Draco. He planted his head on Draco's shoulder and sighed. "Can't we just go home?"
-"I hadn't gotten out of bed for two weeks, Harry. I had a Major Depressive Episode. I slept through most of it. I'd felt like shit and couldn't even see my son." Draco delivered flatly.
Multiple courses later, for Harry had lost count and hadn't recognized
potentially ruin lives. Then, he remembered, that she literally knew his underwear size and that she loved him, unconditionally, and relaxed. The fucking cow. Impressive, though.
-"Listen, Harry," The utterance of his name out of Draco's lips sounded like an endearment, Harry's heart soared in his chest, "Sometimes, some people, find themselves in a crossroad in life, they're often not particularly lost, yet the different turns and the different lives they might lead to can be quite tempting... Most people shy away from these unknown and consequently daunting paths—except you're Harry Potter," Draco smiled at him teasingly. Whereupon his expression turned serious and forlorn, "What im saying is you are in a crossroad. But, please, don't follow the path that leads you to me. It will never end. It'd be a long, unending, fruitless journey towards nothing but loss and pain. Because I'm not really there, Harry. It's just a mirage, an optical illusion— wishful thinking. I'm telling you, I can
Harry Potter desperately wanted, needed,
Ginny had come home last Tuesday evening. Harry hadn't known she was coming and even if he did, it wouldn't have changed his state of utter shock and odd
Scorpius was delighted to be invited to a grownups party. And proceeded to call upon his grandma Cissy to assist him in picking the perfect attire.
Harry was horrified, Draco was crumbling down, falling apart into small sharp-edged fragments that hurt each other and themselves and the whole they've been once a part of, and Harry's body, instinctively, moved to Draco to prevent him disintegrating.
Yet, it was true. Astoria had been ill for months, had been
Theo had never known Draco to be in such pain. During the war Draco'd clung with all his might to the hope, the flimsy promise that The Dark Lord wouldn't hurt them as long as they remained faithful servants to him.
Scorpius beamed brightly at Draco, apparently satisfied, for

Harry wished he could touch him. His hands twitched with the need to touch Draco. Reassure him. Comfort him. Fight his demons. Do something. Anything. Everything. Hold him. Help. Protect. Save.

For hours.
didn't have the energy to do this. He was afraid he'd be overwhelmed and start crying again - he was emotionally unstable at the best of times these days.
-"They're sleeping together.
Hermione wouldn't look him in the eye, she nodded.
Ten points to Slytherin.
-"Potter," cut in Draco. He smiled, amused at Harry visibly getting worked up by the second.
Harry had a glimpse of the old Draco for the first time since he'd seen him again. He suddenly remembered Draco jeering at him, bullying him and his friends, calling Hermione a mudblood, deriding Ron for being poor, trying to get Hagrid fired, calling Harry names, mocking him for being an orphan. . .Merlin. How had Harry forgotten how unkind and spiteful Draco truly was?
-"The letters, they read them. All of them."
-"Eight years. You were very young when you got married."
It was new year's eve, and Draco, Pansy, Blaise and Theo were racing down the stairs to the sunroom. Which was their
-"But the truth is. I'd been talking to Potter—" Theo tensed and pulled away. He cupped Draco's face in his hands.
-"Fudge off. I'm actually here on ministry business. To further discuss what Granger had asked you to consider last night. So, have you considered?"
Draco sighed tiredly, closing his eyes, a few tears squeezed out.
-"How's Nott okey with any of this? With Astoria, with. . . I suppose, with me? He loves you, he's in love with you, it's as clear as day."
Théo felt a sharp pang of pain in his chest. Because Draco would have never shown weakness to his son. His own father had been larger than life in his eyes, always there for Draco to lean on him, to learn from him, to childishly imitate him. So, during the war when The Dark Lord had treated Lucius like he was lesser than vermin - It had been a shocking and heart-wrenching thing to see.
“So, you’re Harry? Like,
“Me neither,” Ginny said, shuddering. “But it’s easier to breathe here.”
“I don’t know,” he said slowly, pondering what to answer. “I think somewhere where there’s no pain. Somewhere where we can have peace.”
Draco chuckled. “There’s nothing tough in me, though.”
“What are you planning?” Draco asked.
“Harry, what on earth happened to you?” Hermione exclaimed as Harry sat down on the Gryffindor table, still covered by his own blood.
Harry scanned the room, trying to find some familiar faces. It seemed like almost all the eighth and seventh-years were there, which made the rather small common room feel horribly crowded and too warm.
“Oh… Er… I haven’t really had time to think about that. Us, I mean” Harry said, fidgeting with his sleeve.
Hey love, tell me
“Er, maybe. I mean, I had seen Zabini with Ginny a couple of times, yeah.”
“And those firefighters, they’re hot?”
“As if I cared,” Draco said, grunting.
When Harry was sure there was no one else nearby, he took Draco’s hand gently, and for the first time that day, the expression on Draco’s face showed some emotion behind the walls.
The week continued grey and gloomy, and Harry could swear he had never felt so tired before. On Thursday, Harry was on his way back to the common room after dinner, alone, as Ron and Hermione had eaten all too fast, looking like they had been in a hurry to have some couple time. Merlin, Harry was so done for that day. He wouldn’t speak to anyone in the common room, he would just walk straight into his and Ron’s room and –
“Just sit down on my bed,” Harry said, pointing the bed on the right as he opened his trunk.
Even though the Great Hall had already been almost entirely full when Draco had come in with his lackeys, they had had no problem in finding a good spot in the front row right in front of the dance floor. Or finding might not be a very accurate word in the Slytherin context, they had rather made a spot for themselves by elbowing and jinxing other students when necessary.
“That sounds a good idea,” Hermione said, approving. “It goes well with Expelliarmus and there’re still some who don’t master it yet, so we could practise them both at the same time.”
Draco sighed heavily. He had relaxed a bit, but he looked still somewhat gloomy. “It’s not like I could really judge you.”
--*--*--*--*--
“I do! Or no. Or, I mean… I don’t know,” Harry spluttered, feeling suddenly like wanting nothing else than to sink through the ground.
“Er, maybe. But I kind of promised to keep his identity as a secret,” Harry said, running his fingers through his hair.
“So, erm, did you tell Zabini about the Room?” Harry asked, trying to change the subject.
“Harry, you live with the Muggles, you ought to know better than this.”
But Harry didn’t care about fairness. Instead, he was enjoying his advantage far too much by trying to find new spots that would make Draco squirm even more desperately.
And all the broken promises.
“A very good morning indeed,” Harry whispered, lifting Draco’s head to kiss him on the mouth. “You know, I’m running late, haven’t eaten breakfast yet.”
Harry’s mouth fell slightly open. He had probably never experienced anything that magical, taking into account he was a wizard after all.
“To Sirius,” the other three said in unison, raising their glasses and taking a sip. Harry was so unused to stronger liquors Firewhisky almost spurted out of his mouth, but he managed to swallow it eventually.
“Yes, though I think it’s nice to have some company,” Draco said, shrugging.
should have realized. I’m sorry, I do really am,” Draco said firmly. “But you had at least your Muggle family, right?”
Malfoy had just sat down on the table, as far from Parkinson as possible. Parkinson was shooting daggers at Malfoy’s direction, but Malfoy ignored her. When Harry studied Malfoy’s expression more carefully, he noticed that the Slytherin had black circles around his eyes as if he hadn’t slept at all last night.
Harry sighed heavily and explained everything he knew about the Horcruxes: how Voldemort had learned to create them, how many of them he had created, where he had hidden them, about the Horcrux hunt with Ron and Hermione, and about Harry having been a Horcrux Voldemort had never planned to make.
“I know!” Hermione cried, sounding at least as angry as Harry. “We’ve tried to tell this to the Wizengamot only Merlin knows how many times, but they don’t listen to us! They think we’re still in the middle of the War or at least in a partly similar situation as that.”
“Haven’t you thought about telling your other friends, too?” Sirius asked, sounding a bit worried. “It’s exhausting to keep secrets, especially from your best friends.”
Draco relaxed as he heard he’d get to keep his anonymity. “I suppose that’s a good idea,” Draco said to Harry’s surprise. “It’s helped me a lot to be able to talk with Blaise about us, it’d be good if you had someone to talk to as well.”
“That sounds… I don’t know,
“No,” Harry snapped, sounding more annoyed than he had meant to.
“We could come with you,” Hermione said, starting to get up.
“If you say so,” Draco said as he sat down beside Harry and poked Harry on the nose with one of the roses. “So, how did you explain to your little friends you’re not joining them to Hogsmeade today?”
Then he hurried to the dormitory and slumped right to his bed, without even changing clothes. That night Harry slept restlessly, having blurry dreams about Draco Malfoy’s foggy, grey eyes and warm and desperate kisses.
“We’ll see about that,” Draco said, smiling mischievously as he stood up. “I think I’m heading back inside. With my skin type it’s definitely possible to get sunburned even in October.”
“Are you still wondering if Malfoy’s doing something for Voldemort? Harry, please, you said it yourself last year. Voldemort wouldn’t recruit underage wizards,” Hermione said, frustrated.
“You already knew about that, you know, the Occlumency lessons and all,” Harry said.
“I asked,” Snape started again, seething. “Is that clear?”
side. He had known for a long time towards the end of the War that his family wouldn’t have survived if the Dark Lord had won. The mistakes they had made had been so huge that they had quickly descended to the lowest, most despised level in the Death Eater ranks. There was no way their mistakes would have been forgiven; the Dark Lord didn’t even know the whole fucking concept of forgiveness. But it had come as a big surprise to Draco that even the holy and pure light side had forgotten the same concept completely. After the War, he hadn’t expected any coddling or patting on the shoulder, and he hadn’t even dreamed of being able to avoid a sentence in Azkaban, but neither had he been able to even imagine that the winning side would require him to give up his life.
Draco was quiet for a while but didn’t stop petting Harry’s hair this time. “I was an utter prat, weren’t I?” he said, sighing. “Do you believe me if I say I’m not the same anymore?” he asked, sounding a bit desperate.
Zabini gasped. “Can you really transport yourself somewhere else using that contraption?”
“I’d better go now. I need to still find Blaise,” Malfoy said, pulling his hands from Harry’s hair.
Harry was still frozen to the spot as all thoughts had left his mind. He could do nothing but stare unbelievingly at Malfoy with wide eyes until Malfoy turned around and started running towards the dungeons.
“Take a slice of cake,” Lucius repeated firmly.
“No, Draco, you’ve got to think this over by yourself. Tell me when you’ve come to some kind of conclusion,” Harry said coldly, turned on his heel and left Draco alone in the Room.
for Harry. The git had never shown any empathy to Harry before, and now Harry couldn’t forget the way Malfoy had cleaned his cut so carefully and worried over his curse wound. But in the end, it all came down to Malfoy’s
“Christ, you’re such a cheater,” Harry said, laughing and trying to open Draco’s hand.
“Well, I actually do have something for you,” Harry said, feeling Draco’s hands slipping under his shirt.
Without saying a word, Draco laid down on the couch next to Harry and gathered Harry into his arms.
“Yes?” Harry asked quickly, the feeling of relief spreading all over his body as he realised Malfoy was still there.
“’Course,” Ron said bitterly, stuffing another Chocolate Frog into his mouth.
“Harry,” Ginny said, looking deep into his eyes with her warm brown eyes. “It’s okay
“Well, Zabini’s not too bad, he’s just, erm, a bit weird. And it’s nice there’s someone who knows.”
“Fine, fine,” Harry said, not daring to question Hermione’s arguments anymore. Not that he would have any new counterarguments left, to be honest. He stood up, grabbed his Map, and exited the common room, leaving his grinning friends behind him.
“Er, he’s sent a couple of messages.”
“Well, from what I’ve gathered, the word Death Eater means someone who’s Voldemort’s follower and who bears the Dark Mark. It’s not like you take the Mark for fun, like a tattoo or something,” Harry said gloomily.
“But what if I’m evil somehow?” Harry blurted out before he could stop himself. “Or will become evil? Voldemort told me some years ago there are many similarities between him and me, and we have almost identical backgrounds. And no one knows how to explain the connection between us, and it’s definitely not a normal one.”
, Draco, I’ve been waiting for ages. I’ve got to tell you –” Harry began but stopped abruptly as he noticed how the other boy looked. Draco was trembling slightly, he was white as a sheet, and his eyes looked somehow… empty. “What’s going on? Did something happen at McGonagall’s detention?” Harry asked, touching Draco’s arm lightly, making him startle.
Luckily, the corridors were deserted as everybody was probably still eating, and Snape’s office was only behind a corner.
“I cannot be gay,” Malfoy said, panicked and breathing heavily.
“Yeah, it’s almost too hot for even flying,” Ginny said, emptying her first glass in seconds and pouring another one right after.
“’Course, knew you wouldn’t survive a night without me,” Ron said, grinning and starting towards the staircase.
Molly looked pensive for a while. “Trust is an interesting thing, it’s so easy to break but difficult to rebuild. But I hope you’d trust life, it carries us no matter what happens. And sometimes we just have to do things that scare us, it’s not living if we let our fears have too much control over us.”
“Really?”
Draco took the book carefully in his hands and started turning pages. “Why aren’t they moving?” he asked as he poked the pictures.
“Erm,” Ginny said, giving Harry a significant look.
“All the more reason to seduce you. He’s obviously trying to bond with you over your similar experiences,” Ron said, still grinning teasingly. “There’s no such thing as a free lunch, you know.”
Ginny sighed. “I can’t say I’d like him or trust him, but the things Blaise mentioned about the pureblood culture… Let’s just say I can only imagine how Malfoy must be struggling.”
It had been exactly two months since the Battle of Hogwarts, and he, Harry, an almost 18-year-old guy, was about to get drunk for the very first time in his life.
Before Harry, who felt like he was sort of rooted to the spot, had time to even stand up, Ron had bolted to the window, opened it and snatched the paper from the owl’s claws, putting simultaneously sloppily a few sickles into the small pouch that was tied to its leg. Before leaving, the owl gave Ron a rather offended look, which Ron didn’t seem to notice at all as he slammed the window shut right in front of its beak. As Ron started to scan through the paper, Hermione came hurriedly to stand next to him, trying to get a peek of the paper, too. After a while, Ron’s hands stopped abruptly turning the pages as he had apparently found the page he had been looking for. If the situation hadn’t been serious, Harry would have probably laughed at his friends whose eyes widened comically and mouths snapped open as they stared at the paper, looking like they had just read the aliens had landed in London and were now about to conquer the Earth.
All the Slytherins turned their heads, trying to see what Blaise was talking about. "The one with Krum, is it really the Mudblood?" Pansy shrieked, eyes widening in amaze when she saw Granger walking and smiling widely in her floaty, periwinkle-blue dress robes. Not only were her dress robes dashing, someone had done miracles to her usually-so-bushy hair as well.
“Hey, mate, Earth is calling,” Ron said, waving his hand in front of Harry’s eyes at dinner.
“Besides, you two picking fights with Malfoy and his gang wouldn’t really help you to get permission to play Quidditch if Umbridge got to know about that.”
“Mr Potter, may I ask what on Earth you are doing here?” the Auror asked, looking confused and turning his gaze slowly from Potter to Draco, who Potter suddenly began to squeeze tighter against himself as if to heroically protect him or something. “
“How did it go?”
“Draco, one of my best friends almost died! You must tell me what’s going on!” Harry exclaimed. “Who did give the mead to Slughorn? Who did they try to kill? How do you know about all this? Why do you always disappear from my Map? What are you doing here in –”
“What?” Draco cried, his heart skipping a beat.
“Why what?” Blaise asked, raising an eyebrow.
“I don’t want to, at least not yet. I know they mean well, but they’d pester me with this until I told them, or they got to know some other way,” Harry explained. “You’re not going to tell them either?”
” Harry heard another voice calling him quietly from somewhere behind the mist. “
“Well?” Harry asked, impatient.
Draco looked at Harry, disbelieving. “You can’t be serious. He’s only overreacting, he always does that,” Draco said. “Besides, there’s no way I’m going to let go of you now that I’ve finally got you.”
Harry let go of Malfoy’s robes stepping backwards, and he felt immediately strangely cold as the git’s body wasn’t pressed against his own anymore. Harry glanced at Malfoy once more and saw the Malfoy mask back in its place.
--*--*--*--*--
The school corridors were flooding with happily chattering people. Most of the exams were behind, summer holidays were right around the corner, and even the sun seemed to be celebrating along with the students, shining brightly on a cloudless sky. The light and cheerful atmosphere engulfed everybody, letting them dive into the sense of upcoming freedom.
“So, what should we do know?” Blaise asked in a low voice.
“Don’t thank me. This is your home, you’re always welcome here,” Andromeda said. “Now, how about your school supplies?”
The Christmas Eve Harry felt much lighter than in days. The festive and cheerful atmosphere filled Grimmauld Place with laughter, joy, good food, and warm hugs. Harry had lost count on how many times Molly had pulled him into a tight hug, telling him how she cared for him as if he was her own son. Fred and George, on the other hand, took care that people couldn’t get all too weepy and emotional as they had hidden their Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes’ test products all over the house.
” Granger asked.
” Weasley said.
Malfoy watched Harry’s band-aid suspiciously. “What does it do?”
“Yes, it does. She’s done a good job,” Hermione said, looking at Harry’s nose approvingly.
Andromeda looked at Draco with sad eyes. “I know it’s extremely hard for you right now. I just wish you could confide with the friends you have and talk to them when you feel sad or anxious,” she said. “Talk with Ginny at least. She seems to care for you genuinely, and as far as I know her, she’s a good person with whom you can be yourself.”
Ginny burst out laughing. “Why do you think I’d be able to speak Norwegian?”
“Yes,” Malfoy whispered, leaning to kiss Harry for one more time.
“So, shall we go or –” Draco began until he noticed who Ginny and Blaise were talking to. “Oh.”
They landed collapsing roughly on the ground on the shore of Black Lake. It was actually the exact same spot as last time, though this time it was much colder there. Some of the trees had changed their colours from green to different variations of orange, red and yellow, and Harry could nothing but just admire them, even though the grey and cloudy sky didn’t really flatter them.
“Our brains create a lot of thought patterns during our childhood and adolescence as the groundwork is laid then. If you’ve got a healthy and good childhood and adolescence, your brain creates a lot of positive thought patterns that form thoughts like
“There’s no way she could love me,” Draco said gloomily. “She wouldn’t have done what she did if she loved me.”
Harry sighed. “Yes, I just – What about your friends?”
Again, not 100% if my Norwegian is grammatically correct but I tried my best!
That was until both Harry and Draco came violently crashing down, rolling over one another as they both had apparently forgotten how close to the ground the snitch had actually been.
Harry?” A young, dark-haired woman, Anne, asked, looking at Harry with her light-blue eyes.
“The Dark Lord wasn’t happy with my father as he had screwed up his plan and landed himself in Azkaban, so he wanted me to become some kind of a replacement for my father.”
Draco had never met Sirius, or at least not when he would’ve been old enough to remember him. But he had heard about him quite a lot, so it felt like he actually had known him on some level.
Harry stared at Draco, looking flabbergasted. He was probably so used to seeing only the side of Draco who cared about nothing else but saving his own skin, no matter what. “Why not?”
carrying these bloody trays around like some sort of a common servant?”
“Don’t be silly, Draco, of course you’re coming,” Ginny said firmly. “Besides, Blaise and Hermione are just going to watch, and we need an even number of players.”
But it didn’t matter that Draco refused to tell him because Harry could see it in his face. “You know something about the necklace?” Harry asked, feeling suddenly as if someone had poured cold water in his veins.
state of emergency! The War’s over for fuck’s sake,” Harry cursed, feeling the anger boiling inside him.
That finally seemed to make Draco snap out of his coma-like state. He pulled back from Harry’s touch, taking a few steps backwards.
“Narcissa isn’t a Death Eater. No one has talked anything about her sentence yet.”
“I just hate it when people call me by my last name," Draco began, making Harry startle, surprised. "I know Weasley didn’t do it on purpose as I’m rather sure Hermione has told him to use my first name or even ferret instead, but old habits die hard, I guess,” he continued in a sad voice. “I just don’t know what to do because every time someone calls me by my last name, I remember immediately how my parents made it clear they don’t have a son and that I’m as good as dead to them.”
Malfoy looked perplexed and took a moment before answering. “So, you’re saying that you haven’t told him anything?”
Then, finally, Malfoy strode into the Great Hall, hand in hand with Parkinson. Harry clenched his teeth but forced himself to keep a deadpan face. He had known this would be coming, so there was no reason to get annoyed. Still, he felt something coiling nastily in his stomach when he watched as Parkinson filled Malfoy’s plate again and kissed him on the cheek.
“Lucius,” Ron said in a grim voice. “Not that I’d see the world losing that much by executing him –
“Draco, as Draco Malfoy,” Harry said more confidently now, meeting Ginny’s eyes.
“Wasn’t my story to tell,” Ginny said, shrugging.
--*--*--*--*--
“You know, you could ask him to join us sometime,” Harry said, taking a bite of the treacle tart.
--*--*--*--*--
“Yes. Blaise told me.”
“What fine? Is the Chosen One really this easy to tame? I had wished for a bit more challenge you know, as I promised to be
“It’s going to get better soon, this situation can’t go on like this forever.”
When Harry had finished his breakfast, said bye to all the Weasleys, and hugged Molly probably for the fifth time that morning, Harry headed out and Apparated straight to Andromeda’s countryside cottage.
“Don’t want to talk about that,” Harry said, looking grimly at the ground. “Nothing too bad happened, really, let’s just say they didn’t… consider me as a part of their family.”
“Shh, Dobby, please, keep quiet,” Draco said, trying to make Dobby calm down. “Yes, I think he is in trouble, but I’m not sure. Have you seen him anywhere today?”
The house being full of life was definitely lifting everyone’s Christmas spirit a lot, but none of them could ignore the loss of Fred and other people who they had lost during the War. Christmas seemed to be a bittersweet experience especially for Molly as she clearly enjoyed having so many people around her but at the same time, the absence of one of her sons felt occasionally too much, making her burst into tears. Harry was happy Andromeda, Draco and Teddy had joined them as following Teddy’s pure joy when he was exploring the house and opening his presents made everyone feel somewhat better whenever the grief started to feel too pressing.
“I know,” Harry sighed and gave Blaise a little smile. “You know, you can appear rather threatening sometimes.”
good reason for this,” Draco snapped angrily, breaking the kiss. “Here,” he said, throwing the shirt back at Harry. “I’ll go and tell the whoever there is to sod off. You come when you’re dressed.”
Harry sighed heavily. “Okay, sorry. I know I wasn’t there, so I don’t know what it was like.”
“Malfoy,” Harry answered, failing quite badly at sounding cold as the corner of his mouth was twisting too much. He took Draco’s hand firmly in his own and knocked their thighs together.
“Yes, or, um,” Harry said, spluttering. “I want you back. If you still want me, that is,” he blurted out, looking Draco straight in the eye with his bottomlessly green eyes.
The mere thought of someone being inside his head again sent shivers down Harry’s spine. It had been more than enough for one lifetime to have had one maniac inside his head practically until Voldemort’s end, and Harry would preferably just keep his head all by himself in future, thankyouverymuch. But there was no way Malfoy could really be inside Harry’s head, right? Voldemort’s ability to come inside Harry’s head had been solely and exclusively due to the failed
“Well, no, but what I don’t get is that why it has to be you who’s in the front line. Why don’t
“Just wondering how to hex the git. Bet it was him who was the mastermind behind today’s episode,” Harry muttered, turning his gaze to his plate.
“Because he’s chosen his side.”
“Well, I just started to study like two hours ago. You can’t expect me to be totally fluent by now,” Ron said, shrugging. “’Mione promised to help me to translate the magazines. And you can learn quite a lot just by watching, they’ve some really clear slow-motion pictures.”
“We’re going to swim,” Harry said on a whim, not really thinking about what he had just said.
“No you didn’t,” Ginny said.
“No, don’t, you don’t have to because of me –”
Harry laughed. “He seems to have a thing with winking.”
“I know that you git. I’ll go first, and you can hold as long distance as you want,” Harry said and started towards the staircase.
“Oh, the television,” Blaise said.
“No, you git. Your fierceness,” Draco said. “Although not when you’re using it against me.”
“Hm?”
, so everybody had always told him. Whatever it happened to mean.
“Er,” Harry said, blushing, while Draco snorted next to him, pretending to be annoyed but ending up sounding rather amused.
As rapidly as Harry’s mood had lifted a fraction because of coming back to Hogwarts, as rapidly had it come crashing back down. The first days of the school year had made Harry sulky and angry for a number of reasons, and the list just felt like growing more and more each day. The lessons had started awfully with Potions where Snape had given Harry a hard time because he had made a couple of mistakes brewing the Draught of Peace. Harry knew that his potion hadn’t been even the worst attempt in the class, but he still had got all the blame. And what was worse, in front of sniggering Malfoy and other Slytherins. As if Potions hadn’t been enough, Harry had also managed to get detention for every evening for the first week because of telling the truth about Voldemort’s return in the first Defence lesson with Umbridge. Harry was frantic. He had got detention many times during his years at Hogwarts, and usually for valid reasons, but never for telling the truth.
Harry took a long breath in to make himself calm down. They hadn’t really talked that much about the war looming around the corner, and Harry would’ve loved to go on ignoring that topic altogether. “So, the Death Eaters must really trust you?”
Draco laughed. “You do realize he’s mostly only joking? I don’t even get it how he’s in Slytherin as he couldn’t care less about the so-called pureblood shite, as he calls it,” Draco said. “Though he’s cunning as hell, that I have to give him.”
“Harry, are you sure you can trust Dobby?” Hermione asked, biting her lower lip suspiciously. “Don’t take me wrong, I do like Dobby, but you remember what happened last time he tried to help you.”
“Fuck you, Draco,” Harry said coldly as he tried to make the bleeding stop.
“Harry,” Draco said, surprised. “Didn’t know you’d come here. Thought you were celebrating Weasley’s birthday.”
,” Hermione snapped. “That’s not a valid reason. After everything we’ve shared and experienced together since the first year, you still chose to keep something this big from us. That’s not okay.”
Draco didn’t answer, but the someone still turned the door handle, opened the door slowly, and peeked into the room.
At first, Harry was quite proud of how well he stomached seeing Malfoy and Parkinson clinging to each other. They were snogging on the corridors, walking hand in hand in the courtyard, and Parkinson kept on feeding Malfoy as if the git was incapable of eating on his own. However, as the days passed by, Harry could no more ignore the nasty feeling coiling in his stomach with a straight face. He became quite withdrawn around his friends, but he was pretty sure he managed to keep up appearances, at least on some level. He knew he was now doing precisely the opposite than what Hermione had warned him not to do; he was getting led by Malfoy. Or was he? Malfoy hadn’t exactly promised anything, on the contrary, he had said quite clearly to Harry he couldn’t be with him. On the other hand, the git had let Harry kiss and touch him, sending Harry signals that maybe there truly could be something between them. Besides, Harry knew now he shouldn’t have kissed Malfoy. He didn’t care too much for Parkinson, but he still didn’t want anyone to get hurt, not even Parkinson.
Well, Harry could admit his stalking might’ve been slightly, erm, over-enthusiastic during the sixth year, but Malfoy
“One of my weakest moments, it’s never going to repeat,” Draco said, turning the pages again. “And who, in Salazar’s name, do these people think they are?” he asked, pointing at two astronauts next to a space rocket.
Harry barely had time to blink his eyes before Ginny said she was ready with the phones. She turned them on, showing Harry how to do it.
Harry turned his eyes to Blaise. To be honest, he had been so blinded by the thought of choosing sides it hadn’t even crossed his mind there might stand something else for a reason to take the Mark than showing your loyalty. “You know why he took it, then?” Harry asked in a hoarse voice.
Draco breathed in sharply as his utterly exhausted brain registered his true location, and he quickly shut his eyes tightly again.
“I truly hope you are telling me the truth because it was both clumsy and foolish. You are already suspected of having a hand in it,” Snape snarled.
“Er, are you okay with this? I… I don’t really want anything to change,” Harry asked uncertainly.
“Someone else, then?”
“But he’s your father.”
“Quiet!” Snape yelled again. “You end this thing with Draco. Is that clear?”
Harry shrugged. “You can’t really understand something you haven’t experienced yourself.”
After a moment Harry felt Malfoy entwining their pinky fingers tentatively together. Harry inhaled sharply and snapped his eyes open, but he didn’t move his hand away.
“Oh, fuck yeah.”
“I take your word for it,” Harry said, smiling a little. “You wanted to explain why you took the Dark Mark? I think I’m better prepared to listen now.”
As Malfoy noticed Harry, Ron and Hermione approaching, his eyes looked anxious, but his lips curved into a familiar smirk. “Ah, Potter, Weasley! It’ll be interesting to see if Gryffindor is allowed to play, won’t it?” Malfoy said haughtily. “If it’s a question of influence in the Ministry, you’ll definitely have no problems with your outstanding connections. My father tells me constantly how much he appreciates the work Arthur Weasley is doing for the whole Wizarding world, regulating all that threatening and improperly used Muggle stuff. Such a dangerous job, would lose my night’s sleep if I didn’t know your father is there protecting us all from the horrendous Muggle contraptions, Weasley,” Malfoy said as other Slytherins were shrieking and howling with laughter. “And as for Potter… My father says it’s a matter of time before the Ministry has you carted off to St. Mungo’s, apparently they’ve got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic.”
“You never learn, don’t you?” Draco said, sighing, as he gave Teddy to Harry nevertheless and opened the baby’s fingers gently from around the strand of his hair. Watching Draco trying to make Teddy let go of his hair, Harry got an odd feeling he would also like to reach for Draco’s hair and touch it, just to see if his hair was still as soft and silky as it had been over a year ago. “I should cut it,” Draco continued suddenly.
She nodded standing up. Suddenly there was a great light and a shower of glitter fell on them all. In Bella's place stood a beautiful hawk. It slowly circled the group before landing in Edward's lap.

“Here would be our room,” she said as she opened the door. The room was a celestial playground of stars, constellations, and otherworldly shades. The stars of the zodiac seemed to spin slowly around the ceiling, as if it was a window to peer directly at the cosmos. The stars along the walls glittered and winked awake, as if they had sensed the new person’s presence. All of the furniture, including a gorgeous vanity next to the bed, sparkled in bright gold, copper, and silver, and the king-sized bed was decked in fabulous, sensual silk colored in indigo.

Oh, Merlin. Harry's life was fucked. He laughed and laughed and laughed and cried while laughing - because he was mad; mad, mad,
They hugged some more before Draco remembered to answer and said "And no, don't bother to talk to him. He's clearly bored and/or having an existential crisis and besides, remember when I constantly riled him up and confronted him and just generally acknowledged his Dumbledore's-boot-licking self?
-"Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please—"
The torment and despair radiating off him in merciless waves didn't push Theodore Nott away. Nothing ever could. He crawled on his knees to Draco and lay on top of him. Soothing him, murmuring comforting reassurances, his heart aching like there was no tomorrow, because if anything happened to Draco there might as well never be one.
-"Harry," Harry said.
With a whoosh, Draco Malfoy stepped out of Harry's foyer. Harry nearly fainted from relief. And not unlike yesterday's fervent welcome, Harry threw himself upon Draco, hugging him tightly,
He had no one to talk to about this. Not even Hermione could help him now.
-"Oh, Merlin! Oh, Merlin and Morgana! You wouldn't believe who's getting all cozied up with Martin from the department of mysteries." She exclaimed, scurrying away in the direction the supposed cozying up was taking place.
Theo hugged him, crushing Draco to his chest, like he wished he could take all his pain away, like he wished he could keep him there, and shelter him from the world forever. Draco had no doubt that he did.
They were hopeless.
-"Lies. I would never. I - yes."
-"Yaaaaay!" Harry said, dryly. And then he remembered that they were soon-to-be-probably-maybe-boyfriends and he jumped around the bedroom, doing a little victory-dance, and hugged Draco tightly while, Draco laughed at him and petted his hair patronizingly, probably thinking Harry had finally renounced his old ways of dressing like a homeless, elderly man and was happy to finally step into the right path of up-scale fashion and pretentiousness alongside Draco. Well, he

-"They were?"
-"So, I guess me, Pansy and the boys are going out tonight." Draco said, amused.
Lightning sadly didn't strike him, so he was very much alive and well when Draco opened his mouth to say more.
They all laughed at him.
Pansy glared at them. Pimky apparated with a couple of bottles of firewhiskey and glasses on a tray. She put the bottles down and gave them each a glass that would refill itself from the bottles on the coffee table, and disapparated.
Draco stared at him unimpressed.
-"Draco, darling. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please." He murmured over and over again.
That an angel came and called my name and took me by the hand.
She smiled.
-"Are you serious, why?"
A grand open-space, a sort of large ostentatious but beautiful drawing-room, elaborately and tastefully decorated, with luxurious, antique, dark-velvety furniture—revealed Harry's worst nightmare.
Draco's tears were unstoppable.
One doesn't whine and write poetry about one's pain when they're still suffering it—And Draco would always suffer his.
-"You like it?"
And then,
-"In another life, Theo. You and I would've been perfect."
And for some reason, there weren't many furnitures about. Which is why, as

Draco thought he felt warm for a while. And it was such a foreign feeling for him, after spending so much time in the fog - that lately he's been thinking that maybe he hadn't always existed in the fog. That maybe this wasn't all there was to life. But he had a very hard time remembering who he was before all of this, or even

-"Oh, Merlin. Knowing someone's favorite brand of underclothes is hardly daunting." Draco said.
Blaise drifted away in another direction. Draco stood on tiptoes but didn't see Theo. He looked back at Greg who was studiously making his way through every dish in the buffet and smiled. He turned to his son.
Draco smirked and Potter's eyes drifted to it. To Draco's lips. Potter leaned in and kissed him.

-"Now, now. It's okey. Dinner's over we can sneak out and have a smoke. I feel like one."

but she felt like her.
-"WHAT?" Draco said distractedly, he moved away from Harry and propped himself up on the pillows behind him.
His eyes wild, mouth hanging open from shock or maybe a silent scream.
She gasped. "Oh, Harry..." And then she moved until half her body pinned down Harry's—they both
Draco's mental faculties were slowed by Alcohol, but as soon as he somewhat understood what the fuck was happening, he clutched at his heart over his clothes and doubled over, resting his forehead against the cool table.

Draco glanced at him, then. And Harry's heart did a somersault inside his chest cavity. Draco was here to see him. He was here for Harry. Or was he? The smile began to fall from his face—No, Draco was presently walking towards him. He really was here for him!
Draco dragged Theo back to his/their now empty office and closed the door.
Draco glared at her some more, and pushing his overwhelming fear of his beautiful, perfect, white-blond hair being tarnished by the evil cow, aside - he sat back down.
She blinked, confused.
After a while, Draco's breathing changed and he was clearly asleep.

-"Nope, can't trust you to really not disapparate."
Everyone took turns kissing Scorpius's rosy cheeks.
Down at the pub, everyone stared at Harry in a weird way. Some of them straight-up glaring.
-"I perfectly speak Italian, darling. Why, we have a Manor quite similar to this one in Florence. We've been there when you were all children, don't you remember, darling?"
Draco was really familiar with fear, he'd been scared during the war, scared during the trials, terrified when Astoria told him about the blood-curse, cripplingly frightened when she was dying—It'd tore at his insides and shredded them mercilessly.
Practically everyone who knew Harry Potter and mainly Ronald Weasley had pointed out to Harry, not so admiringly in Ron's case, that he had a chronic

After a while, he spoke, in a gentle, sad whisper, "I warn you, I'll break your heart." there was even a hint of disbelief in it, like Draco couldn't believe he was saying it, like he'd been on the receiving end of the same words before, like they meant so much to him. A painful memory, an echo of something that someone must've said to him once. It was a pointless warning or a hopeless supplication. Wishful thinking. Whoever'd said it to Draco had known it wouldn't change anything and so had Draco.
-"I'm not sure what Kreacher made, or if he made anything at all since I'm never home for lunch. Do you want me to take you out somewhere nice?"
-"I suppose it's tolerable."

-"Do you regret it?"
Théo got the huge, black, marble bath ready with a flick of his wand. Draco hopped in the bath, settled in, and moaned contentedly.
-"Why, Draco, if I didn't know any better I'd think you're trying to console me." Harry joked. Although it wasn't really a joke and he was suddenly overwhelmed with dread and in equal measures, hope.
Draco would think
He was using Harry, manipulating him, leading him on. But Harry was so far gone, possibly nothing Draco could ever do would deter him.

"sorry I'm late," she said walking up to the group and kissing Lucius on the cheek. "Have we interrupted"
smirking she said, "faerie elf, not uncommon that they mate with wizards or witches. However its diluted so it probably came from Lily's background not James. At least given the eyes."
The next day was the leaving feast and even Dumbledore couldn't manipulate the points enough for Gryffindor to come out on top. As such Ravenclaw won the house cup. They then all went to the train. ron and Hermione were kind enough to create a buffer so Draco and Harry could spend their last few hours together.
"With Harry and Albus abstaining that will take away 41 votes" Arthur said to the twins " Since the chief whugmump is the prosecution he can't vote. That leave 279 votes to decide. The high table won't be needed for a vote but she may have to interfere if the trial goes sideways"
“Ah professor Snape,” She said “Lord Malfoy welcome in today. Nasty business to conduct”
"Forgive our intrusion," Ophelia Strongborn one of the governors said, "we are here for a surprise inspection of all teachers."
"yes what Black," Severus (who had allowed the children to call him that while in private) asked walking out of Salazar Slytherin's potions lab. The man had nearly cried when he saw it although he would kill you if you said that.
so real quick for timeline sake, i am changing the years to where it is harry potter timeline. also to fit into the whole birthday scenerio i am changing bella's birthday to be DEC 21st the winter solstice.
"Ah" Ron Said.
Defense: confronting the faceless
Going into to Ministry of Magic Lucius escorted Bella and Severus along with Harry and Sirius hidden under the invisibility cloak.
Head of the Board of Governors
"What," she said, "its not like anyone else can do that its just me."
“Tinsel,” she said, “please take our luggage to the Chamber of Secrets in Hogwarts, then I want you and five other elves to start cleaning and prepping the rooms. There is a dead Basilisk in there I want you to separate all of the parts into their correct containers and put them in the potions lab. The bags are marked please put Esme/Carlisle in the same room, then Alice/Jasper, Rosalie/Emmett, and Edward and myself.”
"If we make Tom sane again we could probably get Peter turned over and free Sirius," Remus said thinking
“A few introductions to be made” Stated Arthur “My sons Fred and George have reached majority and are prepared to take the Prewett seat as in their familial will.”
“Age is the answer for the most part. There is no creature involvement from what we know. True my family has vela but its at such a low percentage it would not make any difference.” Lucius responded, “The boys started courting when they were twelve but Harry’s home situation combined with pretending to hate each other has caused a strain.”
BELLAS OUTFIT ON FLIGHT TO LONDON FROM NOW ON SHE WILL ONLY HAVE A GLAMOUR ON IN THE MUGGLE WORLD
The next meeting started with Dumbledore bringing up what happened to Vernon dursley and the house being destroyed. Immedietly the room was in uproar.
"As far as the
The Sacred Twenty-Eight were, according to the author of the Pure-Blood Directory (widely believed to have been Cantankerus Nott), the twenty-eight British families that were still "truly pure-blood" by the 1930s.(Holds 10 votes of the Wizengmot)
LADIES FIRST:
"I'll be on the next plane out." She said to him nodding, "I can't get all the way over there on my own magic and the boat would take to long."
"you all enter," Bella replied," Lucius, Remus, and Sirius in padfoot form will stay out here with the Cullens and I. Should you need us, which you more than likely will, call us and I will make my entrance. if not then we go with the original plan and wait until Tom is healed."
Remus/sirius
"and did he?" Hermione asked
"When did it happen? Who did it?" Hermione asked
"What is a Horcrux?" Harry asked
Griphook went the get the racket bells when Bella stopped him. Walking up to the dragon she began to pet and croon to him, five minutes later he was asleep. Turning around she saw everyone staring at her.
New required courses for which textbooks have already been bought:
"Now lets not be to hasty Sirius" Dumbledore
 Black (N LEANING ON D)
Then Bella turned back. "Myself and my brothers each have a bird form. I am a hawk, Puck is a raven, and Jareth is a barn owl. Although the transformation can be messy sometimes. I would keep an eye on you each time the Cullens went hunting"
Suddenly Harry heard a series of cracks and the door was blasted off its hinges He saw a bunch of people in black robes almost like they were death eaters that without the masks he could see that it was; Lucius, Remus, and the arranged Cullens. They were quick to trash the house however they made sure to hide Petunia and Dudley valuables in the attic after Harry had contacted them about the changed behavior.
"I mean you haven't told us really anything," Emmett says
Tom Riddle/?/? Yes this will be a male 3 some and it will be revealed later in the chapters I just need to know what you think of that kind of pregnancy and if you also yes I already have the person in mind so you don't have to worry about that
Books and wand holsters were next with the Boys getting one on their forearm and Hermione getting a thigh holster. After lunch Severus showed them to the apothecary and made them a personalized potions kit to his standards.
"So they can't claim anything," she whispered back "the Governors will call him up to verify the memories of detentions."
" But what about the Marauders? If you felt a friendship with Severus and Lucius then wouldn't you not lik them"
The Cullens agreed to keep their silence until the end.
"Everyone is already gone huh," she said under her breath sarcastically
Minerva Ann McGonagal
"WHAT ABOUT VASUKI? IT MEANS KING OF SERPENTS.
"Potter!" she shrieked "I dont know how you did it but i want those lies to cease this instant"
"How old are you?" Carlisle asked he was clearly putting two and two together.
"And Uncle Sev you and I need to remain in class as much as I hate to leave Harry. Hermione and Ron can help us cover for him they think covering for the both of us dating all these years."
Filius Ironclaw Flitwick
They all started talking after that. As exams ended and everyone was down in the chamber. Bella and the Cullens each shared their stories, and then Bella explained to the Cullen's how she met each of the older wizards.
"My name is Arabella Easton; High Priestess and Heir to Avalon/Ambassador to the Wizarding world/Healer and teacher of magic, Daughter of Lord Oberon and Lady Titania High King and Queen of the Faerie rulers of Avalon/Sister to Jareth the Goblin King and Puck the trickster. I have come into the mortal world many times however the reason i came this past time was because when i reached the age of 1001 years old i felt my mate being born in the world. Normally once our mate should they not be fey, reached maturity we would seek them out. However, when my mate was 17 years old i felt them dying, to the Fey mating is for life we will not find love again."
She looked at the adults and said, "Severus and Sirius i want you to keep a monitoring charm on him and let me know if something changes drastically."
"Its mine" she shreiked grasping it "An heirloom of the Selwyn family everyone knows im a part of it"
while at the same time Sirius jumped in saying, "Wait so horcruxes are fake?"
 Lestrange (D)
" Then why do you still do it " she said chuckling.
" not to"
To back up his point Ron and Hermione nodded behind him.
"they felt the need to make up for 2nd year and in reality 4th year was just a ploy to get Dumbledore off all of our backs they never really turned their back on him" draco said petting his boyfriend's hair
As they rode down to the lowest level lucius commented "I did not think anything was stored down here."
"Yes that will work. If you see any of the students let me know."
Everyone nodded and they hurried to the large building at the end of the alley.
Minister of Magic gets 2 votes
"But how is Dumbledore chief warlock let alone having any votes I dont see his name?" Harry asked
 Rowle (N)
"Hey ginny" he rep[lied softly as he tried to escape. Ron and Hermione quickly helped him since they knew what would happen if he was late. As they ran down the platform they saw Harry's uncle standing there along with molly weasley.
 Flint (N)
It would take another week before Dumbledore would bring up Harry being missing.
Each room seemed to have a different theme. One room, which was given to Rosalie and Emmett was themed after marigolds, and the interior was painted and decorated with bright gold walls, grassy green accents, and yellow furniture. The room next door was themed after magnolias, and included gentle shades of blush-pink, ivory, and hunter green with a spa-like atmosphere. This room was given to Carlisle and Esme.\
ORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL RESULTS
"one of my few regrets" she said "was that i was away on avalon and couldnt help james, lily, and sirius. I had only come out of Avalon during your second year Harry."
hey quick note i changed how bella looked because i found a model and i prefer real people to drawings. Love the pics.SO THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PICTURES AND OUTFIT CHANGES. this is for a reason and since its my work its my deal if you dont like the pics sorry not sorry.
"enough" severus and remus said before they could start an argument.
"Yes Headmaster," he sighed
“Yes,” said Bella “commissioned by myself a century or so ago. I wanted to remember my friends.”
"I don't know what safeties Dumbledore placed on this spell" she replied "if I move to quickly I could kill him."
“Yes mistress,” Tinsel nodded then she and the luggage winked back out

"It takes a very powerful magician to be able to mess  with memories in such a way you are implying madame Umbridge,"spoke Bella from the side as everyone turned to her "such things could not be done by a student and as I am one of the few who can alter memories i can assure you those are not only real but from your own head"
"No," she said " No, I'm Sorry, No."
"love?"
"That sounds good Dud I'm happy for you" Harry said
“Then you do not know your history” Lady Longbottom answered him “The high table is meant to be a tie breaker and is only held by one person. The heir to Avalon and magic herself. This is, as anyone who has had an education knows, Arabella Easton; High Priestess and Heir to Avalon/Ambassador to the Wizarding world/Healer and teacher of magic, Daughter of Lord Oberon and Lady Titania High King and Queen of the Faerie rulers of Avalon/Sister to Jareth the Goblin King and Puck the trickster.”
Ok so here's the thing I kinda suck at writing violence so any abuse harry suffers will not be described just eluded to. Also I would like to thank my wonderful friend Stephanie for her description of the manor I couldn't have done it without her.
“Tinsel,” She called.
"he likes you," she said smiling.
“what?” he asked “I don’t know what kind of creature they are but besides age I’ve never heard of someone waiting.”
The Cullens were happy with their new wardrobes as it allowed them to retouch a piece of their past.
 Burke (L)
Severus and the kids nodded and entered in their separate ways. almost immediately the great halls eyes were drawn to the group who entered specifically the fact that Harry and Draco were holding hand.
Hermione and Ron glanced at Lucius worriedly but he just shook his head signaling that Harry was fine just out of it.
As everyone made their way to their seats the doors closed.
Remus and Lucius quickly floo'd back and the Cullens looked freaked out by the fire.
“Its gorgeous love,” Edward said, “the whole place is”
YES I LIKE THAT
“Why have they waited?” Emmett asked
"That failed" chimed severus "Bella acted as a buffer for us up until the wedding and we finally pulled our heads out of  our arses"
"When we have time i will take you all shopping for what we need until then you will be hidden so it will have to do for now"
ALICE OUTFIT
"But-But-but" Umbridge stuttered fiddling with her necklace
“That’s fine with us,” Carlisle said, “We should easily be able to follow. Do you mind if one or two us sit with you just in case?”
For the rest of the Summer each of the couples spent as much time as possible together exploring the manor and the surrounding grounds. On occasion when not in the Manor, Bella would complete her duties on Avalon she was able to meet with the creature council and discuss what was happening in the wizarding world. While the Volturi were on the council they agreed that the Cullens would act as their representatives.
EMMETT
Severus and Lucius were next as they were shown a room themed after the forests. The black marble furniture was accented with green walls, couches and a golden bedspread. Draco and Harry were shown their room to represent a volcano. Like the previous it to had black marble but this room was accented by fiery reds and oranges. Alice and Jaspers room could be either water or air as the room was made in colors of silver, ivory, and blue. Finally Sirius and Remus’s room was modeled after the earth with rich brown and green tones throughout it.
Dreadful (D)
"So he just takes this and you do the ritual and he will be cured? " Edward asked in amazement
“Yes truly despicable,” Lucius replied
"Oh i didnt but more so in the way that they were children. I met the marauders the night of the almost incident with Remus and Severus. I got there just as James had saved Severus and made him stay. Then when the moon went down i reamed Sirius a good one. Of course he had not meant any harm he didn't think Severus would actually go out there"
“What are the details for Harry?”
“I promise that this will be the last time you’ll see me. I won’t come back. I won’t put you through anything like this again. You can go on with your life without any more interference from me. It will be as if I’d never existed.”
“Edward and someone else can sit with us,” Bella replied as they were handed the keys, “the cars sit five.”
He paced over to the large mirror that had been a graduation gift to him and each of the marauders
Now wands were raised
After that they met up with Ron and Hermione and went to the various shops to get everyone a new wardrobe.
"What do you mean?" sirius cried out
"HARRY'S BEEN MISSING A WEEK AND YOUR JUST NOW SAYING SOMETHING!!!!" Molly and Sirius both yelled. Sirius sounding Dangerously close to strangling the wizard in front of him. Dumbledore waved them off and asked Severus if he had heard anything.
Remus and Lucius both stood in muggle clothes and looked at the video screens trying to find the flight
Severus stepped forward as was accepted to everyones surprise not only in the prince seat but also in the Ravenclaw seat
(See the end of the chapter for
"Goblins who live in the kingdom look and act different then those who work in the wizarding world. It is because they are around children constantly."
"Thank you" he said in English, "You speak Parseltounge?"
what other couples would you like it for? not lucius/severus not that that wouldnt be great but i have another plan in mind and in that plan they are happy being grandfathers. the pairing list will follow with the next chapter so dont worry about lack of choices.
"Your right," Everyone turned to Rosalie,  "We haven't asked. Edward didn't even ask to meet your family when he came to pick you up for the baseball game. Everyone assumed since your living on your own that you had no one."
"Yes I would like a full breakfast spread for nine people and a couple pitchers of warms animal blood for seven."
"What are your other powers? " Carlisle asked
"I mean," the potions master replied a she looked at his patient, "that a combination of the blood loss from the blood quill as well as his blocked magic from Dumbledore is a lethal combination. I can't save him not on my own."
To whom it may concern,
"How long," Rosalie asked
"Why was Harry not on the list?" Edward whispered to Bella
"Severus come check" Sirius said "the potions at the final stage"
"What time do you think shall be here" Sirius asked as he looked down at his godson "the quicker the better"
"Then pack enough clothes for a month to start. We can always get more. and then find me a plane to london. The quickest flight, I dont care if it leaves in the next hour. Time is of the essence.
"so what about tomorrow at lunch?" Alice asked, "it should work from what I'm seeing"
"what was that" Alice cried
JASPER
 Greengrass (N LEANING ON D)
"Severus whats wrong," She asked anxiously, "You never use the mirror unless its an  Emergency. And what have I said about calling me your ladyship or anything of that  Manner?"
Everyone’s faces were in stunned disbelief as she climbed her way to the highest dias. Those members of the Sacred twenty-Eight who knew not only who she was but what it meant for her to be here paled.
so im going to do mpreg
"The Dark Lord hasn't been to gleeful nor has he mentioned anything so it can't be him." Severus replied, "It might be a rogue group trying to gain favor. But I'll have to bring it up to him now so it doesn't look like I'm hiding anything."
"ok children" Bella sighed, "i think we should discuss least problem to worst."
"Please come forward and state your professorship along with any titles you may possess"
"we are coming with you," edward said from behind bella
Delores Jane Umbridge
It was with a sigh of relief that the fifth years put down their quills for their final exam.  While some like Ron were relieved Draco and Hermione immediately started worrying about their scores. Harry somewhat in the middle tried to reassure them.
Suddenly he turned to harry and said, "lets go"
"Just having them as enough" said Harry.
"Why was I not informed of this?" Dumbledore asked
"Mr. Potter" they heard a high pitched voice say from upfront, "Where on earth have you been?!"
Span to each of the kids opening their OWL Letters. Attached to each of the OWL results was also a letter from the board of governors.

Bella  Snaps her fingers and immediately turned and began walking to it.
 Travers (N)
 Gaunt (D)
"Where did you get that pendant Madame Umbridge" Severus asked
"How dare you" Umbridge cried peircing everyones ears "just who do you think you are"
"1095 years old. My mate was born in 1901 and died, or so i thought, in 1918" Bella replied looking straight at Edward.
tattoos:
"it wouldn't of happened if you had listened to me in the first place" Bella turns to Jasper," Jasper I don't blame you for a second over what happened. Your a Damn empath. Of course the thirst would overtake you. of course you would struggle more than the others. You feel their thirst on top of yours every single day. Even Carlisles.... the thirst is still there whether they act on it or not. How can you seriously blame yourself for what happened?"
“To have her hear of her own volition means someone screwed up big” Lord Bulstrode said
"But continuing on, there are gifts that i have due to my heritage; i can speak with animals in fact I have my familiars which you will meet later, i can control the elements to an extent, i also have the gift of life. This means with certain conditions i can bring someone back to life also, under that. I can also make the girls pregnant if they wish."
So this starts in newmoon when edward and bella are in the forest after the party.
As she showed them a room which was themed after tulips, and was an entire bouquet of warm, happy colors.
“Lucius please,” he said “I don’t care for formality unless necessary.”
"Dray?" Harry muttered waking up, "What happened? Is it time for class?"
"That pain," she continued not letting anyone speak, "is something i will never experience again. For the death of a mate means the death of that Faerie. I had wondered why I did not die. Normally we do not last longer than a week, yet here i am 70 years later."
"To save us all time" Bella called from her seat "Why don't we make this simple. You claim you are innocent of misuse of a magical object however we have memory evidence of you using it from your own head. You claim you are innocent of child abuse however to use this quill which is only used for the creation of contracts as an implement of torture is abuse. That is what you used it as by the way, there is no other way to explain it. You TORTURED children. Finally the attempted murder charge will stand as I am the one who had to come halfway across the world to do an emergency purging and healing of Lord Potter-Peverell- Gryffindor. The evidence from this healing states he has undergone at least 12 sessions with you each lasting well into the 3 or 4 hour mark. These charges WILL stand as Lady Magic has already made the decision known."
"Its fine Harry" she said
Potions: advanced potion making
"Not to be the skeptic," Emmett said, "But where is your proof?"
Harry and Dumbledore raised their wands.
"My familiar," Bella smiled nuzzling him, "papa gave him to me."
"Confession?" Rosalie asked "What is that"
“Lord Prince-Ravenclaw please make your way to the second dias” Amelia stated after she got over her shock
"Of course my lady: he responded

Harry turned and saw a red hawk sitting out the window
When the train got to the station the group got their stuff and parted ways knowing better than to keep uncle vernon waiting. As they got off the train Ginny was suddenly in front of the golden trio.
The Wizengamot is wizarding Britain's high court of law and parliament. It predates the Ministry of Magic itself, dating back to the days of the medieval Wizards' Council. Its administrative headquarters are located in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement of the Ministry of Magic, whilst the trials take place in the dungeons of the lower levels.
 Ollivander (N)
“But wouldn’t that have come up in the trial?” Lord Shacklebolt/Kingsley asked
"If she did this every detention then there is not much i can do" Severus said as he came back over
"to true Lucius" Amelia said nodding, " I did not like the idea of installing ministry workers into Hogwarts as I believe they should remain separate. But Albus gave us no other alternatives."
Everyone then exited their rooms. The students in their school robes, and the cullens each had on a pair on nice jeans and sweaters, with the girls wearing boots. Finally Bella came out wearing a black leather jacket, pants, an emerald green shirt, and thigh high black stiletto boots. As they all begin eating Harry's new familiar picked out from under his shirt collar started hissing
HMMMMM, it thought quizzingly, IM NOT SURE
"After all" Lucius said, "this is the first time a ministry employee has been put in the position"
Quickly grabbing all of his stuff they apparated to Foxwood Manor where they were met by the others. Foxwood Manor had a certain aura about it, when its visage met the human eye. As the others quickly came to realize. It was hidden in the Fae Woods, which seemed to blur the lines between the human and Fae worlds in wide brushstrokes in acrylic greens and blues. Yet once a person found the Manor, they knew that had not mistaken it. The glorious building, painted in velvety burgundy, was breathtaking, a mixture of Victorian beauty and Tudor grace. Three stories high it stood, with small, elegant balconies along the windows of the top floor. The dark woodwork gave it an aged, contoured look, suggesting it had stood through the ages in the immortal woods.
 Selwyn (D)
"Yes" shouted sirius as he jumped up and down like a toddler
"I agree" Bella said, "have the heads of house secretly interview their students then gather the evidence. In a few days Lucius can 'suggest' that Fudge and the governors come to Hogwarts to see the progress she has made. Perhaps make sure that Amelia Bones and Rufus Scrimengor are there. We can play a little memory movie. There is no way that either of them can get out of that."
“This room is for Ron” she said next as the group explored a room that seemed to be themed after sunflowers with its brown and yellow shades.
know anything about this?” Ron asked, slightly annoyed.
“I don’t know, or, I mean... I wasn’t expecting it at all, so I was kind of shocked. But afterwards, I haven’t been able to forget that kiss, and, erm, now there’re some other feelings as well. Inside my head, I mean,” Harry said.
“Because of the content, you dimwit,” Draco said. “Will we still meet before leaving for the hols?”
“No, I haven’t seen him since then. Just came from seeing Draco.”
“As if you never did the same,” Potter grunted.
Draco was a little startled by the question. He had never really considered death that much.
“You’ve never told her you might prefer, erm, blokes?” Harry said, opening his eyes again.
Harry smiled at Ron as he noticed Ron had clearly saved at least all his favourite flavours.
“Sounds exactly like something Tonks could’ve done,” Harry said, chuckling.
“Malfoy has been disowned,” Ron said, nonplussed, still reading the article.
, Harry thought.
for you for some reason, and I’d like to be with you. If you feel the same.”
“I know,” Draco said in a low voice, sounding guilty. “I’m not planning on doing something like that again.”
heard about the electricity before. I just didn’t know how it works,” Draco grunted, looking a bit sour.
Harry thought.
Harry was feeling so much emotions at once he could barely form coherent thoughts.

reasons, but otherwise he was mostly with us, and Pansy was technically living in England too but she'd practically lived at my place. She loves me too much. I think she's codependent. The over-sentimental cow! We all are, honestly."
Harry clamped his mouth shut, because Draco just wordlessly walked past him and entered the club.

He was petrified.
Fuckkkkkkkk.
apparated him in. Obviously they knew what the aftermath of being tortured by the Cruciatus looked like so they demanded Harry tell them who’d harmed him immediately so aurors would be dispatched - he refused, said he didn't remember, no he didn't want their help remembering, no he didn't know who it was, he didn't see anything, he didn't want to press charges, no he didn't want to call anyone, no he wasn't protecting anyone and if they didn't fuck off he would discharge himself and go overdose on muggle pain-killers at home. And then he remembered that he had no home anymore. But thankfully they let it go.
-"Yes, Potter. Did you need something?"
for the rest of us.
. Dead. Dead.
-"Well, they've all read the letters and know literally everything you and I do or say because we don't have boundaries in my house. And since I like you, they want to properly meet you and threaten you."
As usual, ruminating.
And running off in the opposite direction." Theo said, laughing.
-"Why didn't you come out to see me yesterday? What was so important? I hadn't seen you for fifteen days—"
thing, assure him, that Draco would never, come hell or high water, lie to Theo, withhold the truth from him, ever-again.
He turned to Harry and shoved him away; standing up, he pointed an accusatory finger at Harry.
-"You're thinking too hard and it's getting too warm in here," Draco mumbled, voice muffled by Harry's neck.
-"Fucking hell."
Literally everyone heard him, because unlike most of them, Draco didn't whisper. But they were still grinning stupidly at him. They were insane. A bunch of fucking losers, all of them, including Harry so he really didn't see why he should take offense at Draco's frank observations.
support system and was actively avoiding things that could potentially trigger another relapse into the fog.
Draco sounded on the verge of sleep. So, Theo wandlessly accioed his wand, spelled their coats and shoes off (he'd been too preoccupied to notice) and wrapped his arms around Draco, intertwined their legs and lovingly stroked Draco's hair. Draco sighed contentedly and burrowed his face closer into Theo's warm, strong chest.
He'd known she was dying. He'd known it all along. She'd never kept it from him. She'd been honest with him, telling him that choosing to be with her was choosing impending and inevitable suffering. But Draco didn't choose to love her. He just did.
from shock, probably even panting loudly, but Malfoy was lost to this world and didn't hear him. He didn't seem like he even knew where he was anymore. Whatever was wrong with him—a dumb, blind and dead troll would know it wasn't what just happened between them—was some soul-obliterating, all-encompassing fucked up shit.
Draco winced and grabbed Harry's hand, lacing their fingers together atop the table, Harry had to stop himself from crying out in joy. This was really happening, Draco was here!
—because a variety of those answers were the only answers acceptable, Draco turned to him and frowned. Harry didn't know what his face was doing but he sure as fuck knew he was panicking. Like really, really, full-on short-breathing, heart pounding fast, sweating and considering fleeing far, just far, far, far away from the prospect of facing not only Lucius Malfoy but the entire Slytherin Gang of Evil and Condescension.
-"it was the fucking squib lawyer that did it." Draco said, smiling.
-"You're pathetic." Draco said.
-"Close your mouth, Draco, darling, it's unbecoming. Plus, It makes you look more like an albino ape than usual." Pansy drawled.
He'd never been kissed by a Dementor. But he figured this was what it must feel like. Except a thousand times worse. Draco felt like all the Dementors in the world were kissing him at once. Sucking his soul. Drenching him in freezing-cold despair. Feeding on the memory of Astoria's laughter. On Astoria's smile. On the scent of her hair. On Astoria's singing—He screamed.
-"What! No. Why?—Yes."
contrast to his old self. His depression had tamed him. Or maybe—though he was loath to admit it—Harry simply hadn't known him well before. Maybe, all along, Draco was a whiny, loving, dramatic, vulnerable, delicate, mean, crybaby, but only for his friends and family to see. Did he truly consider Harry his friend now?
A few minutes later, they stood by the door to their destination.
Theo and Greg had to eventually - physically restrain Harry from Draco.
Scorpius and Rose were playing with dolls and dozens of stuffed, glittery unicorns. Scorpius had informed Harry of his uncertainty regarding their sexuality. Harry was dumbfounded.
-"—and
Harry nodded, unable to meet Draco's eyes, gaze searing the floor.
-"I completely understand, Theo, darling."
-"They read them."
Harry saw Molly's worried expression - worried about
-"Yes."
Pansy leaned in, vibrating with excitement.
The entire thing with Nott had been nagging at Harry for ages. What the fuck was his deal?
-"Wait. You twat." Pansy called.

Seconds, minutes, or hours later, Draco couldn't tell, Théo let him, albeit reluctantly, go.
Harry's heart was beating like it wanted out of his heart, wanted to jump out and into Draco's hands.
some semblance of normalcy after everything; he'd needed Draco Malfoy to come back to Hogwarts; to sneer at Harry; to corner him with his cronies; to call Harry names; to painstakingly make hundreds of badges insulting Harry; to charm pretty paper-birds to fly after Harry, presaging his demise by a lightning-strike; to climb up trees and patiently wait to scare Harry and make a dramatic appearance; Harry'd needed Draco Malfoy, yearned for what he represented, for what Draco was reminiscent of - the past, when Sirius, Remus, Fred, Tonks, little Colin Creevey, Severus Snape were alive, when Dumbledore seemed larger than life, unassailable. When Harry hadn't

like your hair." Theo said, blushing lightly.
Blaise eventually got distracted by Theo fussing over Draco's clothes, hair, well-being, in the middle of the ministry of magic, and chose to laugh evilly at them instead. Draco was fucking embarrassed. Scorpius seemed to enjoy watching Draco suffer at the hands of Theo, because he too had suffered the same earlier in the morning, except Draco did then too.
. Everyone knew. He also knew, that the normal course of action would be to seek a mind healer's help. But Draco also knew what that help would entail. He was already taking calming draughts and sleeping potions, occasionally, because Theo wouldn't let him, since they were highly addictive.
