Dumbledore waited a moment for her words to sink into Harry's mind, then he pushed back his chair with a loud scrape and rose to his feet. "Let's get started on that potion, then, shall we?"
Harry was a little alarmed to see tears starting in Kreacher’s huge, bloodshot eyes. “Master Harry wants Kreacher to care for the last heir of the Noble and Most Ancient…”
Here's the epilogue I promised. The scene with Draco and Snape is for PetsHeart, as a thank you for your wonderful comments and to ease your worries just a bit.
“No.” Draco yawned widely and burrowed his face deeper into the curve of Harry’s neck. “Can’t talk, now… Brain gone to mush…”
“It’s not something to be afraid of,” she chided. “Nursing is a lovely experience, though it can hurt if your baby tends to bite…” Breaking off suddenly, she tilted her head up and sniffed suspiciously. “I say, is something burning?”
“Good.” She sent a plate sailing into his hand and gestured at the table. “Don’t be shy, dear. Have something to eat.”
Under normal circumstances, Ron would have gasped. Today, he simply smiled and let his hand fall straight at his side. His fingers opened, letting rat and wand drop to the grass at his feet. Before Draco had shed the momentum from his incredible stunt and swooped around in a more sedate turn to face Ron, the rat had scampered under the stands, dragging the wand in its mouth, safely hidden behind the hangings.
She shook her head lugubriously. “I’m sorry, Malfoy, but your mother’s version sounds like a fantasy. From what I’ve been able to learn, Ron’s idea of a box of Dark artifacts is probably much closer to the truth.”
“I knew it was you the instant I laid eyes on you. I should’ve said something—I wanted to—but I was afraid you’d be angry, and I didn’t want to cause a scene in a crowded club.”
“Nor is it about what my family may have done in the past. It is about Draco’s current intentions. He is the heir to an ancient and powerful Magical Inheritance, passed down through generations of pureblood witches and wizards, and he proposes simply to discard it. To cut off our Family Trees at the roots and let them wither!”
It wasn’t hard to find the story, plastered as it was across the front page under a huge headline. The article itself was short but laden with snide innuendo and as many reminders of Draco’s perfidy as could possibly be crammed into a few inches of copy. Harry skimmed over the nastiness, looking for the kernel of actual news embedded in it.
A gleam of amusement showed in Draco's eyes, signaling that he knew he'd won. "As bad as you are at Potions, it won't make a difference. You'll fail, either way. On the other hand," he murmured, his face all innocence, "if I were to help you with the essay…"
Under other circumstances, Harry would have asked him how the contraption worked, but today he had other things on his mind. As the staircase carried them down to the second floor again, he turned to the Headmaster and asked, "Where are we going?"
“I only nicked the ones of us. I didn’t want to make it too obvious that I’d been there. But if you want, I can go back and get them all.”
In deliberate provocation, Draco settled into his chair, one leather-clad leg crossed over the other, and rested a hand on Harry’s leg. Then he fixed a faintly taunting gaze on his mother and waited. He could have sworn that he caught a glimpse of Marchbanks smirking at him.
Harry’s head came up with a snap. He could feel tears gathering in his eyes again, but he ignored them. “Yes, I can. I have to, at least until he remembers…”
Harry finally looked a bit embarrassed at the deluge his emotional manipulation had unleashed, his cheeks flushing adorably. “Well, it was actually Draco who got beaten up, you know. Not me.”
“No, I don’t think I will.” He straightened up in his chair, looking mutinous. “I’m sorry, but this is my wedding, too, and I should have some say in who’s invited.”
“He’s there, Harry, I know he is! He’s waiting for me! When they’re done, he’ll take me away and I’ll belong to him forever! I’ll be his whore
Harry already stood in the water with the thick, creamy bubbles up around his ribs. He held up a hand to Draco, smiling as if he hadn’t seen the scars or Draco’s blush.
Harry’s own temper, always so ready to explode, rose to meet Draco’s, and his fingers tightened on bare, white arms. “I searched that bloody place as well as I could, with all those booby traps and wards and Dark spells all over it! I searched and searched…
The slack, empty face of the girl in front of him did not change. Gently, incredibly gently, Draco reached up to take Pansy's face between his hands. The light of the stars, which now gleamed fitfully through the weakening shroud of the Dementors' gloom, struck brilliant sparks from the facets of Draco's hand and let Harry see it clearly for the first time. The two outer fingers were gone – blown off by the force of the Unforgivable Curse that had killed his father.
Privacy was the purpose of his walk today. Hagrid had promised him tea and biscuits, and McGonagall had given her permission, so long as he stayed with Hagrid and returned to the castle by supper time. Neither McGonagall nor Hagrid would know that he had taken the longest possible route to the hut by the forest or that he had stared so long at the rooftops of Hogsmeade, thinking of how much that little village had taken from him.
“…can’t prove it was rape!” he was bellowing. A howl of mingled protest and approval met this, only growing louder as Warwick raised his voice. “So he took it up the arse a few times! He’d done it often enough before, and things happen in prison! People get up to all sorts of mischief!”
Draco had the distinct feeling that he was hallucinating, and it only got worse when first Flitwick, then Slughorn joined them, and everyone greeted him as if he had every right to be there. They patted his shoulder, expressed their delight that he wasn’t dead, congratulated him on his marriage, and generally made him feel welcome in a way he never remembered feeling before.
“I talked to Kingsley! He knows Draco isn’t a Death Eater, and he promised to help me prove it, once we find him! So how could he let them sell Draco’s home out from under him?!”
“I have to go, but you’re welcome to stay here. Have anything you want to eat. Go anywhere you like.”
With another smirk, Snape ushered him out of his office and back to the common room. Stepping through the door behind the boy, he halted just inside and glanced around. “Vaisey,” he barked. “My office.”
Draco took off after it like a shot. He chased it twice around the pitch on an erratic course and caught it just before it dived under the stands, snatching it out of the air with flashing, adamant fingers. Then he spiraled upward, his hand raised in triumph.
up.” He lifted his head, fixing his eyes on Harry. “Don’t you remember? In the Pensieve? My father said I’m not fit to carry the Malfoy name. My mother said…” He shook his head as if trying to banish the memory, then lowered it and settled it against Harry’s shoulder again. “It doesn’t matter. There are no Malfoys left, so the Ministry might as well take everything that belonged to them.”
Dumbledore’s eyes rested on Harry, quelling his outburst. “It is possible that they’re dead by now, or beyond our help. But I don’t believe Voldemort took all those hostages simply to get his hands on Mr. Malfoy. If it were one or two—Miss Granger and Mr. Weasley, for example—I would assume he needed them to lure Draco into a trap, but eleven? Pureblood and Muggle-born alike? Some of them virtual strangers to you? No.”
The toy-broom slalom race had concluded, with a firm winner and only minor injuries, freeing up Harry for a brief chat with his Significantly Better Half. He came loping across the grass and collapsed into a heap of rumpled clothes, outrageous hair and groans of feigned exhaustion.
Potter must have seen him shaking. He couldn’t see Draco’s tears or hear his silent sobs, but he knew he was crying and paused in his work to murmur, “Don’t. It’s okay. You’re going to be okay.”
"Nothing, yet, and I'd like to keep it that way." His face did not soften or his gaze waver, but the edge left his voice. "I know you only too well, Harry, so I am taking immediate steps to curb your natural tendency to run headlong into trouble. Losing one student is bad enough. I don't want to go hunting for two of you – especially not this particular two. You must believe that I will do everything in my power – everything – to find Draco, and you know that my resources are much greater than yours. Trust me in this. Help me with any information that you have. But
"Then it still comes down to Narcissa's sworn testimony against a lot of fine words from you that don't mean a thing in a court of law!"
Ron smacked his hands down on the desk and glared at Ernie. “Oi! That’s my case, you tosser, not yours, and
“I was the one who helped kidnap Malfoy from Hogwarts.” The hum rose louder, and Ron lifted his chin in defiance. “Professor Dumbledore is trying to protect me, because he knows I never would’ve done it, if I could’ve resisted the Imperius Curse. But I couldn’t, so I brought Wormtail… uh, Peter Pettigrew, onto the grounds, stole Harry’s invisibility cloak, and smuggled both Pettigrew and Malfoy back out through the wards under the cloak. I didn’t want to. Malfoy is my friend—my best friend, next to Harry—and I hate that I did that to him. I hate that I helped drag Harry into a war. But I’m not sorry that they’ve got Iff… I mean, Lily, out of it. She’s perfect. And she’s got nothing to do with You-Know-Who. She’s Harry’s daughter, and Malfoy’s, and if you take her away from them, then you’re just evil. That’s what I think, anyway.”
It was lunch time, and the Atrium was packed with hurrying figures in a veritable rainbow of Ministry robes, when a strange wizard appeared in one of the incoming floos. He was entirely unremarkable, of medium height, with medium-brown hair, medium-width shoulders, medium-sized glasses in front of medium-blue eyes. Even his robes were a medium color so uninteresting that it defied description. No one spared him a second glance, as he stepped out of the fireplace, brushed the soot from his robes, and turned to assist a second figure that spun into sight behind him.
“Stay here. Raise my children. Pamper my husband. Dress him up in leather and peel it off his body, while he squirms and begs and wets himself with need of me.”
It never occurred to him to answer any other way. Harry was a terrible liar, and he was even worse at playing politics. Everything he felt was visible in his face. Everything he thought came straight out of his mouth. This was both a curse and a blessing in a situation like this, where he could so easily lose his temper and all rein on his tongue, but where honesty was so rare a commodity. The Wizengamot had learned to trust that Harry would speak the truth as he saw it and damn the consequences. He wasn’t about to break that trust now.
Ron looked up from his letter and said, flatly, “It’s got nothing to do with You-Know-Who. It’s about Fudge. This is Dumbledore’s way of declaring peace with the Ministry and the Wizengamot. They kick Fudge out and he opens Hogwarts again. Simple as that.”
Draco stuck his wand in his pocket before turning back to face them and, in a half-ironic gesture, lifted his empty hands where they all could see them.
” Harry’s touch was gentle, his movements careful, but the pain they ignited in Draco’s body when he lifted him nearly pitched him back into unconsciousness. He grunted, his head dropping helplessly back and his eyes rolling up.
Knowing he was running out of time and control, he sent out a surge of magic to banish their clothing. Draco shivered, then rolled his hips, and suddenly their cocks were sliding together, spreading slick moisture over their skin. Harry caught Draco’s arms and stretched them up over his head, pinning them down, and began kissing his way down his throat.
He played with his eyes closed, his head tilted up, finding the notes by instinct. When he drew in a breath, it sobbed in his chest. That was when Harry realized that he had tears on his cheeks. The song soared again. That incredible voice stroked over Harry’s skin, making his guts twist, his cock stir and his heart ache with want.
Draco nodded. “That’s most commonly what an adult Veela wants. But a child like Bob, here, might want food or attention or a toy that you tried to take away. When that’s all he’s asking for, it’s not particularly dangerous. And when he’s this young, it’s not difficult to resist his Allure, as long as you’re on your guard. But with every year that goes by, his magic gets stronger, his Allure gets stronger, and his demands get more insistent, until he hits puberty and you’re properly in for it.”
Felix regarded his sleeping father for a moment, his expression thoughtful and (deceptively) angelic. Then he turned those enormous eyes on Harry again and proclaimed, “I’m tired, too.”
The door shut firmly in his face, leaving Harry alone on the stoop. He turned slowly to gaze out at the lavish grounds, green and glowing in the summer sunshine. They were achingly beautiful, but it was not their beauty that tightened his throat or brought the tears up in his eyes. It was loneliness.
Hermione broke out in the first real smile she had given him in six long years. "Good for you, Vincent."
Draco awoke with a start, bolting upright, shaking and sweating in panic. Pain spiked between his ribs, and he slumped sideways onto the mattress, biting his lip to stifle his gasps. Then he felt something move in the darkness beside him, and he instinctively rolled away from it, tumbling off the side of the bed in a tangle of bedclothes and flailing limbs.
"I told the Headmaster it was foolish to leave that hand on him. Worse than foolish. First he breaks his own bones with it, now he's very nearly killed you."
“Hmm.” Dumbledore steepled his fingers and rested them against his lips, while his eyes dwelled on Harry’s troubled face. “I can’t tell you how to defeat Voldemort. If I knew that secret, I’d have done it myself when he first returned to power. But I can offer a few pieces of advice.
“Then I stopped by the Ministry and got all the documents magically validated, witnessed and filed, so it’s official. Draco is the baby’s father and legal guardian.”
“Draco. Draco, my darling.” Harry pulled him close with one arm and cradled his head with his free hand, drawing him into a soft, loving kiss. “I promise you, it’s going to be okay.”
Slowly, stiffly, not sure if he was about to make the biggest mistake of his life by trusting this man, Draco uncurled his feet from the chair and straightened up to face him. “I’m listening.”
Casting a scathing glare over his shoulder that strangled the words in Harry’s throat, he grabbed a handful of floo powder. “Shut it, Potter, if you still want to have a tongue to flap tomorrow morning.”
Ron squared his shoulders and declared, stoutly, "I'll sit with you. Best friends, right? I've done worse in the name of friendship than lose a night's sleep!"
Harry finally gets what he wants, but not without a bit of angst. Because nothing is ever easy when Draco Malfoy is involved.
Draco slipped his arms around Harry’s neck, leaned into his body, and gazed intently into his eyes from only a few inches away. “If
As the churchyard came into view, Draco broke stride. Harry halted a pace beyond him, glancing back at his pale face, then ahead at the neat stone wall and wicket gate. There was no one waiting for them.
He resumed reading, plowing through several more pages, but it was getting increasingly difficult to keep the characters straight. And pausing to identify each speaker broke up the flow of the language, which had begun to insinuate itself into Harry’s head like subtle music, touching him in ways he had never expected. Frustrated by the interruptions, he finally stopped worrying about who was saying what and just read it straight out.
Bob set his jaw in a way that was pure Harry and countered, “It’s rude to talk secrets. What’s up the duff?”
They were getting closer - Harry could feel the pain in his chest easing and the strength coming back into his limbs - but not fast enough. Malfoy was only yards from the wards and the edge of the Hogwarts grounds. If he passed through the wards, he could apparate. And Draco would be lost.
. Setting down the cup, he rolled onto his side and pulled the blankets up around his ears. He felt immensely tired and oddly warm, as though the potion had lit a comfortably banked fire in his stomach. With a sigh, he closed his eyes.
They landed in the icy blackness of their bedroom. Draco stripped off the invisibility cloak and tossed it to the floor, while Harry lit the lamps and fire without bothering to draw his wand or look away from his husband’s face. In the sudden flare of light, Draco saw hunger, anticipation and wonder warring in his bottomless green eyes.
"I don't want to forget anything, ever again." He drew his hand from Harry's clasp and spread it flat on the other boy's bare chest once more. Gazing down at the glittering limb, with it's cruelly truncated fingers, he added, very quietly, "When I look at it, I remember what I did to my father and why. I remember that love is a weapon. It maims. It kills. It shatters even the strongest man or the most powerful magical object. I'll never forget." He closed his hand into a fist, clenching it tightly over Harry's heart. "Never."
It was a strange house. Strange and lovely. It felt old but totally unlike the other old houses he had known. Ancient wizarding families specialized in preserving the past long after it had lost its luster, and their homes were more often a monument to mouldering pride than to ancient grandeur. But this little cottage, while as old as many a Pureblood mansion, was snug and warm and welcoming in a way that Draco had never experienced before. The magic of it hummed in his bones and caressed his skin.
“You were seen with him. In a booth at the back of the club, right before he disappeared. We have it from several independent sources that you were the last person to interact with him.”
Draco did not answer him, but Harry had not expected an answer. He was banking on the fact that Draco was safely unconscious and couldn't hear a word he said.
Harry chuckled at that, thinking of Hermione’s previous knitting projects—hats to free the house-elves against their will. “Make a Slytherin pair, too.”
Somewhere in the back of his head, Draco was weeping with gratitude as he caught Potter’s hand and let him pull him to his feet. He didn’t show it in his face. He kept his eyes on the floor and his jaw set, determined to make it as far as the bathroom without breaking into a million sobbing pieces, as he staggered toward the beckoning doorway.
"Am I?" Draco set his jaw to hold in the force of his emotion. "Did you feel it, then, when the Dark Lord tried to crush my brain to bloody pulp? I felt it. Harry felt it. Did you? Did you even know what he was doing? Did you even
Harry pulled gently on his arm, and he stood up. His face wore its closed, vacant look, but he had not completely withdrawn. There was recognition in his eyes when he looked at Harry. Above them, the members of the Wizengamot were rising from their seats, milling about, muttering among themselves as they made for the upper exits, and Harry could feel their curious gazes on him, but he didn't care. He looped an arm behind Draco's shoulders and pulled the smaller boy close to his side. Then he bent his head and rested his cheek against Draco's hair for a blissful moment.
“Mr. Prewett is a trusted member of my staff who has never given me reason to question his loyalty or discretion,” Madame Pauncefoot declared icily.
Draco thought about this for all of a second, then let his brow fall into its natural position and smiled. “No, I wouldn’t. But I can’t bear being this filthy for another minute.”
In the middle of their hot, languid kiss, Draco felt Harry’s cock stir and press against his thigh. Pulling slightly away, he murmured, “Ready so soon?”
His eyes dwelled on the broken body on the grass, where the weeping Hagrid had laid it, and something inside him broke with it. His will? His spirit? Whatever it was, he felt it crack and wondered, distantly, if he should weep from the pain, but he had no tears left for himself. He had nothing.
Lifting Draco’s head and the goblet again, Narcissa tilted it to his lips, urging, “Drink the potion, please.”
Draco just blinked at this, offered her a slight smile, and sipped his tea. It was excellent. And the scones were tempting—if he could ever rid himself of the loquacious Mare long enough to eat them.
Bob threw him a burning look but knew better than to argue. Bestowing a smacking kiss on Draco’s cheek, he unwound himself from his father and crawled to the edge of the mattress. He was peering down at the floor, calculating how difficult it would be to reach it, when Harry scooped him up in his arms.
Harry backed toward the door, his wand in his hand again. “If you won’t let me help you, I’ll find someone else. Someone you’ll trust.”
“Then why does she—we have to assume it’s a ‘she’—think it is? She must have some reason to believe you could have fathered her child.”
Today was one of those rare days when he doubted his restraint. When he needed to take a step back, catch his breath, and remind himself that a fuck, no matter how mind-bending, was not worth the damage it would do. He would let Draco come all over any part of his naked body that he liked, as many times as he liked, but not ’til he’d gotten ahold of himself.
Draco's face relaxed a trifle, telling Harry that he had forgotten about the practice and was mollified by this explanation, even if he wouldn't admit it. "You're still late. I almost left."
“The parents are going to talk,” Snape pointed out. “By tomorrow morning, they’ll be beating down Fudge’s door, demanding that he rescue their children.”
A loud rap on the door saved Harry the trouble of finding a response to Snape's awkward kindness. The door swung open under its own power, and Professor Moody stumped into the room. He fixed Dumbledore with his normal eye, while the magic one swiveled madly to look in every nook and cranny at once.
“Come to my office. I have some books on ancient magical objects and a list of diagnostic spells to try. I’ve also got some living specimens you can use to test it, when you get that far.”
“I saw Kingsley Shacklebolt and Gawain Robards upstairs,” she said, as she stirred milk into her tea.
That seemed like a hefty sentence for the crime of holding a former Death Eater captive for a few hours.
“No!” Draco shouted, cutting him off. He stumbled away from the sink, away from Harry’s reaching hand, toward the door, sobbing, “You can’t be here! Get
She gave a grunt of sour laughter. "Most of the Slytherins are already packing their trunks." Her eyes narrowed as they moved to the parchment spread out in front of him. "Have you heard from Malfoy?"
“Yes, and my name was used to gain access to the Manor, as well. Obviously, someone is using my—how did you put it?—
Then Draco lifted his eyes and Harry looked straight into them for the first time. The air rushed out of his lungs. His innards clenched. He almost couldn’t summon enough oxygen to say, “You’re serious.”
Still Draco refused to lift his head. He heard the elf’s shuffling steps and the clunk of glass striking the wooden table.
How many times had he said those very words in the last twelve hours? How many things was he refusing to hear?
“I should have acted as soon as I realized that Draco was in danger. It’s my fault it went this far.”
“You did it, Harry,” Hermione said, pride and happiness thrumming in her voice. “This is wonderful. I can’t believe you
A surge of noise—hoots, catcalls, coarse laughter, embarrassed titters—met this jab, nearly drowning out Molly’s horrified, “Oh! That’s
"Yes, Headmaster," Crabbe mumbled. Then he summoned his courage to add, "I'm sorry I didn't bring it sooner. I wanted to show it to Malfoy... Draco, I mean, not the other Malfoy... because he might want Mr. Malfoy - the other one - to find... uhmmm..." Swallowing nervously, he flushed and let his confused explanation die off.
“Please,” he whispered, then regretted it when she lifted his head and ignited a flare of pain behind his eyes. Grunting and clenching his eyes shut, he obediently opened his mouth to accept the rim of the glass she offered. Cool water flowed between his cracked lips and over his parched tongue, turning his grunt of pain to a sigh of relief. He swallowed and swallowed again, then sank gratefully back into the pillow when she released him.
“Aurors?” Draco tilted his head back to get a glimpse of Harry’s taut, tormented face. “Why would Aurors come looking for us?”
“I am offering to get you the care you so obviously need,” Lucius purred, a hint of menace in his voice that Draco suspected only he could detect.
Of course he bloody well wanted to see her! What did Harry think—that he’d stopped loving her, just because she had abandoned him? Harry Potter should know better than anyone that love didn’t work that way. But love was not enough, had never been enough. He could love his mother so much that his heart cracked with it, and still she might reject him. Turn away from him. Refuse to see the man he had become. And that…
“Now, now, Draco,” his mother chided, “you are not in a position to criticize, considering your weakness for Quidditch players.”
Potter didn’t answer, and the sudden silence made Draco’s guts clench with alarm. He lifted his head and turned wary eyes on the other man. Potter was just standing there, his mouth half open and his brows up under his fringe, staring at Draco but clearly not seeing him.
And who could blame him, really? Even Oobleck, tired out from pouncing on his feet and chewing the corners of his parchment scroll to pulp, had finally surrendered to the inevitable and curled up for a nap. Surely Harry would understand that a man needed his rest, especially one who’d been up half the night with a hungry infant (never mind that Draco had slept through the baby’s thin cries until Harry got out of bed to fetch a bottle for him, and that Draco could very well have left the feeding duties to his husband), and wouldn’t give him that narrow look that said he was silently fretting over Draco’s health.
“He was dying.” Robards gave Harry a sardonic smile that invited him to join in the joke. “Apparently, Azkaban didn’t agree with his delicate pureblood sensibilities. He lasted about six months on the island before he fell ill, and by the time his wife completed her two-year sentence, the healers had declared him untreatable. The Wizengamot, in their infinite wisdom, decided that it was cheaper and easier to let his wife bury him. So they sent her into hiding on the Continent and put Lucius in her care. I think they called it House Arrest, but they didn’t bother with any restrictions on his movements. He spent the last year in bed, wasting away.”
“You damned well better push me, Potter.” Lust and laughter gleamed in his eyes. “Up against a wall… over the back of a chair… onto a table…”
Forced to serve an evil megalomaniac?! Condemned to wear his cursed Mark for the rest of my life?! Shunned by every civilized witch and wizard in our world?! Unable to find friends, a home, a decent job, all because of my
At that moment, a sleek, white form came slinking into the room, picking its way through the mess on the floor. A sharp meow brought Harry’s attention down to the cat, and he watched as Abraxas stuck his nose into the nearest box of ornaments. One sniff, and he pulled away, then sat down to lick his paw in a way that said he had nothing to do with this insanity.
Harry's eyes fixed unwaveringly on Draco, forcing him to meet his gaze. "Made love to you?" Draco nodded. "I didn't know it meant that much to you."
“Don’t feed me that shite!” Warwick growled, his temper fraying and his control slipping. “We know this one did you in the gardens at the Manor! That footman, Alistair, saw him bend you over a bench more than once!”
The desperation in his voice went through Draco like an electric shock, setting his nerves alight and bringing a pulse of wetness from his cock. He reached for his wand, lying ready beside him, and banished his own clothing in an instant. Then he bent to plant a kiss at the small of Harry’s back and raised his wand.
He couldn't take the stifling air of the kitchen any longer, but neither did he want to brave his bedroom again, where Phineas Nigellus was no doubt waiting to ambush him. He needed a quiet place to think, with no one badgering him or abusing him, where he could collect himself. Not knowing where else to go in this rotting, filthy old house, he headed for the first floor and the drawing room.
"I guess it will be, if it happens, but I'm having trouble worrying about that right now. I'm too worried about Draco."
“But…” Harry frowned in confusion, “that’s no secret. He took Malfoy because he knew I’d come after him.”
“Implicitly. He can guide you in your work on the cabinet, but he can also keep me fully informed and help me prepare a counter-attack when the time comes.”
Dumbledore nodded, let him go, and did not waste another glance on him as he hurried away. All his attention was riveted on Draco, who sat like a marble statue in the middle of the bed, his eyes wide and his face blank.
Draco grabbed his hand and headed for the door. Harry fell into step beside him and, together, they fled up the main staircase to the dim, empty, echoing hallways above. Somewhere on the third floor, beyond the Charms classroom, they found a convenient alcove with no armor or statues, and no ghosts or poltergeists floating about to kill the mood. Draco collapsed back against the stone wall, breathing hard, cheeks flushed, eyes fixed on Harry as if he were a particularly scrumptious treat waiting to be snatched.
” The blank gaze tracked back over to his face, but the other boy’s expression did not soften. “What have I done?”
His eyes flicked back to her. He must have looked thoroughly panicked because she reached over to clasp his hand.
Harry stood just outside the churchyard gate, his shoulders hunched and his collar turned up against the sullen rain. This was a Muggle village, for all the old magic hanging so palpably in the air, and he didn’t think it wise to openly cast a water-repelling charm. But, more to the point, he didn’t want to. Something about the cold drops sliding through his hair and into his collar seemed appropriate to his mood.
"I hit her with the Cruciatus Curse," Harry gasped. From this close, he could see the awareness and the agony in Narcissa's face. She looked up at him, and the silent accusation in her eyes cut viciously through him. "How do I turn it off?"
Lissy bobbed a convulsive bow, still rubbing her hands together, and whimpered, “Yes, Master Draco.”
Narcissa shook her head firmly. “She never knew why I borrowed her face or her wand. I told her I was desperate to see Draco again and afraid to go back to England wearing my own face. She would never have agreed to the switch, if she’d known what I planned.”
The guard checked his stride when he realized who had committed this breach of protocol. He stopped, gulped, and met Harry’s level stare.
“No,” Harry protested in a hushed, pained voice. Felix twitched again, and he cast a quick Muting spell so they wouldn’t wake him. Then he scooted still closer to Draco and slid his fingers into his hair to clasp his head. “You did your best, Draco.”
“While this all sounds a bit fanciful, there’s no arguing with the fact that we have a living child on our hands, who looks exactly like Malfoy and is only hours old. It had to come from somewhere, but we’re not yet ready to accept Narcissa’s explanation wholesale.”
“I didn’t.” He stroked his hands down Draco’s back, pausing to fit them around the perfect curve of his arse, and felt the reckless heat flare in him again. “And I’ll definitely take you up on it. Just not here.”
“That!” Draco scoffed, cutting off her solemn pronouncement. “That was for Voldemort’s benefit. To prevent him from stripping the family vaults of money and magical artifacts.”
"What happened?" Harry finally murmured, very softly, as though afraid that a loud noise might startle Draco.
Harry crossed the room and dropped to a crouch in front of him. Draco could not see him, he knew, but he could not help himself. "Look at you. You're freezing," he murmured.
“Potter.” Draco spoke without taking his eyes from the creature in his hand. “What in the name of Merlin’s blessed balls have you done?”
, he'd give up on scar-face Potter and go back to the dungeon where he belonged! If he had the sense of a Hufflepuff. But clearly, he didn't, because the very last thing in his mind was the possibility of returning to the Slytherin dungeon, where Potter couldn't find him.
"You don't look the least little bit like Harry Potter," Adelaide said. "I've seen zillions of pictures of him, and he's got black hair and…"
Everyone watched, faces alight with laughter, as Felix threw himself into what was clearly a favorite game with his parents. Gaze fixed raptly to Harry’s face, he watched his mouth move—just as he had Draco’s a moment before—and tried to mimic it.
"I will take the child," he called, in his strangely high voice. "The boy is not to die, yet. One of you must heal him as I cut. Bellatrix…”
"I see your problem. Azkaban is the logical place, if we could find a way to keep them inside." He paused, thinking, then broke out in his rather feral grin. "We need something meaner than a Dementor. How about dragons?"
It was beautiful. Thanks to the magic in the house—and maybe to sour, old Kreacher—the instrument was perfectly in tune. The clear, lovely notes brought tears to Draco’s eyes, so he shut them.
“It’s okay. You can heal it later.” He stooped to catch Harry’s finger in his mouth and sucked his own blood from it. It tasted like salt, metal and magic. “Or Granger can, if you can stand the embarrassment.”
The owl uttered an imperious hoot and launched herself from the window ledge. Her great wings—half again as long as those of the contemptible lesser creatures in the owlery—spread and lifted her effortlessly into the crystalline sky. Draco watched her, his face settling unconsciously into lines of sadness. When he could no longer see her dark silhouette against the pristine blue, he turned to find Ron standing quietly behind him.
“Felix, the eggs belong in your mouth, not in your hair,” Harry said mildly, breaking Draco out of his brooding trance and bringing his eyes to Harry’s face.
“Well, I do. I know Harry better than anyone, and I know exactly what he would have done, if he’d been given the chance.”
They crouched there, panting and sweating, hearts pounding in unison, for a handful of minutes, unwilling to move or draw apart. It was Harry who finally stirred, but all he managed was to turn his head a little and press a kiss to Draco’s throat. Draco gave a rumbling purr in response that dragged a groan from Harry.
"He will be, if Narcissa babbles to Fudge," Moody growled. "Then we'll be right back where we were this morning, with Potter in the dock, and no excuses this time. Potter was very much in his right mind when he used threw a Cruciatus Curse at her."
"I'm very glad you're awake, Harry," Dumbledore said. He was crouching on the floor, one hand resting on Draco Malfoy's head while the other reached across the boy's still body to clasp his left wrist. The Headmaster's face looked strangely worn and old in the orange light.
This one was a witch, fine-boned, slight of build (if a bit taller than one might expect), hugely pregnant, and carrying several paper bags with golden Ms blazoned across them. Her coloring was a shade lighter than her companion’s, her lines and curves a touch softer, but otherwise, she seemed to possess the same aggressive blandness (except for that prodigious belly and the enticing odor of fried food that clung to her) that characterized him.
“All right, here’s the truth as simply as I can put it.” He lifted a hand to brush Draco’s cheek, then cradled it in his open palm. “I have the most wonderful family, the most wonderful children on this earth. I would gladly have a dozen more, if it would make you happy, but I don’t need more. I don’t need anything but you and our beautiful sons. So this is all about what you want.”
“You felt this,” Draco murmured, trying to envision his father standing in the shower, caressing his own hair and hardening at the feel of water on his skin. He couldn’t. His brain wouldn’t go there. But clearly, Lucius had lived through this
Then his eyes moved to the desk, and he saw two magazines, neatly rolled and tied with string, sitting on it. Harry’s magazines.
The door swung open, and Mad-Eye Moody clumped through it. He held a scroll in one hand and kept both eyes—normal and magical—glued to the Headmaster.
Lucius lashed out, striking Draco in the cheek with the back of his hand. There was an explosion of green sparks and a hiss of burning flesh. Draco uttered a tearing scream, his hands flying up to ward off the blow a fraction of a second too late. Lucius leaned forward, one knee on the bench, pushing the glowing gem against Draco's face and holding it there, in spite of the boy's struggles to escape him.
He obediently let his legs collapse and dropped into a chair. His bleared, red-rimmed eyes fastened on the blanket covered with ducklings, and he visibly struggled to make sense of what he saw.
"We can only hope." Turning to one of the portraits on the wall behind him, Dumbledore called, "Phineas!"
Dumbledore sighed. “There’s a grain of truth in what you say. I do want Harry to fight, when the time comes. We all do. But he will fight Voldemort because he knows he must, not because I hold you hostage to force his hand. I also want you here for Harry. But only because I care for him very much, and I want to see him happy. He can’t be happy without you close to him. That’s a simple fact that has nothing to do with war and strategy and manipulation. It is only about love—the kind of love most people never experience, the kind of love only a fool would try to resist.”
A thick silence met his words, only broken when Teddy cut right to the heart of the matter and demanded, “You have
Potter had kept on his pants and t-shirt again, sparing Draco the caress of his bare skin, and he was grateful for it. He was completely at Potter’s mercy and too tired even to care very much. So he rested his forehead on his bent knees, closed his eyes, and let Potter wash his back, while ignoring the way his cock filled between his thighs at the other man’s closeness. He didn’t even have the energy to be ashamed of his desire.
Once upon a time, he had been pleased to think that his constellation was watching over his children as they slept. Now he felt, vaguely and inexplicably, that it was somehow the fault of those stars that the bed beneath them was empty and his children scattering to the four winds. If he, Draco, and the stars that bore his name had guarded them more closely, loved them more perfectly, they would never have chosen to leave him.
He took the winding stairs two at a time, climbing ever higher in the grim fortress, ignoring the burn in his muscles and the shortness of his breath, intent only on reaching his goal. He’d long since left Ron and the reluctant, heel-dragging Rufford behind. They would catch him up eventually, and he had no intention of slowing for them. He tried to count the levels he passed but lost track somewhere around thirty. Then he started firing bursts of light at the archways that led off of each landing, reading the numbers carved in the lintels.
“How in Merlin’s name did you do that?” “This changes nothing, Draco!” “No, Teddy, don’t come in here!” “I know you can’t apparate in your condition, and the floo is locked…”
Draco looked at him for a long moment, face soft and unguarded, eyes blurred with exhaustion, pupils dilated. Then he murmured, “This is real?”
“Harry Potter! As I live and breathe! I can’t remember the last time you set foot in my shop!” Her eyes shifted to Draco and crinkled warmly at the corners. “And Draco.” There was no mistaking the welcome in her voice. “I’m so glad to see you, my dear.”
"I hope you freeze something important off, you git," he said, sleepily, as he pulled the cloak up over his head.
Kissing Draco's forehead one last time, Harry straightened up and moved over to the door. As he sidled past the nurse, he wiped his sleeve across his eyes in a belated attempt to hide his tears. Madam Pomfrey kindly pretended not to notice, as did the others waiting just outside the door. Harry did not acknowledge them, but hurried past with his face averted. He didn't have the strength to control himself any longer, and the thought of facing Dumbledore's piercing gaze, Snape's derision or Mrs. Weasley's motherly concern frankly horrified him.
“That’s what I thought when I saw it in the shop,” Draco said before he could stop his unruly tongue.
With that, he swept his family out the door and down the stairs. Bob still clung to him like a limpet. Draco stayed in the circle of his arm, happy to trip over his robes with every other step if it meant staying in close contact with his body and confident that Harry would catch him if he lost his footing. They reached the drawing room. Harry set Bob down on the sofa before crossing to the hearth.
She checked for a fraction of a second, the sandwich halfway to her mouth, then took a determined bite. “Delicious.”
With a gasp, she whirled to face the door, her lamp clutched to her chest in shaking hands. There was no one there, but the chill intensified, running like icy sweat over her skin. She set the lamp on a handy crate and tightened her grip on her wand. Then she crept to the open door. As she stuck her head into the passage, she felt the cold flow over her again, more thickly still. There was something horribly familiar about it, but she couldn't place it.
Ridiculous, really, a whore who wouldn’t fuck in a bed. But the old horror lingered, like the smell of come on his skin. So he smiled and flirted and dragged them all down on those tufted velvet cushions, where he could fuck without wanting to vomit.
Draco made no attempt to pull away, refusing, for once in his life, to avert his eyes from the truth. "No. I think you did it so I wouldn't remember a betrayal that has already happened. So you could have the Draco Malfoy you love back again."
Draco walked quietly down the corridor, his footsteps echoing slightly as he went. He was alone. The rest of the students were safely in their common rooms, enjoying a few hours of relaxation before going to bed. Only Draco still haunted the castle hallways – Draco and his memories.
“If you mean that I have a new client, yes.” He shot Harry a chagrined look and added, “There’s no payment involved.”
Molly twitched, her whole body fighting the rein she’d placed on her tongue, then she nodded toward another meandering hallway and the sound of laughter flowing out of it. “Everyone’s enjoying the fire in the living room. Go on in and get yourselves something to drink.”
Harry abruptly pushed himself to his feet and stepped over the bench. “I’m headed up to the tower. I’ll see you later.”
His in-laws were positioned in front of the fire—Lucius standing, Narcissa arrayed regally in an armchair—holding snifters of brandy. They glanced up at his entrance, and Harry thought that they both looked rather haggard in the firelight. Not at all like their usual sleek, superior selves.
Draco pried one hand loose from its clutch on his ribcage and reached for the glass. His fingers slipped on the slick surface, fumbled for it, then dropped to knot themselves in the blanket, as a wave of shuddering agony took him.
Harry and Ron sat on opposite sides of the desk in their minuscule office, a pathetically small stack of parchment between them. Harry was kicked back in his chair with his ankles crossed and his eyes on the ceiling—his thinking slouch, he called it—while Ron had his elbows propped on the desk and was chewing on the feathered end of a quill. He looked annoyed, but Ron always looked annoyed at this stage in a case, when all they had was preliminary reports and no real progress made.
. He could face tea with Harry’s adoptive mum. After all, Harry had survived tea with Narcissa Malfoy, and that was a much more daunting prospect … wasn’t it?
Ron stared at him in blank disbelief. “Malfoy’s baby?” He swallowed, his throat working, as realization and rage blossomed together in him. “
The uncharacteristic stupidity of that question pushed Harry over the edge into howling rage. “I don’t fucking
Draco knew he’d made a mistake the instant he appeared on the sitting room rug. He felt that twist in his guts, that surge of
Harry lifted his eyes from the letter, feeling as though someone had just hit him in the chest with a killing curse, and looked for Dumbledore. The Headmaster was fending off a pair of screeching witches whose hats had been snatched off their heads by grabbing claws, waving a couple of owls away from his own head, and reading a letter at the same time. As Harry's eyes touched him, he glanced up and met his gaze.
Draco’s voice, rested and lubricated by coffee, was smoothing out again, so he no longer sounded like he was coughing up gravel when he said, “I wouldn’t have made a scene, but I wouldn’t have taken your money, either.”
Harry waited for nearly an hour before Kingsley showed up. By the time to door opened to admit the Minister, he had worked himself into a state, convinced that the delay meant they were going to acquit Warwick. Then he saw the satisfied glint in Kingsley’s eye and felt his heart skip a beat.
of his friends, not just the sinister Draco Malfoy—and wouldn’t smile on an interruption by them. Then they reached the post office.
Before Dawlish could open his mouth, Madam Marchbanks rose to her feet. “Please take your seat, Mr. Potter.”
Harry shrugged. “Draco will take care of it.” He slid a cup of tea over to her. “This is Felix we’re talking about. How bad can it be?”
Harry had fallen in love when he was fifteen and, being Harry Potter, had never looked back. It didn’t matter what outrageous, idiotic, self-destructive or flat-out dangerous things his lover did. Harry would forgive it all because he had chosen Draco and would never let him go. And Draco…
He shuddered and turned to meet Dumbledore’s thoughtful gaze, unconsciously knotting his hand into a fist and pushing it hard against his thigh. “What kind of spell is it?”
Firmly banishing Phineas Boggs to the pile of things to be dealt with later, Harry spent the rest of the day at Draco’s side. They teased each other, laughed together, read some Shakespeare, drank copious amounts of tea, and pretended that all the shite outside the walls of their snug cottage did not exist. By the time they retired to the sitting room after dinner, Draco had lost his brittle edge and hunted look, and Harry was congratulating himself on a job well done.
“She’s due for a feeding,” Pomfrey said, as she held the bundle out to Dumbledore. “A few more minutes, and she’ll be screaming the roof down.”
“This wasn’t his first trip down Knockturn Alley, and you’re not the first bloke he’s paid for sex. In fact, until I saw you here, I just assumed that he wasn’t really missing, that he’d found himself a nice piece of arse and was off having some fun, and that we were all going to look like pillocks when he turned up in the morning looking like he’d won the Quidditch Cup. But you are here, and that means trouble.”
"Nothing." Harry handed him the comb and came around the bed to reclaim his spot on the mattress. He shot the other boy a sideways glance and smiled to himself, ducking his head to hide it from Draco. Definitely an archangel. All he needed was a pair of wings and a really big sword. A few ethics wouldn't hurt, either, but you couldn't have everything.
hair! Honestly, I’m not going to list all the people who love you because it will only puff you up and make you more insufferable than ever!”
He stroked the white-blond strands back from Draco’s forehead, studied his pale, shadowed face and heavy eyes.
"Is Harry ill?" Molly asked, as she sidestepped Minvera and rushed into the room. "Is he hurt? Where is he?" Her eyes swept the ward, then halted as they fell on the section of transparent wall and the small room beyond it. Her entire body stiffened, and her hand flew to her mouth.
Ron chuckled, as if the joke were obvious, and chided, “Come on, Andie, you know us better than that.”
A spasm of pain contorted Draco’s features, and something like fury blazed up in his eyes. He squelched it almost instantly, but not before Harry saw it and grasped that Draco’s obedience, his passivity, was just a veneer—a very thin veneer that could crack at any moment. He took another step closer to the other man, hands spread open to show his empty palms, and this time, Draco could not edge away. He could not let go of the bedpost.
“I’m afraid I have to break up this party. You need potions and lunch, then a good rest.” Her eyes narrowed as they shifted to Bob. “And no squirming boys on your bed. Come along, Master Felix, down you get.”
“None. Goyle is flying without a broomstick. Three Knuts shy of a Sickle. Trust me, Harry, you have to stop listening to that clot.”
“Forget it. Hey!” Harry paused in the doorway, glancing back. “How long are you figuring to be gone?”
They stayed for another hour, talking about anything and everything, until Flitwick pointed out that the Hogwarts professors were due back up in the Great Hall for supper. That signaled the end of the party. Everyone downed the last of their drinks and got up to leave.
“Listen very carefully, Mr. Malfoy. We have explained your isolation—both from the school at large and from Lord Voldemort’s spell—as necessary for your recovery. As far as your parents know, you’re under a stasis charm to keep you from doing permanent damage to your brain. This means that you can’t speak or move.”
"I don't mean as a weapon against Voldemort or as a symbol of something for people to fight for. I mean as a person. As me. Draco needs
“No.” Kingsley shifted uncomfortably in his chair—something Harry never remembered seeing before—and cleared his throat. “I need Draco to heal because I need him to testify against Warwick and MacMillan.”
Ron loped down the hallway with Neville at his side, casting a reflexive glance through the observation window in each door they passed. His eyes strayed toward the interrogation rooms out of habit, but his mind was on Harry—on his best mate’s thoughtless, reckless behavior and the furor it was causing—not on the poor plonkers who’d been dragged in by the Aurors for questioning. They were just collateral damage. The only person to blame for this mess was Harry himself. His Auror colleagues wouldn’t believe that, of course, but his Auror colleagues didn’t know Harry the way Ron did. They didn’t know what kind of shite their golden hero got up to on the quiet.
The door now stood open, revealing what had once been Snape's dark, dank, oppressive office. All the furniture had been pushed aside and a cheerful fire lit on the hearth. Candles were dotted about to light the room, and in their yellow glow, the jars and bottles that lined Snape's shelves did not look quite as gruesome as usual. The office looked almost inviting, until Harry glanced down and saw two pallets laid out on the floor, with a collection of needles, tubes and bladder-like bags on a table between them.
The fierce, brilliant, blue eyes met his through the wall of the cage, full of understanding and sadness. He made no move to lift his wand. “It’s up to you, Harry.”
“Where have you been? Is he all right? Why is he crying?” He made a move to take Bob, demanding, “Give him to me! Bloody hell, Potter, what took you so long?!”
“Just stun him,” Macnair grumbled, as he stepped over Draco and took up his post at the boy's shoulder. “He can’t do magic if he’s unconscious.”
He cracked open his eyes and turned to look at her from beneath his lashes. “Always the tone of surprise.”
She tossed the powder into the fire, turning the flames green. Harry immediately dropped Draco’s feet to the floor and stepped into the fireplace, holding the unconscious man against his chest as if they were dancing. As Harry stepped past her, Molly tugged the cloak off of them, bundling it up in her hands.
She nodded. “Lissy brought them. The owl flew round and round the Manor, trying to get in to Master Draco, then perched above the door and would not allow the Master to come near. Lissy had to catch it. The Master was angry, but he allowed Lissy to bring your mail.”
He heard voices from the parlor, as he approached. His father was standing just outside the room, clearly waiting for him and looking none too happy. The grey eyes—so much like his own, yet so alien to him—swept over him from the crown of his silver-gilt head to the fine leather of his shoes, and he grunted. The lift of his father’s lip told him that the older man was firmly restraining himself from making some snide remark, though what, in all honesty, he could find to object to in his appearance, his son could not fathom.
“For what? Joining the lynch mob?” She flinched, and he instantly felt guilty. “Sorry, I… sorry,” he muttered.
Draco freed one hand to press his fingertips to his eyelids, trying to hold back frustration, tears and a pounding headache. He took one deep breath, then another, then muttered behind the screen of his lifted hand, “It’s not right.”
Draco cried out again, more loudly, as Potter bit and sucked. He rocked his hips, desperate for friction, unable to stop himself, and his head fell back in helpless surrender. Potter laughed again, bit still harder, then pulled off his nipple with a lascivious slurp.
“Trust me.” Harry shuffled into position between his legs, one hand caressing the upturned curve of his arse. “You’ll feel better soon.”
The words were simple, the tone startlingly soft, the hand combing Harry’s hair gentle, but they went through Harry like an Unforgivable Curse. He gasped and fastened his arms around Draco’s thighs—the highest point he could reach in this position. Tears started in his eyes. He buried his face in the other boy’s stomach, letting his tears wet his skin, and uttered a moan of pure ecstasy.
Nero snarled a curse and lunged for Draco. Harry crossed the distance between him and his lover in an instant, moving so fast that he might have apparated without realizing it. Draco almost fetched up against Harry’s chest, only just stopping before they collided, and stood there breathing hard, eyes lifted to meet Harry’s intent gaze. Harry kept his hands clenched at his sides to control the urge to touch Draco, while their eyes locked and the very air seemed to smolder between them.
“Now, let’s see how to open this window. Ah, good, it’s just a normal latch. Last time, they sealed the windows and made them unbreakable.” He pried open the latch and pushed hard against the tall, arched window. It swung reluctantly open, letting in a gush of frigid air.
“Let’s get him down to the kitchen and feed him,” Harry suggested softly, “then you can tell me about this inheritance that’s got you in such a twist.”
Then he pulled Draco into his arms, enveloping him in a hug, and said in a voice roughened by emotion, “I missed you, you bleeding rodent.”
Draco blew into the parlor of Malfoy Manor in a swirl of fury and face paint. He had not stopped to wipe the butterfly from his cheek, tidy his hair, or change out of his Muggle clothing, so it was no surprise that his parents met his arrival with blank, disapproving stares. Narcissa was serving tea. Lucius had a delicate sandwich halfway to his mouth. Both froze as their son stormed into the room.
"She would if I let her see them," Ron said, grinning back at Harry. "Well." His smile faded, and his shoulders hunched visibly as he drew in on himself again. "See you later then."
“After St. Mungo’s, I’ll stop by the Ministry and make sure his paperwork is in order. We don’t want any confusion about who he is or where he belongs, in case your parents decide to make trouble.” When Draco continued to scowl, Harry asked, anxiously, “Have you changed your mind? Do you want them to have him?”
Harry felt the blood drain from his face, but he kept his voice level when he said, "Draco's emotions are hurting him."
He struck again with each word, pounding them into Draco’s face, catching him on the cheekbone, the jaw, the mouth. Draco gasped in spite of himself and closed his eyes against fresh tears.
“I didn’t want to invite you here. I only did it to keep the peace. And I expected our little tea party to be a disaster.”
“Neither will the rest of me.” He cradled Draco’s head gently and turned to press a kiss to it. “I promise you. I’ll find a way out of this for you, and when I’m done,” he swallowed and his voice roughened, “I’ll kill your fucking father.”
A knot eased in Draco’s stomach—whether of anticipation or terror, he couldn’t say—and he let himself draw in an even breath. “What time?”
Something about the blank stupidity in Harry’s tone brought anger up like molten lead in Draco’s throat. “Of course the Manor, you fucking imbecile! Where else could I possibly go?!”
“McGonagall’s not going to keep us here, either,” Ron assured Hermione. “She knows we can take care of ourselves. And they’ve got security wizards patrolling the streets of the village, just in case,” he added, tapping the parchment. “I haven’t had a butterbeer in ages! And I haven’t even seen Fred and George’s new shop! Mum said they were taking over Zonko’s. Wow… A Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes right on our doorstep…”
Another long pause that stretched Harry's nerves on a rack, then he spoke again in a whisper, "Where's the charm?"
Draco stirred slightly, one eye cracking open to gaze up at Dumbledore. "What choice?" he rasped out.
Harry did not give him the satisfaction of flinching under the lash of word and tone. Instead, he retorted, sounding oddly confident in his own ears, "No, I'm not. I know he won't forget me."
“Nothing.” Harry sniffed and pulled slightly away. Glowing green eyes turned up to meet Draco’s concerned grey ones. “I’m just so happy it hurts.” Draco smiled and another shaft of pain went through Harry’s body. “Can I give you your present, now?”
Harry exerted all his self control to keep his face neutral under all those hostile glares. "Not yet, Draco." He tried to smile for the other boy's benefit and moved toward the door, motioning for Draco to follow him. "Come on. We'll go someplace quiet to wait."
“Oh, I did it myself, but he taught me the spells to counter the wards without triggering an alarm.” A grin split his face, baring his teeth. “He was only too happy to help, when I told him what it was for. You see, he wants to bring Malfoy to justice as much as I do.”
Harry gave another weary sigh and sank his fingers into Draco’s hair, as if to anchor himself. “After the war—after you disappeared—I didn’t know what to do with myself. I was isolated and lonely, but I couldn’t muster any interest in other blokes. Ron and Hermione kept trying to fix me up or get me drunk enough to fall into bed with someone, but it never worked. I couldn’t even get as far as a snog in the corner. So then I tried with Ginny, just to see if girls were what I really wanted. She was willing, and Merlin knows she’s beautiful enough! But that went all kinds of wrong. It would have been the single most humiliating moment of my life, if Ginny weren’t the classy lady that she is and one of my oldest friends.”
“I used to think it would be thrilling to watch Aurors take apart a witness. I never dreamed that I would be the witness, or that an interrogation would be so uncomfortable.”
Lucius paused, thinking, then answered cautiously, “At first I didn’t understand the urge and didn’t try to control it. When I took a woman, I imprinted myself on her without considering her feelings. After your mother, well, I learned restraint. Now I use that power very sparingly.”
He had to tell Harry. He had to find him, drag him home, and tell him what he’d seen in that interrogation room. Then, maybe, the jangling tension would ease. His thoughts would stop tumbling. His hands would stop trembling. He could breathe without wanting to scream.
He turned his head to free his lips and murmured, teasingly, “You do realize that Bob has probably been banishing your spells without us knowing for months.”
Ron stepped into the common room, still without looking to either side. The voice told him that he was to climb the stairs to his dormitory and retrieve the necessary item immediately. He obeyed without hesitation.
Gone were the rank hospital pajamas. Gone was the bleared, fuddled, rumpled look of a man who spent more time asleep than awake. He was dressed in a pair of leggings—most likely Ginny’s, since they were covered with multi-colored flowers—one of Ron’s old maroon jumpers with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, and a pair of orange Chudley Cannons socks. His hair was clean and loose, falling down his back in a spectacular platinum curtain. His eyes were alert, if a bit hollow, and his cheeks tinged with color.
Harry did not answer. He was craning his neck around to watch the door. Two minutes later, the guard returned with Draco Malfoy beside him.
The furor rose again, but Madam Bones halted it before it could get out of control. “Malfoy’s child?”
“What’s the matter, Weasley? Afraid I’ll impregnate all the high-ranking officials at the Ministry in some convoluted plot to undermine the government? If you’re so concerned with the
“My colleague did warn me that removing the constraints on the baby’s sex may remove other constraints as well.”
“Huh?” Harry ran caressing hands down Draco’s arms, stroking the soap bubbles over them. “Say what?”
Harry picked up his pace until he was running down the long, echoing hallway, his feet sliding on marble when he turned a corner. He met up with Dennis Creevey on the stairs. Dennis grabbed his arm and shrieked, in his penetrating voice, "What is it, Harry? What's wrong? Why are they sending us all to our common rooms?"
Harry cocked an eyebrow at him and smiled with some of his usual warmth. “Working on a novel in your spare time?”
“I know you’re scared of something,” Harry went on softly. “I’ve watched you since we got home. You’ve been frantic. Never holding still for more than two seconds, like whatever it is will catch you if you do. But when you were with me in the tea shop, you were better. You were calm and happy—you were
“You didn’t think that maybe I’d be as worried about him as you are? That maybe I’d want to see him? Say hello? Welcome him back from the
child!" With these words, Voldemort moved as if to offer Draco a glimpse of the baby, but instead raised his wand to point at the boy's twisted, agonized face. Cold, white lips spat a curse. Red light shot from the tip of Voldemort's wand. Draco's head jerked backward, striking the table with brutal force, as blood spurted grotesquely from his eyes and poured down his face. Draco's cry of pain ripped the air, dragging a sob from Ron and causing his mother to flinch.
"Draco's feelings for you are very tightly woven into his memories of his father and the Giants' Dance, so tightly that it was you he reached for in his moment of greatest danger." Dumbledore's voice dropped to a gentle murmur. "Think of the Patronus, Harry."
The cloth disappeared as Potter worked more soap into it, then it skated over his ribs and down to his hip.
“No.” Another burst of magic banished Draco’s clothing in a blink. “I’m going to throw you up against that wall and fuck you to tears.”
The kitten, still dangling from Draco’s fingers like a particularly rank nappy, squirmed and cried again, pushing poor Felix beyond his endurance.
“They will if you and I tell them the truth. Once they do, I want you to make a public statement. I want it plastered all over the front page of the
When he was gone, Potter banished the dish covers with a wave of his hand, then summoned a bowl, all without shifting his comfortable place against the raised end of the bath. Draco watched the bowl sail into Potter’s outstretched fingers, his brows raised.
“It’s not always easy, I grant you,” she conceded, eyes warm and sparkling with an emotion Draco knew was not aimed at him, “but for all his lack of social graces, my dear husband is nobody’s fool. According to Ron, it doesn’t make sense to delay confirming the baby’s sex,” she paused, then added, pointedly, “unless you’re afraid.”
“Urchin,” he said, a wealth of love and pride in that single word. Then his gaze shifted to his parents and abruptly cooled. “Mother. Father. Are you enjoying yourselves?”
“Which is true enough, now that I think about it,” Harry said. “You remember what this house was like when Sirius lived in it? And after he died, when it was just Kreacher? We weren’t safe walking into half the rooms, and it was more than our lives were worth to open a cabinet! But now that Draco lives here, the magical objects are mostly quiet and the house is positively cheerful. He’s the one who finally got Walburga’s portrait off the wall.”
Harry chuckled and heaved himself to his feet. Holding out a hand to Draco, he said, “Come on. I’ll carry you.”
The lift came to a halt and the doors opened. Ron ushered the boys out, steering them past the open doorway of the main Spell Damage ward and down a quiet corridor that ran alongside it.
“Kidnapping, grievous bodily and magical harm, child endangerment. Guilty on all counts. It would have gone a lot worse for him if you or Tio had died, but even a happy ending couldn’t save him, once Bulstrode got up to testify.” Harry grinned with undisguised relish. “For once, that way he has of making a simple ‘hello’ sound like a catastrophe of epic proportions worked in our favor. I swear he never said a word that wasn’t simple medical fact, but he had half the Wizengamot in tears by the time he was done. It was fucking brilliant.”
“That occurred to me, but he wasn’t looking at me—not like he knew who I was, anyway. To him, I was just a bloke who had his hands all over you, and that’s what he cared about.”
Harry waited for a moment, studying him with eyes so warm that Draco could feel their touch on his skin. Then he said, gently, “It’s okay if you want to sleep in here.”
The other man took a drag on his cigarette—to steady his nerves and his hand, Ron guessed—then asked, “How do you suppose I can help?”
He guided her to the front of the chair, then looped an arm round her shoulders and pulled her against him. She leaned into his chest, half-sitting on the edge of the chair, and tucked an arm comfortably about his waist. For a moment, neither of them spoke, while Bess rocked the chair gently with one toe against the rug.
“What… why do you even want to… to study… Fuck.” He ordered himself sternly to concentrate and demanded, “What did you put in my potion?”
"Look, I brought you some stuff." Crabbe held out his hand, and Harry saw that he carried a small leather case - like a shaving kit. It was made of fine-grained black leather and had a large M stamped in silver on one corner. Like everything Malfoy owned, it looked outrageously expensive.
“Come on then,” George said, catching Ron’s arm and pulling him away from the building toward the near shore of the island.
Kingsley when he promised to clean up the Ministry, end corruption and bigotry, treat all Magical creatures as equals…”
Granger burst into the room a moment later, eyes bright and face aglow. Her smile could have lit the catacombs beneath Gringotts. She swept them all with a triumphant gaze and held up a book approximately the size and weight of a tombstone.
“Absolutely.” He angled his head to tease Draco’s lips, while his hands slid around to clasp his bum. Between them, their two cocks pressed into the swell of Draco’s abdomen, sending a fresh ripple of delicious pleasure through him.
Harry flinched and muttered, “It doesn’t matter, now. He’s dead and good riddance.” He stared down at his hands for a long moment, then asked, “Where is he being buried, if not at Azkaban?”
“Your family isn’t gone. Not all of it, anyway. Your mother is free, living in Southern France. And she… she knows you’re alive.”
"Harry! Oh, Harry, my dear!" Mrs. Weasley surged toward him with both hands outstretched to catch his and tears in her eyes. "Thank goodness you're all right!"
“I saw a picture of one somewhere—I don’t remember where—and pestered my mother until she bought me a book on rare non-Magical animals so I could learn about them. Father never quite forgave her for that.”
"Thank you." Dumbledore gazed at him for a moment, the sharpness fading from his eyes, then asked softly, "How is Harry?"
“Is there a reason why you chose to take direct action against your son-in-law so quickly? Did you hear from the DMLE?”
“It does, indeed. And it will likely inspire MacMillan to change his plea, which means I can spare you another trial.”
Dumbledore smiled at him, eyes twinkling. "I'm very glad to see you awake and feeling more yourself, Mr. Malfoy."
“Is your headache better?” Draco nodded slightly. “Excellent. I can fetch you a pain potion, if you feel you need one.”
Granger nodded. “It can, but only if there are no male heirs in the direct line, and then only to a male descendant. And it means that the Black family legacy now, to all intents and purposes, belongs to the Malfoys.”
She shrugged, letting the taunt roll harmlessly off her shoulders. “Ever since I told you that wizard pregnancies always produce boys, you’ve flatly refused to discuss the baby’s sex or consider performing the charm that could confirm it—as if refusing to find out will actually change anything! And you’ve got Harry just as worked up about it as you are.”
Harry was no longer listening. His eyes had wandered back to the dance floor, and he was once more lost in contemplation of his husband—his gorgeous,
“It’s not just any baby,” Harry countered, looking at them both in surprise. Didn’t they get it? Couldn’t they
With that, she turned and wafted from the room. Draco watched her go with his mouth hanging open in surprise. When the door clicked shut behind her, he turned on his father and demanded, “Has everyone in this family gone insane?”
“You need Snape?” The suspicion and distaste twisting her face would have made him laugh under other circumstances.
Her manner turning brisk again in an instant, she leveled her wand to point at Draco's nose and said, "Now close your mouth and let me get on with my work, young man."
Harry laughed. "Give her the manuscript, Hermione. I'll owl Draco, and he'll send Dobby for it if she forgets."
When Harry had last seen his husband, he was stark naked and thoroughly wrecked. He had tumbled into sleep without bothering to clean himself up or comb his hair, too sated and exhausted to care about hygiene. So the last thing he expected was to find Draco bathed and combed and dressed in a sky-blue nightshirt that fell to the middle of his thighs. It’s little cap sleeves, scoop neckline and thin fabric were entirely unsuited to the cold weather, so he’d cast a formidable Warming spell on the room that practically made the air glow with its power.
What was it with these pureblood ponces that made them so unbearable? Malfoy. Prewett. There was nothing to choose between them. Though, if he were being fair, he’d have to admit that Malfoy wore his toffy-nosed entitlement with a decided air, while Prewett was just an insufferable tit.
The cold, black eyes narrowed even more. “Do as you’re told. Or shall I start your day off by taking points from Gryffindor for your insolence?”
"I think there is little doubt that you and Draco would form a very powerful link indeed," Dumbledore said gently. "Or that you would need it to accomplish what you must."
“You won’t get the chance,” MacMillan assured him, brandishing the scroll with his damning words filling it. “After this, you won’t ever
He hunched a shoulder defensively then, in a desperate move, lifted the cigarette to his lips and drew deeply on it, telling himself that he could feel the comforting burn of smoke in his mouth and lungs. “Thanks for the reminder, Potter,” he rasped out.
Croaker opened his mouth, paused, shut it again, and nodded. “That should be easy, considering how much I’ve already forgotten about him.” After another long moment, he said, “I understood that they’d made an arrest in the Memory Thief case.”
"I missed you so much, I swear I thought I was dying. My insides hurt all the time, and I couldn't eat or sleep. I didn't know where you were or even if you were still alive, but all I could think about was how cold you must be without me there. I thought of you sleeping alone, shivering, then waking up and looking for me…" He slid his hands up to clasp Draco's head, cradling his face between his palms, and buried his fingers in tangled silver-gilt hair. "I know you looked for me, Draco. I know you missed me, even if you can't say it. Just like I know you love me."
Harry, bless him, stayed at his side and didn’t ask for explanations, didn’t even ask him to open his eyes. He just sat and held Draco’s hand, and when Draco
“Merlin’s Bloody Balls!” he gasped, as days of crippling grief suddenly burned away in a flash of inspiration.
“Ah. Yes.” He flushed slightly in pleased embarrassment. “Harry will be sending you an invitation, I’m sure. You and Teddy. I know he wants you there.”
They were photographs of Potter and Draco at the club, all taken from some distance away but from a variety of angles that left little to the imagination. They had captured Draco’s bright head bobbing as he sucked Potter off and his scantily-clad figure writhing on Potter’s lap. The most numerous and revealing were of Draco bent over the edge of the table, while Potter reamed his arse with obvious enthusiasm. These were taken from the front, showing Draco’s face as he rode his punter’s cock, and there was no hiding the ecstasy that he felt or the moment when he came.
Draco squeezed Harry’s hand and started toward the sound of Lily’s burbling, but Harry halted him. “Sit down. I’ll get her.”
“And probably gotten us expelled, but I don’t care! I would’ve done it anyway! Bloody hell, Draco, just thinking about what we could’ve gotten up to makes me so… so…”
He Vanished the water from the tub and used a Drought charm to dry them both a bit. Then he wrapped Draco in the soft towels he’d laid ready and carried him into the bedroom. Draco stirred when Harry lifted him, mumbling something into his neck, but Harry soothed him with a soft word and he drifted off again.
Harry followed Dumbledore's lead and sank to his knees on Draco's other side. "What about Pansy?" he asked, roughly. "Do you think he… hurt her?"
Hermione did not answer him, but dug her elbow into Ron's ribs and hissed at him, "I don't believe it. Look who just walked in."
“In the dream, maybe, but now? When you’re awake?” He gazed solemnly at Harry, his eyes seeming to grow impossibly bigger, ’til they swallowed the wandlight that filled the room.
Wasn’t he a Muggle and far beneath the notice of pureblood wizards? And of all the plays to choose, why the one about doomed lovers dying by their own hand? That seemed entirely too romantic a notion for a Malfoy, yet obviously it had meant enough to Draco that he’d carried it all the way from Malfoy Manor to the
Reluctantly, Harry extended his hand and took the bag from Dumbledore. The charm felt just as heavy now as it had when Draco wore it, and Harry had to clutch it tightly to keep from dropping it. The velvet felt oddly warm against his skin but not uncomfortably so, and he could not feel any outward pull from the charm. It still called to Malfoy, as Harry could sense through the link, but the call was muted and the physical torment it had caused was fading into the more normal pain of burns and exhaustion. Even the Dark spells woven into it were weaker now, as though the charm's separation from its host had stretched them to the breaking point.
Throwing Harry a fierce glare, he flung out a hand toward the mirror in a dramatic gesture that would have made his father proud. "Like a starveling ghost!"
cared about him were waiting for him to come home. But Draco could not feel or hear him, and the only person in his dark, little world at this moment was Lucius. Dumbledore's hand gripped Harry's shoulder, steadying him, and he sucked in a deep breath to still the boiling frustration in him.
Hermione abruptly pushed away her plate and got to her feet. “Come on, Ron, let’s get started on our Charms homework.”
Draco watched her knock on the door, watched it swing open under Dumbledore's hand and then close again, leaving them alone in the room. Then he flopped back against the pillow and sighed.
The sandwiches were pâté, his favorite, and he set to with a will. He was working his way through the neat pile, barely tasting them he ate so fast, when he heard a tapping at the window. He turned to see a large, brown owl perched on the wide sill. It caught his eye and rapped its beak smartly against the glass again.
“No and no. The students are all at dinner, so we can choose any spot we like. And I thought you wanted to fuck me up against every wall in the castle?”
"Come on," he said, dully, as he once more drew out of Harry's embrace. "If we're going to do Dumbledore's royal bidding, we may as well get on with it."
“I doubt that, considering that they lionize you for your Quidditch skills, whereas I’m the town prostitute.”
“Find Arthur Weasley. Say, ‘Draco isn’t feeling well, so I’m taking him home. Thank you for your hospitality and Happy Christmas’.”
Well, his father had told him that he needed to learn control, and this was the perfect opportunity to practice it. Control. Restraint. Denial of the heat simmering in his loins and sparking under his skin.
“My Uncle Dolph?” For the first time, Draco betrayed surprise. “No, not him, though his brother Rabastan was a regular. He had something on my father, so he didn’t have to barter for me. He just used me when he liked.”
“Nonsense. Why would you stay shut up in this room on Christmas Eve?” Her gaze cut over to Draco, who stood with his back turned, and a shade of worry darkened it. “At least have a drink and listen to some music.”
Voldemort threw back his hairless head and uttered another peal of laughter. “How predictable you are, Dumbledore! Always the hero! Always the fool!”
Warm, wet lips slid down his neck, sending a shiver over his skin and dragging a grunt of mingled approval and disgust from him.
Draco gave her a level stare. “I don’t want or need your forgiveness. I don’t care what you think of me. And I’m no longer a Malfoy.”
“She’s safe with me. Trust me.” Her hand rested on his hair for another moment, then her lips brushed his forehead again. “I’m begging you to trust me. And be strong. I may not see you again, but I need you to know that I have your daughter safe and that I love you, Draco. I do. With all my heart.”
Lucius thinned his lips in disapproval and cut Draco a look from the corners of his eyes. “Your father’s sense of humor leaves much to be desired.”
Harry watched in rapt delight as he flicked off the tap, tossed his head to throw back his silvery curtain of hair, and turned to place the full kettle on the hob. At the same time, he burst out singing, “
“So he sneers and abuses me and insults my husband, and I’m supposed to understand that he does this out of love?”
Whew! This one was a beast to write, but going back over your lovely comments helped break the logjam in my head and get it moving again. I have to commit myself and publish it, before I decide to go back and rewrite the whole bloody thing again, so I may have some errors or typos in there that I would normally catch. I apologize in advance if it's rough in places, and I promise to clean it up when I can stand to read it again.
"So, if I decided that we shouldn't sully our virtue until we're legally adults, you'd be okay with that?"
Potter guided him across the room, taking most of his weight on his arm, but tactfully kept his magic and his opinions in check. Draco was halfway to his goal when a fresh bout of nausea took him. He lurched to a stop, clutching at Potter’s arm, and doubled over in pain. A strangled cry rose in his throat, followed by a gush of acid-laced water. It spurted from between his clenched teeth to soak his hair and shirt, splatter Potter’s jeans, and pool on the floor.
Draco loosened his legs from around Harry’s hips and let his feet fall to the floor, giving a small whimper of disappointment as this drew Harry’s softening cock out of his arse. Leaning into his lover’s taller body, he wrapped both arms around his waist. Then he kissed Harry’s throat, just below his jaw.
"What about Draco?" Harry was disgusted to hear his voice shaking, but he couldn't control it. "What will happen to him? Will they take him to Azkaban?"
In the far corner, Luna was saying to Draco in her dreamiest voice, “I wear an amulet made of Crumple-Horn ivory to ward off malignant charms.”
Without stopping to consider what he was doing, Harry gripped his wand tightly and turned on the spot, disapparating with a
Robards deserved it, no question. The Minister had to know what he was capable of, even if it went no further than this office. But what if Kingsley chose loyalty to an old colleague, stability within the department, over justice? Could Harry really give up his job? A job he truly loved? Could he live happily without it, as he’d claimed just a moment before?
Before Harry could act on this reckless impulse, Snape whirled on Ernie, teeth bared in a feral snarl, and growled, "Get us out of here!"
Ron stared at them, a frown gathering on his brow, then abruptly pointed his wand at the ceiling and muttered, “
“I’ve missed you.” One hand skimmed down Harry’s side, then moved between them to cup his crotch. “Missed having you inside me.”
Tears instantly flooded her eyes and began to pour down her cheeks. “Lissy is not knowing this! Mistress is not saying! How is Lissy knowing that wizards is being so wrong and so stupid and so
“How about you make yourself beautiful for your meeting, while I start breakfast? I need to feed that fabulous, pregnant body of yours before it wastes away to nothing.” He gave Draco a squeeze and a kiss on the temple. “Yeah?”
scar garner for him? Not fame, certainly. Or adoration, or envy, or approval. No, this was a mark of shame, like the brands burned into the faces of thieves and beggars after they had sat the night in the stocks.
“So do we, Minister!” MacMillan blared, pushing past his superior with blithe disregard for Robards’ warning scowl. “We’ve got Malfoy’s confession!”
But Draco was beyond reason or caution. He was in an instinctive place of rage and terror, driven there by the man’s first words, intent only on reaching Bob at any cost. He was up like a shot, flinging himself at Harry and the baby in his arms. He only distantly heard the man’s shouted warning, or Harry’s challenge, or the other attacker’s curses.
Both men fell silent. It wasn’t until Kreacher had set down his burden and bowed himself out of the room again, until Harry had poured the tea and handed Draco a cup, that they spoke again. Draco took a sip of the fragrant brew, then spoke to the cup in his hands.
“Harry, no.” His hand closed on Harry’s wrist, as the helpless panic rose in his throat to choke him again. “Don’t,” he rasped out, “don’t bother with them! Just let it go!”
They ate lunch at the Shakespeare’s Head pub and Harry loved that almost as much as the jeans. He found a copy of
"Honestly," Harry said with a sigh, turning from the stove to face his squabbling children. "There's quite enough jam for both of you."
Harry paused to consider, then admitted, “If he had proper authorization for the arrest, then no, that wasn’t criminal.”
“I can do that.” He shoved his arms into the sleeves of the shirt, remarking sourly, but with no real bite to his voice, “Though why you’re putting me to bed when it’s not even dinner time, I don’t know.”
“Yeah.” Harry shut the door and slumped into the empty chair across the desk from him. “Sorry it took so long, but you have no idea what it’s like trying to get a dead body through Customs. Fuck, I’m tired.”
An hour later, still wondering what the hell he was doing, he stepped off the Charing Cross Road and into the Leaky Cauldron. The taproom was packed when he pushed open the door. He slipped inside, shut the door, and turned to scan the room, part of him perversely hoping that he was too late. He wasn’t.
“There was no point in trying to save it.” He felt barely a twinge as he said it and was quietly proud of himself. “And no way to get rid of the Dark magic without taking it apart.”
Narcissa seemed to feel that the conversation was straying onto dangerous ground and turned her attention to Bob again. “Are all of these young people friends of yours?” she asked.
“You utter, fucking wanker. This interrogation is officially over.” Shooting a frowning glance at Malfoy, he called, “Let’s go, mate!”
“That’s okay, too. Whatever you need. But don’t try to forget, love, because that only makes it worse. Trust me, I know. It’s better to look at it now than to bury it ’til it rots, like a body under the floorboards.”
“Draco. Hermione,” Harry said, his voice carrying easily in the unnatural silence. “You’re just in time.”
"You'll learn to use your power to sense contact with the surface of the hand. But that's very subtle magic, a matter of fine-tuning your awareness after you've fully assimilated the hand, and it won't come easily. In the meantime, watch what you're doing or you'll break a lot of quills. And maybe a few other things."
“Enough with the ‘most noble spouse’ rubbish. You only say it to annoy Harry, and he isn’t here, so spare me.”
It was always so hard to express himself well, especially with Draco, who could rattle him so easily and turn him into a gibbering mess.
“Will I, though?” Harry quirked another of those beautiful, winsome smiles at him and mused, “I admit, when I first brought you and Tio home from hospital, I thought I’d get fed up with being a nursemaid, but I didn’t. Just like I didn’t get fed up with bottles and nappies and midnight feedings and watching Felix paint the cat with marmalade. I love every minute of it. And the longer I do it, the more I hate the idea of doing anything else.”
felt about him up until a few months ago, and how he's treated me all these years. I don't have your… your connection to him, so it's not so easy for me to just erase all that."
Shifting his hold on the baby, he freed a hand to unbutton his shirt. Then he tucked the baby inside the shirt and maneuvered her into position. Her mouth fastened on one nipple and sucked hard. Pain and pleasure shot through him. Uttering a nearly orgiastic groan of relief, he let his head drop back onto the pillow and his eyes fall closed.
Harry chuckled. Draco didn’t quite go that far, but he was smiling as he slumped back into the sofa cushions and shoved his loose hair back from his face. Harry watched, eyes veiled behind his lashes to mask their hunger, following the hand as it moved, dwelling on the fingers as they sank into gleaming strands. Long, white fingers. Bare of ornament.
Harry jerked back as if he’d been hit with a Stinging hex, an exclamation on his lips, then gave a gulping sob as he felt Draco’s hand move in his.
The words struck Harry in the chest like a Killing Curse. They ripped open his flesh. Smashed his ribs. Wrapped around his heart in a cold fist and squeezed… squeezed…
piece that doesn’t quite fit. A man doesn’t just wake up one morning to find his brain melted with no warning at all!”
Jumping to his feet, he caught Draco’s hand and dragged him toward the door. Draco hung back, trying to slow his headlong charge, but Harry’s superior weight won the day. They were halfway down the stairs before Draco caught his breath enough to launch a new argument.
“Okay, if I tell you what I know, you have to keep it to yourselves.” They both nodded solemnly. “Voldemort is using Draco to get to Dumbledore. He’s torturing him, threatening his family, forcing him to… well, I don’t know exactly what, because Draco and Dumbledore won’t tell me.”
“I always have room for Mare’s scones. And you still haven’t tasted them.” When Draco just stared at the sign swinging above the inn door, saying nothing, Harry urged, “I promise I won’t let her bite you.”
Hagrid stepped back to allow Snape and Harry to enter, his eyes dwelling curiously on the inert bundle of pale hair and black fabric in Snape's arms. Then he climbed the steps behind them and crowded into the interior of the bus.
They would roast him alive over a bonfire, eviscerate him, and dance naked round the Whomping Willow, draping his guts like garland on its branches.
She broke off, smiling to herself, then mused, “Darling Will is fey. A free spirit. A complete mystery to everyone, but most especially to Lucius. That glorious head of hair alone is enough to take him aback.”
Will gave Draco a doubtful look that made him chuckle and tuck the boy more closely into his side. “You see, your brothers were all named by Daddy, and Daddy is pants at picking names, so we had to come up with lots of other things to call them. But
“I just want to know what magical name Dad has picked out,” Bob said with studied innocence. “You know he’s got one.”
"Then you might as well not talk to me at all!" Harry retorted, feeling his face heat. He dropped his gaze to the table top and glared furiously at his clenched fists, afraid to risk another look at Mrs. Weasley's expression and not at all sure that he could master his own.
Harry looked at him curiously. He had never pegged Crabbe as one to rebel against his parents or friends, but maybe he had misjudged the oafish boy.
She bustled them back to a table right in front of the massive hearth of Cotswold stone, talking all the way. Then she stood back, smiling in satisfaction, as they peeled off their many layers and sat down. Harry took the chair to Draco’s left, with his back to the blaze, and very pointedly clasped his hand.
Kreacher bowed. “It is Master Draco’s house. He may do as he pleases. But Kreacher would be honored to show him the house of his former mistress.”
His dreams still lingered behind his eyelids, vivid and agonizing. Visions of Draco as Harry had seen him countless times in this very room… Curled into the corner of the settee, feet tucked under him, wrapped in cashmere and leggings and Molly Weasley’s knitted afghan, sipping tea from a china cup… Lying with his head in Harry’s lap and Abraxas against his ribs, softened by sleep, smiling as Harry stroked his silver-gilt hair… Kneeling naked on the settee, hands clutching its carved back, straining to hold Harry’s cock and gasping as he emptied himself on the cushions…
Draco started moving again, pushing himself stiffly to his feet, his abused body protesting all the way and Wart echoing its distress with his plaintive noises. And still the racket from the other room continued.
Scrunching down still farther on the old settee, he turned his eyes on the tree. Some of the magical ornaments woke and began to move for him. The constellations in their glass balls twinkled merrily. A spangled broomstick trailing a green and silver ribbon zoomed happily around one branch. A delicate structure of golden wires and glittering mist hovered just above another branch and spun fascinatingly, like a kind of festive time-turner. It was all lovely. Mesmerizing. And it helped ease the panic fluttering in Draco’s chest.
“It’s all I can do,” Draco said quietly. “I can’t fuck after… what happened, so it’s the only way I can please you.”
“Very well. But it’s rude to use another wizard’s wand, especially when it might affect the wand’s allegiance, so I rarely even touch it. I wouldn’t want it to stop recognizing its true owner.”
Light flared from behind the shoulder of the castle. It was bright, beautiful and deadly. The power of a hundred wands, all blazing at once. Watching it, Draco felt his throat close up tight with tears.
"Just a little," he mumbled, blushing at the memory of lying face down on a mattress while Madam Pomfrey pulled slivers of glass out of his backside.
Then Harry broke the kiss and asked, "You about ready to go inside?" Draco shook his head. "There are places in that pile where we can be by ourselves, you know, and I'd really like to have you to myself. For the whole night, if we can manage it.”
Even in his drugged state, Draco could feel the unfamiliar (and entirely unwelcome) magic crawling over him. It felt like a stranger’s hands on his skin, and it made him recoil in disgust. Even the baby reacted, shying away from it and twitching in distress.
"I thought the whole purpose of opening the school to students and their families for the summer was to keep Wizarding Britain's most valuable assets
This wasn’t a problem for him in practical terms. He spent almost no time in the Slytherin dungeon, choosing to study in the library or the broom closet and to sleep in the big bed he shared with Harry, even when the Gryffindor couldn’t join him there. It was no great hardship to step around a group of First Years playing Exploding Snap on the floor or to walk the castle corridors without a hulking, great pair of goons beside him. He couldn’t really even object when he caught a faint sneer thrown in his direction, given what he knew about himself and his family.
“Fuck that!” he blurted out. Then, seeing the reproachful look on her face, he ordered himself to calm down and tried again. “Sorry. Just tell me what they think I really want.”
“It’ll cook out some of your aches and pains, bring your temperature down, and clean you up properly. Spells just aren’t the same, are they?”
Weasley, who was not even remotely susceptible to Potter’s charm—earnest or otherwise—retorted, “That’s not an answer. If you expect me to back you up with Robards and try to save your fucking job, you’ll tell me what you were doing all night!”
The taste, the smell, the noises Harry made were intoxicating. Like a hit of opium to his system, lifting him out of himself. He growled softly, worked his tongue in deeper, intent only on hearing that sob again. That high, hungry whine. That pleading for more and more and more.
Of course, Draco chose that moment to come sailing into the room, resplendent in drainpipe trousers, Mod boots, and tailored midnight blue robes that were perfectly pleated to hang over his enormous tummy. He looked simultaneously slender and huge (his back, shoulders and hips were still elegantly trim, while his stomach was roughly the size of a haystack), gorgeous and grumpy. His glossy purple lips were pulled down in a scowl. His eyes flashed from beneath blackened lashes and kohl-lined lids.
“That’s what I’m trying to do! He needs proper care, a safe environment, potions to control the symptoms…”
Mrs. Weasley looked up from a countertop groaning under the weight of enough food for a small army, her eyes brightening in welcome.
Draco knew this room well. He had spent many happy hours here as a child, trailing along behind his father, gazing in wonder at the vast cabinets, shelves, tables and boxes full of magical artifacts and family heirlooms. This was Lucius’ private vault where he kept the Dark secrets of generations of Malfoys. Never in his life had Draco known his father to let anyone enter this room other than a full-blood Malfoy—in other words, no one but Draco and himself—until tonight.
Something in his manner seemed to defuse Draco’s anger. He sat very still, gazing intently at the Potions Master, apparently weighing his words. Then he asked bluntly, “Can you stop my father from selling me?”
“Why not? I handed you my credit card so you could buy clothes, and that’s much more dangerous than a pile of pound notes.”
Potter whistled softly. He caught the perfect circle between his thumb and forefinger, hesitated, and glanced up at Draco with a hint of pleading in his eyes. “May I?”
He pushed back his plate, his appetite abruptly gone, and said, “I don’t need to practice feeding my fingers to some carnivorous plant.”
Diggory nodded in satisfaction and stepped back. Dumbledore gestured for Harry to follow and started for the telephone box at the far end of the room.
The Gryffindor nibbled along his jaw to his ear, fingers tracing lines of heat down his bare back, and murmured, “Let me show you how much I want you.”
Draco ignored the veritable wall of sound that crashed down around his ears. He swept up to Harry, took his outstretched hand, and leaned in to plant a purple kiss on his cheek. Hermione said something that was lost in the din, then accepted Harry’s one-armed hug (he wouldn’t let go of Draco’s hand to do it properly) and wiped the traces of lipstick from his face. And still the cacophony went on.
“And I’m the Auror who saved his life,” Harry returned, his voice silky with malice, “which makes me the lead investigator on the case and responsible for his safety. Save your breath, Narcissa. You won’t win a verbal duel with me, or any sort of duel, as I think you know. You must have learned that, if nothing else, from tonight’s disaster.”
A soft sound from behind him jerked Draco out of his black study and around to see the very last thing he had expected. It was a cat, long and lean and sinuous, its white fur marked with pale ghostly-grey stripes, its tail weaving as it oozed across the room toward him. Draco watched it approach, his jaw hanging ludicrously open, until it stopped just in front of his toes and fixed him with very familiar eyes. It meowed once, imperiously, then sat back on its haunches.
They were halfway up to the top level and Kingsley’s office, when Harry suddenly remembered the two loyal friends waiting so anxiously for word from him. Drawing his wand without disturbing Draco’s hold on him, he cast a Patronus with ridiculous ease. He was so full of triumphant happiness that it was more of a strain to contain it than to give vent to it.
“This is different. You can’t come to the meeting, but you can escort me to the door. Then you and Bob can go visit George.”
Narcissa gave him a disdainful look. “That won’t be necessary. Entirely aside from the fact that you would almost certainly fail in the attempt to remove Harry Potter against his will, I have no objection to speaking with him. You may go, Auror Purefoy. Unless, of course, the Ministry has further need of me?”
“You think I’d do any better?” Draco asked, with a slight, wistful smile tilting his bloodless lips. “I’d give her to the house-elves to raise. Just like my poor toad.”
At the sound of Dumbledore's voice, Draco tried to pull free of Harry's arms, but the other boy did not let him go this time. After only a brief struggle, Draco subsided, leaning heavily against Harry and still holding him tightly.
"Memories in the Pensieve are single mental threads, coherent in themselves but not the entire past experience. Emotions remain, bits and pieces not part of the central thread, other memories from the same moment not captured with the first. Any given memory is a very complex web of perceptions and responses. If you ask the right question…"
“It won’t be like the last time,” Harry assured him. “We know what to look out for, and the charm will lead us straight to Draco.”
Harry visibly pushed down his instinctive ‘fight’ reflex—for Harry, there was no ‘flight’ option available—to think about that. Finally, he shook his head. “I haven’t seen anything.”
He felt Draco’s cheek move as he smiled. Then the body in his arms turned, and the bright blond head came up to fix him with laughing grey eyes. “I’m a Malfoy, Harry. We know how to manipulate a situation to our advantage. But I’m also a Potter, and that means I do it with style.”
Somehow, I always end up putting a trial scene in every fic I write, even the funny ones. I keep telling myself that I won’t, that I don’t like writing them and am rarely satisfied with the result, but they always seem to be necessary. So I could say that this is the last trial scene I’m ever going to write, but I’d probably be lying.
His cock stirred. He lowered his hands to his lap to hide it, still clasping the brandy snifter. He cut a glance up at his husband from beneath his lashes and saw those fabulous green eyes fixed on him. They glowed with that special light he saved just for Draco.
Harry lifted his head to find Draco’s mouth with his. They kissed long and sweetly, letting just a taste of their ever-simmering passion leak into the embrace. Just enough to soften and heat their lips, quicken their pulses, catch at their breath. When Harry felt his cock stir and begin to push against Draco’s hip, he pulled gently away.
Harry took Dumbledore's advice and changed his shirt. He also allowed Madam Pomfrey to clean him up, fuss over him a bit with potions and treats, and settle him in his bed on a mountain of pillows. Her mothering mood of the early morning had not passed, and with no one left in the hospital wing to coddle except Draco - who was dead to the world - and Harry, Harry got all of her attention. But the minute she pulled the privacy screens into place and left him alone, he abandoned the lavish comforts of his own bed and crawled into Draco's instead.
My deepest, most sincere thanks to everyone who commented on the last chapter. I've been immersed in the snark and drama of Harry's trial and haven't had the mental wherewithal to reply, but I will soon. I promise. I love you all, and I couldn't write this story without you!
He paced toward the clearing, his bare feet crunching on the dead grass and his long robe hissing along behind him. He smiled, his lipless, snake-like face stretching grotesquely, and his red eyes shone with triumph. Harry felt the pain in his scar prickle, trying to force its way into his immediate consciousness, but he ignored it.
“He’s removed from her influence until her magic dissipates, then he attests in front of witnesses that he wants to marry her and gives his consent for any conjugal activities that may occur in perpetuity. That’s signed, witnessed, sealed with magic and kept on file with the Ministry.”
“You know why I can’t.” Draco lifted his right hand and massaged it with his left, watching Snape scowl in understanding. “The task is mine, given to me by our master, and my life depends on how well I perform it.”
“Well then, my boy, it’s time go get what you want.” He clapped Harry on the shoulder and turned, briskly, for the door, motioning for everyone to follow him.
Finally it was clear that Draco had sunk back into a deep sleep, out of reach of his dreams. Harry gave his hair a last stroke and rested his forehead against the other man’s for a long moment. Closing his eyes, he breathed a silent sigh of relief.
“See that you retrieve all copies,” Kingsley said, as he pulled a fresh sheet of parchment toward him and picked up a quill. “We can’t afford another leak of damaging secrets to the Press, especially ones that are so patently untrue.” The dark eyes found Robards and held him, petrified, for a moment. “As anyone with a grain of sense can see that they are.”
Bob reluctantly loosened his hold on Draco, only to fasten himself to Harry instead. Harry tucked him neatly into the crook of his arm and settled onto the bench that ran down one side of the long, roughhewn table. After a moment’s hesitation, Draco sat down beside them and put a hand on Bob’s back. The little boy rested his head on Harry’s shoulder but kept his eyes fixed unwaveringly on Draco.
“I believe you, but I think that both you and Harry will be better off once it’s cut. It will remove temptation.”
“Only, think about the pattern. The attacks are ugly. Brutal. But most of the men didn’t suffer permanent injury—if you don’t count the lost memories. Now, who has been seriously hurt? Boggs? Aysgarth? Nero? What’s so special about them? What sets them apart from Nott or Croaker?
“I do. That’s the other thing I came here to say.” He gave her a level look with a measure of pity in it, but no relenting. “You’re no longer welcome in our home. Don’t try to contact us. Don’t floo-call or send owls—we won’t accept them—and don’t try to get through the wards.”
“Git.” He leaned in to press a lingering kiss to Harry’s mouth. Then he murmured, “The point is that you don’t have to do any particular job to please me. But you don’t have to give one up to please me, either.”
Footsteps clattered on the stairs—more than one set, warning him that Hermione was not alone—and his two best mates rushed into the kitchen. Hermione clutched a newspaper in her hands. Ron held Rose. Both looked as if they’d just rolled out of bed and forgotten to fasten half their buttons. Rose was dead asleep.
Hermione shook her head glumly. "They've all been as close as oysters. Flitwick got over-excited and said something about bringing in Ministry wizards to strengthen the wards, but I don't see how that can happen with Fudge in charge. And I... I did hear Dumbledore tell the Slytherins that they could send owls to their parents. He says he'll let any student go who wants to and whose parents give them permission."
“I had a sniff round his flat, after he’d gone to sleep, and found a whole darkroom full of this stuff.”
Draco listened to Harry’s footsteps swishing in the grass, heading toward the house. He waited until he heard the back door close, then he shivered slightly and turned away—away from the warmth he had no part of, the house full of voices and laughter and family squabbles, the boy who wanted so desperately to make him a part of that warmth because he could not bear to choose between his adopted family and his lover.
Crabbe obediently edged into the stairwell and flattened himself against one curved wall to make room for Hermione. His face, white with fear of the Dementors and Moody combined, still managed to look awestruck at the sight of the long, cylindrical tower sliding past them, as the stairway carried them smoothly upward. At the top, they halted before a heavy oak door. Hermione knocked politely.
Draco, done with arguing, pushed into his hand and groaned his encouragement. “Stupid sodding Gryffindor,” he panted, “if you don’t hurry up, I’m going to come on your fingers.”
“It can’t be true, Arthur!” Mrs. Weasley hissed, her voice easily carrying down the hallway to their retreating backs. “It simply can’t!”
” he cried out again, as Harry eased down his pants and stroked him still more intimately with his tongue.
Harry gave a breathless laugh, even as he cast a spell that filled his hand with lube. Pausing for a moment, fist closed, to let it warm a bit, he caught Draco around the waist with his free arm and pulled him roughly forward. Draco came to him eagerly, lifting his legs and falling back on his elbows, then gasping as slick fingers worked into him.
To prove his words, he promptly grabbed Draco’s head in both hands and planted a kiss full on his lips.
“She was trying to help,” Harry retorted, giving him a wounded look. “She knew we were wrong about the Memory Thief using Legilimency, and she didn’t want us wasting our time chasing false leads. That’s all there was to it.”
Draco pondered this for a moment. He could think of a whole list of things he’d like to have, starting with a sharp blow to the head to knock him unconscious for the duration of this nightmare, but he didn’t dare ask for any of them. Potter was being suspiciously helpful—calm, gentle, undemanding, completely unlike himself—and Draco was afraid that a rash word on his part would trigger another bout of overbearing possessiveness. But there was one thing he needed urgently, if he wasn’t going to totally humiliate himself.
“About what happened? I know some of it. You’ll tell me the rest when you’re ready.” He cocked his head, his incredibly tired eyes filling with uncomplicated affection. “I just want you to get better.”
Silence reigned for another few minutes, until the door abruptly swung open and Vincent Crabbe stumped into the room. He looked positively cheerful, his usually dull eyes alight and a grin on his face. Everyone looked around at his entrance. He brandished a sheet of parchment at them.
"Maybe you're right about Dumbledore, but you forget that I can't leave the castle, with or without Harry." He smiled crookedly, his bitterness leaking through the elegant mask he always wore. "I'm a dangerous criminal, remember? A homicidal lunatic who can't be trusted in civilized society."
to produce—but you didn’t oblige them, and when Harry and I had Felix cut out of the Black-Malfoy inheritance, they lost all interest in us. We did not hear a peep out of them, until they learned that I was pregnant. Then, out of the blue, after three years of blessed peace, I once more became the object of their obsession. Or should I say… their
“If you want to help me, Mother, let me go!” His eyes locked with hers, his face set with pain and a deep, festering sorrow that made Ron’s chest ache to see it. “Let all of us go. Stop this, before it’s too late.”
“And lost him again.” His eyes fluttered open to find Hermione gazing at him with so much love and sorrow in her face that it hurt nearly as much as his memories. “In the corridor, right before Fred was killed, that was… that was the last time I ever saw him. He just lay there like a heap of dirty laundry, not even looking at me. I tried to talk to him, to tell him we’d get him to the Great Hall where he’d be safe, but then everything went crazy and Percy was dueling and Fred was caught in the explosion and… and…”
Harry laughed, shaking both their bodies with it. “Draco, Dragon, it works either way. And you still haven’t answered my question. Do you want to see your mother?”
Draco just blinked at him as he lit the candles around the room with a wandless burst of magic, sat down on the sofa, and pulled Draco’s legs across his lap.
Harry didn’t know if it was the habit of trusting Hermione or of obeying Dumbledore that stopped him dead in his tracks, but something did. He froze, one hand outstretched, his face contorted with rage and distress, while Hermione sobbed “It’s a trap! It’s a trap!”
Harry stared at him for a moment, then blurted out, "Do you always pick disguises that look like the Minister of Magic?"
Her tears quickened, and she opened her mouth to give Dobby a message for her mother, but remembered suddenly that there were four strangers listening to her. Flushing slightly, she muttered, "Wait just a moment, Dobby."
Except, it wasn’t Draco screaming. Draco was in a full body bind and couldn't do so much as whimper. But Ron distinctly heard a scream—a terrible, animal howl of pain and rage. And as he watched the blade fall again, watched Bellatrix Lestrange grab Draco's adamant hand and twist it grotesquely, he drew in a great, sobbing breath and screamed again.
Whether Bill picked up on the shift in his mood, or simply decided that they had nothing left to say to each other, he rose to his feet and brushed the dirt from the seat of his well-cut trousers. "See you around, Malfoy."
The Ministry was his last resort, and now it had failed him. Everyone had failed, but Harry most of all.
With another groan, another curse, he fell back on his pillow and glared at the back turned so heartlessly on him.
“In fact, I am,” Draco replied without taking his eyes from Harry’s grinning face and the lipstick smearing his mouth. He smiled back and wiped at Harry’s lower lip with his thumb. They both laughed.
Harry shook his head. “It’s not that easy, Dragon. You haven’t said a word about… about Azkaban, haven’t even asked how we got you out. It’s like you’ve been pretending that it wasn’t real.”
The second man crouched to Draco’s left and pulled his arm out straight. Draco twisted his head to watch as the man shoved his sleeve up to his elbow, baring his pale arm. And there it was for all to see. His crowning act of stupidity. The one mistake he could never erase, live down or apologize for enough. The fucking Dark Mark.
“Okay,” Harry said hastily, “you can go back to chanting, now.” He turned his attention to his custard once more. “Where’s your auntie?”
He leaned closer to the mirror and fingered the brand on his cheek again, scowling at his reflection as he tried to distance himself from the shame and pain of wearing this ugly thing. He knew what his classmates would say about it. They would be no more understanding of his scar than they were of his shift in loyalties or his attachment to Harry.
Draco shrugged and nodded, once more trying not to show his pleasure. He loved spiced cider, and he felt a warm, happy glow in the pit of his stomach at the thought that Harry had spent his evening dreaming up proper Christmas Eve treats to share with him on this icy tower roof. The cider was a coincidence, he knew, but it made him ridiculously happy anyway.
Helpless to resist, he opened his mouth and drank. The potion tasted of strawberries and mint. Draco hated strawberries and mint, but he swallowed it anyway, hiccuping childishly on his tears as he did so.
Dead silence met his words. Narcissa stared at him, her face perfectly composed but deathly white, then cut her eyes over to where Ron still stood in the doorway, tea cup forgotten in his hands. Harry caught the direction of her gaze and understood at once.
“Yeah, but it’s different with Rose here.” He took a chocolate biscuit from the plate she set in front of him, bit into it, then said around the mouthful, “Aren’t you anxious to get back to work?”
“Tomorrow mid-afternoon. The official Ministry statement will go out at the end of the day, so it’ll be in the
“I was with you all night, first at the hospital, then here. You woke up once because of a nightmare, but you weren’t really yourself.”
Another wave of his wand, and two plates appeared above the desk with a pop. One contained a pile of neat sandwiches, their crusts duly trimmed off, and the other an even larger pile of chocolate biscuits. Harry’s stomach promptly grumbled. He accepted a cup of tea from Dumbledore, took a grateful sip, and reached for a sandwich.
Narcissa watched the formula fly into a cupboard that shut itself as she sat primly in a kitchen chair. “I’ll never understand why you don’t employ a house-elf,” she commented.
"Not even the Muggle-borns? The children of your foes?" He paused for effect, then added softly, "Harry Potter?" At the tightening of Malfoy's face, he shook his head and went on, "No, Lucius, I will not trust to the mercy of Voldemort so easily. I will have your sworn oath, sealed by magic, before I send one child out of this castle."
A combined birthday celebration for Harry, Draco and Bob, held at the Weasley family home and including half the population of Magical Britain, might be considered a challenge for anyone not born a Weasley. For a pair of reformed Death Eaters who had spent most of the last dozen years living in virtual isolation, it was something closer to a Trial by Fire. Harry had repeatedly warned his husband not to expect miracles, but Draco had (as usual) ignored him and was now reaping the rewards—the sight of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy sipping drinks from mismatched glasses and exchanging pleasantries with Arthur Weasley, while a garden gnome took refuge in the skirts of Lucius’ robes.
The forbidden name turned to a groan, as Harry’s tongue thrust into his mouth and Harry’s arms tightened around him. He was half in the taller boy’s lap by the time they came up for air again. The Gryffindor moved to nibble at his ear, then at his throat, and Draco moaned softly.
Lucius shook his head. "How could you grow up in my house, see me every day of your life, and know so little of me?"
“Hmph. Just be careful, Ed. I took a risk, letting you move on him without informing Potter, and you blew it.”
"Well, besides the Death Eaters and the fact that we can't leave the dungeons and all that. I mean, there's no problem with Malfoy. He's mostly dead, Ron. He can't do anything to me."
That was the best he could come up with. He couldn’t brush off the question with lying platitudes, but he couldn’t tell the full truth, either. Draco’s struggles to eat and sleep, his physical and mental torment, his constant nightmares, his inability to leave the sofa that bounded his world without Harry’s arms around him to hold back the fear were none of Kingsley’s business.
Draco had the most amazing hair he'd ever seen. It didn't really belong on a living person. It belonged in a painting, on some kind of Medieval archangel, with a halo made of gold leaf behind his head to make it glow when the light hit it. It looked out of place on a sixteen-year-old wizard in flannel pajamas.
“Professor Snape,” Draco said, smothering an instinctive jolt of suspicion at the sound of his name.
“If you let Warwick hurt him…” Harry began, starting for Robards once more, his magic sparking dangerously.
“Hmph,” Draco snorted. He still did not relax into Harry’s arms or give him any hint as to his thoughts, but he had stopped swearing and growling and lashing out, which Harry took to be a good sign.
He knows I love him. He knows I’ll give him what I can, but he’d never ask me to… to…” He faltered, letting the rest of that thought die unsaid.
“Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, of course. Phineas Boggs—the first victim, wasn’t he? That looks like one of the Black sisters—the younger one, I assume, since Bellatrix is dead. I’ve met all of them, at one time or another, at Ministry functions or society affairs.”
Harry pulled his Firebolt around in a long, sweeping turn, craning his neck to look back over his shoulder. Draco must have spotted the snitch, because he had gone into a screaming dive that left Harry breathless. The Nimbus 2001 did not have nearly the speed of a Firebolt, but Draco had a reckless, neck-or-nothing style to his flying that squeezed every particle of power from the broom and then some. Watching him, Harry would never guess that his own broom could out-perform Draco's without its rider breaking a sweat.
Both boys enjoyed themselves hugely, until Harry found a large, squishy package labeled: For Miss Potter from the Weasleys. He turned it over and over, a worried frown on his face. “I know the Weasleys were here for the ball. I probably should have said hello.”
Ron was suddenly at his shoulder, bristling with anger. “What’s this about? You can’t just take an Auror’s wand!”
Robards scowled at him more ferociously than ever, but Draco accepted his hostility without a blink. Having made the choice to come here, to take steps he knew his husband would descry, to indulge his Inner Malfoy, he found that he enjoyed it. Maybe a little too much.
Draco dropped his gaze. Closed his eyes. Let the touch of Harry’s hand on his hair comfort him. He was aching to crawl back into the other man’s arms, onto his lap, into his warmth, but fear held him immobile.
In the next instant, before he could lash out at his friends again, Draco felt himself shoved into a too-tight tube. All the air was crushed from his lungs. There was a lurch and they were standing in their own bedroom.
into existence beside him, his peacoat clutched in her skinny arms. The elf waited for Narcissa to kiss Draco lightly on either cheek, then she held out the coat to him, forcing him to let go of his mother’s hands.
Harry unrolled the paper and stared in amazement at the mark scrawled in poison-green ink across the page. He had passed! And not merely squeaked by, but managed a respectable grade! Hermione looked just as stunned as Harry himself when she caught sight of his mark.
More applause filled the room, but Harry was focused on one part of Fudge’s speech and paid no mind to the rest.
Harry nodded at the stranger and tried to slide away, only to find himself nearly trampling a witch who clutched a clumsily-lettered sign reading
“I won’t be gone long—not if I have anything to say about it.” Harry reached for the polished, black shoes at the bottom of the wardrobe. “Kreacher left a full English in the kitchen, and he brought a pile of new books from Grimmauld Place.”
Ron gave a soggy, gulping laugh and wiped his nose on his sleeve. “Harry hates it when I call you that.”
“I brought you here from St. Mungo’s.” Harry cocked his head curiously. “Do you really not remember anything?”
“I didn’t want to, but she made me. It was… It was…” He took a gasping breath and sobbed brokenly, “
“Just retracing our steps,” the veteran Auror said, with unconvincing nonchalance, “looking for anything we might have missed. You interviewed the Tonks woman about her visit to the Manor, yeah?”
Harry laughed and reached for the plate. He dipped the biscuit in his tea, then took a bite, savoring it as though he had never tasted the like, and in some corner of his brain, he reflected that perhaps he had not. Perhaps food tasted better when evil was dead and the world was free.
Draco lay curled close to Harry’s side, head tucked into the hollow of his shoulder, body heavy with sleep. A lock of white-blond hair had slipped loose from its queue to fall across his cheek. Harry caught it with a fingertip and tucked it gently behind his ear. At his touch, Draco stirred, tightening his hold on the body supporting his and slotting his leg comfortably between Harry’s.
“You’ll figure it out. Smart little cocksucker like you. Just stay awake, keep your wits about you, and show your friends a good time.” Turning away from Draco, he bellowed, “Bring ’em in!”
He shook his head, smirking. “Defense Against the Dark Arts.” Harry gave a startled laugh, and Draco’s smirk turned to a grin. “Rubbish, I know, but that’s what she said.”
Brushing his knuckles down Draco’s cheek with infinite gentleness, Harry asked, “What got you so worked up tonight, Dragon?”
Dropping his cloak unceremoniously on the floor, he crossed to the settee in two strides and fell to his knees beside it. He laid a hand on Draco’s arm and felt it tense. Draco wasn’t shaking or crying—in fact, he was preternaturally calm—but he might just as well have been.
“You could say that.” Robards’ dark, deep-set eyes cut over to Ron. “Not you, Weasley. Just Potter. And I’ll have your wand.”
, as you so elegantly put it, because my mother is all alone in that fucking cottage, practically a prisoner, driving herself mad over things that happened to me years ago that she can’t possibly fix, and
“Maybe you can’t get all the property back, but you know what it was worth and what was in the family vaults at Gringotts. All of that rightfully belongs to Draco. And Boggs won’t need the Manor anymore if he’s in prison where he belongs, so you can return that, as well.”
Draco must have heard footsteps against stone at that moment, because he stiffened, his face hardening, and scrambled to his feet. Harry instinctively pulled back, not wanting to have Draco pass through him, no matter how invisible or vaporous he might be. His backside landed hard on the floor, and he scuttled out of Draco's path, as the other boy took a step toward the bars.
“Draco’s Patronus, obviously,” Harry replied, now eyeing the piles of parchment and file folders on his desk in dismay.
Professor Tidsworthy was a hunched, wizened, grizzled man with almost as many scars as Alastor Moody, though rather more of his original body parts. He seemed to be collapsing in on himself with age, getting smaller and thinner and greyer by the minute. His eyes were constantly red and rheumy, never seeming to focus on the students in front of him. Draco was quite sure that they couldn’t focus on his new assistant properly, since he referred to him as Young Potter without
It was a petty act of defiance, pointless and more than a little beneath him, but it started a warm glow in the pit of his stomach. He was smiling to himself as he slammed out of the room and headed for the floo.
Dumbledore touched him with his wand, and Draco felt an incredible, shattering inrush of emotion. His body unlocked, his lungs sobbed for air, his heart tried to leap out of his chest, and a blinding pain ignited behind his eyes.
The stars were enormous, burning so brightly that they hurt his eyes. They seemed close enough to touch, if he could only climb atop one of the standing stones and stretch out his hand, close enough to set the grass afire with a stray spark. Harry stared at them, amazed, then turned to Dumbledore and whispered,
“You forgave me for fucking half the wizards in Britain. I think I can forgive you for doing one reckless thing in your quest to save me from my own appalling choices.”
“Don’t hold yourself so cheaply, Nephew. In your own colorful way, you are the best of two great and powerful families. And you will be an excellent role model for your son, whether he turns out to be the patriarch of a wizarding dynasty, bent as a coat hanger, or anything in between.”
At his movement, the voices broke off. Then one of them said, “It looks like he’ll be awake soon, so I’d better see about breakfast. I expect you’re both hungry.”
Harry caught him two steps from the bed and wrapped both arms around him. Draco struggled like a mad thing, twisting, turning and lashing out with elbows and knees. When Harry didn’t falter, he uttered a wordless cry and grabbed fistfuls of his robe, straining to push him away, to push himself free of the larger man’s arms. Harry hung on for all he was worth, pulling his head away when Draco tried to claw it, then butt it with his own forehead.
She took his hand, pressing a kiss to the back, then cradling it beneath her chin. Her free hand dropped to stroke his hair. “Thank goodness you’re alive. When I heard…”
Harry jerked back, his chair skidding against the floor, only to fetch up against the one behind him at the next table. The air rushed out of his lungs on a sob. Then Neville’s hand closed on his arm.
Harry nodded, still struggling for control. Finally, he asked, in an attempt to distract himself, "How did you make this room so quickly?"
“Come for me, my beauty.” Potter heaved up against him, burying himself to the hilt, and urged, “Come on…”
"I reckon he'd have liked what you did today. Put us all in our place. Told us what was what." Diggory's face turned pink, but whether with embarrassment at the admission he was making or at pleasure in thinking of Cedric's approval Harry could not tell. "Cedric would have been right there with you, if he knew what kind of rubbishing thing we were trying to do. Right beside you, telling his old dad not to be such a berk. He was a great gun, my Ceddie, as brave and as true as they come."
“Draco Potter is generous to a miserable house-elf. He is a noble wizard, worthy of Kreacher’s service, unlike Kreacher’s master, who forgets all about him then tries to send him away.”
Harry fidgeted with his teacup for a moment, weighing her words, then fixed his eyes on her preternaturally calm face again. “How do you explain the servants’ mistake?”
Draco supposed he should be grateful that this was the worst Lucius had to say about his love affair with Harry Potter, but he wasn’t in the mood for gratitude. He was still seething, sickened by thoughts of what his parents had done and enraged that he was now saddled with a child he didn’t want. A child that Harry was already more than half in love with, curse his sodding susceptible Gryffindor heart!
When they finally issued forth from the twins' room, Harry was ravenously hungry and deeply contented. He cast a sideways glance at Draco, wondering if every member of the Weasley family would be able to see in that beautiful face exactly what they had been doing upstairs. Harry could see it, but then, Harry knew Draco better than he knew himself, and what others could not even guess at, he could read with certainty.
“They wouldn’t be, except that I know for a fact your boy, here, is not Colin Creevey. Colin Creevey died in the Battle of Hogwarts.”
"You don't have to talk about your parents, if you don't want to, but you also don't have to stop yourself every time you're about to mention one of them. We all know who they are…"
So wipe that stupid expression off your face and quit acting like you just caught the Snitch at the Quidditch World Cup, because we are
“Watch your tongue around the foul urchin. Considering who his parents are, he’s probably storing up every word you say to throw back at you in another month or two.”
That finally got Harry’s undivided attention. Setting down the saucer of eggs, he frowned over at his gobsmacked husband. “What is it?”
She folded her hands over her midriff and lifted her chin proudly. “I have tea and a good fire waiting at my cottage, if you gentlemen would care to join me.”
Blaise frowned at him. Crabbe didn't like Blaise Zabini. She made him nervous. She was almost as smart as Malfoy and twice as mean when she didn't get her way. And she was a girl, which made her dangerous in ways Malfoy would never be. "Why was Potter there?"
Harry laughed and went back to his book, while Abraxas settled his head onto his paws again. Quiet closed over the room as Wizard and cat returned to their preferred forms of relaxation. The only sound was the crackle of flames on the hearth and the rustle of pages.
“Malfoy!” Hands caught his shoulders, lifting and turning him, until he felt his weight fall against another body and strong arms go around him. He gagged on another mouthful of blood, coughed, and felt it soak the fabric against his cheek.
Meanwhile, Draco would gladly trade places with Clive Prewett, if it meant that he didn't have to drag the Malfoy name behind him like a rotting corpse.
Draco nodded and turned back to his mirror, catching Nero’s eyes in it. The other man was studying him in a narrow, calculating way that belied his childish face and simpering manner. Draco knew that look very well. He was subject to it every time he stepped onstage, ever since the night he’d tried to perform when he was too loaded to stay on his feet.
They edged a step or two closer to the fireplace, but Narcissa was squarely in their path, refusing to move.
Draco could see it—the link shining crimson in the darkness—and sense the presence at the end of it. His power was flowing through it, into the other boy, but it wasn’t enough. Not nearly enough. He didn’t hesitate, didn’t pause for thought, just gathered every shred of power, thought, emotion and awareness, and flung himself headlong into the link.
“But not me, apparently, even though I’m the one who feeds him every day and puts up with his attitude!”
Only a few minutes after this exchange, Draco pushed back his chair and stood up. “I’d better get back. Thanks for the tea, Hagrid, and for…” He held up his bandaged arm.
“You’re from the Ministry?” She couldn’t keep the disbelief from her voice, however rude it sounded.
“Wouldn’t it be better to wake him up?” Ron asked worriedly. “He might hurt himself, thrashing around like that.”
“Of course not. In fact, we don’t know what project he is so concerned about. His professors are as baffled as we are by his behavior.”
Squaring his shoulders, fighting the urge to apparate straight back to the Burrow and the sofa and his husband, he marched over to the fireplace and lit the log waiting in it with a flick of his hand. Flames danced orange and blue around it.
“He’s bleeding on the bar. Disgusting. Little twat shouldn’t be out in public without a keeper. Or a leash.”
Dumbledore propped his elbows on the desktop, folded his hands, and offered Harry a wistful smile. “Here we are again, my boy. I can’t tell you how sorry I am.”
“That was three years ago,” Ron said in some surprise. “You’ve really gone that long without a wand?”
He broke the seal almost eagerly and spread the parchment flat. Draco hovered just far enough away that he could see the elegant, flowing script filling the page but could not read it, his eyes jumping from his mother’s words to his husband’s face and taking in his every reaction.
Lucius stepped once more into the cell but did not move any closer to his son than just inside the bars. "What we do to all traitors."
“His parents want him out,” Slughorn said lugubriously. His fat face drooped unhappily. “They’re sending him to Durmstrang, if they can arrange it with the Headmaster.”
Draco obediently lifted his face for Harry’s inspection. At the touch of those earnest, green eyes, he felt his cheeks flush afresh (with pleasure this time, instead of anger) and his lips soften into a seductive smile.
"We don't know that he isn't," Fudge said, testily. "That is one of the details we have to clear up today."
By the time Harry broke the kiss, Draco was teetering on the brink of climax, held back only by his determination to have his husband’s cock inside him when he came. Harry pulled back with a groan, then pressed his forehead to Draco’s and shut his eyes, breathing hard.
“I didn’t come here for tea. I have business to discuss with you, Dumbledore. Business that does not concern Mr. Potter!”
“I thought they’d taken him,” Draco whispered, his voice small and terrified. Then, more fretfully, “Where’s Granger with his ducklings?”
It was always punishing, no matter how carefully Harry prepared him. Harry was simply too big for Draco to hold easily, but Draco didn’t mind a bit of pain with his sex, and he never shied away from Harry’s assault on his too-tight arse. In fact, he welcomed it. Craved it. Demanded it. And every once in a while, when he was so hungry for Harry that he discarded even his dignity, begged for it.
“You’ve got to be sure, Dragon.” He broke the kiss, suddenly far too serious and more than a little nervous. “You’ve got to be
His nose was broken—swollen, blackened and crooked. Both eyes were blackened as well, the lids swollen shut with bruises. His cheek was slashed open to reveal the white of bone. His lips were split, bloodied, and crusted with substances that Harry didn’t want to think about.
Draco wanted to tell him that he was being a prat, that he had crossed the line into idiocy and ought to be ashamed of himself, that such foolishness was beneath him, Draco Malfoy, hero of the wizarding world, but instead, he smiled and looped his arms around Harry's neck, silencing him by pulling him into a long, deep, searing kiss that left no room or breath for words. After that, he completely forgot about Harry's pet names, until they were drifting into warm, exhausted sleep and he heard a beloved voice whisper in his ear,
Dumbledore sat behind his ornate desk, confronting the teachers crowded around it. The Heads of the four Houses, Professor Moody, Madam Pomfrey and Hagrid were seated on every sort of chair they could find or conjure, all staring at Dumbledore with varying degrees of shock and horror. Harry was there, too, but he stayed quietly in a window embrasure at the back of the room, making himself as close to invisible as he could manage without his cloak. He had no intention of calling attention to himself and getting ejected from this meeting.
They didn’t go far. Harry flew directly over the castle and down toward the carriageway that ran up to the great, oaken doors. Remembering the last Yule Ball, Harry was not surprised to find that Dumbledore had conjured up an ornamental rose garden to fill the lawn at the front of the castle. Wandering paths, trees and bushes, statuary and rushing fountains were all lit with twinkling fairy lights. A warming spell had banished last night’s heavy snowfall, and the figures strolling along the paths or sitting on curved benches wore nothing heavier than dress robes. As he landed just outside the shimmer of the spell, Harry heard music drifting through the open windows of the Hall.
Ron eyed the oversized bird, with its hard orange eyes and wicked beak, dubiously. "Aren't you afraid it'll rip your face off?"
Harry cast a measuring eye over him. “I’m surprised you could find any robes that fit. I swear you’ve gotten bigger just since last night.”
“You’re in a good mood,” Harry murmured in his ear, rocking his hips to rub his own growing erection against Draco’s hip. “If I’d known what was going on in those fabulous jeans, I’d have taken you home and fucked you senseless hours ago.”
Draco took the last step down, bringing himself abruptly into the room and under the eyes of the two women. They both turned to gape at him in horrified surprise.
“Bollocks.” Harry moved in the darkness. The candles in the wall sconces flared to life, revealing their broom cupboard bedroom and Harry’s muddled, sleep-softened, worried face on the pillow beside him. “You’ve been trying to feed me that shite all day. I’m not swallowing it.”
Marchbanks broke off and turned to gaze at the sea of purple robes above her. A small, wispy figure rose to its feet that Draco recognized as Wilkie Twycross, the wizard who had taught Apparition classes at Hogwarts. He looked as insubstantial as ever but far more animated than he ever had in class. There was nothing vague or dreamy about him today.
The pain was too much to bear is silence. Sobs shook him and tears of blood trickled sluggishly down his face, but they gave him no relief. In the depths of his despair, all he could do was whisper Harry’s name like a shield against the darkness.
Harry jerked his arm away and muttered back, "I don't want to think about that. I just want to get this over with, do what I can to save Malfoy's rotten life, and then never have to look at his ugly face again."
"Excellent." Dumbledore visibly relaxed, settling back in his chair and sipping his tea. "He'll mend."
“What do you mean, Severus?” Mother again, sounding worried. Her hand still stroked Draco’s hair, but she wasn’t looking down at him, so she didn’t see the message in his eyes.
Ron finally managed to muscle Harry out the door, but at that, he turned to spit over his shoulder, “He’s here because you ordered him to come! The entire fucking department heard it! So either he walks away free, or I go to Shacklebolt and tell him that you ambushed your own man, with about a dozen witnesses to back up me up! And I’ll tell him about the illegal Trace on Malfoy’s wand, while I’m at it!”
Dumbledore sighed and gave Harry a look of understanding that only made him feel worse. “Let’s be frank with one another, shall we?”
Draco twisted around to look up at the figure crowding close to his left shoulder but he couldn’t bring it into focus. “Who the fuck’re you?”
Dumbledore eyed the chairs in amusement, pulled out his wand, and gave it a flourish. The chairs grew several inches, and cushions in Dumbledore's favorite Victorian print appeared on their seats. Fudge watched, tight-lipped, as Dumbledore added curved, padded arms for good measure then motioned for Harry to take his seat. Titters and chuckles sounded from various points around the room.
The screaming wouldn’t stop. He was back in the hospital wing, huddled against the headboard of his bed, bathed in sunlight with no dark-robed figures in sight. No Greyback. No Lucius. But still he screamed and shook and wept, while strong hands held his arms and a familiar voice spoke from just above him.
you,” Ron cut in, “and that’s what he says he’ll do, if you aren’t in his office in the next ten minutes!”
“Of course Dobby can fix it.” The elf smiled and gave a snap of his fingers. Instantly, the mattress was smooth and clean, the pillows plumped and the bedding fresh. With another twinkling smile and another snap of his fingers, he sent a puff of comforting heat up from the quilt. “Dobby wants Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy to be comfortable.”
The beds in the hospital wing were not meant to hold two people, but the cramped quarters didn't bother Harry. The warm body sleeping next to him brought him far more comfort than all of Madam Pomfrey's extra pillows and self-straightening blankets. And for the first time in days, he actually relaxed. He fell asleep with the curve of Draco's back fitted into his side, Draco's bare foot hooked around his leg, and a contented smile on his face.
“Dead?” All the blood seemed to drain from Draco’s body in an instant. His lips went numb, his eyes blank, his limbs useless. He swayed drunkenly, unable to keep himself upright when no part of him functioned properly, and nearly fell.
“Nngh!” Draco groaned. His hand pushed between them, skimmed down Harry’s chest and found the lump in his jeans. He closed his fingers around it and squeezed. “I want that inside me.”
Once he’d extinguished the lamps, Harry curled into Draco’s side and rested a proprietary hand on his belly. Draco, unusually, did not roll over so Harry could spoon up behind him, just lay on a heap of pillows with the kitten purring against his throat.
Everyone in the group—Neville, Hannah, Cho, Ginny, even McGonagall—turned to stare at her in disbelief, but it was Ron who pointed out the obvious.
“Both, I should think, but the law is clear. As most of you are aware, my area of expertise is Wizarding law as it concerns the regulation of Non-Human Magical Creatures, and while I don’t have much to do with Veela, I’m very familiar with this law.” She gave Narcissa, who was visibly fuming, a hard look. “You allowed that woman to rape your son. That’s a fact. Worse, you paid her to do it, then you erased his memory so he wouldn’t realize that he’d been violated. You may not have grasped the legal implications of what you were doing, but you certainly knew it was wrong. Why else would you hide it from him?”
Draco pushed himself away from the other boy and fixed him with a sour glare. “Fucking heroic Gryffindor git
“Shut it, Ron,” Harry ordered, his hands still clasping Draco’s head and his mouth only a finger’s breadth from the other man’s. Then, more privately, he said, “I know you didn’t mean it like that. And you know I never meant to take control of your life.”
Neville shook his head stubbornly. “It can’t be. Only, what’re the chances that he’d turn up here on the very night that Harry disappears?”
Draco scowled at the sleeping bundle in Harry’s lap, wondering how he was supposed to answer that question.
In answer to this, Bob stretched out his drool-slicked hand toward the nearest student and laughed. This one was a boy, but he looked every bit as smitten as the girl behind him.
Both men cut glances at the boy watching them so curiously from his highchair, and Draco mentally cursed himself for his carelessness. Hormones were turning his brain to mush. One more week of this, and he’d be blabbing his secrets to every stranger on the street, with no thought for the consequences.
“He has to sleep,” Harry said gently, “but it won’t be like before. He’ll be able to wake up when we need him.”
" After that, Harry decided that he'd had enough and called a halt to the practice. He handed the chest full of equipment over to Madam Hooch, nodding tiredly when she griped that she should have locked up the shed half an hour ago, then trudged up the long hill to the castle at Ron's side.
“Nope.” He grinned up at her, radiating that effortless Harry Potter charm that never ceased to make Draco’s blood boil—with resentment or lust, depending on the circumstances.
“We need the statement, Harry, and we have to follow the correct procedures to get it. All neat and tidy and by the book, so no one can challenge it.”
Hermione goggled at her housemate. Ron threw a wad of parchment at him. Draco just shook his head, at a loss for words, then sat down and tried to concentrate on what McGonagall was saying.
Where was that wonder now? Buried under a pile of paperwork and mired in a swamp of petty politics, most likely.
Harry eased out of him and turned to sit on the desk beside him. Draco slid back to plant his arse firmly on the wood, then he folded his hands together and tucked them between his knees. He felt oddly self-conscious, sitting there in nothing but his loosened tie and an unbuttoned shirt, come pooling on the desk beneath him and slicking his thighs, but he didn’t want to be anywhere else. And he didn’t want to clean or dress himself until he knew what Harry intended to do next. So he crossed his ankles, tucked his bare thighs in tight around his locked hands, and turned wary eyes on the other boy.
He charged into the hallway, half-crazed with fear that they had slept too long and put the fragile, new life Draco carried in peril, only to come screeching to a halt just outside the door. His head came up, and he sniffed the air. Bacon. Coffee. Eggs in butter.
“Before, when Cousin Draco was here, everybody was yelling. It was really bad. Felix got so scared that he did magic, even though he’s not s’posed to, then Cousin Draco said something about the baby dying if…”
“Is that what Malfoy’s doing, Weasley?! Kissing your arse?! I knew he was a slag, but I didn’t know you were that desperate!”
“Right.” He could hear the grin in Harry’s voice. “The whole school is saying they’ve caught the Slytherin Pox, which makes Snape smoke at the ears, but the rest of us think it’s hilarious.” He sobered. “Far as I can tell, Dumbledore is keeping them under wraps so that no one finds out what really happened to you. He doesn’t want the Ministry or your family involved, until he’s got all the facts.”
He could still hear the pain in Draco's voice - an old, festering, bitter pain that had ripened over years - when he spoke of that day. And he knew that someone as proud and prickly as Draco would never risk a second rejection of that magnitude. Would Harry, if he were in Draco's shoes? Maybe, but as Dumbledore had said - was it only a few weeks ago? - Harry always listened to his heart.
Harry took care of him. Harry rubbed his aching feet, brought him tea and toast in bed, stood with him in the shower to soap his body clean, painted colorful streaks in his hair to sweeten his sour moods, kissed the pout from his lips, and fucked him up against the wall every chance he got. Harry poured love and magic into him without stinting, taking away the pain and filling him with enough power to make a hundred babies.
Shadows whirled in, shrieking like tortured spirits. The light shattered into a hundred colors where it struck stone, each shard pulsing with the quickening beat of Draco's heart. Black cloaks flapped like crows' wings, feet pounded against the grass, curses burned the air, and through it all the patronus raced, scattering Dementors and Death Eaters alike before it. Voldemort's voice rose above the din, but Harry could make out no words in its thin, piercing cry.
, Felix! Be quiet and eat your breakfast. And you,” Harry turned a stern look on his husband, “watch what you say in front of that little menace.”
He sighed and ran a hand through his grimy hair. The Fat Lady pursed her lips in disapproval, but whether at his scruffy appearance or his delay in giving the password, he couldn't tell. Finally, he pulled his shoulders up straight, bracing himself for the worst, and said, "Betwattled."
He’d promised Robards that he would clear his desk today—complete all his half-finished incident reports, sort out the jumbled case files, and get them down to Records for archiving. There was at least eight hours of work lying there in front of him, and he’d already managed to waste half the day drinking tea and arsing about with Ron (not that Star Auror Harry Potter was a chronic procrastinator, mind you). Now Draco needed him, and if Harry was right about what had inspired that peremptory summons, he wouldn’t be getting his paperwork done anytime soon.
Harry abruptly pushed back his chair and got to his feet. "I'm not hungry." Ignoring Mrs. Weasley's anxious look and Sirius' call to wait, he turned and ran up the stairs, two at a time.
Harry audibly ground his teeth, his anger simmering and his magic flaring dangerously. Hermione reached across the table again to clasp his arm in comfort and warning.
She said it in all innocence, but Ginny, being Ginny, could not help turning it into something else. Pulling Draco’s arm tightly to her chest, she cooed, “We do, don’t we? I’ve decided that Draco is my next celebrity conquest. When our picture turns up on the front page of the
He swallowed again (gulped, really), hesitated, then nodded. McGonagall didn’t beam—she was not a beamer by nature—but her smile turned smug and her eyes glinted with satisfaction.
Harry turned to look at the bodies laid out so neatly on the grass and felt his stomach clench in horror. He recognized them as the students taken from Hogwarts—the two Hufflepuff girls, Justin and Padma, Luna, Neville, Colin. And closest to him, her hand lying palm up on the grass not six inches from his foot, was Ginny Weasley. Ron was not there, and neither was Draco. Harry allowed himself half a second to wonder if this was a good thing or a bad, then he resolutely shut his mind to all thought of his missing lover and his friend to concentrate on the matter at hand. Voldemort.
“Honestly?” Both his brows rose now, his face reddening still more. “I don’t know. It was in my room this morning and I needed something warm.”
“You want me to shag you on the kitchen table?” Harry asked, his hands now gripping Draco’s bare thighs hard enough to bruise, his hips thrusting forward, his cock desperate for contact with its mate.
Potter's face. He had turned to look at Draco, just as Black hauled him out of the room, and the expression on his face seemed to be burned on Draco's eyes. Every time he let his mind fall still for a moment, it came back to him. He could not find a word to describe it.
“No, I’m not giving you the chance to talk me out of it! You… put on your warmest clothes. And ask Madam Pomfrey to get Lily dressed! I’ll be back in a few minutes!” With that, he bolted out of the room, leaving Draco staring after him in bewilderment.
Percy Weasley got to his feet and, in his usual prissy way, began the formalities. Draco didn’t bother to listen. He knew the routine all too well and didn’t need to hear the charges against Harry. Instead, he passed the time pondering the success of his opening gambit.
Something very close to a growl rose in his throat, cowing her into silence. Then he said, through his teeth, “She’s not defenseless. She’s a criminal and a murderer.”
“To relieve the growing tension in the castle. To give all those frightened children one more day of freedom before the next blow fell.” He shrugged. “Perhaps to prove that I was one step ahead of my adversary, that I could use his own weapons against him. I’m a proud man, Harry. Some might say arrogant. I put more faith in my own abilities than in anything or anyone else, and it has been my downfall on more than one occasion. Each time, I tell myself that I’ve learned my lesson. Each time, I promise myself that I won’t repeat the mistake. And each time, I do.”
