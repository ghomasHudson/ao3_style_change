“Teddy, why don’t you go get your sketchbook and show Harry your latest drawings?” she smiled.
Draco grips the joggers and turns back to Potter. His serene features are paler than usual, his cheeks lacking in their normal lively color. Draco resolves to get Potter clothed and averts his eyes as he shuffles to the other end of the sofa. After casting a Warming Charm on the joggers, Draco attempts to pull them up over Potter’s legs.
“What did you smell,” Potter said. His eyes were bright and animated as he lifted the glass to his nose. “When you sniffed it?”
“Thank you,” Potter managed to say after they got over the flowerbeds. “I know you didn’t have to do this, but I appreciate it.”
Draco opened his eyes and pushed his panic aside.
“Blaise, you charlatan,” Draco purses his lips. “You know I don’t dance.”
? Oh, Draco, why would you keep this a secret from us. We are your friends, after all.”
Draco stills, quite shocked, questioning his memory of that particular painting and its private sale to an anonymous buyer. “Perhaps, your view of what
After the broadcast was over, they stood and stretched, and Harry buzzed with the thrill of the aftershow high.
Patil’s silverware clanked against her plate and her head jerked up, craning to the side to follow Draco’s line of sight.
“You’ve got it handled?” Blaise dragged Draco out the door.
Draco took a step back and paced in front of Potter’s bed. He recalled the E.A.R. log mentions of
“Let me stare at the label for a little while longer. Do you know what this is?” Draco whispered. Harry could tell his voice was close, just outside the box. “It’s an honest to Merlin automated label and it has my name on it. Somewhere my name is officially tied to this place. Mine and Harry’s.”
Of course, as soon as Blaise found out, he’d jumped at the chance to steal Draco away for a few afternoons a month of what he called
and I must say, Draco, dear, the use of pastels, the cheery airiness of it… That is not very…
many distractions.
“No,” Draco shook his head. “Sorry, I was mistaken. Thank you, good day.”
He created scenes and landscapes of post Second Wizarding War life.
Blaise smirks. “Is your wand ready?” He eyes Draco and then nods to Potter. “Hurry up, he’s going to catch his death. Did anyone bring any Pepper-Up?”
, he thought. He pocketed his wand and turned to leave, his ponytail sliding forward over his left shoulder.
“We’ll Patronus you,” Masker nodded.
“So cold.”
His mother stood, leaning against the door frame, eyeing him with a curious stare.
is all very sudden.”
Once Blaise joined them, he dressed Draco, despite the objections, in the black shirt and a pair of fitted dark jeans. While Draco agreed that objectively he did in fact look good, he didn’t feel quite like himself. Between the tight, constraining denim around his legs and waist and the looser fabric of the shirt with the top buttons left open, he struggled with a foreign unclad vulnerability.
Draco’s mouth dropped. “He—heals...fast?” He blinked. “You mean to say he has an active immune system and healthy cell regeneration indicative of a healthy person in peak physical condition.”
to wake up early and come in for his 6:30 a.m. meeting about funds related to the Browder-Ivanovich case.
It still didn’t feel real as he put on his robes the next morning and examined himself in the mirror. He looked the same as he had in Paris; pale skin, tied back long blond hair, the mole on his cheek near his left ear, the white, raised skin peeking up over the collar of his robes — the start of a long series of unhealable scars. There were few things that left scars one couldn’t magic away later. Those marks on his chest and abdomen were mere physical representations of the shadows and trauma that would be with him for the rest of his life.
. It didn’t make sense, and yet it felt distantly familiar.
Blaise grinned. “There he is. That’s the bastard I remember.” Draco rolled his eyes and softly shook his head from side to side in feigned contempt. Blaise held his stare for a few moments and his brows furrowed up in mild concern. “It isn’t the work that worries me, though. Should you —” He paused as if realising he needed to choose his next words wisely. “—be rushing into the job before getting settled?”
Draco blinks and turns around. Potter’s sat back on his heels with his arms crossed.
Alicia hadn’t taken her eyes off Draco and pressed him further. “Is it possible that the Dark Lord did something to your chambers to affect your ability to complete his assignment?”
If Draco believed in some cosmic collective irony, or karma, or wisdom nonsense, perhaps it would be mildly entertaining—fitting even—that he, Draco Malfoy, couldn’t prevail without that scarheaded buffoon making an appearance. But that line of negative thinking—he chastised himself for even allowing such thoughts to cloud his mind—was childish and not at all who Draco had become. His first patient had been a critically injured Harry Potter; the hardest case he could get was behind him.
“I don’t know, there’s lots of people I would save,” he turns his head to the side and stares off at the enclosure walls.
Draco deflected with his honest observation, “He looks terrible.”
When Draco stepped over the orange daylilies, he saw Andromeda standing over someone laid out on the ground and Teddy planted right next to her, unharmed.
“I appreciate that,” Draco replied. He couldn’t stand the way her face seemed pained at the topic, and he knew that she blamed herself for causing him distress. “I’m not angry,” he offered. “I’m not upset with you and I don’t blame you for seeing him.” He closed his eyes and searched for more honest words inside him. “I don’t blame you for still loving him.”
Really, Blaise only had himself to blame, he is—after all—the one who gifted Draco
“Me?” Harry moaned when Malfoy’s fingers squeezed harder around him. “You couldn’t wait to get your hands on my prick.”
The sun was just peeking through the bay windows of the foyer as Draco arrived home, exhausted and on edge after a gruelling fifteen-hour spinal regrowth. But it was Sunday, and he knew his mother had a full breakfast spread waiting for him. Draco had planned on eating and visiting with her before showering and passing out for at least a few hours of rest.
Potter breaks his reverie and sits down next to him. “You alright? You’ve been quiet ever since the Fae this afternoon.”
go from speaking about my father to—to—”
Draco changes his clothes and starts gathering his things. Blaise fixes the final dinner and everyone lingers in the great room, eating and drinking and lamenting the end of their vacation. At some point, Thomas suggests one last bonfire and everyone agrees.
“But I thought…” Weasley frowned.
It’s the first time you’ve ever been this afraid.
“What?”
“Well, you’re together.”
Draco shook his head, “I do not owe you!”
“Well, for starters, they aren’t just fashionable pirates, they’re fashionable
Draco scoffed. “For what?”
“Oh, Merlin,” Potter groans and Draco’s cock twitches. Sighing, Potter says, “It feels amazing in here.”
“I’ll be in Gryffindor!” Teddy proclaimed.
“Salazar, who let this man back in the field?” He shook his head and returned the chart to the nurse.
“Really?”
Blaise smirked and Draco got a terrible feeling.
She ran her hands down the outsides of his arms. “Of course you do,” she said. “You want to help him.”
Pansy got up to get them all a round of drinks, and while Greg turned to Daphne, Theo and Blaise seemed to be in a heated discussion with the man underneath Theo that no one had bothered to introduce to Draco. With everyone else otherwise engaged, Draco’s attention wandered back to the dance floor. He absentmindedly stared out into the crowd until his eyes landed on Potter.
“That’s fine,” Potter says, “I wasn’t going to wear one either.”
Harry felt the blush creep up from his chest at the backhanded compliment Malfoy had given him, and he did not particularly want to acknowledge how it made his cock twitch. “Sounds like you’ve been admiring my body, Malfoy,” Harry said, struggling against the restraints.
, sexuality—and how little those things actually mattered. What had meant the most to Draco, in the end, had been his mother’s love, a love which had been planted and nurtured and slowly cultivated a guiding voice within him. That voice had stopped him from murder, had stopped him from taking steps and going places that he could never come back from. He had made terrible choices in life, but that voice within him had kept him from making unthinkable mistakes.
“Still, how you had time to do all this after you—” Thomas swipes a hand over Finnigan’s mouth and cuts him off.
“Draco!” Blaise yells and dances up to them. “Come dance with us. I
“Yeah, Pans,
“Mate, what are you doing?”
Weasley stared at the bathroom and Draco knew he was thinking about confiscating the Dragon Tamer’s Potion. “If anyone found out he had that…”
“What do you mean?” Draco asked.
A simple Vitals Charm revealed an accelerating heart rate and extremely low pressure, which was no revelation given the amount of blood covering the man’s torso. Draco rushed a minor assessment on the large gash over the man’s left lung, certain it would show a hemothorax. It did. There was blood pooling in the man’s chest cavity.
“Seriously, Potter, are you sure you haven’t hit your head?”
Draco lets out a heavy sigh and narrows his eyes.
He finds his way into the kitchen and spies the table filled with wrapped gifts and envelopes, and mortification hits him that he’s forgotten to get a gift. He rushes home through the Floo to find an empty sketchbook and set of charcoals for Teddy.
“Hmm,” Draco nodded. He took one last look at the faded scar and then returned his attention to the open chest cavity.
“Draco, I’m not kidding.” Blaise bursts into the bathroom.
“No.” Draco looked away. “I will not see you. I will not acknowledge you. I will not speak with you until
Malfoy smiled against his neck. “Checking you for Time Moss, of course.”
“That could be arranged,” Malfoy strode into the office, a devious smirk plastered across his face. Harry frowned. “Potter, let’s go.”
“Fuck’s sake, do you mind?” Draco shouts from the shower.
“I am not Orion,” Draco says. Without a thought, he reaches out and squeezes Potter’s shoulder before padding into the kitchen to prepare the bonfire dinner. It’s only after a few minutes of distraction that Draco realises what a comfortable show of affection he’d just bestowed on Potter.
Draco let out a sigh of relief. He just needed to steady himself; he needed to be alone. “Potter,” he managed to say, his eyes still cast downward. “
Draco decided to try the bathroom and stepped over a pile of brightly coloured knitted jumpers before shuffling over a collection of shoes. He had to tiptoe around various piles of dirty clothes and towels to get to the counter. Atop the marble sat dozens of glass bottles, some empty and toppled over, others full to the brim of various elixirs and potions some of which he recognised by sight. There were anti-inflammatory potions, Skele-Gro, hangover cures, energy elixirs, Draught of Living Death, and—
Draco narrowed his eyes and replied to Blaise, “There’s nothing on this earth that can help that man.”
“Thank you for a delicious breakfast,” he smiled. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go pass out.”
He also realised how fucking exhausted he looked. Even in the flashing lights and moving shadows cast on the dance floor, Draco could make out the dark circles under Potter’s eyes.
Draco feels the blood rush from his face. He’d been a git to Harry that day.
Draco smirked. “It’s so much more than a bottle of wine. It’s an experience.” He gladly told her all about the vineyard where it was made in France and the few precious days he’d been able to steal away to spend there. When he closed his eyes, he could picture the golden sunrises on crisp mornings, and the genuine smiles from people who loved the simple wine and culture that they cultivated.
Draco and Narcissa had stepped through the front doors of the Manor on a Thursday afternoon and by Saturday morning most of the West Wing had been reopened, cleaned, and was relatively acceptable for daily living.
Potter stands in the entry to the hallway wearing a thick knitted jumper, a healthy color restored to his cheeks.
In the second week, Draco begins to lose track of time. One afternoon turns into evening and before he’s realised it, Harry cooks for him. Just as Draco walks into the kitchen to let him know he’s on his way out, he catches Harry uncorking a bottle of wine. Draco stills at the sight of Harry’s sleeves rolled up to his elbows, his muscular arms tan and taut and struggling with the cork.
He fumbles for a way to get out of the situation.
birthday.”
“How long has this been going on?” Ron asked. “It’s like you’re in school again!”
Blaise is smirking. Draco begins to panic. He agrees with his best friend but wants to smack him nonetheless. The more he stares at Potter’s chest, the more he regrets the night he and Blaise got pissed, and Draco admitted aloud that he wanks to thoughts of Potter. He knows he shouldn’t do it. Draco knows Potter’s unavailable, but once he started, he couldn’t stop. Only Potter stirs his blood in such a tantalising way. No one else can make Draco peak with just the thought of their brilliant eyes or perfect lips.
Draco nodded. “I didn’t mean anything by it. What with your forthright conversation in surgery…”
Draco blinked. “It didn’t turn up anything conclusive.”
The intern cleared his throat. “Patient presenting with...well, a night terror.”
“And the
“Aunt Andi!” Draco called out.
“Hiding in France for the last ten years doesn’t change the facts,” Pansy said.
“Shh,” she said softly and rubbed his back. “You don’t have to forgive someone to miss them.” She pushed him away ever so slightly so she could look him in the eyes. “And there is nothing wrong with loving someone that you can’t forgive.”
“They’ve kept me sane on more stakeouts than I can remember.”
Harry blinks and rolls off of him. He casts a wandless
“Don’t be so certain,” she said, picking up her toast. “The reckless ones take the biggest risks and have the greatest falls.”
Andromeda insisted Draco stay for lunch. He found himself plopped on a pillow on the floor of the sitting room drawing Quidditch moves in the air with his wand while Teddy looked on in awe. Potter sat on the couch with his broken Firebolt watching the two of them with keen interest, his broom mending kit forgotten to the side.
“Have you done the toast?” he asked.
“What!” Draco sits up. “Blaise…” He turns to toward the door. “Blaise!”
With such short notice, he couldn’t purchase another custom cake, but he managed to snag the last one available. Though not a birthday cake, it would have to suffice.
She smiled and they began walking toward the Apparition Point. “That could not have been easy,” she said. “Was that the first time you’d seen him?”
Potter smiles and lets go. Draco swallows down his disappointment at the loss of contact and continues across the tree.
“Pretty sure you pushed him, mate,” Blaise says idly.
promptly spit it out gracelessly across the table. “Circe, Blaise, what the fuck!” Everyone laughed and Draco quickly cast a
Harry laughs. “Keep trying. You’ll get it.”
“Only you,” Harry whispered, “Draco.”
There in the midst of unidentifiable bodies pressed together, he could easily discern Harry Potter clinging to a man and dancing provocatively to the music.
“What factors?” Weasley asked.
“It wasn’t me,” Ron cried. “Is this what’s wrong with him?”
“Draco. You
“Malfoy.” The tall redhead nodded. His face remained unreadable and Draco thought his jaw might be clenched but couldn’t tell for sure due to his bushy, auburn beard.
then.”
Separately, on Thursday and Sunday evenings, Pansy would stay over and offer assistance clearing Dark magic. Part of Draco’s added stress was his inability to sleep well, which he believed to be caused by several different errant spells and curses that lingered in his bedroom. In France, he’d used an altered version of the Dreamless Sleep potion of his own formula on occasion. He’d found it to be stronger and more dependable, a guaranteed good night’s rest. But he was wary of brewing it again having just resettled in Britain, where one of the key ingredients was illegal.
Harry squeezes his eyes shut and bites into Draco’s shoulder before coming all over his stomach a few thick, long streams of cum. He buries himself in Draco’s neck and slowly comes down from his orgasm, nipping at the tender skin he’d already marked.
Draco kept his eyes on the upcoming stone steps, but said, “I would’ve preferred—”
He poured himself another glass of wine. He let the warmth of it seep through him as he drank it. The flavours tickled his palate and the alcohol loosened his spirit. It managed to relax some of the parts of him that he kept coiled and subdued. Forty minutes passed and suddenly he was mildly drunk. So he let himself get angry.
Two days later, the blood bank ran out of O-positive and the shortage caused him issues and delays, forcing him to get creative with a patient’s surgical plan. He’d consulted a few medical papers but found little to assist him. For one of the first times in his career, the established texts had failed him. He had to rely on his own skill and ingenuity. Once again, he’d found himself standing in Pre-Op, a bundle of nerves and uncertainty. It reminded him of his first day. It reminded Draco of
Surely not, Draco thinks. He turns to the others.
There was a line, and they found themselves waiting for a few minutes in the dark corridor outside the door. Eventually, Blaise leaned in and lowered his voice. “Are you feeling a bit better, then? You look great compared to a month ago.”
Draco shook himself from the memory and immediately readied his Patronus with a message to Patil. Looking over his desk, he gathered any immediate paperwork and brought it with him to the Trauma Station, where he stayed busy until Potter’s room was set up and ready.
He’s saved the trouble when Harry says, “I’m sorry, I just realised the time. I can’t believe I’ve kept you this long, it’s nearly midnight.”
When he finally made it to the shoppe, he took a deep breath and calmly walked inside. It was just as he’d remembered, but he didn’t waste any time looking around. Draco headed straight to the counter, rang the bell, and waited to be helped.
mandated by the Chief of Healers who’d given an evaluation of Draco to the Board of Directors on the last day of summer.
house. The Manor.
Blaise made space for Draco and ushered him to take a seat. Once seated on the edge of the booth, Draco glanced to where Theo had pointed and froze.
Weasley didn’t acknowledge Draco’s words so he turned around. The man had been piling clothes from the floor onto the bed and using some rather old-fashioned charmwork to clean and fold them into tidy piles on the bed. But he’d stopped with this wand in the air and was staring solemnly at the bed, his eyes glossed over and unfocused.
“No—I thought—” Potter’s eyes widen as he sits back on his heels and looks up at Draco.
Draco wants to kiss him again, wants to get lost in the feel of his mouth and his wandering hands, but Harry grabs his face, forcing their eyes to meet.
“I—” Draco stared at her and suddenly felt an overwhelming rush of regret. How could he jeopardise what they were building by doing something illegal in their home? And for what? His own twisted satisfaction? Harry Potter’s arse?
“No,” Draco said quickly. He stopped and hastily tried to come up with an excuse. “I have some notes to finish before it goes into the record.”
Malfoy’s hands reached up and clasped Harry’s, pulling them from their grip on his suit. He smoothed his fingers over the affected material and readjusted the jacket around his shoulders with care.
“Harry,” Draco grabs his face and licks into his mouth. “Harry please,” he whispers. “Come for me.”
“It isn’t ethical,” he said. “It isn’t good for us, or for—”
Draco’s eyes almost fall out of his head as he realises what everyone else must be thinking. Suddenly his innocent afternoon spent reading to Potter feels dirtier than it deserves to.
gold?”
Harry groaned when Malfoy tugged up the hem of his jumper, hands exploring the bare skin underneath. “What’s that?”
“Where in Salazar’s name is Blaise?” Draco mutters. After another ten minutes pass, he joins Thomas and Finnigan and begrudgingly plays Fire Chess against Thomas.
They Apparated to a pavement on a posh street lined with large townhomes. Draco glanced around; he figured they were somewhere in London, perhaps Islington. Weasley took a step toward the homes and the two in front of them began rocking, separating from each other and shifting apart to reveal a third townhome between them.
make the altered Dreamless Sleep was solace enough to keep the nightmares at bay.
“Did you just say—” Draco caught Potter saying as he entered the room. When their eyes met, Draco almost fell backwards from the vibrant intensity of
. But on the rare occasion, his Mind Healer had insisted he use one, and for that, he could at least be grateful he was comfortable enough with the process to put his mind at ease now.
And as love stories go, this one isn’t too extraordinary, but Harry Potter — luckily — knows how much Draco Malfoy loves him.
“Don’t they also help alleviate erections?” she raises a brow.
“Hmm...” Potter grins and tosses the bottle to Draco.
“You want to give up on something before you even start it—anytime it has to do with your heart.” Blaise purses his lips. “It’s the only thing you know you can control.”
“This is about Potter, isn’t it?”
!” the man’s eyes gleamed. He smiled with a bit of bashful pride. “I managed to finish that this morning! Oh, apologies, I’m Caractacus Burke, Jr.”
He finished up his duties and changed into casual grey robes and a lightweight black cloak. Draco turned to check his appearance in the slender mirror he’d hung on the wall near his desk, and the reflection startled him.
“The MagiConservationists charmed the lake to stay at a certain temperature year-round to protect the endangered fauna within.” Weasley turns around, wide-eyed, as Draco adds, “The water is charmed to stay very cold. Unless you know the counter—”
“No, I’m just finding it difficult to believe that you’ve seen
“Merlin!” Draco shouts. The slightest press against his prostate sends a sizzle up into his core. Everytime Potter moves against it, something builds more and more inside him.
,” Draco paused. Weasley’s face sank into confusion and then quickly concern. “This is a bizarre request but I feel it is necessary. Potter’s bloodwork has come back and there...there are some…”
“You alright there, Weasley?” Draco approached him.
“My father used to take me here,” Draco answered quietly.
And it hadn’t necessarily
Lucius had urged Draco to do
The door behind him slammed opened and someone rushed in. Harry craned his head around and eyed Vesper from the Beast Division. The man stopped, hunched over, and rested his hands on his knees, panting heavily to catch his breath.
“Why the fuck not?” Harry burst out, his wide, enraged eyes darting up to Malfoy’s relaxed grey gaze.
!” Draco said.
“Your report recommends two weeks of bed rest and three additional weeks of rest and rehabilitation.” Potter’s jaw clenched.
He doesn’t recognise the potion brand, so he holds it up and reads the label aloud. “Hortwin’s Handy Happiness Handicraft Lubrica—”
. Draco had been apprehensive about any wild and crazy plans Blaise might’ve made, but the first afternoon saw them ending up at the Leaky Cauldron where they proceeded to get pissed and reminisce over their early school days, Pansy’s antics, and silly and strange stories from Draco’s time in Paris.
“That’s a two-hundred Galleon bottle of wine,” Draco scoffed. “You do not
It was late in the afternoon and Draco was getting ready to leave work. He’d had a short shift at the hospital, one of his new

indeed.
His old friend laughed and asked him a question just as the song changed abruptly. The new tune’s bass immediately became too overbearing for people across the table to hear each other, and eventually, they gave up trying to hold a conversation.
The man dropped his head back in his hands.
“Say it,” Malfoy commanded. “Say my name.”
Blaise smiled. “That’s the great thing about friends, Draco. You never have to ask.”
“This is ridiculous.” There was a crash as something metal hit the floor, presumably Potter’s food tray. “Where is Healer Grisham?”
be benched for at least a week.”
Draco tilted his head, unsure of where Potter was going with this. “That is standard for the injuries and trauma you went through.”
“I wish it were under better circumstances,” Luna said. “But I must ask you for the truth about the Pentacle Pirates.”
.” He handed Masker the results. “What does this tell you?”
“This way,” Draco said without thinking. He led him down the hallway and into the kitchen.
Joining him on the sofa, Draco asks, “You’re feeling better, then?”
?” Pansy frowned.
“No!”
“I don’t know what’s wrong with him,” Malfoy told her succinctly. “But
“I have everything I ever wanted right here,” he replied as he pulled a fondant penis out of Harry's hair. “Couldn’t ask for more.”
“Do you want to make it for him?”
All great masterpieces start with a blank canvas.
Draco took that as a cue to continue his conversation with Teddy, who quickly switched subjects to Gobstones and pulled out his set. The early afternoon flew by with discussions of Hogwarts and Teddy’s excitement to be finally attending school the following year. Andromeda had joined them but she sat silently in a rocking chair near the fireplace, nodding her head and smiling as she followed their conversation. They talked about classes, professors, Peeves, and the staircases, before inevitably delving into the Houses and their token characteristics.
“Sleep well, Draco.”
“Sometimes it takes a few tries to get things right,” Draco said, a knowing look in his eyes. He grabbed Harry’s hand and helped him step out of the cake.
It took a few visits before he told Pansy about his bedroom. The first time she set foot in it, she immediately went into a coughing fit and walked back out into the hallway.
Blaise storms off and joins the others as they discuss how they’re going to divide the five hot springs enclosures between them. Draco notices Potter lagging behind and briefly thinks he might be waiting for him. But that would be ridiculous.
“No,” he shakes his head. “I’m making—”
“Now take a long sip,” Draco said. “Slowly.”
He fell asleep thinking of friends, squirrels, and the unending list of reckless things people might do for the ones that they love.
“You mean does this giant pink cake covered in icing penises say
He poured himself a finger of Ogden’s and downed it immediately, lowering his hand so violently the glass nearly broke on the table. The sound of it sent a jolt of recognition through him.
“I can’t deal with you,” Blaise walks away and hauls himself into the sleigh to sit beside Longbottom.
Draco lets go of the sheets, lifting his hands to cup Potter’s jaw. “Keep going,” he whispers as the slide of his cock pushes in and passes the point of pleasure or pain, oscillating between the two in the most addictive sensation Draco has ever known.
He didn’t have the strength to tell her he hadn’t found a Mind Healer in Britain yet. With all the things he had to do between the move, the new job, the settling in, finding a suitable Mind Healer had completely been forgotten.
“Ta,” Blaise offered his arm, and in a blink, they were pulled through by their navels and dropped at the Apparition Point in Diagon.
Draco blinks and looks away, letting Blaise leave the room without another word. He’s sitting on the bed reeling, unable to fully grasp the whirlwind of different emotions storming inside him. He’s terrified, confused, aroused, hopeful, endeared, laughing nervously at the thought of Potter throwing himself into a lake. For him.
Draco closed his eyes. No one, not even Blaise, could get their hands on the potion that could knock out bloody dragons. Magizoologists and dragon tamers had to apply for special dispensations and grants just to acquire all the ingredients. Draco shook his head. “How did he get this?”
Before he could process what he was seeing, Mr Burke shuffled back to the counter saying something about silver knobs. Draco turned his head for a brief moment to acknowledge the man, and by the time he’d turned back around, Potter was nowhere to be seen.
“Careful, Harry. Talk like that will get you mandatory W.E.T. classes.”
Draco stared at the intern and titled his head. “A night terror,” he repeated.
“I thought you’d had an assessment before.”
“Bedroom,” Potter pulls away.
healing.”
Harry shivered as Malfoy’s words sent sparks of want through him and he didn’t skip a beat. “I want your mouth on me.”
“I enjoy the work.” Draco uncorks a bottle of red wine and begins pouring himself a glass.
Pansy’s eyes fell to him and she straightened up, her smile fading. In her normal voice, she said, “But anyway, I—we need your help with a Signet Curse.”
“Devouring—?”
Draco couldn’t be sure how long he slept before an incessant rattling against one of his windows roused him from his slumber.
Patil’s posture stiffened. “I should probably apologise,” she said slowly, “but I won’t. Being honest and blunt was something my Mind Healer encouraged me to do after the War.”
Smirking, Malfoy crossed his arms and licked his lips. Harry’s eyes followed the movement, glossing over as Malfoy’s efforts left his lips wet and pink. “We should depart,” that perfect mouth said. Harry blinked. “We wouldn’t want to keep our avid listeners waiting.”
At first, he focused on the family unit — the thing that perplexed him most — and how it had changed; suffered; evolved. The permanence of empty chairs at dinner tables, he thought, showed the mark of loved ones lost to death, but also, from the Death Eater’s view, life imprisonment. His self-portrait of his family’s Christmas dinner showed two older matriarchs, a six-year-old boy, and Draco seated at a table for eight. The missing figures were replaced with shadows and empty spaces, the hollow reminders of loss.
Draco knew he was quite capable of handling far worse injuries and yet he couldn’t shake the faint remnants of his earlier panic as he shut the door to his office. The sparsely decorated room had a desk, three chairs, an empty bookcase, and a large window with cream-coloured curtains. While it wasn’t much, it held the potential to be at the foundation of his success. He’d hold meetings, write papers, perhaps even unwind with a finger of Odgen’s after a long rotation. His imagination worked out different ways he could make it his own, and he allowed himself to contemplate the amount of time he might be at St Mungo’s.
He went to check on the Trauma Station and before he knew it, he’d handled on an Incurable Bat-Bogey Hex, assisted on a shattered leg regrowth with the Healer-in-Charge of Ortho, taken a forty-minute nap, and administered life-saving resuscitation on a group of teens who’d found their way into some Devil’s Snare. By the time Draco made it back to his office, the room was bathed in the light of a rising sun. He’d made it through his first full day.
He rolled his eyes and vanished the parchment, heading back to the kitchen with a smile on his face.
Draco got two fingers in the air for that and couldn’t help but laugh. “I can give you a numbing agent and cast a stasis on it before we Apparate to St Mungo’s.”
He grins at Draco. “You know,” Potter says as he leans forward and sets down his tea. “Muggles often use skin-to-skin contact to reverse hypothermia.”
“You saved enough. How many places do you think you could be at once? It was a war, Potter. The lives lost aren’t your responsibility.” Draco doesn’t say the blame falls to the Dark Lord, to the people who pledged service to him and carried out atrocities in his name. He doesn’t say he’s the one who should bear the breadth of the guilt between them.
“Why didn’t you pick Slytherin?” Teddy leaned toward Potter. “Is it because of…” he trailed off, clearly not comfortable with mentioning any iteration of Voldemort’s name.
“You’re right,” Potter nods. Draco’s certain he’s never heard Potter’s voice so deep. He’s never heard it come from a place like this. “I should be the one devouring you.”
“Good news?” Narcissa asked, a pitcher of orange juice in her hand.
“You have something on your face,” Potter focuses on Draco’s lips as he gets closer.
“They often do,” Potter narrows his eyes. He grabs his bag and walks into the hallway and out of sight. Draco resolves to not watch him as he goes and instead downs the rest of his wine. He’s almost finished the bottle by the time he makes his way outside. Weasley and Granger stand around the bonfire casting various kindling charms.
Draco padded down the hall and found the owl eagerly waiting for him with its talon stretched out. Grabbing Blaise’s reply, Draco offered Ophiuchus a treat with his other hand. “Thanks, Ophi.”
“For what?” he asked.
His face startled her and she accidentally woke her baby when she said, “I know you!”
“Sometimes I think if I had a redo,” Potter almost whispers, “There’s things I would go back and change.”
He came in a blistering wave of pleasure and overstimulation as Malfoy’s hand stroked him through his orgasm. He wasn’t sure when it ended but when he opened his eyes, Malfoy was casting a Cleaning Charm over both of them and releasing the bindings around Harry’s body. A warm hand came up to cup Harry’s cheek, and he leaned into the touch.
Draco attempted to dissuade her, but Pansy insisted.
“I’m aware of its size, Blaise.”
The contact seems to shock the other man and Potter startles back against the sofa. Draco watches the blanket around his shoulders slide off a few inches. He sees that a healthy color has returned to his skin and all Draco wants to do is to run his tongue over that collarbone and bite down.
“If only,” Draco sighs and stands up.
“You’re looking well,” Harry Potter had said to Draco at the punch table. Potter stood rigid and looked almost ill, pale and squinting at Draco in the sunlight. “At least, I mean, better than last time I saw you. Er—you know, at the trial?”
“He means if you see something suspicious, Owl us immediately.” Harry glared over the mics.
Draco turns to him and sighs. “Doesn’t matter, really. In the end, we’ll all be eating kebabs off the skewer, now won’t we?”
Potter can barely open his eyes through his lust haze. “Then invite me in.”
Potter opens the bag and grabs the bottle. He inspects it and eyes Draco with a coy smile.
Potter let out an aggravated sigh and fell back against his pillows. “I’m an Auror.”
“Use of silverware shouldn’t be how you measure civility,” Potter leans in. Draco can feel his warm breath against his cheek.
Malfoy interrupted, “Someone from the future might know a way around the spell.”
“I’ve been wanting to do this all day,” he whispered into the curve of Harry’s shoulder.
Potter frowns, his red lips swollen and indecently perfect. Draco hates himself for stopping Potter from wrapping those perfect lips around his cock, even if it would only ever be once, but he can’t let him pity fuck him.
“Merlin,” Draco ducks his head down to hide how much he laughs. He forgets the evening was supposed to be tiresome with poor company as the wine and conversation flow, and before Draco realises it, he’s having more fun than he’s had in ages.
Draco scoffed. “You know there isn’t!” He clenched his jaw and willed himself be unaffected by her taunts. “We’re...possibly...friends who are also enemies?”
Something flashes in Potter’s eyes and he says, “Turn over.”
“What—” he stops and stares, his mind unable to process what’s in front of him. It takes a few moments, but he blinks and licks his lips, and turns toward the open doors leading from his room to his studio.
Weasley clenched and unclenched his jaw several times as he stared at the bottle. Draco noticed the man’s hands were shaking. “He knows someone,” Weasley finally said. “On a dragon preserve.”
Sighing, Potter replied, “I was out on a...personal errand...and I may have dislocated my shoulder.”
with Head Auror Potter…” Draco smirked. He closed the door and walked back up to Harry. “Quite the dream come true.”
White hot adrenaline shot up from the pit of his stomach as Malfoy said his name. Harry gulped, nodded, and then reminded himself he was on the air. “Er—yes.”
“Reading,” Blaise repeats. “Draco, what in Salazar’s name is wrong with you?”
“Weasley,” Draco returned, he quickly formulated a suitable explanation for having been there. “Blaise Zabini asked me to deliver a pallet to you.”
“Really?” Harry asked.
“In a minute.”
They stood holding each other until there were no more tears between them. When Narcissa pulled away from him, Draco offered her a smile. “I love you,” he said. “And I want you to know that I could never be angry with you for the love in your heart.”
“Huh?”
“Gross,” Harry muttered. “Anyway, thanks for the call Luna.”
He and Patil finished up their assessments and recorded everything in the chart before handing it back to the intern and leaving the room. They stood in the hallway and stared at each other.
Granger agrees, “Yes! Malfoy, you haven’t left the vicinity of the cabin this entire trip.”
“N-no,” Potter’s voice cracked. He cleared his throat. “I’ve just never seen anyone drink wine that way.” He raised his right hand and scratched the back of his head. “Is that a...
“That’s because none of your friends have any taste.”
“Time heals all wounds?” Malfoy raised a brow, giving Harry a thoughtful, earnest stare. “Well there you have it, Imelda! Let the sting of past aggressions heal then invite them over for tea and biscuits.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “This late in the day?”
Draco sighed. “I don’t know.”
“Yes.”
Patil caught his gaze and nodded. “I’ll handle the cheque, Draco. Meet me outside.”
So it is with resignation that he starts his next painting which quickly becomes his latest attempt at portraying Harry Potter’s truth. Draco uses the sketch of Harry uncorking the wine bottle as inspiration to create a figure portrait of him looking determined in his Auror robes. He hangs up his previous attempts, the various depictions of Harry’s green eyes, the sketches of him from past events, the darker and more disfiguring works from an earlier time before he’d known what Harry had truly meant to him.
Teddy’s eyes widened. “What did you
“You’ll want this room to be used,” he says. He thinks of all the history and emptiness that fills Malfoy Manor and pictures all the rooms that stay vacant and covered in drop cloths, unable to imagine a time when they would ever be used again. Draco wonders why he’d never thought to restore his family home, and then it hits him. “You’ll want it to be lived in,” he says, “By you, by Teddy, and...the people you choose to make a life with.”
Potter bites his lip. “See, you would think that! But it’s really Phaeden’s inability to forgive Orion that stands in the way of reconciliation.”
Draco swallowed and kept his jaw clenched shut. Weasley’s words resonated with him and rang painfully and unexpectedly true. His first instinct was to abruptly contradict them and to let the record show that Draco Malfoy had never been
arousal — and while there was definitely a path to kink exploration there, instead he followed the deepest yearnings of his heart. It took quite a long time to figure out what those yearnings were. He had a few drunken nights, more than a few pub brawls and skirmishes, and several dozen hours with a mind healer before he could admit what exactly those yearnings were.
“Yes, alright,” she sniffed. “There is something

“Who’s hiding?” Blaise asked. He approached the table with two cups and a wide smile.
is, and well, frankly...and this is not meant to disrespect you, Healer Malfoy, but…”
He makes his way back to the great room and takes a tentative glance at the sofa. Potter’s awake and sitting up, cradling a cup of tea in his hands. Draco lingers in the hallway. He licks his lips, clutches the toiletries bag to his chest, and takes a step into the room. Potter’s green eyes flicker to his and the intensity captured in them is the hottest heat source in the room.
“It seems a bit depressing,” Longbottom added when Harry signed the paperwork and transferred the funds.
“Merlin,” Draco sighs. “Everyone must know.”
“Thank you for coming,” she said, a bit woefully.
“Wrong answer,” Potter says and removes his fingers.
He took a quick shower, cast a Blackout Charm on his bedroom windows, and slid under his plush comforter. He’d been sleeping much better since that night at the Tricky Thestral. While it brought him no pleasure admitting anything that might boost Blaise’s ego, Draco had to admit that his friend’s reassuring words and offer to get the Brilhante Berries had somehow flipped a switch in him, as if the knowledge that he
“Don’t,” the words are out before Draco can stop them, “look at those.” He begs. “Please.”
“You’re so fucking beautiful,” he says and meets Draco’s eyes. Potter’s flushed, biting his lips, eyeing Draco with awe as if he’s some sort of divine being. “I want you to come all over me, Draco. I want—”
“For…” Blaise bit his lip for a moment. “I can’t even count how many things.” “Come on, Blaise!” Draco insisted, “I can
“Come on Draco,” Blaise pleaded.
Blaise shook his head. “Salazar, no! Down the way. That shifty potions shoppe.” He licked his finger and flipped through a leather-bound logbook on the desk. “Aurors have been up and down Diagon rounding up the ringleaders and employees and asking
Weasley stepped onto the worn front steps. “It’s actually the Black residence.” He cast a silent charm on the battered front door and it creaked open immediately.
The coward didn’t even bother to sign the bloody thing. All Draco could bring himself to do was clench and unclench his jaw while he talked himself out of killing Harry Potter simply for lying to him. Draco knew that night in Bruges—
The back and forth between them tugged at the closed doors of some odd, amusing nostalgia. It was as if their words and his inebriation were breaking through most of Draco’s self-imposed barriers and allowing him to feel the familiar satisfaction gained from riling Potter up. The challenging glint in his eyes was beguiling, and Draco wanted more of it focused on him.
“You’re drunk,” Draco replied.

“Clear up my…” Harry trailed off as his eyes bolted to Malfoy’s similarly empty desktop. “Bugger me.”
good and rested.
Mr Burke wrapped up the silver and the Faberge jewellery boxes in protective brown paper before tying them up in string with the flick of his wand. After Draco settled the account and Burke thanked him for the Malfoy’s business, Draco couldn’t help but inquire about Potter’s presence. “Mister Burke, do you get a lot of Aurors in here?”
The assessment charm worked its way over the afflicted area in a fog of golden mist before clinging to Potter’s tanned leg, sinking beneath the skin.
Draco was too engrossed in the assessment to really appreciate the sincerity of Potter’s apology. It barely registered as he realised Potter’s injury was perhaps as mild as one could hope for considering he’d fallen from so high up.
He sighed and stopped in his tracks. “Yes.”
Draco grabs the things for his salad and a cutting board. “Did you have lunch?”
“And?” Draco rolled his eyes.
“I’m not sure this is a good idea,” Draco breathes. Half of him is screaming
Draco stopped and stared as the clerks turned back to what they’d been doing and ignored him. The shoppe had floor to ceiling shelves full of oddities. Some were spinning, making noises, or flashing brightly-coloured text in an effort to be noticed. Draco smiled slightly, remembering his rather juvenile efforts at creating the
“Yes, well…” Draco trails off, unable to formulate a coherent thought after the image of his bare skin against Potter’s flashes in his mind. His cock twitches and crosses his legs.
“How many times have you done that?” Draco finally asked.
Malfoy stared at him for a long time before he casually walked to the door, opened it, and called out, “Cancel the rest of my appointments for the rest of the week.”
He moans and starts to buck his hips, matching every one of Draco’s movements with more force than before. The shockwaves hit him; Draco knows he’s close. So close. He brings Potters hand to his cock and nods his head. With fingers covered in Draco’s slick, Potter wraps his hand around Draco’s cock and starts pumping.
Draco nods and a fluttering feeling takes over his chest at the smile on Harry’s face. It’s something slightly different than the smiles he’s stolen glances at before; this one is directed at him, and it’s positively radiant. He loves it and hates it all at once.
The assessment came back with normal readings for a person in the R.E.M. cycle of sleep. The charm sent back the wavelengths and other nominal stats before copying the emotions in small, blue clouds that rose above Potter’s head. Draco inhaled them quickly and let them permeate inside him.
truth.
“If only what?”
It was a rush of various things after that as Draco tried to get his other cases covered, because, for whatever reason, he felt obligated to take on Potter’s case himself. He went back to his office to get a moment to steady himself, but after he sat down and closed his eyes, all he could see was Potter standing in front him, all distractions and disappointment, saying, “
“Fuck,” he said as he pulled away from their kiss.
“You’ve done this before,” Draco said as he turned and walked over to the wardrobe. He cast a silent
Draco’s mouth falls open. “Where are you going?”
“Yeah, I make them when I’m—wait, what?” Potter’s agitated expression relaxes into one of confusion. “You know my favorite cookie?”
They enter the enclosure and Draco starts to panic. “I don’t have a suit.”
“I said,” Potter frowned, taking a step toward the doorway. “Move!” He clenched his jaw and quickly slammed his left shoulder into the doorframe, grunting and groaning before inevitably sighing in relief and sliding to the floor.
“Who is grilling the kebabs?” Draco asks.
“I see.” Draco turned the admission over in his mind and recalled what Pansy had said about visiting the hospital and the ungodly amount of paperwork that followed. “Yes, Pansy did mention the high levels of bureaucracy at the Ministry in relation to hospital visits.”
Weasley pressed his lips together in a firm line before glancing off to the side. “Alright,” he said. “Let me let ‘Mione know what’s going on and I’ll take you.”
“Wow,” she pressed her lips together. “Well, take some time to yourself. Maybe grab an extra session with your Mind Healer.”
She put her hands on her hips and eyed him speculatively. “Then what is it?”
Draco and Blaise finished their drinks at about the same time, and Blaise asked to be let out of the booth to use the loo. Draco decided to accompany him.
He summons the bottle of lube under his breath, and after a few moments, pushes in another finger. When he starts pressing in and out, he hits the sweet spot inside Draco.
But to Draco’s dismay, such moments of sadness were chased away with the immediate and surprising levities of simple moments. He’d quickly done the softer ink sketch of Christmas morning with big broad strokes; he drew the figures of himself and Teddy in their pyjamas, all smiles and playfulness while his mother and aunt looked on with cheery fondness and warmth. The moment plastered itself into his mind and heart as he catalogued the ease of his mother’s countenance, the cadence of Teddy’s laugh, and the light in Andromeda’s eyes.
want?” Malfoy leaned down, his mouth suddenly inches from Harry’s. “Or would you like to finally find out what it feels like?”
Draco returned her smile. “Yes, thank you.”
“You submit reports littered with factual errors, not to mention the new and fascinating spellings you seem to dream up with each new piece of paperwork.” Malfoy laughed, “It’s almost as if you
Draco sighed. “How does one get hit with four errant spells instantaneously?”
here every night!”
He took a deep breath and warmth permeated from his lungs to his core—the soft spice of sage and cauldron smoke. Draco’s scent.
When he realised how much of a difference the few shorter workdays had made, it struck him that he even
Weasley attempts to cast several Warming Charms. “Nothing’s been working.” He kneels down and grabs Potter’s face. “Harry!”
“Malfoy?”
“So you wanted a pink cake covered in penises?”
Theo burst out laughing. “She really loves his tight arse!”
Potter chokes on his drink. Draco smirks and begins turning the kebabs. He holds up one of them up. “I assure you, I’m used to handling meat much bigger than this.”
“Potter,” he’d muttered. “As if.”
“Before the first book,” Potter explains.
“I’m sorry,” is all Draco can bring himself to say.
“Draco,” Andromeda urged him forward, “Harry’s just fallen off his broom and his leg is a bit of a mess.”
“Anything going on there?” Pansy batted her lashes.
When he walks into the small room, he’s met with the heavy scent of orange and bergamot, and the maddening sight of Harry’s favourite chocolate biscuits left out on a tray by the sink. Draco shakes his head and walks down the long row of cabinets and shelves toward the potions table at the back of the room. He peruses the haphazard row of vials until he finds a Pepper Up, turns on his heel to leave, but stops when something old and familiar on the wall above the table catches his eye.
Blaise smirks over his shoulder. “Come now, you wouldn’t let Harry Potter die on your watch.” He rushes out and leaves Draco hovering over Potter, dumbfounded and, frankly, more than a bit aroused.
“I am not the homeowner. If Harry wants to list me—”
The conversation turned to other things, restaurants and Ministry happenings. Pansy, Theo and the unnamed man entered into a heated discussion over new Auror dress code policies just as Daphne and Greg got up and headed to the dancefloor.
“Alright,
Administrative Days
Furrowing his brow, Harry blinked. “The truth? Malfoy’s related the case in its entirety.”
things, I have no authority to stop you. But it is not my prerogative to police this patient, merely to heal him.”
” Spinnet pointed.
“I don’t know,” he replied, his blue eyes wide. He gulped. “We were supposed to have dinner with him and he never showed. After we ate, we went over…”
confusing for Draco to process in his state of intoxication.
The ribbon slipped from Draco’s fingers as something akin to icy shock surged up his spine.
The slightest rock of his hips puts Potter’s cock against his sweet spot and Draco thinks he’s doing to explode. “Fuck me, fuck, fuck, fuck!”
“Well, it’s out of my hands,” the boy said. “I just wish the Sorting Hat would let me choose!”
should sufficiently keep a patient anaesthetised for hours. He glanced over the chart and baulked at the last surgery listed eleven days prior:
“Perfect.” Draco leans over to Blaise and whispers, “We’re here undressing the Savior, and Weasley’s got his wand ready to set this entire place on fire.”
“Nothing.” Potter shrugs and walks back to the couch. He casts another Warming Charm on his blanket and cozies up beneath it. “Will you read aloud to me?”
“Only you,” Harry repeated, moments from toppling over the edge.
Finnegan pops his head out of the carriage. “Oye! Malfoy! Come on!”
He followed her not half a minute later and regarded the operating room staff bustling around finishing their preparations and readying the patient for surgery. Harry Potter—the patient—lay prone on the operating table, the stasis spell fading over the wounds in his thoracic region. Draco briefly recalled the dozen appearances of
“It is,” Potter levels him with a stare, eyes green and bright in the shadows of the forest. He turns away. “You should see this,” he says, and motions for Draco to follow him.
“That’s an absurd idea,” Draco laughs. “What could you change?”
He pressed the glass between his lips and tilted it back, letting the dark purple liquid spill into his mouth. Draco watched him drink, as if transfixed, while Potter slowly swallowed, removed the glass, and licked his lower lip.
For whatever reason, this particular Tuesday seemed to drag on as Draco went over department requisitions and the next month’s schedule. His mother had asked him to stop at Borgin and Burkes to pick up a set of Malfoy family jewellery boxes she’d had repaired. He’d been putting it off for days. He knew he had no excuse not to go, since he’d be meeting Blaise in Diagon, but the thought of returning to
Draco fixed Harry with a solemn stare and pressed his lips together in a flat line. “You’re the Boy Who Lived, the Head Auror, and the man I’ve been hung up on since before I can remember.” He grabbed Harry’s hands. “And you’re terrible at paperwork.”
“Healer Malfoy,” the intern waved him over to a floating hospital gurney. “They asked for you.”
“I am here to identify what he took so that I can administer a treatment plan that will not have negative interactions with the substance,” Draco explained. He pointed to the bathroom. “If you want to take advantage of this and get rid of some of these
He bit his lip and tried to think of all the things he’d wanted to say to Potter, but at the time, they’d only evolved from
He grabbed the soap and started cleaning his body, his mind jumping to his later encounter with Potter, another instance where someone appeared where they shouldn’t have. Normal people saw Healers at offices or hospitals. Occasionally, healers made housecalls. No one was ever rude enough to presume it could go the other way around!
Draco raised a brow.
Draco has an idea of what he’ll see when he steps through but still isn’t prepared for the shock of seeing Harry Potter staring at the unfinished painting of himself and the slew of sketches and smaller paintings hung on the wall behind it. Harry’s facing away from him, and Draco’s immobilised with an amount of fear he hadn’t known possible.
“Why is it so unbelievable, Potter? That people want to hear the juiciest crime news from the Saviour himself?” Malfoy pursed those perfect lips and Harry had to turn away to collect himself.
“Blaise, Theo, Greg, Daphne,” she listed, “And we’ll probably meet up with a few others.” She smiled maniacally. “It’s Ladies Night at the Tricky Thestral.”
Draco shook his head, blushing. “These are just—I was supposed to be out with Blaise but he had to work.”
He had no idea Harry bought it. Back then, he’d been too embarrassed and insecure to do much of anything and had used a gallery attendant to be the middleman in all his art sales. He suddenly remembers Harry’s interview in the paper after the show. It had seemed like something done in passing, a coincidence that Harry Potter had gone to
“You don’t need to keep this in your head anymore. The fantasy is never as good as the reality.”
“Yes?”
“Hope you’re decent!” Finnigan yells and storms into the enclosure. He eyes them and winks. “Oh come on you two, s’been over an hour. Pack it in. We’re all dressed and ready.”
Draco glared at him. “Don’t worry, Pansy,” he said and turned his head to lock eyes with her. “These scrubs are spelled to repel liquids. But your concern is appreciated.”
She sighed. “Yes.”
“Alright, Potter?”
“You sure know how to handle your meat,” Finnigan chuckles.
Before Harry could blink, Malfoy had cast a
“Sure,” she chuckled. “
“Has it really been eleven years?” Harry asks. He finishes off his glass of wine and stands. Draco is unable to stop himself from cataloguing Harry’s form as he clears their finished plates and returns to the table.
“I question the STAR spell’s accuracy,” Luna replied.
“Well?” Blaise asks.
“Does he need it?”
Malfoy smirked. “Please cancel the rest of my appointments for the day.”
Draco clenched his jaw. “This is my first day.”
Longbottom shrugs. “Oh, alright then. Interested in a game of gobstones?’
after they’d had dinner together.
“That

That was all.
Andromeda huffed. “It was more like fifty.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Exactly
“No,” Potter whispers. He’s staring at Draco’s lips and leaning forward.
Draco sighed, her words mirroring some of his past feelings. “You don’t have to explain yourself to me.”
“We have our own coffee in Spell Damage. So if anything happens to you after you drink it,” she leaned back, “take it up with my station staff.”
The small studio was empty.
The clerk sighed, defeated, offering them the flavour list.
“I suspected.”
Draco’s breath hitches in this throat.
“I want to be a Seeker like you and Harry,” Teddy said and squared his shoulders.
Burke looked around the empty shoppe. “Was there someone here? That’s rather odd.”
“It doesn’t matter.”
Draco rushed into the O.R. prep room and backed himself against the wall. His first patient was bleeding out. His first patient was suffering unknown wounds from an unknown combination of spells and had a hemothorax.
The sight of Potter quickened Draco’s pulse and stirred up something hot and primal within him. There were other men dancing, men who were equally fit and, objectively speaking, fell into the category of what Draco liked—slim, pliable, and not the bloody Boy Who lived. Draco tended to gravitate toward men who were shorter and thinner than he was, men who submit to his desire to take the lead, men who wouldn’t be able to corner him into doing anything he didn’t want to do. He knew he needed control, and he knew Potter was someone who undoubtedly would never submit, at the very least, to someone like Draco.
“It’s just that he’s acted so strangely since the hot springs. He says nothing’s wrong but…”
The freed hair fell down around his shoulders, the length of it covering half his chest. He fixed his part to the centre and nearly gasped when he realised how much he looked like his father. But on closer inspection, his jaw was slimmer and his nose much finer—his mother’s, he reminded himself. For as much of Lucius as there was in Draco, there was just as much Narcissa, if not more.
close—” She held her thumb and index fingers up together, about an inch’s space between them — “to getting Lee to come to bed early.”
From behind him, Malfoy’s breath tickled the skin beneath his right ear. “What’s inappropriate, Head Auror Potter, is
“I understand,” she said.
Draco took a deep breath as they re-entered the front office. “You
You’ve never felt hope like this before.
Potter leans in and kisses him. “I just want to thank you, Draco.” He trails kisses up Draco’s jaw and then down his neck. He wraps his hands around Draco’s hips and falls to his knees. “You did such a good job taking care of me the other day.” Before Draco registers anything else, Potter’s shoving his face forward and nuzzling Draco’s erection through his trousers. “You were so good, let me take care of you.”
You put your hand to the warm patch of skin on your cheek, sure you’ve imagined the entire thing. Potter leaning in, Potter pulling away. Potter telling you he’d see you later as if it was assured. As if it was fated. As if people just go around kissing other people and smiling like loons escaped from the madhouse. Hope blooms where you had thought only grey and bleak things grew.
“Too much?”
The first time Draco saw something new etched onto the features of The Boy Who Lived, it barely even registered. It was the momentous occasion when the man he’d grown up despising offered him a kind and level stare and seemingly forgave Draco his faults and his wrongs and proceeded to challenge anyone who dared do otherwise.
After he casts extra warming charms on his boots and gloves, Draco begins to admire his surroundings. The forest vibrates with magic, from the critters scurrying at their feet to the languid enchanted frostvines that wrap around the trunks of trees to warm them. Draco’s never been surrounded by so many new and different magical species in one place. He’s mesmerised but also disappointed that he only just took the time to experience it on their last day.
After that, Draco saw Harry Potter a few times in passing, but could barely look him in the eyes. Draco had reached a point where he knew exactly what he would see behind those token spectacles, yet he wasn’t quite certain what could be gleaned from his own metallic stare. And his feelings, every day a bit more complicated, could not be revealed to anyone, let alone Harry Potter.
Weasley frowned. “I thought you worked at Mungo’s?” He shook his head and grabbed his chin. “Harry said something about you being Healer-in-Charge?”
Draco stares after him feeling as if he’s just been hit with a Stupify. He’s not sure how much time passes before Blaise grabs his arm and nudges him into his bedroom.
They shared a few heavy, panting breaths between them. With his eyes glued to Malfoy’s smirk, Harry said farewell to all rational thought and finally broke the silence.
“Draco, come out with us!”
until Draco thinks back to earlier, to the flowers on his desk. He whirls around and faces Harry.
Suddenly he knew he wasn’t crazy. Something else had been going on, if only he hadn’t been distracted by Potter’s eyes—the shock of seeing them.
dance,” he pouts. Blaise glances at Potter and then back to Draco. “Please?”
as the light managed to draw attention to it no matter where one sat in the room. But even more so, Draco was pleasantly surprised by the small gold plaques that adorned the center of the frames on both his works.
Patil pressed her lips together. “He heals obnoxiously fast.”
Draco protests and cites his visit to the hot springs. “And,” he adds, “unless I’m going to walk out there and suddenly stumble on temple ruins and a corner shop with spanakopita—”
Draco couldn’t help himself; he allowed his eyes to lock on Lucius and observe his face. There was a questioning look etched across his father’s features, so familiar and yet so different than what he remembered. When Draco thought of his father, he didn’t picture the haggard and exhausted man left with next to nothing at the end of the War. He remembered the handsome and confident gentlewizard who stood tall, exuding a sly superiority of wit and countenance. But the man before him was somewhat jagged, the high lines of his cheekbones more pronounced, with the marks of age lining the hollows of his face. Just as unfamiliar was the look of sheer concern spread across his features.
He started back toward the Trauma Station to see if he could offload some of his cases, but someone grabbed his arm and hauled him back around.
Vacations alone were out of his comfort zone, Harry supposed. His friends were all busy with their own lives and he didn’t really have anyone else. It wasn't as if he was dating anyone.
After Potter’s admission at the springs that he’d enjoyed their previous conversation, Draco hopes their discussion will improve his mood—for the sake of the cookies.
He was standing at the bar drinking an obnoxiously fruity alcoholic beverage, eyeing the shimmer and shine of the wizarding world elite, waiting expectantly to see who might bid on one of his paintings. It had taken some years, but his work had gathered a following and gained acclaim from several rather ancient and haughty art critics. While Draco knew himself well enough to know what motivated him to paint, and although his truth was all he really needed, he constantly struggled with the reality of how nice it felt to receive such glowing approval from those whose mere words could elevate or destroy him. That kind of transaction, the sort of coveted notoriety that dictated people’s careers — and in some cases, their very lives — left a bitter taste in his mouth. It all reminded him a little too much of certain things from his past.
“During your first Post-Op check, I did notice how remarkably well your injuries were progressing,” Draco said. “And your vitals were very strong, better than expected.” He turned back to Potter and smiled. “If, say, over the course of the next few days, things continue improving, I may readjust my recommendation in your discharge papers.”
Draco sobbed as he came, and after a few moments, the water washed away the evidence of his fantasy. He wished he could erase the tacit decision that he was going to help Potter in any way that he could, starting with helping keep the demons away. He pushed aside the obvious realisation that—as both a Healer and Draco bloody Malfoy—sent him reeling...he unequivocally wanted to fuck Potter senseless.
book,
Finally, it hits Draco. He glances down, unable to stop his gasp when he sees Potter’s erection tenting in his trousers. His memory flashes to Potter earlier that day, naked in the water—then three days before to the sight of him sprawled out on the sofa. Draco pictures his perfect cock and shudders.
“But the fantasy lasts forever.” Draco closes his eyes.
Draco almost choked on his coffee.
, the fact that it had only been eleven days since Potter’s left arm reattachment surgery, and the startling statement Patil had made during their first Post-Op check-in:
Draco nodded and grabbed onto his sleeve.
“You can start by untying me,” Harry said, schooling his features into something as neutral as possible as Malfoy stepped even closer to him.
“I don’t need your gratitude.”
in the E.A.R. log and turned to the O.R. staff.
“A sigil from the Dark Lord would be constant,” Pansy explained. “You’d feel it all the time.”
“How many times do I have to tell you...” Harry started to say.
“You’ve been here?” she asked, astonished. “Why didn’t you say so?”
“That bad, huh?” Potter said. He glanced at Andromeda and Teddy. “Go ahead, I’ll be fine.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “How high up were you when you fell?” He dropped his bag and knelt beside him, unrolling the jacket that had been placed over Potter’s lower right leg. His blue jeans had been cut open revealing a swollen, rapidly bruising shin with a slight bulge on the inner upper calf.
Draco splashes water at him, afraid he’ll look down and see his arousal. “What in Merlin’s name are you playing at?”
“Here we go,” Blaise rolled his eyes.
“Oh,” Pansy batted at his arm. “It’s not just for women and straights. It’s a midweek singles night.” She nudged him. “When’s the last time you had sex?”
“Hmm?” Harry found himself raising his hand and carding his fingers through Malfoy’s soft, blond strands, pressing Malfoy down so those lovely lips would meet his skin at last. “All the nooks and crannies?”
he’d said at Patil’s objection when she eyed the price.
“Blaise is busy right now,” Ginevra frowns. Draco realises she’s completely naked and blushes. She points to both of them on the bed. “But we—all of us in this cabin—would appreciate it if you could cast a Silencing Charm as soon as I leave the room.” She shakes her head and turns around. “I swear to—” she slams the door.
“What?” Draco snapped. “How on earth would that—” But he stopped when he realised her words had struck a nerve, prodding at memories he didn’t dare touch with a twenty-foot dragon prod.
Draco shakes his head in confusion. “You aren’t rooming with Ginevra?”
“Can I help it if the desires of my heart find unfiltered delivery by my sharp, talented tongue?”
“This is ridiculous,” Patil said, her hands deep in the thoracic cavity. “Even for
“Bollocks,” he muttered before heaving himself up and padding over to the window. He peeled back the curtain slowly to reveal his Aunt Andromeda’s screech owl, Pyxis, clutching a parchment in its beak. Draco shielded his eyes as best he could as he unlatched the window and let the frantic bird inside.
Draco stayed busy completing paperwork and charts, taking trips to the cantina for various snacks and coffees, and completely missed Potter’s second check-in. He rushed to his hospital room but stopped just outside the door when he heard a slightly raised voice echo into the hallway.
“Depressing?” Harry smiled slightly and glanced in Draco’s direction. “It’s a commentary,” he said, “on the fall of Pureblood idealism.” He playfully elbowed Longbottom in the ribs. “It’s perfect for Grimmauld Place.”
feel like?”
“I...can’t.”
“Unnf,” Potter groans.
Draco frowns. “You can have it. I’m not so sure I’ll be getting in.”
Potter stopped and stared at the open bottle of wine and the takeaway, leaning over to inspect the open food container. “By yourself tonight?”
“I’m sorry,” Potter closed his eyes and wiped his hands over his face. “I’m just in a lot of pain.” He sighed and opened his eyes, focusing them on Draco. “That isn’t an excuse.”
It was almost —
“Fine,” Draco squeezes his cock. “Fine! Just give me twenty minutes.”
“Assessment?” Draco said then cast the strongest medical stasis charm he knew under his breath.
It takes about a half an hour for them to climb the lower hillside to the springs at the base of one of the mountains.
“You’re not going to take those?”
In an attempt to remain professional and retain all decorum, Draco smiled. “Articulate as ever, Mr Potter,” he said. “I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’m the newly appointed Healer-in-Charge of the Trauma Ward.” He walked up to the intern and grabbed the chart out of her hands. He flipped through the familiar pages casually. “And judging by your patient history, it seems safe to assume we’ll be seeing a lot of each other in the future.”
The cork slides up with a pop and Harry raises a brow. “I know, but this way is more satisfying.” He walks the bottle over to the table where Draco had failed to notice two place settings laid out. “And how many times do I have to say...it’s
On a Thursday in mid-October, Patil assisted on one of the nastier surgeries. They decided to go out for dinner afterwards to an Italian restaurant near the Ministry. “This place is amazing,” Patil said while they waited for a table at the bar. “The mushroom risotto…”
“Malfoy,” Weasley called out after a long period of silence between them. “Over here.”
Draco forced himself to meet into his father’s grey eyes but couldn’t hold the stare for longer than a few torturous moments. That was all it took for his blood to boil and his gut to twist into knots of anger, anxiety, and admittedly, betrayal. Draco kept his focus on the white linen tablecloth and carefully set his wine glass down. He took a breath, grabbed his napkin and wiped his mouth, before slowly reaching for his cheque book beneath his robes.
“Fuck,” Harry cursed, teetering on the edge of his orgasm. Malfoy sped up the motion of his hand and began whispering filthy things in Harry’s ear.
“It could be,” Draco tries to stay on point. “You could have Alterniton’s Syndrome or a charm sickness, no one knows what that lake water could have done to you.”
“Is it, um, a frequent thing, then? You and Potter getting packages this large?”
“What?”
She pressed on with the conversation despite his silence. “You know, we all have issues with our parents.”
By the time Draco comes back to the moment, Harry’s pulling out of him and gently flipping them over. He leans down and gives Draco a tender kiss, one hand caressing Draco’s shoulder and the other furiously stroking his own cock.
It had all been very serious and overwhelming, Harry standing there facing the Wizengamot, standing up for Draco. It was the first time Draco had experienced the simultaneous feelings of indignity
“You did so well,” Malfoy said.
staring at them, so it didn’t matter either way. Malfoy sighed. “I cannot accept these at this time.”
Draco is simultaneously comforted and terrified by the ease at which Blaise suggests he sleep with Potter. It must show on his face because Blaise grips his shoulders and flashes him a stern look.
“...wouldn’t you say, Harry?”
Draco shudders at the words and thinks he might die. Praise from the lips of Harry Potter? He shakes his head and gulps as disappointment hits him and he realizes what’s really happening.
His feelings settled on the inconvenient some years after his first showing.
The clerk interrupted, “I recommend the saffron and cardamom sponge with rose Swiss meringue buttercream and toasted pistachio pieces, sir.”
“Of seduction.”
“You’re so good like this,” he says. “You look perfect riding my cock.”
then kisses Draco’s shoulder. “I’ve wanted you for ages, Draco. Before I even knew what it meant to want. But finally being with you—” he shakes his head and closes his eyes. “I never could have imagined it would be like this.”
After an intense two minutes, Draco nodded.  “That sounds lovely, thank you.”
Draco scoffed. “I wasn’t
When Patil saw him the next morning, she clapped him on the back and told him he looked exactly how she thought he would. “Did you even sleep last night?” she asked, her tone carrying a mild edge of concern.
One weekday afternoon after Draco has had lunch, he stretches his legs and heads into the study. For whatever reason, the single chandelier fails at illuminating the space, casting dark shadows and dim light across the dark wood shelves and intricate green carpet. Draco spends a few minutes taking in the room and thinking about what Harry had said.
He practically flew through her sitting room and into the kitchen where the backdoor led to the garden. He passed the abandoned outdoor dining table, set up with a spread of food and drinks, and headed toward the large field behind the flower garden.
The caller scoffed. “Yeh think they’d stop attackin’ us long enough for me to question ‘em?”
Where other wizards possessed varying levels of magical components, usually higher in one particular subset or elemental energy, Potter’s levels were astronomical across the board. And what was even more astonishing, they were high but showed signs of depletion, meaning the numbers were bound to rise as his rest replenished and revived him.
“This is incredible,” Thomas whispers as he kneels down beside them. Draco’s unable to tear his eyes away as he silently nods in agreement.
He sighed and closed his eyes. He had spent almost ten years training for this day. He’d been methodical in his work, had sacrificed so much, had grown an easy, addictive confidence that grounded him. And yet, the moment was here and it didn’t quite feel real.
Draco snorted. “Me either.”
“To who?” Draco raises a brow.
Theo stuck out his lip and crinkled his nose. “Seems like it.”
Draco approached the Pensieve in the far corner of the library where it sat on a marble-topped credenza, unused for over eleven years. What memories had it once contained, he idly wondered. What horrors?
injured in the field.”
“Get him to
As it turned out the Tricky Thestral was a full-scale nightclub. Draco hadn’t been prepared for the sensory overstimulation of loud music, flashing lights, and clouds of various perfumes and colognes mixed with sweat. He observed the crowds on the large dancefloor, eyeing a few people he thought he recognised.
On his way out, to his utter horror, he ran straight into Ronald Weasley.
Patil snorted. “So that’s why they brought you here, then.”
Draco’s theory hadn’t been that Potter’s magic was hurting him, though. He’d suspected that Potter’s magic was so powerful, it helped him stay awake, helped him heal faster, and was the crutch he was using to cope with whatever demons he was fighting. As Draco’s eyes scanned the measurements and analyses on the parchments, he quickly realised that his theory was correct, and more than that, he found that Potter’s magic was unconventionally powerful.
Draco tilted his head and walked straight back to his office. He gathered his things and went home without another thought. When he stepped out of the Floo, the only thing on his mind was a hot shower and the wish that he might find the strength not to wank himself raw thinking about things he shouldn’t even have knowledge of—things like desperate green eyes, powerful magic, and plush blue comforters on mahogany beds.
“You Apparated home?”
Potter swims away from Draco and lifts himself out of the pool. Draco tries to avert his eyes but can’t seem to tear them away from Potter’s arse until he casts a drying charm and bends over to pick up his pants. Draco looks away, blushing, and gets out of the hot springs. They remain silent as they dress and Draco makes sure to take as long as humanly possible so he can be alone to cast the Disillusionment Charm on his trousers.
“This afternoon, I am joined by my humble partner, Harry Potter.”
His temperature was slightly elevated, but not quite feverish. He showed signs of heavy perspiration in his greasy hair and the pile of his soiled clothes on the side table, but almost felt cold to the touch when Draco put his hand to Potter’s forehead. He took a quick study of his breathing and felt confident his lungs and heart were healthy.
“Since the trial,” Draco nodded.
“What?” Draco eyed him.
Draco throws up a hand, halting the movement of hips to stop himself from coming right then. He wants Potter’s hands on him when he comes. He wants to be consumed in the fire. He's burning alive from it and he doesn't even care. Reaching out for Potter, Draco kisses his outstretched hand before sucking the fingers into his mouth.
“Issues?” Draco eyed her. “Was your father in service of the Dark Lord?” He paused. “No? Didn’t think so.”
Draco glared at him and pulled out his wand. “It’s a broken leg. We get to see how badly damaged everything is—” Draco raised it, “Do I have your permission to perform an assessment charm?”
“It’s addressed to him.”
powerful in there. Let me bring Alicia in on this.”
“You’re...happy?”
“ —is my name.”
“You two look like you’ve got it covered,” he says and raises his wand to the fireplace. “I’ll get the fire nice and hot with some Kindling Charms.”
Endure, Draco thinks.
Blaise’s eyes went wide and he cast his gaze down to the table. The cafe’s atmosphere was picking up as morning commuters rushed in and out with their to-go coffees and teas while others settled in and claimed the remaining cafe tables. The increase in background noise seemed to quell the rise in tension between the three of them.
“That was—” he started to say as he opened his eyes.
Malfoy shook his head. “Absolutely not.”
As it was a Friday and they were understaffed, Draco picked up a double-rotation and barely had time to eat until well after eight in the evening. It seemed the closer it got to Halloween, the gorier some of the injuries became. He’d reattached a foot and pulled out an entire set of antique silverware from a man’s back before noon. The cases only became more ridiculous as the day went on. So when the Healer-in-Charge of Orthopedics asked him to assist on a hip repair and regrowth, he jumped at the chance to get away from the madness.
Sighing, Draco stands up and takes Blaise’s outstretched hand. “Fine. One song.”
He bit his lip and dropped his gaze to the floor. He didn’t have the energy left to try and hide it from her. “I wanted to make my version of Dreamless Sleep.” He sighed, “For Harry Potter.”
Most of the hospital staff, his mentors, and his patients would have heralded Draco as the next prodigy; but with every single success came the inevitable criticism and confabulating, the whispers of his weekly parole meetings and glances cast down to the long-sleeves of his robes. The mistakes of his childhood always seemed to shadow him when the spotlight was brightest on his achievements, when Draco might believe that he could be totally and utterly redeemed; it became apparent that would never be the case. No matter how much work he put in, the past could not be erased.
“Bit paranoid, that,” Blaise rolled his eyes. He bit his lip and a thoughtful look came over him. “And you’re sure regular Dreamless won’t help?”
“I can’t be sure,” Draco said. The mention of the Dark Lord caught him off guard. “Is there a way to tell the difference?”
“You…” He’d started to say. But he didn’t know precisely how to articulate half the things he’d wanted to. Sometime later, after reflecting on it, he supposed Spinnet had been as polite and respectful of him as she could muster. But in the moment, he’d felt entirely too judged for past circumstances that he’d really had no control over. So all he could bring himself to say as she left was, “Thank you.”
The sheets straightened out and rolled up to the headboard, the plush dark blue comforter not far behind, before tucking themselves under the sides of the mattress and giving off a
Blaise snorted. “Yeah, how sweet. Now open the bloody box, I want to know what’s in there.”
Draco sighs. He and Lovegood had voted for Greece, but the Gryffindors and Blaise had overruled them. Leave it to those fools to forego any sort of research about their destination. Draco’s sure from the expression on Weasley’s face he only looked at the pictures.
, perhaps only time can establish a sort of truce with the gnomes, especially if they’ve suffered a degnoming often enough. I’m sure they don’t exactly view wizard kind in a positive light.”
Andromeda became a devoted focus for Narcissa, and in turn, so did Edward Lupin. Luncheons and dinners evolved into holidays and vacations spent in each other’s company. For someone like Draco who had spent half his life in the solitary confines of his own rigid familial structure, the burgeoning new paradigm left him ill at ease and full of doubts. How could forgiveness come so easily? How could pain be replaced with hope? How could he ever look either his aunt or his cousin in the eye without feeling the excruciating remorse of having failed them?
Andromeda stood up and clapped her hands. Both Potter’s and Draco’s heads snapped to look at her.
She shook her head and grinned, turned on her heel and walked away. “See you tomorrow,” she called back before Apparating.
Draco rolls his eyes and walks into the cabin, happy that Blaise can manage to bed not one, but two Gryffindors in a matter of days. He’d be satisfied with the one, really. If only such things were possible.
at him, sending him flying backward as invisible soft ropes wrapped around his body. Harry fell to his knees and struggled against the bindings that wove themselves around his chest, wrists, thighs, and ankles.
Draco opens his mouth before he really thinks about what he’s saying. “I could think of a few things that would warm you up.” His eyes almost bulge out of their sockets when he realises how sultry his words sounded. “I mean—”
Draco gazed at his features in the mirror and smiled.
Draco cut in, “I assure you, Lovegood, after
It didn’t come easy, despite his natural inclination to the vocation. For others, Draco supposed, the learning process made exceptions for the occasional error or failed exam. But for Draco, a set of unspoken terms seemed to dictate his path from the start: no missteps, no questionable actions, no mistakes. There was never a conversation or a moment where anyone uttered such things, but every classroom, every lab, every single day of his post-war life, the sentiment was clear. During lectures, he was asked the most difficult questions as instructors cleverly tried to embarrass or demean him. So Draco studied and read his textbooks cover to cover. He ordered other texts, some beyond his level, and never walked into a lecture hall without full knowledge of the forthcoming discussion. Draco found himself working through the most complex scenarios in lab exercises despite his peers being given simpler, straightforward procedures. So he volunteered at the labs, he practised, he spent every waking moment honing his dexterous skills and perfecting technique above all else. And when it was time for research project assignments, Draco proposed topics that even residents would find operose just to prove the point.
“You’re having nightmares again?” Blaise furrowed his brows and grabbed Draco’s shoulder. “What about your stash of the special Dreamless?”
Draco stumbled back and fell down from the weight of it all. The interns helped him up and fussed over him until he regained his composure and batted them away.
without permission, and you throw your hand over your mouth in panic. The words were easy, thoughtless, but nothing with him has ever been easy or thoughtless. The complexities of your feelings take root in the past and the future, in the images of who he is and was and who you’ve always been. You think his stoic response might have ended your life but you’re still breathing.
you put into keeping those corded muscles hard and strong. How sweaty and flushed you must get—”
“It does!”
“What do you reckon, Draco?” Blaise leaned over and laughed in his ear. “A
Weasley cleared his throat. “Check the bathroom. Maybe the bedside table.” He pointed at what remained of the nightstand. “Or what’s left of it.”
“What’s in the box?”
Harry paled. “That’s one of the words you are absolutely not allowed to say, Malfoy.”
Draco scowls. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Draco laughed, “No, Potter, it’s a—you know what, just try it. Take it slow this time.” He handed the glass back to him. Their fingers brushed in the exchange and the contact sent a tingle up Draco’s arm. He had been warmed through from drinking before Potter even arrived, but one touch from the man had turned the blood in his veins to fire.
. “You can believe that I looked in
“Your lips are stained wine red and I want them all over me,” Potter whispers.
“Why would I room with her?”
Narcissa paused and cleared her throat. “He married to that Granger witch.”
“Restart,” Draco corrected.
He accepted the position, negotiated his contract, and moved out of his flat in Paris in less than five days. There was to be no official interview and no vetting process. Draco’s presence was desired as soon as possible.
in a long time.
Blinking, Weasley took a deep, shaky breath and nodded his head. “Yeah, Malfoy, I am.” He turned his blue eyes to Draco. “And that’s the point.” He waved his hands in the air. “I’m alright! Hermione’s alright! Everybody else seems to manage, even you.” He took a breath and ran a shaky hand through his hair. “So why is it always Harry that has to fight the demons? Why is it like this?”
So he’d made the non-refundable reservation for a small cottage near the shore before he could change his mind. His bags were packed and his Portkey to the village had been sent down from the Department of Magical Transportation.
Draco wondered what knowledge Potter’s friends had of the substances he took. “Well, I need to find out exactly what they are. Would you—” Draco wanted to ask Weasley to go back to Potter’s and collect whatever he could find, but Draco realised he might not know what to look for. Without thinking he asked, “Would you take me there?”
“This is so barbaric,” Draco sighs as he watches his knight set Thomas’ bishop aflame.
“Malfoy, are you crazy?” Harry gritted. “Are you trying to get a rise out of me?”
“But this is your home, too. For heaven’s sake, it’s been nearly six years. You still haven’t been put on the register?”
Draco stands and walks over to him, unable to tear his eyes away from the stupidly content and peaceful expression on Potter’s face. Careful not to disturb him, he picks up the blanket and tucks it around his shoulders. A hand darts out and grabs his arm.
“Hey,” Blaise said over his shoulder as he opened the other box. “This one is a birthday cake.”
Draco snorts and absently wonders how much space he takes up in the parts Potter doesn’t like. “Do you find yourself discussing ‘the fall of Pureblood idealism’ often in your sitting room?”
.” His father now stood on the other side of the nearby table with hands clutching the back of the empty chair.
A moment later, Blaise and Weasley stagger forward, a large bundle with wild, raven hair in their arms.
He’s been back in his own studio for two days and the absence of green eyes and Earl Grey first thing in the morning has left Draco feeling listless and empty. He’s somehow become conditioned to seeing Harry’s smile, and hearing his voice, and feeling as if he could possibly have belonged somewhere in the other man’s routine. He thought he might receive a note from Harry in response to the project’s completion, but to his unadmitted disappointment, there has been none.
He wants to be excited for Teddy, and perhaps on some level he is, but he’s also deeply scared for him. Draco thinks of himself when he was eleven, of his deepest thoughts and desires and how so much of the world and the war robbed him of normal things. He aches for Teddy when he thinks of their cobbled together family, of a boy who doesn’t have a father or a mother to steady or reassure him. But then Draco thinks of himself, his mother, and his aunt, and how they’ve loved Teddy and given him everything they possibly could. He tries not to think too much about Harry, and how he’s managed to insert himself into their makeshift family unit with his devotion to Teddy, his respect for their heritage, and his quiet appreciation of Draco’s art.
He nodded and grabbed his tea, downing the rest of it in an attempt to chase her words away before he let them resonate on a deeper level than the trials and tribulations of the Manor’s squirrel population.
Potter shook his head, his eyes dark and desperate. “I thought you understood.”
Draco crossed his arms and frowned. “Yes, well I very well can’t brew that now can I? What with the key ingredient being illegal. I wouldn’t dare attempt it here where there are likely eyes watching my every move.”
And lest he forgets, Draco is always sure to see Harry Potter at the Battle of Hogwarts Remembrance Day Feast. It’s his yearly reminder that being on the wrong side of the war is akin to being painted into a pristine, magical canvas, forever forced to remain the same in the eyes of those outside the landscape and frame.
“Blaise.” Draco crossed his arms and frowned.
They stand in silence for minutes, hours,
“Surely not?” Draco whispers as he places the food under Stasis Charms.
“I’ll make sure she gets these right away,” Draco promised and shrunk the stack to a manageable size to fit it in his pocket. He smiled and nodded, “Well, then, if that’s all? I’ll go say goodbye to Teddy.”
“Yeah, and don’t give me that look, you know I’m right.” Blaise frowns. “You know the moment you sleep with him, you’ll have given up your last bit of control.” He turns around and heads for the door. “But that’s the thing, Draco,” he glances back, his face solemn and thoughtful. “There’s nothing in your wildest dreams that will ever feel as good as giving up control to someone else. When your heart is in their hands, they can touch you in a way you’ve never felt before.”
“Patil?”
He locked his bedroom door and warded it so strongly that Narcissa couldn’t get in even if she burned the Manor to the ground. He slowly stripped out of his clothes and walked into his bathroom, opening the wall cabinet and looking for a Hangover Elixir. He pushed a few bottles aside and when his fingers brushed over an anti-inflammatory potion, he briefly thought about picking it up and taking it to Potter. The thought left him almost as soon as it had arrived, and Draco continued browsing his stores until he found what he was looking for.
,” Malfoy whispered, and then suddenly his hands were cupping Harry’s arse, squeezing and kneading the muscle there. Harry let out an involuntary moan and leaned back. “You take care to maintain your body,” Malfoy continued. Harry opened his eyes and watched as Malfoy stepped back and began a slow circle around him. “You’re a middle-aged man promoted to a thankless desk job and yet you have the body of someone much younger and more active.” Malfoy smirked. “One can only assume the
“Surely not
Draco tore his eyes from the outside greenery. “
“Alone?”
Blaise rolled his eyes. “You’re being dramatic. Besides, they’ll be so thankful for the goods they wouldn’t care if it was the Dark Lord himself dropping off the parcels.”
“I’m going to wrap my lips around that thick cock and tease you until you’re on the edge,” Malfoy said. “I’m going to lick my way inside you and have you pliant under me, just begging for me to fuck you senseless.” Malfoy pulled back and looked Harry in the eyes. “I’m going to fuck you so long and so hard that you won’t even know your own name,” he said. “Only mine.”
“It’s your vacation too, Malfoy,” Thomas offers. “Let us help.”
family and power and goodness didn’t always start with
He slowed his pace as he realised Teddy was fine and the figure on the ground was an adult male. As he reached them, the man’s face became visible and Draco stopped.
The switchboard operator gave them a thumbs up, so Harry started, “Hello and thank you for calling in this afternoon. What’s your name?”
Draco gawked at him. “This is
He followed her cue and Apparated to the Manor’s foyer, kicking off his shoes and heading straight for the kitchen and the corkscrew.
“That’s the spirit!” Blaise exclaimed.
“You are terrorising those cookies.”
Draco sat, back rigid against the plush armchair, facing the window of his rented room. The bright sunshine almost stung his eyes as he lowered the parchment, trying his hardest to stare anywhere except back down at the words in his hands.
“Theo,” Blaise said in a warning tone, sliding into the empty space next to him in the booth.
“It’s happening.”
Malfoy stopped circling, leaned down, and firmly grabbed Harry’s chin. “If you put even a fifth of the effort into your reports as you did your body, Potter…”
He kept a quick pace down the deserted walk, still unpacking his rather unexpected encounter with Weasley. Draco had anticipated malign looks at the very least, and stinging curses and wands out at the worst. He hadn’t considered Weasley would’ve used the last decade to mature in some of the same ways Draco had. There’d been no insults between them, no punches or curses thrown. In fact, Draco stopped mid-step when he realised Weasley had actually thanked him—for delivering the pallet and for taking care of Potter.
“Well how about bubblegum?” Bellatrix suggested knowing that if Kieran were right with his abuse assumption that Harry would need some help both physically and emotionally; and Kieran was usually spot on when it came to his gut assumptions on patients.
Harry glared at Bellatrix in fear she’d mention putting him in a gown and them seeing everything. “Only if I can keep my clothes on.”
Reg, had to move Harry to the fifth floor due to Headmaster prying. See you soon. She transfigured the parchment into an airplane, and watched it fly out of the room.
Regulus had just finished explaining the two native dragons to the Untied Kingdom the Common Welch Green and the Hebridean Black when he decided to try his luck with Harry.
“Why don’t we go somewhere a little more quiet to speak.” Kieran suggested turning his attention to the sad half giant. “Hagrid, I just wanted to thank you for bringing him to us. You did the right thing for Harry.” He patted the Groundskeeper on the shoulder. He ignored the hateful look Dumbledore was sending him.
“We magical creatures don’t take much stock into sexuality like muggles do. I promise you I’m not going to judge you for whoever is written on your wrist. My job as a Healer is to heal you, I’m not going to share your health information with anyone you don’t give me permission to give it to. The exception is if I feel you need a consult from another specialized Healer; or feel that you are a danger to yourself or someone else. You have my word that everything you say in this room to either Bellatrix or myself that it remains between the three of us; that includes the name on your wrist.” Kieran said gently to the child moving closer to try and lift the left sleeve of the baggie jumper.
Harry cried at the idea of his liver failing. “I had no idea! I’ve never seen a doctor before you. I just read what the label said.
Narcissa giggled softly to herself at the thought of that relationship. “You can’t help who you fall in love with.” Merlin knows she wished she could. “Let me know how the date goes.” She said hugging him and kissing his forehead. “I love you Draco.”
“Glad you are in less pain.” Kieran said gently lifting the jumper sleeve again and seeing the deep purple bruises along the wrist. “Alright kiddo what I’m going to do is run my wand over your wrist and it will tell me where it was broken and then I’ll fix it with magic.” He grabbed his wand from the wand pocket on his scrub pants and showed Harry the wand.
Also if you see a spelling or grammatical error I'm sorry I posted this chapter super early and I was getting to head off to sleep so I probably missed some things.
“Dudley and his friends like to punch me. I’m small so I fall a lot. Yes, it was caused by abuse.” Harry said flatly hoping they didn’t ask to elaborate further about all the brain damage.
Kieran raised an eyebrow at his wife’s mention of moving the child into a different room.
He gently pulled back Harry’s gown to examine the back and limbs and let out of a loud gasp upon seeing a nasty burn that hadn’t healed. “What happened here?” He asked gently examining the burn and he was certain it looked like the end of a fireplace poker to adjust logs.
“Harry, would you like bubblegum flavoring again or shall I surprise you with another flavor?”
Bellatrix looked up from the bed and saw Kieran in the doorway. She quickly jumped off the bed and returned to her human form. “Most of the Medi staff on the fifth floor don’t know about my cat form; so, I’ve been watching how the interact with their patients and keeping an eye on sleeping Harry. “You’d be happy to know he’s been asleep since I started watching him. Did you find a Neuro Healer?”
Harry’s shoulders relaxed remembering Kieran’s face from earlier. “So earlier wasn’t a dream?”
“Aneurysm’s rarely rupture without cause.” Adrien muttered pulling out a shimmering memory of Harry’s and placing it into a phial. “Regulus this the last memory he had before going unconscious. If you wouldn’t mind watching it and letting Kieran and I know what it contained. Kieran get Harry ready for surgery for me and do change into a pair of scrubs.
Harry sighed knowing there was several other issues lingering so he knew that he’d be getting sedated later to get everything fixed. He knew there were burns on his back from the fireplace poker and various bruises that were multicolor. “My wrist is pretty bad huh?” He knew his right wrist had been broken multiple times too.
“I have a 10-year-old boy with a Brain Aneurysm on top of multiple prior MTBI’s. I need help with the Brain Aneurysm.” Kieran said trying to be quick in his explanation. He figured Adrien didn’t need to know or didn’t care about all the other injuries most Neuro Healers only cared about the brain and brain only.
Bellatrix smirked at her husband of course Regulus would bring the boy a dragon. It wasn’t like the name on his wrist was the Latin word for dragon or anything. “Harry.” Bellatrix began waiting for Harry to turn his attention to her. “Kieran and I are going to step out for a moment and give you and Regulus a few moments to talk alone.”
“Let’s announce it to the world, and a certain Healer who took care of me after Yaxley did a bloody number to my insides, and before you ask Ron, yes she is really pretty.” He lied well Draco was very handsome, but he was not telling them that he was getting drinks with a Slytherin prat.
Regulus handed Harry the dragon plush. “This is for you.” He said sitting down on the edge of the bed noticing the child’s green eyes widen with excitement at someone giving him something. He watched Harry hug the dragon tightly which prompted little red smoke rings to emerge from the mouth.
Bellatrix sighed of course he’d be upset that he was kept waiting. It wasn’t like Kieran or herself was busy with trying to make sure Harry was pain free while they had the conversation with Dumbledore. She’d be fine with staying with Harry and keeping him occupied with stories of magic and everything that she’d do for her own children.
Kieran was usually a peaceful man but seeing the pages and pages of parchment documenting abuse, malnutrition, and possible starvation made him want to visit Surry and physically ripe the throats out of the muggles that did this. An Avada Kedavra was far too kind for the muggles. He ran a hand through his dark hair and grabbed a blank piece of parchment to write up a plan to heal Harry.
Grant sighed wishing he could leave Dumbledore out in the waiting room for a while. “You know he will probably try to request you or Kieran.”
Harry finished his hot fudge sundae in record timing really, he could have sat a new record for fastest hot fudge sundae ever eaten. “Dinner was great.” He said honestly dinner probably could have tasted horrible and to him it would have still tasted amazing.
“Would someone like to explain how a toy I know I personally gave one of the children staying overnight made it into this trash can?” He asked gabbing his wand in the direction of the trash can. He grabbed the plush toy and cleaned it gently with a spell. “No, looks like I’m adding that to my report as well.” He grabbed the stuffed dragon and his report and made his way back to room 505.
“Of course.”
Draco ran his fingers gently over Potter’s wrist. “Your wrist is fractured, I can feel a minor fracture along your ulna.” He said sliding his fingers gently over Harry’s wrist. “So how do you feel about Skele-Gro?”
“Kitchen dear.” Petunia didn’t even bother looking up from the television program she was watching.
Bellatrix looked at her sister. “Harry’s letter was addressed to the Cupboard Under the Stairs and Surry. When Kieran and I asked about his home life and if we could do the full health scan, he mentioned Mrs. Gray calling social services and what a fat lot of good that did. I assume they tried and either the investigation didn’t go far, or someone from our world meddled.” She remarked sadly.
He went to the nurse’s station and found Harry’s Mediwitch for the night Dolores Umbridge who was dressed in what he could only describe as atrociously pink scrubs with the traditional lapel watch hanging from her left side. Pink was not a designated St. Mungo’s color. Healers wore Hunter or Surgical Green and Mediwitches and Wizards wore navy.  He and Bellatrix both preferred a watch on their left wrist instead of the awful lapel watch. Her St. Mungo’s badge was attached to her left side. She looked around 50 and was easily a few inches shorter than his own wife, she couldn’t have been taller than 4 feet 9 inches. In many ways she reminded him of a pink toad; he just hoped for Harry’s sake that she was a fantastic mediwitch.
“Wait dragons are actually real?” Harry explained hanging onto ever word the Healer was saying about Opaleye’s.
Harry bleakly opened his eyes to find that he was missing the blanket, the room lights were ridiculously bright and the nurse in pink scrubs was holding Lily the Dragon. “What?” He asked his voice muffled from the pillow.
Merlin, did Harry wish those thoughts would go away. There was no possible way Malfoy was gay, or even if he was would he possibly want to go on a date with him. He sighed and was again reminded that being the dreaded Savior did come at a price, his happiness. He just wanted to have a relationship like Neville did with Hermione, or like Ron had with Padma. He was sick of one night stands with muggles.
“Here at St. Mungo’s, you are a guest and have no title. Also, according to the most recent info in the Daily Prophet you are no longer Chief Warlock. I believe that title went to Lucius Malfoy.” Kieran said watching one of the security guards fighting with Dumbledore.
Kieran gently cradled Harry’s wrist in his hand and saw two dragons and Draco Lucius Malfoy on his wrist. “Bella he’s family.”
He remembered how depressed Severus was when he learned of James and Lily’s death and Dumbledore’s news that they couldn’t adopt Harry because the old wizard thought that whoever had murdered James, Lily, and Sirius might be after baby Harry and that they couldn’t find Sirius’s Will.
“I’m going to go talk to Mediwitch Umbridge and see what happened.” Regulus said turning on his heal trying not to cry.
Draco sighed and looked away from his paperwork to his watch and saw he still had five hours left until his shift at St. Mungo’s was over. He hated the days he filled in for their A&E department. It seemed like every time he tried treating a patient he was promptly kicked from the room. They claimed that even though Harry Potter had saved his arse from Azkaban he was still Death Eater scum and they refused to be treated by him. This was why after his trial he left for America to escape his name and all the weird looks. He had only been back for about three months, and he already regretted leaving America. After returning to England he much preferred the muggle world over the magical world. He only filled in on occasion at St. Mungo’s, he was employed full time at London Grace Children’s Hospital as a pediatric emergency room physician. He had changed after the war, and it was a change he was proud of. He felt a gentle tap on his shoulder and turned around to see a blonde Mediwitch in lavender robes handing him a file.
Kieran smirked at his wife’s lecture aimed at Dumbledore’s lack of proper respect. “Headmaster, St. Mungo’s policy states that we require documentation on Magical Guardianship so if you don’t mind providing us an official copy from either The Ministry of Magic, or Gringotts Bank with the official seal. We’d be more then happy to provide you with information regarding the patient in question medical care.”
Regulus gently placed the phial into his pocket before reaching for Harry’s hand. “Harry fight. I promise you there is so much more to life than this. Trust me when I say you have a family that loves and cares for you already.
“Rubeus described a stand off between Harry’s male guardian who pushed Harry roughly against the wall. He heard Harry crying and Harry admitted that his wrist was broken so Rubeus brought him hear to St. Mungos where Bellatrix and I were just signing on for our shift. I took Harry from Rubeus who went to wait in the waiting room. Upon my initial examination of the left wrist and what Harry had said about Paracetamol I figured it was not a fresh break like was initially thought. The initial diagnostic charm confirmed my suspicion of it being a few days old break along with his wrist being broke seven times prior to this break.” Kieran paused for a few moments allowing Andromeda and Vivienne a moment to process what he had just said.
Kieran sat back down on the stool and grabbed his wand. “I’m going to start with your head and work my way to your toes.” The tip of his wand started emitting a light blue light as Kieran started with the top of Harry’s head the quill scribbling madly against the parchment. Listing out scary diagnoses that no child should ever have to deal with. Eventually the quill settled against the parchment meant that the scan of the head was complete.
“He was my healer, as much I hate to admit it he does make a great healer.” He grumbled sipping the sweet liquid trying to not let today’s failure get to him, usually if he failed during a raid the failure ate at him and caused even more sleeping problems than what he already had.
Kieran watched the child viciously attack the tray of food like someone who had been starved almost to death. He hated to think that this was probably one of the few proper meals he had in his lifetime. He ignored the lack of manners, he figured he would act the same way if someone had starved him for many years. “How is it?”
Harry walked down the block to an empty location between two shops and apparated back into his apartment stripping out of his clothes and into an old Gryffindor tee shirt and a pair of lounge shorts. He grabbed his clothes from the floor and tossed them into the laundry room. “Hey Kreacher.” Harry greeted the elf who was reading a newspaper at the table.
Bellatrix came into the room seeing that Harry was fast asleep in the bed and that Kieran was dealing with paperwork. “I’ve placed Harry’s lunch order, I figured with his size the only thing he might be able to get down is a protein shake, along with whatever nutrient potions you deem appropriate.”
Kieran soon saw Harry trying to wake up and processing his surroundings. “You are still at St. Mungo’s. You had an impressive nap; how are you feeling after your nap?”
“You two are terrible when it comes to your betting.” Kieran remarked not that he’d do anything about it. He found it vaguely entertaining. “We figured as much, probably was hoping to go searching for information regarding someone. He’s not exactly cunning.” He teased with a wink. “The kiddo is asleep don’t suppose you have a quick Quidditch injury I could heal before I go make sure he has dinner and make him comfortable for the night?
Harry looked at the envelope cautiously like it might bite him. He turned the letter over and saw a strange wax seal that had a lion, snake, badger, and eagle on it, it was unlike any of the other envelopes in his hand.
“Certainly.” Regulus said heading off in the direction of his office and his pensive. It was oftentimes helpful to view the memories with his patients to work through the trauma and that is when he noticed his husband sitting on the floor next to his office door.
“I’m sorry I have no idea why you would like to speak to about. I’m also confused as to why a Mind Healer is here at such an hour. The patients are perfectly fine and well.” She remarked looking down at her lapel watch.
“I’d love that it sounds painfully simple.” Kieran teased snatching the file from Grant’s hands and going into room four. “Hello! I’m Healer Kieran Reid.” He greeted politely sitting down on the stool. “So, what knee did the Bludger hit?
“I know you’ve been given a lot to process and to decide. Have you thought about a flavor of shake you would enjoy? I’d like to see you get down a protein shake and a few nutrient potions before your meeting with Regulus and Andromeda.”
“Wait my parents weren’t drunks who died because they were driving drunk after a night trying to forget their mistake.”
Kieran smiled at Bellatrix glad that his wife had saw the signs and ordered the child something gentle for lunch. “Thank you for doing that, I was just about to talk to Grant about Harry’s lunch. Oh, his lab results came in.” He said handing her the parchment watching his wife’s face fall. A similar reaction to his own.
Kieran let out of sigh of relief happy to be able to mark the no sexual abuse box. The abuse he was seeing was horrible he didn’t even want to think what would have happened if Vernon made good on that promise. It was clear the muggles hated everything this child ever did.
“Yeah Neville is an Auror, as is Ron.” Harry stated before uncorking the phial and chugging the contents. He wondered how Draco knew this potion tasted terrible but he let that question go.
“Get out of my cabin.” Vernon roared advancing on the giant he wanted to keep Harry where he was and not send his favorite maid and punching bag away to that freak school for nine months out of the twelve; what else would take his frustration out in life? He supposed he could try drinking but that didn’t seem nearly as fun.
Vernon kicked open the kitchen doorway and found the small freak drying the dishes. “Good fairy.” Vernon muttered. “How about you check the mail after you’re done with the dishes.”
“We promise kiddo, no going back to the muggles if you tell us what has happened. I’d also like to an in-depth health scan it will tell me everything that has ever happened to you over the course of the years and I’ll be able to heal any previous issues that didn’t quite heal right the first time.” Kieran took a breath before moving onto his next issue at hand.
He gently placed his left foot against the hard floor and then his right foot. He had barely made it a few steps before he hit the floor with a loud *thud* and the world went dark around him. The darkness felt comforting like he had been here once before.
The reply from the twins was almost instant. “Alright so I guess we will all be going to Alton Towers tomorrow.” He said as the elevator spat them out onto the second floor. The walked down the corridor to the cubical farm looking forward to their day of suspension.
He was a professional and this was his job, and this was his wing and if a Mediwitch was off the rails in her behavior he wanted to know about it. But at the same time Merlin it hurt so bad. This was Lily’s child, the same Lily who loved his husband like a brother. The same James who stood up for his relationship with Severus when Peter Pettigrew decided to go against his friends and make Severus’s life a living hell. He balled his fist and relaxed his fist. He saw the women in all pink gossiping with another staff member.
Harry sighed knowing that the Healer was getting an up-close view of everything his was grateful that he wasn’t being questioned. “Thank you for your help.”
“I’m sure you aren’t.” Draco teased setting his wand on the table. “Sorry my hands might be a little chilly.” He said running his fingers gently over Harry’s ribs as he looked for any signs of discomfort. He heard the hiss and saw Harry’s eyes turn dark like he wanted to hex him.
Kieran grabbed the chart from the table in front of him and waved his wand so that Regulus was keyed to the file. He didn’t particularly feel like discussing any of the words written on the parchment. He figured he’d let Regulus read the notes and ask questions when they arose. Right now, he just wanted quiet and to hear his wife’s breathing as the rage inside her settled.
“We really ought to do something on our day off, how about I see if Fred and George would like to brew a height potion and we can kidnap Victorie and Teddy and all go to Alton Towers. It’ll be fun.” Ron suggested pulling out his cell ready to text both Fred and George.
“My plan is to contact a neurological healer for help regarding his brain aneurysm since that is out of my comfort zone. We hope that Harry will have weekly or twice weekly sessions with Mr. Black-Snape regarding the anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I’m going to keep Mr. Potter under the comfort of potions today, make sure he eats a proper dinner and then tomorrow I’m going to sedate him and repair everything listed on the parchment.”
Bellatrix sighed in the medication room and hoped for once in his life that her husband was wrong. She grabbed the bottle of pain potion and the bottle of bubblegum flavoring. She poured the amount of pain potion into a crystal phial and dropped four drops of bubblegum flavoring into the phial. She gently spun the phial mixing the potion and flavoring together when she was finished the potion was a lovely shade of light pink.
Harry raised an eyebrow at the question. “Vernon once threatened to show me what it meant to be a ‘pillow biter’ when he saw Draco’s name when I was around nine. But he never did anything. There were a lot of words like ‘fairy’ and ‘poof’ but never any touching outside of the whip and my bare butt.” Harry hurriedly said wanting to be done with this conversation.
“Wait he’s Draco’s mate?” Regulus asked not getting that far into the chart before having questions regarding what was written.
“I agree with you. Can you please agree not to hex, or curse Dumbledore? I like my wife in blue scrubs and not in Azkaban robes.” He teased softly linking his hand with hers. “We will make sure that kid gets justice and a has an adopted family that will love and care about him and he becomes a fantastic wizard and graduates from Hogwarts. After all he’s family now.”
Neville and Ron nodded silently they had seen enough as an Auror to know exactly where Harry was coming from at the moment. “Our world has changed for the better since the war.” Ron said honestly looking at the watch on his arm. “Damnit our lunch break is over, time to go back to paperwork.” He was deeply annoyed at the thought. He grabbed his bottle of juice and followed Harry and Neville to the elevator. He leaned against the wall of the elevator wishing he would have just called in sick and spent his day with his pregnant wife who was worshiping the toilet like it was Merlin.
Harry sighed loudly at the idea of someone other then his medical staff seeing whatever appeared from the scan, but at the same time after almost nine years of abuse; only five of it he could remember he wanted something to be done and wanted to get away from the Dursley’s and their hatred towards him. “I’ll get into the hospital gown on one condition.”
“How is Teddy, when I visit Andromeda and Narcissa I see him on occasion he really is a cute kid.” Draco admitted glad that Harry was raising Teddy. “I can assure this next part won’t take that much longer.” He said grabbing his wand. “Take a deep breath.” He instructed running his wand along Harry’s punctured lung. “Another deep breath.” In what sounded almost like a coo, Harry had to have imagined that.
“Sorry mate, it was just really funny is all.” Ron said patting Harry’s shoulder. “I almost forgot I’m getting drinks with the twins later, want to join?” He asked thinking that Harry needed to do something other than stay at home and raise Teddy. “Mum can have Teddy sleep over, you know she loves him.”
“Mother you want to hear something kind of funny, apparently, Hermione and Neville are engaged. I never would have pictured those two together.” He said finishing his own glass of wine.
“One of my teachers in primary school complained that I was having difficulty seeing the blackboard, so Petunia went to a rummage sale and found the glasses. They never really helped. Most of my current teachers assume I have some form of blindness.” Harry admitted finding it was strangely easy to admit things to Bellatrix and Kieran. He pulled away from Bellatrix’s touch. He had a prior burn on his back and didn’t want her accidently touching or rub it.
“Hello Harry.” Kieran said sitting on the edge of the bed. He had been a Healer long enough that Harry’s heart was beating rapidly, and he was probably close to a panic attack if they weren’t careful. “You are at St. Mungo’s. Do you remember me from earlier?”
Kieran saw Bellatrix emerge from the elevator from getting her bag from the staff room and raise her eye at the obnoxious display of pinks scrubs which he understood if that pink were to get any brighter, he believed they’d be neon. He signed the last piece of paperwork and linked his arms with his own. “Ignore the pink.”
“You have been disrespectful to a Headmaster and Chief Warlock.”
“Thank you.” He said looking over the chart and raised an eyebrow. “Harry Potter, really?” He questioned seeing that Harry was now an Auror and was injured in a raid. Draco knew that this case would probably be the same as the one from earlier in which a father had a meltdown at the idea of his son being treated by Death Eater scum, and how he should have suffered the same fate as his now dead father.
“Don’t.” Harry hissed roughly shoving the sleeve back down before Kieran could get a glimpse of the name.
Regulus felt the rage throughout his body. He didn’t know Petunia all that well, he vaguely remembered her being present at the wedding and mentioning something about Lily being the favorite. He wanted to find them and yell loudly that the Potter’s were not drunks and that they loved baby Harry like crazy. He remembered how happy his brother was the day James and Lily had named his as Dogfather. He also could hear Harry’s excited squeals of excitement as he rode Padfoot around the house.
She watched Kieran scan Harry’s upper limbs and lower limbs as the quill angrily scribbled prior injuries and breaks. The parchment of previous breaks took up one and a half pages. It appears Harry’s bones were very susceptible to breaks which would be true of someone very malnourished.
“Ron, that is great news, I am sure you are going to be an excellent father. So, what did Molly have to say?” Harry asked knowing that Mrs. Weasley had to be extremely thrilled over the news. He knew that anytime one of her children had announced they were expecting she instantly went into grandmother mode. She liked to joke that she would like a whole Quidditch team full of grandchildren.
“And now for the Nutrient Potion which has everything your body is lacking.” She took the cork off that phial and took the now empty phial from the child and handed him the full green potion.
“The Aneurysm ruptured. He was fine when I left for the night, we had just made sure he had dinner and gave him a dose of pain receptor blocker and Bellatrix got him an extra blanket and he was close to sleep again. After a few hours the three of us were alerted that he wasn’t responsive. We rushed here and found him unconscious in the middle of the room; after a quick scan it showed his aneurysm had ruptured and that he had recent seizure activity. We got him safely back into bed and we have given him a blood replenisher along with getting the OR prepped.” Kieran explained as Adrien did his own scans of Harry’s brain.
“You made me feel,” Draco starts, but he has to turn away. He can’t look at Harry. He can’t let him see his face. It feels like too much to bear his soul, he doesn’t think he could take Harry seeing the pain, the shame,
Though there are a handful of times Potter’s gaze flickers across the fire. When their eyes meet, something subtle and sensual rises up within Draco, so he looks away and concentrates on Longbottom’s current Herbology experiment and removes all thoughts of firelit green eyes from his mind.
“Enter,” he responded.
“Don’t you worry about it,” she chided, “Go sit down.”
“Oh,” Potter said. “I think—er—maybe thirty feet?”
Potter offers him a sheepish smile. “Orion never tucked Phaeden in.”
“I love you, too.” She smiled at him and the tension in his chest abated. The bell in the foyer chimed, signalling Ophiuchus’ return. “Let me warm our breakfast back up while you go see to the post.”
“How about a Bludger to the knee?” Grant said holding up the file.
“Harry you have a Brain Aneurysm and if I had to guess what might have caused it would be the fact that you’ve had a concussion every year since you were one years old. Your parents sadly passed away when you were one. I just need to say yes or no if any of this was caused by some time of physical abuse.”
Harry turned off the TV and looked down at the sleeping child who had fallen asleep midway through Lilo and Stitch. “Come on Teddy time for bed.” He cooed gently afraid to pick the child up in fear of doing more damage to his ribs. He knew Draco had healed them up nicely, but he was still afraid.
“I feel the same way you do right now Trix. James and Lily loved that child more than anything in the world and Sirius was so happy to be named as the Godfather.” He muttered shedding a tear at the idea of his brother.
Harry sighed in relief glad to be safe and away from the Dursley’s if only for a moment. He thought for sure he had finally passed out from the pain and had dreamed about the kindly Half-Giant and the nurse with the wild black hair.
“I could tell based on body language when I gave him the dragon that he had probably never been giving anything nice like that from his guardians. He seems deeply uncomfortable with the idea of physical touch. He also seems reluctant to trust adults to get him the justice he needs. He’s probably been in this situation before with trying to tell someone about his home life and it did not end well.”
Kieran turned over his left wrist and unbuckled his watch. He showed Harry his wrist where the name Bellatrix Druella Black was etched into his skin. “The names on our wrist are a gift from Lady Magic; she got tired of seeing her children in pain and gifted us with the name of the person who is our perfect match.
“What about school?” Harry questioned.
Harry laughed at the way Draco sneered his name, he forgot how sexy Malfoy’s sneer was. “Maybe.” He said looking down at his phone. “I can have Teddy stay the night with the Weasley’s, so how about seven.” He suggested. “I’ll let you pick the bar.”
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you.” Hagrid pointed the pink umbrella in his hand at the child near the window and suddenly the child sprouted a pink pig’s tail from his buttocks. “Harry would you like to come with me?”
“Dolores Umbridge I’d like a word.” Regulus said flatly crossing his arms over his chest realizing he was still in a tee shirt and joggers.
Harry sighed at Bellatrix’s explanation about why he was being moved to a different floor. At least this time the people seemed to be on his side, rather the side of his ‘relatives’ and other people. He let out a small moan once the first sip of the shake hit his tastebuds.
“I was afraid of that.” Kieran muttered removing the privacy shield from around them. “Harry, how do you feel after the dose of pain medication.” He asked as he sat down on the stool and moved it closer to Harry’s bed. “Can you stretch out for me; it can’t possibly be comfortable in that position. Not to mention the stress it is putting on your injured wrist.”
Anyway enough of my rambling enjoy the new chapter and as always thank you so much for all the comments, kudos, and bookmarks. :)
Grant poked his head into the room knowing that Kieran and Bellatrix were not going to enjoy what he needed to tell them. “Do one of you have a moment?” He asked politely.
“Looks like a stick.”
Draco smirked and gave Harry a smile showing most of his teeth. “I’m a pretty good Healer, huh.” He teased. “Do you mind lifting up your shirt so I can check out your chest?” He questioned. “So, when did Hermione and Neville get together?” He still was having difficulty picturing those two together.
“I don’t remember my first time using a floo landing in Knockturn Alley.” Ron snapped watching Hermione dust the soot from his black robes. “Thanks.”
“You have a couple broken ribs, and you might have a punctured lung, it would explain your breathing issues.” Draco explained to the Auror letting him process what was wrong. He strolled over to the cabinet and grabbed a pain potion. “Here drink this, it will make the next part easier.” He handed Harry the phial watching him uncork the potion and down it in one go.
Bellatrix laughed softly at the name. “Love, he is an arse. A talented arse but he couldn’t give two shits about his patients that wind up near him. But we could use his talent and it isn’t like Harry will be spending time with Adrien while awake.”
• panic attacks ? Anxiety attacks? Maybe?
• distant myself from my “friends”
Draco sighs as he looks at the book he took out of the malfoy manor library on how to look for signs of abuse. He sits the paper down;
Hero complex.
We learn Draco’s plan.
draco was panting in pain by the end of the spell. Maybe he should have read the spell more but at least he knows it works. Deciding he’ll have all tomorrow to add more bruises before he heads for school this year he pushes everything to under his bed laying down for the night.
However, knowing he will need Harry to get him out of this predicament he also acknowledged to himself that by their past he can’t simply walk up to the boy and ask for help.
“Nah,” Teddy scrunched his nose. “I don’t like yellow! Plus I want to go on adventures and be brave and strong like Harry!”
He briefly considered the situation Andromeda must have been in, what with Teddy standing by and Potter refusing to go to the hospital.
Masker nodded and turned back to his work. “Alright. See you in a few days.”
took full stock of someone’s magic and put it into a series of quantifiable terms. It helped establish magical signatures and residual spells and was mostly used by Healers in congruence with law enforcement agencies. But there were a handful of cases where a person’s magic could affect them, causing problems from within, and lead to any number of other side effects.
“What are you looking for? Is it bad?”
“Yes!” Blaise grinned. He turned to Pansy and raised his eyebrows suggestively. “What about you and your obsession with that hack in Sports and Gaming? Cormac McLaggin?”
“The wards in the dining room aren’t going to help your nightmares.”
All at once he felt overjoyed, humiliated, unsteady, righteous and smug. It had taken a few brief moments for him to conclude that it was indeed not a joke or mistake, but an actual, honest to Merlin offer for the position of a lifetime.
Draco had learned early in his internship the differences between accidental injuries and injuries of intent. Accidental injuries were easiest to fix once identified, and more often than not, left very few traces behind. But injuries of intent were far more complex and entangled with the fabric of an individual’s magic. Premeditated injuries, Draco learned, sliced and bruised and aimed to leave a mark, and that sort of intention was powerful, oftentimes, and in his case, too powerful to erase.
“So...” she said. Even in the darkness of early evening, with only the streetlamps illuminating them, her eyes were bright and wide and fixed on him intently. She licked her lips. “That was wild.”
“A few shorter days,” Draco had repeated. “I think I can manage that.”
“Even when it’s with themselves?” He grins, teasing, and Draco thinks the warmth of it will melt him on the spot. Potter ignores Draco’s silence and walks into the room. He points to his bag. “I came to get this." He eyes Draco. “Might need it later.”
He wanted so badly for the words that Harry had said to be true. Draco desperately needed to be redeemed, to be someone other than the young man that he was. He’d been handed such privilege, been given a place at Hogwarts where he utilised his clever nature and all the masks and subterfuge that had been ingrained in him. He’d had a hand in devious plots and people had died. And yet Harry Potter stood in front of all of wizardom and told a different tale. He spoke of a different side of Draco, and perhaps even shined a light on the truth.
“I’ve had an assessment before,” Potter glared.
and prep him for surgery,” Draco breathed. He glanced around and met the nurse’s eyes. “Now!” He gulped and took a step back. “And get me a second Healer to assist. Someone from Spell Damage.”
At the sound of her voice, Theo turned his head to find the source, eventually locking eyes with Draco. He ran his eyes up and down Draco’s body before letting them flit off to stare at the dance floor. He smiled wickedly, “The prodigal son returns!”
He made for the door and every step was a rush of relief, another breath of clarity washing over him. There was a tangle of what felt like infinite emotions inside him, and he didn’t have the patience or the energy to figure out what they were. He didn’t know if he wanted to. As Draco was about to step out of the kitchen, he remembered why Potter had been there in the first place. He turned back to find confusion etched all over Potter’s face.
Draco blinked and sighed, “A year of not having the threat of Azkaban looming over one’s head might do the trick.”
“One can never be too thorough,” Malfoy smiled. He started trailing kisses over the sensitive skin of Harry’s neck.
“There’s nobody behind me,” Harry gritted out. “It’s six-thirty in the morning.”
“I haven’t seen your squirrel in a few days,” his mother said, as if sensing his thoughts.
Biting his lip, Draco curses his luck. The pout Potter gives him could’ve made the Dark Lord himself turn sides in the war.
• make sure I sneak away for these “abusive” things to happen
• fake an injury get Harry Potter’s Attention?
Also one more disclaimer - DO NOT READ IF YOU NOT OKAY WITH FALSE ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL, MENTAL, AND PHYSICAL ABUSE.
• Confine in a adult “I” - Potter trust
Hope you enjoy the prologue. The actual chapters will be longer I promise :) also follow for updates on tumblr @ m0ony-padfo0t ❤️
Without reading further than just it will leaving marks on his body and that he has to truly imagine the image for it to work, he grabs his wand pulling his sleeve up.
It was 2 nights before the start of Draco 5th year at Hogwarts when he heard it. When he heard his parents conversation. He didn’t hear much but he heard enough;
He swears he could find anything in the malfoy manor library. Which is also why he grab some books so he can find a way to cause marks on his body. He can’t claim abuse and be without a scratch.
Draco knew exactly who he will need help from. So he doesn’t end up on the side with an craze man. Who supposedly hates anything but pureblood’s but isn’t one himself. Draco isn’t stupid, he knows the crazed man is just power crazy.
• Flinch away
• act more quieter
Just thinking about being a death eater scared the living crap out of him. As soon as he caught on to what they wanted the boy to do in the future he dashes as quickly as he can upstairs locking his door. Draco slides down on a verge of a panic attack as he realizes he needs a plan. He needs to get out of there before next summer where he will be forced to be just like his father; or probably die.
in his eyes. “You made me feel
Fueled by the sudden comprehension of his feelings, Draco turned off the shower, dried himself, and rushed to the desk in his bedroom. He scribbled out a note to Blaise.
“My—my mother?” Draco says. “She’s been here?”
Narcissa sighed and after a brief pause, smiled. “Yes, I suppose you’re right. No need to busy ourselves with things best left to the professionals.”
“Some of these are dated,” Harry says. “They’re more than a decade old. You’ve been drawing me…”
But he couldn’t spout off unproven theories and he certainly wouldn’t openly divulge patient information, even to his best friend, even within the walls of his house, even standing in his bedroom. Draco had the beginning of a theory taking shape in the back of his mind: it all went pack to Padma Patil’s words during their first Post-Op check-in.
” Draco stabs his fork into his salad.
“It isn’t my fault that you’re a glutton for punishment,” Malfoy whispered.
“Draco?”
He realises quickly that Harry had been sincere in his initial letter when he’d said he valued and respected Draco’s skills. Once Harry had left him alone on the first day of the project, Draco had taken several walkthroughs of the home for the sole — hand to Salazar — purpose of inspecting the installations of his paintings. He was impressed with the positioning of
“You can’t say no to her,” Potter says, almost laughing.
Luckily for Draco, the sun was just setting and the streets seemed to be emptying as people went home or ventured into restaurants to eat. He figured it was as good a time as any to dash into Borgin and Burkes without being seen. He wasn’t doing anything wrong by setting foot into Knockturn Alley, but he couldn’t avoid feeling as if he were two steps away from being accused of breaking the law.
“Well, his vitals are still strong,” Patil said, her voice rousing Draco from his thoughts.
“Earth to Draco?” Pansy poked him. “This shirt...” she said and pushed a long-sleeved black button up to his chest. “...will kill.”
“If he’s not here, he’s probably lying in a bed at St Mungo’s,” Theo laughed. “Don’t you know? He takes home a different person every night.”
you?” Pansy shrieked. “You didn’t move a single muscle the entire time.”
Except that Draco’s known every inch of that face since his first year at Hogwarts, and shamefully must admit that there were few things he knew better than the details and figure of Harry’s form.
“I don’t want to say,” he said, pulling away.
Blaise shrugged. “With any luck, maybe none of them will be there and some lowly part-time worker will receive the delivery.”
“I am,” Draco nodded, and without really thinking said, “but the nightmares right now are—” Once he caught himself, he stopped, and stared down at the floor.
Draco sobbed into her neck. “I don’t think I can forgive him.”
Pansy snorted and patted him on the back. “No, Draco,” she grinned, “she really means it.” She blinked and stood a bit taller. “You let a qualified professional do the job that you couldn’t. It’s alright. Just admit it.”
Draco craned his head around to see what she meant. He looked just in time to see Potter leaving the dance floor, wobbly on his feet, animatedly having a conversation with three of the people who had been dancing with him, one of whom was helping him stay on his feet.
“Draco Malfoy wouldn’t dare let Harry Potter die on his table, now would he?”
It’s large enough that Draco doesn’t have to concentrate too hard on balancing, but when he’s about halfway across, he looks down, missteps, and fumbles forward. Firm hands grip his hips from behind and steady him until he can stand up straight and regain his balance. He turns his head and shivers. Potter’s directly behind him, almost pushed up against his back.
Potter shakes his head. “There are five enclosures...one for Ron and Hermione. One for Dean and Seamus. One for Luna, Justin, and Caleb—”
Draco chided, “Save your
Draco hadn’t known how much he’d needed it until he found himself looking forward to their afternoons together. It had been a rare occurrence for him to glance at the clock during his shifts back in France; he could only recall doing so for things like his mother’s birthday or the rare occasions when he’d had plans to fuck someone when he left the hospital.
Potter glared at him. “What?”
Potter’s grin widened. “That’s no fun at all.”
“You’re obviously fine now,” Draco says. He walks over to the window and recovers his discarded book. “I was in the middle of something when your friends left you to catch your death.”
Blaise grins. “
Blaise eyed him. “I mean, I can get you some Brilhante Berries
and Potter reads
times.”
“I know,” Weasley sighed dejectedly. “I know.”
Patil’s words bothered Draco, but he found himself distracted with more pressing things. Potter’s vitals were strong and he had come through surgery remarkably well for the injuries he’d sustained. But he showed signs of malnutrition and exhaustion; he weighed less than he should, he had patches of hair loss around the sides of his face, and the dark circles under his eyes were too pronounced to have been a result of his recent trauma. Draco considered the patient’s recent history and if it was possible he’d been working himself too hard.
He doesn’t even bother knocking. He opens Potter’s door, turns and closes it slowly, laying his palm against the door as it softly wedges into the frame. He’s desperately trying to manage his breathing, but Draco can’t seem to catch his breath.
Draco peeled his eyes away from the mess of bloody flesh and scanned the man’s face. Tan skin, dark beard, full lips, impressive cheekbones, long lashes, abysmally kept shaggy hair hiding a large, lightning-shaped scar across the temple.
While he waited for either the Muggle substance analysis or the
He and Patil worked methodically in silence for several more minutes before she took a step back and stretched her arms. “I have no idea why you seemed so stressed earlier,” she said. “It seems to me you could’ve performed this procedure in your sleep.”
Draco nodded. “It was a spinal reconstruction, and we had a tough spot of it with the spinal fusion. The patient’s vitals kept tanking.”
this song!”
was one of the oil paintings up for auction and it held subtle pieces of Draco in every single stroke. The Malfoys had cultivated peacocks for centuries, and when Draco’s mind healer had asked him to identify some of the things that he still loved about his family’s estate, the memories from his childhood of collecting feathers and terrorising the peafowl had brought a smile to his face. But the reality after the war was something altogether less familiar. Gone were the dozens of prideful peacocks. All that remained were two haggard old males, missing half their feathers, and there were disfigurations where their legs and wings had broken and healed over. Their injuries forced them to cobble around the grounds without a shred of the lurid and distinguishable figures that they’d formerly carried.
Potter stares at him, a faint flush spreading from his face and down his neck. The steam must really be affecting him. He breaks his gaze and runs his fingers over the top of the water, saying, “It’s—it feels good—to ahh—” He bites his lip. “You know, I still haven’t felt a normal temperature since Ron push—” he stops. “Since the lake.”
Potter shakes his head. “Not lives—I mean—yes, I would try to save my—but I meant—” He stares at Draco like he’s dissecting him, piece by piece, pulling the parts of him away that he’d built up to hide the darker, troubled things that had always weighed him down. “I just meant, I might have done things differently. Especially with us.”
“Hmm,” Malfoy hummed, narrowing his eyes and pushing his lips together into a thin line (Harry was definitely
“Punish me?” Harry’s mouth dropped open.
Every step toward Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes felt heavier than the last. Each foot forward was a betrayal, leading him to his ultimate demise. It was a particularly lovely autumn day, crisp and breezy, and yet Draco was sweating underneath his cloak and robes.
The tension pulls at every nerve in his body as everything tightens, waiting for that final moment that would bring him over the edge. “Potter,” he whines, “please.”
gave it to you in one hateful curse. A
Draco agrees to play and grabs a bottle of Riesling to soothe his worried thoughts. Had he done or said something to offend Potter? Turn him off somehow? Was his teasing about the Quidditch stats taken the wrong way? Draco loses to Longbottom and then excuses himself to fix his lunch. He finds Potter sulking in the kitchen, violently spooning cookie dough onto a buttered baking sheet.
“Was it a bad one?” his mother asked after a while. “The surgery?”
The entire conversation had stirred up too many warring feelings inside him. Draco desperately craved having someone in his bed to satiate his physical desires. While he felt no shame in using his own hands or something from his stash of charmed toys, nothing replaced the warmth of someone else’s body, their breath hot against his skin, or all the other incalculable and exclusive sensations that only another person could supply. He’d had fuck buddies in France, a few that lasted longer than a year, but nothing serious ever presented itself to him. He wasn’t sure he would’ve considered it even if it had.
“Staring at Potter, are we?” she smirked. “Nothing’s changed in fifteen bloody years.”
Blinking, Draco pulled himself from the wall and grabbed an O.R. kit. “Male in his late twenties presenting with a massive hemothorax and an unknown combination of spell damage to the chest.” He went through the pre-op motions while he tried to calm his rapidly accelerating heart rate. He turned toward Patil, his mind flooding with memories and unspoken words and questions. “I —” he started but stopped when she brushed past him to enter the O.R..
“I know,” she said, crying in his ear.
She gave him a commanding and weighty stare. “Then the only thing stopping you is your own fear.”
that I started to suspect it was a reference.”
“Excellent.” Malfoy proceeded to help the next caller uncover the secret history of an ancient mythical burial ground in their home’s garden. “Have you tried questioning the gnomes?”
“Your leg is broken,” Draco replied. He picked up the jacket and tossed it aside.
“I better get back to—”
(See the end of the chapter for
you, hmm?”
There it was again, that look that he wanted to fall into.
“How should I drink it, then?” Potter asked, holding out the glass, his eyes bright and challenging.
of fresh linen fragrance. Next, Weasley cast mending charms on the torn pillows, restuffing them and placing them up against the mahogany headboard. Judging by the way he arranged the pillows, leaving a lumpy white one on the right side, Draco wondered if it wasn’t the first time Weasley had to clean up Potter’s bedroom.
He slowed down his stride after that and enjoyed the rest of his quiet stroll. He found amusement in the fact that Blaise was in fact pulling Draco out of his shell, little by little, even if he hadn’t meant to, exactly. He wondered if there had even been a raid that afternoon or if Blaise was simply pulling one over on him.
“Everything,” Draco whispers.
energy elixir and downed it.
Draco paused mid-step. “No. I only need one to sample it and confirm that this is what’s in his system.”
“I’ve done some thinking,” he manages to say. His eyes adjust to the dark room and he it feels like an eternity before Potter replies.
Potter’s pout turns into a smirk. “Is that so?”
“No!” Harry said, suddenly flustered. “No, it’s really—you can’t fix it here?”
“Draco,” Andromeda turned to him, “I have a few things to give Cissy. Would you come to my office and help me gather them up?”
“Fuck, fuck,” Draco repeats, unable to form a single coherent thought as Potter’s tongue breaches him. “Fuck,” he moans.
“Be that as it may, this—” Draco turns toward his door. “
“That’s a stretch,” Draco said pointedly.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea,” Blaise shakes his head. “We don’t know how magic will interact with the charmed lake water.”
“Noted,” Draco replied.
Draco gulped and nodded. He didn’t look at Potter again as he followed his aunt out of the room and into the study. She offered him a quick smile before explaining the various things she’d found in some boxes in her garage. “Old memories,” she said, handing him a stack of scrapbooks. “I think your mother will enjoy them.”
Pansy shrieked, “That’s not even close!” to one of Spinnet’s accents.
He finishes the painting restorations and sees to their installations, making sure everything is exactly how Harry wants it. His feelings for Harry — still technically his employer — reach an inappropriate pinnacle when Draco finds himself daydreaming of scenarios where Harry comes home to the finished project and thanks Draco for his work in several different ways, in several different rooms, in several different positions. Draco’s never been one to be distracted with idle fantasy, but every moment he spends in Harry’s home, every moment he stays as a fixture in the man’s life, the measure of his passion and devotion increases.
“Believe it or not,” Draco smirked as he knelt down beside Potter, “I’ve seen it
Malfoy pulled a pocket watch from his well-fitted waistcoat. “It’s six-thirty-nine in the morning, Head Auror Potter, and I have an appointment at six-forty.”
“This too,” Potter tugs at Draco’s jumper. They both pull it over his head and hold it between them for a moment. Potter stares at him. “Will you let me touch you?” He pulls the jumper out of Draco’s grasp and tosses it to the side. “Will you let me make you feel good, Draco?”
Draco settled into his favourite armchair in the study, sitting back and sipping a glass of firewhisky. It was his first Wednesday off in weeks, and he had the Manor to himself. Narcissa was visiting a friend in France, Blaise was doing Merlin knew what, and Pansy was supposedly on assignment in Ireland.
Pansy gave him a look of confusion. She eyed him speculatively then glanced at the dance floor and said, “He’s been on desk duty at the D.M.L.E. since you treated him.” She took a sip from her drink and raised an eyebrow. “Don’t you have something you can prescribe him to help with—” She flung her hand into the air and whirled it around, “
This is where he comes up with his plan. Draco gets up walking to his bed grabbing an parchment paper and quill setting up him a space to write the plan. Not before he enchanted the paper though, nobody will see it besides him.
So he finds himself reading a very dark book. Most would say it is full of dark magic, even Draco would agree with that statement. However, the boy is still looking in it and he is glad he does because he finds a perfect spell.
• Be discrete so it’s not blown to much out of proportion.
“I was just doing my job,” Draco said.
Draco tore his eyes away from the antiquities assistant who was packaging the painting.
Weasley and Finnigan head inside and Potter sidles up next to Draco. The heat radiating from him is enough to make Draco think he might’ve cast a Warming Charm on himself.
Potter raises his hand and splashes a bit of water toward Draco. “I didn’t want to make a fuss. Besides, I’m sure it’s all in my head.” He smiles, and the warmth in his eyes triggers a familiar ache in Draco’s chest.
“So Draco,” Blaise said, widening his eyes and turning his head away from Theo. “Pansy told me she and Alicia came over and rid your bedroom of a Voldy Signet?”
Potter offered him a wry smile and stood up. “Probably more times than you have.” He walked over to the counter, grabbed Draco’s wine glass, and downed the rest of its contents. “That’s very nice,” he said.
“What is the purpose of having gorgeous long hair if you won’t let anyone see you with it down?” she pouted as they walked to the foyer.
Draco almost scoffs. “I don’t know what you mean!”
“Maybe later,” Malfoy said, pulling away and spitting down where his hand was jerking Harry off. “You’re so desperate for it, you wouldn’t last anyway, Potter.”
house in Draco’s mind. He catalogues the collection of keys, glasses, packs of gum and quills that Harry keeps on a tray by the Floo and grows to appreciate the mess of paperwork and open texts spread out on the formal dining room table. When he asks Harry why he doesn’t use the rather large, ornately carved desk in the study, he gets waved away.
Pansy quickly distracted him with her disappointment at Draco's refusal to let his hair down and tousle it. He opted instead to leave it tied back at the nape of his neck.
Harry — who was inside the box in question — had regrets. In fact, the list of his regrets was growing with every minute spent snuggly curled up inside one of Madam Hargreeve’s Specialty Party Cakes waiting to surprise Draco for his thirtieth birthday. He’d wanted to get Draco something special. They had been together for nearly a decade, and living together for more than half that time. He’d considered various pieces of jewelry, a weekend vacation to their favourite cottage, and a handful of other things, but Ron planted it in his head that he needed to do something different, something outlandish, something
He looked
“He doesn’t—”
She smirked. “Oh come on! Narcissa’s out of town, this is the best night to pull.” She grabbed him and forced him down the hallway in the direction of his bedroom. “If we get you changed into something a bit more enticing, they’ll be throwing themselves at you left and right.”
“Everyone thinks they know what they want. But the reality is quite different. You’re drowning in an ocean of chaos and hypotheticals, gasping for air—”
“An unplottable home,” Draco said, impressed. “Potter really takes his privacy seriously.”
Weasley seemed to snap out of his thoughts and nodded. “Right. Well, I guess I’ll see you around.” He walked away and positioned himself behind the counter close enough to bark orders at some of the staff.
” Granger clenched her jaw and stared down at the ground. He realised they didn’t necessarily want answers in that moment, they wanted comfort. And they needed to be able to trust him. “I can’t tell you what exactly is wrong with him,” he finally said. “But the initial evaluation leads me to believe there is no lasting damage. If I’d have to take a guess, I would say that a few factors have led to a state of complete physical exhaustion, and he’s merely in a regenerative state. In such a deep sleep, it is rare, but one can have an episode similar to a night terror when the sleep cycle is interrupted or…” He paused and turned to Granger. “Potter is strong. Stronger than most. He will be alright. I have to be as thorough as possible, and that means examining the state of his magic.”
Draco chokes on air. “He what?”
Draco felt the blood drain from his face and suddenly he didn’t feel comfortable.
“I am not interested in hiking to a scenic overlook and freezing my bollocks off.” Draco got up and helped Blaise button his coat. “When you get to the top, Apparate back here and get me.”
it like one of your liquors at the Tricky Thestral.”
“I can do so much more,” Potter breathes. “If you’ll let me.”
Sure, you’ve been fearful on many occasions. But this? This is different. This is shaky hands opening up the Vanishing Cabinet for the first time. This is your stomach churning as your sick stains the bottom of the loo for the fifth night in a row. It’s the skin on the back of your neck becoming so oversensitive that you’ve resigned yourself to acute hyperawareness. It’s as if your body’s Divined that its time of death has been set, and the warning bells refuse to cease ringing. You learn to ignore them. Your body is nothing to you anymore. Because it’s your parents’ lives in your hands, and you’re spiraling.
, advised that when one was feeling restless, they should try stepping out of their comfort zone.
Pansy’s eyes went wide. “I could ask the same,” she smirked and pointed to Draco’s robes. “
He’d made a reminder in his calendar to owl someone later in the week about it and he spent the rest of Sunday preparing for his first day at St Mungo’s.
“We could try the Disrobe Charm?” he offers, unsure if he can physically remove another item of Potter’s clothes without bursting into flames. He’s filled with guilt that he even feels the least bit aroused in the midst of such an emergency. For Circe’s sake, Potter’s not even conscious!
In adulthood, Draco had feared the Pensieve, for so many reasons, but mostly because he couldn’t dare face some of the people he’d let down:
But their paths rarely crossed at the Remembrance Day feasts after the first one. Draco was thankful for that. As memories of the loss and the violence faded, people’s eyes were steadily more focused present. All the feasts following the first commemoration, Draco had a distinct feeling — from stares to scowls to outright curses — that his memories and his experiences were best left remembered within the confines of his own mind.
He offers him another wide smile and Draco blinks. “No,” Harry says, “but Teddy likes to talk about the peacocks. Narcissa keeps him entertained with lots of stories.”
“How do you know how things were before? It’s never explicitly stated what type of friendship they had.”
He felt around for his wand under his pillow and raised it above his head. “
He frowned.
did Draco allow himself a cursory glance at the face at the top of the table.
Patil appeared in the doorway holding two styrofoam cups.
?” Draco bites his lip and shakes his head. “A hook-up on vacation? A string of sexual encounters until you find someone better, someone worth courting?”
“Like he values you as a friend?” Draco laughs. “Pushing you in the lake and then leaving you behind to recover while he galivants up a mountain.”
Potter lifts his hand to Draco’s cheek and gently strokes it. The touch is tender and Draco aches. His heart flips and his cock twitches.
Left by themselves, Draco grabbed Blaise’s arm before he could Apparate to Diagon, whispering, “You’ve always been better at Glamours. Could you…” He turned his gaze down to his exposed neck and the
realise you’re sending me to an early grave?” He pointed to the desk and its stacks of parchments and logbooks. “I hope you’re ready to draft a letter to my mother to explain as such.”
Pansy and Blaise led him to a round booth on a raised platform overlooking the main dancefloor where a group of familiar faces greeted them. Greg Goyle was sitting cosy next to Daphne Greengrass, while across the table, Theodore Nott sat practically coiled around another man who looked mildly familiar, but Draco couldn’t place him.
“This isn’t gratitude. I thought we—we’ve been dancing around this for months.”
Harry gathers Draco up in his arms and buries his face in the curve of Draco’s neck.
Dreamless ages ago.” He lowered his voice. “I think it’s just been the transition. The stress of moving and a new job, especially being back here. Being back at the Manor. Even with the bloody signet removed, it’s still a lot to just be living there. But we had Aunt Andi over for supper and she said there was a remarkable improvement to the
“You were shouting so loudly, I could hear you all the way in the cantina.” Draco took a long look at Potter’s face while he was staring at the floor between his bed and where Draco stood. The man had been incensed, and Draco wanted to know why. “I won’t redact anything from my reports,” he explained.
Draco gulps. “The others…”
His first patient.
“You’re counting?” Potter grinned.
“He’s just having flashbacks from school,” Blaise smirked.
“You don’t have to worry about me,” Draco assured them. “I have trained and prepared for this very moment. As far as the work goes, I am
“Anytime,” he smiled.
“Oh, fuck,” Blaise cursed. “That’s today? Sorry, Draco, this….mess….it has to get put right before we open for deliveries tomorrow. I’m going to be here all night.”
“We made it!” Pansy squealed and squeezed herself in next to Daphne in the booth.
Harry smiled back at him. “One home.”
The clerk frowned. “Sir, are you trying to cancel?”
Potter’s warm hands cup his arse cheeks and pry them apart. It’s a baptism of fire when the slow drag of Potter’s tongue trails up his taint to his hole.
He’s clutching the sheets and tearing up the bed, writhing in something he’d never describe as pleasure, but instead blissful agony. He’s desperate for it but knows he’ll never get enough; it’s a teasing dance when Potter’s lips suck and his tongue slides in and out of him. When Potter pauses to spit in his hand, Draco thinks he might die from the loss of his tongue, but then he buries his face in Draco’s arse again, only this time his hand reaches up and starts stroking his achingly hard cock.
Draco doesn’t mean to stay in the kitchen working, but he’d been talking to Granger about some new potion laws and had to jot down his ideas. He’d promised himself he’d stay away from work, but the concepts were quite thrilling and, after all, he did have his glass of wine to finish. He takes a sip and then completes his final thoughts.
Whatever reprehensible reputation followed him, Draco’s credentials as a healer were indisputable. When it came time to move on from Notre Dame, to apply for the position of healer-in-charge, Draco considered a myriad of different options. He’d looked at private clinics, foreign institutes and outreach programs across the globe. He’d sent his resume and letters of recommendation to Russia, Japan, South Africa and New Mexico, United States. Never did he consider a move back to England, especially not after the varying levels of judgment he had faced in France.
“Malfoy,” Potter started but then paused as if suddenly processing Draco’s words, and cocked his head to the side. “Wait, what?”
, too, and he had never gotten to a place of being
“What?” Draco shouts. “No. No way.” He blinks at Potter. “Impossible.”
But not long after he’d sent out his last application, an owl arrived from the Board of Directors at St Mungo’s asking him to fill the vacancy of Healer-in-Charge of the Trauma Ward.
As Malfoy prattled on about the apprehension of the Pentacle Pirates off the coast of the Isle of Skye, Harry couldn’t help but map out the long, dark lashes around his prideful eyes, how they touched and lingered on the fine skin underneath, stark and pale by comparison.
” Blaise said from the doorway. “What is taking you two so long?”
Blaise pops in front of Draco’s face. “Well, feel relaxed?”
“Take care, Harry.” She laughed, “You two stay safe. Watch out for Wrackspurts.”
The following morning he wakes up to an owl carrying Harry Potter’s response.
for interviews.” He stopped and let out a long sigh. “It’s been a nightmare. Half of my staff were being questioned most of the day.” Blaise eyed him and smiled. “Say, you look quite fit. You have a date or something?”
“Orion is a fool,” Draco shakes his head. “He refuses to see things from Phaeden’s point of view. It’s his undoing.”
“Alright.”
“Of course he did, right after I cast a Magnifying Charm on the rear.”
Finnigan downs the rest of his beer. “Well, what?”
“Why on earth would you?” Draco asks, mind focusing back to their earlier conversation. Potter and Ginevra weren’t together anymore.
“Is that what you
The other man popped his head through the doorway. “Yes?”
“Draco,” Longbottom finds him in the living room near the fireplace.
“It isn’t that,” another board member chimed in. “It’s...well... you’re working
“Is that how you see me? Just as the Head Auror?” Harry sighed.
“The sofa,” Draco points. He casts an
“Are you not familiar with it?” she asks.
“Open the box, Draco.”
“This was the book where I realised they were more than friends,” Potter explains.
Draco choked on his breath. “Excuse me?”
“I am not,” Draco replied.
