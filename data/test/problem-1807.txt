“What if I see her in him?” The pale blonde man choked, the question coming from the place of all his fears, each bit grasping on to any excuse to rob him of hope.
“I’ll get us some substitutes to use when we’re out. How good is your broom work?”
Harry gave him a warm look anyways. He wasn’t fooling anyone, but it wasn’t his feelings that Harry could read, rather it was his nature. Harry wasn’t expecting anything, he just saw what Draco was and liked it. The same feelings that had overcome Draco the first time he’d met the boy and every time after continued to chew at his insides.
“That’s no way to duel, you have to bow and stand in front of your opponent. You’re being very rude!”
“Then maybe it should end!” But he didn’t mean the world.
They made their way to the horseless buggies, an hour later it was dark out with lanterns lighting their way up to the huge front doors of an old Scottish castle. They had passed a defensible ravine with one aged wooden bridge to get there and Harry could now see the castle they approached was located on a sloping cliffside leading to a huge lake and dense forest cresting the territory. The lake was dotted by orange lanterns making their way closer till he could make out the nearest boat. He followed his friends inside and one of the teachers told him to leave his things here and to wait for the first years in the open entryway.
“We shot out of a tiny ass stove to get here. Put the charm on now please.”
“Portkey it is then.” Draco nodded.
Sirius had long since run off in his dog form at Tom’s order. The mandrakes had let him slip thankfully, and once he got back to tell Remus and the others precisely what was happening, they would have back up. What he couldn’t have known was how confused and lost Sirius would become when faced with a half dozen scent trails dragged through the underbrush in every direction.
“Of course, Dear, but no distractions.” She said as she reached out and closed the Wardrobe. “I know Bella is incredibly wonderful, but you’ll get to spend time with her in person in no time, I promise.”
“It’s too early for you to be making me cry again today.” Sirius whined.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry.” Albus smiled with a twinkle in his eye that was now unmistakable. “I was told you did something rather dangerous and that more detention may be in order.” He teased as he let the two boys soak in the new body he presented. Oh, this was going to be fun, he thought as he imagined all the ways he would play with the staff and students when they got back.
“Nagini, where have you been?” Harry bent over as the snake uncoiled to slither up to him. She gestured to a hole in the wall with her head. “Any rats in there?” He watched her tongue dart out a couple times, he thought she looked quite pleased with herself.
“Oh, you’re older than me then.” Harry ducked his head.
Harry smiled into the pillow for the first time in years. Draco Malfoy. He replayed the memory till he fell asleep with the ray of hope and comfort it gave him.
As it was, he called the others and similar sentiments were passed around as Pomona took her lead of the group. Confident in her abilities to take on the Hufflepuff traps that laid ahead.
“You as well.” She nodded at him and he looked at her in confusion, she rolled her eyes. “You stay and sleep too. Mental health is still health.”
“I’d tell you if I could.” He said, putting a shield up in front of him and his two wards.
“Hitler said stuff like that too. It all comes down to who you choose to be. Are you someone looking for a leader to give you permission to hurt others or do you really think you’re better? The latter I can forgive for hurting me if you apologize. The other is the kind that doesn’t stop until one or both of you are dead.”
“Well at least it kept the blood where it was supposed to be, but—”
“Those against.”
Gregory whooped, and Vincent clapped Draco on the back in congratulations. They were out, and the group descended into tactical formation as they rounded a few stores to pinch their spoils. It wasn’t long before Draco’s two oldest friends were splayed out and totally buggered. They’d probably throw up using the portkey on the way back.
“Prick.” He laughed before falling back into place. “I just don’t know what to say.”
“As a case worker my job is to protect vulnerable youths from abusive situations. That means you Dolores.” Tom sounded from somewhere behind her and she spun around to see a part of the task force and Tom striding towards her.
“You just walked over and made me your business. It took you one short conversation- “Harry launches forward.
“Dad, I don’t think that’s going to work the way you think it will.”
Also I'm not sure what to do about the ghosts... I might just leave them out so I don't have to apply real life ghost theory to this because I am not doing fake stuff for that. If it becomes relevant or needed then it does. Cho Chang might also have to take a back seat so the characters I already have can stay in the spotlight and develop. I want to use her in something where she can be important though.
She quirked her brow. “Don’t seem too sure of yourself there.”
Special thanks to the people who gave hearts for my first chapter and the bookmarks that tell me people are waiting for updates. It's a completely mortifying and reassuring feeling to know someone wants what I'm posting. Thank you so much.
Draco felt the sting of his muscles being stretched apart, the heated massage of foreign objects wriggling around inside him and the way they moved of their own accord regardless of how his body reacted. The more he took in the more amazing the feeling became simply because it brought with it more sensation, more unexpected touches. Draco was holding the base of his cock to keep from coming so soon, despite the continuous need and motivation to let go. The constant ramming of those fingers up into his prostate was disorienting and his head was quickly filled with a fuzzy high that demanded more, faster, harder.
“No! Harry, it’s me, my fault!” The blonde ducked his head away as he protested.
Harry was going through his bag one last time as he talked to Draco. “So, where do we floo from to get to the beach?” He chirped as he rearranged everything into a better position, scoops and vials rolling around together.
“My name is Harry miss, I’m your grandson starting today.” He stated plainly in the polite tone the Dursley’s always demanded.
“Oh, prove it. You can’t. You’re going to die just like every other muggle my sister kills because you aren’t special. You. Aren’t. Spe—”
“Don’t let them use it…” A voice came from somewhere behind his head.
“Be my school partner?” Harry suddenly asked Draco, catching him off guard, how appropriate. He hadn’t asked anyone yet, this felt like the chance.
Afraid the sounds would pass through his pockets if he tried to just take the bottle, he first filled the empty space of the box with a few handkerchiefs for cushioning and then grabbed the whole thing. The wisp was now pulling back to the door and he was both relieved and terrified to go back out.
Tom threw his hands up in surrender as true fear shot through him. “I’m the one you want, don’t hurt hi—”
“I just wanted to do something like a—co—couple or whatever we want to call this. I know we haven’t really talked about it since the beach, but it was implied. I would like to just be with you without other people watching.” Harry’s cheeks tinted pink as he fumbled over what he’d practiced in his head.
“He’s just a little worried about everyone. Can you tell?” Harry whispered to Draco.
Harry was puffy eyed and carrying his old bag that Molly had taken liberty to restitch with some colorful thread in all the places it was falling apart. He had told her it was fine but she had packed a full meal in there for whenever he wanted it while he was stuck at the ministry. To be honest he had forgotten, he wasn’t used to just having food with him and had been too nervous to feel hungry so the bag felt just a bit heavy as he toted it into the Black house.
As it turned out, he did get rather far.
“I’d prefer if you had a reason.” Harry buried his chin down into his clavicle with a frown.
“Your trying to play this off like it’s not a big deal. Thank you.” He watched the blonde next to him till it was clear he was receded into a shell. He shifted back to his spot to read more as he let his study partner sort themselves out in peace. Sometimes big things just happened in little ways. Harry could understand that.
Tom made his way to Minister Fudge who had been debating furiously with other branch heads about what needed to be done. They all turned to welcome Riddle into the circle as they took his report.
Accounts of a twisted somewhat neglectful retelling of their ordeal over the past month or so, devoid of news about Tom’s soul at least. That would have been bad. The implication that Lucius was crazy, that Narcissa was the real mastermind behind Bellatrix and a slightly insulting anecdote about Harry and Draco and their scandalous relationship. He’d count it as a win that there actually was a relationship this time. A call for Rudolphus Lestrange to be retired and committed. It was all a problem for the ministry to worry about, he just hoped they did the right thing for everyone caught in this.
“…Yes, I know Draco Malfoy. He said his relatives would adopt me.” Harry gasped out as he tried to steady his breathing,” Do you know their names? What are they like?” He replied even while he continued to stare out, entranced, Roody supposed he might be in shock.
___________________________________________
Over their entanglement the previous day Harry had come to a realization with Draco. He liked being in control. Draco liked being vulnerable for once and Harry liked taking the lead and it was starting to show in more than just how he’d been the one to confess or other little things he looked back on now and noticed. He hadn’t had a say in anything up until Draco and it was a kind of power high, he found himself pursuing now as he pushed the blonde down onto his bed. The need to claim what was his so he would never lose it again. That need itself was his own display of vulnerability, more so than crying or pleading, this was a private exploration no one else would see because he had to consciously allow it to show and be received.
“Muggles are non-magical humans. I can’t believe no one’s told you that.”
“After Detention.” Draco smiled as they walked back out into the school corridors to go their separate ways. Sleep came easy once they slipped into their beds.
“It’s still better than how it was.” Severus added in consolation.
“Myself and Mr. Riddle will be taking point in front, be ready to shield any unexpected dangers.” He nodded back to Tom. He’d done this before if not a hundred times in his long life, he knew how to do it well and no one would be hurt on his watch.
Time for me to pick a new project to start posting next. It's been fun and my word document has totaled 237 pages now. I believe I've tied up everything, but there is kind of an obvious energy to me at least that it could be continued in a second book for the series if I ever revisit this.
“Mr. Lupin,” Tom nodded, “It seems the other boot has dropped as it were. I came here today to discuss how we may solve it.”
“What leads, Tom?”
In truth he had a good reason, Draco had once seen one of his seniors have a series of horrible nightmares after breaking up with his girlfriend who had apparently seen fit to curse him for it. They only found out when the boy had been sent to Pomphrey from lack of sleep after passing out during a test. Harry was an anomaly in the wizarding world, a target, and so many people that had more ties to this place had been subject to yet worse fates than Harry had the day he’d fought Bellatrix. Perhaps it was because he had yet to face the punishment for his crimes against his family, against his father that he would so easily contemplate something like this happening to Harry. Until he knew where his life stood now, he had to worry.
He had felt hurt that day, betrayed by his lover’s words and the knowledge that he would be barred from following him into death eventually. There had been a time he had been terrified of death, but after having Albus his fear shifted to something contingent on staying with him no matter where that lead.
“What can Kreacher do for you sirs?” He grouched respectably as he looked over the new elf.
It hurt to think it had been his fault that all this had happened no matter how many times Albus had told him he was forgiven. The damage was done and could never heal if he didn’t manage to find it. A strong ache in his chest like the start of a heart attack began and he fumbled for his coats pocket to pull free a slim flask he downed with effort. The tang and cool easing the liquid down his throat, the closest thing to wine as he could hope for at the moment.
Nothing was ever that simple though was it? Harry had been looking up and down, asking Sirius if he could find her trail with no success. It was like she… was invisible.
“I’ll take that as a yes. You’re crushing me, and food also. Food is good, let’s get—” Ron fought to drag Harry along as He refused to let go, he knew it was childish. He knew he was overreacting, causing trouble, but he couldn’t let go. Never wanted to let go.
She was fluttering from branch to branch in a random direction when she saw the crux of her reason for being there. Harry Potter Black. The teen leaping over what he no doubt couldn’t see were resting and rooted plants like the one chasing him closely behind.
“We’re too old to be dancing around anymore.” Severus grumped, “I’ll have you if you let me. So be with me you impossible brat of a man and let me love you.” Severus bowed over, resting his head against the bed sheets.
Fully seated Harry struggled to brace himself so he wouldn’t fall atop Draco and began to rock himself, not enough to move, but enough to grind as he waited for Draco to gain his sense. It was an unreal scene; he took the time he could to look down at the confident and strong blonde stranger that had not so long ago simply walked into his life. That thought was always enough to make him infinitely happy. Now he got to think about it while they made love. Made love! Not so long ago he had been crying for a boy that hated him and now he had someone who genuinely cared, who picked him as much as Harry had him. It was difficult to comprehend all the time, being wanted, but the sight before him, the feeling, was undeniable proof.
“If there is it’s not good for you. Augmented or enhanced body alterations are illegal no matter the method these days ever since the incidents of the second world war. Some do it anyways and get a few strikes on their records, but some of the damage they cause to themselves is punishment enough. I’ve known several people that have done it and they all have their good and bad thoughts on it. Regardless I doubt you’d want to end up like Mad Eye Moody.” He emphasized the name to make his point. Ya, Harry didn’t want to be Mad Eye Harry in this life… or ever.
“What do you mean?”
Their faces lit up back, brighter with every word. They were going to sneak out and party like gods. Then Pansy sobered up.
He had no way of knowing how he’d saved Harry from the lie he would have been unable to tell. Peace was returned and they snapped right back into their own encased world.
The cold snow was shocking to Harry’s back and he felt the small dot of a flame float over to rest on him as he struggled to worm his way to the box and grab it with his fingers before wrestling his other hand into his pocket to grab the portkey.
“Well, hey there wall flower.” Harry joked as he leaned against a stump.
“We ask Arthur Weasley to the stand for his account.”
I have edited this chapter with this weeks update to be a more acceptable length, we will have the first half of the The Four now and the next chapter will be the other two.
No, he couldn’t let them see him like this, he thought as he ran out into the hallway. There was already a very good reason to justify him being upset if he couldn’t hold it in. With a drag of the curtain he revealed Walburga in all her plump, angry glory. The shouting so familiar it almost had a calming effect.
“Shut up!” Hermione shouts over them and the entire entrance of the school stills. “We are going to Hogsmeade together as a group and you will act appropriately and get along and we are going to have a good time or I swear I will be the one to finally set fire to one of you!” She stomps past them and down the steps. Blaze whistles and follows after with a smile on his face.
“We have to get out of here. We can go and get Tom, he was looking for the right place and this has to be it, he’ll take care of it.” Harry looked into the wisp’s swirling form. “I know I should have gone back; I know I promised to be better about it. I just, I don’t know what I was thinking. With the dreams, and the classes, and the way I won last time… I guess I got a bit fool headed. Thought I could do it again, ya know?” This wasn’t good, now he was just making himself cry while a war criminal hunted him.
“Says he’ll be back soon and not to worry.” Remus sounded exasperated.
“My youth. She stole my youth some years ago in vengeance. She had intended for me to die alone like that, but was burned for much the same reason when that did not happen.” Albus reached over for Tom’s hand and held it meaningfully, his smile the same gentle swoop.
“Yes! Please I want a family, a real one! Please mister Rodolfus.” Harry nearly fell apart.
“This is not a matter for a magical ministry, the boy is in the muggle’s domain and holds no wizards’ rights. Therefore, I cannot file to have him removed.” The minister scoffed back.
“But what do we do?” Sirius looked so lost.
The pain was turning numb now, he knew the feeling and that part of him that had survived for years alone kicked in as he kept his screaming high and miserable for his attacker. Caught between buying time and inching forward to what was the only object he could put between himself and her Harry looked up at the stone and gasped. Was that a fucking sword?
Hill was focused on Hagrid but as the brush began to untangle his back the dog whipped around to lull a tongue out of his maw and watch what Draco was doing. After a few strokes the brush was ineffectively stuffed with hair and Hill whined for his meat.
“Are you calling me a Dodo or something? Because if so, you’re definitely a cockatoo with that hair and puffed up attitude.”
I want to make a little note to thank everyone who's been commenting, I read all of them and it makes me happy to know that you liked what I posted.
“Kreacher found every missing sock and pen Sirius lost in the last two decades when he came home after they finally started getting along.” Harry laughed openly.
Harry barked a laugh, “What kind of tree did you get?” He shakes his head and lets Draco pull him towards the stairs.
“Proof.” He said meaningfully. “Proof that there is yet another child in need of us my friend.” Tom reached down to pet her head as Nagini found his lap.
“He was trying to find Draco. You know why, said “He ran out on Narcissa” or some such. I’d been under the impression he was having a difficult time with Lucius and honestly it sounded like an excuse to interrogate me. If he hadn’t been looking so much like the old him, I might have hexed him for it. I don’t know why he’s become like this, but it will always be a personal disappointment. Professor—”
“—The case is ruled as abuse of a minor—” The Minister began to announce the findings over some last-ditch argument Vernon and Petunia were screeching about, but a silencing spell cut them off quickly. “Thank you. Both Guardians present are in violation of the statuettes outlined previously. They will be charged for 15 years of abuse, neglect, endangerment, and several counts of assault to a child age 1-15. Vernon Dursley and Petunia Dursley will be returned to the muggle courts to be sentenced immediately for a minimum of 30 or more years with fines at sed courts discretion. The matter of Dudley Dursley will be held then with the mandate that he be sent to a reform school and evaluated. This court is to break for one hour.” The minister sat with a thud.
“I shouldn’t.” Draco whispers to himself, sounding a bit like Harry had just before. “I really shouldn’t. Father will be so mad. He might really be mad.” He muttered and he draped his chest over his muggles back as he drew him into his arms to hold from behind. “I’m not supposed to do this.”
__________
“It’s a shame you’re not a wizard, boy. You would have had such potential. A waste in a simple muggle.” He huffed out, taking a lung full of air from his sprinting through the entirety of Nurmengard. “Now then.” He pointed the end of his wand at Harry’s face, an almost blank look overtaking his features.
“-you-you What? Want to go down on me? Dudley what should I do with a freak like this?” Piers asked an insane glint to his eye.
“Slytherin’s don’t get themselves killed over stupid things.” Draco scoffed.
“Hold on,” Draco interrupted, “What do you mean it opened. Do you mean when we went through it together or did something happen when I left?”
The sound of everyone clambering down added to a sense of claustrophobia as they attempted to stay close despite the stairs thinning them into a tight line ahead. It let out soon enough to an open chamber, the room only holding an adjacent door and not much else. The thin opening into the room meant people trickled in one at a time now and with caution. Harry felt the danger of it as soon as he’d passed through, there was too many of them to get back through quickly if something went wrong. Something was obviously going to go wrong.
“And how do you suppose we get it?” Vincent looked at Zabini like he was a saint, he wanted it and he knew Zabini was smart. At least smarter than him, which wasn’t too hard.
“I like your voice.” He muttered back like it explained everything.
“Um, I’ll rip out your tongue first?” he said and devolved into an unsure pitch, grimacing as he waited those few seconds before Sirius started to choke on his laughter. The boy sighed visibly and Sirius noticed. He stepped over and pulled him into his arms.
“You don’t have to. Him or me. We’ll make it through this together, I promise. It’s not that I waited or didn’t, I never wanted anyone else either. I say this as Draco’s Godfather, bless Narcissa for that one thing at least, he wants you to accept him as much as you must have when you told your father.” He held Lucius’ chin firmly and guided him to look in his eyes unerring, “But this is where you start being different because you are. You can be. Because unlike him you want to be there.”
Draco urged Harry on to go see the man while he stayed in Snapes office room. He sat back down at a signal from the man and prepared himself. Severus had never been the kind to let things go, even with a father figure like Dumbledore taking him years ago. Softening his edges was more like putting rubber guards over deadly spikes.
“Not at all, but I can see basic shapes and colors so I’m at least not blind.”
Harry didn’t know what to think. Still, what else was he supposed to do as he stared into the very serious gaze of the man that was supposed to give him a new life. He sighed inwardly and taking his hand made a show of taking a deep gulp of air. The last thing he understood was the gentle chuckle from Roody before the world seemed to end. He felt like he was thrown into a punch, familiar enough that he didn’t stumble too much upon reentry.
“I can’t let it happen again.” He wailed to his love who cried silently as he listened in horror. “I can’t let them do this to us again. We have to stop them Albus.”
“No, wait!” Harry was pushing him away despite the confused look he got. Then he felt Sirius pulled away bodily, the older man gasping at the sudden attack.
Draco locked his door and collapsed in bed as the tingling of his earlier encounter made his body heat up, now unbidden by his surroundings. Hands worked their way under his weight to grab at himself and he thrust into the friction in frustration. His member was hard instantly and he let his mind wander back to the mirror.
“History and honor, I guess. Either way, too many people still believed in him for the others to just erase him without consequence. Like I said it was a war. To this day Slytherins are one of the most competitive and successful people you can think of out there. He may be controversial, but he knew what he was doing making our house.”
He was pulled from his stare by the body carried by, Harry was faced away from him, but he could see Draco talking with him gently. He had made the blonde promise to give back the wands Harry was still carrying once they were out of the room safely. It seemed like that one never stopped worrying.
Draco looked dumbstruck as Harry turned and started to run away. He heard the blonde suddenly call out in alarm and chase after him as the laughing started up again. The harsh and frank way of Moody teaching had intimidated a lot of kids away from stepping up to try for fear of embarrassment, but Harry was changing that. Sometimes it just took one person doing something.
They were locked there unmoving as the shape of a few more bodies dropped down into the lake one after another, someone yelling down about brooms. Narcissa had wanted to struggle as the Aurors took her cloak and wand, her thin body not putting up much of a fight though. Harry slowly slumped down on the Cornerstone, using the sword as a crutch while he curled up and let the ache of his body pulse along his flesh with the adrenaline ebbing away faster than he would have liked.
“Yes, he’s getting help too. Now rest and I’ll go check on him for you.” Draco pressed his chest down till he relaxed back into the sheets. “Everyone is going to be alright Harry, you’re not going to lose us.”
“Harry Dearest! Sorry to be dropping by so sudden, but I’ve just remembered what it was I need to ask of you. It is rather time sensitive as it so happens so I’ve come as soon as I could to let you know.” She sang pleasantly. “I do hope you’re end of the trade worked out by the way.” Her question heavily implied.
Harry gasped as the foreign sensation poked and smoothed over his sides as Draco found his place, shuffling the sweaters place off his buckle to rake at his upper thighs. He delved into Draco’s pants, the head of his penis rubbing against his palm and wrist as he worked down to get a full grip before he could lose focus. A startled sound met his ear as a reward for the bold move and he began to explore the flesh throbbing in his grasp. Draco was slightly hurried now as he tore open his buckle and reached in to mirror Harry.
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I didn’t know—” Draco choked, “I just thought I was the only one that could, and you thought I was. I saw it—it was there! I couldn’t get it and then I—She—I couldn’t stay anymore!”
“Come sit, I’m told you two have been too curious for your own good. It sounds like you just need to be told how it is in order to prevent future accidents.” Albus waved to the table for everyone to sit.
The far-off sound of screams and implosions set off by dark magic filled his ears. It was always there; He’d met Bellatrix and then some for his father. She was too unstable, too important, not to pander to, but neither of them had really wanted to leave him with her. He needed a good dark arts teacher though and she was it. He’d managed to push that fact so far to the back of his mind sometimes it was even easy to act the part of the spoiled brat and even believe it himself.
“As well you should be. Now off you go and be quiet.” Vernon nodded to himself seeming sated for now.
The wisp bounced gently in his hands, its little blue light had dimmed in its own fears and now the firefly like glow had turned down to a smoldering ember. His question made Its light flicker, but whatever it was trying to convey was lost in translation.
The gang laughed and snickered and then the thought set in. The stupid oafs took almost a solid minute to really put their own words together. Harry gulped down his tongue, the lack of denial didn’t help but saying no would make it a game for them. Harry was trying to play dead now, let them get it out of their systems till they walked away eventually.
They were at Diagon Alley in the blink of an eye and walking down the gray streets, pops of magical glow and fresh or faded paint brightened the glum lighting of the day. It was going to start raining soon. Clicking of heels and boots alike surrounded them. Some turned to stare at the group, whispers just a bit too far for them to hear. An undercurrent of tension was there, but no one dared to open the lid to what was underneath yet. Draco and Sirius positioned themselves on either side of Harry in defense and the boy obliviously soaked in the close contact of two of his favorite people.
He forced his body to sit up and when he looked again, he saw the wisp floating off gently with the wind that carried countless snowflakes. He smiled at the sight and the others turned their gaze to see what he did, looking back with more questions in their eyes. He took the portkey and dropped it in front of the kneeling men. With that out of his way he reached over to grab the box with both hands and open it to Tom. He watched the lights dancing out of the crack of the lid widen and play along the man’s features as he looked on in disbelief. The echoing of laughter filled the air and encouraged Harry to smile in victory.
Draco Malfoy, heir of the renowned pure blood line and son of Lucius Malfoy. His father, a prominent political figure and master of dark Magic’s. Raised as the son of a death eater, those that sought dominion over all others for their superior magic and lineage, Draco had expectations to meet. More than that, he wanted to.
“Together?” He asked Dobby. The shorter being shifted a bit closer to him at the word and he reached his free hand out to open the door. It opened with a jiggle, the scraping of the wood as the two doors separated made Draco cringe.
“That sounds lonely.” Harry rested his hand on the cell door, slipping his fingers over the edge of the peephole to get a hold of it.
The boys beside him moaned their disapproval. Harry was still debating whether it was really okay for him to come over now when Someone pushed past him in the walkway.
Harry was bringing up one of the strings of beads to look at it properly, “I don’t know if this is the right kind of place.” He joked.
“We are lucky this PR blast has only been a positive scandal and not more incriminating. I don’t know what possessed you to put yourself at risk like that! She could have killed you too! What have I always said? Repeat it back to me!” Lucius’ voice was almost manic as he continued to yell. “Malfoys curam nostrum! Nos Temperari castitate!”
“Can we get a few more containers of packets?” Hermione asked the others as she took stock of the sugar packets on their table.
The streetlight like flowers working to make him conflicted between wonder and a renewed wave of nerves. This was exactly what Draco didn’t want him to do, but it was what felt right. This was where he needed to be.
“How much did you hear?” He forced out.
Cobble stone, Harry had seen so much of it lately, it was everywhere simply lining every road and street in the wizarding world like a never ending and series rivers. Hogwarts was much the same, just a different kind. If the roads one walked were like rivers and babbling brooks of rounded stones then Hogwarts was like an ocean. It stretched out everywhere curling around a corner only to spread out further into more expanse. The Dungeon did nothing to curb this trend and the walk down that had started so nervously led into an hour of frankly boring walking.
So if it wasn't clear we have a Tom/Albus ship going on in here that has it's own story going on I'm hoping to make the catalyst of the big final arc of our story and this is me trying to drop the hints before you're just thrown suddenly into a wall of new information. I'm hoping that this makes it a little more organic and creates some anticipation for all the things this could mean. I had to keep rewriting a timeline up in my notes to make sense out of how old everyone was and how much original canon I wanted to build off of as a base. I think it's turning out okay, but any feedback is always appreciated, I like to know how everyone is feeling. Love you all so much and thank you for reading.
“Nothing says we can’t protect him, just that we can’t stop him.” Albus smiled warmly with the best look of reassurance he could muster.
How was anyone, especially Harry supposed to know about smuggler portkeys? Well, when a wisp tugs you to an underpass and a trash pile you don’t bother trying to ask the seemingly mute creature. Harry was digging through some loose bricks and cigarettes when his hand touched the old coat pin and his world shifted, he had only meant to bring it up to his face to get a look and now he was knee deep in snow, and considering he’d been on his knees his situation at present was not ideal.
“You’re going to be okay; we’ll get you up to the nurse’s with the others in no time. Just stay awake with me, can you do that?”
Harry allowed himself to be manhandled by two of the younger students that were nervous and needed to hold hands as they marched into the hall. Their little hands tightened on his fingers as they all took in the beautiful sight of floating candles and a starry night sky painted along the ceiling. Recognition flickered in Harry’s eyes as he watched falling stars streak across the stone arches and other masonry details as if they weren’t there. Magic portrait? Did that count?
Gentle fingers explored the folds of Draco’s anus, rubbing along the outside and dipping into the center to tease as he pushed down into the others pelvis with his own, their cocks wetting together.
“Pollination it is then.” Harry proclaimed before tip toeing through the throng of mandrake bodies till he was as close to the flower’s spine as he could without displacing the petals.
“I shouldn’t.” He seemed to repeat the words they had at the beach and cut himself off.
“Please, please stop.” He whispered in terror.
“You are going to give someone a heart attack, you know that? You’ll come out of this with welts like you were assaulted by a paint gun but other than that it looks like you have no other injuries. Don’t take this as a reason to go looking for trouble and getting hurt though, you’re still not invincible.” She snapped in her own caring way and went to grab some ointment to apply to the boy’s back.
“Please be a good thing.” He uttered under his breath in the omen’s direction before rushing to catch up with Dobby.
“Mr. Potter.” A voice called from the closest accountant’s table. He looked up to see a man growing steadily impatient. He was stout with a hooked nose and pointed ears adorned with gold cuffs that caught the eye. The Bank’s open hall plan allowed Harry to look out at the others writing furiously at their work places and noted the uniformly well kempt attire. These were Goblins, despite their sharp teeth and sharper countenance it was reassuring to see they were just like anyone else Harry would ever talk to.
“Think a sock will do?” He handed over one to Tom.
“And what do all these things mean to you?”
“I know it, but I can’t remember where I’ve seen it.” He muttered.
No, His Father was many things including a danger, but not to him. He was just scared for when Lucius would get mad at his disobeying the warning he’d been given before school. The memory playing back.
The member smeared against Draco’s stomach again, literally weeping for attention Harry fought not to give as he felt himself seize up painfully with his own arousal. Soon he’d thrown off his own pants and pressed back down into warm flesh, the wet of their cocks mixing and coating their aching need. Harry fumbled for the glass bottle they’d gotten for tonight and found himself losing more of the liquid than he caught as he poured it from an odd angle. Draco forced him up to do it and looked over at the wet puddle on the bed next to them.
“You weren’t given that chance. He still loved you for a long time, he could love the real you.” Severus’ hand looked like it was inching forward to take his despite his hesitation.
“What is the meaning of this?” She screamed as he disarmed her and cast a binding quickly on her wrists.
Someone must have gone ahead because the air changed, but Harry couldn’t see past the others to tell what the sudden yells of alarm meant. It wasn’t left to his wondering for long as a set of ungodly tall stone soldiers unfolded from their hiding places in the walls to stand above the group of trespassers. They must have been golems, the rough cut of their features tried to look like armor and they walked forwards to them without hesitation.
By the time Ms. Evette stepped away both her and Lucius looked visibly sweaty and exhausted from the ordeal.
Remus had excused himself and returned with a tray of tea shortly after. The glint of a flask caught Harry’s eye as Tom took a drag of its contents and stowed it back in his coat, a tongue darting out to pull in the stray drop of purple liquid. Alcohol?
“And I like him, ya.” Harry bent over to plant a kiss on Sirius’s head before finally finding the strength to turn away and face Draco.
4 Privet Drive, Surrey
“Because it would mean losing that which I am, all that I have left is this body and soul. I must keep it as it is, so that when the next prophesies come, I will be able. I will not die here, when Albus comes back he will help me reforge the stone. That is what must be. She made sure of that.”  He steepled his fingers together.
“Get the boy back, here he comes.”
Draco is finally here, and we get some development from everyone. I'm so happy I got to write a fight scene that actually makes at least a little sense. I was worried it wouldn't be good, but I had fun making it. We've hit 20,000 words now and I'm really proud, I really want this to be novel length. Thank you again for reading, every time you do it gives this work a purpose. *Hugs*
“Now let us discuss exactly how that was not done today and apparently before that. First, we are legally obligated to rescind both your Hogsmeade visits till you are punished properly as seen by the head master, because leaving the area means that we cannot be responsible for your wellbeing. This is a huge violation of the school rules and can lead to any length of severe penalties. Secondly, you are lucky Filch found you. Do you know why?”
“What was that Harry?” He knew that controlled warbling tone, Remus.
“My boy.” Sirius was shifting back and Harry could only focus on the sudden rustle of life around them.
“At least a month maybe longer. Any memories needed for the case we can send you in place of him standing trial for now, but—"
“How much time left?” Remus leaned forward, elbows on his knees where he sat across from his friend.
“I’m sitting.” Harry breathed a laugh, the tiny sound barley making it to the blonde’s ear.
The water was so loud in his ears as his hands slapped down into it with force and the sounds behind him refused to stop. He was gasping as he hit the first bit of ground to the small teardrop of land they had raced to. He felt his feet hit the shallows hard and he moved with difficulty to keep his speed.
“Sometimes I really hate you.” Draco deadpanned as he continued to fuss over him.
Harry was already an unstable emotional ball of energy before this. He’d been hyperaware of everything since leaving the Dursley’s and now it was finding an outlet. Not a good one to be sure, as he started to panic.
He sent for an Auror on his taskforce to collect this one, Tom still had a scent to track. It was faint and disappearing with the wind but if he just got his broom out—
“Maybe it is. So many things could happen if it does, not all of them good or unexpected.” Draco was looking somewhere in his own mind as he spoke.
“Hello, maim. My names Harry.” He called out as he walked further in. The scuttling sounds guiding him.
Roody came up with a small bag.” How ‘bout we grab as much up as it wants and we can come back through to feed the new greenhouse plants on the way out. Once ‘Mona wakes up she’ll want to get a chance to anyways.”
“Gee I wonder why.” He laughed. “Maybe we could make little houses for them. Do they already have houses? How cute are their houses? Ron!” Harry urged as they stretched back onto their feet.
“My business is love Dear; you saved a pair in love with the favor you asked for. It brings me purpose to do what I can to guide people to each other,” She leaned in to whisper, “Or did you think he only heard you cry because you were loud.” She conspired.
Hermione went back to reading with a small serene smile on her lips. That had been the first time a bully had ever been nice to her and it had been real, she could tell. That was enough for now. It gave her a very good feeling about this year.
Time for a date
“Give up.” Were his final words as he readied for the next swing.
“I’m Auror Milton and this is Auror Rodolfus.”
Around the bend he was led up to the face of a cliffside, an entrance carved into the rock. Wind beat at his face and snowflakes clung to his hair and glasses, specks that tried to obscure his vision. He reached out to touch the door and it didn’t move, frosted over at the seams. He pushed a bit harder; it still didn’t budge. Leaning into the stone door the wind hitting his back he fought to dig his feet in and push as best as he could.
Draco stopped altogether as he turned to look at his companion. “I don’t think I’ve ever thought about that.”
“I’m too old for that!” he whined as he bolted up the stairs to his room for the night. He paused at his door for a moment, “Good night everyone.” He yelled and resounding yells answered from behind closed doors. Molly just yelled back and giggled to herself as she shook her head in exasperation.
I hope this is a good reward for everyone for making it to Monday again this week. Everyone please stay safe, wear masks and when you go to meet relatives I recommend keeping them on if they aren't in your bubble because you can't be sure who they've come in contact with as well as preventing giving them anything in turn. If you love someone be careful even when it makes you look silly or makes them mad because you can be one of the reasons they won't potentially die. I think everyone took some kind of a hit because of thanksgiving and Christmas is not the time to risk the people you want to celebrate being with. Thank you and I hope you're all happy and healthy wherever you are.
“I was just dreaming.” He whispered under his breath to the blonde.
“I hope you come to Hogwarts with me next semester.” Draco murmured into the quiet room, it sounded so much louder than he’d meant.
__________
“I hope your right about this.”
___________________________________________
“Um, yes?” He choked back.
“Good.”
Nagini flopped herself down onto the path, a black line in the dark that waved back and forth as she made her way forward. Her tongue darting out as she tasted her surroundings. Harry held out the book and a torch to light up his path as he tried to follow it like a treasure map. The further they got from the main road, the more trees blocked out the moonlight and blinded the muggle as he squinted to find the markers he needed.
“Then he will be protected by her till we can locate him. Did he have anywhere else he’d have gone besides after you? You mentioned dreams, were they abnormal?” Tom slipped seamlessly into his usual role.
“What’s wrong with him?” one frantic voice asked, it was probably Sirius.
“Then we can just tell them we’ll act like the past doesn’t exist for a while and deal with it when you want to. That way we can just have fun and you can see if you like them at all now that you’re all older?”
“We’ll of course have to frame one of the wanted posters that they’ll put out for you.” Harry joked with a sigh of relief.
The two presented papers and while Draco demonstrated spells or potions for evaluation Harry was there every step of the way to either explain the steps thoroughly to show understanding or using Draco’s help to show his own application of how they could use the material assigned. They had both worked themselves a bit hard on the enchantments and runes course especially when they got on a roll, Hermione encouraging them into a dedicated frenzy. Now they had a fully enchanted chess set like what you could borrow in the recreation area outside the library. Little transfigured wood sculptures made to look like Hogwarts students charmed to duel when you took a piece on the grid. Harry had inscribed runes in every piece Draco made and they had stuffed the hollow bottoms with Fred and George’s crackle pop blasters when they would ultimately blow each other up during the game.
“You are not going to the manor. Even if I do go, which I haven’t decided if I am or not yet, I am not taking you. I warned you about this Harry.”
“It means what it means Sirius! We have to get over there now, Harry baited a whole group of Death Eaters to Diagon Alley. They started attacking everyone to let Aunt Bella get past and the Aurors couldn’t stop them. Father told me when he came back, saying how he “did his part”. We don’t have time; the others are still out there!” Draco was rushing back into the floo.
__________
“That depends on who the other one is.” Draco said, the question clear.
“Not yet, perhaps if you earn my favor, I will make an appropriate ally in your campaign?”
I hope that I've been able to make something that all of you can enjoy and wanted from this fandom like I have. Thank you for reading the new chapter, I had a lot of fun writing it for you.
“Who do you see here? It looked like no one’s been here in a long time.” The man hummed to himself in agreement.
“Are you sure that you want to keep being around me if I say yes?” He countered.
“You’re in a good mood today.” Harry laughed as he thought, disregarding the stress of the others for now.
Returning to school he regaled the others of his finding, a stray muggle he’d toyed with and they laughed. He didn’t quite have words to describe Harry to them and he felt a need to keep what he did have to himself. No one had to know about the crying boy who’d looked at him with Star light in his eyes. That boy was Draco’s.
“Good that I thought of it then.” Draco said to himself.
The asphalt lit with periodical street lamps, a figure passing through them cast its shadow across the ground; with each step the shadow grew as it danced around the light sources, sudden sparts sprang from the bulbs and they turned dark. The figure seemed almost to eat the light as it went, a foreboding trail that lead up to none other than 4 Privet Drive.
“hmmm-no.” Draco mumbled as he was dragged to the edge of wakefulness.
Draco bit his lip as he grinned, after all the hell fire that it’d taken to get there, they were together, it was the holiday, they were safe, it was Christmas…
“She didn’t like you?” He questioned with a growing smile.
“Got your eyes.” She sang as he ducked behind a pillar.
He was sorting through the trunk Sirius had gotten him, packing the paper and quills, textbooks and uniforms into place to get ready for the train. He listened to the soft hoots of the owl sitting on an armchair behind him. The snow-white owl had come with the name Hedwig and it had been a bit older than the others, having been too picky over the other customers, but when Harry had walked in with Sirius to pick a familiar, she had flown over to perch on him as he was looking.
“We just got in trouble for going to the beach. Do you really want to see what happens if we get caught doing this?”
“I think that’s the nicest thing anyone’s ever said to me.”
“A support beam?” Remus tried next.
Spezi is a cola and orange soda mix I used to drink all the time as a kid when we lived in Germany for my dad's job in the army. We used to play uno and whenever we played real cards I never knew what I was doing and tried to win the sugar packets we used as chips so I could eat them. It's not considered polite to bring children to resturaunts because they can disturb other patrons and we'd get looks from everyone else until they realized me and my sister were well behaved and then they would be impressed and just compliment my parents about it.
Harry felt the clench and suck of muscle on his fingertip as he slid his index finger into the hole. Not one knuckle deep and the sheer force of heat and slippery inner walls like the inside of one’s mouth had him rolling his eyes back at the onslaught of feelings running through him. The hole tensed painfully tight and he looked down to see he’d slid his finger all the way in. A moment later he was thrusting in and out slowly, prodding his finger into the inner walls, observing the elastic way it fought back and squeezed him.
He heard something explode and suddenly felt far less sure about this. “I just cleaned that!” He yelled back at her. The Goblins watched in interest, a few taking bets and arguing that if Harry died, they wouldn’t have him to clean up after like he promised.
“Hey.” He called over softly and grey eyes flitted over to him and lit in acknowledgement. “What are we doing for holiday?”
“I never thought I’d love science so much.” Harry spoke as he straightened the scraps of paper out to start his chart up.
The underground forest stretched out for what could be miles for all they knew, the dungeons were as deep as the lake, but by this point they could have been under even that. Still, the cornerstone was to hold up the school so it had to be closer to the building itself and not as far away as the room suggested.
Tom took the time to sneak out and floo to the Black resident with a plan in mind. He came into the scene of Sirius and Lupin fighting in low tones and glancing furtively over to the table Harry sat at eating the breakfast they made him. He looked every bit as happy as Arthur had described when he was staying with him if not for the pinched brow that indicated he was trying to listen in.
“Are you insinuating making children spies for Auror work again Moody.” One of his teammates laughed.
“Yes Mother, I’ve missed you too.” His voice was wobbling and he could curse himself for it. He finally forced himself to look up at his mother who was looking at him with a troubled expression.
I keep trying to say something meaningful here and it turns into a whole essay, I want so badly to give you good notes!
“It’s okay. It’s okay. I’m not hurting you. It’s just a hug.”
So this took all day...
“Fides est in sanguinem.” His father started to lower his voice as he calmed. His tone falling into a drone like a teacher might speak.
“We are required to ask for your testimony in this hearing in order to take your Will into consideration when we deliberate. If there is anything you would like to state let it be known to the court now.”
It was around the time they were thinking of heading back Draco heard a howl- no not a howl. “What is that?” He turned to his two lucid companions who shrugged.
“You asked to be capable. To be as good as any wizard. This is war boy, has been for a long time. If you wish to be ready for it then you must do all you can. Are we in agreement?”
“Ravenclaw wouldn’t want people getting through by accident.” Tom nodded.
“I’d really like that.” Harry shook her offered hand before his mind wandered back to his previous conversation. “I’ll be back in a bit once I find him okay?” He asked Ron as he stood to leave.
“Should I be worried Harry isn’t with you?” Remus asked when all else failed.
“It—it’s pages flipped over to this one part—” He pulled the book out and cracked it open to the page. The article on deals with fae and the little address with directions written under one section.
“Good morning mister Potter, we are with the ministry. We are here today to inquire into your care by your guardians here.” One gestured with a sweep of his hand.
“I don’t think I want other people to be a part of this, I get why you don’t seek me out like that in front of them. I don’t know if I’d do it if it were only my choice. I’ve never really liked being on display. Past that, I can’t figure out what to do when we are alone. I’d be okay with more.” He sounded hopeful as he watched Draco take in this new information.
“I’m not mad you aren’t in my house. Honestly it’s like you think my life revolves around you.” Draco had to catch himself after saying that, it was embarrassing how true those words actually are.
“Mark my words boy, this is the start of another war. Soon the old ways will be at risk and people will have to make a choice. Malfoy’s are survivors and have stood above disaster and tragedy since before the witch burnings. I expect the same of you when the day comes. I know you will do us proud.”
“I would, but the wards in St. Mungo’s zapped me again.” Like a bug, she thought to herself. “I still can’t get into the ministry since the restraining order went though, publishing anything that confirms I went against that is instant jail time. Isn’t there someone on staff that can scout one out. I’m always the one doing it.” She groused.
“Don’t forget to tell them how manly you were when you beat me up for the rest of the ride.” Harry snorted as he pulled down his trunk and Hedwig who’d been sleeping quite peacefully since she’d been stowed. Harry saw the glint of recognition in Draco’s eyes once he finally noticed her.
The two went after their missing teacher and Tom, being the outgoing man he always was, and being someone who could rival Albus any day took charge of his Aurors. The thought that this was Narcissa was all he needed to add that extra edge to his fighting stance.
“There isn’t a lot of ways to find someone like that, invisibility cloaks are rare for a reason. Her footprints were the exception, that still means our best bet is to try and find the cornerstone first and block her in safely.”
“I intend to. I’ve wanted this person stomped out of existence for a while.” With steel in his heart Tom was gone with the prowl of a large predator ready to hunt.
So, someone was after him, he thought as the cruel words of Walburga washed over him, but never soaking in. They were going to ruin his parent’s lives. He wasn’t going to get to stay or have a family if they won. His eyes flickered up at his in-denial grandmother.
I hope this twist with Draco's family surprised a few people and gets you excited for what's coming next. I pray in my heart I don't make any of this convoluted, but I can't be sure I haven't already. For now I'm just so glad I got some smut and romance into all this chaos before it took off again. Thank you to everyone for reading.
The best he could guess, they were a breed of Mandrake and if he was lucky that meant that Hufflepuff had diluted and altered them by breeding them into a new subspecies. Some old weapons had been traded out to make them more hostile to intruders, but the same rules may still apply on how to deal with them. She had to have made them stand down to get past somehow, after all she needed to be able to get past too.
“NO!” Draco yelled back suddenly.
Albus had to grab Minerva to steady her the next time she tripped. She fumbled an apology as she cast her wand downward and stilled. A slim root had broken through the floor in front of her and although the path ahead was still pitch black against their Lumos held outward there was undoubtably something close. The air had changed to something humid and fragrant, like fresh morning grass. It would have been relaxing in another place, except everyone knew that whatever it was ahead it would probably try to kill them. Just the thought made Draco sigh heavily and receive a few looks of agreement from the others.
__________
“They’re a hybrid Mandrake.” A slight smile started to find its way to the boy’s face as he looked down at his companion. A clear fascination was shining in his eyes. “Hufflepuff somehow bred her mandrakes to an adult human size and then cross bred them with Devil’s snare. They grab anything currently exuding magic like your wand just was when you changed back. They retained their weakness of light and fire, which is why the dark damp of the room is ideal to keep them happy. They also like being talked to, but only politely, I think. Moody found that one out the hard way.” He cringed to punctuate his point.
“Yes Father.”
“Draco, I’ve allowed you to bring this untrained boy into our advanced course on the premise that it would deprive you of an education. Do not make me regret this decision.” His stern voice made the blonde fidget as he seemed to contemplate the consequences of what he was about to say. Snape waited, piercing eyes squeezing the life out of the youth before him into submitting.
“No game Snape. I meant what I said. I know it’s not exactly what one might call ideal, mostly my father. Who cares about that?” Truly he did, he knew how hard his father hit when he wanted to get a point across. “I’m asking because I mean it. I’m not asking for you to say yes to anything, just let me court you?” He finished hopefully and a bit more quietly still, weary of curious listeners.
“Then I guess I’ll just follow you so you don’t have to take me.”
“Okay, I’ll let her know for you.” He smiled. “I’ll even leave the curtain open for you so you can scare the hell out of the next person to cross your path.” He heard a laugh as he went to leave, but didn’t bother to look back; she would never let him see her smile if he understood her character right.
“Tom.” He unknowingly drew attention back to himself as he continued to talk to himself. “What makes you think I don’t want both…” Tom tensed at the words; he’d never said that part when he told the story. “Right there, right there past the door, looks like every other one but this one’s carved. Only one I’ve seen like that was the head master’s.” His voice was growing lower, softer. The group straining to hear and too afraid to interrupt.
“Do you want to try hunting for potion ingredients there together? I can bring a bag and harvesting tools.” Harry bounced in excitement. It was always better to have something to do after all.
Harry was darting around the walkway to platform 9 ¾ with Hedwig hooting up a storm, fluffing her feathers up like she was flying in her cage and encouraging the boy to run faster in their mutual glee. He’d bounced back like he always did after an incident; Harry was probably the most resilient person Remus and Sirius had ever met and had the pleasure of knowing. They watched as Draco kept Harry from toppling over and Hedwig snap at him for slowing them down. Bloody bird really didn’t like anyone but Harry.
Harry felt the beating pulse of his heart in his ears and buried his head into Remus’s chest in a vain attempt to protect himself. Draco was already throwing up a shield to separate them from the new enemy before Sirius snapped around on his toes to point his wand. There she stood, like a beacon of light, blinding pink in the center of a gray dusty street.
It was at this time of night, in a far darker corner of this estranged and hidden world that a dark figure screamed out in rage. Black curls frizzing with magical discharge and flailing limbs that only focused enough to point her wand. A black lace corset and dress kept pristine by the house elf she had taken from the Black household so long ago.
Fae and a visit home.
Thank you for reading and as always I love you bunches and oats!
There were no visible ways further down then the dungeons, and no matter the spell cast or hand wandering over a surface, no one found anything that would help. It was an important part of the school, and it had been properly hidden to reflect that. Even if there had been portraits down here to point the way they wouldn’t have seen the construction of the path to even be able to guess where it would be.
Albus was nowhere in sight, just a young man. The begging’s of stubble and a swept back fade cut of brown hair decorated a classically handsome jaw and cheekbones, blue eyes bright with the same kind of mischief and joy as Tom or Sirius on any given day. His suit decidedly muggle in nature had two twin griffins on either lapel and a series of feathers circled his sleeve cuffs and across the bottom of his untucked shirt’s sparrow tail cut. The favored purple something they’d seen on the head master a majority of days.
“What are you even doing?” Draco groaned as he threw his head back and sighed.
A snap like a firecracker went off somewhere down a neighborhood road. No one would think anything of it, just another kid playing around after dark with friends.
“And you thought you had to do this?” He said in the kind of serious tone one used for accusations. Not angry or blaming, but almost like passing judgment; it sent a chill up Harry’s spine, his instincts calling back bad memories of Petunia.
“Necklace?” Harry tried to groan out and she reached for his neck to fish out what looked like a silver chain with a chunk of sea glass hanging from it.
“Don’t take it out on him Severus.” Draco brought everyone back to his attention. Snape narrowed his eyes at his god nephew. He saw the regret in the young wizards face after he’d used his first name, good.
“Alright…” Draco didn’t look convinced.
““It was made to as Pansy once put it “Hold up the school”. She said that the other founders cut Salazar Slytherin from the stone because he was going to bring the school down.” Harry answered, a question forming on his face.
Harry woke to the loud chorus of the Weasley home being set into motion. Doors opening and closing in distinct purpose as everyone got up and readied for the day together. Following that lead another first awaited Harry, opening his own door. The thought sent an adrenaline spike through his body, making him tense and wake fully.
Either way, he hoped the person he was going to choose to be would still be able to carry their name without condemning his parents. He did love them, would always love them despite the requirements that came with the life they all lived together.
“Really?!” He looked defeated at the excited reaction from the muggle student who seemed completely unrepentant all of a sudden.
“I see all that resides in your mind and heart. Being the sorting hat is just a parlor trick really. It is my job to help bring children to the craft they should devote themselves to, to give them an edge in what can give them a good life. Sorting gives them a clan, and a set of traits to hone into a weapon to use. You have many you could focus on; it makes me reluctant to label what best suits you. What you would be happiest with…"
The green sheets of his bed in Slytherin were across from Severus. Every morning he would get up to a knotted mess of hair and look over at the already made bed. He’d never caught Severus sleeping in despite his penchant for late night study.
The room filled with wet sounds resonating between them, the heady feeling of orgasm driving them both in a frenzy to make those bolts of lightning strike faster, to make that one spot or another light up as they fought to angle themselves while still moving. Harry was ramming into Draco’s sweet spot consistently now, having found his own bellow the head where he could put pressure down onto the vein there if he just used a bit more force. Sweating and gasping for air, a maddening heat built itself in their space and made them work harder still to make it to their end.
Draco was humping the bed and suffocating in the sheets as he tried to turn his head to breath and keep pace, he was so close now.
Gellert looked into blue eyes the color of tears, they had never looked more so than now. Eternal life was not meant to do this to them, they knew it would be hard, but that was why they had to stand together. He couldn’t lose Albus after only a thousand years, they had so many more left.
Sirius was scratching himself like he had flees, eyes full of worry, “So you like it?” He asked hopefully.
Then a shocking wet feeling hit his jugular and sucked. An accidental groan was pulled from his lips as his vision faltered. Harry was kneading experimental touches into his boyfriend’s back. The thought that he was with this person sent a new wave of bravery and want. This new aspect to his life was just beginning, but he couldn’t get started exploring it fast enough as he dipped his hands under the warm fabric of Draco’s collared shirt and unbuttoned coat. The glide of skin on skin gave an immediate response as Draco rolled his chest into Harry and stuttered quietly.
“And I won’t let you suffer through another one without real sleep.” Draco was clutching at him, dragging him back up the steps past a worried looking Walburga. The hands-on Harry’s arms were tight and clammy.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m fine.”
“It is the last safe place I have. I have stayed, waited for him to come back for what only I can give, but still he would rather die than realize his error. Or did you mean this room especially? It is painful to sleep where he used to lay with me. There are many such beds here.”
“Tantum in infirma timore tenebris.” Lucius supplied.
“This probably won’t go the way you’re hoping.”
Draco’s breath caught at the words. “Mother.” Dobby didn’t seem to notice and kept trying to recall all of his Fathers purchases in the last year now. “Dobby,” He called back the elf’s attention, “Dobby, what did Bellatrix give my Mother?” He asked with a growing sense of dread.
“I wasn’t talking about you Aunt Bella.” He jabbed back.
“Harry this is serious!” Draco spat out in frustration.
“And the meeting rooms!” Harry nodded frantically, a smile spreading on his face. “Thank you so much! I’ll do a good job I promise!”
How disappointed would his mother be? She had made Lucius send Draco to Hogwarts especially because it was closer than other schools and he’d be able to come home for holidays. Narcissa hadn’t done anything wrong to deserve the short end of the stick just because Draco didn’t want to be smacked on the head or told he was being a ‘foolish boy’ one more time. Surely, he should just put up with the time it would take for Lucius to cool down so they could all be a family for Yule and whatever place the yearly ball would happen that he just knew he’d be dragged to.
“Here.” He pointed with his finger onto the embossed first letter of the creature cataloged inside.
I'm doing so much googling trying to find the right information about locations and Fae recently. Looking up the different lores and specific things I need tends to result in being told the vaguest information about how something was referenced in a myth but never explained. And Oh My God the unmarked walking paths in the national parks over in England, I read the immediate definition and its like ya there's sign but you need to go on a sight and get a PDF if you don't want to get lost. Why? Just why? I've been making myself so confused with how I'm going to do all this and I'm so scared it won't be good. On the bright side I have been able to make forward progress in my writing and that's the most important part.
“Albus Dumbledore.” Dobby gasped in awe. It was clearly too much for the poor creature, but perhaps the adrenaline was helping because Dobby was thinking as hard as he could now. He was mumbling every little thing he could remember about Bellatrix and everything in the house he’d ever touched. “Can’t be. Miss Bellatrix’en been sent the boxes only to Master Narssis’in no’ the big Master Malfoy, sir.” He whimpered as he tried to think of something else to offer.
“I expect it to be impossible for the young Black to pick up a fifteen-pound snake right now, despite her being a black mamba she is five times the size and cumbersome at times. However, I’m sure she wouldn’t mind coming with you four if you’d like Harry.”
“Hey,” Harry pulled at Draco’s coat before he could follow after Snape to the dungeons for the night. “will you stay up with me a little?”
“With magic though?”
“Turn back now Dad!” He yelled, ordered, with a conviction that had Sirius listen instantly.
Lucius woke to a gaunt looking Snape. Something in his head was telling him that beautifully crooked nose and sharp features looked somehow older. More dignified. The young man he was turned into something else slowly as Lucius’ mind adjusted to the reality of everything that had happened. He was crying silently when Severus stirred awake from his stiff position in the visitor’s seat, he had refused to move from.
Tom readied himself for whatever would jump out at him first, he was a tad on edge admittedly since leaving Nagini outside in the dungeons for her safety. She was a strong familiar and even more favorable as an alarm system, she saw everything with clarity and her animal senses had helped him countless times. If he was being honest with himself, he was nervous after the last room, now he wished he had taken her for comforts sake.
“Alchemy, the greatest invention of man. The miracle to turn water to wine, to turn mere stone to gold or even the mortal flesh into an immortal vessel. Even those without magic sought its powers through Alchemy and they called it science. For no matter how it changes or for who all men of import think they have too much to lose. So, it went, the rich sought a means to keep their riches after death or to pay it off, ultimately however there were those who found other means. They too were blind to the fact that they had already lost what they sought. For is it not the nature of time to continue on? We cannot stand by and watch, it is not a choice. We must walk on beside it for we exist in the moment and only the moment.”
“Because of the power of friendship?” Harry waved for Hermione to follow. She seemed to be calculating something, he could understand that.
“I’ll drink it if you don’t want it.” He teased making to grab the cup and watching Harry pull it closer to himself in defense.
“Then I guess I’ll just have to be worth it.” Harry found himself saying before he could stop himself. He stomped to the hearth where a small trail of dirt had the vague shape of their bodies where they had laid earlier.
“You’re mother hening Ron, he’ll be fine. Besides it’s one of the most memorable first moments you get coming to the magical world, it’s a few years late, but he still gets to do it and I’m glad for him.” She turned to Harry now, “I just know you’ll love it, because I did. If Ron hasn’t told you I’m muggle-born so I’m coming from the same place as you.”
Every known purist and anti-creature party member affirmed their vote, a small faction that had counted on the swing voters. Their defeat was palpable, Dolores seethed in her chair as she transcribed.
“I do. Is this okay? You didn’t really like the kisses much.”
“Not since the descendants of my followers left me here, since my love left me here. It is no matter, I will wait. I have the most important part after all. My duty will keep me company.”
“You did say it was time sensitive miss Zanna.” Harry argued in Draco’s defense even as he laughed at the other boys annoyed face.
Thank you thank you thank you! I love all of you so much!
Harry sobbed when the figure moved again, so used to no escape he gave up and let them close the distance. He let out a guttural cry he’d been hiding in his throat, trying not to alert anyone, the moment two arms came around him in a barely there hug.
“Nonsense. It’s perfectly normal to be scared or to want to stay with us after all you’ve been through; but this is only one of your homes now, you have another to look forward to very soon.”
‘An eater lacking mouth and even maw; yet trees and beasts to it are daily bread. Well-fed it thrives and shows a lively life, but give it water and you do it dead.’
Harry breathed in with some difficulty. He looked up into silver eyes in a subconscious plea. He hugged himself.
“Is that an invitation?” Harry smiled.
After the tense beginning the group had slowly come together as time passed. Whenever it seemed hard to talk, they just turned back to Harry to be their neutral ground, to glue them together safely. The ride had been surprisingly enjoyable for everyone involved and even more surprisingly no one had fought the whole way there. Draco was still waiting for the second boot to drop, but for now he could just enjoy what he’d earned so far. Harry was close and touching him as he gestured or shared a candy, leaning in to sleep by the end. It was mostly unconscious, that’s what Draco told himself. There wasn’t anything wrong with Harry wanting to be near him after everything they’d been through. It was natural to be drawn to one’s protector. The look he was getting from the couple across from him had him stare in challenge back. He gave them the most judgmental look he could in response and the muggle-born girl just smiled, making him get the sudden urge to push Harry away despite his own want to keep him close.
Before long the troop was together and Moody was still roasting the two brats that had been keeping up the banter and by extension the groups spirits.
“Oh, excuse me for disturbing you. I thought—” That this would be more like finding hidden treasure maybe? That wasn’t something to say out loud though.
“Yes! I thought that was you.”
“My mothers. Its rather glued there and no one can get it down.” Sirius looked down at Harry apologetically. “Walburga was never a very nice woman when she was alive, especially towards the end. Don’t take anything she says to heart.”
“Do you know about anything my Father may be hiding in the house?” He now whispered. “Something sent by Bellatrix, or that looks very magically important for any reason?”
“Death.” Draco deadpanned. “Agonizingly slow death.”
“It’s invisible. Magic, remember?”
“What did she do?” Harry was leaning clear over the gap of space between him and Tom.
this ones a bit shorter and posted later in the day, sorry for that. I think it all makes sense or at least my 12 at night brain said it was okay when I wrote some of this so let me know if anything feels wrong.
“Oh, that cheek! I do adore it. I do indeed.” She seemed to stop and pinch at her chin in thought. “Alright here it is, Fae folk and the like take something equal in a sense, usually something that’s as important to you depending. Since this’ll be for a friend though and not you, ya got to do me a favor in turn when I need it. Might be less might be more. That’s the risk of it, regardless of if ya find this unnamed thing you’ll be look’in fer.”

“And the day before.” Another added.
He felt the presence of the others inching up their own paths to the plant behind him. The ring of petals was so large he could barely reach over it to poke the spine with the tip of his middle finger. Stroking down to pick up a film of pollen he pulled back and turned to one of the mandrakes.
Soft good boy Dumbledore. We needed some of that after all the stories I've read were he's just a dumb mean old man who abuses Harry with no real plan while screaming at the top of his lungs that is in fact a smart. I know people want to flip the table on Tom being evil and Dumbledore being bad, but it just comes out as needlessly mean sometimes. Is that just me?
“Because he isn’t used to it.” He let Sirius stare at him for a moment as he processed the thought.
I had fallen in love with Albus over a lifetime and in a few years, Bellatrix declared that it was no different for her.
“What’s the glue situation.” Harry teased as he bent down to hug Kreacher who’s wrinkled face smoothed out at the sight of him. It was something special to see those huge cat eyes of his grow soft and draw you in.
“You really are nice. Thank you.” He whispered.
He gestured and Tom stood to address the room. “Tom Riddle, case worker for Harry Potter speaking. We are unanimous in the removal of Harry Potter from the Dursley’s as the court has decided previously today. With that proposal addressed it is now time to broach the subject of adoption.”
It's time for a Witch hunt.
“Our fam got a little bigger then, huh?” Harry smiled to himself. Apparently, family wasn’t the best word to let slip because Draco was tense again. “I’m sorry, I’ll try not to mention that stuff for a while.” Muscles relaxed in answer.
“Why don’t you two take these fops back and send the portkey to me after and I’ll catch up.” He said instead, the cries were only growing.
“He was taught that if he wanted or needed anything, he had to do it himself. More than that he was taught that he had to keep it quiet and not get caught or risk being abused. It’s been a matter of survival for so long for him that trusting us is only half the issue. We are going to have to let him heal, even if it doesn’t happen quickly. This was a lifelong choice we made taking him in and that might mean all kinds of things.” Remus rested a hand over his husband’s.
“I just— “Harry inhaled sharply as he tried to make his words into something coherent. “I’ve never had power or control over anything… in my whole life… and then it was all going to happen all over again. I was gonna lose everything again before I even had it like my mom and dad, or friends, or—and I just couldn’t wait for it to happen. I didn’t want to watch. I had to do something, so I did the thing I thought would give me a chance. I was more scared of what would happen if I didn’t.” Harry closed his useless eyes and let himself pretend no one was there to hear. It was so selfish; they’d think he was selfish and he was. He hadn’t just done it to save Remus, he did it to save what he wanted.
“And I’m telling you- “Draco increases his volume”-my cousin has agreed to take custody. Sirius Black wants to legally adopt, he has been denied children on murky terms before, you cannot tell me this has nothing to do with that. You would condemn a boy’s life because of prejudice. Sirius and Lupin have been together for over a decade and are more than stable enough to adopt. One of these two even teaches children at Hogwarts and is loved by the student body. It would do no harm to the magic community for them to raise a muggle boy and has nothing to do with you aside from your job to file that damn paperwork. If you don’t you will have the whole of the Malfoy family breathing down your neck!”
“Like how wizards are superior?” He got an enthusiastic nod.
“And I regret to inform you I am the last remaining Slytherin heir. It may be a gamble, but if she can get the cornerstone to work…”
It looked like someone’s workshop inside instead of a shop. The tools and open kiln laying out on a large table in the center where the owner clearly spent all their time. Snacks and empty boxes stuffed into the small trashcan under the workstation confirmed that thought.
“Controversial isn’t how I’d describe the plans for a genocide.” Harry took in the way they seemed to think on his words. Had they never really given it any thought? “No one worth loving these days wants to be connected to Hitler.” Harry offered with a shrug.
Tom found them in an unexpected place really, not for any of the traditional reasons unfortunately. You see, it was quite expected for the known, now confirmed, Death Eaters to hide with allies such as the Crabb and Goyal family homes. It would have therefore through that same train of thought, that them hiding with other Death Eaters known or not would make sense as well. What he was not expecting was the sheer numbers his small group of helpers had stumbled into.
“So, who knows about Corpse plants?” Harry called for someone to come over, pleasantly enough it turned out to be Roody.
“Can you and Dobby here look after Draco for us while we’re gone please?” He asked with a small bow. The house elf’s eyes lit at the show of humility.
Taking the hint to go first he unwrapped the medium sized square and was greeted with a leather case, it was innocuous in nature without labels of any kind. The soft padding, he felt indicated it held something safely inside. Unclasping the binds to open it, he let out a soft gasp. His confusion must have shown because Sirius finally said something, started to babble really. The case held a series of rune and charmed accessories.
“I’m here.” He croaked out through his recked throat and coughed softly.
“Alright, you did a good job little Hill, ‘re ya are.” The groundkeeper dangled the slice and Hill tested a few loose bites into it to get the food away safely to eat.
“You were hit with a disembowelment curse!” She looked between her readings and the very fine and whole looking boy. “And you should have at least ten counts of internal bleeding from several other spells. Exactly what is going on here?” She was fussing and moving his shirt up to see a volley of bruise marks pelted along his back. That at least explained one thing.
Demons, angel, both old pagan and more modern misconceptions. The fae and their difference to fairies. The past known deals struck with the different groups during occupation and the different wars.
Harry was looking off into nothing as he recounted the night. “I don’t know. I know that sounds like an excuse, but when I saw the book open up to that page I just—”
Tom Riddle is on the case and Harry is walking to the door of everything changing irreversibly.
“Albus, be more careful. You don’t know what comes next.” Tom grumped as he followed quickly after.
“It’s so good to see you mate.” Ron rushed them first pulling them both into a tight hug that squeezed the life out of them since he’d locked his arms around their necks.
“Yes, I suppose I’m the reason he’s here at all really.”
Thank you everyone for your support, this wouldn't exist without the motivation you all give me.
“What is your bloody fucking problem mate?!” He yelled out finally, Snape had blessedly ignored the outburst as he continued to keep an eye on the surrounding area.
That wasn’t the end of it and he was ill prepared for the newly revealed articles laying out on the bed and tucked up on the shelves neatly. It looked like a cured leather body. The fleshy substance of what could have been a man turned into an attempt at a giant rabbit doll lay on one side of the bed over the covers. Draco gagged.
__________
A slam on the table drew their attention, Hermione presented her empty pint as if in challenge and the Slytherins rushed to get more drinks and tried to show her up. Ron looked like he was losing his mind and falling in love all over again. By the time they needed to slow down and just enjoy being in the pub Someone pulled out one of the deck of cards stacked along the room’s walls.
“Bellatrix stomped them. Not the first time someone’s done it but still.” He remembered the day Vernon had actually been annoyed at his son for a solid minute, the day he had broken the old out of date frame. Vernon was forced to replace them, since then his glasses were the only thing Dudley hadn’t pulverized.
“Are they all like her?” Harry asked as he was sat down in the parlor.
It was a hovering observation for some time he hadn’t wanted to dwell on; the new reality he lived in that left him feeling floaty like it was just a dream, a reprieve, from the real world and couldn’t possibly last. He used to float at times back at the Dursley’s, back when he needed it to stop and never did so he just let that part inside him, he could help, leave for a little while.
“I think that whatever is going to happen it’s going to be at Hogwarts.” Harry declared with a kind of finality much like a clock ringing the final hour, there was no mistaking the resolve and set of the boy’s jaw.
“No cussing, if you are the one who taught Draco, I might have to flog you.” Remus shook his head as he rested the tray of tea and biscuits down on the small table in the middle of their group.
“I hurt him.” Was all he could think to say, tear tracks cooling along his cheeks, eyes red and puffy.
“It isn’t the most awful thing I could have done, like Remus said I just have to live through the consequences of my actions, but there is a reason I was taught to show no mercy. I will just have no remorse or weakness when the others challenge what I’ve done.” He stiffened.
“Really Harry?” He chided.
“There’s something I want to try.” Draco nodded as he leaned into Harry’s neck to give him a questioning lick. The body beside him shuddered before pulling back to his disappointment.
“I want to leave.” He tried to enunciate through his tears as best he could and Narcissa relaxed minutely.
“Okay, oh my god! Harlech Castle!” Harry snorted as he threw the powder down and found himself being thrown out of an old stove in stone laid kitchens. In the next moment he felt Draco drop in behind him, shoving him further down onto the kitchen floor. “No, we’re going to break the vials Draco!”
It wasn’t that he hadn’t thought so before or that they’d never openly talked about it, it’s just that he had to remind himself. Tell himself exactly how lucky he was to have his Father’s punishments and not his Grandfather, who would no question, have killed Harry as a part of his infraction. Lucius would cause problems, maybe even hex Harry, but he wasn’t a murderer. It was one of the many things Bellatrix had always spat venom about when they would meet. Something she liked to take it out on Draco too.
“Well, now you do. First use the bathroom, then come down stairs with me for food. Then, after all that, then we can do friend stuff.” Ron negotiated like it was a hostage situation, Harry seemed to contemplate the deal a bit and laughed at the dismay playing out on his victim’s face.
“No, it’s not. I don’t know why you’d even think that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think the point was to make sure you knew what to do so you wouldn’t be at risk trying this stuff alone.” Draco smirked as Harry punched his shoulder. “got a place in mind?”
“It’s just—will I get to see you? Will we get to do anything together? What do Sirius and Remus usually do?” Harry slowly got a bit louder with each question until someone shushed him from down an aisle.
The Solstice was officially here, and with it Sirius’ unrelenting motivation to make a Christmas event that lasted just as long. Harry had suggested he just celebrate Hanukkah before Christmas and negotiated that they’d do that next year. Better to get out all Sirius’ expectations and dreams the first time around so they could settle into something a little less… exciting the next time anyways, he supposed. Kreacher seemed both annoyed and happy for all the extra mess, Dobby had been tripping over himself to help the older Brownie and it looked like they would be fast friends.
“What can I do for you Mr. Riddle? I can only hope it’s good news.” He spoke as he slumped down into his desk chair.
“I just feel like everything’s been—” He shook his hands in the air at a loss. The feeling of being one step behind each time they made progress, but never being tripped by anything left by the woman to stop them even though they couldn’t have been that subtle.
“Caer, why do I know that name.” Sirius muttered, for the first time really listening to the Slyph’s words.
“Deal.”
“But that ruins so many plans I’ve made. Shrieking Shack.” He burned up in green flames like a fireworks sprinkler. Draco followed after, this time finding Harry rolling away from the fireplace to avoid being crushed.
“They said I wouldn’t have to see them.” Harry looked around him. The Dursley’s long gone through another entrance.
“No, it’s the question Head Master! The cornerstone was made by the founders, right?” He looked between the two adults who followed along in agreement. “They used it to hold everything in place. Do you know what they call that in construction?” His tone turned a bit teasing as he looked around his impromptu class.
“Albus, you have to wipe that stuff off somehow.” Tom was struggling and his vines tightened like some other plant Albus couldn’t think of at the moment.
“Are you really so scared of your own friends? I’ve been bullied by kids that always hated me, but shouldn’t your friends be different?”
Harry watched the other boy slouch, thinking to himself like he’d been doing recently. Gray eyes refused to look back up to meet him.
“What would you do?” He cut into her rant and she stopped abruptly at his tone. Calculating eyes watching him.
“They really are much better now; I think you’d do well to reevaluate things with them some time. Thank you for putting up with the formalities, if the pensive memory is not enough in court for any reason you may be called on.”
“They once called me Gellert Grindelwald…”
“Saving you from your obvious tongue-tie jinx.” Draco poked his cheek with the tip of his wand to prove his point.
“So, it’s okay to still feel bad even after you forgive me? Because I don’t forgive myself.” Harry could feel fingers dig into his blue striped house sweater.
Sirius and Remus were shaken to the core at everything they saw. They were still helping to contain the black hole a cursebreaker and Auror had begun to dissipate, but that meant they were stuck on the other side of the street, looking up the steps of the bank at their son and nephew. The two holding onto each other as they worked their way down to them. They had the look of survivors. It brought back memories of the day Remus had been bit, the days when they had fought and run from the Death Eaters themselves, the time Rudolfus had ended up in hospital. All permanent scars left in the wake.
“You been doing a good job at least?”
“Half yours.” He joked.
Tom was down the road from his mark, the Death Eater he had tracked from his Blood Hound spell was obscured by a low black hood and changed features that gave a distinct uncanny valley only altering a face with magic can do when you know what to look for. He just needed this one Death Eater and Dolores would be caught by the tail. He was moments away when something changed and another joined his mark, whispering furiously.
Harry follows the wisp.
“And the meeting rooms.” The Goblin added.
The world went hazy again, something was so wrong. Now he was more like his father, looking in a mirror being instructed by the man himself as he straightened his tailcoat for the wedding. He’d had something to say he thinks, but that was then and by now he’s forgotten.
“Albus.” Gellert called out to the brunette from across the study.
“Bloody said I was.” He gasped out in response as he felt the fingers that had become a part of him slide out leaving a gaping feeling behind like he’d just lost a vital part of himself. “Harry.” He found himself pleading as he forced himself to look properly at his partner after realizing he’d shut his eyes.
Harry pulled the curtain closed on her and she screamed. “I’ll uncover you if you use your indoor voice. I grew up with enough of the kind of person you’re being and I can tell you I’m bloody tired of it. What you have to say doesn’t mean anything to me because I don’t know why you’re even mad in the first place.”
“Guess this is where we part ways.” Ron looked the spindly boy over in slight concern. “You gotta get sorted with the rest of the littlies. It’s real important because you get put in a house and dorm room when you get sorted. Transfers don’t happen so often; I’ve maybe seen one in the middle of the year. Good news is you’ll get sorted with a group so you’re not the only one up there.”
At least now when Lucius made the wrong choice and hurt Draco it would be fully his fault and he would have the ability to see it and apologize. He had been robbed of that. Heaven knows if Narcissa ever knew about this at all. Thoughts swirled in the couple’s heads, each worried over a list of things and how the world had suddenly shifted irreversibly for them.
“I’m home Grandma.” He chimed to the empty picture frame and a head popped into view just in time to wave as he passed. Last he’d heard from Sirius in the letters she had been trying to make up with her husband’s portrait upstairs.
“I think it’s about time you tried explaining these dreams of yours Son.” Remus said in a gently yet serious tone, hand stretching out to hold his shoulder firmly.
A sense of urgent and unfurling hope settled firmly in Tom’s chest as he watched the man turn to notice him. Albus looked at him, some fog of forgetfulness sat in his gaze as he smiled gently at the intruder in his doorway. Tom knew about it of course, since Severus had told him he’d been needing bigger doses, but this was the first time he really let himself look when it was happening. He wanted to cry as much as he wanted to smile back.
The last rooms to the cornerstone.
Draco thought he was shocked before, now he was stunned too. Even he knew he wasn’t nice; the snakes would have fallen over laughing. This muggle was absolutely insane as he thought, thinking a Malfoy would be benevolent to him. Or was his life that awful?
Mrs. Weasley had been dumbfounded when she’d looked out her window to see her two young boys hand feeding her infestation. Lawn Nome’s had always been a personal nightmare for her, the humanoid beings never once listening to reason as she saw it, but Arthur just told her to let it be this once for Harry. Her threat that he would be the one to do the job later only made the man laugh like always, the sounds of “yes dear” trailing behind him as he fled.
She saw herself out, long hair swishing with her steps as she went. Skirts fluttering in a nonexistent breeze she must have been producing herself as she seemed to fade away into nothing as she walked down the street. He locked the door and was pulled back to the living room by everyone.
It read “Pureblood Slytherin at Hogwarts and son of powerful political figure Lucius Malfoy, Draco Malfoy, was at the center of a horrible terror attack yesterday. In the Gringotts Bank, none other than the traumatized and weak muggle adopted by the Black family, was caught in a fight between wizards. The Young heir, desperately in love fought his own Aunt, the Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange in a duel that would decide the poor muggles fate. After barely surviving the encounter the two escaped the bank in flames to be surrounded by the group of killers. Draco, the young boy full of passion and hope, let fly one final spell that bested the evil.
That day Draco waited outside their last class with Harry and leaned against the wall, all the while wondering if the group would bother to stop to talk with him as he watched them get closer.
It was like a sickness, he remembered the rumors, the Black’s sickness. Some whispers had been made at his expense a few times about the Black madness being in him too. Bellatrix was a prime example, but Narcissa had never seemed effected. Draco found himself looking down at the floor, shifting his feet in effort to keep them planted in reality both physically and figuratively.
“I didn’t ask to be like this.” Harry started letting a pause fill the air before he broke and continued his confession. He’d never told anyone how he felt before. “I didn’t ask to like him, I don’t know why. I’m different, I’m a freak, you can say it and get it over with too. It’s just not fair he had to send someone so handsome.” Harry croaked with a new spill of tears.
“Why couldn’t he be more like you, he already has my looks and none of the blood to worry over. It’s not like he has to prove anything.”
“Thank the saints, because if you didn’t this would be a rather uncomfortable situation to be in.”
“Tom.” He croaked and smiled, really smiled, now.
“We do not tolerate disruption of our work here. Continue with yours as well boy.” He looked back to his ledger and took up his feather quill again.
Plans are made for the next Hogsmeade
The Golems had stopped and the fire fizzled out as the first door opened. It became nerve rackingly silent in the absent of their giant fists slamming down on the Auror’s barriers. A moment’s hesitation filled everyone, but perhaps Albus Dumbledore who had made the first steps into the next room.
“You were right, next to each other he looks just like you at that age. Let’s just hope you don’t take after your other father, spare me the heart attacks.” Remus joked as he cupped Harrys cheek and ran his other hand as far around Siruis back as he could to help keep them tied together like a knot. He cried silently in comparison to the other two, of which had managed to scrunch their faces up in almost identical ways. He couldn’t stop smiling at the image, wishing he had a picture to keep of this moment forever.
The place was in order, sure, but Harry saw countless webs and dust piles strewn about the area like they had only made time to wipe off the galleons they were processing. Every one of these people was busy and it showed in how little they had time to do anything else. One of the shorter men even had a spider that had begun to weave a web on them.
“What do you think?” He looked imploringly at Nagini who glided over his thigh.
__________
He’d been looking forward to this chance at new experimenting since the school had opened, and after years of only the most elite wizards having an inkling of knowledge, Hogwarts had started teaching Alchemy. They had dreams of this, of being the first ones to discover the answers to the immortal soul, the essence of life, and all the biggest questions. Gellert had always been one for forbidden things, least of which was his lovely assistant and fellow student Albus Dumbledore. Despite the harsh view of his peers and their disgust of the rumored yet secretly kept relations they shared, Albus had always been steadfast in his loyalty and friendship.
“Probably because you’re the only one who can get in to anywhere or something along those lines. Get a picture and I’ll just have Jacob take credit for insurance.” The man raised his brow at her.
“Wasn’t there an answer in the book you read?”
Thank you for reading and I hope you're all doing well. Let me know what you're celebrating this year in the comments.
Somehow Harry sitting with the Slytherin’s was more unbelievable for people than Draco sitting with the Ravenclaws.
Four years later Harry is still scraggly, but the light of childlike innocence had melted away with his ability to smile. Fifteen and still locked in a cupboard much too small for him every night, told his mother was a tramp and his father a floundering idiot Harry was beginning to lose his will as well.
“You were amazing Draco. Thank you. Do you think you’d want to do other stuff later?” Draco looked over from the corner of his eye to see an unsure look playing on Harry’s brow.
*NSFW warning* the sexual parts of this story so far can be skipped over without losing main plot if you prefer.
“You’re even going to bring Gryffindor’s to our table now?” Blaze complained with Pansy about their shattered reputation.
“I’m so glad to hear it. I do enjoy a good happy ending after all.”
“Pansy Parkinson, Blaze Zabini, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle.” She pointed to everyone going anticlockwise. Her critical eye watched the pair and Draco wasn’t sure what she saw. Out of everyone she was often the most perceptive. Draco was not sure how to feel about that at this moment. “You two have fun.”
“The true genius of a Ravenclaw at work.” Draco teased.
The boy was healed a bit, in better shape simply by not having cried for hours like last time. The purple stained his pale skin, his skinny figure obscured by baggy clothes, but Draco could now make out the sunken cheeks. He looked worse off in different ways instead and it set a fire in him somehow. This was his muggle. How dare they.
“No surprise there.” Ron interrupted and Draco glare at him for a moment before continuing.
“Planning something?” He asked almost exasperated as he was deliberating about what to do for Albus. It was true someone had to give him backup, but he hadn’t thought to break them up, rather, only to move everyone.
“Shit.” He gasped out as he tried to look down at the small unassuming cup of striped paper. “Definitely too much.” He would have to tell the twins to tone that one-way way way down. “Is she dead?” He called over to the Goblins that side of the lobby.
“Was Nagini there?”
“What is it?” Sirius threw his face into the paper and was gently pulled back by tom who sighed in response.
“This is nice, thank you for taking me out here like this. You really didn’t have to.” The muggle flushed, a fact that hid beneath the already red nose and cheeks from the cold wind beating against his face. He looked slightly conflicted the longer he stared at the blonde.
“Horrible.” Harry nodded.
Rita was shifted into her small beetle form clutching onto Tom’s coat when it happened. She had just been looking for the right moment to photograph when he’d gone to Grimmauld place. Her head was spinning with all the possibilities as she listened to the group of wizards and one young muggle as they set off for Hogwarts. Her story was growing even bigger by the minute and she held on for dear life as her ride took them through the floo.
“Or I could compare him to Crabbe and Goyle, that’ll get him going.” Draco countered; Hermione seemed to like that thought while the boy in question complained. “Though I am slightly appalled at you, how much do you need to get done? It’s already been half the trip by now.”
Thank you as always for giving this story a try. My first posting here has considerably less smut than I always originally think before I start writing. Is it a curse, have I offended the smut gods? I hope you'll give me a heart regardless and if you want to be alerted to updates every Monday maybe you want to bookmark. *mumbles thank you to myself a million more times as I try to end this note*
“Draco?” Harry waved a hand in front of his face and he snapped back to reality to look at them.
The words didn’t make full sense at the time, what they had done for their lives, to the wizarding world that had been one seam from popping. Draco knew, he hadn’t explained it well; Harry was a beacon to the magicless in an oppressed and old system that had played at advancement over the muggle world and fallen short at their own discriminations. After all, why should the winner apologize? Now, they had fought and won over the winners in several arenas. Harry had the same rights as a muggle born thanks to the court ruling, he had defeated a notorious Death Eater and lived, all of it proving to others that had less that they too could be capable of the same feats.
“What do you think it’ll be like?” He asked as he sorted through the cabinet.
“Good morning.” He pressed a kiss to the top of Harry’s head and stepped away to look back over at the old and rather hateful creature. Kreacher to be precise. “In light of losing your home with Bellatrix… you can stay here, but I don’t need your help.” He added stubbornly. They’d done just fine without a servant for the past twenty or so years.
“Who’s he talking about?” Harry whispered to Draco from their perch outside the room.

__________
They stopped before Breakable Baubles at the entrance to Knockturn Alley. Its little storefront covered in all kinds of glass from handblown to sea glass and stain glass art. Its washed and worn outer walls only served to draw you in to the colorful entrance jeweled in strings of beads that made up the doorway. Beyond it, in the background figures moved about the darker Alley like smog in human form. The implicit nature of them sending warning to any who looked not to come close if you aren’t meant to be there.
Gellert soothed as he pulled Albus into his arms. He felt the other relax in his grip and he reminded himself that what he would do alone was a necessary evil that Albus need not take part in. The man had always been too gentle for his own good, Gellert would take the measures Albus could not and then neither would have to worry.
“Didn’t he come down to talk to you?” Draco asked.
Naturally that set me up for the motivation I have now being a caseworker. When I saw Bellatrix, big eyed and hopping around with pure innocence I saw another child to care for. Being a teaching assistant at the time gave me the chance to experience that and prepare for my future. When she began to cling to me, I encouraged it.
__________
“I’ll see what I can do.” Harry smiled brightly.
Harry whipped around to Draco who immediately pulled up a shield to prevent being pushed off like Ron. It gave Harry the perfect in as he started running forward to close the distance a bit This would make Draco lower the shield so he could cast offense. As predicted, without knowing what trick Harry was pulling he reeled back his wand to cast a stinging jinx. Harry swished his hand forward, almost mimicking the wands gesture, but as he did the spell was redirected to the ceiling as the bracelet caught the wand like a lasso and pulled it free from Draco’s hand. The extending material true to its name snapped back from the foot it had stretched out and flung the wand into Harry’s chest as he tried to catch it.
“Wouldn’t mind leading me to collect everyone would you?” He asked and they were off.
“No, you might be right about that. I don’t know…” The blonde was just staring down at where his hands dangled over the pit.
“It was because of me that Bellatrix tried to kill you, she never even would have known you existed if it wasn’t because of me.”
They could see their breaths in the air now and bundled up after class to go out with baskets and nets to collect as many as they could. Snape demonstrated the proper technique to harvest them from the wheat stocks without damaging anything. Light waned into a warm yellow and purple sky as they trudged down aisles of stalks. Harry and Draco had taken to harvesting either side of each other so they could be close now that they were comfortable with the process. Once they had what felt like a few pounds of wiggling rice in their baskets they were called back to Snape.
The trust he was giving Tom finally made his eyes pool over with tears as he cried. The sight of Albus slowly changing was something he was beginning to believe he would never witness. The old man’s form straightened, his bones crackling alarmingly as they grew strong again, his veins receding into thickening skin that washed itself in a flush of renewed circulation. His eyes grew clear and the blue in them gaining a wash of bright crystal blue color that shined through matching tears. His wrinkles faded and his hair regrew, the white being overtaken by fresh dark brown waves while the white strands began to float down to the floor.
The door swung open with an alarmed Remus looking down at the youth that had kept banging with his fist that now hit his chest instead. He pulled the boy and house elf inside quickly and bolted the latch with a resounding clack of metal fitting into place. He never got a word out before Draco was grabbing at his night shirt desperately.
Draco looked back over at the wardrobe as she talked. Suddenly all the times Lucius had let Bellatrix do whatever she wanted to the two of them made a little more sense. He would do anything for Narcissa, always had, and it seemed she would do anything for Bellatrix…
A final smack of the gavel ended the vote. Papers were signed Harry’s new parents had to fight through tears to look through the contract for their signature line. Nagini coiled around his waist so his hands were free when they rushed over to hug him.
“What just happened?” Ron asked as he stared after her.
It was a bedroom. The clear Gryffindor paraphernalia on one side glittered under the beam of light he passed over it all. Cobwebs should have draped everything, dust should have coated every surface, but as Gellert had thankfully explained, time didn’t really pass the same way here. As such, it felt like he was standing in the room freshly after the fight, the break up, or however he should refer to it. Things were upturned and others broken, the bed sheets had been made up on one side with the other a total mess like Grindelwald had tried to be here at least once before giving up sleep. Letters laid out, probably read about a thousand times, ones from Albus and he thumbed through them. Gentle encouragement and loving words mixed with an unsettling undertone of the times. Some were visibly old, yellowed and torn or smeared and they spoke of war plans and communiques against the goblins and fear of a brownie uprising. Proof that they had lived through, what Harry felt like was, everything.
“The last effects of October’s new year, or as muggles may call it Halloween, is coming. The thinning veil between worlds is closing as we reach the next winter solstice more and more. The last dredges of spirit touched moon drops are wilting and we are going to find the last of them in the forest behind me. You will stay within eye sight. If you do not and disobey me, I will haul you back to make you take detention with a different teacher for the remainder of your punishment. Do we understand?”
“They have hats. They probably have houses. Never thought about it.” The red head just shrugged.
“I will follow you anywhere.” He simply said to the other man, his voice mournful for what was to come.
Draco lit up with the unspoken plan, an idea already forming. “We go to the muggle world.” He smirked. The gang all turned wide eyed at him. “What’s wrong, scared of owning the first town you walk into and taking whatever, you want? We might get caught in diagon alley using magic but what muggles going to be able to stop a bottle of vodka floating out a window?”
“A layer on the brush will do, we can always get more since we all know Dumbledore will let him keep it.” Snape rolled his eyes from where he leaned against a fence post.
“Pomona!” McGonagall was the first to lunge forward and take action. Albus beside her in support.
The wisp kept tugging, a silent encouragement to commit to what could be Harry’s final mistake, but still, he came this far. Harry pushed the door open, it moved with ease, the confirmation that the stranger had been telling the truth.
“Fuck Draco.” He breathed, startling when Draco suddenly shrieked and bit into his hand to stop the sound, back arching off the bed.
Dennis and Gordon closing in to join.
“And what do you think you’re doing here! Get out of my house!” A red-faced woman that looked oddly like Julia Child with intricately braided black hair running to her hips was standing in the frame of a full-length canvas pointing at him furiously.
“How far down?” Harry walked over to them from where he and his three appointed and overprotective guardians had finished their sweep of the hall. “It goes farther than the dungeons?”
“Alright, we’ll see how this goes, but as soon as he says a word about my blood, I’m going to beat him to within an inch of his life.” She said passively in the same tone as before.
Thank you, I love everyone who reads my story, you are all amazing!
“We have a minister volunteering to house you while we lead you through proceedings. I trust you are ready?”
Gellert breathed in deeply as if to smell the air, it was predatory, a fierce look over taking his features by the second as Harry began to move to the exit. Even the wisp who had led him here was now pulling away with great effort in attempt to take Harry away from the wizard in front of them. Golden eyes locked with his, the pupils flexing inside the ring of color, shaking in confined rage. He had never seen anyone look like that, not even Vernon.
“Kinky muggle, but not interested.” The blonde huffed, still with his eyes closed as he let his arms be untangled. He could hear the pitter patter of his boyfriends socked feet race across the floor boards at the edge of the room where the rug ended. The doors knob jingled open and he was just about to nod off again when he heard Harry’s voice again.
“It feels like—” Tom gasped.
His bed tucked bellow the stairs was dusty from footfall overhead, they hadn’t unlocked the cupboard for him to leave but he knew they were awake. His guardians the Dursley’s were his only relatives and aunt Petunia was his dead mothers’ sister, his only blood relative. He lived with his uncle Vernon, his aunt and their son-
“Good morning Draco.” Harry smiled.
“So, tomorrow?” There was that hopeful tone again.
Taking the floo over Kreacher fawned over him like always before telling Sirius he was there. The shaggy man was a colorful contrast to the neat and tidy gentleman, Lupin, who followed in after.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Take dinner and return to the field in front of the school. We need to collect things that only come out at night.” He instructed and they walked back to the food hall and slumped down on the nearest open spot which happened to be Gryffindor’s table today.
“You’ll never prove it in court!” Harry snorted as Draco reached over to pinch his nose and they scrambled about till the food cart wheeled by and they had to stop bickering.
“Aw, their trying.” Harry coos. The two turn red and only get louder as a result.
“I’m sorry.” He croaked.
“It’s so bright.” Harry muttered as he took in the bright red paint and gold inlay of the wagons.
“But we can’t convict him only her if we find her since he’d have to be present. He probably won’t get a sentence with this new story coming to light. What are the chances the healers will see him unfit to take full custody of Draco afterwards?”
They’re eyes watched him from underneath overgrown brows that obscured the parts of their faces unobstructed by beard. The hand Harry moved disappearing in the grass before coming back with a dandelion flower he offered out. The man quickly snatching it up and settled in as Harry started to help pull the weeds from the ground and passed them over a bit at a time.
“It’s okay now. Draco promised, and it’s okay now. Doesn’t matter if she doesn’t like me. They like me. They really do, and Draco and Arthur said too, and Ron said we’re friends. It’s okay.” He murmured the words till they melded into a mantra that drove him to sleep.
“No, you aren’t sending him, the boy has made it clear that it is not safe for him there, anymore hasn’t he? Sirius has contacted me about possible guardianship if need be in the future. I sympathize with Lucius actually, really, I do, I saw the way he was raised, the way he could only be kind to one woman. He may be loving underneath, but he rides that line with his son, I can’t know where he’ll draw the line as his own father never did.”
A tree with a fairy seat. That point on a tree where it decided not to go straight up, but instead swooped into a perch before continuing its journey. To anyone else it appeared empty, but to Harry he could tell that wasn’t the case. Invisible though it may be, a guard was sure to be sitting there. Past that point was another oddity, another natural distortion, two trees bending in to arch into a doorway of sorts, almost merged completely at the bottom with their roots twining. This was it. He turned to leave a jimmy dodger cookie at the fairy seat before heading through. The offering showing his clear intentions.
Severus had been the one to inform Narcissa of her son’s absence for the summer. It had not been since graduating that Lucius had seen the dark-haired man and held any conversation, Narcissa always preferring to hold tea with him alone and that was fine, he’d never had an interest in the other wizard. When Draco had begun to spend time with him the same was true. He didn’t know honestly, why he knew the man’s address by heart, he just did.
Draco returned the looks of annoyance as he looked back, on all the back and forth he’d been struggling with lately. “I’m bad at this.”
It wasn’t until he began to feel the tingling of a sting seep into his flesh that he looked away. That was the other part of the mirror he realized all too late; the marks had begun to appear along his knuckles where his private tutor had frequently smacked him for improper wand holding. His fingers shook as the dull pain settled in. His eyes blinked rapidly to try and clear his thoughts only to find he had only turned to face another mirror. This had been why Lucius had smacked him when he was a child in Knockturn Alley years ago when he’d once tried to touch a dark item. It had probably been cursed come to think of it, his head ached with the sum of all those small smacks and drawing him away from the important part of that thought. He was quickly becoming disoriented.
Draco cleared his throat awkwardly. Looking down he saw two odd shaped chunks of glass, originally shattered and rubbed smooth and foggy. The blue and green complimented next to each other and he noticed the small air bubbles under the surface of the light blue piece that showed it had been hand blown. If they always failed at their original occupations someday maybe he could recruit Harry to be a treasure hunter with him.
Severus seemed to lean into the doorframe and soften as he watched the same old annoying youth from back then acting so much like that old self. Whatever happened to the idiot? Oh, right, he fell in love. Love made everyone crazy, but he’d never known anyone this saying fit more than Lucius Malfoy.
“Do you have special magic for seeing or anything like that?” Harry asked as he thought on it. Arthur had so much to ask on the differences of muggles and wizards and one of them had been dentists, oddly enough, wizards had potions for it. Like mouthwash, he asked, and boy had that become an intense conversation he hadn’t expected.
“No, listen, if you distract him, I can search for whatever you tell me to look for. I can find what we need.” Harry seemed to stop and consider something. “We can bring Nagini, she can let me know if we find the right thing to take. You know they won’t ask us to do this, they just said as much.”

“You’ve never been much of a people person.” Sirius hopped back into his usual mood as he wiped his face.
“This will not end well will it?” Draco sighed. Sirius gave him a knowing look.
“We do Yule like the weasel.” He seemed to take delight in the scolding look Harry sent him.
“Ew, but also jelly beans taste good.”
“Don’t make me jinx you on the way to the meeting young man.” Tom smirked. His visibly younger face crinkled at the eyes, a sense of calm came at the reminder of how far they’ve come since the day he’d met the scrawny red head all those years ago before he had grown into a middle-aged man with a small quidditch team’s worth of children.
“Next duel in class I’m sending you flying.” Draco wheezed as he caught up.
“Miss Bellatrix Black, I must formally state that I do not share your feelings.”
He watched Sirius recount his meeting to Lupin like he’d been on a grand adventure and they smiled to each other, hands wandering in comfort, their chests tight with anticipation that ebbed between fear and joy. The same feelings no doubt ravaging Harry right now all alone.
“How do you know him?” Ron talked softly as not to wake the sleeping boy.
“It’s alright, take your time.” Tom eased despite his own tension.
“Harry, has this Dudley harmed you again since last time?” He asked Cooley. That signaled the start of their respective hunting for information.
“Alchemy, and you do a fine job of it. Alright first one orange vanilla scent, and bright purple color.”
With a slam of the court’s doors and a pounding of the gavel that shook Harry’s heart in his chest that the Minister spoke. “Break is over, all those in court will return to their places and we will continue our ruling on the case of Harry Potter’s removal from the Dursley’s and possible adoption.”
Remus ducked his head, a wash of shame flowing over him at the fact he’d even considered the option. It had been for Albus, for his life and for no other reason he had allowed himself to consider it.
“Ya, because you helped me leave an abusive situation.” Harry argued in exasperation.
“Shut up!” Harry saw red as he went to lunge over the table. Instead he watched in shock as Griphook had the wards throw her out. With a wave of his hand and some foreign language, Rita Skeeter was propelled backwards and shot out onto the street.
“You sound like a tour guide.” He laughed as Draco brought them to a small fireplace just big enough for them if each crouched and went on their own.
“Roger That. I’m wasted, and I want sleep, tell us all about it tomorrow.” Zabini went to grab the boys and they were off, the portkey popping back after another second.
He pulled the pin out of his pocket and thumbed the enamel of it, nothing happened. It was a ward. He had to try though, if he had been lucky the portkey might have worked for him and none of this would be a problem.
Draco glared at Harry accusatorily at the same time the door swung open. “Oh, fuck you both.” He muttered under his breath.
“Fuck. He hates me.” Draco stated in instant dismay and bowed his head down as he listened in defeat at Sirius’ finding even more amusement in the situation.
“I just don’t see how those rules would maintain a proper match length.”
“Ya, we’re still Slytherins and we got a house cup to win! Just because we won’t mess with you anymore doesn’t mean we won’t still beat you this time!” Crabbe cuts in.
“Fair argument I suppose.” He checked the bags contents and sighed. “You’re safe this time, but no more tackles.”
“That’s not the same thing as unbreakable.”
“We won’t go past a certain point marked by centaur knotwork etched into a line of trees, beyond that lays their territory. We are the stewards of everything before that. Keep the lanterns uncovered and the top hatch open, I’ve put smudge sticks inside that ward off most predatory animals when smelled. We are looking for cylindrical, deep purple berries. The ones we need are covered in a thick gel like film that will feel like residue. Not all will be spirit touched so we don’t need them all, but you will only feel the film on them when it is night and the moon’s rays have renewed the substance.” He explained as they walked into the pitch-black overgrowth.
He sucked in a breath as he tried to wiggle his foot loose of the grip of the thing that had him. It was slim around his ankle, a vine. It was so simple; his mind didn’t need to run his thoughts past anything before he was reaching into his pocket for a knife. The small pocket knife flipped open and as carefully as he could in the dark and given his position, he jammed the blade between his leg and the vine, sharp edge out and sawed.
He had no way of knowing, no guarantee that this was real, that things could go another way. In the end it was just another blind trust fall, to see if this time he was caught. Even then, there would be more important things in Lucius’ life than Severus could ever hope to be. One of them was a son Severus would have to keep from him, and when you didn’t really know someone anymore as much as you still wanted to love them, the child always comes first. He couldn’t be complacent about that, he refused to be.
Looking up at the stars mostly drowned out by city light he crossed his fingers like he used to and started to wish. Wish that Draco would come back. This was one that could come true after all.
“Meant for those that already know where it is.” He muttered to himself, drawing Draco’s gaze as he thought. He had stopped walking, trying to listen to the quite nature around them for something, anything another might overlook. He could do this; it was why he was sent here in the first place. You weren’t just given a prophecy that was doomed to fail in the end, right? He was meant to change things.
He was new to this, but he was catching on. He understood that Grimmauld place was safe because it kept everyone else away. He needed to be somewhere they couldn’t trap him, but could still reach him, neutral ground.
It took Draco a moment to take in he was being crushed in a hug. It was like a drowning man trying to save himself by dragging you down. It loosened after a few frantic breaths only for Harry to settle into it, he was in no hurry to part from his hero. Draco gave in and rubbed his back a bit till Harry released him.
“Need I remind you we still have your irregular behavior to worry about?”
We are nearing the end of this arc, I hope that makes sense as this is the romance part of the story and we will pick back up on the action soon.
“The request will pass. The required aforementioned inspections will be held by Tom Riddle case worker and the exceptions of Mr. Potter’s muggle heritage will be seen as a muggle born’s and he shall be applicable to all laws therein. Note we will revisit conflicting Squid laws at a latter date”
They were getting odd looks and wide eyes of shock and curiosity from everyone. The little girl that had held his hand came running up, completely ignoring her new Hufflepuff classmates in favor of tiptoeing to Harrys ear. Her hand went up to cover her mouth like she was trying to keep her words a secret.
“And what’s that supposed to mean?”
“You think their together?” Harry raised his brows and looked down at Nagini who had twisted around one of his legs. She nodded at him and he gave Draco a meaningful look that answered them both. “I didn’t know you could be with someone so much older than you. How does that even work?” He asked himself mostly as they tuned back into the conversation happening.
“Perish the thought.” Severus rolled his eyes. “That I should be pulled towards those two monkeys in adult life as well. Have I not suffered their attention enough?” He drawled.
The sounds of the Weasley family sung along with the moan of the house settling, a steady heartbeat that while familiar to them had been easing Harry from his last episode of the day into sleep. The shock long ago settled in his bones now buzzed in the back of his mind.
Will the boys stay in love through these trials? Will Draco Malfoy be set in the arranged marriage expected of him in his position and leave the clearly inferior choice of a muggle? Or will things devolve further into violence? Either way somethings going to give!”
“You are the gentle one of the two of us. Yes, I know what you would have said. And when people started dying because I did nothing you would have blamed yourself.” The words bit more than he meant.
“Depends.” Tom snarked back. “But a main support beam should be around the bottom.”
Harry lay in bed nervously, the steps of his uncle knocking dust down onto him as they went to bed. He had been wishing a lot lately, tonight he did again. Thinking of Draco, he tried to imagine his new family. He would have parents, he thought disbelievingly. It hadn’t even fully registered that they would be two fathers that understood. He felt exhausted as the days passed and he hoped each time he heard a door open or close that it was for him.
“So, let’s get this right. You haven’t talked to us and have avoided the dorms at all cost as much as possible because?” He raised a brow and looked between the boys in question.
The wars came and went, the two men did not age or grow sick. They shared their fortune with others, knowledge that would help keep the wizarding world alive. When the first world war happened, it was the loss of faith for humanity that struck Gellert. He had always thought the muggles a weaker cousin of the wizards, had hoped they would follow after some day. Now he was beginning to doubt.
They went through the illusion and found themselves on a new enclosed platform with a train spouting fresh white smoke at them and obscuring faces from a distance. The engine was gargling its fire and a whistle sounded as soon as they entered the area.
“Don’t get you’re point. Muggle technology that requires your location to be visibly connected to a network is dangerous and illegal outside sanctioned crossroads or districts. One of the things you learn as a kid when you ask if you can get one. I’m still depressed my request for the Leaky Cauldron to get one was vetoed by the owner.”
“I like your weakness.” Harry smiled. His breathing leveling out, relieving everyone at the quick healing.
“I’ll stay with you.” Harry leaned over to whisper in his ear, hands reaching out under the tablecloth to brace on a thigh and wrap around his bony waist. “We decided already, so it’s okay. They can do it. It gets better, I promise. You just have to be brave for a little bit.” Harry’s hushed tone wobbled as he repeated the encouragement he’d received back when Draco had once saved him. It was time he got his help too.
Thank you for reading so much, we're over 80,000 words and I can't believe it. I just hope that this piece lives up to someones expectations and brings them joy. I love you with all my heart, thank you so much for being here.
“How about we talk in your room young man?” He said as he guided Harry out. He could see Vernon pale and start screaming about getting the cops. They were the cops! Harry thought a bit perplexed.
The door at the other end was of course locked. Now they were huddled against it instead of the small passageway out as they were surrounded. Albus and Tom worked on the lock unconcerned though.
By the end of the papers being filed Harry had been given bad tasting medicine for his stomach and was so tired from emotional exhaustion he didn’t notice when he had started to doze off. He woke up to a loud overly joyous voice cutting into his dream and startled in fear that everything had been in his head, still in his cupboard. He sighed when he found his two escorts, who now seemed to be guiding a red headed man in a warm brown suit and coat over to him.
“Mother, how long has this been here?” He asked as politely as he could.
“Where’s Remus?” Harry looked around as best he could but no appropriate outline stuck out as him.
“Alright, so I’m willing to bet this Devil’s snare Corpse plant hybrid doesn’t just eat bugs or in this case humans. It’s been down here for a long time so it clearly has a food source or can return to dormancy, we just have to trigger a response to let go and close up or to pollinate.” Harry looked over to Roody who nodded, not in simple agreement, it was clear he planned to do whatever was asked of him.
Harry found his place in front of Gringotts Bank and opened his backpack. Taking out the party poppers the twins had given him as a gift over the summer and several other small items he allocated them to his jean pockets. Once he was inside no one could take him off the premise as long as he had business, and Harry Potter wanted a very extensive talk about opening up his own bank vault.
He thought of the lesson’s his mother read him before bed, little stories like The Bard and the Ovate. The tale of the persistent spider, that kept working till it made its web. The little common house spider working on its oddly symmetrical art as he looked upon it in this instance sent a new chill up his spine now. The message it told, to be mindful of the choices he had to make soon, hung over his head. He had never thought the spider for his guide before, but now in retrospect, with his whole life morphing and changing based on his decisions it may have always been that way.
