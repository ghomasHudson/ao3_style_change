Harry was staring at him now, his eyes wide and green and full of something too close to remorse, but Draco couldn't stand to see it. He turned his back on Harry, feeling raw and strangled and aching. He slammed the bathroom door on Potter's strangled shout; it sounded suspiciously like his name, but Draco wasn't listening anymore. He couldn’t hear anything but the pain that was echoing inside him.
. "I…" Potter seemed to struggle with himself for a moment before straightening his back and looking Draco straight in the eyes, the defiance back with full force. "Coddling doesn't make it any better. You're going to change and it's going to be painful. There's no use whining about it."
"And I know I'm horrible, but I'm supposed to be. I'm not supposed to cry over you. I'm not supposed to feel like I'm dying because you..." He clenched his eyes shut. "I'm not
.” Jones clarified. “As if he didn’t like you? As if, perhaps, someone told him not to? Someone like Severus Snape, perhaps?”
"Yeah, that wasn't an act," he sighed. "Don't get me wrong. I didn't like Umbridge, but it was really more inconvenient than anything."
"He'll be back," Potter answered. He sounded confident, but his eyes told a different story, casting an almost worried glance toward the fireplace before flashing back toward Lucius. It was the most emotion Lucius had ever seen Potter show. In fact, the boy looked terrible. He had dirt on his face, and a leaf in his messy raven hair, and he appeared to be missing some of his clothes. His face was ashen, sunken in, with dark green eyes that didn't just reflect Lucius' emotions back at him as they usually did. Potter actually looked... alive, Lucius realized with a start. He didn't look like the broken approximation of a person that usually walked around, he looked…
"Well, Sirius," Dumbledore said, continuing to smile. "I'll be off. I do hope you have a good rest of your summer." Sirius nodded distractedly as Dumbledore turned and strode down the street, looking as if he didn't have a care in the world.
"Harry, the first step of possession is understanding the person," Draco interrupted. "If you stop him from getting inside, then he'll never understand you, and if he never understands you then he'll never be able to control you. You'll be safe in at least one place."
“No,” Draco answered, his voice sharp now, and Harry couldn’t help the surge of triumph that surged through him at getting a reaction from Draco. Any reaction. “You’re wrong.”
"Oh, you know," he answered, checking his nails and buffing a particularly immaculate spot. "I've been busy."
"Don't stop," Harry told him, his voice raw and open. He had his eyes closed now, his glasses slipping down his nose. His right hand propped up by Draco's head, holding himself up, the other stroking along Draco's neck, his fingertips touching the scars there before falling lower to his chest, to his stomach, touching everywhere he could reach.
"Key, please," the goblin said, looking down at them suspiciously. And Bellatrix held her key out readily, her mind pushing sharply against Blaise's as the goblin took it from her. He supposed it was a good thing the goblin didn't really care if Bellatrix was here of her own free will or not.
"I've heard it before. At the beginning of the year. When Voldemort was here," Luna said, and Blaise widened his eyes at her, dread shooting through him at the very idea of Voldemort attacking Hogwarts again. Apparently, they had barely held him off last time.
Draco woke up on Christmas morning with no real enthusiasm or expectation. His parents only ever gave him presents if they believed he had done something particularly worthwhile. And that did not include sneaking to an order safe house under their and Umbridge's noses. Not that he really thought this was his fault, but he doubted they saw it that way. At least if the three howlers demanding he come home at
"Just so," Dumbledore answered, his eyes twinkling approvingly over at him. But Draco didn't want his approval. Not when the truth was that he had also reminded him of Dumbledore. The difference was that his father and Slughorn manipulated to help themselves while Dumbledore manipulated to help the world. Yet, somehow it didn't make it feel any better when he was the one being manipulated. Harry's emerald eyes flashed back to lock on his and Draco knew he understood what he was thinking, whether he agreed with him or not was another story. "I tell you this to put you on your guard, Harry. He will undoubtably try to collect you. You will be the jewel of his collection."
"Look, Cho," he said, pulling several galleons out of his pockets, "I really have to meet Hermione." He put them on the table, moving to stand. "It was nice hanging out with you, I'll see you later."
"Oh," Harry said, and he paused, turning toward Draco, staring with his green eyes half-confused and half-desperate and half-relieved, and somehow Draco just
"Y-yes, Merlin, D-Draco," Harry said, his bright green eyes turning up to focus on Draco. He jerked, looking down at Harry for a long moment. And then his muscles were tensing and he threw his head back and cried out as he came, thick white liquid shooting across Harry's stomach. Harry didn't move as Draco rode his orgasm out. He was shocked at himself. Never, never had he lost control of himself like that.
"Draco," his father's voice sounded behind him. Draco immediately stopped, restraining the urge to bite his lip. He knew once he started there would be blood and his parents hated when he drew blood with his nervous habits. Blood was much too precious to be wasted on such idle things.
Harry's heartbeat through the material of their robes, pattering along to match his own. Harry’s eyes were wide, his lips slightly parted, begging to be—
"And what is it you want?" he asked; Nott blinked over at him, looking shocked, as if he hadn't expected Severus to give in. After a minute, he managed to compose himself, but it was too late. Lucius was already studying Nott suspiciously, watching as Severus did the same.
Harry looked over where she was pointed and immediately looked away again. Ron was snogging in full view of the room with what looked to be Lavender Brown. Harry wondered vaguely just how that had happened, then he decided he really would rather not know.
find it odd in any case. I mean, what could they be doing out in the Forbidden Forest all night like that?"
He let his hand slide around to the back of Harry's neck and pulled him into another kiss. Harry kissed him back easily, opening his mouth as Draco slid his hand up and into his hair and- He tensed suddenly, his lips freezing against Draco's. He pulled his hand away from Harry's hair immediately, sliding it back down until he griped Harry by the shoulders, kissing gently until Harry was relaxing and opening back up to him.
"Oh, Merlin," Ron sighed, stepping up to him and taking hold of his arm, and the last thing Harry saw before they Disapparated was Hermione biting her lip.
Draco woke up before Lupin, feeling sore and stretched out across an unfamiliar part of the woods. He had no idea where his clothes were. No idea where
"What's going on with you and Lucius?" Harry asked, changing the subject as he turned toward him. And Severus knows he shouldn't. He shouldn't let Harry redirect the conversation, but he had never been able to get Harry to talk about things when he didn't want to. He doubted he was about to start.
He remembered Lupin pulling him aside the day after the school found out, asking if Draco needed anything, a concerned, serious look in his eyes that made Draco want to scratch his eyes out and tell him he wasn't made out of glass.
Professor Snape answered, and he gasped. They knew. They knew what The Dursleys had been doing to him. They were going to take him away from them, they were going to-
"Mr. Malfoy," Borgin said, standing and moving toward him. He resisted the urge to sigh; he knew how his father did business. Fear and intimidation. Borgin wouldn't help him unless he had to.
He cursed. It had to have been Dumbledore. The meddlesome fool had to have told the boy. Harry Potter couldn't have been clever enough to know, to figure it out. He paced; he wanted the boy dead. He should have killed the boy when he had the chance. He wouldn't make the same mistake again.
"We should get going." Hermione sighed after a long uncomfortable minute of silence. "It's almost curfew anyway."
But he still couldn't shake the feeling that he was giving something profound up by being here. By asking for Lupin's help. Like he was admitting he wasn't strong enough.
"What was that, Lupin?" He asked, resisting the urge to curl his lip. "I couldn't hear you over the toad in your throat. In fact, you're looking rather sickly, why don't you go… somewhere I'm not."
"You'll take up Defense Against the Dark Arts; Lucius will teach Potions," Severus said. "Though if you step one foot out of line, Lupin, we'll know, understand?" Lupin had the dignity to say nothing as he nodded.
"Severus said…" Harry trailed off, his cheeks flushing red as he looked off to the side. He looked horribly uncomfortable, and Draco realized with a shock that Harry was
"Yes, please," Harry answered, standing as she started to bound down the hall in the opposite direction of the entrance. They went a few feet down the hall before turning left and then right. They walked another couple minutes before Yanla stopped in front of a door that was just barely cracked. Inside Harry could hear the voices of two people talking. One person sounding particularly upset, and Harry only had to listen for a second before he recognized both Malfoy's and Johnson's voices.
Severus was just buttoning up his robes when the Floo lit up. Lucius lounged against Severus’ chair, his legs casually spread like he didn’t have his pureblood reputation to maintain as he looked across the room at Severus with half-lidded eyes. He was only wearing trousers and an unbuttoned shirt, his robes lost somewhere in the room. And for half an hour, Severus had allowed himself to really believe everything would work out.
It was several minutes before either one of them spoke; Draco somehow knew Harry needed to be the first to say something, so he stayed silent. Harry had his face turned away, his jaw clamped tight as Draco continued to watch him. Eventually, Harry sighed, releasing a tense breath Draco hadn't realized he was holding and turning to Draco with dark green eyes.
"Why do you care?" Harry's voice cut through Draco's, quiet and calm and Draco stopped, his anger draining out of him, leaving no trace to fuel the answer to the question that Harry had asked. The question that Harry deserved an answer to.
"Keep it down, will you?" Draco answered. "It was just a jinx on the coins. They were already connected, I just needed them to say something different then they normally would have."
"You're sure," Ginny asked again. Hermione could see Ron roll his eyes behind her, but she ignored him as she focused on Ginny. This was important; they needed to get this right. They needed to make sure Ginny was absolutely convinced, because if she wasn't convinced then she would never make her move.
"I don't know," Harry sighed and the cloth on his forehead disappeared. There was the sound of dripping water and then a freshly dampened cloth was placed on his head. Severus resisted the urge to moan at the feeling against his burning mind. "I wasn't here when you got back. You should have called."
He'd refused to help when Dumbledore had said there was a chance at saving Sirius Black. He didn't care if there was a chance. If it were up to him, he'd let Sirius Black be kissed. He'd send him back to Azkaban to rot. Maybe he didn't commit the crime he was accused of, but he was still guilty of plenty. So, Hermione had gone by herself, insisting that she couldn't stand by and do nothing. He supposed she had saved him, he'd never asked.
"I would ask how that's your business, but frankly I don't want to hear whatever nonsense you're going to come up with," he answered, and Lupin pursed his lips. He looked offended, but a least he was smart enough not to say anything.
“Are you even listening to me, Snape?” Scrimgeour snapped. He was sitting in the chair across from Severus, scowling as if he had any right to sit there and demand Severus’ attention for an unwarranted amount of time every week where he said the same things over and over.
“This is a shrivelfig. The book talks a lot about how the roots being aggressive allow the plant to live pretty much anywhere. It can survive even snow. It’s pretty amazing.” He leaned forward, tracing his finger on the image. “The leaves can also be brewed in…” he trailed off as he looked up, Blaise’s eyes shining. “What?”
“Draco-,” Harry started, but Draco interrupted him. He could feel the anger burning through him, Lupin’s words echoing in his mind, the red starting at the edge of his vision, the tightening of his muscles.
"It was like she really didn't want to be kissing me in the first place," Harry twirled his thumbs together thoughtfully. "Then when she stopped, she just started sobbing on me and…"
"What are we doing here?" Harry asked, too slowly, too carefully for Draco's tastes. He stepped close, ignoring the way Harry's back straightened and his hand tensed around Draco's. If he really had a problem, he would stop him. Draco hoped.
"Oh, anyway. We've all been talking, yes, and they've decided they need to split you up from Draco," Blaise said, and Potter's eyes darkened. He turned his head to the side, but Blaise still caught the flash of anger that burned in them.
"We cannot take him away from them," Professor Dumbledore answered and his heart sank. What a fool he was. "You know, the boy needs the blood wards."
"Oh, he's better now," Umbridge said, waving her hand indifferently. "For a few minutes, he wouldn't even sit up straight, drooling all over my chair as it were." She reached over her desk and took hold of her tea cup. "Now, Professor Snape, I'm very curious to know what you make of this whole situation."
"Enjoy your next trip to the woods," Theodore hissed when he passed, his lips so close to Draco’s ear, he knew Lupin and Pansy couldn’t have heard. Draco's back straightened as he stared after Theodore. He couldn't
"I've liked you since school, Harry," Malfoy said, and even though he was talking slowly, Harry couldn't do much more than stare at him, unable to process. Malfoy sighed again, running a tense hand through his hair. "I was a brat to you, because I was jealous you wouldn't pay attention to me, and when I heard you needed a consult from my department, I figured, why not? If you still hated me, at least I would know. At least, I'd be able to stop wondering what you would have done if I wasn't such an idiot to you."
"Really?" Severus answered, and his eyebrows raised in that disbelieving way that Harry hated. And he really just wanted to be left alone, but somehow, he knew that Severus wasn't going to do that. Not this time. No matter how hard Harry pushed.
"Are you cold?" he asked, running a hand down Harry's back. Most of the blood was down the drain, the warm water up to Harry's chest, but he was still trembling against his hands.
to love you, Harry Potter. But fuck you, I do, and I don't know how to keep going if you let yourself be taken over by
"And why not," Lucius snapped. "Why is now better than then?" He sneered, his fingers tightening dangerously around his tea cup.
Finally, Dumbledore arrived, almost appearing in the infirmary as if he'd been there all along. Though Professor Snape just made an impatient gesture shooing him around the door and out. He blinked after them, wanting to know what had happened. What had happened to Professor Quirrell? Had he, had he really…?
And Harry's last thought before he lost consciousness was that he hated the way Zabini looked at Draco. Then his head was falling back against the dirt, the pain and fear and relief too much to keep holding.
"Trying to crawl your way out of this, are you, boy?" Vernon said, spittle flying into his face. "Like you have been all summer. Well, I'll tell you what? You deserve this, boy, you know that, don't you?" he just looked at him as Vernon's hand tightened painfully in his hair. "Don't you?" he nodded, keeping his mouth firmly shut. "Good boy," Vernon's lips twisted, his hand pulling cruelly. "I bet I could just guess all the things you and that Professor of yours got up to," Vernon's hand tightened again and this time he couldn't keep the wince off his face. "Well, I think I'll help you never worry about him again." Vernon released his hair and he immediately fell to the ground, not daring to crawl away now. "In fact, no one will ever want to touch your used sorry arse every again, get me?"
"I think I’ll skip the Weasels family reunion, Potter?" he asked. Harry grimaced but nodded, dropping his wrist.
"Busy," Zabini sneered at him, the picture of righteous fury over how he was slighting Draco. He turned his face away, offending for Draco’s sake in a way that Harry could never be. "You're asking me to risk my life for your boyfriend, and you're not even going to tell me why you're so
They were in the middle of the corridor, the only light being Blaise's lit wand that cast shadows across the stone walls and frowning portraits. It was past curfew, and if anyone passed by they would be in definite trouble. Well, Potter wouldn't probably be in that much trouble what with all the rumors of how much he wandered the halls at night, but it
Draco jerked away, gasping for air and looking for all the world as if he had just committed some unforgivable crime.
Harry didn't see Draco anywhere during the day. He was never in the library, he was never in the corridors, he was never by the lake, and he was never with the rest of the Slytherins.
Draco's hand reached down under his pants, grasping himself. He pictured Harry with his emerald eyes fixed on him, eyes glazed and filled with lust and need. An expression he was sure no one else had ever seen.
"You said Dumbledore usually found them," Luna nodded, tilting her head at him knowingly. "Does this have to do with Voldemort?"
Yes, I know. *sigh* They're all idiot. Well, we should be seeing a little more fluff next chapter as things begin to tie themselves up!
"Why aren't we allowed to be happy, Draco?" Harry had asked, and right then, in that moment, Draco didn't know.
"Lucius," Dumbledore began, but Lucius was having none of it. His gaze shifted from Draco to Dumbledore, his emotionless mask almost gone in a blaze of horrible frustration. "Very well," Dumbledore sighed. He sent a message through the flu, summoning Severus and asking him to bring Potter as quickly as he could, though Draco had no delusions about either of them being cooperative about just coming running when they were called. Sure enough it took a horribly long time for them to show up and even when they did, they were not pleased.
The sensation of Draco's lips felt amazing against his skin, making him feel sensitive and whole, and he could almost forget what he'd asked. He knew it was Draco's intention to distract him, and he was half-tempted to just let it work.
"We've already talked to him about his recklessness," Severus hiss quietly, turning his dark angry gaze over to Harry, who just turned his face even further away from them. "Dragging other students into it as well."
"We're going to spend this lesson with Professor Snape trying to pierce your mind," Draco said. "Now, if you've been practicing all the techniques we've been working on, it should go well." He paused. "Have you had any dreams recently?" Harry bit his lip, and Draco checked his sigh of frustration. It's true, they were making some progress, but it was also true that they weren't making near enough.
But he didn’t know how. It had always been Draco who made the first move. It had always been Draco who encouraged. As idiotic as he knew it sounded, Harry wasn’t even sure if he was allowed. He knew
"You're no fun anymore, Draco." She sighed, latching an arm around his. He immediately sighed and tried to shake her off, but she refused to budge. It was as if she
"Maybe he was talking about Gringotts?" Hermione answered. She was pacing in front of him, a deep frown on her face as she held her wand so tightly, her fingers turning white.
Harry didn't look up at him when he swung the door open. He just continued to stare out onto the grounds of Hogwarts, his head slightly bowed. He looked bad; he looked almost as bad as Draco felt. He'd lost weight—which seemed impossible considering he'd already been almost skin and bones—and the bags under his eyes reflected Draco's own.
a different person than the one we knew in school," Hermione said confidently, eyeing Harry with a knowing look that he didn't want to try interpreting.
“It’s Head Auror Shacklebolt now,” Shacklebolt said, and Lucius could tell exactly what he was doing. He wanted Lucius to bow and scrape to him. He knew exactly the position Lucius was in, and he wanted Lucius to beg him for help.
Draco seeks an answer to his problems, Harry talks to a Mind-Healer, and Severus faces a new challenge.
"Really?" Harry snorted, his eyes never leaving Severus' face. "I find it easy. Perhaps you should try it before you doom yourself to an eternity of unrequited love with Lucius Malfoy."
"What are you so afraid of, Draco?" Harry asked. "Why can't you just trust me? I'm not going to hurt you. I almost
“What is this really about?” he asked, turning around. Severus’ face was tense, shadowed. It reminded Lucius of back when they were still serving under Voldemort. Back then Severus knew he had to hide everything he thought, everything he felt.
"Hello, Granger," he answered, narrowing his eyes suspiciously. She was taller than he remembered, her frizzy hair straighter and more styled with big brown eyes framed by long black lashes. She looked pretty. He supposed.
“Well, you weren’t listening,” Draco snapped, his voice huffing out between them. And he was visibly angry now, his eyes flashing as he faced across from Harry. And it wasn’t that Harry couldn’t tell—it wasn’t that he didn’t care. It was just that he didn’t understand.
"Don't make me say it again," Potter raised his eyes with a glare, his cheeks still flushed bright red. There was a strange light in his eyes, something startlingly close to panic. He hadn't thought Potter could feel fear. "Your clothes will just rip with the change anyway. At least this way you can get dressed afterward." Potter's face got steadily redder as he talked, his eyes flicking anywhere but at Draco.
"Yes," Potter's eyes narrowed even further. "And I noticed you did so much to help improve his condition," Lucius bit back his wince but Potter was talking again before he could say anything. "Well, if there was nothing else," Potter hinted, still not moving.
Harry stepped out of the bed, feeling around for his clothes. He stepped on his belt with a curse, and fumbled the trousers attached, struggling to get them on. He'd have to worry about his pants later. His shirt was hanging on the dresser, and he didn't even want to think about how it had ended up there; he didn't
He had been half-afraid that Harry regretted what had happened, but then he'd caught a glimpse of Harry's morning wood right before he'd shut the bathroom door in Draco's face, and it had all made sense. Not that he was particularly happy about his boyfriend's reaction to waking up with him, but at least he could understand it.
"What?" Draco snapped, turning toward him, half-convinced he'd lost his mind. Even Granger was staring at him with a shocked expression, and it was clear that she hadn't expected him to agree so easily or maybe at all.
“I know you’re probably thinking this is stupid or something, but it’s not,” Draco said, his eyes silver-grey and intense, and Harry could only stare back at him. “I think this is important.”
"And Severus," Draco said. "There's one more thing." Severus raised an eyebrow, silently asking for Draco to continue. "I want to join the Order of The Pheonix." He was almost proud that his voice didn't shake.
He headed down to the dungeon about as quickly as his pride allowed. Mostly, he hurried because he knew Severus would have his arse if he slowed enough that Draco Malfoy actually died. For, Severus cared about the Malfoy's even if Harry didn't.
"They guessed," Harry answered, his eyes flicking to Severus as if he could sense he was upset. Severus let out a breath, moving closer to pull the locket out of Harry's fingers. To his surprise Harry didn't move away from him, made no attempt to avoid touching him. It was… strange. Strange enough to send a blast of warmth through Severus' stomach when he brushed his fingers against Harry's shoulder, and Harry still didn't move away, only looked up at him with unreadable green eyes.
"I didn't bring you here to explain myself to you,” Draco answered. “I brought you here to tell you what was going on." Granger raised an eyebrow. "Umbridge's in complete control. She's started this student led group called the Inquisition Squad. We're allowed to take points, assign detentions, pretty much anything."
"Good morning," Lucius smiled thinly, looking a little too pleased with himself. Severus just rolled his eyes as he followed him into the room.
Fortunately, he heard a loud grunt from below him and managed to grab the Thestral's neck before he fell. As he looked back at Luna's wide-eyed expression, everything came rushing back to him.
"I—because—I was asking what you were hiding,” Harry answered, turned his green eyes resolutely on him, and Severus could tell by his expression that the matter was closed.
"Almost late, Malfoy." His captain, Montague, threw him a dirty look before leading the team out and onto the pitch.
"Well, that was interesting," Granger said, casting Draco a speculative look. He curled his lip, ready to insult her and her bloodline and her hair, but Harry's hand on his thigh had turned dangerously tight, and he stopped himself.
"What?" Lucius couldn't stop the startled laugh from escaping. "No. We married because our parents wanted it," Lucius sighed heavily. "We married, because I thought you didn't want me."
"How did you know….?" Ron gapped and then scrambled in the hole after him. Harry continued to ignore him, heading straight for Draco's room. "Harry," Ron said, his voice a hushed whisper in the deathly quiet of the common room. "Harry, have you lost your mind?" Harry pushed open Draco's dorm room door, grasped his shoulders, and shook him, hard.
And what were they rowing about? Was Dumbledore on Draco's case about keeping secrets? Then why had he shoved Harry's concerns aside as if they didn't matter? It didn't make sense.
When Severus broke away from him, they were both panting, Severus’ breath fanning across his face as he mouthed at Lucius’ cheek, his jaw, his collarbone. His other hand lowered down, fumbling with Lucius’ trousers and pants and taking entirely too long to get them off. He lifted his hips, shoving them down and turning his head away when Severus almost hit him in the eye with his forehead. Then they were pressing themselves together again. Severus was completely naked while Lucius still had on his white shirt. He moved his hands to the buttons, but Severus grabbed his wrists, pressing them against the floor.
Honestly, he didn't much care. He couldn't stop thinking about everything that had happened. The castle nearly being destroyed; his mad dash through the first floor; almost being eaten by a giant snake. If these were the things Harry did all the time, Blaise didn't blame him for being an arse. Well, he didn't blame him as
He looked back for Severus to see Beth kicking and screaming silently, struggling in his arms, making it impossible for him to start moving. Lucius called out, his voice getting lost in the water, and he could see the Giant Squid start moving toward Severus again, its tentacles propelling it faster than should have been possible.
"Jasmine Brad-," the woman sighed, running a hand over her face. "I don't know a Bradbury. I'm looking for my father. He's been missing for a couple days now, and I found this key in his things. I thought…" she sighed, shrugging, and Harry looked over at Malfoy, watching as his grey eyes sharped in that way he was coming to understand meant Malfoy was putting the pieces together.
"I… Look, it was nothing, ok?" Blaise was scooting around Draco now, making his grand escape. Draco was just watching him, not bothering to move and stop him. As soon as Blaise was on the other side of Draco, he turned on his heel and took off down the corridor.
"Severus," Lucius' other hand left the desk, tilting Severus' head up to look at him. "Do you really not want this?" He hesitated, and though his face never lost its confidence, his voice gave him away. Soft and careful and utterly defenseless. "Tell me to leave, and I will. I'll leave, and I won't bother you again."
"I…uh, water," Longbottom said finally, which didn't make a whole lot of sense, but then, the boy was a Gryffindor, and he hadn't been picked for his smarts. He turned away, moving rapidly toward the table of refreshments. To Draco's astonishment, he only tripped once too.
didn't think he could watch Draco walk away from him. Draco thought Harry was brave, but he was wrong.
Harry gasped against Draco's mouth. He gasped at the taste of Draco—sweet and coppery in his mouth—at the feel of his body—hard lines and muscles pressed all along Harry's—of his hands—gentle and caressing along his back. He let his hands slide up, winding in soft blonde hair. He was careful not to pull, not to clutch, not to… He shuddered and directed his thoughts abruptly away from that line of thought.
"Is there a point to this?" Draco asked, wishing Blaise would just get the hint already. He hadn’t exactly been subtle when he’d ignored Blaise during the beginning of the year feast.
"Why would you need those?" Hermione asked, leaning forward. Draco swept them back under his cloak before she could take a closer look.
In all honestly, Lucius probably went too fast, moving from one finger to two fingers as Severus squirmed under him, his hands yanking Lucius long blonde hair until he could feel it tangling over his shoulder. But it didn’t exactly matter when Severus was shoving down against him, his lips pressed to Lucius’ sternum with a whispered murmur of being ready even though Lucius really
"He'll have scars," Severus said finally, and Lucius felt himself relaxing, finally about to breathe again. And then Severus was turning to look at him, dark eyes blazing and furious.
Somehow, Malfoy ended up on top, straddling Harry's waist with legs held down by ankles and feet. He had his slim fingers wrapped around Harry's wrists held firmly above his head and his forehead was pressed to Harry's chest, breathing heavily.
“There was someone....” Harry said. He hesitated, but Woods’ lips curled, and she seemed sure. “Albus Dumbledore,” he said, ignoring the collective gasp that went around the room. “He knew I was being abused and did nothing.” And again, there were other things he could say.
to Malfoy until tomorrow. After all, Malfoy would still need to go over the case, make sure he knew the facts, get the details. He'd only gotten the file last night, while Harry had had it for over a week.
Madame Pomfrey's eyes had widened when she'd seen him. She'd pointed her wand at him, reaching between his legs to assess the damage and he'd lost it. He'd screamed—not sane screaming either. Horrible, disembodied screaming that came from deep in his chest and echoed through the infirmary and down the hall. Severus had taken him away immediately, glaring at Pomfrey as if the whole thing had been her fault. He'd calmed down as soon as they made it to Severus' private rooms, breathing the familiar scent and pushing the pain away as Severus examined him while touching him as little as possible.
Draco had left for the bathroom thirty minutes ago and gotten caught by some woman with bright blonde hair who gestured louder than she spoke. He’d cast a look at Harry to save him, but Harry wasn’t going over there unless there was mortal danger.
"And if I do?" Harry asked the floor and he could feel Severus' eyes boring into the top of his head.
Harry lay under him, legs sprawled, body eager, eyes wide, and his mind was so clouded with lust that he forgot to be gentle. That he forgot to pause when Harry’s hands gipped his arms tight enough for him to feel the nails. That he forgot to ask if he should continue when Harry cried out, and he was suddenly inside Harry’s heat, and he couldn’t stop himself because of the primal voice inside of him whispering that Harry was his to claim.
"Where?" Draco answered. They both ignored him as Lovegood started pacing back and forth, muttering something under her breath as she went. Harry watched her with a dark expression. His green eyes were drawn with deep shadows under them from nights of not sleeping. His clothes hung off his frame an uncomfortable amount.
When the weekend of the Hogsmeade trip rolled around, Draco hadn't really been planning on going. He was busy; Merlin, he was always busy. But when Harry had mentioned it so casually and looked over at him with his green eyes smiling and warm, Draco had only been able to nod and smile thinly.
Footsteps sounded down the corridor and Draco snapped away from Harry, panting in a way that was hardly appropriate. Harry glanced in the direction of the footsteps and then grabbed Draco by his wrist and dragged him across the hallway and into an abandon classroom, slamming the door behind them.
Of course, that moment was when Weasley and Granger decided it was the best time to have a heart to heart.
"I could have figured that out myself," Draco answered. Harry just looked at him, and Draco almost apologized, wondering if he'd done something wrong again. Something stopped him though, some look in the back of Harry's eyes told him that apologizing would just make it worse.
"Are you alright?" Dumbledore asked, pressing a comforting hand between his shoulders. "The sensation does take some getting used to."
"Then we'll figure it out together," Draco answered, and his tone had Harry tilted his head to the side, looking over at him. Draco stroked a hand down Harry's back, feeling Harry relax as he did.
“I have to finish this,” Ginny said, standing abruptly. She picked her textbook and parchment up, wrapping it up in her arms as she stomped away.
," Draco interrupted, dropping his hand. Harry’s eyes were shining, somewhere between desperate and pleading, and Draco wished he could just tell him everything would be perfectly fine. "But it hasn't happened yet
“It has nothing to do with Potter and the young Draco Malfoy’s failing relationship?” Scrimgeour asked, his eyes blazing with triumph.
Then again it wasn't much better when he was awake. He couldn't stop himself from remembering the Department of Mysteries and the prophecy that had taken up residence in his mind. The prophecy that had cost him... No, they were never meant to be in the first place. That was the thought he kept in the front of his mind. That they were never meant to be in the first place. He repeated it to himself when he felt the pain start to sprout claws in his chest. They were never meant to be in the first place. There was never anything either of them could have done. And yet, the prophecy still followed him around, promising him that he would never have a normal life.
"But—" Harry started, but a loud crash from the hallway interrupted him. Harry and Draco exchanged a nervous look before bolting to the door. Sirius Black had his wand drawn on Severus, roaring something about being a coward while Severus stood there, calm as night and looking at him as if he had lost his mind. "Sirius!" Harry shouted, "Sirius, NO!" He promptly stepped between the two men, putting himself in the path of any hostile spells that might be cast.
“Doesn’t unrequited love bother you?” Blaise answered, and Neville frowned, a tiny crease appearing between his eyebrows. Blaise dug his fingers into the palms of his hands, forcing himself to keep them still.
Harry shoved Draco back, sending him stumbling back. He yelped, scrambling for purchase, but Harry was yanking away from him, letting Draco fall against the damp ground with a startled sound.
"Possibly," Borgin answered, shifting his feet and looking as if he wasn't about to commit himself to anything. And Draco didn't want to do it. He didn't even want to be here, touching this cabinet or looking at Borgin at all, but it was something he’d known he had to do as soon as he’d left his house with Dumbledore. He’d given up his chance to say no. "I'll need to see it, though. Why don't you bring it to the shop?"
"I don't have a girlfriend," he didn't know why he said it. He could have just shrugged and nodded; he'd done it before when someone he didn't like was coming onto him, and it was clear from the way Malfoy's grey eyes flicked down his form and then back up that Malfoy was coming onto him. But this seemed important. It seemed important to make it clear that Harry was not taken.
"I…" He hesitated, biting down hard on his lip. He tasted blood on the tip of his tongue and immediately stopped. Malfoy's did
"I have given you plenty of information for today," Lucius almost hissed, though he controlled the urge. "Now, I want my guarantees."
"Harry won't believe them. He says you won't hurt him, that he can trust you. I've no idea what you've done to convince him but Harry's usually a pretty good judge of character," she said, and Draco snorted, covering his mouth from the undignified response. Granger just raised an eyebrow and continued. "I don't know why you two are fighting but—"
"I love Harry," he answered. It was the only answer Draco had. As true as it was, it felt so inadequate to everything that was going on. Hadn't
And they were so close, Harry's green eyes wide with shock as he leaned over her, and she put her hands along his cheeks, pulling him down until she was kissing him. And somewhere vaguely, he registered Hermione muttering something about looking for the other Aurors before disappearing.
"What if you don't and Weasley and Granger actually succeed?" Blaise answered. "Do you really want to lose Draco over something stupid like that? At least with me, you know what to look for." Potter's eyes narrowed marginally. "It should be enough right now that I'm on your side, and I'm here to help."
“Severus…” he groaned, his voice high pitched and gasping as Severus thrust into him. “Please, please. I need… please.” Severus seemed to understand what he was saying, because he was wrapping his hand around Lucius’ cock, stroking him in time to his thrusts, and it took an embarrassingly short amount of time before Lucius was cuming across his own stomach and shirt.
"No?" Lupin's eyebrows rose absurdly high. "No strange desires? No aggression that strikes you suddenly? No unusual instincts that you didn't have before?" Lupin asked, and Draco bared his teeth, which didn't exactly refute Lupin's claims.
He spent his whole break in the room of requirement, working on the cabinet and taking notes all the while. When the bell rang for double potions, he turned away and made his way out, heading down the stairs and into the dungeons.
Then he was turning, walking down the hallway and leaving Draco staring after him. Though Draco didn’t miss the unspoken, ‘even if I’m not’ about his speech.
Lucius hadn't told Severus about Harry. Not that Severus was talking to him anyway. He'd told Lucius he loved him and then promptly shoved him out, locking the door behind him and refusing to see him. Potter adamantly refused to interfere no matter what Lucius said to him.
"Something you may have forgotten to mention the first time you were interviewed?" Malfoy said, his voice low and Harry could hear the accusation, half-hidden. It was obvious from the way Bisham sat up straight in her chair that she could too.
"Draco," Lupin turned to him, wearing that same determined expression he'd worn when he'd been saying he was only trying to help. And again, Draco didn't know what to do. He couldn't actually
"Yes, yes," Adarins answered, waving his hand vaguely. That annoying smile still in place. "Congratulation. I mean, aside from the fact that it's just a tad unprofessional to get married to your subordinate. But still, best wishes."
"Is it true?" she asked, stopping a good five feet from him. Much further than she usually chose to stand from anyone.
“I needed to know,” Draco answered, his voice just as dark, angry. And Harry felt a savage kind of satisfaction shoot through him.
"Severing Charm," Lucius sighed. He fumbled at Harry's robes; there were two slashes cutting across his chest, making a sort of parallel lines. They were deep, bleeding heavily, and Lucius had no doubt that Bellatrix would had modified them in some way to be extra painful or not heal easily.
"What's going on?" Draco asked, looking into the potions classroom to see Harry, Lucius, and Severus gathered around one of the cauldrons. There was steam coming out the top, bubbling acidic green steam that Draco recognized fairly quickly as the poison that Severus and his father had been working on for the past month or so. The poison they were hoping would destroy Horcruxes.
"Why don't we come back tomorrow?" he said. Lovegood looked up from where she'd been working a little way away, humming over a jewelry box.
"As far as I know," Borgin answered. He shifted and cleared his throat as if he was about to admit something that made him mildly uncomfortable. "But I don't know where the other cabinet is, or if it even works."
"Harry!" Granger's voice said, and then she was there, slamming into Harry and hugging him before he could protest. His arms went around her as the hoard of red-haired Weasleys appeared. Granger stepped back, and the Weasleys took turns hugging Harry.
"Harry, relax." McGonagall said, eyeing him warily. He started like a frightened animal and then made a show of relaxing the tension from his shoulders. This always made people believe he was comfortable in their presence even though it was nothing more than a guise. The only one who had ever seen through the trick had been Severus.
"It has my name on it," he answered, his hand closing around the sphere with a strange click of finality. It was warm under his fingers, slightly buzzing as if answering his touch. Nothing happened, there was no mass explosion or people coming to arrest him by dropping from the ceiling. Instead, his friends pushed closer toward him, trying to get a closer look at the sphere he held between his hands.
The rest of the ride wasn't so bad. Surprisingly it was Longbottom who took the longest to warm up, though Blaise had the feeling it was because he was actually shy and not because he thought Blaise was evil. The Gryffindors on a whole weren't
"Stop staring and eat your food, Potter," Draco hissed, and he hoped Potter had a nasty bruise on his shin. Harry looked over at Hermione, who—bless her—narrowed her eyes and frowned at him.
"Do you have any idea how I felt when you immobilized me?" he asked, and Harry's back hit a wall, cutting off what little escape there had been. Draco just kept coming, his silver-grey eyes locking Harry in place more effectively than the wall ever could.
"So, when Voldemort killed you…" Draco trailed off, his silver-grey eyes flicking over Harry's face.
He walked through the large space, finding his way easily now that he knew what he was looking for. He'd found the cabinet by accident too. He'd thought it was interesting that it was the exact copy of the one in Borgin and Burkes but hadn't given it a second thought until Voldemort had shown up at his house and demanded…
"Oh, of course, Professor, of course," Nott answered, emphasizing the words in a way that made it clear that he really didn't agree with Severus at all. "But then don't you think it's odd that they both disappear every time the moon's full?" Severus froze, and Nott's smile was large and ugly. "
Harry stared across the entryway of Malfoy Manor, taking in the dried blood smeared across the floor, the dent where Greyback had evidently fallen, the scratches born into the walls. He bit his tongue so he wouldn’t shiver; this wasn’t about him. It wasn’t about his reaction.
"Very well," Umbridge said, her voice sickly sweet. "Very well, Mr. Potter… I have offered you a chance to tell me freely. You refused. I have no alternative but to force you. Theodore—fetch Professor Snape."
“Making out on a couch doesn’t count as a date,” Draco answered, his voice sharp, annoyed. Harry just sighed at him. Why did it matter? Why did they have to go around clutching at each other and pretending Harry was some normal-
"He cast a charm on it," Severus said, his fingers so tight around the locket, his hand was turning white.
"Let's go," Hermione whispered, leading him toward the Slytherin common room. He quietly whispered the password before they stepped inside. It was disserted because of the 'gas attack' with half eaten food and books strewn across the floor. Harry pulled the cloak off, folding it over his arm and stepping away from Hermione.
"Who do you think you are?" Harry asked, and he knew he didn't imagine the way his voice echoed with anger. The hurt cleansing kind of anger that felt so good and hurt so much. The kind of anger that he hadn't felt in so long and felt all the time. "That just because I listened to you once, you think you can come into our lives and tell the world our secrets?"
"Yes, well," Hermione answered. "We're allowed to bring guests to this one, so maybe this is a good excuse to speak to Draco again."
"Of course not, but I can't just give The Dark Lord whatever he wants," Severus said, and Harry's hands clenched down on the chair. They were tight for one second, two, and then they relaxed, and Harry exhaled.
"Just…" Malfoy shifted against Harry's desk, making it wobble under him. He didn't seem to notice. "It feels so messy." Harry wondered vaguely if Malfoy knew all this just from his training or if he'd been taught growing up. Surprisingly, there weren't that many purebloods in Dark Art Retrieval, and a lot of the other Departments considered them odd, strange. He supposed their strange dress code was at least one thing that fit with the ministry rumor of how they were indeed strange.
"I don't need to do anything," Harry interrupted. Sirius opened his mouth to say something else but then closed it again with a snap. His face went pale and when Harry blinked, his head was gone from the flames. In its place was a hand reaching around in the flames.
"Draco!" Lupin called, stopping in front of them. "Harry!" Harry scowled next to him, staring at Lupin suspiciously even as Draco felt himself relax.
"I am sorry for your loss, Mr. Malfoy," Dumbledore said. "Though I still do not quite understand what has brought you to us?"
someone to step outside and curse him. Probably that's exactly what he wanted. As long as it was Harry. As long as Harry looked at him again.
"Oh, I think I know exactly what you two were doing," Black answered, his voice hard and full of shock, and Draco would have laughed at Black's expression if he didn't feel like killing himself for letting them get caught like this.
"Potter has a tendency to break everything he touches. You fall for him and it might just be the last thing you end up doing,” Severus said, and Draco opened his mouth to protest but found he couldn’t. He didn’t know how to argue with something he’d already warned himself of.
Weasley sat down next to Longbottom, right across from Harry, who was finally sitting down, but still hadn't looked away from her face. Draco kicked him under the table. Hard.
“Finally,” Lucius sighed. And it wasn’t hard to notice that Severus still wasn’t wearing his ring; it was still probably sitting on the desk in the headmaster’s office—untouched. As if he hadn’t said yes to Lucius. “They stopped by Honeydukes on the way, I think.”
"Oh, Mr. Malfoy!" Borgin called. Draco froze with his hand on the door. "I was sorry to hear about your mother. Poor soul." Draco turned his head to look at the man. He knew it was wrong, so wrong to relish in the way Borgin flinched at his glare, dropping his gaze and looking anywhere but him.
Harry, Blaise, and Luna continue with their plan to enter Gringots while Lupin goes through the full moon with Draco.
“Nothing is wrong with me,” Draco snapped. He started to step away, and anger shot through Harry. “I just want you to leave me alone.”
Lucius didn't know what he'd been expecting to find. Certainly, not what he did find. But then he supposed it was to be expected. Because of course, Harry would find the most dangerous way to break into Gringotts possible, by
Harry was staring at him, his green eyes wide and open and as vulnerable as Draco had ever seen them. It sent a rippling spasm straight through his chest. Merlin, Harry was
Harry learned that the Ministry was officially dropping the charges against Sirius, spouting some nonsense about having known all along he wasn't to blame. They'd also officially accepted the idea that Voldemort had indeed returned, going back to praising Harry as the Boy Who Lived and naming him once again as their savior.
"I told you it wasn't any good to talk to him like that," Weasley said. "Malfoy's got his claws in good, the bastard."
"Alright," Hermione agreed, sounding about as reluctant as one could get. He smiled thinly at her but made no other reply.
"Let him go, Lupin," Harry said, his voice horribly close to pleading. "Please, just… Voldemort doesn't want him, please. You don't have to do this. Just let him go, and I'll-."
That was until he heard the yelling coming from across the hall. At first, he was determined to ignore it. Until he realized it was Harry's voice yelling. Then it wasn't really an active
"As you wish," Snape said. "I shall take my leave then, Headmistress." With that, he turned as if to sweep out of the room.
"Where's Potter?" a large, scarred man with a ridiculous bowler hat covering a magical eye asked. Draco instantly recognized him as Mad-Eyed Moody. Draco's finger began tapping against his thigh, pushing the memories of being turned into a ferret and bounced to the back of his mind. It hadn't even actually
He tried to pull away, but there was nowhere to go, and the panic rushed through him, cold and strong. He yanked his mouth away, pushing weakly, but Draco either didn't notice or didn't understand.
expect to find him in his private rooms. And yet Harry was perched on his bed, his feet folded underneath him with his head ducked down, letting his hair hide his face. He looked like he did all those times he crawled into Severus' rooms in the middle of the night because he's had a nightmare and couldn't stop crying. Severus shook his head to dispel the image; Harry hadn't cried in years.
"It's already a problem, Severus," Lucius' eyes narrowed, and he leaned forward, placing his one hand on the desk as he stared. "Why don't you let me help you?"
“Harry, I want you to do something for me,” she said. He glared across at her. “I want you to think of 10 things you love and 10 things you hate.”
"Stop looking at me like that, Lucius," Severus said. Lucius immediately dropped his eyes and turned his head away, looking anywhere but at Severus. He should have known better than to forget himself.
to be Harry's family…. Then Harry was 11, shoving away Draco's hand with something close to disgust, as he silently thought of how Draco's superior attitude had reminded him of his horrible, hateful cousin. Draco shivered, no wonder Harry had rejected him… Then Harry was in the hospital ward, sitting beside Hermione, holding her hand as they waited for the failed cat Polyjuice to wear off and Draco blinked at the strange rose tint that invaded that memory. There was nothing particularly special about it, except that Harry was content simply because he was with a friend. And for the first time, Draco realized that maybe Harry knew something about happiness and love that he didn't…. Harry was standing on the edge of a lake, the only defense between a hundred dementors and his Godfather. No concern for his own safety. Harry only wanted to protect Sirius Black, even though he had wanted the man dead not 12 hours ago. And Draco's heart throbbed as he realized that Harry
"I—Well." Umbridge’s face crinkled up for a long moment before she seemed to regain her composure. She turned to Draco, a wicked gleam in her eye. "Well, Draco. You're the one who brought Potter here. Was he involved?" The gleam grew in her eyes. "You're also the one who was spying on him since the beginning, are you telling me, there
"You don't need to act like this, Harry," she said, and she was stepping closer; her eyes still hard on him, almost gentle now. And she was reaching for him, and the very
"Are you in a relationship with Harry Potter?" Umbridge asked immediately, leaning forward eagerly. Ah, Veritaserum then.
He remembered Draco turning his face away when Snape insulted him, refusing to even look at him. Harry twisted the silver and emerald ring around his finger, feeling the familiar twist of his heart. He had no idea how to get rid of that closed off look on his face.
"That's why you and Harry don't like each other," Draco said, and Lupin started, blinking over at him.
like doing this." He rammed his hips down and Harry moaned loudly as their groins connected again. "Are you going to stop me again?" Harry shook his head weakly. "Good." Malfoy rocked his hips back and then forward again, his fingernails scrapping along the skin of Harry's wrists, and Harry cried out in half-pain, half-pleasure.
"It's not uncommon," Potter answered, his eyes flickered up to Draco's face and locking on his eyes as if he was looking for something.
Severus had blinked up at him, his dark eyes wide and full of surprise. And he knew he should move; he should disentangle himself and apologize and stand and maybe just walk away and preserve some of his dignity, but he couldn't do anything but sit and stare as he sat with his legs tangled and Severus practically in his lap.
It had been his third year, and he had been stuck under the Womping Willow, and he'd been standing in front of Lupin and Sirius and listening to them try and defend themselves. It had been pitiful really, the way they'd talked. The way they'd insisted that Sirius was innocent. He supposed he was supposed to care. He was supposed to stand up and love his godfather and realize that he would have been there for him if he could have.
make him look forward to what was coming next. "Think Draco would mind if we played with him a little?" He shivered, trying to rise to his feet.
Malfoy was here. He'd watched Parkinson leave with Crabb and Goyle and a disgruntled expression. The bastard was hiding.
“The problem is that we don’t have a solid enough defense for the accusation of Headmaster Snape’s relationship with Mr. Potter,” Woods said. Severus kept his head down, his hands clasped together on top of the table. This whole thing was so exhausting. He wanted to be back at Hogwarts, wrapped around Lucius. He wanted to be getting married. He wanted to not regret to way he’d let Harry stay so close to him for so many years. Harry had needed him, and that shouldn’t have made him look guilty, but few things about his life had been fair.
"And you, Draco," Dumbledore said, turning to him. Draco looked back, shifting warily in his seat as if he half expected Dumbledore to attack him. "I owe you a much more severe apology. I should never have let my guard down enough that Lucius was able to get his hands on you. I should have foreseen that Lord Voldemort would see and use your connection with Harry. I am truly sorry for what you've suffered." Draco turned his face away and cleared his throat before speaking as if no one had ever apologized to him. After seeing the horrible way that his father treated him, Harry could just believe it.
Instead, he found them heading toward Honeydukes, which was much more Draco's style. His love of chocolate hadn't been near as affected as his sense of humor over the summer.
"You don't know that," Draco answered. "And it's better than bumbling around hoping he figures it out, which in case I need to point out, he hasn't."
"You go around egging the woman on and you don't even know the consequences?" One of Draco's hands raised to pinch the bridge of his nose. Harry was fascinated by the motion, he'd never seen Malfoy do that before. He frowned, he’d really never seen Malfoy anything but scornful or blank. It was strangely appealing.
Harry paced in front of the Slytherin dorm. It was the middle of the night, and he was under his invisibility cloak, but he still felt like he was taking some horrible leap forward. He knew Draco was inside, he even knew which room. He'd only checked the Maurader's map a hundred times on his way down here. But he couldn’t strike up the courage to go in. He didn't even know why he kept coming down here.
I say?" When he raised his head, just a fraction, just enough for Harry to see his face. His eyes were rimmed red, gaze locked on Harry with a shocked, guilty, relieved expression that Harry
"Let's just have a drink, Horace," Dumbledore asked, his eyes sparkling with mischief. "For old time's sake?"
"It won't work," Draco told him, his lips twisting in a cold sneer. "Dumbledore's not stupid." Nott smiled, his teeth gleaming against the low lights of the bathroom. He was just opening his mouth to say something else when the door clicked open. His wand came down fast, tucking itself into his sleeve, and Draco swiveled to look toward the door.
The fire started in his throat and then spread down into his chest and spiraled through his lungs and pumping its way through his veins and up into his head, engulfing his mind in burning molten lava that was making its way down into his fingertips and toes.
"Aha!" Umbridge exclaimed as if she had planned their entrance. "You see, he's been caught in the act!"
He leaned forward, his breath ghosting across Harry's face. And then Harry turned abruptly toward him, and he didn't know who kissed who, but they were suddenly kissing, and it wasn't the chaste innocent kisses they'd shared before. Harry almost immediately opened his mouth for Draco, his hand fisting around Draco’s while his other hand hovered nervously in the air around his shoulder for a heartbeat before it latched on.
“Sirius was my mate,” Lupin answered, and he too sounded animalistic, mad, and Draco wondered how he had missed the undercurrent of insanity in his voice all this time.
Draco rounded the table, sliding around Weasley and into the booth next to Harry. He was almost surprised. He didn’t think the Golden Gryffindor kept anything for his posse, but if he needed any proof that they didn’t know about Harry and him, he was looking at it.
"And I care because…." Potter asked, raising an eyebrow as if he really didn't. Lucius couldn't stop himself from blinking. Potter just smirked and crossed to the door.
"Of course not," Lupin sighed. "That year was complicated. It was the year Sirius escaped from Azkaban, and I made mistakes. I should have told Harry he was at Hogwarts. I should have done a better job trying to help him understand, but well, it doesn't matter now."
"Tell me the truth, Harry," he said. "I deserve it." And Harry stared at him for a long minute, seeming so open. All his emotions playing across his face in a way Draco had never seen before.
The door slammed open with a bang, and Professor Snape swept in, his face set in harsh lines of anger and retribution. Professor Snape stopped before his bed, taking a minute to study his face.
They had been forced to stay at Hogwarts for the summer since Severus was forever on call from Voldemort and no one trusted him in a house by himself. He hadn't particularly cared either way. Stuck alone in Severus' manor house or stuck alone in Hogwarts. It didn't make much of a difference to him.
He stepped forward, putting his hand along the wall and pushing with his palm as if it would move. Then he sighed, turning in a full circle and seeing nothing but the same stone walls all around him. He was in some kind of stone pit. The floor had gone out from under him when he'd tripped the wire, and he hadn't been quick enough to avoid falling. He had no idea where his wand was.
"Harry, please," Dracona whispered, and Harry finally, managed to open his eyes, staring into silver-grey eyes and feeling all the fool for every thinking he could find beauty anywhere else.
"Is this about the paper I assigned you this week?" Lupin asked, but Draco could tell by the way he tilted his head that he knew that wasn't the case. He wondered vaguely why Lupin was being dense. Did he really want to hear Draco say why he was here so badly?
"Come on, Hermione," Ron grabbed her arm, always eager to leave Harry alone with someone who wasn't Draco. She gave Harry one last concerned look but let Ron pull her out.
And eventually it paid off, he found the Grey Lady the same way he'd found her before. The usually frequented places that contained knowledge, places that were lively. He checked the Gryffindor tower, the teacher's offices, and the library before he eventually found her perched on a window seal overlooking the grounds of Hogwarts.
"Ooh," Pansy said, clinging to Draco's arm. "Look at that!" She pointed to a pretty necklace in one of the Hogsmeade shops that he had to admit would match her eyes nicely.
Even with the wounds gone thanks to Severus' wand work, Harry was still covered in blood, trembling as Draco led him into his room. After Voldemort had died, Severus had led Harry outside, closing the gashes across his chest and checking him for other wounds while Lucius and Draco had moved to put out the Fiendfire.
It was just… He cared about Draco. He cared, and how could he condone being the cause of Draco’s life being imploded. No matter how conflicted he had been about Draco and Potter being together, he knew when he needed to take a step back. Because at least with Potter, Draco wasn’t alone. And as a Werewolf, if Draco was with Blaise, he would always be alone.
"Mr. Malfoy, without seeing it, I must say it will be a very difficult job, perhaps impossible." Borgin licked his lips. He looked nervous. Draco wished he was even more nervous. He wished he was nervous enough that Draco didn't have to make any veiled threats. "I couldn't guarantee anything."
She tried to get herself under control, but it still took a couple more minute before she was able to do it, smiling hysterically at something Draco still didn't—and probably couldn't—understand.
hoping no one would ask them any questions. He wasn't the best with unforgivable—with reason—and he really hoped he managed to keep her in check as they made their way through.
"Why didn't you slap the bint?" he asked finally, and Harry was struck by the absolute Draconess of the question. And it hurt that he was barely 5 feet away, talking to Hermione and not Harry. That Draco was shoved in a cubby where people stopped to snog with Hermione and not Harry. And he almost stepped forwards and shoved the two of them apart right then, but Hermione's next question stopped him.
"Harry!" Dracona wrenched forward, automatically trying to stand, but the chains around her wrists yanked her back and kept her firmly seated.
"You won't be sharing with me?" Draco answered, only half joking. The idea of letting the idiot out of sight sounding mildly distressing at the moment.
"Yes, and I think this was me doing a fairly decent job of admitting how idiotic that was," Draco answered, crossing until he could lean against a wall to stare. Harry just blinked, and Draco decided to take pity on him.
"The Ministry is at your back, you have a rogue werewolf as a student, you're a known Death Eater, and you have a known Death Eater on your staff. There's no Dumbledore to protect you anymore," Lupin said, and Harry resisted the urge to snort. As if Dumbledore had done much of that for any of them.
"Wonderful," Malfoy answered, looking as if didn't mean it at all. "Thank you." The waiter gave him a curious look before nodding and heading away.
"He's good for you," Severus said, his lips pressed in a line as if it was hard for him to say. And Harry could only stare at him. "Draco," Severus said, gesturing with one hand. "He's good for you."
By some strange turn of luck, the Gryffindors had won the cup, turning Pansy into some kind of annoyed monster that snapped at anyone who came too near to her. At least, that gave Draco an excuse to avoid her. He wasn't complaining. He needed all the time he could get to study for his OWLS. They were right around the corner.
"I-I'm so-sorry." Potter stuttered. Draco just smiled, it wasn't Potter's fault kissing Harry might just break him.
"What did you say?" Ron had whispered, shivering from a different kind of fear. He didn't bother answering.
"I think we all understand the basics of Occlumency and Legilimecy, isn't that correct, Potter?" Draco asked, ignoring Severus completely. Harry nodded and then hesitated, obviously conflicted on whether he should ask his question of not. "Just ask Potter," Draco said, resisting the urge to sigh.
Draco was hesitant at first, his mouth moving slowly, carefully. After several seconds, he seemed to realize that Harry wasn’t moving at all, that Harry's hand was still on his arm, tugging, pulling, unsure itself what it wanted. He took Harry's wrists in his hands, gently pulling them up and around his neck, and Harry automatically let his hands settle. Then Draco put tentative hands around Harry's waist, drawing flat against the small of his back before pulling Harry flush against his body.
"No," Harry told him, and Draco nodded, letting his hand go and slipping out the door after Lucius. Harry paced forward, throwing himself down into a chair and feeling Severus' eyes on him all the while.
"They've got my teacher at the place where it's hidden!" he called seconds before Snape's hand touched the door handle. Snape turned his face toward him, raising a single bewildered eyebrow.
However, once they reached the Infirmary, that ended. Madam Pomfrey swooped down on him, clutching and clucking as if her personal goal was to deafen and blind him. Hermione was there too, standing slightly back and asking endless questions as if he was in any condition to understand what she was saying. Somehow, he found himself with his hands clamped down on Professor Snape's robes and standing so close that Madam Pomfrey had to pry him away from the man.
"It's not my fault," Harry called, his voice cracking. He knew how he sounded, but in that moment he didn't care. Draco hesitated, his shoulders tensing. "It's a prophecy, Draco, what am I supposed to do? Pretend it doesn't exist?!"
And he'd hardly been able to push. It hadn't been as if he truly knew anything about healing from wounds like Harry's.
"I don't trust Lupin," Harry answered, but the truth was he hadn't really thought about asking anyone else. He could have asked Lucius but talking to Lucius about anything werewolf related was delicate, and Harry wasn't about to walk into that minefield. Besides, he would probably mention it to Severus, and Severus would never leave Harry alone once he found out. He hadn't even bothered to consider Lupin; the man just didn't exist in his circle of people considered humans, much less people he would willingly ask something of.
"Harry Potter," the woman said, looking straight at him. He tried to move toward her, but Dracona was suddenly in the way. He could see her lips moving, but he couldn't hear her, couldn't focus on her past the shimmering light in the woman's beautiful dark eyes.
"But-," Draco looked back at the castle. He could still feel the siren going off in his head, but now that it wasn't dominating his other senses, he could feel something else. A faint scent to the wind, a scent of death and darkness. He looked up and the customary shimmer that covered Hogwarts was gone. The wards had come down, that was why the sirens had sounded. He looked at Harry, eyes narrowing. Suddenly, the conversation he'd overheard made a lot more sense.
Another was just a simple potions textbook, like one they'd see in school, but it was more advanced and expensive from a more well-known author. He turned it over in his hands. Harry couldn't have just picked it off a shelf somewhere, he would have had to talked to someone.
"But this is very important," Nott interrupted, smiling blandly before stepping into the room. He almost immediately caught sight of Lucius, his smile widening as he did. "Professor Malfoy. I suppose it's fitting you're here."
She gasped as the spell hit her, her skin freezing, hardening, turning into stone as Dracona watched. And Hermione was stepping further into the room as Harry came running over to Dracona. He pulled on the chains once, twice while Dracona stared at him, too stunned to do anything. Then Hermione was right there, pointing her wand and muttering some spell the made the chains fall lose.
"Perhaps," Lucius' lips twitched, his eyes focusing back on Severus. "Though I can't help but notice you avoided the question."
"Because, Granger," Draco answered, his voice dangerously low. "As I've already told you, I'm busy."
the help in the first place. He could still feel the dried lines on his face where the tear tracks had been, and Harry hated how it made him feel. Hated how much he still wished Draco hadn't let him walk away.
“This line of questioning is entirely inappropriate,” Severus answered; he could feel the muscles along his back bunch together in frustrated tense as he internally panicked. He didn’t know what to say. He didn’t know how to pull himself out of this one. Years of being a spy for the Dark Lord, training his mind for lies and speaking half-truths, and the Minister had caught him in something so foolishly false. “I am not in a romantic relationship with anyone besides Lucius Malfoy.”
"What?" Zabini stared at him, his brow furrowing as he stepped forward, and Harry jerked away, flinching as he went. "Are you alri-."
like Voldemort; he could feel the darkness and the desire to kill and rage inside of him. He'd spent too many years suppressing the anger that he barely even recognized it anymore, but it was still there.
"Yes," Draco answered. "He'll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you're giving the problem your full attention."
Draco yelled, making Dolohov's limbs snap together and then sending him to the ground. He immediately moved toward Harry was leaning over Granger. Longbottom followed him over, kneeling down beside them and taking Granger’s wrist between his fingers.
"Harry…" she whispered, leaning forward on impulse and pressing her lips against his. Because there was no other choice. Because she needed a way to shock Harry back to reality. Because he was so close.
," Harry insisted. He was starting to feel just a tad drunk, tipsy even. He took another large gulp of firewhiskey. "He's
"Who in the blazes is calling at this time of night?" Vernon snapped, his voice echoing around the corner. Harry froze, realizing how he'd forgotten to warn the Durleys. He shook his head, taking one last deep breath and opened the door just as Vernon came around the corner.
"We have a very reliable source, Professor Snape," Scrimgeour's lip curled, and Severus couldn't help wondering if he conducted all of his Ministry business calls with such a lack of finesse. "Rest assured the order to have you out of Hogwarts will be signed very soon."
"I don't know," Lupin answered, turning a corner. Harry froze, watching as Lupin turned right, his wand still a little too tight in his hand. "I don't know anything."
"Get out, Blaise," Draco told him, and Zabini glared at him for a long minute before he turned on his heel and followed Luna and Lucius out the door.
Potter spared him a look, full of contempt and indifference and thoughtfulness, and Blaise's hands froze; Potter couldn't know. But he was already turning away, his face bent away from both Blaise and Draco as if he didn't want anyone to know what he was thinking, and Blaise wasn't sure he'd seen what he'd been sure he'd seen in the first place.
"True," Lucius' lips curled in barely concealed disgusted. "I never liked the man." Severus was silent; there was no real answer. Lucius already knew his opinion on the matter; there was no point restating it. They sat in silence for several minute, Severus' eyes firmly set on the desk in front of him. He could feel Lucius looking at him, but he didn't look up. There wasn't a point.
And Draco realized he could move, but it was somehow worse because that meant that Harry was—Harry was—
"You thinking that is half the reason you can't." Draco said. Harry's hand hesitated a second before it touched the wall in front of him and then his knuckles brushed against the smooth blue surface. Draco gasped, making Harry turn toward him, his hand half raised. Their eyes locked, and Harry restrained the gasp at the emotion he found in Draco's gaze.
"How would I know what you care about?" Blaise answered. They were walking down the corridor, Blaise continuing to follow him while Draco wished a professor—any professor—would swoop down on him and tell him off because there was simply no way Blaise had managed to get into a NEWT level Ancient Runes. "It's not like you talk to me anyone."
He stopped in front of the Slytherin dorm, murmuring the password quietly before stepping inside. Being careful to keep his feet concealed, he headed up the stairs and to Draco's Prefect room. Harry knocked quietly, waiting for a moment before frowning at the door. Draco was an extremely light sleeper, he
And if that means shutting your mouth and letting your pride take a few hits for a few hours of peace, isn't it worth it?"
"Oh, um—I…." Harry trailed off, unsure where to go from there. What was one supposed to say to one's secret… whatever Draco and him were—when asked about one's crush? He blushed harder. Malfoy narrowed his eyes at Harry's lack of eloquence.
They’d been cooped up in Hogwarts all summer, neither Draco nor Lucius going back to Malfoy Manor. Every Severus had stayed where usually he would have spent a least a month at his house. Harry didn’t bother to ask why. He hadn’t thought it mattered.
without being selfish!" Harry cut himself off with a loud gasp, and Draco only just realized he was shaking, his shoulders trembling, and he could see in the quiet that followed Harry's words that he was close to crying.
Harry gulped, irrational panic shooting through him. What if Malfoy was so disgusted, he leaves? Then Draco looked up at him and smiled pleasantly. He licked a clean stripe up Harry's length, making Harry shudder as his silver-grey eyes never left Harry’s.
"He knew about the poison," Lucius answered, his eyes still hard on Severus'. "He knew we would be using it again."
"Of course," Severus answered, though truthfully, he had no idea how to accomplish the act without betraying his true allegiance.
Harry ignored them. His hand was reaching down, an inch from Draco's silvery hair, a centimeter, and then finally tangling in the soft locks. His fingers slid through them easily, stroking Draco's scalp in a way that was somehow horribly pleasant for Harry. He'd never touched another person before, at least not like this. He'd never really wanted to. At least, not after Vernon. And he didn't know what he was doing now. Not just physically but with anything. He didn't know why he'd told Dumbledore he wanted to come back. He hadn't, not really. But he'd felt he couldn't not come back.
He ignored the looks of disbelief in Ron and Hermione's eyes as they watched him. They didn't understand. They didn't understand how he could be so cold to someone he was supposed to love.
"That your life might just be worth a lot to me." And it clicked together so easily why his recklessness bothered her so much.
"I see your point," Adarins bowed to Lucius stiffly, his lips still curved in a rigid smile. "Still you must admit that Snape does not know what he's doing. Just last year, he almost got the school destroyed, he let a werewolf attend as a student, and he's just now proclaimed that he was never a Death Eater. What are we to believe?"
"Alright," the word came out as a whisper of breath, forced between teeth, and Draco seemed to realize his mistake even as he heard the word.
Luna blinked at him before shrugging and heading for the door. Zabini looked first at Lucius, then Severus, then Draco and Harry as if sure he was about to miss something if he left. He furrowed his eyebrows, opening his mouth to argue. Harry didn't know why they'd even let him stay, except that he'd already sort of known what was going on, and really, Zabini had a way of worming himself into situations that he wanted to be in.
“Alright, come on,” Draco said, standing. He pulled Harry by his hand, waiting until he stood, that tilted head frown of confusion on his face as he stared at Draco as if he was crazy.
“Father, I need to do this,” Draco answered. He was staring down at the tea in his hands, and he suddenly looked so young. He had bags under his eyes from how he hadn’t been sleeping, his hair a mess, his shoulders pulled into his body. Lucius hated to admit it, but whatever was going on, it was really bothering Draco.
"But Wrackspurts aren't my problem?" he asked, lips twitching against his will. She blinked at him, long and slow as if seriously considering his question.
He bit his lip, resisting the urge to groan. What had he been thinking? He couldn't even blame it on being drunk, because he'd been stone cold sober. Malfoy had been the one that was drinking. Which really, how drunk could he have gotten off one glass of wine? The man needed to work on his tolerance.
After a minute, the sound stopped, and he cautiously uncovered his ears, watching as everyone else did the same. Harry was the only one who hadn't moved, staring into the cauldron with that unreadable expression of his.
"What does that mean?" Harry asked, and Malfoy frowned, raising his hand to run through his hair. It was down today, falling around his face and framing his cheekbones in a way that made them stand out even more than they usually did.
Voldemort, Draco," Harry said, shivering against him. "Draco, I can't control myself. I can't do Occlumency. I just can't. I am trying, I am but he's just getting in my head more often than not and—"
"Come now, Potter," Lucius threw his casual smirk at Harry, who didn't even bother to look up at him. "You know I despise having everyone stare at me while I eat."
"He only touched me a couple times," he said, and Draco blinked once. He had to consciously tell himself not to react, not to moved. He could feel the anger, the protective, possessive energy coiling through him, but he knew reacting violently wouldn't be the way to get Harry to open up. He forced himself to stay still, stay relaxed as he warred with the convoluted idea of the words 'touched me' and 'only… a couple times' as if they somehow canceled each other out.
"You had no right to follow me," he said, grinding his teeth against the pain, against the acknowledgment that he might just be turning Harry away from him for good. He forced all his frustration to come out as anger instead, channeling it directly toward Harry in one dark wave. "You had no right to invade my privacy as if I'm some random deatheater and not your—" he cut himself off. "You have no idea what's going through my head, because you’ve never bothered to ask.” He swallowed and turned his face away. He had never bothered to tell Harry what he wanted. "You didn't ask, because you had already assumed the worst of me, perfect Potter so stuck in his own little world he can never consider other people's problems."
"Yes, sir," he answered. He stood and hesitated, waiting for Draco to rise before standing himself. “Sir, am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything you've told me?" Draco tensed, but he kept his eyes on Dumbledore.
Well, he didn't approach until one day. It had been a bad day. The Gryffindors had been particularly harsh, and the dark-haired boy had called the redhead a Mudblood. He wondered if that was actually true. It must have been; that wasn't something one goes around accusing people of without knowing whether it was true or not.
"Good," Draco answered, his shoulders dropping, and Harry hadn’t even realized how tense he’d been. "Don't. Like I said, Severus played with some dark stuff when he was school."
"People are like that for the people they love," Severus answered, thinking back to when he had first met Harry, when he had still mourned Lily and hated James and there had been no room for any kind of love in his heart. Lucius reached over, brushing a finger across the back of his hand. And it was enough to pull the melancholy, the thought of what might have been away.
"Yes," The Dark Lord answered, his red snake eyes turning toward Draco. "I know of Lucius' failure." His lip curled on the word, voice twisting with disgust. His wand hand twitched, raising ever so slightly and Draco reacted before he really knew what he was doing.
"Is it not?" Severus asked, bowing he head back over his hands, black hair falling over his face, "Am I not only different because you care about me?" and Lucius had no idea what to say that would make any of it matter.
“First rule,” Draco said. “Never look a Legitimist in the eyes. If I was any good at Legilimency, I’d be so far in your mind right now, you’d never stop me.”
"When do you ever not know where he is?" Blaise answered, and Draco just looked uncomfortable. Which set all the wrong bells ringing. "What did Potter do?"
"Draco!" he called into Draco's ear, and he just managed to restrain the urge to punch Blaise in the jaw.
Unfortunately, he did not receive such a welcome greeting from the rest of the Weasleys. Old lady Weasley gave him a long suspicious look before tucking Harry under her arm and pulling him into the Leaky Cauldron. Old man Weasley blinked at him, Girl Weasley frowned, the one with the scar just raised an eyebrow at him, and Ron Weasley scowled. Granger smiled at him before following them in. It wasn't welcoming though he supposed no one spit at him, so it wasn't the worst he could've expected.
"Whoa, mate," Ron said, pulling away, the hand on Harry's shoulder turning abruptly restraining. He was dressed in his Auror robes, his wand in his right hand, and Harry could see a couple of other figures similarly dressed moving around behind him. "You were out pretty good."
"That's what Lupin was doing," Lucius said, leaning over Severus' desk. "You asked him to help you make sure the Ministry didn't find out about Draco."
"What did they even want?" Longbottom asked, his voice pitching with a combination of fear and anger. "The Prophecy is broken, we can't give them anything else."
"I, uh…. nothing," he said, looking over his shoulder, but Potter was already gone. Probably off abusing some innocent first year somewhere or something.
"Ron, that's not how you spell belligerent," Hermione said suddenly, sounded exasperated as she pulled his essay toward her. "And I'm pretty sure this is supposed to be about dementors not dugbogs, nor is your name Roonil Wazlib," she said, and Ron was leaning over her shoulder, looking down at his essay with a slightly horrified expression.
And Draco thought of Harry, of his few and far between smiles that shone, of his dark green eyes that held all his emotions if you would just bothered to look, of the way he was so hesitant, so scared to touch, of the way he loved with everything he had, even though he was so scared of being broken, and Draco really didn't know if there was an answer.
"I don't—" Harry started, feeling as if he'd missed something very important. They had been arguing, how had this turned into a declaration of Draco's feelings for him?
"Why are you telling us this?" Weasley asked, narrowing his eyes suspiciously. "What do you expect us to do?"
“I’m surprised so many have agreed to side with us,” Severus answered, and Lucius turned his gaze on him. His expression was harder to read then it had been for a long time, sharp and calculating, and Severus didn’t know if Lucius was frustrated or satisfied with his progress.
"He's what?" Harry's eyes narrowed. "Just what exactly were you going to say?" Weasley's face turned red, and he opened his mouth to probably say something absurdly foul.
"Let me see." Severus said, keep his hand firmly around Harry's wrist. Harry hesitated and then dropped his eyes. He took that as an invitation, so he placed his hand gently on Harry's sleeve and started to pull it up, careful to barely touch so Harry could feel his hand but not really putting pressure on him. Harry shivered but didn't try to pull away as the scars were revealed, horribly thick and crossing against his skin.
"You've already asked me that," he answered, leaning his head back and turning away. Draco was seated back in his chair, far enough away that Harry could ignore him if he wanted to. And suddenly that was terribly too far for him. Draco stood abruptly, sitting on the edge of the bed and leaning over to get as close to Harry as he could without getting in his face. Harry turned toward him, his face flushed as he looked at Draco with dark green eyes locked on his face.
"Ask her," Draco said, lips curling into a slight sneer. "She was babbling some nonsense about taking the night bus and wanting to talk to you and having to wait for Dumbledore to give her permission to come."
He didn't understand why Draco was acting like a jilted lover. Draco himself had been the one to insist there would be no exclusivity between them, much less jealously. So, why was he suddenly acting like he wanted to change his mind? And not just with 'Snuffles' but with Cho too. The whole scene he had caused in the Hog's Head with Cho had screamed jealous lover, but Draco couldn't possibly
Draco looked down at his lap to find Hermione looking back up at him with wide tear rimmed brown eyes, and he sighed. As if he needed another problem on top of his own.
Draco was clutching Harry’s hand in his, his fingers intertwined tightly against the coolness of the August weather. He kept looking back, asking what Harry wanted to do, asking if he was alright with something Draco obviously wanted, tugging him along by his hand as if he had no intention of letting go.
"Why didn't you tell me?" Draco's asked, his voice breaking through Lucius' thoughts. He turned, refusing to let his sorrow show in his eyes. The last thing Draco needed was to see him weak. The last thing either of them needed was to break down. Malfoy's were always strong in the face of new obstacles.
So, he had gone with him. First to Lockhart and then when he had proved incompetent, they'd left him unconscious and gone deep under Hogwarts and into the twisting tunnels. He didn't know how Ron and Hermione had found the entrance, and he didn't ask. If it wasn't for Ginny, he wouldn't have been there in the first place.
He'd skipped breakfast. He already knew today was going to be bad, no need to add insult to injury. He strapped on his Quidditch gear, checking the time twice before heading down.
something in the air. Potter was an idiot. Draco was perfect, and Potter was stupid for choosing to pass up on Draco's amazingness. Draco covered his mouth to stifle the hiccup; it
And Draco felt like some love-struck fool staring down at him, trying to hold back some stupid nonsensical nonsense that he was sure didn't make any sense whatsoever. But he really didn't care. He'd had his whole life drug away from him without a moment notice, thrust into something he was ill prepared for and had no idea what to do with once. He'd missed so many opportunities that he would never get the chance at again, and he wouldn't make the same mistake again. So, if he had to look like a love-struck fool as he stared down at Harry, he would do it.
"I could at least get the Order off your back, and maybe stop some of the rumors about Draco being out of control. At the very least, with an older werewolf here, the Order will have to admit that he's more in control. I'd like to help you if you'll just let me."
“We could play the angle of your relationship with Headmaster Snape,” Woods said, tapping her finger against her forearm as she paced. “But there’s also the fact that the two of you have been having trouble until recently. That could also open the door for them to accuse Headmaster Snape of being distracted because of your relationship.”
Draco smiled again as he lowered his mouth to suck on Harry’s head, swirling his tongue around. Harry groaned, his hands clenching against the invisible bonds.
Draco sighed, casting the ceiling a 'why me?' look before turning back to Harry, his silver-grey eyes unnervingly fixated on Harry’s.
"Hysterical." Draco answered, ignoring the twist of his heart when Harry just shook his head and refused to look at him.
Draco glanced down the hallway as if to make sure no one was watching before slipping into the classroom. Harry went in after him, passing so close he felt Draco's fingertips brush his waist. He sucked in a breath, stumbling closer to Draco, in desperate
"Lucius, would you mind," Severus shifted again, and this time he noticed the blush that flashed across Severus' face before he swallowed and looked away.
him. As if Draco had that right. As if they were in any place to be doing that. Blowjobs and Handjobs were one thing, but sex—penetrative sex was something completely different.
“Well, if Snape had tried to take advantage of Potter, would Potter have been in the right state of mind to deny him?’
"Dumbledore—" Harry tried and then suddenly Draco was there, his hands on Harry's shoulders. He shoved, and Harry's back hit the wall with a startled woof. He didn't struggle; he didn't have it in him to struggle past the heat trickling through the hands on his shoulder and into his chest, down through his stomach. Draco's hands tightened, his pupils dilated as he continued on mercilessly, voice low and full of anger.
Someone on the Gryffindor team yell at Potter, and he suddenly veered back into action, tearing his eyes away from Weasley. Draco searched frantically, where,
"I'm positive," Hermione told her. "Harry told me so himself. He said he's just too shy to say anything to you."
And Draco couldn’t decide if Harry was never allowed to have sugar again or if he had to have it every day from then on.
Harry was seething. He was beyond angry, and maybe it wasn't fair to point fingers before he really knew all of the facts, but he
He knew about Hermione being petrified, of course he did. But they hadn't exactly been close anymore, so he was surprised when the first person Ron came to find was him. Then: "Harry, I need your help!" were the first words to leave the redhead's mouth and the surprise vanished. He sighed.
And perhaps Harry had been right. Perhaps it was his own doing for not being forthright enough with Severus.
"Then stand," Lupin answered easily. "But you can't avoid this conversation forever," he paused, but Draco still said nothing. "I suppose you're here about the full moon next week?"
"You're not welcome here." Her large bat ears flickered as she stared them down, big brown eyes never blinking. "Master Draco has forbidden you."
"It didn't go well, then?" Lucius asked as Draco closed the door behind him. Draco blinked at him before moving to sit in the chair Potter had abandoned.
And then he understood. Draco hadn't brought him here because he'd wanted him. He'd brought him here because he'd needed to tell him about Occlumency. Harry flushed in humiliation, dropping his eyes to the ground and refusing to look up.
"I thought you wanted me to leave you alone?" Malfoy asked. He just shrugged, leading the way down the hall and up several flights of stairs. It wasn't far, but it always felt that way when he bothered to climb up to the tower. "Where are we going?"
"Where is everyone?" Dracona asked, her head feeling heavy as it pulsed with pain. But as she looked around, she noticed they were alone in the large room. "The Aurors…"
"Invite me along?" Draco asked, trying to look over Harry's shoulder at the note. "Why would he want me there?"
Too late. The door to his father’s private rooms opened under his hand, and Lucius was suddenly standing in front of him, one eyebrow raised as if he wasn’t in the least surprised to find Draco standing there.
Fortunately, she seemed to have the situation under control. Granger ordered the giant to put her down, her voice surprisingly steady and the giant surprisingly listened. After she was back on the ground the giant shifted himself around, so he was facing a tree, apparently losing interest in them. Granger let out a breath, shaking faintly, and Draco couldn’t help envying her. He probably would have just screamed.
anything to go up there. He forced himself to relax, nodding to Lucius as he added a third finger, stretching as much as he could.
"You know," Lucius said finally. "I could make it go away. I still have quite a bit of influence in the Ministry."
"I'm so tired," he said, in that age-old voice that Severus hated. "So tired of feeling hope only to be burned."
And he still had to look forward to the conversation with Sirius, who was in fact Snuffles. Harry snorted, the very
"What did he do to you, Severus?" Lucius answered, his hands tightening unconsciously around Severus'. He tried to loosen his grip but couldn't. Not while Severus was looking up at him with his dark eyes full of pain and expectation.
"I'll leave the two of you alone to discuss this," Shacklebolt said suddenly. "Malfoy, your team will leave in 30, be ready by then."
"You know that's not true," Draco answered, shifting and narrowing his eyes, and Harry could sense the frustration standing just on the other side of Draco's control. "Harry, talk to me. If no one else, talk to me."
"Your Lord," Draco snapped. "He not my anything." Suddenly, Nott's wand was out, pointing across the small distance between them and directly into Draco's face. Draco just stared at him; Nott couldn't kill him, he'd been ordered not to. That didn't mean he couldn't hurt him.
"Yeah," Draco said, his lips curling in a hesitant smile. His eyes were shadowed, like he was seeing the same nightmares that haunted Harry when he closed his eyes. "I'm aware."
"Bad," he said, pulling his hands apart and then back together again and wishing she'd just let him leave. If he really wanted to know about Draco Malfoy, he was hardly the right person to be asking. She obviously wanted him here for something else. But then that was always the way, wasn’t it? People pretended friendliness when they really just wanted something.
"Draco Malfoy is dying of a werewolf bite in the infirmary." Harry told him casually, and Severus's eyes bulged as only his could, cold steely anger flashing in them.
Draco lunged forward, grabbing the back of Harry’s neck and dragging him down. Harry gasped, opening his mouth for Draco's tongue to begin devouring. He licked Harry's teeth, his gums, and then stroked that place in his mouth that had been sensitive to Draco's ministrations the last time they had kissed. On cue, Harry arched, his hands reaching to lock in Draco's hair and pull him closer than physically possible. Harry's own tongue rose to respond to Draco, stroking along Draco's and making him suppress his shudder of appreciation.
“I’m not going to leave you,” he said, and he had thought it had been obvious. So obvious after what he’d said two nights ago but it must not have been if the way Harry jerked his head up in shock was anything to go by.
"Anything for you, My Lord," Severus answered. Harry almost flinched. He'd never thought he'd see the day Severus betrayed him, but he supposed it wasn't a surprise. It was never a surprise when someone let you down.
And then suddenly there were Death Eaters all around, outnumbering them. They circled around, blocking them in as if they'd been standing there the whole time. Harry realized by the smirk on Malfoy’s face that this was exactly what was happening.
Still, when they returned to school for the next term, that didn't stop him from being wary of Lucius. A fact that seemed to annoy the 7th year Head Boy to no end.
"Potter, cast a cleansing spell." Severus snapped, gesturing to Harry before turning to his bag and pulling out a couple of potions. Harry bent over Draco, examining the wound as he cast his cleansing spell with a quick flick of his wrist. Then he stepped to the side and let Severus begin his work. When it was clear the Professor was immersed in his work of potions and healing, Harry stepped out of the room. He closed the doors to the infirmary softly before allowing his feet to take him to one of only places he felt truly safe.
"I know where Lucius and Draco Malfoy are, My Lord." he said, lowering his head as if he couldn't stand to hold his lord's eyes any longer.
"What? Has Snape done something?" Harry answered quickly, and the beating of his heart was so loud he wondered if Hagrid could hear it. Maybe he'd been wrong. Maybe…
"It's a blood ward," Draco said, rolling his eyes. "When she died, your mother cast a blood ward on you and being under the roof of your blood relatives keeps you safe as long as you're with them."
He stopped abruptly in front of Ginny, smiling when she did. He was vaguely surprised she wasn't in a corner somewhere lip-locked with Dean. He'd caught them snogging more than once. It had been a rather strange sight, catching him more off guard than he truly wanted to admit.
"Harry," Granger interrupted again. "We're just trying to help. You have to know Malfoy isn't good for you." Harry laughed at her, low and bitter, and Granger flinched. Good.
"Harry?" Hermione said. "What are you doing? Don't touch it!" He knew he should listen. He knew what Draco would say if he saw him now, reaching for something when he had no idea what it did, but he couldn’t stop himself. He felt in a trance, the sphere calling to him.
"It's lunch time?" he asked finally. Draco tried to check his sigh. As wonderful as yesterday had been, he couldn't let himself forget that Harry had other problems. Problems like not eating and not sleeping. Though admittedly, he seemed to have slept fine last night.
