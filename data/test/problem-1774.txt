"This boy doesn't know his limits.", Draco said annoyed.
Harry glared at the desk. He flinched as a warm hand was placed on his shoulder.
"Tell me." Draco knew what he was supposed to tell him. He sighed.
Harry looked at Malfoy and smiled. Malfoy smiled too and Harry kissed him.
On this Sunday, Draco didn't even bother to get up. He woke up around half past ten, but lay in bed until it was lunchtime. He then walked down into the Great Hall. On his way there, many people turned around and gasped shocked when they saw him slurping through the halls. Draco didn't know what he looked like and he didn't care. When he walked into the Hall, he noticed Potter's friends sitting at their usual table. Draco ignored them. He grabbed some food and then left again.
Malfoy nodded. Harry rolled his eyes and turned around. Then he turned back to look at Malfoy.
"That's beautiful.", he said quietly and kissed Potter on his cheek.
"Morning, mate."
. Harry threw the wet towel onto his bed.
was playing and Draco turned around to look at Harry with big, grey eyes. They slow-danced in the middle of the crowd while everyone else danced to a rocky beat. When Harry looked up, he saw a lot of people looking at them funny, but his friends and Malfoy's friends watched them with a smile.
"Malfoy, my good friend.", Seamus said and put on an extremely fake smile, "Will you answer my simple question?"
"What?", Harry asked.
Suddenly a memory from Harry came into his head. When he had been twelve years old and his uncle had asked him what he had had to do when the visitors had been coming and Harry had told him he was going to go to his bedroom, making no noise and pretending that he didn't exist. Harry had hated it to pretend that and he didn't want Malfoy feeling the same even though he was an absolute arse.
Ron nodded understanding. "Okay, let's do it." And he shoved another fork filled with food in his mouth.
"Mione?", Ron asked and lay his arm around her shoulder. She looked at him expressionless.
"No one else was left.", Ron said and shrugged.
"Dunno. I think we fell asleep at the same time." Ron's voice answered.
The doors were still closed and it was not the time for visitors, so Draco slurped back to his room. He fell down on his bed and closed his eyes. After good two minutes, he was asleep.
McGonnagal gave the stool and the Hat away and walked back to the podium.
"Seriously?", Harry asked, but had to laugh.
"Malfoy." Hermione raised her hand, "You don't need to list
"Really?", Potter asked and his eyes lighted.
He kept laughing more quiet, but Harry grinned as well. They talked and laughed for a while and the stuff with Draco's father and the tournament and Voldemort seemed forgotten. Then, the portrait opened, what Harry had only noticed, when Hermione and Ron looked at each other and the other Gryffindors started whispering.
"What are you doing?" Harry asked when he came into the living room.
Harry's face got red and his cheeks started burning. In anger, he turned around and slammed his fists against the wall. He heard Malfoy breathing heavily. Harry turned around.
"Yes, because they are first years who aren't already sorted, you dumb idiot." Draco snapped.
They climbed outside and walked down the hallway, where a few students crossed their way. Especially the girls shot Draco dark looks. Harry looked at Draco with a sad look. In front of the Hall, Draco stopped.
"Why do they even greet me when they are all so shocked about me and Draco?", Harry asked.
Potter lay down next to him, so they could look at each other.
Draco sighed.
deserve it. Harry looked at Neville, who smiled encouraging and nodded. Dean stared at all of them- from Harry to Neville, to Hermione, to Ron. Harry swallowed. They were the last two friends he had to tell. The last two. And that was even harder than telling the first friend - maybe it was because Neville had been so understanding and caring.
"Harry," Hermione said, "Be calm, okay?"
He looked at the Muggles curiously and Harry found it highly amusing to see his boyfriend like this. He was like a little child that went for the first time to the zoo.
"Shut it, Potter. I pulled myself together all evening." Malfoy answered and lit the cigarette between his lips.
Hermione's jaw fell and Harry had to stifle back a laugh at the sight of her. He, too, was surprised by Ron's answer. Sure, he still hadn't forgiven Malfoy, but Harry couldn't say that he himself had fully forgiven him either. Ron rolled his eyes.
Anna nodded and walked away, her high heels clacking on the marble floor. The store had big windows through which the sunlight beamed inside. Harry and his friends looked around. Seamus pulled out several clothes he liked, but Harry put a lot of them back because he wasn't so fond of them. Ron laughed at Harry when he tried on a shining silvery blouse.
But Potter grabbed Draco's shoulder. In one movement, Draco grabbed Potter's hand, pulled it off his shoulder, turned around and held his wand at Potter's throat.
"Of course I do! Now shut up and go back to the boys!", Vernon said and pushed his wife back into the living room, where Draco and Potter sat on the couch.
"I hate you.", he said.
Harry thought.
"What's wrong? Where's your
"Say it again.", said Draco, his eyes glistening.
"You know Fred?" Ron asked.
"Because we know you, Harry." Hermione sounded worried, so Harry stopped arguing and sighed.
"Because I'm not coming home over the holidays.", Draco laughed and started writing.
"You don't have to explain, Harry.", he said finally, "As long as you're happy..."
Harry felt bad. He didn't want to tell his friends that he actually
"Your summer." Blaise said.
Draco pulled out his wand and in one smooth movement, it was at Vernon's throat. Dudley and Petunia screeched.
"I'm going to pay.", Seamus said.
Closing his eyes and burying his face in the pillows was tempting, but childish. Draco turned around slowly to face whoever had called him.
Draco nodded.
"Wait there was-", Malfoy said and touched with his finger the screen of Harry's phone.
"Look at Greg. He's doing well, isn't he?", Pansy asked.
Harry sat down on the couch and looked up at his two friends and Malfoy. What were they doing? Harry thought he had expressed his feelings towards Malfoy clearly.
"Don't you dare to laugh at me, Malfoy. No get out!", she said loudly and glared at Draco. He had never seen her like that.
, but Potter had told him to shut up and just watch. It was a really weird device, this TV-thing. Draco was astounded when, as soon as Potter had put in this shining round thing, a picture appeared on the screen. Moving pictures. Potter had explained to him once again what a movie was and Draco said he'd got it now, but seeing it happen was still pretty overwhelming.
They strolled through the castle and talked about all kinds of things. Later, the two of them met Hermione, Ron, Dean and Neville. Neville immediately wrapped his arms around Luna and gave her a quick kiss on the forehead.
"Don't you want to find your new friend Potter?" Theo asked mockingly.
Draco pulled out his wand quickly.
Hermione and Ron have been at home for hours now and Harry supposed they were already fast asleep - according to their shoes being all over the place, the alcohol has helped them. Harry and Malfoy let themselves fall onto the couch, what scared Crookshanks away, and Harry put his feet up on the table.
Draco had a hard time believing that Potter really understood what he was going through, because - let's face it - Potter was flawless. Everything he did was right and he was full of moral and integrity. And - Draco saw no point in denying it - Potter wasn't too bad-looking. Sure, his hair needed work done, but all in all he was maybe sort of handsome... objectively speaking of course. He had built up a lot of muscles since sixth year and Draco figured it came from fighting in the war and playing a damn lot of Quidditch and being actually brilliant at it.
Harry nodded. "I mean you look really neat all in all."
"Ready?", he asked. Draco looked down at himself.
"Neither, I'm really sorry, Potter.", the professor answered. Harry nodded.
"Nothing special." Potter said when he noticed Draco's look.
"Harry, you need to fix that.", she said. Harry's mouth fell open.
lying on the small table next to him and flipped through the pages. Nothing interested him, so he pulled out his phone and decided to call Hermione.
"Sorry girls, he's with me." Ginny said, pushed herself through the group of witches and pulled Harry out of there.
"You know, I think you should ask Seamus. At least it's his room were going.", Ron shrugged.
Madame Pomfrey hurried over to his bed and thrust a glass of potion in his hand.
"I don't know. I was bored and I didn't know what Malfoy had in mind when he asked me to follow him."
Of course, he couldn't know what had happened in the Forbidden Forest.
Potter looked up at him. His green eyes burning a hole into Draco's grey ones.
He and Hermione walked next to Harry back to the Entrance Hall.
"Alright, Harry. And I'm really sorry.", Hermione said and hugged Harry.
Harry sighed and walked over to his bed, sitting down. Draco sat down next to him and looked rather sad.
"If you don't want to talk to me, just tell me.", Harry said annoyed.
"What did you even think of letting a child grow up in a
"Don't worry. Madame Pomfrey is a good healer. She'll fix it."
Potter didn't reply.
Draco sighed and rolled his eyes. This was ridiculous. He didn't want to go there. He didn't want to see Potter, not after their last embarrassing encounter. But he also really didn't want Pansy to be whining for the rest of the day.
"Hello, Malfoy.", Seamus said in his Irish accent.
"And then I met him yesterday at the supermarket."
"Well, it's an improvement to what I had eleven years of my life.", Harry answered and shrugged.
"Ron won't accept that I asked Draco to the ball.", Harry told her.
"Oh, shut up little baby.", Harry laughed and released Draco.
When Draco woke up, his heart was racing already. He knew what was going to happen today and he was bloody excited about it. He jumped up and joined Theo in the living room.
"Harry!" He heard Hermione say. Harry stooped and sighed. Well, that made his plan impossible.
Malfoy glared at Harry. He held up his hands defensively.
Harry blinked and looked at Ron.
"You're probably not the only one." Harry said.
"That's ok.", said Harry.
Harry looked at the owls in the cages and suddenly missed Hedwig a lot. No owl could ever replace her and Harry somehow wanted her to know that. He finally decided to go with a light brown owl with kind eyes. Ron seemed rather jealous when Harry paid for it.
"What?" Draco snapped back.
"You are! Yes, of course you are. FinallyHe and Kreacher meet at last.", he said and bowed in front of Draco, who was a bit overwhelmed with the situation, what Potter seemed to have noticed.
"Can you watch Teddy?" Harry asked Ron.
"Oh, Mister Draco you is not looking happy.", the elf's ears fell down sadly. Draco shook his head.
"I'm fine," he replied smiling. He really was fine.
"It's-" Harry cleared his throat, "It's alright."
"Yeah." He said, "Malfoy sent me a letter yesterday and asked if I wanted to come to Malfoy Manor."
Harry's head started to hurt. He sighed and put the letter on his bedside stand. Kneading his forehead with his knuckles, he got up and walked to Malfoy's owl that looked at him with expectant eyes.
"Harry." She said and Harry already knew it was going to be hard to talk himself out of this.
"I'm sorry, boys, but I promised Ginny I would meet her in the library.", Hermione said apologising. Harry nodded smiling.
"Master.", he said shortly and then looked at Draco.
camping in our room! Are you crazy? Not you, not anyone else," Draco stated clearly and then followed Pomfrey up her desk.
"And I swear to Merlin, before you, I never kissed someone before. I swear. But I'm quite satisfied that you think I'm kissing too good.", Draco added with a laugh.
It seemed like almost everyone was already at the feast, because on his way down, Draco came across only seven other students. When he entered the Hall, his guess was confirmed. The tables were filled with students, what made Draco really uncomfortable. He looked around and noticed Potter looking at him. Draco smirked when he saw Potter looking down at his plate. He walked over to his usual spot at the Slytherin table and sat down. Everyone else immediately slid away so Draco had a three feet radius of people-free-zone. He sighed. Even though Draco was eating alone, this meal was the best he had had in a long time. He had to hold back his smile and tried his best not to look at Potter, what was both really hard, because the picture of Potter smiling was stuck in Draco's head.
"Look Malfoy, I just want to talk to you." Harry said and felt his own nervousness rising, but at least he got Malfoys attention now.
"Well... okay.", Harry said confused.
"I know." Malfoy swallowed thickly, "I don't want
"That's what took you two so long!", she concluded amd Harry and Ron nodded again.
"What the hell do you think you're doing?" He said loudly.
"Hi Malfoy." Theo started reading, "You can come over at 7 if you like. Hermione is taking Ron to dinner, so no need to prepare for a duel. See you then. Potter."
"And tonight we'll give the Patronus another try.", he said hopefully.
Harry was quite annoyed by Hermione. He knew the Tournament wasn't easy, at least he was the underage wizard taking part against his will. Harry turned around and started walking away, Hermione and Draco following him.
But could you blame Draco for not being able to sleep? His mother was two floors beneath him, probably being checked through by healers every fre minutes to see if she was still alive. Of course she was still alive, otherwise someone would have filled Draco in already.
Harry shook his head.
"I do!" Harry shouted angrily.
Harry nodded and couldn't stop smiling. A look at the clock told him that it was nine o'clock in the evening, but he didn't feel tired at all. Apparently, neither did the other two, for Ron asked if they should watch another movie. Harry hopped back onto the couch and grabbed the bowl of popcorn. Ron also took a handful and they finished the movie before putting in a second one.
"Are you mad? What if Pomfrey comes?", Draco replied and looked around.
She shook her head and smiled. "Of course I'm not mad, it was your secret and if Harry didn't want us to know yet, he had every right to do so," Luna answered.
"I think I should go in alone." Malfoy said without looking at Harry.
"Here's your aunt.", Potter said and pointed at a second young woman.
"Don't fool me.", Draco said annoyed.
Draco swallowed.
"Oh, fuck you.", Harry laughed.
To Draco's luck McGonnagal came around the corner.
Harry woke up the next morning because he heard Malfoy talk. When he opened his eyes, he saw snow falling in front of the window and snow-covered trees in the distance. What a wonderful sight, Harry thought. Harry sniffed - something smelled amazing. Harry turned around and nearly fell out of the bed.
Draco wanted to smile. He wanted it so badly, but he didn't. Why did he even ask Potter to do that? His father told him never to trust anyone. But his father was not a person you could trust, Draco had learnt it his whole life long, but now he was strong enough to see it.
"Wake up.", said Draco, shaking Harry.
"But not in here, boy."
This wiped the smile off Lydia's face. "Oh." She said and kept swiping the groceries over the cash desk. Harry stepped from one foot to another uncomfortably. Luckily, when they were ready to go, Lydia smiled at him again and wished him a nice week - Draco was ignored.
"Mother." He said and hugged her briefly.
Ron dropped his fork and even Hermione widened her eyes in disbelief. Harry nodded. This was the reaction he had imagined.
"Mother, it's September. You can't do
Harry and Draco snapped apart and looked up. Harry only now realized they weren't even in his room - they lay in the middle of the living room, on the carpet, in their underwear. Ron stood there and covered his eyes.
Malfoy scoffed, but he really
bored. But he didn't have to. Malfoy rolled his eyes and walked away. Without saying a word, Harry followed him out on the street.
Hermione smiled and raised her eyebrows at Harry, who grinned and couldn't help but feel happy and excited. They finished eating and everyone helped cleaning up. Afterwards, Harry vanished into his room to write Malfoy an answer and then joined Hermione and Ron on the couch to watch TV.
In the evening, they lay in Harry's bed in the semi-dark room and fooled around naked. Harry chuckled every now and then just because he couldn't help it, he was feeling too happy. After what must have been hours of kissing, Malfoy had a crazy idea. He whipped his want and muttered something and two silk shawls came out of the tip of his wand. At first Harry didn't understand what Draco was getting at when he held the shawls in each of his hand and grinned seductively. But then, Harry caught on and he felt himself reddening. Did Malfoy want him to tie him to the bed? As if he'd heard Harry's thoughts, Draco nodded. Harry didn't know if he liked the idea, but Malfoy seemed excited about it, so Harry gave in.
"Alright.", Potter said again.
"Shut up, Blaise!", Nott snapped back.
"So what's going on?"
Harry nodded wordless. He didn't want to see the rest of this video, it could destroy his illusion of the perfect sex they had had. Malfoy didn't say a word, same as Harry. Harry looked at the blonde and realised that he was looking at their hands. Harry thought it would make Malfoy uncomfortable, so he wanted to pull his hand away, but Malfoy held it tight. Harry held back a smile.
"I didn't keep count." Potter laughed, but Draco wasn't in the mood for laughing.
"What does Lupin have to do with this right now?", Malfoy pointed at the cauldron.
"Oh, fine, fine. How long have you been awake?" Harry and Draco sat down on the sofa.
"Why?", Seamus asked.
He didn't say a word until Hermione turned to him.
"Whoa, Malfoy, keep calm.", Dean said mockingly.
Harry shrugged. "I guess."
"Thanks, ferret.", Harry said and pulled Draco down to kiss him a second time.
"You have to talk to him. Yes. You have to talk. And ask him," Neville thought out loud, "Or maybe wait until he talks to you."
Ginny waved him over to the table she, Ron, Hermione and Dean sat on. Hermione wasn't in her familiar position - nose buried in a book, but a giant leather-bound book lay in front of her and Harry suspected she was having it at the ready for when Harry and Ron would have left.
"Hm?"
"Not so fast, Harry." She said.
The lift came and they stepped inside. Teddy pressed the button again and the witch pressed another one. Harry watched her out of the corner of his eye, but didn't say anything or even turned her head a bit in her direction. Unfortunately, she didn't get the hint and asked why Teddy was
"Ahh!", Harry said loudly. His senses were filled with Draco's smell, Draco's feel, Draco's sounds and Draco's look. Harry moaned loudly. Just
"No chance.", Draco grinned and opened the door.
"Well, your boyfriend, then.", she answered, rolling her eyes.
The crowd cheered and Harry smiled as a red flush broke out on Ron's cheeks.
"We- we're sorry." Another first year said, "We'll leave."
"Uuuugh..." He thought aloud.
The three of them talked for a while about Quidditch and fellow players.
Malfoy shook his head and leaned closer. Harry leaned back. What was he doing? His friends were sitting there watching them and Malfoy decided to just make a move at Harry? Harry stopped Malfoy with a hand to his chest.
Ron was asked if he would like to have children some day. Harry saw exactly that Ron was searching for Hermione in the crowd.
Malfoy furrowed his brow. "Who?"
"He is." Hermione agreed.
"Draco, come on. We don't need a new couch. We need a table.", Harry said for the hundredth time or so and dragged Draco behind him.
Harry nodded to himself. He needed to talk to Nott about where Draco would go.
"So. You’re alive.", Draco's voice was haughty as ever, but there was something soft about his mouth.
Malfoy turned his back to them again and emptied the glass. "Another one." He said to the bartender, who sighed and filled the glass again with what Harry could see was a single-malt whiskey.
He'd just kissed Harry Potter! This was madness, absolute madness! Draco felt horrible - like he'd betrayed the trust of his father. Draco felt like he just ignored and besmirched everything he had ever been taught. Draco looked at the floor and his eyes fell on the socks he was wearing.
And she vanished behind a shelf. Not two minutes later, she came back with a big book in her hand, brought it to Madame Pince and shoved it into her bag.
Mind your attidute, Potter.", said Snape.
Hermione must have noticed Malfoy's helpless look, so she asked smiling. Malfoy then found the courage to nod and get up. He whipped out his wand in the kitchen just like Hermione and Harry did, and together they sliced fruit and bread with magic and Hermione set the table outside.
It only took him one minute until Draco was coming too, pressing his face into the pillow to muffle his cry. Potter smiled and cleaned them both up with the wand that lay on his bedside table.
"Really, Draco. What have you done? Have you no shame?"
"It's not poisoned." Harry said with a laugh.
Harry smiled. "It is. But I noticed you don't have any Muggle books in your collection."
"What?" Draco asked once again.
"What do I owe the pleasure?", she asked and folded her hands into her lap.
After a few minutes, three men and a woman stepped into the office. Harry recognized one of the men from a picture in the newspaper. They were still three minutes early to the official meeting date, but they dived right into it.
He had given an interview two days ago, a week after Malfoy's proposal, and the article finally came out. Harry had already seen his and Malfoy's name in bold letters across the front page and was excited about what the article would say. Of course, he and Draco didn't care if they would have written anything bad, they were used to it and still loved each other, but it was always exciting.
And then Malfoy nodded slowly.
"How long have I been sleeping?", he asked Hermione the second Madame Pomfrey walked away.
"No, you twat. I just want to check if you're alright.", Potter answered and rolled his eyes, looking down quickly, but Draco didn't miss his cheeks blushing hardly.
Harry shook his head. "Nonsense. What do you mean?"
"Don't mess it up for him." Weasley said with a firm gaze that Draco would have expected from Granger.
Come in.", Professor McGonnagal said loudly. Harry opened the door and stepped over the door step. McGonnagal turned around.
"Malfoy." Harry said and added after a short pause: " He asked if he could come over."
"Okay." Said Hermione, "I'll make the eggs and you look after the sausages."
Tears dropped onto the paper and the ink blurred a bit.
"Actually I am," Potter answered.
As much as Draco would have loved to annoy Potter with what he'd just said, he was more interested in why Potter was worried about him. Potter cleared his throat.
"Um...", he started, took a breath and continued unsure.
"Thank you." Malfoy said and faked a polite smile.
Yes, indeed. He liked it.
"Merlin, Potter! Do something else." Draco said annoyed.
with him," Harry said, what literally made Ron shut his mouth. Harry took a deep breath and gathered all his courage.
"I...", Potter protested, but Draco shook his head.
, Malfoy?" The guy spat the words like venom.
"Don't stop," Potter murmured and Draco smiled even wider.
will be late too?", Hermione repeated Harry's words.
"What do you want?" Weasley asked rudely.
of all people was the one making Harry hard. And Harry was the one making Malfoy hard. What a twisted world. Harry guessed this would be another thing Malfoy could do when he was sad - kiss him.
"We're currently just looking around, but we will definitely come back to you." Harry said politely.
"Don't tell me that you're sorry.", he said.
"Oh", she too said, "Hello."
"Everything. If you can."
"Harry, we were just...", a third boy said. Potter laughed.
Ron sat down again and looked at Draco, who talked to Crabbe.
Harry leaned back and Draco sat up and pulled him down so Harry sat in his lap. Harry breathed heavily. When he felt Draco touching his hand, he felt calmness rushing from his fingertips through his whole body. Harry opened his eyes again and everything was blurry, he wiped the tears out of his eyes. Draco looked at him with hurt grey eyes.
The three of them walked inside. The first two desks Harry saw were empty. They walked a few steps and Harry, Neville and Ron scanned the library until Harry spotted - sitting on a quiet table - Hermione. She was sitting next to a boy Harry didn't know. His arm was wrapped around her shoulder and she was more laughing than studying. Harry and Neville looked at each other and then at Ron. He stood there frozen still, his face white as chalk.
"Shhh." Hermione's whisper, or the clatter of pans, woke Harry up, "Be quiet."
"Yeah I am," Draco said and shrugged, grinning widely.
Before Draco could answer, the bells outside beat midnight.
But all the other emotions came up and Draco started crying again. He hoped no one would hear him. He crawled over to his bedside table. Draco threw the letter to his mother on the floor. Beneath it was the picture Draco had stolen from Potter's drawer. Potter in the picture laughed happily, while Draco sobbed and put the bottle to his lips. How has it come to this?
Harry breathed out hardly. He had no idea where they had been. When Malfoy saw his clueless face, he broke out in laughter. Harry had to laugh too. Alcohol was making him feel very weird.
Draco sat there and ate in silence. Alone.
"Lumos." Harry mumbled, got up and walked over to his desk.
Draco was afraid they would hex him and this time no one would come to rescue him because Potter was the only one who cared about him and right now he didn't care. Draco kept his gaze at the floor and avoided eye contact with the other students.
When Harry had entered the dorm, his roommate was sitting on his bed, ignoring him and reading a magazine.
"And now kiss me!", Draco said and Potter laughed.
Draco nodded.
"Don't be annoying." Draco said.
"Hey," Potter said casually.
Harry placed a oft smile on his lips when Malfoy looked up at him. Harry felt a warm and strange feeling in his chest. The two boys looked at each other for a long time and
"Theo, let him sleep!", Zabini's voice hissed.
"Yes, but what
Harry shook his head. "His grandmother wanted to have him for Christmas Eve, so I can have him for Christmas Day."
"I do. I really do."
"You should have them all the time. Everywhere.", Draco grinned. Potter raised his head sharply and treated Draco to a breathtaking kiss.
"Draco.", he said calmly.
Draco opened the door to their room and smiled to himself. Potter sat with Loony Lovegood on
And with that, Malfoy left and vanished through the door into the house. Harry could hear the front door being shut just before he too got up and ran after Malfoy. But Harry didn't have to run that far. Malfoy sat on their doorstep with his broom and shoes in his hands. Harry sat down next to him and took the broom out of his hand.
"Draco-"
"You really have to get her off your back." He whispered and Potter nodded agreeing.
Harry watched him, smiling.
Harry nodded. "Still, everyone accused me and I didn't have anyone to talk to than my friends, who looked at me like I was going insane." Harry waited for a moment to look at Malcolm. "But do you really think that petrifying people in the whole school is as bad as being in the same house as Voldemort?"
Harry nodded.
"Oh," she said surprised.
"You two are ridiculous." Hermione said, shaking her head. "I mean it. Can't you just pull yourself together and do it?"
On Wednesday, Harry had the whole day off but he had decided to drop by the Ministry and pick up some papers. Malfoy hadn't slept at Harry's for the night, so Harry only left Ron a note in the morning. He grabbed a toast for himself and a banana for Teddy and put on his jacket. It had been raining non-stop for three days now and the sky was almost as dark as at night. Harry held Teddy in his arm and they took the Floo Network to the Ministry of Magic. Luckily Teddy was such a calm baby, what made it easy for Harry to take him with to the Ministry for a short period of time.
"I just wanted to say that you look just like him."
"The wandless healing.", Draco picked at his shirt nervously.
They sat in silence for a while, Harry felt his cheeks burning. He didn't know if he should keep talking or if Draco had heard enough, but he couldn't stop himself.
"I've never been here before but I've heard from a couple of witches that it's very good." Mrs Malfoy said and opened the doors.
Draco scoffed. He wasn't surprised that this was the part Theo argued with. They have all been dancing to his tune for all these years and - Draco knew it himself - it was hard to break these old patterns.
Malfoy made a step back and hit the wall. Harry's heart started hammering against his ribs, he wouldn't be surprised if Malfoy heard it beating. He was going to say no. Of course. Harry had known it! Why was he even stupid enough to ask him?
"You're an idiot, Draco.", Harry said, shaking his head.
"Harry?", Hermione asked, "Are you okay?"
"Hermione.", he laughed, "You're choking me." Hermione let go of him and flushed.
"I don't know," Harry said, this felt too familiar.
Draco smiled without looking up from his book and squeezed the warm hand softly. Potter then opened his book too and the four of them sat there in silence, revising a lot of the stuff they had learnt that year already.
The two talked for a while, until the professor advised Harry to go and have some fun with his friends.
Even though Harry knew that Malfoy tried to hide it, he still scowled at the look of Hermione. In his opinion she wasn't a real with because she was Muggle-born. Unbothered by that, Hermione emptied her shopping bag in the kitchen and put everything where it belonged.
"Don't tell me you've been up all night thinking about this." Ron said and Harry chuckled.
"You do look at me now!", Malfoy repeated sternly. So Harry did.
"It's going good between you two, hm?" She asked.
"He wanted to put me in Slyhterin.", he repeated.
Neville smiled and left.
"I- um..." Dean stammered. No one really knew what to say. It felt like Harry was just caught kissing someone. But apparently Harry kissing
Malfoy had an eyebrow raised and a crooked smile on his lips. Harry's hands started to sweat because of unexplainable reasons. He tried to hide that he was breathing hardly and let Malfoy inside just as first drops of rain came down. They went into the living room that Harry had tidied up a bit after Hermione and Ron had left.
He looked at Malfoy, who avoided his eyes and was concentrated on his own breakfast.
"Did you want to say something?", Hermione asked and looked at Harry with a worried look.
Hermione and Ron looked at each other and Ron shrugged. Harry smiled to himself.
As Harry and Hagrid reached McGonagall and Draco, Hagrid let go of Harry's arm hesitantly and took a seat next to Mrs Weasley, who rubbed his gigantic hand comforting. Ron, Hermione, Neville and Luna stood right behind Harry, the boys wearing dark blue suits, the girls violet dresses. Harry looked at Draco, who seemed to be just as nervous as he was. Behind Draco were Theo, Pansy, Blaise and - to Harry's surprise - Gregory Goyle, all dressed in the same clothes as Harry's friends. McGonagall stepped to the podium between the two grooms and smiled. Harry smiled, too, and looked at the hundreds of faces in front of him. He recognized so many of them, also the ones who didn't attend Hogwarts for their last year were here.
"How bad
Harry furrowed his brow. What was?
Seamus passed Dean a Galleon.
"Anyways.", Narciss said, "This is the newest picture in here."
She smiled at Potter and waited for him to say something, but he didn't even look at her. He looked at the menu card, while the woman clicked with her tongue until Potter looked up. She smiled even wider and blushed. Draco could punch her in the face.
"Bye Ron.", he replied.
It felt horrible to lie to Ron and Hermione but he didn't want to involve Malfoy.
Draco watched Potter kneeling down on the floor in front of his bed and unpacking his own suitcase as well. He only had colourful clothes, the only dark clothing Potter owned were his school robes. Weirdo. Even his underwear was colourful. Draco placed his books on the shelf and put the box next to them.
"He wouldn't like failing Potions," Harry rescued him quickly.
"Damn it!", he cursed and let himself fell face-down on his bed.
"You're coming?" She asked and Harry asked himself why she was even asking when she won't accept a 'no'.
"Mom.", he said happily and for the first since one day he smiled.
"Harry, you're not going to do something stupid, are you?", she asked.
"I have no idea." She said.
emotion in those grey eyes.
should go out?"
"Mother.", Malfoy rolled his eyes.
As Harry woke up, sudden panic swept over him. It was one day before the ball and he still had no one to go with. And not in his wildest dreams, he would ask
Harry wasn't asked to until he, Ron and Hermione went upstairs to Ron's room and made themselves comfortable on the beds. Sitting cross legged on his bed, Harry shoved a chocolate frog into his mouth. When he saw the expectant look in Hermione's eyes, Harry sighed. Now was the time to talk about it and they wouldn't let him get away this time.
Harry opened his eyes again and rolled his eyes. "Why do you have to be like that?"
"Oh, Harry. What's wrong? Should I get Ron?", Hermione asked worried.
"She can leave now. I will take her home and stay with her for as many days as she needs."
"Now?" He shuddered a little.
"We have to do this more often as long as the weather is this good." Ron shouted from his room over the hall to Harry's room, where he stood and pulled out fresh clothes.
relationship. And I'm not searching one but even if I would, I wouldnt search it in
He went around and hugged the rest of his friends - Ginny, Neville and Dean - while Ron and Hermione held onto each other. When they started kissing, the rest of the group laughed and cheered.
"I'm sorry."
Harry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up and followed Draco onto the brightly lit dance floor. Harry tried to avoid everyone's eyes and looked at Draco, who grabbed Harry's hand. Harry noticed Draco's fingers were shaking nervously and brushed with his thumb over Draco's hand. Draco smiled a bit and the music started playing. Draco smirked and placed Harry's other hand on his waist. Harry laughed and they started dancing.
"Pansy.", Draco said with a dark look and Harry took his hand.
Malfoy didn't answer, he only grinned widely. There was a sparkle in his eyes. Harry stepped closer and grabbed Draco's left wrist. He turned his inner arm upwards and looked at it intensely.
"I won't turn around now.", Potter laughed.
? Harry bit his fist and leaned forward to hear better.
"So she hated me as well. Dumbledore left a letter for my aunt and my uncle in which he explained the situation and in which he said that they should tell me the truth before the day I turn eleven. They didn't. They told me my parents died in a car crash and they told me nothing about me being a wizard. My uncle hated me more than everything on this world and my cousin bullied me until I was fifteen. I had to live inside the cupboard for eleven years, until one day thousands of owls arrived. Each of them carried a letter from Hogwarts, but my uncle forbade me to read these letters. On my eleventh birthday, Hagrid broke into our hut and told me everything about my parents, my past and myself. I left with him and hated the family I had to live with even more."
"Stop following me, asshole!" Malfoy shouted.
Neville and Luna came by their place at around six p.m. They sat outside for a bit until it got rather chilly and Luna and Hermione wanted to go back inside. They talked for quite a while. After the boys had finished their beer, they set off to the pub where they would meet the rest of the group. Ginny, Dean and Seamus were already waiting.
"Was someone else we know here?" Harry asked, trying to figure out if Malfoy had visited him.
"A letter." Draco answered, "Obviously."
"You can also simply have complementive Patronuses with a loved one, and it doesn't always happen. It's very extraordinary. My mom and my dad had complemented ones."
"You don't think-"
Draco dragged his fingers lightly through the curls at the base of Potter's cock, and Potter let out a sound like steam escaping from a kettle. Potter's cock jerked as Draco pushed his knees apart and wanked the full length of his shaft, slow and intense. Potter tried to thrust upwards, but Draco pushed him back down.
They hugged and left the dorm.
"What's going on?" Ron asked, sounding unusually sensitive.
Ron jumped to his feet and hurried to the portrait hole. Harry laughed and followed them outside. The Great Hall was already filled with students and teachers. Dumbledore sat as usual in the middle of the staff table and talked to McGonnagal. Harry, Hermione and Ron sat down next to Seamus, Dean and Neville. Even before Harry started eating, he looked over to the Slytherin table, searching the familiar blond head, but Malfoy wasn't anywhere to be seen, only Parkinson and his other idiotic friends sat there. Harry sighed.
like him when he couldn't get those bad memories out of his head?
Theo tapped on the microphone to get everyone's attention. "Since we're the best men of the husbands, we thought we would say a few words."
The librarian looked at him with a frown on her face and then went back to her notebook. Draco shook his head and walked over to the books about Muggles.
"Why do you care anyways?", he asked.
"Will you please be quiet now!" Madame Pince snapped and walked around the shelf, "This is a library not a-"
"I know," he said quietly.
"No, excuse me, but you said I am the man of your dreams."
"Of course, we had been here for one and a half hours, I don't get drunk that quickly." Malfoy said.
"Now we have to fix my hair." He shook his head again.
He poured himself some tea and lit a cigarette.
to us?"
"Don't." He said loudly, his hand raised, "I don't need your pity. As I said, you don't know how I feel! You don't have a mother to worry about! Your mother is dead!"
close. So close that Harry could hear him breathing. Harry smiled and closed his eyes, ready for a kiss. He felt Malfoy bending towards him, leaning against him and whispering into his ear "You're a git."
Someone stepped out from behind the curtain. It wasn't- like Harry had suspected- Hermione. It was Malfoy, whose eyes were watering and cheeks were blushing. Harry smiled, even though he had to take a second to get used to the way Malfoy looked. Malfoy opened his mouth and Harry hoped he wouldn't be mad.
conflicts. Harry's heart skipped a beat as he heard someone ringing the bell. He ran downstairs, almost fell down the last couple of steps, but got balance again and slid towards the door on his socks.
"Don't you breaking his heart, Potty."
Draco lay nuzzling the crook of Potter's neck, breathing the familiar scent of sweets, with Potter's skin so warm and clean- smelling underneath, and in barely two minutes, Draco was asleep.
Ron shuddered and Harry laughed, sliding out from under Draco and sat up. Draco sat up as too.
?", Draco asked.
"Don't ever come near him again." He said and took Harry's hand, "Come on."
"Did you mean it?", Harry asked and Draco nodded slowly.
Ginny and Hermione went upstairs and passed Charlie on the stairs as he was on his way down. He looked surprised when he saw Ron and Harry and laughed.
Harry saw the chance and kissed him softly on his collar bone. Harry pressed his body against Draco's and their cocks were drifting together. Harry sucked at the pale skin at Draco's collar bone and bit gently. Draco moaned loudly, Harry didn't know whether it was because of his sucking or because of the incredible feeling of their groins rubbing together.
"Malfoy..." Potter whined again.
Nott shrugged. "She must have gotten a letter as well for she is his mother. I got one because I live with him, you know?"
"Oh, come on." He said, "I know you're happy."
"I'm just not going. Drop it, okay."
Malfoy just nodded. "No problem."
He didn't plan to go out tonight. Malfoy was tricking him and Harry knew it. No one of the others said anything, probably because they knew that Harry already was in a bad mood.
"Why?", Ginny asked.
Harry smiled to himself and blushed.
"What's up?" Harry noticed the change in his tone when he talked to someone he knew.
"Just told her I won't hurt him." Harry shrugged and scratched the back of his hand uncomfortably.
Malfoy opened his eyes again and nodded, but Harry wasn't convinced. He remembered a time when Malfoy wouldn't show his emotions to anyone even when he was at his personal limit, but now he sat here next to Harry and showed almost everything he was feeling.
Draco only shook his head. He raised his hand and Harry saw that his fingers were trembling more than ever before. Harry raised his own hand too and his fingers shook at least as much as Draco's did. Draco slowly moved his trembling hand towards Harry's prick, that jerked with interest at the touch. Harry took a deep, long breath. Draco conjured some lube over his hands and slowly bent over Harry.
Harry felt his cheeks burning and his heart racing. His palms got very sweaty and he slowly wiped them at his trousers, hoping Malfoy wouldn't notice. Harry sipped at his beer to cool down and Malfoy sipped at his whiskey.
"Fine. Good talk.", Weasley answered and grinned.
"I dare you to trick me."
"I was a big fan of the Chudley Cannons years ago, but currently I'm more of a fan of Wimbourne Wasps."
"You know how I was raised." Draco finally said after what felt like hours, "My parents were strict, my aunt was at Azkaban. Let's just say I didn't have a very easy childhood, I guess kind of like you. That's maybe also why I was such a jerk, I needed this to make myself feel superior."
Draco smiled and kissed Potter on the forehead. He mumbled something sleepy. Draco laughed and cupped Potter's face with his hands.
"I'm Flynn from Ravenclaw. And I didn't know Hermione had a boyfriend," he answered. Harry and Neville leaned closer. "Why didn't you know?" Harry asked.
Harry thanked her smiling and shook her hand.
"Get air or smoke?" Harry asked with an eyebrow raised.
Parkinson scowled and they walked away.
"Can we buy you some drinks?" Theo asked loudly.
"A meeting?" Draco asked, "Sure, if the great Harry Potter isn't available then I have to get through the day on my own."
"Can we go in?", he asked. Harry sighed amd nodded.
Harry clicked at a picture where Harry and Malfoy were walking down a street, drunk. He scrolled further and came to a video.
"Alright. Can I leave some of the food here for him?", Draco replied and she nodded again.
"We will miss you too." Harry said and put his arms around Neville's and Dean's shoulders, "But we'll see each other on Christmas, won't we?"
Malfoy. Malfoy laughing at Harry, Malfoy hexing Hermione, Malfoy's sneering face, Malfoy on the astronomy tower pointing his wand at Dumbledore. Harry cried out quietly and opened his eyes again just to find that his eyes started to fill with water. How would he ever explain this to Malfoy? Harry liked Malfoy, but how could he
"Potter.", Draco whispered, "Hey, Potter, wake up."
Draco thought,
Harry drank from his milk.
Harry smiled and had a strange feeling in his stomach. Narcissa turned the page again. In one picture, Draco stood at platform 9 3/4 and looked very proud. Harry smiled again.
"Malfoy, I think you should go.", Granger said coldly.
Someone stumbled into the common room.
"He told us he was going to see you. And he didn't come home, so we figured he must have stayed here, but we didn't hear anything from him since then." Nott explained.
Harry smiled too. He didn't know whether he should be was relieved or not, if the wise woman in front of him just knew about him and Malfoy or if she knew about
Hermione gave him a questioning look, but Ron ignored her.
Harry stood up and pulled the blonde to his feet. Harry took Malfoy's hands and lay them on his hip. Then Harry started dancing. He sang. And he felt terribly awkward. But then Malfoy started smiling. And Harry felt better. They danced slow and danced fast while Harry sang slow and fast songs. All the time they looked each other in the eyes and Harry felt great. This was his purpose.
"I- I don't know what to say... I mean-"
"It's alright." Harry said.
"Is everything alright?" Ron asked carefully.
He turned around and looked at Malfoy, who stared at him. He had used Legilimens to talk to Harry through his thoughts.
Harry smiled and took a quick shower, then walked down to the Great Hall.
"Shut it, boys.", he said annoyed.
Romilda glared at Harry as if he'd just told her the most unlikely story.
She grinned and held her hand in front of her mouth. Draco pulled a face and stuck his tongue out. They were disgusting. He couldn't listen to any more of this, collected his stuff and stood up.
Malfoy made a sound that almost could have been a laugh. It made Harry smile. He sipped at his beer and watched Malfoy drinking his whisky while his gaze was fixed at something outside the window. The waitress brought mugs of coffee to the business men and Harry wondered how many cups they have already had. Harry and Malfoy drank their drinks in silence as Harry felt the awkwardness slowly washing away.
"You shouldn't be. Tomorrow is the ball and we still have no partner.", Ron said and looked furious.
"What do you think?" Hermione answered and her eyes filled with water again.
"Let's go and go to stupid McGonnagal." Harry laughed and sat up too.
"WHAT?", Potter asked loudly, "Why not? Draco? Why not?" Draco laughed lightly.
Malfoy laughed. "Shut up, Potter. You look so amazing today I can't describe it."
"Hermione.", Weasley hissed.
"Yeah, I never really liked it.", he said and laughed.
Draco smiled and nodded.
Now it was Draco's turn to bite his lip. Potter smiled slightly.
"What is it?" He asked, but Malfoy didn't answer.
"Should I leave?", Harry asked and secretly, he already knew the answer. Draco didn't make any sign of wanting Harry to leave or wanting him to stay.
It let out a sound of approval and as Harry opened the window it soared through the air and out of sight. Harry stood at the window for a while until someone knocked on his door.
"I'm coming!", the healer announced back.
He stepped into the shower behind Draco and put his arms around Draco's waist. His back was pressed against Harry's stomach and he missed Draco's neck.
He had the complete wrong idea of what Draco was going to do. Draco grabbed both of Potter's wrists with his right hand and pinned them against the wall above Potter's head. Potter was struggling to get out of Draco's grip.
He cleared his throat. "I've met Potter."
"Thank you.", he said happily, "Thank you, Mr Malfoy, thank you very much!"
"Juice?" She offered.
"Draco, calm down.", he said calmly.
"Oh, no, not again.", he laughed, "I can't sing."
Ron laughed sarcastically.
"Thank you.", Potter smiled.
She had punched Draco in the face- of course she didn't like him!
"No." Potter said suddenly very soft and kneeled next to Draco, " I won't leave you. Not this time."
"Nothing, nothing," Draco said but couldn't stop smiling.
"Thank you, Sir." A third witch said. She seemed the eldest and Harry wondered if maybe she knew him from Hogwarts.
"Yes. He wanted me to tell you, that there is nothing between the two of them. And he's missing his doe. No idea what it means, but-"
Draco shook his head. "My parents are very strict about that and I have been raised that strictly. I haven't touched anyone ever."
"Use a happy memory.
After a while, someone knocked at his door.
"Yes, Yes, I have understood this, but...
"Goodnight, Potter.", Draco said quietly and entwined his fingers with Harry's.
"Yeah, mate, good luck," Ron encouraged Harry as well.
"What's going on?" Harry asked suspiciously.
"A wuss." Blaise repeated and stood up as well.
"Let's say Professor Quirrell."
"You know he's going to be an Auror, don't you?"
"In the kitchen."
is just as awkward and weird as Harry talking to
"Sit down, sit down.", Petunia said and waved them to the couch.
"It's Harry's birthday today." Ron said.
"First of all, congratulations to both of you." Ron said with a smile, "I can't believe I won't be able to call you Malfoy anymore."
"No, no, no." Harry said hastily, "I'll take it."
As Harry put his wand into his pocket, grabbed his bag with one and the cage and his broom with his other hand, he felt his heart racing. He was actually going to go to Malfoy Manor - voluntarily. Harry smiled at his friends for one last time before he disapparated.
They laughed and Malfoy came walking towards them.
Harry nodded. "It was."
"Sorry I ruined it today." Ron said quietly while their were scrubbing pans, "I guess it's hard enough without me bitching about him."
And just because Potter was now in the hospital wing, where it smelled like disinfectant and old lady.
So Draco told her everything about their talks at night and their kiss and his Patronus lesson. And the powerful memory. Narcissa smiled at that point.
"Yeah." Ron said and stirred in the sauce on the stove.
"Well.", Lucius said emotionless and straightened his cloak.
Ron came downstairs. "Morning." He mumbled, poured himself some tea and sat down next to Harry.
"Malfoy! Stop!" Harry said loudly and out of breath.
"I can go with you.", Ron said, but Hermione shook her head.
After the girls came out too, Harry used the chance to talk to Hermione.
. But Finnegan? And Goyle? What?"
The two of them looked at him with a weird look in their eyes Harry couldn't quite pinpoint. Hermione bit her lip and Ron's finger's couldn't hold still.
"W-wouldn't interest me? Baby, everything that has to do with you interest me! Are you kidding me? I want to know everything about your family. That's why I wanted to visit your uncle the filthy Muggle!", Draco said and kissed Harry.
? And then... Oh my god! Harry’s brain seized up before he could even finish the thought.
and shit. But now it was too late. Ron had seen them and there was no chance of making it unseen.
"Madame Pomfrey!", Draco shouted as he entered the hospital.
"My son!"
"Because it's Harry's birthday and he has the right to go out.", Draco answered.
"Oh, for Heaven's sake, Potter. Pull yourself together." Malfoy spat but couldn't hold back a smile himself.
"Ah, Harry and his Malfoy.", said Ron with a disgusted look.
The first thing Draco and Blaise decided to do was to find a seat. The second thing was to pack their suitcases into their own compartment, and the third was, Draco called together all the other Slytherins. They sat together and started to whisper.
"Yes." Harry said and wiped the tears off his face, "Yes, I'm okay. You know, I thought I would have a normal year when the Triwizard Tournament came around. And as if it wasn't hard enough that I had to fight dragons and risk my life involuntary, everyone hated me and I saw him- I saw Voldemort coming back and-"
"So, how are you going to get through the next task?", Hermione asked Harry.
The sudden look on Potter's face hurt Draco so bad. He looked betrayed and hurt and guilty. "Why?" He asked and Draco noticed his fingers were trembling as he took them away from the doorknob.
"I started after..." Malfoy stopped.
"I don't think you should go on your own," Granger said, "Harry might not want to talk to you, who knows."
"Please don't leave. Not yet.", he mumbled.
"What do you want to tell me?", Draco asked and furrowed his brow.
Harry had finished three exams and received good grades for them. He didn't know what Malfoy got and he didn't care. Malfoy didn't talk much. Actually, he never talked to Harry. One time he wanted Harry to quit singing. And one time he had asked Harry if he had to use every opportunity to annoy him. And he had told Harry to fuck off when Harry had asked what was in the box. And that was it.
Now there was no Potter who waisted all the hot water.
"Did Pomfrey-"
Harry looked inside and, yes indeed, Malfoy lay on his bed and slept. Harry sneaked over to his bed to get a closer look at the blonde boy. He had a slight frown on his face and breathed relaxed. Harry could seer he heard him mumbled something in his sleep.
"It's not the time for it now. I'll tell you some day probably.", Draco answered.
"Malfoy. Do you think he likes you too?"
Draco rolled his eyes again and lit a cigarette before he started to talk. "It was fine. I got there, everyone stared, Potter was happy that I came, I smoked almost a pack of cigarettes, we left the pub at three, I fell asleep on his couch and then I had breakfast with his idiot friends."
The three nodded and Fred left to help whomever just called. Harry turned to Hermione and Ron and found that they looked just as concerned as he felt.
"What's in the box?" Potter asked and craned his neck curiously.
Harry sighed and concentrated on the text, not his loud beating heart. He took a deep breath and started singing:
"What do you think these men do?" Harry asked, subtly pointing at the table with the four men.
"Hey guys.", Harry said and forced a smile. They sat down opposite of him.
"What for?", Harry asked annoyed and sat up, pulling the shirt over his head.
"I don't think you understand what a very highly regarded family we are in our circles, and I will not accept you or your mother to bring such shame on us. I wish to hear from you soon, otherwise I would have to break out of here. Don't you dare not answer me!
Teddy's grandmother picked him up the day before the trio was going to Hogwarts. Harry always hated these moments when he stood in the door and had to watch her take his cute little boy. Teddy always cried when he had to leave Harry, what made it even harder. This time Andromeda promised Harry could have him in a week again, because she would be taking a trip.
"Good. Does Draco need any assistance? Should I come with you?"
"April 29th." He read "Dear Narcissa. In case I will die in this battle, open this letter and read it. Also tell Draco about everything I'm telling you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for pulling you into this, for making our lives horrible, just because I'm such a fool. I didn't want this. I never did. I didn't want war. I didn't want to be his follower for ages. I was young and hated the mudbloods, now I'm grown up but have to hate them all along."
"He wouldn't?"
"Alright. Let's go.", Harry said, taking Draco's hand and they walked downstairs into the common room.
"Neville? Are you there?" He asked and waited.
"It's already late. Let's go to bed.", Potter said smiling and Draco nodded.
"Don't tell me you don't know Oreos either." Harry said.
They left to get Madame Pomfrey so she could thoroughly check on Harry. But only Ron came back with her, Hermione was off somewhere else, Ron didn't know where. After Harry was told that he was alright but needed to stay for the night and then have a few more days of bedrest, Ron sat down on a stool next to Harry and started filling him in on the things that had happened the last week.
"She's right, mate. Talk to McGonnagal.", Ron Weasley agreed.
"Stop being so suspicious, Potty. I said it and I meant it. Don't be so shocked.", Draco said. Harry couldn't trust his ears. His jaw dropped. This was a joke. It needed to be.
"Today, we met with Harry Potter to discuss the issue he had in mind for a long time now. The boy is willing to donate a sum of money to three different orphanages, magical and Muggle. We asked what inspired him to do so. "I am an orphan myself. And I hated the people I had to live with. They treated me poorly and I never had the chance to fully be who I really was. I didn't know I was a wizard, I was refused to talk to people and I didn't learn to know the truth about my parents," he told us, "Also, Tom Riddle was an orphan." We were very surprised that Mr. Potter brought up this specific example."
"He's my godson."
? Draco guessed living all alone wouldn't be good for her.
"Harry, what's going on?"
Draco nodded and closed the door.
"With Ron and Hermione."
Harry heard the lock clicking and he knew that Malfy had locked the door. Finally. Harry turned back to his comic and sighed annoyed.
"You are!"
Harry laughed and left. Malfoy closed the door behind him and locked it, what made Harry grin. Harry took out his own uniform and got dressed. Just when he tried to tie his tie, Malfoy stepped out of the bathroom. Unlike than Harry's, Malfoy's tie was perfectly tied, his shirt was tucked into his trousers and those were perfectly straightened.
Harry shook his head. No, she did not. And he never talked about that with anyone. Like, he couldn't speak with Ron about what his sister and Harry were doing. And he didn't talk to Hermione about that kind of stuff.
"You're not coming?" Harry asked when he saw Malfoy still lying in bed.
Harry couldn't hold back a smile, but he also felt really sorry for Malfoy. It must have been such a big change. Harry just sighed and smiled emphatically. He didn't want Malfoy to feel bad right now. Harry's hand twitched, he thought for a second, and then carefully lay his hand on Malfoy's shoulder. Malfoy glanced over at Harry, who suddenly realized what the hell he was doing. Harry pulled his hand back and slid away from Malfoy. Why did he do this? Just when Harry didn't want to put Malfoy in the same position as the last time.
"My child-thing?" Harry asked and laughed.
Draco reached with his hand over the table and grabbed Harry's hand, that lay next to his plate on the table. Potter looked at Draco, who smiled sadly and Potter smiled too. He even bent over and kissed Draco.
"Hey, Harry, do you already have your robes?", Dean asked.
Harry smiled and snuggled against Malfoy's chest.
"I better go and look after him. I don't want him to be like hell to me." Harry said and Hermione and Ron nodded.
"Where's she now?", Malfoy asked and Harry was astonished that Malfoy showed interest.
"Something wrong?" Draco asked even though this question was obviously unnecessary.
"Father-"
Harry kicked off his shoes and scrambled into his bed. Closing his eyes, he flinched the bridge of his nose. "Hermione is driving me crazy. She thinks everything and everyone is trying to kill me. Including you."
"No. No, it's alright.", answered Hermione.
His fingers brushed Harry's hip,
Harry crawled down from Malfoy's lap and sat down cross-legged on the bed. Draco, too, sat up straight and leaned against the headboard. Harry grabbed his wand and waved it to close the curtains and to shut out the light. They now sat in complete darkness, all that made Harry sure about Malfoy's presence was his silent breathing and the thouch of his hand on Harry's. Harry wasn't sure who would start to speak first.
"Like James?" Hermione asked seemingly confused.
"But, it's, I dont know..."
"Shut up.", he said sternly. Harry froze.
"Professor McGonnagal would never joke about something like this." She said.
"No, it's not that," Draco assured him.
"I hope so." Harry said jokingly.
"Hey, are you alright?", Hermione asked. Harry rolled his eyes.
"I bought it when I was at Diagon Alley with Theo the other day. You know, when we met in the bookstore."
"Are you happy, Harry?" She asked.
"Wow. It looks more Gryffindor in here, than I thought.", he said.
Potter smiled and sipped his juice.
With that she wanted to tell him that his rightful chair was at the end of the table, but Draco shook his head. He couldn't imagine him sitting where
"Who's that?", Petunia snapped, looking at Draco.
"Yes. Good. Okay."
Harry and Malfoy walked past her and Harry thanked her for holding the door open. Mrs Malfoy called for the waiter, who showed them where to sit.
"You remember the day I got letters?" Malfoy asked and when Harry nodded, he said, "I got two, remember? The two owls?" Harry nodded again. "One was from my father, whose response to you've already read. The other one was from my mother, I replied to her as well, but when you decided to look through my stuff, you grabbed the upper letter which was unfortunately the one to my father," Malfoy explained, still holding out the letter.
He shuddered. Draco didn't look away from Harry, he just glared at him, his eyes dangerous and somehow full of lust.
"Draco. What are we doing here?" Theo asked.
"There are two types of Patronuses.", Harry explained.
"Potter, I want to talk to you."
"I'm sorry." He said quietly as if he was afraid anyone could hear him, "I'm sorry."
"Draco.", Greg said and nodded shyly.
"Boys, we need to go to herbology. Professor Sprout won't be too grateful if we're late again.", she said and Ron and Harry followed her out of the room.
"I'm soooo sorry you hate me. You know, I hate you too but for- for Harry I would do anything," Malfoy slurred and added whispering? "Anything." He came freakishly close to Nevilles face. "Anything," Malfoy whispered again. His breath was warm and smelled like alcohol.
"No I don't."
Harry just couldn't believe how much had happened since he had met Malfoy for the first time. Back then Malfoy had been an intimidating little boy offering Harry his friendship. And as the years went by, Harry had grown to hate that boy who made his life and his friends' lives miserable. Until finally, in sixth year, he had disappointed Harry the most.
"Did my mother want something?", he asked scared. McGonnagal shook her head.
"Hey, Harry's here." Ron shouted into the living room after he had stuck his head out of the kitchen door.
"I'm sorry, are you a family member?" The healer asked instead of answering Harry's question.
"Boys, you are annoying!", Nott said and Harry watched the door handle behind pushed down and froze.
"Will Teddy stay with my family the whole time?" Ron asked and Harry nodded.
"What's wrong?", Harry asked.
"He's probably upstairs.", Potter shrugged.
Harry grabbed Draco's hand and lay the comb back to the sink. Draco looked at him, confused.
"Don't try to talk to me, Harry.", Ginny cut him off rudely, "You were the one who broke up with me without any reason and now-"
"Have you seen Malfoy already?", Harry asked and looked around in the Hall. He thought that Malfoy was probably eating in the kitchens again, but he still hoped that he would see him during his breakfast in the Hall too.
The last day had passed too fast for Draco's liking. He would have loved to spend more time with Pansy before they weren't going to see each other until the next holidays. Draco got up and dressed himself as fast as he could. Draco went downstairs where normally his father was already sitting in the dining room, but today there was only his mother placing the dishes on the table.
better than sitting all alone.
"Upstairs." Harry answered, "All of our rooms are there and two bathrooms."
"To be honest, Hermione, I- I haven't got a clue what the next task is going to be.", he answered.
But not at his bare chest, what made Draco wonder. Potter was looking at Draco's face.
"No. I came here to tell you right away.", he lied quickly. Of course, he didn't feel obliged to tell them what he really did.
"What are you looking at?" Draco snapped annoyed.
So Theo and Blaise left after lunch and told Draco not to do anything stupid. He only rolled his eyes and shut the door. Draco bewitched the walking stick to stand in one place and went to his room to pick out some clothes. Luckily, Draco's wardrobe was big enough to have several outfits, but his really good clothes were at Malfoy Manor. Draco thought for a second, then limped back to the living room and took the Floo Network to his mother's.
"But it's what you said." Potter answered and breathed in heavily.
"What, Malfoy? What do you want?"
Harry shook his head. "I ate at home."
", Draco made quotation marks with his fingers, "And second, I won't tell you."
So he won't be in their room now. Draco walked out and closed the door noiselessly.
"Tomorrow we will contact you as soon as she is awake and ready to be visited again." The healer finished.
Potter grinned. "You took off your clothes." He said.
"I wanted to know the family my boyfriend grew up with.", Draco answered.
"Let's make a deal", Malfoy said, "You don't have nightmares anymore and I won't have to wake up every few minutes."
"Oh my God Potter, I swear if you don't shut up right now I will-" But Draco wasn't going to do anything, because before he had even ended the sentence, Potter pressed a kiss on his lips.
Several hours later, late in the night, Nott and Zabini decided to go home to sleep and would bring over some of Draco's clothes in the morning. Harry didn't want to leave, he would stay until he was allowed to go inside and see Draco. He fell asleep in the uncomfortable chair before he knew it.
Ron let out a relieved sigh and Harry laughed again. Ron was obviously very uncomfortable with the situation. Harry glanced outside and saw that Hermione was talking to Malfoy, who looked very pale and sat stiffly.
"Are you going to tell your friends?", he asked. Harry made a questioning look.
"What do you want?", he asked and tried to keep his voice calm and steady.
They got up, Draco put on his trousers and they went downstairs. Ron was already awake and looked up from his newspaper as Harry and Draco entered the living room. Harry watched Ron and Malfoy closely and waited for a reaction.
"Potter has already informed me," McGonnagal said.
"You really have green eyes.", Draco said
"Who? Who are you going to ask?", Hermione asked, desperate for his answer, but Harry shook his head.
Ron clapped in his hands as loud as possible with his hand-knitted gloves and as every member of their snowball fight looked at him, he laughed.
"When did you say Potter will come?" Theo asked as Draco sat down on the sofa with them.
Harry didn't bother to ask why and argue with him, he was too stuffed and too tired for that. The day had gone by faster than he'd thought and he still needed to write Ron and Hermione. Luckily, Bond had come back with Draco's owl only shortly after they had gotten back inside from the garden.
Draco had been in his room all day and he had been alone and had to listen his parents shouting because a stranger lived in their house. Draco's mother didn't want it, but Draco's father said they had to. And Draco had been laying upstairs and had pressed his hands to his ears and had been crying.
Draco Malfoy might have lost his confidence for a moment while Voldemort had been there, but it definitely was back at all strength now. He knew what he wanted and he wasn't too afraid to show Harry. Being pulled close by Malfoy, everything inside Harry felt upside down. He started sweating but didn't want to catch his breath, too afraid he would have to let go of Malfoy's lips.
Hermione nodded slowly and they walked off. Harry waited in front of the classroom and listened.
Harry smiled.
"You like that?"
Harry nodded as well.
Harry sighed. He didn't feel like he had to apologise to Ron for taking Draco to the ball, because that was absolutely ridiculous.
"Champions over here, please!"
"You're so cute, Potty.", he said and kissed Harry on his cheek. Harry smiled.
Malfoy wasn't eating and he wondered what
"Come on, it doesn't take me a while day."
"How did you find out?", Hermione asked. Ron looked at Harry, who gave him with one look the permission to tell Hermione.
"I...", he started, but had no idea what exactly to say. Potter nodded.
When Hermione saw that everyone else was engaged in an activity, she asked Harry if he would sit down with her, but Harry watched Malfoy slowly leaving the common room.
"Thank you." Potter said and walked around the chair again.
"I've never been in here before." Malfoy said and stopped right at the door.
"Oh, just so.", Harry answered and walked off.
"Don't call me cute.", Draco said, still smiling.
Harry closed his ears. Tears streamed into his eyes. The last two sentences had hurt the most. Now he could hear Hermione's voice saying:
"Why do you choose?", Harry asked and rolled his eyes.
"He is
"Potter, we should go back. Didn't Granger want to talk to you?", Draco said, but didn't move.
"Is really everything alright?" She asked and Harry nodded, "You would tell us if it weren't, would you?"
Neville smiled widely and it made Harry so happy to see his friend like this. "I feel very honoured", he said still smiling, "And I promise I won't tell anyone about it. And I won't tell anyone that it's Malfoy."
"I have goosebumps.", he said and Harry laughed.
"Sorry.", he muttered.
Draco nodded understanding and looked at his hands, ashamed. He didn't exactly know what to say. He has always been annoyed by people calling Potter a hero, but Granger really
"Okay. You sure I can't do anything?"
"Get up," he said. Harry looked at him with an outraged look.
"When did you get back last night?" Theo asked without looking up from his Daily Prophet.
"What?", Harry asked confused, but Malfoy only grinned.
"It was," Potter answered, already lying down again.
Potter kicked them all the way off under the bedclothes, not wanting anything to get between him and Draco, who sighed at the feel of Potter's skin against his.
"What are you doing with those pyjamas?" Malfoy asked and mustered Harry.
And with that, the food was done. Harry whipped his wand and two plates and two sets of silverware flew to the couch table. Harry grabbed the pot and carried it to the table as well. He and Malfoy sat back down on the couch and Harry put food on each of their plates. When Malfoy took a bite, he looked at Harry with such satisfaction that Harry just had to laugh.
"What's so important?", Draco asked annoyed.
"Yeah. He told me about his relationship to his parents and his friends and about his childhood and Voldemort."
It didn't help to imagine him talking to Weaselette, so Draco pushed the unwanted thought away.
"Really beautiful lips," Potter mumbled, not fully aware that he said this out loud.
"Welcome back, Harry." He said, though his voice wasn't as clear coming through the portrait as Harry had known it in person.
he falling in love? No. Love was a very strong word. Maybe falling. But not in love.
"I mean it."
Harry hurried out of the Hall, ignoring Malfoy and the others. As soon as he reached the first deserted corridor, he leaned against a wall, closed his eyes and breathed out. He wished that Malfoy would simply take Harry's hands from his face and look at him with his grey- STOP! Harry opened his eyes again, no Malfoy in sight, and he ran up to Gryffindor tower. He named the password and climbed inside. The common room was empty, no single person in here. Harry hurried upstairs and slammed the door behind him. He didn't even bother to undress, he just threw himself - face forward - onto his bed and breathed heavily. After a second or so, Harry screamed into his pillow, louder and longer than he had ever before. What was wrong with him?
any more obvious?
Then, he pressed his head to the pillow and extended his neck, exposing the pale patch of skin between his ear and the red fabric of his pyjama. He looked up at Draco through a lock of dark hair that had fallen over his eye and waited expectantly.
His hands were really warm. Almost too warm.
Harry's lips twitched and he gripped Draco's hand. Harry moaned silently.
Malfoy didn't answer.
"I beg your pardon?", Harry asked surprised and Draco laughed.
Draco nodded and Harry was relieved he could bring this stupid idea out of his head. But seriously, he knew Draco better. He knew that he won't give up.
Harry looked over to his roommate's bed. It was similar to Harry's, but somehow different.
Harry chuckled. "I will."
Draco nodded while chewing his potato. "I did."
Harry could barely understand Ron because the music was ringing in his ears, but he nodded.
"She wanted me to move out." He said.
"What's going on?"
"My what?" Draco asked and started to sweat. He had to quickly think of a lie.
So Draco got up and looked through the drawer in Potter's bedside table. Pictures. There were pictures of Potter and his friends, pictures of Potter with this one cousin of Draco's mother, Potter with the Weasley family, Potter as a child with his parents. The last one made Draco smile really hard. It was a picture of Potter laughing. Draco knew it was from third year because Potter's hair has been extraordinarily spiky and cute in third year. Draco kept this picture and put it in his own drawer.
"Get out of my sight, Potter.", Draco said and waved him away. He was shocked to sound that mean. Potter grunted.
"Hm?"
"I'm also in love with you.", he said and his heart, God, his heart. It was hammering against his ribs and Harry wouldn't be surprised if Draco could hear it.
"And I told you! Because I wanted to show you that I care that you care."
"Yeah, me as well. I Don't have a problem with you being Malfoysexual."
"Look," Harry continued, trying to make it better, "I don't want to sound cruel, but I know this seems like a hopeless situation. You have to always remember there are people in your life that will always be there for you. Neville had no one but his grandmother until he came here, now he has a giant family who supports him. Just like myself."
"And I'm going to see Teddy, it's going to be really fun, I've already planned a lot," Harry said. He just kept talking because he didn't want to sound sad or disappointed and didn't want his friends to look at him like he was.
"I'm never too exhausted to annoy you.", Draco answered and laughed.
the accusation?" He asked, breathing very hard after every word, as though he had to pull himself together that he wasn't going to shout at his saviour.
Madame Pince stood on a shelf and checked a book. One table, far in the back, was filled with three students. Draco was relieved. He sneaked closer, hoping not to be noticed.
Narcissa nodded and turned her attention back to the pudding in front of her. Harry had already talked to Mrs Weasley and he wasn't going to change his mind. He didn't know Narcissa too well to trust her with Teddy, who was Harry's everything.
Harry laughed. He sat Teddy on his lap and smiled as Teddy's brown hair turned black. This little bundle of happiness was all that was left of Remus and Harry would give his life to protect him. The bell rang. Harry gave Teddy to Ginny and got up.
Harry waved off. "Come on, I'm sure the others are awake already," He said and got up but Malfoy didn't move. "What's wrong?"
Harry's mind was racing. How long has he been passed out? What day was it? What had happened all the time he was unconscious?
"Now, what do you want?", Malfoy asked, trying to get his voice back to haughty.
mean?", he asked and the healer looked up at him.
"Pansy, tell me why you pushed me to go there." he said in a stern tone Harry knew just too well from their time back at Hogwarts.
Tongues entwining, bodies moving against each other, Harry cried out as they came together, Draco groaning deeply against his mouth.
He rolled his eyes and tried to make them clear that he didn't want to talk to them, but they stopped him anyways.
"Hope you're right. We have to be really quiet.", said Draco and lay down next to Potter.
Harry rolled his eyes. "I'll take him upstairs and as soon as he's asleep I'll bring Teddy back downstairs."
