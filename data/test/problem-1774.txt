As much as Harry could worry about what this would mean for their friendship, it didn’t mean that it had to end. After all, soulmates are best friends first.
Draco held up a hand to stop him from speaking. "I've cleared my desk. I'll take my leave as effective immediately." He swept out of the room, smoothing down his hair.
“Next?” Malfoy tilted his head slightly. They remained unmoved. This was the closest Harry had been to him in nearly a week, and he found he almost missed the proximity. This was also the first time, in maybe ever, that the two had been so close without shouting. No wonder Harry’s heart was racing. He must’ve been anxious for the fighting to begin.
Draco blinked at her slowly, trying to register what she had just asked through the fog of anxiety in his mind. “He deserves it, no doubt about it. I should be there too, but Harry spoke for me.” His words faded quieter and quieter.
"I feel that I no longer suit this role," and I'd cut my testicles off with a butter knife before I spend my last months working for you.
Draco passed his mug over and gestured towards the balcony, where streams of dying light were pouring in. "The sun is setting, we should go watch it."
The blond spun on the spot, narrowing his eyes at the man before him. “Watch your mouth, jolie garçon. Nice, is that what you call insulting someone?” Merlin, there was nothing quite like the feeling of antagonising Harry James Potter.
Harry tried his best to smother the grin teasing at his mouth. “Did you call her Sylvia because the patch over her eye looks silver?”
"Yeah, no, really." He smiled to himself as he sliced the bacon. "I spent the afternoon working with Draco and Luna at the shop."
This couldn’t be happening, not really. This must be another dream, Harry thought. But as Malfoy stared into his eyes, his breaths shallow, asking permission, Harry found that he didn’t care. If this was a dream, he didn’t want it to end.
Potter did as he was told, pulling his fingers out as Draco stood up. He took the lube and spread it over his cock, his heart hammering as he realised what was about to happen. He was about to fuck Harry Potter.
Draco appeared home with a crack. He rushed to his room, pulling his suitcase down from on top of his wardrobe and throwing clothes into it. He went to the bathroom and grabbed his toothbrush and toiletries, as well as his anxiety pills. He zipped up the case and dragged it to the living room.
Draco retreated and straightened up, grabbing his case and walking into the fireplace. When the flames settled down, he found himself in Harry's living room. It was cozy, with a sofa and matching armchairs - one of which seemed to be solely for the purpose of holding a huge stack of blankets. There was a fluffy rug under his feet and the coffee table sported numerous copies of the Quidditch Times. The walls were covered in photos of Harry and his friends and the whole room had a gold and blue theme.
"Latte with an extra shot, please." Draco smiled politely at the barista as he offered her a muggle note with a 50 on it. She looked at him quizically and took it.
Draco had watched the boy on the train, chatting to a girl with frizzy hair and a boy with bright red hair.
“Just wear a button up shirt and jeans, always works for me.” Ron shrugged, looking at Hermione for approval.
Draco's vision began to swirl at an alarming pace, and his breath was knocked from him. When he found it again, it came in short, rapid bursts. His therapist said this was hyperventilating, and that he should try and take longer, slower breaths. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. He did his best to do so, and swallowed thickly.
“Ah-hah! You just admitted that your room is on this floor. You better lock your drawers, Monsieur Potter.” Draco sipped at his drink, his nerves settling as he allowed himself to relax a little into the banter. He took in the sight of Harry James Potter, his thigh just a few inches away, his dark skin glowing, his green eyes bright, his lips slightly chapped. He was gorgeous. Without thinking, Draco reached over to tuck a stray strand behind his ear. Maybe his emotions were heightened, but he just had to touch that jet black hair that he couldn’t stop dreaming about. Dreaming about touching the soft curls, pulling on them, the way Potter’s pretty little face would gasp. But he didn’t need to know that.
Just then, a person popped up from behind the counter, wearing a medical mask and glasses, and Harry jumped twenty feet in the air. “Bloody hell!” He shrieked, clutching at his chest. Maybe he was more relaxed these days after all.
"I must say, your call was most unexpected." She said, one of her blonde curls falling into her face. Her hair was just a little more unkempt than Harry remembered, her magenta robes just a little bit more faded, her under eyes just a little bit darker. He knew many people were refusing interviews with her after the war, and he had even heard that Xenophilius had banned her from the Quibbler after an especially volatile argument between the two of them. It all seemed to be taking its toll.
“Potter. What do you want?” Draco drawled, picking up Sylvia. Merlin knows he needed her reassuring cuddles when dealing with the absolute headache that was Harry Potter.
He followed silently for a few steps before finally finding his voice. “What are we doing here? I thought we were celebrating The Quibbler.”
“Please let me finish, Weasley. I imagine your fiance here was already concocting one of her own.” Pansy eyed the engagement ring on Granger’s finger. What a shame, she had always been keen on the witch.
"Merlin, Malfoy. You really can't help a healthy dose of drama, can you?" Potter said, shutting the door behind them. The small room was lined with shelves of boxes, and more boxes and stacks of paper were scattered across the floor. A single yellow light flickered above them.
“Just.. Sit back down, okay? We haven’t even finished our drinks.” Harry tugged at his hand. Draco obliged, sitting back down across from Harry. The two men sippied in silence for a minute. “So, this is a date?”
His feet carried him down to the dungeons, to where he knew Slytherin common room was. He had no way of getting in, and no chance of anyone letting him in. What would he say anyway? ‘Please let me in so I can punch Malfoy in his stupid face’? Not likely.
“And why is that?” Draco sat back against the cushions, easing his shoulders as he took another sip.
“Shut up. Potter’s not gay. And he’s definitely not gay for moi.” Draco scowled at Sylvia as she purred in Pansy’s lap. Bloody two-faced cat.
And so when Potter decided to talk about anything more meaningful than the weather, he did what he did best; protect himself. He put up his walls, threw scathing comments and disgusted looks. Because, Merlin knows, nothing frightened him more than Harry Fucking Potter.
"Mr Malfoy's ample inheritance no doubt-" Draco started, his glasses perched on his nose as he read the newspaper. Harry grabbed him by the hand, and the blond gaped at him as he dragged him through the Auror department, and opened a door which read "filing room". Had it been anyone else except the saviour of the wizarding world, the two most certainly would have been stopped.
Potter cleared his throat, suddenly very interested in looking at everything but Draco. “Yeah, she said something about a new, um, a new potion? For nightmares?” He looked back at the blond, holding Draco’s gaze for only a second before looking away again. The Slytherin was taken aback by the sudden vulnerability he saw there.
Harry pulled the packet out of his pocket. “I’ll give you some if you tell me where we’re going tomorrow.”
“You said you didn’t care who I spoke to!” Harry exclaimed, though he knew he was right. At that moment he didn’t care, the adrenaline of the argument heating him up. He had tried so hard to get the interview right, and in his naivety he had expected it to work. Why couldn’t Malfoy see that he’d tried? His breaths came out in huffs, the other man’s face looking far too punch-able right now. He grabbed Malfoy by the front of his shirt, both men leaning over the counter towards each other until their faces were only inches apart. Malfoy’s pale skin held a slight blush, his pink lips wet with spit, and Harry’s green eyes blazed so fiercely they looked otherworldly. He'd only been in the shop less than two minutes and he already wanted to shove Malfoy against a wall.
The healer stared pointedly at the desk before him, pushing his glasses up his nose and clearing his throat.  "There is no delicate way to put this Mr Malfoy," He looked up to meet Draco's eyes. "We have detected a kind of rare disease in your blood. There is no current cure for such a disease, nor has modern research found a cause. It just, simply, is."
Harry growled, turning away. Why did Malfoy always have to take the piss? He stormed off down the hallway, determined to find his friends.
“You cry very quietly, you know. I would’ve expected you to be a howler.” Draco said as he poured them both tea.
Draco watched as Potter held up his hands in surrender. He had spent the past several months working hard to make this shop something to be proud of, a place people would feel welcome in. That had been made especially difficult by his family name, but with each happy customer, Draco slowly rebuilt his reputation. Now, Potter stood in the centre of it, not unwelcome, just.. a surprise. His unruly black curls were threatened to spill into his eyes, and he held a scarf in his hand. Bright green eyes lit up against his deep skin tone, and chapped lips pulled into a nervous frown. He looked good enough to eat, good enough to ravage, and yet here he was after so many months, questioning Draco’s cat naming skills. Oh, how he had missed the absolute twattery that followed the golden boy everywhere he went.
Harry sat at the bottom of the creaky stairs, closing his eyes as he tried to calm his heart. “Kreacher. Can you bring me a cup of tea, please?”
“I’m not. You don’t need to be so defensive.” Why were Gryffindor’s so quick to jump to conclusions?
The man, who had been making his way over, stopped in his tracks as Harry turned to him. “You never said you had a boyfriend.”
Harry didn’t know why he felt so angry, but he did. Watching them converse, the timid yet friendly nature of their chatter, the way Malfoy seemed to be helping Neville with his notes, all of it just rubbed him the wrong way.
Draco’s head had been swimming with ideas since he had left Harry’s three days ago. The potion was relatively easy and wouldn’t take more than a week to make and perfect. If all went well, the combination of peacock feathers, valerian root, snowdrops, wiggentree bark, armadillo bile, and crocodile heart would serve well to help calm Alfie’s magical condition.
Harry Potter nodding to Draco whenever they passed each other in the hallways of the Ministry. These days, those small acknowledgements rarely happened. Draco supposed they were both just too busy.
The two boys whipped their heads round at the sound of the Headmistress’ voice and watched as she appeared through the portrait-hole. A flash of pale skin and white hair peaked out from behind her and Draco was up in an instant, scrambling to his feet and straightening his clothes.
She would end the Malfoy line once and for all, and soon the world would have one less evil in it. Her parent's faces flashed before her eyes, and she took a steadying breath.
Draco laughed, letting his son tickle him before scooping him up. "I surrender!" He kissed his forehead.
"Fuck, Harry!" he shouted, his cum shooting out. Apparently that was all the permission Potter needed, as his own cum spurted between their chests.
The moment the Slytherin set foot outside the classroom, Harry had him by the front of his shirt and was dragging him into a nearby alcove. He shoved him against the wall. “What the fuck, Malfoy?”
“Exactly. I’ve only been on it a few days, but it’s already working. And apparently, after thirty days, they’ll disappear completely.”
He headed to the changing rooms, wanting to shed his cloak before taking to the skies. As he entered, the sound of running water greeted him and he stopped. Who was in here at this hour? He caught sight of a pair of pale slender hands as they hung up a towel. Malfoy?
Draco looked at Harry in horror, grasping his chest as he coughed, and Harry was barely out of his chair in time to catch him as he fell out of his chair.
"Another bottle of the '96 Elf Merlot; you can charge it to my vault." Draco slid across a piece of parchment with his vault details on it. After finishing his first bottle of the ridiculously overpriced drink, he had decided that he deserved another. His pale cheeks held a slight pink tint, and his ears were tipped with red, though he supposed it would take another glass for the slurring to become noticeable, and another glass after that before his hiccups would start.
He sat on the floor of the common room, his back resting against the edge of the sofa. There was a navy blue blanket draped over his crossed legs, and piles of notes around him; the organised chaos of NEWT studying. Harry came over and leant down to ruffle Draco’s hair. The silver-haired boy looked up at him with a pout and pushed his gold-rimmed reading glasses up his nose.
When he had begun rearing snakes, it was hard not to become attached to most of them, but even harder with this particular corn snake. Snake-Draco was clingy and a little bit rude, not hesitating to talk back to him whilst also asking for food or wrapping himself around Harry’s nearest appendage. That’s what he was doing now, as Harry signed off the sale of six of his snakes to the new pet emporium. Snake-Draco wound himself around Harry’s arm, his head dangling off of his hand.
“You’re both wrong.” Luna said simply, and both of them looked over to her as she stood to the side, stroking the purring cat in her arms.
Harry turned and locked eyes with Nagini, not ten feet away. The snake squinted at him, almost mockingly, rising to its full height.
Draco shook his head, shaking his hips suggestively. "I am not! These eyes," he pointed to his face, "and this body," he trailed his hand down his chest, "have seen things every wizard and witch can only dream of." He nodded proudly to himself.
Draco didn't know where his legs were taking him, but he knew it was far away from where he was. He took off at a sprint, down the steps, and out the doors.
Draco couldn’t help it; he let out a chuckle. “Since when am I your preferred match for conversation?”
Narcissa searched his face for a moment, before nodding silently. She walked away, collecting a fresh glass of champagne. “If I may have everyone’s attention.” She called loudly. The crowd quieted. “I would like to express how proud I am of my son.” She turned towards them. “My dearest Draco, through your hard work and dedication, you have built yourself a thriving business. You should be proud of what you have earned.” She raised her glass.
"Well, I’m definitely enjoying the view." Harry gave him a cheeky smile and Draco blushed, looking out at the streets, the Eiffel Tower in the background.
Draco woke to a screeching in his ear, followed by the feeling of claws on his cheek. He sat up quickly, seeing Lady land in his lap with a disgruntled look. "Sorry." He petted her gently and watched as she flew off towards his bedroom window where another owl sat pecking at the glass. He threw off the covers and walked over, opening it to retrieve the letter. He gave the two owls some treats and tore it open.
Draco smoothed back the curls away from his forehead, running his own fingers over Harry's scar. He smiled sadly.
“Why? No offence, but you weren’t the best at magical creatures..” Draco interrupted, unable to help himself to a snide comment, despite the hypocrisy in his statement. It really was bad how much he enjoyed seeing Potter riled up.
“Thank you. Most people don’t. He says that that’s okay, but I know he is still annoyed about it.”  Luna replies.
Harry takes it and frowns down at it. "Um, what reds would you recommend?" He turns to Draco. "It is red that you like, right?"
Pansy’s gaze drifted to the window, as a light haze of rain drifted down over the spring sun. “Oh, look. You were right, Lovegood.”
"Yes, thank you for owling ahead," the woman placed the small pouch on the counter. "That will be two Galleons."
"No, I used to spend a lot of time as a child looking at pictures of it though, the little villages, the Parisian streets. I always wanted to visit the Eiffel tower." Draco watched as Harry's face took on a distant, almost pained look - but before he could say anything he shook his head and smiled at Draco.
McGonagall smiled at the two boys in front of her as Narcissa Malfoy peered around the eighth year common room. Her eyes lingered on where Harry sat on the floor, surrounded by papers and still holding a bar of chocolate, and a muscle in her jaw twitched. She turned back to look at Draco and smiled at him, kissing him on the cheek.
Ginny paused, thinking over Harry’s words. “Are we talking about arguing with anyone specific?” Harry nodded and Ginny grimaced, as if uncomfortable with her next words. “I mean, I might be wrong, but…” She leaned in closer, “...are you sure you’re not mistaking passion for anger?”
“How the fuck did you get ma petite fille?” Malfoy exclaimed. Harry looked over to see Draco staring wide-eyed at the cat on his chest.
As he left the portrait, Draco saw Harry turning the corner up ahead. The eighth year common room was located on the third floor, above the DADA classroom and library. There weren’t many students in this part of the castle, usually only eighth years or the occasional Ravenclaw wanting to speak to the ghost of Helena Ravenclaw.
“Turn all the lights on, please.” Harry asked, dreading the undeterrable shadows of the house. It seemed as though when he was home alone, they never completely disappeared; no matter what he tried. The least that could be done was to turn the lights on. “And put the kettle on to boil.” He added sheepishly, feeling bad at asking Kreacher for such a menial task, but all he wanted was to be out as quickly as possible.
Draco passed it over, looking far too perfect in Harry’s bed. He appeared almost ethereal, the sunlight streaming in through the window illuminating his ruffled white locks, his silver eyes locked on Harry’s throat as he drank. Suddenly, all thoughts of a cold shower went out the window, and all Potter wanted to do was pull him in for a kiss, taste those sweet lips of his.
Draco stepped back to let Harry go, who made no attempt to straighten himself out and Draco couldn't bring himself to tell him. He kind of liked the idea of Potter showing up to work looking like this, knowing he had done it. "Don't die, Potter."
“No, it doesn’t. But we both know what good you can do, and if bigots keep believing in the past rather than the present, then let them. I’ll still be here.”
Draco let out a breath he didn't realise he'd been holding. Thank Merlin for Harry being impulsive. Harry closed the distance and cupped Draco's cheeks, giving him a sweet kiss. "Let me go pack."
Draco strode in a moment later, two steaming mugs in hand. Harry made a shushing motion, pointing to the pile of blankets on the arm chair. Draco put the mugs on the coffee table and moved them out of the way as Harry lifted Teddy over to the seat, tucking him in. He cast a quick muffliato.
“Thank you.” He gave her a quick kiss on the cheek, preparing to apparate back to his apartment. “Bye-Bye, Tedster!”
As he spoke, the other ministry employees, many of them senior aurors, turned to watch the pair with interest.
“Oh, I understand.” Draco sat forward abruptly. “Just forget I said anything.” He smiled weakly and stood up.
“I offered you a truce, Potter. You’re the one who refused.” He said, walking backwards with his arms out. “I’m trying to change, it’s your choice to remain stuck.”
Harry nodded, taking a swig of his drink. “Yeah, it’s kinda crazy actually. She told me to try this potion from the new shop on Diagon Alley. And you’ll never guess who owns it-”
He locked the door behind him, and leaned heavily on the sink. He felt weaker by the hour, and it was harder than he thought to hide it from Potter. He poured a glass of water and downed it, his hands shaking. He would have to tell him, he knew he would. Later, he thought, taking another two pills. He was really only supposed to take one at a time but he didn't really care.
Harry, on the other hand, felt queasy, the beer sitting in his stomach lurching at the man’s advances. The man was persistent, and had been for the past 20 minutes. He couldn’t see a way out, the oblivious bartender serving other customers and chatting away happily.  Harry could’ve taken him in a duel, sure, but not a fight if it came to it. It wasn’t as if he was going to use magic on an unarmed muggle.
“I never said you weren’t a cock, you bloody tosspot." The darker man sighed. "But that doesn’t mean you’re immune from mistakes, or from forgiveness.” Harry’s voice softened as he said this.
“What did you do to his hair?!” Draco asked, eyes wide in alarm. Why on earth would she modify his hair - or worse - use muggle dye?!
“I would, I really would.” Harry reached forwards to grab the blond’s hand, suddenly full of Gryffindor bravery. “You can ask me on another one once we’re done.”
“You never elaborated the other day, about what you meant when you spoke about not being perfect. You were very angry about it.” Draco explained, crossing his ankles. His knuckles were a tight white.
Harry's eyebrows drew together as he thought it over, more confused now than he had been before. Why did he always feel out of the loop?
Draco tugged him along, leading them away from the crowds and into the streets. They walked for a few minutes before Draco lead him into a small restaurant, giving his name to the waitress. She smiled and nodded, leading them upstairs and onto a relatively private balcony.
He watched Alfie fly off, the owl landing on his perch as gazing out across the aviary, making sure everything was how he liked it. He was king of the enclosure, but still a big softie. Harry had made a good choice with this job. It was the most successful therapy he’d had, and Hedwig’s death was probably the one he had come to terms the most with; mostly because of the dozens of hours spent with the other owls.
“Do you know what I think, Potter?” He whispered, inching closer until his breath danced across Harry’s lips. “I think-” he paused, leaning into Harry’s ear. “- that you liked what you saw in the showers.”
“Hmm. Very well then.” She turned to Harry. “I don’t care who he is, no one comes in the back of my shop.”
The slytherin crouched instinctively, cursing at himself for being so jumpy. Fate was a cruel bastard. It was like it could read his mind.
Harry looked over his shoulder, catching sight of Malfoy’s retreating back. Could Hermione be right? She usually was, but a truce? The two had been each other’s necks since Malfoy was rude to Ron on that first day all those years ago. To think otherwise was beyond weird.
Draco dashed over to the mirror, taking himself in. His hair was knotted and sticking on end, his trousers wrinkled, his shirt untucked and half buttoned, and he probably smelled as bad as he felt. “Shit, right, okay." He bit at his lips nervously, his head racing. “I’m going to go back to mine and shower and change.” He turned to face her. “Can you send a message through firecall asking McGonagall if I can meet her at the end of breakfast? Say something about a tour of the new quidditch pitch.”
Without thinking, he crept forwards, not considering the Slytherin’s state of undress. He turned the corner, taking in the sight of Malfoys ghostly skin with a gasp. Draco spun around, clutching his shirt to his bare torso. "Who's there?"
By the time Flitwick dismissed them ten minutes later, Harry felt like he might explode. He rushed to grab his things, waiting outside the classroom and waving off Hermione and Ron. He would talk to them later. He knew that Malfoy was almost always last to leave, and he watched as Parkinson and Zabini strolled ahead in conversation. Perfect.
Two weeks. Nine days. Five days left. An estimate. His head was throbbing and his lungs ached, and he finally stopped, collapsing against a wall. He wanted to cry, he wanted to scream, he wanted to… Fuck knows what.
Draco pushed his hair out of his eyes, a bit bashful. "Yeah, I mean, it's just a very rare ailment."
"And I have the mark of the guy who did that," he traced his fingers over Potter's scar again, "to you."
Draco rushed on, not wanting to lose sight of the moody Gryffindor.  He caught Harry by the arm and he whipped around, unshed tears in his eyes. He pushed the Slytherin away, but Draco refused to let go, instead using the energy from the shove to pull the two together.
What was going on? Neville had really come into himself last year, and was now much more confident. But going up to Draco Malfoy? If the hatred didn’t get there first, surely the fear of the snarky comments would. And then Malfoy had smiled at him. Had both of their heads been infiltrated by wrackspurts?
Hermione, Luna comes to an entirely different (and perhaps more accurate) conclusion simply by being willing to ignore past facts, and consider previously
He shakes himself, and steps forward. Blaise’s hand tightens around Draco’s arm, but Draco shrugs him off, ready to intervene if Weasley so much as lays another hand on Harry.
zoo with the clumsiest Auror known to Wizarding History? Why don’t you just ask the Weasley twins and be done with it?’
Draco mutters something under his breath. ‘Yes, Weasley,’ he says, rolling his eyes in exasperation. ‘McGonagall just stood there while we spied on everyone’s marks.
Draco isn’t paying attention. He hasn’t been paying attention since they got to Hogwarts two days earlier and, really, it’s not as if he doesn’t have plenty of good reasons (what with his father is in Azkaban, and his psychotic Aunt is living at his house), except this time it’s during their assignment in potions and Blaise is suddenly struck by the fact that Draco has put the wrong ingredient in their potion.

She leaves him and heads for the main office. Poppy is waiting for her inside, leaning against the large, paper and potion strewn desk. Her arms are crossed, her hair pulled out from it’s usual neat bun to fall in tangles around her shoulders and the purple marks of sleepless nights form shadows under her eyes.
Blaise rolls his eyes and snorts. ‘Yeah, sure you are.’ He shakes his head, leaning over to his bedside table to snatch a book up.
’Since many of you seem incapable of interacting with members of another house without altercations occurring we have decided to bring in a new class rule. From now on, no two students from the same house may sit together in any class.’
have a crush on bloody Malfoy,’ he says. ‘He’s not even that nice! It was just…a moment of insanity!’
‘It was great Hagrid,’ says Potter, smiling. ‘Do you mind if we have a look around a bit? I want to get a closer look at that Ashwinder. She was funny.’
Potter’s shoulders droop, but he doesn’t back away. He stares up at Pod with those big green eyes and says in a low voice, ‘You’re amazing, you know that Pod?’
‘Yeah, well, I found a way to make it less hopeless. Look, can’t you just shut up and enjoy the fact that you got what you wanted?’
Still, she supposes it can only be a good thing that Draco has more allies now. Given the current situation.
‘Alright. I’ll stop talking about him like that, when he stops giving Harry a hard time.’ Ron is saying, but Harry can’t concentrate on the words. They echo in his head.
Realisation hits Neville like a stampeding hippogriff. ‘Of course we’re still friends,’ he says, dumbfounded that Harry could think otherwise. ‘Why wouldn’t we be?’
for what he wants and Draco being the aloof, reluctant one. Now, he struggles to find a response to this sharp eyed creature that’s replaced the normally compliant Gryffindor.
He glances at her, stepping around the human girl to come closer to the tank. ‘I’m sorry,’ he says in a soft voice. ‘I was…busy.’
He sticks out a hand. Harry takes it and is hauled to his feet with barely any effort. Turns out that standing hurts even worse than lying down had, and Harry doubles over, wheezing. Malfoy steadies him.
He sounds distracted, though, and Draco assumes that he’s reading (probably hasn’t even been to sleep yet, knowing him). Rolling his eyes, Draco ignores them and slips out of the dorm.
He thinks he rather likes being underestimated. People think he’s dumb and slow, and maybe he’s not as sharp as his year mates—he certainly can’t read between the lines like Blaise or Theo can, and he’s not any good at double talk like Draco and Pansy are—but he is good at being
‘Look, I don’t know where he is,’ he says in a low voice, oddly compliant all of a sudden. ‘You’ll have to ask someone else.’
For a moment, her eyes shift colour and she looks disturbingly like Lily. The look rattles him, and he looks away quickly, staring into his butterbeer as a dozen old memories try to surface all at once.
The faintest of smirks twitches at Draco’s lips. ‘Relax, Potter,’ he says, digging through the pockets of his coat. ‘It’s just for a moment.’
Without hesitating, Potter picks it off the rack and darts off to the change room. Malfoy shakes his head. Then he turns his head, leaning up on his tip toes to scan the store. Seeming to find what he’s after, he casts a quick look back at the change rooms before setting off toward the centre of the store.
Malfoy, the stupid sodding git, glances back between them but seems to know better than to say anything. Ron almost wishes he does. He’d give anything to have an excuse to hex the bastard. He hates him. He fucking
He does the only thing he can think to do under the circumstances. Right as Malfoy is opening his mouth to speak—no doubt to rightfully ask what the
‘I’ll deal with him,’ Malfoy says over his shoulder, hauling Harry by the back of his robes and pulling the door shut behind him. He turns his head and mutters, ‘Don’t you dare throw up on me, Potter.’
He shakes his head and the expression is gone, replaced by a sneer of superiority. ‘You needn’t worry about me, Lovegood,’ he says quietly, pulling his hand away. ‘I’m fine.’
‘Can I have Hedwig? Just…for a night?’ he glances toward her, his shoulders drawn inwards, still chewing on his lips.
She purses her lips. Reigning in her temper—which wants to berate him and dock points—she takes a deep breath and says (as calmly as she can manage), ‘yes.
They head to the transfiguration classrooms and, like everyone else, pause in the hallway. No one seems to want to be the first one in—especially not any of the Slytherins. For students that like to be in control, the idea of being the first in and having no control over who sits next to you isn’t something any of the Slytherin’s relish—even Blaise.
Potter straightens, smirk slipping back into place. ‘Great. Just checking,’ he says and shoots Blaise another wink. ‘Guess I’ll just go with the toaster then.’
She turns, and Draco expects her to clack away back to her office, but instead she only takes three steps, stopping at the next bed over.
Draco tilts his head. ‘How about we just make this easy and pretend the other night never happened.’ After all, that’s what he’d
‘I’m almost done,’ he says to her, and though the words are not in her tongue, she understands. ‘Try to be patient.
She pauses, and asks, ‘Can you tell me what happened? Why were you in there? Why did you cast Feindfye?’
An outright grin spreads across Blaise’s face. Until he catches sight of the expression on Draco’s face, and then he ducks his head in attempt to hide it.
‘Alright, gather around,’ calls Professor Sprout, finally emerging from the Greenhouse covered in dirt and bits of petals and leaves. ‘I’m afraid we’ll be cancelling class this morning—’ she waits a moment for the cheers to die down, ‘—yes, yes, very exciting. I’ll expect a six inch essay on the proper way to pot carnivorous plants in place of today’s lesson.’
Weasley, of course, entirely misses the amused disbelief on Blaise’s face and turns on him. ‘What’ve you been doing to Hermione?’
Malfoy doesn’t pull away. Doesn’t shove Harry back. Doesn’t try to punch him. His fingers dig in at Harry’s waist and his response is every bit as fiery.
Potter tilts his head, and the gesture is so idiotically innocent that it instantly eases the tension in the room. Theo feels his shoulders relaxing. Immediately, irritation shoots up his spine. What does he care if Potter is relaxed or not? In fact, what does he care about any of them?
late, and watches him work. He moves the thin pale stick in his hand and she feels a wave of magic settle in the air. It’s familiar and warm, and she settles into the corner of her tank and watches him weave magic into the new home he is building her.
He drops his gaze to his half drunken butterbeer, now cold, and contemplates going. Yet, sitting here with her is too irresistible to pass up. Even with her angry at him, there’s a pleasant sort of comfort in her company.
The blond glances over his shoulder at the door again, and it’s so quiet in the room Myrtle can here the familiar comforting gurgle of the broken toilet in the second last stall.
and oh well, everyone else can just fucking deal with it, right? Like taking all the food on the trolley cart, like there’s no one else on the damn train who wants to fucking eat. Like getting onto the quidditch team a year early because whoopy-do you’re Harry fucking Potter. Like running off to the department of mysteries instead of
‘No, but I’m his mother, this is something that I know,’ she says, and she turns back to him again. ‘Draco’s priorities have shifted, Severus. He’s
Potter looks up at him, a large grin stretching across his face. He glances back at Lisa and Earnie.
There’s something in Draco’s expression that Blaise can’t quite identify, and he contemplates saying something outrageous just to see if he’s paying attention.
Smoke billows in the high domed ceiling, thick and roiling and casting shadows over everything where the fire hasn’t yet touched. Flames surge through the room. Eating up a couch here, crackling through a bookcase there.
He runs a hand through his dishevelled hair. ‘Okay,’ he says and looks purposefully at the cauldron he’s supposed to be cleaning. ‘I’m alright. Really. You should go.’
Neville’s been in the exotic greenhouses once before, but to have it under his care? To take his time to go through the plants and get to know them and watch them flourish? Jitters shiver up his spine and he doesn’t even bother trying to conceal his goofy smile. He bounces passed the Great Hall where dinner is just wrapping up—leaving him with several hours before curfew to really explore his new assignment.
, or if I suspect you’ve had help, or if your reasonings for the book you’ve chosen are not adequate; then you will participate, willingly and without complaint, in every class for the rest of the year. Along with completing your equal share in a joint project with Potter.’
He chuckles darkly, though it’s not the same as usual. She pauses mid hunt. Now that she’s noticed it, there is definitely something wrong about his smell this morning.
Colin shakes his head. ‘Oh, no. No you don’t look like an idiot.’ He laughs and says, ‘Actually, I got kind of nervous when I saw it. I thought Malfoy might get angry. I can’t believe he paid me for it.’
He sighs and stomps away, irritated at everything. Rumours, Harry, the rain. He stops, turning back to look out the window with a frown.
‘No seriously, first he tried to kill Malfoy, and then he went after the other sixth years. He was a
With a snap of her fingers, Thistle manoeuvres the piles before each of them and steps forward. ‘Is you be’s ready for gift giving now?’
With a little shake, Luna breaks herself out of her thoughts and steps to one side, smile widening as Harry passes right by her without even seeing her.
Without missing a beat, Malfoy leans over and says in a mildly amused tone that the whole room can hear, ‘You realise you basically just called McGonagall your mother?’
Blaise raises an eyebrow. Across from him, Greg pauses in his mission to demolish a bag of marshmallows and frowns at his long-time friend. Vince, on the other hand, doesn’t even look up from the latest edition of
‘I already offered,’ says Potter. ‘If I recall he told me to fu—er, “bugger” off and not speak until I’d learnt how to articulate myself like an intelligent human being.’
more appropriate among your titles. At the very least you should have enough money to buy something.’
‘No! I don’t! Merlin, Potter don’t you get it? If any of my housemates find out, I’m screwed. They’ll tell their parents, and their parents will tell mine, and then…I know you think everything will work out,’ says Malfoy, shaking his head and looking away, ‘but that’s not how the world works. You’re the good guy, and I’m…not. There’s no good outcome for us.’
He says this in a smug tone, clearly thinking he’s brushed aside her concerns and Minerva makes a mental note to remind Poppy to run any of Potter’s foolish plans by her
‘You…okay, even if you weren’t a complete git. You’re a death eater. You’re everything I hate. If Harry wants to fool around with you...fine, that’s his business.
Luna nods. She taps the front of the book Harry is holding. ‘There’s an interesting chapter in here on Erumpents. Their horns are used in a lot of potions, see? But to get their ingredients they must be lured out during mating season. They’ve been hunted so extensively that many have become distrustful of even their own kind, so that even when they find a potential mate, they dance around each other, trying to decide whether or not they can be trusted. It’s quite fascinating.’
He angles away from the corridor paintings, shifting sideways in this 2D painted world to tumble past several portrait entrances. He sees the frame he needs and reaches out, pulling himself up and sliding over the edge of the frame into the background of the painting.
Mr Nott shoots him a dark glare, and Mr Zabini shrugs in reply, tilting his head just so in what Albus suspects is meant to be encouragement but only has Mr Nott's guilty glare deepening.
Blaise snorts. ‘I’ve seen you naked,’ he says dryly, flicking his gaze over Vince. ‘You’re not that big.’
There’s a faint glow to the night air, as if a flock of fairies have come streaming through the corridors lacing the air with hopes and dreams and babies laughter. There’s no hint of wrackspurts, and Luna wonders if her charms are starting to work, or if something else has chased them off. Something like the glowing beauty of a storming night.
Draco sighs heavily. ‘Yes. I bought them for you. I was sick of looking at those hideous frames you insist on wearing.’
Shock radiates through him, making him still, and Eric seems to mistake this for encouragement. He slides one hand through Harry’s hair.
Ginny settles back into her bed, looking up at the ceiling above. She closes her eyes, just for a moment, and her mind fills with images of swirling smoke. She gasps, opening her eyes, a feeling of dread washing through her that is strangely familiar. Like an old friend that has become distant and cold, the feeling sets a chill through her, bringing with it memories of darkness and damp and danger slithering just on the edge of her subconscious. She shivers.
Carefully, as if he’s worried the whole thing might disappear, he unties the clumsily tied bow, edges a finger beneath the edge poorly wrapped paper and pries it loose. Paper crinkles away to the floor to reveal a brightly coloured box, illustrated with various depictions of stick figure people on the front.
Loose stones scuffle down the street ahead of two figures as they walk down the crowded, cobblestoned street. Severus glances sideways at Draco, observing all the familiar signs of teenage surliness, and feeling just as ill-equipped to deal with it as he always has.
Harry shakes his head and trails after him, burying his hands within the pockets of Draco’s large, woolly coat. He turns his face into the collar, inhaling that coffee and cinnamon scent that he’s come to associate with the Slytherin over the last year.
Harry blinks. ‘Uh, I don’t really know any other seventh year spells. Sorry,’ he says, and makes to pull his arm away, but Eric tightens his hold.
She and Ron follow behind, and while Ron frowns at Draco’s back, his hands shoved deep into his pockets as if he’d rather be anywhere else, Luna ambles along beside him with a soft smile.
‘This is because I told you to stop acting like my mother, isn’t it?’ he says, dropping his gaze to pick sulkily at the sheets.
Draco reaches out and grabs the front of Harry’s robes, pulling him back in. ‘I’ll call you whatever I like,’ says Draco, his lips brushing against Harry’s. ‘You’re mine.’
‘Oh please,’ says Ron, flushing red in his indignation. ‘Malfoy deserves everything he gets. The guy is an absolute prick! It’d be just like him to start something and then get Harry in trouble for it! I wouldn’t be surprised if the whole thing was some nasty plan to make Harry get stuck with him so he can do something even worse.’
Harry chews on the inside of his mouth. He’s trying to think of a polite way to say no when he spots Hermione watching them from across the room. She is currently helping some second years with their spellwork, and she gives Harry a soft smile of encouragement. He sighs.
Molly doesn’t turn when Harry sits down, dragging a chair out from the table and dropping into it with an audible thud; instead, she switches from chopping vegetables by hand to levitating them above the cutting board, slicing them with a flick of her wand and directing the spices and oils to mix through the vegetables in a swirling mid-air dance.
Ginny tries valiantly not to laugh, truly, but she can’t help it. Giggles erupt and Harry shoves her.
A storm brews outside, emulating Draco’s worsening mood and sending a hush over the stone castle, turning every conversation into muted whispers that seem to trail around after him.
In which Tonks investigates, Narcissa realises something and the author posts without editing (sorry about that).
When Colin and Dennis were young, before they’d started at Hogwarts, their parents had taken them on safari. The trip was a huge part of why Colin got into photography. The animals they saw were so majestic and magnificent and…dare he say it? Magical.
Potter picks at the sleeve of his shirt. ‘I…I don’t really understand what she wants me to do. The leaf, this meditation crap, how the hell is it going to help me?’
Narcissa shifts her weight, pretending to adjust her placement of opened gifts as she attempts to read the message.
A shadow falls over them and they both look up into the beaming face of an exuberant Hagrid. ‘Alrigh’, all done then?’ he asks. ‘Good. There’s a demonstration in the reptile tent, an’ if we hurry we can get there before it starts.’
Ginny’s grin widens. ‘Oh, he doesn’t,’ she says, then adds, ‘never mind, it’s a joke. How much for twelve?’
‘You know,’ says Mr Nott in a softer, crueller voice, ‘maybe if you want to throw blame around you should take a look in the mirror. Maybe if
She pushes up off Dean’s lap. ‘Again?’ she asks, just to be sure, and tries to squash the delight surging up her spine as she realises what’s happened.
Hermione nods. ‘Thank you,’ she says, and moves to sit in the chair between Harry and Ron’s beds. ‘I can’t believe they ate dosed chocolates. Honestly, how many times have I told you two to be careful…’
‘I didn’t think you’d ever pull your head out of arse long enough to be more than a vain, preening peacock,’ snaps Draco, stopping next to him and scanning the crowd ‘But here we are. Guess we’re both being surprised today.’
‘Oh, er, yeah,’ he says, his tone sheepish, and half cringes at Harry. ‘I, uh, I didn’t mean to— I mean I know I was...look I’m sorry, okay? I didn’t know how big a deal this was in the muggle world.’ To emphasise this rather ineloquent statement, Ron gestures vaguely in Harry’s direction.
Harry’s emotions war across his face. Indignation, hope, annoyance, pleasure. ‘It’d hardly call a bit of flour a “disastrous mess”,’ he grumbles.
Harry got those scars. They’re recently healed—though badly—and Ron remembers the stiff way Harry moved at the end of the holidays.
nonsense last year. And yet, all her efforts to keep her nose down and her studies up come to an abrupt screeching halt all because of Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter.
. Is it so wrong for me to want to know a little more about your life outside of home? You’ve hardly spoken to me at all about school. Or, am I too old, now to be included? Is your mother no longer privy to the details of your life?’
‘Yes,’ says Draco, and chuckles a little. ‘That was…I mean, a bit touch and go at the beginning there but, bloody hell. You can do that anytime you want.’
Malfoy gives him a once over, the corners of his lips lifting into a smirk as he takes in the shirt in all it’s glory. ‘Yep, that’s you alright.’
Bella squeals with delight over some gift or other, but Draco never looks away from Narcissa as she peels away the wrapping paper and lifts the lid of the box beneath.
He takes another deep breath, unclenches his hands from the sheets and straightens his back. ‘Tell me.’
Tension pulls his shoulders taut and his expression closes off. He glares at her, fury turning him quiet and calculating.
Malfoy sighs and rolls his eyes. ‘Merlin, I’m not heartless, Potter. Of course I’m worried about you. You seem to find trouble around every corner. Just look what happened this morning with Blue.’
Molly tucks the vegetables into the oven and sets a timer. She turns to the table, but Harry, hunched over his sandwiches and sipping his coffee, doesn’t quite look ready for conversation, so she steps toward the cupboard.
He’s glowering at her now, the darkness in his eyes reminding her that this Draco is not the same as the one she grew up with. This Draco is different. Changed.
‘Nope,’ says Malfoy, and Ron can hear the smirk in his voice. It sets his blood on fire. ‘I have a plan.’
Draco raises one eyebrow, glaring and Potter—turning a rather amusing shade of bright pink, hastily ducks down to pick them up and place them back on the bench. He shifts his weight from foot to foot, eyes flashing over to Draco and away again, cheeks so red Draco’s surprised they don’t melt right off him.
The low light of the bathroom flickers, catching over a trailing scar on Potter’s back as he bends to grab his shirt, and Draco blinks. Flashes of memory try to swarm at the edges of Draco’s mind. Memory and nightmares mixed together.
Theo contemplates casting another Imperius, but with so few of them in the room, and with all their attention on the girl, there’s no way he’d get away with it. Better to trust that Potter will protect Draco from whatever he thinks is happening.
Winnie turns to look at him again, impatience in her eyes and Draco grins. ‘Alright, alright,’ he says, and hauls himself up into her saddle.
‘It’s a bit small,’ he says. ‘Good thing there are only two of us.’ he climbs up over the rail, nimbly dropping down onto the ice on the other side.
Malfoy grabs at his arm, trying to pull him back, but Potter just throws him a sly smile and takes another half step.
He looks around the room, at the flames spreading about the carpet and cushions and furniture. The room is on fire and he’s trapped in there with it.
Dean shakes his head. He feels momentarily bad for Harry and whatever hell he’s just unleashed on him, but then he remembers that the alternative was two gossips spreading rumours about
The words are thick and different from the way the Boy talks, but somehow Blue manages to understand. After all, she’s been practicing. She’s been listening, trying to learn as much as she can. After all, He said it would help her to get smarter and she wants to be smart. Smarter than others of her kind, who have been hunted to near extinction.
There’s a moment of surprised silence in which Hermione is sure the two of them are exchanging secret, communicative Slytherin expressions. She rolls her eyes again but waits patiently, leading the way to Ancient Runes.
Blaise shrugs. ‘Who knows,’ he says, affecting an air of uninteresting that is about as convincing as a Blast Ended Screwt wearing a hat.
me. I sit next to Nott. If they didn't want to be touching, they wouldn't be. Every time they pass a sheet of parchment, or a quill, or a textbook…they don't just sit together because they have to, they
Draco can see it. The overly sharp twists, the sudden turns. There’s skilful flying and then there’s just being a moron…honestly, after spending the last several days in the Hospital Wing, Potter should know better.
He yanks out his wand. Theo flinches, but Draco isn’t pointing it at any of them. He flicks his wand at his curtains and they swish shut around his bed, the obvious quiet of a silencing charm going up following on it’s heals.
She takes a moment. Normally she would refuse outright. An owl in the Hospital Wing does not encourage a sterile environment. However…
Lavender shrugs. ‘I’ve spent the last few weeks getting ready for Valentines Day. People order flowers from me, bouquets and chocolates and cards with poems and sonnets. Plenty of the matches would surprise you.’
this mystery girl?’ he asks, his voice taking on a sarcastic edge, frustration at having given up his last day of freedom for this absurd notion of Draco’s “new love”. ‘Because as far as I’m aware he doesn’t
Luna’s can feel her heartbeat. It’s not something she’s used to feeling, or something she ever really takes notice of, but she does now. It thumps along at a steady pace, a baseline to the unfolding tragedy. And it is a tragedy. She can feel it in her hands, along her skin, in the taste of the air and the feel of the castle and there, in Ron’s expression and Draco’s helplessness.
‘Oh, that’s right,’ says Dennis, turning to Colin. ‘You were shooting the quidditch teams today, how’d it go?’
Draco is quiet a moment. He doesn’t want to say anything that’ll make it worse but this is a situation he’s not prepared for. Handjobs and blowjobs, sure, he’s thought about
After a moment, a livid orange head pokes out of the green foliage. Then a second, and then a third.
Ron shuffles his weight. He glances around the room, looking for Madam Pomfrey, but the woman is no where to be seen. Ron swallows. Well, at least there’ll be no one to overhear.
There’s a tense silence while Pomfrey turns her attention back to Potter, leaving Severus to deal with Draco. He bristles, annoyed that his question is once again being annoyed.
He slides the drawer open. Inside are half a dozen rows of the tiny, palm sized books, each one stained with a house colour—just like the other cabinets.
‘You, arguing with the Headmaster,’ he says, frowning as he glances around the room and sees no sign of the man. ‘But before that, I was playing quidditch. Is it…what day is it?’
Only to run headlong into someone two floors up. He staggers backwards, his head spinning, and wonders if it’s at all possible for him
Something dark flashes across those green eyes as she starts the process of identifying all the usual suspects. Poppy frowns. Whilst wariness was a typical reaction of Potter in his early years, he hasn’t looked at her quite like that in quite some time. IThe reaction begs quite a few questions.
Harry groans and Draco almost drowns in the sound. He presses closer, but Harry shifts suddenly, rolling them sideways so that he’s the one in control. Draco doesn’t care. Not when Harry’s leaning back down spread fire along his skin.
Potter looks away but nods. Malfoy merely grunts. Poppy gestures to Minerva but before she follows Poppy out, Minerva shuts her book and glances between the two boys.
Hermione rolls her eyes, but gets back to her potion. A moment later someone pokes her in the back, and Hermione turns to see Ron leaning forward behind her.
Harry and Malfoy both jump, turning around to find Professor Snape standing in the doorway to his offices, his gaze swivelling around the room—the broken tables and chairs, the shattered glass tanks, the overturned pixie cage, the boggart wardrobe in pieces, to name just a few—and there, at the centre of it all, is Harry and Malfoy.
She tilts her head. ‘No,’ she says, and shrugs. She offers him a sultry smile, her best, and turns away. Heels echoing through the hall she heads away from him. ‘I really, really don’t.’
She hands him several eggs and says, in as light a voice as she can manage, ‘I’m glad you’ve found someone you enjoy spending time with,’ as she kneads the biscuit mixture with her knuckles.
It takes Tonks a moment to find Potter and Malfoy among all the people crammed into the small audience area, forgetting for a moment that the boys are in disguise. She spies them off to the side of Hagrid and finds a place only two seats behind them.
‘Merry Christmas, Mum,’ he says softly, and hands her the second large box from his pile. ‘I hope you like it.’
He turns back to face the room, planting his feet and raising his wand. Ginny feels a small sense of relief to have him there.
Ginny, who has been running her had through his hair all this time, gives him a sad smile. ‘Go to sleep, Harry,’ she says. ‘You’re safe here. We’ll watch you until Draco comes back.’
Blaise smirks and dips his head in acknowledgement. ‘True,’ he says, but he’s still watching Potter.
Ginny tilts her head and considers the question. Dean himself is over in the corner with Seamus, both of them whispering over some heinous prank no doubt. She smirks and shrugs.
Harry sucked in a deep breath and unclenched his fists from his robes, flexing his fingers. His hand brushed passed Malfoy’s with the motion and he glanced sideways. Funny how the last time they were in this room they’d been trying to kill each other. Now…Harry found comfort in the presence of the other boy at his shoulder.
He tries to school his expression into something neutral and calm, and yet, he feels his lips twitch. Clearly, five months without practicing his interrogation skills has left his poker face a little rusty.
She shrugs again, keeping her gaze pointedly away from him. ‘Hmm, just that perhaps Dumbledore might’ve mentioned something to you. He’s always so fond of you Gryffindor’s after all.’
Luna can’t hear what the girl asks, but she sees the way Harry sinks down in his chair somewhat, his eyes downcast as he tries to avoid her gaze.
As to confirm this, Harry shifts, turning his head and muttering. Though most the words blur together, one stands out. ‘Draco.’
Draco tilts his head back down the street. ‘This way,’ he says, and turns away from Harry, not bothering to look back as he stalks down the street.
Harry is lounging on the couches by the fire. He chews on the end of his quill, trying to think of a witty reply to a note Draco left in his potions book, but seeing as wit is not his strong suit, he’s not having much luck.
‘Well then,’ says Mad-Eye. ‘If you’re quite finished, we shouldn’t linger any longer. Don’t want to draw any unwanted attention.’
His wand is no longer twirling. He flicks it out, his arm moving through a familiar pattern that’s too quick for Harry to identify, and even if he’d been able to it would’ve been too late. Because Harry’s stuck again. He’s staring down the wrong end of a wand that’s hexed him more times than he can count and he can’t even
Hermione purses her lips. ‘Harry…’ she sighs. ‘What about the Zoo tomorrow? You know that was conditional on you and Malfoy getting along.’
The smell of coffee and eggnog washes over him and Harry opens his eyes to find Draco standing directly opposite him on the other side of the rail.
Potter snorts again. ‘No kidding,’ he says, but he seems more contemplative. ‘I just don’t want hurt someone, really hurt them, just because they got stuck making the wrong choices. Or had their parents make bad choices for them.’
He’s gotten an extra broom from somewhere, and he draws to a stop above them and holds out the spare broom.
A frown flashes across Draco’s face, and Greg detects a hint of disappointment in the downward twitch of his lips. ‘Hm. Guess you’re just a seeker then.’
‘But now he’s kissed you,’ she says, summarising. ‘And you’re understandably confused. Did he say anything?’
The smell is back. Citrus and coconut, and Harry’s gaze shifts automatically to the crumbs within the empty bakery box on his desk, his mouth suddenly watering. Harry shakes his head, squashing unhealthy obsessions with the scent of his co-worker (lest his thoughts begin to leak over onto his face), he refocuses his attention on Draco.
Harry shifts, and something catches at Ron’s attention. He frowns, leaning out from his spot just beyond the doorway, staring at the unfamiliar markings on Harry’s back in confusion. His brain takes a moment too long to recognise what they are. They criss-cross their way across his back in varying shades of pink and red, some thick and some needle thin, leaving Harry’s back a disorganised mess of…of…scars.
Careful of the reaching branches and exploding pot-plants, Neville shuffles further into the gloom of the building. He wants to call out to Harry, to let them know he’s there, but at the same time the atmosphere of the greenhouse keeps him quiet. A soft reverence that fills him, and he reaches out to touch a leaf, whispering a soft greeting as he does so, unable to muster the courage to break the hush over the building.
Across the room are Goyle and Malfoy. Goyle is munching on the remnants of their dinner, brought up by a house elf while Pomfrey was examining them all.
‘Glad I have your approval,’ says Harry, and the flippant, caustic way he says the words makes Hermione realise exactly
Harry picks up the leftover photos and flicks through them, his eyebrows raising. ‘Whoa, we look…good,’ he sounds as surprised and baffled as Colin feels.
Potter is on his feet, brushing himself off as he looks back and forth between Draco and Brown. Draco shifts away from him, and it’s then that Theo realises he has one hand firmly in his pocket. He moves his body slightly away from Potter, keeping the hand in his pocket clear of any chance of being brushed up against.
‘Why does that not surprise me,’ says Malfoy dryly and when no one else says anything he sighs and continues. ‘Much as I’d
‘Yes,’ says Minerva, cutting him off. ‘I’ve been meaning to talk to you about that. I was wondering, have you contacted Petunia and Vernon about Harry’s extracurricular classes?’
Poppy keeps one ear turned to the main room as she rummages about for the potions she needs. The conversation, for the most part, is quiet until Potter’s voice echoes out, tired and exasperated.
Somethings shifts in Draco’s expression, his eyes widening ever so slightly as he realises the meaning behind Severus’ words. ‘Mother was right,’ he murmurs.
Her lips twitch and she straightens. ‘Well, at least your sarcasm didn’t suffer any injury,’ she says, and crosses her arms. ‘The pain should ease somewhat now with the potion. Stay in bed until I say otherwise, but let me know if you feel any lingering pain. Oh, and it’s still Thursday,’ she adds with a smile that doesn’t quite reach her eyes. ‘You were only out a few hours.’
He frowns and shakes his head. ‘This is madness,’ he says. ‘Draco would never be swayed against you. He’s a Malfoy.’
Anxiety winds through Hermione as she heads toward the door. She can hear Malfoy’s footsteps right behind her, and it might be her imagination, but she thinks that perhaps they aren’t as surefooted as usual. As if he, too, is concerned about whatever is going on with Harry; and that on it’s own makes Hermione feel so much worse.
Hermione raises an eyebrow. ‘I didn’t realise you and Luna were friendly,’ she says, turning to look at Malfoy.
Shock radiates up through his spine and he stiffens, unable to help the stunned expression working onto his face.
Theo, predictably, has gone back to his essay. Likewise, Vince is pouring over his magazine again. Blaise is lying on his back, staring up at the ceiling with a frown, and Draco…
He leans back against the wall, crossing his arms but looking far more relaxed in Malfoy’s presence than he had in Romilda’s. Two months doesn’t seem enough time to have them so at ease with each other, forced co-operation or not, and yet the smile that passes between them is downright
Draco frowns. He looks back toward Smith, who is watching Potter leave with a smug expression that Draco wants to slam into a wall. Except then Harry is passing him.
Draco looks down at the mottled mismatch of scars, his fingers digging into the mark. ‘Not if I was healed,’ says Draco, his voice dry and brittle.
‘Draco,’ says Zabini, stepping closer to the boy. ‘This fire is bad. Did you try putting any of it out?’
a grin, and he focuses back on his potion long enough to make the correct step. Blaise mimics him, tossing the ingredients in with slightly more force than is required.
Harry sighs, shifting uncomfortably. He runs a hand through his hair and shuffles around so that he’s leaning back against the tree. ‘I don’t do that,’ he says in a low voice.
He blinks up at the ceiling, his glasses pushed up on the top of his head. ‘Hi,’ he says, and doesn’t even look at them.
As the wounds begin to close, Poppy refocuses her attention, taking one of the vials she’s summoned out of the air and pouring it down the still-unconscious Malfoy’s throat.
Neville straightens and reaches out to take the paper. Professor Sprout’s familiar cursive curls across the parchment.
Thrown, Draco’s words come out biting and cold. ‘Sorry to interrupt your attempt at suicide, Potter,’ he says. ‘but we’ve got the pitch booked for practice.’
‘Everyone wants something,’ says Malfoy. ‘What’s your price? I’m sure I can have whatever plant your green little heart desires shipped here within a week. Name it and I’ll get it.’
Vince chuckles again. ‘You’d be surprised,’ he says. ‘Daphne probably is too, if you gave her a chance. You just gotta let her take the lead. They like it that way. Makes them feel in control.’ He pauses, and adds, ‘but you can’t be surprised about it, or she’ll think you’re judging her. It’s like…you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t push it in, you know?’
She’s almost passable as attractive like this. If she made more of an effort, she might even manage to keep a guy around. Though—Pansy looks down at the secret notebook—she doubts that boys are a priority of Daphne’s.
For a moment Hermione swears he says the last two words. It’s in his voice, in the upward infection of an unfinished sentence, in the concern that flashes across his face and underlines his tone. It’s in his eyes and the way he shifts forwards slightly, fixated on Ron’s response.
Tonks chews on the inside of her mouth. She lifts her shoulder in a half shrug and she says apologetically, ‘Albus has a point about this one. It’s a…delicate situation.’
‘And you call yourself his best friend?’ Malfoy scoffs. ‘You’re really going to cut him loose over this? Whatever happened to that Gryffindor loyalty that you won’t even put aside your grudge for someone you claim is family.’
‘Alright…’ she says. ‘Well, I don’t think Harry would agree to be friends. Not, as you say, after everything. I…I think maybe…they’re helping each other.’
‘How can I know anything when you won’t talk to me anymore,’ she says, and deliberately looks away from him toward the garden. ‘Alright, what shall we talk about then? How about the snow roses? They’re blooming beautifully this year.’
Left over adrenaline surges through his muscles and Draco flops back in the bed, feeling restless, but listening to his dorm mates.
The fact that Remus was spending Christmas at the Burrow was merely a coincidence. Really. After all, Potter was here too. As a member of the Order it was part of her duty to check in on him (not to mention that bet she had with Kingsley over the outcome of the Zoo excursion).
Lavender steps back from the banner she’s working on, considering it with a smile of satisfaction. ‘Oh yes, it’s
All three members of his staff look at him with narrowed mistrust and Albus cannot help how three very different temperaments align together when called for. Amusement tickles at him, but he keeps his expression in check.
‘I…er…this seemed like a uh, a private…thing,’ Neville falters and swallows hard, wishing very much that he’d chosen to write to his Gran instead of investigate the greenhouse.
‘Not sure,’ says Blaise. ‘Probably off terrorising some poor firstie. Say, did you finish the homework?’
Harry can only marvel at him. How is it that even in the freezing cold in the middle of the night, Draco Malfoy can look so…so…well, so like a Malfoy?
Malfoy grins and steps closer. He pulls Harry’s glasses out of his pocket, and slides them onto Harry’s face in a gesture that even Ron knows is far too intimate for supposed rivals.
‘Ginny,’ he says, grabbing her shoulders and shaking her. ‘For fucks sake listen to me! You need to go and get help. Malfoy and I can manage on our own. But you need to get out. Go and get a teacher, McGonagall if you can, but anyone will do, just get them here.’
‘Don’t worry about it,’ Harry repeats, his voice quiet, a whisper, as if it’s painful just to say the words.
a challenge) but sometimes an offer of comfort. A message of solidarity. A phrase that told Harry that while some things inevitably changed, others never would. There would always be this. This thing that existed between them.
but I don’t care. You’re the one constantly telling me to stand up for what I want and what I want is you. I can’t explain it. I can’t justify it. I just want you
Her fingers itch to reach out to him, to press a hand to his forehead and rub his back until he’s calm. Yet she knows that the very reason for her urge is the same reason that he will not allow it. He has been raised to dislike the touch of others, to shy away from comfort that his classmates would so readily long for.
Harry responds, curling his pinky around Draco’s. His breathing is slow and steady and deliberate, and Draco knows that this is working.
that. Trust me, I've tried. They are so stubborn, another quality they share. Anyway, he likes to tease Harry about not knowing as much'
‘So…I hear Lavender’s chocolate roses are really quite something,’ she winks at Lavender. ‘Maybe we should order a few…or a dozen? Grand gestures and all that. You haven’t sold out yet have you?’
Following a hunch, Hermione turns to Ron and puts on her most patronising tone. ‘Oh, so of course it’s all Malfoy’s fault, is it?’
He realises that Malfoy is feeling self-conscious. He’s never seen Malfoy look self-conscious before. Somehow that makes him feel a little better, and the tightening in his chest eases somewhat.
Beyond where he works, the Large One lumbers around the clearing. His footsteps cause the earth to tremble, sending faint vibrations up through the tank walls. He hums as he works. The low, rumbling hum of a creature content.
She decides to give him an escape route. ‘So,’ she says, turning back to the house. ‘Get a good haul the other day? I heard even the Minister visited. Didn’t realise he was doing personal deliveries this year.’
‘There’s more than one way to win the game,’ Draco says, repeating what Vince said earlier. ‘If you score enough points.’
Malfoy frowns and looks away. Toward the door. He shifts his weight and glances toward Harry. He shrugs and scratches at the inside of his arm, where Harry remembers four long claw marks gouged into the flesh.
‘Notice me not,’ says Draco, coming around the end of his row to stand with her. He huffs out a soft laugh. ‘Of course you notice the unnoticeable.’
Suddenly, she understands. She understand’s Ron’s anger, and Harry’s misery, and Malfoy’s worry. She understands why Ginny wanted to buy 12 dozen roses for Harry to make some grand gesture to someone he’s “not” seeing and why the idea of doing so would embarrass him so much.
Gryffindor Tower is unusually quiet for a friday night. Romilda sits in an armchair in the corner of the room the other fifth years had claimed, and studies her potions book, her fingers trailing over the glossary list as she searches for just the right potion to suit her next project. That is, until the sound of her name being raucously called pulls her from her task.
Potter mutters something in response that Dean can’t hear, and, despite himself, he leans into the door, straining his ears to listen.
‘Surely you cannot mean for Potter to take the fall for this?’ asks Minerva, aghast at such a proposal.
Neville stands there in the corridor, completely baffled, and not entirely sure that the minute he starts walking again he isn’t going to be hexed.
‘I doubt you’ll have to be patient much longer,’ says a familiar, airy voice. ‘After all it’s almost Christmas.’
Before Minerva can reply the cauldron in the corner spits and fizzles. Poppy curses. She hurries over, throwing a few odds and ends into the potion until it calms down. She casts a stasis spell over the cauldron and turns back to Minerva.
‘Actually she said it’d be good for me,’ he says and she half thinks he’s going to poke his tongue out at her.
Kingsley nods, dipping his head. ‘And, do you think there is any way one of them could be swayed to our side, swayed into
Madam Pomfrey bustles back into the room, looking up from the papers she’s rifling through and coming to a stop.
Vince had said that Millie needed to feel in control, so, how could Draco help Harry feel more in control of his own body?
All the usual groups have been broken up and in the brief confusion that falls over the room (except, of course, for Potter and Draco who are sitting in their assigned seats watching everyone else scramble) people seem to grab a seat at random. Blaise aims for a blonde Ravenclaw he recalls as being somewhat tolerable and somehow ends up next to Longbottom.
So far there’s been no need for her presence. She knows (from Mcgonagall’s letter) that the boys are being passed off as brothers from Hufflepuff, and with their disguises they certainly look the part, but Tonks finds herself increasingly amused by the way they’re interacting.
? That’s all you’re going to do? Are you fucking kidding me? He almost killed Draco and you’re just going to give him a slap on the wrist and let him go?’
Luna straightens, turning those large, blue eyes on Luna. They’re unusually focused today, and pin on Hermione, making her shiver.
Hermione can see the situation dissolving. She realises, too late, that making Ron cone out to apologise was the wrong move. It’s too soon. Harry is still too upset.
‘Yeah,’ says Potter, still confused. ‘That’s where all that chosen one nonsense came from. You, you really didn’t know?’
The snitch flickers up passed her face, darting across the sky and she spins, almost giving chase but catching herself just in time. She glances up, sees Harry and Malfoy’s heads swivel in her direction at the same time, and in a flash they’re both flattened over their brooms making chase.
Now, though, they sink into their respective beds and look at the floor—rather like five year olds too nervous to say or do anything. Blood drips from Potter’s nose and, with an impatient huff, Poppy contours a napkin for him.
She glances around the room and sighs. Apparently her own organised chaos has begun. She shakes her head and sweeps her wand around the room, sending everything back to it’s rightful place.
'Steady on,' he says, a hand on Harry's back. 'Now, I know you Gryffindorks aren't the most intelligent lot, but I would've thought even
‘There was no guarantee that I’d catch you in time. What if I missed? What if it wasn’t powerful enough? All I know, is that you were headed for the ground head first, and I was the only one who could stop it. So I did.’
Malfoy, watching him with that increasingly unreadable expression, flushes pink. ‘You’re welcome,’ he says and looks away, over at Hagrid. ‘Merlin does that man ever stop talking?’
‘Gin,’ he says, and he’s looking out over the lake that now encompasses the entire pitch. ‘What the hell happened out there? What happened to the pitch?’
Draco comes to a stop, turning around and levelling Ron with a flat look. ‘Are you a wizard or not?’ he says, rolling his eyes. He pulls out his wand and casts a soft warming spell over Luna. ‘Better?’
Carefully, he wraps the necklace back up and, with a quick flick of his wrist, sends all of the items on the floor careening back into their rightful place within the trunk.
’Merlin you’re dense,’ Malfoy snaps, straightening up off the wall. ‘If they find out about us, they’ll kill you just to punish me. I can’t…I don’t want you to die.’
‘No,’ says Poppy in a quiet voice. ‘When I first started to suspect, I was sure I was simply overreacting. Seeing something that wasn’t there.’
Harry blinks. He turns his head toward Draco, tearing his gaze away from the large square of ice carved out of the park’s centre, fringed with fir trees and low-hanging fairy lights. ‘Uh, well, sure,’ he says, glancing back toward the gleaming ice. ‘I just didn’t realise there was one here.’
‘Because they’re busy running a shop,’ Minerva retorts sharply. ‘Nymphadora is more capable than you give her credit for. She has the perfect disposition to deal with any tension between them; not to mention the fact that she and Malfoy are cousins. Yes, I think Nymphadora will do nicely. What do you think?’
‘Oh, I thought we’d just use the room the DA—er, the club I ran—used,’ he shrugs. ‘Thought it’d be easiest.’
The girl becomes a prowling tigeress, lowering herself down on her haunches, a predator on the hunt. Harry leans back in his chair, which turns into vines where he sits, wrapping around him and tying him in place. He casts around, eyes frantic, but there’s nothing to free him. The tiger gets ready to pounce. The ground beneath Harry starts to shake, starts to open up, ready to swallow him whole.
Poppy raises an eyebrow. She glances over at Minerva, unable to quell her curiosity on the other woman’s reaction. Minerva, as always, is unflappable. She’s hiding her interest by pretending to flick through a book she’s produced from somewhere—though Poppy sees a small twitch in the corner of her mouth. Amusement, perhaps?
‘Here you are,’ says the Professor, holding the vial out to Harry. ‘Take that up to Madam Pomfrey and have her check you both over. I’m sure there’ll be no harm done, but can’t be too sure now, can we.’
Hey guys, sorry about the wait, I was struggling to decide which order the next three chapters go in. Also, I redid the last couple of paragraphs on chapter 45 a few days after I originally posted it. If you've read it in the last few days you should be fine, but if you read it when I first posted you might want to have a quick looksie. As always, I hope you enjoy.
He tries to keep the dream at the forefront of his mind, hoping to slip back into it once the offending pebbles are dealt with. It doesn’t occur to him to wonder
‘Well I’m sure you’ll get the chance,’ says Professor Burbage with a bright smile. ‘Well, as you can see, class, Muggles can make some pretty extraordinary things.’
Harry laughs again. ‘We’re still getting no where. I feel like I’m getting whiplash with all this back and forth.’
Anyway, I finally managed to carve out some time to get this chapter done. It's not quite what I had planned, but I hope you enjoy it anyway. Again, I am SUPER sorry at how long it's been (almost...checks calendar...oh god six months). I'm the worst :(
He wakes gasping, his chest tight. Something is wrapped around him, pinning him down to the bed. His breath shortens, ragged and hoarse, blood pounding in his ears. Oh god. Ohgod, ohgod, ohgod. He can’t move. He can’t move and he’s going to die. Flashes of screams and muted explosions echo in his mind and he’s going to die, he just knows he’s going to…
Slowly, his breathing comes under control and the trembling in his hands eases. He takes a deep breathe in. ‘I am stronger than my trials,’ he whispers on the exhale and opens his eyes. He blinks several times and refocuses on Poppy. ‘Again,’ he says.
He stalks off, his shoulders taut and Luna once again sees that starved, aloof wolf overshadowing him. She sighs.
He finds Draco exactly where he expects to, in the potions rooms. Zabini is in there, and Severus stifles the urge to hex the boy. There’s
Harry grins. ‘Right. Sorry.’ He breathes in Draco’s scent and tries not to let it cloud his thoughts. ‘How’s your break going?’
A rock, the third one in as many minutes, clanks sharply against the window. Ordinarily, Harry might be concerned about something trying to break through his window, but he’s cosy and warm, and the pleasant dream of warm caresses and curious mouths beckons him back into sleep.
He realises, a moment too late, that he’s said the wrong thing. Her expression closes off and her hair, which had been a bright, bubblegum pink, darkens into a deep red.
Potter laughs, abrupt and loud, startled at whatever joke Malfoy has made. He glances sideways, flushes pink and turns to look back out at the enclosure.
Oh, she was good. No wonder she was a Malfoy. He glowered at her, knowing she had him. Knowing she knew she had him. Severus didn’t have a choice. For Draco to admit, even to his mother, that he had feelings not only for a boy, but a
He hesitates, makes a split second decision to trust that Draco was smart enough to get the hell out of there, and darts down the street in the direction of the echoing blasts.
He slips into the stuffy, too-dark atmosphere of the little apothecary with a small sense of relief. It’s cool in the twilight of the store and there is perhaps one or two other people lurking in the shadowy corners of the aisles.
Harry and Malfoy are thrown backwards. Harry slams into a desk, or a chair, or maybe even a bookcase, but whatever it is it’s solid and
The crowds disburse—rather quickly after that display—but the boys linger. They’re still sitting on the little benches, and Tonks notes that they’re slightly closer together than necessary, their shoulders pressed together.
He’d see the angry flush to her skin, hear the fury in her voice, the outrage and indignity that might have alerted him to the fact that his accusations might be false.
The room beyond is small and unassuming, made smaller still by the five rows of dusty, off-white filing cabinets. There’s hardly any space around them, and Draco, Ron and Luna are forced to walk single file into the room, just barely squeezing through the gaps between the cabinets. The room smells dank and musty, with the faint smell of paper just beyond the unpleasant odor of dust and disuse. Luna’s foot bumps into something hard, knocking a small, rickety wooden step stool into the nearest filing cabinet with an oddly muffled clang. The noise reverberates through the room a soft hum that vibrates through the innate magic soaking the room.
She draws level with him and keeps her voice low. ‘Actually, it’s about the attack…and how Harry went missing.’
Potter, still gazing at the creature that is at least double his size, carefully raises one hand, palm flat and raised upwards. Archie shifts, taking a step forward, but Potter stops before touching the dragon and Pod is still sitting in that half crouched position, watching the scrawny boy before him with obvious curiosity—intelligence burning behind those bright eyes.
‘Do you plan on lurking out there all night?’ Draco asks, ducking under the hot shower and relishing in the warmth (even if his enjoyment is somewhat marred by the fact that Potter is standing less than ten feet away). ‘Stop standing around like an idiot and pick a shower. It’s not like this is the only one.’
‘I thought you were “walking” with Higgins?’ asks Draco, remembering something about some seventh year Pansy had been hanging after recently.
He wonders if Harry is still practicing, but he can’t see him out in the pitch itself. Ron shoves his hands into his pockets and kicks at the grass. Practice. He scoffs. Harry just wanted to keep flying. He doesn’t
Harry makes a face, looking up at Malfoy and shaking his head. ‘Don’t be rude,’ he says, prodding Malfoy in the side.
Ron, who had been staring at Luna and Draco’s clasped hands with a perplexed frown, shakes himself, looking up with wide brown eyes. ‘Er, yeah. Like I said, I figure Pomfrey keeps pretty detailed notes, right? I thought, if we could look at his file, maybe we could see something she’s missed? I mean, the curse is rare, right? So maybe she doesn’t know everything…maybe…maybe we can find a way to help him. We have to, right? There has to be
Murmurs rise amongst the room as everyone else moves to collect their bags and head to lunch. Numb and still reeling from his inability to even defend himself, Harry follows Ron and Hermione out into the hallway. His head is swimming, and he feels a bit dizzy.
Malfoy shrugs. ‘So long as both devices function in a similar fashion, I suppose so. Rune-work is more of an art rather than a set of rules.’
Poppy leans her elbow on the desk. ‘I’m not sure what you mean,’ she says slyly. ‘I simply want a little peace and quiet in here. Do you know how many arguments I’ve had to listen to the last few days?’
Ron pushes down the corridor of the Hogwarts Express, eager to find Harry’s compartment now that the prefects meeting is over. Not that he’d paid much attention. Hermione sighs and resists the urge to scold him. Honestly, he could at least
Blue backtracks, slipping out of his sleeve and curling around his arm again, keeping her head and upper body raised so that she can better inspect his face. His face which is red, his eyes wide and hurt as he stares at her in bewilderment.
want that for my son. If you value his life, please, you will do this for me. Take him to Dumbledore.’
Muggles trudge on by the line, barely paying attention to the oddly dressed groups. Some are in muggle gear, other’s steadfastly refuse to remove their outer robes.
He blinks, and then laughs—though the sound is anything but mirthful. ‘I shouldn’t be surprised,’ he says, and runs a hand through his normally slicked back hair. ‘You haven’t heard, then?’
in detention. The frustration he’d been feeling earlier is easing off now that his mind is focused on another problem, and Draco puzzles over it as he scrubs, trying to figure out a way to help Harry without making him feel worse.
The package, so carefully wrapped, so thoughtfully preserved, spills from Brown’s hands and tumbles to the floor.
But he’s already gone. Blue, feeling her own sadness creep along her scales, rubs her chin against her tail and curls up tighter.
‘What I want,’ she says, her gaze steady on him, her voice even, ‘is for you to convince Draco, when the time is right, to go to Dumbledore.’
If Colin weren’t so terrified of the boy, he’d ask to photograph him. He’d make an excellent subject.
He heaves a long sigh, and doesn’t even bother to try and encourage the students to get closer. His mind is on his next class. His two reluctant sixth years.
That is, until the sound of soft bells alerts him to someone walking down the corridor outside. Scowling, Draco flicks off the taps, thankful that he’d at least had the presence of mind to lay a warning charm outside the door, and waits for whatever teacher it is to pass on by.
The question is, what will he do if someone else (someone like the Dark Lord) wants what he has more? What’s more, what will it do to Slytherin if Granger ends up
‘You’re brother is staring,’ Dean mutters, pulling away from her lips just long enough to get the words out.
‘I imagine,’ she says into his hair, ‘Draco is the sort of person who would not express his feelings unless he was very sure of himself.’ She gives him a soft squeeze, before releasing him. ‘And of you.’
Malfoy shrugs. ‘I don’t know,’ he says, and he sounds frustrated, glaring down at the rag he’s twisted around and around.
Potter takes a step forward, reaching out to slip a hand around Malfoy’s wrist. ‘I don’t want to give up,’ he says.
Did you know that Spencer spent three years observing the courting process of erumpents and Rhinos? He believes that the friendships cultivated through accidental courtship saved their species from extinction on multiple occasions.’
‘Back in a minute,’ Potter calls over his shoulder, over the top of Malfoy’s protesting. ‘Just gonna have a look at some souvenir’s.’
A few grumbles echo out, but for the moment there’s not much resistance. One student even calls out, ‘how long?’
Behind them, Ron snaps, ‘could pick any slower, Malfoy?’ Far more viciously than Lavender thinks is required. ‘None of them are made of gold, you know.’
, is it really winning?’ she gives his shoulder another nudge. ‘Besides, you’ve done alright with stunners and disarming spells so far. Why change things now?’
As she heads on out to the pitch she spies a figure standing out in the snow and grins, glad that Ginny is already waiting for her.
Harry looked up so fast his neck cracked. Malfoy leaned against the wall outside, watching him with shrouded eyes. He looked as immaculate and arrogant as ever, except…except there was something in that gaze. In the way it stayed pinned on Harry, never once straying toward the inside of the room where his friend had died.
Potter glances up, confusion in his face, but Tonks has just seen the keeper step back into the room from the staff entrance. The Occamy is no longer wrapped around his shoulders and he pauses as he sees there are still people in the exhibit.
Then, right as my pupper was coming good again and I got back into writing, I lost a grandparent. It happened very quickly and with the COVID situation in my country, I wasn't allowed to visit before he went and I wasn't able to attend the funeral.
Poppy’s eyes widen. Before he has a chance to continue, she is flying across the room, flicking her wand at the nearest bed to send blankets and bandages and potions whizzing around the room in a flurry of action. She doesn't ask how bad the injury is. She doesn't need to. Albus would not come for anything less than near-death.
Draco shrugs one shoulder. Without looking at Harry, he holds out a pastry. Harry takes it without thinking. It’s sticky and crumbly and Harry’s mouth waters just looking at it.
Her teeth clench, and Poppy has to keep from sighing yet again. ‘As I said, Potter,’ she says briskly. ‘Give it more than a few days. Now, I believe you have a dorm to return to?’
Theo can’t move. Can’t breathe. His heart hammers in his chest as he stares in horror as everything he’s worked fall crashes to the floor.
Hermione nods, stepping away from the table, but glaring at Malfoy for good measure. He stares back, impassive and immovable.
‘Right,’ says Vince, nodding. ‘That’s why it’s gotta be about her. You gotta make her feel good. Confident. Powerful. Give her the quaffle, so to speak.’
Draco’s head whips around to stare at her, grey eyes wide and open, flashing with shock and perhaps, a little bit of fear. It’s only because she’s caught him off guard that she sees it. Really, the best way to throw off any Slytherin—Draco in particular—was to ask the question you actually wanted an answer to. They were so used to manipulating each other that being upfront was usually enough to rattle them.
She turns on her heel and heads back down the stairs, leaving Draco spluttering behind her. Pleasure ripples through her, and she thinks she might just have to take Pete up on his offer of a second round.
think they’re friends?’ asks Daphne, turning her head to look at Blaise, staring at him with those serious blue eyes.
Zabini passes her as she kicks for the surface, and a pinprick of relief assuages her guilt. Gasping at the air, she sees another hand reaching out.
She sighs and steps out of the room, wishing that conflict resolution was better handled by the teachers. And especially wishing that other people’s conflict didn’t bother
Draco opened the door "Potter!" He never called him "Harry" since the library "My test! My DADA's test!"
Yes, it was true, they had behaved civilly, but after just a week already he could not stand it anymore. He couldn’t stay in his room with his friends: the last time they tried, Draco had made such chaos that they were forced to leave the chamber ("rules, Potter").
Draco moved to his neck, hugging him (Harry was sure he would have bruises the next day). God, it felt so good... But, inside him, Harry knew that was a kind of 'goodbye', he simply didn't want to care about that. He was hard, as Draco was, so they went to the bed...
The next morning, they all went to the Great Hall for breakfast angry, for one reason or another. Walking through the halls the students splitted to let them pass, as if they were a bunch of superheroes, driven by a particularly angry Neville.
"Come here, who is Daddy's love? No no, don't lick the photo" He whispered to a one-year-old Lily, who was licking the photo of Harry and Draco’s marriage.
"There's another thing." He really didn't know how to do this... "I think I figure out why me and Ginny didn't work. I think... No, I know, that maybe I don't work with girls"
They went in the kitchen and saw that it was set for nine people, one more than those present. With a smile, disfigured by the melancholy, thay looked at the plate and the field flowers next to him, probably Ginny's work. They sat and, as always, were filled by Mrs Weasley's food
"Well, I think I will be an aouror. During the war I saw many horrible things... I don’t want history to repeat itself. What about you?"
"You’re gonna hold it against me forever, isn't- Wait what?" Harry didn't notice what he actually said to him "Really?"
Some weeks passed and Harry realized how much Draco counts for him. Everything he did, he wanted to do with him, everything that happened, he wanted to tell him... And it left a trail of pain. He felt like a ghost, like a shadow. He often wondered if Draco felt that, too. Hermione and Ron assured him that the idiot was Malfoy and not him... Even though Harry didn’t believe them. Maybe if he hadn't said that thing... Maybe... But he was so angry. He didn't think it... Now it was all gone and he didn't know how to fix it. Thay couldn't even stay in the same room. How that happened. Ron tried to reassure him but Harry felt like Hermione when he left them the year before.
"Fine" It wasn’t exactly "fine," but Harry preferred not to linger. It was an error, because they two both stopped to look at him. "We set up rules, that’s all." Harry didn't want to talk about them, because he should have told them everything, and he didn't know how to.
During the lesson, the two ex-enemies really enjoyed themselves, so much that they decided to do it again. In the hours they shared, they sat together, mostly making fun of each other (which made McGonagall proud, seeing them together at Transfiguration's Class).
"Yes, but I don't care anymore, get it? It doesn't matter" He assured him, holding him by the wrist.
Since that year the company has not broken up. Someone married, someone had children, but their friendship was always the same.
"A little? Mate, sometimes you scare me". They continued to talking (not about Ron, fortunately for him) until Molly called them for breakfast.
"Let me guess, Potter-Malfoy, right?" Grounded out Draco. Mumbled something like "perfect!", took his bag and left almost running.
When they returned to their rooms, Harry sat on his bed and Draco, seeing him, decided to go to speak to him.
Several times Draco woke up in panic, Harry always tried to help him, but every time he did not allow him.
"But I-" Draco couldn't finish the phrase, because Harry kissed him. Draco kissed him back. They were burning... they both needed it. They took off their jackets and then their shirts ...
One night, they all were in the common room, Draco and Harry sat together in a small sofa, when Blaise proposed "Guy, What if we spent Christmas together?"
"Scorpius, don't listen to your father, he's never understood the importance of the colors" Draco said, going upstairs "James, Albus! I already told you that your sister is not a toy. Harry, take Lily."
"Neville, look, it's Harry. Hello, Harry!" It was Luna's dreamy voice, who, with Neville and his and his extravagant plant, was looking for a free cabin. "There are Ron and Hermione, too"
The rest of the journey they stayed with the others, laughing at the jokes of a drunk pansy at Christmas.
The next afternoon, trying to predict his death for Trelawney, Harry told his friends about the previous night.  They look at him, almost in shock.
"Come on, Arthur, they must stay strong. Harry, do you want something else? No? Hermione?". Reluctantly she turned to Ron, who never refused food.
"Sorry, I'm late, I have to help Blaise with the dinner." He left the room abruptly, leaving Harry alone.
"Well, of course." debuted Hermione, raising his head from the book "Don't you read the Prophet? His father went to Azkaban, then they fell into disgrace. He can only study and get a proper job. This year he will be there."
P.P.S. This joke is the only one so far that requires a response. And isn’t a joke. You do seem lonely. And I rather fancy you, I have for years. Please write back quickly.
Harry was wrenched from his thoughts when Ron elbowed him getting up from the table. Oh! The feast had ended, and Harry was the only one left seated at Gryffindor table. He clumsily got up and followed the other students out of the Great Hall. He was about to follow the other Gryffindors up to the tower when he realized he had no idea where the eighth year dorm was located. Luckily, Professor Vector was waiting at the bottom of the staircase with the other eighth years.
“What the fuck, Harry! Warn a bloke first,” Ron sputtered. “Are you sure that’s what you saw? We always knew Malfoy'd be a Keeper, not a Beater. He owns a fashion boutique, for Merlin's sake."
Harry’s jaw dropped. Was Draco actually singing about his cock? It was probably for the best that he hadn’t sung this at karaoke, or Harry would have dragged him offstage and fucked him against the wall in the bathroom like the caveman he felt himself becoming. Fast and dirty, while Draco begged for more…. Dammit. Singing that other song in those bloody leather trousers had been bad enough. At least they were alone this time.
“I know. I regret how things ended. Believe me, Draco, I do. But I’ve grown up, and I want to try again. You don’t seem like yourself these days; I want the old you back.”
She held him at arm’s length, inspecting him with obvious concern before she again took her place at the table. “Happy birthday,
He couldn’t stop thinking about Malfoy. Perhaps he hadn’t really meant to flirt with Harry? Tailors did have to get awfully close to their clients; Harry had experienced that before, but it felt
“You know I don’t need that,” Harry huffed. “You might be stupidly rich, but I have more than enough money. I don’t need you.”
A bead of sweat rolled down Harry’s forehead. Merlin, had it always been so hot in their room? Harry cast a dirty look at the blazing fire and waved his wand to extinguish it. Yet he was still burning up from Malfoy’s touch, so he ripped off his thick woolen jumper and tossed it on the bed. He had to
Neville’s cheeks were slowly turning a deep scarlet. He began sketching a very lifelike Trevor next to the plant. (Drawing Trevor was certainly not part of the assignment; Professor Sprout did not care for toads.)
Harry tried very hard not to listen, but he still heard far more than he liked as he made a break for the library door. “Shame, I had such a good story about lube too. Mistakes are no joke: walked funny for a week, I did. Remember when…” Seamus’s voice finally dwindled into the distance as the heavy library door closed, but Harry couldn’t forget what he’d heard. He had known Seamus and Dean were together, but he’d never thought about it much. At least they had been subtle, unlike Ron and Hermione (ugh).
Draco sighed dramatically and shook his head, lifting one hand to the intricate mother-of-pearl buttons that barred entry to his stiff shirt collar. "Very well. I suppose this necessitates a costume change. Go sit at the dining room table and wait for me.” Harry was rather hoping Draco would start stripping in front of his delighted audience, but instead, he retreated to his bedroom and shut the door firmly behind him. Not wanting to waste a single second, Harry legged it to the dining room.
His eyes slid again to Draco Malfoy’s face on the other side of the hall. Instead of hope, it burned with fierce intensity. Gray eyes pretended to watch the Sorting, but Harry could tell his attention was really focused elsewhere. The war had ended, the fallen mourned and buried, but could Malfoy still be up to something?
Unfortunately, the moonstones had absorbed too much energy from the moon during the weekend. Upon entering the shop later, Alfie had been overcome by their soothing properties and had passed out cold. Narcissa was delighted that Alfie had learned his lesson, and Draco was only mildly miffed by having to quarantine the moonstones in a dark box for the rest of the week. They were involved in a long and fascinating discussion about the magical properties of moonstone when a distinct clicking sound pervaded their conversation. A tiny puffball of a creature was flapping around in erratic loops and tapping at the skylight above.
Neither did Draco. He lazily flicked his wand, and the casement popped open. The owl entered and hopped over to the tea table, fluttering up to Draco’s lap and sticking out a scroll with his name on it. Unfortunately, Draco recognized the spiky handwriting as he reluctantly unfurled the parchment.
Harry scowled. Almost as if he’d felt it, Malfoy’s silvery eyes flickered in his direction. He graced Harry with a charming smile, then raised his wine glass with a courtly nod.
Harry nodded, his mind made up, and strode across the street to Luxe. The shop was dark, but the door was unlocked. Once he pushed it open, Harry could see a light on in the back room.
At its master’s admission, the marble door creaked open, revealing a perfectly normal hallway through its perfectly normal frame.
Harry chose to ignore that last aside, just as he was ignoring the breadth of Malfoy’s shoulders in that damn suit. His eyes widened. “Wait, focus group? Who was in your focus group?”
Several hours later, Harry was pacing. This was nothing new; Kreacher had had to replace the hall runner twice, and complained about it to anyone who would listen. So Harry had taken to pacing in his shop instead, his heavy steps rattling the wobbly table on which the register rested.
Potter reached out and took hold of his sleeve. “Wait, Malfoy! I hate to do this, but…you owe me a life debt.” He hesitated. “I wish to ask a boon in exchange, which you are required to grant me.”
too much to ask if you don’t want me seeing my friends. It’s too much if I’m not allowed to talk to anyone but you, and you keep trying to push me into fucking you before I’m ready. I might never be ready, and you said you’d accept that, but now I don’t know what to think.” Harry sighed heavily and glanced away from Draco, into the brush. “Hermione thinks she’s being subtle, recommending all these books about unhealthy relationships, and I’m starting to think she’s right. We’re not good for each other. You’re not good for me.”
Ah-ha, they were in luck! Harry spotted the garish orange cart a few yards away and trotted over to buy some breakfast. The man traded Harry a flaky pastry for a few coins, and Harry sighed in satisfaction as they walked away. Just as he unfolded the wrapper to take his first ravenous bite, an aristocratically unimpressed voice interrupted.
He picked up the bracelet again, turning it in his hand to catch the light. Long-buried feelings still prickled when he thought of the man who had given it to him. They hadn’t seen each other in years, not since Malfoy had left Hogwarts. He hadn’t appeared in the papers at all, either. Where was Draco Malfoy now? Their relationship had been overwhelming for Harry at the time, but now that he’d gained some distance, he knew he would’ve handled it differently. Yes, Malfoy the dragon had been grasping and possessive, even downright rude to Harry’s friends. He’d been so unpredictable that he’d frightened Harry at times. But Draco had been sweet and a good listener and bitingly funny.
Zabini was already there when they arrived, unlacing his complicated robes. He hadn’t worn a shirt underneath, so each tug at the burgundy cord revealed another centimeter of satiny dark skin. Studying him, Harry realized he had never really thought much about Blaise Zabini before. Always lingering in the back of Harry’s school memories, shrouded behind Draco’s blustering, sharp-edged presence, Zabini was rather an unknown quantity.
Seeing that it was finally safe to continue, Draco did so. “So our favorite Golden Boy would like to know with which song I would have serenaded you, in front of everyone, after you publicly declared your undying love for me before all our friends?" Harry considered the question for a moment before he nodded. Didn’t seem like such a hard question to him.
“Er, is the room getting smaller?” Harry asked. Now that he was paying attention, the walls were certainly not where they had been. One could easily have done laps around the room before, but now it was around the size of a large automobile.
He made up his mind quickly and sprang up off the couch. “You know what, you’re right. Lead the way.” Harry mostly remembered the way to the prefect’s bathroom, but the moving staircases seemed to have a mind of their own today. Draco knew the way perfectly, and squired Harry along like a knight escorting his young queen. Harry felt rather silly, but he did want a bath.
“Oi, Luna! You want some flowers?” Harry hollered as he saw their friend enter. She smiled and loped toward their table.
: even the word itself seemed special, more splendiferous than others. His mate was supposed to comfort him, to allow themself to be cherished and coddled. His mate was supposed to love him above all else. As his birthday approached, a shred of hope dwelled in Draco’s chest. He would come of age, he would find his mate, and his life would be worth living again.
“Here, I have a list for you! One minute.” Hermione jumped up from the table and went to have a look, eventually finding it at the very bottom of her handbag. The list was short, barely six or seven names. Two in Cornwall, one in Surrey...and the very last residence happened to be Malfoy Manor.
Moments later, a red plastic tray was shoved in front of him, a miniature water cup waiting at its side, and Malfoy seated sedately across the booth. Harry took a deep breath, and lifted the crunchy, fist-sized spider to his mouth. He could see no way out but through. If he could kill Voldemort, he could eat some bloody bug without dying. Right?
“Are you alright?” Harry asked her. She nodded, quiet as her head was surely swirling with ideas. Ron and Hermione remained utterly silent for the rest of the day (Hermione didn’t even raise her hand once in class), but the next day they were their usual selves. Harry occasionally saw Hermione rubbing the scar on her arm in Malfoy’s presence, but that was all. They did not seem to want to discuss the letter.
“I suppose that will do,” McGonagall said resignedly. “Find a partner and practice the waltz, please.” She strode to the phonograph and started it up again. Harry panicked at the thought of perhaps having to dance with Malfoy a second time, and hurriedly reached out for Hermione’s wrist.
“Weasley. Just the man I wanted to see. And Granger, too: wonderful. This is for the three of you,” he explained, passing a heavy, cream-colored envelope to Hermione. She took it hesitantly between the tips of two fingers, as though he were trying to hand her a wriggling parcel of damp flobberworms.
They followed the signs to a market, and Harry was captivated. People from all over the world were casually strolling around, past racks of vintage clothing and cheap tchotkes. Piles of loose spices, a woman selling fresh crepes, intricate little gadgets, handmade muslin and linen billowing in the breeze. Even with all the wonders he’d seen in the wizarding world, Harry had never been to such a market. They ordered mugs of deep, rich chocolate and sat people-watching near the canal’s tired Christmas decorations. When it was too cold to shop anymore, they cut briskly through a park to get to the Victoria & Albert Museum. Unsurprisingly, there Draco was in his element. Harry loved the stained glass exhibit and could have stayed there for hours, just taking in the play of light and color. Draco was obscenely delighted or scandalized by every single object on display. Harry had to talk him out of absconding with a seventeenth century frog-shaped purse for Pansy Parkinson, finally reminding him that “look, she’d never appreciate it as much as the museum would. You’ve told me how she treats her shoes.”
Ron guffawed and toasted Harry with his butterbeer. “I guess you just have to get Malfoy to let you in. Good luck with that, mate.”
Draco took a deep breath, and the marks around his eyes slowly faded. He was once again just a boy, if an outlandishly attractive one. “I see. I am disappointed, of course, but I will do my best to keep you. After all, I have to demonstrate how wonderful holidays at the manor can be.” Cinnamon and sugared plums seemed to scent the air as Draco extolled the many virtues of a Malfoy Christmas. “You haven’t truly celebrated Yule until you’ve tried the Malfoy version of
about? Had someone slipped him a lust potion or something? Maybe Smith had fired a spell when Harry wasn’t looking, something that would make Malfoy instantly lose his mind. Harry frantically cast his eyes about the room, searching for alternate exits or clues or for anything that would help turn things right side up again.
Malfoy's eyes practically popped out of his head. “Mal!” he bellowed. “What in the name of Salazar himself do you think you’re doing? Return the doors this very instant!”
“Friendly neighborhood...how absurd,” Draco scoffed. “You saved the world, which was already more than what everyone deserves. You owe nothing to no one. Except for me, of course.” He shot Harry a devilish grin before his face grew serious again. “Be whoever you want, Harry.”
Harry slouched in the entryway, tracing the lines in one flagstone with the toe of his sneaker. It was the perfect fall day outside: the leaves were beginning to turn, Hagrid’s pumpkins glowed bright orange beside his cottage, and the air was beautifully crisp. Yet Harry was stuck inside the castle. For some barmy reason, it was barely October and McGonagall was already insisting on “special lessons” for the Yule Ball.
“What! Let me taste it,” Hermione said, taking the sloshing goblet from his hand and sipping it hesitantly. “Oh! I was going to object, but that’s quite good.”
“Very well, Mr. Malfoy.” She turned to the ancient phonograph beside her and placed the needle on the record. The song, something vaguely mournful with lots of violins, crackled to life. “Please begin whenever you’re ready.”
“Not at all, Potter. Unless you’d like that, of course. But I’d hoped to discuss a few important issues before you disappeared again.” His hands kept playing with the cloak, almost mesmerizing in how they wound the fine fabric around one hand and let it fall. Until Harry saw what looked like an opening.
A shadow of grief darkened Hermione’s face. "No, actually. I restored my parents' memories, but the only way to avoid permanent brain damage was to do it gradually. They only remembered sending me off to Hogwarts in first year a few weeks ago, so they would be rather confused if an adult woman came home for the holidays rather than their twelve year old daughter.” She sniffed, and a watery smile took over her face. “Besides, one last Christmas at Hogwarts sounds rather cheery, doesn’t it?"
. And Malfoy was sitting so close and his thigh was so strong and so warm, but it wasn’t possible for him to be actually interested in Harry. He wasn’t even bent, was he? He’d really only ever seen Malfoy with Parkinson, but he’d assured Harry weeks ago that they weren’t dating. “That vindictive bint? No, she knows too much,” Draco had derisively laughed. “Excellent shopping partner, though.” Harry smiled at the memory.
Cold sweat slicked every inch of Harry’s body when he woke, strangled by his sheets. He had to find Draco. He’d put this off as a last resort, but he knew just who to ask. She was terrifying, but Harry needed answers.
Harry’s heart skipped a beat. "Wait, formerly? I thought we were together! Proper couple and all that--"
For some reason, Harry hadn’t expected Hermione to ask that. “What? Er, I s’pose I did. It was definitely nicer than other kisses I’ve had, but it all happened so fast.”
Harry shrugged and started unbuttoning his shirt. The house seemed to have a specific agenda in mind, to which he really wasn’t opposed. Malfoy was nice now, and tried to make jokes, and was charmingly hopeless at baking, and the way he looked at Harry was so sharp and tender. Anything that Malfoy was okay with, Harry was okay with too.
“Pansy, Blaise, Greg--he adored them, you know, especially the Tex-Mex--but I digress. They would never lie to me.”
), I set myself the task of learning how to use a computer. Hence my reason for initiating this correspondence.
“And to you, Potter,” Malfoy said, nodding at Harry’s Snitch & Stitch. “I’ve heard your establishment has become very popular.”
“Please,” Draco grinned, holding his arm out for Harry to take. He felt rather like an aged old woman or a Southern debutante, having some young man’s arm offered to him, but took it nonetheless. It was nice to be so close to someone so warm.
“Hmm. Maybe you’re right.” Harry fell back against the cushions, heavy with food and thought. Could he really just be whoever he wanted now, instead of being the Boy Who Lived? Why hadn’t he ever realized that before? A world of new possibilities seemed to unfold before him. He could be Just Harry, with Just Draco. Doing whatever he liked, instead of what everyone expected. That didn’t sound too bad at all.
At least they were if Draco would ever let them leave. The way he was fussing about reminded Harry a bit too much of Mrs. Weasley sending her brood off to Hogwarts. A fervent pat here, an indulgent smile there: it was all a bit Too Much.
Hermione finally finished her barrage of spells and sat back, looking rather like the niffler who got the gold. “Harry, there are
,” Draco grumbled. “Why’re the house elves still using the winter bedding? They should know better by now, they’re only millions of fucking years old.” He thought he saw steam rising from his skin, but dismissed it as his imagination.
Harry scoffed, crossing his arms. “Fat chance, Malfoy. But we can try to be friends, I s’pose, if we don’t kill each other trying.”
When Harry returned a few hours later (staying out rather longer than he would have liked on the frigid Quidditch pitch, but it was worth it to avoid an irate Hermione), he peeked through the cracked door to see if it was safe to return. Luckily, the dust seemed to have cleared. Hermione was studying in Harry’s desk chair as Ron packed his trunk to go home for the holidays.
“We’re coming, ‘Mione. It’s just, a bloke never wants to embarrass himself in front of the whole year, y’know? Hopefully I don’t have to dance with McGonagall this time,” Ron rolled his eyes again. He’d been doing that all morning.
Harry groaned aloud. Ugh, what a pretentious name. Must be owned by a pureblood. He sighed, but went in anyway.
"--and Draco, who tried to arouse some mysterious dark man who’s not even here, you’re all serenading each other anyway. Let’s make it a little more interesting,” she grinned, summoning an empty butterbeer bottle from the bin in the corner.
Malfoy’s pale face became waxy and hollow, reminding Harry of a skull. “As far as I know, that’s never happened in my family’s history. I’m inclined to believe my life would become rather difficult.”
He shuffled awkwardly under her gaze, tempted to stare at the rows of corked indicator potions instead. “I thought we were just going to the pub again. Wait, what’s carry-oaky?”e
"Oh how lovely! We can have Christmas crackers, and maybe some mulled wine, and even start studying for our NEWTS…" Hermione should not have been nearly so starry-eyed at the thought of spending the holidays studying some moldering old books. But Harry knew his friend well, and warmed at the excitement on her face.
Third, Malfoy had called him his mate. Mate, hmm…what was that supposed to mean? Judging by all the aggressive snogging, Malfoy definitely didn’t mean it in the same way Ron did, like one brother talking to another. Was it supposed to be something romantic? Or had his whole friendship with Malfoy been some elaborate scheme, some way to hurt or trick Harry?
“Spideys? You don’t think it’s really…” Ron shuddered in disgust after reading the sign, his freckled face going pale.
Harry nudged Malfoy’s shoulder with his own, surprised by the sudden tingle that ran through his body. “What about you, then? What does the great Draco Malfoy want to do with his life?”
Incidentally, he adored your joke. It reduced him to uninhibited giggles for a full four minutes. I shouldn’t be surprised that he found your childish sense of humor utterly appealing.
Now Potter was practically leaping about the stage, all of his earlier shyness having faded. He raked a hand through his shaggy hair, lewdly shaking his hips in Draco’s direction and flashing him a lascivious grin.
Harry furrowed his brow. Why was Malfoy being so mysterious? Maybe it was some kind of pureblood arranged marriage thing. That thought sent a pang through Harry’s heart, and he hurried to rearrange his face before Malfoy could notice..  “Hmm. Do you know when you’ll hear about the something else?”
He plopped back down at the table, seemingly stumped. “We sat at the table and drank the tea and ate the biscuits--”
Ron sat across from her, mumbling the lyrics under his breath as he drummed out the beat on his thighs. “Sweet little unforgettable...hmm.” He was obviously aware he’d missed something, but she was sure it would take some time for him to figure it out. And him an Auror and everything. With such a fantastic start to the night, what could possibly go wrong?
Malfoy placed the hamper on the ground (he’d insisted on carrying it), pulled a silk handkerchief from his sleeve, and enlarged it to the size of a blanket. He laid it out with a flourish and patted the spot beside him. “Scared, Potter?” he asked, gazing coyly up at Harry through dark blond lashes. Harry suppressed the shiver that wanted to run through him at
Malfoy rolled his eyes and muttered as he stalked away, “Maybe I’d be the murderer, you don’t know.”
“No, Blaise. It is spin the bottle, but you mustn't kiss anyone. At least, one is not required to do so. The chosen person has to perform a song for whoever the bottle lands on, expressing their true feelings towards that person.” She leaned over and tapped the karaoke machine with her wand. “Starting now. Who’d like to go first?”
Potter, the site to which you referred me is blocked on the library’s computers. BLOCKED. What kind of lurid filth are you trying to send me? Is it the same place where you’re getting all the awful jokes? If even the Muggles are wise enough to block it, it must be truly depraved. Please advise.
Harry loosened the drawstring of the velvet purse. He glanced inside and saw...nothing? Maybe Malfoy had forgotten to put the gift in?
no matter how pretty he was. So Harry needed to get thoroughly fucked. He needed to get over Malfoy by getting under someone else. Such a cliche, but Harry hoped it was true. He didn’t know what else to do at this point.
It wasn’t until he’d shaken Malfoy’s hand, said his goodbyes, and was a hundred yards away that it hit him: he’d agreed to go out on a date with
Harry stood behind Pansy’s entourage and waited for them to notice him. “Pansy, can I have a word? Outside, please.”
The vein in Ron’s forehead was still throbbing, but his mouth had dropped open and showed no sign of closing any time soon. Hermione had the good grace to keep her mouth closed, but she was gnawing on her lower lip as though it were a sugar quill, her eyes fixed on Malfoy across the hall.
The common room door slammed shut behind Harry, and a confused Ron turned to his smiling girlfriend. “What was that all about?” he asked.
The man turned a pale green and ran out the door as fast as his polished wingtips could take him. As the teen working the register sighed and scrubbed one hand against his sweaty forehead, Draco Malfoy slid out of the shadows. His three-piece designer suit seemed entirely incongruous with the image of a fast food manager, but the orange and black applique at his breast proclaimed him a proud member of the Spideys team.
“Shirt. Off.” Malfoy said as he lifted a Quick-Quotes Quill, parchment, and a measuring tape from the table.
rare wizarding delicacy, Potter. I’m not surprised that some people'' he cut his eyes at the door, obviously thinking of Ron “are simply too uncultured to appreciate it. But I suppose it’s simply not one’s fault if one isn’t properly exposed to culture. I do adore fried spideys.” Malfoy glanced away for a moment, almost giving Harry an opportunity to spit the wad of chewed-up spider into his napkin, but he looked back too quickly.
A wizard who seemed to be the proprietor stood behind the counter with his back to Harry as he spoke quietly to a cheerful employee. Harry admired the man’s slim-cut gray Muggle suit. Merlin, the man’s shoulders were so broad, but it was tailored perfectly to them. Watching the muscles below the cloth flex and tense minutely was intoxicating. The suit made his legs seem to stretch for miles, and the man’s arse was
of apparition split the room, but Harry saw only the tip of one pointy ear poking from a nearby cupboard. Apparently, that was as close as Bitsy was willing to come to strangers. Malfoy shrugged and continued, slightly more calmly. “Tea, please. With those apple cheddar scones.” The tiny ear bobbed in agreement, and another crack indicated the house elf’s disappearance.
“Sorry, ‘Mione,'' he gasped. “But some of the girls are giving me weird looks now. Ron’ll understand.”
Ambling down Diagon Alley on a sunny day was one of Harry’s favorite things to do. Particularly mid-morning, when the shops were quiet and Diagon’s normal throngs were thin. He paused to admire the new Firebolt in the window of Quality Quidditch Supplies and licked thoughtfully at his half-gone mint chocolate chip ice cream. He’d stopped at Fortescue’s for a cone, and the cheery witch behind the counter had recommended a jewelry store down the street. But Harry was certainly in no hurry.
Malfoy finally smiled, meaning Harry had probably just made an enormous fool of himself.. “You want me to be your boyfriend, Potter? A bit of a surprise, but I wouldn’t say no. That’s what
“Right. Best get on with it, then.” Harry told himself in a businesslike tone. His day off wouldn’t last forever, and it would be good to get things over with.
Neon lights slid lazily across the dance floor, highlighting a buff redhead here, a mesh shirt there. The air was thick with sweat and glitter. It wasn’t one of the nicer clubs, but Harry didn’t want nice tonight. He wanted someone who would slap and bite and thrust and leave. Despite the packed dance floor, pickings were slim tonight. Everyone else already had a partner. Harry sat at the bar and nursed his drink, glaring at the couples on the floor.
Hermione’s shoulders relaxed when she heard she was to room with Hannah Abbott, and Harry sighed with relief when he heard his name paired with Ron’s. It wasn’t as though he’d expected anyone to curse him in his sleep, but he had enough changes to worry about without having a hostile roommate. For a moment he wondered what it would have been like to share  with Malfoy, to trust his rival enough to sleep in his presence, to see Malfoy shirtless or even nude...but then he shoved that image away with both metaphorical hands. He was bent, but he was definitely not even remotely interested in Draco Malfoy.
Ron, who had visibly shivered at the phrase ‘Draco’s pants,’ collected himself and went on. “Really? I thought you’d want to, since you’re dating him and all? I’m sure as hell
For as long as he could remember, Draco had always been lonely. It was at first the loneliness of a pampered child on a large estate, kept company by house elves and peacocks and an endless string of tutors. He spoke French, his first and truest language, with only his mother, erecting another unintentional barrier between himself and others. At Hogwarts, his loneliness morphed, resembling the solitude that only the most influential and popular experienced. He was surrounded by admirers, lackeys, or even envious enemies, but kept them all at arm’s length. When the Dark Lord came to Malfoy Manor, Draco’s loneliness shifted and became invaluable. The fewer people knew him, the fewer people he had to protect.
! I said I’d give you a chance, and I did. I just wanted to have a quiet year for once, and this...this is too serious for me. I don’t want it.”
Malfoy half-sighed and half-laughed, a weary, relieved sound. “It is.” He looked so soft and open, more vulnerable than Harry had ever seen. Between one breath and the next, Harry leaned forward and kissed him.
That night, Harry again dreamed of Malfoy in a walled garden. Where once had been light and life, he only saw desiccation and ruin. Bitter fear wormed into his heart. He jogged through the garden’s winding paths, skidding against dusty bricks and tripping over arid vines. He knew he was searching for Draco.
“Good effort, Louis. But I believe I instructed you to pronounce it spee-eye-dees. You know, just like those Muggles on the interwebs.”
She shot him a dark look. “Fair point, but that’s not what I meant, Finnegan. The singing is perfectly adequate; it’s the song selection that is lacking. Except for Weasley, who can’t sing at all--"
“I’m sure you’ve tried everything. But it is a magical bracelet, Harry. It probably doesn’t want to be returned.” Her expression softened and she took his hand. “Look, I know that you ended things with Malfoy for excellent reasons, but have you ever really let go of your feelings for him? Are things really over between the two of you?”
Green eyes met grey as Potter weighed his options. Draco simply raised one arrogant eyebrow and took a long sip of his wine.
Harry paused in his pacing and glanced at himself in the mirror on the back of the bedroom door, noting the glazed look in his eye. No, he’d better not think about that. At least...not right now.
“She seems nice. Er, if you have a house elf, why did you answer your own door?” Harry blurted out. Invisible hands deposited a large tea tray onto the table between them as the words were still leaving Harry’s mouth.
“Er, yes. I can’t promise I’ll be your mate,” Harry said slowly. “But I guess we could give this--us--a try.”
Knowing that group, they definitely would lie, especially if they thought it funny. “Unless they were taking the mick out of you,” Harry muttered under his breath.
“At least the punch is potable. As we are at a ball...Harry, may I have this dance?” Draco asked with a courtly bow.
Or at least, not Draco as he had been. Former Draco had been willowy, almost delicate-looking. He had taken pride in his pale, elegant features, and hexed anyone who insinuated otherwise. (Blaise had taken to calling him a twink, but Draco did him the courtesy of pretending not to hear.) This Draco had gained at least a stone in long, lean muscles. He flexed one thick arm, feeling the new power coiled within it. That at least was a welcome change. Draco was also significantly taller, by at least six inches. The lines of his jaw and cheekbones were more pronounced than ever. But rather than looking skeletal, he looked dangerous. Predatory. Most shocking of all, his previously grey eyes blazed a terrifying silver, as did the markings surrounding them.
Draco laughed breathlessly from his squashed position against Harry’s broad chest. “My, if I had known this would be my welcome, I’d have returned much sooner. Did you miss me that much already?”
, you feel good, Malfoy,” Harry grunted. He could feel the hard length of Draco’s cock against his leg and felt inordinately proud. He thrust against it, loving the agonizing tingle that spread through his body. He did it again and again, until he thought he could come by rutting alone, but Draco took his face in his hands to stop him.
Finally Harry’s words began to sink in. Draco’s eyes widened and his handsome features hung ghastly with panic. “What?! Harry, I’m sorry, I can change, I just didn’t realize how strongly you felt about this--”
Look, I replied. Even speccy gits can do that, you tosser. And it’s e-mail, not electronic mail. Everyone’ll think you’re a pretentious prat if you go around calling it that. They wouldn’t be far off, but still.
Draco was practically vibrating with excitement, far too much to sit. “Mother. I have a mate after all. I’ve gone through the inheritance, finally; there could be no mistaking that.” He grimaced, recalling the pain of transformation, before he went on. “But why would this be happening now?”
After an hour or so, Harry watched as his body lurched away from the bar. Apparently he was drunk and lonely enough to brave the dance floor after all. Harry’s body stumbled through the crowd, finding an open space in one corner. Green light flashed overhead as Harry’s arms rose and his hips swayed to the thumping bass. It felt so good to let go, to let his mind float free, even if he had to dance alone.
It was a time for action. So Harry decided on the action of actually doing his homework for once. Procrastination wasn’t procrastination if one was doing schoolwork, right? And people weren’t supposed to talk in the library at all. He would sit and quietly finish his Charms essay for Flitwick and not think of anything else.
Harry gulped his own tea and carefully set the dainty cup down on the table. It felt like it was about to break any minute, and the rug looked expensive. “So, about the house--”
“I think this is the right place.” It wasn’t a chippy, as Harry had expected, or even a shawarma place, but some kind of cuisine he’d never seen before.
The symptoms all added up, and his heart leapt in anticipation. He tried to focus on the pull, but the more he focused, the fainter it became.
Harry cringed at the mysterious brown goop inside, but covered it with a smile. “Nah, I’m stuffed. Thanks, Draco.”
Everywhere else Harry looked was soft: thick rugs spilled over the floor, and overstuffed cushions practically begged one to flop onto them and roll around. There was even a fucking chaise in one corner, gilded and gaudy. Draco was the pointiest thing in the room, but Harry’s heart warmed at the sight of him. In the odd wavering light of the lake, he looked positively ethereal, intangible, as if he could disappear at any moment.
Harry rested his head carefully against the nook behind Malfoy’s ear and hummed, "You know, I think I could study your house for weeks. Months. Years, even."
Harry turned. Was he offended? “You said you were just teasing. I figured we were done and I should leave.”
?” Harry groaned, long and loud. His body had rather forgotten it had bones at all, judging by how irrationally he was splayed over the sofa.
Harry,” Malfoy snarled, latching on to Harry’s neck and sucking a dark love bite into the skin just below his jaw. “No one else’s.” A sound that couldn’t possibly have been a whimper fell from his lips, and Malfoy hummed quietly in appreciation. He dug his teeth into Harry’s neck on the next bite, and the razor-thin line between pleasure and pain was far too much to handle silently.
Neville nodded, his tongue sticking out of his mouth as he worked on a very detailed botanical drawing of some plant or other. Something with lots of tendrils that one would not like to come across in a dark forest. (At least, anyone but Neville.)
Before the words had fully left his mouth, the low hum of a single note on a cello resonated through the space. Other instruments joined the cello one by one, until an entire invisible symphony had come into being around Harry and Malfoy. After they’d tuned themselves, the instruments began to play together. It was languid and blissful. The music was familiar, like something half-remembered from one’s favorite dream.
While Harry had been staring at the room, Malfoy had apparently been staring at him. Harry glanced back at his host and he quickly looked away. His ears were very pink.
“Not really, no,” Harry replied, dunking a biscuit in his tea. “I usually do it by myself. It’s rather nice to have company, I think.” Malfoy didn’t respond, but his cheeks pinked pleasantly.
He heard Ron’s voice first. “Look, you know how I feel about...well, you, and about things. We’re done at Hogwarts in just a few months. I’m not saying we have to start a family right away, but maybe we should get married and see what happens? Mum always says--”
bit to do with Ron and Hermione’s new problem. Quite frankly, spending time with Ron and Hermione had become unbearable in a completely different way than it had been before. Harry wasn’t quite sure what was going on, but saying the slightest wrong word to either of them would have them  arguing like cats and dogs. Harry couldn’t even go into his own room these days, as he tried one morning and heard his two best friends arguing for the umpteenth time.
He was tempted to start dry-heaving right on the street. Just as he was leaning over to do so, dragonhide boots scraping against the cobblestones, another thought came to mind:
. Now hush...you asked for this, so just listen.” He cleared his throat and began to sing, low and sultry.
” Ron exploded. “It’s bloody Malfoy the Death Eater! Of course they’re not soul mates, that’s not even a thing! Only in Ginny’s silly romance novels...”
To Harry’s great surprise, Draco Malfoy himself swung open the broad oak door. He was as blond and angular as ever, but his formerly severe hair fell unbound in waves to his shoulders. He wore a fitted suit in tawny linen with a deep blue pocket square. Harry was stunned to see him in Muggle clothes at all; judging by the gawking look on Malfoy’s face, he was surprised too. “Potter? To what could one possibly owe the pleasure?”
So Harry was in high spirits when he knocked again at the wide oak door. When Malfoy answered, the first thing Harry noticed was the pout. Thin pink lips were twisted in a petulant sneer that reminded Harry unpleasantly of a pale outstretched hand and insults to his first friend. Bitter irritation rose in Harry’s throat until he noticed one other thing.
“Give it here, then,” Draco ordered, holding out one hand for the letter. “I don’t wish to extend your visit for any longer than you do.” The owl complied, and Draco held another letter with Potter’s familiar spiky handwriting.
Harry waved a hand absentmindedly in Ron’s direction. “Oh, the toast is for Parkinson. But Malfoy’s definitely suspicious. Look how shifty he looks--”
Harry nodded and cautiously opened the golden door. Instead of offering a glimpse into the room beyond, the doorway was obscured with a shimmering film, like the inside of a soap bubble. After casting a few spells to determine any danger, Harry carefully stuck his head through...only to find an enormous Quidditch pitch. Empty stands surrounded a vast blue sky and the most luxuriant lawn imaginable. Pristine brooms shone in a rack next to a rattling trunk that Harry surmised contained the full set of Quidditch balls. A tiny golden Snitch glinted in the sun where it hovered near the goalposts.
Merlin, his lips were soft. Their kiss felt like a blessing. Malfoy melted into him, and Harry’s hands pulled him closer. Strong arms, a ticklish spot at his side, even the particular crook of his shoulder blade...he loved it all. Malfoy sighed into his mouth, and something Harry hadn’t known he was missing clicked into place deep inside. He no longer felt the itch to study, the hunger to learn more. Maybe he had finally explored enough.
Harry almost choked on the water Hermione had conjured for him. “Too right, mate.” He settled in to observe the Sorting, enjoying the looks of wonder on the new students’ faces. Surely he’d never been that small; they just looked tiny. Each of them trembled with anticipation and hope. They made him feel that all the fighting and death had truly been worth it, if each of them could attend Hogwarts and make friends and not worry about their safety or their friends’ deaths.
Draco would probably have laughed in anyone else’s face, but he restricted himself to a slight moue of amusement. “Yes, but you must allow me to lead.
He ignored the man before him and walked down the street, head held high. Rough footsteps clattered behind him as Potter followed. Draco sauntered on, even slowing to look in a shop window or two, until he had reached the isolated end of Diagon Alley. He’d expected Potter to give up by now, and it irked him that the man had persisted. Draco turned, folded his arms across his chest, and summoned his best scowl.
Malfoy hid a small smile behind his teacup again. "How fascinating, Potter. I suppose you didn't peak in school after all."
Draco frowned, but finally stopped, settling Harry’s back against his chest and holding him close. “As my mate demands. What did you wish to discuss?”
Hermione waved a hand irritably. “As well as can be expected. You know how attached wixen are to the subjugation of house elves. I hope bringing house elves into the legal office as full employees will turn out well, but it’s certainly an uphill road for the time being.”
“Ugh. You absolute git, ‘difficult’ isn’t descriptive at all. I don’t want to be your dragon mate or whatever, but I don’t want you to die or anything either.”
“Yes, only sleeping. I need to feel close to you. Please?” It was unfair that such a mercurial, pompous man could summon such devastatingly pleading eyes. Absolutely unlawful.
Harry decided he was much too tired to trust his own brain at the moment, changed quickly, and hurried to Draco’s bed before he could think anymore.
A soft gasp found Harry’s ears. Draco stood just a step away, all roses and cream in his soft blue shirt, his sharp grey eyes consuming Harry whole. Heat rose in Harry’s cheeks, embarrassment and lust battling in his stomach.
Harry nodded emphatically, clapping her hard on the shoulder. Her slender frame rocked forward a bit before she regained her balance. “Of course it can. I mean, we’re still in school, we’re too young! You’ve got, what, another twenty years to have kids. That’s
Harry was entranced. Before he knew it, he was across the room and reaching out for the leg with hungry, trembling hands. The leg was displeased by this, and kicked Harry solidly in the shin.
After a few more confusing moves. Harry was spinning and spinning and spinning. Everything around him blurred, until suddenly Malfoy twined Harry’s arm about his neck and they were face to face. Harry’s breath hitched as Malfoy’s breath ghosted over his lips. He had never before noticed that ring of blue around each of Malfoy’s pupils, or the intensity of Malfoy’s expression as they stared at each other. Were there other things he’d failed to notice? All at once Harry’s body was curved in a delicate dip, and the dance was over.
Harry slumped back onto the table, narrowly avoiding a platter of toast. “Fine, I’ll just wait for them to die then.”
Malfoy’s mouth twitched, and his eyes gleamed with amusement. Harry tried to think what he had done to cause that expression, but he’d only asked a perfectly normal question. “Yes, that’s exactly what it means. I wasn’t aware you spoke French, Potter. Pick up a new language over the summer hols?”
unacceptable, and the offending party ought to be severely punished, but that trying to punish a house would be futile.
Ron choked on his pumpkin juice. “Merlin’s saggy jockstrap, Malfoy wants to shag you. I think my breakfast is coming back up…” He hobbled off holding his stomach, presumably to find the nearest loo.
Draco regarded Harry with a wolfish grin, tracing the side of his face gently. “Yes, you’re all mine.”
Harry rolled his eyes and chomped down anyway, correcting his boyfriend through a mouthful of sausage. “Shuddup, you’ll offend people. It’s called a sausage roll. You really haven’t had one?”
“Thank you, Headmistress,” Malfoy said, an odd smirk curving about his mouth. His body was still bent over Harry’s, until Harry straightened and almost knocked Malfoy right in his pointy nose.
A shocked Harry spun around to see Draco Malfoy leaning casually against the wall, half-hidden in an alcove, running his well-groomed hands over Harry’s cloak.
Hogsmeade was some distance from the heavy iron gates of Hogwarts. The path ahead was dark, lit only by moonlight. Harry could see snatches of lit windows between the trees, but each twist and turn of the way took them away and revealed them again. Merlin, Draco was heavy. He could have used a feather-light charm, but the weight of Draco’s body against his own somehow made him feel safe, like nothing bad could ever happen to him again.
The hallways were hushed as Harry stepped through the portrait hole and made for the grand staircase. He caught sight of Draco’s white-blond hair from yards away, and the beauty of him stopped Harry in his tracks.
“In the flesh,” he drawled. “I couldn’t resist when I saw you here. I know what you saw in my shop. And I know that you liked it.”
Harry half-laughed, but there was no joy in it. “Sounds harsh, but yeah. At least not how you are now.” His face grew solemn again. “I’m sorry, Draco, but we’re not good for each other.”
His attention was captured by the door creaking open and an unbelievably long, supple leg slithering out. Intricate tendrils of emerald lace decorated the leg, twisting into the likenesses of many undulating snakes. The fine mist of blond hair on the leg didn’t distract from the lace at all, but rather seemed to make it shimmer and glow in the light.
Ron pretended to gag into his pint. “Mate. Can we please stop talking about Malfoy having sex? It’s putting me off, and I already ordered more chips.”
“Yes?” Draco asked, but his mouth kept tracing the long column of Harry’s neck, dispensing little nips and licks wherever he saw fit. It was
"I hope not," Harry grinned. It had been a surprisingly pleasant teatime, almost like talking to a friend. "What've you been up to, then?"
“Love, you’re going to kill me if you keep backing it up and I’m not allowed to touch,” Harry panted.
Draco nipped off a microscopic piece of roll and chewed consideringly. “Oh. That is surprisingly edible.”
Glancing at the man next to her, Pansy knew Draco’s face was pinking delicately. Apparently she hadn’t been the only one to know about his fondness for skirts and lace.
He turned, unwilling to see rejection or fear on Malfoy’s face, and continued undressing. He let his shirt fall from his shoulders and toed off his shoes. His jeans followed, puddling on the floor of the bathroom. It had been some time since he’d been naked before anyone else, so Harry removed his pants after a deep breath and stepped quickly into the tub. He settled into the bath with a sigh, warm ripples of water lapping at his skin. Lemon and orange and bliss perfumed the water, though Harry couldn’t imagine how the house had managed to put pure contentment in a bath bomb.
Malfoy flinched and took a step back. “Potter. I understand you’re upset. I would like to apologize for my unseemly behavior. However, there are some extenuating circumstances I should explain--”
And appear he did. After that day, Harry seemed to run into Malfoy wherever he went. It started small, with Malfoy happening to take the same routes to class as Harry did. Malfoy would happen to be in the library if Harry had dropped by to study, or would already be ensconced in the common room when Harry stepped through the portrait hole. If he’d decided to pop by Hogsmeade of an evening, Malfoy would come striding down the path behind him, saying that he fancied a drink or needed a new quill. If he hadn’t known better, Harry would have thought Malfoy had a Marauder’s Map too, for he seemed to know exactly where Harry was at all times.
His fumbling hands quickly removed each layer of clothing and kicked it into a pile in the corner. Harry walked down the shallow steps into the water’s embrace. He felt odd and tingly, as if there were something in the foam that made every nerve in his body stand on end and bask in its warmth. His toes left the marble bottom of the pool, and he felt utterly weightless. The carpet of glossy bubbles made it easy to float along just like one of them, changing Harry into a gossamer, incandescent being too. For once, Harry couldn’t overthink what was happening. For once, he decided to let go.
“Yes, buttering toast and talking to Zabini is very suspicious,” Hermione remarked dryly. She’d barely looked up from her book at all.
The very next evening, Draco was trying to enjoy his bath when the same hyperactive little owl tapped on his window. Of course Potter would contact him after business hours, how uncouth. It was downright rude.
The week of strange gifts continued, but they took a more serious turn after the enchanted cloak. On the fourth day, no package accompanied the letter when the owl dropped it at the Gryffindor table. Harry decided to open it anyway. Out of mere curiosity, of course.
“Haven’t you ever heard of being fashionably late, Weasley? No wonder no one ever invites you anywhere, you’re terribly gauche,” Draco observed, flat gray eyes scanning the group.
try. We don’t serve it at the restaurant (it’s too much of an acquired taste for these philistines, and it doesn’t fit the branding anyway), but there’s a delightful sea slug pate that the house elves make. It’s so
“I suppose you could do worse,” Draco finally admitted, his mouth twitching with suppressed laughter.
Harry shook his head. “Of course you don’t,” Malfoy drawled. “Just move your feet in a box and I’ll make us look good.”
“I would like to welcome each of you back to Hogwarts,” announced McGonagall, her spectacles flashing in the candlelight. “We will be making some significant changes this year. First, in an effort to foster inter house unity, our returning eighth years will be sharing a common room and dorms of their own. Professor Vector will be our eighth year head, so please address any questions or concerns with her.” Professor Vector, a tall woman in an even taller hat, waved her hand briefly before McGonagall continued.
PSA: As one reader has pointed out, if anyone is harassing you or stalking you, please go to the authorities. However, as this is a Drarry story, I can promise you lots of emotional growth and a happy ending. It will be much fluffier from here on out. Thank you for reading!
Harry, who was sitting practically on Malfoy’s lap at the other boy’s insistence, shrugged. “Yeah, I could always use more chocolate frogs. I bet Ron and Hermione would like to come too, we should ask them. Maybe even Parkinson? I should try to get to know your friends, too.”
“Oh, all right,” she laughed, shooing away a disgruntled Ron. Harry sighed with relief and guided them into a wobbly waltz. He didn’t quite understand how leading worked, and somehow they ended up in a far-off corner of the Great Hall. Circles were harder than they looked. But he’d only stepped on Hermione’s feet twice, so he considered it a win.
Would you perhaps like to join me at the Manor for dinner on Wednesday? Scorpius shall be with his mother, but I do owe you a meal. A Malfoy always pays his debts.
Dean smirked as the Headmistress stood to welcome the first years. “No, McGonagall wouldn’t be here if this were a dream.”
Harry huffed and raked a hand through his hair. “Sure, yes, whatever. But I feel like you don’t really see me anymore. I’m, you know, messy and angry and short and--”
“Hello to you too, Potter. I don’t wish to discuss it," Malfoy scowled, reaching up to tuck his hair behind his ear before he remembered it was no longer there. Instead, he thrust his hands into the pockets of his fitted grey trousers and glared at the floor.
Harry had suffered from insomnia since fifth year, so he often woke during the night. Malfoy also had problems sleeping, so he and Harry made a habit of sneaking to the kitchen under the invisibility cloak to raid it for snacks. Ron would still be snoring away in their room, while Harry and Malfoy sprawled cozily in front of the common room fire, sharing a treacle tart and swapping stories. Yes, Draco Malfoy had become a surprisingly good friend, despite their shared history.
“I hate quills, they break so easy,” Ron murmured as he fished a handful of broken quills from the bottom of his trunk.
Harry had hoped the first day had simply been a fluke, or some elaborate practical joke, but no. Tuesday’s letter was even worse. It arrived promptly at lunch time, accompanied by a pistachio green box with a fleur-de-lis trim. Harry shook the box gently, and something rattled softly inside. He set the box carefully aside and unfolded the letter.
Harry frowned. Flitwick was indeed developing a pronounced eye twitch, and his wand hand looked a bit shaky. Relief washed over his face as soon as Harry lowered his hand. But Harry wasn’t finished. As soon as class ended, he made a beeline for the library.
the posh arsehole.” Harry muttered, ripping apart a scone and imagining all the satisfying ways a particular white-blond head could be detached from its body.
Draco cut him off by placing one slender finger on his lips. “You’re wrong, Harry. It’s not that I don’t see your flaws. I see them, but I accept you exactly as you are. That’s what mates are meant to do.”
Still shaking with fury, Malfoy pressed his forehead against Harry’s and tried to take a deep breath. “Salazar, do you see to what you have reduced me? Damn you. If you haven’t figured it out by now, I’ll make you notice me.
After what seemed like hours, Harry found him. At least, what was left of him. Draco’s crumpled form lay abandoned beside a trickling fountain. The husk that had once been his body lifted one fragile hand to Harry. Harry paused, then reached to take it, but--he had waited too long. Just as his fingertip brushed Draco’s, he began to disintegrate into dust. The last image Harry saw was confusion and anguish on Draco’s lovely pale face.
He shrugged and shucked off his clothes, tossing them haphazardly on a velvet chair. He wouldn’t be here long enough for them to wrinkle anyway.
“What are you laughing at?” Malfoy asked suspiciously, swiping at his face and leaving a smear of flour on one cheekbone.
When Harry had been trying (and failing) to put Malfoy out of his mind for two weeks, he decided going out would help. Harry had always been a shite dancer (he was never sure what to do with his elbows), but he could usually pull just fine from the bar. He liked Malfoy--of course he did, how could anyone dislike a creature so beautiful--but a relationship with anyone was out of the question. And Harry knew he’d die of embarrassment if he did ever have a one-off with
“Honestly, you know I love Ron, but there’s just not a romantic bone in his body. I don’t think he’ll even propose properly; he’ll just buy a ring and announce we’re getting married in a month.” Hermione rolled her eyes before her face grew unbearably sad. She sniffled a bit as she added, “ugh...there’s so much I want to do with my life, and I think getting married and having children can wait.”
“Well, guess you do now. She’s right over there, but she figured you were worked up enough you wouldn’t want to be interrupted. Don’t think you realize how loudly you were yelling through the Floo, mate. She heard you from the other end of the house.” Ron jerked his head toward the bar and Harry turned to see the brunette leaning elegantly against it. Her features had softened in the years since Hogwarts, but Pansy Parkinson still had an aura of ruthless beauty, clad as she was in a chic black dress and lacy tights. And she was with Draco Malfoy, of course. His eyes scanned the room, but he occasionally stopped to share scathing comments about the crowd with Pansy. Ugh, had the man’s legs always been so bloody
Isn't the image of Draco and Harry making out in the foamy prefect's bathroom a lovely one? Now I'm dying to take a bath, even though my tub is nowhere near as nice. Let's be honest, no tub ever has been as nice as in the prefect's bathroom.
“Do you like it?” Potter whispered, low in his ear. Having forgotten the man was so close, Draco flinched a bit. He usually didn’t permit anyone to remain in his personal space; how had he so easily forgotten that Potter was there?
Harry thought sadly. His heart felt more icy and closed-off than ever as he considered how their entire friendship had been a lie.
Harry turned to exchange a stunned look with his friends, but to his surprise, they were already huddled together at the Gryffindor table. The letter lay flat on the table, surrounded by an opaque bubble as Hermione waved her wand over it again and again. Checking it for hexes, then: even though Malfoy had said it wasn’t cursed, Harry couldn’t blame Hermione at all for checking.
“I must say, this museum may not have been the best one with which to begin,” Draco drawled, following Potter around as he stared up at the art. “There seems to be very little organization or flow between the different galleries. And I have no clue what this piece is meant to represent.”
“You know, I’m ever so glad you decided to join me.” He smirked at Harry as he reached for the collar of his starched shirt. “Would you like to watch me disrobe, or would you prefer to turn and try to preserve my modesty? The former sounds far more entertaining...”
Draco had to admit it made sense. Of course the Boy Who Wouldn’t Die was his mate. He experienced an odd mélange of irritation and tranquility, but overall, he felt glad that it was Potter. He was strong, and smart, and had always driven Draco mad in the way only he could. And surely the Saviour of the wizarding world would be a very fitting trophy for a Malfoy’s arm. Yes, indeed, Draco could get used to that. But Draco could only relish the idea of Potter and his gorgeous eyes being his forever for a moment before Potter collapsed.
Joking, Draco. Unfurrow your brow before I have to come fix it for you. You’re much more handsome when you smile.
Ugh, he barely looked human anymore. Draco retreated back to his hastily-made nest to try to process what had just happened. He was still in one piece, even if that piece now looked very odd. And at least one part of the experience had been pleasant. He closed his eyes, trying to recall the voice he had heard, but he only felt something like a cool breeze as the presence left his mind. He sensed something sweet and sharp, like pastry and fire.
The music started, something slow and lush. Draco prowled out of his bedroom slowly, gracefully, like a big cat stalking its prey. And prey Harry was to be. Little had he known that the stockings were only the beginning. The lace kept going, up and up, until it ended in a delicate garter at the top of each thigh. Each garter was adorned with a tiny bow, one that begged Harry to rip it off with his teeth. Above the lace was a tight pair of high-waisted silk knickers. They hugged every mouth-watering curve of Draco’s body in a way that was surely illegal. The entire ensemble was capped off with a swirling emerald green robe, one that settled in satiny satisfaction around Draco’s body as he posed in the doorway.
Harry waited, but the house obviously didn’t want to cooperate. “Oh, fine. Here,” Harry said, pulling a clumsy bunch of white flowers from behind his back and thrusting them into Malfoy’s waiting hands. He’d clipped them with his wand and bound them together with his necktie; hopefully the gorgeous, intoxicating smell of them would convince the house they were a worthwhile gift.
Malfoy straightened up from his exaggerated pose and smirked gleefully. “Of course not, Potter. I wouldn’t dream of it.”
Harry inspected the enclosed piece of parchment: was it a Gringotts receipt? He hadn’t seen one in a while (since the goblins had insisted on banning him for life--annoying, that), but it looked vaguely familiar. The number of zeroes must have been a mistake. He was counting them a second time when Ron leaned over his shoulder.
” Gray eyes studied Harry. “Now that you’re satisfied...I must admit, I had an ulterior motive asking you here tonight.”
“Oh, the manor makes you a Quidditch pitch once and I’m stuck with you?” He laughed, and it was round and warm against Harry’s chest. “I
Harry was almost disappointed on Saturday when no ostentatious gift revealed itself at breakfast. Or at lunch, or at dinner. Could this mean Malfoy had given up on courting him?
It really was a gorgeous day, probably one of the last they’d have before winter tightened its grip on Scotland. A slight breeze ruffled the surface of the water, and the Whomping Willow cast its branches about far more gently than usual. Strange creatures called out from the Forbidden Forest, and the Hufflepuff team was practicing on the Quidditch pitch. It was exactly what Harry had imagined when he’d wished for a normal school year, but he never would’ve guessed that the friend by his side would be Draco Malfoy.
His wand flew from across the room as Draco summoned it and used it to produce lube. It smelled pleasantly of orange blossoms and honeysuckle as he coated his fingers with it and found Harry’s arse. One finger pressed slowly within, and Harry welcomed the slight pain of the intrusion. It spread and became a delightful burn as Draco worked Harry open. Another finger joined the first, but everything was going far too slowly for Harry’s taste. He could already feel himself growing hard again.
Hot fury flashed through Harry’s core. He batted Draco’s finger away from his mouth and glared. “Fine, if you say so. But you don’t want me to see my friends. I know you’re sensitive to the smell of anyone else on me, but it’s not like I’m not going to see them. Ron and Hermione are like family to me, and I love all of my other friends too.”
Harry lingered in the darkened forest clearing, taking in great gusts of the night air and listening to the faraway sounds of the party. It felt good to be alone for once.
Harry rolled his eyes good-naturedly, trying not to laugh at the vengeful look on Malfoy’s face as he considered destroying the karaoke machine. “‘M fine, thanks Malfoy.”
Between violent, ruinous kisses, Malfoy licked a long stripe up the side of Harry’s throat. A broken groan ripped from his mouth, as though Harry were the most rare and delicious taste in the world. Then Malfoy’s hips rolled sinfully against Harry’s, sending shock waves of sparking pleasure through his body.
Fearing what was to come next, Harry shut his eyes tightly. Surprise bloomed when the thumb moved and insistent lips pressed against his own. It was a fierce, desperate kiss, more that a beast than a man. A muffled
Draco seemed very satisfied by the full-body shiver that ran down Harry’s spine. “You’re staring at me like I’m an enraged veela in Lovegood’s absurd leonine hat. Come here, Harry. I don’t bite.”
“One could say that,” Malfoy smirked. “It was somewhat disgruntled by the actions my father had taken in the war and made me sleep in the kitchen until we came to an agreement.” Harry scribbled copious notes as Malfoy told him more about the manor’s preferences and idiosyncrasies. Eventually, he ran out of parchment, and all he could do was listen.
“Second, as I’m sure many of you will be delighted to learn, we will be hosting a Yule Ball this year. All students fourth year and above are extended an invitation, so please begin planning your dress appropriately. Finally,” she paused, waiting for the excited chatter about the ball to die down. “I would like to stress to each of you the importance of this school year. This year is our opportunity to come together as a school and build ourselves up stronger. You are not solely your family, or your house, and each of us makes our own choices. I will not tolerate any inter house bullying or strife from any of my students. I trust you will make myself, your families, and Hogwarts proud with your mature conduct this year.” Hermione nodded along with every beat of McGonagall’s speech. For once, Harry found himself wanting to do so as well. He’d never be best mates with any of the Slytherins, but he didn’t want any of the bickering or petty hexing that usually tinged the school year with irritation and regret. He knew he’d have to avoid Malfoy to make that happen (he always managed to get under Harry’s skin, even when he’d tried to behave), and was more than willing, despite the strange cuddling that Malfoy had forced on him. And speaking
The dragon had lain dormant for many years. Yet now, at the slightest sniff of Potter’s presence, it was fighting to reach the surface and reach for him. To claim him or kill him, Draco couldn’t be sure.
Luna nodded sagely (at least, as sagely as she could in her sunset orange robes and matching fascinator). “That’s how it keeps evil spirits away. Not quite as well as marigolds, you know, but they’re out of season. Maybe next year.”
With all the time you’re spending at the library, what else have you learned how to do on the computer? There’s lots of recipes, the Muggle news, social media, etc.
Malfoy huffed out a laugh. “All of Hogwarts learned that fourth year, Potter. I doubted you’d improved in the interim, particularly with your newfound academic interests. Come, I’ll help you. Just follow me.” He counted down again, and Harry let himself be swayed in Malfoy’s arms. Each step was fumbling and odd, but Harry grew more used to the motion. Soon Malfoy was guiding them about the room in wide, gentle circles. They danced through rainbows and sunlight and warm rays of Malfoy’s smile, and Harry wondered if he’d ever been this happy. Yet too quickly for his liking, the instruments slowed, and the song ended with one resolved chord that hummed through his bones. And a small click, as a grey marble door appeared in the far wall.
After dinner, Harry raced back up to his dorm room and tore the Marauders Map from his trunk. He scanned it for Draco’s name, sifting through the hundreds and hundreds of people in Hogwarts, and couldn’t find his little dot on the map at all. Had Draco left?
but the sheer sensation of Draco Malfoy resting against him in the most luxurious bubble bath ever drawn was far better than Harry could ever articulate.
Harry decided to come back later. His two best friends were obviously, er, working through something, and he didn’t care to be dragged into it.
The already enormous room must have been magically enlarged to fit everyone, as Harry couldn’t even glimpse the other end. Though the night was young, the dance floor was already dizzying with couples whirling about, in far brighter colors than the usual Hogwarts black. Most of the students were unfamiliar (Merlin, Hogwarts had changed), but Harry picked out a few recognizable faces in the crowd. Zabini twirled Parkinson and the heavy, sequined train of her dress effortlessly about the room, while a buttoned-up Goyle cringed as Millicent Bulstrode trod on his toes for what was surely the umpteenth time. Seamus was leading Dean in an exaggerated tango on the edge of the room, and Dean was laughing himself silly.
The next room was bright, bright, bright. It took Harry’s eyes a moment to adjust, but he was enchanted by what he saw. Early autumn sunlight slanted through the crystalline glass walls of a conservatory, illuminating beds overflowing with white blossoms. Perfume-heavy roses in blushing shades of pink and cream preened near the center of the garden, where an elaborate tea set shone on a small marble table.
Draco knew well the honor it was to take tea with his mother there every week. He breathed in with great pleasure as he crossed the threshold. The air was perpetually warm and humid (good for one’s skin and hair, as Narcissa insisted). Experimental breeds and carnivorous plants haunted the edges of the room. Poisonous oleander lurked in one sunny corner, luring unsuspecting visitors with its deadly white flowers. As one continued, the dangerous plants thinned, giving way to fiery bromeliads, hibiscus blossoms, and delicate clusters of orchids. An enormous magnolia tree stretched over all, like an arboreal guardian in tales of old. The center of the conservatory was a cloud of waxy jasmine bushes. Within these bushes lay Narcissa’s sanctuary. Draco relished the hints of fragrance they left on his skin and clothing as he stepped through the bushes to find his mother.
Have you tried Instagram yet? I have one. I’ve been going to the gym a lot, it’s helped me process a lot of things. People seem to like the pictures from my workouts. Anyway, my account handle is @hpotter, if you want to check it out. I’ve definitely changed since school, I’m sure you have too.
Harry halted at the end of the library corridor, in front of a surprisingly graphic tapestry of Ceridwen’s Cauldron. He really had no idea where to go next. He wandered around the castle for a few hours, and eventually ended up back in the eighth-year common room with Hermione.
