“I love you too” whispered Draco, terrified and thrilled at the same time by the four daunting words. He had never felt this vulnerable.
He whipped around in panic and his frantic eyes fell on a vague and sleepy form spread out on the old couch. Harry was fast asleep, sprawled out in a complicated position, his head resting on the arm of the sofa. His glasses were askew and he had obviously tried and given up mid-course to remove his brown Auror robes since one of his arms was still trapped inside the uniform. Mouth slightly open, his breathing was hoarse and a slight tremor was running in his tensed muscles. To complete the picture, one of his feet was dangling off the piece of furniture.
Ron’s eyes were so wide they could have rolled out of his sockets. Hermione looked like she had been turned into a statue, a look of horror on her face.
“Harry, relax, as much as I appreciate the sentiment, I’ll manage” he paused “I’m more surprised they want anything to do with me, if I’m honest. But I think a little chat with them was long overdue anyway.”
With a creaking noise, the door opened slowly and a slim figure slipped inside the dark room. Harry immediately tensed and raised his wand but the intruder didn’t seem to realize he wasn’t alone. There was something familiar about him. A glimpse of moonlight caught on a flash of platinum hair and Harry realised with a jolt who was standing there. The tall wizard closed the door and leaned against it, unaware of Harry's sitting with his back against the stone wall in the shadowy part of the office.
The elf had insisted only Draco was to be delivered his urgent message and refused to say any other word in Harry’s presence. But the Auror didn’t let go that easy. He quickly performed all the tests he could think of to ensure the elf hadn’t received the instruction to bring Draco back at the Manor and that he meant him no harm before letting him alone with the tall blond. A few minutes later, Draco got out of the study, alone, ashen-faced.
“It’s ok, I understand.” He paused, deep in thought. “I’ll try to completely ward-off the back garden, I know it’s not much but at least you’ll see some actual light.”
Somehow, what happened in the living room before seemed too private to be shared with him, even if Harry was inextricably linked with it.
With a simple firecall to pull a favour from a muggle-born engineer she was working with at the Department of Experimental Magic, they had the information they were looking for.
“Well, nothing this big, that’s for sure! We had our fair share of orgy-like stuff going on in Slytherin, granted, but compared to you…”
Harry tried not to laugh at his dishevelled state, he picked up the snake who coiled around his neck and shoulders.
The young woman who looks back in the mirror still looks a lot like him but after Hermione’s clever alterations, you really need to know it’s Harry. His eyes are blue for one and Hermione transfigured his old glasses in stylish rectangular black frames that make him look smart and bookish rather than like a 1970’s historian. The scar on his forehead is gone and he has mixed feelings about it.
“Jean, Jean Evans” Harry exclaims and takes Malfoy’s hand after a second too long. If he looks like a lunatic, Malfoy doesn’t comment, surely on account of his perfect pureblood manners.
Still, the worry is probably the worst part. After a few stood-ups that ended up in St Mungo’s waiting for a frazzled Healer to show up and say the words that would allow him to breathe properly again, Draco’s insides are now gripped in ice-cold coils when Harry is late or when an unexpected owl gets in.
Naturally, he hadn’t taken Harry and Ron’s influence from the War inside the Bureau very well and had tried by any means necessary to break them. The problem was, they had contested his strategies in meetings regarding the recent surge in Dark Arts activity, suggesting to tackle the problem at his source before it was too late instead of merely observing.
“Geez” whistled Draco. “So you were the brains of the operation then?” he eyed Hermione with praise.
“Yeah, yes” agrees Harry. They fumble their way through a pleasant bedroom with light tones. Draco lays Harry down on the covers and undresses him slowly, tenderly, kissing him lazily. Harry feels like he’s going to pass out from the frustration if it lasts any longer but he can’t seem to gather his wits enough time to say anything coherent. When Harry’s been divested from his shirt and trousers, he avidly drinks in the sight of Draco undressing until only his tight black pants are left. He’s stunning. The pale flesh is taut and compliments the slender frame beautifully. His movements are graceful and with his hair set alight by moonlight, he looks like an otherworldly creature, a fay stranded on earth.
The silver-blond finally notices the rigidity of his posture. Potter’s shoulder line is tense; his jaw clenched, chin tilted up in what looks like brazen challenge. His eyes though, tell the real story. He’s obviously feeling embarrassed about his body.
“Phew” said Malfoy elegantly, his hand batting coquettishly in front of his nose in a mock imitation of someone inconvenienced by smoke. Then a cruel smile stretched the thin lips and the grey eyes fell on Draco. In a fraction of second Harry, knew what was about to happen and jumped over the white unmoving body. The curse hit him in the leg, cutting through his flesh and muscles painfully and sending him bowling on the ground after he knocked down the sofa with the strength of his leap, his wand rolling away under a table. Draco was sprawled on his back beside him and a twitch agitated his biceps, his lips were almost blue. Harry grunted with pain, it felt like acid was burning everything and his blood was spilling everywhere, soaking the rug under him in seconds.
And here he was, thinking he was finally done with the save-the-world kind of jobs. A three-year reprieve and off you go. But it was more than that. There was a time when he would have been happy and excited to get up for work, no matter what. But Harry had trouble remembering the last time he didn’t groan or sigh when his alarm went off in the morning. And it wasn’t about conniving bosses, boring cases, bad shifts or overtime. When had he started to hate his job? When did everything start to feel this meaningless and foreign to him? Was this what he was supposed to look up to for the rest of his life?
“Shut up and fuck me, Potter” Malfoy cut him off with a voice like gravel and rocked his hips, turning Harry’s answer in a confused babble, the rush of pleasure turning him completely incoherent.
He should call Granger, she’ll know what to do with her mental case of a friend and Draco doesn’t see himself carrying Potter to St Mungo’s alone. He’s too heavy for one and Draco knows how powerful and erratic his magic is – he pushes down the thrill of desire that snakes through him at the memory of his wandless magic, it’s not the time for Christ’s sake!- and he will certainly abstain from getting himself on the receiving end of a magical rendition of the bombing of Nagasaki, thank you very much.
“She won’t have any permanent damage, she just needs to rest for a while and then she’ll be ‘as good as new’” he quoted sarcastically.
When he realized, much of the same was waiting for him at Grimmault Place, he almost considered not going back this night either. But then, his inner Gryffindor kicked-in. It was his fucking house after all and he wouldn’t give Draco the satisfaction. With a mixture of exhaustion and defiance, he walked home, letting the cold wind sweep away the stuffy atmosphere of his office. Immersed in his mutinous thoughts, he didn’t notice the cold splatter of rain that drenched him in a few minutes. When he opened the door, Harry was cold, resolute and completely soaked. A delicious smell tingled his nose and he frowned.
The pale blond shot him a small smile and it was the only answer Harry needed, he grinned back like a bloody idiot.
Hermione came back with a new drink, her smile was so bright and she looked so happy that he felt like his insides had melted a little bit. Maybe not drunk but a tipsy sappy mess for sure…
With a grunt, the Gryffindor changed his angle, trying to find the spot that would make Draco lose his mind. After a few attempts he finally found it and the white-blond bucked beneath him like a wild horse.
“In that case, I shall miss your impressive stamina and that scandalous filthy little thing you did earlier with your tongue” Draco purred while stretching languorously like a big white cat.
Harry is now growling like a feral beast, his strong and taut muscles rippling under the tanned skin.
Since they had amicably decided that getting back together would be a very bad idea after the War, he had nearly had a heart attack, then quickly body-bound the girl and questioned her. He is an Auror after all.
“So, eh mate, have you tried it? Ron asks with a distinct slur and a conspiratorial glint in his eyes Harry doesn’t quite like the look of.
“So instead I’m drinking Snape’s old reserve with Harry sodding Potter. I must be truly desperate” he sighed “Now pass me that bottle, will you?”
” said the strained and anxious recorded voice of Draco. There was the sound of a deep, fortifying sigh then:
Harry gropes around for his glasses, puts them on and jumps on his feet, completely freaking out. He rushes to the tiny bathroom adjourned to the bedroom and plants himself in front of the mirror to confirm what is already fairly obvious at this point.
After a moment, Harry seemed to cave in; he hugged her back tightly enough to hurt, burying his face in the fragrant mane of blond hair desperately, never wanting to let go.
He felt like the very ground under him had crumbled, leaving his world upside down. First there had been Snape’s death and his memories that had shed a new light on everything Harry thought he knew. He found out he was the true master of the Deathly Hallows and that he had to die. Then he saw Sirius, his parents, Remus. He could still see their silvery figures in the dark forest. Then he died. Saw Dumbledore. And came back.
Draco screamed so hard he felt something rip in his throat. A bubbly-rosy mix of blood and saliva coated the corner of his mouth.
Harry thrust harder, trying to ignore his own climax building around his spine like an implacable wave threatening to drown him.
“Bloody hell” Malfoy sighed, letting his head fall back against the wooden panel with a thud. He appeared to brace himself and went for the desk. Malfoy plopped down on the chair dispiritedly and rummaged through the drawers. He must have found what he was looking for because he let out a satisfied groan.
father. No wonder he acted the way he did when he was young. It’s terrible. It’s abusive and twisted and… barbaric!” she said in a disgusted tone.
“Adorjan, isn’t he awfully quiet, suddenly?” asked Lucius pleasantly to the short, stocky wizard holding a glinting serrated knife. “We wouldn’t want him to get bored or lose consciousness and miss the show, now would we?”
“But at least he was actually good at teaching! After all he had first-hand knowledge about the Dark Arts, you have to give him that…” answered Draco with an amused smirk, his arms crossed. Harry knew he was winding him up on purpose but he couldn’t resist.
“I’m close… I’m so close, please don’t stop, don’t stop, don’t…” he faltered as a devastating wave of pleasure rolled over him and shook his whole body with a strangled cry, cotaing their tangled body with hot semen.
“We’ll find him” she said resolutely, her vibrant tone strong enough to imprint her will on the fabric of fate. Or so she hoped.
“I’m really sorry, it won’t happen again” with a sharp intake of breath he added “Goodnight, Draco”. Then Harry was gone, leaving a confused and unbelievably turned on Draco, touching his swollen lips with shaking fingers.
When Malfoy positioned himself above Harry’s twitching cock and rested the soft patch of tender flesh on the tip, Harry was afraid he was going to come just from the touch and the sight. He closed his eyes and breathed in shakily, sucking air into his lungs desperately.
“Let’s hope my future offspring doesn’t suffer from similar shortcomings. I cannot wait to see what glorious progeny the Báthory blood will bring me. Yes, that’s right, now that your mother is dead, you’re bride will actually become mine”
The following weeks, Draco avoids him like the plague. If Harry wasn’t such a wreck about it, he would admire his skills, the man has pushed it to an art form at this point. His flat and office are warded against him (with spells so intricate and powerful –and not entirely legal- that maybe even Bill Weasley would have trouble breaking through) as well as his home and ministry floo addresses. All his letters come back unopened (even the official ones) and setting up camp in front of Draco’s office hasn’t worked even a tiny bit so far, but Harry stubbornly keeps it up.
To make matters worse, he has received an owl from Parson, telling him that he and Hermione finally cracked his case. Of course she has, she’s a bloody genius that one. Not even a dark curse etched into a antique obscure knife could resist her. He should be back in his own body in a few days according to them. Harry has been lying awake, clearly unable to know how he is feeling about it. And trying to figure out what he is going to do about those feelings once the curse is gone. When Hermione had showed up the following day, he had pretexted a nasty cold to avoid her. He isn’t anywhere ready to face her yet, she would figure him out in a split second.
No smell other than burnt toast was coming from the kitchen and no cup of tea or unfinished crossword was sitting on the workbench. He stepped in the living room and the sight of the red-golden snake coiled in the old armchair where Draco would curl up and read late in the night wrenched his guts.
Harry wrapped his strong arms around Draco’s torso and lifted him up like he weighed nothing in a cloud of spicy-woody scent. They looked at each other awkwardly, disturbingly close. There was nothing but a thin layer of fabric between them and Draco felt the warmth and firmness of the Auror’s body. Then Harry cleared his throat and averted his eyes. “Good to go?” he asked lightly and let him go progressively, still holding his arm.
Harry felt something suspiciously close to a frozen stone falling into his guts. He looked up from his drink, saw Hermione’s anxious eyes and steeled himself, trying to school his features.
But when he sees Harry’s face he instantly knows this one was bad. Not bone-crushing, flesh-wounding bad. The other kind. The one that make him wake-up screaming when it adds to the long collection of the best hits of the War.
They were sitting outside in the back garden, enjoying the warm June weather around an old wooden table. They had devoured the meal Harry made and were now getting slowly but steadily sloshed.
A slight tremor ran along the firm weight pressed against Harry’s front and a little whimpering noise escaped the blond. Already hard and breathless, the Gryffindor tightened his possessive arm around the narrow hips, his cock pressing against the fine pale arse. He stifled a groan, the over sensitive skin sending delightful electrical shocks in his whole body. Harry kissed the pale neck lazily and messily, grazing the warm skin. In a surge of rash boldness, Harry caressed the flat stomach, angular hipbones, traced the round form of Draco’s arse and slipped his trembling fingers between his cheeks, brushing the tender flesh, his heart beating hard.
Harry was already up in the air, looping and feinting as if gravity didn’t even bother him, whooping like a mad man.
“Well, boys, you have definitely outdone yourself this time” she grinned widely “Way to go, mates, that’s the best thing I’ve ever heard!” she burst out laughing and walked away in the other direction.
It isn’t anything like being on the field under Polyjuice or any other disguise; there he is always wary, constant vigilance and whatnot. With Draco, the problem is he isn’t wary at all. He is feeling more and more at ease, enjoying the friendly banter and the easy companionable silence when they are working together.
Harry stood in the dark kitchen for a while, rubbing his face and fighting the hollow feeling that had taken residence in his chest. He knew it wouldn’t be easy but he had hoped Ron and Hermione could at least try to understand. The tall dark-haired wizard sighed then nearly had a heart attack when the lights of the room suddenly switched on. He whipped around and his wand was out before he could help it, startling Draco in his smart light pyjamas.
He touched his forehead and Draco’s last conscious thought was how hot the tanned skin was against his, then everything went black.
“Yes, Draco.” he smiled encouragingly “Holding grudges benefits no one, Ron and Hermione see that. And they reckoned that if you didn’t kill me after a week living here with me, you definitely have changed!” Harry laughed goofily.
With a smirk, Draco mounted his broom and sped towards him in a smooth and elegant motion. The feeling of speed was amazing.
Harry laughed and embraced her familiarly. He scratched the snake’s chin affectionately and the scaled beast closed its eyes lazily.
Draco’s laugh burst out in the room before Harry’s discomfited expression. But he kissed him tenderly and murmured “Flattered.”
“Not exactly” he answered cryptically while holding her gaze. But some form of understanding seemed to pass between them.
When he woke up, Harry winced as a chorus of pain and chaotic thoughts collided in his skull. His eyes fluttered open and he recognized Sirius’ room around him. He was laying on the covers of the bed, still fully clothed, his wand nowhere to be seen.
“Thanks, Hermione, that was great.” Said Harry, sated by the huge dishes of Indian food she had cooked for them. The Dahl had been particularly good, hot and fragrant.
The months after the War were hectic. When Harry gave him his life back at the trials, he ran away from his mother’s emptiness, from his father’s toxicity, from the dark memories now embedded in the stones that had cradled his childhood and above all, from the all-consuming guilt choking him. He hid in Muggle London, free for the first time of his life to be anyone he wanted to be. He replaced his poisonous education with what he saw with his own eyes. There, he also lost himself in dim lighting; in loud music he didn’t understand but made him feel more alive than he had ever been; in cheap alcohol that didn’t smoke or fizzed or tickled; against the press of warm bodies who couldn't get enough of his pale flesh. He welcomed the burn then; looked for it, longed for it. He just wanted to feel, just feel and stop thinking. Stop thinking about the damage he had done and the feelings welling up inside him for the one person he could never have.
The Auror heard a violent rustling of sheets and tore from the door, his heart racing. Disturbed, Harry quickly hid in the bathroom. He undressed himself absently and stepped into the tub. As hot water flowed over his constricted muscles, he closed his eyes and was invaded by visions of a pale body clutching the sheets, his torso arched up in ecstasy. He was painfully hard and slammed his hands on the hard tiles in front of him, desperately trying to resist the urge to let go and grasp his sensitive flesh to quench the fire coiled around the base of his spine. But no matter how hard he tried to ignore it, he was way too aroused to resist any longer. Harry finally caved in and wrapped his rough hands around the throbbing length. With long and swift back and forth motions he brought himself closer and closer to his release, the tension building up, stifling his moans by biting his lips forcefully. He recalled the softness of Draco’s skin when he had traced his scar in this very bathroom. How would it feel like to touch him, caress him all over? To kiss those lips and lick his ivory flesh? At the idea of his tongue on the opalescent flesh, Harry climaxed. He came over and over with a strangled cry, his brains raked by waves of sharp pleasure.
“I normally don’t… go for women…” he starts and Harry’s heart sinks, humiliation and disappointment stinging more than he could imagine it would. He steps back and starts to stammer an apology but Draco grabs his arms and stops him. His touch burns him through the thin layer of clothes. The grey eyes search his and pierce through him again with that same impossible intensity.
After the first week, Harry is not ready to blow up his house but he would be happy to extend the courtesy to the Ministry and all the pillocks currently working inside it. Starting with his best friend.
“Go ahead, I’ll search the place and meet you at St Mungo’s” Harry said roughly, avoiding her stare.
“And you were the one teasing Jean about ‘unrequited love making people bitter’ or whatever, I can’t believe it!”
Luna flattened his hair back tenderly, tucking him deeper in the crook of her neck, she felt his hard breath, hot and humid against her skin. A surge of protectiveness rose inside her for this young man who had already seen too much and lost even more.
“Hum… Promise me not to freak out, okay?” he pleaded. Ron and Hermione looked at him with obvious puzzlement.
Harry smiled and kept at his ministrations. He felt warm hands roam over his ruined t-shirt, brushing his nipples and sending shivers raking everywhere on his overheated skin. The Gryffindor couldn’t help a loud gasp when Malfoy deftly rocked his hips, his hardness brushing Harry’s deliciously, sending sparks in his loins and flooding his brain with scalding-hot blood.
“Mr Potter, I’m begging you now, please save Draco. You already saved my life and I know I cannot ask more but I’ll do anything you want” she begged him and the desperate plea in her blue eyes wrenched at Harry’s guts.
Draco turned back and looked at Harry’s expectant face. He could see the hope and determination burning in him. The knot in his chest grew tighter.
Harry released his hair and arse and used clutched his shoulders from underneath so he could fuck him harder still and prevent Draco from slipping up the bed under his forceful thrusts.
“I didn’t tell anyone else! I would get fired if anyone heard about what I did” Harry bristled. What was Draco playing at?
“We may have sneaked in the Slytherin common room…” answered Hermione, a rosy blush creeping on her cheeks though Harry was persuaded it had more to do with the white wine than the actual embarrassment. “Well Ron and Harry did anyway, I had… a last minute technical difficulty...” Harry smiled at the memory.
“Exceptionally well, actually” smiled Harry “Hadn’t sleep that well in months! Maybe I should give up the bed and just sleep on that couch” he mused.
“Fucking hell, Draco…” Harry moans, desperately moving to match Draco’s rocking motions “You’re going to drive me fucking crazy…” he trails off, eyes shut tight, forehead wrinkled with tense lines.
“Bite me, I don’t answer to swines like you” said Harry fiercely and stormed out of the office, closely followed by a crimson Ron.
“Stop this. Now.” He said out loud firmly. “Get your shit together, you’re a bloody Auror for Fuck’s sake”
A moment later, Malfoy stands and shrugs off his blouse. He’s wearing a grey waistcoat and trousers and seeing Malfoy in a Muggle suit is all kinds of weird. His crisp white shirt is impeccably pressed with the sleeves rolled above the elbows.
“Sod off! Not everyone’s lucky enough to shack up with his best friend, you tosser” says Harry and gives his shoulder a playful shove that makes him stumble.
When the Gryffindor starts to grind his hips against Draco’s, his pace picks up again, he’s already painfully hard and straining against his restricting work robes.
“… but there’s something about you, Jean… and it’s driving me mad” he whispers. He releases Harry’s arm but doesn’t let go of him, instead Draco starts tracing his fingers on his arm, then shoulder and back.
He felt his own climax rise and rise and rise as the tight ring constricted erratically around his hard flesh.
Draco bent over the Auror to get the two plates, engulfing Harry in a warm, citrusy scent. He busied himself on the stove and a minute later, an outrageously nice-smelling steaming plate was in front of Harry. Draco took the opposite chair and poured red wine in the stemmed glasses Harry hadn’t seen since Luna moved out.
“So, about that drink? Are you gonna take it or you’re planning to keep looking at me like I’m the Bloody Baron?” He smiled indulgently and held the glass closer.
His hair looks the same though maybe a bit silkier; they are still short, spiky and messy. Harry feels a tinge of contentment at the thought that even Hermione couldn’t tame them with her magic. Like when he was a child, they instantly went back to their previous form when she tried to make them grow longer. The Auror feels lucky he doesn't have to handle long hair on top of everything else. He suspects it would have been a treat on its own.
When he opened the door though, all traces of mirth left his face. A House elf was looking at him in wild terror, his big blue eyes and huge ears protruding from his stricken face. He was also wounded, purple bruises marring his waxy flesh.
“A book Luna gave me, from a famous muggle writer called Stephen King. It’s called the Dark Tower” said Draco distractedly.
“Well spotted. Though it is quite common knowledge that I was” he says with a tight smile that doesn’t quite reach his eyes.
Draco’s hips start pumping in and out slowly, a storm of sensations raking his whole body. He loses himself in the tight channel welcoming him in a searing embrace at each thrust.
Harry was lost in his thoughts after a particularly gruelling day at work. He was in the kitchen, cutting vegetables for a Shepherd’s pie with an Indian twist and reflecting about his life while Draco was elegantly perched on the workbench doing crosswords.
When the song was over and the cake on the table, Draco blew the candles under the crowd’s loud demands and everyone erupted in loud claps and cheers. Harry clapped on Draco’s back and his strong hand lingered a few seconds more before going away.
“Yes, um no, I don’t know. He’s gone and…” Harry shook himself “I’m sorry, I’ve been all over the place. I think he went to meet his mother somewhere… She escaped and Lucius is after her. Do you have any idea where he or she might be?” he asked, a stupid surge of hope flaring inside him.
Harry nods, not really trusting his voice at the moment. His apprehension comes back. It cannot be that far from bottoming though, he reasons, but it’s not like he did that many times. Apart from a bit of playing with toys, no one ever breached him. Then again he never breached anyone either. Draco must have picked up on the turn in his thoughts because he says:
“You don’t have to prepare for anything. I won’t change my mind just because it gets complicated. You have my word.”
In the morning, when grey ray of lights started to lay their delicate envelope on London, Harry finally gave up on sleep. He had woken up a few hours earlier with a throat raw from screaming and his head throbbing in pain. He finally climbed down the stairs to get to the bathroom and take a shower. The Auror paused on the landing, all senses in alert. He was pretty sure he had heard something.
“Yes, he’s just over here” she said and moved aside to reveal the white-haired man -two feet behind her- whose wounds were being tended to by another Auror, the one Harry had almost scared to death back at St Mungo’s. “Joey here is tending to his wounds. Impressive and nasty but non-magic, he should be all right”.
When they got back in the kitchen, Luna was curled up in a seat near the fireplace, her knees pulled up against her chest. She was cuddling with the red and gold snake and they both gazed at them with a look so eerily similar it made Draco uncomfortable.
The door opened, and he opened his mouth to speak, but the door was slammed shut before he could mutter a word. He scratched at the back of his head.
Harry rubbed a hand over his face and pushed his crooked glasses back up his nose, "I'm sorry. I'll repay you, somehow. It is just– I have been so focused on this case, it's haunting my dreams as well, ugh. I hadn't had a wink of sleep this week."
. Because, all I do in my free time is mess up with unstable Time Turners and see if I can destroy time itself," he sneered. "In case you had not noticed, Potter, I am an Unspeakable. It is my job to study Time Turners. And, it has been for
“You know I’m against wasting food. But, right now, I’m so tempted to give up my breakfast to let it collide with your face.”
“I did,” Harry laughed and Ron stared at him as if wondering whether he should ask someone to send Harry to St. Mungo’s.
“Didi is sorry, but Didi was told to slam the door into Harry Potter’s face whenever Harry Potter knocks. Didi politely asks Harry Potter Sir to move his foot and stop blocking the door, so Didi can slam the door into his face.”
and hummed, “I think it changes every five hours or so,” he said then tipped his head at her, “what are you doing?”
Harry sighed, slumping down his chair. He’d always hated this part of his job. No matter what role he played during the interrogation. “Yes,” he told the Auror again, “he came to my office. He dragged me to the Department Of Mystery and lead me into that room. We started arguing and the Time Turner exploded.”
He stepped into his cubicle and took off his robes, shoulders relaxing at the avoided trouble. He was about to sit on his chair when someone cleared their throat, making Harry jump out of his skin.
reaching the restaurant, you mean,” Ron leaned back. “Are we still going to the Leaky with the others? I’m not sure I’m ready to hear a drunken Harry Potter mooning over Draco Malfoy all night — him of all people, seriously, mate?”
“Harry!” she chided, “it’s not a diary — okay, it probably is — but it’s still evidence too,” she said, trying and failing to hide a smile, “and you’re an Auror, be professional.”
“Oh,” Harry blinked, surprised, “thank you.” He tilted his head when Hermione set a small paper bag on his desk. He peered inside the bag and smiled up at her at the sight of a delicious looking treacle tart set neatly inside. “How’s your research going?” he said as he fished out the treacle tart and peered inside the, now empty, bag again. He didn’t know why, but he expected to find a few chocolate biscuits in there too and, for some reason, his stomach dropped when he found none. Odd.
Harry felt a weight settle heavily inside him. The Auror’s words echoed inside his mind and it filled him with rage and indignation. Because he was Harry Potter, the Saviour of all Wizarding World. The one who had stood in
I apologies for all those who wanted to comment and thought I'd just ignored them. I'm just an idiot. Feel free to comment and tell me what you think, don't mind me and my oddness.
He’d been surprised to find his team’s reports inside Malfoy’s office too, but the bitterness that came after was directed to the fact that, if only they worked together in person everything would have been so much
They had found a spot on the grass next to a tree, Harry laying against the tree and Draco sitting not far from him, laughing and cooing at their new pet. The puppy, so small and fluffy, was rolling on the grass and climbing over Draco’s legs to stick his little snout inside the sleeve of his shirt.
“Of course I was. And flattery will get you nowhere, Harry,” she laughed before standing and heading to the door. “I’ll owl you later, I think I might be onto something.”
Draco sighed, turning to face him and leaning his side against the counter, "alright, what is it?" he quirked an eyebrow at him, arms folding across his chest. Just a moment later, Harry watched Draco blink, open his mouth then close it again, confused and speechless, as he gawked at Harry's hands, "What is
“We think it belonged to him. It looks like some kind of journal, where he kept all his findings about his research and such.”
The last part was said in a mere whisper, and Harry was not sure if he was meant to hear that, so he just chose to ignore it instead, "What are you talking about, Malfoy?"
Honestly, people should just mind their own business. There was no need for them to gawk at him at every little misstep he did. Admittedly, it was not the first time he had come rushing through the Ministry like that. But the case he had been working on that week was taking a toll on his sleeping habits. And Harry couldn't possibly be blamed if he had overslept because of it. For a brief moment he wondered when was the last time he had a proper night sleep.
). but, in none of Malfoy’s reports — unlike in his journal — he had mentioned a Time Turner. Not the one Harry had seen in his office, at least. Not the one who had blown up and shoved a new problem into Harry’s face without his permission. Why did his life always have to be so complicated?
“Didi now only opens the door to smile at me, before slamming it back shut,” Harry sighed as he slumped on his chair. He’d never imagined trying to talk to someone might be this tiring.
Harry tucked his quill behind his ear and stretched his arms over his head, sighing as he let his irritation leave his body alongside all the stiffness gripping at his muscles. This was why he’d decided to refuse any promotions, if and when they ever came. He had joined the Aurors to be on the field, not behind a desk all day. After the war, he’d thought to give himself time to heal, both body and mind, but he hadn’t lasted long before he’d sought something that could help him feel the adrenaline, he’d come so used to have buzzing deep inside his veins. And being an Auror gave him just that. The anticipation that hit him just minutes before heading out into his next mission, the satisfaction of stopping mad and dangerous (or dangerously mad) people and the peace of mind that came with knowing he’d been helpful somehow.
“As much as I hate to say it, ‘Mione might be right. Mate, Malfoy would choose torture over asking for your help.”
Harry moved his attention to the cabinet, it too made of wood and carrying stubborn, harsh reminders of the accident. When he pulled it open, he found it filled with books and reports, all carefully set in a clean looking order. Harry skimmed through the reports, unsure of how much he was authorized to see and read. This was the collection of an Unspeakable, after all. Secrecy was their strongest — if not only, Harry mused — rule.
The Auror shrugged a shoulder, "I've got to sound professional, don't I?" she winked. With that, she bid Harry goodbye and they left.
Ron grinned and threw the paper ball back at Harry, “I’m sorry, I’m just enjoying the fact that I wasn’t the one to be assigned to ‘The Malfoy Headache.’”
Draco cleared his throat, face pink both in appreciation at the sight and embarrassment at his lover's words, "it's your fault you took him home. Now, get up and face the consequences." And with that he stood to stretch and prepare for the day. He walked to the wardrobe, ignoring Harry's burning stare at the back of his equally bare back.
He straightened his back, plastered his best smile on his face and raised his hand to knock at the door. He waited, rocking on the balls of his feet as he fidgeted. He went over the speech he prepared the day before — after his first failed attempt at socialization — and ran a nervous hand through his messy hair. Why did speaking to people make him feel so awkward?
After the death of her husband in Azkaban, Narcissa Malfoy had not exactly been in her right mind, so Harry supposed that Mrs Malfoy’s protective behavior over her son might have been understandable.  Harry didn’t wish to make her life any more stressful than it already was. Lucius Malfoy had been the one bringing their family to ruins, not her, not even her son. So, after speaking to their trial, Harry had done all he could to stay out of the Malfoys life. He’d moved on and he only expected them to do the same. Presenting himself at their doorstep in full Aurors robe hadn’t been the smartest way to make good first impression after so long.
"That face you're making," Draco answered, waving Harry's general direction with a distracted hand, "it always means trouble."
“And, of course, he cursed and blamed me a lot for some reason,” Harry shrugged, “before the accident, I haven’t even talk to him properly since the trial. I don’t know why he’d have to blame
“How surprising,” Hermione said sounding amused, then smiled innocently when Harry rolled his eyes at her. “Did he even write anything specific about what he blamed you for?”
Harry scratched the back of his head as he thought, “honestly, he just sounded really bitter, about how monotone and repetitive his mornings had turned to.”
Harry groaned. It had been such a long day, he was so not ready to have this conversation with Ron, or with anyone, really.
Now, with his full attention to the weird shapes, Harry watched as their ink moved, seemingly eager to spread itself through the blank pages. Hesitant, Harry reached over and ran a tentative finger onto the page, only to watch bewildered as the ink began following his touch. It was an odd — somewhat disturbing, somehow
He slowed his pace, scanned the hallway and smoothed a hand down his robes. Then, with a final brush of his hand through his hair, he marched towards his desk, hoping everyone – mostly Robards – was too busy to realize he had been missing till now.
“Would it be inappropriate to ask you,” he said after he took his first sip, “If you slept well last night?”
Rose claps her hands and manages to surprise herself with this great achievement. Harry coos at her for a little before giving her back to Ron, who boops her little nose with one finger. They chat for a while longer, about work and how the new schedule works out for Ron. Harry shares a couple of funny stories about the ladies that come in his shop with questionable books in need of repair.
The twinkling stars on the cover Harry leaves with the touch of age and care that must have been left by the owner of the diary. It speaks of use and of the love that has been entangled in the words left on the pages, could be felt when Harry weaved the handwriting back into what it was before the damage.
“Hey, mate! I brought lunch! Merlin’s balls, though, eating here with that supervisor of yours was damn
the spells, the one that protects the text from strangers included.” Harry rubs at the back of his neck, slightly uncomfortable. “Some people know it might happen, some don’t, so I prefer to let the owners know either way.”
Draco swallows and his Adam’s apple bobs. He’s still pale, though the shadows playing on his skin and the white shine of his hair make the wizard seem sickly. There is something fragile to Draco. It’s in the way his shoulders stay tensed up, the immaculate posturing, the lips that have been bitten a painful red.
Draco ruffles Harry hair before sitting down. He is careful with the takeout boxes, still somewhat unsure about the texture of them. “How is Granger and the Grangerling?”
An ancient Malfoy elder from one of the paintings nods along. He doesn’t say anything, but does give Harry a judging once-over before gliding out of the frame and leaving only an empty background behind.
Somewhere in the middle of the ride Draco’s hand settles on Harry thighs and squeezes every time there is a sharp curve, a sudden drop or rise.
Harry doesn’t know when his hand has moved to clutch unto the flawlessly ironed dress shirt Draco had chosen to wear. “Does that mean you’ll keep on kissing me?”
The kiss is hungry and wild, all teeth and no class. It’s dirty, with saliva dripping down one side of Harry’s face. Draco pulls back just enough to then kiss over the faded spiderweb scar that used to be a lightning bolt, a symbol of the impossible and a mark of damnation, no worse than the dark mark.
Harry takes off his glasses and busies his hands with cleaning them. “The, uh, about the time when I was on a run after and before escaping from your, I mean, the manor. Parts from fifth and sixth years, as those were the most damaged and I had to make sure the text didn’t scramble up.”
It doesn’t matter if the other wizard reads it, matters less if there is a reply to it. To Harry what matters most is that he has put his forgiveness onto paper, made it physical and real and sent it away. He was being true when he told Draco that is has been years since they were on different sides of the war, or so it seemed to them at the time, and he has forgotten, forgiven, moved on. But some things need to be told more specifically, with more than just a vague statement.
Harry places the journal on the desk where all the complete projects wait for their owners. He takes a template and fills it in to let Draco know that he can come and get it back. The black owl that takes the note away hoots softly before taking flight.
. I knew both of your parents through their awkward flirting and crushing phases, I do recognize them in you enough to notice these things. And teenagers are not as smooth as they think they are.” Remus taps his nose once.
The man’s fingers are slender and shake slightly when he retrieves the leather-bound book. It looks burned, the cover and page corners curled up into themselves. Draco handles it gently, carefully he lays it before Harry on the desk that has the bookkeeping journal and an old cash register on it.
“Yeah, I thought he’d either walk out or get someone from the main office.” Harry glances at the book that he has yet to even start properly working on. “Seemed very, don’t know, glum, I s’pose.”
Ariel looked down at her hands, the steam from her cup wafting against her forehead as she searched through the words she wanted to say next.
She looked over her shoulder. Out from the kitchen strolled Voldemort and timid-as-ever-looking Draco. "You were trying to scare me?"
Embarrassed beyond recognition, it was all he could do to allow his mother to drag him away from the line and scold him under her breath, "I told you to get rid of that thing before you left…"
Then Draco, prodigal son, had returned and for a few days the dour Malfoy Manor was teeming with holiday cheer and the Malfoys tricked themselves into thinking Draco would be spared the Dark Lord's wrath.
"Oh, that reminds me," Voldemort said abruptly, taking a stand for the first time since the ass-kissing began. "I must borrow you for a moment, Severus." To Ariel, he explained, "It's Nagini's feeding time and I promised Severus last time he could feed her."
Of course, no matter how many families he decimated; no matter how many lives he stomped out with a wave of his wand; no matter how much rage he poured into those killing curses; none of that assuaged the stabbing pain in his head or the implosive fear in his heart that told him he had lost Ariel for good.
Voldemort scooped himself a generous spoonful of sugar stealing a surreptitious glance or two at his guest as he stirred his tea. Ariel snapped out of her reverie long enough to catch one of his jackal-like grins.
She dropped her gaze to her tail, which twitched mindlessly in the mud, then raised it back to Snape who had slipped into a silence she couldn't read.
Voldemort wilted in his seat, looking mildly disappointed but unsurprised. “I know.” He said. He lifted his lips and forced out a smile. “And I respect your… (sigh) moral objections.”
The walk from Draco's bedroom to the kitchen felt like an endless death march. It was all she could do not to sob the entire way, least her cries encourage the Dark Lord's callousness. Draco made no pretenses to hide his fears either which is when Narcissa took to the Dark Lord he squeezed her hand the entire way.
He expected Draco to glare at him, berate him, even take out his wand and hex him, which is why Harry kept his free hand in his coat pocket, waiting, ready for the kinetic promise of violence to explode between them. But Draco did none of these things. Instead, he shrugged and turned his attention back to his glass. Harry watched him go to take a sip but stop when he noticed, in utter disgust, a hair swirling around the bubbly amber filled glass.
"What's more important?" The young man asked, leaning closer, his eyes still narrowed on the emotional child. "Being the greatest wizard who ever lived, becoming a literal God, or being mediocre and happy?"
She rushed to the gate, trailed by Snape. By the time he reached her side, she had her head bent into her hands, shoulders shaking as she let out a tiny, peep of a cry.
He didn't know where that question came from for it did not come from a place of remorse or even a niggling of regret. To him, the atrocities, the murders, the various crimes he committed or had others commit on his behalf, were all a part of this life he made for himself. But he knew what he was. At best, a soulless wretch. At worst, a monster. So, he needed to know, could she accept him? Or was she like his inner child, clinging desperately to a false memory?
"Be safe." He echoed with a snort. Ariel had stepped into the circle when he grabbed her by the arm, raised it triumphantly, and decried to the near-empty beach, "As if anything in this realm could stand a chance against us!"
It started off an idle, mundane day for Lord Voldemort. Such as it happens during war. Not every day's going to be all meetings murder and mayhem. Even Voldemort had do-nothing days.
It was then that Ariel caught a whiff of something sweet and pungent. Something she'd never smelled before.
"Might as well." He panted with a laugh. "You already told me you killed your husband and sold your soul."
"Ah," Bellatrix said, giving her sister a knowing smile before she turned her attention to Ariel and said, "You know, Ariel, I almost forgot to congratulate you on your potion maker's publication."
He watched her eyes, waiting for them to change into loathsome pity but they never did. Ariel's eyes remained bright and welcoming as when he told her his name.
Even as he laid there and watch the woman of his dreams bounce on top of his cock until her eyes rolled in the back of her eyes and her melodic voice cried out his name, Snape couldn't believe this was real.
The Malfoys eventually made it to the kitchen where they overheard the last bit of a story Ariel was telling:
"I'll take that as a yes." She said with amusement. "C'mon. Take a break. I was just about to make lunch."
"Disagree," Harry stated. He was still glaring at the entranceway. Only his mind was racing. He looked to his friends and said, "You guys go ahead."
Ariel looked at him, her eyes moving slowly over his impassive face before she settled on a reply, "More than anything."
"Oh, yeah," Ariel said as she pushed herself to her feet. She walked over to Bellatrix to refill her cup, saying as the witch poured the bottle, "I actually had to help break out the same friend." She laughed when she raised the cup to her purpled lips and explained, "He got caught summoning the Kraken. Again." She shook her head after she took her sip. "I told that idiot not to but you know how hard-headed pirates can be."
Snape clinked his glass into Draco’s and said with an impassive face and wet eyes, “To Ariel, may she rest in power.” With that, the two of them took a giant swig from their glass and lapsed back into unbearable silence.
Snape's throat went dry. He forced his gaze to her beautiful face, feeling his pants grow tighter the harder he fought to keep his eyes from diverting down to the rest of her body. "You're truly welcome." He murmured.
"Oh, sweetheart, you don't have to call me that. Ariel is just fine." His chest tightened under Voldemort's smoldering stare, which told him, try and I'll throw you out the first window I see.
"That's great," Ariel said encouragingly. "That's the one thing you need most in life: courage. That and a good friend group. Do you have any friends back at the orphanage?"
Voldemort listened to her with the brightest, widest-smile on his disfigured face. "The fact that you know of my accomplishments means the world to me." He said. "I am…so thrilled that you are alive to see what I have become. When we met, I was nothing. A little nobody with nothing. No family, no skills, no focus, no purpose. But then you—you came into my life and you inspired me! You made me into the person I am today. Ariel, you're my origin story."
After a few more rides Harry buys himself some cotton candy, which Draco accepts small bites from with a suspicious glance at the fluffy sweet. They walk around enjoying the atmosphere, watch the teenagers having the time of their lives and older couples enjoying themselves with the slightly rigged prize games. Draco talks more about what had gone after his father’s passing while Harry opens up about his slowly growing dislike towards some parts of the wizarding world.
it. Though, even without his help everything seems to be working out nicely enough. Hermione even let Draco hold Rose for a little while, was even more amused when the little girl puked all over Draco.
Once Harry had thought the most of Dumbledore, had respected the old wizard in a way that Harry had never respected anyone else. Now, these days, when Harry has too much time to think and too much jaded edges moving inside of him, he can finally admit that his respect has morphed into anger. Into a hate of kinds, maybe even childish in some ways.
Harry snorts at the narrow-eyed stare that Ron sends Draco’s way, but doesn’t get in the middle. The slowly building friendship between his friends and Draco is not something that Harry wants to get in-between of, or influence in any way. It won’t be the same if he makes or
“No need to apologize, Mr. Potter. I was also just making sure.” Levante’s lips almost pull into a smile. She then picks one book out of the pile that need to be sorted out and hands it to Harry. “This one will be easy, but I want to see how you will take care of it.”
Kreacher grumbles some more, but then disappears to get Harry’s work clothes ready. Harry eats his sandwiches and watches the morning light dance across his windows, the tiny flares that twinkle across the kitchen ceiling when the light hits something shiny and reflective. Maybe better days are coming.
When evening settles in Harry walks into the dining room wearing only a long, button-down shirt of Draco’s and nothing else. Draco can’t seem to look away from his legs.
“Even with that, yes.” Harry feels sad, just so very sad. “And I doubt that you let it be put on, not when you had that monster living in your home.”
“Hey, Malfoy, wanna go on a date?” Harry breathes in the wind. Perhaps the best way is the simplest way to go.
“Master Harry is be writing a lot this evening.” Kreacher notes as he floats another cup of tea by Harry’s elbow.
Harry carefully leafs through yet another book, this one an order from the ministry, checking the page numbers to make sure they don’t skip and play around where they shouldn’t be. The book had some major spell damage, a strange backlash as a result of experiments gone awry. Harry did not ask for details. He remembers Department of Mysteries too well, knows that whatever goes down there it’s better to not know.
The old house elf does not look as amused as Harry feels for talking back. Soon the fireplace is crackling with fire, the room illuminated only by the flames that jump about the fireplace. Harry loses himself into the monotony of watching the orange and yellow intertwining again and again, head pleasantly empty for once. He’s tired, still so very tired.
The old man huffs as he drops the letter before Harry and pats his back. “Damned stairs and cobblestone. I got my summons for the book I gave to you people a while back. Couldn’t come sooner, my bossy daughter in law put me on bedrest. I survived until now, a bloody flu won’t be killing me anytime soon.”
Tonks snorts hard enough to choke on her sandwich. “In a couple of years maybe, but I’ll keep that offer in mind. Gonna squeeze you out of your savior money.”
Mr. Granger nods very solemnly from Ron’s side. “I remember when Mary had you, she broke my fingers during the birth. You got away pretty scot free, son.” He squints his eyes at Ron’s black eye critically. “Wish I had some of your potions at that time, though.”
When Harry starts work on the pages themselves, one by one, he tries not to read what he now realizes are Draco’s most personal thoughts, the feelings the other wizard had gone through during school. When the times were good, from what Harry can tell, the echo of the feelings that the journal had preserved are happy and light, but the further down the journal that Harry goes the darker and more negative they get.
Something not quite like hesitation flashes over Draco’s face. Maybe fear. The man swallows, clears his throat. “I, uh, we… Have yet to talk about it?”
Harry is still tired. Tired of old, schooltime spats started by childish jealousy and foolish pride. He had forgiven Draco a long time ago. So, he simply smiles politely, the way sellers and shopkeepers smile when they greet a new customer. “Hello, Malfoy. How can I help you? If it’s about a request that has been made a while back, I will need the case number to check if it’s already done or not.”
Hermione simply grins. “I’m good. I’m still on pain medication, so I don’t feel anything, but I’m pretty sure everything down from my hips is a war zone. I think Ron let Molly know, but better safe than sorry.”
The clock dings seven and Kreacher finds him curled up by the dining table, the mug empty of tea and dark bags under his eyes. The house elf sighs long-suffering and sets about to make breakfast. Harry finds amusement in the indistinguishable mumblings of the old elf, relaxes under the shifty, judging glares that Kreacher sends him from time to time.
.” He lights up a few of them, then waves his wand in the same pattern that Professor Flitwick taught him during his first year, the movement now a muscle memory, “
Harry blinks in time with the jingle of the bell. The world outside of the shop moves on in a colorful blur, though Draco seems the only thing that is sort of outside of it. Like the wizard doesn’t belong, or maybe doesn’t
Harry has by now become rather knowledgeable in the ways of women thanks to both Hermione and Ginny, so neither the sight nor information given to him are anything new. “Potions don’t work?”
Hermione is quiet. With age and everything that they have lived though she has thawed out the need to know and ask a million questions, sometimes. Right now she just sits back and listens, content to let Harry work out the tiny details, the words that not always come out right.
And, that was all he found. Harry left the reports on his desk before leaving to go home, feeling at a loss. He had been sure Malfoy had additional findings that could help him somehow. And, well, he
. I couldn't leave him there!" he reasoned. He smiled and bent forward to peck Draco on the lips, "I love you, and I know he already loves you too," he said, plucking the puppy in Draco’s arms and grinning when the other wordlessly cradled the small ball of fluff in his hands without a word, hard expression melting and smile tugging at the corners of his lips.
Harry heard the Auror standing by the door snort at the mention of Harry’s argument with Malfoy, but he ignored him. Since the start, the man had done little to nothing to hide his annoyance for being assigned to Malfoy’s case. He’d gone as far as hinting that Harry may have done something to the blonde, saying
Harry raised his head and found Hermione smiling down at him. “’Mione?” Harry said, hiding the paper with the dragon doodle before his friend could see it.
Later that morning, Harry found himself hunched over a piece of parchment, as he scribbled down (once again) all details he knew about the case, when his door burst open, giving him quite the scare.
Luckily for Harry, the Auror sitting across from him knew how to be decent at her job and promptly ignored her colleague. Harry was glad to have her in charge of the questioning. He didn’t know what he would have done if it was the man interrogating him.
(other than reading boring stuff, of course). He wasn’t sure if whatever he was scribbling on was important, but at the moment he couldn’t really bring himself to care, he was just pretending to be working, anyway.
Ron hummed, "yeah. Feels like we have been missing something," he said as he passed a cup of coffee to Harry.
Harry spun on his feet, ready to glare at the other. He was so done with whatever this was. Harry had no time for Malfoy’s silly little games. Ron would kill him, if he found him missing from his office again. If Robards didn't do it first. Either Malfoy went straight to the point – like right in that
— had turned out useful. From what Harry had gathered, Malfoy had worked on many of the artifacts Harry and his team brought back from their mission. Heavy, twisted magic swirled inside them, making it almost impossible for the Aurors to stand by them without feeling sick. Harry still remembered the
"Why not?" Harry said, stepping closer to peer over Draco’s shoulder and see what the man was cooking.
“Why aren’t you despairing over my troubles? I thought we were best friends!” Harry pouted and threw a crumbled paper sheet at the other.
His friends had been right, it seemed. The book was a detailed description of a researcher’s findings. Harry leaned back again pushing the journal away with a grimace. All he'd just read sounded too similar to the reports he'd been working on for the last week. His mind was not ready to jump back into desk work. Just the thought sent jolts of familiar pain down his back, cause by the hunched position he'd been for too many hours to be healthy. He stood, changed and went to sleep. Who cared if it was still five in the afternoon? Certainly not him.
Harry reached for his wand, ready to cast a cleaning spell, but ended up squawking instead, when Malfoy all but caught him by the wrist and began dragging him out of his office. "I don't have time for this, Potter," the man had the audacity to groan in frustration when Harry tried to protest and pull himself free.
Harry stepped closer to the desk and scanned it. There was a single, large stain, burned into it by the Time Turner. No one had been able to spell it away. He brushed his fingers over it, feeling the rough mark contrasting with the shiny, clean wood of the desk. His fingers twitched, ready to wrap around his wand to try and spell the ugly texture off the smooth surface.
. Magic poured out of it in strong waves, and Harry could not explain how he had not noticed it the moment he stepped into the room. Heck, he guess he could have felt it even from the moment he had stepped out of the lift. "What have you done?" Harry all but demanded, pinning Malfoy with another accusing glare, "a
“Been talking about him since we set foot inside the restaurant,” Hermione sigh, raising her glass to hide the tiny little smile spread over her lips.
Harry pushed aside whatever papers he had left on his desk, making room for the stack he’d brought with him from Malfoy’s office. He sat on the chair and immediately took out his quill and notes, before he began reading.
Harry almost tripped on his own robes as he hastily made his way towards the lift. He huffed out a breath as its doors closed behind him and pointedly ignored the looks, he was receiving as the lift made its way down. He jumped out without waiting for the doors to open completely and rushed his way down the hall and towards his office, still feeling eyes boring a hole on the back of his head.
Harry opened his mouth, ready to tell Malfoy, how he couldn't be that good at his job, given how the Time Turner seemed ready to blow up and take them all with it, but he was cut off when Malfoy caught him by the wrist and, before he could register it, he was being thrown out of the room as the door shut behind him.
– or Harry was out of there. "Listen here, Malfoy. I don't know what exactly you're playing at but, frankly, I have no intention to take any part of it." he said, stabbing an accusing finger at the man, "so, you better get on with it."
“Honestly? I don’t really know how to feel,” Hermione sighed as she perched herself on his desk, “his work is brilliant. All—”
, shifting ever so slightly, so subtly Harry had missed it all the previous times he’d glanced at those corners.
fault, if I was assigned to it,” he sniffed and began squashing the potato with his fork. “if you hadn’t given me that cursed journal, I wouldn’t be—”
Harry had gone to Ron, after finding the folders inside Malfoy’s office, and showed him all Malfoy had found about the warehouse and the Cursed objects. Now all Aurors working on that case had a copy of the Unspeakable’s folders; if only they knew the name behind all those researches. It left a bitter taste into Harry’s mouth, because, maybe that’s why not even he had been told about Malfoy, maybe they feared that even he would turn to prejudice over logic — or, maybe it was simply their reputation of not standing each other? Harry wasn't sure how to feel about that; it sounded embarrassingly childish.
“No, seriously, mate. You have spent zero time with him since this whole mess had started. Not even when he was back — for obvious reasons — and yet, here you are, grossly smitten and so obviously desperate.” He said, looking Harry over. “Tell your best friend the truth. Maybe I can get someone to break this curse of yours.”
Questions began swirling through his mind, as on why would Malfoy possibly have the reports of that particular mission. Until he noticed the list, written after the short description of said mission. Harry took the reports with him, sending the rest of the folder back to its place inside the cabinet. He had some additional reading to do.
Draco pouted, glanced out the window then turned to Harry again, "well," he said, poking the tips of his pointer fingers together, "uhm, around... six in the morning?"
When he picked the cursed book up again, cautious and wary, he had his wand clenched in his hand as he stuck his finger into his mouth to sooth the pain,
Now alone, Harry closed the journal and turned it this way and that. He didn’t know how he felt about going through Malfoy’s diary — despite having already read more than a few pages — but he supposed there had to be a reason why he apparently had access to it and not Hermione. If this was the way Malfoy gave clues, Harry wasn’t surprised. The blonde was a mystery, it would only make sense if his asking for help was as complicated as the man himself.
After making sure that the ink would not shift to sting (bite?) his fingers again without him knowing, Harry began reading through the new pages, bracing himself for the worst, for he didn’t know what to expect anymore.
Harry sighed and picked the small journal up. He turned it this way and that, not seeing anything special about it. It was clearly old, but it’s owner took great care of it. The binding was worn by the numerous times of being used and carried around. Yet, there wasn’t any visible tear or stain on it.
“You sure you want to touch that?” Draco asks. His tone makes it seem like the mark is disgusting, dogshit that someone has smeared over his skin.
“It’s not me!” Ron finally retorts back. “And besides, you’re a witch. You can transfigure the sugar back.”
“Take a picture, will last longer, Malfoy.” Harry enjoys the teasing. Doesn’t matter if it’s with words or actions anymore.
Harry frowns down at a couple of pages that have been damaged particularly bad, trying hard to make sure the magic is a constant,
Hunger is evident in the way Draco grins, the darkening of his gaze. His fingers are gentle as they tangle into Harry’s hair, firm when they tilt his head back just enough for a better angle. “I don’t know, should I?” Draco kisses Harry’s jaw, then on the lips once more.
Harry mulls over what little he remembers of the letter, squinting into nothing for a little bit. “Ah, a witch called Levante Alby, I think?”
Harry likes how the elderly witch talks about the books and the craft. He had gone through training, of course, but being in the presence of someone that clearly thinks the world of the profession is a different feeling. A different take on the job.
“Like yours was any better.” Harry throws back, though it doesn’t sound anywhere near accusing or mocking when the words are tinted light with amusement and laughter.
There are takeout bags hanging from Draco’s fingers, the crinkly plastic of muggle making makes enough noise to fill the entire shop. Not a second later Ron steps inside as well, hair wet from rain and face splotchy red from the wind that has been rattling the windows all morning.
Draco has written about the time when Harry, Ron and Hermione were caught and brought back to the Malfoy mansion. It’s then that Harry needs to take a break himself, because the memories that he tries not to go back to are painful.
It doesn’t take much for them both to relocate to one of the sitting rooms of the Malfoy manor. The inside has been changed as well, from what Harry manages to catch during his walk through the corridors. If the lines of Draco’s journal that he had to see are to go by, then Draco and Narcissa both probably felt eager to remove the past from these walls and change the house to something new, something better and more welcoming than what the memory of Voldemort and Lucius made it out to be.
Draco takes his journal, but doesn’t open it. “At the manor, when I lied for you, I thought that that would be it. Aunt Bellatrix could smell out lies so easily and yet… She didn’t, then.” He closes his eyes and grimaces. “But you were the only hope that we all, that
Another silence and then Draco curses under his breath and escapes into the rainstorm outside. The jingle above the door
“So, you’re saying that you both are probably like each other, but there are some possible past hurts and present awkwardness around to properly do anything about it.” Remus summarizes the situation easily over yet another afternoon tea meeting.
Lightning bleaches the sky white. As white as Harry remembers the King’s Cross Station was when he died. He watches the veins of the lightning blink in an out of existence and swallows.
“You’re overthinking. It’s not that deep, as you young people like to say. Or my wife, at times.” Remus repeats himself. The amber of his eyes is warm with affection.
Draco’s finger traces the circle of the cup’s edge as he listens along. “With your track record, seeing how it goes usually works out for the best.”
They all share a laugh. The nurse comes back again, holding an icepack for Ron to put over his eye. While Ron is being slightly embarrassed by the whole ordeal, the nurse rolls her eyes and simply says that she has seen far worse done to husbands by their wives during the delivery process.
is not enough to get him through the night. He turns around, tries to see where Kreacher has left the candles that Harry uses on nights like these. The location is always the same, but Harry always looks for them anyway.
Sometimes, when the nightmares are the worst, Harry hears the way Hermione screamed as she was tortured, how useless and
“If possible, I’d like to have this saved. It’s… important.” Draco lets his finger linger on the cover; his lips almost pulled into something sad, regretful. He’s still so closed-off, the picture-perfect pureblood heir.
Harry knows his cheeks are probably pink by how warm they feel. “But there is history and I don’t know.”
talks while he is trying to stop me from bleeding out!” Ron tries very hard to keep a straight face, but can’t hold the laughter in for too long.
It doesn’t move, isn’t even as rich in color as it used to be, as how Harry had become used to seeing it. Now, with the owner of the brand dead, it simply
Teddy has crawled back into Harry’s lap and now is squinting very seriously at him. Harry blinks down at his godson.
When they get off Draco is wide-eyed and his hair a mess, cheeks flushed a healthy pink. “That was marvelous!”
Harry almost smiles. “Yeah. It’s that kind of night again.” He pauses, thinks of the things he should be doing and the ones he
Harry snorts. “Of course, right next to Teddy’s room. Kreacher helped me again, in-between of scolding me for not knowing anything about color coordination.”
“Did you mean it. The note.” Draco doesn’t quite ask. He sounds unsure, despite the steady voice and quietness that the words are spoken in. It’s the abruptness and stiltedness that give him away, rather.
. Perhaps, like he had told Draco the last time they met, not fully and completely, but he does know desperation and poisonous, consuming anger that comes with grief and trying to process loss and own weakness.
“Now who’s playing dirty, huh?” Harry thinks his breath is wet against the curve of Draco’s neck. He wants to bite it, leave indents of his teeth there as well, for all to see.
“I have a tiny one, minus the skies, now.” Harry laughs to himself as he busies himself with a kettle.
Draco hides a laugh behind his cup, though his eyes crinkle as he grins. “Thanks for the shitty handjob then.”
Kreacher doesn’t look pleased. The old elf grumbles under his nose for a moment, tiny eyes narrowed. “Fine. If Master Harry so wishes.”
Levante inspects the finished product with a critical eye, the eye of a mentor. She hums, then smiles. Her hands are gentle when they pet the diary’s cover, like one would an old friend. “Good work, Mr. Potter.”
“We all had it hard during Voldemort’s time, Malfoy. Just because my experience was generally fucked, doesn’t mean yours was any less shitty on accord of you not being a part of the undesirable groups.” Harry knows he’s also scowling, the furrow between his eyebrows a rather telling sign.
The naan bread is still warm as Harry bites into it. He chews for a moment as he thinks. “Sometimes I miss the days when Malfoy was up to something. Now it’s just boring adult shit and the occasional nervous breakdowns and identity crisis.”
The heaviness of Draco’s gaze makes shudders run up Harry’s spine. When their eyes meet Draco blinks once, slowly. Here, in this muggle amusement park, hidden away in a corner and out of the way from the excitement of all the people around them, Harry feels like the only thing that Draco sees and acknowledges. The kiss is quick, light thing that doesn’t linger, just promises of something else to come.
Ron already has his mouth full, cheeks bunched up and sauce on the corner of his lips. “A lot of different curries, from that muggle Indian place that we like. The case I got put on is annoying and I wanted to get away from the other guys.”
“Master Harry is supposed to be working today.” Kreacher snaps his fingers to levitate a plate of sandwiches over to Harry, mouth pulled into a judging line. “So why is Master Harry already up?”
want something, would the other wizard appreciate Harry butting in now, trying to use this chance? Will it seem like that? It’s true that Harry has tried to get it across that times have changed and he has moved on from all things war and foolish rivalries, but Draco seemed to have been under the assumption that Harry felt nothing but sexual frustration, at best, then and now feels maybe a neutral nothing.
When Harry glances back at Draco the other man takes a deep breath. It’s not arrogance that Harry meets, but uncertainty, fear. And he understands.
Harry looks away from Draco and towards where he had placed the journal for the time being. He had thought,
“Let me see.” The old man leafs though the book carefully, even if his fingers tremble slightly due to age. He hums and grumbles from time to time as he checks out Harry’s work, bushy eyebrows furrowed in concentration. “Looks to be fine, lad. Let me get my money then.”
? What are you talking about? I just saw a couple of lines about how hard it was then, because of Voldemort and your father.”
Draco crosses one leg over the other as he sips his own drink. It smells like cinnamon. “Yes, well, they reminded mother too much of father. She let a cousin that likes birds have them and they are much happier there, from what I last heard.”
“Harry, both you and young Malfoy were two dumb idiots then and have, by now, hopefully, outgrown the phase of thinking that anything the other does is some kind of a scheme. At worst you will be rejected.” Remus is laughing fondly as he speaks, sounds a little exasperated, “Besides, you fought and ended Voldemort, asking your crush out cannot possibly be as shite as that whole problem.”
They hug. Harry holds tightly onto Remus, gathers himself and then pulls away. Remus rolls his eyes and ruffles Harry’s hair, making it even more messy than it already was. There is something unsaid in the soft, warm way that Remus regards Harry, something that doesn’t need to be put into words. Harry waves as he leaves, refreshed and light, wondering about the next visit to the Lupin family. His family.
Levante turns her wise, grey eyes towards Harry when she has finished explaining how to retrieve words lost to time or damage. “This work is hard and, some would say, boring. It’s only boring if you think of it as boring. It’s also relaxing, and I think you, of all the people, need that, Mr. Potter.”
desk, her wrinkly face pulled into a thoughtful expression. She smooths her hands down her, surprisingly, muggle pantsuit once. “I will be here for two weeks and then you will be alone, but will be able to reach the main headquarters via Floo network, if necessary. I was under the impression that you preferred to be alone, Mr. Potter?”
“You sound like daddy when mommy scolds him, uncle Harry.” Teddy giggles where he has hidden his face in Harry’s armpit. “And then mommy makes this long
Harry taps the bottle of cool butterbeer with his nail once, twice, then lets out a long breath. “Yeah, yeah I know what you mean. It’s been, easier. I still have my episodes, nightmares and so on, you know how it goes, but now they aren’t as often. Having a purpose helped a lot.”
“Honestly, Harry, Remus is like your third father.” Hermione has ink on her cheek, a muggle pen stuck in her hair.
“You truly are a bleeding Gryffindor even now, Potter.” Draco almost laughs. His lips are pulled into an incredulous smile, or something that might be that. “But you’re right, I suppose. The Dark Lord ruined those around him in different ways.”
Ron ambles back into the living room, hair wet and water dripping on his shirt. “Should we be talking about numb nipples right now?” He scowls down at Hermione. “There is a child in the room and all that.”
The same honey glow fills the kitchen. Harry watches the candles float around his kitchen, finds himself giggling as he thinks of the enchanted ceiling in Great Hall, how even now he marvels at the beauty of it.
Harry has never told this to anyone else, but he noticed Draco in that last battle. When he dueled Voldemort, with the curses and spells that were being cast around him, through the pandemonium of
Remus sips his tea, then mutters angrily under his nose when some gets on his mustache. Harry hides his laugh behind his own cup, one that is chipped and glued together with superglue despite being a part of a home where two fully grown magic users live. But it gives the Lupin home its comfortable feeling, the kind of warmth that Harry enjoys immensely.
“Why not? I’m desecrating Tom’s special friendship mark with my nasty halfblood fluids and just overall archnemesis aura.” Harry hides his grin against Draco’s chest, places a kiss where he can feel steady heartbeat under his cheek.
None of the people that they pass so much as look back as Harry leads Draco towards one of the roller coasters at the amusement park. Harry grins wide at the look of confusion and startlement that Draco has adapted, out of depth as he is.
The door jingles and an old man comes in, a letter clutched in his hand. “Ah, young man, hello to you.”
“They’d be proud of you, you know?” Remus says when they stand by the door of the Lupin house. “Of everything you have done and are doing right now.”
“It’s because you guys are useless and annoying.” Hermione says sagely from her hospital bed. She has her daughter sleeping in her arms again. “Also, you were about to break at least fifty different laws concerning muggles and I needed you to shut up.”
The laugh that breaks past Draco’s lips is one of surprise, of disbelief. The coat sleeve falls and covers the dark mark as Draco lets his left arm fall and the right comes up to mess his hair. “Which one of them all?
Remus’ nose twitches as the man sighs. He doesn’t look annoyed or angry, just reluctantly amused. His nose twitches again and he stands up to gather up some of the sandwiches on another plate. Harry soon hears the
The clock ticks and outside of the shop life moves in in a jumble of loud noises and colorful blurs of magical folk of all ages hurrying along with their chores. The monochromatic world around Harry is calm, even with Draco’s presence in it. There is still something fragile in Draco’s gaze when he looks at the journal, as he seems to think things over.
Harry laughs. Quietly and raspy, as if the sound is foreign to him, but he laughs. The tiny note sits still on the desk before him, the paper smooth and without any ink stains. It’s just one, simple sentence that packs more than it seems, more than Harry thinks it should be allowed to get across.
Ron thumps his shoulder against Harry’s. “Have you furnished a room at Cliffside Lookout for your godbaby yet?”
that was tacked to the same things that his friends were yelling was desperate and full of trust. It seemed like a hallucination then and after the battle, but because of the journal now Harry thinks it might have been real.
A couple more hours and Harry smooths his hand over the cover of the journal, now clean of any kind of damage. He has restored the original and only charms, the ones that keep thoughts hidden and private, let only Draco see the insides of the memories and thoughts put inside the pages for safekeeping. The journal hums with magic, calm and simple.
It’s hard to tell if the answer works for Draco, but the wizard doesn’t say anything else. He just nods and leaves. Harry watches him go yet again, feeling like, perhaps, something changed between the two of them. There in an itch, a need left over from years of wanting to know what Draco has been up to, that makes Harry want to know everything, find out what the journal holds. But he knows better than to give into it, to become someone that disregards both human and work boundaries, rules,
Harry tilts his head back to think. His own relationship history is not one of the best, so there isn’t much for him to base his wants
“You know, now some of Malfoy’s shite seems to make sense, if I think about it as him being weird about his crush on you. Like you were.” Ron points his wand at Hermione’s shirt to clean it, then raises it up at his own hair. After a moment of hesitation, he reconsiders and goes off to the kitchen to wash the baby powder out.
Somehow Harry has managed to summon paper and pen to himself, both of which now lay in his lap, waiting to be used. The first questions Harry scribbles onto the paper with messy letters, lines shaky as the fear has not fully gone away. But the more Harry writes the easier it gets, the questions turning into confessions and wonderings about just how much Draco could relate to Harry, and other way around as well, perhaps.
“Yeah, yeah I am, Kreacher.” Harry looks down at the short, one-sentence note that he has penned with far greater difficulty than it should have been. He takes the cup of tea and breathes in. “Should I send this one?”
“Is it the one with the drugs? Or unknown origin kneazle hybrids?” Harry joins the two. He places a pot of warm tea in the middle of the table.
Tonight, it’s neither warm, nor pleasant outside. The cliffside moans with the strength of a storm, raindrops hard and heavy as they bang against the windows. If during the day Harry finds the sea a calm mirror, at times, then tonight he thinks of a yawning abyss that swallows souls like candies. Waves crash against the cliffs and wards around his house shiver with how electrified the air truly is.
crushes on as I did you. You were just impressively annoying and too Gryffindor for me to bear.” Draco’s cheeks have colored slightly pink, despite the confident air around him. “
“Well, he and his mum have had pretty shitty after-war years. The aurors still need to go and do check-ups on them, like, once every three months to make sure they are behaving. Though, with Malfoy senior gone they aren’t as concerned anymore, from what I hear through gossip.” Ron burps rather loudly. He leans back in the rickety chair and sighs long and drawn-out, having had his fill.
Harry doesn’t know what to say in reply. He resents others for putting that burden onto him, especially because anyone could have killed Voldemort had they tried, had Dumbledore not kept all the cards so himself until the final moment.
The sheets tangle around them and the room smells, is so hot. Harry gives into the need to be loud. Draco takes pleasure from every noise, every tiny moan and gasp, the curses that are whispered against the pillows. When Harry winds up sitting in Draco’s lap, his sweaty body bared to the warm air of the room the wizard just lays back and lets Harry take charge of everything.
of it. But then Harry remembers the time in Malfoy mansion, the fear that had turned Draco thin and bruised, remembers Draco lying for him when that would have cost the other wizard more than just a slap on his hand and a fake reprimand.
Just as Harry is about to disapparate he sees two women walk to the cemetery. Thankfully, they haven’t noticed him, both too busy whispering between each other. But even with her back turned to him, Harry still recognizes Cho Chang. The witch looks tired, the kind of tired that comes with rewarding work and having lived through the things that they did. Clinging onto her arm is Marietta Edgecombe.
carved into her skin, covered by a tattoo of vines crawling along her arm. It’s a baseless fear, one that Harry knows should no longer matter, he should get help for at some point, but it’s still there. It makes his hands tremble and heart beat faster than normal.
Hermione chuckles, pleased. “Oh, that does sound lovely. And you’ll be close to George. Do you know who will be there with you during the probation?”
Harry digs into the curry with an acknowledging hum towards Ron’s ranting. As per department rules the man can’t get too into details, not even with friends and family, in case something gets out to the wrong people, but Harry doesn’t mind the vague comments and general whining. It’s the same as with some of Harry’s own books, after all. He does snort spicy curry up his nose when Ron starts ranting about something that the new head of auror department had done, which lead to a department-wide panic.
The high-pitched screams of the people before them don’t dither Harry from getting into the seat after them. Draco gets in and sits down slower, more carefully than Harry had, though he is looking rather distrustfully at the handlebar that comes down and straps them to their seat. When the ride starts Harry glances excitedly at Draco from the corner of his eye.
Remus and Tonks share a look before glancing down at their proud-looking son. Harry hides his amused grin behind a sandwich, all too familiar with Teddy’s extensive vocabulary, mainly thanks to Tonks. Not that the parents seem too bothered by that, they just sort of accepted the fate of being constantly reprimanded by the grandparents about their and, in turn, their son’s bad habits.
“Majority of the wizarding world is why the war happened in the first place. Voldemort wouldn’t have gotten as far as he did without the prejudices or malice that was already there.” Harry finally brings over Draco’s journal and places it on the counter before the other man. “You
The witch speaks in a rather loud voice, her English accented in a way that Harry does not recognize, but it feels familiar and heard. She reminds him of McGonagall, with the way that Levante doesn’t seem to care of Harry’s supposed achievements and fame, but only the work he already has and will put in.
“Never heard of her.” Ron has licked off the crumbs from the corner of his mouth and is already eating another biscuit. “Do you know what you should do? This yogi thing that Hermione does now. It’s all about breathing and funny poses.”
Harry feels warm, surrounded by this little family. Remus is the one thing he has left that connects him with the past, with James, Lily and Sirius. Maybe Remus feels the same, maybe not, but there are times when the wizard looks at Harry with something unreadable in his eyes, a mix of pride and pain that is hard to take in.
Harry smiles, almost. “I already told you, I’m past petty school pranks. I liked you then, I like you now. I mean, it doesn’t have to go anywhere, obviously--”
Harry thinks about how Draco ran from the shop, about the panicked look in the other wizard’s eye. The baggage they are both carrying. “What if… what if the other person isn’t okay with me and this…
. I think she hates me.” Ron sets his lunch on an empty coffee table that Harry pulled out of the storage.
“Despite the Malfoy thing, you are much… happier now.” Ron says as he rocks a sleeping Rose side to side. “I’m glad, you know? Me and ‘Mione found our ways to cope a while back and to see you also settle after everything… It’s just so, well, a relief, I guess.”
Ron’s black eye has long healed by now. Though right now he has baby powder in his hair and Rose’s drool on his shoulder. “I told you, gay train wrecks. And now it might be a reciprocated train wreck! Your life’s truly looking up, mate.”
. But Draco seems to be a different sort from Harry’s usual types and experiences. “I don’t know.” He decides to be truthful. “I feel like I have kind of sucked at dating until now, so not sure. Just see how it goes, maybe?”
“Oh, you’re such a nice boy, Harry. Bless your heart.” Mrs. Granger pats Harry’s shoulder and then immediately turns to Hermione and coos at the sleeping baby girl. “Oh, look at that hair! Luis, look at that hair! Mio, oh, she is so adorable. How are you holding up, honey? We sent an owl to Molly before coming over, since we weren’t sure if she knows, by the way.”
In the evening Harry is desperate to see his friends, to see that Hermione is healthy and happy, even with
The wind that blows is chilly, but Harry doesn’t even notice it. He finally laughs, a quiet and surprised thing that seems to catch Draco off-guard as well. Perhaps it’s what was needed to break the awkward tension, the awkward fumbling around, not knowing how to proceed and what is the right thing to say.
“Well I wasn’t the one who told me, and I quote, we got to this hospital, or I end your life, Ronald Bilius Weasley. You know I’m still learning.” Ron dutifully keeps the icepack on his eye.
“You were right about the muggle world. No one does care about us here.” Draco remarks and his voice is low now, a rasp against Harry’s lips. “I can snog you like this and the only thing someone might care about is our gender.”
, don’t remind me of that, Potter. It was both mortifying and fueled my wank sessions for a long time to come.”
Hermione adorned with pregnancy glow and a round tummy is a strange sight. Ron with his awkward hovering and nervousness over every single thing that his girlfriend does is even more so. But Harry loves them both, fiercely and strongly, so he simply smiles and watches the strange dance going on before him without commentary.
Not quite in the way that he believes that it never ended, or that he somehow thinks that he should have stayed dead, there on the cold dirt of the Forbidden Forest (although, some nights the thought does come and hovers in his vicinity, buzzing like a mosquito). For Harry it’s the tremble in his fingers when he raises his wand and remembers the red eyes that had been on the other end of it, the sneer of his name that Voldemort hissed before he cast the
Draco turns to leave, pauses. He looks back just enough so that Harry sees his side profile, the aristocratic jut of his nose. “Thank you, Potter.”
“It’s not like the muggle world is any better, but it’s like the first impressions have dulled out and now the nasty stuff is more obvious.” Harry stretches his legs out before him. The toes of his sneakers are dirty, one has a sticky soda spot on it. “I’m tired of them all, I don’t know, treating me like a sideshow at times.”
The sun rises above the horizon slowly, the sea sloshes against the cliffs loudly and Harry breathes in the salty air. The cottage had been nothing but a forgotten Potter property, kind of falling apart when Harry first showed up here and decided that this will be his new home. Away from the wizarding world and
That’s a loaded question, for how simple it pretends to be. Harry turns the cup in his hands round and round, eyes downcast to not see worry painting his friends’ faces older than they are. There are many answers he could give, the ones that he uses when Molly asks, when other friends ask. But just like Harry finds it impossible to lie when Remus is the one on the other side of the table, he cannot lie now either.
“I’m not going to do anything to it, apart from what I do with any other book that I have worked on. I’m over our dumbass feud already.” Harry thinks his words taste sandy, overly practiced and rehearsed. They are the truth, but he wishes he wouldn’t have to say them.
Before the final battle he would have said an auror. Before the final battle there were no ghosts of the dead friends and family haunting him, the echoes of those on Voldemort’s side that sometimes stared at Harry from dark corners, their faces covered in blood and dirt.
The book is a journal. It’s sealed behind a charm that makes the contents hidden inside invisible to anyone but the owner, there are other, more common journal charms woven into the spells that were meant to keep the journal safe and prevent it from getting lost. But something dark had torn through them and left holes nehind, apart from the physical damage.
There is a knock on the door and Hermione’s mom pokes her head in. She smiles at the three of them, then ushers her husband in as well once she has determined that everyone is awake, there is no Ron murdering going on. Harry gets up from his seat and offers it to Mrs. Granger.
The sun rises slowly and Harry watches as the world becomes brighter by the second. He wonders if he will also be able to do that, one day.
Harry leans down to examine the book. There is strange magic on it. He doesn’t touch it yet, but does tap it gently with his wand, mouths the words for the incantation to detect how damaged the book is. There are curse residues on it, a malice to it that Harry has only seen during his courses. But it’s not an impossible job. Just hard and, probably, long, as it would be Harry’s first time working on something this complex.
Tonks sits in Remus’ lap and reaches for a sandwich. “If you get any dirt on old pureblood families do let me know. I’m always up for juicy details, but mom doesn’t tell me any anymore.”
“She looks like a dried raisin.” Harry is holding the newborn carefully, as per the nurse’s instructions.
Remus’ words had sat heavily on his mind for the whole evening and night after Harry left the man’s house. He is still unsure if this will, or can, go anywhere, but there is no harm in trying, in reaching out and offering an
Malfoy Manor looms over Harry the same way it had done when he was dragged here by Greyback. Then it was a frightening sight, the house, the aura of it and the way the werewolves laughed scent of fear that had wrapped around Harry and his friends. It does feel more welcoming this time around, less a possible death sentence and more like simply
With a raspy hum Harry opens his mouth and bites into the mark, licks the indents that his teeth have left behind.
“Mum’s gonna cry.” Ron unhelpfully notes as he gently pokes his daughter’s chubby cheek. “She’s gonna loves this wrinkly, brown raisin and send us so many knitted clothes and then tell me I’m doing a shite job at holding her right. It’s gonna be amazing.”
