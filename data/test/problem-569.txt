“Oh thank you Merlin, you're fine!” He exclaimed. Then he went away, ignoring Draco. Harry sighed, at least he had not tried to hit him or insult him. He was then assaulted by his six children, who were visibly afraid of losing their father. Draco was added to the family hug and Harry felt a whiff of happiness coming into him: he had a family, and this family was the most perfect of all.
“Are you hungry?” Eleanor asked, wishing to put an end to this embarrassed mood. They all sat down around the table and everyone was watching everyone. It was finally Ezekiel who broke the silence.
“Is everyone gone because you're laughing? Because at home when you laugh we laugh too, we don’t leave. Do we have to leave too?”
“Absolutely” Harry laughed.
“We wait here until she wakes up” Dimitri said, looking just about to kill this girl with his bare hands.
“I'm going to kill that damn dark Lord as soon as possible and nothing will happen to you” Draco smiled and pulled Harry into a languid kiss.
Later that day, Harry finally decided to go up in his room. Draco hadn’t come down at all, sulking. Harry entered the children room and Emett was laughing with his four friends on his bed. Harry was happy to see that the sadness that was here before wasn’t there anymore.
"Come on, couldn’t you go kiss somewhere else? You block the passage!” A voice intervened in the corridor. The two blond brothers looked at each other.
“He's all alone for now”
“They are Alarik and his sister Erika and the youngest is Seth” She finished pointing to the little boy standing with her.
realized that it was just him being attracted to Malfoy in a more romantic way than rival should be, and had been for a long time now.
“Hm... yes, indeed” The redhead recognized.
“What observations?” Jordan asked.
“Congratulations Granger, did you understand that on your own?”
“He's just drunk” Alarik added. Hermione pursed her lips and prepared to say that Harry was not drinking but Draco cut her off.
“But do you know what it's all about?” The girl and the four boys behind her gave him smiles that didn’t reassured Harry. He dropped his head against the top of the sofa and jumped when he found himself facing Draco's face. Draco looked away from the book he was reading over Hermione's shoulder and looked at Harry, who was looking at him in an odd way.
Zach almost ran to a girl and knelt down beside her as the triplets appeared next to Harry and Draco.
“Are we going in or what?” Nathaniel asked, as if waiting from the beginning for Lucius to decide. They then set out for the Ministry of Magic. Harry vaguely wondered why Lucius had apparated them so far.
“My brother and I are the first twins in the family so we have a lot of magic and it shows in one of our physical characters. And I also have the ability to read minds” Harry nodded, a sign he understood.
The kid seemed about to speak so Harry motioned him to shut up and went over to hug him. He ended up in the hallway. He decided to go to Hermione's room, thinking that, given the early hour, she might not be up yet. He put Lesath on the floor in front of the door and asked him to wait for him here. He then entered gently, making no sound, suspecting that the children were still sleeping. He crossed the room safely and opened the door leading to Hermione's room. The room was plunged into the most complete darkness. Harry tried to tell which bed Hermione was in but failed.
“I see it too, Luce, but my son's face shines with joy and that's all I care about” Lucius looked more closely at his son, he was facing the table again and the blond boy was standing on his legs and the boy was talking cheerfully as Draco smiled at him. He saw Harry put his arm around his son's waist and his smile grew even bigger. Lucius smiled, it's true his son had never seemed so happy. He told himself that finally he had done well to ask Dumbledore for help to flee the dark lord. His wife and son seemed happy, as well as him.
“I was preparing a Christmas present! That's why I was not there often” From where he was, Draco didn’t see Harry's reaction who kept walking. “I love you, Harry, I just wanted to surprise you” Then, feeling no reaction, he returned sheepishly into the living room. He walked slowly through the living room, staring at the floor as Harry held him by the wrist. Draco turned slowly and to his surprise Harry placed his lips on his. He slightly opened his lips and let Harry's tongue get into his mouth.
“I didn’t think you had such a high-pitched voice, Hermione” Blaise laughed from his place in the kitchen.
"Perfect," they all murmured before parting.
“Getting back to Quidditch, do you have a way to build a team? For a little parent-child match maybe?” He asked. The children answered yes with great enthusiasm and got up hurriedly from the table, going upstairs to develop this famous team. The table was suddenly very big and empty. With a movement of the wrist, Harry made the empty tables disappear and they were all less distant. They started talking again, although the atmosphere was slightly tense.
“Yes?” Nathaniel asked him. The newcomer stamped his foot on the ground before answering
“I don’t want to bother, but if you could do it somewhere else, it would be really nice” Emett said confidently as his four friends watched Harry and Draco with mocking smiles. Draco then led a more than red Harry into their room. He slammed Harry back against the door and kissed him passionately. Harry moaned as Draco ripped them off their clothes with a simple wish. The blonde lifted Harry up and Harry wrapped his legs around the pale waist. Draco held out his fingers at Harry, who sucked them carefully as Draco led them to one of the beds. He pushed two of his fingers into Harry as soon as they were on the bed. He straightened up on his knees between Harry's spread legs and leaned forward to suck Harry's cock with application while adding a third finger inside Harry. Harry almost shouted with pleasure at the feeling. After a few rounds, Draco pulled his fingers out under Harry's grunts. He started moaning again as Draco began to slide his cock inside him while kissing him again. Harry wrapped his legs around Draco's waist, screaming as Draco hit his prostate forcefully.
“I’m sorry, Harry, I didn’t mean to yell like that, I was scared” Harry decided that it probably wasn’t that much of a big deal. He knew the truth about the wall because he tried himself but Draco didn’t know. And the story was hard to believe in itself.
“No, but do you realize? As if we were the type to organize a party with alcohol! Really…” He was offended. His two friends gave him dubious looks.
“It's still hot out there, right?” Nathaniel asked innocently. His brothers and sisters looked at him exasperatedly. Hermione nodded. “So we could go to the park? to the lake maybe?” His twin sighed.
“By the way, this is Emett, he's my little brother" Nathaniel told them, remembering that his brother had not been introduced. Hermione did not give anyone time to answer anything.
“I arrived this morning and thought it would be useful to tell you that I had met Grandpa Lu in the hall” Harry frowned.
“Lyra and Ezé can come with us” Joris offered.
“Believe me, the wonderful memory of having smashed your skull against this pretty wall will make me pass the time” She swallowed hard but the glow of defiance in her eyes only strengthened. The aura of anger around the boy thickened even more as he took her off the wall from a few inches.
“So how do you take your pregnancy?” Joris asked, whispering. Draco's eyes widened as he stared at the blonde.
“You’re  beautiful, babe” He whispered, astonished by his lover’s beauty. Both are too deeply lost in lust to notice the affection seeping through Harry’s voice and into the words. Draco slid his fingers into the black, messy hair and pulled Harry down for a kiss. As his mouth started moving against the Slytherin, Harry gently pushed one slick finger into Draco who tears his mouth away in a moan. Harry quickly catches it again and bites Draco’s lower lip.
“Right now” Harry breathed out, feeling turned the fuck on for whatever reason.
“Let's go?” He asked in the direction of the triplets as he reached their room. They all nodded in perfect synchronization.
Pansy opened the door at that moment and entered the room, Hermione right behind her.
“Don’t you think it's nice that they love their sons even if they haven’t had it yet? I mean, it's like they have that natural paternal instinct with their children. As if deep inside they knew it was their son” Ginny whispered. Pansy turned her head to Ginny, she was not wrong, she was perfectly right to say it all.
“They're asleep, don’t worry” Erin told him, happy to be able to joke with his best friend again.
And now, he was alone in front of 13 teenagers who were casting spells on him. He saw the triplets clasp their hands together and a wave of red and green magic ran to Harry. His shield burst into pieces when the wave hit him hard and he was thrown into the air. He landed heavily on the ground a few feet away. He made another shield appear around him as he stood up. He saw a new wave coming towards him so he reinforced his shield. Once the wave was gone, cracking the shield, he made it disappear and slammed his hands on the ground. A shock wave spread on the floor, sending the children waltzing in the air.
“What is-“ She was cut short by another thud against the door.
“It's not true!” He said with an air of outrage.
Harry walked to Zephir and hesitated before sitting down next to him. The boy barely looked at him, his head bent low. He was looking at his hands, which were lying on his legs.
“She's with Theo and I don’t want to come in” He winced again and put one of his hands against his loins.
As Malfoy came out, Harry turned and looked at the room. The room was square and two double beds were on each side, then two large wardrobes were placed next to the beds. On the back wall, there was the bathroom door. The room was in shades of beige, gray, black and white. Harry smiled a little as he looked around the room, he felt good here. He turned around and went through the door too, or at least he tried but he hit Malfoy's back, who had been standing on the doorstep.
“Is it possible?” He asked Hermione.
“From what I read, you had to think both of you at least once in the way ... how do you say? In a love way” Draco and Harry began to think, looking for when it had happened. “But that's not all. It must also after that you have come into contact”
“Dad? I have something to tell you” Harry shot a relieved look at him. He knew perfectly well that the child had nothing to say to him.
“No doubt about it” He answered, in concert with Nathaniel. They both looked at each other laughing and then the blond turned his gaze to his brunette friend and one of their conversations took place again.
“I’ll repeat myself, but are you fucking crazy?” Draco exclaimed once more. Blaise laughed in disbelief.
In the room they had just left, Draco was struggling to find the doorknob while his tongue danced with Harry's. He finally got tired of it so he pretended to push the doors with one of his hands, without touching them, and the doors opened automatically. He pushed Harry inside and closed them with a kick. Harry looked at him laughing as he saw him. To avenge the mockery, Draco lifted Harry up and threw him on the bed. He straddled the brown man and looked into his eyes. He placed his hands on Harry's cheeks and leaned over to kiss Harry's smiling lips. He straightened up and removed Harry's glasses, which he put on the bedside table.
Draco wasn’t really happy about what she just said and she knew it. He should probably listen to her, go to Hogwarts, graduate and then never think or talk to Potter ever again. But, as his stomach twisted at the thought, he couldn’t shake the feeling that this was wrong. He did not want to ignore Potter and forget entirely about him.
“No, you don’t understand. He's really great but I mean he's physically fantastic. He's really sexy” He sighed as he finished his sentence. Harry chuckled and smiled tenderly. Noticing him, Draco blushed violently. Harry turned off the lights with a gesture and he literally fell on the blonde.
"Do you know some things about what happened?” Blaise nodded.
“Come on” Harry whispered, lifting Draco in his arms and going to put him in a bed. He waited for the blond to fall asleep before leaving the room. He approached Emett's bed, where about twenty people were grouped together.
“Your son claims his father and he prevents me from eating and if I don’t eat-“
“Um ... yes, sort of, but Draco saved me, don’t worry” Molly frowned as she heard that, since when were the two boys calling each other by their first names?
“He knows” Nathaniel whispered as Draco crossed the children's room just as quickly. The others sighed, shaking their heads, pretending to ignore the tears they had seen on their father's cheeks.
“They are the most powerful soulmates that exist, Uncle Theo. So we, their children, are more powerful than average. But an only child will not be as powerful as twins. And having triplets is exceptional for two men, so Nathaniel, our sister and I are almost as powerful as our parents” Blaise and Theo nodded, impressed.
“I know it because Lyra's birthday is in about 9 months”
“You two! When we say we keep this secret, it means that you don’t laugh together or anything!” The Potionist began.
“What are we doing with her now?” He asked, because even though that girl tried to kidnap his daughter for the second time because of a stupid crush, she still was a girl. She didn’t deserve to die in Harry’s opinion.
“What are you talking about?” Erin asked him.
“Are you Harry's son?” Molly asked him.
“I'll go, see you later?” Harry nodded and then slightly kissed Draco. He got up and went out of the room. Ron chuckled and Harry took his eyes off his blonde's ass to cast a questioning look at his friend. The latter tried to give him a small smile, a sign that he was trying to be forgiven for being a complete git.
“I love you too” Harry said when he pulled back slightly. Draco grinned and hugged him in his arms.
“Well, let's go” And with these words, they had all gone to the bedrooms and gone to bed without anyone saying a word more.
“It seemed to me that we had agreed that it would happen much later”
“I know you don’t want to do that” Pansy continued, a gentle but sad smile on her lips. “But it’s the best, ok?” Draco sighed a bit dramatically as she finished her sentence, her hand on his arm. Blaise nodded besides her.
“Are you all right, gentlemen?” He questioned them. They both stared blankly, trying to assimilate the news that was falling on them. Malfoy came back to him first and looked up at the director.
“What are you doing there!?” Dimitri slowly looked up at him.
“I love you too” He replied, kissing his lips lightly. Harry cast a spell to clean them and then lay down next to Draco, who immediately went to stick his back to his chest. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and wished him a good night kissing his neck one last time.
“I meant what are you doing here? At that time?” Lyra reiterated. He shrugged.
“I don’t want to interrupt you...” Erin who had joined them, started.
“It wouldn’t really have been a rape, Potter” Harry nearly choked on himself again and blushed heavily.
“Don’t you think it’s weird that there are kids we don’t know?”
“That's out of the question, Potter!” Harry squeezed his fists so hard that his knuckles whitened.
“What?” Draco asked him.
Draco looked at her with a sad look and then ran off in the direction that Harry had taken. He saw him a little further down the hall.
Yes, Ezekiel was slightly perfectionist and maniacal. Then they went out of the room on a common agreement.
“I'd rather say he's sleeping it off” Zachady grimaced but nodded.
Draco slammed him against the door, which closed completely and a wave spread through the room. Harry pushed the blonde back slightly.
“Oh my god...” He murmured with a smile on his face.
Maybe his room was safe from that too, but he still had some bad memories in it. Worse memories. He closed his eyes painfully for a second as a memory of him crying as he clutched his chest came in his mind. He opened his eyes and looked off in the distance as he brushed his fingers against the scars on his naked chest. That damn boy would be the end of him with his green eyes and his scar. Draco had tried to hate him. He really had tried. But who could hate Harry Potter, uh? The boy was a goddamn gift to the world. Always kind and smiling and fucking gentle.
“Ezé! Shut up” The blond girl, who had already intervened several times during the day, reprimanded. Dumbledore looked at her and continued.
“Is my brother still sleeping?” Zachady asked Ezekiel as they crossed the hall once he was deserted.
“Can you help me move those books?” Harry asked, starting to take several large volumes in his arms. Blaise's hand stopped him from grabbing the books.
Harry and Draco were doing their best to kiss each other without waking up the other two people in the room. The door swung open and Draco, in a pure reflex, tilted to the side. He fell into a thud on the floor and he thanked Harry for catching his head.
“Maybe you’re right but I’m sixteen too so who could understand him better than me?” Harry said as he started to get up.
“Dad doesn’t come?” A small voice asked on his left. He turned his head to Lesath, sitting on Hermione's lap. He sighed and looked in the direction of Malfoy who was staring at him from afar, not knowing whether to approach or not. Harry stared into the blonde's eyes, and he seemed to understand Harry's invitation as he motioned for his friends to follow him.
“It'll be fine, it'll be fine, you'll be okay, everything will be okay” Draco whispered as Harry lost consciousness. Then, as Draco was lost and watched Harry die slowly, Ezekiel and Nathaniel came running, so fast that Draco was disturbed. They screamed something in their race but he did not understand what they were saying, speaking at the same time.
“Are you going to send me back to my bed? Or will you allow me to stay here?” Harry finally asked after a long time when they nearly fell asleep.
“No wait!” The redhead yelled as Ezekiel was about to smash her against the wall. A smug smile appeared on the boy's lips as he rested her softly on the floor.
“And you're my daughter” She gave him a big smile.
“I promise” He said, still laughing. He left the room, the three blondes on his heels. They left the apartment and headed for the hall. When they arrived, Sirius and Lucius were waiting for them.
He put his hand on it and he was propelled into the air by something like a wave of invisible magic. He crashed to the ground several meters further, right on the pile of books that collapsed under his weight. He saw Blaise's hand appear before his eyes. He grabbed it and thanked his friend once he was on his feet.
“To answer your question, I would say we need to stay a few hours” He then winked at him and turned around, going to find his two blond older sons. Draco opened his mouth outrageously and Harry laughed loudly.
“We must believe that it is no longer relevant” Harry could hear no more, sinking into unconsciousness
“Yes, and that’s the problem actually” The second blond one said as he was looking with slightly panicked eyes at Harry.
“I guess they'll keep it a secret for a moment” Erin whispered.
"I mean, Voldemort got Daddy angry and Daddy threw all his anger on that poor Voldy” Draco frowned. How's that poor Voldy? The children noticed his questioning.
“Do that too” Draco nodded and they went back into the room.
Someone knocked on the door just as he was about to pour himself a generous amount of whatever alcohol was in the fancy bottle in his hand. Pansy always had amazing looking bottles of alcohol in her house.
“But busy with what?” Harry practically yelled.
They glared at each other for a moment before the youngest turned to Harry and apologized reluctantly. Harry gave him a smile for acceptance. The boy turned around and went to sit further away. Harry also smiled at the girl to thank her and he finally sat down with his friends. He picked up some food and started eating but stopped after a few seconds. He could almost hear the wheels working in Hermione's head. He raised his head to her and swallowed his food.
“That's how you counterattack” Lyra whispered to Draco.
Harry was executing a Wronski feint, Draco, Blaise, Ron, and Theo at his pursuit. Sirius, Lucius, Remus and Severus watched from the ground. They were at Malfoy Manor and had been questioned by Harry when he knew it.
“How are we counter-attacking?” He asked with a gleam of determination in his eyes.
“How can you know that?”
“Pacem” The door had disappeared from the wall, leaving only bricks. A rectangle made of several bricks slowly detached from the wall and one by one, the bricks separated to form a passage leading to a room. Professor Dumbledore looked at her colleague and she nodded before leaving.
“We already know their identities, Mione”
“Yes” Harry sighed. Blaise and Theo had literally died laughing in the middle of the hallway.
“Draco?” Harry called. The blonde moved out of the door and sat against the wall. Harry opened the door and opened his eyes wide, seeing Draco even paler than usual.
“What are you doing?” Harry asked them as he was forced to sit on his bed.
“One” He began. The redhead tried to struggle but Alya came into the room, reinforcing the power of her brother. She moved to Harry's side and gave him a big smile as she opened a bunch of candy.
“It's okay... I'm here and I'm not going to die” Draco then lifted Harry's trembling body when Harry whispered in horror that it was starting again. He laid him on the bed and a vision appeared in his mind. He saw himself bleeding from the ground while Harry screamed on the bed. He closed his mind and the image disappeared. Then he thought for a few moments and was struck by the idea that had sprouted in him. The image he had seen was from Harry and she was sent to him by Voldemort, so he wondered if Voldemort could see what he was sending to Harry.
“Godfather? Can we go see Dad?” She asked the blonde. The latter nearly choke on discovering he had a godchild.
“Oh, fuck!” One of the brunettes, who was staring at Ron looking surprised, swore.
“That’ll do it” Nathaniel said as he knotted a piece of his shirt over the wound. Jordan was breathing hard. Nathaniel helped Jordan on his feet and held him close.
“Where’s Zeph?” He asked with the same small voice.
“Thank you” Draco whispered, who had felt bad too. Narcissa's eyes widened and her mouth formed a perfect "O".
“Speaking of that, I found some kind of a plan”
“What children? We know everyone, Mione” Ron interjected.
“Really?” Harry laughed for about half a second before suddenly becoming very serious, as if they weren’t both completely naked and on the verge of making love.
“Because we don’t wanna die, do we?” Jordan moved his head to say no and then glared at the wall like it was mean to him. Nathaniel pulled the library to close it. Just as it closed, the door of the living room bursted open.
“Me and Dimi can take Erin and Lesath, he can sleep with Seth” Alarik began.
“So, what do you want to know about the war?” Draco thought for a moment, asking questions in his mind.
“Do you think they’ll…?” He asked Draco silently as they walked slowly behind the boys. He shook his head and tightened his hand around Harry’s. Harry took that as a ‘Maybe, I don’t know’. They caught up with the others as they laid the girl on the floor.
“Are your dads here?” Pansy asked her.
“It probably happened when you took my wrist this morning” Draco concluded. Harry nodded and he sighed. If this little cunt had not wandered in underwear in front of him, all that would not have happened. Or maybe it would not have changed anything.
Harry was speechless, not thinking Lucius too tender with his family. Footsteps were heard from the stairs and Zach, Dimitri, Alarik, Jordan and Joris appeared in the living room.
“What happened?”
“Downstairs, go help them” The kids then rushed downstairs as Draco moved toward the larger room. He opened the door with his magic and rushed to his bed. He put Harry on it and then ran to the bathroom to puck his lunch.
“What time is it?” He asked all the same, curious.
He received no response but his sister came near the others and he joined them a few moments later while holding the back of his head. Lyra mocked him and Eleanor went to hold Dimitri in her arms.
“I’ve read something about it” Hermione, sitting in front of Harry, told them. Draco was still red and Harry could hear him mutter. It seemed to be a lot of fun for Lyra, sitting next to Hermione. “I’ve read that there were risks of violent nightmares”
"Why do Seth sleep with you?” Ezekiel asked, frowning.
“Molly, they just want a party to have fun, if that can reassure you we won’t let them any alcohol” He winked at them, however. Molly grunted and left the table furiously under the laughter of everyone else. They finally finished the meal quickly and while the children were all rushing upstairs, causing a hell of a bang on the stairs. The teenagers of the present day went into the living room with the adults. Harry didn’t listen to the conversation but it seemed to him that the subject was the children and who were their parents, although Molly, Arthur and Tonks were the only ones who did not know. Harry closed his eyes and tilted his head back on the couch, feeling a strange sensation invade his head. It was strange but pleasant, so nice that after a while, he moaned.
"That's an excellent guess, Sherlock." Harry burst out laughing and blushed under the inquisitive and questioning gaze of the eight adults.
Harry's mouth formed a perfect "O" and he felt guilty. Then finally, he imagined the scene and he found it really funny so he burst out laughing. Draco gave him an amused smile as he felt the body beneath him shook with spasm. He laughed too, putting his head on Harry's chest. It was that moment that Ron chose to enter the room. He winced as he saw Draco on Harry and headed for his bed.
“I'm listening” Harry encouraged.
“I can feel some even when we don’t touch”
“So what does he have?” Harry asked, worried sick.
“You understood me very well” It turned out that the blond was as red as Harry. They stared at each other for a long moment, trying to understand the meaning of this conversation. Malfoy stirred slightly before resting his head on the pillow. Their two bodies were now stuck, Harry could feel each parcel of Draco's skin. He also rested his head on the pillow and his nose touched the blonde’s one, who looked at him with wide eyes. Harry ran his arm over Malfoy's back again, not knowing where to put it. The blond had now his eyes closed and Harry did the same, feeling suddenly exhausted. The last thing he knew before falling asleep was Malfoy's arm running down his back and bringing him closer to him, if that was still possible.
“What is this story of children, Harry? Dumbledore didn’t want to tell us anything” The three children approached them, along with Hermione, Ron, Blaise, and Theo. Upon seeing Dimitri, Remus opened his eyes.
“I can see!” Draco raised an eyebrow of misunderstanding.
Draco held Harry tighter against himself, wrapping his other arm around his waist as he whispered “Okay”.
Then, bodies fell from the ceiling, screaming. They all crashed on the ground and then the silence was back. Harry looked at them and they seemed unconscious. Four of them looked about around his age while the others looked like they were around 12 years old.
“It's obvious” Lyra and Erin replied as they arrived.
“Yes I am! You're just dirty Slytherins stealing my best friends and everyone thinks it's normal” He spat. The blond Slytherin raised an eyebrow of misunderstanding.
He suddenly had an idea and reversed their positions. He could clearly see in Draco's eyes that he didn’t understand what was going on. However, the blonde didn’t have time to ask even a question since Harry took his cock in him at once. Draco cried in pleasure while the brunette clenched his teeth in pain. Draco pulled him to kiss him passionately as he took his cock in hand to make him relax. Quickly, Harry began to moan and began to move back and forth by using his knees and then falling back, causing cries, both from him and Draco.
“I'll give him back to you” Nathaniel laughed and Lyra closed the door gently, leaving Jordan and Zach planted in the hallway. The black finally went to bed, leaving his brother alone in front of all these closed doors.
“How?” Harry asked, believing his godfather was dead. Dimitri just laughed lightly and he pushed Harry and Draco into their room before closing the door.
“Who's that person?” Draco whispered to Harry who jumped, not having heard him coming. He shrugged, having no idea.
“I think that's actually what happened” Harry glanced at the boys behind him as Draco pondered the meaning of his words. His son's four friends were hidden behind him. Jackson's blue eyes were wet and he was hiding behind his twin, who was hiding behind the Black-Snape twins. Emett's lower lip was shaking dangerously so Harry turned and lifted him into his arms. The little boy wrapped his legs and arms around him, and as soon as he lay his head against his neck, Harry felt tears running down his skin. He gently stroked the boy's back while glaring at Draco. The four boys stuck to him. Draco looked away, clearing his throat.
“I mean if you want to sleep here I can sleep in the Gryffindor’s dormitory” Draco froze as he understood that the other boy doesn’t want to sleep with him. He tried to hide his disappointment the best he could. He wasn't really surprised. Who would want to sleep with him? He was a fucking ex-deatheater after all. He went back to reality when Potter looked at him with his fucking too green eyes.
In the room they had just left, Hermione gazed at her two children, Eleanor and Joris. She was really overwhelmed by the blue of their eyes. Ron was out, unable to stand the sight of another of his children. He was not gay, damn it! Still, he had to admit that these kids looked just like him. He opened the door again suddenly.
“Eleanor and Joris are my children, and those of Theodo- I mean Nott” Ron had no reaction but stepped back and closed the door. Lyra, Ezekiel, Nathaniel and Erin came out of the room too, taking Blaise and Zachady with them. In the room, the atmosphere was slightly annoying and nobody dared to look at each other.
“Do you want a little presentation of the future families?” Hermione asked. Both adults nodded. Small groups formed.
“You will never imagine what just happened, Eh! What are you doing?” Ron asked as he entered the room as if it belonged to him. Draco, in a pure instinctive movement, had rocked them down the bed, Harry sitting on his hips then. Draco had his teeth planted in his hand to avoid moaning and Harry had his mouth open and his eyes closed.
“What are you doing?” Draco asked him. Harry turned again and Draco rested his head on his shoulder.
“Where is he?” Hary asked, a bit alarmed. He, Draco, Ezekiel and Alya seemed to be the only ones to notice so the four of them apparated away too.
“Hermione?” She raised her head and, understanding his question, opened her mouth, ready to explain.
“We already know the house” Ezekiel interrupted.
Draco thought about it for a second. He was tempted, very tempted. This was Harry, the man he’d been in love with for years, and he was telling him he loved Draco. He was saying he was sorry and Draco knew it was the truth because when had Harry ever lied. Harry was the most loyal and caring person Draco knew.
“We have to go” Harry said as there was another loud thud from the door. They ran to the stairs and as Harry about to climb up behind his children, he heard a sniff. He stopped himself in his track and went around the stairs. Lesath was sitting there, his knees up against his chest and tears streaming down his face.
“Then the only beaters we have are Joris and Dimi” Zach continued.
“Like why they look like Harry, why and how did they get there and other things like the little boy who called Harry Daddy”
“In pairs, you will practice spraying yourself with unformulated spells” The duets formed quickly. Harry and Ron, Hermione and Neville, Draco and Blaise and Pansy and Theo. The teacher let them started and Ron threw an expelliarmus to Harry. When Harry took his wand, for the first time in a while, it was reduced to ashes. He found himself with a pile of dust at his feet. He then followed his instinct and reached out his hand in front of him. A barely visible force field formed in front of him and Ron's spell rebounded on it and flew his wand that landed right in Harry's second hand. Ron looked at the brunette, totally amazed. Harry looked at Draco and saw a pile of ashes similar to his at his feet. Draco obviously did not have Harry's instinct and was trying to avoid Blaise's spells, which seemed to have a gift for the uninformed. Other Slytherin students, having noticed that Draco could not defend himself, began to approach him, looking menacing. Draco tried to defend himself by threatening them, promising them a thousand sufferings. But nothing worked, they raised their wand. Harry felt his fingers itch and when he looked at them, he saw sparks at the end of his fingers. He approached and placed himself in front of Draco. With his left hand, he made a shield appear all around them and with his right hand he expelled all the Slytherins, who had just cast spells, at the other end of the room with a simple movement of the hand. He then lowered the shield and challenged all the others to attack him.
“You'll have to destroy all those items if you want to kill Voldemort forever” Lyra said.
As the wind raged around him, he heard the children screaming that they were forfeiting, still on the ground. Happy with his little demonstration, he left in the direction of the castle to tell the teachers that he wanted to go get the locket the next day. He arrived quickly in front of the gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore's office. He forced the gargoyle to rotate with his magic and climbed the steps two by two. He entered the office without even knocking.
“Great!” Harry exclaimed without asking for more. And while Draco was still staring at his mother and a sweet smile was sitting on his lips, Harry hugged his waist and rested his head on his shoulder. He pulled the tip of his tongue out of his mouth and licked his earlobe. The blond closed his eyes and moaned at this contact. Harry slid his hand under the table and put pressure on the blonde's resting dick. The latter squeaked and he opened his eyes blushing. Harry nibbled the lobe of his ear and Draco moaned as he closed his eyes. He opened his eyes and blushed even more as he fell into his mother's eyes.
“I was walking down the hall and I heard you whispering very discreetly”
“Harry?” Only a groan of pain answered him.
“That's enough!” He thundered. The four boys went silent immediately.
She also received millions of small gifts from her brothers and other children. It was almost the same for the other children. Lesath received a broom at his size. It was the same for the older ones who received scarves, books and gloves. Ascella received a new dress from her parents. Emett received a terribly soft blanket as he complained of being cold. The twins and Erin’s gifts were three brooms, the same ones they had in the future, Draco and Harry having played their last names to get them. The three children jumped into their arms, looking happy. Lyra had just asked for a list of books and nothing else.
“That's done” Eleanor happily informed.
“You want me to calm down?” Malfoy yelled with a slightly hysterical voice, louder than usual. Ron entered at that moment, violently opening the door.
“We won, didn’t we?” He finally asked, deciding that it was still one of the main issues. All the children, apart from the five little ones, burst out laughing.
“I want you” Draco whispered in his ear, causing chills down his spine.
“Potter, stop moving or I take my hand away and let you die” Harry looked at him and smirked.
“I’m not gonna eat at the Slytherin table!” Malfoy rolled his eyes.
“Are you calm?” Draco asked in a soft voice. He frantically nodded before plunging right back on the blonde's mouth. Draco turned his head and Harry ran aground on his cheek.
“Of course” They replied at the same time. The little one climbed the bed and came to snuggle between them.
“We just came to pick up the sleepers” Dimitri explained. Zachady took Emett and Ascella in his arms and he went upstairs. Joris pulled Lyra by the hand and he finally lifted her from the ground under the soft protests of the girl. Dimitri took Lesath in his arms and dragged as best he could a sleepy Ezekiel behind him. Alarik lifted Erin in his arms without waking her up. Nathaniel slowly opened an eye and saw Jordan in front of him.
“Get up, we're all waiting for you in the living room” Then on these words she left and closed the door. Harry turned his head to Malfoy, who was rubbing his wrist with his hand while grimacing.
“Hm, hm” Harry said absently. Draco tightened his fingers around Harry's thighs to get his attention. The brunette turned his green eyes to Draco and gave him a smile. The blond questioned him with his gaze, waiting for Harry to explain what he was thinking. The brunette thought for a long time, then finally a desperate look appeared on his face.
“It turns out he's not as stupid as we thought and I don’t know, his touch electrifies me. My heartbeat is accelerating when he's near me and I feel that urge to hug and kiss him absolutely all the time” Draco sliced his face down and looked slightly lost now. His friend had a tender, amused smile at the same time.
He finally removed the blond's shirt and let his hands slide down the pale chest of the Slytherin. The latter took off Harry’s T-shirt and Harry moaned when he came to kiss his neck. The brunette made Draco moan while stroking one of his nipples and he chuckled. The blonde glared at him and as he kissed Harry again, he applied a slight pressure to Harry's crotch with his knee. His reaction wasn’t long, he gasped and moaned indecently. Because of his groan, they didn’t hear the voices in the corridor.
"Bend down!" Draco frowned. "Bend down, I tell you!" at the agreement of Harry's urgent voice, Draco obeyed and a bludger went to the exact spot where his head was previously. Theo was wide-eyed.
“It seems to me that this is normal, their blood must be recognized, in a way”
“Thanks dad” Ezekiel said.
“I think you like me” Malfoy whispered, his lips almost touching Harry’s. Harry let his eyes flutter closed, not believing Draco Malfoy was on the verge of kissing him.
As Remus had predicted, the head of the family spent the entire meal lecturing them while Draco sarcastically commented on everything she said in Harry's head. Molly turned to Harry who had just giggled again and she glared at him.
“JORIS!” He shouted. The blonde appeared almost immediately at the door, pulling on a T-shirt.
“First, you said the he’s acting softly and men who only fuck another people don’t act softly” Pansy started.
“You’re serious? Stop it right now, Potter” His sentence was not as threatening as he thought, it was probably because he smiled and laughed lightly. Harry burst out laughing, proud of his little joke. He had added Snape to the image Draco had sent him and imposed it in the blonde's mind. He was laughing all the while and when the Professor Dumbledore crossed the hall, accompanied by Professor Snape, their laughter intensified.
“I have another present” Harry growled as he nibbled Draco's earlobe.
“If I win, I want you to think about the opportunity to consider getting to know Blaise, this guy is really fantastic” The redhead pouted a second before accepting, convinced that the Harry was going to lose. Unfortunately this was not the case. Draco had worked hard on learning the content of the bet and being an excellent player, he ended up putting the red in check.
“Why are you alone there Ron?” The redhead sighed then.
“Apparently” Harry replied with a sneer. Hermione, who didn’t want an argument to break out, asked the children if they could explain the situation to them.
“So, these explanations?” Lyra turned back to him, only noticing at that moment that her fathers were there. She walked over to him with a huge book and laid it on her lap.
“We'll get back to you later” Jasper finished, like a hirer. It made Blaise laugh and soon he was alone with Theo in the bathroom.
“Answer!” Alya shouted.
“What?” Harry asked.
Hermione and Ron had gone to ask permission to eat in the apartment. Blaise and Theo were doing a chess game in the first’s room. Pansy and Ginny, who were getting on strangely together, were ordering the elves for dinner. The children were therefore alone in the living room and the organization didn’t seem to be their main quality. Harry suddenly felt a kiss on his neck and shivered. He grabbed the hands on his waist and intertwined his fingers with Draco's.
“Lucius and I thought you'd like to fly around a bit” The adult told them. Harry and Draco frowned, where did that proximity came from?
“You want to know who our parents are” Nathaniel cut her off. The five of them nodded. To relax the tense atmosphere between Slytherin and Gryffindor, Lyra proposed that the parents tried to guess. They all nodded, after all that could bring them closer, all as they were. Hermione began by saying that Emett was Harry's son and Ron's son was Jordan. So they each went to their father, a smile on their lips.
“What’s horrible?” Harry asked, putting on his T-shirt that the blonde had thrown at him. Ron didn’t answer, staring at the floor and Draco realized he didn’t want to talk about it in front of him. He leaned over and kissed Harry before leaving the room massaging his lower back. Harry frowned as he saw him, wondering why.
“Oh sorry” Harry whispered quickly. The other boy mumbled something about gryffindors too early in the morning. Harry laughed slightly before coming out of the room. He closed the door and crossed the second room again and found himself again near the little blond. He picked him up again and went down the stairs. The brunette was only half astonished to find his best friend sitting at a table near the library. He approached, put Lesath on a chair and sat down at the table. Hermione looked up from her book and smiled at Harry.
When he got to the room, he threw Harry on the bed and settled between his legs. He let his tongue danced with Harry’s while passing his hands under his T-shirt. Harry straightened so he could take it off and he took the opportunity to remove the sweater from the blond. He then dropped back against the mattress, dragging Draco into his fall. His tongue entered his boyfriend’s mouth again, looking for his twin. They quickly removed the little clothes they had left, and it was breathless that Harry uttered words that Draco never thought he would hear.
“So we all agree?” Sirius asked. The meeting finally took place and in fact the plan hadn’t progressed since the last time. They agreed, nodding their heads. Harry pretended not to see the glow that shouted "No" in the gray eyes of his soul mate.
Harry did not see him, but Malfoy had a big smile on his face, if Potter thought he was being discreet by looking at him that way, he was more silly than he’d thought. Finally, Harry pulled on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt while Malfoy put on black jeans with a gray sweater, magnifying his eyes beautifully. Malfoy was walking towards the exit of the room and Harry remembered his new good resolution so he held the blonde by the wrist just before he opened the door. Malfoy turned to him, an eyebrow raised in wonder. Harry cleared his throat, uncomfortable.
“But you don’t look like him at all! And Harry would know if he had kids” Ron said.
The little boy's eyes widened and he suddenly burst into tears. Everyone remained frozen in front of the crying child, absolutely not knowing what to do. He cried louder and louder, making students turning in the corridor. He would have kept crying for a while if the blond girl, who was now in front of them, had not arrived. She was a blonde girl of fifteen or sixteen years old, according to Harry's deductions. She had the little one in her arms, who was slowly calming down. She then gave them a small smile before disappearing at the corner of the corridor. They finally arrived in front of the Great Hall. They came to their seats at the Gryffindor table, but as Harry lifted his leg to the other side of the bench, he was shoved by a Gryffindor who seemed to be in third year. He nearly fell but caught himself on Ron's shoulder. The boy wanted to continue on his way but an icy voice sounded throughout the great hall.
“I mean Lucius, your father, walks around the castle and apparently is angry because he can’t find you” Draco blanched considerably.
“Erika! You had been told not to say it” The girl looked at her brother with a guilty look.
“I... Voldemort started sending me pictures again... And probably read my mind and know for you because in those pictures you were dying” His voice broke on the last word and new tears ran down his cheeks. He tightened his arms around Draco while sniffing. The blond turned around and hugged him. He came to caress his hair, whispering comforting words.
“I ... uh ...” Draco stammered. Harry turned around, ready to go. Draco didn’t know what to do to stop him so he let Harry go through the door.
The older three, Zachady, Lyra and Dimitri, took the lead in team training.
“Especially powerful emotions?” Harry nodded. “I think it's normal then” Harry was relieved.
“Sit up, please” She said as she forced Draco to sit on his own bed. “I will tell how we see that he loves you” He nodded and looked at her with wide eyes, listening with great attention. Blaise stood up beside Pansy as she hardly tried to make a list in her head of the proof that Potter loved Draco.
“Then we're getting ready and we're going” He announced while standing up and leaving Dumbledore's office almost running.
So he convinced himself that Harry can shag him again, if only for the reason that he fucks him so well. Maybe it was just sex for Harry, great sex at that, so who is Draco to say no to a good fucking with the Boy-Who-Lived.
“I don’t love you either” He huffed in voice as cold as he could muster, but Potter was already undressing him.
“Of course not” Blaise suddenly stopped near them, holding the quaffle in his hands.
“He's fine, he's got a spell that opened him and drained half of his blood, but we closed the wounds so he just has to rest” Lucius interjected calmly. Draco nodded again.
“We’re thinking that because it’s really obvious, darling” Pansy said as Draco started to walk by the room, thinking about all these things.
“When I tell you that Emett is in love with Jack”
“I know it's hard to believe, but yes” Lyra, who seemed to be the spokesperson for the small group, said.
“It feels good to see you again, uncle Siri” Sirius's eyes widened. Remus asked them to return to the classroom as the other students arrived, thus preserving their privacy. Before they all got in, Draco held Harry by the arm.
“When you touch each other, you can feel the emotions of the other” Harry leaned closer to her and whispered.
"Why does she stares at us like this?" Draco asked.
“Are you crazy?” Draco exclaimed as he sat up, his eyes wide open. “I’m not going to say anything, Pansy” She sighed and sat up too.
Harry fell down on his bed without any gracefulness. His day had been exhausted. He crossed his arms behind his head and sinked into his memories of the day, hoping to figure out what the fuck had happened all day long. He thought about the morning potion class first.
“You'll pay me for that, Potter” Draco told him. Harry snorted.
“Get up boys!” Molly exclaimed in a voice that Draco found very unpleasant as she entered the room. She made a movement with her wand and the light came on suddenly. The three Slytherins straightened together as Harry lay flat on the floor.
“Why do you look about to faint?” Alya asked Draco. She was perfectly right, since at the moment he was going to answer that he didn’t feel very well, he fainted. The two boys rushed at him and put him on the bed next to Harry. Nathaniel rushed to the floor below to pick up the other family members.
“I bet it's Aunt Mione” Zachady shouted behind Blaise. He shut the door of his room and entered the Malfoy Potter's. He also closed that door and flung himself on the mattress next to Draco who had a hand under Harry's T-shirt. Theo and Hermione moved to the other side of Draco and Pansy settled between Hermione's legs, herself between Theo's.
“Then we thought of coming to see dad so here we are” The first finished. Dimitri ruffled their hair and then went back to his research.
“Do you mean right now, or in a more general evil way?”
“So...how do you take it for you and Granger?” His friend turned a surprised look at him and then glanced at Hermione, in the stands with Lyra, Eleanor and Alarik.
“A misunderstanding ? A misunderstanding ! Tell me right now that I'm wrong while you're there.” Harry got even more angry and even jostled the blonde. Draco opened his mouth to explain but the brunette didn’t let him.
“Yes you're right, please go on” He gave a small smile to his boyfriend, beating his eyelashes excessively. The latter shook his head exasperatedly but he couldn’t help but smile. He turned his gaze back to the brunette.
“Is Blaise your father?” The boy smiled and nodded sharply.
“But what are you waiting for? Tell him everything, you're not going to risk losing him to keep his gift a secret” Lyra told him.
“Beautiful” Theo finally breathed. Hermione blushed even more.
He let himself be dragged into the next room and welcomed in his arms Erika. With his free hand he briefly rubbed his lower back again. He really needed to seriously look for the reason for this pain. He saw the oldest of his children staring at him, then they exchanged glances before smiling at him. He frowned. His children had seen that he was suffering and they seemed to rejoice.
The girl rushed to her two brothers and the triplets hugged each other for a long time. Draco suddenly felt his head spinning. He frowned, it was barely more than ten minutes since he had touched Harry. He went to the stairs and immediately went to their bathroom, where Harry was. He found him sitting in the bathtub, the water running over him abundantly.
“Zabini’s nice, Harry! It's a catastrophe!” The redhead lamented, letting himself fall on the bed, face against the mattress. Harry giggled at seeing his desperate friend trying to choke himself.
Draco nodded to Harry, indicating that he was taking care of this and that Harry could continue. The brunette then took it in his mouth at once and Draco narrowly stopped from shouting his pleasure. The door opened suddenly and Blaise came in to go to the sink. He entered so discreetly that the two boys didn’t hear him. Draco bit violently in his hand as he arched and pushed his nails into Harry's shoulder as he came. The blonde slid down the cold wall and Harry came to kiss him when he was at his level. Draco was out of breath and had red cheeks out of pleasure.
“And you, Aunt Mione and Uncle Ron found it around Dolores Umbridge's neck” Harry paled when he heard that.
“What if we go to see the dorms now?” He asked. So they went up the stairs and came down a long corridor. They advanced to a dark door on their left. They stopped and looked at the door. It was a simple black door where two names were inscribed. The letters were silver and it was written ‘Malfoy-Potter’. Zabini chuckled.
“A soul mates bond” All the teenagers of that time stared at Nathaniel with round eyes while Ezekiel and Lyra said a simple “Oh yes! That's it”
Potter parted those beautiful lips of his and Draco felt his dick slide slowly into that hot, slick mouth. Potter curled his tongue around Draco and he started to suck him hard, cheeks hollowing and taking him deep. The brunette sucked him so beautifully. ‘Merlin, how the fuck does he know how to do this so well?’ The thought crossed Draco’s mind briefly before giving into the sensations surrounding him. He moaned loudly when Harry’s tongue slid into his slit on top of his dick, tonguing him as his fingers caressed Draco’s testicles. ‘Oh Merlin, this is so good’, is all Draco can think. The blonde slid one hand into Potter’s unruly hair while the other pressed against the wall behind him to prevent his trembling legs from giving way to the ground.
“You okay?” He asked. Jordan simply nodded but he was holding really hard to Nathaniel. Harry had recovered a bit at that moment, now that he was relieved and reassured about Jordan. There was a loud noise against the door, like something crashing on it.
“You should go eat your last peach jam sandwich before your coffee gets colder.” Harry raised a surprised eyebrow that Malfoy did not see as he had his head down. The brunet shrugged his shoulders.
“Another of our children came to visit us and it seems that she met Grandpa Lu”
“So, if you want to have fun on a private Quidditch pitch, you get up and come with us before Molly gets up and sequestrates you for another day”
“Ah Harry, you're here! I'd like to talk to you about something serious” He nodded, ready to listen. “My behavior has been unacceptable these past few days and I'm really sorry, sweetheart” Molly whispered, tears in her eyes. Harry didn’t know what to do or what to answer.
“No” He laughed.
“Why would it be a disaster, Ron?” The redhead lifted his head, glaring at his friend before plunging back into the blankets.
“He's a nice guy now” Harry informed him.
"Stop panicking like that and come down, I'm sure you're gorgeous" Draco's voice encouraged him. Harry allowed himself a smile and went down the few steps that separated him from the entrance hall and thus from the gigantic living room where their little party would take place. Draco suddenly appeared in front of him as he stepped on the floor of the hallway. Draco smiled as he wrapped Harry within his arms. He kissed Harry's neck, licked the lobe of his ear and whispered.
“No, I can’t believe it! You and Potter?” The blond blushed even more.
“There is name on the door now” They all looked at him.
“Just before I fainted, I heard Nathaniel say that they knew it was going to happen” Draco looked at him sharply.
“And that's my brother, Jasper” He stated, pointing to his, obviously, twin brother with brown eyes. Draco chuckled, twins again. Behind the Zabini-Weasley twins stood another pair of twins.
“It's time for breakfast, Daddy.” The little one now had a big smile on his face as he stared at his two fathers. They had not moved and did not know what to say to the boy. He then stepped forward and grabbed the hands of the two boys and ran out of the room, pulling them behind him. They both looked incomprehensively at the other occupants of the room. And they just shrugged and laughed. Harry stopped suddenly.
“You’re together, right?” Nathaniel's cheeks turned red while a smug smile played on Jordan's lips. Their eyes met and Harry drew his own conclusion as he did not expect any response from them. He glanced at Ron, who seemed to be split between shock and disgust. He also felt disgust, but towards his friend. Time passed slowly, Harry and Ron waiting patiently for the conversation to resume. Their long wait came to an end when the door swung open, letting in the boy who had shoved Harry into the hall. He went to them angrily and sat down without any delicacy beside Nathaniel. He huffed as he folded his arms across his chest and glared at what was in front of him, in this case, the armrest of the sofa where Harry and Ron were.
“We’re listening” The triplets declared in the same threatening voice.
“It's all there” Harry's eyes widened as he saw the book.
“Yes, they are. And this little boy is even more so” She chuckled. Lucius gave up, seeing that it was useless to fight.
“No, I just checked that I did not rape you” Draco - Harry thought he could call him by his first name since they were almost naked in a bed - laughed again and murmured a sentence that Harry did not understand.
“DADDY!” Draco's blood froze as he recognized his daughter's voice. He had the bad feeling that a very bad thing was happening. He accelerated then. At that moment, Harry appeared above him, screaming in pain. Erin was flying at full speed right behind him, trying to catch him. Given the speed with which the girl was going, it was quickly clear in Draco's mind that she would never be able to not crash into the floor and judging by Alarik's yell in the stands, he had reached the same conclusion.
"Go against the wall, please" Harry asked mentally. Draco complied and headed for the far wall, taking Hermione with him. The other children also stepped back, so Harry found himself walking alone toward the library while the others held their breaths on the other side of the room. A second cry came as Harry was against the library. He thought he recognized Emett's voice. He didn’t have time to think about it any longer as an explosion blew up behind the wall and propelled Harry through the room. Draco squeezed Hermione's hand violently as a violent pain spread throughout his body. He fell to his knees, shouting. Hermione scooted down in front of him.
Lyra was heard struggling violently but he silenced her quickly. It was about time that Draco realized that Harry only had pants on him. He pushed the door with his fingertips and pushed Harry harshly against it as soon as it closed. He first kissed him softly and Harry took advantage of the situation, biting the blond a little too violently against the door. Draco saw the teasing gleam in Harry's eyes. Harry placed his lips on the blonde's and quickly he slid his tongue against his twin. The kiss quickly grew louder than it did at first, and Harry forced himself to stop as he was about to remove Draco's sweater. The latter groaned with discontent.
“I understand, redhead and blond are not at all good together” Draco then intervened a few seconds after he had apparated. The girl opened her mouth in an outraged and vexed expression.
“Now, what have you done to them?” Harry asked.
“But since when are they together?” Jordan asked, surprised.
Then, after a while, Draco had enough, so he grabbed Harry’s hips and slammed him against the mattress. He then began to come and go in Harry and he began to shout his name every time he hit his prostate. Harry grabbed his hair with one hand to kiss him while the second scratched his back. Harry then cried in a hoarse scream, and Draco followed him closely, feeling the brunette’s flesh tighten around his penis. He fell into a long groan on Harry, who immediately wrapped his arms around him. He slowly withdrew from the brown and threw them a cleaning spell. He snuggled into Harry’s arms again and they both fell asleep, even though it was four o'clock in the afternoon.
“I love you Draco” Harry said, chuckling again. Draco took one of the sweets and put it in his mouth.
“And for the houses?” He asked after a moment.
"Yeah, Harry, does something make you laugh?" Draco smiled an amused smile as he saw the scene.
“The day? It happens to us all the time” Emett explained.
“All right” Harry answered, staring at the hole in the library wall.
“What if you continue this conversation later and elsewhere? For example, I don’t know, somewhere else than in the middle of the Great Hall” She whispered. Harry turned his gaze and could see that absolutely the whole room was watching them. He released Malfoy then and turned to face the table. He walked over it and settled in his place, between Hermione and Ginny.
“He's worried because you're moving away from him right now” Nathaniel informed him.
“Why were we only five to be summoned?” The Headmaster smiled softly.
He nibbled the thin skin lightly and Harry groaned again. Draco smiled in his neck, his moans were really exciting. He then passed his tongue over Harry’s earlobe and the moan that escaped his mouth was louder. The blonde then dropped his hand down Harry's body and stroked his cock through the fabric of his boxer. The brunette suddenly arched with an indecent moan. Draco shuddered and felt his erection hardening even more.
“Yes! I see perfectly well!” Draco frowned.
“You've been missing for several hours”
“It's okay Harry”
"It's Draco now?” Harry just blushed, not knowing what to say. “Yes, I think it's going to happen Harry. I also think that a psychic connection could possibly be established between you” Harry had an expression of incomprehension on the face.
“So, Ron, how are you doing in your research?” The redhead groaned.
The smell of alcohol hit Draco from that close and he sighed loudly.
“The blond one” Ron and Harry snickered, the hair color of Malfoy's potential son was not really surprising. Hermione's doubts increased. That little blond boy had called Harry as well as Malfoy daddy. Either this little boy had confused them, which greatly surprised Hermione, or he called everyone Daddy. She thinks about it more intensely, and then finally decides that the problem wasn’t there. The problem was that no one seemed to think it was strange that children coming out of nowhere looked a lot like them and called them daddy. When she came back to reality, the tone had gone up between the three boys, especially between Ron and Malfoy. Harry seemed to be content to listen to them with an amused or even a fond air. She sighed and decided to stop them.
“He is denying us, right?” The blond laughed, shaking his head. Joris and Lyra finally came back to the group and the two blondes hugged each other. The youngest girl looked at the hands of her fathers.
Harry was now in front of the gargoyle that led to Dumbledore's office and hesitated to give the password. He heard hurried steps coming towards him. Soon he saw Alarik running towards him, his big brother following him from afar as he walked. Alarik grabbed his wrist and dragged him into an empty classroom. Dimitri closed the door with a spell when he arrived.
“These eleven children are yours, so I didn’t see any point in warning the whole castle” Draco nodded and the three wizards in the room left to find the others waiting down the stairs. Dumbledore took the lead and they all followed him. Harry had joined Ron and Hermione who were chatting with Nathaniel and his boyfriend. They walked a few minutes before the older one stopped in front of an empty wall. A door slowly appeared on the wall and the Professor McGonagall came out of it. With a wand, Dumbledore showed two statues representing the two founders. He walked over to them and pronounced the password.
“But that's what you do” Draco replied.
“This plan is for several purposes. Goal #1: My parents really want to sleep together but there's always something that interrupts them so we're going to make sure this is the right party because my birthday comes in just over nine months and if my dad do not fall pregnant quickly, I will disappear. Goal # 2: We must succeed in isolating Uncle Blaise and Uncle Ron to rush things a bit because again, Zach you may soon disappear. Goal # 3: Let's have a little fun before this war breaks out for good” They all looked at each other knowingly and then slapped their hands.
“He must be at the astronomy tower” He whispered in his ear. Harry washed himself with a bound and ran out of the room. Ezekiel had whispered loud enough that they all heard.
Then, suddenly, Harry's eyes opened wide. Draco saw him through his tears and Harry straightened up immediately, no longer having any trace of any injury, other than the blood that covered his chest. Draco threw himself on him, still shaking and sobbing and Harry squeezed his arms around the blonde. They stayed a long time like this, until the Slytherin calmed down and when that was the case, Harry pushed him slightly away from him and wiped the tears off his face. Draco smiled and stood up, extending a hand to Harry, to help him up. No sooner was he standing than Draco flung himself against him again, clutching his arms around him compulsively. Harry ran a hand through his blond hair and whispered that he was okay in Draco's ear. The latter slowly calmed down and then pushed his face away from Harry's neck.
The brunette pushed him away and stood up to him and Draco could see in his eyes that he was really hurt and angry.
He just nodded. He then felt Harry move slightly, moaning. He looked down at him and saw that he was frowning in his sleep. He thought that he was having a nightmare and when the image of Harry's broom being hit by lightning came into his mind, he knew he was right. Apparently they could also share their nightmares. He looked for a soothing and happy image to impose on Harry's mind to replace his nightmare and he opted for them both hugging their six children in a collective hug on the Quidditch pitch. The brunette's face relaxed immediately and Draco was delighted to have managed to chase away his nightmare.
“Nothing, everything is fine” He muttered. Draco was not fooled but he did not ask for more details and Harry was grateful. Draco let go and as he was going to talk, the door opened slowly, revealing eight heads. Harry allowed them to enter by the look. They entered, invading the room.
When Molly had left, feeling much better, Draco had taken her place, seeming to be the only one able to calm Harry. That night, she allowed them to sleep together, and they held back to tell her that they hadn’t waited for her to do so.
Harry straightened the handle of his broomstick and flew to the sky, towards the snitch. He conjured up a bouncing magical barrier to prevent his friends from crashing to the ground, since from what he’d seen, they wouldn’t be able to recover in time.
Harry was kneeling on the floor and looking under his bed when Draco came back from the bathroom to his room. He glanced around the room and stopped dead when he saw Harry's position. Now his eyes were on Harry, especially on his arse, and Ron was boggling at that sight. The redhead decided he'd better get out of the room when he saw Draco bite his lip and start walking into the room. No sooner had he closed the door, than Ginny and Pansy fell on him to drag him into the room opposite.
The next day, when Harry opened his eyes, he had an incredible headache. He straightened up hardly in his bed and laid his bare feet on the ground, which sent a cold draft into his body and slightly calmed his headache. He rubbed his eyes and jumped slightly when the bathroom door opened and closed abruptly. He opened his eyes at once, ready to violently reprimand the jerk who had dared to make his headache worse. But he was shocked when his eyes fell on Draco Malfoy coming out of the bathroom, only wearing a towel around his waist. His hair was still wet and drops of water were streaming down his finely muscled chest. Harry was staring at the blonde and Malfoy finally realized it. He stared at him too.
“Are we going to disappear?” Harry asked innocently.
“Are you going to watch your son being touched?” Lucius asked. Narcissa laughed slightly.
“Are you feeling better?” He asked his blond father. Draco hurried to reassure him, seeing the worry in the boy's gray eyes.
“There’s nothing between me and Dimitri” He answered as he looked away, in Dimitri’s direction.
“It's possible” Draco smiled and gave a light tap on his friend's shoulder.
“How can you know where Malfoy is?” Hermione asked.
“I'd like to talk to you later Harry, sweetheart” Harry was surprised at the tone used but withdrew from commenting and just nodded.
“It's obvious” Harry replied, laughing.
“Your parents didn’t teach you politeness!? One knocked before entering” The young man smirked as his father lost his temper.
“Yes, with an interlocked M and P!” Harry laughed. Draco was still looking at the locket, which he had laid flat in the palm of his hand.
“Too many to think straight, not enough not to know what I’m doing”
“It was during a discussion between brothers, it is only me, Ezé and Zéniel who knows” Nathaniel answered. She looked angry and he pulled childishly his tongue at her.
“Are you ok?” Draco asked, his jaw tight from pain. Harry realized it and immediately worried.
“Excuse me, Professor” Hermione began. “Where are we exactly?” Dumbledore smiled gently and cleared his throat.
“You'll need us, or at least one of us” Nathaniel exclaimed delightedly.
Nathaniel yawned for the fourth time in a row.
“Sit down, Ron, before you get madder” Hermione told him. He obeyed and sat down next to Harry, as if to watch him.
“I was angry, and you were too” Harry continued, his voice louder now. “And I know you were angry because of me, because I’m never careful on missions and almost always get injured. But I love you and I’m sorry I said you were selfish”
“Ok, but what are these observations?” Nathaniel, who was more than fed up with it to get answers, finally asked.
“Harry, it's horrible... oh by Merlin!” He exclaimed, seeing his best friend only in jeans, Draco between his thighs. Draco moaned in frustration and straightened up. He sat on the bed and looked around the room for their T-shirt. Harry cleared his throat, uncomfortable.
“If we had doubts about your story, we have no more” Malfoy glared at him.
“It's you, isn’t it?” Harry growled.
“Well, it's not that we don’t have fun here, but it's, what, 4am so now everyone is going to bed” Zach almost ordered. Lyra pulled Nathaniel by the arm since he was literally glued to Jordan. The latter rolled his eyes before releasing the blond.
He did not lose hope, however, and thought he might do something. He decided to follow his instinct. He rolled up his sleeves and literally tore off Harry's clothes. The brunette was then shirtless and Draco panicked even more, if it was possible, when he saw all the blood flowing from the wound.
“He went to talk with Draco, as he seems to be the problem here”
“What?” He asked. That's when the three Malfoys came into the office and Draco burst out laughing under the surprised look of his parents, who were not used to seeing their son laugh that way.
Harry stayed silent, wondering why he was such a fucking idiot.
“Family meeting? And no one warned me?” He joked. He also hugged his brothers.
The latter came to seize the blonde’s hand and brought it to his mouth. He introduced two fingers into his mouth and licked them conscientiously. Draco thought he was going to come on the spot watching him do it. Finally, Draco retrieved his hand and pulled it down to introduce one of his fingers into Harry’s intimacy. The latter began to moan only after a few movements. Harry started waving his hips and moaning louder as Draco introduced a second and then a third finger. Harry screamed as Draco hit his prostate with his fingers.
“Professor Dumbledore, you know what these objects are and how to destroy them, don’t you?” Harry asked.
“Jordan came to sleep with Nath, and Lyra is shouting at them” the boy explained, as if it were obvious. Dimitri retreated until he could pass the door of his head.
“What's going on here, by Merlin?” the newcomer asked. Against all odds, Lesath jumped out of bed.
“Yeah” They all answered at the same time.
“Yes, really” Blaise and pansy answered.
“That’s Adhara, her sister” Nathaniel said. Harry and Draco nodded.
“Okay, come here” Harry said as he knelt down. He took the boy in his arms and ran upstairs. Alya and Ezekiel were waiting for him at the top of the stairs. They widened their eyes when they saw Lesath.
“Who are you exactly?” Ron asked them roughly. The two concerned looked at each other and appeared to have a silent conversation for a few seconds.
“It's okay, it's not as bad as I thought” Ron grumbled.
“These two have not gone to bed yet, it's amazing.” Malfoy sneered. Harry and Hermione laughed with him but were stopped when the door opened and shut in a loud crash. Ron was now in front of them, a murderous look in his face and Malfoy felt two arms curl around his leg.
“What the fuck are you doing, Malfoy?” Harry didn’t saw it but Draco flinched as he felt Harry's breath in his neck.
“We're not stealing anyone, Ron” Blaise, who was standing in the doorway, interjected. The redhead then rushed on Theo who narrowly avoided him. Blaise grabbed him and went out holding Ron against him. The door closed slowly and Theo turned to Hermione, who had red cheeks.
“We just wanted to check on you all because it’s been hours since you left” Harry nodded again. Emerik brushed passed him, shoving him aside to kneel in front of a boy. They were all starting to wake up by now. The boy reached up to touch Emerik cheek as he sighed.
“So, what’s the reason for this family reunion?” He asked as he entered the room. The conversations stopped when he entered.
Maybe there was no reasons other than Malfoy himself, Harry thought. After all, he’d always felt drawn to the blond. Following him everywhere and always thinking about him these past few months maybe wasn’t due to Malfoy being up to something bad. Harry suddenly
“I love you” Harry repeated as he looked up at him and Draco noticed the tears in his eyes were running down his cheeks.
“One of them will somehow isolate Dad in one corner of his body while the second will cast a death spell on the Horcrux”
“Sirius and the others must have arrived by now” Harry replied with a shrug. As if to confirm his words, Lesath screamed in his high-pitched voice in the next room.
“Is it me, or does everyone go upstairs after talking to us?” Harry asked.
“You're looking at his ass like a dog is watching a piece of meat” The redhead laughed. Harry couldn’t contradict him so he just laughed nervously.
“I have something very important to tell you” He began solemnly.
“He said Oh my god” Harry explained, shoving his head through the curtain. Blaise jumped, he then took the time to spit his toothpaste and rinse his mouth before turning around.
“Why can’t you kill me now?” Harry asked.
“Can I play?” Their son asked, eyes sparkling with excitement at the thought of a new game.
“Relax Potter! I just watched you a little.” Harry felt his cheeks warming up, a sign that he was blushing.
“Ginny” He warned in a deep, dark voice. She refused to stray for a few seconds and then finally released Harry.
“Morning, love” Draco said softly, placing small kisses all over his face. Harry's smile widened and he opened his eyes again.
“There are far too many unclear things in this story” Draco interjected. The others could only agree with that. Suddenly, the door opened, revealing a tall blue-eyed blonde Harry had never seen.
Harry concentrated with all his might to not yawn at the late or rather early hour. Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy wanted to meet the children that night. In the living room, there was only Harry, Draco, their seven children, Lucius and Narcissa. In fact, most children slept, even if they had stayed. Lesath slept in Harry's arms, Emett had his head on his knees and his legs were lying on the end of the sofa Harry had enlarged. Ezekiel and Nathaniel were sitting between their parents and Ezekiel had his head resting on Draco's shoulder while Nathaniel had his on Harry’s. Lyra was sitting next to Draco and was not sleeping yet. Erin slept, her head on her sister's shoulder, and Ascella had her head on Draco's lap.
“Were not you supposed to go back to the Gryffindor Tower?”
“Maybe I like him, but it doesn’t matter” He said after a silence and then he got up and went to another corner in the room. Harry frowned but didn’t follow him. Something was wrong on Zephir’s side and he wanted to find out what.
“Oh really?” Draco mumbled, still traumatized by the sight of a Harry bathing in his own blood and dying slowly. Harry suddenly saw a picture of him bathing in his blood. He made a good step back and nearly fell off the bench.
He realized quickly that he’d have to join or be bored. He decided to join, thinking that he could probably try to know what Malfoy was really up to while he was at it. He took a step forward as he took his shirt off and stepped out of his trousers. He kept his glasses on and stepped in the water.
“I don’t bother you too much I hope!” Severus almost yelled, unhappy to be ignored in his own apartments. They turned to him.
“He kiss you when you’re about to have sex and even during you fuck” Pansy said. “There are a lot of things like that Draco”
“Hold on!” He shouted running to catch up with him.
“You know what? You go see him right now and you just ask him, just the two of you” The boy seemed to hesitate for a second and then nodded. Harry put him on the ground and let him go. The boy ran to the stairs and a tender smile spread on Harry’s lips. He was still mad at Draco, like super mad but he still loved him so his happiness was what mattered.
“I won’t be able to do this before a moment” Draco justified himself. Harry smiled and placed his lips on the blonde's. They then separated and got off the train while keeping a reasonable distance between them. Molly threw herself on Harry and nearly choked him by hugging him. Harry coughed and was released only when Emett intervened.
“Oh please” A voice snorted from the corridor before he could answer. “He just don’t wanna go where Potter is” The voice finished when he walked in the room. It was Blaise, Draco noticed with a groan of frustration. “In case he can’t restrain himself and jumps on him, you know” He finished, a charming smile and a wink in direction of his mother.
“He didn’t want me, he said that redhead isn’t his style”
“But I can see where Potter's hand is from where I am” Narcissa laughed again.
“I think this one is mine” Malfoy said, pointing to Lesath, still in Lyra's arms. This was indeed the case but the child preferred to stay in the arms around him. Zabini frowned as he looked at each person in the room. Then an illumination seemed to be in his mind.
“Er... because... because... because it's a game!” Harry replied again with a tense smile. Draco laughed silently at the absurdity of this excuse.
“It's going to hurt” He warned Harry before grabbing the wooden handle and tugging at it. Harry's scream froze his blood, more so. He tossed the piece of wood away and in front of the size of the piece, the crowd in the bleachers uttered a new cry of horror. Harry choked on himself even more and Draco looked in horror at all the blood flowing from the wound. With trembling hands he tried to contain the blood but quickly his hands were covered and sobs escaped his throat.
“The others want you downstairs” They both nodded and Harry went to pick him up before taking Draco’s hand. They went down like that, hand in hand with Harry holding Lesath.
“You’re not making this wall explode, Ezé” She warned him
With a wave of his hand, he formed a large square with the tables while Draco made chairs appear with a movement of his hand as well. Eleanor sighed.
“I think the game will be tomorrow in the afternoon because we are Saturday tomorrow. So...” Erin could not finish her sentence. She was cut by a blow to the door. The door then opened on a Draco and a Harry kissing breathlessly. Harry slammed Draco against the closed door. He kissed his neck, nibbling at the thin skin and began sliding his hands under the blonde's sweater, who dropped his head against the door, leaving more access to his neck.
Flashback
“Come home with me?” Harry asked, looking up hopefully at Draco. “I’ll make it up to you, I promise”
“Too bad for you isn’t it?” Harry growled from his spot, looking at his options.
“Nath, Ezé and Jordan form a better team” Alarik said.
“The blond boy and two other brunettes” Draco explained. The twins smirked.
“So I said, Jordan and Irina and Isallys. It's Eleanor and Joris, my children. Then we have Dimitri, Alarik and Erika, your children Sirius. And finally, Seth, your son Remus” The older two seemed completely lost. Sirius stared at Alarik and suddenly he blinked, seeming to realize the identity of his other parent.
“Sorry you had to saw that” Harry offered a slight smile to his son.
“It looks like there's a family reunion here” He smiled charmingly at the gathering and Lyra ran out to him, throwing herself on his neck.
“You guess well” whispered a male voice behind them. The two sisters jumped and turned, widening their eyes, having recognized the voice.
He put the bottle down and walked to the door. When he opened it, his mouth fell open in shock and disbelief. Harry was standing there, his green eyes too bright behind his glasses. Draco noticed there were tear stains on his cheeks as well as some more tears ready to fall out of his eyes.
“I'm not going to hurt you, just tell me why you did that and what exactly did you do?” He heard the redhead swallow loudly.
“If you ever feel bad, you just have to come over and scream at me, nobody will find that weird” He whispered in Harry's ear.
“Looking like us? What do you mean by that?” Ron asked.
“I want you to make peace with Malfoy, Harry. It is important for our cohabitation that the atmosphere is relaxed. And above all, Harry, these kids are used to seeing their parents happy together so it's imp-”
“I have no idea who your parents are to be honest.” Alarik nodded with a smile.
“One of the five kids over there called me daddy," He said, pointing to the five little ones in a corner. This announcement began to raise some doubts in Hermione's mind.
Pansy sighed and pushed him further on his bed. Blaise and her hopped on it to sat across Draco. He could feel the horrible conversation coming his way.
"Please..." Draco sobbed his voice rasping as he thrust his hips up. Harry gasped and moaned loudly, his hand was speeding up around them, the pleasure becoming too much for the both of them.
idea. Everyone seemed to think about it for a second before they all nodded.
“Already, I don’t plan to leave you, it’s absolutely not in my projects and it will never be. Then I admit I've been a little away from you in the last few days, and I'm really sorry about that, but I was busy” They were now in the middle of the living room and Harry turned abruptly to him.
“We'll have to start tomorrow, so we've destroyed the maximum before he attacks the castle” Nathaniel explained.
Then he frowned as he felt Harry loosen his arms. He pushed him away from him again and saw Harry barely conscious in front of him. He worried immediately. The brunette then coughed hard and blood came out of his mouth. Draco's eyes widened in horror and he swung like an arrow to the ground. He laid Harry in the sand and immediately the white sand was tinged with an alarming red. Cries of horror rose from the crowd as five people screamed “Daddy!” in panic. Draco was just as panicked and it worsened when he saw the source of the problem: the end of Harry's broom handle was deep in his stomach. Harry choked again and he spat blood again. Draco's hands began to shake violently and tears began to flow from his eyes.
Flashback
“What are they doing?”
“Are there others?” They asked at the same time.
“Tell me more” Dimitri begged.
The books were all stacked and there was a gaping hole in the wall. There was no one in the room so he walked to the opening and was stunned to find another room on the other side. He stepped over what was left of the wall and looked carefully around him. It was a small room that looked more like a hallway than a real room. He saw that the explosion seemed to be coming from the wall at the back, so he approached it.
"We have eleven kids" Harry thought suddenly. The blonde almost choked.
“I’ll send you a note, okay?” He asked as his put his shirt on. Harry nodded, still embarrassed and then Draco went out of the room, leaving Harry alone. He walked slowly to the dungeon, trying not to run to his friends because, GOD he needs to talk about Potter with them. Maybe he could tell them that Potter was acting a little more gently each day.
“What are you doing here anyway?” Harry asked, because they arrived at the perfect time.
“Harry?” The dark-haired man looked up at him and Draco could see his bright eyes and tears on his cheeks. He strode over to him and tried to take him in his arms.
“You’re okay” The boy whispered. Emerik nodded and laid his head down on the boy’s shoulder.
In fact there were several. First, adults who were on the trip had clearly told them that Molly was only aware that children of the future were present but their parents had not been specified. They had also insisted that the truth should be told delicately. And Harry felt it was going to be hard and he didn’t have the time or the urge to pretend.
“Who is Zephir?” Harry asked.
“I said, you love him” Draco shook his head.
“To facilitate your understanding, I must show you. If you please” He said to them, showing the door with his hand. Hermione, Ron and Zabini got up first and went down the stairs. The blond girl then got up and took the little blond boy in her arms, she also grabbed the second boy's hand. She walked out the door, the three little girls following her. The four boys who had knocked on the door of the potion class then got up with a laugh, followed by Emett. The only ones that were remaining in the office were Harry and Malfoy, accompanied by Dumbledore.
“I... yes everything’s fine” Harry tried to reassure him by offering a smile. Draco was not fooled but feeling that he would probably faint in a few minutes, he undressed under Harry's greedy eye. He slipped into the bathtub and he slid between Harry's legs.
"I'd say it's because a perfect replica of you is in my arms" Draco chuckled in his corner and Molly looked at him questioningly so he calmed down.
“I’m checking something” Malfoy said in a low voice, his breath falling against Harry’s lips. “Something I think about you” He was progressing toward Harry as he talked and stopped when their chest touched. Harry’s heart was beating so fast he feared the other boy could feel it.
“Put on a T-shirt” He ordered. The brunette rolled his eyes but did so. The children laughed and Erin glanced at them in a way that Harry didn’t understand but that everyone else understood as a warning about the secret of their fathers' relationship. Dimitri moved quickly towards them and embraced them each.
“Of course yes, I was even thinking of helping him, actually” Draco chuckled. Harry laughed and kissed Draco.
“But yes! It was evident!” Her sudden intervention made Ron jump to Harry's side. The two young men were thus able to get closer as discreetly and subtly as possible.
“But not right now” Harry wanted to ask why they couldn’t do it now bit he didn’t have the time because there was a loud thud behind him. He turned on his chair to look. The thud seemed to come from upstairs and everyone in the room was now looking in this direction.
"Don’t laugh, don’t laugh, don’t laugh" Harry repeated to himself mentally. Draco burst out laughing as he heard that, and Molly's sharp eyes fell on him. She then went back to Harry.
“I just want you and the baby to be safe. And I'm just going to get a necklace, nothing dangerous” Draco then capitulated, knowing full well that he wouldn’t have the last word. Draco pushed Harry aside and he turned too. While they were doing nothing but stare, the door creaked open. Lesath appeared, a more than shy look on his face.
“I see a ton of it. I'm in love with you, you're in love with me, we go out together, we're going to have eleven great kids together and seven of them are here”
Pansy rolled her eyes too as Draco opened his mouth in outrage. He wasn’t afraid to see Potter. He wasn’t! Well, maybe he was a bit but they didn’t need to actually know that. It wasn’t fear anyway, it was more like he dreaded to see him again but definitely wanted to at the same time.
“Dimi!” One of them exclaimed. The man turned to look at them and a grin spread his lips.
“How can you know that?” Draco asked.
“We shouldn’t” Lyra finally said. They all agreed.
“Leave them a few minutes, Mr. Malfoy. they haven’t seen each other for several months. And they are pretty touching I must say” Lucius nodded, growling, but a tiny smile finally made his appearance on his lips. After several minutes, the four children stopped bickering.
“Yeah, Dad thought it was funny that his godchild was the godfather of his daughter and son” Alarik told him as he stepped closer. Draco slowly looked up at him, a mixture of shock and misunderstanding painted on his face.
“We're coming, darling.” Hermione told him, coming to take him in her arms. They then all went out of the room and they saw not far away, Harry and Draco ready to jump on each other. They were facing each other and their faces were very close. Harry had his fists clenched and Draco clenched and convulsively unclenched his fists. Harry might be slightly smaller, but he looked just as threatening. They said no word but the argument went through their eyes and seemed particularly violent.
“You just saw my nightmare” Harry looked reassured for a second.
“How did you do that?” Draco asked.
“Why?”
“It's not right!” Jordan snarled.
“Go see him and talk” Harry offered, staring at Draco, frowning. Ron spun around to find himself on his back across the bed.
He could then start a slow and long come and go that made Draco moan in pleasure. The blonde shouted Harry's name as he hit his prostate. He then made sure to hit it as much as possible and soon the room was filled with groans more indecent than the other and cries of pleasure. After a good number of back and forth move, they both came almost at the same time. Harry fell back on Draco, both completely out of breath. Harry was the first to recover and he straightened slightly, not wishing to crush his lover. Draco finally smiled, his eyes still closed.
“I'm not asking you to go out with Blaise...” She began.
In the next picture, you could see Draco with his cold face, which quickly became a big smile when Harry passed in his vision. On another, he saw them, Draco and himself laughing. He stayed a long time in front of the image of them kissing in the astronomy tower for their first kiss. He then saw a kind of family photo, where all the people living in their apartment at Hogwarts were gathered. He then saw several shots of all the children, especially during the Quidditch match.
“You have to find Dad.” Nathaniel nodded at his brother's approval.
Harry opened the bedroom door gently. He was wrapped in the blanket of the bed to cover his nakedness and he tried to reach the bathroom as discreetly as possible. Draco was with him and they spent their time walking on their feet.
“No, but you're communicating by thought in our day so I think it starts” Lyra replied. Draco nodded, looking totally shocked and lost.
“You ... you are ...” She stammered.
“It's funny, it's like a family outing” Ezekiel laughed. The other two blondes glared at him.
The nurse had just spent over an hour explaining to them everything that was going to happen and all that Harry had withheld was that Draco's waist was going to expand for the first month and that was why he was suffering. They were now lying on their side, face to face. Draco stared at Harry, not knowing what to think.
“Very good. How did we win?” The children looked at each other for a few seconds.
Harry stepped out of the compartment but someone held him by the hand. He found himself facing Draco who kissed him.
“Oh pity, don’t exaggerate it or I tell them myself” A copy of Nathaniel cut him off.
“What about me?” Harry asked with a sulky pout that melted Draco. He leaned over and laid his lips on Harry's. Again, they didn’t pay attention to Lucius who almost choked and to Narcissa who was ecstatic.
“Harry wants to talk about horcruxes” The headmaster explained. Harry then giggled while picking up another candy. Draco approached him and pushed him away from the bowl of candy.
"There are six of them here, if you add Nathaniel and Ezekiel's sister, that's seven, plus the two pairs of twins we get to eleven" Harry explained mentally. As Draco tried to record this new, Sirius frowned.
“Of course we can!” Lesath shouted. It was then Hermione's turn to have an illumination.
“We’ll come back” They all said together before running away as fast as they could.
Flashback
“Horcruxes? What is that?” Harry finally asked. As Dumbledore went into long, painful explanations, Draco raised his hand to tell him to shut up and explain himself. After all, we were a Death Eater's son or we were not.
“Is there something that makes you laugh?” Harry bit his cheek violently so as not to burst out laughing under the blonde's new comment.
“Yes, thank you” Harry replied blushing, thinking back to the fact that it was only because he spent the night in Malfoy's arms.
“What do you mean by Grandpa Lu?”
“Don’t start again Ezé” Dimitri warned him.
When Hermione returned to the common room, she found them playing wizard’s chess. Ron was unbeatable and Harry was beginning to despair, so when he saw her coming through the door, he didn’t miss this opportunity. He jumped to his feet and ran to Hermione, quickly imitated by Ron. That made Hermione laugh, but she refused to tell them anything yet. She stepped forward and sat on one of the chairs, the two boys around her. She threw a bubble of silence of her invention so that nobody hears their conversation.
“You seem to have disappeared, Uncle Harry” Dimitri said as he entered the room. Harry laughed, only the adults seemed to ignore Harry's whereabouts. The young man threw himself bluntly on the bed where Draco and Harry had previously been. He leaned closer to them.
“Oh ! I see ... Don’t worry I'll arrange that for you” Zachady winked at him and Blaise was about to answer when Ron opened the door a little.
“Do you plan to join or are you gonna stay near that door for at least an hour?”
“It's already started?” Harry couldn’t take it anymore, there was too much information all at once. He was risking his life in all that. So he got up, very upset.
“We planned to meet in the Chamber of Secrets to discuss the explosion and horcruxes as soon as they are awake” She informed him before leaving. He then went in search of Sirius. He carefully descended the stairs and was surprised to see that the debris had all disappeared.
Sirius stood in front of the living room couch with a tender smile on his lips. On that couch was Draco, who was holding Harry tightly against him. Both of them were sleeping soundly, and that didn’t really surprise Sirius at the early morning hour. He looked at them carefully and his smile widened. Draco had his back against the back of the couch, holding Harry against him, their fingers were intertwined at the brown's belly and their legs were perfectly tangled as well. Sirius gently put his hand on Harry's shoulder and the two boys opened their eyes at once in a way that Sirius found scary. Sirius jumped and almost fell on the coffee table made of glass behind him, but he was held back by something invisible. The two boys straightened together.
Draco raised an eyebrow at him as he huffed.
“Anyway, whatever you’re doing, I'll have to talk to you later, Harry”
“Well, firstly it seems that the duration changes according to your physical proximity. For example if you are close enough physically but do not touch, you can stay a good while but you will eventually need to touch each other. However, the further you are from each other, the less you can stay. And the longer you stay in touch, the more you can stay away” Harry was stunned, his friend had gone to great lengths for him. He got up and went to take her in his arms. Lyra then came running and was relieved when she saw her little brother. Realizing she was scared by not finding him in his bed when she got up, Harry apologized flatly. She reassured him then, assuring him that it was not serious. Harry then felt a strange feeling, a mixture of panic and stress. He apologized to the girls and disappeared as quickly as possible. Seeing him leave almost running, they worried and followed him. Harry went up the stairs four at a time and narrowly escaped the stairs. He rushed to the door where his name was inscribed. Just before he reached it, she opened on Draco.
“But Draco” Harry chuckled, gently pushing the blond away.
“Actually, I think Elie...” Nathaniel was cut off by a glare from Jordan who promised him a thousand sufferings. Everyone could distinctly hear him swallow.
“We know who you are” The blond boy said in a voice so cold that Harry felt like he was in front of Malfoy. He grabbed Harry's hand with a slight smile. His brunette friend was watching the scene, a bored look on his face. So Ron handed him his hand, which he grasped firmly. Hermione, who was not participating in the exchange, cleared her throat, drawing the attention of the four boys on her.
“Is something wrong between you and Dimitri?” Harry finally asked after what felt like on minute or two. He wanted Zephir to spoke first but they hadn’t an eternity to talk. Once Lena would wake up, they’ll have to take care of her, whatever the boys wanted to do to her.
“What?” Blaise asked while brushing his teeth.
“Yes, some of us are on Hogwarts teams but we have created teams by family to play with each other” Jordan explained. The adults were astonished.
Harry was lying in bed and smiling like a fool, thinking back to the events that had taken place earlier. So he’d kissed Draco, which destabilized him. Then he finally kissed him back and wrapped his arms around Harry's waist as Harry had his arms around the blonde's neck, sliding one of his hands through his hair. They had kissed as much as they could before running out of air. They then had broken loose slowly, opening their eyes again. Draco laughed nervously, feeling ridiculous for having fled earlier. Harry had just smiled and kissed him again.
“Your kids are all huddled behind that door, Malfoy” Harry justified. Draco nodded and then peeled off the door before opening it. He turned to Harry.
He smiled slightly. They finally arrived in front of the carriages. Harry, Draco, Ezekiel, Eleanor and Lesath took the last of the carriages. Harry began to relax. They then boarded the train and the trip was in a good atmosphere. Harry's stress soared when the train stopped.
“Would that mean that Harry and Malfoy would be your two parents?” The youngest looked at her jadedly, which seemed to mean 'it's obvious' while Harry, Ron and the Slytherins stared at her as if she had gone completely crazy. The children did not try to deny, the truth being too obvious. Ron blanched as he opened his mouth and closed it again and again. Harry was deep in silence, trying to digest the situation. Hermione and Zabini looked at each other knowingly, not looking particularly surprised. Malfoy was struggling to keep his face blank, even if Blaise could see his eyes sparkle for a moment. Hermione suddenly cleared her throat, ending that particularly embarrassing moment.
“What's the matter?” He asked.
“Don’t think you can just leave like that!” Harry yelled at Draco from behind him. They were walking up the stairs to their room. Emett was still in Harry’s arms, in need of a hug. Sometimes, Harry still heard him sniff in him neck.
“He had been very softly” Pansy rolled his eyes.
“You're here” He whispered as he approached Harry. He threw himself on him, hugging him. Harry froze before returning his embrace. He wondered what had happened so that Draco Malfoy would throw himself into his arms, clearly worried for him
“Instead of bickering about your family's purity of blood, think about more important things.” Malfoy seemed to go off in his thoughts, looking for what was so important to make Hermione react as much. He seemed to find it.
Harry gave him a bright smile. He saw in Hermione's eyes that she knew exactly what the boys were talking about, Ron had probably complained to her. He smiled at them and saw Draco behind them, sitting on the edge of a window. He apologized to his friends and went to the blond. He settled between his legs and caressed distractingly the inside of his thighs.
“Oh! They have THE face, look” Nathaniel told Ezekiel. All the children looked at them and big smiles appeared on their faces.
“Hey Uncle Sev! How are…” He had looked at Harry while he had talked and now his green eyes were wide open, his mouth as well.
The blonde glanced at his friend, and he understood that it would be his turn to speak.
“Don’t tell me…” Theo laughed.
“Well, I must go, see ya” And with these words the girl left the room. Harry remained frozen, despite the fact that he closed the door. Draco finally woke up and saw the Gryffindor standing in front of the door.
“It's OK!” Sirius exclaimed.
“Okay, you're not worried.” They stared at each other now, blinking, giving themselves a sort of battle of glance. The doorknob slowly lowered and someone tried to enter but Harry's weight prevented him. Harry peeled off the door, pushing Malfoy back at the same time. He turned around and the door opened slowly, revealing a little blond boy. Harry smiled at Lesath and eyed him.
“Levels? What does it mean?” Hermione flipped through a page. “It depends on the strength of the bond. The stronger the link is, the higher the level is. There would apparently be only four levels. You are certainly not level one since there is no physical or psychological effect. Let's see level two...” Hermione was talking while reading and Harry began to shake his legs nervously.
“Yes, he's coming.” But the kid had not heard him. Lesath's eyes widened and a big smile was now blocking his face. He literally jumped from the brunette's knees and ran towards Malfoy and his friends. Harry, in a paternal outburst that he didn’t know he had, tried to hold back the little one.
“Not quite” Eleanor replied.
“It sounded better in my head” Blaise mumbled, looking down at the floor.
“How are you, Uncle Harry?” Then three people ran down the stairs and smiled broadly as all eyes turned to them.
They arrived with difficulty to the door of the room where Harry was sleeping. Harry lifted Draco and opened the door. He then kicked it close and stopped dead on seeing the room. He rested a growling Draco on the ground and they watched the transformed room. There was only one bed and it was much bigger than the original one. A subdued light reigned in the room and a soft heat seemed to emerge from the walls.
“And it's Eleanor and Zachady” Nathaniel went on, pointing at the brown girl and the black boy. Hermione finally raised her head and Harry, who saw the two young women almost side by side, noticed the great resemblance. Without a doubt the girl was Hermione's daughter.
“We destroy them with basilisk venom and we already know where they are”
“Well, today we are going to address the unformulated. The theory was taught to you by my colleague so let's get straight to the practice” With a wand motion Remus made all the tables disappear and the students got up hastily before their chairs disappeared. Once the room was emptied, he spoke again.
“Stop” Draco said after taking a deep breath, even though his eyes had closed at the familiar feeling.
He couldn’t go back here. Not when everyone was seeing him as a big bad Death Eater. Especially not when Potter would be here, smiling at everyone and blushing under all the stares like he hadn’t saved the fucking world. Not when Potter would smile at everyone but him.
“Well, I see we can get along” He glanced at his sister and she jumped happily from her chair and headed for Lena Weasley-Parkinson. She threw the candy pack at Ezekiel when she passed him. He picked some of them before throwing the package at his brother. He then sat down next to Harry.
“Oh! That means the blond twins are your kids!” Fred then exclaimed. They then straightened up, sitting on the bed. Harry nodded.
“So what about a race?” Dimitri suggested. Draco pouted, not convinced.
“I-” Harry started before losing his balance and stumbling on the left.
“We don’t know either”
“You're falling in love with her” Draco laughed gently.
“What were you talking about by the way?” The boy asked now in front of them. He was a tall young man, his black hair just above his shoulders and he was black-eyed.
“Not quite” He whispered quietly.
Draco anxiously stared at the front door of the apartments while sipping his mixture of pumpkin juice and anti-pain potion for his back. To tell the truth, no one inside was in a better state. Jordan was screaming at just about everyone. Lyra and Erin were biting their nails a little discreetly. Emett was clinging unconsciously to Draco, looking for comfort. Ascella stood between her two big sisters. Lesath didn’t seem to be aware of anything, although he clearly felt the concern in the room. Eleanor read a book a little too slowly to look realistic. As for the other people in the room, they were equally worried. While the atmosphere was more than heavy and palpable as ever, a group of six people appeared on the ground in a pop sound, making everyone jump. Draco frowned as he saw that there was only one blond, or rather a blonde. Lyra and Erin had horrified looks.
“Triplets?” Harry finally asked.
“He will not die” Zephir reassured him.
“No way!” Harry exclaimed.
“Ezekiel?” Harry didn’t understand what his son had to do with it.
“No, there are ten children that we don’t know. Look, there are those five children there that we met earlier. Then there are the two blondes with their two brunettes friends. Then the blonde girl and probably her brother who shoved you”
“Just stop and fuck me” legs opening even wider. The brunette chuckled and pulled his fingers away. Harry started to push his hard cock smoothly into Draco. Much too slowly in Draco’s opinion.
Draco was staring outside the window in his room at Malfoy manor. It was beautiful outside with all the flowers, really. His window was just above his mother’s garden, giving him a full view of its magnificence. It was full of colors. Red, purple, blue and yellow standing together in perfect harmony. In his opinion, her garden was the only thing that wasn’t tainted by a memory of the Dark Lord in this damn house.
Severus Snape opened the shower stall and walked out. He pulled on a boxer and headed for the living room of his private apartments. He jumped when he heard a drawer opened suddenly. He rushed to the source of the noise.
“We just wanted to be sure that everything was fine” Nathaniel said. Harry suddenly saw an image of himself and Draco kissing in front of his eyes, followed by a sense of frustration. He was very surprised and turned his eyes to Draco, it could only come from him. He looked up at Harry and when their eyes met Harry realized that Draco had not intentionally sent this picture and the blond knew that Harry had seen it. His eyes widened and he suddenly became red. He stammered out words that Harry did not understand and ran away. Harry stood there, the children staring at him unrestrainedly. As he watched them, he realized that in the end he knew nothing about them, their ages, their homes, or how they were designed. He told them of this observation.
“Dad? Why didn’t you come with Daddy Sev?” Erika asked.
“Maybe you three should do it?” Hermione asked the triplets, more to Ezekiel and Alya since Nathaniel was still on the couch, probably too far to even hear the conversation. “You told us you were the most powerful here”
“So tell us!” They all looked at Malfoy questioningly, his voice had not been aggressive, he had only seemed impatient and curious. She moved and grabbed Malfoy and Harry's wrists and placed them in a corner of the circle that their strange group was forming. As she walked away, she took Ron with her and placed him next to Zabini. She glanced at the children, all gathered between the two duets.
Indeed, the latter began to attack more and more often. The second time it happened, they were in potions. When the vision came to his mind, Harry had a headache so hard he fell off his chair. He found himself on his knees on the ground and began screaming when Voldemort put more power into his attack. Draco rushed at him and slid to the ground in front of him. Harry's gaze was vague so Draco made the first thing that went through his head, he kissed him. He didn’t return the kiss right away, then finally he returned it desperately as if Draco was his lifeline in the ocean of terror in which Voldemort plunged him. Draco put the palms of his hands on Harry's cheeks and gently pushed him away.
“And when we come back, you'll tell me what's going on with your back” The blonde wanted to protest but he saw in Harry's determined look that he had no choice.
“Yeah, it's a long story. Go to the apartment tonight, we will explain everything and we will introduce your children too” The two adults could only nod while the ten teenagers came out of the room, deciding that the class was over for them.
“By Merlin!” He shouted before fleeing the room.
Harry ran his hands under the gray shirt and lovingly flattered Draco's pale ribs. Draco stuck his teeth into his lower lip to restrain his moan. Harry returned to take possession of Draco's lips while starting to undo the buttons of his shirt. Once that was done, the blonde removed it and removed Harry's. Draco sat up, Harry still on his lap. They were still kissing each other and Harry chuckled as the photo album fell to the floor in a thump. The blonde brought his hands up Harry's thighs to his buttocks and it was there that he felt it, a small ball in the back pocket of Harry's pants.
“It's kind of clever, if you forget that you've done wrong to the Malfoy-Potter family and sincerely, I don’t want to be in your place because of my kids' characters” Draco commented.
“Oh, Harry. I'm glad to see you again”
“What?” He then asked quite harshly.
“The five terrors take care of it, Ascella stands guard in the hallway and the little ones have asked the adults to play with them” She explained.
“Which?” Malfoy almost didn’t answer, but, thinking about it, she was pretty smart and could quite easily understand what the problem was.
“Tell me Dimi” Joris began in a soft voice that didn’t announce anything good.
“Well!” Draco exclaimed, a look of delight on his face. He cast a spell that bound the girl and he then dragged Harry by the hand to their room.
“I love my life, Potter” Draco muttered, tightening his arms around Harry. The latter more comfortably leaned his head against Draco's shoulder and fell asleep quickly.
“Take me, Draco” The blonde's eyes widened as he moved back a bit.
Harry shifted uncomfortably on his feet, his hand clasped in front of him.
“Can it wait?” Harry asked stroking the blonde's chest while licking his collarbone.
Finally, Nathaniel and Jordan didn’t have the opportunity to share their idea with anyone since the departure arrived quickly. At the moment, they all entered their apartment. Harry stopped suddenly as he heard a laugh from the floor. He waved them to wait , which of course nobody did. So while the kids literally threw themselves on the couches, Harry started slowly up the stairs, under Draco's amused gaze.
“And stop crying, you know I hate it” Harry laughed through his tears, squeezing Molly even more against him.
“Ah Harry! Please, come in...” Harry gave an amused smile and then went to sit on a chair.
“Hi, it’s nice to see you Pansy” He heard her say in the corridor. He groaned again in frustration as he looked at Blaise in exasperation.
“Hold on” He told Jordan as he walked to the wall. He sat his boyfriend on the ground and pulled on the shelves. They moved slightly but still moved. He pulled again until there was enough space for a body. He turned his head to Jordan who had fallen on the ground. The healing always left him a bit light-headed but the loss of blood made it worse.
“Because it's out of the question! I refuse to settle at this lion-filled table.” It was Harry's turn to roll his eyes excessively.
“Get upstairs, find our kids and lock yourself in our room” Harry told Draco before kneeling down next to Jordan. He was conscious and his hand was against his side. A large knife was on the ground next to him and Harry suddenly started to panic. He was bleeding a lot and Harry was like paralyzed. Suddenly, Nathaniel came running toward them and put his hands on Jordan’s wound, pressuring it. Nathaniel smiled softly at his boyfriend.
“Is that why Emett looks so much like Harry?” Ron, who seemed to understand the situation, asked.
“Do you really think you would have had children if Voldemort was still trying to kill you?” Nathaniel almost laughed at him.
“We should do a parent-children match again when we get back to Hogwarts” Joris offered, shaking his fork.
“It should be pretty simple guys, according to me, daddy will be the seeker, Uncle Ron the keeper, Uncle Theo and father as beaters and Aunt Ginny, Uncle Blaise and Aunt Pansy the Chasers” Lyra said.
“Oh yes, he's my little brother. Ezekiel, Emett and Lesath are also my little brothers” She said, each pointing to them. Ezekiel was probably Nathaniel's twin brother and Lesath was the little boy she carried in her arms. She then pointed to Jordan.
“Are you ok, sweetheart?” He whispered in his ear. Emett nodded but Harry felt new tears running down his neck. He stopped once he reached the top of the stairs. He kneeled down and Emett sat on the floor, his knees to his chest. Tears were still running down his cheeks and he started to sob.
Hermione had a hard time trying to talk to the redhead who was screaming.
“By Merlin, are you acting like a baby again, Em?” Lyra asked as she went to stand in front of them. He looked up at her and shook his head. “It’s not because you’re small that you have to act like you really are a little kid” Emett nodded at her, looking sad and guilty.
“We can’t do this now” Alya announced. Everyone had been made aware of the situation and they were gathered in the living room to talk about Harry’s possible future death.
“Oi! Get out of my bathroom! You’re gonna break something precious” Draco yelled as he approached the door of the bathroom. Blaise opened it and then went off with a smirk on his face. He sat beside Pansy.
“Don’t apologize! I find it wonderful”
They all nodded.
“But I want to stay with you too, daddy” A tear ran down his cheek and Harry couldn’t resist the tearful look of the little blond.
“Your what?” Hermione wondered.
“Well” He said, coherently, like that explained everything. “I’m not sure I want to go back” He admitted as she looked about to throw him in the trunk just to be sure it wouldn’t be empty anymore.
“Why are you smiling like this? You don’t smile like that, never” Pansy said as he entered his bedroom with a bright smile on his lips. She was lying on the bed and she has straightened herself on her elbows to look at him.
“Get out!” Draco shouted as he came back to flatten his lips against Harry's. The latter went down his legs until touching the ground again. He then reversed their positions and started sliding down the blonde's body. Blaise knocked again as Harry opened his mouth near Draco's erection.
“His eyes! They’re the same as Ron’s!” While saying that, she had moved closer to Jordan and now had his face a few inches from the man's. He was petrified and seemed to panic slightly. At the sight of Hermione getting dangerously close to Jordan, the blond passed one of his arms around his shoulders. Harry smiled when he saw him do it, which he quickly hid. Hermione took her place again and still stared at the two boys, but Nathaniel was slightly more detailed this time. Jordan grabbed the blonde's knee and slowly moved his hand up and down his thigh. Harry repressed another smile in front of this show of affection. He didn’t know who these two boys were but he found them adorable. He envied them too, for a reason he didn’t know. Hermione got up suddenly and walked away from them in a few steps, she was obviously thinking.
On the other side of the door, Lyra and Erin smiled at each other.
“Naaaath” Jordan said when he saw Nathaniel head in front of his.
"I don’t know but it smells war if you want my opinion" Harry gave him an amused smile and sat up in bed, without letting go of his hand.
“We fell and we stayed there to hide from Molly” Harry explained. The boy rolled on his back. The door opened again and Ezekiel entered laughing with Joris and Alarik.
“Because you and your stupid friends are just doing shit and Daddy is always yelling at you because of that” Lyra began.
After a moment there was a little knock on the door and Lesath entered, looking as shy as ever. They pulled back and looked at him with smiles.
“I mean- you know what, I'll give you examples, it'll be easier” She thought for a moment, making a mental list of all her ideas.
“It's happening, right? He’s falling for him” Hermione turned her head toward her and followed her gaze to Harry. And she saw the gleam in the green eyes that were watching Draco and she understood. Harry was falling for the blond. She smiled, the way Harry looked at Draco was absolutely beautiful to see. Draco suddenly stopped laughing and stared at Harry with a disgusted look.
“Well, that's a good thing done. But there are other things I need to share with you” Harry sighed slightly. He had just told them that their children from the future were here, and he dared to say that there was something else! As if it was not strange and incredible enough, the Headmaster had to add even more.
“No, of course not” They replied in one voice. The boy gave them a huge smile and ran back to play. Pansy and Ginny had not missed anything of the scene or their smiles when the little boy ran back to them.
“I don’t know, if I don’t act as they wish, they may be disappointed.” Harry laughed slightly, staring at the blonde's neck.
“Listen, you are just going to ignore each other the entire year and then never see each other again” She then stated with a smile, like she just resolved the entire problem.
“By the way, I'm Lyra” She announced, extending her hand to Harry's. He grabbed it with pleasure as he looked into her eyes, then frowned and glanced at Nathaniel and then back at her. They had the same eyes.
“But I haven’t even asked yet” Hermione laughed and looked at Harry.
He also groaned as Harry put his hands on his buttocks and pressed him even harder and their erections rubbed against each other. Draco wanted more, definitely more and if he trusted the groans of the brown lying under him, he wasn’t the only one. Harry then slid his hands under the blonde's boxer and stroked his buttocks. Draco shivered and his hand on the Gryffindor's cock became more pressing. Harry gasped in response and gently slid Draco's boxer down his legs.
“So this Quidditch team?” Eleanor finally reminded them.
“Yes, and I went back, but Dumbledore sent me word that there was also a room for me here so I came back.” Harry nodded and thanked the headmaster for that. Suddenly a thud rang out from Ron and Zabini's room. They all looked at each other, worried. It looked like something breaking on the floor or against a wall.
A laugh was heard, far down the hall.
“Come on, hurry up” Harry said as he walked toward the door. They entered and closed the door behind them.
“I reacted very badly, it doesn’t matter if your chosen one is Draco Malfoy, the important thing is that you're happy and he doesn’t look that bad, I have to admit that he looks very good”
“They communicate by thought” Emett explained to him as if it was perfectly normal, which was ultimately the case for him. Sirius wasn’t understanding anything, seeing his face.
“ Do you have a backache?” Harry asked. Draco tried to give him a reassuring smile, assuring him that it was nothing. Harry didn’t believe him in the least, but pretended to. He suddenly remembered that this morning the teachers were coming back to the castle. He jumped out of bed and extended his hand to Draco and stood in front of him.
“Let me in, or I swear I’ll kill you!” He heard Draco scream from outside the apartment. Harry laughed frankly.
“Dimi!” Ezekiel shouted.
“What can you tell us?” Harry asked after clearing his throat. Jordan leaned over his friend's ear and seemed to offer him ideas. Nathaniel answered yes or no and chuckled tenderly from time to time. Ron seemed to be bored by Harry's side, while harry stared at what appeared to be a couple. Hermione turned the attention to herself when she ran like a fury towards the exit of the common room.
“Oh, I see” His mother said to Blaise with a knowing smile. “I’ll leave you to it then” She added as she left the room with a wink aimed in Draco’s direction.
“No, you'll know it in due course. All you have to know is that he doesn’t push you away” Ezekiel replied.
“And the girls? Who keeps them down?” Erin asked.
"And Nathaniel and Emett with us," Jordan continued.
“No, he didn’t accept but we are in the same dormitory so maybe I happen to watch him sleep from time to time, but rarely”
“Wait? Can we send each other pictures?” Draco asked her.
“In the chamber of secrets, of course” Harry, Lyra, Erin and the triplets answered in one voice. Draco mumbled something about the damn arrogance of the Malfoys his kids had inherited. Harry laughed at the absurdity of the remark as the children revolted, shouting that they were not arrogant.
“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me!” He whispered harshly to Blaise. “You brought Pansy!” Blaise smirked at him and smiled brightly when Pansy walked in the room. Draco scowled at her from his sitting position on the bed.
“No ... T-That’s ... Ha-Harry” He raised his head and tried to find his soul mate among the rubble and the dust. The library had literally burst into pieces, as well as the wall behind it. Hermione got up and took the controls.
“Come on, baby” He pleaded, making puppy eyes at her. She shook her head and he sighed.
He screamed in frustration as he buried his head in a pillow. He had no real problem about seeing Potter again. In fact, he wanted to see him. But the fact that he may have had a little crush on him since the fifth year was the true problem. He couldn’t have Potter, even if Potter wanted him. Which he didn’t, Draco reminded himself.
Draco had offered Harry a supreme firebolt to replace his broken broom. To thank him, Harry kissed him passionately under Molly's disgusted face and the tender smiles of their children. Harry offered Draco a potion book and Draco did all he could to hide his grimace of disappointment. Harry did, however, sense Draco's feeling of great disappointment.
“Hey, whose T-shirt is this?” Tonks asked.
“We should go eat” So they got up and went to eat.
“What is happening?” Lyra asked as she entered.
He put the girl back on the floor and took advantage of the fact that his boyfriend was busy hugging his godfather to slip into the room he had just left. He quickly crossed the room and leaned against the bathroom doorframe when he was hit by a stronger wave of pain than the others. He entered the bathroom as best he could and closed the door. He let himself slide against it, the room turning around him. He moaned when the pain increased again.
“I don’t even want your explanation” He later tried to get out of the room but Draco did not want to stop there. As Harry walked away he followed him, explaining himself.
“What?” Blaise, who had not heard, asked.
“Morning” The brown man mumbled back. Draco smiled tenderly and came back to kiss Harry's lips. The latter nibbled the lower lip of the blonde who moaned slightly under the attention. He opened his lips and Harry's tongue met his. They both wound up in a flaming ballet. Draco settled over Harry and Harry spread his legs so the blond could sit between them. Harry moaned as Draco kissed his neck, sucking the skin between his lips.
“Make him suffer and I'll kill you” Draco burst out laughing but seeing the brunette's more than serious look, he calmed down and nodded. She then extended a hand to him and he squeezed it with a smile. Ron then ran.
“Really ? Didn’t you find anything better?” He just shrugged. This small exchange had the gift of amusing Hermione and Theo and the atmosphere relaxed greatly in the room.
“So, how is it going with your beautiful boy?” Zach finally asked him with a mocking smile. Dimitri glared at him.
“How much did you eat Harry?” He asked, throwing away the candy.
“Are you deaf? He said we were going to eat.” Ezekiel interjected, catching all eyes. Blaise smiled and approached the blonde. He ruffled his hair as he passed and laughed.
“Ezekiel!” Draco shouted. The young man looked up from his book and looked at both his parents from the couch where he was sitting. He lifted his girlfriend's head off his lap and exited the fluffy sofa.
“Soul mate, you say?” Hermione asked and the three blondes nodded. “That's what it seemed to me” she added more for herself than to continue the conversation. She opened a big book and immediately Blaise and Theo leaned over her shoulders to read at the same time. "Okay, so from what we can read, there would be several levels of soul mates” Harry frowned.
The days passed, bringing them closer and closer to the Christmas holidays. Harry did not share it with anyone but he questioned himself strongly about the holidays. First because he had to buy gifts and secondly he wondered if they would spend the holidays at the castle. Besides, he could hardly see Draco anymore and Harry had to admit that it worried him a bit. It worried him a lot, really, and he was really on edge. The blond had just arrived in front of him and Harry didn’t even want to look at him. The blonde wrapped his arms around his waist and pulled him close to him.
He found her in a small empty room in the evening.
“Daddy and Dad aren’t going to punch each other, eh Lyra?” The girl turned her head towards her little brother and assured him that she didn’t think that was going to happen, but she did not seem very sure of herself.
“She's not here, Potter” Theo muttered still half asleep.
“Of course I’m coming! I'm not going to wait for you here as if I'm just a fragile girl” Harry gave him his best puppy eyes.
“I see no reason for it to happen” Harry said.
“But with the war and all that's going on, it's not the right time” Harry turned so that he was on the blond.
“It's just Weasley who doesn’t agree to have kids with Blaise”
“Are we going to eat soon, Daddy?” The boy asked in his high-pitched voice. Harry smiled at him and stroked his hair.
Harry didn’t have the time to think about it more, Ron was waiting for him to go down to eat.  They went down and came to Hermione who was talking with Ginny. They were blushing and giggling so Harry assumed they were talking about love or something. They recover quickly when they saw them and they all go to the Great Hall. They were walking slowly in a corridor when they heard footsteps, like people running. They looked around them, searching for the origin of the sound. Then, two little boys stopped in front of them. Three little girls came just after them. One of them, a redhead with blue eyes was jumping, looking victorious until she looked up at the four tallest. She stared at Harry first and then she looked at the other three. Then, she finally ran to Harry and wrapped her arms around his legs. Harry was very surprised, this little girl not more than five years old seemed to know him well, but for him, apart from his hair and eyes, which corresponded in every way to those of the Weasley family, he had no idea who she could be. One of the two little boys, a gray-eyed blonde who, astonishingly, reminded him of Malfoy, moved closer to Harry as well. He had a sulky pout on his face. He grabbed the girl by the shoulders and tried to pull her back.
“I guess he doesn’t understand we're not the same as we’re in his day.” Harry nodded.
They were crying with laughter when Ron, Blaise and their four children arrived. Ron and Blaise froze, astonished to see them like this. Harry leaned on Draco's shoulder, still shaking with laughter and Jordan leaned over to Lyra.
“What?” He asked, coming closer.
"What is it?" He heard in his head. Harry looked up at Draco, not quite sitting in front of him. "I succeeded?” Harry nodded. Draco seemed extremely proud of him.
“You can communicate by thought” Harry's mouth formed an "o". “And I also seem to have found a way for you to get away for a longer time”
“I'm not going to sleep with you, Malfoy” He told him, once they got to their room. Draco just nodded, perfectly okay, though a little concerned. They each went through the bathroom and went to bed each on their own.
“And my daddy's Sirius too” Harry and Draco opened their mouths wide.
“Oh yes”
“On the other hand, I'm sure Granger would agree to do it for us” Harry immediately straightened and turned to his friend, eyes bright.
“Harry!” He shouted as he ran across the children's room where Emett, Jackson, Jasper, Skott and Isaak were. The five boys watched him pass and then began to build a more than shady plan. Draco violently opened the double doors and saw Harry huddled on the windowsill.
“Everyone, this is Joris” Ezekiel told them.
Harry awoke with a start a few hours later. He felt good. He made his way to the bathroom when he heard some noise in the bathroom. He opened the door softly and froze when he saw Draco, his head resting on the edge of the toilet bowl, ready to fall asleep. Harry knelt beside Draco and put his hand behind his back.
“Zephir, now!” Alya yelled as the triplets gathered in the center of the room. The brunette expelled Umbridge with one hand movement and pushed Lucius into Nathaniel's arms on the other. He grabbed Ezekiel's wrist and grabbed Harry's wrist at the exact moment when the triplets made them all apparate.
“What the fuck just happened?” Harry exclaimed. Zach laughed.
Draco looked down at his hands in shame. She was right. Of course she was, Pansy was always right.
“I mean that you’re always panicking when going somewhere he is. Remember before fourth year? You talked about the World Cup for weeks because he would probably be there. And you did it before each year after that. You’re stressed out by the mere thought of his presence.”
“We all know that, but he doesn’t know Dad” Nathaniel cut him off. “All he sees is that you're hardly ever with him and that you're secret” Draco's eyes widened as he understood the problem and he ran off to their room.
He shrugged and went to play chess with Ron while Draco read a book, his head on his lap. Although in fact it was more Draco playing while Harry was in his thoughts. Draco had discovered by pure chance that he could, with a lot of concentration, see through Harry's eyes. He used it in Harry's interview with Molly and he was using it now too. The only drawback was that it tired him a lot. He was transmitting the movements to be made to Harry by the thought and the latter was performing them.
“You were saying?” He asked Theo suddenly.
“You don’t see it, right?” He whispered while Pansy meant him to shut up with her hands. Draco frowned, not understanding what was going on. ‘Potter obviously don’t love me, he’s a stupid Gryffindor so he would have told me’
“Repeating those three words won’t make him forgive you, Potter” Pansy said from behind Draco, startling him. What the fuck was she doing here. And why was she listening to them.
“You always make that face when it happens” He laughed. Harry and Draco grunted, put on their clothes and went downstairs with the three boys outside the door. When they arrived, Molly looked at them oddly, as they were still laughing. She wondered why Harry was with them and especially, why the hell was he laughing?
“Come and sit down” He half ordered Malfoy. The blond nodded and jumped over the back of the sofa and landed in the space between Harry and Theo, who was still reading. The latter jumped and got up from the couch, upset to have been interrupted in his reading and went upstairs.
“Sexy?” Harry offered.
“By Merlin Draco! I thought you were going to fight, or to kiss. It was not very clear.”Theo had finally arrived at their height while Pansy was delivering her sentences with an excited air.
“Violent to what extent?” Draco cautiously asked as Alya pushed down the redhead's face into the stone wall.
“What do you mean it’s not the good one?”
“He’s not here. We don’t know why we‘re here, or how we got here, and he’s not here!” He got angry over these last words, seeming to be slightly irritated. Nathaniel wrapped his arm around the younger boy's shoulders and pulled him against him.
“What's happening to you both?” Zach asked as he approached them. He looked inside the room and smiled, amused.
“You have a twin brother?” Hermione asked her son and he nodded. She smiled happily.
“What do we do for the night?” He asked Hermione.
Breaking up was always painful and Draco now perfectly understood why it was called ‘breaking up’. He felt broken.
“For Merlin’s sake Dray! Why don’t you just tell him that you love him?” Pansy shouted, looking very tired of all this little game between the two boys.
“Me and Ezekiel are not just twins, we're tripled with Alya” Harry and Draco were a little relieved to hear that there was just another kid.
“You want me to believe that you touched that wall and that another wall just blew up? Draco got up, threatening the boys to his full height. Harry rushed past him and tried to pull him back.
“What if we sit down?” Ron offered, he seemed to be bored to listen to them speaking. Harry and Hermione both sat on a couch, while the two boys sat on either side of Ron on the opposite couch. Hermione was still staring at them, which was starting to scare them a bit.
“Her room then?”
“Dumbledore lowered the barriers” Lucius explained.
“Harry” Draco sighed.
“Of course yes, Dray!” Then he left and marked.
“Why would he be with them?”
“What about me, to grandpa?” Lesath asked.
“You do, actually” Harry shot him a disbelieving look. Malfoy grinned at him, like he was happy to have locked Harry in a room with him. “I’m the only one who can unlock the door” Harry gaped at him.
“You said that you don’t love me, Potter” Draco grumbled.
“What is the relationship between Ezekiel and the fact that you kidnapped Lyra and Eleanor?” Harry asked.
“Draco…” Harry hardly murmured, trying to reach out for him.
"I'll kiss him right now" Harry heard in his head. It was Draco's voice so Harry figured it was probably their psychic bond coming up.
“Get your ass from this chair and go see my father! Or I’ll I make you find yourself on one of these beds... For the rest of your days?” Draco raised an eyebrow at hearing his daughter threaten the nurse. Then finally he giggled when he saw the latter arrive with a quick step and a frightened air.
“Again!? What do you mean again?”
“What?” Emett said, angrily.
“It's really horrible” Draco replied ironically.
“Hermione! Wow!” Harry exclaimed. The girl had apparently done some makeover by Pansy. Seeing her, Harry found her really sexy. She blushed at Harry's compliment and Pansy smiled proudly. Theo passed at that moment in the corridor. He passed without glancing at them and after a few seconds he took a few steps back, his head turned towards the opening left open. He stared at Hermione and his eyes widened as his mouth opened.
“We'll have to do the meeting later” The blond apologized, taking Harry out of the room. He pulled him up in his arms when he almost fell down the stairs. Harry wrapped his legs and arms around him and fell asleep on the way to the apartment. Draco finally gave the password and he entered the noisy living room. All those present in the room were silent as he entered the room.
“What are you thinking about?” He asked. She turned her green eyes in his direction and summoned a chair on the other side of the bed he was sitting on.
“Aunty Pansy? Do you know why I haven’t seen Dad yet?” The girl turned her head to Erika who looked at her with bright eyes. “I want to see my dads” The little girl snorted, ready to burst into tears.
“You want me to calm down? Are you kidding! You dare to fall in love with this idiot Nott and I have to calm down?” The idiot opened the door at this moment. He looked like he was about to kill Ron even though some redness had appeared on his cheeks.
“What was this noise?” Arthur's voice said.
Lyra was rather tall, had long blonde almost white hair. Her hair were perfectly smooth and it came to her waist. Her eyes were the same green as Harry, Emett and Nathaniel’s. He then looked at Nathaniel's brother, Ezekiel, and he noticed that he looked exactly like his brother, except for his hair that was a little longer, reaching him at the base of the skull. Harry finally looked at the smaller one, his hair was blond and his eyes were closed, but even so, he knew they were the exact color of Malfoy's. He frowned at this thought, how was it that he knew the exact color of Malfoy's eyes? A metallic gray that could look as warm as it could be iced. A gray in which Harry could immerse himself for hours without ever getting bored or tired. He shook his head to get those thoughts out of his mind. He finally smiled, already loving the five children in front of him. Harry continued his observation of the children and studied his best friend's children. He frowned, this situation was really strange. He did not detail Jordan, whom he had already observed earlier in the day. He looked at his two sisters. The two girls looked a lot alike and Harry thought they were probably twins. They had long red hair but their eyes were different, one had blue eyes and the other had brown eyes. Alarik and Erika had black hair, as well as their eyes. And Seth looked metamorphic, from what Harry saw. The boy was brown and had brown eyes when Harry had met him, but now his hair pulled on the chestnut with very blond locks and his eyes were blue. Harry thought of this member of the order, Tonks, he knew that she liked Remus a lot. Maybe the latter had arrived at his ends with the auror. Harry let his gaze wander after finishing his observation.
Eleonor and Ezekiel were reading books at one of the tables. She was sitting on the table, holding a book at her eyes level and he was sitting on a chair between her legs, his book on one of her legs. Nathaniel and Jordan were lying on one of the sofas. Jordan seemed to be asleep, his head on his boyfriend’s chest. One of his arms was wrapped around the blond waist and one of his legs was pulled up between Nath’s. Nathaniel was talking quietly with Joris, Alarik and Erin who were sitting on the floor next to him.
“We won’t know until we see it, Harry” Hermione replied.
“What did you do to my sister?” Joris repeated, crushing the girl again against the stone wall. Nathaniel, Jordan and Alarik arrived at that moment completely breathless. She winced in pain and tears of terror ran down her cheeks, but she kept her mouth shut tight and gave the blonde a look of pure challenge.
“I learned something fantastic today” Harry growled. “Dumbledore told us at dinner that all those mingled with the kids and the kids themselves would spend the Christmas holidays at the Order's HQ” The blonde punctuated his sentence with kisses in the Gryffindor's neck. The latter detached himself from Draco and turned around and rushed upstairs. Draco raised his eyebrows, not understanding where the problem was.
“When you say blow up, what do you mean?”
“He said he was sorry” Emett said as Harry was just about to open the door to his room.
“Bring your ass here, we need your help with the wall” He didn’t answer but instead whispered in his boyfriend’s ear.
“Or that day when we had to leave the room in a hurry” Alarik said. Lyra, Erin, Ezekiel, Nathaniel, Emett and Ascella laughed.
“In the flesh” Dimitri replied with a wink. Jordan laughed as he saw him surrounded by four blondes.
“Yes?” He answered as he put a shirt on quickly, covering the white scars on his chest.
“You really are not following, it happened the night when there was the storm” Nathaniel replied.
It was in this position that Harry and Hermione found them. Harry did not even know what was going on and just went out of the room looking for his blond boyfriend. He found him in the room occupied by Pansy and Ginny. He had his head in his best friend's neck and Harry could hear his sobs from the children's room. He opened the door as softly as he could and entered. He sat next to Draco and Pansy gently pushed Draco into his arms and then slipped out of the room. Harry tightened his arms around Draco and stroked his hair.
“How? And how do we find these objects?” Harry asked. The triplets chuckled at his eagerness and Erin took charge of the answer.
“I mean that I met Dad's father and he seemed angry to find him nowhere” Harry swallowed loudly and offered a tense smile to the girl.
“C’mon, love, you need to move” Jordan grumbled again in response as he tightened  his arms around Nathaniel.
“Yes, Grandma, I am” Molly's eyes widened and then she smiled at Emett. She then glanced at Draco, who was holding Lesath, and at Blaise, Theo, and Pansy, who were standing next to the blonde.
The door to the room opened on the school nurse, followed by Draco's parents. Harry sat in the bed and was a pillow to a still unconscious Draco. Harry kept his hand in his fluffy hair. Harry frowned as he saw the nurse's cheerful look.
“What is your plan to seduce our dear brother?” Emett continued. Lesath then ran to him, pulling Seth by the hand.
“Probably anyone but you” Harry showed him his middle finger as he walked away and Draco laughed behind him.
“It's funny, he has the same head as you when Dumbledore taught us about the kids” Draco laughed at Harry. The latter laughed.
“Ok, I love him! You happy now?” The blond man got angry.
“What do you think?” Harry asked, his voice thick with arousal.
“Harry... You have to help me” Ron demanded, his head back into the mattress.
“So, I'm sixteen as well as Zach. Erin, Nathaniel, Ezekiel, Jordan, Eleanor, Joris and Alarik are fifteen years old. Emett is thirteen. Lesath, Irina, Isallys, Erika and Seth are five years old” Lyra said. Harry was silent, trying to record the information that was coming to him in waves.
Here he was now, two weeks later, sitting in Pansy’s living room on one of her very comfortable couches. He got up and headed for the kitchen, he needed a drink to relax a bit and enjoy his time with his friends without thinking about Harry too much.
“Are you telling me that your father is Severus?” Harry nearly choked on him as the child in his arms nodded vigorously.
“So you five are our children? To Potter and me?” Lyra smiled at these words, if her father already thought of them as their children, it meant that he was not really against ending up with their other father. And it was a huge positive point. The five children nodded. Lesath was snuggled in his sister’s arms and began to fall asleep.
“So? Do you want to sleep here?” He asked with a little cute smile. ‘He’s not cute’ Draco thinks. ‘Stop thinking he’s cute, he’s obviously not’
“Apparently so”
“What is this?” Emerik asked.
“It's just a stupid table, Potter!” Harry started waving his arms as he spoke.
“We're not going to kill Harry!” Sirius exclaimed.
“I’m sure he’s not, he got angry because of something else and yelled at you” Harry told his son, looking at Draco right in the eyes. “That was mean from him but I’m sure he regrets it and will apologize as soon as he calms down”
“Shit, I thought he was the nicest of the three” Harry whispered.
“I'm not adorable, Potter” Harry giggled, the blond was not threatening at the moment. Between his tousled hair, his eyes gleaming with fatigue, his smile that he was trying to conceal, and the sense of joy that Harry could feel from their touching bellys.
“Oh no!”
Harry woke up slowly, wrapping himself in the blankets and bringing the warm body close to him against him. He opened his eyes at once. His eyes fell on a pale neck. He then looked up a little more and saw hair so blond that you could not doubt their owner. Harry decided to analyze the situation before panicking. Already, they were both chest naked since he could feel Malfoy's back against his own chest and one of his arms was against the blonde's. Then Harry didn’t really knew where his legs were, too tangled to those of the boy next to him. He suddenly had a doubt and moved down the hand that was previously on Malfoy along his own body and was relieved when he felt he still had his boxer. A slight laugh made him turn his attention to Malfoy.
“And you want me to tell him what? Hi Blaise, you really attract me and I find it horrible because I fall in love with you? Thank you very much, but I'll do without it” Harry settled in the same position as his friend while Draco sat silently on the other bed, an apple and a book in his hand.
“Us three and the dads will open the wall” He said. ”We’ll undo the spells and they’ll open it”
“At your service!” Harry shouted, saluting. Draco chuckled and he noticed that Harry and his daughter had exactly the same posture on their brooms, this girl had to be an excellent seeker.
“Can I come in?”
“Everything is good, so what’s the plan?” Eleanor asked.
“What happened?” She looked at Draco suspiciously and glared at him.
“You ... you ... Harry, he has your eyes”
“He wants to know if we can spend the day near the lake to bathe” All the teenagers of that time seemed to understand better and acquiesced. So it was with these words that the teenagers got up like one person and went out. They scared some of the students in the corridors. It must be admitted that seeing all this group coming towards you, Draco and Harry in the lead, did not normally presage anything good. They arrived at the edge of the lake and all sat down in a compact mass.
“Seriously?” Whispered a voice from a bed. Nathaniel jumped out of it and moved closer to them.
“The medallion is not the good one” Alarik said simply.
“Yes, that's what he means Draco. And then comes the moment when I really don’t understand anything. Lyra and Jordan arrived and acted as if it was perfectly normal and usual for them. They asked me to take you to the room and your two blond twins came carrying Harry who was as pale as you. I wanted to lie you down in your bed but they forced me to lie you down with Potter. They undressed you and made sure you got in touch and you immediately took colors” Harry and Draco were staring at him, looking amazed, not understanding the situation.
“I'm watching” Draco laughed.
“Library?” Ron asked.
“Then look at Nathaniel, his eyes are as green as Harry's and his hair just as blond as Malfoy's” Ron turned his head to Hermione.
“So that one, we really didn’t see it coming” George laughed.
They fell on the bed, breathing heavily. Harry rolled to the side and rest on his back beside Draco who had his face into the mattress. He waited until his body stopped to shake to roll on his back too. They don’t look at each other as usual. Draco looked at the ceiling as the guilty feeling he usually felt after they fucked came to him.
“Thank you” He said, kissing Harry. They both reached out and seized the Snitch at the same time and closed both hands on it. Harry put it in his pocket, having a little idea, then he came down again and set foot on the ground near the other three who seemed still shocked by the fall they had just made like Draco. Sirius was laughing loudly as Severus and Lucius stared at Harry with a kind of fascination in their eyes.
“I’m…I’m gonna…” Harry said as he felt his orgasm arriving fast. He tugged on Draco’s cock once more and they came one after the other.
Malfoy walked in the prefect bathroom and Harry hurried behind him to enter before the door closed. When the door locked behind him, he wondered if it was such a good idea. What one could possibly do in a bathroom other than take a bath? He knew he was right when
“Because I'm gay and he’s sexy, besides being the most wonderful person I've ever met” Ron muttered, his voice muffled.
“What’s this?” He asked the brunette. Harry put his hand in his pocket and took out the object. He punched Draco slightly, who was staring at him without understanding.
“Yeah, Em’s kinda sensitive when it comes to our family” Lyra said with a quick smile. Harry smiled back. Joris then came rushing toward them and pulled Lyra up by the waist and flew out of the room.
Flashback
Draco had just announced his plan idea to his father and the rest of the teachers and now they all seemed to think about it seriously.
“First of all, he's fine, he's just a little tired” Harry sighed with relief as he closed his eyes.
She stared at him for a long moment and then sighed and changed rooms. Remus just passed by smiling. Harry made the idea of packing their bags for their return the next day. Harry found himself going back and forth between the room he shared with Ron and the three Slytherins’ room to get all his belongings. The redhead was sitting on his trunk on his bed and laughing as Harry ran from room to room. Ron couldn’t help laughing more beautifully at the scene unfolding before his eyes.
“Voldemort has separated his soul into eight pieces and placed each part in an object or a living being, and as long as those objects are not destroyed, he won’t die completely” She explained.
“Granger! Your little speech is useless. We didn’t wait for you to make peace and we get along very well, don’t we, Harry?’ Draco cut her, ruffling Harry's hair at the end of his sentence. Harry smiled to approve his words. Hermione looked at them each in turn and was finally quite convinced so she grabbed the book and went upstairs. Harry didn’t move, frozen by Draco's hand in his hair. It wasn’t until then that he realized that yes, the situation had definitely changed between him and Malfoy. After all, sleeping and having children with someone, even in the future, it brought them closer.
“Oh” Was Harry's only answer. He was very hopeful that the red would calm down in the days and weeks to come.
“I do not know you, but I want to learn more” Blaise told them before getting up and up the stairs.
“Do you mean that you’re looking at the disorganization of these children?”
“I love you” Harry mumbled, his hand sliding in Draco’s hair.
“Hey” He murmured in a hoarse voice. Draco smiled with relief and laid down next to Harry.
“When can we destroy this thing?” Draco asked, pointing at the locket.
“The horcruxes”
“Okay, enough softness” He said before grabbing Jordan by the arms. Once he was sitting, he grabbed him by the waist and helped him up. He then lead Jordan to the hole behind the library and sat him down. He kneeled in front of him and took his head in his hand.
“Alya, Ezekiel and I went to see this wall more closely and thanks to our powers we learned that this wall was covered with a concealment and protection spell”
“Like what? I’m just walking to our room” Draco said without even looking at him. Harry just sighed and concentrated on Emett instead.
The two of them hugged for a long time, a time in which Nathaniel told Harry and Draco who where these kids. The girl Zach ran to was Aludra and she looked a bit like him. The boy Emerick was hugging was Daniel, Remus and Tonks’ son. Then there vas Riley and Alice, Emerik’s siblings. Riley was about 15 and Alice was probably 11. She had beautiful blond hair and blue eyes, just like Luna. There was another blond girl around the same age, Lilith.
“Sirius is your father?” Harry asked him. The boy nodded, smiling.
“five, in fact” They all turned to that voice. He was a tall young man, with hair as black as ink and electric blue eyes. Harry was captivated by the color of his eyes that didn’t look natural but was beautiful. The triplets rushed towards him and threw themselves into his arms. When the three blondes parted, the boy held out his hand to Harry.
“Where did that little devil go?” Zach asked as he arrived, one arm around Lyra’s shoulders.
That wasn’t exactly the truth, he had packed his trunk at least two times but had put everything away each time. He just couldn’t do it.
“You had a very nice dream that night and I had all the feelings of your dream while I was talking to my father”
“No, Potter, I’m not gonna read this for you” Harry's gaze became desperate so Draco decided to help him and leaned in his ear.
“Don’t worry, love, it's just your redhead friend screaming his displeasure” Harry smiled at the affectionate nickname and then lay down, without sleeping.
“Wait, did you faint too?” Draco frowned.
Draco was sitting quietly on a sofa in the living room. Harry was sleeping on the same sofa, his head on the blonde's lap. In front of him, on another sofa, stood his six children and some of their friends. To tell the truth, Ezekiel was laying full length and Lesath also seemed to be taking a nap lying on his brother. Emett sat astride an armrest, Nathaniel, Erin and Lyra were sitting on the back of the sofa. Dimitri was lying nonchalantly on the second armrest. Seth, Erika, Irina and Isallys were sitting at the foot of the couch and seemed captivated by the carpet they were sitting on. Jordan, Alarik and Joris were leaning against the back, each behind his respective girlfriend or boyfriend.
“He said he’d noticed them and that they came to see him too. But he didn’t want to tell me more information. He’ll summon us when he knows more" No sooner had she finished speaking than heavy and fast steps came near. She removed their bubble of silence, so that they could understand where all the noise came from. They turned to the common room door and saw one of the blond boys who knocked on the potion class door this morning. He was with one of his brown friends. As they passed the door, they clapped their hands, seeming to be victorious over something that the three of them didn’t know. Harry was seized with a surge of madness and had the idea to go talk to them. Hermione tried to hold him back, but he walked to them without difficulty and stopped them before they could go further into the room. They looked panicky as they saw the three Gryffindors coming towards them. They tried to run away from the room but Hermione intervened.
“Are you OK?” Harry nodded, still trying to catch his breath. Draco appeared in front of them the next second as Harry began to cough.
“It's nothing, it was rather impressive to tell the truth” A proud smile stretched the boy's mouth.
“Well, we’re not” Alya answered with a smile. “Our Dads are the most powerful in this room but not enough for this wall”
“It's also my children, Potter.” Harry gave him a provocative look as he turned to the small group and motioned for them to follow him. As they drove all the way into the Great Hall, Blaise walked over to his friend, still standing in the middle of the hallway.
“What did you do?” She asked Draco immediately, ignoring Blaise. He opened his mouth to say that he didn’t do anything but was cut off by Blaise.
“That plan’s pretty good, actually it's fine as long as you change the part where you're coming along” Draco made an outraged look.
“You really are our children?” Ron asked.
“Mr. Malfoy, take Mr. Potter to the infirmary” Draco felt Harry's body crumble over him as he went to meet his godfather. Severus shot him an urgent look and Draco got up, Harry in his arms, bride-style.
“What's the problem?” Emett, who obviously did not understand why there was a problem, asked.
He knew it was the right choice when he saw the bright smile on Harry’s face.  Draco then apparated away to their flat, leaving Pansy alone on her doorstep.
“It's getting late, we should all go to bed” They all nodded and started to get up.
“December 31th is in two days so you find me a plan before tomorrow” They nodded.
"We have eleven children"
“Oh stop it for Merlin’s sake” Draco burst out laughing and Harry was captivated by the laughing Slytherin, so he forgot about the dreadful image in his mind. Draco completely ignored Harry's gaze and continued to laugh. Lyra moved closer to Hermione and whispered in his ear.
“How did you know?” Draco looked at Harry smiling, thanking him mentally and Theo understood.
“We just touched the wall, we swear” Emett said, his big green eyes on his blond father. Harry put his hand on Draco's arm in the hope of calming him down.
A high-pitched scream made Harry stand up suddenly the next day. He looked down at Draco, who was still sleeping peacefully, not at all disturbed by the roar. Harry pulled himself out of the blonde's arms and pulled on his pants quickly before heading to the door. He opened it on the fly and fell on a rather puzzling show. Jordan and Nathaniel were sitting on the bed of the last and seemed extremely tired and bored. In front of them, Lyra shouted at them under the amused laughter of their other siblings.
“What do you want Malfoy?” Ron asked angrily.
“He surely realized that” Ezekiel finally whispered.
“Do you need to know about the events?” Blaise asked him.
“The Horcrux attacked you because he felt another Horcrux, Harry. You” Harry's eyes widened.
As for the children, the three girls had found a plan but refused to share it with Ezekiel, wishing the surprise to be maintained. The day of December 30th went like this.
“We all agree that Erin is the best seeker?” Zachady asked. They all agreed.
“It's Lena, Emerik and Ethan” Ezekiel announced.
He heard a knock on the door. Probably his mother, he thought vaguely, because really they were only two in this house.
“I don’t know, Harry. I mean, do you really think a sixteen year old boy would want to talk about his love life to his dad?” Harry nodded. Draco was probably right but Harry couldn’t shake the feeling that he should help his son.
“We'll finally know more about this” Hermione announced happily.
Draco was pulled out of his thoughts at the feel of his trousers sliding down his legs while Potter brushed his lips against his dick. Draco couldn’t help but moan in anticipation of what was to come.
“Nah, Dumbledore”
“Why not you, Ezekiel?” Draco asked, rather uncomfortable knowing that Horcrux was running in Harry.
“Apparently, this girl did something to Eleanor and our children are doing the interrogation. Rather violent, I might add” Harry explained, shrugging his shoulders.
“It's because of the lemon candy” Her mouth then formed a perfect "O". Draco reassured them all with a smile and went upstairs. He laid Harry on the bed and took off his clothes, leaving him only in his underwear. He folded the covers over him and watched him for a few seconds. He was really beautiful.
“He's sleeping, the twins too” Harry let a relieved smile settle on his lips.
Several days passed where Harry and Draco managed not to faint and hide their relationship. Only they didn’t see each other much. They slept together at night, but spent most of their day avoiding each other for fear of literally jumping on each other. Then that day finally arrived. They had kindly gone to have their breakfasts and without really knowing how it had happened, they had been alone in the room.
“Skott and Isaak Black-Snape” One of them said. Harry was grinning, he knew one who was going to be happy. Harry started to get up to hug them, but Draco held him by the waist, remembering that the brunette was wearing only a boxer. The four boys smirked.
“Because you've had twins twice and triplets once” Erin murmured. Harry became considerably pale at these words. If he was not too idiotic, six of his children were here and Ezekiel and Nathaniel had a sister, so that was seven. Then he was almost sure that the two pairs of twins were not there, so eleven. He had eleven children! It was really too much to learn in one night. He dropped his head against the table, groaning.
“So, what exactly do we do about that stupid wall?” Eleanor jumped down the table and Ezekiel took her place, standing on it.
Molly was standing on the doorstep with her mouth open, her eyes wide and a pile of broken plates at her feet. She stared at them with a horrified look.
“It works for me” Lucius finally declared. Draco decided to leave the room, not wanting to hear how Harry would risk his life while he would be waiting for him. He went through his bathroom to take a potion to get the pain from his back and then went into the living room where an argument was taking place. When he reached the bottom of the stairs, he narrowly avoided a vase that crashed against the wall behind him. Finally, it was not a fight. The triplets were in the center of the room and made all the objects in the room fly around them. Lyra and Erin came to join him.
“Do it then” Harry told him aloud.
“He doesn’t reject me!” Dimitri shouted, a little louder than he should have. The door marked "Zabini-Weasley" opened on Zachady and Jordan.
Nathaniel sat down besides his brother.
‘Are we good?’ Draco asked mentally. Harry nodded.
“I think you've perfectly corrected my eyesight Draco” Draco's eyes were wide and he did not understand anything.
He introduced a third finger into Draco's intimacy. The latter moaned harder when Harry touched his sore spot with his three fingers. After a little while, Harry withdrew his fingers and Draco groaned in discontent. The blonde knew right away why Harry had pulled away when he felt something much bigger at his entrance. He grit his teeth in advance, knowing that it was going to hurt. Harry penetrated him extremely gently. The brunet shook Draco faster, making him relax faster than he thought.
“Who plays at Hogwarts?” Blaise asked.
“Do you want to stay here tonight?” Harry asked slowly, still breathing like he’d run for days. Draco quickly turned his head towards the boy beside him with a questioning look. ‘Have I heard well? He wants me to stay with him?’ He asked himself.
“Irina! Let him go, he's my daddy… So it’s not you who should be hugged” Harry opened his mouth wide and his eyes widened, as did his three friends.
“You’re okay? What is it?” Draco immediately asked him, grabbing his shoulders.
“Now is the time for me to inform you of certain things” Harry frowned.
“I’m sorry” Harry whispered, his breath landing on Draco’s lips. “I didn’t mean it”
“When we’ll faint, you won’t say the same thing” He warned. Draco laughed lightly and then put an arm around Harry's shoulders.
“Wait, did all this happen the same evening? Alarik asked.
“No! it’s Lyra!” Joris rinsed.
“Easy” He simply said. He then placed his back against the wall of the pool, holding himself up with his elbows. He continued as he looked back in Harry’s direction. “You spend all your free time following me around under that stupid cloak of yours” He chuckled again when Harry groaned for being so stupid. He groaned a second time, internally this time, because he realized he quite like the sound of Malfoy chuckling. “Oh and also there’s the fact that the room is silent and that you were breathing so loudly the entire floor could probably hear you”
“We should go” Harry said, getting up. He held out a hand to help him stand up and they returned to their belongings and dressed. All the others did the same and then they went back to the castle, a storm getting ready behind them. Harry wondered what time it was and the time magically appeared in front of him, as if he had launched a Tempus, he had not launched anything. It was almost four. Harry watched as Draco walked not far from him and he was struck by a revelation. A very, very big revelation. He was falling in love with the blond Slytherin and it frightened him. He froze first in the middle of the corridor, completely petrified. Then, after several of the children nearly hit him, he started walking again quickly, very fast. He climbed the stairs four at a time and rushed to the new apartments almost while running.
Dimi and Zeph. Harry was sitting on the ground in another corner, Draco behind him. Draco’s head was on his shoulder and from time to time, he was whispering things in his ear.
"Stop making that face, you know just as well as me that I have a gift a hundred times more awesome than this book up there but that I want to offer you when we are alone" A big smile extended then on the blonde's lips and the rest of the day went relatively well. In the days that followed, Molly continued to avoid them and unfortunately Draco and Harry never had the opportunity to exchange their presents. Harry vaguely wondered why the children seemed to never be there.
“No worries” Harry replied in a strangled voice that finally ended in a long moan as Draco moved slightly his hips with a smirk.
It was Harry's turn to scream. Then followed a fierce battle until they couldn’t breathe anymore. They finally collapsed laughing on the shore. They were out of breath and Harry suddenly laughed. Draco turned his head towards him and Harry could feel his questioning through his arm in contact with his.
"Then for Gryffindor, Erin is the seeker, Zach's twin sister is the keeper, Seth's sister and one of Uncle Dean's and Uncle Seamus’s daughter are the beaters and Alarik’s twin sister, one of Uncle Ron and Uncle Blaise’s daughter and Pansy's daughter are the chasers.
Issue number two: Ron hadn’t spoken to him since he knew he was with Draco, in fact he wasn’t speaking to anyone and was really snarling. And problem number three: Severus, Sirius, Remus and even Lucius and Narcissa were coming with them. He felt that these holidays were not going to be easy.
"Don’t run, it's useless and you know it" He heard in his head as he reached the stairs to the apartment. He stopped dead on his way to wait for Draco.
“And you play Quidditch?” Draco asked.
“Where’s Emett?” Lyra asked as she stood in front of him.
Several days had passed and Harry was spending all his free time staring at the locket. Draco sighed once more next to him.
“How do you know that?” She then showed Joris and Eleanor with her hand.
“What's on the other side?” Harry asked.
“Level four” Nathaniel added, raising a finger.
He looked down and saw his son, an air of pure panic on his face. He stooped down and took him in his arms, stalling his head in the crook of his neck. It was at this moment that Harry realized that one hand was still holding his hand and that it was not Lesath’s. He turned his head to Malfoy after looking at their joined hands. The latter had just made the same observation and they dropped their hand in haste, their cheeks red. Ron passed in front of them, looking furious, and he descended the stairs with a furious step. Harry, Hermione and Malfoy stared at each other, not understanding the situation. Then the door opened again, allowing Zabini to pass, who seemed much calmer. He laughed lightly as he saw them all in front of his door, Harry's and Malfoy's children being out of the way too.
“Can’t you two let go for two minutes?” She said to Jordan and Nathaniel who were holding hands.
“Are you looking for mistletoe?”
“Interesting hypothesis, let's try with your redhead friend” Harry turned his gaze to him and laughed. He then asked Ron, still in his corner, alone. The red then advanced towards them.
