"Well, no." Harry set down his cup on the table before rubbing his hands along the tops of his thighs, taking in a breath that did nothing to settle his nerves. "It's just good tea is all."
Harry knew he had to look as foolish as he felt, mouth hanging open as he tried to articulate why this matter to him when he still didn't really have a clue. He just couldn't let this go. "I just think you should."
Malfoy was single. In a world where they could manage to actually speak to each other they could maybe, actually go out. He had no idea how to make that happen, but Harry decided to count it as progress all the same.
Malfoy just let out a short ugly laugh, the echoes of his old self bleeding through into his expression for the first time. "Yes Potter, shockingly I can manage a cup of tea."
"Funny," Harry said quickly as he stepped back up to his full height, looking straight at Malfoy.
"Malfoy," Harry said in a rush, only to watch in disbelief as Malfoy turned back walked away on quick steps before he could even really look at him, like Malfoy hadn't heard or seen him at all. In just a moment Malfoy was lost to the crowd, leaving Harry standing there alone, like he'd been that way from the start. He wasn't sure how long he stood there staring at the spot Malfoy had disappeared before he heard the first whistle of the train's arrival, feet moving him back on their own to where Ron and Hermione stood.
"What?" Malfoy asked incredulously, giving voice to Harry's very own internal question.
Harry took a bite of his roll just to give himself a moment before he had to respond, truly hating his inability to just not talk for once. "I just thought you know, new year and everything. Might be nice."
"Malfoy," he panted out when he finally caught up to him, jogging up next to him before finally coming to a stop when Malfoy did, resting his hands against his knees.
"Do you really want to know?" Zabini finally asked in a sly voice. "I'll tell you if you tell me why you want to know."
Hermionie's expression went pinched. "I just think–"
For how many times he'd been desperate for the last word with Malfoy Harry couldn't bring himself to enjoy it now, especially when the word had been Malfoy's name and they both had to know Harry only wanted to say more.
"What if he hadn't come back? He made it seem like he–I wasn't sure if he would even be here." Harry swallowed, looking down at his plate as he willed away the expressions from both of their faces, like they knew exactly what this was about when he still didn't have a clue.
"Yeah," Harry said when they broke apart, his breath heavy. "I think you'll let me catch you again."
"Right," Harry said dumbly, unable to stop himself from gaping at him like a fool. Malfoy looked the same but somehow different from a few weeks before, not quite as tired maybe, like a tension was gone from his shoulders Harry hadn't known was there to begin with. It looked good on him. "You look good."
"Whatever this is," he said swiftly, standing up from his seat, "I want no part of it."
Harry just hummed against him, sliding one hand from his hip to Malfoys lower back, rubbing just along the top of his pants. He leaned up to bite along Malfoy's jaw just as he let the tip of his fingers graze just barely underneath fabric. Malfoy shook all over, dropping his head down onto Harry's shoulder as he pressed up into his hand, moaning into the fabric of his shirt when Harry pushed his hand all the way underneath, gripping him as he continued to pull Malfoy down against him.
"I wonder if he got a new wand?" Hermione said from her seat next to Ron, joining the conversation for the first time. "I've read that it's rather tricky to find a new match, especially the older you get. Some wizards never find a match that feels anything close to their first."
Malfoy didn't say anything, just continued to stand there like he didn't understand a single thing that was happening. Irrationality Harry had to bite back the urge to smile, charmed when he knew there was no reason to be. He'd loved it too much for more years than he wanted to think about each time Malfoy had lost himself to frustration. Harry couldn't imagine the reaction ever leaving him now.
Heat blossomed between them, and Draco’s hand slid up Potter’s back to still him, but it was no use as Potter ground into him. The vampire groaned, a full-body shudder that forced Draco’s eyes open at the needy sound, and he watched as his blood spilled out of Potter’s mouth, running in crimson rivers down his forearm. Potter pulled back and swiped his tongue across the flat of his wrist, chasing the red trails with a darkened tongue.
Strong, sure hands manipulated Draco's body, rolling him over until his stomach hit the mattress. Potter's mouth worked a blistering trail down his spine, alternating biting with kissing, sucking with licking. The pads of fingers pressed hard, mapping over Draco's skin with sweet cruelty, as if Potter could brand his want there like an indelible stain. Potter's hands gripped the backs of his thighs and he pushed, forcing Draco upward to his knees.
The sound is broken, but it's not what Harry really wants. He wants to impress himself upon Draco, to fill his every sense with Harry's presence. To envelope him in pleasure. To extract every last piece of Draco's self-control. Until Draco knows nothing but Harry. Feels nothing but Harry.
Ron beams back at him. "Might have done."
Draco lifted his chin. "So fucking what? You've had the ability to make a choice all along. You're an insult to those of us who didn't. You want to die? Fine. Do it. You want to live?" Draco bared his neck and jerked Potter to him. "Then do it. I've made my decision. You need to make yours."
The ensuite is appointed in the same grand vein as the rest of the chamber: spacious, elegant, and luxuriously inviting. Harry turns the shower on and chucks off his pajamas as steam starts billowing out. He steps in, assaulted on all sides from the six showerheads. Harry groans and braces his hands on the tile at the glorious feel of the hot water. The tile must be charmed because it's warm beneath his hands. No bracing cold. He turns and presses his back to it, throwing his head back in pleasure. The pounding spray is heavenly, and the warm tile against his back feels so good he wants to sink into it.
“There are three responses that spring to mind.” Granger’s eyes widened expectantly, tinged with something that looked like hope. He ticked off his forefinger. “First, no.” His middle finger followed. “Second, when in the hell did Harry Potter become a vampire?” Ring finger. “And third, fuck, no.”
Draco recoiled as if slapped, jerking his hand from Potter. The admission stung, far more than he wanted to admit to himself, but he took a deep breath and forced down the unwanted emotion. He laid cool eyes on Potter and said smoothly, “It’s the bond, that’s all. You’ll just have to get used to it. We both will. Now,” he went on, raising his right arm again, “first bite validates the contract. Do it and we can go.”
“No,” Potter repeated.
Harry drew a finger alongside Draco's neck, unsurprised when Draco's head tilted to allow him access. His skin brushed over Draco's, stopping to press lightly at the marks on his neck. Draco hissed through clenched teeth, his restraint obvious by his hesitant swallow. Harry felt the blood underneath the surface, swirling under his fingertip, calling in a way he could not resist.
Harry captures Draco's lips and kisses him with fierce abandon. He pulls back with a smack of wet lips and grins. "That's because it doesn't."
“Don’t,” Potter said through clenched teeth.
Potter stared down at him with eyes that had grown darker in color. The bright emerald deepened to almost black and swirled with a fire and ferocity that beckoned Draco to their depths. Inexorably, their faces grew closer and Draco was sure that Potter was about to kiss him savagely when a familiar, but unplaceable scent drew his attention.
"Go into the other room," Harry says, once he feels his voice is steady enough. "Wait for me in front of the cabinet."
"Well, here we are," Narcissa says, a little breathless. She exhales softly, partly to steady herself from the chill, and partly to steady herself in general. For some reason, Neville Longbottom has her spinning off-kilter. "Care to take a closer look?"
“What?”
The fine hairs on the back of Harry's neck stood on end as the taste of her worry grew into something darker.
Potter leaned in and whispered against his lips, "And would you wear my ring if I offered you one?"
Draco scrambles to his feet and regrips himself, leaning forward to use his left hand to reach back and gingerly trace around his arse. The touch is energizing, and flashes quick in his blood like fire. His hole twitches as he works in one finger, then two, aided by the only wandless spell he can still manage. The same one every boy of a certain age learns to master. It's awkward, standing in this position, panting and jerking and fucking himself with lube-slick fingers, but he imagines Harry on the other side of the glass, watching him through the fog. Eyes bright and pupils blown, his gaze never wavering on Draco's every move.
"Yes, Harry."
Draco left Potter dazed in the moonlight, the blissful hum of self-satisfaction bubbling inside. He made it five steps before Potter’s hushed whisper caught up to his ears.
“Did you mean that?” Harry asked. “About family? That we’re all the same now?”
Draco flips around and Harry gets a good look at his face. The man is wrecked. Sweaty, flushed, and glassy-eyed. There are smears of wet paint across his chest and thighs from where they pressed together earlier, leaving colorful, patchy smears on Draco's alabaster skin, hiding in the faint ridges of the scars on his chest. The halo of normally perfectly-coiffed hair is damp and mussed, his lips are red and parted, and his cock—his cock is long and hard, purpled with need, wet and shiny at the tip.
Harry steps back and reaches for the buckle at Draco's left wrist. He unfastens it and takes Draco's hand. Harry turns his hand over and brushes a sweet kiss on the palm before guiding it beneath the waistband of his trousers. He places Draco's hand over his spent cock and squeezes.
“P-Potter,” he managed in a weak rasp.
Malfoy takes in a deep breath and lets it out with an amused sigh. "Ah, yes, Cook. The house-elf formerly known as 'Tinky'. She insists we call her Cook."
The indignant splutter that forces its way from Draco's mouth is loud in the open air. "And just what am I supposed to do about
Draco came down the stairs to find Potter sitting on the edge of the sofa cushion, rubbing a tired hand over his face.
Potter’s hips surged forward on a powerful draw, and Draco threw his head back and keened at the sudden pressure of their aligning erections. His wet pajamas provided a cruel and maddening friction, rubbing in ways that only served to heighten the feeling.
"Seven sound good to you, sweetheart?" she asks Draco.
Anger seeps back into Draco's words. "Confront it? There's nothing to confront! You've realized there's a convenient toy within your reach, and you just want to fuck with it to pass the time."
She swallowed the lump in her throat. “The bond will assert itself on you. Painfully. Deadly.”
The pop of a house-elf catches both their attention. "Master Harry Potter's room is being ready now," Blinky says with a chirp. "Miss Cissa is wanting him in the room across from Master Dragon."
Harry's lip curled. "Where the fuck is Draco, Valeria?"
She pulls back and presses a warm kiss to his cheek, drifting out of his hold with a swish of her skirts before she heads for Malfoy. Harry's breath stalls in his chest as he watches Narcissa enfold Malfoy with the same slow movements. He expected it to be a sort of lip service, what she said earlier about the wards recognizing him as family. But now, seeing her with Draco, it hits home. She's treating him exactly the same way she treats Malfoy. Not as a guest, not even as a friend, but as a son.
Harry snorts. "Yes, I can see how this would be troublesome."
"It was the right thing to do."
"You don't have to do this. I wasn't expecting any sort of reciprocation. Especially not like this."
Harry laughed at the mental image of Molly shoving a shrieking Ginny out the front door. “She really called her an obnoxious twat?”
"It was a pleasure. I'll call on you soon."
There was some grumbling around the table at the mention of Percy, but it died out quickly.
“Well, you’re looking a bit better, at any rate,” she said. “Still a little too pale for my liking, though. Get some sunshine.”
Harry's singular focus is the artfully tousled head of platinum, gleaming underneath the gallery's house lights. It's fitting, because that chiseled profile is a work of fucking art, more beautiful that any sculpture ever created by man or magic.
Potter's green eyes flashed at the use of his given name, and he didn't waste a second before opening up and swallowing him down, pushing Draco's hips flat against the wall for leverage. Potter's mouth wasn't as hot, not without Draco's blood recently coursing through him. The sensation was still killer, warm and wet, the whole situation made hotter by the sight of Potter on his knees. That was enough for Draco.
"See," Harry said easily as he dropped his hand. "Not in the hallway."
"Since fourth year," Malfoy said with a smirk, picking up his quill to twirl it back and forth between his long slender fingers. Harry wondered if they were as cold as they had felt before. "It could probably use an update, now that you mention it."
When Malfoy stepped back into the room he had a silver tray in hand with two china cups on it, as well as a bowl for sugar and a little pitcher for what Harry was assuming was milk. Malfoy set it down on the table in front of the couch as he sat in the chair opposite, turning an expectant look to Harry who was still standing uselessly by the doorway. Harry quickly moved to sit down, reaching out to put one sugar in his tea before taking a drink.
Harry nodded, letting them both fall into their own conversation as he lifted his head to let his eyes travel over the platform, ignoring all the sets of young wide eyed that were looking back at them. He had to wonder if they'd all really been that small as first years, knowing that somehow they had been. His eyes locked on a narrow frame and blonde hair and Harry was taking a step forward before he even realized, quickling stopping himself in what he hoped past as something casual and not the random jerking step forward that he was sure it had been.
He wished he could follow his lead but Harry couldn't even bring himself to move from the bed, laid out watching the ceiling as he ignored the two essays he had due that weren't even halfway finished.
"You went to see Malfoy?" Ron asked in a startlingly loud voice, bringing all the conversations around them down with it. "At his
He honestly didn't know what was wrong with him anymore.
"It's not like you don't already know," Harry said easily, endlessly distracted by the bit of hair curling by Malfoys ear. It really was ridiculously unfair that he could look that good doing nothing but sitting there, wearing the same robes as everyone else and yet somehow looking better than anyone ever had. "You're probably one of the few people who knows just how shit I am at quite a few different things."
Malfoy smiled at him again, like it was that easy all of a sudden, like he wasn't destroying Harry just by sitting there finally talking to him, looking that way while he did. "I think I can manage."
"I can go," Harry softly, unable to pull his eyes away even though every moment he looked at him like this felt like a step too far, something he knew Malfoy never would have given to him freely.
Malfoy didn't stop again and didn't say anything, but Harry could see the way his shoulders were tensed, hands grasped into fists only to fall loose again at his sides. Just before they reached the door to the classroom Harry reached out to grab his arm, with no need to hold him back at all before Malfoy stopped, like just Harry's touch alone was enough to keep him there.
"Right." Harry took another drink just so he had something to do with his hands. Malfoy had made no move to pick up his own cup, openly watching him though Harry could hardly bring himself to meet his eye in return.
The thought was still with him when Harry woke up in the morning, refusing to be pushed aside.
"Not really, no." Harry said easily. Shame didn't seem to factor in, not when it got him here, finally next to Mafloy and actually talking with him. It seemed there was shockingly little he wouldn't do to get here anymore.
"Can't wait to hear it," Harry said through a brittle smile, feeling like a walking talking pile of garbage.
"Why didn't you meet me?" Harry asked quietly, very aware of all the people moving past them.
Harry swallowed, forcing his eyes from across the room again, swearing to himself it would be the last time. "Sorry, I didn't get any sleep last night, can't seem to focus today."
"Don't," Malfoy said in a bitten off voice, pulling his hands into fists in his lap.
"A bit," he said after a moment, tilting his head to the side as he watched Harry, doing nothing to hide the amusement in his voice. "Why?"
"No reason," Harry said quickly as he realized what a mistake this had been, knowing anything he said was bound to get back to Malfoy.
"Don't just say no because you think you should, only say no if you really don't want to," Harry pressed out in a rush, hardly able to focus on forming words with Malfoy so close and under his hand, breathing like they were doing much more than just sitting next to each other.
Harry let out an uneasy laugh, feeling his face begin to burn. "That's the only reason I could be glad to see you? Head injury?"
He was done letting the past control what he did now. There wasn't any reason for him to be afraid of an empty room.
Harry just nodded, hardly listening as he tried to ignore his steadily increasing headache. He hadn't been able to sleep much at all last night, his mind stuck on everything that was about to happen, about to change. He still had no idea how he was going to deal with any of it. Even the thought of what classes he would take had seemed like a suddenly overwhelming task, essentially deciding his future with a few checks on a piece of parchment. After everything it felt like a waste, like it couldn't possibly begin to matter, though Harry had been careful to keep that thought to himself.
Malfoy made some affronted noise, eyes darting around to see if anyone was listening before turning to walk towards the classroom again.
"How have you been?" Harry asked dumbly, waiting for the floor to split open and swallow him whole.
Malfoy actually smiled at him then, such a small thing it was hardly even there at all, but it was all Harry could see, all he wanted to see. He really was unfairly beautiful. "Would you like a list?" Malfoy asked, his eyes still warm.
He really needed to learn to think before he spoke, not even really sure what he wanted to ask, just desperate to know anything at all, for Malfoy to know that he wanted to know.
It said something for his self control that he managed to hold back a smile as he looked at Slughorn, fighting to keep his voice earnest as he spoke. "I think partnering with Mafloy would help me to catch up, he's always gotten top marks in potions."
"Yes well," Slughorn said in a rush, shuffling a few quills uselessly around his desk. "I suppose you're right. As long as there aren't any problems it should be fine."
The great hall was as packed as it ever was during the opening feast, so much so that Harry couldn't seem to get a clear line of sight to the Slytherin table no matter how hard he tried. He'd given up on subtly about half way through the meal, sure that talk of their new rooms and the new sets of rules would distract everyone from what he was doing. It worked surprisingly well up until the moment it didn't.
"I've got Seamus and Mafloy," Neville went on, with obvious disappointment in his voice.
"Do you?" Zabini asked. "Because there is generally only one reason someone wants to know if someone is single, and I can't imagine it's why you want to know."
"Stop following me Potter, charms isn't down this hallway."
"What do you think?" Zabini said after a moment, face back to looking at Harry like he was surprised he could manage to put two words together. "He's not exactly a catch this year."
Realizing he was dangerously close to running but unable to care what he looked like Harry closed the distance to the door, flinging it open and himself through it in one movement. Stepping forward in a rush Harry quickly darted his eyes around the surrounding hallway entrances, but of course Malfoy was nowhere in sight. Harry let his shoulders sag, wondering why he'd even come out here, what he thought might have happened if they'd actually spoken to each other.
Malfoy shook his head as that same look of disbelief back on his face, his voice completely incredulous. "Why?"
Harry had been so close to the edge for such a long time it felt he hardly had any warning before static was suddenly rushing between his ears, pulsing in Malfoy's hand as his words looped in his mind. Harry felt so good it was almost terrifying for a moment, eyes falling shut as pleasure twisted him up and pulled him apart inside. Malfoy just kept touching him through all of it, until his cock gave one last jerk and Harry was finally pulling away, oversensitive and exhausted.
voice.
"I don't know if that's quite true anymore though," Harry said, eyes stuck on the line of Malfoys jaw.
Harry bit back the urge to defend Malfoy, realizing there wasn't much of anything he could say to that. It took a moment for him to even realize what Zabini's words meant, what he'd even said.
"Don't you need it?" Harry managed to meet Malfoy's eyes again, his own drifting down to where Malfoy was biting his bottom lip. Harry cleared his throat. "I mean, especially with school starting again soon."
Unable to stop himself Harry brought his other hand around to join the first, cuping Malfoys ass in both hands as he rolled up into him, letting his eyes fall shut for a moment, completely overwhelmed. Malfoy felt dangerously good pressed against him like this, hot and hard but also pliant and soft, letting out a close to constant stream of bitten off moans into his ear, pressing back into his hands like he couldn't get enough of the feeling of them on him.
What is crystal clear is that there is nothing Harry won't do to keep Draco from being hurt.
He takes no pleasure in telling Potter that’s exactly why he won’t be returning. He has no wish to go back to the way things were, even without a noseless, genocidal maniac haunting his every move. He’ll be starting a potions apprenticeship in France in the spring, at the posthumous request of his godfather, thank you very much. It seems disloyal to ignore Snape’s wishes he tells Potter, especially after the lengths he went to on Draco’s behalf.
Nothing.
“Perhaps we can relegate ‘Ferret’ and ‘Weasel’ to the manliest of jibes? However, the occasional ‘Draco’ or ‘Ronald’ wouldn’t be amiss, don’t you think?” Draco replied.
"Do you like that? Being restrained?" Harry asks, pitching his voice low.
"You did."
Draco's face is set in determination, hands held close at his side.
me! What makes you think he won't?"
Ron’s shoulders drooped and he pitched forward to put his head in his hands. “I don’t even want to know who you have in mind, do I?” he murmured.
it—" His words cut off, and he turned back around, realization written on the planes of his face. Potter clamored back, shaken. "If—if you weren't under, then why did you—?" Potter's voice broke. "It looked like you were," he stuttered. "It looked like you wanted—" Potter stopped there, brows knit over confused eyes.
"I think you'll find him agreeable. After all—"
He can feel her stiffen beside him at the use of Blaise's name. His mother hates Blaise. Has always hated Blaise. Even in school.
For all his softness and sex appeal, Gilles is also unbearably camp, a trait which Draco absolutely abhors with a passion. Good breeding and fussiness are one thing, but the over the top, attention grabbing diva routine is just gauche. Draco is open and out, make no mistake, his preferences are easily discerned at a glance, but his behavior is impeccable. Honestly, there’s no need to announce to anyone within a five-kilometer radius that he likes it up the arse. It’s simply no one’s business but his own.
Harry stops.
will stand beside
Draco's gray eyes blow wide with either shock or arousal, possibly a bit of both. He splutters, but can't manage a coherent retort.
Potter sat at the opposite end of the sofa, tucking himself in to face Draco as if they were sitting down to tea. “Is that something you see yourself doing, then? Potions?”
"Very good," he says, raking his eyes over Draco's pale form. His cock is hard, jutting out from his body, and his eyes sparkle in the light. He's trembling slightly, but he's making a concerted effort to keep himself under control.
But not yet.
“I should have known,” Potter said breathlessly.
Because Harry says.
Draco's neck cranes upward to take in the structure. "Merlin's fucking balls, Harry. Just—" Draco's head snaps around to stare at him with desire. "Put me in it, yeah?"
Draco snorted and palmed Potter's cheek, forcing him to make eye contact. Potter's breath hitched at the flash he knew his eyes reflected. His voice pitched low in warning. "Listen to me, Potter. I am not like others, and you will not treat me as such. I am more than capable of deciding what I can take and what I can't." Potter tensed even more and Draco pushed him back to peer into his face. Resolve clamped down and his words poured forth with determination as he ground out with force, "I am the only person in this world who will take everything you have to give and then throw it back in your face and demand more. Because I deserve it." Potter's breath came faster and his hand reached out to curl around Draco's knee. "I don't care about what happened before. I don't even care about who came before. Because I will be the last. I am the only one you will ever need for the rest of your life, and I expect the reward I am due." A low, feral whine slipped through Potter's parted lips and Draco smiled. "Because I am yours. This is yours for the taking." Potter gasped out a rough groan as Draco wrapped his hand around Potter's leaking cock and squeezed. "I want it, all of it. Now give me what's mine."
She jerked back as Harry’s fist hit the table. “What life is this?” he hissed. “You can’t imagine what this hell has been like for me!”
"Whatever you like, love."
Harry kisses him, soft and sweet at first, but with more passion as Draco opens for him. The first taste of Draco's tongue is heady, and he gets a little moan for his effort.
Granger dutifully ignored the outburst of her husband, waving her parchment instead. “I see you’ve validated the contract with the First Bite. That’s popped off and been filed with the Ministry. I have a copy of your release paperwork here, it’s been recorded and I’ll owl this to you at Grimmauld, Harry.”
Ron looks flummoxed across the table, spluttering an incoherent protest. After a moment of Harry and his wife both glaring at him, he manages to find his words. "So what will you do now?"
Draco shut the door and walked further into the room, but stopped short when Potter’s head jerked up again at the noise.
“You need to eat. The first bite wasn’t enough.” Draco hoped the invitation in his words was clear, because somehow the thought of asking Potter to bite him wasn’t palatable at all. That would imply a measure of want on Draco’s part, and that was something he didn’t want to think about. Not ever. No, Potter was as stubborn as the day was long, and the idiotic Gryffindor would need to be prodded. Prodded like a surly old mule. Possibly with some kicking. Potter’s fangs and the deadly expression he had given Granger popped into his mind. But not tonight.
"Just open the door, Draco."
Draco raises his head and gasps, skin flushing a perfect shade of pink. His erection bobs out in front of him, clearly pleased at what is on display before him. His hands slide behind his back to clasp together, and Harry has to bite his lip to keep from moaning at the sight of him.
"Please stop analyzing me," he groans.
Draco backs off and pads to the door across the room without question. There wasn't a cabinet in there before, but now that Harry wants one, he knows it'll be there. The Manor has been particularly on point with his wishes thus far.
The finality of the statement has a second to linger in the air before Malfoy huffs in that old, familiar way, and rolls his eyes. "You're just going to hang out here and blunder about our lives until you," he makes sarcastic finger quotes in the air, "
Granger’s face was warm and pleased as she took Draco’s hands and pressed a small kiss to his cheek. “Draco, you’re here.”
Potter thrust against him, no doubt fueled by Draco’s blood, and that made it all the hotter. He was responsible for this. Potter would never, ever come undone like this with anyone else for the rest of his life. The thought was heady and intoxicating, and even though he belonged to Potter as his Consort, to anyone on the outside looking in, it would appear that it was Potter who was lost, Potter who was bound. The power in that realization thrummed along his skin in time to Potter’s open-mouthed panting against his chest, and Draco held him tight as they rocked themselves to a grunted completion.
Wonderful. He supposes he should be glad that Gilles never drank red wine, otherwise his five-thousand pound bespoke Huntsman suit would be ruined. Draco makes his way to the bar when a chuckle draws his eye to the right. As if this evening can’t get any worse, fucking Potter is slouched against the bar rail, sipping his drink, looking for all the world like he’s just been thoroughly entertained.
Draco's hand is flying over his cock. It's flushed an angry red, and is glistening from the lube and the copious amounts of pre-come that has oozed from the tip. His left hand has turned over and is now digging into the flesh of his thigh, leaving crescent-shaped nail marks behind that are dotted with pinpricks of blood.
"Power and control are two different things."
Silvestri glided forward on a silent whisper, his tall form exuding vampiric grace. “It’s been six months. He has been given quarter after his Turning, as is customary for all those Turned against their will. His perpetrator was caught and brought to justice for the crime. We have made allowances in deference to both his situation and his stature among your world. The fact remains that he has taken that generosity and thrown it back in our collective faces. To allow him to continue this reckless and dangerous behavior puts both the Wizarding and vampire communities, not to mention the humans, at risk.”
Potter stepped closer to the table. “You asked what I miss. I miss treacle tart.”
He can't say no. His brain won't let him. Harry's voice is rough when he says, "Say your piece."
Three months gone and here was, from the outset at least, a rational and composed Potter. Far different from the cagey and volatile man he'd seen plenty of. Asking for a discussion, no less. Not pleading, not shouting, not demanding. Something had indeed happened to Potter, and frankly, Draco was inclined to hear him out.
"Maybe it is a mistake. But it's mine to make, not yours."
Potter shook his head firmly. "No. It doesn't erase anything, and I don't expect you to just forget the way I treated you. I have good days and bad days. More good days now than anything. But I want you in my life, Draco. Every day, present, real. Not owl post every other day."
To reach for Harry is to reach for his own happiness. On whatever terms Harry sees fit. Draco has to either accept that, and place all his trust in Harry, or live with the regret he knows will certainly follow if he doesn't.
“You had an issue,” Harry pointed out.
Draco reels back, turning his arm. The Mark glares at him, and a roll of nausea creeps into his throat. He stares at the tattoo, stark and malevolent against the pallor of his skin, reminding him of who he is. The kind of man he will always be. The kind of man who enjoys kneeling for another man's pleasure. The kind of man who needs this sort of depravity. Who needs to debase himself to feel whole. He is sick. Sick and twisted like the snake on his arm. Sick and twisted like the snake he tried to become. Sick and twisted standing in the shower, jacking into his fist like a fiend, because Harry told him to.
“All the curtains are spelled closed,” Potter offered, noting his glance around the room. “For a reason,” he added. “And if you tamper with them, you’ll get a nasty shock.” He smirked. “If you’re lucky.”
Harry runs a hand over the line of his suit. "Narcissa, actually. I'd be lucky to have on matching socks if it weren't for her."
Potter spoke the last sentence with a sense of conflicted wonder, and his fingers trailed across the back of Draco’s hand, finally covering it with his palm. He was cool to the touch, not the glacial temperature Draco had been expecting, and oddly, Potter was growing warmer by the second. Sure enough, when he pressed down, there was nothing. He felt faintly sick at the thought of Potter’s empty chest and what lay beneath it now. But Potter’s fingers started drumming again, and Draco closed his eyes to concentrate on his own heartbeat.
“Well, you certainly know how to sweet-talk a bloke.” Draco scoffed, affecting Potter’s tone, “’Disfigurement looks good on you, Malfoy’.” He sneered and continued, “Nice fangs, Potter.” Potter’s eyes narrowed. “Stings doesn’t it?”
"Your two best friends are going to announce the impending birth of their child, and you can't get your head out of your arse to spend an hour to support them?" Draco scoffed. "I don't know what the hell is wrong with you, but you can grow some balls and bloody well give Hermione your regrets to her face, you fucking coward."
“Nope,” he smiled. “Vampirism is a sure career killer.”
Harry paled as her words struck home. “Are you finished?”
She swatted his arm. “Stop it.”
"I'm enamoured of her already," Harry replies. The warmth he feels inside seeps out into his tone. "Thank you, Draco. It means more than you know."
"And what about Blaise, hm?" his mother shoots back, sliding from her chair in an angry swish of silver satin to stand before him. "You fell into his bed knowing what sort of lover he was."
The door opens and Draco strides into the room on purposeful feet, shoes tapping lightly on the wooden floor. "I'm not disturbing you, am I?"
Loss.
Potter swallowed and staggered back, head hung low, gasping for air.
Potter shook his head, shoving his hands in his pockets. "No, it isn't."
The proverbial ball is rolling, and Harry thinks it's time he made himself a little more visible in Draco's vision. "I think Blaise Zabini had you on your knees and didn't have the first clue what to do with you."
"Why don't I know about this?" Harry snapped. "Why didn't he say anything?"
"—just five minutes, Ron. Please."
“And?”
The bit of praise is like a touch because Draco shifts to sit taller in his chair, and the deep, satisfactory breath he takes mirrors the sudden gleam in his eyes. He's proud of himself.
"No," Draco replied. "I was looking for Potter."
"Thank you, Harry." The words are whispered into his neck with sincere gratitude and a heavy layer of fondness.
“I have it,” Harry said from his end of the sofa, not looking up.
“Potter, wait!” he called. Potter turned, his face looking twice as wan as before.
This time, Silvestri cut his eyes to Harry as he leaned into Draco's neck, open mouth hovering the marks. "Yes, but you wouldn't listen to me!" he hissed. Draco shivered beneath him, and he chuckled. "Now do I have your attention?"
“I didn’t say there wasn’t risk involved,” she replied. “But I thought being able to walk out of here free would be enough to encourage you.” She spread her hands. “And that’s the truth. If you bind yourself to Harry and become his Consort, all charges against you will be dropped, your sentence overturned, and what’s left of your vaults will be returned to you. Now, the Manor was seized quite some time ago, and along with the rest of the Malfoy holdings, still remains property of the Ministry, but Harry has Grimmauld and his own vaults. Between the two of you, you’ve got enough to do whatever you want for the rest of your lives.”
Harry scrutinizes every patch of revealed skin, his eyes raking over the taut planes of Draco's chest and torso, marveling in the pale alabaster of his skin. The Dark Mark stands out, but Harry's eyes glance right over it, choosing instead to focus on the long column of Draco's graceful neck. Trousers are unbuckled without ceremony, and they come off in a swish of fabric. He's not wearing anything underneath, and Harry is presented with Draco in all his glory. He watches as the trousers are shaken out and folded. Draco's movements are precise and methodical, and Harry thinks he could watch Draco like this for hours.
"No, he hasn't," she said, shaking her head. "He's been relaxed, affable. He smiles, he's sweet, funny and affectionate. Underneath all that ice and poise, he's a different man. Surely you've seen a glimpse of it?"
Hermione's eyes narrowed through the connection. "Did you really expect him to? I know things have been strained between you. He's not been acting the same."
"No, I'm not saying that, but listen; I grew up hating my aunt and uncle. Until I came to Hogwarts, I didn't really care about anyone. In those few years, I came to love so many people, and lost a lot of them, yes. I didn't have time to develop the kind of relationship that you had with your father. It would have been so much worse for me if I had. I don't love lightly, and I suspect neither do you. I can only imagine your heartbreak at losing him."
"But I can be," Potter finished. "And I have to trust you with my life. You should be able to trust me with yours."
Harry steps to the side and ushers Neville forward. "Here, come in. Narcissa, Draco, may I present Neville Longbottom."
He tasted of iron and darkness and of all things dangerous in this world. The kiss was little more than a mutual tasting of one another, and Potter licked through his mouth as if it would be last time. Draco’s cock surged against them, heavy and swollen with want. Potter pulled back and dropped to his knees, still keeping his fingers at their punishing rhythm.
Draco snorted and crossed his arms. “You’re a shit liar.”
The resulting shudder of magic comes off huffy and annoyed, and Harry thinks if a house had eyes to roll—
"No!"
"You may look at me." Draco's lashes flutter as his eyes find Harry's. "Unless otherwise directed, you always have my permission to look at me. In fact, I encourage it." He leans in. "I want you to see what you do to me. What effect you have on me."
Potter pulled him close and buried his nose in Draco's hair, inhaling deeply. "I'll take that under advisement," he said as his arms began to wind around Draco's waist. Draco patted him away with a huff.
Draco’s hands fell to his sides and he smoothed a hand over Potter’s chest. “So can you?”
Potter's tousled head appeared over the back, his grim expression making Snape's fingers curl into the upholstery until the fabric cut into the pads of his fingers.
Draco steps inside and finds his mother relaxing with a book and a cup of tea. She's in her dressing gown, hair soft around her shoulders, slippered feet tucked up beneath her in the overstuffed chair. He lets out a breath. It's rare she lets him see her like this, unfettered and real. This is the mother of his childhood, when it was all hushed endearments, soothing hugs, and soft smiles.
His jaw is clenched tight, biting down on his lip so hard Harry sees a tiny rivulet of crimson at the corner of his mouth. He's holding back, doing his best to ward off the impending orgasm, waiting for Harry's command. It's not something they discussed, and not something Harry expected. This is more of Draco wanting to be
Draco followed him up the stairs and into the first room just off the landing.
"So what is it you do nowadays?" Harry asks. "Draco hasn't mentioned."
"Yes, um, it's a Muggle device—"
"I don't deserve you," she whispers into the warmth of his chest. He pushes her back to smile at her, and it's all she can do to keep her knees from buckling.
The harsh crack of Apparition filled the still air as Harry appeared in the forest. The moon loomed overhead, round and full, casting beams of silvery light through the breaks in the treetops. The silence was oppressive; it seemed the nocturnal creatures knew there were better places to be at the moment. Harry closed his eyes. From off in the distance, he felt it creep closer, slipping under his skin like a sharp knife.
Renault winks at him and disappears from the Floo. Draco turns and begins to flip idly through the paperwork on his desk, pausing for brief seconds before continuing to read.
No. Wash first.
OOOOO
"That's what you do, isn't it, Potter? Push people away so they don't get hurt? Because you think that's what happens when you let people get close to you. They get hurt, or they die. And you can't save everyone."
Pansy smiles, warm and gracious, slipping from Draco's grasp to twine her arm with Hermione's. "Of course, Granger. I'm only too happy to discuss my work." She nods at them. "'Night, all. Owl me, Draco."
"It's not too late, Harry. This is your chance to return—"
Potter growled as he pounced, attacking Draco's mouth. His blood sang in a chorus of
Draco opened his eyes and lifted his head to face the vampire. He tilted his head in deference. “You’re right. That was uncalled for. I apologize.” He turned away from the irritation in Potter’s face to pick at a threadbare patch of sofa. “Anyway, I assumed you would be far ensconced in political derring-dos by now.” Draco placed a hand over his heart and affected an awe-struck demeanor. “The dashing Auror Harry Potter, Savior of the Wizarding World, on the fast track to great and important things at our paragon of justice,” he waggled his eyebrows and whispered in a hushed tone of reverence, “The Ministry.”
The faint blush that colored his pale skin darkens and creeps steadily outward, covering his cheeks, bleeding out to spread across his neck, shoulders, and chest. Draco moans softly under the touch of his own hand and the sound makes Harry's cock hard in his trousers. He's keeping to the steady pace demanded of him, but Harry can see his knuckles whiten as he tightens his grip, prolonging the sensation. Draco's cock grows redder, slick and purple at the head, and Harry's mouth waters. It's not a show, but it is. He's doing as he's told, but fuck if he doesn't know exactly how to keep Harry's attention.
He has to press, not because he's cruel, but because he has to be clear. Harry taps the handle over Draco's hole. "Is this a soft limit, or hard?"
Potter stopped short at Draco's shout, and he meant to close his mouth, he really did, but now emotion he once buried came into the light with all the force of a speeding train. It was careening past, full-steam, and headed for Potter's shell-shocked face. "I didn't do it for you, or the war effort, or anyone else! I did it for me, because I was weak and selfish!" Tears streamed unbidden down Draco's cheeks, and he had to double over and gasp for breath.
Hermione’s smile dropped from her face and the familiar mask of resigned disappointment settled across her features.
He presses harder until Draco's breath catches. "
"Isn't he with you?"
"Beautiful," Harry purrs, trailing a reverent finger down the middle of his back. "Just beautiful."
Draco's face is red, embarrassed, and Harry can tell he's on the edge of either bursting into tears or lunging at Harry to have a go. His head whips back to Harry and he challenges, "You tell me to come to you, and I do, and then you tell me to leave. You run hot and cold, and I swear, you're just like—"
"I've been known to keep odd hours myself. Maybe we'll run into each other in the wee hours of the morning?"
"Hello, Draco."
With that, he leaves the pub and heads out onto the street, and slips into his coat. He's only got one arm in before the sound of reporters barrels down on him. A crowd of them are at the end of block, running toward him, shouting.
"Why?" Harry asked, desperate for someone to give this any reason for him to cling to.
Malfoy still didn't say a word and a thought suddenly crossed Harry's mind for the first time, one that left him on the edge of an emotion he refused to feel over Malfoy. But he couldn't just say nothing. "You are coming back, aren't you?"
Harry hadn't realized they talked, though it seemed so obvious they would now he couldn't believe he hadn't thought of it before. "Do you talk a lot, you and Mafloy?"
"Tell me," Malfoy pressed when all Harry did was stand there, his grip tightening as a look so frightened came over his face that Harry couldn't help expecting the smell of damp bathroom tile for a moment, lost in every way.
Hermione just waved him off, a smiling coming over her face. "Oh you know what I mean. This year is going to be great, I can feel it."
Knowing he wouldn't understand either way let Harry pretend he felt less guilty for giving up on it so early in the year, but even his own guilt was hard to remember with Malfoy this close and only growing more distracting with each day that passed. In the six classes that they had shared since the start of the year Malfoy hadn't met his eyes once, and Harry felt like he was stuck on the slowest moving ride to madness.
Malfoy didn't answer, he just looked at Harry, visibly swallowing before his lips slowly parted. His hair still fell in that infuriatingly soft wave over his forehead, coming down to just touch his eyebrows. It felt like he would never get tired of looking at him.
Harry could tell just by the look on his face that Zabini thought he'd got him, that he'd won whatever this conversation had turned into. "Well, Malfoy is quite fit."
Neville shot him an odd look before shrugging and stepping past him, reading for a moment before he spoke. "You're with Ron, but Zabini is in there too."
"It's nothing," Harry said quickly, his eyes darting back across the platform, taking in the back of Malfoy's head, the shape of his shoulders beneath his robes, hair close to shining beneath the harsh lights above them. Doing everything to keep his breath even Harry stepped forward again. "I'll be right back," he said as he moved past them, ignoring Ron's question at his back as he went.
"Quite so what, good at potions? Shouldn't that be what matters?"
Face burning Harry simply nodded his head, watching Hermione elbow Ron in his side. Shooting a quick glare around them Hermione turned back to Harry, leaning closer against the table as she spoke. "Why did you go see Mafloy?" She asked quietly, though Harry suspected that more than anyone else she already knew, better than even he did most likely.
Harry nodded, pulling a smile onto his face when he realized it wasn't already there. This was good news, he loved rooming with Ron, he had the whole time he'd come to school. This was the best possible outcome really. Harry wasn't disappointed, truly, there wasn't any reason for him to be.
"Still," Harry pressed, ignoring the irrational urge inside of himself to reach out and touch. "We could study together, once we do."
Harry rolled his eyes, debating just getting up and leaving even though it was late enough now that there wouldn't be much of anything to do. Even sitting in the common room would be better than sitting here being watched by Zabini.
His class schedule didn't seem like such a daunting task anymore, compared to whatever it was that was happening to him now.
Without quite meaning to Harry zoned off again, knowing Hermione would fill him in on anything important that was being said. Keeping his head propped up on his hand facing the front Harry let his eyes wander to the Slytherin table, only to find Malfoy was finally in his line of sight and already looking back at him. Stunned all Harry could do was blink, noticing that Malfoy's hair still wasn't pushed back like it had been in all the years before. It was loose, falling in a soft wave across his forehead just like it had been over the summer. Another blink and Malfoy looked away, down at his plate and then back up to the front where Magonagall was still speaking.
"I talk to Malfoy," Harry said right away, like maybe if he told someone else it would actually make it be true, at least in the way he wanted.
Harry could only think about how much he liked it, though the thought origins or even the faintest understanding of it were lost to him.
"I like watching you," Harry said simply, grinning even wider at the flustered look that fell over Malfoy's face that he quickly tried to hide, turning his head as his eyes went down, lashes fanned out against pale skin strained in red. His hair looked even more pale than usual, almost glowing, like he was something close to other worldly. "You look good all the time."
Unable to stop himself Harry leaned in further still, close enough to see each one of his eyelashes again, to feel Malfoy's breath against him. Malfoy's mouth fell open just the smallest bit then, his tongue darting out across his bottom lip and Harry couldn't help but tighten his hold, tipping Malfoy's head back as his fingers moved to cradle his neck. "Tell me I can kiss you."
Malfoy's eyes went back to his work so Harry assumed Slughorn was done talking. It was almost laughable that was really what he considered teaching.
"What the fuck is that supposed to mean?" Malfoy snapped, still just standing there when he could have left so many times already.
Harry had only realized he was shaking when the witch next to him began openly staring, whispering to the woman next to her as they had both turned to watch him.
"I want to," Harry replied, knowing it was true for anything Malfoy could ask about them. All he did was want him anymore, constant and unavoidable.
Just a menace to his sanity.
"Nothing," Harry said slowly, biting back a laugh but not the smile he felt around his words. "I just know you, you've known my schedule every year we've come to school."
"No," Harry said quickly, running a hand through his hair as he tried to find the words. "But don't you think you should?"
Harry couldn't seem to do the same. He took in Malfoy's profile instead, noticing that somehow even from across the hall it looked startlingly different than it had in years past. He couldn't quite place what it was, and Harry couldn't bring himself to stop watching him, completely transfixed. Some part of him couldn't help wondering if he'd just never let himself look the way he wanted before, but it wasn't a thought he could do much with now. It wasn't like he could change the past, he knew that probably better than anyone.
"So full of yourself," Malfy mumbled as he turned in his arms, laying his hands against Harry's chest as he watched him with a raised eyebrow. "What makes you think I'll let you catch me again?"
"No," Harry said slowly, knowing that there was no way around it now. "I went to see him. A few weeks back."
Harry had never seen Malfoy like this, unkempt and something dangerously close to soft. It set off a feeling in his chest that Harry couldn't place, and even blurred and far off inside of him it still felt too big for Harry to have any desire to examine it any further than that.
Harry had never considered Malfoy might actually want to be kissed, that he might actually want to be kissed by him, that he could think about it with that kind of look on his face. Harry's hand was halfway up to reach out for Malfoy's face before he caught himself, smiling at the panicked look behind Malfoy's eyes.
Harry just shrugged. "Doesn't mean I won't do it anyway."
It suddenly seemed ridiculous that he still didn't know what Malfoy looked like shirtless, but Harry knew the face he made when he came.
"Stop looking at me like that," Malfoy finally said, reaching up a hand to fuss uselessly with his hair as he began to shift back like he would stand up.
Malfoy set down his quill, shifting in his seat to face Harry fully. His leg was close enough beneath the table that all Harry would have to do was shift the smallest bit and they'd be touching. "I never thought I'd hear you admit to being shit at something to me."
He just couldn't stop thinking about how completely and thoroughly uncomfortable Malfoy looked.
Harry didn't know what to do for a moment, a strange tingling emotion filling him up side as any words he tried to say died the moment he tried to make them take shape in his mouth.
"Just can't imagine who would want him here is all."
"So are you done avoiding me yet?" Harry finally asked, knowing he would truly go mad if he let them both leave without figuring this out, if even just the smallest bit. "Or am I gonna have to chase you around some more hallways before I can see you again?"
He was unable to stop the surprised noise that fell out of him, not expecting much considering who had made it. "It's good," Harry said after he swallowed, wondering why he'd thought coming over with no plan on what he would say had ever felt like a good idea.
Malfoy just rolled his eyes. "The other one."
Face burning Harry forced a shrug. "Seems like it."
Harry let himself breath for a moment before he spoke, the words suddenly the easiest thing in the world when Malfoy was looking back at him that way, the way he'd imagined for months but had never let himself believe he could have. "Ever since I saw you this summer, I haven't been able to stop thinking about it."
"You look so good," Harry said mindlessly, with hardly any air left in his lungs at all, hearing and feeling the shudder that went through Malfoy at his words. "God, I want you so bad."
"Brilliant," Harry said with a grin, already turning away to join Malfoy at his table in the back. "Thanks professor."
Malfoy shook his head, finally giving a half hearted tug of his hand. "You can't," he said quickly, visibly swallowing, eyes darting away and back to him again like he couldn't quite believe this was real, like if he looked away from Harry for too long he would disappear all together.
Turning Harry set the wand on the table, pausing a moment to look at it in his hands one last time. There was too much there to think of just one thing. "You know this wand saved my life, so it's a little like you–at least some people could see it that way."
"So is he single?" Harry finally asked when Zabini remained silent, nerves like fire under his skin. He wasn't sure what he would do if he found out he wasn't.
"We could," Harry said before he could stop himself, taking a step closer. "We could talk now."
"Why Potter," Zabini said slowly, turning in his chair to face him fully with a smirk firmly in place. "Beyond your minimal interactions with me I wasn't aware you talked to any Slytherins."
Malfoy shook ever so slightly under his hold for a moment, eyes widening as he moved to step back but Harry just tightened his grip, feeling as if he was on the edge of something he couldn't see but desperately wanted to reach. He knew if he let Mafloy run away now they never would.
"Ron?" Harry said around a laugh. "Haven't really talked about it."
But for once Malfoy didn't react the way he thought, by storming off or throwing a series of glares before walking away in a huff. He just blinked at Harry for a moment, his face slowly shifting to a soft pink as he eyes fell away from Harry's to look down, just the smallest bit.
He would have to thank Neville the next time he saw him. Maybe even get him a gift.
"Hello," Harry said dumbly, rocking back onto his heels and feeling every bit the fool Malfoy had always claimed he was. He had no idea why he'd let himself think any part of this was a good idea.
"No," Neville said simply. "Just saying is all."
His answer seemed to take Malfoy off guard, his expression somehow becoming even more closed off as he went on. "Well, here I am."
"Really?" Zabini asked slowly, dragging out the word. "Draco hasn't mentioned it to me."
Harry slowed to a normal walk when he reached the top, eyes instantly going to the window and the seemingly endless sky beyond. It was a testament to how tired he must have been that Harry didn't notice Malfoy strait off, sitting off in the corner against the wall already watching him. For maybe the first time he didn't look angry the moment their eyes met, Malfoy just kept looking at him in the silence with his painfully tired eyes.
After that Harry had hardly been able to look at anyone, eyes held resolutely forward as he walked past Malfoy on his way up to the stand when his name was called. Harry didn't look at him when he told the room that Mafloy had saved his life, that without his wand he never could have won, that he didn't think Malfoy deserved to be in Azkaban. He didn't even look over at the collective gasp those words caused, despite feeling Malloy's eyes on him like a physical thing, burning into the side of his face.
Malfoy bristled, voice rising as he went on. "Be however you want, just do it away from me."
Slughurn looked unsure. "If it's a strong partner you want, I can certainly suggest someone, perhaps someone not quite so..." he trailed off then, glancing around the room, and Harry found he couldn't keep the pleasant expression on his face anymore.
"What's it like," Harry began, breaking his eye away from across the great hall to look at Neville eating beside him, "rooming with Malfoy?"
Anger finally pressed against his chest and Harry brought up the hand not still holding Malfoy's wand to hold his wrist, just below where Malfoy was gripping his shirt. His voice came out too quiet, like they were suddenly two different people having a complete different conversation. "Is it really so hard to believe? I fought to keep you out of Azkaban, why would I do that if I didn't care what happens to you?"
"Are you secretly very boring Potter?" Zabini asked from his desk, his voice breaking across the silence so suddenly Harry jerked on the bed.
"Would you like tea?" Malfoy asked in an even tone, eyes stuck on some point over Harry's shoulder.
Harry finally tore his eyes from the other side of the hall to look at Ron, who looked like he knew exactly what Harry was doing and couldn't decide if he was amused or annoyed.
It was over. He was dead. It was over.
The one thing he did know, or at least was so blindingly obvious that even he couldn't deny it anymore was that he really didn't know how to stop watching Malfoy. He'd stayed true to his word and hardly spared Harry a second glance since they'd spoken in the classroom, and Harry hadn't had it in himself to press the issue quite yet. But twice a week in potions, the one class they still shared Harry couldn't help but indulge. He wasn't even sure why he'd taken the class again considering everything, but it was going about as well as it always had.
More than anything Harry wishes that he could ever learn to think before he spoke, feeling even his neck begin to burn as embarrassment flooded him. Quickly he turned, moving to walk past Malfoy and out of this house once and for all, wondering why he'd let himself believe anything good could happen in it. A hand grabbed his arm, pulling him to a stop and forcing him to turn. Malfoy was dangerously close, startling similar to how they'd stood just moments before but somehow completely different.
"Well no," Harry said quickly, glancing away for a moment as he rocked back on his heels. "I did come out here after you."
Zabini just blinked at him, like he couldn't have possibly heard Harry correctly. "Just so I have this right," he said slowly. "You are talking about Draco?"
Harry stepped over the bench and threw his bag over his shoulder, looking up to see Malfoy disappearing through the doors to the great hall. "Just not very hungry tonight, I'll meet up with you guys later."
Three weeks into the year and Harry had yet to decide if he regretted coming back to school or not. It had seemed like such an obvious choice at the time, to the point that it hadn't seemed like much of a choice at all, but now he wasn't quite so sure. He couldn't seem to remember how to focus in class, or sleep on something resembling a normal sleep schedule, or how to talk with people he had considered friends for years. Harry wasn't sure what was happening to him anymore.
