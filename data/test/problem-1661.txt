The worst part was not the pain, after all. The worst part was being there, naked in the dark, eyes closed in a state between a lucid dream and being awake, never sure how and when the monsters will strike. Saying those words, the ones they had him memorize, Grove and Rutgrass and the rest of them. He could still see their leers clearer than the bathroom tiles around him. Draco wished so hard to be able to forget, but He didn’t want that.
“I don’t know either,” Harry said honestly, squeezing him a little tighter. “I guess you just try and do what you can against Voldemort, you know? Make it worth something, somehow.” Draco nodded, but it was a very stiff nod. Harry sighed. “I’d understand if you take it back, Draco. If you decide that you don’t want to join me or whatever, what we spoke of back then. You don’t have to do it.”
Draco didn’t answer straightaway. He cleared his throat a couple of times. “This man, did he have a name?”
“Ron gave it to me, actually,” Potter’s smile stretched practically from wall to wall. “It’s a Chudley Cannons thing. You know how he is with his Quidditch.”
Three years he’d been working there, and still he didn’t know the first thing about the shop. How does one pay the bills that now accumulated on his desk? How was he supposed to calculate things like
“I know,” Potter chuckled, and his hand twitched like he was aching to place it on Draco, but he didn’t move. “I just want you to feel safe.”
It took some effort to convince himself Harry wasn’t doing it on purpose. Draco drew an unreasonably long breath. “I killed –“ and then he stopped, because force of habit was going to make him say something else, and it took a moment to train his tongue to this new and very real crime he’d committed. “I killed Him, Harry. I – wait, didn’t I?”
Now it was getting a little difficult to swallow. He took his hand off him immediately and shoved it in his lap. “Sorry,” he nearly whispered, and Malfoy gave a tiny shiver. “I didn’t mean to – “ but he really didn’t know how to finish this sentence, so he shut up instead.
Not just the appearance of Potter’s body changed, but his entire demeanor did too. He walked around in a way that seemed easy, like he was perfectly aware of his body and assured of its strength. Draco found he envied that as well. For so long his body wasn’t even his own, and to be so confident in one’s form felt as unachievable to him as riding a Cleansweep-360 to the sun.
“Sure,” Draco said, feeling like he should change the subject immediately. “Anyway, as a thank you, will you let me buy you some dinner? There’s an Indian across the street. To be honest I’ve never eaten there, but it always smells fantastic when I walk by. We’d just need to pop by the shop, though, because I don’t have any money on me right now.”
“I don’t understand,” he cried, big tears rolling down Harry’s shirt. “I don’t understand what’s happening, please, please…” Harry let him cry himself out, silent, steady. Everything was shaking inside him, and the thrumming was going to drive him up the wall, because what the hell was the bond doing to him, what was all this meant to be, what –
Harry still didn’t sound very interested, but he nodded. He sent a tiny look to Draco, as if to affirm he was still there, then brought his gaze back to Grove. That split second was enough to make Draco doubt everything in the world and then some; Harry looked fierce, he looked like the solid representation of fire. It was intimidating on a whole new level.
eaten? – Potter was adamant, and Draco had to give in. He didn’t have much experience arguing with men who were as sure of themselves as Potter, who had such steel resolve. Not that he was experienced with arguing, in general. Not anymore, not this version of him. Draco surrendered fast enough, and agreed that after they were done cleaning – emphasis on the
going on? He was by Potter’s side all the fricking time, very and constantly close, and it was so surreal that he couldn’t even freak out about it anymore. He sat by his bed and made pointless chit-chat. He helped Kreacher make his favorite meals (and some he really didn’t like, the elf was very inconsistent in the kitchen). He gave Potter his medicine and made sure he actually took it, the big baby. He laughed with him, for crying out loud.
“No,” Narcissa whispered at his side, so softly Harry wasn’t sure he actually heard her. Only then she repeated, louder, more desperately: “No!”
Now he was just perplexed. “Nothing out of the ordinary, Sir.” Draco was aching to ask why, but that would have been rude, and he was not going to make that mistake again.
“I was never my own, Harry. That’s why I can’t give you – that’s why I can’t love anyone else. I’d always be His. I’m sorry.”
The next morning they spotted Snape back in his dungeons, and Malfoy asked Harry to wait for him in Gryffindor while he goes to see him. “He still can’t know a thing,” he begged when Harry seemed reluctant. “He’s not going to do anything, anyway. I’m just going to ask for my wand, and he’d give it to me. It won’t take ten minutes.”
Draco wanted to say something, but he could think of nothing suitable. His father had been dead to him for many years now, so it shouldn’t make that much of a difference. This was just… no, he was too weak to lie, even to himself. This hurt.
“Will you quit giving me the puppy-dog eyes? I thought we agreed you weren’t one. I just don’t… I don’t understand. I thought – all this time I thought you really… why did you let me touch you?”
“But, Potter… it’s not going to be… I’m just going to tell you to come every night. You’d be sick of me.” The thought wasn’t just humiliating, it was crushing. Potter, who didn’t let go of his hand, squeezed.
“Yes, of course I do. Even in Hogwarts I knew you were brilliant, just… we weren’t ever on the same side. I always thought it was a shame. Well, I mean, later. Back then I just thought you were a prick.” Her smile was somewhat rueful, and Draco felt terrible, because it was his fault they weren’t on the same side then, and that Harry was now shooting daggers at her with his eyes.
“Yes. Going. Gone.” Now Potter stood on the other side of the door, and Draco was close to exploding. In a rapid motion that was more dumb luck than brains he sent his hand forward, landing on Potter’s jacket, right above his heart.
Potter kept coming by every single night. Perhaps it was because he really did understand Draco’s need for routine, or because he knew how tough it was for him to be alone, or maybe it was something else.
, it was all really happening. Potter really was there, with his bloody Potteriness that was so enchanting and frustrating simultaneously. His Potter. There were absolutely no words Draco could use to describe what it did to him. He could scoff in disbelief all he wanted, but the truth was there in the green eyes. It practically screamed at him every time Potter smiled.
He was beyond exhausted, and there was nothing about any of this that was right. His own head declared open war on him, and that bastard played dirty. Draco rapped long fingers against his temples, begging. Just stop it. Just stop.
“I know you wouldn’t want to,” Malfoy answered, and by the look on his face it seemed like it physically hurt him to speak the words. “I know you’re a fucking saint, Potter. But that’s still out there, acknowledge it or not. I don’t have the privilege to ignore it like you so conveniently do.”
“No, you can, you just don’t want to. Have I not been honest with you? Do I not deserve a modicum of truth?”
Potter nodded too. “All right then. If it’s okay by you. I guess we could try.” There was a long silence, and Draco thought he might actually throw up if none of them said something soon.
“Well, that’s just a lie. You spent many years of your life wanting nothing better than to hurt me. I guess you finally got your wish.”
“Well that might have been how it started, yes. But we all know this isn’t what’s happening now. He’s changed, Harry, and you know it. he really cares about you, that much is obvious. It might be, er, unfortunate he never said anything – “
The water was thick and heavy and a hysterical thought went through him that it wasn’t water at all – it was blood – he had to get away from there – he couldn’t get away – it was a snake, holding him down, a snake of red eyes - and he was doomed, he was doomed, he was doomed…
“Hermione found a way to change the tattoo,” he said then, presenting the folder to Harry. “The phoenix one, at least. I’m not sure if it would work on the Mark as well?”
Harry had to stop him there; he knew Draco would never have done anything like this. “No, Professor. I never meant for him to get harmed. Just a little frightened, is all.”
“Right.” There was something that needed to be said, and Draco didn’t know if he knew exactly what it was. “It was all just so new. I wasn’t accustomed to it. I needed to – needed time, I suppose. I didn’t mean to lie to you. I do live here alone, now.”
“Yes, all right. When you were attacked, and I – no, wait, before that, when I nearly died, when I tried to kill mys–“ Draco paused, raising a timid glance to the others all gathered around them. Morning sun bathed their tired faces, washed the red in their eyes and softened their frowns. “Right. We’ve not… discussed that part in detail yet, I don’t think.”
“What was the point?” Draco asked, and the words were like a knife through Harry’s heart. “I knew her days were numbered. Every day I’d wake up and ask myself, is this it? Is this the day I’d finally receive the news? And – knowing how much you hate me…” he shook his head, and Harry couldn’t swallow anymore, since his whole throat was on fire. “As soon as school is over I will be too, in any case. There is not much reason to do anything.”
“All what?” Harry still stared at his shoes like he hoped they would do the talking for him, but Draco was impatient with dread.
“Ah, but we both know that isn’t true. Tell me, girl, have you seen anyone else? Perhaps you brought someone along when you apparated?”
“I don’t know. I’m so out of my mind with worry, it’s hard to feel anything. It’s just so surreal, thinking that she'll be there tonight. And with him.” He swallowed nervously. “I guess I should be grateful it’s only him and not the Dark Lord that's coming to check up on me.” He lowered his glance to the fire, musing for a second, then back up to Harry. “Are you ready? Let’s go. Snape’s been meant to leave the front door open for us, and we shouldn’t meet anyone on our way.” nevertheless, Harry covered the them both in the cloak as they made their way downstairs quietly. It was really quite alarming, how natural it felt to be walking alone at night with Malfoy. Sure, he’s spent many nights under this cloak with Ron and Hermione, so walking in the deserted corridors wouldn’t have bothered him anyway. But to be able to do it so easily with Malfoy of all people… that was just peculiar. They walked quickly, and soon they got to the main door, which indeed was unlocked. Bracing himself, Harry pushed it slowly, and then they were out.
“He really does look sick,” Ron whispered as they walked past him and took their seats at the back of the class. Harry wasn’t sure if he was imagining it, or had Malfoy become slightly flushed when he saw him. All through the lesson he did his best not to look his way, for whenever he did, the fiery monster of rage went roaring inside him again, and Harry seriously began to wonder if he was losing it. It was a great relief to leave the stifling room as soon as class was over, and he was able to take a few free breaths on the way to Transfiguration class… only to find the blond already seated there.
“How about the huge red spot on the center of my face?” Draco spat, taking a step away from him. “Come on, your eyesight isn’t
Another spell flung him across the room straight to the wall, and Draco banged his head on it so hard he saw stars. Harry’s glasses, which he magicked for himself back at the Room of Requirement for this exact eventuality, fell and shattered on the floor. He blinked and stared at the blurry images of the people in front of him. When he thought he might have to take on Harry’s appearance, he hoped for something slightly better than this. Hope is for fools, though, like his father always said. Perhaps some things he taught him weren’t wrong after all. Perhaps he wasn’t just a thoroughly evil, no good bastard.
“His name was Grove,” he found himself saying without realizing he was going to do it. Harry’s face opened up to him in shock. “Alan, the man I killed. The guard who – his last name was Grove.” There was a long, heavy moment of silence between them.
The next couple of days were an absolute haze for him; he couldn’t remember a single thing he saw, did or said. By Monday he was vaguely returning to his senses, but still wasn’t ready for a face-to-face meeting. He spent the entire evening pacing the common room, drawing malicious satisfaction from the mental image of Malfoy waiting for him in vain in the Room of Requirement. Then as the week wore on he grew more and more malevolent, his need for revenge more and more prominent. He had to do something, and simply ignoring Draco's desperate looks wasn’t enough. He wanted to make him pay, wanted to make him hurt. Day by day he seemed more anguished, a thing which Harry, when glancing towards him from the corner of his eye, was satisfied to see. In the end of the week he felt strong enough to do it, and on Friday he sent him a message to meet at eight. He knew the Slytherin Quidditch team had practice that night, and that Draco will be torn between his obligation to go and seeing Harry after such a long and confusing time. Finally, as he expected, the need to see Harry won, and he arrived precisely on time.
– Draco put his fingers on some of the more dramatic wounds, pressing hard, mumbling hysterically all the while. There were a lot of ‘Potter, no’s and ‘Potter, please’s and ‘Potter, please,
“Same here,” he managed to say in the end, nearly choking on his words. The black eyes staring at him seemed like they were trying to drill right through his, but Harry was doubtful Snape could gather anything from his mind right now; Harry himself could not decipher a single one of his burning thoughts.
It was very simple, actually; he kills the dragon, saves the princess, lives happily ever after. Does some… knightly duties, who the hell knows. It was supposed to be
Draco’s heart threatened to choke him, and for a while he could not respond. Pansy. His Pansy. And she sounded so… the smile that worked his lips was equal parts bitter and sweet. “She’s just the same as she always was. Gods, I miss her.”
And what was worse, after this conversation his dreams started to get really bizarre. As if it wasn’t bad enough that he had to see the blond all day long, now he visited his dreams almost every night. And in some of them that Harry remembered in horror, he was… doing very weird things. Very, very weird. Occasionally without a shirt on.
“Why for? So you could continue lying to the both of us? You’d need to face it at some point. I’m not saying it has to be now, but – “
“You could have had,” Harry admitted softly, looking at his cringing hands in his lap. “If you really tried, Draco, you could have had me fooled.”
Boy, have I got news for you: we are getting to hear Draco's POV too! the poor thing deserves it, wouldn't you say? different perspectives are separated by asterisks. Hope this doesn't get too confusing, as this chapter and the next are a bit of a comedy of errors of sorts. Less heavy on the comedy part.
“Here, grab this. Ready to eat?” Potter passed over a plate and a handful of cutlery, and Draco returned to the table to set it. They sat down quietly, both avoiding each other's gaze.
Draco hadn’t been embarrassed in a long time. Truthfully, he sort of thought he never will be again. Those days of wide-eyed blushing, rosy cheeks and swarming humiliation were behind him, he believed. Once you know real shame, there's no more room for a thing as simple as embarrassment. He was immune.
His shoes made a squelchy sound as he ran, but there was nowhere to go; the water went on forever, he knew. There was no beginning and no end. But as he was thinking there was no escape, falling to his knees in the middle of the stream, the fog began to clear. What it revealed stole the very breath from him.
The answer was clear, but he hated it so much he felt sick. He took an obscene number of breaths before managing to open his mouth. “I’m coming with you, then.”
“You coward! Going after children instead of picking a fight with someone your own size!” Draco’s heart gave a palpable lurch. Potter wasn’t just bold, he was
“I don’t – it’s not a matter of want, Potter. It’s what I was raised to believe, raised to follow. And it’s not like I’ve got so much of a choice here.”
“I loathe him, sir. For so many years I’ve despised him, and time after time he beat me. But now I have the opportunity to have the upper hand, finally I can best him. And make him pay for what he did to my father… and the Dark Lord. I detest him, you can have no doubt of that. Only, if I’m completely honest, now I also pity him. He is such a belligerent fool, so trusting and naïve. You can rest assured that my feelings haven’t changed in the least.”
“Maybe, yes, but… there’s other things to consider here.” Her eyebrows were all the way up on her forehead. “He had his mother’s life on the line, Harry. Think about what you would have done if it was the case. And still, although he was aware of the risk, he changed his mind! He chose you!”
“Hell,” the devil rasped in his ear, sending goosebumps up and down and out of control all over Draco’s body. “You look –” he ran callous fingers from Draco’s ear down his jawline, down his throat, catching on his collarbone. Then down to Draco’s exposed midriff, soft over smooth skin, hot and baffling and overpowering. And still descending, further down… no. This was wrong. They had to stop, for both their sakes, for
“He’s not going to hurt me!” The incredulous snort was unnecessary, Draco already knew he misspoke. “I meant – He won’t kill me. Whatever it is He plans to do with me, it’s not… If you really wanted to help me, you would go to your captain and tell him about all of this. Then you’d come back with enough people who can actually cast and – and maybe, maybe then you’d have a chance. It’s not a guarantee, but maybe.” Of course, by then He and Draco would be far, far away, far enough so they’ll never find them. No one will get hurt because of him, never again. Not if he can help it.
“There haven’t been many new developments, no, but it doesn’t mean anything. For all we know, they could be getting ready for something big. And it’s just – they need me back in the department, Draco. I need to go back. I’ll be very careful, Cap won’t allow for anything else, but I have to do this.”
, the old cook, eager to recruit him to his unsavory gang – this just had to work. And it will, because he will make it so. If the Parisian authorities thought the measly security measures they’ve added were enough to deter him, they were sorely mistaken.
Potter’s condescension was infuriating. “You think you’re so fucking good – Harry Potter and the Incurable Desire to Help Everyone – even Saint Potter will get fed up at some point, and you know it just as well as I do!”
Harry chuckled, scratching his neck. “Yeah, I never would have guessed it. It’s still hard to believe, even though it’s happening right now.”
“You tried to perform the torture curse?” Malfoy asked. His head snapped back up to look at Harry. “When? And why?”
to go. It was as far from simple as possible, and to be perfectly frank, Harry had no idea how to feel right now. He just knew that whatever it was that did happen, he sure wasn’t disappointed. Harry followed him, curious, confused, free.
different outfits before settling on a black tuxedo, which was a raving exaggeration and truly uncalled for. He was painful enough for the eyes already, all muscular and broad and bright smiled as he was.
“It’s Harry Potter, sir!” the squeaky voice exclaimed, and Harry laughed as he untangled the little body from his own and got both of them on their feet.
Draco was almost tempted enough to look, but he didn’t think he could stomach it. “No, thanks. What kind of tattoo? And where?”
“You remember Pansy, Father. I did not bring her. Or at least, I did not know if she will come. Pansy is my girlfriend.”
There was more. He nearly petted a highland cow. He bought himself a coat without making a bloody mess of it, and wore pajamas that were soft enough to cry. He flew on a broom and kept his eyes open. He cooked with Harry every night and didn’t burn anything. He tasted Indian food, and Mexican, and Vietnamese and Thai and Italian, and he didn’t hate any of it. He made jokes and held conversations and was actually pleasant. He walked around the most beautiful loch in the clearest Scottish weather. He went to a pub and had a beer. And you know what? When he lived on his own and thought he was going to die, he
Potter looked stricken. “Draco, that’s – but that’s ridiculous. I’d never do anything like that. And of course my coming here isn’t conditioned on anything.”
“Yeah,” Potter rubbed his eyes, and suddenly he seemed so tired and small, Draco completely forgot to be cross with him. He was itching to comfort him somehow, but had no idea how. “Mad's about right. I’ve been thinking it over and over, but I can’t seem to make any sense of the whole thing. What’s the connection between it all? Macnair popping up, ex-Death-Eaters suddenly on the rise again, dead Muggles in London and all this talk about… it’s not… I’m sorry. I’m not meant to discuss it with any civilians. I don’t know why I told you all of that just now.”
“Okay,” he said finally. “And I’d have a lot of time to practice with him over break. Oh yeah, I didn’t tell you yet – I’m going to stay here for Christmas.”
Well, now he was looking up. He was still frightened, but he wasn’t here alone. Potter was sitting close enough for comfort, not too close to cause alarm, and he was confident and sure in a way Draco couldn’t even dream of being. And he promised him on Friday, hadn’t he? That he wasn’t going to let anything happen to him? As much as he didn’t believe it then – or now – it was still a sweet concept. For a few hours, Draco completely forgot about the man who came to the flat last night.
“I think you’re exhausted,” Draco offered gently. Potter really seemed it. Judging by the ruby in his eyes and the pallor of his features, he hadn’t slept a wink all night, maybe not the one before it either. “I think you need to take a break from it before it kills you.”
It took a good few moments before he dared to open his eyes. Still a little shaky he stayed at the wall, gradually coming back to his senses, regaining control over his limbs. This was bad. He couldn’t let it happen again, ever. Harry needed to be strong, he needed to be cool minded and collected. He can’t be flailing all over the place and shaking like a little baby. He pushed himself from the wall, overly disgusted with himself, thinking hard. Those cold, hard feelings inside him didn’t subside over the summer, they just grew worse. His fear, his hate, his anger. Most of the time he was so confused by their mixture that he was left completely lethargic. But now he was back at Hogwarts, and now was the time to take action. He would go to Professor Dumbledore first thing tomorrow morning and speak to him. He would demand the old man to teach him, to show him ways in which he could train to ultimately achieve his goal. It is absolutely unbelievable, he thought to himself for the hundredth time, that Dumbledore would give him the news that he would have to battle Voldemort, and then just
A wee bonus one-shot, inspired by Pluto - not a planet, but still forever in out hearts! All the fluff 💖
“Hey, come here,” Potter reacted to his expression, and Draco dutifully got up and settled himself next to Potter on his bed. “There’s a picture of her. Want to see? Wow, did she always have a tattoo?”
“It was too good anyway, having him for these two years. I never get to have something like that. Something so… comforting.” Harry’s eyesight became rather blurry, but he refused to admit the tears. “It’s just not for me.”
“Yeah, that’s actually a part of what I wanted to ask you. I can’t tell Cap because – erm, well, it’s because of the man who…
His breath hitched when the blond opened his mouth as if he was trying to swallow him whole. He wasn’t too far off, Harry suspected, or at least he would have if he were able to form a coherent thought. He was breathless and sweaty and dizzy. The miraculous, flexible tongue drove flaming arrows down his spine as it engulfed him, running over the head, up and down it. Every movement Malfoy’s mouth made sparked every nerve in his body, and his muscles were seizing up uncontrollably. He couldn’t fight as his hips fought to thrust forward into him, as his legs shot sideways. His hands fell down to the sofa, fingers grabbing the material like a lifeline. “Fuck, Malfoy,” he mumbled, unable to contain himself any longer, then he gave a loud moan, sinking lower on the couch, shivering. “Fuck!”
“No, never got the chance. They were gone as soon as they’d cast, so there was no reason to send someone to look for them.”
“No, Potter, what I mean is – have you ever seen a phoenix? Do you think anyone could tackle one to make a potion out of it? It’s ridiculous. Most of the ingredients for it are either extremely rare or legendary. The draught of the living dead is a real potion, though, but I wouldn’t really advise you to drink it. Even made by capable hands it’s still a big risk. You might never actually wake up again.”
“Who knows? He’s a werewolf. He likes to attack people. That’s how he gets his kicks.” He didn’t seem to want to discuss it any further, so Harry didn’t delve deeper.
“If he’d be helping me it would only be to ensure I appease the Dark Lord, Potter, and he wouldn't be doing it on my behalf. I assure you he values his own neck far better than he does mine.” Harry couldn’t help but tremble again.
The room had no windows, and it took Harry’s eyes a second to get used to the low light cast by a single candle. The first thing he could see was the silvery-blond hair of the boy standing in the middle of the room, cradling his arm. Harry could not discern his expression. There was a bed, neatly made, and a small desk adorned with golden candlesticks and eagle-feather quills. There was no Narcissa there, though. Harry noticed Draco was breathing rather harshly.
“You were forbidden to go to the infirmary, not to take care of yourself. Jesus, Malfoy, you can’t keep walking around with this. Just put some of it on, it will help at least a little.”
One thing that did concern Harry a little was Dumbledore's absence. The headmaster did not return to the castle at all during the holiday, and Harry couldn't stop wondering about it. Wherever he was, he was surely doing something to fight Voldemort - shouldn’t he tell Harry something about it, as he is going to have to fight him in the end? And what about Narcissa and the plan to get her out safely? He knew Dumbledore didn’t just forget about that, but was he actively doing something? It was impossible to know if he wasn’t here. Harry looked at the map every day for him and for Snape, but day after day there were both gone. On several opportunities, Harry asked himself if they are away together, wherever that may be. But he dismissed the theory pretty quickly every time; Snape is with Voldemort, Dumbledore is working against him. It didn’t really matter, anyway, as long as Dumbledore was on his side. Which he was. No question about it whatsoever.
, that He was inclined to… fucking hell, Draco knew He was a sadist, that He liked to see his pain, that He got off on it. Draco also knew He’s killed before – or, well, had suspected that, at least. Knew that He wasn’t averse to murder, if nothing else. But only when there was no other choice, when it was necessary, absolutely as a last resort. Not like this. Not just strolling around London murdering anyone who’s ever been in contact with him. Damn it, the ladies were customers, they were allowed! David, yes, that was a – a mistake on his part, a misjudgment, he was being careless. David might be his fault. Oh, gods, David was totally his fault. David died because Draco couldn’t obey a simple demand, couldn't keep his fucking shit together, because he was too stupid to see - but why did He have to kill Delilah? Draco balled his fists so tight it hurt. No rules were broken there, he didn’t do anything – why did He have to do that? To send Dementors to attack Daniel? To murder an entire party? Why did He do all of that? Draco knew he’s been living with someone dangerous, that he loved someone cruel, but he never believed He’s capable of this.
Dumbledore nodded. “I ran the necessary checks. This letter was written by Draco Malfoy’s hand, and it wasn’t induced by magic, meaning he wasn’t coerced into writing this. At least, not by a spell.” This remark didn’t really help Harry’s attempts at focusing.
Draco drew a deep breath. “I don’t really know how long he worked there before I was sentenced. He never said, and no one spoke about that. The only thing they said was how much he’d changed after the breakout.”
“No,” Grove said in the end, and Draco exhaled a sigh of relief. His mind was already fucked with to such an extent, he didn’t think he’d survive another earthquake. “No, they weren’t with him. They just – everything they did to Draco, they did it themselves. Out of boredom, or sadism, or just for pure fun. They did it themselves.”
“All right,” Potter consented, although it was clear he didn’t understand Draco’s refusal. They sipped their tea quietly for a while.
Draco’s stomach gave a frightening turn. He was very happy he couldn’t eat anything since yesterday. Oh gods, oh
“I’m sorry, Draco. I didn’t mean to – I never meant to make you beg. For anything. I know how much you hate it.” That was a bit of a comical remark to make, really, seeing how Draco practically lived on begging for years now. “But I meant what I promised you, though. I’m not going to leave you. I’m going to end this.”
“How would you know?” Draco hissed, hurt and bewildered and out of any other fucking option. “Your only relationship ever was a sham! You’ve never been in a grown-up, real one! You know nothing!” This was absolute madness, and the most dangerous thing he could conceive. Potter could
Draco stared at him for a moment. “You don’t have to do that,” he said plainly. Potter raised a casual shoulder.
Potter returned, looking severe and deeply displeased. “You didn’t get any groceries since I was here the last time. You didn’t have so much to begin with, but I see you haven’t touched anything that was here. Have you not been eating?”
“Do NOT say he was only acting in front of Snape. I know what I heard. He – he told him about us, about the fact we were…” the nausea in his stomach grew more and more intense. “he told him everything, when he’s going to meet me, what we’ve been doing. He was completely honest with him.”
“Yes, something fucking happened! I was a bloody fool to ever trust that son of a bitch. He made a total arse of me, and I can’t believe I let it happen.” He was seconds away from frothing at the mouth. Ron and Hermione exchanged another quick look.
“There is no other option!” Malfoy threw his hands in the air and took another step in his direction. “You are too bloody good for this, Potter, so you can’t understand. You can’t just optimistically hope that there’d be another solution. There is only do or die. That’s the way the Dark Lord works.”
"Well fuck, aren't you a sight, Draco" Harry grins, reaching forward to run a hand through his curls as he marveled at the boy in front of him “I have to admit, gorgeous, never expected to see you again, least of all here. No complaints though”
The words still ring in his ears, and the man couldn't help but to laugh dryly at the irony of the entire situation. It was almost his husbands birthday, and he was supposed to arrive home weeks ago, with plenty of time to celebrate
home. The looks he got when they thought the couldn't see, the pity and the sorrow, he knew most of them had long given up hope.
Muggle headlines would be cold and callous, all they knew him as was an asshole in their defence, and all that reporters and investigators could find out from his life before fame was that he was a sheltered boy adopted by doting family, sent to a boarding school so elite it couldn’t even be named.
He knew his husband though, and he could feel deep inside him, down to his very core, that he was somewhere out here, and he wouldn't leave until he brought him home.
He just wanted his family to have one moment of normality, one moment of peace and calm, was that really too much to ask? After everything they'd gone through to get here?
Trust his husband to want to travel the muggle way. If he had just portkeyed like suggested, or even travelled a more conventional muggle way, like flying, he would be home safe.
The room blurred in and out of focus for a while as he concentrated the best he could on keeping himself upright without the support of the bricks, the hundreds of dancing party-goers blurring into a mass of long slicked back hair, short skirts and promiscuous girls. He stumbled over to one of the many sofas, throwing himself onto the corner seat beside the unconscious body of some half-familiar punk singer, grabbing the half empty bottle of vodka that was still clutched in his fist.
Shortly coming to the realisation that his efforts weren't helping, he tried a different approach and began fidgeting with two of the many rings adorning his slender fingers; the two delicate, diamond encrusted bands on his
"Hey Haz, how you doing tonight man" he grinned, patting his back and offering him a hit of the blunt which was hanging loosely between his lips, to which Harry shook his head.
The tears are falling freely, he realises, as he takes in his husband, and suddenly he can't breathe, can't think, can't do anything except stumble toward and pull the asshole down into
Maybe it would be one of the rare occasions when he said yes to a few lines of cocaine, or a blunt with fuck knows what in.  It didn't really matter to him how it happened, he just wondered how and when. He could picture it already, his pale lifeless body found among the mess of sprinkles of cocaine, dirty needles and empty bottles in the clean up that always followed the morning after one of these goddamn parties.
He hears a rustling nearby, and he grips his wand ready, a stupify falling from his lips as the werewolf-looking creature lunged towards him.
He carelessly threw back the last of the bottle, swallowing the colorless liquid without so much as a grimace, sighing in content when he felt the familiar burn. He let his mind wander, absentmindedly contemplating the future.
His once short hair was now much longer, the sides curling below his ears, at least three inches longer than he usually preferred, though he had been so busy lately he hadn't had chance to get it cut. He couldn't find it in him
On the other side of the boat, their friends were scattered, each looking rather similar to himself.
The room was steadily growing full though, far too full for Harry’s liking. There were hundreds of people crammed into the living room alone, not to mention the several other rooms in the penthouse. The music was loud, but the talking was louder, which led to the dj cranking up the volume a few more notches or connecting a few more speakers at least every half hour.
For a second Draco forgot all about the terrible, terrible thoughts tearing his head apart, all about potions and elixirs and Horcruxes. “What?”
“Only go to Dumbledore,” Hermione said, relieved. “Harry, he’s the only one who can help him. You know that.”
The first thought Harry had of the drawing room was how cold it was. A freezing wind blew from the open window, making him shiver slightly, sandwiched though he was between Ron and Hermione. The second was the sheer size of the room; it was almost as large as the entrance hall in Hogwarts. The sizeable brick fireplace was surrounded by many battered-looking sofas that have clearly seen better days. The bare stone walls stood very grim with some tapestries dotted about, so old they were entirely colorless. The whole place gave Harry a weird feeling of old, elemental magic. He wished the fireplace was lit, for it was really very cold in there. Through the open window he could see the sea in the dying light.
Today of all days, when Draco was so desperate for interaction – nay, for a distraction – the shop was empty. Only about two customers came in a stretch of eight hours, and he was getting restless. He knew what expected him at the end of the day; a cold, empty flat, and the sole company of his thoughts. He kept looking at the door and hoping for someone to come in, but it didn’t happen. Even his pansy in the vase looked a little sad. Flowers need to be loved, wasn’t that the wretched company line? He couldn't give it what it needs. He could never give anyone what they needed. “Poor flower,” he said, but really what he meant was
Draco wondered how he’s supposed to feel about that. Everything seemed very far away from him. It’s not like he really expected to be
, Draco thinks, pulling his mother tight to his side as the faces start to turn. Two Malfoys, striding up the path to the manor, backs perpendicular to fields of green.
Because death was a direct flight, wasn’t it? A one-way ticket. Harry should not have come back. His body was whole. It worked in all the ways bodies were supposed to. But on the inside…
“I am not! I’m not. I’m…” Harry spins, and his shoulder takes out an entire pile of paperback mysteries. “I’m not?”
Draco has a wand in this universe, a difference that shouldn’t feel substantial, but is. Back in Draco’s world, Harry had never returned his wand. At his trial, Draco was sure that he would, would stick out his hand and present Draco with the one piece of magic that had chosen him.
Something crackles under his skin as he steps up onto the bridge—something like destiny, although Draco has no idea what it means. The traffic rumbles beneath them and Draco can’t help his shudder as he thinks about the metal monsters flying through the night, separated from him by a piece of concrete and a Muggle engineering.
Harry thumbs at his keyboard, blinking furiously as the numbers swim in and out of focus. “I hate texting,” Harry says and the automatic doors slide open in answer.
Everything about Malfoy is so tangled, Harry can’t figure out where he stands. Malfoy was a bully and a coward, and then he was a victim and that would have been confusing enough, but now Draco was grown up and working with Muggles and so fucking fit Harry thinks he might die.
There are a thousand words crowding in Draco’s throat, countless replies and yet they all feel inadequate. So Draco says nothing. He hopes the silence is a gift rather than a cruelty.
There was nothing for it. Harry pours the memory into his pensieve. “I guess we’ll start at the beginning,” he says to Bella and tips into a world made of ice and stars.
Harry’s hands moved to his shoulders. A firm grip turned him, forced him to look straight into the sun.
Harry had wanted this, he reminds himself. The busyness, the rush of bodies, the urgent need to help.
Waiting felt pointless and a bit pathetic. Malfoy had left and there was nothing Harry could do to make him stay.
But then Draco is panicking and the truck is stopping, Draco is fleeing and Harry following him outside.
“Mate, I never thought I’d have to say this to anyone who wasn’t Mione. But you can’t go out for food and come back with books.”
For the first time in years, Harry calls in. He expects a stern lecture about the importance of dependability and taking his training seriously, but Dr. Horwood gives the auditory equivalent of a shrug on the phone and wishes him a speedy recovery.
For nearly five minutes, Harry hunts for his pants in the dark. It would be undignified to wander around Draco’s flat in the nude. Harry’s sure of it.
The bag of vomit drops to the floor as Mike collapses, limp and vacant. The heart monitor starts to scream and Harry feels his world shift. “Okay, everyone away from the bed!” he says, loud. Rita’s hand stills and falls away.
Something like fear twists in Harry’s gut then. “There’re coffee places open. He’s just gone out for a sec. That’s all.”
The middle of the battle is wherever Harry Potter is standing, drawing fire, impossible to ignore, moving slowly towards the black cloaks scurrying in the streets of Diagon. Draco stays put, his chest flat against the street. In this universe, Draco knows he’s no Auror. He also knows that he’s somewhere in his 20s and that, if the Death Eaters in the streets are any indication, the war that Harry Potter ended when he killed the Dark Lord at the Battle of Hogwarts is not over here.
“You couldn’t have fixed my hair too?” Harry says, running his hands through the forest of jet black. A navy long-sleeve clings to Harry’s biceps—everything Malfoy had put on him was a size smaller than he normally wore—and he feels a bit exposed.
“Here,” Draco says, handing Harry a scrap of paper and the exquisite fountain pen. “You can keep it.” Harry can see the red creeping up the back of his neck.
“I think you might be projecting your war trauma onto this sweet little thing,” Hermione said as Bella licked the tips of her fingers.
Pansy treads into no man’s land on her toes and sets the shopping down on their kitchen table. “Did the date really go that bad?”
“Stop laughing at me this instant,” says Draco and Harry is howling into his arms. “Harry, I swear to god, I will peel your fingernails off.”
Harry looked down at the pieces of the magazine cover on his floor. Malfoy stared back, sharp grey eyes narrowed at the photographer, blonde hair falling into his face. “This can’t happen, ‘Mione.”
“Megan,” Harry guesses, although he’s not really sure which nurse followed him in. “I need you to hook up the monitors. Heart rate, EKG, blood pressure—”
What he wasn’t enjoying was the enormous cash register as it leered at him from its spot on the countertop, refusing to open. “You will not defeat me,” Draco says, sneering back at the mass of metal. “You are an inanimate object and I am a wizard.”
Exhaustion wraps around Harry like a lover. It knows him, stays with him after the sixteen-hour overnight, holds him close as he does his rounds and scratches away at his documentation. The light filtering through the curtains of Grimmauld is bleary and overcast. Harry narrows his eyes at the sharp lines of his digital alarm clock. 3:13pm. Great. He’s woken up before his alarm.
The curse hadn’t touched him the night he cast it. There was a lingering feeling, like fingers on the back of his neck, that made him sure he’d produced
Harry kept stealing glances, flashing over when he thought Draco was dozing or staring out the window. He’d lingered.
he thinks as Harry moves, hips swaying easy, casual, without urgency. As if he could drive Draco’s pleasure to the brink and just hold him there, dangling over oblivion without a wand, without a broom, with just the promise in Harry’s eyes as he looks down at him.
The story has him, and Harry sees the stars blink down, sees the sky show its true face, sees himself lean across the cab and tie a question mark into knots with his tongue.
“No. You’ve made yourself abundantly clear.” They hadn’t made it further into the house. It makes for an expedient departure.
“No!” Harry know just how messy it is to bleed; the body is just a walking juice box. The punctures spurt and pool, and the stone steps are quickly painted red.
“Regardless! Nearing the end of the play, Hamlet finds himself in a graveyard. Surrounded by,” Robertson lowers his voice ominously, “bodies.”
“Are you ready?” Harry asks, reaching for the hand on his hip, weaving their fingers together. The gesture is so tactile, so effortless, that it leaves a sting behind Draco’s eyes.
“You idiots. You fucking idiots,” Pansy says, and she rounds on him fully then. Black circles, smudged eyeliner, panic cast in brown irises and Harry can’t look away. “Listen to what I’m telling you. Draco is cursed.”
“That’s right.” Pansy’s picking at the varnish on one of her nails. It’s bubble gum pink. “We’ve been dealing with it for years. He’s fine, usually.”
There’s a light at the top of the stairs, and footsteps sound a gentle alarm in the silence. Someone is coming.
Five years. Malfoy abandoned the magical world for five years. Harry remembers the look on his face, day in St. Mungo’s; sadness bed from his pores when he said, “I’m leaving, Potter, and I’m never coming back.”
“He must’ve gotten dragged into another universe,” Pansy says, the words still floating. “Fuck. He’s never been gone this long. Never.”
“No!” Ron appears to notice the subtle flex in the man’s biceps and takes a step out of his personal space. “Not at all. I was just wondering about those little squares you’ve got there—”
“It’s not?” Draco snaps, slipping his bleeding finger into his mouth. “Please. Enlighten me. Rehabilitate my horrible notions of appropriate cash register etiquette.”
“Ron!” Hermione punches his shoulder and hot mint tea spills over the rim. “Is your first question really going to be about sex?”
The whole dream disaster had started around the day of Malfoy’s trial. Harry’d half-suspected Malfoy cast a spell on him, but there’d not been time and there were far too many witnesses. Someone would’ve seen.
“Harry.” Hermione’s voice clatters, soft ice cubes in a glass. “You don’t have to rationalize what—who you want. You can have it. You can just have it.”
Malfoy could do whatever he pleased, whether that involved Harry or not. Whether it involved kissing Harry, or not, on a balcony, with the taste of smoke and lemon lingering on his lips.
the curse says, but she’s on the periphery now, a footnote in the story that Draco is about to live, that he desperately wants to know.
Hospitals, Harry thinks, cannot sit still. One would assume that, at some point in time, in some tiny square of space, the hospital would settle and the shuddering gasps of trauma and healing would even out. Find stasis.
“I know it’s not your typical night club,” Draco says, very pleased with all the Muggle lingo he’s picked up. In the early days after the war, he and Pansy decided that the Muggle world was—a bit ironically—more welcoming to former death eaters than the wizarding one. “But they’re open until midnight, you don’t have to yell directly into my ear to have a conversation, they serve liquor, and we’re the most attractive people in the place.” Draco looks around. “By quite the margin.”
There is a brief mention of a universe in which Draco is a burlesque dancer. This is a shameless nod to
“Indeed,” Draco says and Harry throws all caution to the wind. His hands feel heavy, like they belong to someone else, but he reaches over and places one on Draco’s knee.
Harry wanted to write it off as a fucked up fantasy gone wrong—would’ve done, if that was all that it had been. Except that the dreams weren’t just sex. Not by a long shot.
Draco’s tucked into a couch cushion, and Harry sits on the other end. There’s a cup of something waiting for him. The steam fogs his glasses.
Mr. Trembelt-pitbull lets out a colossal snort and snatches the script from Harry’s fingers. “Fine. But when I’m not better in a week, I’ll be back!” and storms out with about as much grace as can be expected from bullish dogs or bullish men.
“No!” Draco shouts into his sheets. “Not yet,” but the curse does not negotiate and so Draco knows he’s home. Egyptian cotton, soft and tangled up in his feet, confirms it.
“People die all the time,” is all Harry can say when his chest loosens. “I don’t know why I’m like this.”
“You’re not peeing,” Harry said, and his boots crunched against the snow as he approached. Draco hadn’t known that snow could crunch.
“Proximity to the source of the spell may improve the strength of the summoning charm,” Hermione says. “He’s been gone a long time Harry. He might not be able to—I can’t promise that it will work.”
“Right.” Draco extends his arm and Narcissa—finally revealing how nervous she must be—takes it. “Let’s go.”
“Go away,” is all Harry says after a long silence. The line of his shoulders is so straight, so tight.
“I see. Well, make fast work of those.” Malfoy points a long finger at the mess of files cluttering Harry’s space. “And we can go to Emma’s house party.”
King’s Cross blinks at him, the white halls a place where he’d thought he’d left a part of himself behind. “I think so.”
“I didn’t picture your flat like this,” Harry says, spotting a few scruffy plants sprawling across the windowsill. A leafy fern cascades over an elaborate sound system.
But most of Harry’s mind isn’t thinking at all. His thoughts are blank, a pure white haze, like tinnitus after an explosion. The aftershocks curl, ashes falling from the sky, and Harry just stands until his toes feel like ice cubes, eyes drifting in and out of focus.
“I found myself very low one night,” Draco says, so soft that Harry is shifting closer to him, breaching the middle cushion.  “And I made some rather…erratic choices.”
“Mr. Potter?” the man with the gavel says, and he sounds surprised. Which is when Draco hears the footsteps. Not heading up into the gallery but down. Down into the pit, soft against the cement floor. Settling next to his chair. Draco can see a set of trainers—there’s a tiny hole where the left toe pokes out.
Potter closes the distance so fast that Draco doesn’t have time to move away. At first, he’s sure that Potter’s going to hit him and he welcomes the contact. But the blow doesn’t come, and Draco feels Potter place his hand on his elbow.
All Harry’s ever wanted was to fix things. The breeze filters through the sheer white drapes; Harry can smell lemons in the air. He feels lighter.
“No,” Hermione said, her words long and thoughtful. “He’s not. Harry, I think you may need to make a statement.”
Except there is no Harry Potter trailing behind him. “Not in this universe,” Draco slurs, eyes still closed, chin still tipped to the big black sky. “There’s no one coming for me.”
Harry hadn’t been able to explain it, not even to himself. When Ron would give him that funny look or Hermione would pat him on the shoulder and sigh, Harry would remind them that Malfoy was a missing person—Harry had made sure of it, reporting Malfoy’s absence to the Ministry himself, although the Aurours never did much about it. “He could have been murdered!” Harry would insist and Ron and Hermione would exchange a look—the same look, every time—and would let the matter drop.
Five years after the war, Harry is a healer, doing his final residency at a Muggle hospital. For five years, Draco Malfoy has been officially missing. Until one night in A&E...
Words won’t calm him, and Pansy seems to know better. One hand, nails dipped in Muggle culture that she would have spat on a few months ago, reaches for him, grabs hold, and drags him back from the ledge.
Draco goes missing, Harry goes a bit mad, and breaking and entering really isn’t all that bad—not when it’s done in the public interest. Right? (No Harry. Just no.)
Draco is in the Mystery corner of the store, drowning in a bottomless mass of paperbacks. He’s committed to forcing some order to the magic of Robertson’s collection—today, by a resolute effort to alphabetize.
The reality, that Harry is in Draco’s space—that he is going to leave this room and find Draco in joggers with his hair mussed and loose around his face—finally hits Harry as he turns the shower on scald. The knob is simple, the tile white and clean, and it’s all Draco’s. Draco stands in this shower, naked, and washes off the day, and Harry’s in his space.
“You could do a lot of good, you know,” Hermione would say and Harry would glare and the conversation would stop before it started.
“Abnormal heart rhythm. Is everyone off the stretcher?” Harry’s eyes swallow the room, sees the bed clear. “I’m going to deliver a shock. One hundred and twenty joules.”
“Oh,” Harry muttered, slapping his forehead and making Draco jump. “I’m so sorry, I didn’t think – Narcissa, will it be possible to charm the bed into two singles? Maybe Draco and I could sleep here together. In our own separate beds, of course.” He sneaked a look at Draco’s face, and the yowl that constantly lingered on the tip of his tongue was never closer to escaping. “I mean, if you’d like that, Draco. I remember… back in my bedroom. If it’d be better, we can share. Could be fun.”
It couldn’t have been further away from the truth, but Potter’s tone did have its effects on Draco, who could only nod. “Okay.” Then, because Potter’s bloody smile made his blood hot and his head reckless, he added, “And I will, by the way.”
He caught himself right before it was too late. Great, he scolded but with very little conviction, this was bloody great. He can’t stop thinking about it for one rotten second. He was driving his own self mental and no one was there to save him. He could get out of Azkaban, and apparently he could get away from Him too, but Draco would never, ever be able to escape himself.
Draco shook his head, looking up at him with all the seriousness and verity he had. “Harry, I am yours. I always will be. Whether you'll have me or not, even if you hate me forever. I'm yours.”
“You know, social events. Dates in public places. It was all complicated enough before, but thinking that Ginny will have to see the pictures splashed all over the Daily Prophet – so I kept it as low key as I could. Hell, the last year I was probably only on about two dates. They were both the most stressful evenings of my life. And that's taking into account the time I faced a ten-feet tall Acromantula way deep in the Forbidden Forest.”
“No, come on. You didn’t do anything wrong, okay? I was a total arse, leaving like that, and then not explaining myself when I really should have. I’m sorry.” He spoke as sincerely as he could, because Malfoy looked like an absolute wreck. He was shaking a little and covering his face, his hair bouncing up and down. “Malfoy, I’m really sorry.”
“Have you tried to do anything in the past – is it six weeks already since your discharge?” her tone was very casual, but Draco wasn’t fooled.
Harry nodded, and there was something warm and sticky in his throat that was rather distracting. Harry wondered if that was something that he could focus on. “Okay, let’s do it again.” He tried to breathe in and out forcefully, so that it occupies his mind more. He heard Malfoy take a deep breath too.
“You’re early,” he said without thinking. The blond was sitting on the sofa Harry would usually take, although on the other side of it. A little hesitantly, and purely because he didn’t want to seem like he was afraid to, he walked past him and took his usual seat.
“Draco. Draco! Listen to me. You have to get up. I’m going to lift you, all right? We have to get back in the room before someone – “
“No, that’s not really either of their styles. Greyback’s more of a rip-you-from-limb-to-limb kind of guy, and the Dark Lord doesn’t need anything but the Cruciatus curse.” The cold, casual tone wasn’t working on Harry.
Lucius swallowed heavily. “I was merely trying to teach you, son. Perhaps my methods were not conventional – “
“Yes, Draco. He will arrive very shortly. In the meantime, why don’t you handle your classmates? Tie them and round them up in the corner. Soon enough I expect the Polyjuice potion will wear off and we could easily identify them. Then when He comes along, you shall receive an honor beyond your dreams.”
to dress me in?” Draco asked, incredulous. As if they didn’t have far more pressing matters to think about? Harry was wasting his time playing dress-up?
She laughed and put a hand on his arm. ”It’s okay to be confused. You don’t have to have all the answers now. For crying out loud, you’re sixteen! You just need to try and see what feels good. What did it feel like when you kissed him?”
“The human guards were enough on their own, I assure you. Dementors may be terrible creatures, their very core is dark magic, but… I often thought I would have liked them better.”
“I have,” she said softly and kissed his forehead. “I’m sure he’s very proud of you, Draco. He kept saying so, right up to when he lost his memory in that terrible accident.”
“Kreacher, bring – potions kit?” Potter’s eyes rolled to the back of his head, which then proceeded to fall unceremoniously to the carpet. For a second the house-elf just stood there and stared at Draco instead.
Potter shrugged carelessly. “He could be having an episode or something, reliving a moment from his past. Or maybe he just went plain mad. Happens to people who knew Voldemort quite often, I noticed.”
He was never in his life this close to physically hitting someone, not even the old tosser with the lilacs. Well, at least never in this life, the
“I gave up,” Draco mumbled, his cheeks burning. “Gave in. That day was when I truly surrendered to Him. If before it there was the slightest chance I might… there wasn’t afterwards. It was the reason everything – I was the one who let Him do this to me. To everyone. If only I wasn’t so weak, so blind, so – “
said something too quiet for him to hear, but the men around him roared with laughter. “Speak up, boy,” their master chided, and Potter was forced up to his knees by a spell. “What was it that you said?”
“Think? About what?” Harry realized he was digging where he’s not meant to only after the words left his lips. “Okay, listen, whatever you want. I’m here, all right? Why don’t we take a break, rest for a little?”
“Remind me again why I agreed to sleep here? You people honestly do not know how to regulate the temperature in your dorms. It’s too bloody hot in here.”
All right, easy now, breathe. In and out, just like you’ve practiced a million times. It’s not so difficult, not everything always had to be difficult.
The words were meant to appease him, but they made him angry for some reason. “I know I’m not a damn phoenix. I’m just saying that – look, I’d been punished, right? The worst part is over. It’s going to be – “ he couldn’t finish the sentence, and thankfully Harry didn’t make him. Instead he sucked in his lip and looked pensive.
“Yes, well, I didn’t know they existed, did I? I never even knew I was a wizard until my eleventh birthday. Up until then I was all alone. I couldn’t remember anything about my parents, but it didn’t mean I didn’t have nightmares. Green light, screams… I just didn’t know what it meant. Used to wake up crying in my cupboard and there was no one there to talk to. No one to… no one.”
“My what?” Potter nearly gagged with surprise. He put down his glass and stared at Draco, mouth open.
“Okay, so let’s say we’re both sorry. It’s just – so terrible. So, so terrible. Thinking they did this to you, that you’d had to go through it… I can’t…” he shook his head, and Draco wished there was something he could do for him, because Potter’s pain was in some ways harder to take than his own. Especially when he was the one causing it.
At first, Harry was very keen – that is, at least, until he understood Draco wanted to go alone. At that point he paled considerably, and if Draco wasn’t very much mistaken, he was about to veto the whole thing until Narcissa swiftly kicked him in the shin.
“Nothing,” Draco mumbled, letting him in and accepting from his hands a bag of food. “It’s just that I… I can’t really believe it.”
“Such a big boy, making all these threats.” She was too close now, far too close. Harry knew he had to do something, he only wished he knew what. “You should really watch your mouth, Potter. Your sweet Draco is waiting, and I’m sure you won’t want to – “
Harry laughed. “Would that make a difference? I already broke so many promises. I know you don’t trust me.”
“But what if he can’t get your mother out?” Harry asked, miserable. He never wanted to bring this subject up, never wanted to make him say it, but there was no choice now.
“Sleep, Draco. That potion is probably heavy on your system – sleep. I’ll be here when you wake up. I’ll be here.” Which was a pretty funny thing for a dream character to say, but hey, Draco could always appreciate irony. He floated weightlessly for some time, until he simply couldn’t anymore – the level of pain in his body decreased somewhat, and the change was dramatic enough to wake him. There was no doubt he was awake now; he could hear the Muggle refrigerator buzzing in the kitchen, feel the cold air all around him. He shivered where he lay, so broken but – but less so? He didn’t really know what was going on. It was far too early for Him to start healing him. The last time Draco gave Him cheek he was punished for a month straight, and that was for asking a truly innocent question. Of course, he had no way of knowing how long it’s been, but he’s surely not yet reached the quota of required pain to atone for his nerve. Still, there was no denying he was feeling slightly (oh, so slightly, so pitifully slightly) better. It was as if the healing potion he took in the dream worked on his corporeal self, as well.
When Harry spoke Draco jumped, since he completely forgot he was there too. “All right, then. Take the potion. I’m afraid it’s all I have left – I only had it by chance, I think. Probably Hermione shoved it in my work bag or something.”
. For Draco knew without a doubt that without His protection, he'd be lost. The men will take him, or he will find his way back to Azkaban. Draco needed Him for many things, but this was the most paramount: His protection was the only thing keeping Draco alive. He didn’t treasure it as much as he relied on it, and now… two weeks and counting on his own…
Potter’s anger crumbled into something much harder to bear, a jagged sort of vulnerability. “I didn’t do anything for him. Back then, when I could, I didn’t ask Dumbledore, I didn’t try to fight for him. And then I went and got him killed, and I… I never even got to say sorry. I never got to say how much he meant to me.”
Then he opened the door, and for a second the world stopped making sense, because whatever it was he thought he’d see in the hall,
Draco smiled, that odd little slant of his lips Harry found so mesmerizing. “A friend of mine is fond of them. Remind me what they’re for again?”
There was only a split second to make a decision, to choose a path. Draco thought harder than he ever did in his life, images flashing before his eyes, pathways and possibilities calculated instantaneously. Everything he’s ever dreamed of… scorn and mistrust on Harry’s side. His father’s pride and love… the look of sheer hatred in Harry’s eyes. What could he do? What was the only thing he could do?
“You hate him, don’t you?” Bellatrix snarled. “Your little boyfriend. Can’t even think of him without being physically sick. He did use you rather harshly, I heard.”
“Please, just – just give me a minute, all right? Draco, I care about you so much. I’m afraid because – I feel like if I made the wrong move now I’ll just ruin everything, and I… I don’t want to do that. Please, say you understand.” The words both drilled into his heart and filled it with warmth somehow, inexplicably, unbelievably. It didn’t make any kind of sense to him.
. No matter what he tried, the automatic voice kept yelling at him, something to do with unexpected items in the bagging area. He had no idea what the fuck that could possibly mean. What was so unexpected about a loaf of bread? He tried everything – to be nice to the machine, to plead, at some point he even yelled, but there was no appeasing it. In the end a middle-aged Muggle lady took pity on him and literally scanned each and every item for him herself. She was very sweet, and indeed quite helpful, but Draco couldn't even look her in the eye. He failed, he failed so hard. There was a reason He never sent Draco to the store after all – it was because he simply could not do it. Thank Merlin he’d found those two fifty pound notes on the table earlier, for otherwise he could never even afford any of it. He did wonder a little where they had come from, but one doesn't look a gift horse in the mouth, so he just shrugged and took them. It was very fortunate, since even with that he was struggling, and the nice Muggle had actually given him some of her own money to finalize the purchase. He thanked her with real tears in his eyes and fled before anyone could say a thing more to him.
“But…” he honestly, truly did not know what to say. Understanding was not like an anvil suddenly dropping on his head, a punch to the gut. It was working much slower this time, trickling inside him like poison, dripping noisily in the spaces between his organs. This could not be happening. But he’d thought that before, and it still happened. He glared a little harder.
But then again... Draco thought about his list of sins. How he betrayed Him and Harry at the same time. How he broke the trust of all the people he cared about most. How he hurt them all. He… he knew what’s going to happen to him now, because he’d already lived through it once, knew just how terrible it would be. Pain beyond pain until nothing remains, he’d done it once, and he will do it again. Nothing else would hurt quite as bad, nothing else could undo him, but this would. It will be the worst way to die. It will be what he deserved.
“When I came back that night,” Harry said, an inch from his ear, “You… Draco, you were scared of me. I saw it in your eyes. I knew you were scared, and it was the worst feeling in the world. If I need to never drink again in order to avoid it, then it’s really a small price to pay.”
“Oh, right.” Potter stepped in, unsure but pulling on a brave face. “It’s… well, tomorrow is my mother’s birthday. I was in the area visiting family, and I thought – dunno, I didn’t want to spell flowers for her. I wanted something more… real.”
, the cold voice said, and Draco was instantly and very violently ill all over the carpet. He couldn’t stand it anymore. He had to get out somehow. If he could slice his head open and cut the voice out with a knife, he’d do it. If he had to rip out his eye, reach into his brain and
here, Sir Harry. Or, should I say, if there was any princess here, it’d be me. Princess Draco, if you wish. And I have retired to this castle especially so I could avoid the likes of
“Draco, stop. I don’t want you to apologize for that. I’m not the least bit mad, not about what you said, not about the bond. I’m angry with myself, and I’m furious with him, but not with you, not even a little. Okay? Is that… does it mean anything?”
The smile on those thin lips was completely humorless. “There will be retribution for what’s happened, Potter. You must know this. Even you are not that foolish.”
“I’m not very good with speeches,” was how he began, to loud whoops from his friends in the audience, “So this is going to be brief. Let’s hit it with the hard truths first: is it weird to admit you two were my first real loves?” Harry grinned, and everyone laughed, though it looked like Ron was fighting down tears. “Before I met you two, I had nothing. I didn’t have friends, I didn’t have a family, I didn’t have people who cared about me or who got me. And then in you I got all that, and so much more. Ron, Hermione, I could never thank you enough for everything you’ve done for me, shown me, taught me. Through watching you I learned everything I know about being kind, being brave, being smart. Being loyal. Being in love. The two of you, you were the first people who ever loved me in my life. And for that I will always be grateful.” He stopped to swallow heavily, and the air was thick under the canopy. “You made me hopeful. In all the ways you’ve saved my life – and there are so many of them – that to me is the most important. You gave me hope. You made me think that maybe I could have a normal life after everything that’s… that one day I might even find something like the love you have for one another. Which is the worthiest cause to celebrate, if there ever was one.” Harry raised his (still full) glass. “So, before I get too carried away. Here’s to my two best friends, my family. My heroes. To Ron and Hermione.” He took the tiniest sip then put the glass down, slinking back to his seat to uproarious applause, and his hold of Draco’s hand hurt.
“You? hurt me? Never.” Potter must have heard the sarcasm in his tone, it dripped off every syllable and practically pooled on the carpet. “Please, let us go to the kitchen. I see you brought food.” It was rather ridiculous, excusing Potter’s behavior in him being afraid to hurt
“So we’re agreed,” Harry tried to smile, then got back to his feet. He offered Draco a hand, pleading him with a look. It felt like a very loaded gesture, like if he will not accept his hand now, something will be forever broken between them. He waited for a few seconds, not even daring to breathe. Draco bit his lip and just looked at him. In the end, though, he took the hand and let Harry pull him up.
Malfoy closed his eyes when he heard the name, and Harry could tell he was fighting with himself not to say what he wanted. “You don’t know me, Potter,” was what he did say in the end, and Harry bit his lip. It was true, he didn’t know him, not really. But he was starting to… or at least, it felt like he was. “You have no idea what I am willing or able to do. What I must do.” He opened his eyes, and the terror in them was so clear, it rattled Harry to his core. “I cannot fight him like you did, I can't even stand to look at him. To think about him. His power is…” he shook his head, unable to express his horror in words. “You’ve not seen what he can do, not really. You don’t know anything.”
, but you’re supposed to be my friend, aren’t you? I’ve never seen you complain about the balance in our
“What?” Harry said quickly, trying to follow Malfoy in his eyes as the boy paced around him. “What kind of message? What did it mean?”
It was hard to say what they spent more time on; practicing or making out. If Harry had his way, they would hardly need their wands at all. What he wanted to do all day was to just devour Malfoy best he could. He was absolutely insatiable. The other boy had no complaints.
Time must have frozen still, and Draco kept waiting, but nothing happened. Where was his punishment? He pulled back, actively
. Remember what you need to do. To prove that he is His alone. To prove his devotion. So he sucked and licked and swiveled his tongue, telling himself he was reveling in the hands grasping his hair, in the low grunts of approval. Then it was over, and he swallowed the familiar result, feeling somehow like he’s overcome a challenge he wasn’t sure he could beat.
close to dying that day, and all because she walked on that street at that time. She almost died. Because of
Fredrick was good company, at least, walking through the desert. Through the jungle. Through the snow. It was there in the frozen ridge, finally, that his journey was to come to an end; from afar Harry could see the smoke, indicative of the beast. His dragon. His true test. It has finally arrived.
Definite screaming now; was he hearing them from inside the building? “So you – you let me think you were risking your life, that you were planning to fight Him all alone, when – there were magically able Aurors standing outside the building the whole time?”
“You should be careful with that,” the blond gave him a snide look. “You know what happened to the cat that shoved its nose in the wrong cauldron.”
With immense effort, Draco pulled himself back. Opening his eyes to find the green ones so close was a little disconcerting, but it was far better than the alternative.
“Oh, the most beautiful. She has big blue eyes, clear as morning sky. You didn’t say if you were single?”
He yawned again, and suddenly realized he won’t be able to keep his eyes open for much longer. The stress combined with the beer was taking all his systems down, one after the other. “I think I need to sleep now.”
Harry nodded, feeling slightly light-headed. “Good. Now do go and get some food, you lazy git." Malfoy gave him a mock salute and left the room, checking first to see no one was in the hall. Harry gave him a minute then followed to the Great Hall, where he was received with questioning looks around spoonfuls of gravy. He felt much better after his conversation with Malfoy, even though he was still a little concerned with how readily the boy spoke about… these things. And with him. It was so weird, he had to push it right out of his head. Surely Malfoy was just exaggerating out of nervousness or something. It’s not like he actually
“Oh, with the school life I’ve had, it’s no competition. Especially since we had Hagrid as a teacher. I never had to face anything that could beat a Blast-Ended Skrewt.” Draco found it hard to contain the liquid in his mouth.
Actually, it was more than all right, because Blaise brought his favorite Belgian chocolates, and Theo was the only person in the whole house who remembered Draco didn’t like oranges, and had them change all their biscuits. Because they were his friends, and they knew him. Because they were his friends and they cared about him.
“I was a prick,” he said in a tone he hoped would mollify Harry. “I’m –“ he couldn’t muster an appropriate apology, though, not now; even when he apologized in the past, when she came to help before his trial, it felt a far cry from satisfactory. “I’ll help, if you really think it could – if there’s something you want me to look into.”
Potter’s smile seemed a little watery, but he got to his feet anyway. “Lead me to the bastard.” Draco smiled too as he walked out the kitchen and kicked the bloody thing over to Potter for inspection. Perhaps this day was not going to be as bad as he’d imagined after all.
. He pushed the plate away from him, lips snarled, eyes shooting sparks, hands clenching into fists. No, furious wasn’t even close to cutting it. He was… his whole body shook as wave after wave of his most recent panic attack washed away from his system. He didn’t have them since the beginning of the year, but for the last five days – if he could trust the clock – he had them nearly nonstop. He hurled everything he tried to eat, he hit the walls, even tried to smash everything in the vicinity with wandless magic. It didn’t help. Nothing he did, said or felt made any difference in the headmaster’s resolve. Harry was so infuriated, he couldn’t even think about Dumbledore without wanting to burst into flames. Or better yet, watching him burst into flames. He kicked the wall, winced at the pain in his now stubbed toe, and sank back down to the sofa. He was raging. He was…
Draco gave a sad little snort. “You only fell for me because you saw me as a victim. Just as he intended. You thought I needed your help, and that made you open up to me. You wouldn’t give me a second glance if I wasn’t in so much pain back then.”
he thought hysterically, trying to force himself to relax. He had had a panic attack before, not too long ago on his bed at the Dursley’s. But this time was far, far worse; he thought the room might be crumbling into pieces around him, there was no oxygen in the air, and he was choking –
“I never lied about that either,” Draco found himself begging the carpet. “Harry, I never lied about how… I never lied about that.”
“Yes, but since you didn’t give him any other explanation, that’s how he sees it. And he’s so upset about it, too, because right now you’re the only friend he has, and he thinks he lost you.”
work. That was the most evil, darkest thing I ever did in my life, I lose sleep about it still. So just say you fucking forgive me so I can try to put that terrible memory behind me.”
Then the yelling got closer as some of the Death Eaters were already gaining on him. He let them get near enough until he heard a very definite shout – “He’s here, we got him, right here!” he looked back; about ten figures running towards him. Good enough.
, he was his only ally here. And it was imperative to stay sharp now: he was in a cell he didn’t know, a dirty rag spelled over his eyes, without even the energy to sit up straight. He hadn’t eaten in gods-know how long, and hadn’t had a sip of water in just about the same. He needed to be very, very careful, because – and listen now, this was important – what happened the last time
Harry put down his quill and rubbed his eyes. He was so tired, the words on the parchment in front of him started to blur together. Lately he had a bit of a problem getting to sleep, as silvery-eyed figures kept taunting him awake. He looked up at the other two working quietly and sighed.
Good, solid question, Draco thought to himself, especially coming from a fishy, no-good liar. Why was Daniel’s date in His meeting? In what world did that make sense? “Oh, well - I think it was mainly to do with their symbolism. Did you ever think about how rich the symbolic world of flowers is? Everyone knows roses stand for love – but did you know that Anemones represent feeling forsaken? And I wonder if you know what black Dahlias symbolize?” before anyone got the chance to ask, Draco tugged Potter’s sleeve. “We need to get going, I think. It’s getting cold and you weren’t clever enough to bring a scarf.”
Because here, in the world where Draco was supposed to live, Potter would never want him. It was a clever curse, in that it gave him glimpses of what he could have had, if he were a better person. The answer to
“I liked that one a lot, actually,” Harry says, looking down at Draco’s lips. “Cause you were actually in my dreams. Every universe that Pansy gave me felt so familiar, I’m sure I dreamed all of them.”
“Too much?” not-Potter cuts in, his face the colour of Robertson’s purple cabbages. “I’m so sorry. Oh my god. I’m just going to crawl under the counter and die now.”
“Are those,” Ron stops in his tracks and leans in, getting far too close to a table of men, all of whom have terrifying muscles, “little squares with numbers on them?”
“Hey,” says Harry, his eyes stuck to Malfoy, and dumps a half dozen charts onto the counter. His despair at the prospect of more charting is heavy, but not as heavy as the silence. Malfoy hasn’t acknowledged him—is still staring at the ceiling.
Until Hermione mentioned the trial of Draco and Narcissa Malfoy—speculation about which was splashed all over the Witch Weekly.
Draco closes his eyes. Perhaps, if he pretends she isn’t here, if he just ignores the question, maybe everything will disappear.
For a moment, Draco stands in the streets of Diagon, a brass key heavy in his hand, a locking spell fresh off his lips, confused and lost.
Robertson spoke with his hands and had knocked over several unruly stacks of paperbacks as he spoke. “I only ask two things.” He’d looked down his wide nose at Draco. “First, and most importantly, do not steal my meatball subs.”
Harry should be responding. He should be producing words. But he’s still not quite accepted that, after years of searching, Malfoy has just dropped into his lap.
“You’re crushing me, you know,” Draco mumbles into the dark, and Harry sees himself close his eyes in undisguised relief.
A man in his late twenties sits, one leg crossed over the other, a light blue dress shirt tucked into his jeans. “Who are you?” Draco asks, squinting against the florescent light currently burning his retinas to a crisp.
And then Harry had asked Draco to take him shopping for a suit, correctly assuming that he would not have missed the opportunity to see himself in the most exquisite clothing Muggles had to offer. Starting small.
“It’s like the mould is being scrubbed by the cheery optimism of our flourishing relationship,” Draco had said, and while Harry knew he’d been joking, he can’t help but wonder if that’s a part of it. Privately, Harry suspects that the house somehow has access to the pH of his soul.
“Enough,” Pansy says, winking, before turning her attention to Draco. The bartender is trailing behind her, looking charmed. Carefully, he places four shot glasses on the table.
“This is weird,” Draco says. As he plucks one of his pens out of the jar on his desk, Harry realizes that Draco does still indulges in some of the finer things. The pen he cradles between those long fingers is heavy and the liquid is so coming out so soft and easy—
King’s Cross glistens around the refracting profile of an ancient-curse-who-may-also-be-fate, soft and clean.
The house unfolds into a bedroom with forest green walls and chipped paint. A few are people smoking, draped across the bed like spare clothes, the others wobbling into red cups.
“I mean, chasing Malfoy has always been this...” Hermione takes a deep breath, arranging her words with care before saying, “this existential goal of yours. He goes and you follow. What are you going to do now that you’ve finally caught up?”
“From a friend. A curse? Maybe fate?” Harry’s brow squiggles, puzzled. “I dunno what she was, but she took me by the hand and—”
Malfoy stands at the centre of everyone’s attention and does not flinch. Megan’s not looking at him.
The telltale pressure squeezes nausea from his pores, and Draco holds on, fingers tights in Harry’s. His feet clatter against industrial tile and Draco focuses on the hand that’s holding him, presses his chest into Harry’s spine.
“Are we on speaking terms then?” Malfoy asks, and the words are sharpened, almost bitter. “I was sure you’d somehow lost the ability, but then I saw you socializing with all those lovely nurses, half of whom are clearly in love with you.”
“That particular retort doesn’t do much to inspire confidence, young man,” he says, and then proffers a hand. “I am Robertson.”
The snow was light and lazy on his cheeks. Harry could see the spires of the manor poking up in the distance—declarations of power and wealth that had been standing for hundreds of years. The trees dipped their heads as Malfoy Manor bent the natural world to its will.
Draco doesn’t say anything, starts to move his hand in slow circles. He can feel the planes of Harry’s broad shoulders, smooth beneath his wet t-shirt.
“Are you okay?” There’d been worry between his eyebrows, on the edges of his lips. The truck was slowing down. Potter flicked the indicator and was drifting towards the shoulder.
Potter’s face is stern in a haggard sort of way. He looks so calm, staring down a court full of the most powerful witches and wizards in Britain, but his magic betrays him. Draco wonders if anyone else can feel it, if anyone else realizes that Potter is a massive cumulous cloud rubbing static into the air.
A part of him yearns for a hint of half-moon spectacles and a simpler ending. Cleaner. More finite. Where the corpse inside of him can rest. Harry gulps. Squeezes back. “No. Let’s go.”
Realization crashes heavy and full of damage. “I fucked up,” Harry says. “He must’ve got pulled away after we…and then he tried to tell me and I just…” Harry swallows, tries to force the things he’d said back down. “I said terrible things.”
The streets sway around him like a slow dance. Soft light filters through the leaves of the trees and Harry realizes that it’s early afternoon. The sky is overcast and Harry breathes in the moisture, chases the sounds of cars down the street.
“We’ve been in classes together for two year,” Potter said, sounding a bit morose. “I thought you liked me well enough.”
For three consecutive days, Draco had wandered into Robertson's and purchased a truly obscene number of Muggle classics.
The insistent drumbeats stop short and Harry swallows past the lump in his throat. Malfoy is on his doorstep. Malfoy, who left him alone after the best sex of Harry’s life, who left after he promised he wouldn’t—
“You have to breathe in,” Draco whispers. Harry’s lips part, and he feels the ghost of Malfoy’s mouth, and he breathes.
The hospital is a dizzy labyrinth of linoleum and synthetic light. Healers rush up and down, in that awful lime green that Pansy had once used to paint her toes. Every door looks the same and Draco allows himself to be tugged along, in a universe he’s no longer sure he wants to exist in.
Five years ago, in those days and weeks after the war that had wept like an open wound, Harry’d had no idea what he wanted to do with his life. A year of chasing and being chased by a sadist megalomaniac had really put him off magical law enforcement. Ron began Auror training and Harry did not.
“The stars,” Draco couldn’t put what he’d seen into words. Stars. Hundreds, maybe thousands, bright and white, as if the sky has its eyes wide open and Draco was seeing it’s true face for the first time.  Bearing witness to the galaxy without alteration.
“Even if the classic enemies to lovers plot line were not so well trodden, the look you wore when you entered my shop told me all I needed to know.”
In the quiet place between sleeping and dreaming, when his thoughts were at there most biting and real, Harry knew that she was placating him.
“You mean when you told me about your crush?” Hermione says and Pansy snorts. “Oh Harry, that was ages ago—”
Draco’s face snaps back into place—the emotional elasticity of his features returning to something haughty and indifferent.
Pansy throws her head back and laughs. “Unlike you, I would never limit my conquests to people with dicks,” Pansy shouts, winking at him, and turning to press a kiss to the piercing on halter-top’s full bottom lip.
“Draco?” Robertson says, emerging from some hidden corner of the shop, light on his feet as he approaches Draco’s exertion. “Are you abusing my register?”
“C’mon,” Harry says, pulling them away from the enormous tables covered in small figurines. The chairs are crowded with boisterous twenty-somethings, some yelling, some rolling dice.
They are sitting at a table in the middle of a gaming café that specializes in, but is certainly not limited to, intense matches of a card game called
“Dr. Potter,” a nurse says, and Harry drifts back to awareness. It’s the same nurse—Megan? She has red flecks on her scrubs.
There’s an inch between them—maybe less—and Harry closes it, leaves his lips there for Draco to take. The listless fields sway as the sun melts off the sky, and Draco buries his fingers in the neck of Harry’s shirt. Pushes back into Harry’s space. Bends over him, their chins touching, and holds on, possessive and urgent and almost but not quite there.
As if magically summoned, Robertson bursts onto the scene, crashing through the front door, cradling a bag of produce in his arms. “Draco, my sinister shopkeep!”
“It’s just a collection of potentially observable universes that represent every possible future in every possible world. It’s nothing, really.”
Bodies hurry through the green privacy curtain. “We need to get her on the stretcher,” Harry says, and reaches down. The girl’s arms are jerking, her body stiff under his hands.
Harry is stunned. This has been a very bizarre afternoon and Harry opens his mouth to say so, until a memory of Dumbledore beginning his first welcome feast at Hogwarts with, “Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!” reminds him that it’s all a matter of comparison. “I didn’t expect to get advice on my love life,” he says instead.
He didn’t have a job or live at the manor. The troop of Slytherins he’d left behind were a united front of silence, each one ridiculously tight lipped and, allegedly, completely clueless.
“I’m not worried about that,” Robertson says, giving Harry a look that’s half intrigue, half recognition, although Harry’s sure he’s never met him. “I can find titles to appease any customer. But first, I would like to know what’s got your face looking like an overripe turnip.”
It’s as he’s composing a reply, still straddling the concrete railing, six feet of desperate man perpendicular against the sky as his thumbs race across the screen, that he hears the sirens.
. The foregone conclusion barrels forward and it does not appear to give a fuck about Draco’s preferences.
“I bought it at an Electronics Shop.” He says the last two words slowly, determined not to botch the pronunciation.
“You know yourself better than I do. If you tell me you don’t want to die, I believe you. That and,” John looks Draco up and down. “Sorry, but you look too wrung out to lie to me.”
Harry thinks, but the circles don’t stop and Harry holds onto the feeling of someone touching him in kindness.
Draco nods. Harry focuses on the single point of red light at the end of his cigarette. “But that’s a story for another time.”
“Oh, aren’t you the pinnacle of wit. What a brilliant comeback, Potter. Have you always been this clever?”
There was something different here, something off in the way that Harry was looking at him. In school—in sixth year more than the others—Potter’s eyes had been on him. Followed him everywhere, until Draco thought he’d go mad.
“I’m not,” Narcissa says. “I’d already purchased you apartments, in case you should decide to reside closer to your workplace.”
“You’re upset. No, don’t argue with me,” Hermione says, cutting Harry off before the words have formed on his lips. “Stop pretending. It’s really quite pointless.”
Draco’s hand reaches between them, wraps around his leaking cock. Pulls Harry to the edge in needy hurried jerks, but it doesn’t matter, because contentment is flowing through him, between them.
The sounds of the stranger’s release mingled with the muted thrum of the music. Celestina was finishing her condemnation in a low, pitchy note.
“Mr. Potter, it’s an honour,” the man with the gavel says, and Draco suddenly understands the kind of power saving the wizarding world can afford a person. There is no other man alive who could stride into the middle of a formal hearing unencumbered. “Your presence here is a bit…unexpected.”
“Sometimes, we forget to look up,” Harry said. Those green eyes could join them, glinting like that. He was a man made of star stuff.
Merlin, the song is apt, and as rain pounds his windows and dripps down his spine, Draco surrenders to it. The despair and the rage and the music
Eventually, the world stills, the street bleeds under the curses that have gouged out the pavement storefronts.
Harry really hadn’t expected anything to come of it, that day in February five years ago. The wind moved across the snow like a hand drifting over silk when he’d strode up the lane. The air was cool and it bit at Harry’s cheeks, nibbled the corners of his eyes.
“It stopped being a choice the moment they laid hands on you.” His mother’s face is impenetrable. The world feels small—in that the most important part of it is right here in front of him.
“Please!” Harry said, rushing into a familiar room. The ballroom. Harry knew the fireplace, the mirror, could picture where the chandelier had hung before Dobby had brought it crashing down.
Draco looks at him, admires the planes of his shoulders, the brown of his skin against the deep green fabric, and has to ball his fingers into fists to stop himself from tearing the clothes to pieces. Arriving with the buttons in tatters, the jacket wrinkled, the trousers damp would be well worth it, probably.
“Take a break?” Malfoy repeated, disgusted. “Take a break? What exactly have we been doing all this time? You’ve not made any progress with the Unforgivable curses. Your Occlumency still needs a lot of work, and it’s already – we have already – bloody hell, Potter, it’s pathetic. This whole thing is absolutely pathetic. We had all this time on our hands, and now… look what we have to show for it now.”
. Not once in three years had Draco slept on the bed. He was so tired that he fell asleep immediately, warm chest glued to his back, but even in his dreams he was confused. The world he woke up to was uncomfortably new, and Draco didn’t like it. He didn’t like it one bit.
“I don’t know. I trusted you, I... fell for you. You could have used that – you could have made me love you, then take me right to him. I would have gone anywhere with you. Not because of him or of his plan, but because of you. Who you are.”
“I don’t fucking know, Harry!” Draco’s outburst was inevitable. “I don’t have all the answers! I’m sick, sick,
Draco wondered how much to divulge. He didn’t think he’d be able to lie right now, not when he was this vulnerable. “Not for a while. And then – yes, there was one person I talked to.”
“Not exactly what I meant,” Harry said desperately to the room, but of course there was no answer. It looked like… well, like the room thought he was going to actually force Malfoy to speak to him. He quivered slightly. At least make another chair, he thought, and a chair formed in front of his eyes. There was no more time to make any other adjustments, though, because at that exact moment the door opened and Malfoy walked in. Harry closed his hand around the small sneakoscope.
“How are you feeling, son?” Lucius asked, and it was all Draco could do not to laugh. He simply could not afford to spend so much energy at the moment.
“An hour, yes, I know,” Draco murmured uncomfortably. He terribly wished the elf would just look up at him. Being treated like a master was highly upsetting, and he’s already been through so much tonight. “I will give him the potions. You can – thank you very much. For, er, helping him.”
with him, which was even more remarkable. And just… just was there, with him, all the time like that, like he somehow had the right to do it. It was absolutely the best thing he could have done, and the worst punishment he could imagine for himself. To tell the truth, Draco sort of missed kneeling.
He half-turned his head to her, still keeping the tall man in his sight. Draco really disliked the cold look of determination on her face. “Pansy, please, stay out of this. Go back and find Goyle, okay? You can take him back to the castle
Draco opened his eyes and stared at him. How can Potter say that to him? And so calmly, too? “You don’t?”
“I will tell you, dear son, all you need to know. As to whether she is saying the truth or not – I suppose there is an easy enough way to find out. We could simply wait and see what changes time will bring forth. But you are right; time is exactly what we do not have. The alarm, boy, means Harry Potter has been spotted in the castle.”
Draco wanted to thank him. He wanted to say how much he loved him, how much it meant to him, how he still craved Harry’s approval and thrived on his praise. But he couldn’t. All he could do was gesture to the papers, forgotten on the floor, with a questioning look. “Which one did you like?”
For a second it seemed like the Slytherin was going to fall back onto his neck, but then he mastered himself. “Yes, yeah, I guess it was. I’m sorry.”
, they were never going to be. But that was a part of the charm, wasn't it? And everything seemed charmed to him right now with Malfoy in his arms.
“Cover me,” he nodded and sped towards where Neville was pointing, firing blindly ahead. He got the one in the corner, who exploded into thin smoke in a loud crack. He could hear the others firing curses around, but had no idea where to. Looking hard for cover, he dove behind a bookcase, and looked back out.
He shrugged. “You go there early on Sunday morning, and I always worked Saturday night. Besides, I knew you were there, so I’d never, you know. I didn’t want to see you. I didn’t want to see anybody.”
“These are just suggestions from their catalogues,” Hermione interjected. “But I’ve checked, and all of them allow you to create your own design if you want. I was just telling Draco that I think he should – “
He’s asked before. The first time Grove raped him he asked him. And the first time he punished him in front of the whole ward. After some time he stopped asking – so when they hung naked pictures of him on the guards’ door, he didn’t ask. And when they made him kneel for hours, he didn’t ask. When they came to his cell at night and made him strip he didn’t ask. But now, looking from his father’s ashen face to Grove’s, to Rutgrass and Field and Parker smirking in the corner, he had to ask. He needed to know. He needed to know why this was happening to him.
“Yes, I remember hearing about it,” Draco said carefully. His father told him about Pettigrew and his connection to the Potters. He had rats turning into people in his nightmares for weeks.
The hand on the back of his neck kept Draco in his spot. “Such a threat will not be taken lightly, Harry. I will not make the same mistake Father had, I will never underestimate you. Let’s see… Draco, you are bound to me. You will do as I say, yes? You have to do as I say.” Everything felt so off-kilter, even He sounded strange. “Of course, the bond will compel you even after my death. This is my command, then; whatever hurt is inflicted upon me, you will bear too – twice as hard. If I am hit with a stinging hex, you shall hit yourself with two. If I lose a finger, you shall cut off two. And if I die – then you shall, too, kill yourself. Immediately and in the same manner. Am I clear?”
Draco let out a stunned exhale, peering even deeper. Could he, really? The mayhem in his head was nowhere near able to advise. In the utter chaos, there was only one voice he trusted to give him a straight answer. Only one voice that would be stable still, the one he pretended he can't hear, the one he won't ever stop hearing. Well, then? What say you?
He did bring his homework along, but was far too agitated to study. He had no idea why he was feeling so nervous. It was nothing like the last time they were here alone, with the torturing devices and the scary atmosphere. Now that the room looked normal, it had a… friendly vibe. Harry was startled when he realized he was hoping to have a friendly vibe with fricking Malfoy.
voices to begin with, because voices equaled crazy, and Draco didn’t think he was crazy. Not now, anyway. Not in the normal sense of the word. In the less conventional, loose sense of ‘doing things that will most certainly ensure utter and terrible doom’ then yes, sure, he was crazy. But Draco didn’t really care about that at the moment. He had very little space in himself to care for much. Hell, he’d been dead for years now and he didn’t even know it. But it must have been the case because now with Potter he realized he is finally, finally, alive.
“She was probably right,” Malfoy said softly, his eyes still wide and questioning. “You do need to mean them, otherwise you can’t perform any of the Unforgiveable curses. But, Potter, don’t you – “ he considered his words before continuing. “Isn’t Dumbledore teaching you how to use them?”
Finally Draco succeeded, pulling the sleeve back down and intently avoiding Harry’s eyes. “It’s nothing,” he said softly, but like hell it was.
“Of course it's perfectly on par, name-calling and threatening murder, but never mind. I wouldn't ask you to understand. Obviously I made a mistake worthy of that punishment, but it seems like that wasn't enough. Which brings us back to our original question,” Malfoy fired, collapsing on a desk. He was shaking slightly with fury. “What on earth is it that you want from me? Would you make me go down on my knees and beg until you’re satisfied? Or is humiliating me in front of your friends ever going to be enough?”
“I didn’t want to, it was just…” more flashes, and this time Draco imagined he can hear screams too. He found himself shaking and grabbed a bed-post for balance. “I – the most important thing was to keep you safe, right? So I had to lie a little. It was just, well, I didn’t know the extent of the… bond between you and your boyfriend. I thought that if he knows everything you think, and I told you about Aurors being there – “
“Is it?” Draco snorted. “You play for the Auror’s junior team in the Ministry’s league, don’t you?” Potter nodded, confounded at this line of questioning. “Ever met a man by the name of Rutgrass?”
“What did you do to him?” he whispered instead, because apparently his voice box didn’t get the memo.
“I can’t even try to think of a time you weren’t a slimy, duchy arsehole who deserved nothing more than to get properly punished – “
“Dobby is still connected to his old masters,” he explained in a little voice. “Not bound anymore, but – but Dobby can still access their connection and tell you where they is, if Harry Potter wanted.”
of himself? He thought about it. What did he have to be proud of? The boy was ruined. He stopped existing in more ways than one. After tonight he would beg them to train him, only so he wouldn't have to be a person anymore, so he wouldn't have to think about it. He… he was ruined.
Malfoy sighed heavily. “This is such bollocks, Potter. Not everyone is all saintly like you. But it doesn’t matter, anyway. I’ve given up. Your fucking angelic friends and hero Professor can do whatever they like with me. It’s possible that I deserve it, too. I just want to get it over with, okay?”
Harry was stunned. “Malfoy, you know I'll never use this against you. I will never threaten you or hold this information above you in some way. That’s not who I am.”
Potter looked very uncomfortable for a moment. “It was her own idea. I just told her how Narcissa saved my life, and well, she remembered how you wouldn’t say it was us back in the Manor. So she wanted to do something for you. She said the way the courts were handling the end of the war was terrible.”
“No, but you might have done, for all you think of me! Here I was all this time, thinking you’d actually liked me – thinking that you wanted me here – “
when he should have been silent, because he simply could not stop it. There was no rebuke, though, no harsh words or impatient tugging; He let him scream, and Draco was so grateful. All he wanted was to… he didn’t know what he wanted. Safe to say he didn’t know anything anymore. Void, void and emptiness, void and emptiness and Him. That’s all he had left. When He was done Draco was just left there, still wide open, not even able to yell anymore. He wondered, dazed, how long he'd have to wait before he finally, finally gets his punishment.
“Please, you have to hear me out. Please. I know I was such a git, I can’t believe myself. I didn’t even know if I was safe enough now, but I had to come, had to tell you that you didn’t do anything wrong or something – “
frightened, this wasn’t going to be enough; he was smack in the in the middle of the worst panic attack he’d had in months when a loud crash made him jump. “What was that?” he cried, hysterical, “What – what – “ more crashes; things were breaking all around him, Mother’s wine glasses, the large living room window, the glass frame of the picture hanging on the wall. “Harry, what’s happening, what –“
“Yeah, I get it. For me too. It was very raw.” He handed Draco a full plate and his smile softened even further. “I got you butter chicken, not spicy. I think you’ll like it. This place is my go-to Indian takeaway, and for good reason.”
Potter ended up cleaning the bathroom for him. He also hoovered the carpet, changed the bedsheets (Draco didn’t have the heart to tell him he shouldn’t bother), and took the bin bag down. By the time he was done, the place was sparkling clean, far better than if Draco would have done it by himself. It was almost a nice feeling, even if he still felt like utter shit. The only problem was, now that it was all done, Potter would probably leave and Draco would be alone again. It was too early in the evening to go through all that once more. He carefully situated himself in front of Potter who looked about, assessing his work.
Draco shook his head. “When has that ever happened? It’ll all be okay. Go.” It took about five more minutes, but in the end he really did go. Draco sat himself down in the library a little stiffly and picked up the potions book he left there. Right. He will read a little, then make himself dinner (because he promised Harry, and he’d disappointed him enough for a lifetime, he reckoned) and by the time he’d be done with all that, Harry would be back. Solid plan. Very good. His fingers had some trouble flipping the pages till he got to where he was last, and with a sigh he dove in.
“What is it?” he tried to sound calm, but when his voice cracked a little he opted for more beer instead. It came to about the same thing, really.
At some point his belly made a really loud growl, practically booming in the silent room. Draco raised his head and looked at him with something resembling a smile. “You’re hungry,” he said, and his voice was almost normal.
“So I’ve been told, yeah.” Potter scratched his head uncomfortably. “Draco, look, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to imply anything by it. I just want to know that… that you’re looked after.”
“Breathe, Draco, let’s do it together. In through your nose, very good, and out through your mouth. Excellent. Once more. Tell me where you are.”
“Oh, and look, they have these adorable little butterflies – “ Draco was fairly certain he’d never seen these butterflies in his life. A short wave of revulsion rose within him. David, the delivery man, had a very peculiar way of flirting, or so it would seem. Did he really bring these dreadful things here and put them in the bouquets? Apparently, Draco not willing to engage with him at all made for some bold moves on his part.
“Oh relax, Potter,” Malfoy spat, his eyes finally finding their way back to Harry. “I didn’t tell him anything he didn’t already know. Who your friends are, what teachers drool over you, that kind of thing. Nothing that satisfied him to hear.”
“No. It’s not just that anymore. It’s not been just that for a while now.” He didn’t know why, but saying these words was like unloading a heavy burden off his chest, like making a confession. He’d spoken to Ron and Hermione about it, maybe not in so many words, but he was sure they knew. But telling Malfoy… it was something different altogether. He was very nervous now, and sweaty and itchy all over again.
“Harry, wait,” he heard Hermione saying from somewhere above him. “Wait, let me see that thing for a moment?”
Harry nodded, feeling very far from ready. He tried not to look too downcast as he raised his head and took a deep breath. “Let’s do it.”
The silence that struck between them after his last remark lingered, tense and cold. Potter took a deep breath, and Draco found that he had to see his face now, for he was beginning to feel the familiar dread throbbing, hot and barbed inside him. With all the uncommon lashing out he just exercised, he didn’t find it liberating. He found it terrifying. He wanted nothing more than to go to his rug and curl into a ball, never to reopen to the world again.
That seemed to get the blond’s attention; he raised his head in surprise, almost in shock, eyes zooming between the headmaster and Harry. “What do you mean, Professor?”
And – all the air left him in a shuddery exhale. Draco examined his muddy hand, dangerously close to laughing now, because how ridiculous was it? The whole entire thing. His whole bloody life was just so ridiculous. He used to live (?) in a flat in London with the bloody Dark Lord (?!) and now here he was (?), getting filthy in the middle of absolutely nowhere? He used to be Draco fucking Malfoy, and then he used to be nothing, he used to be broken and nothing and now he was... this? Whatever this was? Just what the hell was that supposed to mean? What was he meant to derive of any of it, these last few months, these last few years? Was any of it meant to make any sort of sense to him? Because it didn't. It just didn't. Nothing made any sense, and where the fuck even was he? Draco looked up, for the first time noticing the blossoms on the apple trees, and something in him cracked.
Just as he thought that, Harry turned around to see the door standing ajar. “Draco?” he said, the only voice Draco could still make any sense of, and his face lost all the color fighting brought out. “Draco, where are you?”
“So with this little thing,” Potter’s doubled voice said, then he pressed a button and suddenly the rectangle went silent in Draco’s hand, “you can call me whenever you want. When you do go back home, I mean, or wherever, whenever you need. I was thinking that once you’ve mastered it, we could use it to chat in the evenings. This way you could – you know, make the call if you wanted me to come by or not. Ha, I didn’t mean it as a pun, just… you could decide for yourself if you wanted to see me.”
Harry scoffed, but then sobered quickly. “Wait, Draco, stop. We were talking about something else. something serious.”
“I’m not doing anything. I don’t have your bracelet, I didn’t – can I touch you? Draco, can I hold you?”
Defence against the Dark Arts class proved to be a total nightmare. Every lesson they faced different types of threats in different simulated terrains, and it was only the four of them. It was practically impossible to ignore Malfoy in these lessons, as he had to try to work with him to get through the challenges. And then on Monday Professor Electra said something that terrified him to his very bones. “We’re going to divide into pairs today, and try a slightly different scenario.”
, and for now, miraculously, it did. Draco would have done a victory lap over the living room if he only had any force in his limbs.
“Like a baby,” Malfoy said smoothly, and Harry heard the sheets rustle as he left Ron's bed. Then he gave a startled yelp as Malfoy sat on
“No, it’s true. I’m so mad at myself. I never should have lost control like that, I should know better by now. I tried so hard this morning, but I - you were so close, and I'm so tired, and I just lost it. I’m not… you did nothing wrong, Draco. You did so good. I’m so proud of you.”
Draco felt sufficiently ashamed of himself. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it like that. I know it wasn’t – I know, I’m sorry.”
“Of course,” Narcissa shook her head. “My darling… of course. If that’s what you want, then… that’s what we’ll do.” It became quite obvious to him that they had discussed this before. He didn’t know whether to feel relieved or infuriated.
“You alright, mate?” he heard Ron speaking as if from a different planet, and did his best to pull himself back to the room around him. Apparently he was stuck at the very door to the hall, attracting many glances. He shook his head, steeling himself, and stepped in.
“It’s exactly that arse I’m beginning to like, Potter, so don’t go changing too much. I don’t think I could stand a different kind of imbecile bringing me food and cleaning the flat for me and being a fucking saint all the fucking time.” Potter smiled back, and the nervous feeling in Draco’s gut loosened somewhat.
The class he had been most concerned about, obviously, was Potions. Harry strongly suspected the Headmaster must have had some words with Snape, since Harry definitely did not receive marks high enough to enroll in N.E.W.T level class. However, he was in, and was fairly sure Dumbledore convinced the Potions master to change his bar this year. Ever since the very brief encounter with Snape on the first night, Harry dreaded spending a whole hour and a half with him underground. It was Wednesday when he finally had his first Potions class, and by that time Malfoy had managed to get him so completely off balance, Ron and Hermione started to look concerned. It was just infuriating how he was there, wherever Harry went; like a relentless, pesky shadow he couldn’t lose. And down here with Snape as well… he closed his eyes and prayed he can keep himself in check.
Harry scratched his head, thinking hard. “I don’t know. I don’t know if I can be friends with you. I mean, it’s too weird.” He wasn’t sure if the slight shadow in the grey eyes was of disappointment. He soldiered through. “But I guess you could say we are. Wow, who would have thought. I guess Voldemort will come out with a declaration of peace and love any moment now.”
The service flew by him; Harry couldn’t even hear what McGonagall was saying until Draco squeezed his fingers and the question echoed:
It was only when five o’clock arrived with one disheveled and anxious Harry that Draco realized what he did all day, and it really wasn’t about the cooking at all, in the end. He was practicing saying no.
“What are you trying to do, Malfoy?” Ernie asked bravely, putting his arms on Malfoy’s shoulders as he started to move, writhing to release himself from their grasp.
“Perfect, that’s exactly what I have!” he handed Draco the notes and took the flowers from his hands. “Oh, I hope he will like them! I hope I won’t make a total prat of myself!”
, woohoo,” he floated his hands in the air and imitated what presumably was a mentally-ill ghost, “but I’ve been calling you Draco and it’s totally normal and I love it, so – “ then he stopped, looking quite mortified, which allowed Draco to smirk. “Oh, shut up, you love it too.”
“Come on, of course you’re my friend. I’ve already went through the trouble of getting my lips used to saying it, so don’t you dare going back on me now.”
, which was as good a proof as Draco could stomach that she was really alive. “How – how did she look?”
, like nothing he ever did in his life, “I don’t care what you fucking promised, Harry! What the hell do you think it means, now? You’ve broken every single promise you ever made me. What, did you think I could ever trust you again? I don’t want you here! Go away!”
“There is one thing you can do. You can always talk to Dum-“ he stopped when he saw the look he was given. “Never mind.”
“Are you mental? Dementors over human guards? What could they possibly do that would be worse than bloody Dementors?”
“But why did you even have your guard up in the first place? What were you scared he’d find out?” Harry hardly even recognized this tiny voice that came out of his mouth.
Could it be that Draco’s tendencies of compartmentalization and denial exposed Potter to risk? Could he have been the reason why he nearly – that he was so severely –
“You don’t have to,” Harry reminded him gently. He wanted so bad to touch him, but wasn’t sure if it’d be the right thing or not. The abuse Draco had been through – and he had absolutely no idea – but then Draco’s hand reached for his and he grabbed it, squeezing a sigh of relief. The hand was warm and rather clammy, but it was his Draco, and he wanted to support him so bad it was physically hurting him.
“Before you have a stroke.” Draco huffed and covered his face with one shaky hand. This was getting dangerous. As if the stakes weren’t high enough. “I’m not saying
“I should have… I should have listened to you. Your plan was going to work, and you wouldn't have been here if I hadn’t…” not that he could have done anything else, not after seeing his father, and still. He should have known.
“Yes,” he said, staring at her hard to see if she makes any moves to contradict him. Wisely, she remained silent.
“Well, first Macnair’s going to be interrogated about Marvolo, then he’ll be trialed. I’ve already spoken to Cap, I explicitly told him you won’t be giving evidence in person – if you agreed to, you can submit your memories, but you won’t have to face him ever again. Unless you wanted to, of course. I mean – Draco, whatever you want, okay? What’s going to happen from now on is only whatever you want.”
Potter dawdled in front of the phoenix painting in the hallway, almost like he was about to comment on it, but then moved on. The last room Potter checked was the bathroom, and he came out of it with a grim expression.
He must have been referring to the scowl on Draco’s face. “You can’t love me,” he said, and his anger (again with the anger? Where the hell does it keep coming from?) multiplied, heating him up from the inside. It wasn’t a pleasant heat, though. It could burn him.
“It’s not why I’m doing this,” Potter insisted. “I really do like to clean. It won’t take me five minutes, I promise.”
Grove swallowed a couple of times before answering. “A transfer. Get me out of Azkaban – any other prison, in any country, it doesn’t matter. A transfer, twenty years off my sentence – “
“Whoa - down, boy,” Malfoy was actually grinning now. “Let’s learn how to walk before we start running. I’m not even sure I don’t hate you anymore, so I think liking you is still a little ways ahead. And in any case… you couldn’t handle me, Potter. I’m way too much for you.”
“Whiskey’s pretty much all water, little Draco. No reason to cry like a sick whelp.” Grove sighed as he straightened up, making little stretching sounds. “Well, it seems he’s still not talking,” he concluded in fake sorrow, and the others laughed. “Can we start then, Stevie? Can we start with the questioning already, or is there any more of your precious bureaucracy to muddle through?”
“You’re not sure you’re going to do it,” Harry gasped, looking closely at him. “You’re still debating it over.”
“Christ, Draco, you’re so… of course I’m not going to arrest you.” Potter fixed the glasses on the bridge of his nose and pouted. Draco’s heart skipped three consecutive beats. “You were acting in self defence. No court in a million years will sentence you to prison, but… look, if you want to keep this between us, fine. I don’t see how it makes that much of a difference anyway. He was a piece of shit and I’m glad he’s dead.”
Nothing did. Nothing. Not even a tiny spark or a spout of accidental magic. Nothing. It was just Draco, holding a box in one hand, a bracelet in the other. A bracelet that used to be all that he had, that used to mark him as His, that used to give him confidence. A bracelet that he now hated more than anything he could imagine, ever in his life.
He found himself staring at the window, his mind empty and his stomach even more. With a sigh he got up and fixed himself a sandwich, still not turning the light on. It didn’t feel right, somehow, to sit under the warm lamps pretending everything was all right. For everything was very much not all right, and Draco knew it with every fiber of his being. He ate the sad sandwich – two slices of bread and nothing but a lettuce leaf inside, as a sort of a crude punishment for himself – sitting crouched on the floor in the dark. He felt better on the floor than on the sofa. It was more familiar, less frightening. And there was less of a chance he would fall.
Oh gods. Oh, no, oh gods, oh – no – Draco felt it scraping against his trousers, and stiffened to the point of wrinkling time into a pause. No. He won’t – they wouldn’t. Draco swallowed something sharp ang tangy and tried to say something, but he found he simply didn’t have the words. He didn’t know what to think.
They sat on the sofa in a more comfortable silence than Draco expected is possible. They chatted about silly things; a project Granger was working on, Weasley’s aversion to formal wear, the intricacy of potion making, Potter's opinion on different kinds of rice. It was almost pleasant. Draco forgot he can be pleasant.
“Yes, Potter. I know.” Draco released a long sigh, feeling his patience wearing. It’s been five minutes of this already. It was getting slightly ridiculous.
“Even I reach my limit sometimes, Potter. You’ve done enough as it is, and once again I am forced to emphasize how unclever it would be for you to pursue this.”
“He said he w-will – that he was sent to break me in,” Draco’s voice was barely audible. His head was bent so low, his hair touched the covers. “And I just couldn’t let it happen, Harry. So I gave them you. I gave them… I gave them me. Everything. All I had.”
to break him. Besides, he can’t be looking so forlorn, when it was all Draco could do not to run away from this idea and never look back.
He didn’t even know where to begin answering that. He didn’t know what to think. “So you have no idea why – “ his eyes stopped ravaging the files on the carpet as he spotted another picture and everything froze still. His eyelashes clinked when he blinked, he could swear it. He literally froze.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked, dumbfounded. The blond gave a non-committal groan. Harry stared at him. “I mean fuck, Malfoy, that was intense.”
Wiping his face Draco pulled himself back out of his head, determined to persevere somehow. It was right here, the information he could never get, wasn't brave enough to get, and he needed to know. The articles weren’t sympathetic, to say the least, though not entirely hostile – It would seem that losing her son before he was twenty one made people feel a little sorry for Narcissa, and it kept them from tearing her apart completely. Thank the gods for small mercies, he thought gloomily, flicking through the pages and religiously ignoring the pictures. That was really the best thing either of them could get out of this situation. With him gone, she could turn a new leaf. She could start again…
“Yeah,” Potter blurted out before he could properly give it a thought. “I mean, if you want to show me,” he added a second later with another expansive hand gesture. Draco groaned and rolled his eyes.
“It’s you,” Harry laughed into his neck, “It’s you, your magic, you’re doing it. Please just calm down, all right? It’s okay.”
“So what do you Gryffindors do at night around here?” Malfoy asked, giving the room another look over.
“There’s nothing for you to be sorry about. It’s just not Him. I want to – hell, I want to tell you His name. The name I know, at least, if it’s even His real one. I do. I’m just…” Draco didn’t know why he can’t. Was it because he was too scared to do it? Or because Harry was right, and the tattoo on his hip was making it impossible? Gods, he couldn’t even summon enough courage to say the name in his own mind. How could he ever hope to tell Harry? It was useless.
Harry seemed to be trying to gain some composure. “Draco, if it’s just a matter of getting you some fucking poison, there are other ways to do it. Hell, I’d get you some myself if it’s that important to you. We don’t need to go there for that.”
“I have Quidditch practice this Wednesday.” Maybe the blond realized how bitter he sounded, because he added, “Thursday?”
It was way too easy to get the potion. So easy, in fact, it made Harry’s stomach squirm with misgivings. So easy it felt wrong. Snape never even looked behind him as Hermione went on and on about the potion they made last week. It left the ground clear for Harry to steal into his office, covered by the cloak, and get a small cauldron full of the familiar Polyjuice potion. He was out before Hermione had even finished asking her question. Waiting in the hallway for her, still invisible, Harry chewed his lip so hard he tasted blood.
“Can you honestly not tell what’s wrong with that?” Potter looked desperate, sitting on the very edge of his chair.
“If Dumbledore believes in you so, why isn’t he training you? Why isn’t he trying to help you, to teach you some things you’d probably need in order to succeed?” Harry jumped as he heard his own concerns mirrored back to him. He looked back at the fire, trying to peer inside himself.
With a start, he looked around at the familiarly unfamiliar living room. “Where is here, even? Where are we?”
Lucius drew a sharp breath, and Draco could tell by the little spots of color high in his cheeks that he was furious. That did not help alleviate his own anger. “Remember yourself, boy. You have no right to speak to me like that.”
They both took a seat on either side of the sofa, and Draco found it harder and harder to look at him. His whole mind was a terrifying, glossy sort of chaos. Potter’s hands never ceased moving frantically in his lap. “I saw him.”
“Father,” he said again, although his mouth was exceedingly dry. Lucius was often cold, and mean and sometimes cruel; he dealt heavy punishments and Draco did not underestimate him. But this? Sending Greyback on him? This he didn’t see coming.
“Oh, who knows? Good riddance, I say.” Ron gulped down an entire glass of juice. “Further away he is, the better I sleep at night.”
“Did you really think I would fall for such a tired ruse, or did you hope I am wiped out enough to completely forget myself?” Draco shot his father a look of contempt. “You were never sorry for anything in your life. And to think that you would risk it for mine is just absurd. Had I not known you for seventeen years I may have thought it true, but please… that was a ravishing performance, though. Extra points to you for that.” He would never have been able to say so much if he weren’t so outraged, but there it was, plainly put in the air between them.
“And, I guess I was wondering if… do you think it’s possible that the magic in the tattoo is somehow connecting you? That there’s a charm in it, or something that opens a channel between you, or… something a little less creepy, but in that direction?”
, Potter who hadn’t given up on him, leave forever. He was the one who said all those horrible, terrible things to the only person who saw him in years. He was the only one to blame.
“I’m sure she doesn’t see it that way. I know I don’t.” He put a hand on Ron’s arm. “Mate, you’re fantastic. And I know she thinks so too, because she won’t stop staring at you. I think she’s only waiting for you to understand it as well.”
Draco took a deep breath and exhaled it slowly. It hurt, obviously. Everything hurt. But there was no way of telling if it was because his life was an absolute shit-show, or because of something more specifically sinister. He had no idea if it was in any way different than the usual, unbearable agony. The whole conundrum felt slightly comical, in a very non-funny, please-I-don’t-want-to-die sort of way.
As Snape wasn’t at the Great Hall for breakfast, or actually anywhere on the map that day, they had to postpone their plan, a thing for which Harry felt very fortunate. Instead they had a brilliant day sledding down the hill and skating on the frozen lake. It was uncanny just how elegant Malfoy was in any surrounding – whether he was spinning gracefully on the ice, or sliding down in great velocity. Everything he did seemed easy, light and smooth. Harry found himself just staring at him all through the day, amazed time after time by the sheen in his hair, the flush in his cheeks. He had never before seen Malfoy looking so – happy. He seemed like he was genuinely having fun. Even the shadows that normally haunted his eyes seemed less grave as they were frolicking about in the snow. Harry would have stayed out with him all day, all week even. If he could spend every single day of his life like this, he would probably be happy.
, and he trusted him only as far as he could throw him. But the thought of holding the slender figure in his arms in order to do so was stirring, so he let it go immediately. Miserable, he stared at the Slytherin table and at the one face in particular that wasn’t looking at him. How was he meant to keep an eye on him, when he couldn’t even bear to look?
But Harry was so reluctant to go away, so very much afraid, so out of his mind with worry, that Draco felt it in his bones when he left the next day. Harry was miserable, and that made him miserable too, and for the whole of the morning he didn’t know what to do with that feeling. He wasn’t alone – Harry roped Blaise into spending the morning with him, then had Pansy coming over in the afternoon, and of course Mother was there the whole time. But they didn’t know what to tell him either, and he just wanted to do something for Harry, to make him happy again, because he so missed being able to do that. There were times it was so easy, and then again there were times it was impossibly hard. Only when Pansy grumbled about being hungry at two o’clock, the idea came to him. He knew what he had to do. The only question was how.
“Oh, I’m sure I could take the Boy Who Lived on my own,” Malfoy nearly whispered, eyes narrowing again, “But then I’d have to explain to Dumbledore why his favorite hero is in so many pieces, and I’d like to spare myself the inconvenience.” Harry saw sparks emitting from the tip of his wand. Extremely satisfied, and not exactly sure why, he took another step forward so his face was nearly touching Malfoy’s.
That’s got to be the understatement of the century. Look at yourself, how easy it is to break your walls – you’re not even trying, not in earnest – Legilimence!”
“Draco…” Potter’s sigh made him look up unintentionally. “This is your choice, okay? You’re the only one who can decide: it’s your life, your job. Merlin, you’ve already lost over two weeks of business because of me. It’s really up to you.”
It was all just too much. Draco couldn’t possibly help him. Even putting aside the fact he was a total mess, that he himself needed so bloody much, he would be of no help. Potter needed someone strong, someone brave, someone real, and Draco was none of that. He couldn’t help him even if he wanted to, which he did, he did so much. But how? It didn’t make any sense. Potter was big and good and Draco was nothing. He could never. The fact remained though that Potter needed, and there was simply no one else around. Only Draco. Only he could help this poor, weak Potter. This Potter who was soft enough to die for, and whom Draco couldn’t help but want to curl into forever. It was impossible – he was a mess – he had no choice. Potter needed him, and Draco would do whatever he fucking has to.
Weasley overtook him on the stairs as he let his mind wander, and Draco snapped back to reality. He could not let himself be carried away – there were bloody lives on the line here. He needs to be present, and he needs to be careful. He peered at Weasley. Although he looked exactly like Goyle, there was no mistaking for a second he wasn’t walking alongside the real thing. There was a light of intelligence in his eyes that didn’t exist in the original pair. Draco stopped him with a hand on his arm when they got to the floor below.
“You don’t understand,” Malfoy said and sat down on an empty desk. “I’m not meant to make contact until I’ve achieved my goal. It’s not something I can just ask nicely for. I have to do it first.”
If only, if only there was something he could say, a way to convey how deeply and truly he regrets everything. “S-sir,” he said instead, because there wasn’t. There were no words. The curtain fell, and Draco’s mind was a wasteland, barren and desolate. When He was there, nothing else was. Nothing else
“Well, I…” he mumbled, digging in his messy hair. “I don’t really know. I don’t really know what I want from him. Hermione, he’s a
“Don’t worry, little Draco. Tonight we’re going to do it your way, I told you. We’ll only do what you want us to do.”
After eating their fill they stumbled back to the tower, both very heavy and hardly able to speak, and collapsed on the cozy sofas. There was no mention of the fact Malfoy has actually consented to sleep in Gryffindor for only one night; instead it seemed like an open agreement. For a long time they just stared comfortably at the fire, finding the silence between them both easy and natural. it didn’t feel odd anymore, to have this with Malfoy. Harry had come to expect it, even. He knew that when he was around Malfoy, he was at ease. They just understood each other, even without speaking. It was a connection quite different than the one he had with Ron and Hermione. Of course, he would give his life for them; the love he had for the both of them was stronger than any natural force in the universe. But the way he felt about Malfoy was… well, it was still complicated, and still brought him a lot of questions and concerns. But it was also easy in a way, easy and fun. And just… right. That was it: it felt right to be around him. Like he’d been missing something for a long, long time, and now he finally found it. whenever he saw the pale face brightening with a smile, he felt those annoying butterflies hitting the walls of his belly. He enjoyed being around him, enjoyed watching him happy.
A shiver went through him at the thought. The wind was cold, chilly October air, and there were things he needed to get to, but a persistent ray of sun bathed Draco in light and he couldn’t bring himself to move. Not just yet, not right now. This actually turned out to be a nice moment, unusually calm, unusually sweet, and he wanted to bask in it just a bit more. How often does he get to do this, really? To sit out here all by himself just admiring everything? Not as often as he wished. Mostly because it still took courage; it still wasn’t something he knew how to do so well, thinking, being alone, whatever. Perhaps that could explain his recent encounter with a figure dredged from the past where he very much belonged. But right now Draco didn’t need to torment himself, he didn’t need to be hurt. He felt alive enough as it was. Gods
“There must be a spell that makes every intruder shed blood in the castle,” Hermione explained with a disgusted look. “This way they can learn who exactly enters… and have specific wards against wizards whose presence they wish to exclude. Voldemort would have your blood in him, too, so it won’t be too hard to set it up.”
did not really work out for you, Father, whereas my way is still going according to plan. The Dark Lord is pleased with me. Tell me, was he pleased with you after the summer?”
For a second the blond just shook his head, stunned. Then he let his feet drop to the floor and got closer to Harry, leaning his head on his shoulder. “You’re only making it more difficult,” he replied, closing his eyes. Harry tried to remain still, debating with himself whether to put an arm around him or not. “You are such a git, Potter.”
He was in rather high spirits, as were the rest of the students, until the Professor actually started to divide them. She seemed to be picking people at random and assigning them together, and the results were disastrous. For starters, Ron was stuck in a group with Lavender Brown, Parvati and Padma Patil and Dean Thomas; not that they were such a poor bunch, but after everything that’s happened between Ron and Lavender last year, Harry understood why he looked so uncomfortable. Hermione’s luck wasn’t much better: she had Seamus in her group, and Michael Corner who was harmless enough, but also Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini from Slytherin. Nonetheless, Harry was sure he got the worst team: though he was a little cheered up by the presence of Neville, he also had Ernie, who was a little too pompous for his liking, and of course, Malfoy.
“You need to touch my face,” Draco whispered. Potter didn’t waste a second before a gentle finger crooked under his chin and raised his head, and Draco used the release to immediately close his eyes. He could not stand the look Potter was surely giving him right now, could not bear having to see it. Just how
“Four more to go!” Neville shouted, and they all regrouped behind a wall covered in posters. Harry took another second to appreciate his surroundings; Professor Electra really did an incredible job with the magic here. Even the air was crisp, everything was so –
Of course, hatred was something Draco Malfoy was very familiar with. Ever since he was nothing but a toddler, his own sense of self relied on hate to a certain extent. Yes, it relied also on family, on tradition, on stiff and obscure rules, on pride and on grandeur, but there was always that stem of hate in it too. Hate for Muggles, Mudbloods, blood traitors. Hate for Dumbledore and the Ministry, when he was old enough for it. Hate for anyone who was different. Draco resented these lessons only when he was wise enough to understand them, which was only extremely recently. At twenty-four, he still wasn’t sure he understands them completely. Obviously, He helped a lot with that - but the kind of hate He possessed was far too deep and too strong for Draco to comprehend, and he never even tried. There was no need to. There was only one thing He demanded of Draco, and it wasn’t his hate.
“In that case, you have to do it. You have to do it for me, Draco, but more than that… you have to do it for you. You know what happens if you are found. You know what the repercussions will be.” Draco nodded. He did know, only a little too well. “So will you help me, Draco? Will you do this for us? Will you give us the chance we need?”
on the wall for looking at him, he didn’t care. He didn’t care. He didn’t care at all, he wasn’t going to let anything stop him now, he’s already
“Yeah,” Draco’s mind was spinning slightly and he leaned against the wall for support, “he’s a real champ, isn’t he? So respectable. Having all his men here to fight one wandless teenager. Sounds like a frightening man.”
“Rutgrass. In the Ministry. I was called on this meeting about the transportation of some high-risk inmates abroad – this Albanian group who allegedly was in contact with – anyway, I went, and there he was, talking to this guard. I didn’t recognize him immediately, but then they all introduced themselves and… Fuck, Draco. I couldn’t sit there in the room with him. I wanted to… I couldn’t look him in the eye.”
, calling someone Sir was at the very least bewildering. “Not a big deal? Have you seen yourself? I’m already questioning your judgement as is, Potter. Don’t make it worse.”
A soft kiss pressed against the top of his head. “Be good, Draco. You know what you are to do. You have my permission to take any measures necessary in order to achieve your goal – I give you full leave to do as you need. Is that clear?”
“I told you before, Potter. There are no other options.” His voice was very soft. “Look, I’m sorry, but I’m not going to have the same conversation again and again. Actually, you know what? I’m not sorry at all. I thought I made myself clear. I don’t need your help.”
Everything was happening too fast, or maybe in slow-motion; he had absolutely no idea what’s going on. It took Him noticing and quickly deducing what had happened before the feeling of apparition overwhelmed him (Draco didn’t really do much side-along since – well), and suddenly there was no more sunshine as they were back in the flat, only this time Pansy was with them. Perhaps there was an exchange of words – maybe even a few screams – Draco couldn’t have guessed. He was far too preoccupied with being stunned senseless. So many things raced through his head; shock, relief, joy, fear, grief, love -
Although it was most definitely this major, life-altering trauma that pushed him here, Draco mused as he closed up the shop in the evening. Without it he would never have been vulnerable enough to end up where he did. Without it he would never have done what he – well, there was no point thinking about
A knock on the door had him out of breath for a second, before he heard the familiar voice. “Malfoy, it’s me. I brought food, if you’re hungry.” Draco sat up, heart racing, confused beyond reason. Potter was back again? Already?
“I wish I was. If only I could tell myself it was all in my imagination... but it wasn't. The guards and Aurors in Azkaban were worse than Dementors, and that should mean something to you. The Dark Lord was evil, but he never did – “
“All right,” Harry said, still not entirely convinced. His taking Malfoy’s wand at night seemed unbelievably cruel, and possibly dangerous too. But if Malfoy didn’t say anything about it, who was he to push on the subject? Dumbledore already knew how he feels about Snape. “So what now, Professor?”
