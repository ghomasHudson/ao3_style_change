“Ah, that’s where the problem begins.” Fat Friary flew slightly higher and Harry had to turn his head up to view his face. “He has barely changed from his Animagus form since his portrait was moved in 1368. He does not speak, does not respond to those who prompt him to. For hundreds of years, many have tried but the lion remains sleeping.”
"I apologize for my thoughtless comment, Harry," Madam Pomfrey said. "However, what you underwent rarely happens to ordinary wizards and witches. Naturally, magic can sustain one's needs for a longer period than usual, say, if one was on a fast, magic would be able to sustain their needs until for period of time."
What intrigued him now about Bloody Baron's story was how he was taught by none other than the founders of Hogwarts. It made perfect sense that he would know more information regarding Salazar because one, he was the founding father of his own House and two, would know whether Salazar was really murdering Muggleborns in the Chamber of Secrets. That may be more up Malfoy's alley for he was sure the Bloody Baron would not be shared with anyone outside Slytherin House on inside information about Salazar himself.
He never found out his answer as Professor McGonagall dismissed them for the day but left them with the assignment on figuring out the incantation for today’s lesson.
“Going through walls and all? Does it hurt you?”
"Not much. I woke up yesterday. Apparently, I've been out for three weeks. I didn't think I'd be out for that long."
"What's the last thing you remember, Mr Potter?"
"Before I forget, this weekend, or before our Thursday class next week, head to Hogsmead to buy several ingredients that you shall be needing for our Potions lessons. They are Sloth brain, Valerian root, Knotgrass, Peppermint, and Shrivelfig. Did you get that? Shrivelfig. We shall be brewing the Elixir to Induce Euphoria. Don't forget, my students. We want to create something amusing."
"Lockhart?" Harry gawked. "Gilderoy Lockhart?"
Panic struck Harry. Did he know about his goodbye letter? Had Malfoy read his letter? No, Madam Pomfrey assured him that a few people knew the contents of that letter yet why did Malfoy sound as if he simply
A lightbulb turned on above Harry's head. "Oh yes! Why didn't I think of that? Of course, he would be lots of help. He's always blabbering about Hogwarts history to anyone who would care. I think he knew a thing or two about Godric which, like, might help tell me how to get him to speak."
Harry wanted to ask more but Malfoy was keeping a stiff upper lip about it and he figured he would find out more information from Hermione or Blaise…. Or in two days when he walked out of the Hospital Wing. On to other serious matters….
"What did she, like, mean by that?"
"That's absolute nonsense," laughed Ron.
She paused and looked on at him. Harry had a gnawing feeling that she wanted him to come clean of some sorts, fill in the gaps or simply she wanted to pause and figure out how to politely to proceed. What was going through his mind was what Ron must have gone through when he could not wake him up the next morning for breakfast!
"How's that?"
underneath. In the back of his mind, he recalled the night at the Astronomy Tower and the several times Harry's eyes would wander, not up at the skies, but down to the grass. And the damn letter he had been writing, whatever it was.
"Dumbledore?" Harry echoed. "He had such a friend?"
Harry was closely starting to feel like a proper Muggle zombie.
Harry had to agree with Ron. Surveying those left, there were still plenty of Slytherins left but very few Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws. For some odd reason, he found himself eyeing Malfoy, and an even more odd reason, he was hoping that Malfoy did not have a partner yet.
Fat Friar seemed confused at first, his eyes questioning before he floated down below the ground and only half his body was visible. "I don't think it had anything to do with the Chamber. We all knew, mind, but I am almost positive that Salazar did not outright purge Muggleborns."
Malfoy crossed his legs, his back against the chair. "I do so try to wonder why that oaf is still at the school teaching that horrendous subject."
"Trelawney says it's because your oranges have been keeping you awake."
Malfoy began separating the ingredients in the order that they would be put into the cauldron for the brewing. "What do you mean?"
"You're dead!"
"We fought in the bloody war but apparently that means fuck all around here," Ron grumbled.
He got out of bed, wanting to get away from his thoughts, and upon seeing lights in Madam Pomfrey's office, shuffled his way over there.
And Malfoy did the most unexpected thing that he ever thought possible: he smiled. A genuine smile, without its accompanying snark nor sarcasm, and it was so pure Harry looked back down at the flower in his hand.
Harry smirked. "Touché. How's Ron doing?"
"Perhaps one day the Battle of Hogwarts will also be forgotten in, like, thousands of years to come. We will only be a sentence in the history books and, like, that's it. Maybe that's all we live for."
"Wiggenweld potion"
"Goodness Ron, that wasn't a writing assignment but a reading one."
"You never finished writing your letter…"
He was under no illusion that his father was the worst kind of human being, do not get him wrong. He deserved everything that ever came to him, including Azkaban. But regardless, Lucius was still his father, always was, always will be, and no matter what his mother deserved a moment to say goodbye for his father. She deserved to bury her husband but Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt refused, letting his body rot and wither away in Azkaban until the end of time.
"No problem!"
"Fair point. It'll be interesting to see who shall take the position. Perhaps another ghost?" Malfoy smiled, the same pure and soft smile he had when they were in the 4F classroom earlier today. "Alright, we have all our ingredients ready and we can begin. I want you to take the Sopophorous bean and crash it with a silver –
"Do you think that their bloodline has, like, been infused with dark magic from practicing card reading for a long time?"
"No one does."
“Why were you with that fat Hufflepuff ghost?”
Malfoy looked at him as if he were mad and promptly rolled his eyes. That was enough of a response. He stepped back from the potion and motioned for him to come closer. The potion was currently a pale lilac color which, according to the textbook, was the correct color.
"And somehow Neville seems to, like, fly through it."
"Potions master. I could curate potions for Healers."
"Exceptions include Squibs but they're born without magic. And other dark magic exceptions, if we are to include the entire spectrum."
She nodded at him, a small smile playing on her lips. "It's archaic magic that most people today do not believe in as it happens to one person every 3, 000 years, something sort of folklore or myth at this point. Yet I am alive to witness it."
“Deal.”
As it so happened, Harry himself was amongst those being dropped which caused a murmur of shocked and surprised whispers across the classroom. He wondered if the reason he was dropped was because of his last experience at the Club. He had been searching more about Voldemort's past which he found out that Professor Slughorn himself had taught Voldemort, rather Tom Riddle, about the Horcruxes. He was curious, that was all, but it probably did not warrant him being uninvited from tonight's party.
"The War is still fresh in some of our minds," Ron argued back.
"Thank you for coming to see me."
Harry thought as he stared. There were pink and white Fizzing Whizzbees, Fudge flies, honey-colored toffees, multicolored Jelly Slugs, No-Melt Ice cream that was Ron's favorites, Pixie Puffs, Cauldron Cakes, peppermint cream that was shaped like the Hogwarts house animals, exploding bonbons, and Harry's favorite, chocolate frogs.
“Precisely what I mean,” Malfoy spat frustrated, but more at himself than Harry. “I can’t find it and those useless portraits in the dungeons won’t assist me. I, also, can’t seem to locate the Bloody Baron.”
"Don't worry about it! I'm just glad to hear another voice other than Pomfrey's. And I did miss you, too. Lots and lots."
There was no way he was going to find his answers by looking at his steaming pasta cook and he opted to think about it later. His pasta was ready in no time and in a large bowl, he mixed his vegetable ingredients and the pasta. He drizzled the Lemon Tahini into the bowl and mixed everything. He later added more spices and a squeeze of more lemon for the taste. He poured himself a healthy amount, already calculating that he would not attend lunch at the Great Hall, and kept the rest in the fridge for dinner.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but the corner of his lip was curved upwards but then instantly turned down. "That day in the Potions when you were constantly asking about the dosage of the Draught, it was because you wanted to know how much to take?"
In one of his insomnia phases, and in desperation, when instead of heading to the Astronomy Tower, he ventured off to the Potions Storeroom which was, strangely, unlocked.  Briefly he wondered since Snape was dead, was that the reason the Storeroom was unlocked? He picked a Crup Sleeping Draught, or three for good measure, and prayed to Merlin this one would do the trick. It was meant for crups, but well, it was under ‘Sleeping Potions’ in the Storeroom so he supposed it would work. The damn elixir never worked.
"But I'm fine, Madam P—"
"I didn't think you'd be interested."
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Sixth Year is much harder than Fifth Year, Potter.”
"If I remember correctly, and I do, she stated that it conjures a magical guardian that is derived from your most positive feelings." His eyes shifted from Harry to the clouds moving lazily across the sky. "It's quite difficult to produce one and many fail to produce a corporeal Patronus Charm. You'll never know its shape until you succeed in conjuring it."
"In the Ravenclaw Wing of the castle. Can you believe the nerve?"
"What?"
"Really?"
“A Hufflepuff aura?” questioned Harry.
Perhaps looking into crystal balls would be something, he lightly mused. For a flash second, he pictured Malfoy rolling his eyes at the suggestion that his future career involved looking deeply into foggy crystal balls.
"… Harry!"
Malfoy looked away, his fingers fidgeting together on his lap. "I may not be the… best of options as a… person but if you were feeling the way you felt I… would have liked to know." His Adam's apple danced on the column of his neck.
"Why?"
“Is that what you did with Salazar’s?”
Hermione always had a plan. You could not formulate a sentence with Hermione and leave out
"Oh. So, is that why you take it?"
"I'm sorry, but are you Edgar Cloggs?"
"That's a myth," said Professor Binns and he clicked his bag closed. "Mrs Binns is making a roast for dinner and I do not want to be late." He looked at the time that appeared in thin air. "Almost 6 o'clock. Good evening, Mr Potter. See you next week for class."
Malfoy raised his glance to her.
), he knew the effects of it after casually asking Malfoy more about it on the pretense of taking more notes for his upcoming essay, and he set an alarm to wake him up for breakfast.
"You ever took Divination before?" he laughed depreciatively.
, that had happened. How could he have forgotten such a basic piece of information?
Harry nodded. "Safely tucked in my trunk."
“Does what hurt?”
"It is," Malfoy responded, diligently stirring clockwise. "He was unaware of the effects of overdosing on the potion as the drinker is meant to have simply between two to four drops, depending on the health of the drinker, but he had much more and he fell into the deathlike sleep until Joan Columbus invented the counterpotion."
"What? How's that possible? Aren't all the founders of Hogwarts hung somewhere in the castle?"
She hummed. "Is that all?"
Harry smirked. Whenever Hermione failed, Blaise was always reliable. "You do forget that we do share Divination."
Malfoy narrowed his eyes. "That's what I just said."
"Why?"
"What books did she write?"
"What's the legend about?"
Minutes to midnight, Harry had drawn the curtains to his bed and clutched the clear liquid in his hands. He needed to take less than five drops (lest he slept for 500 years)(which sounded like a dream if Harry thought about it because he would be
Malfoy wondered if the letter was for Weasley or Granger.
that Slytherin and Gryffindors hate each other."
"Pity," Malfoy said. "But who cares about that fool. Who knows if he will even help with solving the legend? He might as well be useless to our investigations."
“We can trust him.”
Harry's mouth dropped. Belatedly he was trying to remember how many times he had done a Tarot reading to either Luna or Blaise as a joke. Far too many for his liking.
"It's not that kind of situation. There is no debate on whether one is right or wrong, there is simply no such phrase as 'wonders do cease.'"
What was stranger was that he found himself not at all creeped out by Malfoy's presence nor by his conversation. It was an odd thing to talk about their favorite subjects, about their grades but it beat having conversations about one's future which he sure did not think he would have.
"All done," Ron said, happily.
"That's not an insult."
Waiting for the pasta water to boil, he briefly wondered how he was going to get Godric's portrait to speak. Or rather, move.
"I told her I'd think about it," Harry interrupted their bickering. They both turned to look at him, Ron's eyes narrowed at him. "I do love her, don't get me wrong, but not, like, you know, romantically. I see her almost like a sister. Like, how Hermione and I would never date."
"You just did."
Harry for some reason was not reassured. "Did—did I cause it? Like, did I kill—Oh, Merlin!"
"Professor Binns is a downright bore. I'd exchange him for Trelawney in a heartbeat."
"As a matron, you often see a lot of interactions that go on in the hospital, not just here at Hogwarts but at St. Mungo's and Albus would often bring a friend of his who was constantly injured. Do you know of Gellert?"
Malfoy narrowed his eyes for the briefest of moments before simply answering, "Lovegood."
Harry nodded, not ready but his blood was making him nervous and excited for what was to come. He watched Malfoy remove his wand from his inner robes, raise it to the ceiling and murmur something in French… or Latin, Harry was not particularly sure, all the while his wand moving in a precise and intricate triskaidecagon shape.
How they got on the topic of school subjects Malfoy could not begin to comprehend but here they were and Malfoy was making it his personal mission to get Potter to forget about the letter he was drafting in his hand. His heavy, heavy letter that seemed to be much more than simply a summary of his start to Eighth Year.
“What aura?”
the poem in the chapter is from John Donne's poem: holy sonnets: death, be not proud.
Harry stuffed his mouth his glazed carrots and chewed silently.
Malfoy shrugged one shoulder to which Harry found it to be such a
“I don’t understand, where is he?”
"No Sir, you're not."
"You two were… magnetic," she said, her eyes on the medieval mosaic painting above Harry's bed. "Always dancing around each other, circling one another like the moon—"
"I don't know how you could stomach long dull periods of History of Magic and yet…"
"What's so funny?"
Malfoy never saw it that way, if he was being honest. He supposed being taught by a ghost that died in the 1920s was somewhat of a wonder but as Potter said, it was only because he grew up in the wizarding world and already knew what Professor Binns taught. Most probably had the entire curriculum drilled into his brain long before the Hogwarts letter arrived by owl.
“While education might not be of importance to you,” Malfoy grinded his teeth, “some of us need to have EE or above as part of our probation orders.”
Before Harry could reply there was a loud chatter of cheers and they both looked up to find Hermione bouncing on her heels. Looking closely, Harry saw a bright green cabbage perched on her table.
“Ginny!” Harry chastised.
"Serenity."
"You could say that."
They fell into a lull of silence, each studying their respective subjects, and not even an hour in, Harry found himself daydreaming. First, it was the Slug Club supper party, wondering what Professor Slughorn had planned, then to the general idea of Horcruxes and briefly wondering who taught Professor Slughorn himself – was it Dumbledore that taught him? Or had he done his own research? Then his mind settled on the myth of Godric and Salazar. Did Fat Friar tell him everything he knew or was he hiding some information from him? If he did then Harry would have an incredibly long list of people to ask about the legend, and he suspected half the list would include the dead for their had more knowledge than the living.
"If you and Harry were friends, Malfoy, he would've visited you in hospital in First Year."
"The dead deserve to rest in peace, don't they? Imagine after all these hundreds and hundreds of years, neither Salazar nor Godric have found any rest because neither of their wishes was fulfilled. And their history erased from history books because someone along the line deemed Salazar unworthy to be mentioned nor respected Godric's wishes because of Salazar's history."
“Snake?”
Watching his girlfriend partner off with Luna, he groaned, "Mate, we don't have many people left."
Harry snapped his head to the Welsh voice of none other than Madam Pomfrey. Immediately he looked around: the lime green curtains separating the beds hang back revealing metal beds covered in thin white sheets, the stained-glass windows painted with past Healers in Hogwarts history, and of course the notable smell of hospital potions that he often found nauseating. However, today there was a distinct smell of peaches if he was not mistaken.
"Wonderful. You get an O in Potions," Malfoy quipped dryly.
He laid the ingredients on the table and was mildly surprised to find the equipment neatly and sharply organized before Malfoy.
"He believes I poisoned you, just like the rest of the school."
Fat Friar smiled joyfully. “Why, it’s on the 10
"I heard that Godric had requested to be buried with his best friend but, like, that never happened."
Professor Binns stopped his packing and looked up at his Eighth Year student. "Relationships have no business in history books, Mr Potter. Their impact and work towards the building of our school has bigger importance, wouldn't you agree?"
As soon as Professor Binns began his revision on the Soap Blizzard of the 14th Century in 1378, the classroom dozed off, even his deskmate Ernie Macmillan was already snoring away. Harry, with a renewed interest in wizarding world history from Sixth Year, listened on closely. Sadly, he was alone in this class as his friends, literally, everyone in Gryffindor, had dropped the class and they all wondered why Harry kept the subject. Even Hermione asked him one day and she was the only one who ever stayed awake during Professor Binns' monotonous droning on magical history.
"If not an Auror, then what would you like to do?"
She smiled sadly at him. “I have taken the liberty of acquiring a Mind Healer for you and you are scheduled to meet them next week Friday after dinner.”
"What? I am terrible at this."
Harry chuckled lightly. "I didn't grow up in your world, the wizarding world so it's very interesting to me. Plus, it's taught by a ghost, like, how cool is that?"
"Hi Harry," Hermione greeted, her voice unsure.
"Agree to disagree," he said, smiling at Malfoy working himself at correcting Harry's phrase instead of admitting he did not know. Harry would have liked to bet every last galleon in his bank that the one thing anyone could count on Malfoy doing was having answers to nearly everything under the sun and it jolted him a bit when he admitted 'I don't know.' The same went for Hermione who rarely ever uttered the phrase.
"Of course I am. Why would I not be?"
Harry held his gaze, deep green eyes boring into deep silver ones. "Remus is the one who taught me in, like, the Third Year. He said I needed to concentrate on a very happy memory."
"This is where the legend gets hazy and vague," Malfoy said. "One, there is little to no accounts of where Salazar has been buried – only that he has been buried somewhere in Slytherin dungeons. Two, while everyone does believe that Salazar did purge Muggleborns in the Chamber of Secrets there are tales that it was not Salazar but someone else who killed Muggleborns." Harry gasped loudly. "Third, according to several accounts, back in the day the Bloody Baron was heard saying that Godric and Salazar were never buried together and that the ghosts of the two founding fathers forever roam the Hogwarts corridors looking for each other."
He swallowed thickly before stating, “I am sorry that I did not—” She raised her hand to stop his speech of what he thought she wanted to hear.
"Is Zabini's mom really a voodoo doll?" asked Neville.
"At least?"
"Lisa Turpin?" Hermione suggested.
Harry nodded and reached out to grab a Pomfret cake. He took a bite, having never tasted it before, and the taste of licorice flooded his mouth.
Apprenticeship routinely began in Fifth Year where students were to choose a profession they wanted to pursue upon graduation from Hogwarts. Students are given counseling and attend workshops at that time so that they may make informed decisions in regards to their NEWT subjects that are to be selected in the following year.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows at him as his mouth fell. He quickly schooled his expression remembering that gaping was very
Her bushy hair bounced to match her enthusiasm. "Of course! When I was in Second Year, I stumbled upon the charm during my extra reading for Professor Flitwick and it said that magic can sustain one's needs that one won't need to do activities such as sleep or eat. However, while the magic sustains you, it also slowly kills you. A bit of an incongruity."
Harry gawked at Malfoy in disbelief. "That's horrible!"
Malfoy bit down on his tongue, feeling his anger seeping into his words. He was not angry per se at the prospect of Godric and Salazar but at his mother never having a moment to say goodbye to her husband.
Harry turned and found Blaise looking at him curiously with a bemused smirk playing on his lips. Harry swallowed. How did this even happen? He was meant to partner up with Malfoy, not Blaise of all people. He already saw him enough in Divination. Why did his hands have to cramp up and point to the closest Slytherin?
he would swallow, look away, talk to someone nearby, or deliberately change the topic by asking her about her Apprenticeship which she was too eager to talk about. In a lengthy conversation that lasted over an hour, he learned she was going to work in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and thereafter become the Minister of Magic through a thoroughly detailed and itemized six-year plan.
He begrudgingly cracked open his Divination textbook to page 368. They were currently learning Cartomancy which was the art of reading cards for insights into future events and for his essay assignment he had to write advantages on using tarot cards over normal cards. While his first experience with Divination was quite something, he grew to love the subject as during his Sixth and Seventh year he discovered that half the cryptic phrases and statements that Trelawney would often mutter to him in a sort of dazed possessed manner came to pass.
"Speaking of, did you find Salazar?"
"What do you mean?" Harry inquired after Hermione's sudden gasp.
Fat Friar nodded eagerly, his joyful demeanor something that Harry was increasingly aware was his default.
Malfoy was struck by the sincerity in Harry's eyes, the voice laced with desperation and despair but whatever was on the surface he knew there was a monster of
"C'mon Potter, we've got a list to write," Malfoy said, dryly. He picked up his bag and moved to the back of the classroom and Harry followed suit.
“Of course, he did. An Animagus in the form of a lion is quite difficult to achieve but alas, as it is Gryffindor himself, it is not so hard to imagine. He was the best of the best, son.”
Professor Slughorn immediately brightened up and clapped his hands four times. He spun around and as he heads to the front of the class, he announced, "Harry, my boy, has reminded me that I have an announcement to make." He stood tall and strong and proud at the front of the classroom. "To bring about the theme of inter-house unity, with full backing from Headmistress McGonagall, I have revived my prestigious Slug Club from the ashes and we shall have our meeting next Friday evening – in exactly nine days."
Hermione did not seem perturbed that Malfoy was on the same train thought as she. She looked pleased, almost proud at the fact. "What happened in 1368?"
"How's it an imbalance?"
"Why didn't he… ever mention it?"
? And how long had it been missing for? Surely, if it were really missing Hogwarts would have known? Or rather Dumbledore or even Headmistress McGonagall? And surely it would be odd that there was no commotion regarding its disappearance, regardless of how the Slytherin House was perceived?
"You're going to research what happened in Hogwarts for a whole 12 months?"
"You'll take over from here."
"Not exactly," Harry mumbled.
"What does the Almighty Draco Lucius Malfoy want to do then?"
Harry chuckled to himself. Of course, Malfoy failed in Muggle Studies, duh. Of course, he failed the one subject that involved non-wizarding persons because growing up as a Pureblood seemed to be in one's DNA to despite those who
Blaise dramatically touched his chest and tilted his head. "My heart cracks every time I walk into Divination and you're not there."
"Apparently there is a big DADA exam today and everyone was studying for it so my other visitors were not available."
Harry chuckled to himself, choosing not to comment. While it was true that Professor Slughorn was at times worse than Snape when it came to teaching Potions, he still preferred Slughorn despite his small (read: big) fascination with him just because he was, you know,
"I don't know."
"Better not, mate," Ron warned not unkind.
"Just like History of Magic but without the long, dull lectures."
Hermione hummed. "That's the question, isn't it? And also, who is on Godric's portrait in Headmistress McGonagall's office?"
Harry was not feeling lucky. "Not so much, I feel like I've ruined his life."
"Did he speak to you?"
"Hear, hear," Harry mumbled in agreement and gave his best friend a fist bump.
"You were friends, that's enough of a reason."
"After 11 o'clock in my office, you call me Poppy, no need for the Madam."
Malfoy nodded. "I did call our mission
"And Granger."
"Yeah, working on it with you is, like, really cool and I enjoy it."
"I can confidently say that I mastered the
“We are much more than our House, are we not?” questioned Luna, her voice as light as a cloud.
"What happened to them?"
"McGonagall has seen it as well as your assigned Mind Healer."
Malfoy was visibly surprised by Harry remembering a tiny detail he had told him about a week ago. "I can try," he said after a moment, "but Goshawk said it has to be positive. Nothing but positive."
"I honestly doubt it. Patronus Charms are not known of their origin or creation and were only discovered way after Hogwarts was founded. I doubt either of the founders of Hogwarts had knowledge about it or could even fathom such a thing."
"His entire life he was obsessed with Helena and winning her love I don't think he had a clue about Salazar or Godric's mysterious ending."
A collective groan was echoed in the class save from Hermione writing everything down on her parchment that Professor Slughorn was instructing.
enjoooooooy this one x
They each shared a grateful smile, a laugh here and there. Harry reached over to help himself to more candy as Hermione took the last bite of her toffee she had taken earlier.
"Deepest desire should not be confused with one's future, those two are different concepts," Hermione answered. "They appear to come true because your own magic was infused with the Tarot readings."
"Are you going to explain what this is about?" Malfoy asked, showing no signs of moving whereas Harry was looking increasingly like he was about to yank Malfoy up by his robes and drag him to the Charms classroom.
"There's an ancient story about Raczidian who attempted to cast a Patronus but instead of, you know, casting one, he was eaten alive by maggots that shot out of his wand."
"What? There is Godric in McGonagall's office?"
Malfoy hummed. "Sounds like Shakespeare."
"You were as red as a tomato."
"I was agreeing with you!"
“Blue.”
The following day in their Transfiguration double lesson, Harry relayed the same information to Malfoy (after hassling to be his class partner before Parkinson could get a word in).
“No.”
In a jiffy, she was back, a floating silver tray of cups, teapot, and cakes following behind her. A silvery tray popped out of thin near Harry's head and the teapot began pouring tea into the white porcelain cup. He was never tired of magic, him. It always seemed to amaze him, even eight years after.
He, offhandedly, wondered if he and Malfoy were friends?
And now Ginny was picking it up again.
He was alerted to the time by the sounds of his roommates waking up and he groaned into his pillow. Another night where he barely caught a wink of sleep. He got ready in the blink of an eye something that was eerily starting to lightly scare him at how moments would pass away without his knowledge, as if somebody was controlling his life.
"I see staying in the hospital has made your cognitive processing slower than usual."
Ginny nodded. “Lunch?”
In a moment of surprise and shock, Malfoy saw Harry fold up his paper and pocket it, along with his pen. He turned to Malfoy and cocked his head, waiting for his answer.
Professor Slughorn clapped his hands together thrice and his grin widened. "Today's an electrifying day, my students, for we shall be brewing a wonderful, absolutely wonderful, Potion today. The powerful Draught of the Living Death! As you all know it is a very strong sleeping potion – the most powerful some may argue." He winked at the class. "It can be made…"
Madam Pomfrey sighed, looking on at Malfoy and remembering when he was a little boy in First Year, came running into the Hospital Wing after a paper cut, swearing up and down that his father was going to hear about this. What she remembered was Malfoy's friends did not visit him, not once were they around. No one came.
"I didn't think you'd agree."
Harry turned to her in surprise. "What? Really?"
"So, I would've died in the end," Harry said, concluding for himself. It was funny, after everything he had been through, how many times he had come close to death (apart from that time in the forest) and always evaded it. He came so close to death, started wishing for death, and now,
“Nothing in the history books jumped out when I read on it last night. It was a day like any other.”
"I will. Just…" He let out a long-suffering sigh. "I will. Don't worry."
"That's because you're only three in the class," Hermione pointed out. "Luna is, well,
, he had the feeling that Godric had been ignoring everyone for hundreds of years. He knew for sure that Dumbledore must have tried his luck in getting the lion to speak, let alone
"You can see the whole world from here," said Malfoy conversationally. He ignored the gnawing voice chiding him for sharing with Potter. "The stars will always have a home for you, Mother always said."
"In Fourth Year when I went home for Christmas, Mother and I would spend a lot of time looking up at the stars. She would narrate to me of Canis Major, her personal favorite, or even Cygnus who was Aquila, a little bit about the history Castor and Pollux and now, every time I look up at the stars, I find…"
"True, but learning about runic scripts is much more fun than, say, the First Goblin Rebellion of 1612."
Malfoy's eyes nearly dropped out of his sockets. "Poor? Poor, Potter? When did you ever get a P?"
"Her hair is too long."
talk to Ginny."
Harry smiled at Ron. "She's not that bad when you get to know her. You know she gives us a cup of tea and biscuits before we begin class."
"And Professor Slughorn required us to have already begun reading about Undetectable Poisons."
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii this is my first drarry fic and i kind wanted to play with the history of the OG characters & ran with this idea lol.
this is long overdue -- i am sorry for that. i hit a writer's block with this and to get my block out of the way i normally (easily) write for some other fandom which then i am able to write freely for this one. so hopefully it works out
Now? He had no idea.
---where? Where was he to find a Pureblood? Where would one find a room full of Purebloods? Why, the Great Hall! No matter what time of day it was, there were always students and teachers around in there.
"You grew up in this wizarding world, better yet you're a Pureblood, so everything that's being taught it's, like, ingrained in you."
"Stalking me again?" he asked as he sat down about a meter or two away from the boy.
Harry groaned. "I liked the class before. Oh, by the way, is no one talking about the pink carnation or how Professor Binns passed through The Veil?"
“But you, like, got an O in Transfiguration.”
but Malfoy is onto something. However, it's interesting about Godric's portrait."
Malfoy looked affronted but remained quiet.
The eyes of a man whose soul had vanished. He knew those eyes, he had seen them in his Father before he was shipped off to Azkaban.
Harry Potter, defeated Lord Voldemort, he was pretty sure he could complete a simple task such as asking Malfoy to be his partner.
In all of Harry's years in Potions classes, he had never come across this particular Potion nor heard of it until today. "Do you know how to brew it?"
Harry listened intently, hoping that his name (and Malfoy's) would be called. He was the third student to be formally invited to Friday's supper party, Hermione was the fourth, Luna was the eighth, and Malfoy and Nott were the 11th and 12th respectively.
He shook his head. Of course not. That was absurd! Malfoy himself would rather curse himself into oblivion than consider him a friend to Harry.
“I am very much aware that you skipped our very important meeting regarding your Apprenticeship,” she said, her tone sharp yet somehow also warm. “While these meetings are not compulsory, as not every career requires an Apprenticeship nor NEWTS, some of these are very much helpful and it would be foolish to let the opportunity pass.
"Anything for Godric, right?" he teased. And in a way for Salazar for Harry was once almost in his House but he was not about to confess that detail to Malfoy.
"What's that?" he asked, curiously.
"Harry," she began, her voice not in the harsh Matron voice, but a kind, motherly tone, "I am going to be very frank with you as you will have a lot of questions henceforth, are you ready?"
"He was one of the four founding fathers of Hogwarts?" he answered him, phrasing it as a question. Malfoy made no comment about it.
floor. “I’ve been dead for so long I don’t think I can safely say I miss it. I don’t remember the feeling of sun on my skin, or the rain on my face.”
He had never heard of a perfect textbook explanation of how to cast a Patronus but was grateful for receiving Remus' instructions as they were, well, less wordy. "She's right. Don't you know anyone who learned the Charm?"
, as Purebloods often held.
"… we spoke French as well."
Or a late-night snack seeing as he spent the nights wide awake.
Malfoy stared blankly at him then promptly changed the subject, deeming Divination not a topic to be discussed deeply, or at all. "Madam Pomfrey told me you're getting out in two days."
"That's what Millicent told Hannah."
"Out with it Mr Potter."
as amy from brooklyn nine-nine famously said that latin is just taking a long nap and is not a dead language. the title loosely translates to: legends of history
“You’re mad.”
She smiled sagely at him. "You had asked if it was okay to be friends with people you're not friends with. This was it." She sipped her tea. "They loved each other very much, despite being on opposing sides, and earlier on they had signed a blood pact to never fight each other."
"Ron," Hermione cried exasperated. "The War is done and over with. We're not there anymore. Besides, McGonagall advocated for inter-House unity this year and that is precisely why Slughorn has asked as to pair up with someone from another House."
"What about all the spells and potions? Those do some healing."
"Of course!"
"Nothing, nothing."
"Speaking of Malfoy, there have been a lot of rumors surrounding him and your poisoning."
"Has anyone visited you, Harry?"
"Slug Club," he answered as if it was the most obvious answer.
"I feel like I'm standing in the middle of Honeydukes!"
"Have you ever had a friend that you, like, knew you couldn't be friends with?"
Harry rubbed his face with his hands. They were currently in the Common Room, the Golden Trio working on their Charms essay together, rather Hermione intensively researching on nonverbal spells while Harry pondered on his upcoming meeting with his Mind Healer and Ron munched happily on chocolate frogs – gifts for all three of them from George Weasley that Ron was quickly munching away.
"They put you to sleep."
"Is it safe?" he asked Malfoy.
Harry gave him a side glance then turned back to his Potion, biting his lips from smiling too much. He followed the new instructions from Malfoy and it was about the fourth cycle that the potion changed its color from a lilac color to clear. Harry's jaw dropped in surprise.
“Fat Friar, like, did not notice that Godric’s tail moved. He truly believed that Godric was sleep.”
"How are you feeling?"
"Well, sometimes stars do appear during the day but mostly they're better appreciated during the night."
Harry faltered, "Uhhh… I think it's avocadoes." He enjoyed his chocolate frogs as Blaise and Luna buzzed about The Force. Sometimes he wondered if he was secretly bonkers based on their conversations, and also the conversations the three of them had in Divination but then he supposed why would he think so? Divination was not a crazy of a subject as everyone thought – damned be Hermione and Malfoy.
Harry swallowed, not having missed the strain in Malfoy's voice. He breathed out and got to the matter at hand. "Did anyone else?"
Harry helped himself to a chocolate frog. "I can't. I have to stay here for, like, a week extra."
"What? Why?"
"I'm eating, Potter."
"Curious, isn't it? Folklore tradition never dictated for anyone to tell spirits they're dead because it was always assumed they knew – which frankly they do. Nobody knew how to go about with rare examples like Professor Binns and it was assumed we would all wait until he found it out himself."
"Did I miss anything in Potions?"
, not how, Godric chooses to stay in his Animagus form.”
Malfoy looked away again, gazing up at the effervescent stars. "How'd you manage to cast a Patronus?"
His eyes drifted and slowly blinked diagonally to his left where Malfoy's Potions partner was Pansy Parkinson.
Draco Malfoy's mother always told him to observe closely at those who stood on the edge.
He dropped his bag to the floor, pulled out a seat, and slumped down on it. In comparison, Malfoy gracefully sat down on the stool, his back as straight as a ruler for Malfoys always had great posture, regardless.
"You're always hungry, Ronald," Hermione chided. "It's a wonder where all your food goes."
Harry started. The portrait was empty! There was no one in the portrait. There was, however, a painting of a lion that presumably was sleeping – it was hard to tell – in a field of green grass with the sun shining in the upper left corner of the frame. Below the portrait it was written:
Both Harry and Ginny looked down at the table and indeed there were plates and plates of duck. Watching the hot steam evaporate from the juicy meat, his stomach growled and immediately dug in.
In no time, there were to begin the brewing process. Malfoy had slid the list of ingredients and pointed sharply towards the Potions cupboard and he marched off without another word. It was a known fact that Malfoy was superior in Potions, not just to Harry but in their year if not the whole school, as he always achieved straight Os since First Year whereas Hermione was sometimes received an EE and Harry? That was a different story.
Hearing all of that sucked Harry's joy out of his body like a Dementor's Kiss and what was worse was that Harry was positive he had almost, if not more, assignments as Ron and he barely had begun any of them.
"Sorry about all that," he sheepishly apologized. "That was embarrassing."
"Good," Malfoy echoed in agreement. "You think Slughorn has knowledge about the legend?"
"It is a
"Acceptable. Muggle Studies."
“There’s a reason she was called Loony Luna.”
"Ron and I aren't really talking," he found himself sharing. "And I figured you'd know more about the traditional folklore than Ron would. Also, I don't think I'll ever understand just how rare this is but maybe one day."
Harry frowned. But why would Fat Friar not believe that Salazar was capable of murdering Muggleborns? Harry knew as well as anyone that truth, more often than not, was stranger than fiction and therefore believed Salazar, to some extent, did murder Muggleborns and somebody somewhere was upset. Very upset. So upset that something horrible happened to him.
"And each time the pineapples shall be there to mend your broken heart," added Luna.
Harry tightened his grip on his wand. "What you looking at stars for at this late hour?"
"What does that have to do with wizarding history?"
Malfoy stared at him as if he were a child who should know better. "It's Latin, Potter."
"So… so far Fat Friar is our only hope for finding out what happened during that time."
"Ah, Sir Nicholas, it's been a minute."
"Uhh…" he stuttered having not heard the end of her sentence. "I already have a partner." And unwillingly his finger pointed to a Slytherin who was to his immediate left.
Harry jolted and sprung to his feet. A shiny orange marble rolled on the ground and stopped before his black shoes. He whipped out his wand and pointed it between Malfoy's eyes, 12 curses on the tip of his tongue all varying degrees of bone-crushing capabilities.
Harry turned back and, for the second time in the night, looked up at the night skies. It was full of bright stars, blinking happily and a full moon that reminding him of Lupin. He smiled small at the sight of the moonlight, smiled at the sight of the stars. For the second time since his arrival at Hogwarts, he did not look down at the grass but kept his eyes up at the starry night.
"Come off it, Malfoy. You expect me to believe that?"
Harry briefly wondered how Luna would know it's a tough one but he supposed he would blame the Wrackspurts.
"We both wanted to see you! Madam Pomfrey met us at the door and explained the visitation system," she answered and was very intrigued by the system itself for a full 17 minutes. Harry did not interrupt her, having missed her enthusiasm for knowledge and all things Hermione. "I'm sorry! I've been rambling and haven't asked a thing about you. It's just that—"
Harry swallowed. The heavy topic of Horcruxes was a lot to explain to Hermione and Ron at the time, and now explaining it do Malfoy would be heavier as he had to explain what Hermione and Ron already knew and a whole lot of Voldemort, too.
He was constantly dreading the night time for it was when his body would normally go to sleep but his decidedly did not. At first, he dreaded the moment he headed off to the Gryffindor towers to call it a night because that was when his nightmares would flare up. Madam Pomfrey had kindly provided him with numerous bottles of the Dreamless Sleep Potion which had worked wonderfully as he had stopped having nightmares.
Harry stared down at the folded letter in his hand. His grip tightened around the letter, the words flooding his mind without needing to read what he had written that night in the Astronomy Tower.
"Very Slytherin of Godric if you ask me."
“Lion?”
knew that. If he told Ron or Dean, or even Ernie, they would not know. "I'll do my research and find out what happened in Hogwarts during that year."
"Not to the Wizarding world."
"You already did."
Harry blinked and Professor Slughorn's voice was nothing but an echo. He was never good in Potions, the class requiring precise turnings and timings, and the only time he ever did achieve a decent EE grade was in Sixth Year – the one time he came third in class much to everyone's surprise and to the disdain of his professor. First in class was always Malfoy, no matter how good his best friend was in the class, Malfoy seemed to have a flair for the subject. He never broke a sweat even when Snape threatened anyone who did not get an O would not advance to Sixth Year Potions.
"Can you guys do me a favor?"
Harry frowned. “What do you mean?”
"You-you know about that?"
Harry took his cue to leave, not wanting to remain in the awkward presence of Ron, not bothering to take a chocolate frog or two for himself, and headed off to the Room of Requirement for an impromptu cooking session. On his walk to the Room, he decided he was going to make the delicious Broccoli Tahini Pasta Salad which was simple enough as he simply had to boil the vegetables, pasta, and make the Lemon Tahini dressing salad, and
," he said, quoting his letter.
He looked startled, perhaps at being called out or simply being summoned by her. He slowly rose from his table, picking his bags from the floor, and followed the Matron out of the Hall and down the corridor where they were few students lurking about.
"Yep," he said, going with the flow. "Inter-house unity and all that jazz."
This was partially true as before the arrival of his Hogwarts letter he had been taught by a private tutor, under the strict supervision of his father, of the history of Pureblood – which did include a lot about History of Magic in its generality.
"I was looking for Slytherin Prince during that time. My mind was occupied"
“No.”
Harry leaned closer to Malfoy. “But the important thing is, like, why is he always in his lion form? Like, I thought there was a time limit on that or something?”
You know he was desperate when he was taking sleeping potions for dogs!
Ginny snapped her head to her, momentarily forgetting that Luna was also on their table. “Why’s that Luna?”
Malfoy sighed contentedly, leaning back against the stone wall of the Astronomy Tower, his eyes lazily looking over at the blinking stars above them. "To be honest, I don't know either but only because there's not much about him anywhere."
"She studies for it. Neville has a natural gift for it. Won't be surprised that he wants to do something in the field."
Harry cursed under his breath and dropped his wand. "Can't deal with this bullshit right now."
"Missing me too much are we Blaise?"
"Purebloods, or simply anyone really, spend a large insane amount of time on their readings, on holding onto their dreams so much that it becomes unhealthy because you cling onto empty wishes that were interpreted from a stupid card."
"Purebloods have the power to chant an incantation for the dead to pass successfully beyond The Veil without being stuck in the middle. However, even with an incantation done he has to be willing to leave which he has not done since 1966." He narrowed his eyes at Harry. "You might have disrupted that."
century to the 10
Malfoy made a swish-swish movement with his wand and asked what he had been meaning to say earlier. Harry frowned at the obvious change in subject but he was too excited to share the news with him to comment further.
Harry let out a frustrated groan. "Stop assuming, Malfoy."
"It wasn't my fault!" he yelled at her, frustration bubbling somewhere in the middle of his chest. "I promise you I did not overdose on the bloody Potion! All I wanted, Madam Pomfrey, all I ever wanted was simply to go to bed and
“We’re having duck for lunch.”
"How's that possible?"
"He doesn't know, does he?"

Parmesan cheese. He added Parmesan cheese to everything it was honestly a crime that they did not have the product here in Hogwarts.
“I thought it was on the seventh floor?”
Hermione briefly smiled at him, squeezing his arm in affection, Harry imitating the gesture and then breathed out. "What happened, Harry? There're lots of rumors flying around the school but I want to know from you. Did you really overdose?"
Ron snorted. "Not a chance, mate. Don't want to risk it."
"I could eat a cow right about now!" Ron moaned happily, in between bites of sausage and muffins.
"I've never heard of this Racdian." It was true, not once had his name appeared in any books on the syllabus, not even in
"Yes. This potion can be used in St Mungo's even."
"Why, he was buried on Hogwarts grounds, along with the other three founders of our school as is indicated on page 971 in

"It happens, sometimes, with the dead when they are afraid to go to the other side of The Veil. They remain on this side, with the living, because they cannot part," he explained.
"This rarely happens," said Malfoy, making a right turn and jogging down the corridor. "Usually a wizard or witch will go their entire life without performing The Veil ritual as it seldom transpires. Rumor has it that some choose to come to Hogwarts simply because of Professor Binns." He came to the 4F classroom and pushed open the door. "To simply witness him understanding that he is dead and then perform the ritual."
"He's innocent now."
briefly looking down at the contents of the page. Why he still took Divination was beyond him and blinked once more at the page.
"Maybe try a different angle like the location of Salazar's grave. I found out that Godric was buried right here in Hogwarts."
"Sure, Harry, what is it?" asked Neville.
This time Harry responded to her silent questions. "I did. For, like, the Potions assignment we got that class."
Malfoy raised both eyebrows quizzingly. "Why would you not attend?" Then before Harry could respond, he answered his question with an eye roll, "I presume the great Saviour wants to continue saving lives."
"I understand, Harry. The War was a difficult time for anyone and if you felt differently about Ginny as an effect of it, it is okay. What is not okay is to keep her waiting."
"My oranges?"
"Thank you for the tea, Madam Pomfrey," he said after taking a tentative sip of the hot drink.
“It’s your choice, Harry.”
Well, not exactly controlling him, he had 17 years of that happening thank you very much, but controlling in the sense that his body simply took over and he was on autopilot. That type of controlling.
He bumped into Fat Friary on the third floor of the castle.
Harry sheepishly shrugged and Malfoy rolled his eyes at him. He picked up a vial to add the potion into it for examination by the professor.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Why do you want to know?"
He went about gathering his ingredients for his veggie lasagna in the pantry to his far left, the vegetables, marinara sauce, lasagna noodles, and, oh sweet Merlin, do not forget the ricotta
well well well.... the plot t h i c c e n s ...
"Like Nearly Headless Nick," said Harry, patting himself on the back though another part of him should have known the other House ghosts not simply that of his own House.
"That's impressive, Malfoy. And you're the best in Potions so it's no surprise."
"Pureblood tradition folklore dictates that a wizard, or a witch, does not consider death the end of life but the next big adventure. To get to the next adventure, one would conquer death through dying."
"He knew a lot about Horcruxes."
A comfortable blanket of silence enveloped them. Harry was eating his candy stash from Blaise and Luna, already finishing his lasts of Jelly Slugs. Hermione, not keen on munching massive chunks of candy (dentist parents will do that to a person), took a liking to honey-colored toffees.
"Stop pestering him, Mione," Ron chipped in with his mouth full. "I'm sure we basically got the same talk from McGonagall about Auror Apprenticeship."
"Why? Seems odd for him to be there."
Malfoy rolled his eyes as he sat down on the chair beside his bed. "With a little persuasion, I must admit. Since when do you talk to Blaise so freely?"
"I also have nightmares," Hermione told him, her voice low as if admitting the fact out loud for the first time.
"Hello?" he asked after a tentative knock on her door.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes but pressed no further. Instead, he asked, "What's your highest grade in a subject apart from DADA?"
There are some inaccuracies in the storyline/timeline with the books but for plot's sake (wink wink), let is slide. though it should come as no surprise i have timeline inaccuracies as im free flowing teehee [;
Malfoy was onto something, it seemed. He had doubted him, wondering if Malfoy was going a little crazy after everything that had happened to him since Sixth Year and was only humoring him. However, with his conversation with Fat Friar and a comment about Salazar's relationship with the other founders of Hogwarts during History of Magic class yesterday, Harry was growingly interested in finding out more. It would give him something to focus on, something to distract him from, well, his life.
(See the end of the chapter for
"There's only so much that a potion can do. Only so much rest and restoring of bones can do but love is the ultimate."
"I read," Ron chipped in, "that the cards possess you like how Voldy possessed Ginny in Second Year."
"There's a legend?"
"I couldn't get a word in. He was marching up and down the corridors without stopping, muttering something about needing to find Helena's diadem to give back to her as an apology."
Harry briefly smiled at his two best friends, swirling his fork on his copper-colored plate with a modest serving of his breakfast. He took a bite of his crunchy toast, his best friend's bickering about Ron's ever-growing appetite in the back of his mind. Like a magnet, his eyes looked across the Great Hall, passed the Ravenclaw table to the Slytherin table and down towards a certain platinum blond Slytherin. He was looking intensely at whatever Blaise Zabini was saying and a small part of Harry wondered what Zabini was commenting that had caught Malfoy's full attention.
“I’ve been thinking about a lot of things,” Ginny said, “and those things happen to include you.”
"But what if Slughorn knows a lot more than he is letting on?"
"It could've been the apples, sweet Luna," Blaise said, his eyes glistening under the afternoon sunlight. "Apples are in season right now therefore the oranges cannot be holding Harry's sleep hostage."
"What are, like, the long-term effects of using Cartomancy for long?"
Madam Pomfrey smiled ruefully. "They were more than brothers, dear Harry. They were lovers."
"Even when you come back, I don't think we'll go back to being Potions partners."
He added the fusilli to his boiling water, reduced the fire, and sat back, waiting for it to be ready.
“Butterbeer?”
"Is it?" questioned Hermione. "It's the same logic as Tarot cards. Both are ridiculous for sure."
Malfoy snorted. "That stupid, good-for-nothing narcissistical Professor Lockha—"
to her.
"And death shall be no more, Death thou shalt die."
Harry frowned at her in confusion then turned back to Blaise. "I'm pretty sure Trelawney is happy to have a break from someone who can't read tarot cards."
“Why, there he is.” He pointed to the lion in the portrait.
"Ron and I talk to each other which has massively helped me," she answered, not chastising him for the topic change. "The one thing I noticed about the wizarding world is they don't talk about things, instead rely heavily on magic to solve their woes. But they often forget that magic exists because people exist as well, you can't have one without the other." She paused, smiled over at Harry. "You've got people to talk to, Harry, including me."
According to Fat Friar, the first person on that list should be the Bloody Baron. The man was known for his temper and the only one that Peeves was scared of which was something, for sure. According to what Helena Ravenclaw told him the Bloody Baron had furiously killed her because of her refusal to marry her and realizing his own mistake, he killed himself hence the constant stain of blood on his ghostly attire.
"That… that can't be. I am alive! I am alive!" he screamed facing the heavens. "I am not dead. I will never die. I was promised to teach for the rest of my life."
"We're in!" Harry grinned leaning his body towards Malfoy. The blond man rolled his eyes but the corners of his mouth were twitching.
"What does that mean?"
"Because he does not want to should be reason enough."
him. The War had a way of dampening any romantic mood which was a huge wet blanket on their relationship and at some point, Harry felt as if he was in it just because. They had not quite broken up but they also were not quite dating.
"How'd it go?"
"Hey Luna, how are you?"
"But their falling out did play a great significance, did it not? That's why there are, like, House prejudices between Gryffindor and Slytherin
"Last week I did find Godric's portrait but it did not move," said Malfoy. "I talked to it, tried a few nonverbal spells that were within reason but nothing happened. I do believe that the portrait responds to either only you or Gryffindors."
Ron pursed his lips, letting the information simmer for a bit. "All well and true but the Mirror and Tarot cards do say the truth, to some extent."
His first guests, a rather big surprise to him, were Blaise and Luna. They had come in bearing large flowers of various forms of roses, a bag or two full of candy, several editions of The Quibbler, and a golden goblet so large in between Blaise's hands that Luna swore would get rid of the remaining Wrackspurts floating around Harry's head. He placed the giant goblet by Harry's bedside table.
"Is that why you do Arithmancy?"
"I just said okay."
Hermione rolled her eyes and returned to her thick essay. Ron, on the other hand, shook his head. "Absolutely not, mate. Interfering with tarot cards can mess with your magic."
"As much as this is delightful, some of us are trying to eat in peace," Bulstrode said, glaring at Harry.
"There's a lot to magic you know."
"You don't know?" Harry smiled, amused. "The great Draco Malfoy does not know? Oh, wonders do cease."
but perhaps he would ask Professor Binns – or Hermione really, his personal walking fountain of knowledge.
Hermione noticed, he knew that she knew something was off about him, but anytime she looked his way with her pitiful eyes he would look away or engage in conversation to avoid her. When she was about to ask if
"That bad?"

, death was evading him. He could almost equate the situation to sexual tension between him and Death – if death was a person, that is.
"You… really?"
“Fat Friar told me he has been hanging out on the 13
"Hey, guys."
"Perhaps."
"Can I ask another?"
"He was an evil wizard, second only to Voldemort," she said and Harry's eyes widened in shock. "Of course he did not start that way but he ended up that way."
Professor Slughorn burst through the room, clapping his hands happily as he looked to his left and right, surveying his Eighth Years. He reached to the front of the classroom, sunlight gleaming through large glass-stained windows, twirled twice, and smiled openly.
"About 27 days."
Professor Slughorn clapped his hands twice. "Excellent, Ms Granger. Quite excellent. Sharp as ever! I can wait to hear more excellence at the Slug Club dinner party tonight. Can someone remind us why the Draught of Living Death is dangerous?"
"It's not quite about… you know
"How'd you know Shakespeare?"
“It’s what I thought,” he said mournfully before blinking and looking hastily around. Thankfully no one picked up on him talking to a roasted duck.
He no longer wanted to be an Auror, something he was going to have to tell Ron and Hermione, and since his life was largely based on him being an Auror he never had a reason to look beyond Auror prospects and now that he was given a chance, a second chance, he simply had no idea. He did not want to fight anymore, that was for sure.
He stayed and chatted with Fat Friar, asking him about his Healer abilities. It was calming talking to him, his joyful and cheery outlook on life despite how life turned out for him, was slowly rubbing off on him. With the night sky up high, he had already skipped the Great Hall dinner time and when it was nearing 1 a.m., he headed towards the Astronomy Tower.
"I took a Dreamless Sleep potion before and that's the closest I've come to sleeping potions."
"Quite right, Ms Patil but unfortunately the year is wrong. Does anyone know the correct year? Ah yes, Ms Granger?"
"Good, Potter."
Harry put his book down when a small chime rang through the Hospital Wing, notifying him that there was a visitor. Since his stay at the hospital, there had been two new occupants but seeing as one had yet to wake up and the other was a First Year who was unable to talk because of a curse, he might as well have been the only one in the Wing.
He had a stare-off with him, pleading with him to not follow suit with the brewing of the sleeping potion as he most likely would turn it to any other color than the desired one. But Malfoy was stubborn and was gazing back at him with determination and, dare he say, belief? Did Malfoy believe he could be good at Potions, enough to scrape an EE?
"Of course, you did, mate. I totally see that," Ron replied sarcastically.
Harry's mouth moved to speak but no words came out. He quickly glanced towards Malfoy then Blaise then to the Professor.
“Are you serious, Harry? She’s is talking nonsense.”
"Of course."
"Patronus?" he asked. He did not want to call Malfoy out for his blatant change of subject yet again he did not want to thank him for it so he let it be.
"I don't know how else to say it," Harry admitted. "What did the author say?"
Malfoy pinched between his eyes as he muttered incoherently under his breath. "Miranda Goshawk, the witch who wrote famous Charms spell books for Hogwarts."
"Can you think of any, like, singular happy memory in your entire life? Like when you and your mother would watch the stars together?"

"That is not going to work," Hermione sharply said to her boyfriend. "Ginny sounded as if she wanted to rekindle whatever romance they had but how do you rekindle a fire that has gone out?"
floor? Why on earth would be there?”
Nowadays he just seems to always remain awake and it was tiring him out.
Malfoy startled, looking towards Slughorn helping a couple of Hufflepuff students, then back to Harry. "How do you know he asked Slughorn? And why him? Is he some sort of expert in dark magic?"
Harry involuntarily shivered. He could not imagine never having to feel the sun on his own skin. Despite the horrible English weather, he did occasionally like the rain, the smell of it, especially. But to have lived so long as a ghost that one forgot the feel of such small, yet big, things, he could not imagine it and his heart sunk at the prospect of Fat Friar’s ancient ghost.
Harry scanned page 32 of his Potions textbook. "But the book says stir anti-clockwise."
"Potions," Malfoy said, listing each subject with a finger. "Transfiguration, Herbology, Charms, and DADA. Herbology is going to be a pain in the ass I can tell you for sure."
Fat Friar nodded. "They were the best of friends, those two. Tied at the hip. They got on like a house on fire."
"No," she answered looking between, once more, Harry and Blaise. "I'll be your partner."
"How? But how? Ron performed a Memory charm on him in Second Year that wiped out his memory… how was he able—
Harry gulped. He had not thought about what happened to his goodbye letter to Molly. He had not even thought about how he hastily dropped it inside his bedside table and called it a night.
Ron groaned loudly and was immediately hushed by his girlfriend. "How am I supposed to write all that and do the Potions essay, go to Hogsmeade to buy ingredients for next lesson, and fill in three blank star charts and write a five-inch essay on the witch-hunts in the 10th Century and—"
"What?! What's going on?"
Harry scribbled down on his brownish parchment, the scribbling would be intense as if jotting down words and adverbs and adjectives before they disappeared from his brain and then slow down the next minute as if finding the right word, the right simile to make whatever he was writing perfect.
It was all well and good anyway since he had an appointment with the Mind Healer McGonagall scheduled.
Fat Friar bounced as they walked down the well-lit corridor of the 10
“How about
"Why?"
"I need your help," Harry announced, and as if in slow motion, Malfoy and his friends all turned to face him. "It's urgent."
It was strange.
“Duck?” Ginny asked.
She nodded. "He was seeking blood while Albus sought prosperity."
floor.”
He never thought he would live in a world where his best friends made it to the bottom of his list when ominously asked who was allowed to visit him while in hospital. "Blaise, Luna, Malfoy, Fat Friar, and Hermione."
"Sleep you did, Harry."
"Yes. She often told me that some wizard or other along her bloodline did not sleep as magic sustained him. He was working on a Potion for sleep paralysis but he never got to finding the antidote because he died. Nobody knew why but now I guess it's because his magic killed him." Malfoy narrowed his eyes. "You're slowly becoming a case for unusual magic happenings that one only hears or reads about."
Malfoy gave him a sad smile. "Being alive and feeling alive are not synonymous."
Hermione hummed. "Why was it moved to the 10th floor? That's the big question."
Hermione nodded. "You two had something boundless back in Sixth Year but with us trapezing around looking for Horcruxes and fighting Voldemort and keeping up with just about everything dampened whatever you had with Ginny. Ron and I are lucky to still have each other after."
Malfoy blinked at the stars thanking them that he even had a chance to look at them, silently thanking the boy sat beside him for speaking on his behalf at Wizengamot and coming out scot-free. He could have been living a very, very different life right now, one that did not include the freedom to watch the stars, one that was eerily identical to his father's.
She considerably calmed down. "I see. Come in, come in. Sit there," she gestured to a purple couch by the fire, "and I'll make us both a hot cuppa, how does that sound?"
"If that is the case, how would that explain why Godric is on the 10th floor?"
"I'm not suggesting anyone else because that's literally everybody left. Everyone else already has a partner," and with that Hermione spun around in her chair and began her assignment with Luna.
"Taking Astronomy balances my abysmally low grades for Ancient Runes."
"Blaise takes Muggle Studies. He quite likes the playwright and often ends up quoting him. Anyway, I can't remember but Shakespeare said something about humans and their small swift life before they are extinguished like a candle flame."
He swallowed his roasted potatoes. “Truthfully, I, like, haven’t.”
"Because we need to learn about Antidotes in general before venturing onto Poison Antidotes," Hermione said as a matter-of-fact.
Blaise dramatically touched his chest. "Oh, the honor, Savior. Truly an honor."
"It'll help to know where to start on the angle of Salazar as I cannot seem to find the first step which was his portrait."
“Ginny,” sighed Harry.
"That's fantastic. It is class time, however, what are you doing out and about on the 11th floor?"
"Raczidian," Malfoy absent-mindedly corrected him. "Nobody knows if he lived or not. Part of me thinks it's a cautionary tale told to ward off the dark side from casting Patronus charms."
Harry's eyes widened on the spot as he watched the professor fade before his eyes and then return to his normal ghost self. In the next minute, before his very green eyes, his body glitched as his head moved sharply to the right while his body shifted to its left then returned as fast as it had happened. And then it happened three more times.
"Yes."
book front to back and the year 1368 is a dry year. Trust me nothing interesting happened relating to Godric or Hogwarts. Actually, that was, like, the year when the Third Triwizard Tournament occurred."
In truth, he had no more fight left in him. He was hanging onto a very thin rope.
"I… I can't sleep," he explained and watched Madam Pomfrey's face morph into absolute worry. "Not like that. Not like before. Just, like, sleepless. Restless, I mean. I feel restless."
Harry got to, his legs shuffling before running out of the Charms classroom and running quickly to the—
"No physical proof, Potter. Can I proceed?"
"Yes, they do," she answered not fazed by his question and Harry briefly wondered if this was
Like always, the professor had given them three unrelated essays to be completed before the next lesson.
Once again Madam Pomfrey seemed neither shocked nor surprised – perhaps already used to this – at his list but simply nodded and instructed him that from tomorrow he was allowed to have guests. Only two at a time were allowed to visit him, mind. If any more than two arrived, the wards at the door of the Hospital Wing would not let them pass the threshold. And with that, Harry closed his eyes and fell asleep.
Harry sighed and looked at the end of his bed. He stretched his feet towards the edge, his tippy toes unable to touch the end rail of his hospital bed. "What do you do about your nightmares?"
"Thanks, Mione," he said, eternally grateful. "With, like, all of it—all of this."
"However, that only happens if you properly know how to read the cards, of course, otherwise they are harmless. But I shall not risk it as Divination is not a real
"What is it?"
"Yes, but after every seventh anti-clockwise, you shall stir once clockwise then revert to stirring anti-clockwise seven times."
"But it's not true! McGonagall and Pomfrey know the truth. I also told them the truth, it wasn't you."
"Can I ask you a question?"
Fat Friar laughed joyfully. “Not at all, Harry. It’s the same feeling as walking through a fog. You don’t really feel it. I don’t feel things anymore.”
Malfoy shook his head. "Unfortunately no but I found the Bloody Baron."
He stopped at the doors of the Great Hall, stopping to catch his breath and scan the hall. His eyes fell on two sets of ginger hair on the Gryffindor table. The Weasleys were Purebloods, he could ask them. He stopped his feet after several steps. Ginny most likely would not talk to him and he and Ron were icy towards each other because of Ginny.
"What are we going to do now? We were meant to question him about Salazar."
Hermione looked doubtful. "When did you actually write it? You haven't finished your essay on the properties of Moonstone and its uses in Potion making."
to check the time – 1:49 PM – and mentally calculated for 40 minutes for his lasagna to be ready. In the meantime he cleared out his area, throwing out his trash, putting back his ingredients, spices, and dry cereals to where they belong.
"The legend of Godric and Salazar."
"He did not like them and history says that he did murder them."
Harry swallowed thickly and nodded in the affirmative.
Potter.
Professor Slughorn instantaneously noticed Harry, as he always did. Harry wondered if the reason he noticed him was simply because of his mother being the best student in his class or because he was Harry Potter but that was neither here nor there.
"You don't have to say yes, like, I was just thinking if you wanted some help. Which you may, like, not need but it's there. It's being offered. By me. Like. Um. I am offering my help… if you need it. Erm. Help. That is from me—"
One morning, Aurors stormed to the Manor demanding the head of one Lucius Abraxas Malfoy which the Minister of Magic personally came to collect, as if he were an object at an auction. Lucius was thrown into Azkaban without a second thought and was left to rot. Malfoy never once visited his father, never accompanied his mother on her bi-weekly visits accompanied by five Aurors not even on her last visit when she found her husband lifeless, alone and cold.
"No. Not once did it even cross their minds to think what they had was wrong. In their minds everything was right, despite where they stood, everything was right and alright. They did prove to be something though."
“I am still curious about Godric and Salazar’s friendship. Maybe if I talk to Godric’s portrait I might get some clues.”
Not tonight.
ooooooooo and so we move on. do we have an idea what their Mission name translates to? aye?
“Let’s come up with a codename for our mission,” Harry suggested. “Maybe cabbage?”
"The tale goes that those only of pure heart can cast a Patronus. Somehow it elucidates why my father couldn't cast one yet Snape could. It would always drive my father mad."
"Absolutely not," Harry said. "I still have nightmares from the Yule Ball, thank you very much."
"You can do that? Sign a blood pact?"
“Oh?” he said and internally cringed. He was seriously turning into a parrot. He might as well be called Harry
Harry has several visitors during his stay.
"But he was always different, wasn't he?"
"Have faith, as Luna always says."
"History of Magic."
“Oi, he’s quite delightful.”
"She's quite lovely," Luna said, her voice as light as a cloud.
"So… who's the new Professor at for
"The question remains whether that is good enough of a reason---"
He never found the cure to his insomnia and Harry was increasingly worried about his lack of sleep, even entertaining the idea that he had transformed into a Muggle zombie and nobody knew. How was he able to remain awake for nearly 24 hours and his body not need sleep? It was basic knowledge that a body needed rest to rejuvenate yet Harry's body was able to sustain him.
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiyaaaaaaaaa ! we're slowly developing the plot, lol, and i think draco was done dirty when not even jk rowling let him have a patronus & literally nobody else thought, 'hey! draco should be able to cast one!' so i did haha
Harry sat down on the floor, leaning his back against the wall.
"What we allegedly know about Godric and Salazar's friendship is false," Malfoy stated, looking at him. "According to the tale as old as time, Salazar and Godric were indeed friends and while they did have obvious differences – such as recruiting Muggleborns into Hogwarts – their friendship remained. It continues that Rowena and Helga were jealous of this friendship and manipulated Godric into believing that Salazar was an evil wizard who built the Chamber of Secrets to secretly purge any and all Muggleborns in Hogwarts."
Even before reaching his table, the Slytherins all turned their heads in slow unison that in any other situation Harry would have been laughing out loud. He stopped before their table, all of them showing different types of grimaces and disgust towards Harry but he ignored them, his eyes settling on Malfoy.
"I thought we were writing an essay on how to properly brew the Strengthening Solution?" asked Dean Thomas sat beside his best friend Seamus Finnigan.
Harry swallowed. The last time he checked he was in an argument with his best friends over Ginny and that was never resolved. He had barely been talking to other people who were alive, that is, except for Malfoy. He did talk to Luna and Blaise and had the three of them had grown quite close but perhaps not close enough to allow visitation rights. Or perhaps they had?
"Susan Bones."
“Excellent work, Ms Granger,” Professor McGonagall praised her. “It’s perfect! The rest of you, please follow her lead.”
Hermione smiled. "You're welcome, Harry. You know I haven't been able to do any light reading because I am worrying a lot about my NEWTS and my future and my parents and, well." She paused. "So this is a good distraction."
Harry clamped his mouth shut but his eyes did not leave Malfoy's sparkling silver ones.
"Don't even think about it, Mr Potter," she said and they were back on a formal basis. "You've only just woken up after three weeks, there is no way you'll be walking out of here for at least six days."
Malfoy had found him writing a letter – a goodbye letter – to his adopted mom, Molly Weasley. He was thanking her deeply for including him in her family, for welcoming him with open arms and treating him like one of her children, like he was part of the family. He thanked her for a lot of other things but lately he had not been feeling well. He was
"Slytherins hating on anyone who isn't a Pureblood is proof enough."
As he waited for his dish to be ready, he found his mind wandering to the conversation he had with Malfoy up on the Astronomy Tower a week ago. It was odd, the whole experience, almost surreal. They had not hexed each other, they had not insulted each other Malfoy had been, dare he say, civil. Calm.
Harry remembered eagerly choosing to be an Auror, he simply wanted nothing else. He had it all envisioned and planned down to the last T, with the help of his mentor Albus Dumbledore, the then-Head of Gryffindor. He was going to be an Auror and needed to have passed at least five NEWTS to be qualified. He was going to go into training with Ron Weasley by his side, thereafter graduate from Auror training after three years, and rise the ladder to be Head Auror. Additionally, he was going to marry Ginny once he became Junior Auror (while she played professional Quidditch), have three children, and live the rest of his life happily ever after.
Ron grimaced and Harry frowned. Did they really have an essay to write on such?
Malfoy snorted under his breath beside Harry. "Second Year questions."
Hermione once more raised her hand. But so did Padma and Professor chose her. "The sleeping potion is the most dangerous of sleeping potions because the drinker falls into a deep slumber that can last indefinitely. A known example is Ferdinand Luther who had drank the potion and fell asleep for 461 years."
"That can't be true. A whole year and nothing happened?" Hermione wondered. "Something
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Luna said calmly, cutting through their bubble.
"Before we begin, I want to say…" Malfoy chewed on his bottom lip, seemingly having an internal battle with what he wanted to say. "I want to express my deepest gratitude for choosing me to perform The Veil ritual this afternoon."
"Harry! Is everything alright?"
Malfoy shook his head. "It was invented because of him."
Heading off to his mid-morning Potions class in the Dungeons, he wondered if he was forever doomed to not excel in this class. At first, he thought it was Snape that made him fail and look, he partially was as he set non-existent rules such as one had to always score an O in his class and if you were not a Slytherin you were basically doomed to fail (Hermione being the exemplary exception). But with the entrance of Professor Slughorn, he was still scrapping through the class. In their last quiz, he scored a P and that was after studying Hermione's simplified notes from First Year until Seventh Year.
Malfoy shook his head right to left. "Yes and no. Yes, because that is the legend and no, because there is no proof."
But he would never admit that to her.
Malfoy snorted. "You honestly don't think this old man still has that stupid club, do you?"
Harry shifted in his seat. “I think… um… we should, uh…”
"Rumors say differently."
Hermione shook her head. "If you had finished your assignment, you would already have 50 reasons and simply need to find the remaining 15. You know you could ask Padma Patil."
"I quite like Ancient Runes," he said conversationally. He thanked Merlin that Potter was in the state he was in so as not to comment on his weird conversation skills or lack thereof, but Malfoy was desperate as he did not want Potter to finish writing his lengthy letter that was upsettingly getting closer to what seemed like a conclusion.
"No way would Slughorn let me work alone in his classroom. He doesn't trust me."
from the same House as yours."
"Oranges are stronger in magic and power," she answered simply. "Don't you agree Harry?"
Malfoy stared at him, unsure if he had heard correctly or if his ears were tricking him. He wordlessly cast a wandless
"Harry!"
"It is a tough one."
? The disrespect Potter!”
“Do you miss that feeling?”
"Yeah, from embarrassment. I didn't want her as a partner. In fact, I'd take anybody else apart from her."
Harry's eyes widened at the comment and he vaguely wondered if Professor Slughorn knew about Salazar and Godric's legend. He knew a lot about the Horcruxes during his Sixth Year, he probably knew a lot about the original Head of his House.
Harry smiled with him.
"For three weeks?"
"Healer is a tough profession to pursue and succeed in as one essentially needs O's in all subjects. And with my pristine reputation," he said with disdain, "I'm not going to advance considerably in the field. That's why if I approach it at an angle of Potion-making, I can
This did not make her happy for she glared at him for a long time before she stomped out of the Hall. He turned back and looked on at the head of the duck to his left.
If they were watching, wherever they were, both Godric and Salazar could see themselves in both Harry and Malfoy, and wherever they were, they knew their history was about to be written right.
"I'm sorry, Ron," Harry apologized. "I don't feel that way anymore. I think the War made me realize a lot of things and one of them was that, like, I'm not in love anymore. I think we found comfort in each other because, you know,
Malfoy sighed. "I meant what I said before."
Malfoy combed his fingers through his hair, sighing. “Ten minutes of discussing what you found out and we go back onto our work.”
"And it's keeping you up?"
“Of course! You and I had something special and we’d be fools to let it go just because of a War. Voldemort can’t destroy they fire we had.”
"Was that not true? Didn't he kill Muggleborns?"
He turned around and spotted a platinum blond head at the Slytherin table. Malfoy was a Pureblood, probably the most Purebloods of Purebloods he had ever come across in his lifetime. He marched towards the Slytherin table, ignoring the whispers and murmurs as a Gryffindor headed to a Slytherin table.
Hermione pointed to his Divination textbook. "I'm sure you can find more information there. Or ask Zabini for more information as I'm sure he's an expert on it."
Malfoy sharply turned to him. “May I remind you why this needs to be of utmost top secret? If it gets out that we are conspiring to solve an ancient legend that the castle barely talks about, it will end badly and I can kiss my chances of living the rest of my life freely goodbye as I will be spending a good odd sixty-six years in Azkaban.”
"You're welcome."
Malfoy opened his mouth to answer but then closed it. He had reached a dead-end. There was no answer to his question without further research.
“And everybody with a brain knows her Animagus is a cat.”
"Neither do I."
"Is it? How come then Godric's Animagus is on the 10th floor?"
"Curiosity. How do you conjure one?"
"Forgive?"
Malfoy raised a questioning eyebrow.
"And the questions about the man who was under the sleeping potion's effects were also because you wanted to be sure?"
haapy new year potterheads! feels like a century ago since i wrote this but life swept me away and finally landed on my feet once again.
Madam Pomfrey raised an eyebrow. "A forbidden friend of sorts?" Harry nodded, chewing on his cake. "Not particularly myself but perhaps Albus."
"If you are anything like Hermione, which you are, Malfoy, your version of terrible grades is P which honestly isn't so bad."
"Justin?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'll talk to Ron," Hermione said. "Don't worry about it but
"If you don't properly know how to use it – and I doubt that you do – you will invite all sorts of dark magic to meddle with your magic and bad things tend to happen to you."
"They were on opposing sides?"
Harry inched closer to the portrait and noticed that the lion’s tale was moving slightly. “Does Godric talk?”
Professor Binns was still present; however, his appearance was pale, very pale that he could barely make out his shape floating in the air. Or Harry could read everything written on the board whilst looking through his old professor.
believe what I believe but that doesn't mean the legend is true or false."
"Loyalty?"
“We can trust no one. I have a strong sense that Salazar realized that in the end before his demise. And even after.”
For someone who grew up without a mother, they sure flooded his life a lot.
Afternoon classes on a Wednesday were superb for it was a double Arithmancy, followed by Ancient Runes and finally, before classes were over for the day, Ghoul Studies which only Dean took which then made Charms the last class Harry had for the day.
"Speaking of, as soon as you're out of the hospital, that's what we'll be doing. After hearing about your potion accident, Trelawney said we absolutely had to begin on our tarot card readings before anybody succumbed to The Force."
"History says?" Fat Friar joyfully laughed. "History says a lot of things, son, and usually the victor writes the history, not the loser. Unfortunately, Slytherin house did not get it's redeeming arc, even after all these years, it still has not."
Harry's lips slightly parted at the hand. He was transported back to First Year, on the train, when Malfoy offered his hand in friendship to which he rejected and here he was, offering, once more, his hand. His heart swelled inside of him and he willed himself to not cry, thank you very much.
"That's being covered next week," Hermione said, factually.
kudos & comments - even the random ones, too - will be HIGH LOVED as i love to read what y'all think of it haha (: (idk why i'm laughing tbh)
He took a bite of his broccoli pasta salad. He supposed he could ask Hermione. Or Malfoy, too.
He began the recipe by chopping the broccoli into small, chunky sizes and put them inside a glass bowl. Next, he chopped the green beans into half and added them to the mix. On top of a lemon kick, he also loved zucchini and it was an obvious choice to add to his broccoli pasta salad. He added the other ingredients such as the cherry tomatoes and sun-dried tomatoes (can never have too many tomatoes, see) and finally some pine nuts.
"You don't need a good reason, Malfoy. Simply being friends is all it takes to show up for those that matter to you."
." And with that, she finished her break and proceeded to finish her thick essay.
"Mandy Brocklehurst?"
Malfoy let a long-suffering sigh and rolled his eyes so far back all Harry could see was white.
“The Ministry can’t do that!”
"In Chapter Four of
"They also say you overdosed…"
"She smells like cinnamons."
"Voldemort had cursed Grindelwald and Albus rushed him here, at Hogwarts, asking me to heal him. Of course, you know, I can heal just about anything under the sun," she added, giving Harry a cheeky wink. "But his injuries were severe and there was nothing I could do. Albus spent his days and nights by his bedside, never once leaving him alone. He died three days later."
Hermione was all too happy to divulge on the readings and essays and lessons and experiments Harry had to catch up on and he was not feeling weighed down by the sheer amount of work he had. Instead, he was happy to just lay back and listen to Hermione relentlessly and passionately talk and he supposed that was what he missed, reminiscing on the good ol' days when it was the Golden Trio.
, Potter, not grey – dagger."
"What on?" Harry briefly summarized the legend of Godric and Salazar for her. "That's fascinating! I, too, did not think that it was true, merely an ancient myth that was mistranslating in
Harry sat gaping at her. Dumbledore had a lover this entire time? He was not just some old man, wrinkled and cranky and ruining his life? He had someone in his life? Harry snorted. Even Dumbledore had a somewhat successful love life and he was, well, here.
She had come to visit Harry, joyful at the prospect of seeing her best friend after three weeks of laying in the Hospital Wing after his overdose. However, at the threshold of the Hospital Wing door, she walked through but her boyfriend did not. Or rather, could not. It was as if an invisible barrier was preventing him from entering. Madam Pomfrey had met them both at the door explaining the new visitation system and concluded that Ronald would not be allowed to visit Harry… as per Harry's request.
"It's not?"
“Why the sudden interest?”
He found himself, once again, stomping off to Madam Pomfrey’s office, explaining that sleep was eluding him. She conjured a dark purple Sleeping Draught for him that was meant to put him into a deep sleep instantaneously. Excitedly, he took a drink out of the bottle, placed the potion on his bedside table, closed his eyes and… did not drift off to sleep. He waited for a couple of minutes, couple of hours, still nothing and cursed Madam Pomfrey the entire night.
"Wiggenweld Potion, unfortunately, takes about a week to make and then, when administered, takes approximately two days before the patient wakes up. Yours took longer because your dosage was higher than normal."
"It'll make it stronger."
"But whatever their relationship it did have an impact on the big picture."
“Today we are turning Cauldron Cakes into cabbages. One of the hardest and most complicated of transformation spells.”
Yet he managed to let out a weak, “Okay.”
"Yes."
Harry's heart ached for a moment. Some part of him wished that what he had with Ginny was strong enough to sustain the damages of the War but alas, it never was. Perhaps it was a testament to how fragile they were as a couple.
Harry looked longingly at his food. “I’ll think about it, Ginny.”
? So far Harry hasn't said a reason as to why."
“Never.”
Seemingly out of thin air, he produced a long parchment that he waved in the air. "I have changed the rules of admission; no longer will one need to have connections nor hold fame but simply show true promising strength in magic. Additionally, there shall be 12 students, no longer 10. Those attending shall be…"
Harry opened his mouth then shut it. He could not remember. He remembered falling asleep, yes, but before that, nothing. Did he take one drop? Or three? Perhaps he took two and a half! It was less than five, that was for sure.
Currently, he was on a pasta kick right now. He was finding plenty of ways to cook pasta such as Pasta Pomodoro, Garlic Mushroom pasta, Pesto pasta, Creamy Sweet Corn Pappardelle, and of course, the classic Spaghetti Bolognese and yet he was finding new ways to cook the dish. He had told neither Ron nor Hermione about it, most certainly not Ginny, as they would not understand. Cooking was decidedly a Muggle hobby and was even downgraded to mostly for home-based witches in the wizarding world. Also, imagining The Saviour preferring to cook homemade macaroni & cheese instead of fighting against the bad guys as an Auror would not be met well by the wizarding world in general. Nevermind what Rita Skeeter would even
Harry rolled his eyes at Blaise. "She also said a giant monkey will be in the Great Hall on Sunday at 5 o'clock and yet nothing of the sort has ever happened."
Harry spluttered. "I thought he was dying! He kept, like, disappearing from my eyes and insisting I fetch a Pureblood witch or wizard."
"So… what have I missed in class?"
His latest book."
"Who can give me the names of the other sleeping potions?"
, Mr Potter," Professor Binns said, his voice not a drone anymore but rather quite sharp and impatient and, momentarily, Harry wondered what his real voice sounded like. "It indicates the relationship between Godric and Salazar was based on that of professionalism to build something unprecedented that would last for millennials to come, to provide an institution of learning for all those who wished to learn. Whatever ill relationship the two founders, or even four founders, had between themselves did not interfere with the overall big picture."
So were the Astronomy Tower trips and the lengthy goodbye letters he frequently wrote to Molly, his adopted mother. The night Malfoy had met him he had the intention of sending that letter, his last goodbye letter but the slimy git had begun talking to him about the damn legend or whatever and in that he had forgotten about his letter. He had not touched it since but it was safely tucked inside his bedside table.
"Oh yeah?"
"Nothing in wizarding history," Harry answered. "Nothing out of the ordinary, actually."
If they looked up, they were looking at their future, if they looked down, they were looking at their past. He never did quite understand her cryptic words, not just this one, but then again, it was how she always spoke.
"Like Blaise?"
He leaned forward conspiratorially. "What do you know about Voldemort's soul?"
Harry looked towards Ron, then Neville, then back at Ron. "So… any chance on me reading your future?"
Harry mentally slapped himself on the head. Of course,
Harry shook his head.
There was also the issue of Salazar's portrait missing. Why would his portrait be
"The Mirror was often regarded as showing, not one's appearance, but their heart's deepest desire. Cartomancy has the same effect as you allow your future to be read and secretly open up yourself and your magic to be infused with what the cards have predicted as your future."
Malfoy levelled him with a look. “You would like to name a very real, very serious mission on finding the truth behind the founders of Hogwarts
"Why of course I do! We all know about the legend! It's an impressive one if you ask me."
"Why I'd love to," Luna said, her voice airily and light.
"Yes, Madam Pomfrey," Hermione agreed and Harry mumbled something or other under his breath. Hermione got the warning because Blaise and Luna had stayed well over three hours when the Matron had specifically instructed visitation was for one hour only.
"Do you have any theories about where to even begin finding bodies of legends?"
"I cannot seem to find anything regarding his death," Harry tried a different angle, "see I would like to know where he was buried."
"I'm just surprised, that's all."
"Am I wrong?"
, Harry thought as he stared. There were pink and white Fizzing Whizzbees, Fudge flies, honey-colored toffees, multicolored Jelly Slugs, No-Melt Ice cream that was Ron's favorites, Pixie Puffs, Cauldron Cakes, peppermint cream that was shaped like the Hogwarts house animals, exploding bonbons, and Harry's favorite, chocolate frogs.
year, did you think it was going to be easy?"
Hermione gasped. "Your magic sustained you!"
"He… he's different." Then he frowned as he truly heard Hermione's sentence. He looked at her defensively. "He isn't a Death Eater."
“A yellow aura.”
"What do you mean?"
"He always was."
"Did you come with Ron?"
"I knew that," Hermione promptly said. Harry rolled his eyes because of course,
"Afternoon students," she greeted and they murmured their responses. "Mr Malfoy, a word."
Harry whispered back, "Revision is a powerful thing." For once, however, Harry knew the answer. As he had been lacking sleep lately and had tried nearly everything under the sun to enable him to sleep and not entertain the idea that he was secretly a vampire, or worse a Muggle zombie, he was excited for today's particular lesson as, as far as he understood anyway, that this potion was the most powerful and potent of all sleeping potions.
“However, I have been keeping my eye on you. There is something different about you, something that reminds me of a fish out of water.” She paused and for the first time in their interaction her eyes softened at him. “I can see your pain from afar, Harry, and it’s a surprise that no one has been able to spot it.”
That was the same day that Slughorn was hosting him and the rest for the Slug Club supper party. He could not miss that as they were going to find out important information of what Slughorn knew about the legend.
“Mr Potter, a word,” Professor McGonagall’s voice rang through loud and sharp and Harry froze. What was this about? Malfoy spared him a brief glance before joining Parkinson and heading out of the classroom. Hermione and Ron stopped by his table, stating that they would wait for him outside class. He nodded and made his way to the front of the class.
Ron cursed under his breath before stabbing his fork into another fat, juicy sausage. "I haven't done none of that. I was busy writing my essay on Everlasting Elixirs."
“Interesting. Perhaps the portrait is charmed to only show to specific people? Such as those from Gryffindor.” He muttered under his breath when his Cauldron Cakes transformed into apples. He set his wand down with a loud smack and turned to Harry. “Have you perhaps gone with someone else?”
“When I was with Fat Friar—”
Malfoy looked on astonishingly. "That's exceptional! I only heard about it from Mother's stories but didn't think it was true."
"Did he get his wish?"
The sentence was left hanging in the air, waiting for it to land on the ground. Malfoy was pointedly looking beyond Harry's head at the glass painting of a Medieval Healer from the 1400s whilst Harry was staring intently at the green color on his robes.
, grades one to seven," he responded dryly. "You're being evasive."
"What have you been up to since going under?"
“At your service, son.”
Ever since he was young, Harry loved cooking. From the moment he could walk, he was handed a spatula, pan, and apron and instructed to cook three square meals daily. Thereafter it never left his system. During his Hogwarts years, he would cook to ease his stress. During OWLS, he would cook up a storm at The Burrow and Molly going ahead and teaching him numerous cooking charms and spells that made a world of a difference. He tried, however, as much as possible to use the least amount of magic in cooking; there was something about Muggle cooking that made food taste better.
"In my entire life as a Healer, it is never magic that heals people but love. Love is the true healer, love is magic."
He looked up to find Malfoy strangely looking at him. He cleared his throat and asked, "What happens now?"
"Have you written down your essay on why you want to be an Auror?" Hermione asked, as if not having heard Harry's sentence.
“So what did you want to talk about?”
"What are you doing here Malfoy?"
Malfoy’s eyebrows raised in surprise. “13
"You died sometime in the Sixties," Harry explained.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Is it true about that guy who slept for nearly 500 years? Like, is it a fact?"
but not Ron? Why on earth would you do that?"
"Your wife is alive Professor?" Harry blurted.
"N-no," Harry stuttered. "Not at all."
Before lunch, he thought it would be a good idea of visit Rebeus Hagrid. He had not seen the loving tall man in a minute. On his walk from the Gryffindor Towers down the corridors, he bumped into Ginny.
uh ohhhh did harry pay attention in class about dosages?? who knows?? apart from that, this narrative of sleeping will come through in the end, dw, everything will come out eventually. you know them mystery books like agatha christie or shows like sherlock where there are easter eggs but you ignore them cause they're so INSIGNIFICANT... well well well [;
Harry’s eyes widened and he shot down whatever was on her mind. “Get your mind out of the gutter, that is not what I meant.” He heavily sighed. “I’ll think about it.”
Harry stood up after scraping his plate clean, and after cleaning up, walked out of the Room and wandered off into the cold, eerie corridors of Hogwarts.
"Oh no, my dear, that would be the Quidditch man. I am The Fat Friar, Hufflepuff House Ghost."
"What's wrong with cinnamons?" Ron asked.
"He was acquitted."
"It has to be a specific moment," he repeated. "I really cannot explain further than that. Do you think, like, Salazar was able to create one?"
"Oh, so sorry to offend you…
"Before he died, Godric wrote a letter to his best friend that he forgave him for all that he did, for purging Muggleborns in the Chamber of Secrets and his last request was that when Salazar died, they are buried together wherever he wished as proof of his loyalty."
“Mum’s the word on the change. It’s an ongoing mystery and so far, no one seems to have solved it. Not even Helena herself knows the answer.”
"Or work it out, you know" Ron suggested.
Harry sheepishly smiled at him.
have happened but you didn't catch it."
"I don't get why you're all learning about Moonstones in Eight Year," Ginny wondered out loud.
Both Padma and Harry looked to Blaise who was looking between them amused. Harry stared down at him as if sending a telepathic message of
"It's a starting point, Potter."
"Hey, Padma."
Harry blinked and looked around him. Hermione was eyeing him worryingly while Ron had slowed down his chewing. "Sorry, what did you say?"
Harry frowned. "That… doesn't make sense. You conquer death through death?"
y'all take care x
"How would you know that?"
Malfoy looked down at Harry and had a smirk playing on his lips. "Ready?"
"Don't look so shocked!" Malfoy stated. "Did you honestly think you were not going to get it right under my tutelage?"
"When can I leave?"
, but once it was over I thought, like, I'd feel the same but to be fair, I did not. I am grateful that we had each other, duh."
"Malfoy!" he said under his breath, his eyes gazing at his new visitor walk down the aisle of the Wing, heading straight for his bed. He felt as if his heart was a snowflake falling to the ground but before the snowflake touched the cold ground, he landed on a warm hand that was awaiting his arrival. He felt warm and a feeling of being wanted.
"The very one."
“What do you mean?”
"During Slughorn's Club, I did approach him to inquire about Salazar's portrait. He said that it had been commissioned but it was never hung. Anywhere."
but rather studying his previous books to learn about his take on wizarding history. Currently, all Years are studying
"As I said, the oaf's take on wizarding history. Currently, it's simply you and Abbott taking the class in our Year."
"I also wrote an essay on that too," Seamus commented.
"When you were found that morning, your space was searched and cleared. They were looking for clues as to what transpired with your incident. They found your letter addressed to Mrs Weasley."
"And you, him."
"What do you mean, Hermione?" asked Neville.
With his nightmares having stopped, his joy was short-lived when sleep also eluded him. Walking off to the Hospital Wing, Madam Pomfrey provided him with a Drowsiness Draught that would induce tiredness that should cause him to fall asleep. Nothing happened and he stayed awake, staring at the ceiling of his bedpost until it was time for breakfast. The next time, he placed a bottle of Fatiguing Fusion beside his Drowsiness Draught and … nothing. Again. The only difference this time was the large amount of fumes surrounding his bed.
“Here we are! The one and only, the brilliant Godric!”
"Everyone knows that, Potter. It's no secret."
"No!"
Oddly, too, in his weird daze, he would often wander through the corridors of Hogwarts, finding himself in areas he had never visited before. Such as yesterday he found himself on the 11th floor, left disconcertingly empty corridor. He walked down the corridor, sans wand in his hand (after having lived twice he found himself not finding the hustle and bustle of protection seeing as he always came out alive, regardless), and, well, not much actually. He was simply wandering…
"I had my talk today with McGonagall."
Harry shook his head. "Malfoy came and I couldn't very well continue the letter."
"Since Trelawney insists we call each other by our first names," Blaise said, unperturbed. "And besides, Harry, Trelawney said nobody was dying this week in Hogwarts."
"Somewhat simple," she clarified, "once you break everything down into bits and pieces, his life is simple. If he considers you his friend, you are his friend and that's that. It's hard to shake him off."
He turned, surprised he had not spotted Luna before.
but about Professor Binns."
“But—” He tried to explain himself but Professor McGonagall stopped him.
"Have you found a partner, Padma?" From behind them, Ernie Macmillan asked.
"You're still under the effects of the Wiggenweld Potion that are fighting against the effects of the sleeping potion you consumed."
"Do you know why the two founding fathers had a falling out?"
“Terms of my probation,” Malfoy said in a tone that indicated he was tired of using this as an explanation for a lot of aspects of his life. “You need to keep that Hufflepuff ghost aloof.”
"But McGonagall accepted you back, you're on Probation, you're doing your time so I don't see why it's a big deal!"
"Well done my boy, well done. Truly something special when Slytherins and Gryffindors work together. Just like the founding fathers of Hogwarts did back then."
, he ended in his mind. He did not want to admit that to Potter, something about it being very dear to his heart. It was true, however, as the last time he ever had peace in his life was when he was 14 years old.
"It's similar to superstitions like in the Muggle world," Hermione explained and he partly understood where Ron was coming from.
Harry frowned at him briefly before looking up at the stars, attempting to find said serenity. He did not know what he was looking at or for, and perhaps it was because nobody ever told him beautiful starry mythical stories, as all he saw currently were white dots on a black canvas. His eyes dropped and he looked below to the green grass on the large fields of Hogwarts.
… until a ghost burst through the floor and he came to a staggering halt. His heart was beating rapidly against his chest as he came to a standstill before a man that was short, stout, dressed in grey monastery clothing, and holding a rather large mug floated before him. His appearance looked familiar and his name was on the tip of his tongue.
"For the life of me I didn't remember if I was to take one drop, half a drop, or, like, four drops," Harry said, chuckling at himself because it was very much him. "You have to understand, Malfoy I was so, so tired. Of just everything. I wanted the world to stop for a bit, just a tiny bit." He snorted depreciatively. "Look where it got me."
The blond turned his head and raised an eyebrow. "You're alive."
Malfoy shook his head. "While it was a fascinating experience and a once-in-a-lifetime one at that, it's also ironically not a big deal. It was bound to happen so there is not much tattle around it. Do you still have the pink carnation?"
Malfoy smirked. "It's a legend after all."
Again, she paused and looked on at him, this time with suspicion in her eyes.
Whether it was because he was in Gryffindor or having vast experience on being
“Hullo Harry, ready for duck?”
Madam Pomfrey nodded curtly. She set her unfinished tea on the floating tray beside her head and reached beneath her white apron to pick a folded brown paper from underneath. She held out the paper for Harry who gently took it from her hands.
so she does not count. Then Zabini whose mother is a voodoo doll for all I know and then you, a very odd choice."
"Thanks for coming guys," he said, genuinely happy to see them and also talk to someone else apart from Madam Pomfrey. "You have no idea how long it's been since I've talked to a proper human—apart from Pomfrey."
kudos & comments - even the random ones, too - are HIGHLY WELCOMED as i love to read what y'all think (:
Blaise sat on the right side of his bed, smiled slyly at Harry at Luna's response then winked at him. "Divination is simply not quite the without you there, my sweet, sweet Harry."
"He has a cold."
“Are you hungry?” asked Malfoy, looking at him out of the corner of his eye.
"Do you remember the Mirror of Erised?" Hermione asked, taking a moment's break from her assignment. The three men nodded at her. "Cartomancy, or simply card reading, has the same effect that the Mirror has on one's magic."
"Cards cannot read your future."
"No excuses, Potter. Now add the sloth brain."
Harry's mind did not have the War fresh in his mind but the crowd of Slytherins sat together on the other side of the classroom. If Slughorn was asking them to partner up with someone from another House, he did not mind, though he would do anything to pair up with Ron, truly. However, he was all for House unity and perhaps it would not be weird if he partnered up with—
It sounded like she was accusing him of an overdose but surely that was not what happened. He looked away from her and his eyes settled on a glass painting of a famous Healer from medieval times.
"You've been in my care for three weeks now," she said and Harry's jaw fell to his chest. "You accidentally ingested more than the recommended dosage of Draught of Living Death and fell into a deep slumber. I was alerted to the happenings by your roommate Ronald Weasley who had attempted to wake you up for breakfast but to no avail. Only after spotting the Draught by your bedside table did he urgently call for me."
Harry idly turned a page of

“Tarts.”
"It's usually recurring nightmares going back to Australia, meeting my parents, and them not recognizing who I am. Sometimes I manage to reverse the Memory Charm but it doesn't work and they are doomed to never know that I am their only daughter."
Her last statement left Harry in deep thoughts but those thoughts were crashed the moment his head hit the pillow and sleep enveloped him.
This was news to Harry. "Really?"
"You blushing like a fool in front of Padma? Didn't notice a thing."
“Cakes?”
"If it sheds light on what prompted Godric to change to his Animagus form, then yes, I will. I know for certain that his movement, about 200 years after his death, had something to do with—
"The rest I manage," he answered. "Getting EE and A is not a fail to me and sometimes I don't care so much about getting P even if it's in, like, Arithmancy or Charms."
Seeing as he could not attend Slug Club because he was uninvited and was avoiding his appointment with the Mind Healer, he headed off to Godric's portrait. He tried talking to the lion, attempting to catch its attention but it simply looked at him with wide brown eyes. Its tail would occasionally swish side to side and that was the only indication that the lion could hear him.
"471 years, Sir."
Malfoy shook his head. "He's far too anemic to simply keep the lesson. Honestly, this moment is so rare it happens in one out of 657 chances. Count yourself lucky, Potter."
Malfoy frowned. "He's already dead? How can the dead die? Twice I might add?" Harry took a deep breath and in under 20 seconds explained what had transpired after his lesson. "He's going to the other side!"
said?”
Harry leaned forward, his nose almost brushing against the portrait. “He… Godric was an Animagus? He had the capability?”
"Did you hear what Slughorn said, about Salazar and Godric being friends?" Harry whispered conspiratorially.
"I was wondering if you were still going to hold a Slug Club supper party soon?"
"What your lowest grade?"
“Hello again! I wanted to see if I could reach here before you.”
Harry backtracked and blinked away, looking to his right where none other than Padma stood beside him.
"I am still fascinated by the visitation system. Madam Pomfrey said you're allowed about 10 people. May I ask who else you invited?" Harry told her. "Malfoy? As in Draco Malfoy?" Harry nodded. "You invited
"Enough of this!" Hermione had reached her limit. She starkly pointed at Harry with her long index finger. "You go inform Ginny that you no longer want a relationship with her in a cordial manner." Then promptly pointed to her boyfriend. "And you need to come to terms with your best friend no longer in love with your baby sister." With that, she promptly packed her Charms homework and stormed off to the Girl dormitories.
Fat Friar twirled in the air at the sight of Harry. “So glad to see you! Oh my dear! It’s been a hot minute, has it not?” He flew closer to him. “I hear that’s what people say nowadays, ‘a hot minute’ to signify a while.”
Harry rolled his eyes. "I… No. That was a mistake. I wasn't—Anyway, what's today's assignment?"
Harry jolted. He looked over at her, calm demeanor looking back at him and his eyes drifted off to the floating tray of tea and cakes. He nodded after a moment.
Harry nodded.
"You came?"
“Yeah, haven’t you?”
Now Harry was surprised. "How come?"
"I wasn't blushing!"
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him suspiciously. "What are you not telling me? How did you go from fighting against Death Eaters to being on the same side as them?"
Malfoy ignored him completely. “Why was his portrait moved in 1368? Did anything happen during that time?”
," said Malfoy, the Latin words rolling off his tongue flawlessly that for a second Harry wondered if it would be weird to request Malfoy to speak Latin all the time. "It's the incantation one says to allow souls that have not yet departed to move freely between this world and beyond. The pink carnations," he pointed to the one in Harry's open palm, "are flowers associated with safe passage and also, traditionally, are given in condolence for the dead."
Harry nodded in understanding. He did not mean to brag but Defense Against the Dark Arts was a bore to him as all that was taught in class, he learned in the one year he was trying not to die. It was widely known he was going to get an O in his NEWTS for it.
