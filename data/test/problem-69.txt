"We need to add one enchantment for spell-altercations, which means we need to come up with a spell to trigger the whole prank. The second enchantment has to be done by four people simultaneously, from one corner to another, for the basic color change. Third, the snow, which will be materialised. Fourth, a enchantment to incorporate the hairless potion with the snow."
"You," Draco frowned, "are doing extremely poor on asking questions seemingly inadvertently. No, the rumours aren't true. Pansy came up with it while we were talking, and other people overheard. Killing people, well, it's obvious Slytherins wouldn't have done so blatantly, isn't it."
"They've killed another one in Britain. The reports are heading into the Aurors' division, and coming out with a blank check. So where do their checks go, and who doesn't file the reports? That's the question Draco has to answer if he doesn't want to beg for his life at the end of a stranger's wand."
alongside three glasses of wine, one filled to the brim with simple grape juice. Draco took it obligingly as he watched his mother delicately swirl the wine once.
"We don't have anything more to gain out of Monsieur Chartres aside from what he wanted from Miss Millicent. That's not very important, either. We should lead on from Bartemius Crouch."
The hat settled across his head, a movement rather unlikely but with the aid of magic, and the hat's snide expression fell passive.
"What I do not understand, then, is the reason you seek out a Malfoy. If you are about to adopt an innocent child out of future conflict you may as well start up an orphanage."
The Friday of that week, Draco held the application rather roughly in his hand as he proceeded to the Blue Wing for his aerodynamics class. Blaise had deigned not to, and these were his exact words: in fear of the harsh climates affecting his skin. His mother, once knowing he was to join, had told his father, and his father, once realising the class was to help him have an influential position in Quidditch, gifted him a broom.
"Luna?" Draco crossed an arm over his chest, and rubbed his eyes with another. Draco, she returned with a smile, and tilted her head. If anyone had known how to read her movements without being distracted by the bullshit she spouted, they would've been surprised at her mocking tone.
"We couldn't go by generation. Four died during the first separation, one during the conflict in an assassination, a few of illnesses, most stepped down, five during Grindelwald's era, and one stepped down before Jason, and Jason stepped down for me."
At Pansy's excited whisper the entire table fell into a hush, which blatantly grabbed the attention of Gryffindors, then Ravenclaws, then Hufflepuffs in turn. Draco glared at Pansy who meekly shrugged, but continued to read down the letter.
"We're already planning something, not for you though," Fred took over his brother's mouth, "we want to have a good laugh, especially at such a time, and we're hoping you'd help us turn the Great Hall's sky pink."
The dementor hovered, there was another which passed his cabin uncaring of him or the dementor which remained. It was moving with purpose, Draco realised, because its trails which was the length of two cabins combined refused to stop. The first which had paused before his door reigned back its hand, a sharp wisp of cold frosting his glass, and it pulled away as sudden as it came.
"Grand-père, Narcissa Black has managed to convince all of the mothers that Igor Karkaroff is more suited with his head on the ground than attached to his neck. You must understand that their eyes would turn to you regardless of your refusal. Then why shouldn't you take this as an opportunity to begin before anyone else in the condemnation of such a poorer man?"
"I don't think," he started carefully, "I can admit that I am apprehensive of you. Can we compromise on this as being nervous, instead?"
Draco wondered if they thought he had a political stance at all. The older student hummed, and leaned back into his seat.
"There were several unexpected and unwelcome gains, but it went better than your hour past. Has the opinions regarding my admittance given you, us, trouble?"
"I didn't expect you to consider that far. But now it's time for you to think, on how the Death Eaters across Europe are still trickling into England when Dumbledore's requested Europe's cooperation on all magical signatures crossing all borders."
"Oh, my. You do scare me sometimes. No, Erlnier, not everyone, unfortunately. And we are commoners. Common wizards and witches you can spot easily on any street of any Wizarding World. What sets us apart, I suppose, is that we tend to know."
"When I spoke to him he lacked all sense. What did manage to get through was my honesty, I suppose. He's a Gryffindor in that aspect, someone who values honesty above all. But I wasn't honest. What I wanted was to steal anything of importance and value from the house, regardless of worth to Sirius Black, regardless of the disturbance I'd cause in its magic."
"I had to ask you something, Father, so one of the professors allowed me to take the port-key you've given me." The lie fell smoothly through a blank, and slightly unfocused look.
"The Triwizard Tournament's precautions are yet to be set by either Beauxbatons or Hogwarts. Without a guide to how the Tournament will be changed, it will be hard in all our interests to invite Durmstrang to a foreign school, especially a place where two co-exist."
Erlnier moved rapidly around the house, towards the side where there wasn't grass, minding his feet and stepping on the smallest pebbles, before landing right underneath a tree. There, he casted a levitation spell on himself to keep his feet or body imprint off the ground, and spelled the invisibility cloak into a durable stiffness. A double concealment charm on himself within the cloak with several whispers, and he floated there securely, unseen.
"You're mistaken. Sitting in classes didn't mean I understood them. My earliest memory is enjoying watching the colours from spells students were testing. Aunt Vivian and the other professors mostly asked to deliver messages between themselves. The most participation was between Aunt Vivian's classes and the Arts for some project or the other."
"Erlnier. We've a conversation to do." She turned from her tea with a green twinge and tilted her head.
"I would have agreed to your mother's insistence upon Hogwarts a few months prior. But with Dumbledore's incapable hand," here, he lifted a corner of his mouth in a sneer, "I am satisfied with your stay at Durmstrang."
"Don't bother finding a box. Find Blaise and Susan. I need to get this to Mr. Scrimgeour. We'll need the Floo. Know anyone?"
Vivian swallowed a thoughtless word which lingered in the hollowness of her mouth before grudgingly ending the conversation.
"Langley? No wonder, France dislikes being in the same room as Britain. Especially on American soil."
Ignoring professor Flitwick, who silently shadowed them in short bounds from the rear, they rushed down the Auror Department in a flurry of robes. None of the adults paused to stare at the sight, as they, too, were all in a flurry of movement. They poured down a staircase, and crossed a large hall Draco thought was underground, before coming to great, iron doors.
A small goblin, well, large for its kind, received them at the reception situated further inside the long, empty corridor. If it was seen to untrained eyes, no-one would have noticed that the walls itself were revolving doors.
"The Frenchman who came before us," Luna intervened, her red hair fading from sight, "can you explain what he did? What he said?"
"If you feel well enough to talk about my past, I'd say you have enough strength to pull out some more memories."
The twins looked at each other. Erlnier, for a moment, wondered whether they were going to shrug it off, like many others he had witnessed do in Hogwarts. Aside from the handful in Slytherin who were well attuned, and another which could grasp vague shifts in magic, there were none which seemed to care about the castle's moans against every student harmed, nor its protectiveness over children of all ages. But they turned to him once more with curiosity in their eyes, as one pulled out a piece of weathered parchment.
The cook seemed slightly startled at both of their young ages. Her voice grew even gruff, although she removed the knife from their sight.
Draco sighed, mad at himself most for losing his composure, and ran his thin fingers through his muddied, near-white hair which had grown past his ears. Strands came out broken, stuck to his nails, and he only sighed once more, and counted to ten.
He was too tired, and fell asleep again as he felt Pansy squeezed his hand hard and kissed him on his forehead.
Draco opened his eyes, and his Potter was there. Although what he had on were a pair of black slacks and a hideous red sweater with patterns of reindeers and slides and Christmas trees and other things Christmas. Somehow, he still pulled it off, with that and the dorky glasses, he looked nothing like the calm and ruthless Dom he was, but a nice family man that bakes delicious cookies and tells bedtime stories. He was even barefooted.
‘Could you please go fuck Blaise and leave me alone? I’m not above begging.’ Draco said sullenly, ‘I really… I really can’t deal with this now.’
His painful arse is urging him to comply, but kneeling on the ground, looking up at the annoyingly attractive face of his childhood rival, he just couldn’t bring himself to get on his lap to be spanked like a little boy. It’s not that he’s trying to escape his punishment, it’s just that if Potter wanted to put him over his lap and spank him, he’ll have to force him, there’s just no way he will ever do that willingly.
Draco wanted to go for a ride, but he was kind of afraid, and his pride stopped him from saying so in front of Potter, but Potter could probably tell, as he too knew Draco really well: ‘It can be a bit dangerous the first time, but an experienced flyer like you should be okay. Come. I’ll go with you.’
What she said was heartwarming, but Draco didn’t think his calculated decision making and selfish support for Potter’s wish should count as anything. But he didn’t want to hurt the old lady. He unconsciously closed his fingers around the mug so tight that he almost couldn’t feel them anymore, then said: ‘There’s still a long way in front of me. I try to do my best.’
‘Oh, I’m sure that what you said. There’s just a whole lot wrong with the man.’ Pansy said as she went and sat on another sofa with the bowl of oatmeal in her hands, folding her slim legs under her, ‘He’ll get over it. So should you. Plan the memorial. There’s no one better than you. Besides, everyone knows you two are besties now.’
Potter stroked Draco’s cheek and said: ‘I won’t be fastidious on your other behaviours because the goal is one thousand strikes, and it will be difficult for you to remember and follow my rules, so today I will be merciful. Even if you forget, no more punishment will be added. But I still expect you to respect me and do your best.’
He was not the torturer; one of his goons was; in fact, he seemed startled when the second kidnapper started to torture Draco, but went along nonetheless.
There were surprised gasps and squeals from the crowd, when Draco looked over, he saw Potter’s back, straight and staunch, and he had father’s cane grabbed easily in his hand.
Draco had been content with their relationship, even though it was not much of a relationship——they just fucked, that’s about it, but it was great sex, and often Potter was so good at it——and he was such a good-hearted Gryffindor, insisted on the endless kisses and other things——that he could make Draco forget that it was just sex. It wasn’t much, but it was more than what Draco thought he would ever have. Draco knew it couldn’t last forever; he was just never well prepared for it to end.
He had picked a lilac silk shirt with a deep V neck and a pair of tight white pants, especially for today, perfect for his skin tone and hair colour. He looked like a brat with too much gold who didn’t care and just wanted some good night. And his attitude? The way he worked the crowd, provoked and flirted with the Doms, he was asking for trouble.
Such assertiveness on a man is as good as any aphrodisiac to Draco. He looked away, but the man had caught on to it.
The man wasn’t asleep, just reading some materials in the bed, his face expressionless as he saw Draco woke up, Draco looked up at him, debating whether he should just climb onto the bed even it may earn him further punishment, or he should just play nice and stay in the basket.
Then his expression turned mischievous and seductive: ‘I also said I like you better. If I love Potter, what does that make you?’
Potter was silent for a moment, but he then patted the hippogriff on its shoulder, and it landed with elegance.
He felt exceptionally generous that night, and rather keen with his mouth, partly because talking didn’t seem like a good idea after all.
Draco had always been arrogant about his beauty, except for when he was actually facing the one he wanted to win over. It’s Potter who screwed him for that, never actually looked at him as if he was worth anything. But, he’s not going down that road. The man had always been happy and generous to assure him how much he was fascinated.
Potter was inconspicuous as ever, sitting with his back against the corner where he could get the best view of the whole room, nursing a cup of… something black, on rocks. The white shirt he was wearing was crumpled, like he had worn it and slept on a couch, probably cleaned with cleaning charms but was bad with ironing charm. His hair was wilder than usual; he must have spent an unusually long time flying, as Draco knew that’s how Potter dealt with his problems since in Hogwarts. He was rather tense, as he knew Draco was now in this club, those emerald eyes looked around from time to time, searching for Draco.
Draco hesitated for just a brief second and took the seat as he was told, the man directed his wand and a cup of hot tea floated to Draco, and Draco took a sip. So the man began: ‘Mr. Malfoy. You stated in the contract that you decided to use our service to punish yourself for… past bullying?’
The three of them left the room, but the pain was still there. Somehow the pain was different, there’s some strange sweetness coming from the spot in pain, and it was so hot that it had a clear shape…
The man hesitated, and finally sighed, he leaned down and was about to kiss Draco’s forehead, but remembered Draco had safeworded it last time, so he settled with placing his cheek against Draco’s forehead and stroked Draco’s hair a few times before he left: ‘You need that sobering potion regardless.’
It probably won’t fit anymore, as he had also grown some since Hogwarts. Not as much as Potter, judging by the few times pictures of him attending charity parties splashed over the various front pages.
‘Pick me.’ Pansy said again, ‘We can pretend for a while, then I’ll get caught cheating on you with Blaise or something, then we break it off. That should buy you some time.’
‘It wouldn’t be fair.’ Draco smirked, ‘You must know I played seeker back in school. I can’t see how you can win.’
The man laughed as he went through another door that appeared on a wall and entered a bathroom: ‘It was a close call. Sorting hat hesitated between Gryffindor and Slytherin, and I chose Gryffindor. If I were Slytherin, maybe you would know me better… You would have recognised me by now.’
Draco opened the present carefully, didn’t even tear the wrapping paper. Inside was a red leather box with black velvet lining, on it lied a golden pocket watch that shaped like a flat golden snitch, a golden snitch tie pin, and the other golden snitch cufflink.
This was going nowhere. Harry swore he was trying to make peace with Malfoy, but it’s just too easy to give in to the temptation to abuse his freshly gained upper hand.
Potter closed his eyes and shook his shoulders once, and just like that, the purple chain was shocked into little pieces, the magical wall shattered, and a surprised Draco fell forward right into his embrace.
She looked at him, sighed, leaned down, and took Draco’s head on her knees even more gentle than moments before: ‘I heard a few things from Potter. I was
Potter stopped, raised his hands, palms facing Draco gesturing he’s not going to do anything, the expression of hurt clear on his face, as if a kicked puppy.
He had never thought about crossdressing before, but he knew people weren’t divided by gender to the man, let alone clothes. And beautiful clothes have the appeal beyond the boring division of gender. He wanted to try it, wanted to see the light of admiration in the man’s eyes.
Luna tilted her head as if she didn’t understand him, but she too was used to not understanding people around her, so she just touched at above Draco’s heart as if stroking something there: ‘The heart always tells the truth. You were given so much love that flower of love is blossoming. It’s beautiful. That’s what’s attracting all the arrowbees.’
It’s a half-truth, and he could tell Potter knew that. Instead of calling it out or pushing him, Potter just said: ‘Okay. So, what do you think will happen if I don’t respond to your revenge?’
‘Well, I need to be perfectly sure.’ the man smiled a little wickedly, then looked down on the parchment, ‘I see here that you didn’t give a safe word, was it because you are new to the dom/sub ritual and don’t have one, or…’
‘Of course! Who didn’t!’ Pansy said with a weird tone, while the man looked tense and resigned, ‘I just didn’t recognise him at first. After all, he looked a bit different since school.’
‘Oh, I wasn’t talking about him.’ Lovegood smiled, ‘I was talking about Death. She cared for Harry a bit ten years ago. They had a good relationship. After all, he is the only one that ever collected but never abused her three gifts. Rumor has it she secretly decided not to take his life until he deems he has lived a long and content life —— like in the story, when he willingly takes off his invisibility cloak and greets her as an old friend. Anyway, I’m glad you found your way back from her.’
He had slowed when he got to helping Harry into his left sleeve, as the ring of a scar remained, at last, a circle of paler, smooth scar tissue. He ran the tip of his finger along it, and the tattoo around it.
Potter caught his hand, and for a moment, Draco panicked internally. Did he misread the situation? Salazar, how embarrassing would that be. How could he be so stupid? Potter wouldn’t have wanted him. Not with their history. Not with his mark. He didn’t even know if Potter liked men for Merlin’s sake. Draco put on his best mask and tried to pass it off as some harmless teasing: ‘Scared, Potter?’
Before the scene, Potter taught him the blue spark saw spell used to break the restraints. Breaking Potter’s restraints was easy; Draco had said with contempt that Aurors weren’t such big deals; after all, Potter had smiled resignedly and warned him: ‘That incarceration spell is a strengthened version of
His voice was quivering a little, and he hated that tears are welling up in his eyes and tried to blink them away.
The man took Draco’s wrist between his fingers, gently pried away Draco’s hand, and clad his other hand over the mark: ‘For what it’s worth Malfoy, it is always difficult for everyone to do the right thing. No one is perfect, we all have our moment of fear and weakness, we all just deal with it, make our mistakes and hope we fail better next time. And I doubt even your Saint Potter was able to make the right choice every time.’
They fell silent, then Potter turned Draco’s hand and laced their fingers: ‘Does that mean you’re still marrying me tomorrow?’
And then the sound of Lee Jordan echoed the field: ‘We’re here today for the Quidditch match of Gryffindor against Slytherin! Both were great teams with even odds of winning!’
Draco’s heart jumped at those words. Potter wasn’t exactly good at sweet-talking, everything he said sounded unsophisticated, out of fashion, and an idiot believing in so-called true love, but his words had the power of sincere; it was like presenting a dragon with a heart of gold, the definition of irresistible.
‘You lying to me. Remember?’ The man summoned parchment and quill from the office room, ‘You are going to sit down, and write “I must not tell lies” a hundred lines.’
When the war first ended, everyone was curious what their hero and star would do next. Even as a social outcast at the time, Draco heard Potter got invitations from almost every Quidditch team, and exceptive admission to the Auror division. All the fame, fortune, and power of the wizarding world laid at his feet, yet Potter did none of that.
By then Draco’s arse was spanked thoroughly, burning and throbbing in pain, and despite Potter’s rage, he was methodical, painted Draco’s entire arse with an even and pretty shade of red. He let go of Draco, but Draco was weak at his knees and had to lean on the Firebolt to stand.
‘You don’t like this?’ Harry asked as he teased the pink pucker with the tip of his finger, ‘Don’t like me sucking your cock, don’t like me fucking you with my tongue? Would you let me eat your arse out if I say pretty please?’
‘What if I don’t let you come, Huh? Pet?’ Potter stroked his hair and ear, ‘Do you still want me to fuck you?’
The good news was, they hadn’t thought of searching him, and the hair ring heirloom he was wearing had a few protective charms installed that should prevent him from dying or actually going insane. The bad news was he’s not passing out any time soon because of it, so the torture was unlikely to stop.
Draco was watching mother patching things up with Mrs. Keepin when he felt an arm suddenly around his; then there’s the sugary voice of Pansy: ‘Sorry Mrs. Malfoy. I need to borrow Draco for a moment.’
‘Ding ding ding! Bingo!’ Rosier laughed, ‘I used the chance of searching your apartment to get some of that tracking powder on the heart. The moment its position moved, I activated a transport spell I put on it. I was counting on you using it.’
‘Good for you.’ Draco pursed his thin lips to a tight line at the use of his first name, stubbornly ignored the tingling feeling it brought to him and retorted. But he couldn’t help but looked up and found the man’s eyes mild as spring lake under the sun. Suddenly, he couldn’t look away.
The man just shushed him: ‘Shh… it’s okay, you don’t need to say anything right now. If there’s anything I would like to hear from you, I would get it out of you myself.’
‘Would you be able to answer a few questions for me?’ The man said, his hands now stroking light and unnecessary circles on Draco’s arse, cupping his arsecheeks in both hands in a very distracting way, ‘It always helps to talk about the scene so improvements can be made.’
‘Unfortunately, that is not how this works.’ the man said, his looks a bit stern, ‘You will need to pick a safe word before we start.’
‘What are you going to do if I tell you, huh?’ Draco asked, ‘Duel Potter? Kill him? For what, revenge for Tom psycho Riddle?’
Sometimes when Harry looked at her, he would think that since he looked exactly like James Potter, him standing with Ginny would look just like his parents, and maybe, they would be a happy couple like his parents, they would have the life his parents were supposed to have but never had, they would have kids that looked exactly like James and Lily, and he would name them James and Lily, so that maybe he would be able to get back what was lost, what was supposed to be his.
After years of friendship with Pansy, Draco knew when to listen to her. He smiled to mother and let Pansy pull him away, though once they were away from the crowd, he asked irritated —— more irritated than he used to be: ‘What? I was about to charm Mrs. Keepin into grounding her son and maybe kick him out of her will. This better not be some fight with Blaise because I will…’
As the party planner, Draco had to deal with all kinds of emergencies, so he placed his seat right next to the exit, and it came rather convenient for this sudden situation. The man didn’t take him away, which was appreciated, so Draco could still keep an eye on the event to some extent, especially as the next speaker is Potter.
‘And I would like to keep it that way.’ Draco tried to pretend everything was fine by taking on a joking tone, ‘I don’t want to seem pushy. We have just barely became friends. I can’t just go and tell him “hey, I was crazy in love with you back in school, you know, when I was bullying you. And by the way, that’s why I bullied you”.’
He tone was light, then it went cold. Draco didn’t think the man had lied when he said he got over it a long time ago, but it was not fully behind him. Somehow, he felt he had to ask: ‘What do you mean by different…?’
For a moment there, Draco had forgotten who they had become, and felt as if they were just students of Hogwarts, close friends, and were wandering the hallway after curfew, secretly laughing at pranks they just pulled.
The man laughed: ‘The last time you saw him play was more than a decade ago. It’s not fair to make such a comparison.’
‘Oh for Merlin’s sake just fuck me already! It’s not like I have hymen or anything, and even that shouldn’t matter. Virginity is overrated anyway.’ Draco pulled the man back against him; his half-hard cock rubbed against the man’s shamelessly, ‘I can handle your roughness. I’m not going to scream for rape afterwards if that’s what you are afraid of.’
Draco closed his eyes. Crabbe lost everything. If he were ever found alive by the wizarding world, he would be confined in Azkaban for the rest of his life or even get kissed, and even if he managed to escape to muggle society, he could hardly have a life with scars like that. His life was at a dead-end when his mother died three years ago —— she must have kept him hidden and taken care of him all those years, didn’t have the heart to lock her wounded son in Azkaban, and trusted him to her best friend, Mrs. Rosier, after her death.
But he knew what he had to do. What he want to do. Even if no one other than himself would know he made such effort. Even if that effort couldn’t change the past, and seemed trivial to what he did.
Draco had gotten quite used to his ferret ears and tails by now, and he flapped his ears or swayed his tail every now and then to catch Harry’s eyes.
‘Um, no.’ The man said, ‘I don’t think Potter was the save for sex kind. He always favoured serious relationship.’
And though he had a box full of his favourite desserts, Draco lost his appetite. The man leaned down and kissed him, his voice as soft as possible, and his frown wrinkled Draco’s heart: ‘Please believe me, that there’s nothing I want in the world more than I want you to be happy, and I hope I can be the person that makes you happy. Please remember this.’
Among the chaos, Harry felt Hermione's hand on the back of his, her voice soft as a feather: 'You will also have yours one day, Harry.'
And the dungeon was finally calm, only the sound of panting from all parties could be heard; Potter collapsed into Draco’s laps the next moment; Draco barely managed to catch him, had to lean on the wall to support himself. Still, he tried his best to cast two tourniquet spells on Potter, and combed his fingers through Potter’s hair.
Aside from that, Draco still couldn’t help but think —— What would Potter think? Did he think that Draco’s apology was just part of a ruse to kill him?
He could see the young Potter, not knowing he had Draco’s heart at his feet, looking at him with those cold emerald eyes, telling him:
The Omega didn’t know what Harry was doing, and was startled when Harry gave his shaft a lick, then took it all the way down his throat.
The event was held on December 19th, the last Friday before Christmas holiday. Guess even politicians didn’t want to spend Christmas away from their family. Draco was standing on the second floor of the ballroom, right above the entrance, when there were blinding wand-lights and Potter’s presence was announced. He stood there with champagne in one hand, watching with boredom as the entire room went quiet and looked to the entrance at the announcement. He could understand now. How all this didn’t mean anything to Potter, how the flattery words, courteous smiles and spot light were just white noises, fake masks and unwanted attention.
Draco looked over and saw an evil-looking purple magic circle on the ground; it’s drawing complicated and unfamiliar.
Draco fought to keep down the urge to rebel. He doesn’t think very highly of himself when it comes to endure pain. So he put some effort into trying to strip as fast as he can as the man started to count, but soon he knew it was a lost battle.
Ruby narrowed her eyes, then slapped Draco on his thigh: ‘Go clear your head before you do anything you’ll regret later.’
The man stared at him with those vibrant green eyes of his, but then the golden snitch flew right between them, and soured to the sky. They looked back at each other for a second, then both scrambled to get on their brooms and chased after it.
If Draco were to name the least favourite part of the days he spent with the man, he would have to say that it would be when the man would force Draco to kneel and state his misbehaviours before his reminder spankings.
‘Can say the same thing for Potter too.’ Draco said, ‘You all came to his rescue at the first notice.’
‘At least… at least I should get to touch you one more time, hug you one more time, kiss you one more time… Merlin, what did I do to deserve this.’
How? But Draco didn’t want to know. He didn’t want to think about Potter anymore. The man sounded tired too, so Draco kissed him and followed without protest.
Draco lied on the man’s lap, covering his eyes with his hand: ‘I… I can’t. I don’t want to… I don’t want to sink deeper into this than I already do. He will never… I’m not worth it. It felt better when he hated me. Being friends… he’s just too nice. He can’t be seriously trying to be friends with me. And the hope. It’s excruciating.’
Potter noticed his weird mood, carefully took a step back, looked down at the back of his hand and said: ‘You said… you said you are dating someone.’
Draco flinched at that, he apparently stalled for too long, as Potter reached his limit of indulgence, spelled away his cape and shirt, leaving on his gauntlets, boots, cup, pants and underwear that were pulled down to his knees, and strung him back up.
If mother was suspicious, she let it slide. Just gave Draco the present she and father prepared for him along with a soft smile: ‘Well then, I’ll leave you to your presents.’
Reasonable, Draco would say. His hair was messy enough to be mistaken as a bird’s nest after a night’s sleep.
Draco nodded and fell silent. He looked around and found they were on a strangely familiar street, but he couldn’t put his finger on it. Potter noticed his confusion, and as he tapped his toe cap on the pavement twice, the building across the street shifted to reveal the infamous Number Twelve Grimmauld Place where his mother grew up.
‘I work here, and you… you are a client. Although what we had were consensual, you are mostly paying for the matchmaking, the room, and my time and expertise.’ The man said, his tone tentative, ‘Most of the Doms here are not in need of money. This is just a place where they meet the like minded. Some of the them just rent the rooms from the owner to play with their own sub —— someone they claim as their own. Similar to a man keeping a pet, some keep several, some only has one.’
Sugarball wiped his face with a handkerchief and introduced nervously: ‘This is Mr. Malfoy. The planner of the Yule Ball. This is Mr. Weasley. Mr. Potter’s personal security contractor.’
‘I know.’ Potter said, his fingers clumsily fidgeting the invisibility cloak, ‘But I guess it’s just what I do —— How are you feeling? Forgecount said you took more than a dozen Crucios.’
Fuck! Was this the ‘Weasley is Our King’ game? He couldn’t tell because the glamours were all legal age.
Father nodded and turned to leave. But before he opened the door, he hesitated, his face half turned back; Draco could almost see his perfect Malfoy mask crumbling: ‘You… you take care. As long as you are happy, son.’
Draco couldn’t. Harry was the name he called during his sex with the man, through his orgasms with the man, just the mere thought of that name aroused him, he couldn’t help but clenched his hole, and the silver ball shifted inside him, he had to bite down on his lips to stop himself from moaning.
The two-headed snake hissed at the command, and the two black dragons flew up into the air, circled solemnly until they settled, one on each side of Draco’s.
Draco felt better after a little while, he forced out a laugh: ‘New definition for a new notch in your belt?’
Draco didn’t say anything, and the waiter interrupted at that moment to hand out the menu. Draco hid his face behind it, couldn’t really read a word.
‘Because I didn’t take care of myself.’ Draco suppressed a groan, the unresisting mindset temporarily brought on by the earlier interactions faded, he was feeling irritated and frustrated now, ‘But honestly Potter, why in the name of Merlin do you care? You are the one put the welts on me in the first place. Can’t you just… I don’t know, not care? Don’t you like the idea of me hurting even outside of this club?’
Someone got a bloody picture of Potter helping him get off the hippogriff, and it got plastered over almost all the front page of newspapers and magazines. It was a very nice shot, bloody romantic even, as there’s moon, star, hippogriff, and Potter was smiling. Draco’s head was lowered, and it could easily be mistaken as shy.
Draco ordered his firewhiskey, Potter raised his hand with a Galleon between his fingers and took his tab, Draco hesitated for a moment, not sure what possessed him, but he took his glass and slipped into the seat next to Potter.
‘Now the game is getting more and more intense! The seekers are closing in on the snitch, and there’s no telling who will catch it!’
It had been a while since the wall was used, banned by Dumbledore during his time as Headmaster, but rumor has it that one Omega has been using it for a few months now——a very attractive male Omega.
‘I’m giving them to you because I trust you would lead the Malfoy family to the best road, a road of glory and prosperity.’ Father said in that dragging tone of his, ‘I recognise you as my successor, the new Head of the Malfoy family, and I… I give you my full loyalty and respect.’
‘Well, go on!’ Draco pointed to the door, ‘I was enjoying the road trip with my boyfriend before you two barged in.’
Right now, he didn’t care. The man could want Draco’s heart, and Draco would serve it in a silver platter for him to cherish or break into a million pieces. He didn’t care.
‘You would check me into a loony bin before believing me that he was Potter.’ Pansy shrugged, ‘And it wasn’t my place to tell you.’
Draco could barely grab his knees when the man pulled the three balls out of him and stuck his tongue into Draco’s hole just as Draco was clenching and sucking in reflectively, the feeling of having a tongue inside him was greatly different when it was some lifeless toy or just the fingers, and Merlin that tongue was strong and lively twisting and licking inside him in the most dirty and arousing way possible.
'You say that now.' Ron said as he added another cream roll to her plate with a serious look on his face, 'But I'm telling you, you will feel hungry before you finish the runes. Please don't starve my beautiful wife.'
"Don't be too disappointed, Chartres. You know as well as I that you are not suited for the position of Head. Catherine would not have allowed it."
So the Shack became the Shrieking Shack because, once again, those in the know failed to educate the blind.
The elf hissed back, hatred written across its every line, before tugging back an ear and growling at the floor.
"That explains many, many things, including why muggles' and half-bloods' aren't allowed here." Blaise noted.
"We may discuss the semantics of a siblings' relationship once you discover how long a grudge you will be able to hold against Luna."
He ran down the underground ramp edging around the corner of the third passage through the elves' quarters in case of a professor.
"Susan," Amelia Bones turned to her niece, "I will have a word with you later. Take your friends back to Hogwarts."
"There isn't much time. We should have started with this, Vivian, and began their magic studies later."
The three glared at each other in a impasse, Draco's magic humming along his arm, to his hands, with but the words on his mouth to cover the wordless magic.
"How dare you inform me such an important matter before dawn. Didn't I tell you anything crossing an expression in the morning would leave marks on my skin? Look, you've given me a wrinkle. Here!"
"Malfoy, your fucking owl just shoved a spoonful of soup up Harry Potter's nose. Malfoy. Oi, Malfoy!"
He then, quite unexpectedly, took Granger's bag on her behalf and patted her back to the nearest room, which happened to be the library. He sent Draco a gaze, and it was then Draco realised Blaise was acting the part of a gentleman Pansy had drilled into his conscience in a way of brainwashing. Draco was too resilient for her, but Blaise and Pansy had been eager to inflict each other with mental harm.
"Not those boring enchantments, he's talking about the ones which makes those candles float and disappear at will." Blaise added.
He tore through the stands, opposite the surging crowd's allure to Harry Potter's collapsed form, and in a grit of annoyance, drew his hands forwards to clear a path before remembering his wand. Ceasing his attempt entirely, he shoved his path open.
At the behest of their parents the children took a tentative step forward. They were fewer in number as many had turned to Hogwarts or Beauxbatons after the disappearance of Voldemort, as much as Durmstrang was reputed to be of the dark and the Boy-Who-Lived of the light. The only reason why they hadn't ceased entirely was in most, the participation Vivian had made in stabilising Durmstrang itself, mostly through Narcissa in word of mouth.
Draco considered the ringing words for more as he rubbed his forehead, then reaching to untie his bound curtains around his bed and dissolving the silencing spell, before the entire structure, both magical and physical, was torn apart by force.
of the children were led out of the castle in rows under the protective eyes of the graduating year. Draco and Luna were at the lake, quietly watching the surface shimmed underneath the morning sunlight. They held a book between them, and were quietly fighting over the finances of lodging.
She was a weaver of society, a fine retainer of people, considering the many acquaintances she could pull out of their occupations and friends to be called from afar. There was one little man from Bulgaria who made his way over to the courtroom when Narcissa demanded a last-minute witness in less than three seconds without knowing what he was walking into. And if that little man had lost some of his composure, Vivian would not have been leafing through papers for an additional day, but alas he was all professional and sharp, and Vivian had to delay the official hearing. Most importantly, she was Narcissa Black, with a house name to her blood and more respect within all things magical.
Draco scowled and made to open his mouth, but Luna, not looking up from the book, slapped her hand over his mouth, or rather over his nose, and continued.
Cedric looked as though he didn't want to be there at all, but he was, mostly out of responsibility for the company he deemed too young. Draco wondered if he felt sympathetic to the Weasley family. The fireplace crackled right beside him, and in the cozy armchair, Draco's mind wandered to the newspaper he'd seen when he first arrived at Hogwarts, trampled by many small feet, to at least re-read the publication on Sirius Black's escape. His body detested the idea of moving, however, so he remained settled in his armchair sending silent stares to Luna, who was lying down on the floor with her arms and legs stretched towards the ceiling.
Draco held his tongue, despite the urge to point out how she had garnered even more attention by the following words. From the dementors to the Thestrals, and even the professor, Hogwarts was becoming even more a loud, obnoxious irritation on his skin. They followed the professor through corridors with low whispers.
"This isn't a playground. If you need to discipline someone, I suggest you ask your headmaster. The Auror office isn't for people who've lost their way."
"He calls himself a Headmaster," Draco said in the walls free of portraits, in a voice less than a whisper, "when he has more than an inconvenience in favouritism."
Draco began to put away his belongings, and even took the girl's parchment of her project to his bag.
"He is a traitor of this family," Kreacher cried, "he has no care for the Most Noble and Ancient House of Black!"
Narcissa would have dropped the cup in her hands had she not been standing, for a split moment she had thought of her son in the castle, but as soon as her thought had completed its course she curled her hands tighter around the handle with relief. Her son had gone to Durmstrang, Narcissa recalled.
"From what I've been told, you're implying Draco had been in Durmstrang since he was five. Wasn't that too young an age for you, Draco?"
He really had, Draco considered, because words didn't work on Nott, Crabbe and the Carrows. Draco hadn't the patience to sway them, but Flint had, despite this year being his last. Although, in return, Draco had helped Flint understand several subjects so as to not repeat a second year.
Her boundless energy never seemed to drain, Vivian thought wryly. But watching Narcissa emerge from the door Vivian displaced Millicent's elbow briefly before turning towards the blond-haired woman.
Whoever that elf was, she wasn't bound to the house. Erlnier could feel no hereditary magic radiating off her no matter how he concentrated. Instead he felt a distinct magic signature from her. Unlike Kreacher, who served the House of Black for generations and tried to uphold its values by trusting Regulus Black, she was bound under ownership loyal to none but one. And it wasn't Bartemius Crouch.
Catherine was startled at the request of her own opinion, because she did, as a matter of fact, respect Vivian and had placed her on a pedestal. But she did snap immediately at Vivian's hesitant inquiry.
"I think you are mistaking my oversight on a probability as an intended manipulation," Vivian mused, "I only offered him a taste of what lies ahead of him."
It was a sigh of boredom to its utmost. Vivian felt her fingers twitch. Narcissa had seen her for the past three months they were past acquaintances, and reigning in her body language was becoming harder the more fonder Vivian saw Narcissa's stone face to be. Although fond may not be the most adept description.
Thankfully the Ministry cleared Draco’s apartment just the day before —— much to Elise’s belief that it was because they had to go through her boss’s closet. Or a closet room to be precise. After sitting on Draco’s couch for the entire afternoon and a few glasses of wine, she finally managed to help Draco narrow it down to a pale dark green waistcoat with black suit pants and tie and blackish green robe, and a set of cream coloured waistcoat, tie and suit pants.
He turned around, grabbed the Omega’s arse and parted the cheeks. The Omega didn’t react at first, thinking Harry was going to fuck him as he always do. He shivered as Harry first ran his tongue quickly over his hole, not yet understanding what had happened, but as soon as Harry started licking and sucking at his hole, and he realised what Harry was doing, he trembled so hard and reached his hand back to stop Harry.
Mother, as always, was glad to see him. Even father looked a bit easier for it’s going to be his birthday, going on and on about Draco getting his recognition tomorrow, leaving off his usual comments about changes he didn’t like. After all, their parenting had always been very spoiling.
Pansy and Blaise looked like they are perfectly fine without them anyway. Pansy wore a simple but elegant black dress, of the latest fashion no doubt, complimented her curves perfectly, and Blaise looked like he very much wanted to slip his hand up that dress, despite looking like a gentleman with his dark green suit and tie.
Thinking about that, he opened a velvet box and picked out a bracelet. A silver bracelet decorated with diamonds and emeralds, which he snatched from the full set the man gave him as new year’s present. It fit right in with his attire, and it gave him some comfort to wear the symbol of the man’s claim.
But then, the snitch moved just a little closer, the wind stirred by its wings alerted Potter, Draco had a moment of panic as they were still several feet above ground and Draco would definitely break a few bones if he fell, but Potter let go of his broom and forwent the snitch without blinking, reached out both of his hands and caught Draco firmly in his arms as Draco caught the snitch.
If he were younger, Draco would have so much fun mocking that one sentence. Of course Potter would have personal security. And Weasley would happily be his bodyguard. And Potter’s security being a manchild working at a joke shop. But it actually made a lot of sense. Even with Granger as the rising star in the Ministry of Magic, politics were still complicated and revolting. The Ministry couldn’t be trusted to always put Potter’s well-being in the first place. And Weasley, despite Potter stealing all the spotlight, was probably one of the most powerful wizard alive too. The Weasley Joke Shop also had a lot of inventions beyond imagination. Not to mention the years of friendship with deep trust. It’s a logical and wise choice of security contract.
Draco breathed out shakily as the last strike landed, he heard Potter whispering to someone, then his hair was pulled to make him turn his head. From the corner of his eye, he saw one of the Doms he flirted with picked up a regular cane; then Potter easily summoned it through the curtain as if the curtain wasn’t tangible.
Whoever cast it was a decent wizard; breaking free wouldn’t be a problem with his wand, but now it’s impossible. Draco can get the wizard's general power level from the strength of the restraints —— slightly less than himself, not to brag.
‘She had what I wanted, and she didn’t do him justice, that’s all.’ Draco said, tilting his head, thinking back hard, ‘Really, I don’t remember any James on the team, and I was a good captain and paid close attention to all Quidditch team. Well, except for Hufflepuff. No offence but they really didn’t have any chance.’
‘He’s pureblood, blond, get it?’ Draco managed to irritate the perfectly composed Potter even under a hostage situation, Potter was even blushing, ‘I had a type. I couldn’t possibly know Draco sodding Malfoy would have been a better date, could I.’
‘I kind of scheduled a dinner with Granger; I hope you don’t mind.’ Draco said as he looked into those emerald eyes, ‘It might be a bit stupid to explain, but, I’m not a blood supremacist. Rather, I find any discrimination based on what people are born with ridiculous. I don’t think father is a blood supremacist either; he just chose to use it to maximise benefits for himself. And I chose not to walk that path.’
He could almost see that pale, lifeless face, the crazy, empty eyes, that voice that sounded like a snake slithered over the ground, and that presence, cold and wet against his mental wall.
‘Um, I’m not leaving by train.’ Potter said, quite politely actually, as if nothing embarrassing had happened, Draco thought he was trying to be polite as he turned Draco down, but he wasn’t, ‘I’m… Actually, come. I’ll show you.’
‘I know, I know.’ Potter said, his emerald eyes flickering a little, ‘I just want to…hold you for the night, and maybe talk a little bit before that——Since we just got engaged, and today is your birthday.’
The man laid Draco down on the couch on his stomach, sat down by Draco’s thigh and summoned a engraved and charmed wooden box full of aftercare stuff, took out two soft blankets to cover Draco’s upper body and legs, baring only his arse.
Due to his reputation as a defense lawyer and his tendency to use loopholes in the current laws to help his clients, the Malfoy name was once more tarnished though their vaults where once more overflowing.
Draco had a sunny weather charm cast, and held the party outdoors with blankets on rich grass to lie on and buffet in picnic baskets, as there’s nothing better to celebrate life with sunshine, blue sky, lazy clouds and lively greens. It was as informal as it could be, but enjoyable and good for bounding.
‘Not when it’s a Firebolt, no.’ Draco kissed him again, ‘Anyway, it’s at Hogwarts. And it’s not just me. Consider it a joint effort of a few friends of yours.’
He moved and opened the door, found himself in a small closed space, and saw Potter sitting with his legs crossed and hands folded on his knees, on a chair that was against another door right across from Draco.
It just felt too much like there’s no one else there. All Draco could see was that handsome face and those emerald eyes, so green and as if talking to him. His heart just wouldn’t be still whenever he sees him, and Draco just hated that.
Literally, skipped a beat, because the monitoring spell went off at that, they could hear footsteps down the hallway and Ziegler shouting: ‘
He admired his bite marks on the pale arse, sucked a few hickies too till that beautiful arse and long lean thighs was a mess of red and purple. He felt guilty and pleased at the sight, the pretty, almost holy arse of the prestigious bastard bit and sucked, marked and ruined all over by him, he wonder what the young master would feel when he look into the mirror tonight, seeing his arse and thigh trumped by Harry.
‘You know I can’t.’ Potter said; the bastard didn’t dare look at Draco’s eyes. ‘It’s my fault. I should have protected you better. I’m not leaving.’
‘So you had an entirely different childhood than the real Potter. I’m sure he grew up like a prince, worshipped probably, wherever Dumbledore hid him. Might be good for you though. I think you would make a better Potter.’ Draco tried to conciliate the man in his way, ‘Did you ever get replaced with a better family?’
‘You um, you remember in fifth year, I kind of caused a lot of damage to the Department of Mysteries?’ Harry asked.
A little would be an understatement. But Draco was willing, even though he couldn’t stop whimpering: ‘Yes, sir.’
The next morning started with sunshine and a busy breakfast. Sunshine had been somewhat of a rarity to life in Hogwarts, maybe it's just the weather there, but Harry suspected it was more that he stopped noticing things like that ever since fifth year, with the shadow of Voldemort and death looming over.
went off, hundreds of those bloody fireworks of Weasley Wizard Wheeze lit up the entire auditorium, all colours bursting out and burning brightwave after wave. There’s joy and laughter and chaos everywhere.
The man sighed, put down the fork and answered: ‘Yes. Back then, I was small, so it was enough space for me. They moved me up here after Hogwarts sent me admission letters with the cupboard listed as my address.’
Great. Draco thought. Another ex of Potter’s. He’s getting PTSD with them. Nothing good ever happens whenever they meet any one of them. Maybe that’s why they never worked out; all of them are literally star crossed with Potter. Not Draco, that he knew. He might have calculated a few times, or a few dozen times, when they first got into astrology. He kind of calculated all of Potter’s exes and potential partners. Draco is definitely the best constellation for Potter.
‘Thanks. I guess.’ The man smiled a little, ‘I just never met anyone compatible. Every sub I met was never just right, always too much there or not enough here. I didn’t think it would be fair to take on the responsibility of taking care of someone if I couldn’t be fully devoted. And I had a lot of issues to work with. I used to have nightmares every night. Now I’m not very sure. Sometimes I would wake up exhausted, but I don’t have roommates now, so no one can wake me or tell me for sure.’
Luna smiled at that: ‘I knew you would understand. You always understand him better than anyone else.’
Potter chucked and looked at Draco, his emerald gaze suddenly intense: ‘I never gave it much thinking back then, but… it is your wand, it sees you as it’s only master, there’s no way I could use it so easily if you hadn’t wanted it to protect me, to fight for me, and it had to be some strong wish.’
"Oh, Amelia! Amelia, it's been such a while." The rat paled as he took in the situation. "I can explain, let me explain. There's a misunderstanding here, somewhere, you must hear me out!"
"Pansy," Draco blinked slowly, which was equivalent to a roll of his eyes, "if Amelia Bones finds you as important in the matter of family heritage, she will be contacting you soon."
"Sirius Black was standing right next to him when he woke up. He was raising a knife, and was about to stab, but Ron screamed so loudly he ran, or rather, disappeared." Hermione paused. "But why Ron?"
"She flips through piles of paper like they're nothing and finds the most important papers with a glance. I've seen her look through the monstrosity she called her desk and pull just her homework out within seconds. Her aunt, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, apparently gives her sessions on Defence Against the Dark Arts, and office work. Her internship is as well as secured."
No. Draco remembered. No, not safe word. He did something terribly wrong, and he deserve the punishment. He shouldn’t just coward out the way he always did with almost everything in his life. He need to take his punishment.
‘I don’t need to.’ Rosier said, green light-condensing at the tip of his wand, ‘No matter how strong Harry is, he can’t be faster with my wand at your throat. I just have to persuade him into stepping into that magic circle over there.’
Mother tried her best to redecorate the manor, but it was too big a house for only three people who had very little to talk about. To avoid conflict, Draco had got into the tradition of staying only for dinner and breakfast. He would have a quick dinner, retire to his room, and leave right after breakfast.
‘I know you didn’t I.’ Draco stared at the kidnapper, ‘You chose Forgecount specifically because he wouldn’t talk to me, and you wouldn’t talk right now because you don’t want me to know who you are. That means… I know you really well, didn’t I.’
‘Hi, Draco.’ Lovegood sang as she cast her checking spell, ‘You had a close encounter with Harry’s old friend.’
‘I even wanted to stay away; I tried cancelling our appointments, but then you… Merlin, you came, and you told me you were in love with me.’
‘Um, you are not.’ Rosier grimaced, ‘I said you have three days to think about it —— I meant three days in Azkaban. Courtesy of Mr. Keepin. Apparently, the Keepin family was very concerned with the well-being of our saviour, and greased the wheels for denying your bail and arranging your death penalty hearing after three days. Sorry.’
The man smiled hesitantly and shook his head: ‘Um, no. I apologise. I just never… never much got the idea of how everyone seemed to think this could mean a new start.’
It’s probably the most childish thing Harry had ever done since… since Draco managed to provoke him in second year. It’s a beautiful tattoo, thorns and roses that Harry told him that reminded him of Draco. Draco knew Harry made a ridiculously big deal about it, making it some kind of scar-turned-medal as proof of his “love” and heroically saving Draco, partly to make Draco feel better about that permanent terrible scar.
The attendants managed to get a few accordion, piper and the like to work, and some of them danced as the others laughed and clapped to the rhythm. Draco would have danced, if his arse wasn’t hurting just by colliding with his tailored pants and made his pants suspiciously tight at that,
Draco felt embarrassed, but he didn’t want to let go: ‘Listen, I know we’re not friends or anything. You probably didn’t even like me. But… I’m sorry someone did that to you when you were so little. They shouldn’t have done that. You didn’t deserve that. Nobody deserves that. I… I don’t know. I…’
He wanted the day to come so he could be done with it, but when it finally came, he almost regretted.
Potter rolled up his sleeves and loosened a few buttons. Even though Draco couldn’t look up, that casual charm of Potter’s was still stunning; he looked like a dragon rider preparing himself before taming a wild dragon, fitting really, as he was wearing black leather pants and knee-high boots, probably just got off his broom.
Something cool sprinkled on him. Draco looked up, and a tender branch of mistletoe was growing from the ceiling, its leaves stretching proudly, red fruit dangling, sprinkling golden dusts onto Draco’s hair.
He took one of the pale, slender hand in his, played it for a few seconds, letting blood stopped by the hard grip flush it, before he said: ‘Squeeze my hand if you are up for another round.’
It was different from the usual way Potter spanked Draco, as the goal was no longer play and arousal but harsh punishment. It didn’t mean it wasn’t arousing, just a lot more shameful and really, really painful, so much that Draco felt he couldn’t take it. He hadn’t even felt this way last time Potter spanked him a thousand times.
‘Pick me.’ Pansy interrupted Draco, she was also quite stunning today, with her black slit silk dress and sapphire necklace, probably to promote her design, and her eyes are now bright and determined, shutting Draco up immediately, ‘I talked to a few girls that got invited, and found out your father is about to sandbag you. He had told the others that this would also be your engagement party —— he’s going to ask you to pick your fiancé out from the crowd for the opening dance. Yes. I know as well as you do that you don’t have one, but you will be forced to pick one, and whoever you pick will automatically become your fiancé.’
Narcissa Malfoy, albeit too spoiling, was the perfect mother. That may have resulted in Draco being a brat and bully back in school, but it also gave him an incredible sense of security and the emotional capacity to love given a chance. He remembered how mother used to tell him bedtime stories, tug him in and kiss his forehead every night before he went to Hogwarts, the tiny disappointment mother showed when he came back from Hogwarts for the first night and declared he was too old for goodnight kisses, and how he missed them the first nights without.
Draco had a new focus now. He reached to place his hand on the man’s thigh, smiling warmly and playfully: ‘I’m sure you’ll feel better having a warm body next to you.’
‘Who was he?’ Draco knew he probably shouldn’t probe, but his curiosity was killing him. He, unfortunately, didn’t have the self-control the man had.
‘He was a great headmaster.’ Draco said, his dug his finger nails into his palm, and tried to push other thoughts away, ‘He had something much more important and horribly dark planned for Potter, so he had to honeytrap Potter into leading his young, inexperienced and vulnerable little friends to fight darkness far bigger than them, to fight the most dangerous dark wizard since his damned ex-boyfriend. A fucking House Cup was nothing compared to everything else and the bigger picture. But that doesn’t change the fact that he stole the House Cup from us that year. So, a horrible headmaster too. Screwed up my trust in fair game completely. And I hated him for it for a whole year.’
’ Draco said with widened eyes, ‘Merlin you weren’t kidding when you said you could pass as a house elf.’
He lined himself up and thrust in with one swift motion, forcefully plunging through the tight and slick hole and hit right at the sweet spot, feeling the Omega clenching down at him, but kept fucking with a brutal force.
The hands that were grabbing the silver bar was where he could tell a little reaction of the Omega from, they were holding on rigidly, like he didn’t dare let go, afraid of what he would do if that ever happened, but he also didn’t want to grip too hard, afraid he would give away too much that way too.
‘And I just kind of… lost it after that.’ Potter said, huffing a sarcastic laugh, ‘That night of New Year’s Eve, I forgot I wasn’t using my own name and face when you looked at me, smiling, in the snow. So I kissed you. As ridiculous as this may sound, sometimes I had to remind myself I am the real Harry Potter, because it was so easy to forget everything when I was with you, I forget my name, my face, my past, all that’s left were my instincts, and they just ache for you…’
Potter started the spanking again, the same firm and steady slaps, Draco was indeed able to writhe and kick all he want, but soon he realised he was being taunted, as no matter how hard he struggled, the slaps always landed at Potter’s intended spot with the same force. There was no escaping the punishment.
call me professor Vean. I am also in charge of the Quidditch team, a referee, and also happen to teach a few Arithmancy classes. I'm afraid we will not be on any brooms this week, unfortunately, because we're to discuss the scientific details of a broom's manoeuvre, the charms that can or cannot be applied to a broom, and how a broom is made.
Hogwarts, however, had been strange when he first arrived, and was yet a stranger around his shoulders like clinging mud as he climbed up a flight of stairs. The raven of Ravenclaw peered down at his height, which was still smaller than its beak at 165cm.
"No. Master Regulus promised Kreacher to secrecy. But Kreacher is not sworn. Not to those of the Black family."
"Your belief that people grow by experience has finally led your own ward to his destruction," Catherine said as she finally watched the psychopath before her, "at least you did not kill him outright." She whispered.
"My mother told me otherwise. She spoke highly of your kindness, but foolish actions. You were kind to those younger than you, but deemed those representative of your family's traditions lower. Biased against the darker side of society, but favorable to those who were of better conditions."
Luna dragged him out onto the street. There wasn't much in broad daylight, where people were off at work and most elders were gossiping in rocking chairs. She crouched next to a narrow storm drain and pointed.
"Agreed." Draco said immediately, "I don't know how I missed this." He whispered in a smaller voice, "we will be staying at-"
"Oh? I'd supposed but not been certain. It was supposed to be my eighth question. Regardless, out of my good heart, madam. One more galleon."
"But I am afraid there had been a miscommunication, somewhere between our exchange. It is a rite of Hogwarts to greet students by the Sorting Hat. It appears, to me, that I have failed to mention the need for such tradition to be upheld."
As they picked apart his memory one by one, he found that he couldn't hold his breakfast, and even after they enlisted the help of Pot with the towels clinging to his talons, they went through another round of emptying the tea in his stomach before Draco could settle.
"Yes. Blacks. Sometimes I wonder if magic itself had twisted their genetics into becoming a stubborn breed. Like hounds, that house, one bite and they never let go."
"Malfoy manor stands on a point of dissent. Hogwarts' grounds are protected by points of headstones. Durmstrang is protected by a congregation of weather. But they're all intertwined, to cover the society and people which lie between. Each and every sentient building of a magical society has a part to play in the concealment, which used to involve your house, until it was corrupted entirely by intent. You could say, in fact, that your house would be the easiest to enter even with wards in place by your own hands, by wizards and muggles alike. Weasleys have long lost the qualifications of pure-blood rituals."
"We'll follow this disgusting imagination against my skin, then." Pansy concluded, and her words held more weight than most.
"I've found it more surprising that there hasn't been a mention of Hogwarts at all. Especially when all our parents have been informed of our lockdown but has resorted to letters instead of pressuring Dumbledore."
Jason looked up from the book, "he also used another channel to visit, as there weren't any records of portkeys under his name, unless made illegally. Are you following?"
"Why, yes. I will respect your decision if you wish it so. But let me ask you aside, didn't you want to see the Boy-Who-Lived with your very eyes? I must have told you he would attend Hogwarts at the same time you'd begin your education."
"I'm no legilimens," Matthew snarled, "drop that. What a nasty habit you've got there. Olphey, bring some truffles please."
"It was horrible." Draco complained, "although it's Marcus' fault for being drunk and ruining the party wholly, if only he abstained from pointing out such facts before the holidays. I doubt anyone would be able to make a positive goal next year, and the war's around the corner."
Upon receiving it Draco was grateful, yet knew such 'influence' his mother had passed on in her message was not something he wished to gain through the means of a sport. He had the Pavilion, and several older students he remained friendly with. Besides, Aerodynamics included more information handling of calculating a body's synchronisation with magic, a lesson on positions and strategies on the broom at a lower height for the first few weeks, that he felt it rather unnecessary.
"This is how you hold it, Draco," Jason said as he pried the knife out of his hands and held it up by its ends, "wrap your hands around, make a firm grip. Firm enough so as the handle settles in your palm, but not to strong for the blade to tremble. Luna, here."
‘I take it you know.’ Pansy said as she threw herself on Draco’s bed by his side, helping him sit up by piling pillows behind his back.
‘No. You misunderstood me.’ Potter quickly explained, he frowned and thought for a moment, but then he said: ‘When we first saved Buckbeak, we had him stashed at Grimmauld Place. But then he needed care, so we had to get him back so Hagrid could take care of him. We couldn’t have him back as Buckbeak, so we renamed it Witherwings.’
‘Well,’ Draco said, ‘He said he didn’t want to die alone, and I agreed that I would marry him if we were both single on the day before his 35
On the eighth strike, Potter stroked his back lightly, as if comforting and complimenting him again, and that somehow gave him the courage to continue.
She must have misunderstood Draco’s behaviour as retribution for Potter not wanting to commit. But she quickly realised, then said: ‘So I’m wrong then. Regardless, he is a troubled man, but among the Doms I met, he also worked the hardest against his problems, and he’s very invested in you, so I hope… I hope you’ll be the right one for him.’
Harry had looked at Draco intensely as Draco attended every fold of the robe and the accessories. Understandable, as Draco was fully naked save for the leather collar on his neck and cuffs on his wrists and ankles, they were connected together with chains that rattled lightly as he moved, and he had ferret ears, and a tail that Harry had spelled on him from last night, his arsehole would be leaking Harry’s cum if it weren’t for the crystal plug.
The man didn’t finish, and he didn’t need to. The earlier injustice Draco suffered from the Aurors, the near escape of the Dementors and Azkaban, and the years he spent in cold eyes and fought to be recognised, the nights he spent hating and mutilating the mark, all came back to him, and Draco cried to the man’s chest as he stroked Draco’s hair.
Just as he left the Headmistress’s office and ran down the hallway, he saw the man turn over a corner and ran after him, caught him by his hand and said seductively: ‘There you are. I’ve been searching everywhere for you.’
‘She’s getting insanely big. I hope the little guy would be considerate and get out sooner.’ Neville couldn’t help but smiled.
Right now, Draco was wearing his newly tailored school uniform, kneeling on a L-shaped platform, supporting himself with his knees and elbows. Potter had specifically demanded him to hold the memory ball in both hands and look at it. Which was a shame because Potter pulled off that Gryffindor uniform so well. They didn’t use any de-aging potion today, as Draco felt it would bring back too many old memories. But seeing a twenty-seven-year-old Potter dressed in Gryffindor uniform didn’t make it better. And it’s not just all the right muscles and what he packs. Back in Hogwarts, Potter was seldom carefree. Understandable, anyone leading a group of minors, each with their own quirk, fighting lunatics and twisted politicians and opportunists would be. Plus, he had Draco at almost every corner of the castle giving him hard times with creativity. The paper crane for example, had a nice touch of romanticism in it. Now it seemed that Potter was no longer the young leader of a wolf gang on the rise, but a matured lone wolf, with a good grip on himself and the world. The uniform just made that contrast starker. He looked… casual but invincible. Not much could hurt the man he became anymore. It was enticing to see such a man do just about anything. If he didn’t demand Draco not to look, Draco wasn’t sure he could look away.
And he looked up, his eyes clear and bright and so green that emeralds from the queen’s jewelleries would be ashamed. Just seeing those eyes did terrible things to him.
‘Settled then.’ Came Potter’s joyful voice, ‘Pleasant party, Draco. But I wish to make my exit now. I’m afraid the Manor is too big for me to remember the way. Would you please show me the way out?’
Tiredness washed over him as the praise loosened the last tension he was holding, Draco struggled to keep his eyes open, and asked: ‘Is there a time limit…?’
Draco grabbed his broom and stumped into the field, hearing the annoying sound of Lee taunting him on Potter’s behalf: ‘There comes our protagonists today! Owww Malfoy looks like an angry ferret with puffed fur, provoking talk before the game got under his skin? While Harry looks very indulgent.’
Potter laughed, then looked up at Draco, slid his hand up, held Draco’s waist and pulled him close. He buried his nose in Draco’s groin, nuzzled Draco’s soft cock as if a little dog seeking comfort: ‘Either will do. I don’t care about them. But you…I need to ask you something.’
Then there’s the delicious and rather expensive truffle chocolate from Belgium, an old wine, a beautiful high-end white fur coat, a silver engraved pocket watch with memo charms, a cologne, and so on.
‘A chair.’ Potter said. The realisation had dawned on him, and he had quickly pulled himself together.
Never in a million years would Draco dream of Potter sending him presents. It was a rather small present, size of a dictionary, but holding it in his hands, Draco could feel his heart at his throat.
‘I don’t…’ Draco couldn’t look away, it’s not that he wants them, they represented the power and recognition that didn’t mean much to him anymore, it’s just he knew how much they meant to father, ‘It’s not my intention to challenge your status, I…’
His family did fell a little after the war, but he had worked their way back to a respectable position by throwing gold at both charities and politicians, and that in return, earned him even more money and guilt. Seeing Potter’s name in the top five pointed glamour list was the last straw. And he just… couldn’t resist.
‘Music to my ear, Malfoy, music to my ear.’ Potter laughed, his fingers stroked Draco’s hair lovingly, and led the ball over Draco’s prostate again.
Crabbe suddenly lunged at Rosier, presumably the time limit of his stunning spell passed; Rosier cast a lightning spell and immobilised him again easily, and narrowed his eyes: ‘You, I don’t need you anymore.’
Draco couldn’t care less about the ruined tux now stripping it off as fast as he could. He asked, but Potter answered with pulling out his wand, pointing it at him and cast: ‘
So he stood up abruptly and stumped his way there, ripped off his clothes angrily and knelt on the ground.
Draco glanced at Forgecount, but resigned and whispered: ‘It’s… it’s the golden arrowbees. I think I saw them.’
‘Sorry.’ Potter forced out a smile, ‘I shouldn’t… There’s no excuse for what I’ve done. Anything you want to ask?’
Mother picked up on it, and as always, mediated their difference, started talking about her new recipe of soufflé, and the Malfoy father and son both complimented that. There was only one thing left that they shared: they both loved Narcissa Malfoy dearly, which would never change. It was the only reason they could still sit at the same table.
Ziegler laughed again, and finished her exam: ‘I’ve cast a few healing spells, and the nurses will bring you the potions after an hour, three hours, and five hours. Be a good boy and stay in bed, okay? I’ll now go observe and consult on Harry’s surgery, and I promise I’ll come and tell you once Harry comes out. You are only allowed to get up after twenty-four hours, and you can go see him once he’s conscious. Deal?’
‘Of course not, but you do need to have a way of thinking that doesn’t always lead to self-destruction, and your opinion about Potter can’t be self-contradictory. To your reference, though, he’s not a saint, but you are free to decide he’s human scum.’ Potter said as he looked very, very guilty, ‘That’s the third thing I want to talk with you. I am sincerely sorry for where I’ve gotten us today, yet I can’t even properly apologise and give you an explanation. If you hadn’t come to me, I wouldn’t have bothered you  —— Merlin knows how much I’ve missed you. But as long as you feel you are not going to hurt yourself further, I’m going to ask if you’ll give me some time till I can actually explain and apologise.’
The man still looked confused, so Draco explained to him goodheartedly: ‘That girl was in love with a fake image of the perfect Potter, fame, fortune, power, a hero, the great Saviour, the invincible Auror, the list go on and on. I bet you she dreamed of being Mrs. Potter all her life when she doesn’t have a fucking clue what kind of person Potter is. She wanted Potter to become the perfect man she imagined, not knowing what it means to Potter, or that if you love someone, you love who they really are and stay by their side up and down. I feel sorry for her, and for Potter. She was confused, and Potter deserved better, someone who understands he’s just human, and indulge his quirks. Father had his many flaws, but he was a hell of a lucky bastard to have mother’s love, and he knows to appreciate her.’
It was the first time Draco saw Potter since his trial. Potter was, of course, different. Draco wouldn’t say maroon was the best colour for him, but he sure pulled off that uniform well, his skin was a sun-soaked shade of golden, and lines of his compact muscles were visible through the robe; the man was magnificence trapped in human form. He wore his hair longer, tied those messy black curls at his neck, he had also changed his glasses, but it was still that silly round frame, making him somehow look like a bad poet from a broke noble family, damned if every line he wrote was not about love, and damned as Draco was sure to be moved by every cheesy line.
Something else was different. Draco hardly ever hears Potter use foul language, and he soon realised Potter probably never had the chance to do what he was doing now. To watch Draco willingly push his limits, taking the punishment he might not be able to endure, was just the beginning. People are complicated, and Potter wasn’t just a sadist, Draco could feel something in Potter’s personality contradicted his identity as a Dom, and it couldn’t be satisfied with the caretaking after the act. It always impeded him from getting what the monster inside him wanted, stopped him from delivering pain and pleasure as he truly wishes. By asking for one thousand strikes, Draco had given him a chance he would never have given himself, to unleash the monster. Also, Potter liked to be challenged, right now Draco was presenting him with a really difficult one: to make such a severe punishment endurable, even enjoyable.
Weasley was surprised, Draco had to clear his throat to jerk him from his stunned state: ‘Uh, Mal… Malfoy. Yes. You too.’
This time they both know there’s just no way they can last long, and Draco’s hole was slick enough for Harry to fuck all the way in and out brutally. Not long and Draco was seeing stars, he felt the pleasure making him tense up and meltdown at the same time, the only thing supporting him was Harry’s hands on his hips, when the orgasm came, it hit him like a tsunami, washed over him, breaking him as Harry’s cum shot deep into him.
‘Good.’ The finger slipped into Draco easily, Draco couldn’t help but moaned and leaned into Potter. Potter stroked his back with the other hand and asked, ‘And?’
The following month was busy like hell, Draco could barely make time to see the man, and the man was indeed hard to reach, and had to decline a few times. Draco knew there were other Doms and they could also wear Potter’s glamour, but he didn’t want them. He wasn’t spending nearly enough time with the man as he would have liked, but he couldn’t exactly stay with the man every night. These thoughts worried him, but there’s already too much on his plate so he easily excused himself and shoved all that to some corner of his mind. In addition to all the events Draco’s planning, something always go wrong with the Yule Ball. Draco blame Potter for that. The Ministry got so paranoid that Draco had to examine details as minuscule as floor wax by himself for Merlin’s sake.
‘You are a weird one Potter.’ Draco laughed, but he could tell from those smiling emerald eyes that the man knew that he really meant admiration, ‘But still, you said him. Not her, not them. So there was someone special.’
He slowly turned around, and saw no other than Harry Potter, wearing formal black robes and looking down at his wand with a surprised expression that he quickly concealed, and looked at Draco with assurance and comfort.
‘Come on; everyone’s waiting for you to start the game. I think Hermione has something nefarious planned for you.’
Then he had Draco over his knee, applied a cleaning spell as well as the dittany salve, stroked Draco’s hair one final time before he locked Draco in the basket with the chain, then spelled Draco’s wrists bound with handcuffs attaching them to his collar also, preventing Draco from touching his unreleased cock or battered arse.
Draco slowly turned around, forgetting his skewed cufflinks. Potter moved closer to him, and raised his hands. Draco already held his breath when that young face of Potter’s was millimeters away without realising, but when he saw what was in Potter’s hand, he felt his blood turned to ice.
Frankly it wasn’t a hard thing to do. When Potter wasn’t surrounded by people he clearly didn’t want to talk with, he was devoted to avoid everyone. And Draco got the feeling that he was deliberately avoiding Draco too, making sure he was never too close to Draco so they had to greet. Not really a surprise. Which further falsified the man’s suggestion of apologising to Potter directly.
‘This is really difficult, isn’t it.’ Draco teased after he saved Potter from the Greengrass sisters who Pansy had beef with and wouldn’t talk to.
The man’s breath hitched, his eyes changed, becoming even more predatory. He stroked Draco’s left cheek: ‘Like it, little kitten? Oh you are definitely more kitten than a cub, arrogant, disobedient, attention whore.’
They spent a lot of time working the cases together, even when they weren’t, Potter’s office was just a wall away, separated by glass and blinds. It felt intimate and somehow comforting. It’s also kind of a sweet torment, as sometimes when they both look up from work, Potter would smile brightly at him, and all the emotions Draco kept boxed in tight would threaten to break loose.
‘How do you feel about taking pleasure from the pains of others now Malfoy?’ After a few strikes, Potter pulled Draco’s hair back and scolded, ‘When it is you in pain?’
By the time the punishment ended, and Potter took Draco back into his arms, Draco’s tears had tainted his face and wet a significant part of the sheet, but he was incredibly hard, begging to be fucked.
But today the man had other priorities. He was determined to teach Draco a lesson, and moved his hand to the rim of Draco’s underwear.
‘Great.’ Draco snorted a laugh, ‘I made a thousand badges, one for each student at Hogwarts, few extra souvenirs. Drained up my allowance. Didn’t think it was possible.’
Draco consider himself half a politician. Despite his rejection to most of the Malfoy education, and that he didn’t consider himself any more of politician material than his father who obviously took a side that couldn’t be more wrong, he had learned and grew accustomed to spotting the giveaways in people’s words and expressions. He felt something there, hesitated but couldn’t stop himself: ‘Someone… hurt you before?’
Maybe the man wanted his friends to know what they were doing, as the stimulation lasted quite a while, Draco had to splash some cold water on his face and hope the flush will subside. But as he went back to the table, Draco changed his mind, maybe the man just forgot, as Pansy had just stabbed her fork millimetres away from the man’s hand and smiled her vicious bitch smile, saying something to the man.
‘Not sure.’ Forgecount shrugged, ‘Just came to myself —— about Potter, he didn’t even hesitate to give up his hands or his life, you are lucky to have him.’
The third kidnapper mediated: ‘Listen to the leader. Give Malfoy a break. We are breaking him. You used too many Crucios too fast; he’s having fantom pain. We can’t have him going crazy before we get the answer. Just give him a break.’
‘For Merlin’s sake, Potter,’ Draco felt ridiculous, he tried to pull his hand back, but Potter’s hand was like iron, ‘I’m not in the mood for jokes.’
"I have similarly been passed down certain memories of the past, to the furthest possible to the most recent. That is what I have given you. Past time, that memory will become yours, the experience similarly familiar. The only dangers to such a method would be your own misconceptions." Vivian whispered gently.
"Many came to the conclusion anyone else would die upon arrival but a few days in. Hogwarts of prestige, Beauxbatons of the rich, Durmstrang of learning. Here, the books on Dark Magic isn't restricted at all. There are librarians and older voluntary students who make sure students are not harmed by cursed books, but otherwise we're free to read on sacrificial rituals and blood magic. It's the handful of younger students who are often mislead, with such books and resources accessible. They're lost, you see, although I can see you are simply confused, by the sudden amount of freedom granted."
Draco's eyes snapped open, and he made to get up, which Luna moved for his convenience but refused to let go. Concentrating, Draco felt his magic fray at the forefront of the conductor's cabin, a cold which ran down his spine and curled intrusively around his core.
"Do you remember the time that eighth year got stuck between the dimensions on the third corridor?" He said, ignoring Hermione's gaping mouth, "Aunt Vivian had to fold the entire school's dimensions together, and reattach his legs before pulling him out. That was hilarious."
"There is a naming system, like how the House of Fawley gives their people a name, within the French military of
I'm not saying BDSM, sex, and obsession stories are bad. I've read some myself. I'm saying there's some which goes "above and beyond", including children, gore, blood, non-consent and worse resulting from those genres.
The rat was startled awake, but it grew. Slowly, disgustingly, its red-brown hair turned into longer strands which sat on a near-bald head, its paws turned longer into thin bones, and its legs, most grotesque of all, elongated into pale, hairy meat which was soon covered with a paired summoning of ragged clothes. Draco nearly dropped the bowl, but stood instead to move against the door, shoving it back into professor Flitwick's hands.
"We're assuming all contacts and slowing all activities. We will not meet again for the next three years, Narcissa. Anything of importance will be by your son, and even he will have nothing but our guide in strengthening himself educationally and physically. It will be his decision to remain for which holidays and when. Our hands are tied," Jason paused, "briefly."
The eagle immediately took up a third of the table, knocking over other teacups and dishes and screeching into Blaise's ears in greeting. There was a spoonful of tomato soup which immediately carried over towards the nearest table, a piece of cheese flying overhead professor Snape's head, and the furthest plate shattering on the floor due to the momentum.
"And because Harry Potter is a living, breathing project with years ahead of him, Dumbledore's propaganda will last as long as he lives."
She looked, Draco silently thought, ready to cheer in victory of finding another study-driven member of her imaginary fellowship.
"Now, let me tell you a secret. It is a perceived notion in the magical society to use such fragments of memory in a special container, like Pensieves. Catherine uses the same theory in application, but rather drags the person in the replicate dimension of her own memories seemingly within herself. If it is not by her will, a person may remained trapped in Catherine's memories for the rest of their lives. That's the power of a replicated memory. But it's rawest form comes from the memory itself, which is what I hold, here. And placing this in another person's head-"
"Aunt Vi, your plan for me sounds quite solid. I see no reason why I shouldn't do it as long as my mouth cooperates with me."
"Yes. She's awake at all hours. I've never seen her sleeping. For a Hufflepuff, she's rather determined, and mad. Obsessed, even."
‘The slut on the wall, you mean.’ Malfoy drawled, the changing colour of the potion danced on his irises, making it impossible to tell his thoughts, ‘One would think that’s beneath you. Surely the Lord of the Wizarding World can do better than a hole in the wall. Just raise your finger and all the best Omegas would spread their legs for you.’
Potter picked up on it immediately, he pulled Draco up and said by his ear: ‘You are going to come like a bitch, aren’t you pet? Orgasm dry by your pretty little arsehole?’
Then came Lee’s roaring voice: ‘Aaaaand to top it up, the epic seekers game and thrilling bet between our beloved Harry Potter and his longtime rivalry, recently favourite pet, Draco Malfoy!’
Draco felt himself froze for a moment, the man just looked at him with a hint of cold smile in his eyes: ‘Do you have a specific memory in mind, or would you just like to be punished for being a bully in general as a start?’
It wasn’t long before Draco felt those truly predatory emerald eyes on him, burning through his glamour and possibly, his clothes.
But that's the moment everything came back, and Harry almost felt the burden pulled his shoulders down like boulders.
Draco shook his head to think clearly——he hadn’t even drunk his whiskey for Merlin’s sake; he shouldn’t feel so dizzy and aroused. He took a sip to calm himself and asked: ‘How did you know she was abused? There’s not a trace in the house. He repaired or erased them all.’
As if felt his distress, the man pushed something from behind the menu in front of Draco. Draco looked up and saw it was a napkin folded into a crane, and he couldn’t help but looked up and smiled at the man. The man of course, blushed and smiled back.
As he spoke, the Gryffindor team and Slytherin team entered the field and got into position. Draco looked to the man, and he explained: ‘The Glamour is rigged to play the record of one of the old matches we played.’
Draco couldn’t notice anything other than the pain, he clawed at the bedsheet, crying out as tears rolled down his cheeks: ‘I’m sorry, Potter, I’m truly sorry about it.’
‘Like I said, you were denied bail.’ Rosier said with fake regret, ‘You can try to make your case after three days.’
‘Please.’ Draco said sourly, ‘It’s been almost ten years since I last saw him. I hardly knew who he was back then, let alone who he has become. At least back in Hogwarts, I got to see him everyday. I can’t just say I love him when I don’t know him anymore.’
When he got to the Christmas tree, mother was already there. She looked up at him, pulled her jasper Persia tippet tighter and smiled at Draco: ‘Draco. Did you sleep well last night?’
By this point, Harry’s desk was swamped by Omegas wanting a vial of his magic and scent, it’s a good thing a few Omegas and Betas still had the decency to leave Harry be, and a few vials were left behind.
It was then he knew, Potter was different. But it wasn’t something he was willing to acknowledge, and was in denial for many years after.
It didn’t feel real even then. But Potter planted that thought in him. From that day on, it was as if he was walking high up in the sky, nothing was beneath him, for whatever reason, he wasn’t falling, every step, he got closer to that promised wedding, every step he was gathering all his strength and courage, every step every cell of his was trembling with fear and pain, every step he was wondering why he hadn’t fallen to his death.
Draco had always had a complicated relationship with his father. In comparison, he would consider himself closer to his Godfather, Severus, who had even known he was bisexual and favoured men a bit more, and had tried to help him out of the death eater mess instead of gotten him in. Not that their relationship was perfect. Severus had always been a bit too indulgent to Draco too, as he was his godson, a Slytherin through and through, and nodoubly the best potions master after him. He had also looked the other way when Draco bullied Potter, due to some old feud of the last generation, though Draco didn’t know the specifics. Severus had regretted that at about sixth year, but Draco wouldn’t blame him for his own mistakes.
Potter didn’t wait for the ginger oil to take it’s effect before he put Draco over his knee and started paddling Draco. He started light and steady, more arousing to Draco then punishing, but the ginger oil slowly took its effect, and Draco felt his freshly tongue-fucked hole warming up, slowly working towards burning. He couldn’t very well stay still and quiet anymore; he tried to relax, but every strike of the wooden paddle caused tensing and friction that resulted in further burning, and he sobbed and whimpered, trying in vain to stop himself from writhing and squirming.
Taking the new wand in hand, turning it between his fingers mischievously for a moment before holstering it, Draco smiled and said: ‘Remember when I told you to take it as an early birthday gift?’
He must have looked surprised, as Potter answered his silent question: ‘Last year, at your birthday party. I asked about your thoughts on love; you said Slytherins don’t do love.’
This is the first time they’ve ever talked about the war. Sometimes it felt as if they fought it, and left it there. They don’t think about it, don’t talk about it, just carried on with their lives. But it was there. It never left. It lives and breathes within them, every moment of happiness, it looms over; every moment of despair, it swallows them whole.
Potter would be running for Minister of Magic the next year; Draco had helped him with that. If he got elected, which was a real possibility, he might need to be away on occasions for diplomatic reasons. But what he’s saying was… he wanted Draco to be his first husband?
They didn’t say anything about it, but that was definitely the elephant in the room. No matter what the circumstances back then, no matter how much had changed since then, Draco would always be branded an ex-Death Eater. Potter never talked about their relationship, thus never made Draco feel like that was the reason their relationship didn’t progress to any defining state, but Draco was careful. He couldn’t have had much leniency on that matter, and what he had with Potter was too precious to be destroyed by some indiscretion, so he kept their relationship to himself, a secret he would take to his grave. And above all, Draco didn’t want to cause Potter any unnecessary trouble; he knew how much the man disliked media attention; at the very least, Draco didn’t want to be the one to destroy the nice and quiet life Potter managed to build for himself.
‘Okay.’ The man kissed by Draco’s ear lightly, suppressing a smile, and when Draco looked at him angrily questioning if he had gone mental with his glare, he just broke into that bright smile and picked Draco up, ‘You are too cute for your own good —— go eat sweetheart, then I’ll fuck you again.’
‘Can you…’ Draco tried. But it’s so difficult for him to admit his need, both about the punishment and about the comfort.
The man mostly just made sure Draco was okay after seeing Dumbledore, and then he was gone. In his absence, Draco did some catch up with his old Slytherin housemates and some socialising with his other schoolmates from other houses, as it seemed to be a lot easier with the help of Granger and Neville.
Draco did. And though he was sure there was no sound to be heard, he swore there’s the lullaby he used to hear from mother. He tried another one, and it was that time he sang it to Harry.
Potter was taking in Draco’s laugh, as if a man looking at the blossom of the million flowers for the first time in his life, his eyes so concentrated that Draco almost felt self-conscious.
Father went pale. The heraldry had been deciding the head of the family for hundreds of years. If the Malfoy family's ancient magic admitted Draco as an heir, Draco would only be able to command one of the black dragons —— only the head of the family could command both.
Weasley was unresponsive. Hermione also looked at loss of words and was still looking at the man apologetically.
Draco was sure Potter wasn’t trying to get Draco to cheat with him or anything, because he’s too decent a person to do that, but then what happened that night was weird, Draco couldn’t for the love of Merlin figure out what he wanted Draco to understand, and the feeling of cum leaking out of his arse right in front of Potter was so embarrassing that Draco really didn’t want to think back about it.
