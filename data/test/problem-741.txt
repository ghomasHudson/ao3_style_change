“No, no,” he said, “not about quitting. About… Draco.”
“You’re the best,” she said, waving as she bustled from the shop, leaving Draco alone in the sewing room.
It took a moment for him to place the slanting handwriting on the envelope — though he should have been able to guess it from the brusque ‘Potter’ and nothing else.
It wasn’t a big deal if Draco hated him, he told himself. It was, in fact, a completely normal state of affairs. The way life
“I told you — I wanted to go to Narcissa’s funeral. She saved my life, after all.”
He found a clear bit of parchment — wincing at the pompous embossed Ministry of Magic — Auror Department header and scrawled
those fucking robes and never think of Potter again. But there had been so little left in the shop that he couldn’t bring himself to burn the yards of (very expensive) fabric in a fit of dramatics. His next plan had been to rip them up and create something new and beautiful with the scraps. He couldn’t bring himself to do that, either, when he considered the hours of work he’d already put in. After all, they didn’t have to go to Potter — they were just dress robes. Anyone around his size could wear them.
He shrugged. “Yeah, I’ll owl you this week sometime once I’ve converted it.”
They collided once more with a desperate fervour. Malfoy wrapped a hand around the back of Harry’s neck, his fingers digging into his skin as their lips parted. Their tongues met and the wet warmth spread from his mouth down Harry’s entire body. He nipped lightly at Malfoy’s lower lip, appreciating its soft fullness even more when he moaned in Harry’s mouth.
Belligerent, Harry shook his head. “I definitely did
She wrapped her arms around his waist and held on tightly for a long moment. “Thanks for coming, Draco. You’re a really good friend.”
“Sorry,” he said. He smoothed his hair out of his face and fixed a charming smile. “I’m listening, please continue, Millie.”
He walked the rest of the way on his own at a pace closer to a jog than a walk, his head down and his hands in his pockets. To keep his mind from wandering, he counted the paving stones, then the white lines of the zebra crossing, then his own steps. He refused to look up from the ground, lest he see another blonde man, or someone slightly taller than Harry, or someone who held their nose up in the air in that infuriating way Draco did, and then he’d lose any semblance of being put together. One time he’d seen someone wearing the same shade of blue that had looked so good on Draco that his mind had wandered…
“Luna’s friend lives nearby and Luna always wanted to try it out. This reminds me of my aunt and uncle’s kitchen — but dirtier.” Potter frowned and although he was looking at the furniture, his eyes had a far-away gaze. The Muggles broke out into cheers as someone began to down a pint and the sound made him realise where he was and who he was talking to. He shook his head and cleared his throat. “Anyway. I just wanted to say — if that kind of thing
He didn’t get home again until past sunset. Ginny had been rightly furious.
. That’s more something Hermione would do,” Harry said. “I’m more selfish than that. I just… I didn’t realise how much I hated it until I woke up the morning after I quit and realised I didn’t have to go back ever again. I imagined that life when I was seventeen and for the last decade I’ve tried to make it a reality, but I was
“Fuck,” he moaned, closing his eyes and trying to get a hold of himself before he came without even being touched. He didn't think he’d ever been so hard before.
“I wanted to be an Auror to help people,” he said. “I didn’t sign up for all… this.” He gestured vaguely at the office, the memos, the stacks of papers.
Draco grinned. “I’d like that.”
Ginny put the book back in the bag. “Did you get your robes sorted?” she asked.
, I see. Well, I can recommend London’s best gay clubs you’re missing me,” he drawled.
His cheeks burned as he tried to get to his feet but his foot slipped on a piece of glass; Potter jerked into action, one hand wrapping around Draco’s elbow and the other grabbing his hand. There was a sharp, strange pain that stung his throat. It felt as if he was swallowing a flame and he choked, his hand shooting to clutch his throat as if to hold it together but — just as he thought he was going to scream — it faded as quickly as it appeared.
Hermione came back downstairs and kissed the side of Ron’s head before serving herself a spoonful of the smaller vegetarian pie Ron had made. “Looks lovely, thanks, honey.”
pparition but at least he now had an opportunity to change out of his vinegar-soaked robes. He wondered if Potter would notice his absence and chase him down for not staying to get checked over. He doubted it; surely the Chosen One was far too busy commanding a team of Aurors to pay attention to Draco.
“Let’s go,” he said.
“Nothing,” he snapped and marched over to his table, reaching for something to do only to remember he’d finished all of his tasks hours ago. He picked up his coffee cup and went to wash it up by hand in the kitchen sink. “If anyone else comes in, you’re dealing with them.”
“What can I do for you, Potter?”
“Yes,” he said eagerly, freeing his finger from Rose’s vice-like grip and pulling up a chair.
“I’m not—”
The breeze ruffled his hair playfully, almost teasing, and he doubted his words. His parents had met at Hogwarts and they married the year after his mother left school, meaning his mother was just fifteen when they got together. Draco couldn't imagine a relationship involving two teenagers that could ever be proper.
“I have a lot of loyalties to the Aurors, Harry, as you can imagine. And I’m embarrassed to admit that those old bonds have been clouding my decisions for the past ten years. If you say that the system needs reform then I’m committed to reforming it — and I can trust that Hermione won’t pull her punches.”
turned up at opening time.
“Draco, did you cover my very expensive robes in dicks?” he asked slowly.
They clattered down the stairs quickly, fuelled by their hunger, but just before they got to the garden, Draco pulled Harry to a stop in the narrow hallway. Careful to keep to the shadowed side, he pushed him against a wall and kissed him tenderly, gently. Harry hummed happily, cupping Draco's jaw and stroking his thumb against Draco’s cheek.
He grimaced and turned in his chair so he didn’t have to look at the mess. That was a problem for another day.
There was a long moment of silence as Harry tried to figure out how to explain it to Ginny. In her world, it
“I don’t care, Potter, Hermione needs to rest, not entertain people,” the woman snapped in a distinctly not-professional way. “Did you just push a baby out of your genitals?”

He had to
“I never said that.” He was ninety-nine percent sure he’d never said that, at least. He racked his brains, trying to remember exactly what they’d said in St. Mungo’s, but the exact words escaped him. Still,

, sir?”
“I walked in and found that man having cornered and disarmed Theo, threatening to kill him.”
Draco kept the door open this time, keeping his glare trained on Potter until he’d apparated away and then stepping away and closing the door softly. There was enough smashed glass in the shop already. Draco didn’t need to add to it by slamming a door.
His cock stirred, hardening against his thigh.
? It felt too intimate, like an undressing a lover.
“That looks like a cock and balls to me.”
“Morni— Merlin, Harry, you look good,” Belinda said, looking him up and down.
“I work here. These three are friends of mine. They don’t have any connections to the shop.”
, he thought glumly as he turned down Grimmauld Place; the sun taunted him from the middle of the sky. It was only noon, meaning he had at least thirteen hours to fill before he’d be tired enough to sleep.
Draco blinked, taken aback by the sudden aggression directed at him. Greg had never dared to challenge Draco on anything before.
“Of course, sir,” Harry said as he followed the Head Auror to his office. It was a large, luxurious room. He gestured for Harry to take a seat in one of the two polished wooden chairs on one side of his desk as he walked round and sank into the high-backed leather desk chair. Over his steepled fingers, he watched Harry sit down.
There was no one behind the desk, but he heard Maggie call, “I’ll be with you in one moment!”
“Uh. Yes. One small thing.”
“I suppose someone in the family had to inherit Mum’s cooking talents.”
, Harry thought as they walked in silence. They were both too stubborn to apologise after a fight, even when they both said things they regretted and the little things began to stack up, until Harry couldn’t look at Ginny without first having to slash through so many layers of unresolved, petty disagreements. After all, how could you address the fact that it annoyed you when your partner left her hair stuck to the shower wall when you knew it would inevitably escalate to the point you were promising to try therapy again because your nightmares woke them up every night? Even then, at the end of an hour of tears and pain that left you feeling like all the skin had been scraped off with a steel brush, the fucking hair would
Harry extended his hand like he was asking for a handshake. Draco took it like Harry was asking him to hold a Flobberworm and anger flared bright in Harry’s chest. They were doing everything Draco wanted: he could be
“You’ve been different. Especially tonight.”
“Dinner’s ready!” Ron hollered from the kitchen.
Draco groaned aloud and pressed the balls of his fists against his eyes. It was impossible to sleep with the debates constantly raging, never reaching a satisfying conclusion.
“You’re a terrible liar,” Pansy said.
“I was going to stop by after work today.”
“Should we…” Harry trailed off and took a deep breath, steeling himself. “Talk about this?” He gestured between them, as if Draco might somehow get the wrong end of the stick — as if there was anything else the two of them needed to talk about.
tell us about what you thought of Second Year Draco,” Harry begged, but the end of the sentence came out strangled as Draco jabbed his fingernails into his side.
“From what Harry’s described to us, it doesn’t
, he thought, as he took in the finished robes on Harry for the first time.
“I think I’ve fucked up,” he mumbled into his hands.
“You again.” His voice didn’t betray any hint of his inner monologue.
“Yeah, it was a nightmare though — apparently psychics and physics are different things?” she said, holding up the book she was browsing so Harry could see the cover:
“You’ve said that already.”
She stared at him, her mouth hanging open. Her bright red lipstick matched her scarlet hair.
He’d been staring off into the middle distance as he considered his options. Potter, unable to stand still for more than a second, fidgeted awkwardly, bringing Draco back to the present.
Harry laughed. “They’re incredible, seriously. They almost make me
“Yeah, it’s a long story — not a big deal, though. There’s a small possibility we’ve been cursed,” he lied, because ‘
The bathrooms were right at the back of the bar, through a fake kitchen with brown linoleum and mustard cabinets. There was a long rectangular table of Muggles playing some kind of drinking game that involved holding their fingers to their foreheads and chanting loudly, so entranced in catching people out that they didn’t even glance at Draco as he sidled past to the door with
It had to be because of the sudden proximity that his heart started beating faster. He fixed his eyes on the shelves opposite, looking at the light bouncing off the tip of some ridiculously shiny shoes as Malfoy smoothed his collar.
“Oh uh, yeah, sure, of course,” Harry said, running a hand through his messy hair, hoping it wasn’t sticking any more than usual. “I was just, um… Reading.” He swallowed a yawn.
tested in front of him then he very much doubted an overworked Healer would be able to spot it.
“Someone at work said they got some robes repaired here. I was wondering if you could fix this.” He gestured at the robes laid out on the front desk — though ‘robes’ was a generous description. Draco picked up one of the scraps of red fabric and raised an eyebrow as he examined the ragged edges.
“I couldn’t do it alone,” Maggie said as they trudged up to the group of mourners. “I’ve always been the black sheep of the family and now— Well, they all blame me for…” A tear dripped onto her cheek as she choked up and Draco gently laid his palm flat on her back, stroking a small circle with his thumb.
“I wouldn’t say that” — he had to steel himself to get the next phrase out naturally — “I was talking to Harry Potter just this afternoon. I’m sure he’d be interested to hear my side of the story.”
“You were at Peri’s an hour ago. I knew you’d be awake.”
Draco took a breath and said, “Harry Potter.”
“How did he know we were in there, anyway?” Draco asked.
“What?”
Harry scowled at the mention of that shambolic night. “To be clear: it was very much a protest about that raid and just because I’m not coming back doesn’t mean I think they should be off the hook.”
He hadn’t had a good night of sleep in

Malfoy.
Something had happened to the banner and it now statically declared,
“Who says I’m not happy?”
“Yes,” he said, entirely convinced of this new course of action.
He hung back as the others drifted from the room. It was the end of their shift, technically, although no one had been paying much attention to leaving times, they were too passionate about the case. The only exception was Ron, who had taken to leaving work with a bag full of case files at exactly the end of the shift, and who returned the next morning with the same files covered in annotations in suspiciously neat handwriting. Harry didn’t comment on the blatant breach of confidentiality; Hermione’s insights were invaluable (and also she would probably murder him with her bare hands if he took away one of her only current intellectual pursuits).

“Yes, mistress?”
“It’s a cocktail,” Greg clarified, then shook his head. “Never mind, I’ll come see. Where’s the alcohol?” he asked and let George lead him away.

“Not this again.” Draco scowled. “I told you, I don’t have some nefarious evil plan in the works.
“Earl grey?” he checked.
He had no intention of giving himself paperwork over the weekend, especially when he knew for a fact it would never go anywhere. For all the talk of unity and recovery after the war, the Mark on his arm would forever make him an outcast. He deserved it, and he’d come to terms with that. He’d carved out a place in society that accepted him, for the most part, and he didn’t see any reason to interact with the rest of it.

The entrance to the wizarding portion of the shop was in the alley that ran alongside the edge of the building. Where Muggles saw a side door with a
What would a museum of Draco’s greatest hits look like? Was there a single moment that could be celebrated? He couldn’t even claim childish victories like the House Cup or the Quidditch Cup like Potter. Though that was because of blatant favouritism to Gryffindor. It remained a sore point for Draco, even after so many years.
“Does it remind you of someone?” Maggie asked, leaning in so Draco could hear her whisper.
“You’re here early,” Draco said.
Greg had already moved on to another customer and he replied distractedly while pouring beer from a tap as someone else shouted an order at him. “In three hours, so maybe?”
“Can I make you a cup of tea?” he asked, filling the kettle on the stove with his wand.
He didn’t breathe until he stepped back, the tape measure slithering from Potter’s neck. He thought he saw the other man exhale as well, and he was pretty sure he didn’t usually have that light pink flush dusting his cheeks.
A stabbing pain shot through his hand, and he unclenched his fist in surprise. A shard of glass from a smashed picture frame had been hidden in the folds of some fabric and had slashed across his hand, staining the cream chiffon bright crimson. He swore and tossed it aside, reaching for his wand.
Draco got to his feet and crossed the room to read over Hermione’s shoulder. “A Taboo isn’t selective though — it would apply to
He owed Maggie Malkin his career. It was a fact they were both aware of, but she never lorded it over him or even acknowledged it. From the way she listened to him and valued his opinions, an outsider would probably assume Draco had applied to the job with a list of relevant experiences as long as his arm.
Draco gestured at the food on the table. “Eating,
Draco kept his hands on his head but he tightened them into fists, grabbing handfuls of his hair.
“Why is there so much?” Harry asked. His old dress robes hadn’t been this complicated, had they? It had been so long since he’d forced himself into the ridiculous monkey suits, he couldn’t actually remember.
“How are you feeling?” Hermione asked.
His skin prickled, not unpleasantly, and he caressed his chest, following the lines of the criss-crossing scars without thinking. He rubbed his thumb across his nipples and gasped as a lightning bolt of desire streaked to his toes.
never wanted them to go back to being casual acquaintances: that was all Draco’s suggestion.
“Look, I’ve been to Dra- Malfoy’s shop before. It’s just a tailor shop and the wizarding section is completely separate from the Muggle front — the door’s
It was only 4 o’clock. There was still another hour and a half to waste away.
Someone knocked, and he squinted at the blurry figure as he shoved his glasses back on. Ambrose nudged the door open with his foot, his hands full of papers.
There was a large box behind the till containing the returned items confiscated by the Aurors. They hadn’t summoned the courage to sort through it yet.
He read the list of confiscated items: magic needles, wizarding pictures of models, an enchanted sewing machine — all of which had been tested and found to have no trace of dark magic on them.
“Good morning,” he said to the carer, who must have already known who Draco was as she stuck her nose up and pointedly turned her back on him as she carried a steaming mug to Madam Malkin. Draco didn’t bother feeling offended — it was hardly being hexed next to a urinal.
“I’ll explain later,” he whispered back as the next speaker — Maggie’s dad — started talking about what a wonderful mother and grandmother she’d been. He sat quietly, listened to the eulogies and tried to focus on Madam Malkin, remembering the old cantankerous woman who made Maggie cry at work more than once, but also dressed Draco in his very first set of Hogwarts robes when he was eleven.
“No,” Harry said, getting to his feet. “I feel completely normal.”
“The ones I said
Grinning, he pocketed the invite and retrieved his keys, deeply relieved that he was spared for another day.
He had a feeling that was why she enjoyed her job so much, she got to spend a large portion of it ordering people around. Pansy had always been the bossy type.
His heart ached for that life.
“You know you can tell me anything.”
“Don’t worry. If there’s one place no one will judge you for crying, it’s a funeral,” Maggie said, but he still quickly dabbed under his eyes with his sleeve. Maggie handed him his handkerchief back, and he chuckled wetly.
Bile rose in his throat, coating his mouth with its acrid taste. He clenched his teeth against the urge to vomit and drew in a sharp breath.
Potter nodded at him and strode back down to the gate. Draco was glad he had enough manners not to Apparate straight out of the graveyard.

Harry cleared his throat. “Good,” he said after a long pause. “Really good, actually.”
s forcefully. “I wasn’t purposeful — we
“A former Death Eater? Which one?” he asked.
He sent the robes over to an empty desk with a swish of his wand along with a self-stitching needle and thread and walked to the shopfloor, curious. He tried to school his expression into something polite before he got there. Maggie had told him his face while dealing with customers looked like someone realising they’d trodden in dog shit.
He hadn’t seen the Minister in a few months. Despite their personal relationship, they didn’t cross paths in the Ministry often: Kingsley respected professional boundaries and all of his communication about the Aurors was with Robards. Being Minister of Magic meant he was usually too busy to come to Order events. Harry had probably spent more time in the company of Kingsley’s barn owl in the last five years than the man himself.
He stood soberly before his parents. They regarded him silently.
Pansy looked entirely unimpressed. “If you’d been paying attention to me earlier, you’d know that I helped deliver her baby last week,” she said coolly.
been given the opportunity to make proper robes and he’d taken it. They were hanging up in the corner of the workroom at that very moment, just waiting to be finished and sent to the customer.
He rolled his eyes. “You aren’t my mother, stop babysitting me. Go do your job.”
“How hard is it to get it through your
“What did he want?” she whispered.
“How’s Hermione?” a voice that
Draco had stopped leaning on the table. He stood in the middle of the room, every muscle tensed like a fledgling about to fly for the first time.
He tried to work through the baffling information Potter kept spewing. “But… You must know where we are. You Apparated.”
He expected Potter to argue more or demand to know a specific timeframe, but he shut his mouth and silently followed Draco’s previous instruction and climbed up onto the pedestal. He frowned, a small line creasing between his eyes as he looked around from his new perch.
“Ah, how sweet,” he said, sure it was the appropriate answer, no matter what age Granger had said.
considered the possibility it was something nefarious… What if it had been something worse than stain-removing potion and he’d let a Muggle girl get poisoned right in front of him?
He directed the last part to his father’s grave. He felt Lucius Malfoy’s sneer at his only son and heir working for minimum wage in a service job.
Taking his cue, Draco left him to it. On his way back to the table, he passed Theo heading for the toilet. His friend caught him by the arm and shouted over the obnoxiously loud music, “Millie’s upset that you didn’t compliment her hair.”

“Hermione’s the only woman in England who puts
“A thousand,” Draco said.
He clenched his teeth and looked away from Harry, his eyes landing on the splinching posters. He stared at the diagram of the person messily torn in half from right shoulder to left hip: head in one half, heart on the other. Could a person survive that?
Around them, a murmur spread through the crowd, and a few heads turned towards the gate. Draco followed their gaze and his mouth fell open in shock as he recognised Potter striding up the small gravelled path. He was wearing an outlandish outfit for a funeral: a loose tartan button up and slouchy grey trousers, and as he got closer Draco realised they were
“I’m fine,” he said. “Just busy with work.”
Wiltshire was far enough from central London that he landed in the Manor’s entrance hall in a breathless pile, the long-distance Apparition leaving him winded and nauseous. The marble tile was blessedly cold against his burning cheeks.
“What on Earth did you do to offend the uniform suppliers?”
“What about Rose?” he asked Ron and Hermione.
Potter caught sight of Draco and raised his wand, opening his mouth. Then he froze.
Shaking any idea of Potter from his head, he shrugged. “Trying to remember what food I have at home,” he lied, knowing full well there was nothing edible in his cupboards other than one sprouting potato.
“No. I mean, not the details. Ginny knows bits. I think Hermione might have guessed a little.”
coming to that conclusion?”
“What?”
“Glad to see you managed to work out how to dress yourself this time,” he said, aiming for sarcastic but just coming across breathless.
The sun was climbing in the sky and there was no breeze to take the edge off the sweltering heat. Sweat beaded on his forehead. Draco shrugged out of his cloak and laid it on the ground in front of his mother’s tomb, using his Uncle Morpheus as a backrest. Uncaring, he pushed his sleeves up to his elbows. After all, his parents knew what he was; they’d been worse.
The right thing, hopefully.
“You want to meet your Uncle Harry, Rosie?” Ron cooed.
“Fashionably late, Draco?” Theo asked. He was reclining in an armchair, one foot propped up on the glass coffee table.
“Thursday,” he said, his stomach shrivelling into a dense pit.
kissing me, though.”
The bell tinkled in the wizarding side of the shop, announcing a customer. They both glanced up, Maggie’s surprised eyes magnified threefold by the glasses.
…” Of course she had. The World Cup was coming up next year and it was all they’d talked about for weeks now — he just hadn’t put the two together. “Sorry,” he added and even he knew it was too late.
He wasn’t sure whether the end product technically fit into the exact dress code that the event demanded, but he was certain that Harry Potter could show up to the War Recovery Ball in a pillowcase and he would still be considered the guest of honour. After all, there wouldn’t
Potter took a second to register he was the one being sworn at, his mouth falling open dumbly and then frowning.
He’d had to abandon Luna on the pavement to duck into a pub and sit on the closed toilet lid with his head in his hands while he waited for his erection to wilt.
“That’s bloody weird to see,” he muttered, then said, “Bill’ll be over in a second. Gah, I hate fire calls,” he said as a piece of ash fell from his hair, streaks of grey amongst the ginger.
Madam Malkin huffed but she didn’t argue. “Tell Margaret that I expect her to call this weekend.”
The lift shuddered to a halt on the fifth floor and the doors creaked open. No one was waiting on the other side. Parkinson grunted and jabbed the button to close the door several times. It responded lethargically and did the same on the fourth floor.
Maggie tucked her hair behind her ear and glanced between Harry and the door. “He finished those a while ago.”
ed his work from the mannequin and kicked the door shut, closing the sewing room off from view of any customers who had a habit of ignoring the signs to keep out and interrupt his work. Although he wouldn’t mind being distracted from the robes he was working on.
He forced himself to smile as he replied. “And if you happen to run into any yetis…”
He finally got a wrist free and used it to grab a fistful of Potter’s shirt. He didn’t consider the implications of being even
But, of course, nothing happened.
“Woah,” Ron said. “That’s weird.”
Kingsley’s smile stayed in place, but his brows knitted together and he reached over and clapped a hand on Harry’s shoulder.
Her brow furrowed and her mouth fell open. “Uhm, excuse you! You’re
Draco blinked, trying to take in the barrage of new information, working out which one was important enough to address first.
He smirked at Draco. “I’m just appreciating the view.”
he decided.
She flapped a hand dismissively at the mention of Draco’s wellbeing. “Apparently Harry Potter was the one who brought him down. Did you see
He did his best not to trip over his feet as he watched the anger begin to melt gradually from her face like ice in the midwinter morning sun. It would take a while for her to thaw entirely and he wouldn’t push his luck.
“Potter, a word?” Robards called after one of their hundreds of meetings.
Harry turned to watch him approach. Draco didn’t miss the way his eyes skittered wildly up and down his body, pausing on the unlaced shirt and the length of his legs. (And if Draco put a little extra sway in his hips as he walked over, so what?)
“Um, Malfoy?” he called uncertainly.
of being big-headed.”
why you were awake so late?” he asked, his voice deep.
He walked around Potter to measure his shoulder width (also unfairly wide) and then finished off with his cuff measurement. Taking his hand, he tugged Potter’s arm out once more so that he could wrap the tape measure around his wrist without having to stand too close to him, his pale skin closer to the colour of the drab shirt than Potter’s tan. He let Draco tug his body into the correct positions without a word of protest. Draco made the mistake of glancing up to see Potter staring, glassy-eyed, at Draco’s hand wrapped around his wrist. He wrenched away, dropping both Harry’s wrist and the tape measure in one panicked movement.
“Mal-Draco, say his name again,” Hermione ordered, clearly excited by this new avenue of inquiry.
“Arseholes,” Pansy said. Her eyes were wet with indignant tears, but she didn’t let them fall. She saw Draco looking and turned away to survey the empty frames, blinking rapidly, her brow furrowing. Draco knew the feeling: the humiliation and shame that bubbled in his stomach like an unwatched potion, about to boil over at any moment.
They groaned and got to their feet and lazily pulled on their clothes — far more wrinkled than they had been an hour ago. As Draco tucked in his shirt, Harry buttoned up his. They didn’t bother with their cloaks (or, in Harry’s case, waistcoat, bowtie and two layers of cloaks). Lazily, Draco cast an anti-wrinkle charm, but he wasn’t paying much attention and it wasn’t his finest work: his silk shirt definitely bore the signs of a lengthy stay on the floor, but they at least no longer looked like they’d been dragged through a bush backwards.
“Sure.” She rolled her eyes.
“I thought we were going to Hogsmeade,” he said, confused.
They both looked down at his toes and he clucked his tongue. “Right. Yeah. You’re right. Will you come to Ron and Hermione’s after?”
“Oh my god, it’s like we’re back at school. Pinch me,” he heard Dean remark to Seamus.
How fucking
“We’ve confiscated all the contraband that is in view of Muggles,” she said, “and we’ll send through a full report in the morning. The Ministry will be in touch if there’s a hearing.”
Her earnest honesty surprised Draco. Their relationship had never been touchy-feely: they’d built their friendship at school on their dry senses of humour and shared hatred of certain people. It had been a solid foundation that lasted them until adulthood, but Draco had always known that if she needed to, Pansy would throw him under the Knight Bus without a second thought. After all, he would do the same.
The house was silent, and Harry nearly drifted back to sleep before being woken by another knock. He grimaced and rolled out of bed. His face contorted with an enormous yawn as he searched through the mess of clothes on his bedroom floor for a relatively clean t-shirt. Stumbling down the stairs, he wished it was grass under his bare feet rather than the creaking dirty floorboards.
Their lips brushed together in a closed-mouth, innocent peck that quickly deepened. Draco reached up and cupped Harry’s neck as their mouths parted, their breath mingling in short, sharp gasps in the millimetres of space between their faces. The buzzed hairs at the nape of Harry’s neck bristled against Draco’s palm as he dragged his hand up, his fingers tangling in the longer hair at the crown of his head. Harry inhaled sharply as Draco tugged, his own hands coming up to cup Draco’s face and pull him even closer.
“Oh— oh my God. That’s amazing, you’re a wizard! Oh God, I can’t even begin to explain how grateful I am. How much do I owe you?”
It felt bad to be proven right.
Malfoy scoffed and marched up to him. He grabbed Harry’s wrist and guided his hand through a slit in the fabric Harry hadn’t noticed — freeing his arms.
He swallowed and forced his thoughts anywhere else.
. We didn’t have any real reason to be there in the first place, and I felt like an absolute pillock being part of it. Being part of the Aurors in general.”
“What?”
A memory of Draco taking a Muggle’s coat and pouring a mysterious potion over it before handing it back, free of charge. Harry had thought it was oddly charitable behaviour at the time but he hadn’t
“No,” he blurted, but then backtracked. “I mean, I don’t know. I don’t think so. I quit so I don’t really know what the Aurors are doing, but I didn’t know you were here. I woke up and had to come…”
He cleared his throat and coiled the tape measure back into a tight roll, giving him a moment to take a brief respite from whatever the hell
“You’re such an
Harry shook his head. “Got some paperwork to finish.”
want to talk about Potter’s urges in the middle of his friend’s grandma’s funeral. Potter blushed as he realised what he’d said.
“Arnold Naismith.”
“Fine then,” Potter snapped. “You should go back to your friends.” He stormed off.
He tried to make poached eggs on toast for breakfast, but he overestimated his cooking abilities. The yolks were chalky, and the toast was burnt. He got it down with a cup of tea as he stared lugubriously out of the window. It was another beautiful sunny day with barely a cloud in the sky.
,” he spat.
“Mmm,” she hummed. “No pressure but you better make the best robes anyone’s ever seen… I’d like to at least stay open until Christmas. I think my parents have a bet with Granny that this place will fold before then.”
He couldn’t imagine ever getting bored with a routine like that.
“I didn’t notice,” Harry said apologetically.
“Oh, that’s a shame,” Harry said, sounding more crestfallen about the yetis than he was.
,” he spat at the empty air and, hating himself, froze hopefully — waiting for a knock on the door or maybe even for him to Apparate straight into Draco’s room…
He reached for a bottle of wine. “There was a raid,” he said as he poured a large glass. “I thought beforehand it was a bad idea, and that we were overstepping our bounds. Turns out I was right, and even though everyone also knew it was a total bust, they didn’t seem to really
“Yeah...” he trailed off and went to pour himself a large cup of coffee. Ambrose followed, leaning against the countertop.
“Deadly.”
He dawdled as long as he could before getting into position. He pulled a few of the loose threads on the cuffs as Malfoy backed up a couple of steps and surveyed him. In one of the floor-length mirrors, Harry did the same. The outer robe broadened his shoulders and fell straight down to the floor, cutting an intimidating figure. It didn’t button up, leaving the front open to show off the jacket and waistcoat. The stiff collar of the shirt kept Harry’s head up and he subconsciously straightened his spine. Grudgingly, he had to admit that he looked pretty good — even though the trousers had pink and purple unicorns on them.
He leaned back, reclining on his elbows. “I’m listening.”
There was a chorus of thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and everyone leaned forward to load up their plates, squabbling and laughing. Greg came around with a tray of Mai Tais, receiving high fives from Lee and Ginny, which he looked a little mollified by but happy with.
“What’s going on here?”
Harry, on the other hand, shrugged. “Dunno,” he said.
“What are you doing?” Malfoy snapped. “Stop it.”
“Can no one in this department
Blaise snorted. “I could seduce any one of those girls.”
Malfoy stood and threw the chalk back into the open drawer with a Seeker’s precision. “You think that fashion is a waste of time.”
He took a step back, ready to slam the door on Potter’s face, but the other man just followed him, putting a hand out to stop him from closing it.
He sat up again, trying to unbutton faster, and Draco laughed. He ran his hands through Harry’s hair as he worked his way down the shirt, enjoying the slow reveal of his chest — the dusting of hair down his abdominal muscles, disappearing under his belt.
“Do you often bet on your students’ private lives?” Harry asked.
do you think you’re playing at?” he asked as soon as he was close enough to hiss the words. “Have you lost your fucking mind? This is a funeral.”
“Is Mum still in the waiting room?” Ron asked.
“We’re about to call for last orders, thought I’d say in case you want to beat the rush,” he told the group.
She exhaled sharply, nearly a laugh but filled with exasperation.
“So this one was attractive?” Millie asked.
“It’s
“Look, Draco,” he said awkwardly, but he didn’t get another word out before Draco interrupted him.
Draco’s lips thinned and exhaled shortly through his nose. He didn’t answer because there was no way he could win that fight: Draco would live in a swamp for Harry, and they both knew it.
Pansy rolled an olive between her thumb and index finger as she regarded them speculatively. “I haven’t seen any of them in
Once everyone had finished eating, Hermione took the plates to the kitchen sink while Harry boiled a kettle for tea as Ron and Ginny went out to the garden to blast away the carnivorous mushrooms before they attracted gnomes. It was a comfortable, well-practiced dance.
, he tried to reassure himself. What would Ron and Hermione say? They’d point to his fixation with Malfoy in Sixth Year and use words like ‘obsession’ and say he should think about something else.
Robards was at his desk, as always. He was tickling the underside of his chin with the tip of his quill thoughtfully as he scanned whatever document he was reading. He raised his eyebrows curiously at Harry as he strode in, shutting the door behind him.
“This is nicer,” Draco said, with a shrug, “we go to Hogsmeade all the time.”
“Woah,” he said, swaying on his feet as the world righted itself, the vertigo passing as quickly as it had arrived.
The weather had finally given them a brief respite from the heavy, muggy heatwave that had enveloped London for the past month; though the weather forecasters were saying it would be back by next week. Draco took a deep breath, enjoying the sharp coolness at the back of his throat, along with the dark clouds and strong breeze that promised rain any minute.
“Fucking hell,
“And then was Harry the first person you touched?”
gormless could have saved the world.
To his utmost surprise, the Slytherins — as he still thought of the group despite having left Hogwarts nearly a decade ago — had remained as close as ever. Some of them blamed the war for their diminished social circle, but if he was being honest with himself, Draco knew his group of friends had never been much bigger than the six of them that remained today.
a crisis,” Harry protested weakly, wondering why he spent so much of his time nowadays trying to convince people of that.
It was twilight, and thick grey clouds obscured the summit of the Peak District hills. Inside the cosy living room with a light rain pattering against the windowpane, Harry could have closed his eyes and been in the Gryffindor common room. The only difference was the bookshelves that lined every wall, stuffed to the brim with more tomes than Harry had ever read in his life and more befitting of a library than a common room.
He mimed zipping his lips and then sat still, letting Pansy work. She tucked her hair behind her ears, her forehead was creased in concentration as she muttered a long and complicated spell.
He paused to give Patrick Grady a hard stare and then continued, “But for our new case — we’ve noticed a much higher number of reports about cursed mirrors — around double the previous few years, apparently. Behind me you can see Keiran Barrett, the only victim as of yet to survive. Like the others, he’s suffered from third degree burns over his face, neck and hands and cursed with delusions, though St. Mungo’s haven’t been able to determine the exact curse yet. Unfortunately, he hasn’t said a word since his son found him so we won’t be able to interview him. There are files on everyone’s desks — today I just need you to familiarise yourself with the facts and come up with some proposals and timelines for the investigation. I’ve extended our usual afternoon meeting for a debrief. Additionally, we’re taking this case from Misuse of Muggle Artefacts so they’ll be coming in for a debrief tomorrow morning to go over what they’ve done so far…”
“Uh, Potter?” Draco interrupted and nodded at his hand. “Our wands?”
“Apparently he overheard the Muggle you sent finding Greg at the bar,” Pansy said.
friends. Before Saturday, I hadn’t spoken to him in years.”
He still had the summer styles up, even though the winter season was getting underway — he’d always preferred the lighter summer robes; winter styles, with their fur trims and heavy velvet, made him feel like he was at Durmstrang. There was also one set of robes that Draco was so enamoured with, he wanted to keep up the summer robes all year round just so he could keep looking at them. They were a deep teal colour, made of a crisp, starched linen that gave the soft colour a powerful rigidity. The bottom of the robes were hand-embroidered with golden beading, creating bouquets of peacock feathers and gold peacocks with long, twisting tails perched on the lapels. Draco had to stop himself buying them every day with the stern reminder that he was no longer invited anywhere that would befit such grand robes, and also the measly handful of Galleons in his Gringotts account wouldn’t begin to cover the cost.
Kingsley smiled at him. “Well, I think you deserve a bit of time off to figure it out. Anyway,” he said, his tone changing from quietly supportive to energetic. He slapped his thighs as he got to his feet. “I’ve taken up enough of your day. I’ll let you get back to your book,” he said with a knowing smile.
He gave him a friendly, “Bugger off.”
“It’s his total lack of style,” he continued to Pansy. “You’d think that that would help me, but it makes it impossible to picture him in any of the robes I draw because all he
“Draco.” He jumped, not expecting Maggie to be right behind him when he turned to go back to the front desk.
humiliate me at the same time. He must’ve been in heaven.”
me now.”
Harry got hundreds of memos, but he’d also got into the habit of immediately tossing the paper aeroplanes into the bin. He’d got quite good at it. They both looked at the small mountain of planes on the floor by the wastepaper basket, and Harry grimaced.
“So, there I was: probably a little bit concussed, stinking of vinegar, pickles sliding into my socks — and of course, that’s when Potter comes along.”
“No,” he sighed. “There haven’t been any new victims which is good but it’s proving a pain in the arse for finding new leads.”
“Well, of course,” McGonagall said with a laugh. There were two high spots of rosy pinkness on her cheeks that Draco hadn’t noticed. Although her hair was pulled into its usual tight bun, a few wayward strands had got loose and flared wildly around her face at all angles. “If Gilderoy hadn’t had that unfortunate accident, he’d owe me fifty Galleons — I told him you two would end up in a relationship at some point, but he insisted Draco just exhibited classic fan behaviour.”
He threw the file to the side. It skidded to the edge of his desk and toppled to the floor, evidence scattering across the carpet.
“You’d rather have your stomach burst inside you than choke, Nev?”
“Because
“Cool,” he said. “And do you, um, like it?”
. As your boss, I’m ordering you to take the rest of the day off. And tomorrow, actually. You can come back on Wednesday if you’re feeling better, but if you’re still sulking and cutting your hands open, then take the entire week off. Be a normal person and read a trashy book and cry into a pint of ice cream.”
“You can take it off, you know.”
Harry exhaled sharply through his nose. “Thanks, Kingsley.”
Harry glanced over to the Healer. “Is that it?”
“I’ll see you at Sunday lunch,” he said to the others and, with a wave, stepped back into the fireplace.
“What are you doing here?” Harry asked, confused. Speaking was difficult: it felt a bit like talking underwater.
“I don’t mean to, you know. It’s not a
doing here? This is staff only,” he said.
“Now that Ron has a baby to be his number one priority, not you.”
He didn’t remember giving the plan much thought: the burial was to be held at the Manor at five o’clock that evening, so after work he went home to grab a nondescript black robe and then Apparated straight there. Crucially, he hadn’t stopped in the kitchen, where he might have glanced at the calendar hanging on the wall and the circle around the day’s date:
the headline blared above a static photo of shellshocked, ash-covered people running away from a collapsing building.
, he prayed.
“How are you feeling about last night?” she asked gently.
The other man frowned. “No, really, I’m sorry. I didn’t know this was going to happen until this evening. I was working on other cases. I only found out twenty minutes before it started and I wasn’t going to come — I told the team it wasn’t justifiable and that they shouldn’t go but despite what
Harry had been nodding along slowly, but he stilled as the meaning became clear.
Weasley snorted and Draco scowled at him, but Hermione was still waiting for an answer so he had to shrug and say, “That
“Yeah,” Blaise added, “no offense, Draco, but that’s hardly news from
“You should at least report it. There’s an anonymous tip system for Aurors, you know — people using magic in front of Muggles is the kind of thing we could investigate.”
“How’s Rose?”
He fiddled with the apron string as he asked, “Do you guys mind paying it now? I just was planning to go to Gringotts tomorrow, and I said to Layla that I’d take her to dinner tomorrow so I was going to change over some cash so we could go somewhere nice…”
“You should respect your clothes more,” Draco sniffed, walking around to Harry’s right side. He tapped his arm. “Arm out,” he ordered, letting the tape measure unravel in a snake-like movement. Potter lethargically withdrew his hands from his pockets with the urgency of a tortoise; frustrated, Draco grabbed his wrist and pulled his arm straight out to the side. Potter grumbled something under his breath but didn’t resist Draco’s manhandling.
Potter crossed his arms. “Because I don’t think people should get hexed in public bathrooms?”

ring a bell.”
It was
“George, there are children!” Mrs. Weasley scolded as she bustled over from the barbecue, levitating two enormous platters of cooked food.
“Theo says he’ll be here in half an hour, and Greg’s shift finishes at eight,” Blaise said.
“He killed my wife,” the man burst out, outraged.
“With Mum. She’s always nagging us to let her babysit,” Ron said. “So, what’s up? Belinda sent me an owl saying you’d got into a fight with Robards about a raid gone wrong and then you quit?”
kill anyone though,” Theo announced forcefully. He had finished cleaning his shirt and he was now just staring at his reflection, gripping the corner of the sink with white knuckles.
“You never know, I’m very mysterious,” Draco sniffed.
Draco stiffened. He didn’t look at Harry. “Are you going to report me?” he asked, and his voice was cold as ice.
here?”
The thugs appeared to have finished most of the destruction. There were some stragglers leafing through the piles of designs and fashion magazines on the shelves, but the rest were standing around in pairs or threes, talking in low voices and looking disgruntled.
“I’m going to take your collar measurement.” His voice was too loud in the otherwise silent shop. He stepped up onto the pedestal, conscious of the mere inches of air between them. “Don’t hex me,” he ordered.
“A word in my office?” he asked.

you want to be the Hogwarts Groundskeeper, of all things.”
“Thanks,” he said, and flipped through the notes.
“Yeah,” Ron added hastily. “I mean, you were right about him last time, and I’ll never trust that ferret.”
He tried to follow Maggie’s instructions to
“Any more clues?” he stalled.
“I’ve got work tomorrow,” Pansy moaned.
fine,” he said again. It
Harry glanced up. “You are?”
Draco kept his wand in his pocket, he could still hear the Muggles chanting their drinking songs just on the other side of the door.
Obviously, post-war, Draco’s connections were non-existent and so everyone was stunned when, after a year mooching off his parents, Greg announced that he’d got a job as a
But then the gate had opened, creaking on his rusting hinges and someone’s Umbrella Charm spread to cover Draco as they came to stand next to him.
“I was at work,” he said.
“Go home.”
“Why else would I be hanging out in the staff room on a Monday morning? For fun?” he said with an eye-roll. Potter stared at him blankly and Draco sighed. Aware of Maggie’s wide-eyed stare between the two of them, he cleared his throat and asked, “What do you want?”
“Hello,” he said, somewhat awkwardly.
She rolled her eyes. “You sound like my grandma. What kind of seamstress needs History of Magic? I spent all those hours making clothes instead and now look at me now, I’m managing just fine,” she said primly.
Pansy clucked sympathetically and Draco exchanged bewildered glances with Blaise, Theo, and Greg.
“Close the door,” he ordered.
Potter stumbled over his words, his brow furrowing into an angry frown. “I—
“Yes, thank you,” Draco added.
Harry took little urging. He kissed the inside of Draco’s thigh and pulled his hand back. Draco rolled over onto his front and brought his knees up.
“You’re
Draco laughed softly.
He couldn’t say who moved first — he wasn’t even sure if either of them moved. As far as Harry was aware, one moment they were apart and the next they weren’t.
“I got held up,” he said, sprawling down opposite her in the shade. “You look especially gorgeous today.”
As Weasley took his daughter out of the room, a green fire flared in the fireplace and a tall man with long red hair and scars across his face strode into the living room.
Harry shrugged. “Yeah, that’s basically it.”
He would never get to sleep like this; he was fidgeting as much as Potter.
He pulled one of the heavy wooden chairs out as Harry
It was probably better this way. He wouldn’t be wasting a Healer’s time when there was nothing wrong with him; after all, he was quite good at determining the after effects of dark curses. If there was a curse out there that Aunt Bella
“What…” Maggie trailed off. She turned to see what Draco was looking at.
“I was worried you weren’t going to come,” Harry said lightly, but Draco could hear the obvious undercurrent of relief.
He was all-too aware of the barista’s wide eyes and the curious mutters of the people queuing behind him and he shook off Ginny’s hand lightly.
And of
Even after they’d made up, Draco had been going through his own problems with debts and job hunting, so he hadn’t realised just how miserable Pansy had become until she bounded up to him two years ago, a letter accepting her onto the further education mediwitch training course in her hand. Pansy wasn’t the caring type and Draco, though he’d been happy for her, had privately doubted she’d last a year. She hadn’t quit though; instead, she’d taken to nursing like a duck to water.
, he agreed silently
She laughed and pushed him away, but held onto his hand for a moment. “Let me know that you’re okay,” she said, giving him a hard stare.
“Ugh,” Draco grimaced, turning away from them and back to Pansy before they noticed him staring. “What are the chances?
“Twenty-five minutes,” he said.
Every day, Draco sat down in front of a blank piece of parchment and sketched until the charcoal blackened his aching fingers and the models in the portrait frames refused to pose for him anymore, and yet he couldn’t mesh
He growled as another knock interrupted him. Spinning on his foot, he crossed the room in two large strides and threw open the door to see Potter, once again, standing in the alleyway with an expression that was a strange mix of anger, guilt, and blank confusion.
“I’m fine,” Malfoy said shortly as he looked at the sketch of the robes similar to the one he’d sent Harry, except covered in annotations.
“Whatever, Malfoy,” Potter finally said, shaking his head as he backed away.
“That’s good,” he said.
The shouts quieted and the distinct Disapparition
Weasley took a sip of his tea and nodded. “Yeah, he tried a lot of them out on his victims.” He shuddered. “You think this is one of his?”
Maggie’s eyes drilling holes into his temple as he deliberated. He imagined what it would be like to work with her if he said no to Potter and found it was actually pretty easy to picture: she would probably kill him.
Two parallel vertical lines, straight down in a boxy silhouette to which he added broad shoulders — but was that too broad? He glanced at the newest fashion plates hanging on the wall. A model wrinkled his nose at Draco’s work as he spun slowly, showing off the summer dress robes he was wearing. The silhouettes at the moment weren’t boxy and powerful because robes were made from georgette silks, chiffon, organza…
“Do you know the site of the 1612 Goblin Rebellion? Nine letters?”
“St. Mungo’s then?” Potter turned to Draco as the flames died back to embers. Draco sighed, feeling suddenly exhausted.
Three stools pulled up to his workbench. The metal legs scraped against the thin carpet and when he glanced up, Pansy, Millie and Blaise had flocked. They slouched on their stools, holding their wine like champagne flutes at a ball, and regarded him with one raised eyebrow apiece.
She nodded. “Mum was here for the birth.”
Under her breath, Pansy muttered something about
I see.” He was quiet for a moment and then he said, “I definitely wasn’t, just so you know. I haven’t told anyone about us. I definitely wasn’t spilling the beans in my work meetings.”
“Oh, oh fuck
“Sorry,” Harry said, stroking its head with a fingertip between its two ears. He untied the letter from its leg and it took off after ruffling its feathers.
Harry put their mugs down and sat in his spot opposite Ginny. “Carrot cake for brunch before your try-outs… Sorry, I should have offered you something with some kind of nutritional value.”
Draco stood next to a window with his back to Harry. He had a yard of rich emerald fabric laid out across his arm that shifted to a deep shimmering gold in the rays of sunlight. In the corner of the room, Harry recognised his robes carefully laid out on a headless mannequin that had been unceremoniously shoved into a corner.
“What is wrong with you?” she asked, and Harry couldn’t tell if it was rhetorical.
the one turning up at my house in the middle of the night and sucking me off. Pardon me for being a bit confused by the turn of events.”
A small breeze roused itself, fighting against the oppressively muggy air to swirl around Draco. Its cool kiss against his skin wiped away the sheen of sweat. If he closed his eyes, he could imagine it was his mother’s palm, brushing over his forehead and cupping his cheek. It carried with it the scent of freshly cut flowers, feminine and slightly sweet, like her perfume.
, Harry?”
Harry and Draco looked away from each other, saying nothing.
“And you still enjoy it?” Harry asked.
going to go. I think you must have said my name at just the wrong moment and that’s what changed my mind. But I still should have said something during the raid. I was in my right mind by then and I knew that what we were doing was wrong. I just—”
The realisation hit like a brick thrown into a still pond and any other thought Harry tried to have was immediately overwhelmed by its ripples.
Potter jumped back into the conversation. “As long as they’re red, I doubt anyone would really notice.”
?” Harry demanded. He tried to remember if he’d ever seen another witch or wizard in the shop in the many times he’d been.
But he was also different to the stuck-up prig from school, a treacherous part of his brain pointed out. He was kind, apparently, and charitable, and the arrogant rudeness was, more often than not, bitingly funny if you didn’t let it offend you. The new Draco Malfoy drank bad red wine in fad Muggle bars and got greasy chicken takeaways and answered the door to strangers in the middle of the night in come-stained thigh-length satin dressing gowns…
Maggie shook her head. “Don’t be stupid. I can mingle with my own family. Go. I don’t want a
Normally on Thursdays, he’d go back to Ron and Hermione’s after work and the three of them would hang out. That was probably off the table for that Thursday.
“Oh, er, right, yeah, will do,” Potter mumbled and, food in hand, left, glancing over his shoulder at them as he left as if worried they would follow him.
“See you tomorrow, Weasley. Shut the door behind you, please.”
“Sorry again, I’ll be back on Wednesday,” he said over his shoulder as he hurried from the shop, desperate to get at least two walls between Malfoy and what was probably about to be a humiliating verbal dressing down. “Sorry, Gin, I can explain—” he began to say but Ginny was already storming away.
“What kind of—” Harry began to ask but cut himself off as he saw someone over Draco’s shoulder. “Hi, um. Nice to see you all again.”
were the one who wanted us to go back to being strangers,” Draco said.
“I don’t
Pansy and Millie were dressed to the nines: Millie’s dress was blue with gold piping and knee-length with a skirt that flared out in layers like petals. Over the top, she wore a cropped robe that fell to her elbows. Pansy wore a black sheath dress (impeccably tailored to her curves by Draco, of course) with a sheer gold cloak draped over her shoulders, falling to her ankles. Greg had traded his bartender’s uniform of a black t-shirt and jeans for black robes, which fit him nicely, making up for the slightly dull choice of colour. Blaise had opted for a claret cloak and grey trousers, and Theo wore his walnut-coloured robes with artful nonchalance.
“Good,” Draco smirked. “That was the plan. Now help me out of it.”
“Why not?” he pressed, not sure why it bothered him so much.
“There aren’t any sleeves,” he grunted. “Am I just not supposed to hold anything all night?”
“Come in,” he said, leading them through an entrance hall and to the head of a narrow corridor. The door at the end of the hallway was open, and general sounds of merriment floated down. “The jubilee is in the garden.”
He shrugged. “As you’d expect. He called me blind and unfashionable.” He caught her giving him a sideways glance and frowned. “What?” he asked.
A cruel part of him immediately said it was the latter, but an equally loud and less vindictive part of him said that Potter didn’t seem the sort of person to laugh at Draco for having feelings, even if he didn’t reciprocate them.
“No, I’m sorry, I’m pestering you with all these questions when it’s the last thing you want to think about.”
Despite not being a full Healer, she’d learnt some tricks over the last few years. He winced as she cast some kind of diagnostic spell that felt like someone was slowly lowering him into an ice bath.
“Can you go get a bartender? There’s one guy on the bar — shaved head, big man, can you tell him there’s a situation in the toilets with Theo and Draco?”
Draco winced. “Something’s come up.”
Draco remembered Potter’s expression whenever that Creevey boy asked him for a photo at Hogwarts and smirked. “Yeah, you might as well ask.”
Harry was wrapped up in his own thoughts. Draco would have guessed they were similar to his own, if Harry hadn’t then looked at the clock on the wall and sighed.
“It’s just the other buzzer. Stay there,” he ordered and strode towards the back. Harry heard another door open and a feminine, frantic voice spilled through into the shop.
When he’d first joined the Aurors, he hadn’t expected there would be quite so many meetings about future meetings. His hands itched to go back to his office and take a look at the evidence for himself. Robards eventually finished setting out the day’s schedule and dismissed everyone. As they stood and gathered their belongings, heading for their offices, he called out Harry’s name.
“Yeah. How’s Hermione?”
“Yes, yes, I said it’s not a big deal. If you want me at the wake, I can come. Neither of us is about to die, I promise.”
His mind wandered back to Harry on his knees, his eyes wide as he stared up at Draco, mouth hanging open so prettily… His cock stirred in his trousers.
“It’s a bit weird though, right? I mean,
“Uh. Sure,” Harry said, trying to match her casual tone, as if his ex-girlfriend following him home late in the evening was a routine development. “What are you doing?” he asked as soon as they spun into the living room at Grimmauld Place.
“Don’t make me look like a plonker.”
Harry was so busy thinking about leads and witnesses and motives that an entire week passed without him noticing, and Robard’s paperwork began to gather dust in Harry’s office.
“So?” Millie asked.
He hadn’t seen Draco speechless before. His lips parted slightly, his eyes darted from Harry to the corners of the room, as if someone was hiding there, waiting to yell
“Come on,” Harry laughed and pushed off the wall. Draco straightened his shirt and followed him out to the garden.
“Well,” Robards clapped his hands, rubbing his palms together like the excitable Muggle TV chef that Harry liked to watch on lazy Sunday mornings. “That’s the whole point of these meetings. I’m not retiring tomorrow, we have lots of time to get you ready for leadership.”
sign, wizards saw the shop front as it was meant to be: a cherry-wood door with frosted glass,
“Some kind of cross between a Summoning Spell and a Taboo?” Hermione was muttering, not paying attention to them. “It’s definitely not a normal spell, but maybe an experiment gone wrong. When did this start?” she asked.
Greg’s cocktails.
He’d been in the Auror training programme and it hadn’t taken much effort to find out the time and place for the funeral. After all, the Malfoys were still under Auror watch at that point, their every move documented.
“I’ll get an Earl Grey tea,” Ginny ordered and then asked, “Are we having in or taking away, Harry?”
Still trying to put on the final robe, Harry scuttled from the changing cubicle. The material felt flimsy, and there were a few threads hanging down across his hands and dragging on the floor. Silver pins glinted in the seams. He walked with his arms held out and his legs wide to avoid tearing anything. It felt like everything would unravel with one wrong move.
He looked up to see Robards in the doorway, watching him pack up his stuff.

“Wow, that’s effective,” Bill said, and reached into the back pocket of his jeans for his wand. “How did it happen?”

It worked, she laughed lightly and pulled her hand away, slapping him lightly on the arm. “Fuck off,” she said jovially and then sighed happily. “Merlin,
?” Potter repeated, looking around the establishment pointedly. “Bit beneath you, isn’t it?”
Ron took the opportunity of a night off fatherhood to drink so much whiskey that Hermione — drinking only coffee because she was breastfeeding (because apparently that was a thing) — had to take him into bed within the hour. Ginny had training in the morning and left at the reasonable hour of 2 o’clock in the morning. Luna, Neville, and Harry stayed up for a few more hours, talking about how Hogwarts had changed and what their old school friends were up to and eventually fell asleep sprawled across the couches and floor.
“Better to be safe than sorry,” Pansy groused.
, but apparently not.”
The sight of Greg working was always going to be
“‘Jubilee’?” Greg echoed doubtfully under his breath as they obediently followed the house elf’s pointed finger.
Screaming starlings in the evergreen outside his window woke him. His pyjamas were damp with sweat. Feeling no more well rested than before he’d gone to sleep, he dragged himself up and got dressed.
As Draco waited for the fray to subside, he glanced up and saw Harry watching him with a small smile. His elbow was on the table and his fingers were resting on the bruises Draco had sucked into his neck. Draco couldn’t stop the enormous grin that spread across his face in response.
“Not if they were Muggles,” Millie said primly, crossing her arms to highlight her cleavage. Blaise’s eyes lingered on it for a moment and Draco could
The raid file slid from his desk, a few loose pieces of parchment falling like leaves on the carpet. With a sigh, he crouched down to pick them up — his various cracking joints a painful reminder that time was marching on — and read through the report.
“Are you, sir?” Harry hadn’t heard any rumours of the sort, but it was hardly surprising news. Robards must have passed retirement age a decade ago.
His wand woke him at 8 o’clock with its high-pitched screaming alarm he’d forgotten to turn off. Eyes fused shut with sleep, he clumsily slapped his hand over his bedside table until he found it and performed the counter charm to shut off the noise. The sunlight trickled in through the small gap in his curtains and he rolled onto his stomach and buried his face in his pillows, knowing he
he is. Finally.”
be. Maybe Harry had been half in love with the man for the last decade, but did it really count if he’d been too dense to realise it until now? Could he even call it love if neither of them had any clue what was happening? He didn’t think so. Really, he’d lost nothing that afternoon other than a pesky curse.
he thought but he didn’t say.
“I wouldn’t know. I didn’t even get to try it before I got caught in the middle of an Auror raid,” he said, glancing pointedly at the papers.
“She’s getting better,” Harry said defensively. “She asked me whether I was dating anyone new last Sunday — and not in that way where she’s clearly hoping I’ll say no.”
But Draco wasn’t done. He then handed him a waistcoat and watched with raised brows as Harry struggled with the buttons. After that came a jacket, and then a floor-length cape.
“I don’t know. I can’t say I know Malfoy too well. Maybe you need to give him some space to stew? Spend awhile coming up with a decent apology?”
“Hey Harry,” Hermione chirped.
She nodded. “You said that Thorne tried a lot of experimental magic, right?”
He thought of the thump of You Know Who’s body on the floor of the Entrance Hall and the relief that had washed through him like someone had tipped a bucket of cold water onto his head.
Ron laughed. “Want to swap? I’ll do the paperwork if you stay up all night with Rose.”
When he came back to work after the curse had been lifted, he’d been ready to
Draco laughed brightly and leant forward, pressing their lips together until it was hard for Harry to breathe.
“You’re looking well,” Kingsley said, raising his voice to be heard over the screaming whistle of the kettle. Harry grabbed a couple of mugs out of the cupboard.
Ginny nodded. “I think you made the right decision, if that’s worth anything.”
Harry’s eyebrow twitched. “Hermione?” he checked.
Draco glared at him, and they lapsed into silence. Draco had run out of things to look at in the plain room, so he stalked over to the chair next to Potter and dropped into it with a sigh.
! Sort of. It’s just a lot of responsibility, y’know?”
“I don’t know. What would you like to do?”
“It’s a leaf. And some berries,” he said desperately.
. “Maybe just one a year. A big one, like the War Recovery Ball.”
“Do I need to call St. Mungo’s?” Draco asked. “Are you having a mental breakdown? You’re at a fucking graveyard. What did you think it was? A birthday party?”
“You know,” he said, leaping to a new topic, “I ran into Wood at the pub the other night — he said he’s heard Cormac McLaggen is also aiming for the England team.”
“Tired,” she said through a yawn, and smiled ruefully. “It was like she changed her mind about wanting to be born halfway through.”
He followed the line of leaving witches and wizards. They had temporarily opened a Floo Network in a nearby Muggle church, and everyone trickled through the doors into the echoing stone building. Draco waited his turn and then took a good handful of Floo Powder.
“Uh.”
the daggers being thrown at her through the wall.
Potter gazed over at the congregation, a frown tugging at the corners of his lips. “Maggie Malkin? Has she, um, seen me here?”
He was hard again. The thin satin tented obviously around his erection, and he could feel Potter through the soft cotton of his joggers. The elastic waistband was easy to pull down, and he gave a silent thanks to the Muggle clothes designers who apparently made clothes with the sole purpose of being easily removable. He wasn’t wearing underwear and Draco’s voice was ragged as he whispered, “
“They’re vines!” Draco insisted.
“What did the spell that hit you look like?” Hermione interrupted their squabbling. She’d pulled another book off the shelf and had it open on top of the other enormous volume.
Draco shrugged. “Up to you. If you don’t want to pay, you can wait a week or take it to the Auror tailors.”
“Salazar save us,” Millie said.
“Hello Draco,” Luna said, drifting over from the other group. Her long blonde hair was plaited in a complicated braid that she’d looped around her neck like a scarf. Bedazzled radishes hung from her ears and she wore a knitted jumper depicting a farmyard scene, Draco guessed. He couldn’t be sure because the jumper was inside-out. It was a comical sight standing next to Harry in his dress robes.
He ducked his head, unable to continue to meet her gaze. “It wasn’t really a conscious decision; I honestly couldn’t tell you.”
“So why did you run away?” she asked, carving another bite of cake with the side of her fork.
thank you for that, Granny. But paying for a plate of eggs on toast doesn’t mean that you get to come into
“Oh, she’s over with Ron’s mum,” Hermione said, pointing to where Mrs. Weasley was sitting on a sun lounger with a baby in her hands.
“Acceptable?” Harry asked, holding his arms out. The top two buttons of his shirt were undone and his glasses were perched wonkily on the bridge of his nose. Draco straightened them and tucked a lock of hair behind his ear.
to investigate. What if you were hurting people?”
know?”
“Cab sav?”
The whistling of the kettle momentarily drowned out the sniping and grumbling going on behind him and by the time the water reached a steady boil, the conversation had ambled back around to a familiar argument.
“Just good? You don’t have anything else to say?” he asked, mocking. “Surely you can do better than that, Potter?”
Draco yanked himself from Potter’s grip. “I’m fine,” he said, but the words were gravelly, like he’d picked up a lifelong smoking addiction. Self-consciously, he cleared his throat.
Feeling like someone had punched him in the gut, he said goodbye to the Healer (and signed an autograph, then posed for a picture with the receptionist), and Apparated home.
“Yeah,” Draco agreed. Nothing would ruin the serene atmosphere in the bedroom quite like Pansy’s mad witch cackle.
“Um… They’re black?”
“Merlin, Potter, I’m
Above his head, he heard several pairs of feet lumbering down the stairs to the kitchen. A moment later, Ron and Hermione arrived, followed by a half-asleep Neville.
“And what did you find out?” It was impossible to tell from his dry tone whether he was interested or sarcastic.
’. He might have got a bit heated in his questioning of the cleaner (some had described it as an interrogation) and he regretted raising his voice, but for fuck’s sake, it was an
He arrived at Malkin’s Magical Tailoring five minutes before closing time, Malfoy was the first thing he saw when we walked through the door. He stood in the doorway to the staff room, leaning against the door jamb with his arms crossed against his chest. He was in a similar outfit to Monday, but this time his suit was navy blue and Harry thought it was a shame he hadn’t been sorted into Ravenclaw.
?” Millie demanded.
Harry shook his head. “We won
“How come you’re still dressed?” Harry asked breathlessly as he shrugged out of his shirt, tossing it on top of the robes and falling back on top of Draco, grinding his groin down onto Draco’s erection as they kissed deeply. Draco moaned, his hands splayed across Harry’s bare back, his nails scratching against his smooth skin. Harry tugged at his robes, pulling it down his forearms. Draco sat up and let him pull it off entirely.
“Do you want to hold her?” Hermione asked.
“Of course.”
“We know, Harry,” Hermione soothed.
Draco tipped his head up to the ceiling and closed his eyes despairingly. Harry took the opportunity to ogle him, wolfishly devouring the sight of his profile, his long eyelashes curling against his cheeks, the sharp line of his jaw…
“So, what are you going to do with all your new free time?” he asked.
Bored and frustrated, he threw the magazine he’d been idly flicking through into the corner of his bedroom and flopped onto his bed. It was getting late. He turned down the gramophone volume to a murmur with a flick of his wand and changed into his pyjamas.
feeling jealous because that would be ridiculous. After all, he was incredibly successful in his own right, even without mentioning Voldemort: he was about to become the youngest Head Auror in history, he had a surrogate family in the Weasley’s who loved and supported him, and he knew that if he wanted to be in a relationship there was no shortage of people interested. His closest friends might be starting families but he knew, rationally, he was a part of those families too, so it made no sense to feel insecure.
Theo attempted to say something but only succeeded in groaning wordlessly.
“I had a bet with Pomona that you two wouldn’t be married until you were at least in your fifties,” she said sadly. “I suppose there’s not much chance of me holding onto that galleon?”
“Ron fire-called me,” she said.
He turned back to his mother. Uncle Morpheus wasn’t a particularly comfortable backrest, and he fidgeted, trying to find the best position where the gravestone didn’t press into his spine.
“Master Potter,” Kreacher croaked.
“Nope, black’s non-negotiable,” Potter interrupted. “What do you say? Deal?”
Curious, he followed. Careful of the pinned clothes, he crept down from the podium and into a workroom. He kept his back pressed to the wall and peered into the Muggle dry-cleaner front where Malfoy was talking to a woman who couldn’t be older than twenty.
“No, I think I’ll stay.”
She stiffened. “Really?”
about the colour of Malfoy’s robes?
, and then she said, louder, “Are you seeing her soon? Will you remind her to owl me if she needs anything?”
and how she wants me to be the next Madam Malkin. Which, yeah, I get, but she’s not even that old! I don’t know why she’s so obsessed with making sure there’s someone to take over her shop.”
He’d dozed off in a hundred classes, staring at Potter messing around with his friends, seething with hatred — but a different hatred to how he felt about Granger and Weasley. His hatred for Potter made him squirm in his seat, wouldn’t let him take his eyes off him when they were in the same room, an intense, primal hatred that maybe wasn’t hatred after all.
, of all the people? And not only Malfoy, but snogging in the middle of a public storefront like horny teenagers who couldn’t control themselves?
,” Draco snarled and when Potter opened his mouth to protest, he put his hand on the door. “Save it for someone who believes you,” he snapped and slammed the door in his face.
to go to the stupid party, just so I can show them off.”
“No! I haven’t enjoyed being an Auror in years. He just made some good points when he was screaming at me.”
and then barely paid attention to any of us all night. Everyone noticed it.”
“You know you
“If you’re here for opening once again this
“Well, if you can only imagine Potter in Muggles clothes then why are you trying to put him in a full set of wizarding dress robes?”
Harry
While he was at it, he shrugged off the robe entirely. It pooled in a silky pile at his ankles.
“What are you doing?” he asked.
“Harry’s always been good at this kind of stuff — it’s like Defense in the Third Year,” Hermione pointed out, wiping her brow.
“Well, I was going to have a quick word, Potter, but I can wait until our meeting on Friday if you’d rather.”
the pattern on file.”
Harry mumbled something under his breath, but did as Bill asked. They heard a door shut and then Bill turned to Draco and splayed his hand out between them in a ‘
“Modern. Mother tried insisting on eighteenth century but I just find it
out of the blue, Harry wasn’t as oblivious as Hermione and Ginny liked to insinuate. He’d sat in enough meetings with Robards and Kingsley to know that Head Auror was a guarantee for him if he wanted it at some point, but he hadn’t even entertained the thought that that point might be
“Oh right. Yeah. Theo and Drogo, right?”
?” Ron asked, nonplussed. “I mean, we’ve been on plenty of terrible raids. Like that one with the hippogriff in the cupboard — if any raid was going to break you, I’d have thought that would’ve done it.”
strands of hair in the shower.
The resulting compromise was that the cleaners didn’t come into his office much any more, which suited everyone (including the mice) just fine.
“Guess he can’t help but be a fucking martyr,” Pansy said.
Draco didn’t say that he’d never held a baby before — it’s not like there were hundreds running around the manor. He kept his mouth shut and adjusted his arms into a cradling shape that was apparently suitable as Harry gently relinquished the infant.
“I feel like doing a good deed and we have lots of stain remover,” Malfoy interrupted. “Please. Good luck with the job interview.”
Draco sighed and stretched his neck back, scrutinising the Muggles behind the bar. He assumed Layla was the tiny blonde woman pulling pints in a stretchy tank top that showed off her impressive cleavage. Very much Greg’s type.
“Excellent. Dismissed then.”
“I’m sorry,” he whispered against Draco’s lips.
“Just because you’re incapable of noticing that other people put effort into their clothes, doesn’t mean others around you are as obtuse. Noticing someone’s wearing clothes with holes in them on a date doesn’t make them a bad person. Take this off, the waistcoat is gaping.” He tugged the robe and the suit jacket off and hung them carefully on a hanger.
Between the dirt and lack of signposted opening hours or cost, Muggles rarely came in.
“Gin, Ginny, wait!” he called as he ran after Ginny who was at the mouth of the alley, turning right down the street, the bag of books clutched tightly in her fist. He caught up to her and tried to match her pace.
Had she been
“Well, what did you talk
Perplexed, Harry sat on his own robe. Draco shimmied over so there was barely an inch of space between them. Harry thought it was odd and then doubted himself.
“No,” Draco said flatly.
“Fine, deal. Get up there,” he ordered, pointing to the pedestal in the middle of the section as walked over to a set of drawers in the corner, pulling out a tape measure and a Quick-Quotes Quill. He set the latter up on a piece of parchment and turned on Potter, who was still loitering on the threshold.
“I owe you for that time in the toilets, I’d have been mincemeat if you hadn’t barged in,” he said grandly. “It’s the least I could do.”
“Right,” Harry said with no emotion, and shut the door on his face quickly and waited for the silhouette to disappear before collapsing onto a chair. He threw the file on the desk and put his elbows on his knees, raking his hands through his hair and balling them into fists.
Potter hummed, looking around. “This is a weird place. Goyle works here?”
“I see,” Robards said. “And what evidence do
He was in a formal sitting room examining a large tapestry of the Black family tree looking at his parents’ names when Harry joined him.
“Morale must be great,” Ron snorted.
He’d been quite proud of the annotated design last night, but in the fresh light of day, they were clearly wrong. They were nice robes but they weren’t right for Potter: they’d wear him, rather than the other way around. Draco could easily imagine how he would spend the whole night fidgeting and escaping self-consciously at the first possible moment.
“Right,” he said dully, his fingers tightened around the pile of paperwork in his lap.
Remembering Malfoy’s constant snipes at Ron’s hand-me-down robes, Harry snorted in disbelief. “Yeah, sure.”
, his traitorous brain pointed out, unwilling to let him go more than ten minutes without thinking of the stupid blonde prick) and he’d yet to come up with a satisfactory answer.
,” she said, her voice very small. “I’m sorry — I don’t think sometimes.”
He’d changed into a different outfit: grey trousers and an olive green jacket with cuffs that gripped his wrists tightly. He kept his shirt sleeves rolled down. There wasn’t a single cloud in the sky which meant that the park was crammed with scantily clad Muggles, sunbathing on towels or playing games that were all centred around throwing and catching an assortment of different shaped objects. No one spared him a second glance as he passed.
? You don’t say.” He imbued his voice with an appropriate amount of scathing so it was clear he was insulting Potter. “What kind of robes?”
“Um, okay.
She didn’t answer, just looked up at him with her eyebrows raised and lips pursed. Harry got the distinct impression that if he was holding a Remembrall, it would be scarlet. The silence stretched between them as Harry tried to sift through all their conversations in the last week — had they talked about Ron and Hermione’s dinner? Ron had only mentioned it to him on Wednesday at work, hadn’t he? And he hadn’t seen Ginny until today…
“What about you, though?”
professional-Auror expression.
time — admit it.”
“Any luck?” Hermione asked.
For the last decade, it felt like everyone else had already made the decisions for him. Recently, his activities had been a roulette wheel of work, gym, home, friends.
something to laugh about when Harry chuckled.
Draco suddenly turning up at all hours, across Harry’s life? He felt nauseous, his mouth filling with the taste of bile as he considered the kiss and the blow job — both the hottest moments in Harry’s life but also completely inexplicable. What did Draco gain from it? Was he trying to get Harry on his side, lull him into a false sense of security?
“Thank you,” Harry said again.
care about,” he said, quieter now. His voice was devoid of any emotion and he forced his face into a scowl because without it, he might just look very, very sad.
“If you do as I say, it’ll take a lot less time, Potter,” Draco said.
Potter glanced down at his chest. “Uh. Yeah, I do. I just went through my quota for the year already.”
“Yes, they are.”
“When you saw Malfoy?” Hermione asked.
,” Harry spluttered.
“Dare I even ask what happened to this?”
Draco smiled sadly. “I guess so. But I’m okay, don’t worry. I have bad memories of funerals.”
“Are you talking about
“And the crowd goes wild,” he murmured to himself, throwing the Snitch up and down a few times. Somewhere on the ground, a crow cawed.
They chatted some more about who could clean a kitchen the quickest, and then the conversation ambled on in the way it did amongst a group of close friends: topics flowing easily with no rhyme or reason.
“She needed a few drops of a potion we brew in our staff kitchen that costs about three Knuts. I charge you a premium because I have to put up with your company for longer.”
Hand still in his pocket, he considered locking the door and teaching this
Draco considered him, and the moment stretched out between them. “Okay,” he said, and a slow smile crawled across his lips. “If you promise to wear the robes.”
“Fuck,” Harry gasped, resting his forehead against Draco’s. “What about tonight?” he asked, his breath fanning across Draco’s lips, his mouth brushing tantalisingly against Draco’s as he spoke. “Do you forgive me for yelling at you on your doorstep?”
Maggie was, in many ways, the ideal employer. She was an excellent designer, filled with boundless creativity and the kind of optimism that one could only achieve before they turned twenty. One could potentially criticise her optimism as venturing toward naive fantasy, but she’d left Hogwarts after failing all but two OWLs and managed to open the tailor within a year and then, more impressively,
be nice to complain a bit. He sighed. “You can’t make this a big deal.”
?” Draco challenged.
“Your robes. Of course,” Draco said, folding the fabric in half again and again until it couldn’t get any smaller. He stared down at the desktop, smoothing his hands over the material. “They’re over there. You can sort out how much you owe with Maggie.”
And yet, despite that, Harry still wanted to see him. One day after he threw his career directly into the bin, all he wanted to do was see Draco Malfoy. Not for sex (though that had been mind-blowing) — he just wanted to
“Really?” she pressed. “I know you wanted it when you were sixteen, but that was ten years ago. It’d be normal for you to have changed your mind.”
“Come here,” Draco murmured, sliding his hands from his waist to the back of his neck, dragging Harry down to kiss him. He nipped softly at Harry’s lower lip until his mouth parted with a sigh. He plucked the glasses from his nose and dropped them onto the bedside table.
annoying.
“Fine,” he said shortly. “I have some conditions though.”
In any case, it was probably too late — it was already twenty-five past five. Through the clouded glass of his door, he could see the vague silhouettes of the other Aurors gathering, sorting out tactics.
He shrugged. “You always suited Hogwarts. I would have thought you’d want to be in the countryside or the wilderness. Somewhere” — he searched for the right word — “light.”
“Then that’s fine,” Ginny said, throwing her hands up, nearly spilling the amber liquid. “I’m not telling you to turn down the promotion if you want it but if you
“I thought you wanted me to show off your work.” Harry’s voice was raspy, and his pupils were conspicuously dilated.
Not liking the direction his thoughts were going in, he sat up and pushed his broom forward again; the wind whipped through his hair as he picked up speed. He kept low to the ground, weaving between trees that marked the boundaries of farmers’ fields, his knees brushing against hedgerows. It was impossible to think about anything else when all of his attention was focused on not crashing.
,” he said, “I’m simply in
“You’re a miracle, Hermione,” he said.
She rolled her eyes and tore off a bit of baguette. “Don’t act so hard done by, you got to stare at Potter.”
Maybe Harry had once thought like that. Years ago, when he was a child, choices seemed to be a simple case of right and wrong. Good versus evil. He didn’t see it like that anymore. Everything was shades of grey and, as he got older, the shades became even more indistinguishable from each other.
Ron was the last to leave the briefing room. He clapped Harry on the shoulder as he passed, his arms full of papers. “See you tomorrow, mate.”
She jumped as the bread glanced off her ankle and glared up at him. “What time do you call this?” she demanded.
“Was it really?” she said, writing it in.
Pulling his sleeves back down, he got to his feet, brushing the grass off his cloak. “I need to go. I think I just realised I’ve been an idiot about Potter’s robes. But I’ll come back. Someone needs to do some weeding.”
His cock ached, and he pressed his hips forward, trying to get some relief from the friction between their bodies. He was one second away from hitching a leg and wrapping it around Malfoy’s hip to grind down when an unpleasantly loud, discordant buzz broke the tension.
His knees rested on the front of the pedestal, and his head was in line with Potter’s groin but he most definitely wasn’t thinking about that. He pressed his thumb against the centre seam of the cheap trousers Potter was wearing, holding the tape measure up to his crotch. Potter had listened to Draco’s instructions and was standing so ramrod straight that Draco could feel his thigh quivering under his touch.
“Two years.” She made no attempt to continue the conversation.
“Why you looked like you were sucking a lemon when I brought up your promotion and” — she waved her hand in the air, gesturing towards all of Harry — “talk about
“Have your parents visited yet, Hermione?”
“And would he have anything to do with the sudden decision that the Aurors are corrupt and not worth working for?” Ginny asked pointedly, and Harry’s blush deepened.
The illustration in this chapter was created by
“I can’t do that.”
“I…” he began, but he didn’t know what came next.
“No one turns up on time to a party, Potter,” he said, checking his watch. They were only (a fashionable) two hours late.
“It’s alright. Hard to tell with all the patterns,” he lied.
“Oh shut it, stop pretending to be a snob. You haven’t mopped the Manor in years, don’t deny it.”
She waved away his concerns. “No one’s looking at us. Just, here — scoot closer to the tree.”
Oh. The funeral.
“Although I maintain that you could have been clearer about your feelings,” Draco said, “I’ll admit that I
skull that you’re not wanted here?” Draco yelled. He wanted to punch him more than anything in the world.
Stop whatever line of thought you’ve got going on,” he said, holding up a finger. “We have a strained relationship from that time my Aunt imprisoned him in the basement while she tortured his friend. And numerous other occasions that are just as awkward, trust me.”
“Good to hear,” Draco said faintly.
“Maybe she wants to retire. Spend her golden years in a paisley bikini in the French Riviera,” he joked.
“Why else would you be at a shitty Muggle takeaway next to the gym I go to?”
It had become his special project and the end result was fantastic, if he said so himself.
the annoying pests, knowing he’d get a lecture about their importance in the ecosystem or something, so he quietly did as he was bid. After wheeling the mountain of lumpy, writhing bags to the porch, he rejoined the others inside for a quick shower and a glass of Pimm’s in the sun.
“I saw the ticket turned green—”
“Thank you so much. I’ll definitely leave you a five-star review.”
at a M
“Hmm, maybe. Are you having a good time there?” He directed the question at Blaise, who had spent the entire conversation leering at a group of women in revealing outfits.
He was in the middle of removing ‘
“Harry? You okay?” Ginny asked, lightly resting her arm on his shoulder and peering up at him.
He winced. “Is he angry?”
Luna filled in the gaps during the day when the others were at work or being parents. She showed up on the doorstep of Grimmauld Place with a smile and a mystifying task to do. One day she spent hours clearing nargles from the chimneys while Harry sat next to her, handing her an assortment of handmade tools. Other days, she wouldn’t step inside the house. Instead, they went on long walks around London where Luna would act like a tour guide, pointing out her favourite park benches or taking him on a five-mile detour to look at a lamppost she thought was especially pretty. Sometimes her friend, Rolf Scamander, joined their walks and he would point out signs of eelmen in the Thames and give Harry tips on how to keep Horklumps out of the back garden after he told him about Ron and Hermione’s infestation.
His knee-jerk reaction was to say no. It went against nearly every instinct he had to help out Potter in any easy way (though the thought of sending his least-favourite person to the Recovery Ball in frilly, over-embellished robes lit a small flame of perverse joy in him).
“Do you mind fetching my mug from the kitchen? I miss having my morning tea in it,” she added casually to Harry as Kreacher disappeared with a loud crack and then reappeared with Ginny’s mug in his hand.
“Do you want
“Because it’s the War Recovery Ball?” he said.
?” Draco mouthed at Pansy. She ignored him.
His friends weren’t too bad, he decided as he grabbed the broom. The Muggle door opened with its accompanying buzz and he heard Theo’s booming voice.
“Yes — but I didn’t see anything,” he said quickly. “I got hit by some spell and spent all of the action lying on the floor.”
“I had it under control!” Draco protested.
Harry knocked softly and waited to be invited in before he poked his head around the door. The clock behind the nurse’s station had informed him it was a few minutes past eleven, but St. Mungo’s was still bustling with life. It was far past visiting hours but, hey, what was the point in being the Chosen One if Harry couldn’t occasionally use it to his advantage?
“I’m taking your silence as an admission that I’m right,” he said cockily, that stupid smug smirk playing at the corner of his lips. His eyes flickered down to the trousers and Harry was acutely aware of how thin the unicorn fabric was and how little it would hide. He didn’t dare look down at himself.
“I like it long,” Pansy piped up.
Robards stood abruptly and punched a stack of papers on his desk, cutting Harry’s tirade off. He looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him.
evidence? He ground his teeth.
“You purposefully misled me.”
“Also, your tab,” he said, pulling out a receipt from the front pocket of his black apron. Against each of the drinks he’d written their price in Galleons and added up the total for each of them. Draco couldn’t help but be impressed; he’d never thought Greg would be capable of any kind of
. There were surely laws against a Malfoy and a Weasley — it would go against the very fabric of nature.
“Isn’t it what you’ve been aiming for since you joined the Aurors?”
Draco jumped, the fabric falling from his hand and slithering to the floor with a hiss. His eyes narrowed when he saw Harry and he bent over to pick it up.
Draco arched an eyebrow. How was it fair that it was
“They took half our equipment,” Draco snarled.
,” he snapped, yanking the door open to find — “Pans?”
“Fuck’s sake,” he muttered, the words strangled by the lump in his throat. He crossed back into the wizarding half of the shop front, where Millie had righted mannequins and was busy gathering all the robes. She’d charmed a broom to follow her around, sweeping up shards of glass.
Despite knowing the most about it, Draco had clung to his fervent hatred of Muggle fashions for the longest time, but he eventually was won over when Millie pointed out if he kept putting the bare minimum of effort into his Muggle looks, everyone would think he was unfashionable. He started paying attention to the Muggles he saw on the streets and even, to his utmost shame, bought a couple of Muggle fashion magazines which he smuggled into the Manor and read under his duvet like a teenager who’d just discovered pornography.
He had a bowl of cereal for lunch — food that required minimal preparation — and then went to his bedroom, like a teenager on his summer holidays. He didn’t think about work once as he lay on top of his sheets, listening to music on his gramophone at an obnoxiously loud volume and flicking through gossip rags. He caught up with the shenanigans that had occurred on the Weird Sisters’ latest tour and the rumours that Celestina Warbeck had secretly been in a decade-long relationship with a woman.
“I think St. Mungo’s are sending over a couple more Emergency Healers any moment now, so it shouldn’t be too long.” He didn’t sound particularly confident. Someone called for Potter and he glanced at Draco uneasily. “I’m just going to…” He trailed off, nodding towards the senior witch who was calling his name.
“Harry, come on now,” Robards spluttered, “you’ve had an arduous night. Why don’t you go home, take tomorrow off — have some time to relax and really think this through.”
“Robards cleared it,” Ambrose reassured him. “It’s run by a former Death Eater so they want to be careful.”
The solution to everything: yet more meetings. He could just imagine sitting opposite the Minister of Magic, cold cups of tea at their elbows as they slowly went through the Auror handbook, each minor revision requiring an hour-long discussion that eventually led to the agreement it was best to keep it as it was. The meeting would take two days and they wouldn’t make a single worthwhile change.
He thought he actually liked the latter more.
More pointed looks. Harry was getting really tired of being left out of these secret conversations.
“Sorry,” he blinked and realised he was
“Same,” Draco laughed and then yawned. “Your bed is dangerously comfortable. I could fall asleep here any moment.”
“It suits you. Very Slytherin,” Harry said truthfully as he closed the door behind him.
The wrought-iron gate creaked as he pushed it open, grumbling about its lack of care. He walked past rows of his ancestors, barely looking at the lichen-spotted tombstones that, even with their magical protections, had weathered and greyed under the centuries of Wiltshire weather. The two white headstones at the back of the plot were so clean compared to the other graves that they practically glowed.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “And you don’t want to take on the job to make sure I don’t mess it up, if it means that much?”
Harry didn’t start the argument this time. He and Ginny had different attitudes towards forgiveness, one of the reasons they’d slowly drifted apart over the years. While he was eager (
“I do
“But you agreed with me!” Draco said.
As the kettle heated, Harry turned. Leaning against the cooker top, he watched Kingsley, who was looking around Grimmauld Place’s kitchen with interest.
they were the perfect length, just hitting Potter’s ankles but not dragging on the ground behind him; and the subtle tailoring Draco had done around the waist emphasised his muscular frame, giving him an aura of someone powerful and in control, even with Potter’s terrible posture. He’d made Potter look undeniably
“Just because I don’t wear brand-new designer robes doesn’t mean I dress badly.”
He watched the bravado slide from Malfoy’s face as Harry stared intently. His brow smoothed out and his eyes widened, flicking down to Harry’s mouth and then staying there. Harry licked his lips.
Potter looked disappointed but resigned; however, as he went to pick up the robes and leave, Maggie piped up.
To his immense frustration, Potter noticed this. His eyes narrowed and he frowned pointedly at the mess Draco had been lying in. “What were you hit with? There were some nasty curses flying around.”
He tuned back into the conversation where Ron was interrogating Ginny about Quidditch.
“And the witness?”
Desperately, Draco tried to find the exit, but everywhere he turned, Harry triumphantly stared back. He was enshrined in marble, showing off the Quidditch Cup. He was riding on the back of a dragon. He was in a bathroom, standing over a boy with a ferocious expression and the floor was painted red…
He raised his head an inch and freed his hand from beneath his temple so he could reach down and stroke himself. He was so sensitive, every nerve ending so fried, that it only took a couple of tugs before he was coming. Tears leaked from the corners of his eyes as tremors of pleasure radiated from his groin to his fingertips. He squeezed his eyes tightly shut as Harry continued to move inside him — each thrust causing Draco to moan and writhe, so oversensitive already but not wanting this to ever stop.
“Potter,” Malfoy sneered and it felt like Harry’s brain glitched, completely emptying of thoughts.
“I quit,” he said.
it’s undignified,” he sniffed, and then scooted to where he was told. Against the trunk of the oak, Pansy knelt in front of him and pointed her wand at his chest. “Are you sure you’re qualified for this?” he asked.
“Would’ve thought you’d move in next to Ron and Hermione. You three have that weird co-dependent relationship and all.”
He opened and then closed his mouth. “Just making small talk,” he said. “Last time I saw him, he—” He cut himself off, unable to remember whether Parkinson had been at the bar the night of the altercation in the toilets.
?” Naismith’s mouth fell open and his face went brick red in affronted anger. “
Harry lost his balance, tipping forward. He would have fallen over if it wasn’t for Malfoy’s hands grabbing him and keeping him steady — one on his waist and one on his hip. The tension between them crackled like lightning. Through the single thin layer of the mock shirt, Harry could feel Draco’s individual fingers pressing into his skin. His mind went blank, and he felt almost dizzy as he stood up straight.
“What am I— What are
“There isn’t anything to tell.”
Sitting up on his broom, he released it immediately and let it flutter away, trying to keep his eyes on the ground instead of following it from the corner of his eye like he had when he’d trained with his father. As a child, he’d always been desperate to show his father that he was the best.
Her tone was resolute, and a sense of dread mounted in Harry’s chest. He
He finished the whiskey in one large gulp and headed for bed.
At the time all he knew was that one moment he was handing over twelve sickles for a focaccia, and the next, people were screaming and he was lying on the ground in a daze. The spells bounced off the bricks, crackling like fireworks as the ceiling spun above him.
someone.”
“Those particularly? There’s no deadline but shall we say… middle of next week? As a soft deadline.”
Draco gave him a thumbs up and, as soon as he sat back down, turned to Millie (who was pointedly not looking at him) and fawned over her new haircut, despite it being barely an inch shorter than before. He was worried he was laying it on too thick, but she was preening by the end of his short speech likening her to a reborn Aphrodite.
Behind him, he heard Malfoy scoff and leave the room as he took the robes off and allowed the woman to hang them back on the hanger. He fished his wallet out of his gym bag. “So, how much do I owe you?”
“Well,” Granger said brightly as Weasley left. “This is odd.”
Potter handed something to the woman and then backed away around the corner of the workroom door, out of sight. The next thing Draco heard was the distinctive
having a crisis. It wasn’t a sexuality crisis, no matter what Malfoy thought; Harry had comfortably and easily come to terms with his bisexuality many years ago. It was (as it usually was) a

. It was impossible to look at him without noticing his clothes, especially when they were like today’s: burgundy waistcoat and trousers with a white undershirt and a black robe with silver trim that wouldn’t have looked out of place on a runway. Not only were the colours eye-catching, it also fit so well it was
“No,” Harry admitted.
“Hello,” Draco said, a bit awkwardly. He didn’t think he’d ever met this particular house-elf before, but they all looked the same to him.
“You need to get checked out by a Healer,” Potter decided.
“Will do. G’night, sir.”
“My mother,” he said.
“What? An intervention?” Harry asked.
Instead, he let the tension bleed out of his body, sticking his hands into his pockets and resting his hip against the table he stood next to.
Potter’s face hardened. “Shut up, Malfoy.”
“Mmm,” Draco agreed, but he wasn’t looking at the scenery, he was looking at Harry — specifically, looking at Harry’s mouth. He licked his lips when Harry turned his head and before he could ask what he was doing, Draco pushed himself forward and kissed him gently. A heat that had nothing to do with the sun spread from his head to his toes.
“Keep thinking she’s about to fight the Healers to get in here,” Ron muttered. “Dunno why, she’s got loads of grandchildren already.”
, as Mrs. Weasley described it, but Grimmauld Place didn’t feel like the kind of house that could ever be settled.
“He’s good, isn’t he?” the woman answered for Malfoy, grinning at Harry when he turned back to look at her.
“He’s so creepy,” Maggie said with a shudder when she saw Draco looking.
“Toilet,” Draco said.
like there was a reason bigger than all of
?” Draco snapped at him.
The June heatwave had stretched into July and showed no signs of abating. The high noon sun in the sky directly above told him it was too early in the day to apparate to Maggie Malkin’s shop without risking being seen by Muggles who were passing by the alley. Despite his thin t-shirt and shorts, he was sweating lightly by the time he reached the tube station. Seven stops and one change later and he could feel the sweat dripping down the backs of his knees. The hot fresh air actually felt refreshing compared to the dank humidity of the underground.
He scoffed. “My general aura? Sorry, didn’t realise I was having drinks with Professor Trelawney.”
,” he said, pulling the dress form into the centre of the room. The robes swirled through the air, swinging back and forth as the mannequin screeched to a halt by Draco. “There. Are they up to your standards?” he snapped.
“Oh, well, thank you, Theo,” he said, trying to smile rather than scowl as he tucked his wallet back into his pocket.
“So you’ll come?” Harry asked hopefully.
He groaned, tightening his grip on his cock. Every muscle in his body tensed, and he was so, so close. His other hand gripped helplessly — first at the duvet cover, then the headboard, then tangling in his hair and tugging until the orgasm finally hit him like a landslide, knocking all coherent thoughts from his head.
He rolled his eyes. “It won’t be that bad.”
“Surely there was more than that?”
He didn’t want to think. If he let himself
Harry didn’t want to think about the raid ever again, but he took the file with a grunted thanks. Ambrose loitered awkwardly.
Robards blinked. “I don’t understand.”
painted in black.
Grimacing, he pushed it to the side and pulled out a few feet of blank parchment from the drawer under his desk along with his charcoal sticks, trying not to look at the fabulous palette of pigments in every colour under the sun. Potter had specified black, after all.
Today was a rare Friday in which everyone actually came to the pub (if you counted Greg working behind the bar as him being there, which Draco did because the man spent about as much time standing at the end of their table and chatting, as he did actually doing his job).
The baby made an unhappy noise, and she stopped talking for a moment as she rearranged the child so it was lying in her arms. Its head turned towards Draco and it peered at him curiously. He tried not to look unnerved and redirected his gaze to Granger, who was flipping through a book on the couch cushion next to her.
He wasn’t sure what he said was true. His parents would have been shocked, but the root of their surprise would have been the fact Draco was introducing them to a man. Once they got over that… His father would have had a few issues to overcome, but he wouldn’t give Draco any ultimatums. He might actually approve of the match, given Harry’s social standing. He’d probably have regarded him as a means to absolve the Malfoy name.
“Ready?” Harry whispered.
At first, the pain was manageable, like someone running their hand across your sunburnt skin, but it quickly deepened into an intense tickle unlike anything Harry had ever experienced. It felt like his bones were covered in ants and he wanted to
“I’m happy for you, Greg. She looks nice,” he said.
The sun had begun its downward descent, and it now peered through the bedroom window, casting the room in a golden glow. It would set in an hour or two, Draco guessed, and the emptiness in his stomach confirmed the late hour.
“We’ve talked about this already,” Draco said, flicking him gently in the middle of the forehead, trying to jog Harry’s brain back into action. “Maggie’s profited off my enormous talents for long enough and Hogsmeade hasn’t had a proper tailor in centuries…”
His voice was quiet, he didn’t want to disturb the gentle peace in the hospital room. Ron’s eyes were red and puffy like he’d been crying, and Hermione looked absolutely exhausted, but they both smiled at him. Hermione was sitting up in bed, the sheets bunched around her waist and a small bundle of blankets nestled in her arms.
They stood on the doorstep of Harry Potter’s house for a long moment that stretched on for too long. Draco tried to raise his hand to knock, but he felt like he’d been petrified.
He pursed his lips and tilted his head to one side. “I have a few ideas that might work. Taboos are pretty easy to deal with, thankfully, but it’s the summoning thing I’m not sure what to do about… If you two just come and stand here, front and centre.”
“Good book?” Kingsley asked. He knew his way around Grimmauld Place and made his way to the kitchen without Harry suggesting it.
. You’ll be wearing them to every single event for the next year. I don’t care if it’s just a trip to the pub, you better wear them.”
She narrowed her eyes at him. When he didn’t offer up any additional information she prompted, “And it wasn’t up to your very high standards for posh bread?”
“Did you not get the memo?”
Maggie wandered over and leant across Draco’s back, resting her chin on his shoulder and looking at his sketches.
“It’s good to know I’m a positive influence,” Draco sniffed.
Inside the robe, Harry’s hands were getting hot, and he fought to free them from the yards of fabric. It felt like he was trying to find a tent zip in the dark.
“Malfoy — Lucius Malfoy’s son,” Ambrose said casually. “You two know each other, don’t you?”
“Alright,” Draco said dubiously. He spread out the different scraps on the table, trying to fit the puzzle pieces together. “Is this all of it?”
Instead, he said, “I think you’re in the minority there.”
When he finally got back home, it was nearly dawn. He drew the curtains against the tentative grey sky and when he collapsed into bed, he fell asleep almost instantly, his body still feeling as if he were flying.
Mercifully, it only lasted a few seconds, and then the awful feeling subsided, washed away by a cool trickle that started at the crown of his head and dripped down Harry’s body. With his free hand, Draco clutched at his own throat, grimacing.
He groaned and slid his fingers under his glasses, squeezing the bridge of his nose. He’d be fine after a few more hours of sleep.
“We tried, but none of us have anything to talk about and you haven’t told us what’s going on in your life in an age,” Blaise drawled. He was examining one of the fashion magazines with interest.
“I’m not
“Stop it, Granny,” Maggie said as she entered the room with an armful of old stock. She sounded tired, like she’d already worked a full day on a busy shop floor despite the clock only just hitting 9 AM. Her purple hair was braided into several complicated loops on top of her head, and along with her moss-green robes with drooping petal-shaped sleeves, she reminded Draco of a wilting flower.

Malfoy did nothing to assuage his awkwardness. He pointed to a small cubicle set into the wall with a heavy velvet curtain pulled aside. A set of robes hung on a hook.
Saturday, in case you hadn’t realised — I’ve got plans.”
“If you want it to be a thing, I suppose I could go along with that,” Draco drawled, but his tremulous smile possibly gave away his true feelings on the subject.
“Po— Uh, Harry?” Greg asked.
’ which definitely spoilt the mood somewhat. Confused, Draco followed his gaze to the mess of criss-crossing scars that decorated his chest and grimaced.
“Potter’s always been—” Draco said before the unmistakable sound of someone Apparating into the alleyway cut him off. He opened the door before Potter even knocked this time, taking a step out into the street and shoving him hard. Potter stumbled, tripping over his own feet and collapsing back into the wall. “What the actual

“They’re dress robes, they have layers. You should try to stop complaining about them so loudly, you sound like an oaf.”

“Yeah, you did.” He scratched the back of his head and looked around at the graves in apparent confusion.
Three sets of eyes blinked at him.
Maggie gasped and started peppering him with questions about the specifications and the budget (at which she screamed a little with excitement). Draco did his best to answer while clutching onto the mug handle so tightly it felt like it was about to shatter, trying to forget the feeling on Potter’s throat beneath his hands.
“There’s some blood…” He waved his hand at Theo’s collar, which was decorated with specks of red and Theo turned to the mirror over the sink and swore.
Draco resisted the urge to chew on his lip — an old nervous habit from when he was a child that Lucius had mostly forced out of him.
for one.
She scowled and gestured to the files she was carrying under her arm. “I’m not following you, Potter, I’m just going the same way as you.”
Harry laughed. They were nearly at the head of the queue. “Oh, of course, of course,” he placated and then grinned wickedly. “But we all know everything rests on your Seeker, anyway.”
“Because I thought it was what
Harry leant away from from Draco, kicking his toe against the bed leg. “I don’t know,” he said, but then immediately followed up with, “It’s just a bit weird, isn’t it? Me and you. I wasn’t sure how people would react if I told them.”
It had taken Pansy years after the war to find a job. He hadn’t known any of this for the first year; he’d been too preoccupied with his mother, and his friends had been so busy trying to distance themselves from any Death Eater links that they hadn’t spoken except for the condolence letters.
“Good thing they got him,” he said as he shrugged out of his jacket and hung it on the coat stand by the door, his nose wrinkling.
Potter in this. He could see the swirl of the coat-like robe around his ankles as he turned to greet a friend; he could see him tugging at the bow-tie, trying to loosen it, see him fidgeting with the small embroidered details at the cuffs in a fit of boredom as he waited for the interminable speeches to end.
“What style did you decide on in the end?” Pansy asked.
Thankfully, she pulled away a moment later and dug around in her pocket for a tissue. Draco handed her his handkerchief instead.
“More. With your mouth.” It was just a statement, but Harry took it like an order, sucking the tip into his mouth. It was warm and wet and Draco’s hands scrabbled for purchase in his hair, something to clutch onto as he lost himself in how good Potter’s mouth felt.
,” an Auror behind Potter yelled. “Put your hands on your head!
Draco could fill in that awkward silence easily enough: if there was no curse, then there was no relationship. Clearly, Harry thought the curse was the end of their interaction and he had good reason to — it wasn’t as if they had been bosom buddies before that summer. Without Draco’s magic ability to summon him from across the country, why would they ever bump into each other again? They could go back to their occasional awkward meetings every five years, and that would be that.
Malkin’s Magical Tailoring? Where you got your robes fixed that one time?” Ginny asked, immediately connecting the dots — he’d been a fool to think she wouldn’t. Hermione and Ron exchanged a loaded look.

“You can notice what people wear without judging them for it,” he snapped. “Not that you’d understand.”
“See? I told you so. There was never a doubt in my mind that you wouldn’t get it,” he whispered into Harry’s ear.
“Hello, Draco, we’ve heard a lot about you,” Mrs. Malkin said, the brief greeting clearly stretching the limits of her politeness.
“It needs to be protected at all costs.”
Either being polite or noting Harry and Luna surrounded by the enemy, Hermione, Ron and his brother sauntered over. Pansy immediately left Draco’s shoulder to talk to Hermione and the sight of the two of them hugging and smiling at each other was surreal.
“Have you done it before?” he asked as Harry grasped Draco’s thigh, then slid his hand upwards to the wiry, coarse hair at the base of his erection. He groaned, unable to stop his hips from canting up with desire.
“Mother
’, but his tone added it on at the end. “Come on, I need to check the fit.”
Harry punched him lightly in the arm. “I lived with Ron for seven years. That was plenty — he talks in his sleep. But you’re not wrong. I keep thinking maybe I’ll move, eventually.”

“Stop being a git,” she said.

Greg nodded shyly, and Blaise’s mouth dropped open. “
“I’m going to go,” he murmured.
“Fuck. You like that? Do you like me telling you how good you are?” he asked, and Harry groaned again, taking Draco even deeper until his nose brushed against Draco’s pelvis and it took all of Draco’s strength to keep talking when all he could think was
“Do you know why Potter’s here?” she asked.
Draco had transfigured a broken stool into a mannequin on the spot, and that was that.
“I got hit by a spell,” Draco admitted.
“...Don’t know,” he finished lamely.
He moved away, and Harry released the breath he’d been holding. He took a couple of steps back and tilted his head to the side, giving the robes a slow inspection. Harry felt strangely judged yet simultaneously invisible as if he was just a mannequin there to display Malfoy’s work.
Draco regarded him with a bemused expression. “I haven’t hated you in years.”
Hermione clicked her tongue. “Here, take Rose, I need to…”
“Around seven to nine days. What?” he asked in response to Potter’s wince.
“Good, good. Excellent work on Saturday, bringing down Thorne yourself. And then dealing with that surprise hippogriff on Sunday — really fantastic leadership.”
“Keep still,” Pansy snapped as he shivered.
“Tell me what exactly you like about them,” Draco said, crossing his arms.
“Yeah, definitely — it’s just a bit more paperwork.” He grimaced and quickly changed the subject. “What’s the new case like? I haven’t looked at it yet.”
“Well…” Draco said slowly, “I don’t have to go home tonight. There’s no one waiting for me.”
The sun had long since set, but the London sky was never truly dark. It was a risk to mount his broom and kick off for the brief moment that he hung in the murky brown sky, illuminated by the artificial glow of streetlights and car headlamps, but he ducked his head and soared higher, faster. Once he was certain he’d be nothing but a nearly invisible inky speck against the polluted sky, he turned his broom north and flattened himself against the handle, staring ahead straight as if the snitch was in front of him, just out of reach.
Draco grimaced (he couldn’t exactly deny that) as Millie pouted, looking between the three of them. “Will someone stop being cryptic?” she demanded.
“It’s not a love…” Potter trailed off, and they both stared at each other as a horrified realisation sank into Draco’s bones. Potter swallowed. “We need to go see Hermione.”
“Yeah, well, seeing as it’s my business and all, I feel like I should try and be here for opening at least once a week.”
As she talked, Millie reached over and twirled a strand of Draco’s hair around her finger. “You should book an appointment after work sometime this week — your hair’s getting so long.”
convinced. For the good of the department.”
“There are so few yetis left, you know? But the Russian government is saying that I need permission to hunt in Siberia and they won’t listen to me when I tell them I won’t be hunting.”
“Dress robes.”
“Must be,” Belinda said eventually and went to get herself a coffee as they all lost interest.
She shook her head and hurriedly said. “Oh no, it’s fine, don’t worry about it Mr. Potter—”
“She could be the best bloody mediwitch in London” — which she was, but Draco didn’t interrupt — “but I doubt she’s got much training in detecting curses,” Harry said.
“How’s Pansy, Draco?” Hermione said finally.
“Perfect,” Harry agreed, his tone dark.
“Hello,” Draco replied. “What do you need?”
“Gorgeous,” he said, pressing his lips against Harry’s cheek as he cried out wordlessly. He worked his hand up and down his shaft a few times, but it was dry and his wand was lost in the folds of his clothes on the ground, so he stopped. As he raised his palm to his mouth to lick, Harry stopped him, looping his fingers around his wrist and pinning it back against the wall.
“Oh, urm, hold on, I think I have it with me.” He rooted through his pockets, finally pulling out a folded piece of card and brandishing it at Draco triumphantly. “It says
Draco’s wand slipped from his hand, joining the other pair flying through the air towards the doorway. His head snapped around to see who was there.
“I’m going to go talk to him,” he said to Maggie and slid out of his chair. Potter saw him coming and stopped under the shade of the old yew tree, halfway between the gate and the gathered mourners. Under its enormous twisted branches, the air was several degrees cooler and Draco saw Potter shiver and tuck his hands into his armpits.
“This was— It was— It was supposed to be a peace offering,” he spluttered. “I didn’t want you to leave angry.”
“I am,” Harry said weakly.
The Manor welcomed him in its quiet way. He brushed the ash from his shoes before stepping out of the fireplace in the entrance hall. His ears were so acclimatised to the hustle and bustle of London that it took a moment to hear the ticking of a grandfather clock in the parlour and the faint piping call of a wren in one of the bushes outside. Glumly, he looked around the room, his eyes resting on the front door for a moment too long, and a memory of skin and lips and heat invaded his mind.
He’d barely made a dent in Robards’ paperwork as he threw the stack on the desk and reached for his cape, but he was certain this took precedence. His only dress robes were the ones he’d worn to Yule Ball in fourth year. He couldn’t wear those to the War Recovery Ball.
“We do?”
“Cursed?!” Maggie gasped. “Are you okay?”
“Shut up!” His wand twitched away from Draco to Theo for a second. He took a step closer to Draco. “I said
The older man nodded. “I’d like you to be happy, Harry. I don’t think anyone who actually cares for you would begrudge you having some peace at last. Merlin knows you deserve it.”
“You’re an oaf because you think not caring about clothes makes you better than everyone else,” Malfoy said as he grabbed a piece of chalk from a drawer and knelt on the floor to make some marks at the bottom of the cape.
She gasped and clapped her hands together. “You were at Underborough on Saturday morning?”
“It’s still a
Draco hummed noncommittally as he mulled over it. His friends had reacted basically exactly how he’d expected them to: with disbelief, yes, and there was definitely a lot of mocking and teasing, but they were supportive even though it was
“Shh,” he said half-heartedly. He didn’t need to worry: Ron was making enough noise to mask a parade of elephants marching through the living room. “Where did you hear that from?”
“I guess,” she said, sounding unconvinced, but they’d reached the outer edges of the cluster of wizards and she didn’t push the point. “It feels like Granny dressed every single person on Earth,” Maggie said under her breath as they slid through the layers of people.
The fact she’d refrained from asking that for so long had impressed him. Hermione always had a plan, she was always thinking ahead. She’d probably already considered ten different possible career paths for Harry and ordered them according to their suitability.
He sat heavily at his desk, his sigh sounding more like a low moan.
“That’s about the short of it, yeah. There was a bit before when he came up to me while I was pissing and knocked my head into the wall.”
He scratched the back of his neck. “Yeah, sorry, totally slipped my mind — I was thinking about a work thing.”
“Stop, stop,” he begged eventually, pushing Draco away.
The longest of these fits lasted six days.
Harry grimaced.
She slapped his closest body part — which happened to be his ankle. “You’re fine,” she admitted.
“Going?”
A breeze rustled the hem of his gown, and he crossed his arms over his chest. He didn’t dare look down at himself: he was probably completely debauched. Had he even
?” Harry asked, mimicking her wishy-washy hand movement.
His dad had laughed and said, “Narcissa, you’re speaking to a future England seeker. Appearance fees for birthday parties are at least ten Galleons.”
“Uh, maybe because Pansy lives down the road and we get food from there all the time? You know you sound insane, don’t you?
“Potter,” he called, immediately leaving his friends to fend for themselves. He sauntered down the steps to the small group — his eyes fixed only on Harry.
He pulled the cubicle curtain shut behind him and toed his shoes off, quickly shrugging out of his robes and kicking them into a corner until he stood just in his underwear and socks. Uncertainly, he reached for the dress robes and quickly realised he was out of his depth.
“Blaise, don’t be arse,” Millie said, kicking his ankle.
The extended awkward silence must have finally affected Parkinson. “How’s Auror-ing?” she asked.
Theo slapped Draco on the arm, nodded at Potter and then abandoned him. Draco felt mildly betrayed, he always felt more confident facing Potter with back-up.
“Nothing…” she said, even though there clearly was
He kept his movements professional, because that’s what he was. Often during fittings, he had to splay his hand around his customers’ upper thighs to keep the tape measure steady. He needed to run his other hand down the entire length of his leg to smooth the tape measure down in order to ensure an accurate measurement. He often had to do both of these movements twice over when he noticed the tape measure had flipped over and there were no numbers on display.
They’d found some semblance of peace since that fight, their break-up and the freedom from expectations had done wonders for their friendship, but that question wouldn’t let him go.
The dark tiles glittered in the white lights that were unpleasantly bright compared to the dimness of the bar. A man with greasy brown hair had his back to Draco and his wand pointed towards Theo, who was leaning against the wall in the far corner of the bathroom, as stiff as a board with his arms and legs tightly pressed to his side, caged between the wall and a urinal. His eyes flickered wildly towards Draco but otherwise he didn’t move a muscle, constrained by whatever Body-Bind Curse the stranger had used. There was a steady stream of blood trickling from his nose.
He expected Maggie to roll her eyes and relent, but instead, she grimaced and put her knitting needles down.
wanted!” Harry squawked. “And then you literally ran away as soon as the curse was lifted so I couldn’t
“Most of them?”
She wore a blend of Muggle and magical fashion. That morning, her indigo dress was sleeveless and knee-length, cinched in at the waist and then flaring out over her hips. Over the top, she wore a half-cape that fastened at the neck with a row of three small gold buttons. It fell mid-way down her forearms. Both the cape and dress were the same shade of blue as the wide-brimmed witches’ hat that she peered out from underneath.
, he told himself, ordering his nerves to retreat. If there was an easy counter spell that took away the weird feelings he’d been having for Potter, then that would solve a lot of his issues. He could go back to normal: that was what he wanted.
And that was how most days went: he stayed busy enough that his mind never wandered, doing whatever odd job anyone could think of.
,” he begged, the word lengthening in a groan as Harry slowly thrust in. His eyes fell closed, and he dropped his forehead onto his thumbs. His mouth hung open, pressed into a pillow, and he didn’t care enough to stop the saliva that drooled from the corner of his lips.
“Wait, Rolf Scamander? Merlin, I haven’t seen him in
shop! I wish I’d taken a picture to send to Granny. Do you think he’d pose for a photo if I asked when he comes to get his robes?”
? Draco wondered.
deep in his stomach and the world momentarily slid out from under him like an intense head rush when you stand too fast. He gripped the edge of his desk, waiting for the blackness to fade at the edge of his vision.
She stopped talking and handed the baby to Potter, who looked perfectly at ease holding the infant. It had a new vantage point lying on his chest to stare at Draco with its wide eyes from even closer. Draco tried not to get competitive about the staring competition as Hermione paced up and down the bookshelves.
Draco didn’t know whether to be grateful or humiliated. The bathroom incident had been weeks ago, and there had been many opportunities for Theo to pay him back that had passed without a mention. It was bad enough that his friends
gesture.
“You stood still during the fittings, mostly,” Draco said. The words started off in a gracious, magnanimous tone, but as he spoke, the memory of snogging Harry Potter in the corner of the shop rose unbidden to the forefront of his mind, and he choked on spit, blushing. Harry gave him a loaded look.
“Isn’t this what your lot wanted? Inter-species cooperation and all that?” Pansy sneered.
“Who was it?”
“Are we posing or something?” Theo asked when the silence stretched into the next minute.
Maggie sighed. “That’s a shame.”
“Uh, yeah. Sorry about that.”
For the first time, Draco registered that Potter wasn’t even wearing his Auror robes, just a pair of denim Muggle trousers and a vermilion chunky-knit jumper (which was, objectively, hideous). There was something about the way he held himself with unquestionable authority that had made Draco assume he was working.
He stared at his shoes, his saliva still flooding his mouth threateningly. They were old trainers he’d left at Ron and Hermione’s after helping them pull out the monstrous weeds from their neglected garden when they’d first moved in. They were falling apart and covered in dried mud, but they’d been his only pair at the Little House. From the corner of his eye, he could see Draco’s shiny black dress shoes. Harry was sure if he leant over them, he would see his own face reflected in the leather.
“Lead the way,” Draco said.
Are you talking about?”
“Amazing. Thank you so much — I’m sure you’re busy.”
“Alicia,” Ginny answered. “She’s trying out too. You’d think there would be other players in

thing these robes need is more personality,” Draco said, wrinkling his nose. As Maggie left, the self-stitching needle began to roll across the table towards the scraps of Potter’s robes. “Don’t even think about it or you’re going in the drawer,” he warned before putting his head down and getting to work.
What did he do now?
It had definitely been sunny — but not the sun of a clammy London summer, more like the biting chill of a cloudless winter day. A fuzzy not-quite-memory surfaced: Harry walking down through the Entrance Hall of Hogwarts, dressed in fur-lined robes.
“Bully for you,” Maggie said, the congratulations laced with sarcasm.
“We have customers,” Maggie said defensively.
He sighed. “He hasn’t even changed that much, still the same old git I hated in school, so I don’t understand why I can’t stop thinking about him. I’m pining like a lovesick schoolgirl, it’s entirely mortifying.”
The entire world was one long grey blur from now until the end.
“You know, most other people would be happy that their employees are putting in overtime.”
crisis.
She leaned forward eagerly, peering at Harry eagerly “When Draco said your name?” she asked.
He waited until the Muggle’s back was turned and then opened it a crack and darted in.
Reluctantly, Draco met Harry’s gaze. His cheeks were flushed pink. He looked like he’d rather be anywhere else in the world, but Harry’s heartbeat still picked up. He’d missed him more than he’d realised.
“Go to the other room,” he ordered as the person knocked again. Millie leaned the broom against the wall and left, glancing nervously at the shadow on the other side of the door.
The man put away his quill and parchment, tucking it into an inside pocket. His hand lingered on the lapels of his robes, then drifted to the wand holster at his waist. His fingertips rested on the handle as he stared Draco down.
“Cheers,” the others chorused.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes suspiciously. “Why are you asking?”
Like a crush.
The initial plan had been to go to a restaurant, but payday wasn’t until next Friday and Draco’s wallet was unpleasantly light so he had suggested an intimate dinner party instead. It went without saying that it wouldn’t be at the Manor, so Blaise had stepped up and offered his (though, really, his mother’s) townhouse.
“If McLaggen is the best Keeper in England, I’m not betting on you, even with Leprechaun gold.”
Harry saw himself wearing his two hundred Galleon robes in the back garden of Grimmauld Place next to Luna in her turnip earrings and Arthur Weasley, who’d recently discovered Hawaiian shirts. Ron and George suddenly appeared in this imagined scene — dressed normally in jeans and shirts — falling over each other in hysterics. He winced.
Draco’s head tilted down an inch, so he was looking at Harry square-on rather than down the arch of his nose. The air of invincibility dissolved as quickly as it had appeared.
As if reading his thoughts, she looked over at him, her eyes just as piercing as ever as they flickered from his face to his arm around Harry’s waist. The last decade of adulthood dribbled from Draco’s spine and he was eleven again, standing in the Transfiguration classroom, being soundly told off for misbehaving. He kept his hand on Harry’s hip defiantly.
He Apparated with a single-minded purpose.
“Weaponised incompetence?” Harry suggested.
It didn’t take Maggie long to proclaim, “I don’t understand why it’s so difficult for her to understand that I don’t
“Sure,” he grunted, hoisting himself to his feet. “How do you like it?”
“True,” Draco agreed.
“Are you
She stomped into the sewing room and started to aggressively tidy, clearing away the barely touched cups of tea with a wave of her wand before turning her attention on the pile of robes she’d brought in from the shop floor. Her eyes were red-rimmed and clashed with her outfit.
“Milk, no sugar. Thank you,” Draco said and walked over to the free arm chair.
He meant it sincerely, though the compliment’s authenticity was lessened slightly when it came from Draco, given that she was wearing a dress he had made for her. It was floor-length, but made out of a light cotton that wasn’t too hot in the London summer. She wore it over a long-sleeved blouse made of a white, gauzy fabric. She hadn’t bothered to straighten her hair into her usual severe bob, and the short strands curled softly around her temples, just brushing the bottom of her earlobes.
he signed off. He tied it to the leg of his eagle owl and opened the kitchen window for it to fly away, hoping that they wouldn’t reply with an invitation to see them. He couldn’t handle speaking to anyone else at that moment.
“Robards mentioned it in the debrief,” Ambrose said. “Just our team, though — don’t worry, we’ll keep it quiet until there’s an official announcement.”
in years. It didn’t look like much had changed from school: Weasley was sitting in the shade, his back resting against Granger’s legs as she sat with her nose in a book, one hand curled around her stomach. Potter was splayed out in the sun, like a lizard basking, his face tilted up towards the blue sky. He was tossing a ball in the air and catching it with his eyes closed.
hopeless,” he protested, but then sheepishly added, “Although your mum might have dropped a few reminders here and there — mentioning the name of a florist, that kind of thing.”
“What happened?”
“I ran into him, yes,” he said, turning away from Maggie to look over his current project, a simple alteration of some ugly dress robes. (He shouldn’t complain: any business was good business.)
Maggie perked up. “Dress robes? Did he buy any?”
“Oh, right! Shit. Yeah, here you go.” He tossed their wands back and Draco immediately pocketed his, trying not to outwardly show how relieved he was to have it back in his hand.
chicken shop? The market when we were arresting Thorne? It’s too often to be a coincidence, don’t you see?”
“Sir?”
“Minister,” he said, trying not to let his disappointment show.
“I don’t know. I’ve lost track of time,” Harry said with a sheepish smile.
“We’re putting our best on it — when our best gets back from maternity leave, that is.”
Ron’s cooking.
George Weasley, who was sitting a few seats down from Theo on Draco’s side of the table, leaned over and asked sympathetically, “Did you fall in, Malfoy? No need to be embarrassed, happens to the best of us. I mean, Larry over there

how he got a front row seat to watch the countless ways Draco’s life collapsed around him.
The sun’s heat still clung to the pavement, the black tarmac radiating warmth as they walked the short walk back to Pansy’s house. The air was still: the wind wasn’t strong enough to bother winding its way through the maze of residential streets, and Draco longed for a countryside breeze to dry the sweat that caused his clothes to chafe across his skin.
“I was just saying that I’ve got an interview for that job with Mummy’s friend, you know, the one who needed a personal assistant, and you
“So good,” he praised as Harry sucked him deeper. “So good for me.”
The bar’s unique selling point was its strange interior design; it had an odd assortment of all sorts of furniture that was intended to look like a Muggle living room, according to Greg. Turns out Muggles have awful taste: everything was yellow or brown, and there was so much
“From
If Ron and Hermione were ever unhappy to see him, they didn’t let it show. Every time he appeared in their fireplace, kicking ash from his shoes, they greeted him with smiles and handed him some kind of activity for the day: a trowel, a baby, a broomstick, a frying pan; and he would get to work.
. Escorted me to a Healer and everything.”
“You’re a star, but I think I’m done for the evening,” Millie said.
. She’s completely out of your league. How did you manage that?”
This feeling was different, though. It wasn’t the urgent desire to go find Draco right that moment that he was used to. After all, as much as he wanted to see Draco and tell him about what had happened, he knew Draco hated his guts. He’d been pretty clear last night during the raid that he’d be happy to never see Harry’s face again. His anger had been understandable. After all, Harry knew during the raid that Draco wanted him to die on the spot and yet he’d still gone back
“Oh!” Maggie looked down and read, “Um. The name of the popular ‘Singer Sorceress’, nine-seven.”
He tore the envelope open and read,

She pulled a face but before she could lie and say she had full confidence in Harry’s sanity, Luna and Neville tumbled out the fire, followed immediately by Ron and Hermione. Each of them had at least one bottle of alcohol except for Hermione, who was holding a thermos.
think?”
“Coward,” he repeated under his breath, vindicated as his mouth flooded with a sour flavour.
If he closed his eyes, he could already see the stack of files building up on his desk: new cases, old cases, ongoing cases… His office threshold would be covered in memos and reminders and requests for meetings, accumulating like layers of snow. It never ended. Of course, it was always fine once he got there and started going through it but until then, the dread would ruin his rest days.
“What does it matter to you? Are you going to conduct a full Auror investigation because I’m up past my bedtime?” Draco asked snarkily, trying to pull his hands away to no avail. “You should let me go, Potter, lest a house-elf catches sight of this and thinks you’re
“We’re not saying we don’t believe you, Harry,” Hermione said.
“Holy motherfucker,” Pansy swore, her mouth dropping open. Draco watched her eyes dart down to the robes on the workbench and then back up. Blaise followed, staring at Potter’s robes for a moment longer before it clicked. His eyes widened and then he started laughing maniacally. Pansy joined in a moment later, the two of them falling over each other as they cackled.
“She buys into all that Chosen One shit,” he said, rolling his eyes. “She was already dealing with her life’s work being smashed to bits. I didn’t think it was the right time to break the news to her that her idol is actually a total twat.”
selling points, she was also a self-proclaimed Harry Potter fangirl. She’d never met him, or even been in the same room as him — Maggie had started Hogwarts the year after the battle — but that was probably why she was in love with him. Draco suspected it was much easier to find Potter bearable if you only read about his exploits in the weekly gossip rags, than if you’d had the misfortune of having a conversation with him. But, while he understood that Potter fans were inevitable with the

just drink without me,” he said.
“What was that for?” Harry demanded.
He inspected his reflection and decided he was a lost cause. He considered sacking the whole thing off and trying again tomorrow. But he knew he wouldn’t do that. Hopelessly, he combed his fingers through his hair, ruled it was the best it was going to get, and straightened his back before walking the last few metres.
“You’re still not over him getting a higher mark than you in it, are you?” Ron teased.
“This is Auror Potter. I need a MLEP officer at the men’s bathroom of Bobby Simmonds bar in Soho. The situation is under control: one male is under arrest,” he said to the stag, who then jumped through the wall and disappeared.
,” Draco said.
“Are you alright?” Draco asked.
?” Ron said.
“Celestina Warbeck,” they both answered in unison.
People mingled on every level, talking and laughing. Most of them Draco hadn’t seen since Hogwarts: Alicia Spinnet was jogging around the lawn with a small blue-haired boy on a broomstick, cheering him on; there were a group of Weasleys of various ages spectating as Longbottom and Lee Jordan played an intense game of liar’s dice; Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnegan leant against the upper balcony railing, looking at Draco’s group in dumbfounded horror. Arthur Weasley was wearing a flamingo and palm tree patterned shirt that could only be described as a crime against fashion. He stood in front of some sort of Muggle outdoor stove that was belching flames, waving a spatula above his head gleefully. Bill Weasley was sitting on the picnic bench with a small ginger girl on his lap, watching his father with obvious concern. He smiled and raised a hand at Draco when he saw them.
The windows had been repaired, and the racks of Muggle clothes were stocked once again. He peered through the window and couldn’t see anyone in the Muggle front, so he ducked around to the hidden side door. The bell tinkled cheerfully above his head when he pulled it open.
“I love it,” Rolf said with a big grin. “No idea what I’d be doing if I couldn’t be a magizoologist — I couldn’t work behind a desk in an office, I’d go mad.”
He tried again, saying, “Sir, I’d like to contribute to that case. It sounds” —
It had been so soon after the war. He’d been shocked to read the announcement in the papers — a tiny box in the obituaries that he would have missed entirely if it hadn’t been directly under Dedalus Diggle’s. It hadn’t given her occupation or her accomplishments, just two brief sentences:
The garden.
Draco crossed his arms, keeping his wand clutched tightly in his fist. “Need I point out that
“Or a Healer,” Draco said.
“Your caring attitude really fills me with confidence in our healthcare system.”
“Shouldn’t that make you happy? You’ve been worrying about not having enough customers.” She tucked into her wings, the chicken leaving a bronzed greasy residue on her fingertips.
“Um, yeah, it’s alright,” Harry said vaguely as he followed the blue-robed man down the narrow corridors and wracked his brains for the name of the last book he’d read. Thankfully, Kingsley didn’t ask.
“It’s a miracle you have a single OWL,” Draco said, shaking his head in disbelief.
Harry frowned. “You don’t have to forgive me — I was an arse. But I wanted to say sorry.”
The thought of Kingsley leaving Harry alone in the settling house filled him with dread. He didn’t want to tackle the enormous task of finding something to fill the rest of the day with. If he was left alone with his thoughts, there really was only one place (one person) they would go to, and Harry didn’t want to think about him.
Draco opened his mouth to snap that he didn’t realise being guided by a greater purpose was a requirement of being a groundskeeper, but Harry put a hand on the small of his back, cutting him off. Harry’s ribs expanded beneath Draco’s palm as he took a deep breath.
Just as he reached the door he remembered Robards’ instruction to pretend he wasn’t seething, and he tried to wrestle the scowl from his lips. He thought he did a decent job of it until Belinda asked if he’d also got a dodgy tummy from the tuna sandwiches.
“Uh-huh.” He sighed deeply and got a quill and parchment from his pocket. “So, what are your individual relationships with this shop?”
“Dunno, fighting? They were pointing sticks at each other and shouting when I was washing my hands.”
“Okay,” he said, looking back at his old adversary. “I’m not sure if you’re aware of how

Draco snapped his head back down and opened his eyes. Harry tried to appear innocent.
Harry shrugged. “Don’t hold your breath,” he said and Apparated.
“It’s Potter, Millie,” Draco admitted, wincing.

it off with a glare after tossing it towards the bin.
In order for him to pass them in the narrow corridor, Draco had to press back up against Harry and Ron made a noise like he’d just bitten into a vomit-flavoured Bertie Bott’s bean.
Ron pulled his head from the fire and ran his hands through his hair, dislodging bits of kindling. He froze for a moment as he took in Draco holding his daughter.
On the sixth day, Ron Flooed down to London to ‘drop off a quiche’ (though clearly the real reason was to check up on Harry) and found him having a nap on the couch at four o’clock in the afternoon, shirtless because he’d run out of clean tops. He convinced Harry to take a shower and pop over to the Little House, claiming Rose missed him — even though Rose wasn’t capable of an intelligible thought.
With a warm smile, he said, “Hello gentlemen, I hear we have a love curse!”
“You wanted to ‘talk about it’,” he said. “
“I’m not having a breakdown,” Potter said, glaring at Draco as if he’d called Harry a mudblood. “It’s just…
Draco Levitated the box onto the counter and pulled out a few bits and bobs from the top layer: throwing away old receipts and fashion magazines, trying to determine whether he could salvage the scraps of fabric for other projects. It was tedious work, but when the only other option was working on Potter’s robes, it appeared a lot more attractive.
“Right. Sure. I’ll wait outside.” He slunk out, leaving Draco with Theo.
Maybe he should just bin them, like all his attempts at writing to Harry.
“So, Luna, where are you off to?” Blaise said with one of his charming smiles, as if he hadn’t once spent a whole evening in Fifth Year hiding a pair of Looney Lovegood’s shoes to get back into Millie’s good books after one of their break-ups.
While he was waiting for the water to boil, he leaned against the counter and picked up an old copy of the
Afterwards, he regretted not owling her to let her know he wouldn’t make it, but he never regretted going. As Ginny yelled at him, all he could think of was trudging down the artfully placed stepping stones through the rain to the Malfoy cemetery (because
“There are probably specific standards for Auror robes that I don’t know,” he said through gritted teeth.
He needed to leave.
She grinned wolfishly. “Hold your horses, Potter’s joining.”
Harry pondered this. He wasn’t sure he’d describe what he’d seen at the bathroom as a
“Sure thing. Can I wear my Gryffindor socks?”
“Okay. Are—” She cut herself off, pursing her lips as she gave Harry a once-over. “Are you okay, Mr. Potter?”
“If you refuse to come out, we’re going to drink
Greg wandered over from the bar, a blue and white tea towel splattered with beer stains thrown over his shoulder.
He woke at 6 AM with a pounding headache and a dry mouth. Stumbling up from the couch, he stepped over Neville’s starfished legs and avoided the creaky stairs as he descended to the kitchen. Hermione was awake already and standing at the hob, looking unfairly perky as she chatted with Kreacher about the best ways to scramble eggs. She’d somehow pestered the house-elf into sitting at the kitchen table. His big eyes only just peered up above the table, but he looked very comfortable. Harry idly wondered whether he should buy him a booster seat or if it would be some kind of mortal insult that would cause one of Kreacher’s month-long silences.
He snapped his mouth shut. “Right. Yeah. Sorry.”
Harry shrugged, not feeling particularly guilty: it wasn’t as if the shop was swamped with customers. In fact, it was completely empty, as it had been every time Harry had visited.
At school, Draco had found Granger’s constant know-it-all routine to be entirely insufferable, but for the first time, he was actually quite grateful for her existence.
?!” Theo said, his blood staining the white fabric crimson. “Pretty sure I’d remember
“Merlin, Pot—” He caught himself at the last second, his teeth clacking together as he slammed his mouth shut. “
“No one?” Draco asked.
Was Potter even gay? If he was, he wasn’t public about it. That was the sort of revelation that would have made headlines in the
“I’m not going through a break-up. I’m fine,” Draco said again as panic gripped him at the thought of going back to the Manor, with nothing to do but stew in his own thoughts. At least here he had Maggie and work to distract him.
Harry turned to her and frowned. “What?” he asked.
Harry shook his head. “Nah, come on in.”
“Did anything out of the ordinary happen?” Hermione asked.
Blaise added, “It was weird, I was talking to Greg when the Muggle came up and I swear the guy hadn’t even begun explaining what was going on before Potter was marching over to the bathrooms like a man possessed.”
“What’s happening?” Pansy whispered.
“Like a
“Yes, it doesn’t strike me as your choice of decor,” he said, turning away from it and surveying the musty sitting room. “Most of this doesn’t, in fact. It’s a bit…” He searched for an appropriate adjective. “Drab.”
“Five-thirty, we need to make sure there aren’t any Muggles in the shop when we hit it.”
“You’ve been so tense and broody lately.”
Robards sighed. “Which is why the rest of your team is
The breeze wrapped around his shoulders. Its strength was weakening — the heat of the sun winning once again — but in its dying breaths, it swirled around him, enveloping him in a hug.

Draco winced as a tear finally dropped from Maggie’s lower lashes, running down her cheek before she turned and fled through the Muggle entrance, slamming the door behind her. A moment later, the angry Muggle buzzer announced her exit from the building entirely.
“Next to the kitchen,” Harry said. “Go back the way you came in, and then on your left.”
“Yeah,” he admitted.
“If me quitting was just about making a statement, sure, maybe you could talk me round. But making a protest like this isn’t my
, and yet Pansy had still spent three years bouncing from unemployed to temporary job and back.
“Mr. Naismith, I’ll be taking you into custody for using magic in front of a Muggle.”
“I’m possibly a bigger idiot than I realised,” he said meekly.
“Enough for me. I can’t look at it any more without going mad. Can I borrow your owl?” he asked and then went to the owl’s perch before waiting for her to respond. It squawked indignantly at being woken up from its nap but let Draco fasten the letter to its leg before he let it out of the door into the alley. He hoped it disappeared from view across the rooftops before any Muggle saw.
“Oh my God, you’re Harry Potter! Please, whatever you want — it’s on the house.”
His heart was racing — not an aftereffect of the kiss but from the horror that could have happened if the doors between the two rooms had been open and the woman had seen them and recognised Harry.
He checked his watch: it was nearly noon. Pansy was going to crucify him.
Harry stared at her gormlessly as the house-elf grumbled something and he jumped from the chair. He disappeared with a crack, having given up with stairs.
? Draco appeared perfectly relaxed, as if picnicking by the lake was a completely normal activity. Maybe it was. Harry slumped into a similar position to Draco, mostly laying down with his head propped up on one hand.
“We’ll talk about it more in the morning,” Harry said, kissing him again, still soft, but he lingered for longer. Draco could feel the eyes on them and the titters that spread through the nearby groups. Wizards really were the most insatiable gossips and, while Draco usually loved it, he didn’t want this moment to be shared with half of the richest wizards and witches in the country.
“I miss you,” Harry tried again. “I know we were only seeing because of the curse but, I dunno.” He scratched at a mole on the back of his hand self-consciously. “I liked spending time with you. I know you wanted everything to go back to normal but” — he shrugged — “does it
“Oh no,” Draco said with obvious trepidation.
“Arse,” Pansy muttered in the sudden stillness. “Honestly, where does he get off?”
“She’ll be gone for a while. I’ll let her know to owl you when she has a free moment,” Draco said and then, because Madam Malkin still wasn’t following the hint, he bluntly added, “I’m afraid I have a lot of work to do, like Maggie mentioned, we have a high-profile client alongside our normal work so I’ll have to ask you to leave.”
, Malfoy? Ring any bells?” he snarled, his voice matching Draco’s in volume. A small, cautious part of Draco’s mind cautioned him that someone might hear them and call the Muggle authorities, but he was too angry to back down.
It was a strange twist of fate that the Slytherins’ favourite place to meet nowadays was Muggle establishments.
He was on his feet, Apparating before she could say a word.
“It’s not the reason I didn’t come, though. I got minorly cursed. Nothing to worry about — nothing like what it could have been. It was just a minor inconvenience that resulted in a whole lot of Harry Potter and it’s sorted out now. I’m back to normal, good as new. I— it’s so stupid— I don’t even know why I’m saying this out loud, it’s not like you can hear me but… Oh, Mum, it’s ridiculous. I like him.”
“Rolf thinks one’s escaped,” she said with a calm smile, the glittery radishes bobbing as she tilted her head.
Harry slowly put the cake away and washed the plates. Kreacher would probably snipe at him for not doing a proper job but Harry felt bad leaving things for the house-elf to do considering he was getting so old that he struggled climbing stairs. He’d noticed that even though he still berated Harry for his subpar cleaning, he didn’t bother to redo it like he used to.
“MLEP tend not to come so quickly when it’s not
Draco let his eyes obviously wander down Harry’s body, noting the way the waistcoat nipped in around his slender waist, and shrugged nonchalantly. “I suppose there are worse models out there.”
Millie pounced. “What’s the story behind
“It is,” he said, looking down the long sofa at her with a tired smile. “You’re probably the one of the few who won’t think I’ve lost my mind.”
It felt like…
Harry paced the length of his office. From the open desks on the other side of the door, he could hear murmured conversations. No one had tried to speak to him since he returned (for the second time) and stormed past everyone without a word, slamming the door behind him. They could probably see his restless silhouette in the fogged glass and were no doubt gossiping about his foul mood.
