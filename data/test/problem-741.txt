“Why? I mean, you could be doing anything. You’re quite rich, from what I understand. You could be traveling the world, seeing the best museums, eating at the finest restaurants, staying in the swankiest hotels, but you’d… what, rather hang around with a bunch of kids that aren’t even your responsibility? Why?”
Draco let out a small, pleased noise and slid one of his hands up into the mess of Harry’s hair, pulling him closer still. They kissed leisurely for several long moments before Draco pulled back slightly and gave him a half smile. “Feeling better?”
“Excuse me,” Dermot growled, pushing past her toward the classroom door, smearing paint and glitter down her arm, “I’m going to go wash up.”
Draco bit back a smile. “You may be a bit biased about my attractions, Mother. But as it so happens, I do not lack for companionship back home. I simply haven’t found anyone I’m inclined to build something more serious with.” His tone turned wry. “And even if I had, I hardly think they would be traveling to Scotland just to attend a cocktail party. So it’s still irrelevant.”
“I want to,” he said firmly, “but… not just yet, alright? I need to sort out this shit with my parents and the Greengrasses. Besides,” he smirked, voice going teasing, beginning to move again, skimming his fingers lightly down Harry’s back, “announcing our star-crossed love affair the day after after you started a brawl between our teams doesn’t feel particularly auspicious.”
“Stop throwing aspersions at my mother; I’ve told you before and I’ll tell you again, it’s not her fault that accidents tend to happen around her.”
“Good morning, Mister Potter, Sir,” came the squeaky response. “Is you wanting your breakfast now? We has been keeping it warm for you.” There was the slightest tone of reproach in her voice, and Harry found himself oddly charmed by the elf’s obvious disapproval of his sleeping habits.
Sadiyah looked over at him. “I don’t mean this in a rude way, but you’re surprisingly well adjusted for the sort of childhood you had.”
Malfoy doesn’t mind when I’m not okay, because he’s not okay, either, and neither of us want the other to try to fix it. I think sometimes we just need to let the broken parts be broken for a while, instead of assuming we should be happy and well adjusted and whatever all the time. Life isn’t like that.
“In a bit.” Harry wasn’t entirely sure if he wanted to subject himself to the icy water just yet, and anyway, he knew that Draco wouldn’t be getting in voluntarily.
Harry’s stomach plummeted, his pleasant ‘television face’ dropping for a moment before he caught himself and pasted his smile back on, hoping it wasn’t obvious how forced it was. His fight with Draco was still fresh, and the reminder of the unexpectedly nice time they’d had the day before was like poking a bruise. “Uh, yeah, it was… it was really good, actually. It was kind of him to do.”
A few years after Hogwarts, Harry had been talked into training for a marathon by Dean Thomas, who had gotten very into running after the war. Although Harry hadn’t ended up making a lifestyle of it, he had found completing the marathon to be a heady experience, and he still ran frequently, finding it—like many physical activities—to be a helpful escape when he needed to shut his brain down for a while.
The door swung open onto a cozy room with horizontally paneled wooden walls in a warm, caramel tone; thick carpets; a large, squashy looking sofa; and a small, square dinner table already set for two. In front of the sofa, there was a fire crackling merrily in a brick fireplace. The only other feature was a door that presumably led to the bedroom. Harry supposed the bathroom must be connected.
Finally, Draco couldn’t take any more. “Potter, if you don’t get out of your fucking clothes and inside of me in the next ten seconds, I will not be held responsible for whatever happens next.”
Draco, apparently having noticed the path of Harry’s gaze, had frozen in place as though he knew they were on a precipice and was afraid that one wrong move would end in disaster. At the question, though, he gave a minute, almost imperceptible nod. Hesitantly, Harry stepped in closer, bringing one hand up to cup Draco’s jaw. Slowly, he leaned up, giving Draco plenty of time to pull away. He didn’t. Instead, as the distance between them closed, his breath hitched and his eyes fell shut.
Draco sighs and looks around them. “I did, at that.” He lets out a disbelieving laugh. “Merlin. Alright. Let’s go back to your flat, and then tomorrow we can start looking for someplace new.”
“Of course she has.” Pansy shook her head before brushing the dirt from her backside and hands. “Shall we, then?”
“I’m going to kiss you. And you’re going to see whether it feels right to you, or whether... whatever else is on your mind means it doesn’t. Unless you don’t want me to, in which case, I think we already have your answer.”
“Oh, it can,” she assured him, although she looked as much amused as embarrassed. “Are you sure you want to see?”
“So, if you’re telling us, I assume that means you’ve decided you’re ready to make it public?” Hermione asked matter-of-factly.
fame-seeking than anyone else who’s been interested in dating me.” He studied his cuticles, trying to bite back tears.
Rather than respond verbally, Harry waved his wand wordlessly, stroking the inside of one of Draco’s thighs soothingly and holding out his other hand, into which a bottle of lube shortly flew. A few seconds later, a wet finger was tracing around his rim teasingly. “Tell me what you like,” Harry directed.
“Okay,” Draco told him, continuing to stroke his hair gently. “That’s fair. I can work with that.” He blinked, a few rogue tears trailing down his cheeks despite his best efforts at holding them back.
“Okay.” He smiled, enjoying the warmth of Draco’s palms through the thin fabric of his shirt and circling his own thumbs against the soft skin along Draco’s neck and below his ears. Then, a thought came to him. “Although… now that I won’t be playing the rest of the season, we could maybe talk about, you know. Telling people? About us. If you wanted.” Draco’s hands paused and he bit his lip, looking conflicted. Before disappointment could overtake Harry again, however—
Several people nearby looked over curiously, and Draco lowered his voice to a hiss. “You hooked up with Harry-fucking-Potter? First of all, isn’t he straight? And secondly,
much for taking her on such short notice,” she apologized before noticing Draco sitting next to him. “Oh! Hello, Draco. Oh no, did you two have plans?” She looked distressed. “Harry, you should have said!”
He smiled, but it had a bitter edge to it, and suddenly Harry understood just how hard this conversation had been for him. “I’m so sorry, Perry,” he said. “I wasn’t trying to lead you on or anything, I hope you know that. I’m just…”
, more panicked whispering, and then Draco was walking toward Harry again, his form melting into visibility as he approached. His face was doing something extremely complicated when he reached Harry; an odd mix of frustration and worry and something like pity that made Harry’s stomach drop. Without fanfare, he told Harry, “Jack’s gone.”
“Yeah.” Harry thought back hazily to his time with Perry. “Yeah, it was good at first. I got to know Perry a bit better. He seems really great.” Remembering their conversation cheered him a little. The day hadn’t been all bad, he supposed.
for your twenty-seven-year-old son, who has been neither obligated nor willing to take orders from you for almost a decade, without even consulting him.”
He could hear conversations happening around him as his companions wandered, opening drawers, pulling books from shelves, and taking art from the walls to look at the backs of the frames. Every so often, someone would shout in excitement as they found something that looked promising. Trying to shake off his discomfiture, Harry began searching as well, discovering a packet of Scrabble tiles inside the pot of a fake fern, followed by a pair of red-lensed glasses that he thought might be needed somewhere down the line.
Draco rolled his eyes. “There’s a difference between finding a date and finding the right person. I’m not going to settle down just for the sake of settling down.”
, and no one had died, and he was almost high on the rush of it. “I’m not sure who those count for,” he said, half laughing. “It happened too fast. Did you catch who took them down?”
“Fuck off,” Draco muttered into his shoulder. Harry could feel his smile against his skin. He kissed a line up Harry’s neck and then rolled off of him with an unpleasant squelching noise. “Eugh, okay, yes, that’s disgusting.”
Ron had been completely fascinated, watching in awe as Harry showed him how it worked and the different sorts of programmes that were available. When he’d asked Harry to show his dad, Harry had not only agreed, but decided to invite the whole family over. Arthur had been, predictably, completely enthralled—but it was, in the end, the twins that got Harry into trouble.
Harry rolled his eyes, but he was grinning as he climbed into his jeans. “There. Am I modest enough for you now?” He turned and spread his arms out, presenting himself for inspection.
“What are you smiling at?” Blaise asked, peering at him with interest. “You look as though you’re plotting.”
Harry laughed sheepishly, scrubbing his hand through his hair. “Yeah.” He looked down at his watch and saw that it was approaching one. “We’re supposed to head back soon, anyway. Might as well head for the doors.”
Christ. He was beginning to sober up a bit, and the numbness that came with being several whiskys deep was fading, giving way to a sharper pain than he’d expected. He gingerly traced a scrape across his cheek with a fingertip, vaguely remembering the glint of a ring on a huge, meaty fist as it flew at his face, and winced. He might have gotten a bit overambitious in his choice of opponent tonight. Still, he’d had worse.
They lapsed into silence, and as Draco rubbed a hand soothingly up and down his back, Harry, horrifyingly, could feel his eyes beginning to burn. He tried to blink back the tears before they could fall, but knew he’d been unsuccessful when Draco made a
Draco’s hands were just skimming over Harry’s hips and down to his arse when he felt something vibrate under his fingers. He broke the kiss, startled, and Harry let out a groan that sounded less like pleasure and more like frustration. “Fuck. That’s my mobile.”
Maybe that’s why I started hanging out with Malfoy. Two major benefits: it pisses people off, and he doesn’t expect anything from me. We mostly just drink and lie around on the carpet listening to music. Sometimes we snark at each other, just for old time’s sake. But overall, it’s weirdly pleasant.
Eventually, despite numerous setbacks, they made it to the trail. Harry hadn’t been particularly attracted to the idea of hiking, considering that most of the time he’d spent in woods in his youth he’d been running for his life, but he had to admit that it was beautiful once they got going.
He returned to the warm bed as quickly as possible, shivering from the cold of the floors on his bare feet, and Harry immediately curled into him despite seeming to have fallen back asleep. Draco allowed the comforting warmth of him to pull him back under.
he admonished, glancing down at Teddy, who was happily chatting away with the man manning the booth, who thankfully appeared not to have heard his commentary on the quality of the carvings. Then, “Thank you.”
“I can’t argue with that,” Harry sighed. “Let’s head out.” He lowered his voice, leaning closer. “I could really use a drying charm right about now.”
when they announced the search for contestants, and I thought we might hit it off. And if not, at least it was a break from work.” Harry let out a startled bark of laughter, and Nathalie winked at him. He was about to reply when he felt a hand on his bicep and turned to face the newcomer.
“God, seriously. I’m probably one of the only kids who ever saw that as a selling point.” Harry went on to tell her a bit about discussions he and Hermione had had around her own experiences versus his, which segued into their thoughts on Muggleborn integration programs in general, and so forth until he could barely remember where the conversation had started.
Harry looked up at the steepest hill apprehensively, watching a few intrepid sledders positively fly down the slope. “I don’t know, Teds, I think maybe we should stick with this one. That was already really fast, yeah?”
“So, speaking of going back to New York,” Harry said quite a bit later as they sat at his kitchen table sipping tea, as though there hadn’t been a significant chunk of time and several orgasms since he’d last mentioned it, “when is that happening, exactly?”
In the morning, after breakfast, they hugged each other goodbye and promised to get in touch once the show had wrapped and things had calmed down.
Oliver watched him in confusion, and Harry had no idea what his face was doing, but it couldn’t have been good. “Draco... Malfoy?”
old!” Teddy insisted with a mischievous grin that turned into hysterical laughter as Harry grabbed him around the middle and started tickling him. “
He thought of Harry in his workshop, carving this frame for him, knowing how important this moment had been to Draco and wanting to give him a way to keep it with him. Then his thoughts drifted, and he thought of Harry lifting Teddy to help him decorate the tree; of Harry laughing and talking with Teddy as he took him to do all of the things he’d never gotten to do himself as a child. And then—then, he thought of Harry warm and sleep-tousled and smiling. He thought of him grinning, hands in his pockets, backing away down a cold winter street after a kiss that had felt like home. He thought of him naked above him, eyes full of things that Draco hadn’t been ready to understand.
Gabrielle seemed to be having a similar thought. “This is hideous,” she observed, gazing up at it. “And perhaps a bit offensive, I think.”
The Wasps were struggling, still off-kilter after the fight and subsequent suspensions the day before. Falmouth should have been an easy win for them, as the team was close to last in the current rankings, but—in contrast to the Wasps—they seemed to have taken heart from yesterday’s drama.
of spending a week in a secluded house with the eccentric little group he’d invited on this trip would have made Harry snort his beer out his nose. But then, three years ago, Ginny Weasley had—in a fit of drunken recklessness on a bet from some of her Quidditch teammates—sent a drink across a bar to an equally-drunk and reckless Pansy Parkinson. The rest was history. Soon, the pair were inseparable, and it hadn’t been long until the women, evenly matched in their stubbornness, had forced their respective friend groups together.
He needn’t have worried. People approached him one by one, pulling him away from whomever he was speaking to with polite “I hope you don’t mind”s and “is it alright if”s and “I was hoping”s. It was definitely strange being the sole person with whom people were seeking time, but not that much stranger than some of the Ministry events he’d been insistently dragged to over the years. And at least these people all supposedly wanted to get to know him, not get something out of him. That thought made him grimace, so he pushed it away.
“I just felt awful afterwards,” she told Blaise. “I don’t know what I was thinking. I guess I got a bit wrapped up in the idea of things and didn’t consider the reality of it. I’m trying my hand at sports reporting now. Much less stressful.”
Harry’s mouth slid from his shoulder to the dip of his neck, where he bit down again, slightly harder this time. Draco whimpered involuntarily. “I wouldn’t be opposed. But I generally prefer to be on the giving rather than receiving end of that, too, just so you know.” His voice was teasing, and Draco shivered, his mind immediately supplying him with an array of extremely interesting mental pictures. Merlin and Morgana, this man was going to kill him. Harry’s hands slid down Draco’s torso, edging toward his rapidly growing erection. “Although that’s not a hard and fast rule,” he added conversationally. Draco’s reply was nothing but an inarticulate whine. His head dropped back onto Harry’s shoulder as Harry’s hands reached their goal.
She patted his arm affectionately and wandered off, leaving Draco to make his way over to where Harry was looking outside, sipping at a mug of what was likely mulled wine, judging by the cinnamon stick garnish.
Her eyes trailed up his legs before they met his eyes, and she grinned. “I can’t feel my arms. But the view’s not bad.” She winked cheekily at him, and Harry snorted, reaching a hand down to help her up. “Come on, the worst is over. It’s all cocktails and hot tubs from here on out.”
. My family had a similar one when I was a kid, and they are super fun and super difficult to control. Also, if you fuck it up, you end up with snow up your pants legs, which is fairly unpleasant. Tuck your jeans into your socks, kids. You’ll thank me later.
“It’s not as though I’m planning a sit down dinner, darling. Between the four of us, we can easily manage.”
“I see,” Andromeda repeated. “So you decided to make it less awkward by running away from him and refusing to address what happened?”
“Peachy.” Draco’s teeth were gritted, and he freed one hand from the paddle just long enough to wipe the sweat from his brow, which caused his kayak to flounder slightly. “Fuck!”
“I thought the manual said you could heat the oven instantly with the magical modifications,” Harry said, confused.
,” Draco swore, arching off the bed in surprise. Harry’s snort of laughter vibrated through him, but he didn’t stop, instead sliding slowly back, running his tongue over the underside of Draco’s cock before swirling it around the tip and sinking back down again. Draco groaned and bent his knees to brace his feet on the bed. Harry’s hot, wet mouth continued to move, slow and teasing, forcing Draco higher and higher but never letting him near the precipice. Draco tried to thrust upward, but Harry draped one arm over his hips, holding him in place. “Now who’s a tease?” Draco bit out as Harry did something particularly wicked with his tongue.
Draco snorted. “I can. It sounds exactly like something Potter would do.” He bumped his shoulder against Harry’s pointedly.
He accepted the proffered martini and glanced around the pub, taking in the faces of a good number of their schoolmates. Most of them had been here for a few rounds already, if the unregulated volume and flushed cheeks were anything to go by. He caught sight of many of the people that he had hoped to avoid whilst in the country—Granger, Longbottom, and several Weasleys were all present—as well as others that he knew by sight but couldn’t remember ever interacting with and a handful of former Slytherins. Greg was, as Pansy had predicted, standing with a group of people that Draco vaguely recognized as Hufflepuffs, his arm protectively over the shoulder of a petite blonde. The Greengrass sisters were sitting at a table with the Patil twins, chatting away, and Theo Nott—whom Draco had not stayed in touch with after the war—was standing around a high top table with Millie Bulstrode and, oddly, Luna Lovegood.
“Quite well, thank you,” she answered in her comfortingly familiar brogue. “And yourself? It’s been quite some time since we’ve seen you.”
“She’s just trying to cause drama!” Nathalie insisted, eyes desperate. “She’s been doing it since we got here; anyone can tell you.”
When he stepped into Harry’s apartment, the living room was empty. Peering down the hall, he could see a light coming from the spare bedroom, so he made his way quietly over and found Harry leaning on the edge of a crib, looking down at a sleeping baby that he assumed was Rose Granger-Weasley. Harry glanced over at him and smiled, holding a finger to his lips. Draco gestured toward the living room with his head, and Harry nodded, following him and closing the door over behind himself.
“Honestly, it’s kind of hilarious. Before I tell you, though, will you tell me what you thought you might have said that had you so freaked out?”
The little wizard shook his head, eyes wide. “Oh no, certainly not; Ophelia could hold her liquor with the best of them.”
“Nothing wrong with that,” Harry assured her. “I understand the shop more than the rest, to be honest! I don’t know much about the arts, and I haven’t gotten a chance to travel much.”
, led his little gang directly over to Harry and his friends, hands in his pockets, somehow managing to saunter across the room despite the absolutely packed bar floor. “Well, well, well,” he said, voice and grin both dripping with pure sin, “What
“We’re doing pizza again?” Pansy complained several hours later as Greg happily kneaded dough in the kitchen. They were all sun-dazed and sleepy, and Harry felt pleasantly exhausted in a way that he usually associated with Quidditch or football. He was seated at the peninsula, and Ginny and Pansy were nearby, leaning on the countertop and watching Greg work. In the main room, Hermione and Ron were curled up on one sofa, and Draco was stretched out along another, visibly struggling to stay awake. Harry absolutely did not find it adorable.
The food, at least, was different than the night before, Harry was relieved to find. “Eating the same meal three nights in a row would start to feel a bit like Groundhog’s Day,” he told Sadiyah, making her laugh. They ate and chatted, somehow not sliding into the awkwardness that had arisen with Leela, but as they finished their last bites of lemon tart, the night took a familiar turn.
“Hmm.” Teddy frowned at the case and then ran off toward another display, immediately forgetting his deliberations as something new caught his eye. Draco smiled in amusement and followed.
Harry tensed slightly, but he kept his eyes moving, scanning the skies for that familiar glint of gold. Unfortunately, Smith seemed to notice the change in posture, because he latched on like a niffler on a necklace.
“For fuck’s sake, sit down, will you?” Draco hissed as Blaise took his time adjusting to the water. “Exhibitionist.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry could see Draco’s fists clenching and unclenching at his sides. His whole body radiated tension, like he was tempted to hit something himself. “You just more or less told me that you get into
Harry was just about bubbling over with excitement when he met Hilde in front of the school where Neville’s day camp met. “Hey!” he greeted her, smiling widely. “I’m so excited to get to share this with you.”
“Very,” Harry confirmed, kissing Draco before heaving himself upright and helping him to sit up. Now that Draco was regaining coherency, he took a moment to let himself take in Harry’s state. He was disheveled and sweaty, with his jeans around his ankles and his pants pushed halfway down his thighs, his jumper wrinkled from Draco’s grasping hands and smeared with come. It should have been hilarious, but instead, Draco just wanted to get the rest of the clothes off of him.
“Good.” When Draco had thoroughly worked the shampoo through Harry’s locks, he turned him again and made him rinse it out before moving on to his own.
Draco glanced across the hall to where his own door stood open before raising a suggestive eyebrow at Harry. “Or you could stay for a bit.”
“No offence, but that sounds like a ‘her’ problem,” Harry replied. “I’m sorry her boss sucks, but not sorry enough to humiliate myself in front of the whole country.”
“Do you mind if I steal you for a bit, Harry?” asked Dermot, his smile just as disarming as it had been on first sight.
“Yeah, loads of people. Ron ended up eating them, and I had to take him down to Slughorn for an antidote.” He stopped, realizing where that story had gone next and deciding that they could really do without dredging all of that up again. “So yeah, all of our friends and the Weasleys knew.”
Max’s jaw dropped in shock before snapping angrily shut. “Fuck you, Draco,” he growled, swinging himself out of the bed and grabbing his boxer briefs from the floor, pulling them roughly up his muscular legs. They were
“But?” Draco prompted him, feeling his heart rate increase. He knew where this was going. He was pretty sure he knew where this was going. And even though part of him still felt like he probably should, he really, really didn’t want to stop it.
Gabrielle’s drawing was done in oil pastels and was stylized, looking more like the sketch of a fashion designer than a likeness of Harry. Sadiyah’s was, like Jack’s, focused on one small section of him, but instead of his chest, she’d gone for his feet and calves.
“Don’t lie to us, son,” Lucius said sharply, eyes flashing. “You’ve not indicated in any way that you are involved with someone; you can’t
Harry grinned and pointed at a sandy patch further around the lake: not fully across—even he wasn’t cocky enough to attempt that distance—but a good ways along. “First one to the beach?”
“Let me through, dammit! No, I’m not family, but I’m—” Draco’s eyes went wide at the voice. It couldn’t possibly be—
“Okay.” Harry breathed again, trying to get his heart rate to believe that everything was fine. “Okay. Good. Thank you.”
Ron clapped a hand on his shoulder. “We knew it was complicated. We figured you’d let us know when you were ready. Besides,” he added, smiling wryly, “from a professional perspective, it was really better if I didn’t
Draco let out a squeaking sort of sound as his hands flew down to cover himself. Harry’s eyes shot up guiltily to where Draco was staring at him in wide eyed mortification, a brilliant blush spreading over his face and down his chest. “I— it was
Greg sighed sadly. “I’m going to have to clean out the oven and start over. Unless someone knows a charm for that?”
I’m gonna be honest, William Williams III only exists because I made myself laugh with the name. I am a creature of simple pleasures. Also, sorry Romilda; someone had to be That Girl who declares her love in the first couple episodes, and you were an easy target.
Harry sighed heavily but did as he was told. From behind the barrier, he could hear the door open and the chatter of his eight remaining contestants as they entered. From nearby, he heard Dermot’s voice, sounding incredulous.
Harry grimaced. “I mean I did apparently almost boil myself to death in the hot tub the other day, so.”
Harry and Draco followed a tiny, enthusiastic old wizard with large glasses and a long beard as he walked them through the exhibition. It began with a series of illustrations, blueprints, correspondence, and recipes from the 1600s, which were accompanied by a tiny, moving replica of what the whole operation would have looked like at the time. Draco and Harry observed the miniscule wooden wizards working the machinery, tiny wands waving over pewter cauldrons almost as tall as themselves, Draco pointing out the bizarre sartorial choices the artist had made while Harry tried not to laugh and offend their tour guide.
Harry tried to remember, but his brain was a bit fuzzy from the time change and the long drive. “I think there are a couple of kayaks or canoes? We can go check, if you like.”
,” Draco went on, glaring at her, “I was running short on things that I know you like that aren’t boring—”
, he supposed, but some of the people here were uncannily fit. The idea of Sullivan or Sadiyah, whose bodies were integral to their professions, spending hours staring at him while he was naked made him a little queasy. And that wasn’t even taking into consideration the fact that his dick would be hanging out the entire time. Although, at least he didn’t have to worry about getting an erection, he supposed; this was about the least sexy scenario he could think of at the moment.
They clinked their glasses together. A few feet away, a somewhat disheveled Spike and Angel made out furiously, oblivious to the crowd around them.
“Go fuck yourself,” Max spat, clearly not happy with Draco’s logic. Which, to be fair, didn’t paint him in a particularly flattering light. Grabbing his shirt and shoes, he stalked out of the room, muttering about arrogant pricks and self-involved wankers.
“I was curious who you were behind the banter, I guess. And as much as I hate to admit it, you were right that we’re anything but boring around each other. I’ve always preferred to date people who keep me on my toes. So I figured it was worth a shot.” He smirked. “But those tight trousers of yours didn’t hurt, either.”
Today I looked at a December 2006 calendar, added days of the week to my outline, realized a lot of things wouldn’t work as I’d originally planned if I accounted for Teddy being in school during the days, and subsequently spent like an hour cutting and pasting plot points into a different order (which is to say, this day did not start out here. It has time traveled.). I also spent more time than is probably reasonable researching daily start and stop times of Scottish primary schools, as well as when holiday breaks usually are. Why am I like this.
As the sounds of the rest of the group faded behind them, though, Romilda stopped, pulling him into the corner of a row of hedges that, as the wind rustled their leaves, reminded Harry uncomfortably of the maze he’d been forced to navigate during the Triwizard Tournament.
I never got to listen to much music growing up, what with the whole not-being-allowed-to-enjoy-anything-ever when I lived with the Dursleys and then going off to Wizard School in a castle without electricity and where batteries don’t work. There are only, like, three decent Wizarding bands, so it’s a pretty limited selection. Muggles just have so much more variety available to them; it’s kind of mind-blowing.
“It’s not as though I’m going to have him baking vol au vents! I’m simply planning to have him help with some of the prep work. He’s very excited about it.”
K&C had been founded in New York after the young heiress to the rather massive Kashburn fortune had started exhibiting signs of magic and her parents had been abruptly dropped into a world that they’d never imagined. As wealthy people are wont to do, they had immediately started thinking about how this shift in reality would affect their finances. The father, Kent Kashburn, had soon connected with the equally-wealthy pureblood wizard Calpurnius Costleigh—who had developed an interest in Muggle investments during the tech boom—and shortly thereafter, K&C was born.
Harry wrinkled his brow; around him, almost everyone else wore similar expressions. After a moment, Sadiyah spoke up. “It’s a sort of mystery, isn’t it? You have to solve it in a certain amount of time to get out of the room?”
Draco went on. “Now, I’ll be managing tomorrow’s group date from behind the scenes.” Harry nodded without opening his eyes to show Draco that he was listening. “We’re going with Ground Quidditch for the first one, while we still have enough people for two full teams. You’ll be refereeing. Since we can only focus on so many people at once, do you have anyone in particular that you think we should make sure to get? Anyone you’re feeling particularly interested in so far?”
“Because I called Vamp Willow before you thought of it, and that’s disgusting,” Ginny chimed in, smirking up at him. “Suck it up, buttercup.” Her tight corset pushed her otherwise-modest breasts upward rather impressively, and Harry spared a moment to think that she really had been wasted on him and his then-undiscovered homosexuality. From an objective, aesthetic standpoint, she looked hot as hell.
“The former. You’ve just rescued me from a lecture on the evolution of attitudes toward same-sex partnerships in Great Britain.”
“Did you really spend a week hiding in Gringotts to track that counterfeiter?” Draco asked curiously when they began discussing Harry’s latest article.
Andromeda and Narcissa had promised Teddy that everyone could decorate the Christmas tree together on Friday night. It was a change of pace for Draco, who had grown up with a cadre of elves magically festooning an array of vast trees scattered around the Manor every year, and he was actually quite looking forward to it (or, at least, he was once the hangover potion an amused Andromeda had passed him over breakfast had taken effect). They were planning to do it by hand, a tradition that Andromeda had picked up from her Muggle husband, and the idea of it made Draco smile. It felt intimate—a real, personal celebration of the season rather than a performance. It wasn’t until he heard the knocking at the door, however, that it occurred to Draco that ‘everyone’ included Potter. Because of course it did.
“What? Oh, fuck!” Harry pulled his stick back toward himself, blowing on it to extinguish the fire that had melted his marshmallow entirely off and proceeded to lick its way down the wood. When he looked up, Pansy was giving him a knowing smirk from across the way. Harry blushed and looked away. “Do you have any extras?” he asked Hermione, desperately hoping that the redness of his cheeks would be attributed to the warmth of the fire.
He seemed sad, Harry thought. It was a stark contrast with his earlier mood. Harry wondered if something had happened, and if he should offer to help, or if Draco would want him to pretend he didn’t notice. Draco could be a bit prickly when he was feeling vulnerable. He should probably just leave it.
Out of the corner of his vision, Draco caught McGonagall not bothering to contain her own eye roll, and he had to bite back a smirk. “Horace, then,” he corrected himself. “And Minerva. How have you been keeping?”
“I told you that you would,” Draco answered with a smirk, trying to ignore the butterflies fluttering about in his chest.
Narcissa kept her eyes focused downward, although Draco would swear he could see a slight crinkling at the corners of her eyes. “I suppose so.”
“You can’t call the Master Suite,” Harry said, ignoring the exchange. “First of all, I’m not even sure if there
“Draco, we’ve shared a locker room.” Harry leant back down to try to find underwear in his disaster of a suitcase. Eventually, he managed to unearth a pair of boxer briefs and pull them on.
“It’s lovely to see you, Mother,” he said, trying to sound enthusiastic rather than exhausted and uncomfortable but unable to hide his wince of pain.
“I don’t… I mean, yes! But is… hmm.” Draco cleared his throat, seemingly unable to formulate a coherent sentence, which Harry thought was fairly promising, as far as quality-of-kisses went. Finally, he settled on, “When did this happen?” He gestured vaguely in a way that Harry took to mean ‘When did you decide that you wanted to kiss my face off?’
We’re on the Smashing Pumpkins today, and I’m kind of obsessed. Billy Corgan’s voice does something to my gut. We’ve gone through half a bottle of something I found in the Black cellar that tastes sort of spicy-sweet and goes down deceptively smooth, so I’m feeling pleasantly fuzzy around the edges as I try to explain that gut feeling to Malfoy. I’m mid-sentence when he rolls over and kisses me.
Harry thought about his dwindling pool of suitors, all of whom seemed lovely, but none of whom he had the slightest clue as to whether there might be enough there to build something with, and one of whom he was supposed to set off with for a happily ever after in just a few weeks. His mood dropped.
“Pansy!” he said delightedly as his old friend’s face appeared in the flames. He had sent her, Blaise, and Greg each a short owl upon his return to the UK, expressing his wishes to see them while he was in the country. “Would you like to come through?”
“That’s what I’ve been trying to tell her,” Draco commented as this bit of conversation filtered through his personal musings and captured his attention. His mother shot him a dirty look, but finally capitulated when Teddy broke from his description of the rings of Saturn to say “I love Muggle lights! We saw amazing ones in London, didn’t we, Cousin Draco?”
“You’d think they’d be past the disgusting PDA phase by now, wouldn’t you?” Pansy asked, looking more intrigued than put off. Harry laughed.
Draco returned his arm to its place over his face as Harry once again slid his mouth slowly down his length. This time, though, the sensation was matched with that of a slippery finger lightly massaging at his hole. Harry pulled off long enough to cast a quick cleaning charm, making Draco shiver, and then went right back to what he’d been doing, torturing Draco with slow licks and sucks as he patiently slid one and then two fingers inside, carefully working him open over the course of what Draco would have sworn was hours.
They chose a new animated film whose poster featured a house floating under a huge bunch of balloons, figuring that a children’s movie would be a safe bet emotionally.
Draco’s silverware hit the table hard enough to startle Lucius out of his soliloquy.  “Stop. Just… stop talking. I’ve barely been back for a week; I do not have the energy to humor you and your...
“Three weeks,” she told him, “I know. But that’s long enough for the seeds of something. Maybe just that warm, tingly sort of new crush feeling. Even if it hasn’t grown past that.”
“They are. It’s just that not all of them were booby trapped for the same reasons. It’s like Diagon Alley: as long as you tap the right stones, it’s perfectly fine.”
“Hey,” Draco said, rising from his desk to catch him before he passed by completely. “Haven’t seen you today.”
“Of course I do!” Harry was only exaggerating a little bit. He had been kayaking exactly once, several years ago, for a very short amount of time at a free event in London. Still, he knew the basics. “It’s not that hard. You get in, you paddle.”
Draco rolled his eyes but couldn’t help but smile. He’d missed his friends, no matter how much they annoyed him.
Lucius looked incensed, but Narcissa spoke before he could respond. “Really, Draco; you sound downright histrionic. It isn’t as though we’re discussing a marriage contract, yet; it’s one evening. Astoria is a lovely girl, and the Greengrasses are some of the top league sponsors. She’s a very appropriate companion for you for the evening.”
Harry and Draco worked together like they’d been born to it, and if their respective partnerships hadn’t been working so well for so long, Draco might have considered it a waste that they weren’t paired together. Spells flew around them like fireworks, and they cast and dodged and shielded and attacked without speaking, without pause, until, suddenly, it was over.
Harry felt the blood drain from his face as the ramifications of his momentary loss of control hit home. It took everything he had to stay upright as the reality of the situation sank in. “Fuck.”
As he made his way back to his room, stretched, and showered, Harry contemplated how funny it was that Draco Malfoy, of all people, would be the one to pull him out of an emotional funk when it had once been his favorite hobby to be the one pissing Harry off in the first place. He was still a rude, snarky arsehole, but he never used it as a weapon anymore, and it made him entertaining as hell to hang out with. And aside from that, he wasn’t intimidated by Harry and didn’t feel a need to impress him. It was nice. As he curled up on his sofa with a book of Sudoku puzzles that Hermione had gifted him, once more wrapped in a fluffy bathrobe, Harry couldn’t help but hope that they’d get to spend more time together as filming went on. It was good to have someone here that he could be fully himself around.
This time, Sullivan couldn’t hold back a laugh. “Why don’t we just rest here for a bit? The sunset’s nice, and we don’t have to take off just yet, do we?”
Harry flicked him in the shoulder, but his smile returned. “Eight okay? There’s a place over near that coffee shop I took you that’s pretty good. About half a step up from the Three Broomsticks, I’d say, but they’ve got a pretty decent menu.”
Harry huffed a quiet laugh as he poured himself a mug of coffee. “That makes much more sense. Why didn’t she come up here herself? Shouldn’t it be your turn to take a day away?”
Ron rambled on, seemingly unable to stop the flow of words. “Harry… he’s had a rough time. Like, his childhood and the Voldemort stuff, sure, but even after that. He isn’t comfortable being himself around that many people; feels like he has to live up to all the stupid ‘Savior’ expectations. But for whatever reason, he obviously is, with you. Comfortable being himself, I mean. Being around you, being
They pushed the second door open, revealing a candlelit room that held a huge bed with white satin sheets strewn with red rose petals and what Harry thought was an extremely unnecessary number of pillows. Aside from that, there were only a bedside table with a single drawer that he found himself afraid to look into and—as he’d suspected—a door to a bathroom. The whole tableau made Harry feel like he was in a bad romance novel.
“You want to see where things go.” Harry thought about the number of times he’d noticed the two of them together on the outskirts of things, gravitating toward each other like they couldn’t help it. It made a lot of sense, in retrospect.
Perry, who had been calming down, burst into laughter again and wrapped his arms around Harry. “Fuck, I’m sorry, it’s not funny, it’s just—”
Harry snorted into his hand. Ophelia looked down and broke her glare just long enough to wink at them.
“And Blaise admitted that he actually went out with Harry a few times,” Draco added, trying to hide his less-than-casual interest in the news.
I have head casts for quite a few of these characters. Highlights include Cormac, who I still see as
“I’d like that,” Harry answered. He levered himself up using the lower bar of the guard rail and gave Perry’s shoulder a squeeze before heading back down to the main deck. As he was making his way toward the ship’s bar, he ran smack into Jack, who had blended into the shadows in their dark jeans and leather jacket. They caught him by the arms before he could fall, raising one dark, thick eyebrow at him.
He had, after getting over his initial shock at George Weasley’s romantic (or, at least, sexual) involvement with his best friend, had a rather long exchange with him about finances; it turned out that the joke shop had continued to do quite well and George was keen on getting longer term investment tips. He’d not only gotten into a discussion on regulations on magical imports and exports with Hermione Granger, of all people, but they had
“Good evening, and welcome to the Bachelor House, everyone! This will be your home for the next three weeks—if you’re lucky.” There was an answering smattering of laughter, and Blaise beamed at them. “Starting tomorrow, you will have a chance to go on a variety of dates, both group and solo, with Harry here.” He clapped Harry on the shoulder jovially. “After each date or set of dates, one or more of you will be sent home. By the end of our stay, one of you will be leaving here with the love of your life! But let’s not worry about that now. For tonight, all you have to do is relax, enjoy yourselves, and get to know our charming bachelor a bit. Harry, would you like to say anything to your suitors?”
Hilde sighed, tilting her head up toward the ceiling. “I’m sorry, I just… Perry and Sadiyah both got fun, charming sorts of dates; why the hell am I stuck babysitting? I thought we would do something exciting, something romantic.”
“Absolutely. That Quidditch game was more fun than I’ve had in a while, even if my team did lose. I don’t get to play much anymore.”
Harry kissed him back briefly but stood firm. “It won’t be as good if it sits. I worked hard on that dinner; it deserves to be appreciated at its best.”
“—so, I don’t know. It just feels hopeless, and it’s only been two weeks. I’m starting to wonder if it might be better just to admit defeat.”
“I’m going to imagine you like this every time I look at this counter, now,” he said, eyes traveling up and down Draco’s pale skin and quivering muscles. Then, without warning, he landed a hard smack to each bared arse cheek, making Draco gasp at the sudden stinging heat. Harry’s eyes stayed avidly focused on where the blows had landed, and Draco knew that the skin must already be reddening by the look on his face. “Actually, I’m going to imagine you like
“No. It might actually be Hermione; it depends on who’s done with work first. Probably ‘Mione, honestly, considering what Diagon Alley is like this time of year.”
“Harry, where did you—Merlin and Morgana, Potter, why is your door open?! Put some clothes on!” Harry straightened from where he’d been bent over and looked over his shoulder, a pair of jeans and a worn tee in his hands, to find a rather pink Draco standing in the doorway. Despite his words, he was making no effort to turn away; instead, his eyes were focused quite firmly on Harry’s bum. Harry found his reaction somewhat surprising but immensely gratifying. Still, though—
The solution presented itself quite unexpectedly when Draco made his first visit to the Wasps’ resident Healer. Team practices were starting the following week, and all players were required to do a general physical beforehand. When Draco arrived for his appointment, he was surprised to find that their Healer was none other than Luna Lovegood. Although they’d been on friendly-enough terms by the time Draco had left for France, they hadn’t kept in touch—although to be fair, Draco hadn’t kept in touch with much of anyone; that was sort of the point of leaving—and he’d had no idea she had gone into healing.
His hair, now dry, was still a mess of wild curls, but they were smoother, softer, shinier. The chaos looked intentional rather than like he’d been attacked by a bird of prey and not bothered to do anything about it afterward. Harry ran his fingers through it, looking awestruck. “What that actual fuck?”
Harry groaned. “I know I came here looking for a partner, but I can’t say this is the way I imagined someone I’m dating seeing me naked.”
Harry tried, envisioning the already sour-faced professor’s reaction to the abomination they’d just created, setting off another wave of laughter. “Shit, I can’t breathe,” he gasped. Perry was almost crying.
Sadiyah gave an inelegant snort of laughter. “Yeah, Leela told me about that. It sounded…” She paused. “I can’t think of a tactful word to finish that sentence with.”
“Harry.” The second hand came up, the thumb now wiping away tears instead of blood. Draco’s eyes flitted between Harry’s, still searching, and then he leaned in. Harry was frozen.
“Welcome, class!” A cheerful, plump woman who reminded Harry pleasantly of Molly Weasley stood at the front of the room, her hands clasped before her. “My name is Nancy, and I’m so pleased that you’re all here. Now, let me ask: how many of you have any baking experience?” Harry raised his hand reluctantly, as did three or four others. “Excellent. Although by your faces, I have some suspicions, so I’m going to follow up by asking: how many of you have had any baking
An hour later, they were on their third cup of something that Draco found fairly odd-tasting, but not unpleasant, and Luna had somehow managed to get every detail of his burgeoning relationship with Harry—and its already-mounting obstacles—out of him.
Draco groaned, his control once again slipping as he gave silent thanks to whatever deities might be listening that Harry apparently deemed a second date a perfectly acceptable time to move past snogging and onto a world of other interesting possibilities.
The plan for the day was a hike through the dense forest stretching out in every direction from the house. There was a trailhead half a mile’s walk down the road from them, according to the house guide, so Hermione had taken it upon herself to map a route for them. She’d also inspected everyone’s outfits before they departed, sending people back if they didn’t have heavy enough trousers or long enough socks (“There is poison ivy out there, and I’m not dealing with any of you whinging if you walk through it accidentally”), and doused them all in Muggle bug spray (“I don’t trust the charms we know; some of the insects are entirely different species, and some of them carry diseases!”). Blaise had pouted when she’d vetoed his outfit choice—which had involved a pair of
When the music changed, Dermot tried to claim him, but Harry ducked out of his grasp. He’d already decided that Dermot was going home tonight no matter how pretty he looked in his eyeliner; he had no interest in wasting his own time or leading Dermot on. The look on Dermot's face when Harry allowed his hand to be captured by Leela made it clear that he understood and was less than pleased, but to his credit, he didn’t try to force anything. Instead, he stepped slightly outside of their circle to dance with a handsome dark skinned man in body glitter that had been unsubtly eyeing him.
“Because it sounded like fun, and I wanted to get away for awhile! It’s a free stay in a very nice Wizarding vacation home in the Catskills, which are supposed to be beautiful. I really don’t understand why this is such a hard thing for you to wrap your head around.”
Harry sighed. “Yeah. I just… I hoped that maybe, for once, I might meet someone who…” He shook his head. “Pretty stupid, yeah? To think that people coming on a television show would be
Harry rolled his eyes but couldn’t help but be relieved that Draco seemed to have gotten past his weird reaction to Harry’s date with Perry. And, on reflection, Harry couldn’t think of anything from yesterday’s beach trip that had gone wrong, so he’d apparently decided to respect Harry’s request that he not interfere unless Harry actually asked him to.
Draco sighed, deciding it was time for him to take control of the situation. It was his life, after all. “Hugh, I understand that this isn’t ideal for you. I, personally, think that this rivalry is juvenile and embarrassing, but if you insist on maintaining it to the point of interfering in my personal affairs, I can always leave the team. I have other options.”  He was mildly surprised at his own words—he hadn’t actually known that he was going to say them until they were out of his mouth—but he found that he didn’t particularly want to take them back.
Harry meandered back inside, feeling much more sober than he had a few minutes ago. Trying to shake off the lingering guilt over Gabrielle, he scanned the crowd. The only person he hadn’t had a chance to dance with yet, he realized, was Sullivan. And thinking back on how the man had looked earlier in the night, he admitted to himself that he really,
“Absolutely not; you’d be a maudlin drunk on a day like today. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to go make sure your remaining suitors are all still alive and in one piece.” Harry laughed but let him go.
The interview continued, but Harry’s mind was elsewhere. He hadn’t honestly spent much time envisioning futures with any of these people, he realized, and he wasn’t really sure what to do about that. Later, as he was drifting off to sleep, he resolved to do some actual thinking on his day off.
It wasn’t too much later than Harry returned, a bundled-up Teddy in tow. “Right, we’re off, then! We’ll be back by dinner.” Teddy was all but bouncing in excitement, obviously eager to be off.
Draco gave him a look. “Am I actually invisible to you, or do I just not count as a person?” he asked, and his voice was somewhere between sardonic and resigned.
“—of us when we went sledding, yeah. It’s amazing,” Harry said softly, watching the tiny trio slide down the hill. “Thank you.”
Despite his inner turmoil, Harry found himself smiling slightly. He patted the planks next to him, laughing quietly as Draco cast a quick scouring charm before lying down next to him, mimicking his posture to look up at the clear night sky. They lay there listening to the low murmur of their friends around the side of the house for a few minutes before Draco spoke.
“Oh,” Harry said. He appeared to deflate slightly, obviously having geared himself up for a much more fraught conversation. “So… we were worried about the same thing, then? Nothing’s actually changed?”
He consulted the book quickly, relieved to see that he had remembered correctly. After that, it was just a quick drive into town, and he was back at Draco’s side in less than half an hour. Draco was still on the bathroom floor, although he was now seated against the wall, so Harry assumed that the worst was over.
In the end, they compromised; Draco allowed Harry to plate up their pasta and pop the soufflés into the oven, but then insisted that they eat in bed so that he didn’t have to put his clothes (which, thankfully, Harry had banished rather than vanished and had summoned back from wherever he’d sent them once he’d pulled up his own jeans) back on. Harry had obediently disrobed when directed and slid in after him, and they’d eaten the not-at-all-spoiled and properly impressive dinner propped up against fluffy pillows, leaning against each other. Harry had disappeared briefly, but only to retrieve their pudding, returning promptly with two gorgeous, perfectly risen chocolate confections.
“Oh, Merlin.” He closed his eyes. He’d been sure he was free of his mother’s borderline-pathological party planning when she’d given up the manor. “Must you?”
“For fuck’s sake,” Draco sneered. “So, what, we’re all just supposed to put up with you flouncing about in the nude for the entire week?”
Shaking his head, Draco turned his attention to the boy, whose hair had now shifted from its Potter-esque mop to a plethora of turquoise waves. “I suppose we should go have some pancakes, shouldn’t we?”
fault that the proprietors had chosen such a heinous set of robes to feature. Not for the first time, he wished that being advertising manager for
Once she’d won, they split into teams of three, Harry, Ron, and Hermione partnering up and promptly crushing the others, of whom only Draco appeared to have any skill at all. While he grumbled about unfair advantages (“what, you mean having hand-eye coordination?” Harry had teased, earning himself a poke to the side that left him laughing and skittering out of the way) Ginny and Pansy wandered in, followed a bit later by Greg.
Harry didn’t mind the club they ended up at as much as he’d thought he might. This was largely because it was Muggle, so no one harassed them; they blended into the crowd easily. Blaise had explained, as he ushered them all to a limousine, that they had a tab at the bar to charge their drinks to the show and were free to partake as much as they liked. Harry suspected that Pansy was hoping that at least one of them would get horrifically drunk just to create some drama, since the last episode had been—aside from Harry’s breakdown, which she had begrudgingly agreed not to air—fairly anticlimactic.
“Oh,” Draco said, surprised. His mother had, of course, tried to talk him into transferring offices, but he hadn’t really thought of it as an option. “What would it entail? All of my clients are in the US; I can’t imagine they’d be pleased if I moved abroad.”
1) I fucking love Ethiopian food. 2) My longest chapter yet is just porn! I don’t know why I find that fact so funny. I hope you enjoyed this completely gratuitous smut; silly sex is the best sex, IMHO.
Draco smiled; he’d suspected that might be the case, but it was both relieving and amusing to have it confirmed. “The same, more or less.”
To his credit, Malfoy didn’t even flinch as Harry landed a few yards away, only raising an eyebrow at his abrupt appearance. “I feel like I should be more surprised by this,” he greeted Harry, sounding more amused than anything.
As soon as Draco’s lips brushed his, however, Harry snapped out of his daze, quickly turning his head away and squeezing his eyes shut against a fresh wave of tears. “Don’t,” he pleaded, and his voice sounded wrecked. “Please, Draco. Not if you don’t mean it.”
“It’s just that you’ve had such a rough time, and I don’t want— I don’t want to be one more person who hurts you, even if you don’t really want to be with me, either.”
“It was a Muggle bar. And—” Harry was very glad that he wasn’t facing Draco for this part. “And I hit him first, anyway. It’s fine.” Draco was silent, and Harry babbled on, fueled by alcohol and anxiety. “You just got home earlier than I expected; normally I’d have—” He stopped abruptly. Shit.
“I remember the Triwizard Tournament,” Perry said somberly. “Tried to enter, actually. I don’t think I’ll ever forget what it was like when you came out of that maze. I can’t imagine having lived it.” He paused. “I didn’t see much of the action during the war. I was in Healer training by then. But seeing the people who survived long enough to make it to the hospital… Well. It’s understandable, is what I’m trying to say, I guess.”
They moved the muffin tin onto a cooling rack while they waited for everyone else to finish. Harry felt surprisingly optimistic as he watched other teams’ final products come out of the ovens. Theirs were some of the best ones; he could see some that obviously hadn’t risen at all and some that were definitely a bit burnt on top, and one team was staring forlornly at their perfectly golden, smooth domes and the bowl of blueberries that they had clearly forgotten to incorporate sitting to the side.
Draco let his gaze trail obviously down Harry’s body and back up again before giving him a challenging smirk. “You’ll just have to stay quiet, then, won’t you?”
“Oh,” Draco said, surprised, and answered without considering. “No, that’s quite all right, but thank you.”
“Do I have to?” he complained, holding his hands up in resignation at her glare before turning to look at Greg. “How long does that need to rise before we can cook?” he asked.
Harry tilted his head. “I mean, maybe if Snape had been twenty years older? I always think the woman who plays his wife looks like Trelawney, though.”
Harry got to bed early. He was slightly off kilter and not really sure why, and sleeping it off seemed much more appealing than trying to figure it out. He felt well-rested and refreshed when he got up the next day, so he pushed the night’s discomfort out of his mind, deciding that he must just have been overtired after two somewhat intense days in a row. It was mild and sunny, so he decided to go have a walk around the extensive grounds for a change of scenery.
As Draco landed on his back in the snow, the air pushed from his lungs by the force of it, he could faintly hear Teddy laughing from what must have been several meters away. “That was wicked!” He felt relief wash over him. Thank Merlin for cushioning charms.
“It’s fine,” Draco assured him, smiling in a way that he knew was probably embarrassingly fond. “But I don’t think you want to sleep on my shoulder all night.”
“So, Harry! That was quite the day, and night. Let’s start easy. How do you feel about your modeling experience?”
Draco was pressed in a corner of the shower, on tip-toe, trying to avoid the sprays of water coming from every direction. His eyes shot up at Harry’s entrance, frantic. “There’s something wrong with this shower!” he yelled, sounding panicked.
Ron’s expression had grown, if possible, even more exasperated. “You two deserve each other,” he muttered under his breath. “Look. Malfoy. He really cares about you, alright? It’s like, annoyingly obvious. All he does anymore is work or spend time with you, and when he’s not with you, he’s talking about you. I haven’t seen him like this about anyone since… well, ever. I haven’t seen him like this, ever, and he’s been my best mate for fifteen years.”
Perry opened his eyes again and turned his head sideways so that he could meet Harry’s gaze. “That he’s so clearly gone on you that it’s painful to watch.”
Ron, however, was giving Harry a rather pained look. “Mate. You do know that silencing charms are a thing, right?”
Reluctantly, she turned around, slinking off to the remaining room further down the hall, Hermione and Ron having already claimed the other.
Harry felt bad that you didn’t get any smut yesterday, so he asked me to throw some in to today’s chapter for you. Draco did not mind in the slightest.
“I wouldn’t be surprised, to be honest. Pretty much everything else I thought was myth when I was a kid has turned out to be real. Plus quite a few things I hadn’t heard of, actually.”
“He’s part of the family!” Draco said, exasperated. Andromeda once again raised an eyebrow, and he glared. “Not like
Potter’s gaze had followed Draco’s hand, but at that, he snorted and turned back to his own desk. “Careful, your vanity is showing.”
Harry thought through the series of disasters that had been enacted upon the most problematic contestants and couldn’t help but grin. Even though the incident with Perry had pissed him off, Harry had to admit to himself that he’d thoroughly enjoyed the rest of it.
Amid the bursts of sound, Harry felt rather than heard someone sidle up beside him. A hand touched his arm lightly, and he glanced over to see Perry giving him a complicated sort of look. “Hey,” he murmured, leaning in close enough to Harry’s ear that he could hear him over the fireworks, but no one else would be able to. “I know I wasn’t supposed to, but I sort of… saw a bit of what happened in the room.” Harry winced, and Perry tightened his grip slightly in a reassuring squeeze. “You don’t have to talk about it, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.”
It turned out that spending time with Teddy wasn’t as difficult as Draco had anticipated. The child was an endless well of energy and ideas, and he wanted to show Draco absolutely everything—his room, his toys, his books, his favorite nooks and crannies of the house. All Draco had to do was tag along and make appropriately impressed noises. Having been raised in high society, this was a trick he was intimately familiar with. Still, Draco had been exhausted by the end of the day, and he woke up late on Sunday, the combination of jetlag and the undivided attention of an enthusiastic eight-year-old enough to knock him out for a full twelve hours. Thankfully, his locking charm had held.
Feeling somewhat disoriented, Harry took a few moments to head back to the bar and down a large plastic cup of cold water, trying to get his bearings. After a moment, he decided another drink was in order as well. He was about to order when Hilde appeared at his elbow. “Do a shot with me?” she asked. Harry nodded and stood aside as she ordered two shots of tequila, which were handed over with a couple of lime slices and a separate shot glass containing a few spoonfuls of salt. With a look that Harry could tell spelled trouble, she took his hand and slowly licked the soft stretch of skin between his thumb and forefinger, sprinkling it with salt before doing the same to her own. He shivered as she placed his shot into his other hand. “Lick, swallow, bite,” she instructed him.
“I… suppose that would be fine, yes.” Draco wasn’t sure how he felt about this development, but he suspected that he wasn’t being given a choice in the matter.
“Well you’re certainly not having champagne for breakfast here!” Narcissa looked scandalized at the very idea, which had really been Draco’s intent all along. He grinned and kissed her cheek before going to make himself some coffee and toast.
Nancy’s eyes were watering, and she had a hand over her mouth. She swallowed, looking a bit ill. “Well then,” she croaked. She coughed, held up a finger, and gulped down half of her glass of water in one go. “Who can tell me what went wrong here?”
Although he chimed in to the conversation here or there, Draco spent most of the meal observing fondly as Teddy gesticulated wildly while explaining things like the massive size and power of the sun to an apparently-rapt Harry. Harry glanced over at him from time to time with a conspiratorial smile, winking at Draco when he caught him hiding a grin at Teddy’s increasingly-fanciful interpretations of the facts. Draco did his very best to pretend that those smiles weren’t pushing him toward a complete meltdown. He didn’t realize that his inner turmoil was obvious until he caught his mother and aunt giving him twin amused glances, causing him to blush and turn his full attention to his pasta.
“Good afternoon, Harry. You needn’t call me by my full name, you know,” Narcissa responded as he joined them.
Blaise brought the boat slowly to a stop, the impressive smoothness of which was ruined when he switched it off and it fell the last few inches into the water with a stomach-dropping
Sullivan laughed. “Merlin, no. They’re much too pragmatic for that. Know how to keep their heads down when it’s good for them. But the Death Eaters probably would have tried to recruit us all eventually; we’re Sacred Twenty-Eight and all that nonsense, so he would have considered us a real get. So we decided to get out before it came to that. My parents never cared about blood purity and all that. I mean, neither do I, obviously.” He looked over at Harry, his expression sincere.
“Not in the slightest. But I’ve got too much dirt on her for you to need to worry about it. And besides, I’m hoping she’ll give us a copy. For posterity, you know.”
Blaise laughed. “Well then. We’re down to your top ten suitors. Are you looking forward to your next group date?”
Harry knocked on the doorway of the small office that Narcissa had begrudgingly allowed Draco to claim for his work so that he wouldn’t keep taking over the dining room table. “Hey there. Am I interrupting?”
The driver obediently made her way back to the dock to switch out their equipment, reassuring them that actually, a lot of adults enjoyed tubing as well. It was, thankfully, much easier than water skiing, and Harry and Sullivan had a blast as the boat whipped them around on their double tube, holding on for dear life. And if Harry did manage to fall off once, well, at least he could blame it on the difficulty of balancing their disparate weights.
Romilda crumpled to the floor, and Harry could see Hilde and Dermot to either side of her rolling their eyes as Owen crouched to soothe her.
Ron had been completely kind and reasonable about Harry’s disappearance after the match. “It’s fine, mate. I probably wouldn’t have wanted to talk to me just then, either, if I were you.”
“A bit of both, I suppose. You see a lot of people’s personalities coming out in competitions like this morning’s.”
“Do you—” Harry started, but he could hear his voice shaking. He stopped, took a deep breath, and started over. “Do you have any idea how many people died so that it would ‘turn out okay’?”
Draco let out a breath and pulled back slowly before sinking back in, building up a gentle rhythm as he watched himself ease in and out of Harry’s body. Harry’s eyes fell shut as any remnants of discomfort faded away, leaving only the surreal bliss of letting another person—letting
“Anyone else need anything?” he asked, looking away, and when he was waved off, the group traipsed back up to the house.
“There are coffee and cinnamon rolls in the kitchen,” Narcissa told Harry over her own steaming mug. “Why don’t you go fix yourself a plate, and then we can begin?”
“Mmm, fair.” Draco straightened, dislodging Harry—who made a small noise of complaint—to reach for a bottle of shampoo. He inspected the label and grimaced. “Good lord. No wonder your hair won’t behave.” He set it back down, deciding that no shampoo was better than terrible shampoo. “I’m replacing that. Don’t bother arguing.”
Harry huffed a quiet laugh. “Yes, sir.” He let his hand drop, and Draco caught it for a moment, squeezing his fingers briefly before stepping back.
Wondering who it could possibly be, he wiped off his hands and removed his apron. He went to join his aunt in the foyer only to find her standing in the company of none other than Ron Weasley.
With a dejected sort of groan, Perry flopped backward so that his head was on the back of the couch, staring up at the ceiling. “They did warn me, but I was
The comment hit hard, and Harry couldn’t contain his wince. He tried to rub a hand down his face, but grimaced as he bumped his swollen eye. He felt so small. He’d never wanted Draco to know about any of this. “I just… get angry, sometimes,” he muttered. “I go by myself. It’s just… an outlet. I don’t know. It’s never with anyone I could actually hurt. And I can heal myself. It’s just a thing I do. Sometimes.”
My friends know we hang out. I told them early on, because if there was going to be a big blow up about it, I wanted to get it out of the way. Everyone was pretty chill, though. I think, since the war, we’re all more aware of how our world set us up to hate each other on purpose and of how much we don’t want to be a part of all that anymore.
“I hate you.” Harry felt a hand smack halfheartedly at his chest, and he reflexively snapped a hand up to catch it.
Pansy’s crow Patronus gave one last indignant flap of its wings before dissolving into the air. Across the room, Andromeda tried to hide a snort. “It sounds like you have somewhere to be,” she said wryly.
“Before we knew for sure that I was a witch,” she confided in him, sounding nostalgic, “rollercoasters were the closest I could get to flying. I haven’t been on one in ages.”
Perry snorted. “Yeah, pretty sure that one was more for him than for you. Not the point. Did he ask you ahead of time what sorts of things you wanted to do?”
“Thanks,” he said, immediately heading back downstairs and out toward the bridge where he’d seen Sullivan conversing with a frog just last week.
Draco felt something glow in his chest and glanced around the space they were in to distract himself from the feeling. It wasn’t huge, perhaps the size of one of the larger Hogwarts classrooms, with long tables and neat stacks of wood filling most of the space. It smelled of the sawdust that coated the floor, and there were carved toys in various states of completion scattered across the tabletops, some of them already moving about.
Brooms and bodies collided, and a bevy of hexes shot out in random directions, narrowly missing the brawling players. Harry saw stars as a punch thrown by Smith caught him in the eye and was fleetingly thankful that he’d gotten his vision fixed after one too many mid-game accidents, because his glasses would likely have shattered at the impact.
It turned out that the ‘drowning their sorrows’ bit was scheduled for the end of the tour, but Harry found that he didn’t actually mind, as the tour itself was quite fascinating. The Ogden’s distillery had taken a page from some of the older Muggle distilleries and breweries and had built a sort of museum around the actual functioning parts of the business.
When he’d taken a leisurely shower and dressed, Draco made his way downstairs and found his mother and aunt curled over an array of papers on the kitchen table. “Good morning, Draco,” Andromeda greeted him. “Would you like some breakfast?” She looked at the grandfather clock in the corner. “Or lunch, I suppose.”
“I guess.” Harry lay in silence for a while. After a few moments, he felt a tentative hand brush a piece of hair off his forehead. The softness of the gesture made him feel like crying.
Blaise gave him an unapologetic grin. “Well, I know that, but our audience might not. Are you and he close outside of the show?”
“It was! She just pointed out that we didn’t really have any chemistry and said she thought we’d be better as friends. Which is true.” Harry shrugged. “We ended up playing chess for a while and going to bed early.”
“Give that back!” cried Nathalie, face flushed. Now that Hilde had separated herself, Harry could see that Nathalie was being held back by Dermot and Perry.
“That’s one way of putting it,” Draco said dryly. “Another would be ‘absolutely livid with my supposed friend and co-producer, who apparently had me tailed by invisible cameras for the entirety of filming.’”
Jack held Harry’s gaze as they took a sip of the whisky they’d just been served. “You tell me,” they said, finally, leaning casually against the bar and immediately undoing all of Harry’s mental efforts to quash the panic that Jack seemed to consistently instill in him.
Forty five minutes later, Harry woke to the sight of Luna looming over him, her head tilted as though she was observing some form of interesting wildlife rather than a friend of more than a decade, her long hair tickling his nose. “Jesus,” he said, scrambling back a bit to sit up, one hand clutching the towel that was thankfully draped across at least the most important bits of his lower half. “You couldn’t have, I dunno, shaken me or something?”
Once Teddy had demolished his own stack of gifts, leaving a trail of crumpled wrapping paper in his wake, he distributed the rest of the presents with an air of benevolence that had Draco coughing to cover a laugh and Andromeda and Harry visibly struggling to keep straight faces. Narcissa took it in stride, giving him a courteous nod as she accepted her own small stack.
Just then, Blaise appeared, and Pansy cut them off, eyeing the puzzle one last time. “Yes, yes, it’s all very lovely and heartwarming, I’m sure, but could you perhaps step away from the physical manifestation of your mental breakdown and come do this interview?”
“Yes, go ahead. The interview will be tomorrow after dinner, and the Fantasy Suite dates will start the next day.”
“Better than I’d expected,” Draco admitted truthfully, “although I wish my family lived someplace a little less remote. Are you familiar with Hogsmeade, in Scotland?”
“It’s no trouble,” she replied lightly. “And as for a safe place to go, I have a house out in West Devon. Well, more of a cottage, really, I suppose. But you’d be welcome to use it as a place to meet; I’m hardly there these days, so you’d have plenty of privacy.”
Harry studied the piece, turning it over a few times, pale blue to brown cork to pale blue again, before handing it back. “Why haven’t you done that one yet?”
“Master Draco is out by the pond,” the elf responded in a croaky voice somewhat reminiscent of Harry’s old elf Kreacher.
“Harry,” Perry said, sounding tired. “He wants you. And you want him.” He grimaced. “And I want to commiserate with the rest of this bottle of wine and then maybe have someone modify my memory so that I can at least
“Would you like to stop getting in the way and open whatever you brought tonight, Harry?” Andromeda asked from where she was still chopping vegetables at the other end of the island.
Draco was just taking his first sip of coffee when the floo flared and Harry stepped through, also in his pajamas—blue fleece bottoms festively printed with snowflakes and a long-sleeved thermal shirt, along with a pair of spectacularly clashing orange, Chudley Cannons-branded slippers. Draco raised an eyebrow and smirked as he looked him up and down, and Harry grinned ruefully. “Teddy would never have forgiven me for getting dressed.” He seemed more cheerful than he had the night before, and Draco was glad. He wanted to enjoy this last bit of time with them all without thinking about what tomorrow would bring.
Hilde gave a smile like the cat who got the cream and held up her left hand, which sported an enormous diamond ring. “I’m engaged!’
Draping his arms over Harry’s shoulders, Draco grimaced. “Sadly, she has always managed to know far more about my life than I would like her to. But at least it means I didn’t have to sneak out.”
“Debatable.” Draco smirked, and Harry moved his hand to mess up the meticulously styled white-blond hair, earning himself an indignant squawk and effectively ending the moment.
“Bite me,” Draco answered acerbically, yelping when Harry did. Before he could form a complaint, however, Harry’s nimble fingers were undoing his trousers, sliding under the waistband to caress his hip bones.
“I didn’t really mean to be gone overnight.” He felt a guilty twinge in his gut. He hadn’t even thought about sending a message.
Harry chanced a glance up to see Draco looking down at him, not with pity, but empathy. “Yeah. I do.”
Everyone moved obediently toward the supply closet to select their materials, but over the sounds of moving chairs, Harry heard a snort of derision coming from, he suspected, Dermot again. He narrowed his eyes. He seemed to remember Dermot mentioning that he’d been a Ravenclaw and was a year below Harry, which would mean that he’d been in Luna’s class. Harry found himself wondering, suddenly, if Dermot was one of the people who used to do things like hide all of her shoes.
“Oh. Yeah, okay.” The light dimmed a little, but didn’t disappear. “Want to just take our wine over to the sofa and talk, then?”
He’d never been able to say no to Molly, not since the day she’d sent him his very first Weasley sweater, symbolically adopting him into her brood. He’d only felt more grateful as the years went on and she continued to love and take care of him, giving him the closest thing he’d had to a home besides Hogwarts, even after it had become apparent to everyone that he and Ginny were not going to get back together after the war. So when she found him on his own, watching the sunset and drinking his sixth glass of champagne, he’d been a goner.
“Revel in your smugness,” Draco advised him. “You can’t control your feelings, so you might as well enjoy them.”
Draco pulled back first, breathing heavily, looking down at Harry with an expression that was awed and confused and uncertain and hopeful all at once.
“You’re still great,” Harry told him sincerely. “Not that I particularly remember how you played at school, but the Slytherin team was always our biggest competition.”
Draco hoped that his flush could be blamed on the sudden transition from the outside chill to the cozy interior of the shop and focused his gaze up at the menu on the wall. If he hadn’t known that Harry was straight, he might have taken that as flirting. Awkward, accidental flirting, perhaps, but still. “Earl grey?”
“...I hadn’t planned to?” Harry glanced at Draco, trying to figure out what was going on, but Draco wasn’t looking at him.
“It’s fine,” Draco said with a small smile. “It’s just that… “ He took a deep breath. “It’s all been so much
He spent an extremely pleasant day with the children, reading them the story he’d promised the day before and losing spectacularly at hide and seek due to being roughly three times the size of the smaller kids. It did wonders for his mood, and by the time he was scheduled to meet up with Leela, he felt much more himself.
“Yes, you would have.” Her voice was mildly exasperated, but her face was fond. “Well, you’re off duty now. She’s in the spare room?”
“Actually, I’m pretty sure you owe them a fruit basket. If they’d kept their mouths shut, Perry never would have convinced me that I had a chance with you.”
ages ago, and even then, it was always the same dull dinners with the same dull people at the same dull restaurants. I’m
The small wizard handed them off to a tall, stern young woman who walked them through the basics of whisky evaluation, showing them how to swirl the small amounts of liquid in the glasses they were given to see how it coated the sides, pointing out the variations in coloring of different types, and explaining what she called ‘the veela’s share’, the portion of the liquor that evaporated into the ether and required a specific magical ventilation system to avoid wafting clouds of highly flammable mist.
It was twilight when Harry met the blue team out on the sprawling patio. Candles lit the area, highlighting an array of lounge furniture and a few secluded, trellised areas near the perimeter, and the center was taken up by an enormous swimming pool and a large hot tub, both lit from within. A long table covered in buckets of ice filled with bottles of wine and champagne stood to one side. Harry was sporting a pair of swim trunks much more modest than his earlier outfit with a short sleeved linen shirt and was pleased to find his companions similarly attired in combinations of swimwear and casual summer clothes. Cormac, Harry noticed, had foregone a shirt completely, displaying a rather impressive six pack. He was obviously very proud of his physique, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to blame him.
“No, it was,” Harry assured him. Draco still looked unsure, so Harry patted the bed next to where he was laying, waiting in silence until Draco reluctantly sat down. “It was a great date idea,” he continued. “Or, it would have been with someone else. I just managed to miss a major compatibility mismatch. And the fact that she might have been more interested in my money than in me.”
By the time they returned to Hogsmeade it was nearly time for dinner, and Teddy had started to whine as the exhaustion of the day hit him. Draco didn’t blame him; he felt like he, himself, could rather use a nap. As Andromeda ushered Teddy upstairs, Harry made to leave. “Thanks for coming with us,” he said as he reached for the floo powder.
Draco poked at the gaudily-dressed witch featured in the ad for Gladrags that had just been dropped onto his desk in distaste. The witch squirmed away from his finger and glared at him, obviously offended. He rolled his eyes. It wasn’t
Harry headed home just before nine, and Draco began helping  his mother put the kitchen back in order while Andromeda disappeared upstairs with Teddy to get him through a bath before bed. After about ten minutes, however, Narcissa set down her wand and crossed her arms over her chest, raising an eyebrow at him. “Don’t you have somewhere you’re meant to be?”
it, actually. He felt calm and content—not New York content; a new kind of content that settled over him like a warm blanket. It felt
Draco smirked. “Not exactly. You’re the star, after all; only the best for our charming Bachelor. It’s still very nice, though, don’t worry.” He replaced the potion where he’d found it. “You have free reign of the grounds, more or less, as long as you stay out of the common areas we’ve designated for the contestants. You won’t have trouble avoiding them; they’ve all been warded, so you’ll feel it if you get too near. Otherwise, though, do what you’d like.”
Once he was fully seated, Harry wrapped his free arm around Draco’s torso, his hand resting over his heart and his forehead pressed against the back of his neck. Draco held onto his arm with one of his own, stretching the other back to grasp at the back of Harry’s head. “Come on,” he whispered, and Harry began to move.
“I…” Harry could hear his own uncertainty reflected back at him, but still, when Draco went on, he sounded resolute. “Yes.”
Draco went on, ignoring the interruption. “—and how you didn’t want to make a statement like that if we weren’t actually dating. So, let’s date. Then it won’t be a problem.”
“Likewise.” Jack winked at him before heading for the door, and Harry had to take a deep breath to ground himself, shaking his head to clear it.
Draco looked taken aback at the suggestion. “Oh! Well, I’m supposed to be available if the cast or crew need anything…”
“What kind of a boy do you think I am?” he asked teasingly. “I don’t put out on the first date. You said you wanted a relationship; you’re going to have to do better than a few glasses of expensive wine.”
“See you in the morning,” Draco echoed, quietly, knowing that Harry was already too far away to hear him. He blinked, only slightly surprised to feel that his own eyes were dangerously wet. Wiping them surreptitiously with his thumb, unintentionally mingling his own tears with Harry’s, he turned to look out the window himself, hoping to see whatever he had been pondering for so long. Aside from the light from a few windows in the distance, there was nothing.
“Nothing!” Harry rushed to reassure him. He took a couple of breaths, trying to clear his head enough to form a coherent sentence. “I’m just— if you wanted to do anything else you should tell me, because I’m...” he made a vague, embarrassed gesture.
“Thought you might have,” Harry sighed, running a hand through his hair. “None of you seemed surprised that he wasn’t here.”
“That was really lovely. Thank you,” Harry said sincerely as Dermot moved the guitar back to its place next to the couch.
“Draco?” Harry asked, turning, and Draco realized that he had not, of course, been able to see the nod. He nodded again, trying desperately to ignore the drag of Harry’s clothes against his own as he turned back. Salazar but this had been an awful idea. Sledding was a terrible, uncivilized activity and he should never have agreed to take part.
Harry felt his eyes go wide at the casual statement, his breath hitching slightly even as his heart soared. “What?”
Harry’s forehead hit the table once more. “I should’ve been an Auror,” he grumbled. “At least then I would’ve been allowed to hex people who bothered me.”
“It shouldn’t even be possible,” Draco said, almost to himself. “Everyone signed magically binding contracts saying that they wouldn't leave until they were eliminated. If someone tried to break theirs, an alarm should have gone off and they should have been hit by a temporary body bind so that we could sort things out.” Harry stared at Draco in horror, and Draco snapped back into focus, giving him an exasperated look. “Calm down, Potter; I just mean that there are legalities to deal with before releasing them. We’re not murdering anyone.”
“Besides,” Harry says, wrapping his arms around Draco’s neck and grinning mischievously. “I have an extremely rich boyfriend. He can just buy me a new one.”
Chris Costleigh was the oldest of Calpurnius’ children and had been involved in K&C since its inception. She had been the one to oversee the training of Draco and the cohort who had joined at the same time as him back in 1999, and she had moved to the UK to run the London office when it opened a few years later. She was a tall, straight-backed, no-nonsense woman who would have reminded Draco of a younger Minerva McGonagall had McGonagall decided to swap her robes for an impeccably tailored skirt suit and sensible heels. She’d been a wonderful mentor to Draco over the years, and he was pleased to see her.
“Wait, what?” Katie Bell, who had been largely silent throughout the ruckus, was looking at Harry in distress. “But, Harry, you
“Soon,” Harry promised, biting at the muscle where Draco’s neck met his shoulder. Pulling back, he grinned in a way that almost made Draco’s knees go out from under him. “I’ve got other things I want to do first.” He pushed Draco backward, and Draco surmised from the fact that he landed on a mattress that they must have Apparated not only into Harry’s flat, but directly into his bedroom. He tried to make a joke about Harry’s eagerness, but, much to his chagrin, all that came out was a desperate whimper.
The drain of travel was only one of several reasons that Draco tried to return to England as infrequently as possible. It was certainly the excuse he generally used with his mother—but in reality, it ranked below his other reasons: namely, that he hated the person he had been when he had lived here, and he was reasonably sure that the rest of the wizarding world did, as well. It had been eight years since the war, but Draco doubted that the name “Malfoy” had gotten any more popular in that time, even accounting for his father’s imprisonment and subsequent death and his mother’s endless charitable works.
In the hours between the disastrous date and the cocktail party, Harry took a nap, trying to sleep off the deluge of unwelcome memories he’d been assaulted with earlier. He woke feeling much more himself, ready to have a few drinks and enjoy a less stressful gathering with a group of people he really rather liked. Donning the pale grey suit that had been laid out for him, he waited for his summons to head downstairs.
We’re working our way through a lot of different bands and genres, trying to figure out what we like. That’s one thing we have in common, I guess—neither of us really had much opportunity to form our own tastes and opinions when we were younger. Not just on music, obviously, but music is easier to talk about than the rest.
Warning for general dating show shenanigans: lots of people touch Harry in this chapter in mildly-to-moderately suggestive ways, and he does not mind. HE’S TRYING TO FIND LOVE, OKAY?
Once again, Teddy made no purchases, but on the way out he pointed one more item out to Draco. “Look, it’s like when we went sledding, remember?” He was looking at a snowglobe that did, indeed, show a handful of tiny people repeatedly climbing up and sledding down a hill of sparkling snow. There was even a group of two bundled adults and a child riding a toboggan together, just as the three of them had.
Half an hour later, Harry stood in front of all fourteen of his contestants on a broad, grassy field, tiny shorts still in place. “Alright everyone, so today, we’re playing Ground Quidditch. Staying active is a big part of my life, so anyone who I’m going to start a life with needs to, at the very least, be up for a bit of casual running around on a nice day.” He looked around at the group, whose expressions ranged from excited to apprehensive to, in the case of William, disdainful. Romilda didn’t seem to be listening at all, instead staring intently at Harry’s shorts.
“Wow. I’ve been cooking since I was a kid; that’s hard to fit in my head.” He kicked himself mentally; bringing up his childhood and then being judgemental of his date all in one breath was not at all a good start.
“Barely worth mentioning,” Harry agreed. “Anyway, they eventually decided they cared more about the counterfeiter than my, erm… youthful escapades. So I was generously allowed to set up a horrifically uncomfortable hidden camp to do some surveillance, managed to get a few pictures of the culprit in the act, and tadah! Headline story and a load of DMLE employees who hate me for making them look incompetent. All in a day’s work.”
Draco rolled his eyes in such a familiar way that Harry felt himself immediately relax. “Potter, we’ve apparently been engaged in several years of prolonged and confusing foreplay. Don’t you think we’ve taken it slowly enough?”
cast, right? And like you said, I need a distraction. So really, it’s your job, if you think about it.”
Draco moved his hand from Harry’s chin, using it to push a few curls behind his ear. “I put in for a transfer. To the London office.” He paused, and, when Harry was silent, awkwardly went on, correcting himself. “Well, not a transfer, precisely. Technically, they offered me a slightly different job here, but—”
Harry’s face did something complicated and he stepped back, running a hand through his hair. “Right, that makes sense.” Draco suddenly felt an overwhelming need to apologize, but Harry snapped back to his cheerful self in the next instant, so he bit the words back. “Speaking of Teddy, he wants me to take him ice skating after dinner, do you want to come?”
Next to him, he could hear Potter panting. “Fucking christ,” he muttered, and Draco laughed breathlessly.
With the crowd back up to fifteen, Harry was having a bit of trouble staying on top of what was happening again. It didn’t take long for someone to convince him to get into the pool with them, but it seemed like mere minutes later that he was pulled away to another corner by someone else. There was an overwhelming amount of flesh on display, and Harry’s eyes flitted from Sullivan’s perfectly muscled chest to Sadiyah’s long, shapely legs to Rose’s previously hidden back, which sported a pair of beautiful tattooed butterfly wings. As the bubbles of his champagne tickled his tongue, he wondered how the hell there were so many beautiful wix who were interested in dating
Harry thinks, dazedly, that Grimmauld Place has a much smaller footprint than he would have imagined. Maybe there had been Wizarding space involved.
Harry almost told him ‘no’ by default, but then he thought back to his reactions to a couple of the contestants. “Yeah, actually. It’s been a lot of years, and we’ve all changed a lot since then, so I don’t want to think the worst, but back at Hogwarts, Romilda… erm… sort of tried to slip me a love potion hidden in a box of chocolates? Our sixth year?”
Draco looked tiredly around the holiday-hectic International Portkey Terminal at London’s Heathrow Airport and sighed. He hated traveling abroad in general, but he hated traveling in December even more. He couldn’t believe that he’d let his mother talk him into this. The terminal was completely packed with wix speaking any number of languages as they made their ways toward various holiday destinations. He’d already been jostled by at least three different busy parents trying to bustle recalcitrant children along, and he still had two hours of layover until his second trip. He considered simply apparating to Hogsmeade from here, but he hadn’t been to his mother’s new home yet, and anyway, he was exhausted by the first leg of his journey. Portkey travel from New York to London was both uncomfortable and extremely draining. Reluctantly, he looked around for a place to settle himself until his departure.
Despite his arousal, Draco glared down at him, making Harry laugh. “Oh please, you literally asked for that.”
“Get your head in the game, Malfoy!” Capulet yelled, glaring at him before quickly turning his attention back to preventing the Falcons from increasing their lead. “Find the fucking Snitch and end this thing!”
He registered a brief flash of surprise on Harry’s face, as though he had been expecting more resistance, but he moved forward without hesitation, cupping a hand behind Draco’s neck and capturing his lips.
“It did,” Draco agreed. “I hate to admit it, because I don’t want to enable my mother’s neuroses, but she does have a knack for throwing an event.”
He stopped as he reached land, covering his face in his hands. A moment later, a pair of arms wrapped around him, pulling him in against a warm, comfortingly familiar-smelling chest. “I’m so sorry,” Draco murmured against his hair. Unable to hold it in, Harry began to sob.
, I don’t fucking care if you believe me. I wouldn’t be marrying her either way. If you let them make that announcement at the game, you’ll only be embarrassing yourselves, because I certainly won’t be honoring a commitment I didn’t even make. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to get to the stadium.”
Blaise raised an eyebrow. “Well, isn’t that interesting? Do you think she suspected from the outset that things might develop a bit less...
Draco turned to her, intrigued. “Have you been finding a way for them to use email from school, then?”
They finished their breakfast, teasing and touching between bites of toast and sips of tea, and Draco contemplated how completely natural it felt. Last month, if someone had told him that he would be having an amiable morning-after breakfast with Harry Potter in a few weeks, he would have laughed in their face—and possibly given them the card for his old mind healer. Hell, if he’d been told he’d have this sort of pleasant, comfortable morning-after with
Ron, who had appeared at her shoulder, apparently curious about who was knocking at their door on Christmas day, took in his expression with interest. “He’s not here, mate,” he told him. “Took off after dinner.”
Draco leaned in and kissed Harry one more time. “Absolutely.” Stepping back, he slipped past him and down the stairs, where he pulled his apron back over his head and resumed his decorating, trying not to laugh at the fact that Teddy’s hands, shirt, and grinning face were now almost completely covered in a fine layer of glitter. He
When he’d showered and gone downstairs, he found that he had been press-ganged into writing party invitations for the morning. His hand twinged with phantom pains before he even started, but he resigned himself to his fate. It could be worse. He’d lived with Voldemort.
Once everyone had finished their meal, they all dispersed to change into their swimsuits. When Harry stepped outside in his trunks, he found Greg and Ron already leaning over the dials of the tub, looking between them and the guide. Before he reached them, lights went on underneath the surface and the water began to bubble and steam. The sun was just dipping under the horizon, and the flare of light stood out against the twilit sky. Harry thought it looked a bit like a particularly volatile potion coming to a boil.
After a minute or so of sorting pieces, Harry realized that he had no idea why Draco was here. “Did you come up for anything in particular, or just checking in?”
Draco was happy with his life in New York. He worked at a prestigious international wizarding financial services firm (Kashburn and Costleigh), and he was good at what he did. He got to wear sharp Muggle suits and talk to very rich people about “returns on investment” and “risk management” and “diversified portfolios.” He had a beautiful, modern flat on the Upper West Side and a string of beautiful, modern men to take with him to charity galas and industry cocktail parties. He had a favorite cafe and a favorite route through the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a favorite tailor in the wizarding district that made sure all of the aforementioned sharp Muggle suits fit him like a dream. It was, frankly, more than he had ever expected of his life when he had fled from the UK immediately after the war trials were concluded.
be a wine-induced dream and opting to just go with it. “Right,” he yawned, scooting further toward the sliding doors. “Come on, then.” He allowed his eyes to fall shut again and felt the mattress dip beside him. Still unsure if he was awake or not, and not entirely certain whether he hoped he was or wasn’t, he curled up on his side and listened to Draco’s breathing slow.
When he arrived at the office, he didn’t approach Potter right away. Instead, he made a point to put himself subtly in his eyeline whenever possible, posing in calculatedly casual ways that would highlight his best features — perching on the edge of the receptionist’s desk just so, bending over to collect the sheaf of parchment that he had oh-so-clumsily dropped right in front of Potter’s desk, stretching languidly in his chair with an artificial yawn, arching his back and tipping his head back to highlight the length of his throat. Finally, as the day neared its end, he made his move.
“I can— Ow, stop, I’m fine!” Harry pried himself out of Draco’s grasp, his shin smarting where it had hit the edge of one of the seats. Carefully, he levered himself out of the hot water, shivering and sitting on the side to hide the fact that he thought he might pass out if he stood up. “What’s going on? Am I late?”
Harry gasped and straightened, shocked upright by the sudden cold. Around him, there were shrieks of dismay.
Harry shrugged and gave him a wry smile. “I guess. I mean, it’s not like it can be worse than this one, right?”
, he sighed inwardly. Then, with a jolt, he noticed that Harry’s name was not listed alone, but rather with a clearly written ‘and guest.’ An uncomfortable sinking feeling settled itself in his stomach. Skimming the list again, he saw that all of the solo names—including Pansy and Blaise—had the same addendum. Somehow, that didn’t make him feel any better.
Draco had apparated back to the house on his own, as Teddy was once again spending the night at Harry’s. He’d parted ways with them as quickly as he could manage, saying nothing but a brief “bye, then” before disappearing. Now it was morning, and he was hiding.
She looked at him, and her face was openly sympathetic. “Let us know if you need anything.” Snapping her face back to its usual bored-but-annoyed expression, she added, “Now shoo; not all of us are done for the day.”
He stayed on the couch, curled into himself, for a length of time that he didn’t see any real point in quantifying. He was alone, after all, and he had the whole night ahead of him. His external stillness was a stark contrast to the turmoil going on inside of him as he struggled to process what Sadiah had said; her complete certainty about how Harry felt. He knew that he struggled to identify his own emotions, but he couldn’t have missed something as big as having fallen in love with Draco Malfoy, could he?
“Well, why not?” Draco asked, warming up to the idea. “Our relationship has been many things, Potter, but it’s certainly never been boring. And we’d make quite the picture together. It’d be fun.”
“Alright everyone, take a piece, go on!” Harry and Perry joined everyone, hesitantly popping their pieces into their mouths. Unsurprisingly, based on their appearance, Harry found them quite dry—they were almost more like a scone than a muffin. Nancy chewed thoughtfully. “Not a bad effort,” she said when she’d swallowed. “Perhaps a tad overcooked, and you seem to have either used a tad too little liquid or a bit too much flour. But overall, very good for a first try!” Jane looked relieved, and Kevin seemed rather pleased; they obviously hadn’t been expecting positive feedback.
Harry quirked a lopsided smile at her. “Probably for the best, honestly. I have a few friends who aren’t all that interested in Quidditch, and the rest of us drive them barmy when the season gets going. Although, I suppose Hermione appreciates it when we actually play and get Ron out of the house for a while; she can barely ever get one-on-one time with Rose, otherwise. He’s pretty enthusiastic about the whole fatherhood thing.”
“Witches, wizards, and wix, welcome to a very special live episode of ‘The Bachelor: Wizarding Edition’, where, three months after the filming of our epic finale, we finally get to check in with our Bachelor, his beau, and our contestants to ask: ‘Where are they now?’ First, please join me in welcoming some old friends.”
“What are you hoping to get out of these dates, specifically? Are there certain things you’ll be looking for to gauge whether any of your remaining competitors might be the one?”
Draco gave him an unimpressed look. “Are you really going to try to blame her poor behavior on yourself?”
“None of our business, Potter. The point is, there’s no audio or video recording outside the main room. Can we move on, please? Now, the cabin is off in the woods at the end of the grounds to avoid distractions—”
“No, don’t—” Nathalie cried, reaching out with one arm, but Harry was already skimming the contents. There were notes on all of the contestants, as well as snippets of conversations that Harry had had with various people and a few unflattering musings on their conversation the first night at the house. His stomach felt like lead as he looked back up at her.
“Yeah, no shit,” Dermot muttered, just loudly enough for Harry to hear him. He frowned, but Luna either hadn’t heard or didn’t care, because she continued blithely on.
The day dragged on interminably, but finally five o’clock rolled around and Draco was able to escape for home. He took a long bath to ease the tension from his muscles, rolling his eyes at himself. When had he gone from smooth and in control to basically gagging for it? It was mortifying, but he hadn’t wanted anyone like he wanted Harry in quite some time. So, whatever, he supposed. Pride was overrated.
Special thanks to EvAEleanor for pointing out a timeline error that would have driven me crazy if I'd caught it after this went live!
He could tell that there was a good deal of shouting going on, but he was only vaguely aware of it as he tried to regain his bearings and steer himself groundward through the white-hot pain. He managed, if just barely, but immediately collapsed as his left foot hit the ground and the impact shot agonizingly up what he was now quite certain was a broken leg. His team and the referee appeared around him, shouting mixed words of praise and concern. Luna pushed calmly through the crowd and knelt beside him before casting a series of spells.
“Well, no, not completely. The main room of the cabin has cameras, but they’re free-floating, so there won’t be crew getting in your way. It’s only the bedroom and bathroom that don’t; they have privacy spells around them, so if you have anything you want to talk about or… do… without an audience, you can go in there. We don’t actually want to hear your sex noises.”
“Pansy, Blaise,” he nodded. “Hey, Draco. I’m glad you’re here! I should have mentioned it yesterday but I completely forgot it was even happening until Ginny showed up at my workshop and practically dragged me out by my hair.”
When everyone was once again seated, Luna gestured for Harry to step back onto the podium once more. He removed his robe again, realizing, as he did so, that he was feeling much less self conscious than he had been. Luna had him sit on the chair, propping one foot up on the apple crate. She directed him to place one hand on his thigh and rest the other forearm on his raised knee. Once she had him settled in a way that she approved of, she used her wand to make several marks on the floor and crate to indicate his position, explaining to him that they would break every twenty minutes to let him stretch out and give the artists a break.
Harry’s first two solo dates don’t go as planned—largely because one of them doesn’t show up. Featuring a distillery trip, a baking class, and an extremely petty Draco Malfoy.
Perry looked sheepish. “Well, growing up, we always had house… erm, help,” he caught himself. They’d been warned to try to stick to Muggle-safe language, and Harry couldn’t help but wonder why on earth Draco and Pansy had thought that one of the only pureblood contestants was a good choice for this particular venue. “And these days I mostly live on toast, takeaway, and terrible food from the hospital canteen.”
“I like the foam; it makes it feel special for some reason,” Harry said sheepishly. “But honestly, I’m also completely dependent on the caffeine these days. Pre-holiday is my busiest time of year.”
He’s just… here, a lot. And a big part of Teddy’s life. And it’s not like it could lead anywhere, so it would just make everything awkward.”
And if Harry noticed that Malfoy had grown into himself in an extremely physically appealing way, that was really just an objective observation. And sure, okay, they spent quite a bit of time together these days, often just the two of them. And
Finally, they reached the front of the queue. The bouncer checked their wands, spelled a wristband onto each of them, and waved them in, looking bored all the while.
“Really?” Draco squinted. “I don’t see it. Although it’s hard to picture Trelawney without those glasses.”
He had a half-plan in the back of his mind that involved luring Draco into a false sense of security before grabbing him around the waist and launching them both into the water. His face would be hilarious, Harry thought, grinning to himself. It definitely didn’t have anything to do with what that white shirt would look like soaked through, transparent and clinging.  Nor did it have anything to do with the possibility of Draco giving up and stripping off his wet clothes altogether.
“Luna sent me to warn you about the nargles,” he said, stepping up so that he was shoulder to shoulder with Harry.
As the exhibition wound through time, the drawings and handwritten notes slowly morphed into moving photographs and rough typeset. Harry was particularly taken with a larger than life portrait from the 1800s of a handsome, straight-backed witch in trousers and a bowler hat who was chewing on a pipe and glaring challengingly down at them.
A chorus of agreement (albeit with various levels of enthusiasm) came from the rest of the scattered group, and Hermione let out a relieved-sounding breath.
