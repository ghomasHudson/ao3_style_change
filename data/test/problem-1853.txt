"The organization is said to be called the HPA. Some Aurors heard Dunne muttering it in her cell, probably in her sleep."
The waiter showed no surprise and slipped away quietly, closing the door behind him.
"I'm going to put him to bed. Can I come back after, or do you need to be alone?"
"Ready?" asked Harry, looking at him in the stairwell.
Draco didn't know if he felt euphoric or terrified. He wanted to see his son. To smile at him. To hold him in his arms. He was terrified of not being there for him. To stand still, useless, unable to reassure him, to take care of him. "Papa?"
He should never have returned to England.
"You want Harry to be your Dom."
wrote Draco in his notebook with a little sniffle, his handwriting a mess.
"I don't want you to feel guilty," Draco said gently. "It's not your fault, nor mine. But we were naive to think it could work. I don't want a Romeo and Juliet ending, stupid misunderstandings that lead to the worst. I'd rather we be friends than put our lives and our relationship in danger, under the fire of others."
"I wanted to... I had to tell you that I like you."
He invited Harry to come forward. The club was dimly lit. Red neon lights ran along the walls and ceiling. Harry almost passed the cloakroom without stopping, but finally left his shirt, which magically stowed away in a small cubicle with a clink. He was rather proud of his upper body. The corridor lined with thick black curtains led to a large round room, which looked like a circus tent. In the middle, a round stage levitated and turned slowly on itself. All around were leather and velvet sofas and armchairs, where small groups of people were seated, looking perfectly comfortable despite their rather bare outfits. The place was completely packed, so much so that Harry could hardly hear the music. Acquaintances were hailing each other, lovers kissed intensely. Harry didn't dare venture into the large corridor on the other side of the room, which seemed to lead to many smaller spaces.
"Hi, Thomas."
"She died shortly after he was born."
"What do you mean, pet?"
Draco obviously hadn't managed to deflect the conversation quickly enough. His emotion showed on his face enough for Harry to notice.
He didn't know what Draco had been reflecting on all this time. He knew he blamed his parents for a lot of things, and he knew how he felt about the Manor - it was often, very often the place of his nightmares, and it was still his safeword too. But the prospect of Lucius' impending death had apparently carried some weight.
"You don't have to. But if you want to tell me, I'd like to know."
"Come in, please."
Draco leaned against Harry's back and put his arms around his waist, looking over his shoulder at their son. His gesture said 'it's all right'. It said 'I understand'. It said 'take the time you need'.
Draco nodded. He stood up. "Goodbye, Potter. Happy birthday to you." He smiled at him very sweetly, but his eyes still looked vulnerable and raw.
"Finish your sentence, slave. I expect the utmost politeness from you, you know that."
Harry would never have believed that he would lie voluntarily. Protecting someone by turning against the entire system he believed in. Objectively, Draco had broken the Statute of Secrecy. But Harry Potter would be damned before he left his man locked up, convicted, slandered. No matter how unfair, how undignified, how selfish. Harry couldn't let the wizarding world turn against Draco again. Least of all for something that Draco believed in, that Harry believed in, that had done so much good for the world, least of all for Sectumsempra. It was one of the best things Draco had ever accomplished. He wouldn't go to jail because something had gone wrong.
Draco pushed his breakfast trolley away. Harry was handsome as hell, even worried, even embarrassed, even scared of Draco, even tired, even as fucking protective.
"Low complexity variants and not extremely evil, but yeah, definitely not classic magic." So maybe the suspect was a former member of Voldemort's crew? Or a professional hired by someone who wanted to harm Draco?
In fact, Harry's respite was short-lived, because in the middle of the meal, he hardened again at Draco's discreet caresses and the way he sensually moved his body, his hands, his mouth. Harry wasn't imagining it - Callum's pupils were dilated too.
The day Harry realised he was in love with Draco Malfoy, they had been dating for less than three weeks. They'd had dinner with Callum, Benjamin and Thomas in the gay district, at a pretentious but genuinely good arty restaurant. They'd all had a bit too much to drink, due to Callum's propensity to buy bottles and bottles of champagne when he was in a good mood.
. He'd almost gotten himself killed. Left Scorpius in a world that would murder him at the first favourable opportunity for bearing the Malfoy name. His son needed him. His son needed his undivided attention. And to hell with what Draco's heart and ass wanted.
"No one is going to kick you out, Mr Potter. As long as you're quiet, your presence won't hurt him. As a professional, I can only recommend that you go home and rest properly, but I know it's not that simple in reality."
"You should have said, "Okay, Draco, thanks for telling me that, good luck, goodbye!". How could it work between us with this?"
"Shh. I know the feeling. You don't think you're worthy of the admiration that some people have for you. You're going to have to get used to it, because when people start to see you as a good person, they convince others and it's hard to get rid of your reputation as a nice person afterwards. Horrible, huh?"
The clerk returned, the little ball of fur in the crook of his elbow.
Before he could find out, the door opened again.
Harry made an uncomprehending expression.
"Of course I'm serious."
"I had nothing, after the war. But when I started the business, I... found a way to get my own capital."
Somehow Harry had managed to come up with an assumption so implausible that Draco's surprise managed to overpower his terror at finally having this conversation after years.
"Oh, sorry. Am I splitting you open? Does it hurt?"
"Callum's boyfriend is going to poison me in my sleep if I keep monopolising him without warning whenever I feel like it," he said lightly.
Knowing this for sure was like being a hundred pounds lighter.
So Molly wasn't much surprised or bothered when there was a knock on her door that night.
"Right. Good morning, Auror office, camp of good, love and peace. I, my friendly family name and my friendly Dark Mark would like to come and complain that grief-stricken families still dare to hate me for the genocidal ideology I have embraced. What nerve on their part."
Potter and Callum kissed for a long, intense time, arousing Draco's desire at first, then his anger when he realised they were taking their time on purpose to frustrate him. Callum's big hard cock rubbed against Draco's. He hoped to recall his existence by grasping Potter's with one hand and Callum's with the other. They grunted into the kiss as he began to slowly jerk them off under the water. Draco's vision was blurry. He was in a hot tub with the two men who turned him on the most in the world.
"About half an hour ago? I came by to rescue you from your hangover, and I'm just getting out of the shower. Hello, Harry."
Their magics sought each other before their bodies. Their respective auras formed invisible spheres around them, and once they were close enough, the spheres crossed. A shiver ran down Harry's back, from his neck to his waist. The man was powerful. Amused, Harry gave his usually restrained magic a little more leeway and it crackled happily through the air. A moment later he felt muscular arms around him, one at his abdomen, one at his collarbones. The man's body was warm on his back. He immediately settled into the rhythm of Harry's dance. He was clean-shaven, the skin of his cheek cool and smooth against Harry's as he leaned in to speak in his ear.
"You must get lonely," said Ginny. "With the potions, and the side effects, and the waiting, and the pregnancy test every morning." She remembered the spell by heart. She remembered the coldness of the bathroom tile under her feet as she cast it, day after day. Negative. Negative. Negative. Even a month was a long time if you did that. Thirty-one "negatives" floating in the air. More, if, like her, he sometimes double-checked.
"Blink twice if I hurt you."
"I'm not going to tell you that you have to forgive him or any of that crap," Harry said softly. "I'm well aware of what kind of person he is. But I think he really cares about you and Scorpius. It would be... nice, I suppose, to come by the Manor a few times before... He'd feel like he'd succeeded in his quest, right? His reason for living. To have descendants."
"Mm-mh. But the bad guys at the Transnational Product Regulation don't want them to import it into England, because it contains the essence of a plant that's protected here, even if it's not protected in Germany where the potion is made, and..." His voice gradually faded as they walked away. Draco smiled and went back to sleep, the reassuring warmth of Salem beside him.
"70346559 ?"
"Harry Otter?"
"You're lucky I'm completely drunk."
Harry was looking forward to walking around the little town, but the next part of the programme was even better, and a surprise for Draco too: Krzysztof joined them in the little restaurant.
"I don't blame her for that anymore," Harry assured, and he meant it.
"What a night, that'll be the fifth. Where did he find you?" the boss asked Harry, amused, sizing him up.
Blaise and Pansy named their son Nino. An Italian name, in homage to the heavenly summer when he had finally been conceived.
Draco waited for him to do so, slumping against the counter with his head in his arms.
Draco didn't say it often. Since the first time in Rome, it had sort of slipped out a handful of times, once during an orgasm, once while falling asleep against Harry in their bed, once in a cinema lobby when Harry had agreed to see the horror film Draco wanted to see rather than the thriller Harry'd been waiting for since the trailer came out several months ago, once when they were snuggled up in the green velvet armchair in his living room, Draco reading a scientific journal of current research in alchemy and Harry preparing files for the next day. Harry remembered those five moments as if he were reliving them in his mind.
Draco passed out.
Harry had remembered that Draco missed Italy, especially in the autumn when there were fewer tourists and it was less hot. Harry had never been there, and in a few seconds Draco thought of a dozen places he absolutely had to show him.
Harry fucked Blaise against one of the pillars of the bed. The standing position made him go even deeper into Blaise's channel, and the man screamed when Harry found the perfect angle to push against his prostate, partly from pleasure and partly from the unprecedented depth with which Harry was allowing himself to penetrate him.
Harry pressed his lips together and let his magic surround Malfoy, rumbling and disgruntled. He hoped to throw Malfoy off balance, to remind him that last night Harry had been his whole world. But Malfoy smiled defiantly, not fazed in the least.
Scorpius fell asleep. Harry sat on the edge of the bed, close by in case Scorpius rolled over in his sleep. He ran his fingers through Draco's hair. Draco sighed softly. Harry was looking forward to taking him home.
Harry roared and lifted him off the ground in his excitement. Before he tore off Draco's clothes and made love to him in front of half the Quidditch fans in Europe, Draco slipped away to order champagne.
Harry gradually came out of their bubble, enough to notice Thomas, untied and sitting on the second metal table in a bathrobe, watching them intently. Callum was in a similar position, now completely naked and with his huge dick flaccid, and jumped off the table to undo the intricate Shibari on Draco's legs. "Thank you," breathed Harry.
"You're allowed to say your Daddy is Head Auror," Harry pointed out with a smirk. Draco elbowed him. They agreed that Scorpius wasn't ever going to be the kind of spoiled brat that said his father would hear about this.
"Harry?" asked Draco again, pulling him out of his thoughts.
"Yeah? You're coming?"
"Yes, very much."
"It wasn't just a matter of money. He turned in every last Death Eater and Voldemort ally. Their Manor had old spells recording anyone who stepped foot in it and even conversations, I believe, and Lucius managed to provide evidence for almost all of the suspects. The Wizenmagot could have kissed his feet back then."
"There are no spring rolls." Harry was surprised.
"No more 'Sir' for today," Harry said, halfway between command and plea. His cock was so sore.
"Yes. It's not very surprising. When I see the fuss it makes when one of us three goes out in public in a magical place, when the paparazzi know all about our lives and have nothing to talk about anymore, I can't imagine what a Malfoy outing to Diagon Alley would look like. The ex-Death Eater back in England, widowed, with a baby? That would sell papers. He must be hiding among the Muggles."
"So I'm allowed to follow my every wish?"
Harry wasn't going to lie to himself, learning that diminished his interest in the man. Orion had been so fresh, so amusing, so charming, that Harry had let himself think he'd want to see him again, even before he'd... well... seen him in action. The faded Dark Mark had cooled him down in that respect.
"It could also be reflex movements of his body, but since it happened when his son was first here, the doctors think it means he's regaining consciousness, yes." Harry gave him an ecstatic smile. He'd been on cloud nine since the night before. A fucking Christmas miracle.
"Ah... wait."
"Come on, serve the booze to you privileged men instead while I try to persuade myself that I can forget about the state of my legs, organs, breasts and back by getting drunk on fruit juice."
Thanks to the amazing people who took the time to comment on the last few chapters. If anyone would like to discuss the story in the comments, I'd love to.
"Who...?"
May 2008 - Draco and Harry Potter-Malfoy's wizarding house, St. Louis Hill, London
"Voldemort, whom Lucius Malfoy served."
Ron looked at his unarmed right hand, and used it to punch Harry in the face.
"Up to you to guess, Gryffindor."
"I'll tell you about ‘the illegal thing’. I want to tell you. Tonight, okay? When my son is in bed?"
He reached out to Draco and helped him onto one of the two rolling metal tables, on his back. He attached ropes to rings on the ceiling and took his time, making a beautiful Shibari cordage that held both of Draco's legs in the air, spread wide. Draco let himself go in silence, occasionally sighing with pleasure, perfectly still. Callum tickled him when he checked that the rope wasn't too tight, and smiled fondly at Draco when he couldn't help but laugh and fidget. Then he moved to his arms, which he tied above his head. "Come here, Leo." Callum let Harry tie one arm while he did the other in mirror image, occasionally giving him a tip, checking his work. Draco contorted himself so he could watch them work. When Callum gave Harry's handiwork a final check and deemed it perfect, Draco smiled at them. A magical, sparkling smile that made both Doms waver. Harry nibbled on Draco's pierced earlobe.
The prospect did not seem to displease Harry. Draco allowed himself to be stroked, naked and satisfied, and finally said: "Listen to me, Potter, because I'm probably not going to say it again any time soon. I've been
"Three and a half months."
"Bearded faces are more kissable," Thomas helped him.
"Here, we don't discriminate between children of criminals and Death Eaters, and children of victims and Aurors. That was one of the principles of this place from the very beginning, to allow them to live together, to get to know each other, to break down any prejudices of the two camps and to make it easier for them to live together at Hogwarts, and in the wizarding community in general. The problem was that this did not work for some of the children from Voldemort's camp. Before and during their stay at Hogwarts, the teams tried to reach out to them... But after 17, some of them still have their prejudices. We'd rather not let them leave the orphanage while they're still... confused."
Papa smiled and ran his thumb over Scorpius' forehead as if wiping something off. "What did you paint?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Orion," the blond man introduced himself.
"Does my love for you show on my face that much?" asked Draco to Harry as soon as they had left. "Am I looking at you like one of your groupies? Tell me I don't look at you like one of your groupies."
"But it's very bad for the lungs, Harry," he said quietly, taking a drag on his pipe. It was made of dark, polished wood, with gold bands.
"Deal," laughed Harry.
Harry began to sweat in earnest as Malfoy, handsome as a god, cheeks wet, began to beg for mercy. His Dom showed him none. He asked him several times if he wanted to use his safeword, but Malfoy always replied "no". The Dom was amused by the little manoeuvre, which Malfoy repeated several times. He smiled affectionately, called his sub a "drama queen" and continued.
"Scorpius was always a peculiar baby. He didn't always react the way you'd expect.Shortly after Astoria was gone, he started having fevers for no reason, crying excessively, not feeling well. The doctors I called in diagnosed him with an allergy to magic. This means that if he is exposed to too much magic as a child, he will not be able to develop his own. He can't stand magical objects, spells, or even the mere presence of wizards near him. His magic won't die at the slightest exposure, but let's say his tolerance is limited, finite, he only has a little bit for his entire childhood. That's why I live in a Muggle house, entirely furnished in a Muggle way, with no magical objects, no owls. That's why I can't present him to my friends, or my family."
Immediately the mood changed, the game peeled off like over-dried paint. Harry backed away and put a hand on his back, Callum encouraged him to breathe properly. When Draco had managed to do so, and took a sip of water from the one bottle that had miraculously not yet fallen to the ground due to their frenzy, he said, "I think this calls for a change of scene," Callum laughed, helping him out of the hot tub. Draco's legs were shaking from his excitement and severe fucking. He dried himself with a stream of magic.
It was the first time Harry experienced this. He was shaking on the corridor carpet to the point where his teeth were chattering. The pleasure was everywhere. He thrust his hips forward, filling Draco's throat, who seemed neither surprised nor hurt and sucked him all the more hungrily. "Draco. Draco. Draco."
Harry had never thought about it so bluntly. He took what he could get, with Draco. Draco had assured him that despite his status and his sadness that his son had no mother figure, he never intended to marry again. Pragmatically, this also meant that Draco would not have any more children. But Harry... Harry was bi. He could be in a relationship with a woman. If he wasn't 100% infertile, if he took medication, tried IVF... Maybe he had a small chance of having one, or even more children. It was a possible future. A future he didn't think about, too absorbed in Draco.
Harry thought that was normal, to say the least. It was the least they could do. The sentence sounded strange to him, but he let the doctor go without questioning her further - Draco needed her more than he did.
"Oh, please don't judge me," sighed Harry. "You got there before me, apparently."
"Merlin. You would. You'd run away with me."
"What about you?"
"I don't know, Jacob. If he went into the building, he's fine. If he was on the street..."
"I just... You're making me look like the bad guy. Even my mother talked about it, you know? I heard it. She said that you seemed so happy with him, and so relaxed, and in a good mood, and fucking
Draco turned around. Benjamin was smiling broadly at Callum, blushing a little. Ah, men in love.
"Good evening, Mr. Healey. It'll be the Kensigton Suite, on the thirteenth floor."
Draco smiled a tiny bit wider.
"You're right, sir. I'm sorry for my behavior. I want to make amends. Please, sir."
"Nothing special. I just ran into him last weekend with his baby, and I was thinking about it again."
Draco unveiled his silver irises, and it was Harry's turn to inhale sharply. In the night, in the white room, in his white outfit, his platinum hair and moon eyes shone like those of a divine and dangerous creature, who would lure innocent men to their doom. Draco's pupils widened as Harry held his gaze.
"Draco, I... I feel you inside me. Your magic. It's... I love it. I keep casting useless spells just to feel it flowing through me. It plays with mine. It's amazing."
"At least until your father's generation," grumbled a boy. "Okay, you had Scorpius with Astoria Greengrass, but the way you run your business..." He shook his head, clearly disgusted, glancing down at his muggle clothes.
Draco couldn't get hard with the cage, but he sighed with pleasure, somewhere between a moan and a mewl, with each thrust until Harry filled him with hot cum and trapped it inside him by putting the plug back in.
"Are they – are they together?"
Harry said nothing more. He didn't even tell him how much his grandson had inherited the Malfoy traits. He didn't want to say anything that Draco wouldn't have wanted.
Finally, behind the criticism of the press, of hypocrisy, of the so-called vigilantes in reality pathetic, all of this was a long declaration of love to Draco, in filigree. It was about forgiveness, not as a kind of charity, but as the least of moral decency. It was about serenity and safety, the two things Draco probably felt he had least and wanted most. It was about building a country on reliable institutions and respect, a country that was safe and loving for the younger generation, where a small child would no longer have to fear being put in Slytherin or being punished for the faults of their parents. Punishing a child for having parents who practiced dark magic was like punishing a Muggle-born for the magical status of his parents: despicable, destructive to the entire country, and a sign of very low intelligence.
Harry pulled him on the floor to his knees. Draco smiled as he realised Harry wasn't planning to feed him anything but his cock, and gladly accepted the intrusion of the massive penis into his mouth and throat. He sucked enthusiastically when Harry wasn't fucking his throat, and took care that Harry's head was not at the back of his throat but on his tongue when he came, so that he could taste his cum and swallow it like a starving man.
"You're greedy," Harry commented with satisfaction. Draco was simply perfect. Harry leaned in to kiss him and felt the sourness of his cum in his mouth. "Sit in the chair in front of me. Help yourself to everything as you like."
"The accused?"
"It burns. It's a bit like a candle flame that you'd leave against my skin."
"You said it was urgent?" Draco asked, clearly anxious.
"No, I'm alone."
Harry had assumed it was a trivial rich person's problem - issues with his parents, a lack of meaning or thrill in his life - but he was discovering Blaise to be less shallow than he had imagined.
"And by faking her death..."
"Hello, Potter."
Draco crawled out from under Harry and left the bed. Harry looked lovingly at his naked, tired, sweaty body, the purple marks on his hips and ass. Draco reached behind a picture frame, and it opened sideways like a small door. There was a safe inside the wall. The wizard was about to type in the code, but he paused and turned around.
Harry stood up. He brought the belt down again, on the untouched side of Draco's back. Draco's body tensed, and he made a faint sound of pain. Harry couldn't quite understand how his pain could turn him on, but it was the most erotic scene he had ever experienced. Perhaps his surrender? His trust? The magnificence of his taut body, the deliciously contracted muscles? Perhaps, too, Draco lying there, vulnerable, offered, but resisting his instincts, unmoving, unguarded, defenseless. He was putting himself in Harry's hands, offering him his pleasure and his pain.
Draco felt acceptably strong. He made an L with his index finger and thumb. "He's allowing you to use Legilimency to talk with him," Harry explained the code.
"Oh, the New Year's Eve foam party in 2001..." Blaise's eyes lit up. "First time I've slept with Muggles in my life. I didn't tell you this at the time, but I'd had three before you."
Harry kissed Blaise. The wizard wrapped long muscular arms around him and grabbed his arse. Harry was already hard. Their sexes rubbed through their clothes, making them grunt.
And, with Orion's voice but in an intonation Harry would have recognised among a thousand, he said:
"Of course. See you later."
"After that spell, Draco summoned flames wandlessly. I mean, it was even worse than wandless, it was practically accidental magic. Lots of power, little control. That will work in his favour at the trial. He was obviously completely panicked, in fact he burned himself in the process." Harry nodded grimly. The burns had been easily treated by the doctors, but Harry feared the impact they would have on Draco's mind. "The flames caused passers-by to come. Dunne panicked and cast the shredding spell on his stomach. A dirty one, black magic too. Draco must have lost consciousness instantly from the pain."
Harry whipped him again, watching with fascination the intensity of his subspace, the intensity of his pleasure, the intensity of his desire. He knew that he would unfortunately have to heal him completely afterwards - they spent too much time half-naked on the beach to allow themselves whip marks and finger marks and teeth marks - so he allowed himself to go a tiny bit beyond their usual limits, as Draco was literally delirious with ecstasy and perfect abandon.
In truth, Harry would have gladly invited his entire adopted family. But would the Weasleys find that pretentious? Or would they understand that Harry just wanted to be able to enjoy himself like a normal person without being stared at, without being approached, without his scars being stared at? Anyway, the main problem was that they didn't know about Draco.
"I'm not alone this morning," Harry announced.
Harry smiled at him, praying he wouldn't cry. He opened the ring case.
"I think he's really asleep, this..."
"You're tired all the time." Oh, that, between nights of fucking Draco Malfoy and nights of dreaming about fucking Draco Malfoy... "Ron heard you asked for days off, and you're not volunteering for missions anymore, and you're coming home early." To fuck Draco Malfoy. "You don't drop by anymore, you haven't been to the Burrow for several weekends..." Probably because he was in BDSM nightclubs learning as many techniques as possible to satisfy Draco Malfoy in bed. "You used to tell us, when it was really bad... Now you don't even let us know..."
"Did the birth go well?"
"It's a boy. Scorpius."
"Are you sleep deprived too?" replied Draco gently as he directed Harry's hair under the cascading water jet. They'd been fucking so much in the evenings, at night, in the early hours of the morning over the last few days that Draco sometimes slept with his eyes open in the office.
Draco wanted to reply that he didn't know. Harry hadn't even wanted them here, apparently. But one needed courage, sometimes. And he didn't want to say anything about Harry to her that might have amounted to criticism.
"He's not magical. And no, even with a name, he couldn't have come."
"I decided to be rational," replied Harry, who seemed pleased with Draco's good humour. "We're rich. Objectively. I want our money to be used to protect you and give you as much free time and rest as possible. If you disagree with the hiring, I'll do the chores myself. But the housekeeper seemed like a good idea."
"I can't do this."
On the desk, Draco discovered a red box. The card only said 'Congratulations on the interview' in a handwriting he didn't recognize. He untied the bow of the gift and discovered a white silk shirt, embroidered with small grey snakes. The name of the luxury brand gave him an idea of the value of the gift.
Harry looked at him with all the intensity in his eyes. He wasn't wearing his glasses. Draco was overcome with green. "You are my husband. Scorpius is my son. If we have to end our lives in a hideout on a deserted island, I'll do it. You're not going to jail because you had the courage to start an innovative company and work for Muggle/Wizard cooperation."
Or was something happening?
And he took his collar off Draco. Harry watched in horror as tears formed in Draco's eyes.
"You lost me," said Harry.
"Not having fun, baby boy? Don't you like it when I take care of you?"
"Why? It's his child inside you, I had nothing to do with it."
"What's the matter?"
Scorpius burst out laughing. He rested his little hands on his Papa's cheeks. He had a short, soft beard. Scorpius gently ran a finger over his moustache, laughing at its texture, and Papa pretended to eat his finger, doubling his laughter.
"Where did your initial investment come from?"
18 January 2007 - Top floor of St Mungo's, London
She looked up from her computer. "Right. I sent him a copy. Professionally. I figured he'd be interested in a collaboration between Sectumsempra and the Aurors if he learned a bit more about the company."
"I don't have much Muggle blood in my family tree, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the bloodline in question has a fortune. I wasn't a Malfoy or a Parkinson, and I was surrounded by children of wealthy, noble and influential families in my House. I was foolishly trying to play up my assets. But I'm not a supremacist anymore, you can relax."
"I'm sorry."
? Then he saw the sober colours of the room, the forest paintings on the walls. Outside, the sky was cloudy. Draco looked down at his own body. The angle was strange, but without doubt, it was hideous. As he had feared, his new wounds were on his already badly mutilated lower belly, as if the previous scars had not been enough.He had lost weight, and his skin looked flabby on a now less voluminous body, like a deflated balloon. Damn. The whore had really taken everything from him.
"You're sure? "
"I'll have to change the nameplate on my desk, mind you. Potter-Malfoy."
That knowledge filled Draco with calm.
"I wondered about that before I brought you in. Hopefully, since you haven't burned out yet, you'll be fine."
Harry sighed in relief, hiding his face in his hands.
Albus whined and cried, his eyes still closed. Draco deftly turned him onto his stomach at a 45 degree angle, holding his chest and chin with one hand, his little bottom with the other. The technique was tried and tested in the Malfoy household. The baby stopped crying at once.
After his orgasm, Draco fell backwards until his back connected with the ground. He heard Potter emerge from the water and then watched as he appeared, waist wrapped in a conjured towel, in his field of vision.
Harry made franker movements with his hand, fucking Draco with his fist. Lube was dripping all over his legs, Harry's arm and the bathroom tiles. Draco's grunting didn't stop, a long continuous moan, until he came. When he had no more air in his lungs he fell silent, but he was shaking with spasms. A clear liquid ran down his penis.
There were several Aurors outside the cells, as if they had been waiting for him. Ron was one of them, but Harry had disarmed him before he even recognized him. "Let me through," Harry spat. "I've got questions to ask, too. I'm practically the Head Auror, aren't I?" Ron was wandless. Harry didn't expect him to fight back.
"He nearly killed me, Mione. He poisoned me. He attacked you so many times. I have a right to be angry with him. "
Harry collapsed before he realised it. His legs had given way beneath him. Fortunately, his best friend had Auror-like reflexes and kept him from falling face first. "Sorry. I'm a bit... tired, at the moment."
They talked about their children, and their unborn children.
"Good luck with that. We made fools of ourselves with the little Voldemort escapade. We're literally being spat on in old wizarding family circles abroad."
They stayed that way. Harry fell asleep.
Harry joined Draco on the sofa. He touched his hair, his skin.
"Callum has a
Callum accepted one of the cases from the Dom, a muscular Asian man with long hair in a bun. He opened it, revealing a large set of small coloured vials. He immediately pushed aside four or five of them and placed them on the table, then accepted the brush the Dom - Adrian, Harry remembered - handed him. Callum dipped it into several vials in succession and applied the mixture, which simply looked like paint, to the inside of his own elbow. He made small, hesitant faces, pushed some of the vials aside again and finally handed the case with his selection to Adrian.
Harry remembered, the dizziness beginning to seriously intensify, Draco confessing to him that Astoria was alive. He remembered something that had stuck in his mind. Draco and Astoria had spoken at length about what they wanted to do about the pregnancy, Draco said. Astoria didn't particularly want to keep the child; she didn't want a child. But if it wasn't for the explicit and agreed-upon purpose of producing an heir, why would Draco and Astoria ever have slept together? Draco did not like women. Even on heroin, even drunk as a skunk, he would never touch a woman. It was on the short list of sexual things he refused. He'd been gently mocking Harry's ability to desire a woman for two years. Draco and Astoria had no reason in the world to sleep together. And for the same reasons of Draco's pronounced sexual orientation, there was no way Scorpius could have been conceived by Draco and another woman who wasn't Astoria.
They looked up at the sky.
Callum took his most serious look, and framed Draco's face with his hands in a concentrated display of love and gentleness. He had done this dozens of times. Draco wondered how his Dom didn't get totally fed up with it. Sick of repeating himself. Sick of Draco, too.
"You don't give the orders, criminal." Harry replied casually.
"I am."
Draco watched him hunker down in guilt for a second before he lost patience and decreed, "We'll go tonight. Cancel with Callum, and tell the babysitter."
"Ah. Yeah."
"Oh. Um, yeah, I think I made some a week or two ago."
Harry greeted the cashier as he entered the French deli. She welcomed him very politely, not seeming fazed by his far less fancy outfit than hers, a very pretty, immaculate white apron. Harry had learned that the rich Muggles in the area often dressed very simply here, perhaps to ward off the pain of wearing a tie or high heels the rest of the time, or perhaps because given the price of real estate, they didn't have to prove their wealth by their clothes anyway. Harry headed straight for the wine aisle, surprised even to know with such certainty where it was. He had spent more time in the neighbourhood than he realised. He'd even made some Muggle friends at the gym, come to think of it. He had been invited to a few dinners. He'd even put up with being cheekily introduced as a bachelor, as long as his neighbours never uttered the words 'hero', 'Apparition accident' or 'evil forces'.
Draco let himself go in the feeling of deep serenity and safety, incomprehensible as it was.
"And..." Draco interrupted Harry with a silent laugh. Harry looked down, obviously embarrassed, and blushed a little. He had gone to so much trouble. When had he and Draco's friends done all this? "And," Harry continued, "Hermione helped me put you and Scorpius on the Ministry's list of protected persons. So you can find another job for the people who sort your private mail at Sectumsempra, because the Ministry will be looking after it now. There are going to be special alarm spells on your names. If a wizard with a heavy criminal record comes within a few miles of you or even says your name, we'll know. That sort of thing. That's the best I can do in terms of institutional protection. And I've got the Ministry's contacts in the international Muggle police to do the same. If your names or photos appear on the Dark Net, anywhere they shouldn't, or by shady people, we'll be warned."
"Eventually, one day. For what we're doing now, it's not necessary yet. And you know my safeword. Oh, one more thing. If you're ever mad at me for something, if we fight, if I piss you off, I don't mind you using S&M to punish me, whenever and however you like. But after that, we're good, it's erased. You don't get to hold it against me or blame me anymore."
"Yes."
Narcissa laughed. She had a beautiful laugh. Scorpius looked at her as if she were a deity, his big grey eyes fascinated. She looked so young still. If Harry hadn't known her, he would have assumed she was less than forty. For all his glamours, Lucius looked so old and tired beside her. Harry wondered what kind of magic she used. He wondered if they were the same as the array that Draco carefully applied to his skin. He wondered if at fifty, sixty, Draco would still look young and fresh and amazing. Maybe Harry should ask him to buy some of those potions for him. He didn't want to look like an old man next to him.
"You knew I had a baby, but you didn't know what everyday life with him involved. You are one of the most powerful wizards in the world. How would you..."
Two Doms joined the sofa square excitedly, some sort of boxes in their hands which put the wizards in a good mood. They presumably recognised their function, contrary to Harry.
He tugged imperceptibly at the left sleeve of his turtleneck.
"It's not just an impression. But Hermione is very law-abiding. We can't say anything if she comes. So no, I think."
Draco paid attention to the smells and sounds, but he didn't get a clue, Callum's scent covering the rest. And then Draco heard his son's babbling.
Their photos together dated from May 2003 to June 2005. So it must have been more than a year since they were separated, probably. And Draco was still shoutin his name as he came. The guy must have been exceptional.
Harry's heart was breaking. He could feel it in his chest, pounding, aching, tightening.
"He told me he wasn't allowed to see other children very often," Harry said, a little saddened all of a sudden, swallowing the last of his vodka. "Because of his magic?"
Harry had never put his cock in such a tight opening, not even on his first time with a virgin Ginny. He put all his concentration into not cumming on the spot. He held Draco's hips tightly, and the paint melted off his fingers, overwhelming him with sharp sensations. Harry could feel every detail of Callum's penis alongside his own. He tried to remember how to breathe.
"You do realise that the whole department has been talking about this for weeks, don't you? Harry Potter and his nemesis Draco Malfoy, Death Eater and Death Eater's son, breaking bread together... The most historic reunification since Germany."
Draco, Ron, Scorpius and the other non-running Weasleys mingled with the crowd, just behind the dividing line, around a bend where there were slightly fewer people.  They cheered loudly for the participants, dressed in the same style as Hermione, dripping with the strange jellies on the course, making noise from the bells attached to their clothes or hats. Draco nearly choked when he saw Shackelbot himself taking part, trying to drag the young man who had just caught him over a puddle of Slip 'n' Slide. "There are three laps," Ron explained in Draco's ear.
They rose to the surface to breathe. In the end, Draco found himself wedged between Harry's firm body and the edge of the pool, Harry's tongue in his mouth and his fingers buried in his hole. As Harry stroked his bruised ass, he moaned into Harry's mouth, creating a small vibration.
"There are lots of people who claim to be in love with me, even so many years after the war. It still amazes me. If you had any idea of the letters, the packages I get..." Harry wrinkled his nose, making Draco laugh. "But they're typically people I'd never consider as potential partners again. And they scare me, honestly."
"What's it for?"
"I'm still waiting for your owl."
And then, little by little, Harry saw the difference. When they passed Harry at the Ministry, the other Heads of Department would linger, chat, ask for news. There was one lunch invitation, then dozens. Politicians, magistrates, charity leaders. One night Draco and Harry had dinner with the director of St Mungo's. Another one with the Minister. At first Harry was annoyed by this sudden interest in their couple. He felt like he did after the war: as if people wanted to use him, saw him as a means, an opportunity to an end. Draco was more relaxed about it. His calmness and politeness rubbed off on Harry.
"When I was a little boy, my dream was to become a Quidditch champion, but I never had the skills, and anyway it was never really an option for me. So I dreamt of being my father: that people would know me, greet me respectfully in the street and at galas, that I would have power, influence, money. I had pretty much everything I wanted as a child, I didn't really have any extra desires. Except the cat. My father always refused categorically, although it was my dream. And then there was the war, and I didn't know what I hoped for the future, except that the one I had imagined before wouldn't happen. Today... Today I regret many things. But I am proud and happy that I had Scorpius, that I had my marriage with Astoria, that I loved wonderful men, that I developed my own business, that I am not at the beck and call of my parents or the Pureblood circles, that I enjoy my sexuality as I see fit. I still have things to work out but I think I've already taken a good step towards being pretty happy with my life.  Most of the time. "He ran the palm of his hand over the back of his neck, where Harry had caressed it earlier. On one of the cuts. "Why did you ask me to come with you to the orphanage, Harry? To prove to you that deep down I wasn't a Death Eater anymore?"
"Clarke!"
The driver was parked as close to the hospital as possible. Draco hated the Floo, and he was too sick for Apparition.
Harry easily spotted Callum's figure, sitting with a dozen or so Doms in the Chapiteau, in a large square formed by four leather sofas. That evening he was wearing heavy leather boots, military trousers and a white undershirt that showed off all his bulging muscles.
"I want to pay," Harry protested. There was a little mental battle with the cashier, who said that his boss would hang him by his feet if he found out that he had charged them for the entry, until Draco took the Galleons from Harry's hand, put them on the counter and left, dragging Harry with him, before the man could protest. They took the lift, which went down, down, down.
Harry was just as desperate to hold him tight until morning as he was to comply with his request. He felt Orion's hand on the back of his neck, deftly caressing all his most sensitive nerves, massaging his neck, his shoulders, and Harry shivered. The urge to bury himself in the man was irrepressible. So irrepressible that Harry surprisingly felt his glamour flicker from his emotion. The charm quickly settled back into place.
"You said 'relationship'," Harry remarked, grinning from ear to ear.
"Call me. Night and day. It' s what I'm paid for, and it's what I want to do personally. You'll let me know if you get any news about his condition... ?"
"Oh, I forgot something," said Harry, chewing on his lip. "I... may have bought houses." Draco raised an eyebrow. "I suggested to your neighbours that they were bug infested and that the easiest thing to do would be to move out as soon as possible...? But I didn't rip them off, I promise. I offered a fair price for their houses."
Harry held his waist. He was literally holding him. "Draco. You're the victim. You do what you want to do. She's on trial, not you. Come on, it's 2pm. Where do you want to eat?"
Draco shook his head no. He opened his eyes and Harry gazed devoutly into the grey irises. Draco smiled.
Harry made a mental note to thank Pansy Parkinson for giving him twice the maximum recommended dose of relaxants, because his wand was itching badly and he didn't know what he would have been capable of  in his normal state when right now it wasn't blood but rage that was coursing through his veins.
Draco smiled as he thought of all the muggle things he'd managed to juggle, alone, in unfamiliar surroundings and with a baby. He smiled again, serenely, at the love Callum held for him.
"Sure, if you want."
As he walked, Harry searched his pockets for his keys, checking them twice before finding them in his front left pocket, where they always were. When he looked up at the door, he had to rub his eyes a few times. "Draco? Draco, are you okay?"
TW : very quick reference, without any details, to past sexual abuse.
Harry wasn't really thinking about what he was saying. His brain was screaming "it's good, it's tight, oh he's squeezing around your cock, oh he's moaning", his penis was swelling and penetrating Malfoy with delight in great thrusts. But Harry's anger managed to speak on its own. His disgust. Of course Malfoy had come out of this without a scratch. Not without scars... But without any real problems or mourning, had he? Malfoy the privileged one, the rich one, the protected one, Malfoy who got giant packets of sweets from his loving parents at Hogwarts, Malfoy who could pick up anyone he wanted in gay bars with his round little arse and his angel face.
Harry nodded, his lips tight. He had tears in his eyes for the first time. Perhaps because the strange man, so rigid and cold at first, now actually evoked kindness and compassion.
Ginny smiled at him. Sincerely. "Do you want to know something for when you get pregnant?"
Draco nodded. "I didn't tell anyone - not even your family. I pretended that I sensed something in our marriage bond."
Harry dropped his fork, which only Draco noticed, because Rose chose that moment to shout to her mother that she wanted some cake too. Hermione gave her a small piece, and the girl ran back to the ball pool a few feet away. Draco smiled as she shared some of her treat with Scorpius.
The elves seemed genuinely interested and delighted by the good news. "We had planned duck magret, gratin dauphinois and marrons, sir."
Unable to resist, Draco waved his hands to draw everyone's attention to him. "Witches, wizards, Harry James Potter has proposed to me."
"I think I could handle it. The first few sessions at the BDA, we talked a lot about managing anxiety attacks, subdrops, that sort of thing."
They both inhaled sharply as the sub was suspended.
Draco shook his head negatively. He weakly pulled Harry to him and breathed more deeply against him. Harry wrapped his arms around him, placing kisses on his neck. Draco's magical strength was so weak.
Harry complied.
Draco let himself go against the naked, muscular torso, "I love you."
Lola looked at him, waiting for something. Draco sighed and accioed the shirt, and held it up for Lola to admire. She nodded approvingly. "He has taste."
"Didn't the doctors recognize it?"
"It's silly, but... I like people to be happy. I like them to feel respected, cared for. My friends, my employees, my lovers. My sexuality is just an extension of that, in a way. I love pleasing my Doms. I love to be obedient, I love to be the instrument for the realisation of their pleasure, however extreme or demanding their desire. I love to give pleasure - I can't take pleasure without giving it first."
"We did get married." Draco smiled at him fondly. He moved his mouth up his stomach, up his chest, pressing his lips to Harry's. His two fingers were still working him, alternating cleverly between massaging his prostate and scissoring to dilate him for penetration. Harry groaned and grunted into his mouth. He held Draco's back tightly, pressing him against him, scratching at him in his haste.
"Was Ginevra Weasley the only one?" asked Draco.
Ron fled into the kitchen, his cheeks red, before Harry could show him any great gesture of friendship. But Harry felt loved. It was moments like this, sitting on Ron and Hermione's living room carpet, that made him feel like it was worth getting up in the morning.
"Magical status?"
"You're so fucking brave, Draco." Harry smiled at him. Embarrassed, Draco put the Orb back in the insulating pouch and into his pocket so he would have something to do with his hands. But Harry didn't let go, and grabbed his face between his two hands. "You're a great father," he said, close to his face. Draco smiled and rolled his eyes.
The two wizards stilled, instinctively anticipating the cries of an awakened baby. Doing this within a stone's throw of the closed door to their child's room suddenly didn't seem very wise, but Scorpius didn't wake up.
Harry coughed a little at the word 'necromancy'.
But later, yes. Harry wanted to spend time with all of Draco's friends that he had met, in more pleasant circumstances than a hospital room. He had friends from all backgrounds, all professions, all countries, met on his travels, on his business trips. When he witnessed the eclecticism of Draco's close friends, Harry realised with a certain astonishment that he had not lived in comparison. Not explored. Not discovered. His circle was literally the Weasleys, his former housemates and his colleagues.
"Not yet."
5 January 2008 - House of Callum Healey and Benjamin Silverthorn, London
Harry climbed behind him too, and Draco sped up. "You better not follow me, Potter! You have no magic, remember! If you fall, you fall!"
Harry had a good evening.
Harry knew that he was used to much more and much worse. That he could take more, with equal obedience, grace and abandon. He remembered Callum's directions, which he had repeated to himself mentally like a mantra. Draco had experienced many more of these strokes. But his body signals were already totally out of control, and his magic was bursting through the ceiling.
"I think Mr Malfoy has many reasons to be motivated to want his life back." The doctor smiled at him knowingly.
"I haven't seen my son this happy since he was with his French prince. And it wasn't like Jules was ever going to assume their relationship publicly or anything like that. I didn't think my son would ever... come to terms with his lifestyle. If you have the courage to offer him all that, and security... It's not like I expected Draco to marry a woman again, anyway. He and Scorpius are better off with you than alone."
He had a feeling that whatever Malfoy did would be on the biggest stage, where the most people could see him.
Harry moved a little closer, looking around, but ultimately thought it wiser, so close to the orphanage, not to devour the blond’s mouth.
"Clever," Ginny commented, nodding approvingly. "That way you won't have Harry breathing in your ear all the time."
"Do you work every day?"
"My husband is the Chief Auror. I want my son to go to Hogwarts one day. England is my home."
Harry nodded and smiled gently. He carefully accioed their cups of tea, which had cooled just enough on the coffee table, and handed Draco his. "Ready when you are."
Harry tried to stay composed, but he was boiling. His magic was on fire, burning with power, so much so that at times it seemed to overwhelm him, to overtake him. He explained that he found no understanding, no extenuating circumstances for Dunne. He had read every letter she had ever written to him, and he judged her to be an intelligent woman, in full possession of her means, who had decided that Harry's life belonged to her and that he could not have a relationship with someone of whom she disapproved. He insisted that he had never taken a single step towards her that might have fed her fantasy, that he had never spoken to her alone and never answered her letters beyond the pre-written thank-you notes sent after the war to his admirers. He added that he expected great severity from the Tribunal, and that he would consider any other decision to be an apology for wanton hate crimes. At the end, his eyes clouded over a little.
"That's likely," said the doctor, bursting into laughter. "Do you smoke, Mr Potter?"
The waiter returned with a tray of tequila. Harry toasted with Draco and gulped it down - he needed it. Draco and Narcissa did the same, in one go. Lucius sniffed the contents of the glass first, doubtful, and sipped it. "It's not bad. I'm curious about Muggle food. Is that why you wanted us here, Draco? To take us on a little cultural excursion?"
The light was quite strong behind his closed eyelids. It must have been afternoon.
Callum laughed, but halfway through his laugh turned into a yawn.
"That's pretty cute, Draco," Ron teased him, trying to lean in to see him despite his hiding behind the baby. "A long, one-sided, secret love... That explains a lot about your relationship at Hogwarts, actually."
Harry was rewarded sooner than expected, in a way he did not expect either. A real date, somewhere other than in a S&M club, would have suited Harry perfectly. But Draco offered him something more special. He magically summoned a small box to him from the bedroom. He opened it, revealing a magic brush and three small orange vials.
"Hi, Harry."
Harry longed to see him eat from the floor, or from an animal bowl, but his heart could only take so much excitement for one day.
Draco came in his mouth after a shamefully short time. Harry didn't care. He licked him clean and shiny with saliva, then stood up, his mouth an inch from Draco's.
"Who is the most powerful wizard in the world?"
And one morning, while cutting up some cold cuts for the aperitif, Draco was overcome by nausea. He ran to the nearest bathroom. The clenching of his stomach. The burning in his throat. The smell. The weeping eyes. The taste of bile. It was horribly, horribly familiar.
"Everything will be fine," Harry promised. They were allowed to appear in public. In fact, Harry was rather excited. He had never been on a date at the aquarium. He hadn't been there in years, and he'd loved visiting it with Teddy - a wizarding aquarium was closer to an amusement park than the Muggle equivalent. It would keep them entertained from the trial.
"Kneel before me. There, on the bed, where I can contemplate what is mine."
"Not yet. We're on it. Not many people know. You can't tell anyone. I haven't told anyone except a few of my men. Not Draco, not my friends. If Selwyn finds out he's under suspicion, he could go to extremes. Anyone who knows is in even more danger. I've made ten copies of my investigation and scattered them in several Ministry vaults. In case I..."
"The wounds are... only warm. Not hot and stinging as they would be without your spell. Sir."
Draco opened his eyes. He hadn't felt anything, he didn't think the man had cast the detection spell yet. But it was in front of him. Ribbons of blue, green, silver and yellow magic, dancing over his belly, meeting at a tiny point below his navel.
Then Harry put down his whip, wrapped his arms around Draco from behind, touching the wounds and making his husband tremble. "It's over," Harry whispered into his ear, licking it, breathing on the tender skin. "You gave me so much pleasure. You were perfect, my beautiful slave. You're stunning. I'll show you the memory, back home. The memory of what you look like right now, covered in my marks."
Scorpius' lips opened, but no sound came out.
Harry offered him a happy, beautiful smile. "Yes, we'll be fine."
Harry imagined for a second sleeping in his bed while Draco lay on the floor, no blanket, no pillow, against the foot of the bed, like a small dog very attached to his master. Draco gasped as he felt the strength of the erection that followed.
"Who says I wanted to leave here with you, Orion? "
Blaise looked at his wife in surprise.
Harry turned to him and looked at him again, mouth agape, "You too? And Bellatrix's voice."
Selwyn was there, in the only bedroom, in his nightgown and wand in hand. He was a very young adult - he looked so young to Harry. His long hair was greasy. He smiled wide as he saw them enter. Suddenly a colleague of Harry's screamed. Harry raised his wand to immobilise Selwyn before turning his head to see what she was dealing with, to avoid putting himself in danger by diverting his attention from their target, but Selwyn clicked his tongue. "Not a spell or she dies. Sit down, Auror Potter."
"We do, yes."
"You need to relax, beautiful," Harry whispered. "If you want me inside you, you have to stop yourself from contracting."
He picked up the marker.
Harry had hugged Draco tightly. They had returned home. Free.
To allay the concerns of a few commentators: this story is still far from over. I write as I go along. I am very inspired, and I am happy to accept suggestions and ideas from readers, as not everything is set in stone yet.
"Surprise me."
Harry screamed and rushed to him.
"Calm down, Harry. You need a little self-derision in life," said Pansy, who was sitting next to him.
"Then we'll get some rest, and we'll take it easy tomorrow and see how we do it and when."
Harry bit his lip. He pinned his arms against the sides of the muscular, athletic torso and expertly turned Orion over, his chest against the wall.
"Not at all. You're still a big bad Dom in my eyes."
Harry held her close. "I know I wasn't okay for a while... for a few years. But don't worry about me, please. I'll be fine, now." It wasn't very healthy. Harry himself knew that. Making his happiness, his personal completion dependent on someone else. But as hard as he'd tried to find it on his own, nothing had worked, and he'd been stuck. Perhaps Draco Malfoy was a surprising angel of fate after all.
Nikolaj touched him. He touched his hair, his face, his ribs.
Malfoy didn't laugh, didn't answer, but that didn't seem to confuse his Dom, who continued to stroke him gently. After a moment's silence, which Harry did not interrupt, the dark-haired man spoke again.
To tell the truth, Draco didn't know why he felt responsible for Potter's mood. Pity, no doubt. It was his birthday after all. And his ex-wife was probably pregnant.
Harry nodded. He stepped aside to look for a place where his mobile phone could pick up and ask Madeleine if the night with Scorpius had gone well.
What Callum Healey had realised in his 13 years as a Dom was that he couldn't mix love and D/s relationships. He had never even tried. He didn't want to. His love for his subs had something of a religious devotion at times. He admired them, he cherished them, he took his role very much to heart. He couldn't bear to argue with a sub about the colour of their plates, or who should take out the rubbish. He wouldn't have wanted a sub to see him in his pajamas, or sick, or depressed, or to know that he spent hours at the gym every day or mostly ate chicken, rice and broccoli to keep his body desirable. No, there was normal life, friendships, love, family, colleagues; and there were the scenes, the D/s, out of this world, suspended, exceptional. He was friends with some of his subs, but their relationships were different then: there was the friendship, as equals, tender, and there were the moments of scenes, where the D/s dynamic imposed itself, implacable. In truth, Callum was hardly capable of spanking his love partners. They were two different worlds.
Harry's clothes had been washed and ironed. He put a cleaning spell on himself and dressed while Blaise stood motionless, scanning the clothes in the cupboard. When he didn't like anything, he flicked his wand to the right, and new clothes appeared, replacing the old ones.
Harry smiled despite himself. He fucking loved him too. He warmed him up a little more with the flogger before inserting a metal plug into his little hole. It quivered, excited by the beating. Harry bit one of the delicious buttocks, leaving a mark on it. Draco screamed. Just to hear it again, Harry bit the pink flesh.
"I think as a school we have a responsibility on these matters," McGonagall said thoughtfully. "That hasn't always been the position of this institution, particularly as it has mostly been run by old, white, heterosexual, cisgender men... but it's about time we changed. You'll probably have sex education sessions covering these different subjects soon. If the board members allow it."
"Harry..."
Hermione elbowed him, and Harry just smiled and squeezed Draco's arm and complimented his cake, but Draco suddenly felt brave.
"You see, Leo, people often think that BDSM breaks subs, shatters them, weakens them. For me, it's more the result of ordinary rough sex, anonymous sex, without attention to the other, or more generally all destructive and passionate relationships where you think so much about your own feelings that the other becomes an object. Of desire, of fantasies. For me, BDSM is rather interesting in that it allows to repair, to rebuild, to strengthen, to give confidence. It is based on trust and devotion. And devotion is not a submissive who forgets himself. It is above all a Dom who puts him first, who thinks about him, who pays attention to his desires, his needs, who does everything to satisfy them, while keeping him safe. Respected. Loved."
He turned back to Harry and showed him the file in question, without opening it.
Harry burst out laughing, alone in the middle of the aisle, when he spotted a stuffed scorpion. It was pale blue, soft and very cute, with big friendly eyes. The label said it was safe for a child of Scorpius' age. Harry bought it with contentment, then went to get some flowers. On this Friday night the shop was not empty, but he found a florist available. He was no good with all the hidden symbolism, so he tried to tell her the message he wanted to get across. It wasn't as easy to explain as he wanted.
"Harry! Do you know what's wrong? Is he unconscious?"
"Okay."
Draco was shaking. He had indeed lost consciousness for a few minutes. He had cum six times - the last two, after spells to get him hard again. Despite all the conjured lube, his cock was about to fall off, his ass no longer fully closed, gaping and quivering. He was covered in small, almost innocent bites, but Harry hadn't lifted a hand to him, not even for a slap or a little spanking. As if he'd sensed his need for tenderness. Wherever he looked on his body, he found a trace of Harry's mouth, more or less dark, all signs of that moment when Harry seemed perfectly submerged in unbounded hunger and adoration.
"Oh yeah, Ginny brought some, don't worry."
"I haven't been here since Scorpius, actually. Too much magic. Too many dragons. But I like the Reserve. Well, as long as we stay away from the fire dragon pens, but we're on the same page on that one."
And for the readers who like order and chronology, here is the dating of events known at this stage of the story:
Draco sighed as if he was exercising infinite patience with kindergarteners. Harry couldn't blame him. The kids could be insufferable. In fact, they had often reminded Harry of a very young Draco Malfoy using supremacist slurs at Hogwarts...
On the fifth day, Harry arrived in the room at nine o'clock in the morning. A nurse had turned the radio on to music on her rounds that morning - the doctors said that Draco's mind was reacting to sounds, but they couldn't work out whether it was reflexive or whether Draco was actually aware of what he heard.  This was usually determined by using Legilimency, but like all proper Occlumens, Draco's mind had become a fortress in an instinctive retreat position when he lost consciousness.
Teddy nodded seriously. Harry had been a little anxious about this, but carrying an Orb was no danger to Teddy. It would only probably be weird to see his hair in its natural colour.
Draco felt his chin tremble, but he stopped himself from crying. He slid off the bed and straddled Callum, crushing him with all his might in his arms. He was not used to being any kind of weight or strength against his larger, more muscular lover, but in his haste and vigour, Draco knocked Callum backwards. He didn't seem to mind. Once he was lying on his back on the shimmering carpet, Callum simply put his arms around Draco's back and held him on top of him. "Of course I want us to stay friends," Draco replied against his neck. "Of course I do. I can't believe you could think otherwise. I don't even know... I'm not saying we won't have sex or play anymore... I just want..."
"Of course, if you want to."
They'd never really talked about it. About the link between Harry and Scorpius. Draco hoped this cleared up his thoughts on the matter.
"Do you need anything?" the lawyer asked. "To warn someone?"
"Soon," Harry committed.
Callum was sitting on a tantric couch, a hybrid between a curved armchair and a specially designed sex bench, and Draco was straddling him, naked. Callum was deep inside him. There was no real thrusting, more like a little grinding with minimal movement. Callum's hands were around his neck, over his leather and silver collar.  No instruments, no extravagant outfits, that day. Sometimes Draco's eyes were closed, exalting his trust in his Dom for the last ten years. Sometimes he opened them, and the looks they exchanged then, as Draco was slowly choking...
Harry emerged from his thoughts to thank the waitress, who had come to bring their drinks, and to order for him and Teddy, who didn't like to do it himself. The children were talking animatedly about the treasure hunt the animators had promised for the afternoon. Lola's children made some pretty bad English mistakes, but they always managed to make themselves understood, sometimes with the help of Draco or Lola for a particular word.
Draco couldn't even remember the last time he'd flown. He picked out four brooms that had come out within the year, unhooked them and weighed them, caressing their curves. They looked brand new.
wrote Draco, trying to keep a straight face.
Draco had chosen Chef Hélène's restaurant to meet his parents. He had reserved a private room upstairs. Hélène was working that day. She came to greet them, and Harry was surprised that she recognised him. She very kindly brought a silver tray with three small glass containers of different coloured purees. She listed the ingredients to ensure that Scorpius had no particular allergies and Draco thanked her warmly. Scorpius had started his morning nap a little later than usual and was still asleep in his pram by the window.
Harry watched in amazement as they got excited and moved into place. Callum and Benjamin were making out upstairs - Callum was quite buzzed.
"Yes."
Harry climbed back up from under the covers, where he was lazily licking the sweat off Draco's body, exhausted from their torrid sex (and perhaps also from the several hours spent motionless under the desk keeping Harry's cock warm in his mouth while he finished an urgent Auror file).
"You wanted to let me sleep in and buy me brunch on the first night, when I was just a stranger you ran into at a club," Harry recalled.
"Seriously, Potter?" he snarled. "How exactly did you only recognize me now? Blond? Light eyes? A tendency to be sarcastic? One of, what, twenty Death Eaters in my age group?"
Harry searched his head for a memory and materialized the prince's face in the air. Benjamin hissed, "You better watch out, Harry. Veela blood?" he guessed before opening his mouth a little wider, "wait wait, is that a crown?" Everyone hammered Draco over his royal ex. He complained and tried to hide behind Harry, then Callum when the first option didn't work, but even the broadest, most muscular back he knew wasn't enough against their teasing. But deep down, Draco liked it that way. Callum and Thomas were Muggles; the names Potter and Malfoy they knew from their learning of wizarding history, but they were only words in books. But for Benjamin to treat them as two perfectly normal wizards was precious. He had been at Hogwarts years before them, he had not been involved in the war. After a bit of adjustment, he had finally handled the announcement of their true identities superbly. That made him one of the few wizards who knew both their identity and their sexuality. It was nice to be themselves.
Draco nodded, his mouth full.
"Outside the bubble? At least four hours, I'd say. Are you... Are you okay?"
"With Jules, we had continued to see each other, even if it was more rare."
"The best there is," Draco panted.
"If I was the one who had died in childbirth leaving you alone with Rose, would you have thought it normal for someone who didn't like you to disrespect my death?"
"Of course, Potter. One day I said 'hmm, maybe' instead of 'sure, yeah' redeems eighteen years of wrongdoing."
Draco loved his office. Everything in it was tasteful. No wonder - it was his wife who had chosen this room for him when Draco had bought the building, who had furnished and decorated it. Draco had never wanted to change anything. Thinking about Astoria was still often painful, and he didn't know if he would ever be able to return to the Castle of Provence, but strangely, this room didn't hurt. It was as if she was still there a little. As if she was watching over him.
, I'm all yours."
"Ah, but for that I would have had to give you my address, Potter."
"Is that why you're always feeling guilty around Scorpius?" asked Harry in his most gentle voice. He noticed it all the time. Draco was the best father in the world and seemed to consider himself the worst.
"No, I walked for a while. I went to the Astronomy Tower. To the Chamber of Hidden Things, too, but it doesn't work anymore. The door is there, but it doesn't open anymore."
"I'm the one who should apologise," said Harry. "I should have told you about Draco and I. It was stupid of me. I selfishly wanted to watch your faces when you saw Draco on your doorstep."
"One of my childhood brooms? Did my parents keep them?"
"Could you handle having Thomas in your office all day?" teased Harry. "I'm having a hard enough time living with Draco, and we aren't always in the same room."
Draco didn't talk about Astoria much at all. It happened. But not as much as one would expect from a widower after years of marriage. And he never looked sad when he did. A little wistful, a little disappointed, but not sad. Not heartbroken. Not grieving.
If you think about it, Draco was even more responsible for today's deaths than for those of the war. Sectumsempra was his choice. His project. His baby. Muggle-Wizard cooperation, he had believed in it tooth and nail. He had sometimes worried about the attitude of his wizard employees towards the muggles, but never about the other way round. He knew it was a possibility. It was an old Pureblood thing to be afraid of Muggles. Wizards weren't nearly as indestructible as some people thought they were against Muggles. And Muggles had reasons to resent them: jealousy, greed, revenge, fear. What had driven Thomas?
"Did you just recite things Granger says to the word?"
Draco woke up that Sunday feeling well enough to go out. Harry didn't have the courage to refuse him, after the weeks spent locked up in hospital and the week spent locked up at home. He was mostly flabbergasted that Draco would suggest it lightly over breakfast. He had expected Draco to be afraid to go back out in public.
Once they had gone upstairs and brushed their teeth - and Harry had gently brushed Draco's silken hair, which seemed to be a ritual - Harry asked his sub to sleep on the floor at the foot of the bed. Draco found that the rough carpet from last time had been changed to a larger and fluffy black one, the softest Harry could find. As Harry had hoped when he bought it, Draco's pale body contrasted beautifully against the dark colour.
"Beautiful. That's it. Show me how much you like it when I play with you. You made me so proud... You gave yourself to me like such a good boy..."
"No. I'm not going to the Manor. And neither is Scorpius. Why are you even..."
His stomach no longer hurt. The taste was gone from his mouth. "Are you okay, baby?" Papa asked, stroking his cheek.
Draco put Scorpius down in the cot for his nap and went to sit on the end of the wooden deck with a lemonade and the baby monitor. He took off his shoes to put his feet in the sand. The sea was calm and so blue. He couldn't wait to see how his son would react to touching sand for the first time. He took a picture of the landscape, then of the beach house.
On 24 December, some of Draco's friends who worked at Sectumsempra came to the hospital room. They seemed to be in a good mood.
"I'm so ready that I'm not beyond conceiving that baby right there on the platform, against the train."
Potter closed his eyes and sighed. He pointed to the tabloid again, as if that was answer enough.
"Hermione!" exclaimed Ron.
"Good. Glad we're on the same page."
Draco had made a treacle tart for dessert. When he brought it to the coffee table with two spoons, Harry looked at him as if this was not a normal way of caring for his boyfriend but an extraordinary treat. Draco wondered if anyone had ever cared for Harry the way he wanted to. He snuggled up to Harry in the big velvet armchair. An envelope had appeared on the table while he was in the kitchen. He looked at Harry with surprise and opened it.
"Hi," Callum said, turning to him and smiling.
Draco returned to wizarding London in mid-December, looking for Harry's Christmas present. He ignored the whispers. He spotted some rather friendly looks and unconsciously returned their smiles. He even bumped into people he liked - people he knew from work, or old friends - and chatted with them politely, almost shyly. No one insulted him openly or attacked him.
"Can I... Can I make a sacrifice too?"
Draco returned to work as soon as his rehabilitation in the hospital was reduced from six to three hours a day. He had missed it. Plus, because his employees knew what had happened to him, everyone was sweet on him and contradicted him less than usual, even in the usual chaotic strategy meetings. He had a lot of work and stress at first to bring himself up to speed, to correct decisions that had been made in his absence, to give his teams a boost. And then things went back to normal. His stay in hospital had given him dozens of new ideas for needs to develop. It was a great time of creation and emulation. He wanted Sectumsempra to be always on the move. Always innovative. The day they rested on the products that were already working, Sectumsempra would no longer be Sectumsempra.
"Hello."
"Two very sexy, very loving idiots. Does that make up for it?"
The school forecourt, in the shade of the large sycamores, was crowded with tiny children, their big brothers and sisters, and their parents. The weather was fine that day, the summer dresses were out. The heat of the summer holidays had not yet gone away - there were sunburns and freckles on the faces, hats, sunglasses, smiles.
As Harry got up in search of an instrument, Scorpius' cries rang out through the baby monitor.
Harry glanced around the room he so far ignored. It was quite large. The windows looked out onto a wizarding shopping street. There was a built-in cupboard, white wooden chests of drawers and bedside table, and emerald green forest paintings hanging on the walls. The walls were light, but beige rather than white, and the floor was warm brown linoleum. The light was not harsh but dim and soft. There was a comfortable-looking chair by the bed, and the one the doctor had pointed to, larger, in the corner, next to a door marked 'bathroom'. "This is more comfortable than I remember." Harry had spent far too much time at St Mungo's over the last ten years, for himself or for colleagues.
"Or you marry abroad," suggested the young Selwyn, a tall, long haired brunette, Corvus if Harry's memory was correct.
Harry returned with bottles of water, which he handed to the Dom, but the man in the suit intercepted one and drank half of it in one go, thanking him.
"I wasn't saying it's impossible," Ron finally clarified. "That a man has a child. One of our neighbours did, when I was a kid. I was just pointing out that it's more... atypical. And I can't imagine either of you being pregnant." He pointed at Harry and Draco with his chin. Draco didn't correct him by mentioning that they might consider it one day. He wasn't quite ready for that yet. But it was a first step. And Harry had noticed.
The wizard smiled. "Almost as good as Granger at 13," he commented derisively.
The woman bent over him, and clearly tore his left sleeve, tearing a bit of skin with it. She looked at the Dark Mark, shaking her head, oozing disgust, hatred. "Don't you think you've done enough damage already, you evil bastard?" she spat. "You had to show up in England again? Seduce the Saviour himself? I don't know what you did to him, but you won't be able to hurt him anymore, I'll make sure of it."
They performed an ancient ritual ceremony that had been in vogue among wizards in the United Kingdom for a long time, but Harry was very glad that they had not performed it in the cold waters of their country. They sank into the sea, the water wetting their tunics to the waist. They held hands and said the incantations, and put their faces under the water, and let their magic pass through the water, from one to the other, into the sky, into the depths of the ocean, into the earth - they felt the warm sand under their bare feet. The fourth element, they created - a flame in Harry's cupped hands. Magic vibrated around them, the magic of the unspoilt nature, the magic of the guests unconsciously responding to their own power. They blessed their love, their home, their family.
"Scorpius will be happy to see where we are, tomorrow morning."
"That's me."
The next day was Scorpius' very first birthday.  Harry hadn't had time to organise much while he was in and out of the hospital, but he'd tried to make the best of it by relying on Colt. He had only been working for a few days and Harry was beginning to wonder how he had managed to get by in life before him. Colt had been busy ordering and collecting the birthday cakes, and fetching the toy shop catalogues and then the toys Harry and Draco had selected, and preparing the meal. Harry wouldn't have minded a small celebration, but Draco had tentatively suggested that this might be a good opportunity to introduce Scorpius to a few more people, now that the Shield-Orb was ready and they had a separate, protected house where they could host wizards. Of course, they hadn't yet made the new house next door to their liking and it was furnished in a Muggle way, but Colt had had it connected to the Floo in the controlled and anonymous way, and had added everything a wizarding house needed.
"Besides, you got the hang of it quickly," Draco smiled as he swirled the contents of his glass.
The four of them talked about food, summer and the meaning of life, passing around pots of sauce, mixing vegetables, wagyu beef and citrus. On a particularly daring combination of langoustine, Draco exclaimed that a certain wine would probably go perfectly with it. Hélène agreed, and Draco asked her if they had any in the cellar. From the amused and scandalised look Callum gave Harry, Draco had just spent several thousand pounds on the bottle.
He turned to the bags he had set down near the door. The blue envelope lay on one of them.
"Hi," said Harry. "I missed you today."
-Malfoy, I am arresting you as the head of the Sectumsempra Company on suspicion of breaking the Statute of Secrecy resulting in a large-scale terror catastrophe. In accordance with post-war magical laws, as you have committed no direct crime, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you in your trial. You are being held in custody while the judge decides whether to remand you in custody or release you on bail pending trial. Do you understand?"
"It can't have been easy for you," Ginny acknowledged soberly, looking down at her baby. "When Voldemort came back."
When the blond returned to Harry, he dropped gracefully into a nearby chair, but not right next to him. Harry wanted to touch him. He stared at him like a child looks at a parent who has refused him sweets. The blond man hid a smile behind his crossed hands. A man asked them if they wanted something to drink, offering the blond a particular red wine, as if he knew his taste. A minute later Harry was sipping his sophisticated cocktail with contentment. The anticipation was as scalding as it was delicious. Only a few minutes had passed since the blond had returned from the counter when they were informed that the room was ready, but Harry was starving already.
(See the end of the chapter for
Afterwards, they had to go to the bathroom despite their laziness, but they continued to kiss very, very softly under the hot shower. Almost shyly.
"I look pretty good." Pansy winked at him, and Draco gently hugged her as tightly as her very round belly would allow, before helping her to sit on the sofa.
Harry kissed Draco fiercely.
"You're not allowed to die, Harry."
Harry didn't answer. He stood up, and made Draco lean forward, his forearms circling the basin. Harry Accioed some lube and played with his revealed tiny hole, fingers, cock, fingers and cock, then jerked off with one hand and fingered Draco with the other, pressing repeatedly on his prostate. When he had five fingers inside him, his hand was suddenly sucked into the abused muscle, all the way to his wrist. Draco and Harry grunted simultaneously. Harry worked his hand inside him, not pulling it out, instead trying to go deeper, clenching and unclenching his fist. Harry cummed a first time, spilling his semen all over Draco's buttock - he would have liked to orgasm on his own hand where it pressed into his sub's hole, but they were never careful enough, and Harry respected Draco's concern more than anything.
"Anyone who wants to is welcome. We've got six bedrooms to fill, over there," Harry agreed, his hand on Draco's back, stroking him innocently. Draco shuddered. 'Bedroom' and 'fill' were dangerous words in Harry's mouth.
Draco smiled weakly. Harry kissed his cheekbones several times. Draco began to tell him about the animals again. They moved on to the tropical pool, then to the impressive electric pool filled with energy-charged, lightning-tossing creatures. Sometimes they teleported right in front of them and then disappeared, like bolts of lightning. They were not so much pools as vast expanses of magically enlarged water, of which they travelled only a tiny fraction.
"Is the power of the Orb the problem?"
Draco opened his mouth. "Are you serious? I've been waiting for this for ages, for you to offer it to me."
In May, it was the start of the Quidditch season. Harry surprised Draco, Ron and Blaise by taking them to the opening match. He had neglected to tell Draco straight away that he had taken an expensive year-round box under the name Potter-Malfoy. The golden letters were engraved on the door. Engraved.
Also in May, Draco began to regain his voice. It was shaky and weak and awkward, and he was very self-conscious about using it, so much so that he didn't do it outside of physical therapy. And then he started to use it, very quietly, when he was alone with Scorpius. One day Harry surprised him. Draco suddenly saw him in the doorway - he had found the stuffed scorpion without which the baby couldn't sleep.
"If her parents can find a taxi quickly enough. Travelling by Floo isn't great with such a small baby."
"Obviously she was capable of it. She had a strong hatred for Draco. People who read my mail should have seen that. I never thought that people who admire me would resort to violence. I'm going to crush her."
Draco stepped out of his role and tousled Harry's hair a little more, an almost tender smile on his lips at the hair disaster. "You should go to the bathroom.I'll wrap this up for you to eat at the office, if you like.  I'm in a bit less of a hurry than you. The advantage of being a CEO and all that..."
They looked at each other for a long time.
Draco wore a thin striped jumper and blue jeans which he rolled up. His wavy hair was not combed back but fell around his face. He looked almost normal. Approachable. He was also very handsome, and when Harry told him so, Draco splashed him.
"So have
"Then I want it."
Harry gave him a playful kick under the table. It seemed to give him an idea.
"And Birmingham!" added Draco, making Harry smile.
"Send me your doctor's address. I'll owl them my records."
"Relief. The feeling of moving on."
Harry planted his index finger on Draco's sternum, smiling. "You're insufferable," Draco repeated.
Harry dosed the paint very, very weakly. He started with the lighter vial. Draco put his feet up on the edge of the tub, his legs sticking out of the water, and closed his eyes. Harry drew small lines on his thighs, paying close attention to Draco's reactions. He flinched at first, then relaxed. Harry thickened the lines as he went along.
"I have ideas," Harry admitted. "But I don't want to fight him. He needs all his energy to get better. I don't want to upset him in any way."
The whispers grew louder, almost deafening in Harry's head. They sounded pleased. Draco levitated the box.
Harry watched them and the other couples and groups having sex. It was still early, there was nothing too extravagant. It was the introduction. Harry was amused to see a sub with a cat-tail plug and small ears bending over a bowl and licking milk with the tip of his pink tongue, as several wizards watched on.
And that changed everything. Because what awaited Draco if he woke up was no longer Scorpius and Harry in a pretty house. It was tears and blood. He could no longer be with Harry. That made his son a target. Draco had been horribly selfish. He had thought of his happiness and what he wanted before what was good for his son. He was doing it again. Even though he had promised himself to put Scorpius first. He had failed his child
He woke the whole house, to Harry's laughter, by shouting that his son had done magic. The early hour drew grumbles at first, but as everyone realised the situation, Scorpius was acclaimed as a tiny miracle. It was an even more precious sign than in ordinary wizards' families. It was a sign that his allergy was progressing well. That his magic was developing. And before he was even two years old! Draco even managed to swallow his dislike of fire-calls to contact the St. Mungo's doctor who was now treating Scorpius, at eight o'clock in the morning, and tell him the news.
It wasn't as large as last week's suite, but it was just as lavish. It was laid out a little differently, but Harry understood that each time the staff put Malfoy's things in the same arrangement.
And Harry was pulling them apart.
"Karma?" asked Hermione politely.
"It's Rose," said Pansy, who was also very happy to babysit the little ones. "Do you want me to get her parents?"
Molly Weasley had woken up in the middle of the night most nights of her life. There had been her little babies, and the anxieties, and her husband's snoring, and her children's night terrors after the war, and the long sleepless nights thinking about her little Fred, and then her grandchildren, whose lungs were just as strong as her children's then, and the worst, the nights when someone came to warn her that a member of her family was at St Mungo's - usually Harry, sometimes Ron, before he had finally decided to resign from that insane job.
(See the end of the chapter for
June arrived and the flowers in their gardens bloomed even more. Draco and Harry set up a big swing in the garden for Scorpius, complete with a climbing wall, and they spent the day next to it because Scorpius refused to move away from his newly improved playground.
"May I come, Sir?" Draco begged as he pounded his prostate relentlessly.
"Don't look at me like that," Blaise told him in good humour. "Even if you don't have a castle, the Potters have been rich since the beginning of time. In my family, it's recent. My grandfather was a landscaper."
"I never confirmed I was a Gryffindor."
More time passed. Draco felt worse and worse. As if the walls were shaking. "Please, Callum, go upstairs. Go to your office. Wait there." If the facade finally gave way, if the bubble exploded, it was likely that life expectancy would be better as far away from the point of detonation of the bomb as possible. But Callum didn't seem determined to move. "You're a Muggle. You're more fragile. If I get through this and you don't, I'll never recover. I'll be fine. Just walk away. Please."
Draco pressed Harry's head down, silencing him and resuming the blowjob. He was on the verge... seeing Harry on his knees for him was turning him on prematurely."I just handed out envelopes of money and threats of tarnishing reputations to the right people," Draco gasped.  "Nothing extraordinary."
"Exactly. I want to make things right. You..." Emotion choked Draco for a moment. He tried again after a few minutes. "I think Harry's ready to handle me on that front too. I want to leave room for him. In case he wants a contract soon, in case... I want to be available to him if he asks for it. When he asks for it. And I'm ready too, I think."
"What spells does that cover?" asked Draco of Harry.
"You can rest easy, Potter. I've done enough damage to my family as it is. I'll keep my nose clean for the rest of my life. In the hope, among other things, that I will get to see my grandson at least once."
"You said we could think about the future now, didn't you?" said Harry. "So I thought about it. And I realised that in about ten years' time our tiny, tiny little Scorpius was going to take a suitcase almost as big as he, the cat, and go and spend the whole year abroad, away from us, in a big cold castle..."
"It's two hours by plane," Harry said. "I looked it up on the internet, they say it's perfectly feasible with a baby Scorpius' age."
Harry fucked him against the fridge. Draco's precum left a shiny trail against the metal doors.
They remained in silence for a moment. Blaise stroked the inside of Harry's thigh mechanically, twirling his body hair. Harry put an arm around him. He could feel himself starting to fall asleep.
"Because of the press?"
Harry snapped out of his stupor and forced himself away from the building where he hoped more than anything that Draco was, protected by walls and time. He went to help clear a path for the ambulances.
"I've been very bad, Sir..." Draco's voice was hoarse and sleepy, and the last word made Harry's cock swell instantly.
That evening, Draco arrived at Harry's house around 8pm. Harry gave him a proper tour. Draco was pleased to see his birthday present on the coffee table in the living room - Harry often flipped through it carefully and hadn't finished it yet. Harry even showed him the rooms he wished he hadn't seen straight away: the empty white rooms that should have been children's rooms. Draco didn't comment on the fact that they were bare and unused, but he took Harry's hand, and that insignificant gesture signified everything to Harry.
The chamber grew dangerously quiet. The Draco in the hospital bed looked around the room carefully.
"It was just sex. But tonight... It... He..."
Harry, Scorpius and Draco returned to the Manor a second time, the day after Scorpius' second birthday. In the middle of the white gardens, there was only one colourful tree: a persimmon tree, planted at Draco's birth. A persimmon tree, because it was the only tree to bear fruit in winter. Lucius carried Scorpius on his shoulders so that he could grab a fruit from the tree. It was not ripe, but its bright orange colour fascinated Scorpius, who rolled the little ball between his hands.
"Cum for me, you little miracle."
"We'll have a nice house here. We'll be able to come here at weekends and spend two days with him a week, at least. I was thinking maybe Daphne and Theo will want to come over sometime? And Ron and Hermione? And all our friends who will have children, in fact. It's barbaric to take the kids away from us from September to July. They'll only be eleven!"
And not so pointless, apparently, because after a few minutes Draco felt better. He fumbled for the marker and the board.
The last chapter is written and will be posted next Saturday. After that, there will be a sequel, but I haven't made any progress in writing it and I'm still very hesitant about its content. I'm starting a hectic year professionally, so you'll have to be patient with the pace of the updates. In addition, if you have some time, I've posted the first chapters of another story, unrelated to the Granted Wishes series - but in which you'll probably recognise themes that are dear to me. It's shorter, less profound, but I love it. It's my contribution to the student/teacher trope.
"Harry! Harry!" Draco convulsed and came, effectively covering himself in sperm.
"The Battle of Hogwarts. The Forest..." Harry's voice broke. Draco looked up at the ceiling to force himself not to stare at Harry. He knew from experience that it was harder to hold back tears, when you were being watched.
"I'm listening."
"What grade are you in?"
The Dom pulled the stool out from under Malfoy's legs. His breathing stopped for a moment, before he gradually relaxed. His Dom was standing behind him, whispering in his ear so low that Harry could not hear. But he recognised the same words in reply on Orion's mouth: "Yes, Master."
He paused, remembering that there were Muggles present. Harry ruffled his hair in pride. Teddy perched on his chair, curious to look into the pram. "Is that your daughter?" he asked Draco.
Draco didn't think twice about his perfect wedding ceremony. Somehow, it made more sense. Their love blossoming in the rubble.
"Harry, sit down. Calm down. They sent me hoping you'd listen to me, but I have to warn you that there are five or six Aurors in the corridor in case you try to do something stupid."
"So you went to Malfoy Manor, just like that?"
Draco nodded. Harry kissed his lips and handed him a bottle of water. "I loved it, Harry."
"Draco... You amaze me. I admire you. I admire your ability to change, to listen, to keep growing. I realise I've always misunderstood this Slytherin thing. Your ambitions don't get you lost in delusions of grandeur; they anchor you in a lifestyle, an ethic, a calm and patient power that makes you succeed. And that figure of the snake... It's not so much that it slithers, or that it bites - although you know how to adapt, although you are a protective father and partner who doesn't hesitate to show his fangs. The snake is also an animal that sheds its old skin. You managed to do that. I am proud of you. I am proud of the man you are today. I love you. I belong to you. I want to spend my life being surprised by you, cherishing you, cherishing our son and any child you will want to give us. Draco Malfoy, will you do me the honour of marrying me?"
"So Harry Potter is a great romantic?" commented Draco, his chin resting on his hand.
"So do I. That's why we're questioning him. We said you wouldn't be part of this investigation, Harry."
"Hi, Julia. I'll need a room tonight."
Draco coughed a small laugh, obviously relieved at Harry's reaction.
Harry went into the house, put down his things, put on an Orb in a more than familiar sequence. The metallic sphere felt soothing against his sternum, like a break after a long day's work that had concentrated all the bad things about magic - the dark magic, the headache-inducing bureaucratic magic, the savage magic of desperation and violence.
Draco was not on autopilot at such times. He was enjoying what he was doing. Fulfilling to the best of his ability what his Dom had asked of him. Making him proud. He pondered his actions, his choices. He thought of Harry's loving smile as he looked longingly into his eyes. He forgot the rest, everything else that wasn't part of their bubble, of the two of them, of Draco wanting to serve him and Harry asking him to.
Hoping not to escalate their argument, Harry kept his mouth shut, although he too would have liked to have learned this sooner. When the tension had subsided a little, Harry nudged Hermione with his shoulder, smiling.
Poor Thomas. Harry knew that he had harboured strong feelings of admiration for Draco, that he wanted to be him, in some ways - to be as skilled and reputable a sub, to be as handsome, to be as talented, to be as important to Callum. Learning that Draco was rich as Croesus, and a wizard, had perhaps been a bit much. But Thomas had nothing to do with it in the end. Chatting with someone to get information was not, really not, like strapping a bomb to his chest and setting it off. Callum had been right. Harry had been right. Harry had been afraid, over the last few days, in those last minute anxieties, that Thomas had been complicit, but so he hadn't.
"I don't bottom," Harry warned him.
"Draco... You trusted me that day in the fire, didn't you? "
Draco went behind the counter with the secretary, who was quite young but seemed pretty stable considering the conditions. "What's your name?" he shouted to cover the alarm.
"But then... If you met in a Muggle place and your parents were carrying an Orb too, or you were using that long-distance Orb, Scorpius would be fine, right?"
"Would you like some water?"
"A few examples of wizarding same-sex couples who have had a natural child in recent decades. I didn't look long, but I already found a few hundred."
Draco was roused from his reverie when his son tried to eat a lavender stem. He quickly moved the bouquet away from him and held his baby out to Harry. The wizard swallowed but held Scorpius with the expert arms of a man who had cared for babies before.  This eased Draco's anxiety, which had been increasing all day. There was no reason for things to go wrong. Harry liked children. Scorpius shouldn't bother him.
At the end of the month, after the funerals, the memorials and when the investigation seemed to be over, Draco turned up on time for his trial. "Draco Lucius Malfoy, as founder and managing director of the Sectumsempra company, you are suspected of breaking the Statute of Secrecy, endangering the lives of wizards and effectively leading to the deaths of sixteen wizards and five Muggles."
"No, sir..."
"Of all the possible Muggle references, did you really choose Batman? How about Pretty Woman?"
Harry gritted his teeth and turned on his heels. "Make sure she doesn't kill herself before her trial!" shouted Harry as he sprinted away. This time he was let through without resistance. He had two side stitches and was out of breath by the time he reached Apparition Point, but within five minutes of leaving the Auror Department, he was on the top floor of the hospital.
"I liked it," Harry admitted.
"I think you're right," he said to Callum. "It's about time. Scorpius is six months old. I need to get my act together. If not for me, for him."
Draco laughed dryly. "Do I really look like I master anything? My kid goes to school and has two babysitters, I have a housekeeper who does the cleaning and cooking, gardeners, bodyguards, managers for every national branch of my company. I hardly do anything."
Harry read the article he was holding out to him. Apparently Astoria Malfoy had run a victim support association that helped rape survivors, initially for witches and wizards who had been abused during the war, and then extended to Muggle victims of wizarding rapists, a phenomenon that was unfortunately common because of the facilitation of magic in this regard. The association offered psychological support to the victims, took care of the legal formalities on the wizarding side, financed wizarding lawyers, and employed private detectives to track down serial rapists about whom the Ministry felt it did not have enough evidence, but more importantly did not have the means to catch them in the act. Apparently, rape trials had increased by 20% since the association was founded. It was mostly funded by Astoria's husband's company.
Draco Apparated directly in the private waiting area of St Mungo's. Security let him through with a wave. He smiled at the secretary. He had been here a good ten times in the last two months, and not always with an appointment, if he was honest.
Harry. Draco hadn't contacted him, since last Sunday. He'd meant to, but time had run out. Or courage. More likely courage. Harry obsessed him enough without even having to actually see him. When they would start seeing each other regularly, Draco could see himself falling off the cliff fast and hard. The dizziness was already beginning, frightening and exhilarating. It was only a matter of time now.
"What do you think, Scorpius? Would you like to go and see Harry?"
"Do you like children, Mr Potter?" asked Lucius.
"Yes. But first, I have a promise to keep. I told you you'd see me again if you went to the BDA, and you did. So this is your reward," he said, pulling a long rope from his bag and placing it on the desk. "You need to be able to train under real conditions, after all. And this," he pulled out a rectangular gift box, "is obviously a present. Happy birthday, Potter."
They laughed so much. They talked and they laughed so much. Harry had never talked that much. They always had something to talk about, to argue about, to agree on passionately.
The thirty-year-old was dressed very casually, which made him look awfully original next to the uncomfortable, eccentric, black or minimalist outfits. He was wearing flattering jeans and a tank top with pale blue, pale pink and white stripes that showed off his muscular shoulders and his countless tattoos. Harry spotted a rainbow, a unicorn and some underwater creatures. The animals moved slightly, a sure sign of magical tattoos.
Draco loved the superb pain, Harry's rigid body holding him captive without mercy, the raucous, heavy hand disciplining him, a far cry from the small pre-sex spankings only meant to arouse. And the longer Harry continued without compassion or concern, the more respect and attraction Draco had for him as a Dom. That was how he liked them. Extreme, confident, doing things properly, making it clear that their own satisfaction was their priority and that it wasn't just about foreplay. He could feel Harry's erection in his trousers, against his hipbone, he could hear his laboured, excited breathing from beating him. Harry loved this.
"I am, sir."
Before the countdown was over, Harry shuddered, his balls clenched and Draco felt thick cum gushing down his throat, too deep for him to taste. He remained calm and did not try to breathe until Harry had emptied himself completely, then he pulled back and gasped for breath. Only one of his hands remained on Harry, gently caressing his balls.
"Oh, I'm used to disappointing you, Ginny Weasley. Honestly, I don't even care."
Potter reacted with the speed of an Auror's reflexes. The cane levitated instead of smashing into a piece of furniture, and Draco felt an unbreakable force field between him and his father. Of course, Potter had to try to avoid a fight in the middle of the Auror department. But Draco appreciated for a second the idea that maybe he was trying to protect him.
"It's a shame," he said with a smile. "I liked you."
"Fuck," sighed Blaise as Harry began to lazily jerk him off. "That's so good. Thank you, Daddy." The term gave Harry goosebumps. He reached his unoccupied hand towards Blaise's face, making him look at him. The wizard was blushing. His cheeks were hot.
"Harry," Ron said, "this morning when you went to the bathroom, I needed some parchment, I was too lazy to go to my office and get some, so I... I opened your bag. I saw what was in it."
He was pregnant.
"Thanks to you, that was a real show."
Callum nodded. They both went up to the bedroom, Harry switched on a small light and Callum sat on the edge of the bed. He reached for Draco's back, but let his hand float a few inches from his skin, never touching it. He assessed the wounds with a critical eye. Harry was shocked to find him relieved. So it could have been worse? Harry felt angry. It was Callum's job to protect Draco. He had failed.
"Oh, there's no need to be afraid of them anymore. I'm the one guarding the territory now."
All the way through, Draco managed to keep his composure, much to his surprise. He knew it made him look cold. Contemptuous. But at that moment, cold was better than panicked or, worse, tearful.
"I'm listening, Harry."
Draco was naked in front of the open bay window, but he shook his head. A little freshness was welcome.
Malfoy was standing in the middle of the cereal aisle of Harry's Muggle grocery shop.
"This is what you want, isn't it?" clarified Callum, his voice losing strength with each sentence. "Not to be my sub anymore? Not to be bound to me by a contract? To have no rights or duties over each other?" Callum breathed in, "To no longer see each other," he said even more softly. He bit his cheek. Draco's eyes widened even more. Callum hesitated a few times before asking in a near whisper, "Unless you think we can stay friends?"
