. He hated it even. It was offensive and it was bringing up too many bad memories. He didn't understand why the sudden provocation after that speech about, basically, getting together in a peaceful way. But the wicked Slytherin seemed to find it funny, he even winked. Maybe he was just unaware of how bad his choice of word was and didn't mean any harm by it. But still, harry was offended.
This was it, their breaking point. Harry knew it was bound to happen, it was only a matter of time. The redhead patience was getting weaker by the day. And Harry didn't have the strength to save it. It was easier to give up at this point.
He said anyway before disappearing in the staircase. Harry didn't answer. He stayed for a while longer in the sofa, chewing the inside of his cheeks nervously. Body aching from being so tensed. But, eventually, he extinguished the last fo the fire in the fireplace and went up to the Gryffindor's room. Walking blindly in the room filled with snores before crashing in his bed.
It made Malfoy snap as he threw himself at Harry in a growl. Grasping his wrist to turn the wand away, the other hand grabbing his shoulder, he pushed him hard into the wall. The Gryffindor winced and made a sound when he felt the pain from the shock in his back. But it only took him a second to fight back. Struggling to push the blond away, he hit his tight hard with a knee to distract him, making the Slytherin bend a bit and allowing him to take the advantage. Managing to get rid of the hand on his shoulder, but not the one at his wrist, he pushed him back only to fall on top of him. Making both of them growl from the fall. He ended up loosing the hold of his wand as they started wrestling on the floor. Grabbing shirt and hoodie and pulling while rolling around to try to stay on top of the other. Harry was staggered to loose that fight for dominance. To be overpowered by the slender blond, who revealed himself to be surprisingly strong. He had finally manage to straddle the raven haired boy and was pining him firmly to the floor, pressing his legs against his sides. Feet curled against Harry's tights to keep them from wriggling. Clenching at his top to keep him still. Bent over the Gryffindor, eyes burning in his, they were both panting.
So it seemed to be a potion that would make him feel good... Or sell him the illusion that everything was good at least. The Gryffindor couldn't help but be reminded of muggle drugs, and he was a bit perplex about it. He had been taught that they are bad, that they turn you into addicted puppets and mess with your brain. And his brain was messy enough... No need to add to that.
He had to quickly get out of there, the ceiling was starting to crack. So he ran back to the door, and again, he was surrounded by the hedgerows, his feet in the mud. The sounds of terror and destruction died when the door closed behind him. But he was startled to discover that he wasn't back at same place. Because now, he wasn't facing the path leading to the crossroad again, but just another door, straight in front of him. A door he had no other choice but to go through. It looked different. This one was painted a bright white, with a gold doorknob. Taking a deep breath, he went to open it. But the scenery  he found behind it was far from what he could have excepted from the look of the elegant door...
He hesitated a few seconds on turning back to simply avoid the annoying presence of the blond and his unsettling examination. Yet, strangely, his feet did not move and he even ended up opening his mouth to answer.
He asked in a low voice. He felt sleepy but knew he still probably wouldn’t get any sleep anyway. He actually just wanted to be alone. Pretend with his eyes closed so nobody would bother him.
The fall seemed long, and the landing was hard and squishy. There was an overwhelming foul smell here. It reeked of blood, mud and death, it was suffocating and disgusting. A buzzing filled his ears, sounding like a hundred flies were flying around him. And as he looked under him to see where he had landed, his body throbbed in horror when he discovered a huge pile of corpses. It was a mass grave and it was like a punch in his stomach, he had the urge to throw up. Scared and shocked, he moved and tried to get up, but the feeling of stepping on dead people was making his legs jelly from guilt. He kept falling, crushing the lifeless flesh under his weight. He was trapped here, surrounded by muddy walls, the edge to high to reach. His heart was pounding, the water from the sea that had drenched him had been replaced by sweat. He wanted to rip his skin off and, in a frenzy, he started screaming. Not even knowing if he was screaming for help, for it to stop or just because he wanted to die right there.
He had thought he had managed to go through that first day, but no. Everything was even worse now. Pressing his hands on his face, he finally screamed in his palms.
She explained lightly, mimicking how to use it with her finger even if the boy still had his eyes locked on the flask.
The raven-haired boy asked, probing. Leaning forward, elbow resting on his knees. Trying to keep the blond's eyes locked in his as if to read the answer in it despite the dim light.
Malfoy's voice seemed weak, as if stuck in his throat. But the raven haired boy managed to hear him anyway. This word that he never thought he would hear trough his rival's lips left him with a strange and disturbing feeling. And he found himself too confused to answer anything. Clumsily nodding his head before continuing his way, leaving the blond behind him. He hastened to join the castle, the word replaying in a loop in his head.
Harry really wanted him to understand. He needed Ron to accept and move on. Because he would never be able to give him what he was asking for. And Harry couldn't deal with the pressure anymore.
He breathed, finally releasing Harry as he got up and turned again towards the window, body shaking a bit. Folding his left arm against his abdomen in a protective way. The Gryffindor sat with relief, patting his hoodie were the blond had held him, running a hand through his dishevelled hair. Which made no difference...
He had already stop believing. The faint glimmer of hope that Ron had offered him had already vanished. Because he couldn't see how, how he could get better when all these people were looking at him like he was a hero. How he could endure this feeling everyday, that of not deserving their admiration. That of being sorry for all the misery in the world.
Harry accused coldly, getting up. Staring at the Slytherin's back with a turmoil of questions in his head. The things he had seen in his dream was still troubling him, they had raised a new form of confusion. He was taking it like a message to warn him, be more careful. He had never dreamt of Malfoy before, for sure it was no coincidence.
Now more calm than yesterday, he decided to take another walk trough the castle. An actual one, not like the crazy running he previously did whilst being eaten alive by anxiety. Walking at a slow pace trough the corridors, he took it in. Looking around, trying to remember where the stone got broken before being fixed, brushing his hands onto the walls. He could still hear the battle in his mind. The loud mixture of spells being shouted, the screams of pain and those of fear, not quite the same. The crackling of stone, and the heavy bang of falling debris. He also remembered fire crackling in some places. It was so dark then, the air filled with dust and the floor sticky with blood. It was almost amazing how peaceful it now looked. Everything so clean, but he wished it wasn't. Except for the memorial outside, there was not a single trace left inside. But they should have left some cracks in the walls, just to remember how damaging this battle was. Because it shouldn't be all erased, like a burn it should always be reminded. To honour those who fought, but also to keep the lesson alive.
He mumbled, focusing to not let a tear fall. Looking at the flask once more, now seeing it as a gift and not something to be wary of. A gentle and kind gesture.
The confession seemed heavy on his heart. The feeling of him being nothing else but an enemy engraved deep in it, being so humble and offering this apology was still hard. But needed if he wanted to move forward with his life. He couldn't hold on to old grudges, live with hate. He was sick of all that fucking hate.
It was Hermione's voice, shouting in struggle behind him, as he passed by her without helping. Focused on the door even though it was breaking his heart. He had the weird thought that, if he could escape, then he would save them all, because the dream would then disappear. He jumped on the handle as soon as he could reach the door. Falling on the other side. The door disappeared as soon as he had crossed it. And he was now in pitch darkness. It wasn't even a room, just nothingness. As if he was floating in an abyss.
Harry's eyes widened, had it already been 20 minutes ? Guess Malfoy was right then, he was indeed lost... Yet, it shouldn't concern him. The Gryffindor didn't care to confess his thoughts to the Slytherin. It was even uncomfortable to have him asking about his well being.
Another voice tried to reach him. This one seemed very far away. Like a distant an echo. Almost otherworldly.
She stated, flipping a page. He could see her bite her lip, guessing that she had something to add but was hesitating.
Without a word, he followed the girl who was already heading towards the kitchen at a fast pace so she could hurry and offload the books on the large table in a relieved sigh.
Suddenly, harry shrugged as he got out of his own head, getting his attention back to the blond. His brows still burrowed.
A tiny smile of relief came across the blond's face. His body seemed to relax a bit also. He was taking that small victory, holding on to it. Feeling a bit more comfortable.
When he finally managed to calm down, breathing more steadily, Harry had wandered around the still empty castle. Everyone was still enjoying dinner in the great hall, celebrating the start of the new school year. He could hear noisy conversations echoing down the staircases, laughers and the enthusiastic clinking of cutlery. Everyone seemed so happy to be back. But the boy stayed alone, staring at the restored corridors with a heavy heart. Ignoring the warm greetings of the portraits, which rejoiced at his sight before grunting at his rudeness. He didn't care. He had quickly found the way out, now walking slowly along a path he knew only too well. His steps were guiding him towards the lake.
She said when she saw him look at the food almost with a disgusted look on his face. Harry shook his head.
Malfoy seemed to be startled when he heard Harry call him. Quickly turning around with the sound of a sniff, almost as if he was scared. He looked small, beaten. No smile in sight today. Instead, Harry noticed a wet glow in his eyes and also a redness. Had he been crying ?
But a glance towards Malfoy kept him for cancelling it. The blond was smiling. Looking happy... A sight that stupidly made him want to smile a bit too. Be he didn't.
And he did as told without trying to protest again. Not knowing if he was just bending to satisfy Hermione, or if he was starting to actually consider the idea of going back. Give life a chance. Or at least, maybe try.
He muttered with an exaggerated disappointed look before smiling and heading towards the stairs, Harry following him. The Gryffindor had a wide grin painted on his lips, he was almost rediscovering the use of his face's muscles. They were a bit rusty, and the feeling was strange in his cheeks. But he was enjoying the small uplifting feeling with which he left the tower. For once, he truly felt a moment of peace, his mind perfectly distracted from the grim thoughts, the constant mourning.
She assured him in her soft tone, looking for something in her pocket before handing him a flask filled with a bright white liquid that seemed to sparkle. Harry looked at it suspiciously but didn't move to take it.
She snapped, crossing her arms against her chest. Looking determined and unwilling to give up. Her eyes burning with tenacity made Harry lose his temper.
He nodded, not really affected by the idea of sharing dorms with the other houses. It wouldn't change much for him as he intended to stay as far away from everyone as possible anyway. He was already planning to avoid the common room.
It was not even morning yet when he opened his swollen eyes. The room was now filled with snores and heavy breathing. One more heavy than the others. His. Body shaking, Harry was, with no surprise to him, pushed out of his sleep by a nightmare. Luckily, it seemed he didn't wake anyone. For once, he must not have been screaming... Maybe he was getting so used to those nightmares that he didn't get agitated by them anymore. How could he know though, he had been sleeping alone for months...
Harry explained, turning his body fully towards him as he was watching him closely follow the instructions. Unsure of what he was doing and why he was doing it, the blond took a drag, but then immediately started coughing badly. Almost strangling on the smoke. Harry couldn't help but laugh a bit, quickly taking his cigarette back from the boy who was jerking from his cough before he would drop it. He almost went to pat his back, but restrained himself from doing so at the last second. He was still Malfoy after all and it would have been weird...
Something the blond seemed to notice then. Letting go of the smirk, looking sheepish as he bit his lip.
He ended up answering. Waiting for Malfoy's reply once more. But it seemed to take a long time, no new words appearing on the parchment for a while. Making Harry curious, he glanced again, surprised to see the quill still on the desk and no longer in the blond's hand. He was just staring at the paper as well, but with no apparent intention of answering this time. A disappointed look on his face, his hands were fidgeting on his legs. Harry didn't know why, but he felt frustrated to see him like that. He should have been glad that the Slytherin seemed to have given up the idea of having a conversation, but he wasn't. He was finding no joy in seeing him so down. He was even startled to witness such a sad reaction. With a sigh, he instinctively quickly took back his own quill, adding to his previous answer.
Harry finally asked, frowning and suspicious. Like a reflex, his hand had already slipped into the pocket of his sweatshirt to find the reassuring touch of his want. The steel eyes of his enemy seemed to have noticed, observing the pocket before going back to the emerald irises. His lips let out a bitter grin.
Harry sneered coldly and clicked his tongue. Showing openly how finding the blond here bothered him. Also annoyed to have to admit that he was right on that point.
Harry felt his muscles stiffen at the mere sight of the books. They represented a hope that he just couldn’t seem to reach. He didn't want to go back. Walk again where everything ended. Where all this horror occurred. He shivered at the simple thought of it, a knot in his stomach, he felt nauseous.
Instead, he just came a bit closer, so he could also turn and look at the big engraved stone. As he moved, so did the blond, instinctively leaving him some space so they didn't have to stand too close to each others.
His body felt bruised as he painfully stood up. It was night again, but everything seemed oddly clear. He could see the horizon far away, the hills around. Maybe it was only evening then... But the stars were shining too bright for it. It was like hours had melted into one, into a time that isn't supposed to exist.
Harry let his eyes hesitate between his friends for a moment, before finally nodding and getting up. Lowering the hood properly on his head, he followed their legs, which were the last thing to appear under the line of fabric. Blind to the rest, he was breathing heavily but endured. Seeking isolation in his head, he tried to suppress every uncomfortable thought. He imagined landscapes in his mind, with clear and peaceful horizons. It kept him from thinking too much. Disconnecting from reality throughout the rest of the journey to the castle. He felt like an empty body being transported in the carriage, resting in a state of lethargy. If he emptied himself of all emotions, he surely should be able to not feel anxious anymore, right ?
He sent to him. Wondering why he felt like he had to clarify things. Was he hoping to make him feel a bit better ? Fuck, why care ? Why try to keep up with this conversation he didn't even wanted to have ? He was not going to start talking to him just because they shook hands on sharing guilt.
He sent then sighed. What the fuck was he doing ? Being all nice to him... Even just allowing anyone to keep him company.
Ron and Hermione were clearly bewildered by his lack of reaction, but they should have been used to it by now. Harry didn't seem to care about anything anymore. Not even the fact that they would now have to share dorm with Slytherins and especially with their rival.
His fist clenched harder on Malfoy's top, a grey and elegant jacket made of soft fabric, as he also tried to hold his tears. Yelling with distress and outrage. But the blond didn't make any move to remove his hand or fight him. He just stared with a broken gaze. Then suddenly smirked, even laughed a bit, which made Harry's angry eyes open even wider in indignation. Not understanding what he was finding so funny, because he was not aware of how absurd he was sounding. Blinded and rendered deaf by the overwhelming feelings, he couldn't hear himself talk. Claiming for himself the guilt so vividly, like it was a matter of life and death to carry the blame all by himself. Convinced that he was the only one at fault when, actually, so many people had taken part in that war.
He snarled with rage. Glancing with disgust at the wand still held towards him. Harry didn't even move, still half-sitting, half-leaning with his back pressed against the armrest. He was just staring at the blond with unblinking eyes, following his every move with caution.
Ron took a last look at him, his eyes shining with rage. They stared at each other in silence for a moment. Both angry.
He asked suddenly. The blond didn't turn to look at him. His eyes seemed lost on the stone still. And in the grey irises, Harry could see the reflection of the undying fire dance.
A voice suddenly reached him, obviously close to him since he could understand it despite the low tone used. Is body jerked slightly in surprise, looking up to turn his head around and try to find who talked to him. Well, actually he knew exactly who he was looking for. That smooth voice, with a hint of amusement in it, and this choice of words... It could only be him. Finding indeed the blond smirking to his right, sitting at the desk next to his. Also alone. Two empty chairs between them. He was so focused on reducing his vision to a minimum whilst looking for where to sit, he didn't even noticed he was there. Grimacing at the snobby looks on Malofy's face, et growled annoyed. Clenching his teeth.
Every time Harry laid eyes on his friends, he could feel his heart tighten in his chest, the price of the war weighting on his shoulders. All the sacrifices, the mourning. He had won in the eyes of the world, but the boy felt like he had lost everything in return. A heavy outcome. He couldn't help himself but feeling guilty, although he knew he was nothing else but a pawn in this fight. A pawn without will.
It was a difficult one for me to write. I'm not really confident with my english, so I always fear that I would express things badly, so I think it makes me ramble a bit... Making this boring to read.
She answered while sneaking inside, pushing the boy from the doorway as she did, her arms laden with books. Harry felt the uncertainty in her voice despite the light tone she was trying to give herself. He guessed a lie, or at least a very evasive answer that was hiding some other explanation that she was refusing to give him.
Her voice was firm but strangled by a knot in her throat. She couldn't bare it, they had always been a trio and they had faced everything together, been trough so many things, so much darkness and so much joy. She needed both of them in her life, and both of them together. Their bond was supposed to be unbreakable. And she was determined to fix it. It was glowing in her eyes and Harry sighed at that sight.
And it was even harder for him to let go when everybody around was just pretending that it never happened, continuing on with their life with a blindfold just to make themselves feel better. Avoiding the subject, when actually he desperately needed to talk it out. But nobody wanted to hear anymore. So everything was just staying inside of him, rotting and eating him. Global denial, which to him was only pure hypocrisy.
Ron stayed quiet, just looking at his best friend with a figure of despair. Harry could tell he was scared and that he resented him a bit for having fled like he did. Leaving them wondering in anxiety. The redhead was getting tired of the raven haired boy's moods swings, not knowing how to deal with his ups and down. Every time he was starting to hope, thinking Harry was finally getting better, his hopes ended up being crushed even harder.
Now feeling terribly guilty for never having bothered to try to understand the Slytherin, to have continued to believe that the boy might regret the defeat of the party he had seemed to be fighting for.
Harry answered, biting his lip nervously. He could at least give him that. But he knew revenge could take other forms than death. And he couldn't exclude those options yet.
She said as a goodbye, already turning on her heels to respect the Gryffindor's need for space, not wanting to overwhelm him by forcing her presence on him for too long. Gifted with a deep empathy, she was treating Harry like she would have treated a shy baby kitten. Going for a step by step method, even if the steps had to be small. Gently trying to get him used to the presence of others again without rushing him. That was her strength, and she had always been the most clever on how to handle a troubled mind. Unlike many others, she was very understanding and patient, giving Harry exactly what he needed.
Malfoy stated after observing the reddened and swollen eyes of the raven haired boy. It was obvious that he had lost weight since the war, a lot, too much even. His face was dull and his new pale skin brought out the deep dark circles under is eyes.
An unpleasant shiver ran down his spine when he heard the blond sneer at his vehemence. His jaw clenched as he watched him rise to his feet to turn to him again. Against his wand, Harry felt his fingers tighten, he even started to slowly pull it out of his pocket when the Slytherin was bold enough to approach.
But he could feel that she was already considering the half-eaten meal as a victory. When she understood that he was done eating, she pushed a book towards him.
His stare finally got noticed, probably too long and heavy, and Malfoy finally lifted his eyes from the book to look back at him, confused. Question marks in his grey irises as to why Harry was so intensely watching him. But he didn't asked, like he didn't dare break the requested silence,
Hermione hissed, reprimanding her boyfriend. And harry felt grateful. She seemed to respect his need for time, understood his desire to flee. She was already relieved to see him on this platform, ready to go back. She knew how to be content with small victories. Trying hard to be patient and not ask too much of him. Baby steps.
He almost whispered and Malfoy's smile grew wider. Their hectic breaths now almost back to normal. But Harry's heart kept beating too fast. And he couldn't shake the feeling of being uneasy. Nervous, he watched has the Slytherin held out his hand towards him. Looking at the pale skin, his long fingers stretched in waiting. A familiar sight, but the hand in his memory was that of a child. Now the one he was seeing was that of an adult. Much more bigger, also elegant. One that he now wanted to shake. Bringing his darker complexion onto the milky skin to seal the agreement. Discovering that the blond's skin was much more warmer than what he had expected. He had always associated the Slytherin with coldness. But his body seemed even warmer than his. It was also extremely soft.
The Slytherin was content to respond with a bitterness tone and Harry could easily picture the rest of the story.
Biting his lips and dropping his eyes on his feet, he now felt awfully humble. Uneasy as he had allow himself to appear so weak and defeated in front of his old enemy. Worse even, now offering an olive branch. Like a child who was regretting his whim and would bend his back to apologies.
He felt annoyed, raising his eyes towards the ceiling with a growl. Then taking his quill to answers with sharp moves. His handwriting was much more messy, quickly wrote with exasperation.
With a heavy sigh, the blond shook his head before running a hand trough his hair as he looked a bit up towards the sky, as if to hold tears.
They turned their gaze away at the same time, feeling it was becoming too heavy, and Harry observed the tower around him, nervous and unease, not knowing where to look anymore. His throat was dry and he heard Malfoy clear his before talking.
But when the blond turned towards him, it was not with the mocking smirk he was excepting, out of habits. But with a warm soft smile, and a soothing gaze. Harry could almost read relief on his face. And it made him look mesmerizing. Harry would even dare to say pretty, even with that bruise. Just looking at him made him feel safer, and it was the weirdest thing ever.
Ron said, rolling his eyes then looking at Harry who seemed determined to keep his hood down to his nose. At first, he wanted to hide under his invisibility cloak, but Hermione had managed to convince him to leave it in his trunk.
She asked with an inquisitive tone. As if she was scandalized that he stayed in the back of the room. A bit of disappointment also in her voice, her gaze already moralizing. And as she questioned, the answer materialized when Ron walked past them with obvious annoyance. Without even glancing at Harry. Face angry, looking straight in front of him and his pace hasty. The raven haired boy winced. He wanted to sneer, it was so pathetic to see the redhead act that way. So openly mad it looked theatrical.
His steps were wary, holding his breath at each one. He could feel it, like a foreboding, he knew something was waiting for him in the shadow ahead, lurking. He thought he could even hear breathing in the hedgerow surrounding him. Heavy, almost growling. They were coming from all around, he couldn't say were exactly. But he didn't feel alone.
Please, let me know your thoughts in the comments. Do you think my writing is too confusing ? That I ramble too much ? Be honest with me, I want to improve :)
Hermione's voice was loud when she called him with obvious relief, making everybody quiet and turn towards him. He was panting at the door, because he ran. He had lost track of time during his morning walk. And now he felt like he was frozen. Everybody was looking at him, knowing who was under the now useless hood...
He said a bit too softly, trying to calm the Gryffindor who was obviously lost in his frenzy and had no control over it. The Slytherin was, him, clearly aware of the absurdity of the situation. Bewildered by Harry's strong reaction and sudden outburst, still trying to handle it with caution though, as he understood he was probably acting like this because of the trauma. His sudden burst of rage was a clear sign that his mind was still overwhelmed with the shock of the aftermath. Wound still so fresh it would bleed again at the slightest touch.
Harry kept yelling still unable to find control, his green eyes covered in tears that threatens to fall on his cheeks. Stubborn, unable to think straight. Almost panicking. His breathing was hectic.
It was his destiny, but he couldn't stand the thought that his name had become the emblem of this conflict. Praised in every corner of the world. He was in a way flattered by the happiness the freedom had brought, but also he felt stained by the loses it had cost. Condemned to remain still and always the boy with the famous scar, too closely associated with the Dark Lord. He would never be able to turn this page from his story, never become anything more than what he had been in that moment. When he had watched him finally die, yet impregnate him more than ever.
However, has Harry desperately yelled and still tried to catch her, like lightning she had vanished. Dust that flew in a wind the boy couldn't even feel. Dispersing into the air. Leaving nothing but an empty chair and a shaking son, tears filling his eyes. But he had no time to collapse, his dad was still there, and he rushed to his side. But this time, he was careful not to touch him.
Her eyes suddenly got clouded by sadness. The sadness she was usually hiding. Losing control for a brief moment. She always tried hard to look like she was alright, but Harry could now see trough the lies. Frowning as the girl was trying to put her happy mask back on, to chase the melancholy from her face.
He answered now composed. And a heavy silence fell on them as Harry was finding himself staring at the back of the blond's head, listening to his words again in his head. Letting himself slowly get calmer. Until he could feel the rage vanish as quickly as it came. Until he allowed himself to acknowledge how right he was.
Sirius, Dumbledore, Fred, Lupin, Tonks, Dobby and even Snape... Would they all still be alive if he hadn't given a fuck about winning that doomed tournament ? Harry growled in frustration. Too many names on this sinister list.
It was Malfoy's last card. The last attempt he could make and he hoped it was enough the clear him from the suspicion.
He sighed sadly, making the Gryffindor feel compassion. Which only made him more confused... He would have never thought that he was actually jealous of him... Seeing him brag all the time, act all superior with his petty manners. He was hiding that jealousy so well. But also, he was so wrong... If he really had it good, he wouldn't be so dead inside now, mourning all those loses... Feeling so guilty. Wishing that he could have stayed dead. To him, that was not having it good. It was just having it bad in a different way. This time, looking at the blond with an open mind, he could feel his honesty and it was troubling him. That honesty, the one he was craving for all those months spent stuck with his best friends full of bullshits, he never thought he would find it in his old enemy. Feeling now awkwardly connected to him in a way he couldn't describe yet. As if he was the only one who was getting it, who's company wasn't suffocating.
It was hard to keep track of time during the night. Everything was just pitch black, he couldn't refer himself to the changing of light. The movements of the moon were his only reference. It was a bit down on his left when he had arrived here, now it was a bit higher and just in front of him. Slowly getting on the right side. So he knew, time had passed, he just had no idea how much.
. The thing they looked so scared to tell him. Strangely tough, Harry didn't seem to care. He was even a bit disappointed by the news, he was expecting something terrible, seeing how anxious his friend were acting.
He knew the way by heart, so his steps were automatics by now. So much that he barely realized he had arrived when he got up the stairs and entered the tower.
All this seemed very useless to him. Hermione was striving to make up for their missed year, passing their exams by owl thanks to a special permission. All that so they could simply go back to Hogwarts and keep on as if their life had never been interrupted. As if they could forget so easily, pretend and just move on.
He said with a chill in his voice. Sounding uncomfortable as well and hasty to bring up any conversation that could distract them from this awkward mood.
The Slytherin informed. Trying to make him think, for once, and realize that, after a war like this, there was no way he would be here if he was still representing a danger. And therefore, that it should be pretty obvious that he's sincere in his wish to become a better person.
On the cold floor, he curled up into a small ball, body jerking from all the tears. His fist clenched.
He could hear a low chuckle behind him as he walked slowly, not even knowing where he was heading actually. To the lake, or maybe the forest. Wherever, as long as he could be alone to cry.
Slowly getting down the spiral stairs on his tiptoes, he was surprised to discover a light coming from the common room when it should have been pitch black at this hour. It was a warm flickering light, and the sound of flames eating wood told him it was coming from the fire. There was only a few steps left but he stopped himself for a second. It probably meant someone was still there, and he was clearly trying to avoid any encounter. Biting his lips anxiously, he then tried to look into the room as best as he could from where he was standing, not revealing himself, he even made the lumos spell disappear. But, surprisingly, there was no one to be seen. The couches were all empty, and there was not a single sound except from those coming from the fire.
He said coldly to the girl who looked up at him. This wasn't the first time they were having this conversation, Harry had already tried many times to take the idea of coming here out of her head. But she was stubborn. Perhaps more than Ron whose determination he felt was getting weaker over the weeks. And now, he seemed to have finally decided to give up entirely. Maybe he was actually the smartest one out of the two, maybe he had realized that saving Harry Potter was a mission doomed to fail.
The question sounded stupid to Harry. It had only been a bit more than four months since the war was over, and this war had been all of his life. How was he supposed to have moved on so quickly ? Everything he was, everything he had lived was entangled with this fight. It had made him, defined him. It was such a big piece of him that without it he felt like nothing was left of him.
He whispered like he was on delay. Like he hadn't heard the last of what Harry had said. But finally remembering his godson. Stretching a hand trough the bars, he softly stroked a dirty hand on the boy's cheek. And Harry pushed his face in the touch a bit more. Feeling tears escaping his eyes again. The palm was cold and smelly, but he couldn't care less. His godfather was here again, he could feel him and it's all he wanted. Putting his hand on his, he pressed.
He beseeched her. His heart already getting faster with the anxiety from the mere thought of them breaking up because of him. Thinking that his state of mind could be toxic to them was destroying the little self esteem he had left. He was nothing but poison, even now. Hating himself, a living burden and disappointment. Which was exactly why he was better alone. Nobody should have to endure him, the chosen one was nothing more than the bringer of misery.
And then suddenly he was hit. Water fell hard on him and he got carried away by a giant wave. Struggling underwater, his body rocking with the current. Until he was pushed on sand, the wave retreated and he was left stranded on a shore.
The Gryffindor tried to discreetly glance on his right again as the answer came, but was then startled when his eyes met the blond's stare. Looking less miserable but truly curious. His gaze so strong, as if he was trying to just read the answer in the emerald eyes, Harry had to quickly look away, it was making him nervous.
But so close to losing her, he realized only now what true loneliness meant. He thought he had it already, but he was wrong. He only had some, but she was still there to prevent him from being eaten wholly by it. Even when she was annoying or pushing him too much, she was there to keep the small sparkle of life in his heart. So it wouldn't go completely cold and just stop beating. Actually he felt so grateful towards her now. He had kept pushing her away but the truth was he needed her to stay. And so far she had. Even if she was well aware she was often bothering him, she never gave up on saving him.
It was too much for him to endure, he felt ready to collapse. A turmoil in his mind, blurred lines between reality and dream. He was feeling dizzy from the pain. Stumbling as he started walking backward, but then suddenly he fell. Right into a hole he hadn't seen behind him.
Harry shrugged, clearly not willing to ear Malfoy's justifications and blinding himself to his, pretty obvious though, innocence. Still letting his gut feelings control him, instead of using his brain.
The Gryffindor asked and it made Malfoy turn away from the window to look at him. Grey eyes full of hurt and disappointment.
He sounded sure of himself, of the idea that they could somehow match together. Willing to built something with his old enemy, their now broken soul as a base for something new. Harry brought his gaze back to him. He had not a single trace of pride left on his face and it was really astonishing. He couldn't get used to it, seeing Malfoy bare of the cold mask he had always wore before, kept even when he had found him crying in the toilets during the sixth year. Now he was offering himself completely, plain honest with desperate and begging eyes. It was so troubling Harry still had a hard time believing it was true. He could trust that Malfoy was never really evil, never wanted the life that was forced on him. But him looking for what seemed to be friendship ? It was just too weird.
Harry tried to make his voice soft, but it was hoarse from his sobbing, quivering with his anxiety of not knowing what was happening, and hasty from his desire to find his way out of here.
Harry said, acknowledging his lack of efforts towards the blond. Why would he have made some anyways ? At the time, things seemed so well established between them. Deadly enemies, two perfect opposites. Now all of this seemed to have lost its meaning.
The latter seemed to consider the information, slowly nodding his head, still inexpressive. Lost in a thought.
He had to ask, curious. Still confused by the simple fact that the blond asked him if he was okay, acting like he was caring all the sudden. And especially, looking sad that Harry didn't seem to care for him as well.
He spluttered in confusion, he felt like he was a child again, like he hadn't learn how to think or how to speak yet. With distress he took a few step back then dropped on his knees because the heaviness of the emotions was crushing him. And all the sudden, his dad was able to get up. Walking slowly to his son who was now panting on all fours and struggling with tears, he kneeled before him.
He whispered, shivering from the feeling of confusion. The blond grinned, grey eyes suddenly getting alive with a sparkle of mischief. Harry hadn't really tried to push him away, hadn't deny the feeling of understanding between them. So he took it as a none spoken agreement, that he was willing too, to accept his company.
Harry pointed and Malfoy was left bewildered. He hadn't even think of that option, and he wondered why, because it was indeed a pretty obvious solution. And it was absolutely destroying his attempt at proving that he was deprived of ill intentions.
Staying still, he was focusing on his breathing to prevent himself from thinking to much. Listening to the wind brushing the trees afar, the high pitch sound of some bats sometimes mixing into it, the buzzing of an insect, the disturbing scream of a fox and the pages being turned behind him. At first he counted them, then he had lost track around thirty. But he noticed that Malfoy seemed to be a fast reader, the sound was almost like a tempo. Constant and punctual. He almost had figured it out by now and could nearly predict the exact second he would hear him turn a page again. He wondered about what he was reading, because, if he trusted his fast and steady pace, it seemed like something really captivating. He guessed a fiction, because nobody could read a textbook that fast and seem so much into it, except Hermione... Sometimes he could even hear his breath hitch, as if something really exciting was happening in his book, making him on edge.
Ron finally said in a weak voice, it seemed like he was almost pleading. And Harry could feel his stomach sink. An overwhelming sadness at the thought that his best friend, or former, couldn't bring himself to just say sorry, after all they had been through. A simple word that even Malfoy had managed to say... Was the redhead's pride more important than him ? Suddenly, everything seemed like a lie to Harry. All his memories rotten in his head. Was it all fake ? And was it truly over now ? He knew he was to blame for the distance, but now that things were concrete, he realized that he knew even less who he's supposed to be without them. And as that true and deep loneliness was now hitting him, he wondered what was the point of going on then ? Hidden like a ghost under his cloak, so close and yet not a part of them anymore, this was the reality than turned into a living metaphor. Ironic, and painful.
With a pain in his stomach Harry looked at him for a bit, until he heard the door open again. Now was his chance, and this time he was going to take it. So he waited for the person to enter, then quickly sliped trough the portrait before it would close again.
She joked and it made him successfully grin a bit more. For a minute he remembered the moment she was referring too. Back then, they weren't as close as they are now, it was only the birth of their friendship. They were just kids, still unaware of the hardships that would come to them. Innocent. Looking at her now, he couldn't help but think of how much they've grown up since then. Way too fast. But she turned into the most beautiful soul. And he was feeling so proud of her.
James suddenly said, with a cold tone filled with bitterness. And harry could feel the words hit his heart like a curse, gripping it and enclosing it tightly. Painfully. He couldn't even breathe. His mouth gapped in shock, eyes so wide his eyeballs could have just dropped out of their socket.
It seemed to be a very simple and obvious reason to her. But how could she still be seeing him as a friend ? He was just a selfish coward now, the boy who had been ignoring all of them. Why wasn't she blaming him ? It was driving him mad.
Now in his safe zone, he finally removed his cloak, holding it with an arm, already looking for his cigarettes in his back pocket as he was walking to the balcony.
Malfoy said he was sorry. Harry kept on replaying the word in his head, less and less sure that he had heard properly. Because it really was unbelievable. He couldn't help but wonder if it was a trick and if maybe the blond was playing a new sick game with him.
Malfoy had just told him he was sorry... That was something he would surely have to process for a while before knowing what to do of it.
Not looking up when he sometimes crossed paths with people, he kept on walking, resolved, until he met the fresh air. Breathing in the smell of rain on stone and grass. He didn't even realized it was raining during the night. But he loved that smell, earth and dusty. A smell that seemed to fit his mind. Wet and grim.
This time the shout was very clear, and very close. And, in a sudden burst, Harry opened his eyes. He was back in the common room, to the real world. And Malfoy was bent above him, shaking him.
He just said flatly. Sure, this place was holding one of the heaviest maybe, but it was of no difference to him anymore. He still could enjoy the high view, the wind blowing strong at that height. So up above he could forget about all the other people downstairs, pretend like they were in complete different places and that he was truly alone. Or almost.
Hermione cleared her throat then sat up suddenly, heading for the stove, she filled a kettle with water and placed it on the fire. It seemed like an excuse to avoid facing him and buy time to gather her thoughts.
... Malfoy never actually asked him to feel no guilt at all actually, just to stop taking the whole blame... And he was the first who allowed him to feel bad. Showed somehow some respect for it... Everybody else kept telling him he shouldn't feel guilty at all. But he... never said such thing. Fuck, Harry really couldn't get used to this feeling, that of being thankful towards Malfoy. He quickly shook his head to try to get rid of it and clear his head before new words appeared.
The Slytherin answered in a weak voice and Harry could almost hear the knot in his throat. Air filled with a strange warmth that had nothing to do with the now dying fire. Although, it felt too heavy. Making him break a slight smile.
The Weasleys were all there too. Standing in a row in front of him, their feet resting on nothing concrete. Between him and them, Ron was sitting in the void, leaning on his brother's body. He was holding Fred on his leg, hugging his corpse as he cried. Then his gaze came up to meet Harry's as he got back up on his feet, and the redhead face twisted in anger at his sight. Eyes full of rage and despise. Harry couldn't breath anymore. He was shaking again. Shaking his head in denial. Guilt burning him inside.
The Gryffindor took some time to think. The last argument had troubled his mind, in a good way. He couldn't deny that, that day, the blond had indeed saved his life against all odds. And the conditions for Malfoy's return were truly strict, maybe enough to make him believable. Being watched so closely, it would indeed be hard for him to get revenge. But the Slytherin was smart, Harry had to admit that fact. Surely, even so limited, he would find a way to get revenge, if that's what he was after. And Harry had to be honest with himself.. so actually, no he couldn't trust him just yet. Not fully. Even if he had claimed he did the day before. He was still fearing his own naivety.
Ron was trying to defend his cause. But his tone was lacking so much conviction it seemed like he was trying to persuade himself more than her.
Harry added before she got a chance to say anything, already knowing she would ask how he knew about it anyway.
Her sternness had already gone, again she was only dreamy, her voice like a lullaby. Smiling in her daze, as if she was lost in a world made of cotton. Making everything around her soft, and even the cold boy's heart.
The Slytherin seemed at a loss of words hearing that. Looking at Harry with widened eyes and an open mouth, his breath on hold. The Gryffindor seemed to notice he was even shaking a bit. Dropping his eyes with remorse as the blond took a minute to take it in.
Sirius smiled with blackened teeth and giggled. Like this he looked properly crazy. Removing his hand from Harry, he stepped back.
The blond conceded as he came leaning next to Harry with a heavy sigh. And the Gryffindor then took a glance. He looked unease. Fingers fidgeting in the void above the railing. Probably swarmed with memories. Harry could understand, he remembered vividly too... The atrocity he was asked to commit, but also how he was unable to do it in the end.
Wondering about what he actually wanted from life now, he was looking at the dark horizon. A see of trees eaten by the night, and the moon shining trough thin clouds. Thick enough to hide the starts though. So actually, there wasn't much to look at. His gaze getting lost in the horizon, he was leaning on the railing, a cigarette between his fingers, smoke catching the faint moonlight making it glow, when a voice came in.
Hermione's voice broke. Harry watched her as she lowered her head. He heard the knot in her throat, her breathing quivered as she tried to control herself. He felt almost guilty to be relieved to hear this sad story, to feel his friend weaken like this. Evoking her own losses, her own consequences. Because, for a moment, she wasn’t pretending anymore. And even if he felt the guilt gnawing at him, Harry felt like he could touch again, even from the tip of his fingers, the link that used to make them so unite. That link that had gotten so superficial and fragile since the war.
Harry stiffened when he heard the applause swell, his name being sung. He stopped, eyes wide open in panic.
He felt terribly small and fragile facing this memorial which had the effect of a blade going straight to his chest. His legs were wobbly and he avoided the fall only thanks to Ron who, feeling him weaken all the sudden, quickly passed a hand around his waist and grabbed his shoulder by the other to support him.
Ron insisted, in a tone less annoyed than the one he had recently gotten used to take. Maybe Hermione's scolding had finally gotten to him.
He whispered, turning his anxious green eyes towards her. He had accepted to go back, but now that he was there, he was convinced, more than ever, that this was a mistake. He didn't believe that he could do it. Incapable of being around all those people who suffered because of him. Of returning to the scene of the battle, probably haunted by memories. His eyes were almost imploring the brunette, he wanted her to give him her blessing and allow him to give up and leave. But she still seemed determined to drag him back to Hogwarts. To force him to resume to the course of his life. She took the seat in front of him.
He finally said and Harry couldn't help but smile a little. Thinking of how good Malfoy must be at acting if it was all a lie. And finding him still able to subtly praise himself even it that vulnerable state.
Malfoy shouted, almost playful again. And Harry couldn't help but smirk, finding it funny how the blond seemed to care for him to be on time.
He said in a low grumpy and sheepish voice. Feeling like he was giving up on what little was left of his pride.
The room was now empty, only Harry was left crying on the ground. When suddenly the day turned to night, and screams came from outside. Many voices were mingling in fear and pain. But the night was full of light, for the village seemed to be on fire when he glanced at the windows.
The boy's eyes widened as Sirius was still walking backward in the direction of the veil. He pulled at the bars with all of his strength, not caring if he had to break is arms.
Hi breathing stopped and he dared to look up only to freeze instantly when he discovered a memorial standing in the centre of the courtyard. Built from a wreck, a huge stone that recalled the partial destruction of the castle that night. Standing tall in the middle of a circle of fire that was never to be extinguished. Enchanted to last forever, bright and fierce. On the surface of the stone was engraved the names of all those who fell for freedom that day, covering the whole front. The letters were shining with a dim light in them. He felt a knot in his stomach, a sudden urge to throw up. His vision soon became blurred. He didn't even realized he had squeaked in shock.
He questioned with annoyance, looking at Malfoy with eyes filled with irritation. Wide, as to warn him not to push it.
He begged her to stop trying. It was hurting him more actually. He needed to mourn their friendship and, for that to happen, he had to completely allow himself to let it go. Not hang on to it with the hope she was trying to give him.
He screamed in a frenzy, not able to contain himself. Eyes watery with fury. Startled by his vivid reaction, the blond almost jumped back. Looking at him first with confusion before letting a sneer escape his lips. Smirking, he now looked annoyed. Raising one eyebrow, Harry felt like he was actually meeting his old cunning nemeses again. And he knew from experience and from that look he knew too well, that he was not going to shut up.
He admitted. And even though he sounded exasperated, the words went straight to Harry's heart with relief. So he still cared... It actually felt good to hear, making the boy realize that, hiding behind the anger, this whole situation had actually brought him more pain than he thought. He was missing Ron, even if he had had a hard time admitting it. He wanted so badly to believe that he didn't need anyone... But this whole loneliness thing was actually starting to feel heavy.
He asked rising his eyebrows. Harry actually didn't even realize he was still holding onto his wand. Shaking his head, he quickly put it in the pocket of the hoody he was still wearing, since he didn't even care to get undressed before going to bed yesterday. Noticing then that Malfoy was also still wearing his clothes.
Not caring to comment on how wrong Malfoy was to think he had it good... Because there was no need to start explaining all the reasons, make him understand why he shouldn't have been jealous of him. He didn't want to talk about it. It was too painful, and too personal. Even if he could feel their relation soften, this kind of talk required intimacy and trust. Two things they still didn't have.
But the ladder didn't reach back. He kept looking, with a wicked smile now forming on his lips. Behind his shoulder came Lucius. He whispered in his son's ear but oddly Harry could hear.
So far, it didn't seem so bad, but Harry knew that it wasn't all of it, so he stayed quiet as he waited to hear to rest.
He stood up and left the embrace of his best friend, then discovering Hermione looking at them with a slight smile. Tender and moved. The one she always wore every time she witnessed them reconcile. Even though they hadn't really quarrelled, they had certainly started to move away from one another. It was obviously not an embrace that would restore everything and stabilize their relationship, making it as it once was, but, since the war, they had learned not to be greedy. Knowing how to appreciate ever small victory for what it was. Every little step.
He cried out. Forgetting for a moment he didn't have his wand on him, he quickly went for his pocket, fidgeting hastily. Ready to blow that door open. But then he remembered, and it was still missing. He felt overwhelmed with despair. He had to free him, and feeling unable to do so was killing him.
Harry spat out with despise, adamant, fidgeting under the blond to try to free himself, hands pressing painfully on the boy's wrists. But Malfoy only clenched harder, bending a bit more to get his face, twisted with anger, closer to the Gryffindor's.
He wasn't ready to face the stares, to let his eyes meet the gaze of all those people. He wished to hide in an enclosed space, a place he would be the only one to have access to. Somewhere far away from this crowd that was teeming on the platform.
Frowning, he carefully questioned, suspicious of what a Lovegood family secret might be, and she laughed a bit.
He closed his eyes, enjoying the emptiness of the room and the silence. But then he heard the door, and steps coming towards him. Someone sat on his bed, he felt the weight sinking into the mattress next to him.
The Slytherin stopped him with a sudden shout. Harry froze but didn't turn around. He just waited there to listen to what he had to say.
He asked surprised. He hadn't seen him since their fight the other night in the common room, and it had been over two weeks now. The Slytherin never came back here after that, never tried to talk to him again or bother him in class. He had kept his distances, stayed silent. To a point were Harry had been confused to be frustrated by that. Sometimes finding himself looking at the papers on his desk, hoping to see words appear on one of it. Because Malfoy had a perk, he was actually good distraction. And he wasn't making Harry feel sadness and pain. Which was all the Gryffindor could feel when he looked at his friends now. But the blond was the only one able to make him feel something different... Annoyance.
Harry's throat suddenly felt tight, he opened his eyes to discover the platform whose sight used to warm his heart. Back then it was his favourite moment, the one where he was finally feeling home. Relieved to be back, to find haven. But now, the platform seemed to defy him, and he could feel his body shudder at its sight.
Sirius continued, talking but looking absent. Empty eyes. A body moving slowly until he reached the veil. Going trough the dark shimmer that ate his body. And just like that, Harry's godfather was gone, once more.
Harry retorted in a childish way. Getting up on his feet, now straightening his trousers before moving to pick up his wand. Keeping it in his hand but no longer pointing it towards the blond.
Finally out, he took his usual path to the astronomy tower. His head replaying over and over the conversation he had just heard as he was walking. Distracted and confused, everything seemed hard to process.
He almost jumped out of his chair when suddenly a ripped parchment appeared on the blank one he was admiring. Something wrote on it. Handwriting so elegant he knew who it was from without even having to read it yet. Turning then his head towards the blond with furrowed brows, shaking lightly his head as to ask what was the matter. He felt bothered. But Malfoy's straight face only answered by pointing his chin towards Harry's desk, where the little paper was still waiting to be read.
She simply suggested, stopping there their conversation. She knew that it was useless to insist. The boy was as stubborn as her. She could only hope that he would eventually change his mind someday. But she also understood that she would not be able to force him to do so. She couldn't push positivity into him. Harry had to do this work by himself, no matter how much she tried to reassure him. She just hoped he knew that he was not alone.
He quickly added, a bit louder as he was still holding the flask. Confused about the name of it, he had already forgotten.
Her speech left Harry disconcerted. But he needed that. he nodded silently and gave in because he understood. Yes, he understood this time, and Hermione's words awoken something in him. He who couldn't find any meaning left in life, who couldn't even understand why he was still breathing. She managed to remind him of something he had forgotten. This friendship that united them. The love he felt for his friends. Despite the shame Harry felt towards them, he didn't want to lose them, or cause them any more pain.
He stated calmly, still smirking. It was now Harry's turn to study him head to toe. A fire starting to burn in his eyes as the frustration was getting bigger. He hated to think that way, but Malfoy was actually smart, even if he was trying to pretend he was not... He had always been quick witted, always had the clever answers. With his elegant way of talking, he only needed words to appear superior. A skill really... Always so sly... Harry wished he could talk that well, outsmart him. But he couldn't. Conversation had never been his forte. Dropping then his head a bit, in small defeat.
He bragged a bit. It was nice to be the one in that position for once, like a little harmless payback for all the times Malfoy had bragged about all the nice things his father had bought him or his quidditch team.
The memorial looked heavy, and the black haired boy instantly felt like it was crushing him. Mouth dry, he was trying hard not to let his body shake in front of the Slytherin. Focusing so his green eyes wouldn't get watery. But he couldn't hide his discomfort very well, his muscles were stiff and his breath stayed on hold. His eyes were caressing the glowing names in a disarray. So many, too many, names. He could feel the knot in his throat, so tight. In his head he was facing a turmoil of emotions, all too strong but he didn't want to let any of them out in front of Malfoy. He kept it in. Shivering but fighting the urge to drop on his knees to cry. It was stupid though, why did he even care about keeping the last of his dignity in front of the blond ? He shouldn't. Because he didn't matter... If they were neither enemies nor friends, it then meant they were now nothing to each other. Right ? So he shouldn’t bother about saving appearances and fearing to be judge by him because, anyway, the Slytherin had lost his power here, and with it, the use of dirty information on Harry. Which he would have used in the past to mock him, spread the word to destroy his reputation.
The man shouted with a dazed voice. A voice Harry could recognize even if it was mingled between millions.
She whined, rendered hopeless. Her brown eyes staring into the green ones with a begging gaze. Harry avoided it, shaking his head, he looked away.
He simply said, his voice deprived of emotions as he passed again near him to reach the woods and resume the path to the castle.
He had to admit, again, he must have been pretty annoying, acting like a know-it-all hero, like he was better than everyone else. Because he had a destiny. That fucking destiny... What a joke.
Harry finally talked, breaking the heavy silence. And Malfoy felt relieved. It made him smirk to hear that same old exasperation in Potter's voice. It was familiar, and to that he knew well how to answer.
The Slytherin dropped it like a bomb and something suddenly triggered in Harry. Now, he could no longer prevents his body from shaking. Clenching his fists, his face twisting with anger. The words had hit him with brutality. Because, he, actually did die trying, and worst, now he also had to keep on living with that fucking blood, on HIS hands. Hearing Malfoy say such things, without even being able to truly understand, made him burst into rage. He had no rights.
The girl sighed, placing her fingers on her forehead as if she had a headache. Closing her eyes, she took an annoyed deep breath.
He stated. For now, loneliness was what he enjoyed the most. Nobody to look at him, talk to him. Bother him. Annoy him with fake smiles, or to tell him how to feel.
When he came back to the kitchen, his hair still wet dripping on his fresh clothes, Hermione had finished making tea. He found beside his mug a plate filled with two toasts spread with jam. He looked at the breakfast prepared for him without much conviction. He didn't remember his last meal, yet he didn't feel hungry at all. The girl had already resumed to her studies, her nose in her book, a quill scratching a sheet of paper next to it. Her eyes swiftly moved to Harry, then to the plate.
She started, but Harry was not ready to hear. He knew her, so he knew she was about to say nice things, things he didn't deserve. He didn't even deserve the smile she was giving him. He only deserved anger and blame. So he cut her short.
As he moved forward, he eventually came upon a crossroad. He could still continue straight forward, or turn left or right. Three choices, and he had no idea which one was the good one.
He said pointing at a sofa, then nodding to say goodbye as he walked towards it to sit. But, at his surprise, Malfoy didn't head to the Slytherin's stairs, instead he came to stand behind the couch was sitting on.
He mumbled to himself, looking again at the potion. He didn't really know what to do of it yet. He was still perplex about it's effect. But still, he kept it, putting it in his back. Maybe someday it would be useful.
Eyes on the black sky above him, he finally saw a silhouette appear on the edge. Platinum blond hair looking down at him. And for the first time in his dream, Malfoy was a symbol of hope. He could feel life flowing trough his veins again. Struggling on the corpses, Harry tried to get up one more time, holding himself on the wall of dirt to desperately reach a hand out to the Slytherin.
The rest of the day was uneventful. And it had seemed painfully long to Harry. He had just sat in silence in the back of the classes all day, waiting for the hours to go by, and escaped the meals by wandering. Like a shadow trough the castle, he was feeling like a ghost. Still there but with no meaning to it.  He had no future to look forward to, no goals anymore. What was he now anyway ? He had accomplished his destiny, met his purpose. So what was left ? He had never thought of that after part, because he had never thought he would have one. All of his life, he had only been focused on ending
He answered in with an amused voice, and Harry could feel he was feeling smart right now. Already moving his gaze back to the stone as if he was trying to read all the names on it, not disturbed by the presence of the Gryffindor.
They both stayed silent after that. Staring gently and amused at each other for a long time, until it was too much and became uncomfortable to the point where Harry could feel himself blush a bit. And he could see Malfoy's pale cheeks turn a soft pink too. But it was just a blush out of awkwardness, nothing more, for sure. They had been staring for so long it was turning into a strange analyse of one another, that's all it was.
Harry asked with an inquisitive tone, whishing more than anything that she could finally be honest with him and allow him to see her scars and pain.
Harry shouted, powerless. Dropping on his knees, sobbing like a baby once more. He screamed until he could feel his lungs burn. The burning from the memory he was reminded of. How his stupidity killed the last of his family. Because yes, he had been naive. And it was all his fault, and his fault only. The price of failure, of thinking wrongly he knew better than all of them. Because he was the chosen one, the one they had to follow. Follow to their death...
Harry had rarely heard such anger in Hermione's voice even though she had to keep it low. It was actually even more frightening, this growling irritation. Sure, they were used to being scolded by her, but never with such a deep disappointment, such raw and cold reproaches. He saw how Ron suddenly felt small in front of her, curling up in his seat, his head getting even lower. His hands were fidgeting on his laps, one thumb scratching the other.
He shot his words to him, loosing control. His fists clenched and his voice rose uncontrollably. His anger now echoing on the surface of the lake. He knew he should shut up, not tell him about his panic attack. However, he seemed unable to stop and kept on going.
Lily called, struggling as she was still trying to get up. Eyes filled with despair, she held out her hand to him, and Harry had to get out of his state of shock to run to her. Reaching for his mom's hand... but as he just touched it, the flesh turned to ashes. Consuming then her arm, shoulder, chest... Unstoppable.
Ron was startled, looking at her in dismay. The threat was after all heavy, and even Harry felt his heart get alarmed by it. This was a nightmare for him, to hear Hermione suggesting she could break up with Ron, over him, when he had asked her not to. He had caused enough pain, and causing more was his worst fear. Now it seemed that, even without the war, he was still breaking things around him, causing others misfortune. He was definitely no hero, just a living curse... Only good for destruction.
He shouted as he suddenly grabbed Malfoy's collar to shake him, pointing towards the stone with his other hand.
The Slytherin offered a meek smile and went to sit in another sofa. Careful to not invade Harry's space.
He just answered, still not caring to give him details about his whereabouts. Sharing guilt didn't make them friends yet.
He replied on a bitter calm tone as his eyes lingered on the blond's hand, still massaging his forearm, where Harry knew the dark mark was. Misinterpreting the gesture as proof of his allegiance.
Harry questioned, holding tighter and even pulling him closer so the tip of his wand would be pressed directly onto the skin. Affirming his dominance. Malfoy winced and threw his head back to break the contact against his neck.
Ron growled, shaking his head before getting on his feet. He had reached his limit and this time Hermione was not here to calm him and refrain him from speaking his mind.
She said, not even looking back, before turning the corner of the hallway, leaving him alone once more.
He answered flatly to hide the pain of having to say such a thing. She was smart, and for sure Ron had told her about their altercation, so she should have had figured it out by herself and not bother him with the subject.
He also took this opportunity to isolate himself, the air becoming too heavy in the kitchen. Under the hot shower, he closed his eyes, tried to breathe slowly to calm down. But in reality, he just wanted to scream. Since that precise moment where everything stopped in the courtyard, he had been holding that urge to scream in his throat. And it was eating him.
But tonight, things went a bit differently. Has he got down the stairs to the common room, there he saw Hermione sitting with Ron at a table near the door. At first he meant to ignore them, keep up with his routine and just leave, but then he overheard them as he walked closer, carefully on the tip of his toes to not make any noise. The conversation seamed like a heated one, even though they were trying to keep it low. But Harry could see fire in Hermione's eyes.
Malfoy suddenly started to talk again. Calmly this time. In doing so, inviting Harry to truly listen to him and his arguments.
Harry looked down, staring at his shoes. Could he really accept the idea of feeling compassion for his enemy ? He bit his lip, lost in thought.
When did he fall asleep ? Harry had no idea. Exhausted by all these strong emotions, his body must have shut down while he was crying. For sure, it was before everyone else came to sleep, because he was still alone. Nobody came in. They were all partying in the common room, probably until late, happy to see each other again. He guesses they also must have been talking about him, about his panic attack in the great hall. Not understanding why he became so anxious, why he didn't greet anyone and was staying alone. He could easily imagine the conversations... But he didn't care. He didn't need for them to understand. He just didn't want to be bothered by anyone.
Ron said, dropping his head to look at his knees. Even though the statement was close to a whisper, it was clear enough. Cold, without hesitations. And even if Harry knew it already, hearing the confirmation from Ron's lips was more painful than death itself. It was not just him speculating anymore, assuming over anger. It was real, a concrete conclusion. Feeling the pain in his whole body, he closed his eyes as he felt a tear fall, his throat tightening. Trying to swallow his saliva that seemed too thick without making any noise.
The words seemed hard to get out, his voice hurting to draw this self portrait that was definitely not flattering. It was true that the image of Malfoy was deplorable and certainly difficult to change. It was almost like he had the words: 'public enemy' tattooed on his forehead. And his arm wearing the now faded mark would still remain an eternal reminder of his past mistakes. No one would ever be able to forget... And if so, those who could actually forgive would surely be rare.
He pushed his tongue in his cheek in annoyance, stopping himself a few steps away from him. Staring, hands still in his front pocket, but this time not holding onto his wand.
The blond whispered obediently, pushing himself away from the railing to go sit on one of the two curved steps inside. Rummaging into his bag to pick up a book, keeping quiet, he simply started to read while Harry stayed a bit longer leaning on the railing. His cigarette all smoked up, he made it vanish. Watching the tip consumed into thin air, turning into ashes that got captured by the strong wind. He followed them, hypnotized, until he couldn't see them anymore in the darkness. They flew away and all that was left was the smell tainting his hoodie.
Dropping his quill, he decided to try and focus on the class. But he was so lost in the lesson, not having listened to a single word of it, that he quickly gave up. Back to staring his page still blank. Knowing, it was going to be a long toilsome year...
What an interesting way of seeing things... but Harry rolled his eyes. Yet he couldn't deny, the familiar banter was indeed in a way soothing. A crumb of something the war hadn't destroy it seemed. And it wasn't full of hate like before, it was more perky now. A fight turned into an innocent game, a desperate need to hold on to something stable.
Cedric said again, low this time, sounding possessed by a need for power. A small creepy smile on his lips, he was breathing fast. Hypnotized by the object that would give him glory.
He only went back in time for the fourth class, after a quick shower to remove the sweat and clear his head. He spent the rest of the day siting in the back. But getting lost in thoughts too easily, he was unable to follow any of the lessons. Malfoy didn't bother him with notes anymore though.
He asked. The boy seemed so lost, sad and lonely. Eaten by torments, like him. How could this be freedom ?
Then the ground started to shake, and the delicate wallpaper was now dripping with blood coming out of it. The air became suffocating and hot as the room was starting to fill with smoke.
Malfoy asked at a loss, not really knowing how it worked. He was just looking confusingly at the thing held between his long and elegant fingers as if it was a puzzle. And it was almost endearing to see him so bewildered by a simple cigarette. The boy who always had so much assurance and would brag about being the best at everything suddenly looked like a lost kid in need of teaching. Truly vulnerable.
After what seemed like hours of staying up against the railing, Harry finally turned around and went back inside. The night was getting chilly and his legs painful from staying still for so long. The moon was now completely on the right side of the tower, but the clouds were getting thicker and darker and it's light was slowly being killed by them. Making the horizon even darker, he couldn't even see the forest anymore. He went to sit on the stairs too, at the opposite side of Malfoy. There he watched him, but the blond didn't even glance back. He was completely absorbed by his story it seemed. Eyes moving fast and getting wide, then frowning. Sometimes his lips were moving along the words he was reading, without a sound being made. Harry looked at the book he was so devoted to, a black cover with only the title written in silver on it.
He explained with a bitter tone. He knew it was bound to happen anyway, he had been expecting it. Every day, wondering if that one would be the last, the one were Ron would finally loose completely the little patience he had. He was actually expecting it so much that, for a brief moment he even felt glad when the redhead told him to fuck off. Because he was proven right, it was almost like a victory. And he felt relief, it was done and he could stop wondering now. Stop waiting for the bomb to explode. But then, he felt guilty for having such thoughts.
Ron sighed at his best friend's defeatism. Too clumsy to know how to deal with it properly. He was just tired of it. In return, he received a dark glare from his girlfriend. Harry heard them bickering in a low voice without actually listening. His mind already lost elsewhere, absent. He contemplated his anguish and the terrifying idea that, in a few hours, he would be standing in the courtyard again.
He brought his green eyes back to his friend. As always, she was putting on a smile. A smile so fake that it pained Harry to see it. She didn't tire of trying, but that was exactly why Harry was getting annoyed. Upset to see her always try so hard to pretend like everything was fine. When nothing was. Like he should still be protected from the truth, the chosen one that must be handled with care. That must be kept away from problems and worries. Because he had suffered enough already, hadn't he ? But he didn't like this special treatment, at all. He who had always wanted to be an ordinary boy amongst the others.
He thought to himself but kept the words in. Not wanting to start a fight. He already fought too much in his life, he was tired of even arguing. Didn't have the energy for it anymore. He just desperately wanted to find some peace. And so, with a heavy sigh, he then let himself fall on the couch, keeping a safe distance from the blond who looked at him moving with round eyes. Surprised to see him take a sit next to him, even if it was at the opposite side of the sofa. An awkward silence settled in as they both directed their gaze towards the fire still burning. Getting lost in the flames, Harry tried hard to find the feeling of quiet loneliness he was looking for. Even if he was too aware of the Slytherin next to him... he focused on the silence and the warmth, doing his best as to ignore the presence. And, after some time, he surprisingly managed to feel somehow at ease, even if he still could hear the boy's low breathing next to him. He even felt thankful that his old enemy wasn't trying to keep a conversation and was allowing him that quiet moment. As if they both needed that silence. It was almost soothing, and the room filled with a strange feeling of understanding. Without words needed, he knew. He was not looking at him but he could feel it, Malfoy needed that too. Time and peace. To think and to search for an answer. He could feel his loneliness and a familiar feeling of being lost and defeated. Pain.
He didn't even shout, his tone was low but filled with a vile satisfaction. Profoundly cruel. Malfoy looked proud and pleased has Harry felt his body being lacerated. Blood flowing profusely from each cuts. His vision became blurry in only a few seconds, he could feel the life being poured out of him as he weakened. Dropping on his knees.
But there was no room left for compassion as he was only getting angrier. Rage had uncontrollably taken over everything inside him. It was nonsense to him. Malfoy had no right to feel guilty for those deaths. Because, coward or not, he never could have stopped Voldemort anyway. So there was no point, no reasons, for him to take the blame.
The blond looked at it for a while with uncertainty, wincing at the bad smell, but he grabbed it anyway. Brushing his fingers against Harry's as he did, they were astonishingly soft. He then brought it to eye level to analyse it, turning it around between his thumb and index.
She ended the conversation there, leaving with an angry pace. Stepping close to Harry on her way, he quickly moved so she wouldn't run into him, holding his breath to not make any sound. But then she stopped after a few more steps, turning over and looking straight in his direction. He could feel his heart stop, not wanting to be discovered. He froze, petrified by angst. She was peering suspiciously at the area, her eyes darting from left to right, up and down. Searching with furrowed brows. She then lingered on the floor, where Harry had stood for most of the conversation. Lights were dim, but maybe she could still see traces of tears in the carpet. Little darker spots. The boy still holding his breath closed his eyes in a prayer, hoping she wouldn't find him, wouldn't reveal him. And then he heard her feet move again, but she was, fortunately, going away. And held a breath of relief, felt his heart beat again.
Harry asked, raising a brow. Dubious, because after all, Malfoy had been the one shaking him in his sleep, waking him from a dream where he had just killed him, like a warning maybe meant to echo with reality. Being the real threat here.
He shouted back, lifting a hand to wave it as his silhouette became smaller on the bridge. Not knowing that, left alone in the courtyard, Malfoy smiled and laughed a bit, thinking of how strange their encounter was once more.
But something else was wrong. The way he was looking at his son... His face was icy, eyes devoid of light. He even looked... scornful. Harry felt lost, why was his dad looking at him like that ? Why wasn't he full of love and joy to see him ?
He repeated almost like a song. Humming the word with a broken melody. Bewildered, Harry shook his head in disbelieve. Not understanding why Sirius didn't want to be saved.
She whispered with relieve but Harry stayed frozen, no longer knowing how to hug it seemed. He ended up grabbing her softly by the shoulders to push her away and free himself, feeling uncomfortable. One embrace for the day had been enough for him, even for the whole week and even maybe the month.
The Slytherin sighed, realizing the true meaning of the original question. He took his time to think of an answer, passing a hand in his hair, strangely unkempt. He shrugged.
They walked without a word to the dorms, stopping as they entered the common room, ready to part ways. The four houses still had different bedrooms, stairs leading to each of them spread to the four corners of the common room. But Harry wasn't ready to go to bed yet. It was still only past midnight, and he wasn't sure everyone was already actually asleep. He needed to be careful, he surprisingly had a nice evening for once, so he didn't wanted to ruin it with a cold glare from Ron, or stumble across Neville who he still couldn't face. The shame of not being able to go see him growing bigger at each hour spent avoiding the boy.
He breathed letting his back fall against the wall, his lips twitching from a faint smile. Letting his eyes drop on the floor then around him, almost shy from the tingly feeling he had in his heart. It was only a vague and thin happiness, but to him that was already overwhelming, because it had been so long since he had felt any of it. There was something peaceful in the air now and he took a deep breath to take it all in.
Their surprised exclamations mingled and the two boys then stared at each other in silence. As if time had been suddenly frozen.
He detailed. It was painful to admit it, shameful, but to be trusted he knew he needed to be completely honest. They had allowed him to keep on living by putting him in a cage, diminishing him. Like a wild beast that should never be trusted and on which you should always keep a careful eye on. That's how he felt, an animal held on a leash. But this option was better than the other one. Which was being sent to Azkaban... His young age had earn him some indulgence from the jury. They had offered some mercy with the benefit of the doubt. That he was just a kid, doing what his father had told him to do. That, given the chance, now on his own he could become someone good.
She tried to smile softly to calm him down. This time though, she didn't reach to touch his hand. She had come to understand that the physical contact was too much to the boy for now.
Hermione pleaded softly, trying to be optimistic and reassure him. That was her way of doing things, always trying to make him see hope and give him faith. But Harry wanted none of that, not now. He felt it yesterday, the breaking was strong and real. Sure, they had fought many times over the years and made up every time. But this was different. This wasn't really about arguing actually, just parting away. Changing and not being a match anymore.
But suddenly he realized, someone was leaning on the railing already. He froze, but it was only blond hair... Only... He felt weird to be relieved by that fact...
Hermione stated, being the comprehensive one. She was always trying to reassure him but Harry wondered if she wasn't losing hope herself. Maybe she was just better at pretending than her boyfriend. He felt bad at that thought, knowing his depression was just hurting his friends. But there was nothing he could do about it, otherwise he would have done it... Sometimes he was finding himself thinking he'd better leave them, break up their friendship so they could be free of him. Not having to care anymore. He was just a weight on their shoulders and they'd probably be better without him.
Catching one of the toasts, he forced himself to take a first bite. He could see a light smile of relief appear on Hermione's lips before she plunged back into her study.
Malfoy answered in a quiet tone that, this time, didn't hold any amusement in it. It was weak, as if is throat was also stuck with a knot. Hard and painful. There was also something stern and gloomy in it. And Harry recognized the feeling too well. The need and determination of being punished for something. To make amends by being harsh on oneself.
She then asked and he shrugged. Actually, he didn't feel like attempting the next class... He was already exhausted, feeling his lack of sleep... and food. The thought of escaping charms to go eat and then nap was way more appealing.  He could hear his stomach rumble. For once, he was hungry. Maybe thanks to the glimpse of happiness she had just given him, it must have had an effect on his appetite.
He sneered with irony. Raising a hand to his forehead, he then closed his eyes and took a deep breath to calm down.
So things were like this now, they were conversing like old friends it seemed. Only two sentences but they echoed way too normal for them.
Malfoy laughed then stayed silent. Taking his book back, he opened it where he had marked the page and got back to his reading. Harry took his want out of his pocket and pointed it at the fireplace to start a fire. Watching the flames grow, he let them capture his gaze. Feeling hypnotized by their dance. It was warm and soothing. The crackling of wood had a strange healing effect on him, it had something homey in it. He brought his leg back up on the sofa and leaned. Like this, he could almost fall asleep. Listening again to the pages being turned, to slow breathing filling up the room. So quiet and peaceful.
He said, pleading in a low voice, broken. For the first time, vulnerable. Raising desperate eyes to Hermione with a shaky breathe. And Harry could see on his face, how hard it had been for him. That what he had taken for selfishness was actually pain.
Time seemed to float. Silence fell and Harry could hear the wind again on the surface of the water, in the trees and the leaves. The breeze was cool, it was announcing that autumn is very close. He closed his eyes for a moment, feeling the wind on his face. He smelled the scents of the lake, a mixture of wet grass, bark and mud.
He had never heard of it. Actually, he had never been into reading so... His knowledge on books was close to nothing.
He answered, showing the room around from the tip of his finger and raising his eyebrow with scorn. He found some ease in this opportunity to enter a banter. It made him more comfortable than the potential heavy conversation he was too anxious to face, after that encounter at the lake. Glad that Harry had not brought up his apology.
Feeling like he was drowning. How was he supposed to get out of this nightmare ? Everything was just so dark around him.
Harry mumbled, absently drawing circles on his knees with the tip of his finger. Taking it in, it was indeed making sense. He too was surprised to find that his company was not the worst. Confused that it was almost too obvious how much they were actually alike. That he was the only one that made him feel like he wasn't being judge for feeling so depressed. Maybe the fact that they weren't friend had the perk that Malfoy had no expectations from him. No care to see the old Potter back, the one he disliked anyway. Therefore, no intentions of pushing him to get better or change. And also, he was the one who had never treated him like a hero, the saviour, drowned him in the suffocating glory. In the Slytherin's eyes, he had always just see a pathetic reflection of himself, mocked. And now, what he could see was just the image of an ordinary boy. Exactly what he had always wanted to be.
The voice asked bluntly, coming closer. He hadn't heard his footsteps, but he wasn't startled either. He was expecting him. And he didn't even turned around to greet Malfoy. He just shrugged, keeping his eyes to the forest.
. Something inside him was pushing him to get closer. It wasn't curiosity, just instinct. A voice guiding him.
Harry grumbled, on his guard. Bewildered by the Slytherin's behaviour. He seemed calm, almost too calm. His expression was empty and it was the first time the Gryffindor saw him like this. No scorn or anger, not even his usual petty expression. As if the blond had been emptied of all emotions. It was awkward.
Again, she was right. But it was a bit frustrating to hear that she could defend him better than himself, speak the words he couldn't but should have said by himself.
As soon as he sat foot in the courtyard, although he could only see the pavement under his feet, his heart started to race in his chest. Almost breaking trough his ribs and out of his body.
He asked with an irritated tone. Sure, they shared a special, but weird, moment just a few hours ago, and Harry's opinion on him ended up softening from it. But still, it didn't especially make him want to share time with the Slytherin. He was not an enemy anymore, but still far from being a friend. Right now he was just... someone. And even if his company was surprisingly not the worst, Harry still like the idea of being truly alone better.
That one was particularly painful for Harry who felt his heart and guts tighten. So now he was a waste of time for his former best friend... Things had been off for a while between them two now, but still, those were very strong words. He wasn't expecting him to be so cruel towards him. Anger would have been understandable, but this was something else. Close to hate, almost disgust. And to the raven hair boy, it felt like the ginger one was just throwing away all their good memories in the fire, spitting of what they had been. And there, under is cloak, Harry really felt like he was nothing.
Or so Harry had been told, and that's why he had decided to give it a try after the war. In the hope it would actually work. He had remembered seeing a lot of muggles smoke when he was a kid, always wondering why they did and what could be so appealing in those smelly smoky tubes of paper. He had easily associated it with stress even before being told so. Often, when he was seeing someone looking nervous, they would lit up a cigarette and release the first blow with a typical relieved exhale, like they had been craving for it more than anything else. So he had figured that it must truly help to soothe the nerves somehow, if they were all so addicted to it.
He then mumbled shyly. And Harry held back any remarks he could have made on the pure blood opinion of muggles. Choosing only to see the progress and effort he had made in stopping himself. By doing so, showing that he now was aware of how wrong such statements were. Had grew.
She almost yelled at him, but Harry didn't even flinched. He didn't care. He just shook his head and shrugged. Acting like it wasn't affecting him, because nothing did anymore. Supposedly. Truth was different though. He was trying to deny it but he was aching. And even if he convinced himself that he wanted to sneer earlier at the dramatic way Ron passed by them, in reality he wanted to cry. He loved him for sure. He just didn't know how to be his friend anymore. Their connection was lost and neither of them knew how to save it. So it was easier to pretend that losing his best friend didn't even bother him than to keep on trying. He already had enough reasons to cry anyway. Enough problems he needed to work on. Adding another one would just kill him to be honest, his energy was already drained.
This analysis was far too confusing and Harry felt uncomfortable to see his vulnerability so exposed in those grey eyes.
Amongst the crowd, he could already hear rumours, his name on everyone's lips. His heart sped up and he hurried to get on the train, not stopping when someone tried to catch his attention. He felt the panic grow, needing to hide as fast as possible. His eyes on the ground, breathing too fast, he finally reached an empty compartment. He rushed in, followed by his best friends who were baffled by his pace. He then hastily closed the door. Letting himself fall on the seat against the window, he closed his eyes and exhaled, trying to regain control of his breathing.
She softly said with a laugh, pressing a hand on Harry's shoulder as she moved passed him to head to class. The boy brushed her hand with his as she did. Thankful that she was understanding and was letting him miss charms without lecturing him or trying to go.
Feeling suddenly shy and ashamed as he realized how absurd his reaction was. Maybe he was becoming crazy... Because it seemed he as really lost his mind. Unable to control it anymore.
With a way to gentle touch, the blond ended up taking his hand when he was done, trying to relax it to make the black haired boy let go of him. A soft pressure that made Harry take a step back, started by this light touch.
. Not yet ready to take Malfoy's defence, but not willing to diss him anymore either. He wanted to understand first. He had too many questions for the blond but no idea where to start. Not even sure that he actually cared for the answers anyway... Maybe he could just forget about the lake, forget about him. It would be more simple.
Hermione's eyes were scary in the dim light of the common room. Rage pulsing in her neck. She too was offended and outraged by what she had just heard. Hurt even, to witness how bad and brutal the tear between the two men she loved was.
Harry's eyes dropped to the ground, furrowing. He inhaled deeply before leaning back. And the Slytherin found some comfort in the way the other boy was obviously considering what he had just stated. He could see it was resonating in his head, making him think hard and re-evaluate things. The way the Gryffindor was nervously biting his thumb, gaze lost in his thoughts. Silent, because that was a prove he couldn't contest this time. And it was a strong one. A believable one. For the blond, it was a good sign. But he was holding is breath, waiting for confirmation.
He reminded him and looked away, making it clear that their little conversation and moment of sharing had come to an end. He was still serious about his condition, and the break from silence had lasted long enough.
He corrected in a whisper. And he could feel her tense up at those words. Annoyed by the negativity in him that she couldn't seem to erase.
And finally, his godfather got up. Weakly, holding himself to the wall. Under his shaggy prison clothes, all Harry could see was a bag of bones. He dragged himself to the bars. Seeing him in such a state was devastating.
Malfoy sighed, rolling his eyes before getting up. Clearly it was the cue to end the conversation here. Before it would turn bad again. A chance he didn't want to take. He had no idea why he had upset Harry so much tonight, but the experience was definitely not a good one and by all means he wanted to avoid a new confrontation. He was guessing that the animosity of the Gyrffindor towards him was related to something he had dreamt of, but for now, he would be content with not knowing...
He hadn't smiled since his so called victory against Voldemort, his lips now felt rusty. Ron had tried to make them curved again until he had lost hope. The first weeks, he was acting in a exaggerated euphoria around Harry, it was too much to be believable. The boy had just lost a brother after all and Harry couldn't bring himself to believe he had actually manage to find joy again so quickly. It was all an act to prevent the chosen one to fall into depression. Touching, but ineffective. Worst even, seeing him making so much efforts was just bothering the boy a bit more.
Sinking in the darkness between the trees, Harry could already hear the wind caressing the surface of the water, a moist and soothing lapping coming to lick his ears. There was no happy echoes here, only silence broken by the whispers of nature. Solitude. Or at least that's what he thought he would find....
She scolded firmly, though without raising her voice, while taking a seat herself. Harry closed his eyes for a moment. Taking a deep breath before yielding. He did not have the strength to fight again, he didn't want to argue. He just wanted this to be over as quickly as possible. He sat facing her, staring at her for a moment while she was already grabbing a book to review its content.
His voice was unstable. He shook his head, his heart was beating so hard that it was hurting him. And, unable to bear to be in this room any longer, with all those eyes locked on him, he decided to flee despite the imploring eyes of his friends. First, stepping back with hesitation, his legs shaking under his weight, before actually turning around to run.
But meaning was forced upon him, when a black veil fell from the ceiling behind Sirius. A dark grey sheet almost transparent. Familiar. Awfully familiar.
Ok, so I wanted to put so much into this nightmare... but didn't wanted it to be too long also. So I hope I didn't rushed it too much.
Without a word, Harry followed him and also went to sit, in the opposite sofa. Facing the blond, eyes never letting go of him, still wary. The silence became heavy but, in it, the angry tension weirdly eased. Malfoy could feel the Gryffindor getting more calm even though he was still a bit agitated, fingers strumming on the armrest. But he seemed more willing to listen, his wand no longer in his hand but resting on his lap. And the blond hoped that he was now more open to reason.
Unsurprisingly, Harry found a familiar brown head waiting on the doorstep. Long untamed hair and hazel eyes shining with constant thinking. Hermione and her determination to never miss a visit.. Yet, Harry found himself surprised to see her alone. Looking behind her shoulder, he was expecting to find the usual redhead, but there was not a single soul to be seen.
This morning he had finally managed to find a perfectly empty path to class. Through forgotten or useless corridors that no one used, or going trough some at times where no one would take them. Embracing the loneliness, until he heard footsteps ahead. As a habit he ducked his head lower. But he started to feel his heart pound when the footsteps came closer. Straight at him.
Malfoy sneered with bitterness, shaking his head slowly in disbelief before defying the raven haired boy by turning is back to him. Showing no care whatsoever about the threat. He just walked towards the window, looking at the night beyond.
Still with his back turned, Malfoy took a deep breath and shook his head. Noticing though that Harry seemed to be more calm now, he took a mental note that being gentle and careful was useless and that the boy was in need to be shaken to be brought down.
His voice rose, he was shaking with anger. And Harry could feel himself getting angry too. Did Ron really believe that he felt broken by choice ? That he wanted to feel so anxious and guilty all the time ? Hating himself so much.
The raven haired boy felt uncomfortable with this honest conversation, the open hearted exchange with the Slytherin being very strange. Clearing his throat, his eyes riveted on the grass, he then moved forward to approach the water, passing Malfoy but taking care not to walk too close. He now had his back turn to him, realizing that he was still holding onto his wand, he hesitated for a moment to let go of it.
She understood what Harry meant by obvious and, with eyes widened by scandal, she protested. She just couldn't believe it could come down to that. She refused the idea. They had lost too many friends in the war, and there was no way she would lose one more over what she considered a stupid fight.
He was still feeling suspicious about all this. Even thought she was looking at him with a deep kindness. He still felt like she had to be angry with him. Because she had to be in some way, even if she was claiming the opposite. He couldn't understand why she would be so nice, why she would help someone who didn't even greet her.
It made him bite his lips as the raven haired boy was still looking down at him, with furrowing brows. He read annoyance on his face, a look he knew only too well. Feeling the urge to look away but still, too anxious to do so.
Reaching his hand out to him, he didn't really know why he offered to share. It was almost too friendly of him, but it came like an impulse.
Malfoy answered quickly with confidence. Nodding his head as if he was trying to convince Harry who was looking at him unsure. Actually, he was surprised to find himself so admiring of the blond. He must have been one of the most hated man in the world nowadays, yet he was still finding the strength to keep a positive mind about things. He even became somewhat inspiring. And Harry realized how much more there was to him than what he had always thought. He wished he could think like him, focus on the good to fight his darkest thoughts. But he just couldn't...
The raven haired boy swallowed hard and shook his head to keep himself for staring any longer. Turning away as Malfoy started to bite his lip in reflexion. Bringing his gaze towards his own knees, it was more safe to look there.
He whispered with compassion, then taking his hand in his, he gently squeezed it. Harry allowed the touch this time. Because he desperately needed it. He turned his attention to his best friend, saw that his gaze had become almost as broken as his. He too suffered at the sight of the memorial. After all, his brother's name was on it. Lost somewhere in the sea of fallen. And for a moment, Harry felt less lonely in the battle with his demons. He let his forehead fall upon the shoulder of the redhead who then gently patted on his back.
Harry let out a low sneer in disbelief. He sounded so pathetic, very far for the boy he once knew. Or thought he knew... But for sure, the blond was honest. Which he was finding interesting.
He could feel Harry tense more, his green irises turning black and his hand squeezing his wand with white knuckles.
He informed them with a flat tone and they looked at him with surprise and confusion. Baffled, Hermione started to open her mouth.
Harry called him, trying to get his attention, and the man jumped at his voice, startled, before beginning to shake. Pressing his body against the wall in panic, he didn't turn around, obviously afraid.
He burst out harshly and they both then stared angrily at each other, almost defying. Wrestling in a heavy silence, their bodies tensed. Testing their patience and trying to make the other one yield. And, eventually, Harry won. The girl's eyes turned from rage to despair and her shoulders dropped as she released her stiff muscles.
He muttered in disbelief. How could Harry not understand ? He had just wanted to help him, seeing how distressed he looked in his sleep. He could have just left him there, sleeping on the sofa, struggling with his nightmare. But he had fucking chose to help him get out of it, and all he got for it was that aggressive reaction from the raven-haired boy. The sudden suspicion, for no valid reasons.
Hermione shouted, startling the boy who then raised his head only to find his two friends already rushing towards him. The girl jumped to his neck, embracing him strongly.
But to Harry it was a good thing. Enough to be refreshing. Annoyance is not a painful feeling at least.
He then spat the words with defiance. Not shouting anymore, just cold in his voice. Fighting reason, the one that was telling him to just agree with him and stop trying to have that fucking last word.
Malfoy's face finally ceased to look empty, he was clearly offended by the comment. Now writhing in an expression of anger. He seemed almost hurt, or maybe upset. Harry had trouble figuring it out. But there was no doubt, he felt insulted.
With guilt he bit his lip, averting the gaze of the Gryffindor with an obvious shame after that confession. But Harry dropped his eyes on the floor too anyway, too troubled. Processing his words, understanding again a bit better what he never allowed himself to see. The trap around Malfoy. His struggles... He would have never thought he would one day feel pity for him, thinking of how hard it must have been. But here he was, compassionate and sorry to hear him confess his weakness. Almost glad the blond actually did nothing, because he would have been doomed to fail. End up dead. Probably unaware that Harry had to die in order to truly kill the dark lord. The boy who lived, only to die better... Fucking hell. Harry was wondering why he cared about the boy living. But then again, he actually already knew somehow. He strangely never wished him dead, despite everything he ever did to him, that's why he saved him last year... He remembered how instinct took over feelings when he witnessed him near his end. He just couldn't leave him to burn.
He thought to himself but sighed in relief when he was sure to be alone. Finally entering the room, with a sluggish pace he headed for the sofa facing the fireplace. Since the fire was still on, he should at least enjoy it's comforting warmth. But, suddenly, he froze. Lying down on the couch, he actually ended up finding someone... Someone he could not have seen from the stairs, hidden and curled up on his side. And that someone was not just anyone... Blond hair, and silver eyes looking at him as surprised as he was. Again Malfoy was there, and both stared at each other startled and confused. Cleary, at this hour, they both thought they would be alone. Also, not used to run into each other in a common room.
He just whispered softly, lost in his thoughts and in the warmth that he was now seeing in the grey eyes. Still able to see so much pain in them though... But he could see, how hard he was trying to hide it, to fight it in that moment. To look brave and confident. Like a weak puppy trying to walk for the first time.
Again, she refused to let her determination yield. Strong eyes locking in the emerald gaze that got blurry with tears. Harry shivered, trying to contain them. He felt something warm flow in him, relief and love. The words hit him even harder after his argument with Ron. The redhead had made it clear that he wanted none of the new Harry. But Hermione, on the contrary, she was willing to embrace it and make her peace with the idea that he would probably never be the same again. She was accepting him and this was the most beautiful thing he had heard in ages.
Their gaze met him and suddenly they both tried to stand as if to rush to him but seemed to be stuck on their chairs. Unable to get up, like glued.
He paused to think, trying to hold back new tears. Thinking quickly. He had to find a solution, one that didn't required magic, since he was apparently deprived of it. And it was pretty easy to think of. A door... to open a door without charms there's only one way. A key. There had to be a key somewhere.
But he then frowned when he saw his friends suddenly becoming awkward at that request. They looked at each other like they were having a silent conversation, a conversation he was not part of. Hermione bit her lip, Ron cleared his throat. Harry didn't have to be a genius to understand that something was up.
But the Gryffindor must have gotten lost in his contemplation, because the Slytherin ended up raising an eyebrow, to insist on the expectancy of an answer. Bringing Harry back to reality.
It warmed his heart a bit because, really, she was erasing all doubts he could have had about how much she loved him. And Harry felt glad to have her, understanding she would never go away. No matter what, their bond was strong, and that must have been what true friendship means. But on the other side, he couldn't say the same about Ron, who remained now silent, dropping his gaze at the floor. Making it clear he had nothing more to say. His silence made him look like he was acknowledging that she was right, but that he had also choose to remain stubborn and not yield. Which after a few seconds of piercing trough him with her eyes, she understood.
The Gryffindor broke it himself now that his old enemy had his attention away from his story. It was a true puzzle for him. They had always been enemies, and even if, without the war, their conflict was now meaningless, he couldn't understand why he had turned to him for company. They never liked each other after all, and even if they could let go of the hate now, why not simply ignore one another ? It's not like they could enjoy being together. Right ?
The boy slowly forced himself to swallow the whole toast, but couldn't bring himself to eat the second. His stomach was, after all, drastically reduced. For the time being, she would have to be content with this small effort.
He heard Ron's voice call him but he didn't stop, running through the empty corridors of the castle, to the point of losing his breath. He collapsed in an isolated corner, just behind a statue. Tears rolled down his cheeks, he felt like he had forgotten how to breathe. His eyes hastily watched the corridor around him, to make sure he was alone. And he suddenly realized how everything seemed to be normal again. The impacts of hexes in the walls had disappeared, the stones had been repaired. The blood cleaned... as if nothing had ever happened.
She ended with a smile and a soft stroke of her thumb on his cheek. And just like that, she deprived him of all the dark thoughts that was clouding his mind, those reasons he was trying to find, to justify that she couldn't not be mad. Because there was no denying anymore, her eyes and words had pushed reason into his head and he allowed himself to trust her. Doing so made his eyes feel watery with emotions. Because he felt grateful. Grateful to be shown so much understanding. And it had been long since his heart felt so warm.
It wasn't a question nor a suggestion. It was an order.  Ron looked disconcerted, shaking his head in confusion, opening his mouth a few times but not finding his words. Trapped and pressured. It seemed the task he was ask to do was impossible for him and Harry knew he was just trying to find the right way to decline. It was painful in a way, to see that his former best friend couldn't even bring himself to say sorry, or at least try. But Ron had never been good at apologizing after all. He was stubborn and had a weird pride when it came to admitting his wrongs. They both were alike on that matter and that's why they always had all those stupid fights in the past. Not talking to each other for days or weeks over silly things.  Which let Harry to think... Sure, he would have liked to hear Ron apologize, but maybe it was just selfish of him. Maybe he should apologize too. After all, the apology he gave him the night of their arrival was a joke, empty and not real. Just an excuse, lacking sincerity, or just not aiming right. He had apologized for not being himself, which wasn't right, even to himself. He shouldn't feel sorry for that, because his mental health wasn't a choice he made after all. He too was burdened by it and if he had any control on it he would surely make things better. So now he was starting to understand, that the apology he actually owed Ron wasn't about him feeling this way, but only towards the fact that his state was causing the redhead pain, and that he had ignored that pain.
Every evening, Harry had the same ritual. Leaving the dorms under his cloak to go hide in the astronomy tower where he would lit a cigarette then sit for hours in silence and loneliness. Thinking too much while at the same time trying not to.
How could two simple words hold so much despair in them ? The conversation was starting to putt Harry on edge. He was unable to just let it go, and it was really frustrating. Hand clenched on his quill, not even knowing why he kept on answering when it could have been left at that. It's was a good end to it, Malfoy just dropping things, not bothering him anymore... But no, he had to fucking answer again.
The blond stared at the Gryffindor without flinching during his whole speech. Frozen and surprised by his loss of control, wide-eyed. Harry was excepting to see him smile but the Slytherin showed no satisfaction. On the contrary, he seemed uncomfortable and Harry could see him swallows with difficulty, as if he was trying to swallow the words he just took straight in his face with ferocity.
Malfoy questioned again and Harry let out a heavy sigh. Not so annoyed by his insistence, but rather by his inability to answer without losing his dignity. He didn't want to admit that he freaked out so much he ran away and ended up crying like a weak and fragile thing, curled up on the castle's cold floor.
Harry finally answered, his tone carrying something strong in it. A will he wasn't even aware of. Making it seem like he was looking to soothe Malfoy's remorse, determined to make him stop thinking so bad of himself. Which made absolutely no sense. Seriously, why would he care ? He was thinking too much into it, mind blurred by his own feelings. Because, listening to Malfoy gave him the strange impression of looking into a mirror. It was almost the same image, just reversed. And he was struggling to deny the connection that was growing out of it. Two boys trapped by their destiny, openly destroyed by a war they never wanted... Kids used like toys to do the messy work of grown ups. Trying to protect the ones they love and causing damage in doing so.
If the Gryffindor had still been his old self, he would have probably told him to go fuck himself and would have left with a hasty and dramatic pace. But he was now tamed, too discouraged to turn this into a scene.
He decided. He wouldn't be able to escape forever, stay here all year long until it was over. He had no choice... And delaying the moment would not make it less inevitable.
Reaching out to Harry with open arms, she also offered comfort. Harry didn't avoid it this time, approaching her until the girl's arms could fall around his shoulders. She pressed her hand lightly against his biceps, and Harry felt pride in her the squeeze. She was proud to see he had not turned back yet. She encouraged him and, together, they continued their walk until they entered the castle.
Harry mumbled rolling his eyes then looking away. But it was actually, better. Like Malfoy would say, it was more familiar. And familiar was comfortable. It had become rare, and so also precious. And it made Harry want to smile again. But he didn't, or only faintly.
A voice brought him out of his morbid thoughts. Maybe he had actually dozed off a bit. A hand on his shoulder, Hermione was shaking him gently before taking a step back when he opened his eyes.
The boy nodded before getting up without a word, heading as suggested towards the bathroom. He was dirty, he knew it. He hadn't washed for three days now. His condition was deplorable. He didn't even changed from his pyjamas. He could even smell himself at this point.
He mumbled to the girl, getting his attention quickly back to her. Already expecting a scolding somehow.
Suddenly hearing the girl rummaging through her bag, he turned his gaze, frowning with curiosity, to look at her. Her bag was still so small yet so filled, she had gotten used to having so much storage space without having to bother actually carrying all of it on her back... Hermione finally took out a box from it and handed it over to Harry.
Making him rise his eyes towards him after what must have been an hour of silence. Malfoy met his gaze and Harry was once again startled by the lack of animosity in his eyes. Like this, he almost seemed likable. Stunned to notice he was finding in them more comprehension than in his, now former, best friend's.
The blond hissed aggressively, but he was actually sounding tired and beaten down. Obviously hurt by the accusation, but Harry was blind and deaf to it. And he wasn't done with his incriminations. Even stepping closer to deprive the blond of the comfort zone he had take to pressure him.
But everything was going fast now. And even if he was becoming aware that he was dreaming, it all still felt too real and he still felt the need to escape. Still felt the danger fastening his heart. Rising quickly on his feet, he knew he had no time to cry over Cedric's body, nor to think. He had to leave him there. They were surrounded by a circle of masked Death Eater, Pettigrew and his knife was there too. Ready to take his blood. Harry had to run, quickly. At full pace, he barely managed to push between two Death Eaters to clear his way before they could caught him. Running then blindly with no idea of were he was going, as long as it was far from here, it's all that mattered. But it was like the way had been traced for him, because in the middle of the cemetery, he was trapped in a corridor. On both sides, rows of statues representing angels of death, drawing a path. Each of them holding one of all the persons he ever loved, struggling under their scythe. But he couldn't stop to save them. It was a painful dilemma but he knew he had to keep going.
Harry interrupted him, turning away, not really willing to engage into a conversation again. Anyway, the teacher brought the class to silence to start his lesson. Lazily, Harry took out some papers, quill and ink from his bag to start writing. Looking at the blank pages however, it seemed to absorb him. Pure white and nothingness. He contemplated the void. Familiar emptiness. Finding it almost funny how an untouched piece of paper seemed to be one of the things that could represent him best. A sad kind of funny. Yeah, that's what he was now. Empty.
He raised his hands to put a finger under each of his eyes, referring to the Gryffindor dark circles.
The miserable shadow of a man was no other than his godfather, he was sure of it. Clenching at the bars, Harry tried to shake them desperately. But they obviously couldn't be broken by the force of a simple man. No matter how strong. Weak against the metal.
The Gryffindor’s heart was beating too fast and, again, he was finding himself at a loss of words. Just flooded with emotions, he felt lost because what Malfoy said made sense... Brutality had made him able to hear for once. Again he was defeated by the smart blonde. Again in the wrong and he hated how clear the Slytherin made things. Like he suddenly became the owner of every truth. Too wise for his liking, it made him uncomfortable to take life lessons from him. To have all his ideas shaken by this particular crystal voice.
He begged. He had been trough enough for today, his thoughts were too chaotic for him to have a conversation now. He just wanted to shut down. He was exhausted.
The next day seemed to be again the same as yesterday, and the day before it. Like a day on repeat, stuck in a day without end. Harry being nothing more than a shadow in the corridors, taking detours to avoid meeting anyone. Hidden under is hoodie, eyes never leaving the floor. He was ignoring is growling empty stomach, still couldn't get himself to enter the great hall and get some food. He was feeling to nauseous in the crowd to eat anyway. Surviving only on the leftovers that Hermione was giving him.
He stammered. No, he would never be one to press the ultimatum over her. It wasn't his place to do so. He could never ask that of her. But seeing how mad Ron was at him, he was excepting the redhead to do so.
The lake in sight, the boy froze when he discovered another silhouette. Sitting in the grass, contemplating the water. He recognized effortlessly the blond hair that turned nervously on hearing him approach.
Her whispering was chilling. Threatening in that clenched jaw of hers that made her sound like a snake hissing.
Harry growled. And to that, the blond started to laugh. The raven haired boy could only open his eyes wide in surprise to his reaction. And to the sound of his laughter, a sound he had never heard before. It was a soft and joyful giggle, and he couldn't help but think that even his fucking laugh was elegant. The way he was politely but unnecessarily hiding his smiling mouth with a hand, a revealing of how rigid his education must have been. He was the incarnation of high class. His back always so straight, his chin kept high and his clothes neat. His black turtleneck making his neck looked even thinner and graceful.
Malfoy asked, closing his book and slowly putting it to his side. Brushing a hand in his platinum hair that had fallen in front of his eyes while he was bent over on his reading. But they were so silky they refused to stay pushed back and fell again, framing his face to the top of his cheeks. They had grown longer over the summer, long enough to now show small waves in them. It made him look wilder, more free. And, curiously, even more elegant than when he was keeping them carefully groomed. Even with his broken eyes and his purple bruise, he was looking fucking graceful. Harry had never had any interest in boys, but he couldn't deny, now that he had properly looked at him without having his vision clouded by hatred, Malfoy was a man of a rare beauty.
