“Not even Al? Weird. I didn’t, ‘cause I thought he would.”
“Do you even
Millicent was rubbing a thumb against her own tattoo. “Draco’s the only bloke outside Azkaban who was branded by that nutter. But the Ministry marked us, just the same.” Flora pulled Millie’s hand up, pressing her lips against the black letters.
“Maybe I’m not.”
Harry’s mouth was open. He closed it, and swallowed. “You’re a Veela?”
“It’s fine, Harry,” Ted insisted. “I got a Protego up before anything really happened. It’s just—I don’t know, mate. That wasn’t—”
“We could consider Amantadine,” Lakshmi offered, but Malfoy shook his head.
They must be practicing, because the stands are empty. There are no opposing colors on the field—no yellow, blue, or green—and, anyway, it just feels simpler. Kinder. The sky is impossibly blue. Summer Quidditch practice at Hogwarts? This isn’t how things work, is it? But it's familiar, somehow.
“Anything worth doing,” Millie shot back, leaving Harry to fill in the blanks.
“I met Millie and Flora through Dean Thomas,” Harry said, cutting off Hermione’s building argument. “Our kids go to school together. I’m sure you know that.”
Harry gives her a moment to breathe before he concedes, “Yes.”
“Professor,” Harry said, offering his hand as they climbed the staircase.
“You listen to me,” Teddy murmured, pulling James in by the back of the neck. Their foreheads clunked together in a clash of red and blue hair. “You
“I know.” Teddy shuffled some parchment. “She does this, though. Blows hot and cold. Gran says it’s a Veela thing, and that she’ll settle down in a few years.”
Harry looked back and forth between them, still frowning. “What rumors?”
They’re in the kitchen now. It’s mid-afternoon, but close enough to Christmas to be dark already. The window is a navy pit against the curtains Draco’s mother ordered from France. Apparently, all the best kitchens are French; Narcissa told Harry that, with a straight face. Draco nearly pissed himself laughing when he saw Harry’s expression.
Artie and Lily keep trying to sneak each other into their common rooms. Artie says it’s easy as anything to get into the Gryffindor commons (I could’ve told her that!) but Lily is always standing in the wrong place when she says our password. She keeps knocking on the wall and shouting. It’s so embarrassing. I think I’ll stick a dot of paint on the floor or something, just to make her stop.
“It is a school. A site for international meetings, and a research facility. And a home, for professors and staff as well as students. Hogwarts serves many functions, as you know well.”
“No,” Sol said. “You know it isn’t.”
“I will,” she whispered. Audrey patted Harry’s shoulder with a sad smile.
“Eat, Harry,” he murmured. “Al and Lily will be here soon.”
“She’s going to be a Gryffindor,” Al frowned, lips twisting.

to tell me what I can’t have!”
“If he does, he isn’t saying anything to me.” Harry lifted his glasses and rubbed at his eyes. “Not that it’s unusual, mind. He’s locked up tighter than a Gringott’s vault these days.” Hermione made a small humming noise, and Harry sighed. “Go ahead and say it.”
“Conan the Barbarian.”
The ‘private dining’ turned out to be somebody’s sitting room—or so it appeared to Harry. Instead of wooden chairs, tiled floors, and bud vases, the place featured a pair of very long, very squishy sofas. They faced one another on either side of a skinny table, and Harry had to relocate several cushions before he could sit down.
“He doesn’t talk about it. Not to anyone.” She pressed both hands against her forehead, shaking her head. “But I know Draco Malfoy. He never would have used
“No. I was happy. It’s the best place I’ve ever been.”
“Well, the letters on my wrist say otherwise,” she sighed. She pushed back the sleeve of her black dress. The tattoo was stark against the buttery skin of her left arm.
On balance, it could’ve gone a lot worse.
“Harry!” came another shout from the bedroom door. “Get
On McGonagall’s right, the Frenchman Guillaume Comtois, who took over Transfiguration and whom Al idolized. Aurora Sinastra (Astronomy) sat beside Adrian Pucey—flight instructor and Quidditch coordinator. Pucey played Chaser for Puddlemere, before an injury forced him into early retirement three years ago. He played against Ginny, and the Harpies, plenty of times. He’d played against Harry, back in the day.
he thought, and it sounded like Sol in his head.
Harry asked.
to the new receptionist. I’ll get Morris packing up, and on her way before the eleven o’clock meeting is finished. But you owe me.”
Pansy’s voice, returned to business-like smoothness, pulls Harry back to the present. “He thinks you’re at an inn somewhere, you know.”
“I’m sure,” Audrey said in a voice that implied she was not at all sure.
“Why does it matter?” Harry said, a bit petulantly.
Rose had Scorpius by the arm, but he went on blithely, “Oh, well, they won’t serve Malfoys. Father says we should just ask the neighbors to pick us up something, but it looks so lovely inside the shop. Very colorful! Rose,
She nodded. “Of course. He thinks I should have done it ages ago, but I don’t think he realizes how long the project will take.”
tired, and he winced a little when he got up from his chair.
“Cheers, Harry,” Teddy said, tucking into breakfast with vigor.
and decided to be psychotherapist.
“‘Venery’ is a stupid word,” Harry huffed fondly, even though no one was around to hear it. Sort of. Almost no one.
“I don’t drink,” Harry mumbled into his elbow. Hermione rolled her eyes.
Harry blinked back at her. “A book?”
. The pep talk didn’t seem to be helping.
“Right. Of course.”
“Everything about you is funny right now!”
Sol was grinning. “She did that for James?”
“He was taking
“Pansy, for fuck’s sake! Stop answering every question with a question, you bloody snake!”
THE HOMELESS BLACK TRANS WOMEN FUND
“Right. Yeah, for tea. And Draco and Harry don’t really—” Teddy scowled. “They aren’t friendly. So. Makes sense Harry’d be upset, after that.”
“To who?”
“Are the kids around here?” Harry asked, straining onto his toes as he craned his neck.
Harry was amused. “Is that why you wanted me to teach you Glamours?”
“Harry Potter should go to bed!” Winky said, with all the command a two-foot tall Elf with eyes like headlights could muster.
They pushed through the swinging door onto the sales floor, and were nearly concussed by a wave of high-pitched sound. Squealing voices, whirling gadgets, chattering pygmy puffs, crying babies. Harry cast a wordless Susurratio toward his own head, and then another at Ron. The taller man jumped.
Hestia shook her head. Ron tapped his fingers on the table. Parkinson sipped her espresso silently. Millie crossed both arms over her chest, and Flora chewed on her lower lip.
The toilet flushed. “You need to explain,” Hermione called as the sink turned on. “From the beginning. You heard it from Pansy?”
“‘Always Apparate on an empty stomach and an emptier bladder,’” Harry said.
“She definitely knows,” Angie agreed. She practically vibrated. “Heard it all directly from Astoria. It’s not really a secret; they won’t be able to keep it out of the papers.”
“Well, all the memorials last year got me thinking...”
Harry’s hackles went up. “I don’t think you can equate James protecting his own potions with Draco Malfoy trying to kill Dumbledore! It was a fairly harmless Anti-Theft Curse.”
Harry put the toast, well-buttered, down in front of his sister-in-law. Her skin was pink along the edges, and she tapped a toe restlessly. “I agree,” Harry said, sitting back down. “So, what’s your plan?”
The motions were rote, and soothing, but Harry found he couldn’t stomach the thought of any breakfast. He doctored his coffee, made sure the cast iron stove was set low, and made his way up the stairs to get ready for the arduous journey to Scotland.
“Certainly, yes. He might have a suggestion. Shall I send for a consult?”
Inevitable.
“It was in a big book of protection spells, for keeping things safe,” James argued.
“Because everybody is
Parkinson looked up. “Fifth year? Not sixth?”
“That’s what you call a flock of them,” Harry said. Hermione huffed.
“You?” She leveled him with an unimpressed look. “Malfoy?”
can I still love him this much?”
“Arsehole,” Teddy grumbled.
“That’s the girls, and not like they can help it,” Teddy reminded him. “The boys don’t glow; they don’t have the allure. It’s just Scorp’s hair. And the skin. And, like, the smiling. I reckon Draco’s given up on the smiling.”
“I know!” Angie cried, her hands clasped. “Can you believe it? I heard it from Pansy Zabini just today. Apparently, she’s leaving Malfoy to
And then there was darkness. But only for a moment.
“Not in person.” Hermione shook her head. “Owls. A few Floo calls, but none recently. I haven’t noticed a thing. Have you seen him at work, Harry?”
“Oh! Yes. As we discussed—everyone present, aside from myself, will sign a non-disclosure agreement.”
“She’s done that already.”
He did not do those things, because that wasn’t how time travel worked. He couldn’t make his own history untrue. He couldn’t rewrite his failures, correct his own wrongs. It would be easy to hate the weakness in that. So tempting to prune out all that pain.
“Well. Fine, but it’s all silly superstition,” Mione said. “Luck! Divination! There’s another Friday the 13
Thinking about his
Malfoy ignored the jibe. “Potter.
Her expression softened. “Never.”
Harry wiped a hand across his mouth and sighed. “I can come today, soon as I’ve let the office know. Just for the day, d’you think?”
in December of this year, you know.”
He was leaning back against the scratchy brick wall of the café, counting his breaths as the shaking in his hands slowed, when the rear door opened again. Millicent walked out, glanced at Harry with a wrinkled nose, and found her own patch of wall to prop up.
“Rose only helped me find a spell,” James said, gritting his teeth. “I put it on the box I keep my potions in, inside my trunk. It wouldn’t react to me. It only set off the Curse if somebody else tried to open it.”
Flora’s eyes slid closed for a moment, before she visibly stiffened her spine. “I’m sure that’s true. More coffee?”
Harry’s lips were soft while Draco could feel his were chapped, not that it mattered to Harry. Harry’s own hands replicated Draco’s; one was placed at the nape of Draco’s neck while the other was touching his cheek gently.
The wall that held the opening to the Slytherin common room came upon them, and Draco said the password to allow them entrance. As he watched the entryway appear before his eyes, he fiddled around in his robe pockets for the vial he had stuffed away.
Draco paused before knocking on the door to the Headmistress’s office. This was the third time he had been in this room this past year. Of course, the first two times, he had been alone. Now, there was McGonagall, and he didn’t want to see Dumbledore or Snape again either.
when he became even more angry at Snape, for telling him all the rules of asking it questions, and looking so confident that it would work and that it would provide them with answers. “One of my finer achievements,” Snape had told him, regarding the book.
“You- you’re-” Harry stuttered slightly.
“So you’re still not fully healed?”
Out of all of their problems right now, that one was probably the biggest and most difficult to deal with. And that said a lot. There were only two of them, in a castle filled with sleeping bodies, and no place to sleep. Potter wouldn’t allow them to split up, he said it wasn’t safe to be alone, since now they were both pretty sure someone had intentionally cast a sleeping curse and trapped them so they couldn’t go farther than Hogsmeade and contact the outside world. It
Once they sat down at their own table near the fire, and had their Butterbeers and Fire Whiskeys out in front of them, Draco felt more than content. He wasn’t exactly socializing, just talking to Pansy and Blaise, and that was perfect for him.
Kaspian was probably the most fake person Draco had the displeasure of meeting. He would smile and make polite conversations with every professor, winning them over with his charming grin. But when there weren’t any adults around he was vicious and nasty, and he got away with it every time. The most infuriating part was that the trio didn’t seem to
Clearing his throat, Draco said with astonishment clear in his tone, “Thank you, Headmistress. Thank you so much.”
“I'm surprised
He wished he hadn’t given into Potter’s quips and had stood his ground, now that he made his way to the front entrance of the school. His healing injuries definitely did not appreciate all the walking Draco had done that day, and surely weren’t going to appreciate the long trip to and from Hogsmeade at all. He thought of poor Madame Pomfrey, all alone in her room, who had told him he shouldn’t leave bed for about three days.
Draco nodded hesitantly.
. Potter was apparently thinking the same thing. He had his mouth open, and Draco itched to say something along the lines of, “You’ll catch flies, Potter. Stop gaping like a complete idiot.” But he was sure Potter would slap him.
“No. It’s okay. I want you to know the full story.”
the prejudiced Death Eater here. It’s
Draco jumped out of the bed, mad that Harry could make out his form even without his glasses.
Harry held him tighter. He held him closer and more lovingly and wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, folding his hands at Draco’s stomach. They were still sitting in the snow, and the snow was still falling freely. The wind had luckily died down a bit, but the temperature was still freezing. The heat from Harry’s body, however, made him warm. He felt like he had the universe at his back, at his waist, and at his shoulder, where Harry was resting his chin.
to think they were all connected in some way.
He couldn’t help but laugh. “I just wanted to say thank you-- for everything, for anything.”
Suddenly he was in the Slytherin common room, and Pansy was running up to him, jumping into his arms and crying, getting her makeup all over Draco’s shirt, not that he cared in the slightest. It was a most incredible feeling.
Despite the fact that he was already feeling much better ever since he woke up, he downed the potion in one gulp, and was surprised to find that it did not taste as horrible as it looked.
“Silence him, Alec,” Drys said, unbothered by the outburst.
He had had many nightmares, where this exact scenario happened. He’d always wake up in a cold sweat, and instantly look at his arm to make sure he was dreaming. Every single time it had been a part of his dreams, except this time, and he seriously had no clue what to do. He was too scared to do anything. He had not been prepared for this to happen, and he now wished he would have been.
Potter and him continued their search in total silence, not even talking to acknowledge that they had so far found no one else awake. When they had stopped to peer into the window of Honeydukes, Potter eyed all the sweets inside very obviously, and Draco watched as his eyes lit up respectively. There was something about Potter’s child-like demeanor that was consoling.
He was about to finish burying himself under the warm blankets, when he felt his heart give a small tug, leaving a burning ache traveling throughout his body. He tried to push away the feeling that was attempting to wrap around his insides, but he couldn’t this time. The worst part was, he now thought he knew why he constantly had this strange feeling, a feeling that only came over him whenever he was talking, looking, or anywhere near Harry.
To his surprise, Harry didn’t grimace and tell him that of course they weren’t friends. In fact, he said the exact opposite. “Do you really think that after spending almost two weeks with you and only you, we wouldn’t be friends? Of course we’re friends, Draco. I might have been skeptical at first, but I think that when we’re not fighting, we actually get along pretty well.”
Draco tensed and stood motionless, afraid that one movement would result in something very bad.
The article went on to state in full detail everything that went down That Night. Draco was horrified that everyone now knew in detail what had accumulated between Drys and him. But looking around the Great Hall, with all eyes set on him and not in an air of loathing, was one of the best feelings he’d ever experienced. He briefly wondered which Auror had been the source, and why they would do such a thing for him.
were angry?” Draco said at last. “You looked so- so angry. Are you angry at me?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry didn’t need to respond, for the gleam in his eyes was worth a thousand words. The kiss he gave Draco was strong enough to wipe out the world.
They kissed for
“So, you’re pretty close with Parkinson, yeah?” Potter spoke from beside Draco.
That stung. Badly.
Who cared what everyone else thought of him? Who cared if the world saw him as an evil villain? Well, Draco did. Draco cared a great amount. But he wasn’t about to let that stop him from finding the man he loved.
He was about to get up and leave when Harry grabbed his hand and pulled him back down. He reluctantly obliged, sitting back next to Harry, slightly leaning into his side. Harry didn’t let his hand go. Instead, Harry linked their fingers together, squeezing his hand.
“So, uh, should we just go back to Hogwarts then?” Potter asked as he and Draco left the Hog’s Head, both of them pulling on their scarves and gloves to brave the harsh cold.
Every person in Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, who hadn’t just been killed, stayed asleep under the curse, never to wake up again.
“I-- I think I’ll be right back.” He bolted from his seat, leaving his bag and belongings behind, and headed for the main doors. Once he reached the large stretch of lawn, grass that he and Harry had walked on countless times together, that was far away from the castle, he started to run.
He paused for a second, figuring out what the fuck to say. “Would you believe me if I said no?”
Draco looked down at his Muggle attire, and then looked back up at Harry. “Well, if we’re going on-” He stopped himself. He was going to say
“Yeah, that. I think we could’ve been friends. We’re not much different, you and I.”
The second week back was when Draco realized
“McGonagall suggested it.”
“Oh shut
Draco nodded in agreement. “That’s fair enough.”
“So, you know, at the end of all of it, the Killing Curse hit me,” Draco stated like it was a blatant fact, which it was.
The future wasn’t certain, but he knew one thing that was. For Harry was right there in front of him, and Draco would never let go.
Of course Harry wouldn’t be scared, though. He single handedly fought the Dark Lord on multiple occasions. Whatever Sunday brought would probably be nothing compared to what Harry had had to deal with.
He could say no. He could run out and hide somewhere Harry would never find him. Not face the inevitable slow dance with the man who he fancied. It was the easy choice. Not facing his feelings.
Pansy was standing in the doorway, with her hands on her hips and a quirk to her mouth. She was trying to come off as bored, mixed with irritation, but her amusement was certainly not covered.
Right. So, Draco
signature facial expression, or whatever. Second, Harry looked incredibly handsome when he was smug, and made Draco hyper-aware of his so-called
That it was impossible for Harry to have any thoughts other than loathing and hatred directed at Draco. That because of this reason, Draco was miserable. Harry was the reason he was miserable, despite all the good and all the progress that had come to him since the Curse.
Harry rubbed his eyes, and Draco hoped he was blind enough without his glasses to not notice his presence.
Draco couldn’t believe they were making small talk. He couldn’t believe how skilled he was at making conversations awkward, either.
busting us and getting us in trouble.” Potter’s tone turned a little defensive when he mentioned his little club, and Draco suddenly felt incredibly guilty.
Harry grabbed at Draco’s hand again, pulling it away from scratching his arm, and instead holding it tightly in his own hands.
“Since there's two photographs, we can each take one, if you’d like.” Harry sounded unsure.
“Draco, you need to eat breakfast. Seriously,” Pansy advised from the seat across from him in the the Great Hall.
Instead, the Aurors had jumped to the conclusion, after seeing the part where Draco had killed Drys, that Draco was to blame for all that they knew had happened during the two weeks (which wasn’t a lot to begin with) and immediately placed Draco under arrest, even though Draco had still been in a fucking coma.
Fuck. Harry was as sentimental a bastard as Draco was.
Somehow his vision from that night lit a fire inside him, and it made him feel different: more alert and collected. He guessed it had been because he and his family were threatened by some psychopath, and now he felt more motivated than ever to get the potion finished, and be ready for a fight if it came down to it.
“After all you went through. Surely, you are hurting.” Her eyes were filled with understanding. “I’d be concerned if your mental health wasn’t even a tiny bit affected by everything.”
IMPORTANT: Draco's Bday is coming up on June 5th. That's it. I just thought everyone should know if you don't already. So mark your calendars and make sure to wish him a happy birthday
Two Death Eaters standing behind the one in the front grabbed Drys by his arms, while the rest of the group trampled through the house, working smoothly and without any sort of hesitation. There were three Death Eaters who stayed out in front of the house, though, in a clump and talking to one another.
“No-”
Theo laughed.
It wasn’t Alec Kaspian, though, Harry’s sort-of-friend. It was someone named Drys Kaspian, scrawled next to someone named Olive Brightly, with a messy heart drawn in between the two names.
“Yeah, I’m fine,” Draco swallowed. “Thank you for… pushing me out of the way.”
Draco nodded at Harry, and Harry lightly pressed his fingers over the ugly scar that marred the right side of his face. “Well,” Draco coughed, “Uh, you see, it was from that day… in Myrtle’s bathroom…”
Harry opened his mouth, then closed it. Instead of saying something, he squeezed Draco’s hand, and then let go.
“Then why do you consider us
He just… he just wanted to keep his mind blank for a while. It hurt; trying to sort things out. It hurt having to come to new terms with himself.
It was clearly night out, and as he sat up a little in bed, he found that he couldn’t sit up all the way due to a million aches on his body. He then noticed there was a man standing in the corner of the room.
Their lips met in a soft and slow kiss. Draco was hesitant at first, not really knowing the boundaries of what they were doing, but when Harry moved his mouth against Draco’s, Draco followed right on cue.
plan a huge event for her best friend. It was his fortieth birthday. He was
He just wanted the damn thing gone. More than ever now. He didn’t want to have to keep looking at it every time it started burning. He had stared into the eyes of the skull more times that past week than he had any other times that school year.
“Alright,” Snape said.
It also meant Potter would most likely trust him again.
“What? Of course you have! Or else he wouldn’t be lying at the edge of the forest, not responding to anything I do or say!”
“Not at all,” Draco breathed. “It’s just strange. I’ve wanted this my entire life. And I’ve wanted people to see that I’ve changed since the end of the war; I got that chance now, and I’m beyond happy that now people will give me a second chance… but…”
Draco crossed his arms tighter around him and looked Potter dead in the eye. “I woke up, and you were gone.” His voice sounded quiet and small, and he hated how it had come out like that.
A nagging voice entered the back of his head, saying how Drys and Olive were Mudbloods, and Mudbloods weren’t strong Wizards, and couldn’t possibly create this Garden with organisms, living off of artificial sunlight alone. He quickly shook his head, willing the thought to leave his brain, telling himself
“You wanna know something else?” He rasped, reluctantly pulling back from Harry.
About two days after finding out his father had died, Draco was still constantly wondering where Harry was, and why hadn’t he come to visit yet. So, finally, he worked up the courage to casually ask Pansy about Harry.
. “You can’t-”
He opened his eyes slowly reluctantly, and noticed rain was still pouring down, thunder rumbling somewhere in the distance. He’d been too engaged in his memories of his night before to notice the storm.
Harry’s lips felt like fire and ice. Like something he shouldn’t be touching. But the thing was, he was touching them.
Draco grimaced. “I am aware.”
“So, you see, Drys showed me what the future would be like if I didn’t join him and if I did join him. Long story short, both were horrible options. But, I was inclined to choose one.” He didn’t go into all the details, just gave her enough information so that she could follow along and understand what he was saying. He purposefully told her he felt this strong tug throughout his
Draco smiled at her while clutching his bag. “I can do that.”
Draco took it.
Drys was standing directly over him now, and Draco realized he had lost the duel. He had lost, which meant there was no chance of bargaining their lives now. Harry would die. Draco would be forced to watch him die, along with numerous other innocent lives. He would be condemned to think about how he had failed everyone.
Pansy and Draco sat down next to each other, and Draco clenched his hands in his lap. It was going to be fine. He just had to give simple one word answers when they were asked of him and soon the session would be over before he knew it.
That meant seeing Madame Rosmerta. The woman who he
on Harry. He now had to do it once again, for a much, much bigger acknowledgement.
Harry was unconscious, which definitely wasn’t a good sign, but Draco quickly pulled out his wand, his free hand keeping pressure on the cut in his wrist where blood was gushing out the most.
Time wasn’t an obstacle anymore when Draco got to hold onto Harry. Nothing was an obstacle when he had Harry by his side.
Draco couldn’t help it; he let out a miserable scream, due to his Dark Mark flaring up, and seeing
“Draco, this- this place is amazing!” Harry exclaimed, cutting through Draco’s introspection. Harry had his back to Draco, sticking his hand into the water.
“I promise you, I won’t.”
I’m still in the library. It’s not like I’m leaving the room. I’ve gone back there by myself plenty of times.”
“I don’t care because you’ve grown. You’re a completely different person than you were years ago. Of course, it’s important to acknowledge the past, and help it guide you to become a better person in the present and future, but you shouldn’t let it haunt you for the rest of your life.” Harry let his hand find Draco’s and he squeezed it tightly. “You’re a good man, Draco.”
Potter scoffed and went back to peering down at the instructions.
Draco nodded his head. He knew he wouldn’t be able to go back to sleep after having slept for such a long time, but he could happily lay in bed and not have to worry about anything.
“Well after you told me you spoke Latin, the next day in the library when you were off browsing the books in the library, I found a book on Latin nearby, and decided to take a look for myself. The first page I opened to was phrases regarding the stars and the sky and stuff, and I read a phrase that stuck with me, ‘Ad Astra Per Aspera’.”
He pulled out a book in the
Pansy rushed up to him and gave him a hug, spilling a tiny bit of the champagne she was holding.
“Well, your first and
Draco quickly looked away.
“DRACO!” Harry shouted over all of the noise, loud and clear. “DRACO, NO-”
“Yeah. About myself, about how alone I was, how I was suffering… even-- uh, even my own sexuality.”
“Fine. I’ll guess I’ll have to go and find Blaise and
He immediately regretted shouting in the middle of the halls, where there were loads of people strolling about. From his peripheral vision, he thought he saw everyone turn to face him and Potter. He was still looking at Potter, he wasn’t brave enough to turn his head and stare into the faces of numerous accusing eyes. Potter glanced down at where he was still touching Draco, and let go, almost as if he had realized he was holding fire, and it had been burning him, only to notice it too late.
“So what are you suggesting we do? Break into one of the shops?”
“I suppose,” Draco huffed.
It was Monday morning and the post arrived, owls flying through the crowds of people and nipping at the steaming breakfast that littered the tables.
After Granger, they went around in a circle, which meant Potter got to go last. Draco truly never envied Potter as much as he did that moment. When it eventually got to Draco, he totally blanked on what to say. He didn’t have a good thing that happened to him. Even if he did, he most certainly couldn’t think of one. It was like all the awful events that occurred were flooding his brain and making it impossible to think of anything else but dreadful memories. He thought about his mother, and how she planned on selling the Manor, which led him to think of the Dark Lord, which led him to think of Potter, his hand on Draco’s wrist. Draco took a glimpse at Potter, who was staring at him with his terribly bright green eyes, waiting intently for him to answer the most simple question.
was what irked Draco. The fact that Potter still hung around him even after he did stuff like call out how Draco didn’t have a partner so he’d purposely be paired up with Potter.
If people were incidentally awake, he would have to
Draco shook his head violently. He was usually an excellent liar, but his heart was pounding like crazy and he could feel the blood rushing through his veins, along with a ringing in his ear; he supposed Harry would be able to see right through his lies when he replied to Harry’s question. “Uh, no. Nothing. Just the wind.” Draco gestured outside, where it was in fact insanely windy, blowing around dead leaves and snow.
Harry’s expression softened the smallest bit. If Draco hadn’t been studying every last inch of Harry’s face, he wouldn’t have been able to see it. “I don’t know what I am, honestly. Mostly confused, I guess.”
“Why crumpets? That’s so
“Yeah, yeah. It’s just that this is kind of
Draco really wished he could see Alec’s face right now.
In the back of his mind, he knew it all made complete sense.
The Auror woman moved closer to her shorter colleague, and Draco got to see who else had entered the room, hidden behind the woman. It was his mother.
charm, seeing that it was about eight o’clock. He realized he hadn’t eaten all day. Maybe Pansy was right, maybe he really couldn’t take care of himself properly.
He turned away from Potter, clutching his arm and willing himself to think of happy thoughts.
Draco stepped a little closer, aiming to congratulate him by patting him on the back, but Potter apparently thought he was doing something completely different, so they ended up in an awkward hug-like-stance with Draco hesitantly touching Potter’s shoulder blade, his lips close to Potter’s ear and Potter’s breath on his neck.
Countless times before, Draco remembered feeling like the world had stopped when he and Harry were in close proximity. But now, the world was aflame, and everything was alive, and the world was dancing around them, letting time and space kneel to their every need.
He was positive Pansy was up to some evil scheme, like she usually was. Probably busy turning his house into a club or an open mic night for his birthday. He would kill her if she was.
“That would be good,” Draco said sheepishly.
“Yeah? Everything okay?” Harry asked, looking up from his wand, which had been twirling in his hand.
Draco raked his mind, gauging deeper and deeper, trying to think of
“But-”
Draco on the other hand really had nothing to do. He was the one doing the brewing, and Harry was the one learning spells. They each had their respective time slots of being useful and productive, and lucky for Harry- he had a bigger window of productiveness than Draco’s fifteen minutes of brewing two times a day.
A more frightening thought: Draco
“Here,” Harry said, and Draco clutched the vial tightly. Harry wasn’t even breathing hard anymore, and Draco suspected that if anyone had turned the corner and saw Harry at that exact moment, they wouldn’t have known Harry had just sprinted down the dungeon corridor.
Day four of trying to save the world started off just like day three. Literally exactly the same. Draco woke up with no visions that night. Potter had no nightmares. They took showers, got dressed, and ate breakfast in the Room of Requirement before making their pit stop to the Gryffindor and Slytherin common rooms, where they observed no one had moved a muscle. The discovery had been outstandingly shocking.
Waking up felt like a full lake of ice water to the head; cold and severely unpleasant. He wasn’t sure where he was- everything was distorted. He didn’t feel like opening his eyes, for fear of facing more cold unpleasantness.
Draco tried not to focus on Kaspian, and instead busied himself with finishing measuring and pouring the knotgrass in the potion. He could already sense that this conversation was going to take a wrong turn.
Draco sprung up from his seat, along with everyone else in the room, and was about to grab his bag from beside his chair when he felt a tap on his shoulder. He flinched at the touch, and spun around to find Elizabeth standing there.
He ran a hand through his hair, walking out of Slytherin and into the halls of the dungeons. It was sort of weird, the fact that he was hoping someone else would have been awake, so that he wouldn’t have to be alone with Potter, and at the same time he was hoping no one else
“Let’s just try some other way. There has to be some charm that will get this bloody book to work.”
“Like I said, you have known Potter since you were eleven. Alec does not have a connection with Potter like you do, Draco.”
When Draco stepped out of the bathroom, he found Potter sitting on his bed, eating breakfast.
“Yes, Miss Granger. He might not have been if you would have arrived minutes later, but I can assure you he will be just fine.”
“Oh cut the crap!” Pansy exclaimed, grabbing his shoulder and squeezing it. “Tell me everything.”
He feels himself nod. He takes a tentative step into the room and shuts the door.
She misses her. Constantly. She wishes they were born on the same side. That she could see the light that Luna has always known.

. “Wait.” he whispers, and Draco’s hand trembles in his grasp.

he thought.
. You have to help him.”
Draco can’t count the gashes. The skin is ripped and torn to shreds, all of them overlapping, and blood nearly black. They look so deep- so much deeper than Draco’s own.
. He doesn’t remember what happiness feels like. He’s touched the darkness, and it only grew.
, Harry!”
“Hurts,” Harry breathes, “Doesn’t it? When we just keep circling each other.”
Harry surfaces with a yell that does more to irritate him than it probably should, but the relief is overwhelming.
“I didn’t know what it did.”
Draco is quiet. He stares at the boy now laying in the bed, sheets turned down under him, and palms facing up, the bandages already vaguely red under the gauze. "I don't think he wanted her. I don’t think he wanted her to know."
"Stop," Draco huffed, and Harry stalled, not quite pulling up. "Harry, stop."
"I wore my invisibility cloak."
"He likes quidditch. Me, apparently. He's always eating sweet rolls," Harry said, uncertain.
"What are you saying?"
Snape eyes him wearily but drops the issue for the moment, moving to take a small green bottle from his bag and place it on the table beside his cot. “I brought you dittany. For your wounds.”
Luna stands and presses the journal into her hands, lingering for just a moment before bringing her lips to Pansy’s forehead.
"I told you I don't like surprises," Draco warned, but Harry could see the hint of a smile on his face as he turned away. Harry pushed the door open, and light flooded out from inside the room.
"Sorry," Harry said awkwardly.
Harry stood silently by as some of the Gryffindors turned to stare at him accusingly. Harry bit his lip.
"I need to get some sleep," Harry mumbled.
He had bought another at the beginning of the year, but it didn't work the same as his first wand, causing him to often leave it behind in the dorms. The hair on his neck stood on end, and the shuffling outside finally came to a stop.
Luna arrives at precisely six minutes past seven, due to an unexpected collision with a Hufflepuff first-year carrying three dozen rolls of parchment, opens the heavy oak door and steps through it, feeling a surge of warmth through her as she sees Pansy waiting for her. The dark-haired girl hears it slam closed, turning to see Luna waiting on the other side of the classroom.
Harry thought. But he wasn't already missing Draco of course (
He doesn’t give her a moment to attack, before he can tell there are tears dripping from his eyes, but he doesn’t have time to feel ashamed. “I-I think Harry tried to kill himself. Please Granger.
Harry thought. He laughed as heartily as he could- too late.
“Looney?”
Some insisted he
Harry presses his forehead against Draco’s, and his fingers move to dig into his waist in one movement. “Just let me have this. For now.” His other hand is shaking at Draco’s side. “Just-“
"What?"
"Six years ago I wasn't aware you were such a dunce."
Pansy bit her lip. “We’ve met a few times- she knew before I did. I’m not the kind of person who can be with her.
? Did the Gryffindors know about the scars on his arms and the wound on his leg? If they did, why weren't they stopping him? Could they?
"I was under the impression that you wanted to speak to me about this, not just sit and stare at me in silence."
He can't breathe. His nails dig into his palms and draw blood. He wonders if Harry can feel it.
Holy cow guys. I have SO much planned for this fic it's insane! I finally figured out where I want to end it and let's just say I have my work cut out for me... And some of you may try to kill me.

But there’s a voice behind it, small, that he can’t ignore.

always wanted a sibling too."
"Busy," he calls.
He finds Harry sitting against the bathroom wall, his shoulders hunched forward, and eyes fixed on the ground,
“You can tell me, Draco. I’m not going to say anything.”
“I’m not going to let you
The curtains open and shut before Draco shifted up to look at Harry once more, smiling. "She likes you."
"Draco, honestly. What's the worst that could happen?" Pansy huffed. "You've been whining for over a year now! I'm sick of it. Go tell scarhead how you feel or

Harry scowled, retrieving his cloak from the boys' dormitory before opening the portrait hole and slipping out. His feet hit the stone in an uneven pattern, the hollow sound bouncing off the walls of the empty hallway. Harry didn't know what to do. He felt sick to his stomach thinking about seeing Draco right now, he was sure fighting just minutes after accepting a formal courtship wasn't a good sign. It was at least
There’s a throb in his chest and Draco stands and rips towels off the hooks on the wall before kneeling again beside Harry. He lets out a small sob as Draco lifts his arm and wraps it in one of the towels, tight, and Harry reaches up and grabs his wrist and looking at him blearily, his breathing labored and hands sticky with blood. “I didn’t mean to. I didn’t,” he mumbles.
"You okay?" Harry asked.
"Getting
"Harry?" he hissed. A mop of dark brown hair popped though the curtains, green eyes meeting his own. "What the hell are you doing here?"
She rolls her eyes, and glances at the clock on the wall, before looking back at Draco. “
The pale-skinned boy was gaunt, his skin stretched over his bones as if they could break through his paleness. His shoulders hung crooked, his arms wrapped around his ribcage, fingers digging into each divot. If Harry looked closely, he could see curling black lines across his skin, like handwriting, but unlike nothing he could call manmade. Harry couldn't put his finger on why he felt like something was wrong, but he felt it with every gasp that followed his waking, the burn of his eyes, and the unbidden anxiety that settled into his bones.
Draco gasps a breath- his limbs are stiff and his chest hollow, everything comes to a standstill at those words.
"We've already established he won't tell me anything," Harry urged. Hermione eyed him warily.
Draco turned to Blaise beside her, eyes widening as he nodded in agreement. His hands were trembling with his first gift for Harry, an important tradition in courtship. The first gift, the gift of solicitude, was meant to be something generally inexpensive and meaningful—it had taken Draco nearly four months to find what he was looking for. His stomach felt hollow, his palms itchy. His nails left streaks of pink across his light skin where they landed unconsciously. Draco wasn't usually a stickler for tradition, but he thought a formal courtship might be the only way that Harry would take him seriously.
"Hermione," he mumbled. "I need a favor."
, and
Draco pulls his wrist from Harry’s grasp and fingers shaking, takes his hand and squeezes. “I have to get someone, okay?”
There’s a weight sitting heavy on Draco’s chest, digging between his ribs to press hard into his lungs.
"The bond exposes part of it, and if you don't accept it I'll lose it. It'll just... Die."
Harry laughs bitterly and shakes his head. “I thought I could have one good thing. I should have known better. This is the cruelest thing you’ve ever done.”
"Cologne?" Draco said, smiling.
"Up his own arse?" said someone else.
"Well sadly, you're fucking stuck with me till you murder me properly, oh yes, thank
"I would've still wanted to bond with you, I would've just been more careful about it." Harry said quietly.
"Did you live with his parents then? Do you miss them?"
"What the fuck are you reading?"
Luna lives a life she can’t even imagine, filled with her light that wards of the darkness, color instead of gray, endlessly gentle and endlessly kind. Pansy can’t remember the last time she felt soft, like she could spare kindness for someone and not be punished for it. She has always felt this way, always the same, never changing, and Luna never seems to be the same. Always seeking, always who Pansy wishes she could be. She wishes she could join Dumbledore’s Army, be on her side and fight for her, if nothing else- but she doesn’t know how to change.
. He had doubted it for so long, wanted it so badly— but somehow even after they agreed to the bond he couldn't allow himself to believe it.
Hermione blinked twice at him and pursed her lips, nodding. "You'll be on clean-up twice a week. I'll take your slot."
He’s dizzy again, and when he leans down to roll up his boxers, he sees spots. There’s a familiar faintness in his limbs he hasn’t felt since his years at the Dursley’s, the kind of hunger that cramps instead of gnaws- the difference now is that he can’t bring himself to care, but he knows he should.
Harry lifted a hand to Ron's shoulder, smiling grimly. "Alright, Ron."
His face is still pale and his eyes dark, but his hair is wet, hopefully meaning a shower. He seems better, if only a little bit. The air is stale between them, and for the hundredth time today he wishes he had left a note for Harry this morning. He looks like he wants to say something,
, with his far too righteous heroics and his slaying of a
“There isn’t a ‘we’, Potter. There can’t be.”
"What about a hiding place? Somewhere we can stay together for a little while?" Draco said, his tone hushed.
"Do you accept my intention?"
This is a long one (and a heavy one!), especially for me, but I'm glad I finally got it done.
No prefects lead the way up to the West tower; instead, the pathetic exodus was just a shuffling of feet, the Golden Trio way in the front, whispering to one another in the flickering light of the torches.
She feels sick.
"I'll pitch in," said Hermione.
. Almost good. Draco could accept the word 'healthy' as a descriptor for Potter. Sure.
Something curls dark in his chest, heavy and laced with anxiety.
"I know, darling," Narcissa said.
, it doesn't hold an inkling of it for you until the second gift."
"It's not your fault that I need you," he said, with so much emotion on his face Harry felt privileged just to see it. "Well, it is your fucking fault, but-"
"I don't care," Draco sighed. "Right now I just need you to make my head hurt less."
Harry glanced up at Draco, eyes wide and glasses dirty with ash and water marks. A crumb clung to the corner of his mouth. Draco wanted to kiss it away.
"Draco."

"An unfinished bond can kill a wizard Harry! They've exposed a piece of their-" Hermione paused, eyes unsure.
"Bonding ceremony?"
Hermione Granger,

"When will you complete the bond?"
"I've only been trying to tell you that for six years."
"Go," he commands.
in the Great Hall. Apparently Harry's Fangirls-"
But for now, this is all he can offer.
"Yes," Draco replied, leaning into him. A small sound left Draco's lips. "It's better when we're closer."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Feel better, dear," she said, looking oddly satisfied with the exchange between her son and Harry. "Take care of my boy, Harry."
It looked like he might have to go back up for it at this rate anyway.
“I know,” Pansy whispers, her voice laced with something like an apology.
. Please,
"You two are just adorable!" said a voice suddenly. Narcissa stepped through the curtains. "Adorable!" Her pale complexion lit up, her eyes bright in the afternoon light.
"Then where would I sleep?" Harry pointed out.
When Draco was ten, his father began sculpting him into a 'proper Malfoy heir'. Afternoons that he used to spend wandering the sprawling grounds, or with his mother, he now spent in his father's study, or in the dungeons practicing the proper form for dueling. Just before his eleventh birthday, his father announced he would be taking Draco to another pureblood family's gala, where he would meet the girl he was promised to at birth.
When I step into the dining room, Mum smiles at me and runs over to embrace me, accidentally getting some of her silver hair in my mouth while I gasp in surprise.
Groaning, he kisses me again while snaking his fingers to my entrance.
The Chosen One stands over the crumpled form of Neville Longbottom. Neville, it seems, has lost weight and carries the faint grey tint to gis skin that one may associate with long-term illness. Mortified, Draco turns on his heel, wishing to leave.
It was sawed off crudely, removed from a Muggle stripper aged 19 years old. At least I've lived longer than her. When it was given to my department for study, the tattoos had been burned off, skin cauterized where inky black images of butterflies should have been. The wrist bones had been hit with a curse that turned the bones into fine powder, causing me to nearly drop it when it was placed in my arms, feeling more like a dead, scaly fish rather than a human limb.
That night, Dobby came to me with very unsettling news. No sooner had he apparated in my room, eyes red rimmed and brimming with terrified tears, than Klaus had jumped on him, eliciting a surprised squeak from the elf.
He grabs my wrist with one hand, his other arm snaking beneath me, my body limp as Adelphis warm corpse. I let out the beginning of an offended squawk, but his mouth is on mine, swallowing the sound before I can finish.
Setting aside the spade and breathing in fresh air, that's when she hears it - a peacock in pain and the crackle of a fire. Fuck.
"Dobby, what does that-" FWOOP!!
"Now's your chance, Draco," Father says when Potter walks toward the stairs. "Go provoke him. I'll see if I can hide the diary on him, since you probably aren't clever enough to."
"I think I'd like that very much, Harry."
"Sorry, babe," said Pansy.
"I am aware, you came in both ends. But I must agree, I think I could get used to spending time with you... Harry."
"Mother, what does he mean by protector marks? And aren't grindstones used to make flour?" She ignores my questions entirely, slathering raspberry jam on some sourdough before fixing me a look as if to say 'well dig in, now. what are you waiting for?' and I oblige, only just realizing how hungry I was. I fill my plates with a mountain of food, turning to Mother as a question enters my mind, "Do I have to eat more, now that the Veela part of me is maturing?" She nods and gestures for me to continue eating.
“Yes.”
“Come off it,” he responded, not in the least bit annoyed, leaning down to pick up the journal Draco dropped.
He remembered one time, during the first week of the new school year at Hogwarts, Draco had gotten beaten up pretty badly. They hadn’t even used their wands against him. Just beat him up the muggle way.
“Okay, hold still.” Harry moved closer, bending down somewhat over Draco’s face with his wand out.
name.”
Potter stood a little bit in front of Draco, facing the streets of Hogsmeade, which were completely empty. Lights illuminated the streets, making it easy to see in the dark; it was definitely a creepy sight. It felt like a ghost town.
“You were making noises, you sounded like you were in pain. I thought you might have been having a nightmare,” Potter said. “I know how those feel like. I didn’t think it would have been fair if I was awake and watching you suffer, so I thought I should wake you-”
When they both arrived at the classroom that was converted into their therapy space, they each took a deep breath and proceeded into the room. The room was spacious, wide enough to hold about fifty kids, and smelled like chalk and old books. It wasn’t decorated at all, and had no furniture in it, except for a colorful rug and around twenty chairs. There were maybe around forty Eighth Years in total, but therapy sessions were split into two groups. Draco, lucky for him, got stuck with the group that had Potter, Kaspian, Granger, and Theo in it. He didn’t have anything against Granger, it was just that every time he looked at her his stomach did a weird flip-thing that he knew was guilt. Guilt that he once called her foul names and guilt that she was tortured in his own house.
He didn’t need his mind to keep reminding him. His heart knew.
“Tell me more about this Muggle music of yours,” Draco added swiftly.
“You’re sure?”
“Let’s just get this over with,” He muttered. He instantly regretted saying anything out loud. He didn’t even realize he
At one point during their walk, Potter tripped over some rock buried in the snow, landing face first into the icy ground. Draco thought of how similar the moment was to when they had both walked back from Hogsmeade late at night while it had snowed, and Potter had slipped on a patch of ice.
He could vaguely see Blaise and Jorah Davis frozen to watch the spectacle, sitting on Davis’ bed.
“Hmph-” A certain someone said as Draco ran into Potter’s back, thanks to his wandering mind. Potter smelled of broom wax and sweets, Draco thought; he could tell due to their awkward close proximity.
“You do know you're a wizard, right, Potter?” Draco pointed out, just to make sure Potter did know that.
“Great.”
every step of the way. He was now on the main floor, poking his head into classrooms and the Great Hall. No luck.
Her smile is wide at first, dropping down in time with the droop of her eyelids as the life leaks out of her in time with the blood covering the ground. She breathes in, a rattling noise not far off from a Dementors breathing, before exhaling shakily. I see the exact moment she lets herself go. I can practically see her battling with Death as he hangs over the serial murderer. Then, Adelphis limp body falls into me, and the blood drips slow. No longer can you see her pulse in the rapid growth of the sanguine puddle beneath her.
"No, it's just awkward," he says shakily, examining the bottle labeled Salazar's Silicon Slicke. "Give me a reason and I will," he adds as an afterthought. Harry frowns at the blond, who is now coating his long pale fingers, bent over the edge of the tub.
It was hard for me to wrap my head around. She had cousins who lived in this lake. I can't help but wonder if I had any Veela cousins, and if so, where they might be. My Veela grandmothers were all slaughtered before I could make substantial memories of them.
"You dumb whore, you don't know anything, do you? Veela blood is blue, you blithering idiot. Salazar in a thong, you're dim."
"Pansy Parkinson, Slytherin." "Draco Malfoy, Slytherin." We reply in unison.
"Hey Harry?" Draco asks his boyfriend of two months tentatively.
"You're lucky that we have guests today, otherwise you would not be allowed any meals today. Even so, do not take more than you are offered. You and your bitch of a mother make a mockery of my name," he spits at me. "Get up, bathe, dress yourself, and collect yourself like a proper Malfoy man. When you have finished, you will copy pages from Most Potente Potions and practice brewing Veritaserum. If you fail you will go without eating tomorrow." He leaves my bedroom, leaving me sitting on my bed, face unhealed and bleeding.
The Black Lake seemed to be a favorite of Pansys. She made us sit with her at the beach, telling us anecdotes of how her grandfather had studied Mermish and started dating a Nixie in his 6th year at Hogwarts.
"Oh, well, Draco," Adelphi growls, baring fanglike teeth, "you and I share some desires, it seems. No, I don't smell Potter, I smell blood. I smell decay. I smell sweat and grime and the filthy stench of sex. We aren't that different, you know..." I doubt that. "Ha! You think I'm lying! How cute.
"They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean."
I must go to Lucius' office. I must wait for him. I must let him take care of Draco.
"Oh yes, you're worthless, just as Father tells you. You aren't strong whatsoever, you've never been." A grazing of acrylic talons against my scalp. "You've always wanted in your enemy's pants, you fag." Fingers wrapping around my hair, my cock twitching mutinously. "You can't hide it, Draco. You like this." The blade of her knife slicing a lightning bolt on my forehead. "There. Now you and him have something in common." Ropes tightening, nearly cutting into my arms.
"Pans!" I choke, confused.
"What?"
"I hate him."
"Potter, sit," he says in a voice higher than his usual drawl. Potter raises an eyebrow in question. "Sit on the edge of the pool so I can gag on your cock." Potter smiles and gestures with his hands as if to say go on. "Potter, please?" He whines out.
I've become promiscuous... A slut, if you will. I'm a regular at multiple bars and nightclubs, and will bring home whomever will have me. It doesn't matter to me. I've fucked into too many slick cunts, bottomed for too many burly men, and partaken in too many orgies to count. My latest catch, last night, was a delicious little lady with a brightly colored, spiked mohawk and sharp stilettos who offered to step on me. At that thought, I rub absentmindedly at the bruises dotting my sides and suck on my lower lip.
"Alrighty, then! This is getting boring! Spin the bottle?" His request was met with a surprising amount of agreement, though many grumbled on about how that was only the first round of Never Have I Ever. He reaches to his right, grabbing a nearly empty butterbeer bottle from Dean, who was currently preoccupied with the drawing of Seamus he held in his lap.
(See the end of the chapter for
The sight Narcissa is met with when she turns is nearly too much for her to process. Her son, fists aflame as he glares at a burning cherry tree. Maximus, Lucius' favorite peacock, dead in the dirt, singed feathers and neck at a gruesome angle. Blazing blossoms floating in the air, catching on the wind and flying away. Draco, his face with a snout quite similar to a dragon, his ears elongated and pointy, his arms covered in baby blue scales and tipped with talons. The sight of the wings sprouting from his shoulders - silvery blue, veined with gold, batty membranes, dragonesque. Maybe naming him Draco didn't help her luck. Oops.
"Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley. I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those." I'm hit with a pang of guilt when I realize it's probably true. Mr. Weasley walks over to his kids and Harry, towing along the twins with him.
"Your Father is gone for now, my dragon." She pulls back and I can breathe again, suddenly free from her highly perfumed bosom. "This is a very important day, Draco." I look up at her, confused. "Your twelfth birthday, dear! Your Veela aspects are beginning to mature, darling, and soon you'll be able to take full advantage of your ancestry! Don't tell your father I said that, my dragon." She winks at me before turning to the dark oak dining table. It runs along the huge room, about two thirds the length of the House tables at school, and be fitted with white placemats for today's festivities. Dobby walks in right then, arms laden with trays of toasts, jams, cheeses, sausages, bacon, and multiple different fruit juices. He bows to us, smiling first at me before turning his grin to my mother.
But then that fat fuck Quirrel came in, sprinting flat out, just to announce the presence of a troll and pass out at the Headmasters feet.
"Peeves, maybe?" Blaise offers.
"Gizzy hasn't been seen, PanPan is worried about what her father might have done," I catch him up to speed while Pansy nods, confirming my assessment. When she broke her arm last year and her parents refused to Heal it, Gizzy was the house elf who took care of her. They had become very close, but every time the elf got caught meeting with the girl or bringing her food when she was in trouble, Pansy's parents would punish the pair harshly.
"Potter, I'm gonna fucking kill you." They'd been in the RoR for an hour or so, and Draco was getting frustrated with this stupid patronus business.
Pansy hands him a pair of scissors (not his favorite scissors, though; those are fabric scissors) and he slices through the tape gingerly. A squeak issues from inside. He pulls away the flaps of cardboard, and out jump three Nifflers. The first, solid black excepting his beak, immediately tries to eat the shiny wire dress form before Pansy stops him. The second, steel grey with a lighter shoulder stripe, latches itself on Blaise's earring. The third, brown and white with spots on its eyes, holds back for a moment. Then, it jumps on the sewing desk and is dangerously close to inhaling dozens of sewing pins before I grasp it tightly.
At Christmas time, I went home. Mother had missed me dearly, just like in her letter, and would not leave my side unless I was in the bathroom or going to bed. I was relieved to see a friendly face on the first night, when Dobby brought me a hot water bottle before bed. He listened to my stories, fascinated at the way Harry Potter had fought a troll, became a Seeker, held to his broom when it became mutinous, caught the Snitch in his mouth... You'd think Dobby had a crush on him too. Other than that it was the same, except how Father had a new sort of ferocity about me.
"Save me more," I moan tiredly, smacking his face lightly with an outstretched hand and a slight smile, completely unawares he'd take me seriously.
"Squeeze from the sides, but don't press unless you want to collapse my windpipe." He flashes me with a toothy grin, leaning ever closer predatorily.
I had, of course, told Dobby all about the boy. And Pansy. And Blaise. Dobby was my favorite elf. He'd healed me after Father had Crucio'd me the first time. He'd helped us comfort Pansy when Gizzy was killed. He'd kept my secrets, and kept me safe. I told Dobby everything.
Before Draco can even think, Harry is towering over him, pinning the blond to his chest with a growl. "Care for a swim?" Draco nods vigorously. Potter bites his lip and undresses the short blond swiftly. His hands seemed to be everywhere at once, touching Dracos chest, back, sides, hips, arse, neck, arms, and face in a leisurely massage.
Blaise is the one who breaks the silence. "Greengrass, get the fuck out of our compartment before somebody-" he looks at me pointedly "-transforms and burns your face off."
"Oh yeah.... That's why I'm hiding in the dungeons." Draco looks up in horror, unable to run away thanks to the hand in his hair. "I uh, I ran into some vampires when I was hiding from, you know, Voldemort? And Neville-" he gestures to the sunken form of Longbottom on the floor "-let's me feed off him. I need to find a new Feeder though, before I hurt him by taking too much."
"I choke and gag on the words that take up too much space. His words, sinister, constrictive, wrapping around my chest. Eyes burning as the whispers open wounds, blood running down my face as the barrier breaks. In my sinking hysteria a voice screams from the surface. I have to stop before he hurts me. Weeping is for weaklings. Hold your breath. Eyes explode, that won't work. Fear takes hold again. Why am I being punished? He's cursing at the top of his lungs; his tongue is a noose. I gag and I cough, why can't I escape? I wish he would stop, I'm only a child. I was just a kid. Dad, I am just a kid."
"Well for one you're making me angry," I snort. In reply she jams her heel into my diaphragm to make me cough. "I'm scared, okay?!"
Our flying instructor was a half-harpy dyke with yellow eyes sharp as a hawks. A part of me wonders if she teaches flying to the first years due to that part of her: would she be able to transform and save a student mid air? Maybe not, I think to myself when the Longbottom boy plunges to the ground with a sharp CRACK. Madam Hooch leads him off to the medical wing, leaving us with strict instructions enforced with the threat of expulsion. Now I looked about, ready to start a show.
Pansy notices Theo glaring at my new, unnamed Kneazle from her spot at the window seat. I pat my leg to make it come closer, and it bounds across the bed from Theo's place at my pillow to mine at the foot of the green sheeted bed.
"I can smell you, Malfoy." Potter's voice is somewhere between a growl and a hiss, stopping Draco dead in his tracks.
Narcissa knew her mother was a Veela. She knew her father was  half Veela. She knew her mother in law was a Veela, and as such her husband was a partbred as well. She also knew that this could never, never be revealed, to anyone. If their secret came out, Merlin knows what would happen, but Narcissa didn't dare follow that train of thought. Plus, she had more important matters to take care of right now. Such as her son.
"Did you see his face, the great lump?" I shout out at the class. The Patil girl told me to shut up, but Pansy did Not like that, immediately telling Parvati off. That's when I saw it: Nevilles Remembrall.
Draco shoves Harry against the wall, bending slightly to meet their lips together. He reaches out to hold Harry's face, and Harry links his arms around Dracos neck.
Potter just looks on in a terrified sort of way, mouth hanging slightly open.
Waves of pleasure wash over him, sparks zinging up his spine and Draco can't help but moan like his life depends on it. To Harry, it's music. The breathy little whines and loud moans wrested from the blond put Potter in a trance. He loosens up Draco with urgency, doing his absolute best to make the part Veela feel beyond amazing.
Lucius flies out the window, landing directly behind Draco. His long hair whips about him with the wind just as the cherry blossoms are. He points his cane on Narcissa, who is instantly bathed in calm.
I'm still fiddling with the page. Basilisks. That's what Father bestowed upon our school. But what can I do, if anything? Probably not much.
"Harry, I..." Deep breaths, Draco. Deep breaths. "I think I might be falling for you? I-I think I love you." Harry's whole face glows with that absolutely adorable, idiotic grin of his.
"Thanks, Draco, for sharing your piece," she states, motioning me away. I take a seat next to one of the fires and Pansy jumps in my lap, planting a quick kiss on my cheek. "Now, Higgs? Care to come up for your routine?"
"Your blood... It's, it's blue," Harry says stupidly.
"That's Hagrid," the boy says, smiling in a ridiculously adorable way. "He works at Hogwarts."
"How?" Potter looks completely bewildered and somewhat scared, and that's when Draco realizes that he's never done this before.
"Um Draco," Pansy whispers in his ear, "we switched to spin the bottle." Oh fuck. "Potter spun and it landed on-"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Can you conjure a patronus?"
The entirety of the eighth years jaws dropped, everyone staring at a wide eyed Harry Potter as he downed a shot of firewhiskey. He swallows and blinks at the floor for a couple long minutes while his peers mutter amongst themselves, finally raising his gaze and clearing his throat to yell out an overly excited,
"Master Lucius wants to hurt Harry Potter! Master Malfoy wishes to corrupt-" he starts, breaking off into shrieking sobs that shake my bed.
Now, however, I'm feeling extraordinarily stupid. The boy I had a crush on was apparently Harry Potter. The Harry Potter, the one my parents hated. The one who stopped the Dark Lord. The one who, as a baby, prevented me from being forced to commit war crimes at a young age. Naturally, I was going to go see for myself. Mother paid Crabbe and Goyle's parents to make them be my body guards, so of course they had to follow me to the end of the train to get a better look.
"What's on that page anyway, Draco?" Pansy murmurs to the back off my head, nimble fingers flying.
He fucks into me at a searing pace, pulling my bound hands or my hair, biting my neck or shoulders, pushing me as far as I can go into the bed. His weight on my back doesn't allow for me to inhale fully, causing the dizziness from earlier to return in full force. I'm drooling, crying out incoherently, unaware of anything beside the sensations. It goes on for forever - he refuses to remove the cock ring and just let me come.
"Come here often?" The blonde woman to my left speaks up, stuffing some money in our tabletop dancers cleavage.
Thumbing the slit and spreading the precome there, Draco gulps and tries to relax his throat. He licks the tip of Potter's glorious prick, tasting the bitter precome hesitantly, and then a large hand is pushing on the back of Dracos head until Harry's cock is completely sheathed in his throat.
"Hey! Klaus is NOT dumb, Bee and I got it for Dray," Pansy interrupts, snuggling Ophelia to her chest.
I try my hardest to focus on the jar of fairy wings on the shelf across from me, struggling to hide the pain that's fighting to show on my impassive face. Snape stands behind me, probably smirking, stroking my hair with cold, knobby fingers. He had written to Father after catching me partway transformed, and in turn got orders to trim my hair.
"You know, it's not smart to be a slut," she murmurs, using her thumb to wipe tears from my eyes. "It can be quite dangerous, you see." She reaches into the back pockets of her jeans, producing a switchblade in one hand and her wand in the other. My eyes widen in fear, thoughts crashing like waves when I remember what Potter said in the interdepartmental meeting earlier.
Harry flicks his tongue against Dracos pinkened rim, Draco keening in response. It was a glorious noise, and only egged Harry on - almost as though in a Veela-induced trance. {Wink wonk} Potter's tongue flutters forward once more, and Draco continues to thrust on his hand. Grabbing the lube (Draco whining at the loss of the hands around his waist), Harry slicks two fingers before pulling away.
"Play Quidditch at all?" Please have a common interest with me.
"Stop it," Harry says firmly, reaching for Dracos hand to squeeze. "I think I feel the same. Even though I thought I was straight. Or maybe it's just you, you know? Maybe no matter who you kiss, they will never be able to kiss a girl again. You're just that good."
Fat chance at that, huh?
I'm beyond ecstatic to watch Potter perform on a broom again, and it seems my wish will come true on Saturday, as it will be the first Quidditch match of the season:Gryffindor versus Slytherin. By eleven that morning, most of the school could be found in the stands around the pitch, urging the match to start soon.
"Clearly," Father lets his gaze wander to what look to be Granger's Muggle parents, and it's obvious what he is implying. "The company you keep, Weasley... And I thought your family could sink no lower-"
She's screaming at him and leading him away long before I can blink, being woken from my reverie by an elbow to my side and Pansy muttering to me that my pupils are slits instead of circles. My eyes had transformed so I could get a better view, apparently.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Pansy! What the hell?!" I try to push her off my bed but she catches my wrists with slimy, webbed fingers, sneering at me through green lips, baring sharpened teeth.
He hesitates, smirking at the blond before him and catching Malfoys gaze effortlessly. With one tug, his pants and trousers fall to the floor to reveal his bobbing erection. He toes off his shoes and socks, stepping away from the puddle of his clothes to edge nearer to an open mouthed Draco.
"Famous Harry Potter, can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page." I say, ripping a page out of the book Father handed me and pocketing it.
"Draco, I know I avoided answering this question earlier," Mother begins, stirring me from my memories, "but it's only because I was afraid of my own response. Veela have a tradition, one that I will uphold." She turns to me, dropping her empty bucket and grabbing my shoulders. A young emerald hen scrambles off, frightened by the sudden noise, while the older ones hardly flinch, including an exceedingly handsome 7 year old charcoal white eye cock. "I will be giving you protectors marks, a form of tattoo that will guide you through life." She holds up her forearms, tilting them in the sun and her veins sparkled blue. Except those weren't her veins, were they?
"Room of Requirement, nine o'clock?" Harry asks, one dark eyebrow quirked upward.
Draco moans as well, gripping the forearm Harry's wrapped tightly around his front and squeezing hard to encourage the idiot boy behind him to fucking move.
So instead she stands there, staring at Draco; too afraid to punish him, too cowardly to stop him, and hating herself for it all the more. Her husband steps in instead.
"You better trust him!" Pansy exclaims, finally joining our conversation rather than sitting on the windowsill and cooing to Ophelia.
"HOLY MOTHERFUCK!" Potter exclaims, jumping up and splashing a very offended Draco in his haste. "Why - did I - are you?"
"Cucumber."
"Well, I'd be lying if I said I didn't find you attractive, and - what can I say? I like being bitten when I'm bottoming, just ask Blaise."
Vincent had a most terrible idea. He alerted Filch, and Potter would be in trouble. All because I wanted to speak to him alone. At least pretty boy hadn't gotten expelled the next day. In fact, he had instead received a new broomstick and the Seeker position for Gryffindors Quidditch team.
When I wake in the morning, Klaus has replaced Pansy on my lap. She didn't go to her dorm, apparently, because she's still cuddled up beside me. One of our friends must've carried me up, as I'm in my bed rather than sitting next to the fire in the commons.
Sitting in the Great Hall Thursday morning, a commotion came from that idiot four eyes' table. Naturally, I investigated. Turns out Longbottoms gran had sent him a Remembrall, and, having never been in the presence of one before - "it's unbefitting for any wizard who have any sense of dignity" - I picked it up casually so as to inspect it. Mcgonagall came over and thought I was looking for trouble, unfortunately. I decided to check it out next chance I got, which turned out to be that afternoon.
"Good morning." Pansy pokes my nose while she stretches. "Think we ought to see the elves before you go to tryouts?" She asks me quietly, smiling. I poke her little button of a nose before answering.
Snap! Dobby casts a sealing spell on the entrance, preventing Potter and his redheaded tumor from hopping on the train.
"Draco, what's wrong?" Harry whispers, concerned.
"Theodore, stop that," she urges, and I pick up the dark grey cat as Theo had.
"Leave him alone, he didn't want all that!" Yells a ginger girl I haven't seen before, obviously the youngest Weasley.
"Oh, don't worry, I'm not judging. In fact, I think I might borrow some of Bellatrix's tactics. Does the cackling work for me?" Unfortunately it does. "Good, good... I can see your desires, you know; splayed out in your mind like your legs are when you think of our Saviour. Yes, that's right. Be ashamed of yourself, you filthy fucker. I know this turns you on." She reaches for the fragile gold chain around my neck. "Amortentia, yeah? Mind if I take a whiff?"
"He doesn't seem like a pleasant person to me, and when you cursed me after the holidays I heard you talking about him. Does he hurt you?" His stupidly round face is alight with genuine concern.
"Adelphi likes playing with her victims... She's sadistic, and likely gains some sort of grotesque satisfaction in what she does... Most of the dismembered corpses have been found behind bars and stripclubs... We think she takes advantage of sex workers and promiscuous people... Muggles and wizards alike are in danger..."
"Well, also when I top, I suppose... Pansy's a biter." Harry just gapes at him, mouth open. "What, Potter? We're Slytherins, we don't back out of dares and we certainly do not feel shame." Malfoy stares up at the Saviour of the Wizarding world with a bored look before studying the nails of his right hand.
"Hello Slytherins, ladies..." He allows the end of his sentence to hang in the air as he looks across the room. "I'm told you think I'm a Keeper! Which I am, but maybe not in the same regard as you refer. Which is quite unfortunate, really. I think it's probably because my parents aren't absolute pricks obsessed with blood purity." Nobody is certain whether they can laugh, but a couple chuckles sound from across the room. "No don't worry, they don't care. You can laugh! They're Muggles! That, my friends, is why Snape hates my guts..." He continues through his set - which I pay no attention - and causes the common room to erupt with frequent laughter.
"Oh, fuck you."
She practically lunges for me, grasping my shoulders like a lifeline as her tongue slithers in my throat while I whimper. I uncork the vial hanging from my necklace at sniff at it desperately: the scents of treacle tart, rust, broom polish, blood, Potter's favorite cologne, and decay fill my nose. The woman scratches at my chest as she frantically unbuttons my shirt and I nearly pass out from sheer want when her pointed talons of nails draw blood.
"I... I wasn't singing, Potter."
"Draco, are you even listening?" Millicent quips, rolling her eyes at me.
"What's that?" He asks, pointing above my right eyebrow, where Adelphi had carved a lightning bolt into my skin.
"You ruined yet another set of bedsheets," he drawls, expensive rings slicing through my skin as he slaps me. I don't react whatsoever, knowing from experience that would set him off even worse. "Some of my colleagues are coming for tea and lunch later. That Zabini bint and the Parkinson prat are coming with their parents."
"Draco! Happy birthday!" And I'm yet again being shoved into a heavily perfumed bosom, this time belonging to Pansy. "You're sparkly!" She eyes my arms for a second before looking up wide eyed. "Why is it... Red?" I chuckle at her. "Did You pick another fight with the cocks?"
Getting to sleep that night was harder than I could imagine. Pansy was right - her father had killed her best friend. My stomach aches dully, a reminder that I haven't eaten since noon. Blaise had gotten Crucio'd right before departing, as he was displaying some of his gargoyle traits without realizing it. Most Pureblood families have at least a little magical creature blood, but it was unspoken of. Yes, the creature ancestry did give us extra powers. Yes, it lessened incestuous patterns. Yes, it was looked down upon. And so, whenever Pans gets upset and murmurs something in Mermish unknowingly, she gets beat. The harsher punishments were only given if a child showed partbred traits in public, hence why Blaise got to feel the full extent of an Unforgivable Curse at lunch - his ears had pointed and turned grey without his realizing. I wonder how long I can hold back my fire before getting Crucio'd like my mother was in that very moment.
When I look down, my hands are glowing red hot.
"No, it means you're dramatic."
"Draco, please." The blond pulls himself together and meets Harry's eyes. His green gaze is oddly serious, and Draco shakes his head, the room falling into dead silence.
We spend some time talking to him and the elves, discussing what he should make (we decided on lemon poppy muffins) before we had to leave for the pitch. When Pansy and I arrived for my tryout, the entire team seemed to have been waiting for me. I scrunch my brows when I see that all the brooms - dark wooded, polished and sleek - are identical. The newest model. Seven Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones.
What strikes me as odd, however, is that when I open my eyes we aren't at Mungo's - we're at what seems to be Potter's place of dwelling. An ancient looking elf approaches us, running off when Potter barks frantic instructions at it. When it returns, a bottle is uncorked before it is shoved into my mouth unceremoniously and tipped back for me to drink. It tastes like hot leather and copper, and the sensation of cold water splashes up my body. Upon reaching my head, everything becomes clearer to me. Potter brought me to his house.
"Pull up your sleeves, darling." I oblige. Mother grasps my hands and looks over my forearms in a calculating way, before humming to herself thoughtfully. "Vielli Proccio Incantatem," she whispers, waving her wand over my skin slowly. Black marks appear along the exposed flesh, runes covering my arms. Pouring the occamy claws into the bowl containing powdered gemstones and pointing her wand at it, "Vielli Proccio Killisi."
The Golden Boy leans over, allowing his fangs to sink into the tender flesh where neck meets shoulder and sucking up Dracos delicious blood, closing his eyes and savoring the cool, citrusy flavor. He pounds into Draco, listening to him sing an enticing song of pleasure while feasting on the blonds essence. They both come in a blur of color and pleasure, and it takes a moment, sitting in the hot tub together, before Harry notices that something is wrong. Dracos blood is blue.
"Hey Malfoy?" Neville asks as we walk along the path with Fang, Hagrids black boarhound.
Fear. It seems to be the only thing I know. It's always held me in its talons, ripping into my flesh with each feeble attempt to escape it. Fear. It's the driving force behind most of my actions. It only seems to grow stronger with each passing day. Fear. It commands the voices in my head stating "What comes next will be worse" each and every time I receive good news. It's trickling through my mind, my veins, my heart as though it owns me. Fear. It's constant chaos echoes throughout my entire existence. It has always been with me, and it always will be. Fear. Maybe it made me.

Things seemed to have settled into a rhythm of sorts - walk through the castle with an upturned nose, flanked by furious idiots; see Potter, provoke Potter; down my sweets and lose my sense of self for a couple hours; hang out with Pansy and Blaise and the elves until my godfather comes to yell at us. It was fine, up until Halloween.
The shelf is filled with beaten books that he can only guess are muggle, attractive volumes like
He needs to a place to hide. He needs a place to hide because the snow will hide their footprints and the wards in the forest are down for recasting, and he sees it- he's only seen it once before- dark and gilded and tall… he never thought he'd see it again… thought it would never open- but the knob still turns. The room is small, bright, and comfortable. Snow falls outside a large window in the back of the room, and a large fireplace gleams against it, casting his reflection on the glass. A heavy dark wood chair with worn emerald cushions sat against the wall by the fire, across from a large sun bed in the same color. The smell of jasmine floats about the room- and when he lifts the before-unseen mug from a table by the door he finds the source, and it's
Harry’s breath comes quick, making hoarse sounds in his throat as he pulls Draco down closer to him. He could see the tears in his green eyes, the way his lip trembled, and his brows furrowed. “
“Why would you leave the medical wing, Draco?”
Harry’s eyes widen, and his brows crease. His eyes fall away from Draco to stare at the faded diamond pattern on the curtain. For the first time in his life he sees Draco look vulnerable. “I- I’m sorry. I don’t know.”
His hand shakes as he crosses his arm over his chest, clutching his shoulder. “It’s Potter.” His voice trembles.
Draco thought of the flowers. Pansy could have drawn them, he guessed. But then why hide them?
"Just heard of them. Never guessed there would be one at Hogwarts." Draco leaned into the cabinet, peering into the luminescent swirling. The light made his eyes look even more blue. Harry lifted a hand onto Draco's shoulder, and he turned to look back at him.
Harry's still hunched over the desk across the room, his wrinkly school robe balled up haphazardly on the floor, and Draco decides he has no obligation to tell him that there's food here. Serves him right, really, if he's going to ask such an oaf. He lies back in his chair and has just opened the book again when he sees the glimmer of a warming charm falling over the basket. He sighs and picks up his cup, taking a sip to find his tea's gone cold. "Rude," he mumbles.
Draco set his miniature bags on the floor, pointing his wand at them spitefully and shoving his trunk against the foot of the free bed, closest to the door. He would have preferred the other if he had a choice, and he bet that if he asked him, the great fumbling Gryffindor would switch with him out of duty—not that he would ask— he wasn't planning on talking with Potter any more than absolutely necessary. When he glanced up, Harry's face had fallen, shoulders suddenly jerking to the side to fuss with something on his desk. Draco glanced at the top of Harry's dresser, which was already a mess, a scattering of personal effects and potions supplies. He frowned, thinking of his own potions kit in his bag, untouched and ready for the new year.
Draco is silent, his eyes burning.
Hermione frowned. "In a year we'll have to cook for ourselves, you might as well start learning now," she said. "Well, most of us, anyway."
There are several reasons for his five-petal flowers, and Harry knows them all.
"I should go look for him," Harry said, escaping through the portrait hole under the gaze of his peers. Hermione shook her head.
“Don’t," he says, but he can't bring himself to pull away.
"I believe I am," Draco stammered, thrown off guard.
Sorry it's been awhile guys! I've been working on a few other things, including another Harry/Draco piece called Skin Deep featuring Pansy and Luna!
"Stop being a git. This isn't about your father, this is about us."
and begins to root through his bag for something, even though he could really just summon it. Sure, Draco could tell him, but instead he lifts his wand from his belt into the air and mumbles
Harry confesses, Draco dreads, and Luna catches some fireflies.
Draco takes a shuddering breath and takes his wand from his pocket and casts an easy glamour. He may not be able to appear as someone else, but he can at least not appear to be himself. He walks up to the sleeping portrait and lets out a low yelp.
"I don't know what I want, I just don't want you to be hurt." Harry whispered.
"Are you taking potions again this year?" Draco asked, feigning nonchalance.
” Hermione sighs, and shakes her head. “I wish he would have told us. I saw the drawings, once or twice, but he always hid his arms.”
, and he offers apologies to Draco. After being stitched back together by trembling hands, waking under the vigil of his worst enemy, he wakes, and apologizes. He turns, legs shaking, and hears the sheets rustle behind him.
he thinks,
"They can't hear us Harry," Draco said, looking at him as if he was being an extra-special kind of idiot tonight. "Ya know,
"This is Dobby's sock, isn't it? The one that freed him."
It looks like there's a more mixed response than I thought, but the majority seem to prefer smaller updates more often, so I decided to hit up a compromise. Until I can get myself together this summer, I'll be posting smaller updates (I'm about to post the next bit before I go to bed, get ready to get Wrecked) and then I'll resume my normal, longer chapters less frequently.
Pansy winces at the nickname. Her fingers twitch and she tugs on her sweater again, eager to hide the messages that feel so much like a secret. A secret she wouldn’t have for much longer. She feels sick thinking about it. Being without her.
Draco feels his eyes beginning to sting, and he bites the inside of his cheek.
Luna's Moodboard
"You should stop,"
Harry’s stomach drops, and the moment seems to stretch as he processes the panic in Draco’s eyes- and yet.
It hurts a little, when he thinks of him. Thinking of his name, thinking of the things he always attached to it. Hatred. Narcissism. Weakness.But enemies don’t stay with you through sleep. Villains don’t save the life they’re trying to destroy.
I'll delete this later.
After a few minutes of pretending to read his textbook Harry sits up, his shoulder still pressed against Draco's, and eyes scanning his face.
in trouble?" Harry said in mock outrage. He smiled down at Draco, one hand braced on the door the office, and other still clutching Draco's.
"Allowances?"
"Draco!" Hermione replied. "They've summoned storm clouds over the tables!"
Progress.
If they weren’t both born of blood, raised in it.
Dumbledore, Harry would never forgive him. He might even kill him, if he has the chance.
"Will do."
"Draco, please, what is 'it'?"
"Just down the hall."
"Please."
Just as he turns the page and Nathaniel climbs into the captain's lap; there's a light thump on the table in front of him and when he looks up he sees the room has provided a large basket of treacle tarts and cranberry scones. When he takes one it's still warm, and the edges are crisp.
. Does he know?”
Draco was eight years old, sitting on the patio with his mother when the first of the drawings appeared. It was a warm day, and one of the house elves had brought them a pitcher of sweet tea, and with one hand on the cold glass he used the hand opposite to work up one of his sleeves, revealing little doodles on the inside of his forearm. His mother, busy with her spoon dipping into her sorbet, glanced up at the movement and dropped her spoon with a clatter. She sucked in a sharp breath.
Blood rose to Harry's cheeks as he stepped through the curtains, his eyes meeting those of the cross looking boy in the bed. "Hello," Harry said.
"Of course not," Harry replied.
"Are you okay?" Draco says carefully.
was he doing this again?
"Draco," said a voice. The boy at the sink turned, finding his father standing in the doorway. He stalked toward him, grabbing his wrist. "I come to see what's keeping you, and I find all of this garbage on your arms!" He shouted. Lucius pushed the boy's arm under the water, scrubbing at the marks on his arms.
"Pansy," Luna says, and her face breaks into a grin. Pansy just sees a swish of white-blond hair before the other girl is in her arms.
Draco rolls his eyes. "Well I'm tied up at the moment," Draco huffs. "You'll just have to get it yourself."
"I'm not sure that's the best thing for us..."
How could he take life? How
Draco snorted. "She's all yours, Potter."
Draco half-hoped he'd appear at the trials. Still, instead, his testimony was delivered in written form, with all of the Wizengamot members accepting the notion in a unanimous vote just before the first of the trials began. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't what he expected. Potter hadn't even sounded like he hated him, which Draco knew had to have been difficult, but he couldn't shake the air of irritation at the lack of his appearance, as if he was too good for it—as if he knew they would follow his advice blindly, and they did.
It was a long necklace, much like the one Draco had given him yesterday, but instead of the familiar Malfoy emblem Harry was so unfortunately accustomed to seeing, it was a new crest, bearing a cameo of a dragon and a phoenix circling one another. Between them, flowers bloomed from flames, the script below the scene reading 'Ne Cede Malis'. Harry assumed it must be Latin, though he had never taken it. He made a note to ask Hermione before they left for breakfast. He slipped the token into his robes, stretching and pulling off his pajama pants. Harry heard a sigh behind him and turned to see Ron lingering behind him.
"Please tell me you're not taking me to the headmaster's office."
"This boy is
There are still sharp stuttered sounds being choked into the mattress, and Harry’s fingers pull his shirt closer and closer. He flips over away from Draco, still holding on to his shirt, and pushes his other hand roughly into his own hair, twisting and pulling. There’s a still moment, and nothing but Harry’s heavy breaths pressed into the mattress. His fingers curl tighter into the material of Draco’s shirt, and pull once again. Draco huffs, and tries not to think about how terribly stretched this shirt is going to be; and how he was going to need to send out for more black t-shirts next time he wrote home.
) "I'm fine."
"Shh!" Hermione exclaimed.
?" Harry spat. "I can't understand because my family's dead?" He stood, dropping the box and slamming the door on his way out. Draco's face fell.
With bruises on his arms and scars on his back. Always broken, always bowed. His face to the ground, and hands
Reminder that this story does contain self-harm and some suicidal thoughts. Please be wary!
Draco’s hand shakes, but he reaches up and rolls up his sleeve to reveal his own bloodied arm, and under it, faintly, the stars he had drawn for Harry seemingly so long ago. “
Flora said, "Rosmerta's House-elves were gone. None of the equipment will work without their magic, so we could only eat what we didn’t need to cook. The store rooms wouldn’t stay cool, either, without the Elves about; all that meat and dairy turned rancid in a day. The kitchen was swarming with flies.”
“Lily’s a strong flier,” the raven-haired man said, no-nonsense. “No surprise, there. Only one person in your family with no interest in Quidditch, and you managed to Sort him into Slytherin.”
In typical Wizarding style, the room was a riot of pattern and warm color. The walls were decorated with several animated paintings, but none with human occupants. Small mercies.
“You’ve paid your debts,” Harry said. He was surprised by the steadiness of his voice. “If you owed the world anything, you’ve more than paid.”
“Is there evidence?”
“My, yes. My great-grandmother—Sacharissa Tugwood, surely you’ve heard of her? The world-famous potioneer? She was a close, personal friend of Albus Dumbledore in their youth. A genius in her own right.”
. Louis and I are both fairly diluted, as far as that goes. Scorpius even more so.”
, in ways they don’t even know their neighbors.”
Harry thought about it. He really did. But—
“Because Scorpius is important to Albus, and Draco is Scorpius’s father, so you’re going to have to see each other, now and again,” Hermione replied primly, raising her brows. “Besides which, you’re 39 years old and this all feels a bit juvenile, don’t you think?”
Professor,” Harry repeated. “What’s wrong with James?”
Hestia looked worried. “That word didn’t disappear for
“Parkinson could put any bloke off his meal.”
“Bloody hell,” Teddy murmured. Harry couldn’t help but agree.
James waged a very brief battle with himself, before he leaned down far enough to thump Harry on the back. It was almost a hug.
“James?”
“Professor?” Harry gasped. She frowned.
“What are looking at, Potter?” Someone shouts, from far too close.
“Oh, of course. It’s very well done, Mr. Potter.”
“Let’s just say: I could’ve used my own therapy appointment today.”
“Lily’s flying?” Harry said, before he could swallow the impulse.
“She may’ve been the one brave enough, or crazy enough, to say it aloud,” Millicent put in, abashed. “But she weren’t the only one thinking it.” Her wife, Flora, nodded along with a grim expression.
“He was getting into my trunk,” James admitted finally. He sounded far too weary for a boy of fifteen. “Some of the guys… they know I have potions on hand, for pain and sleep and so on.” Teddy sat back on his heels to give James space, and James dropped a fist into his lap.

“I hate school,” she said grimly.
“Obviously,” she scoffed, and threw her curtain of umber hair over one shoulder. “Though there isn’t much to say. Hermione asked, Millie and I are willing. I can’t say I’m looking forward to it.” Her eyes flitted beyond Harry, but the children were laughing and stealing bites off each other’s plates. Albus had his entire body curved around his dinner.

“I’m tired,” he repeated. She looked stricken.

of it, you know. We’re meant to laugh. Blaise told him he should curse her knitting needles to only knit giant wooly cocks.”
“D’you reckon you’re mad Draco’s changing, or that you’re not?”
“We all did. And anyway, Pomfrey says they can cure Sam pretty easily.”
“He knew when he agreed to go public with your relationship,” she muses, tucking her hair behind her ear. “He knew it was you, or nothing. I told him it was a mistake.”
“Might’ve been.”
“Why not?” Harry knew such things were possible; he’d learned more than he ever needed to know about magical childbirth, as the father of three Weasleys. “I thought it was just… you know,
The head floating in his hearth was 50% green flame and 50% scowl.
“Cease fire, Draco!” Teddy cut in. Though it wasn’t said sharply, Malfoy immediately closed his mouth and picked up his cellular. “You, too, Harry,” Teddy said, pointing a finger at him. “You can snip and snipe at one another as much as you like, once Sam’s back on his feet.”
“Blimey... Thanks, mate. That helps.”
He made his way to his seat, head down. When Harry sat, Teddy slid a cup of coffee into his line of sight without a word.
“Well,” Ron cleared his throat. “I’m here about Hermione, actually. About the book?”
“The receptionist. Simone Morris.” Spinnet began to pace in front of Harry’s desk, ignoring the grouping of armchairs entirely. “She’s got to go, sir. I’m sorry.”
In general, I want to avoid author's notes in this particular story. There are a few places I think they'll be necessary, and this is the first.
“Yes, well,” Malfoy deadpanned, “so were you.”
“Tell me who I need to Owl, Harry. Tell me who you need. Dean? Luna? Neville?”
A few minutes later, Luna arrived on the platform with her towering twins. Their father, Rolf, was overseas on a research trip. The boys greeted Harry and Lily politely before drifting off toward their fellow Ravenclaws. The Lovegood-Scamander twins drifted pretty much everywhere. The entire family seemed to arrive places mostly by accident.
Thanks also for the chocolate.

“Do I?” Teddy smiled at a weary witch dragging a crate full of school supplies and a very surly teenager. “Enjoy the school year!”
“Who?” Harry forced through the blurriness of potion-assisted sleep. “When?
Parkinson regarded him with careful composure. Then she took a deep breath through her small nose. “If it were me? Or Greg Goyle? Or
Malfoy stepped into an alcove to the left, out of the flow of corridor traffic. Harry followed, and cast a wordless-wandless privacy Charm. Malfoy’s eyes widened, but he didn’t comment. The window at the end of the alcove wasn’t sealed properly, and a chilly breeze made Harry shudder.
Harry frowned, feigning thoughtfulness. “You might lisp again.”
“Thank you.” McGonagall smiled, but only just. “Until then?”
“It’s… well, it’s
Hestia Pérez, who worked in accounts for the Ministry, trailed in shortly after. Flora looked relieved to see her sister. Millie ordered at the counter for them both.
“None of this has ever been easy,” he tells her, scrubbing a hand through his hair. “Do you know what Ginny said, when I told the Weasleys about Draco?”
“Sure?” Ted wondered, mismatched eyebrows up. “You just don’t trust ‘em.”
“Hello Lakshmi,” Harry greeted, stepping into her arms for a tight hug. She was a short-haired woman with brown skin and hip black spectacles. Lakshmi Patil was four years younger than Harry, but he often thought she’d not be out-of-place among the teenaged Auror recruits. She was calm and clever, with an easy smile. Lakshmi wore the uniform of the hospital wing (white apron over her clothes, white cap on her head) but she couldn’t look less like Poppy Pomfrey if she tried.
I hope this chapter brings you a bit of light in a very dark time. I'm posting some links at the end of the chapter to charities which assist some of the people most at risk right now: Black trans people in the United States. If you have a little money, you can make a donation. If you don't, that's okay. Your big, beautiful hearts are enough.
Harry closed his eyes. Sol let him. He didn’t always.
Lakshmi threw her hands up with a huff. “Circe’s saggy tits!”
“Am I correct in assuming,” Sol said carefully, “that Artemis Bulstrode is
He glares back, and waits. He can do that, too. He has plenty of his own Slytherin to spare.
, Mione.”
“No,” he sighed. “I’ll make an appointment. Like a bloody baby.”
Harry set his jaw. “Not particularly.”
Harry laughed. “Keep Pile. I’ll write back to him.”
Harry,
Harry’s stomach dropped.
There was a still second. A very hot rush of magic filled up Harry’s fingertips, his toes. The empty butterbeer bottles on the coffee table rattled ominously.

“Sod off,” Harry mumbled. “Don’t you have
frowning), but there was a glint of humor in his eye. “Perhaps you’d like to walk me over to Poppy’s office? I haven’t seen you since Scorpius left for school.”
“She is—erm, Felicity is very—”
“Graham’s all right. We’re all doing all right.” When Parkinson opened her mouth again, the larger woman grasped her fluttering fingers. “Breathe, Pans.”
Fiona Diamant was Ron’s second-in-command of the Game and Sports division, and a very capable witch. Every year, Ron told Harry that he ought to give Diamant the Broom-Race Finals, and every year he oversaw the damn thing himself.
Dumbledore sighed, “Never, Harry. I never saw myself at all.”
him.”
“...Why?” Hermione asked.
Harry started to feel silly, standing here alone while his family smiled with Slytherins. People watched Harry with sympathy in their eyes. Harry wanted to scream at them to
James’s freckled cheeks went pale, and he slouched further to one side. “Yeah?”
“Yes. That is why I can visit, at a moment’s notice.”
“Okay,” Ron said agreeably. “I don’t want to break bread with Harry and Parkinson—at the same time, together—on that day either.”
. You are the Head of the Auror Department. I don’t believe that’s meant to be a vanity appointment.”
Hermione mentioned you might want to meet up and get a drink or something? Seamus is knee-deep in that fraud investigation, but I’ve got time (if you don’t mind day drinking with an infant). Want to meet Emily and me at that pub near your place, the new one? Around three? Emmy has finally popped her first tooth through, so she’s fit to go out in public again. I thought the crying would never stop.
“‘S all right, mate. I’ll meet you in Gryffindor Tower, with Lily.” Harry’s eyes flickered toward Malfoy, who was (thankfully) looking away. “Take your time. Catch up.”
Talk soon! Hermione
“You may know it as the Sleeping Beauty Curse,” McGonagall said. Harry’s confusion cleared. “The most famous incarnation, though I’m sure that’s only a children’s story. It is a nasty sleeping Curse, placed on objects. Touch activated.”
Malfoy’s raspy voice was wry, self-deprecating. Inviting Harry to make a joke, even at his expense, but Harry didn’t find it at all funny. He rubbed his cold arms. It wasn’t that Malfoy looked like a Veela, or moved like one… but people’s heads turned his way, all the same. Harry’s always did—and that thought had him rocking uncomfortably on his heels.
British,” Spinnet mused.
,” Ron was still whinging. “We can’t even access the starting field until afternoon.”
. They’d be gleeful, in their way, to finally put paid to their doubts and their suspicion.
Malfoy, apparently, bothered. And that bothered Harry rather a lot.
“Oh, yes. I’ll line the garden path with pralines, and the hungry slugs should march right out the front gate.”
“Well, it’s just that you tend to express your opinion of Draco rather... forcefully.”
“God.”
“Less so than the average wizard,” Parkinson replied, pinning Ron with her stare. “He’s in the public eye. His wife was a professional athlete, and then a coach. All those endorsement deals! Head Auror, and heir to the Sleekeazy fortune. There are trade-offs for the kind of money and power the Potter family’s amassed.”
* * *
Lily and Molly were talking, but quietly. Molly did everything quietly. Her younger sister, Lucy, wasn’t with them—probably because she was a constant flight risk. They’d have found her on the roof of the Hogwarts express, or trying to abscond with a stranger’s toad.
with these little blighters, I wonder? I’ve had a word with the boys involved, and I’ll keep my eyes peeled for more problems.
“But… Harry, mate, he was
feel sad about that?”
“That so?” Pucey snorted, with a smile. And then, startlingly earnest, “Glad to have James back. Missed him, last Spring.”
Nobody should be shouting at Harry today, he decided. He felt strongly about that.
“I figure,” Millie mused, “you showed up here today to hear Pansy apologize.”
“Flora and Millie will arrive together, one assumes.” She pushed them out the front door, eyes on her notes. Ron took her elbow to steer her out of the path of a giant pram. “Hestia might be with them. Or do you think she’s coming from the Ministry? She might need a drink, or a bathroom break. Perhaps everyone should use the toilet before we begin.”
he was such a reckless idiot.”
“That’s exactly my point! History is being rewritten, twisted into some kind of fairy story. That shouldn’t happen. People should know precisely what Voldemort did, and to whom, and why.” She was animated now, vibrant in her fervor. “They should know what we sacrificed to stop him, so they can prepare themselves. So no one like him ever comes to power again.”
“He is my son,” Harry asserted. That was all there was to it.
Also: you can find some character and location inspiration photos on my Tumblr. Check it out if you're curious.
The smile must not have gone well, because Hermione looked worried. “Perhaps Ron should come back early,” she said.
“Godric’s saggy balls, Malfoy, I know that!” Harry gripped his fringe in one fist, then let go. Malfoy tracked the action with his eyes. “She’s my sister-in-law, you cynical tit. I know she’s clever. She was a Triwizard Champion!”
“Piss off, Malfoy!”
“Scorpius was born a year after I met Draco. An’ I was, like, eight years old.”
anything. Accidents happen, Harry!”
Harry said nothing, but leaned more heavily into the wall. Neville crossed his arms as he watched Pomfrey and Lakshmi nodding to each other, a small frown on his face. He looked tired.
“Do you think students can stay best friends, if they aren’t Sorted together?”
. The people you love. How, precisely, is he meant to ‘handle’ them, hmm?”
“Hi to you, too, mate.” Teddy dropped his bag with a
Harry had to draw one long, steadying breath. Malfoy’s voice—
Harry wondered.
. Harry can hardly say the damn word.
“I don’t want to be buttered,” Millie complained. Parkinson cracked a sharp smile. “Nor
“Hi, Mr. Potter,” she said, hopping onto a stool. “Scorpius. Dumbledork.”
“Oi!”
, aren’t I?”
, we don’t actually live in each other’s pockets.”
“But your father never took the Dark Mark?” Hermione wondered.
“How’s she feeling?” Harry asked, mostly to distract them both from their purpose.
The Floo
Once Teddy helped Harry to the bathroom, and then reluctantly shut himself behind the adjoining door of his own guest bedroom, Harry pulled out a cloak and a map.
“And she’ll mean it now?” Harry questioned.
Harry leaned his head back into the sofa, brain whirring against his will.
“Not all magical ingredients can be substituted. Not without reducing the efficacy of the potion. Unicorn horn is unique in its ability to neutralize and purify Curses. You should know that, seeing as it’s second-year potions theory—”
“I told her I knew where Hestia was hiding. I led her toward the Transfiguration corridor. I couldn’t be sure we’d find anyone who could help, but I knew Hestia was nowhere nearby. That no one I knew would be there, and so they’d be safe when things went pear-shaped.”
Harry knows the answer she’s looking for. It’s true, so damn
“Hermione thought to call for the Ginger Calvary,” Millie remarked, and used her wand to light the tip of the cigarette. “I interfered.”
“Limp as an imp.”
. That’s what Harry had hoped for. That was what his kids needed. What Harry needed, too, maybe.
“How can I still love him? How the
“Slander! Insubordination!”
“Biased, Pans?” Harry snarks by rote.
“Why did you come back here, then?”
“Hey, Percy,” Harry rasped.
“I’m glad you think so,” she said, squeezing his fingers. “Because you’ll be one of my first interviews.”
“I believe young Mr. Malfoy is not so much ‘mad’ as ‘unrestrained.’” Her quill scratched across parchment as she spoke. “And isn’t that a curious turnabout?”
There was a confused beat of silence on both sides of the loo door. Then Hermione said, “Well, that’s... lovely. Scorpius must be excited.”
Two cups of Darjeeling and a plate full of ginger nuts appeared on a small, round table. The table slid itself, abruptly, into the gap between Harry and Teddy’s chairs. James’s plate also refilled with biscuits, and his teacup started steaming again.
Harry gave a self-deprecating shrug. “Two months. She seems competent.”
Of course, he couldn’t. A Time Turner only allowed you to reverse five hours, and Harry never did figure out how Dumbledore walked the timeline back so many months. Hermione said, once, that time travel broke one of the Wizarding world’s most important laws. That it was dangerous. That it ruined lives. Harry needed, more than ever, to believe that was true.
His eyes were the same bright, open blue they’d always been. His wide mouth still smiled when he was thinking, or sleeping. Not everything had changed.
Sol pursed his thin lips. Harry drew a deep breath.
Harry’s bedroom door clicked open, and Teddy barreled into the room like a pajama-clad tornado. “Harry! It’s the Floo!”
“Oh, be fair, Harry,” she scoffed. “When it comes to Draco’s aptitude, you seem to require reminders.”
“Ta for the tea, dears,” she called as she hurried back to the front hall. “Tell Ron I want an update on the business with the cursed broomsticks. Sooner, rather than later.”
Parkinson smirked. “What I want to know is: when did Harry Potter, renowned skeptic of Slytherins, befriend Millicent bloody Bulstrode, and the Carrow get?”
The wizard, impossibly, reddened.
The statue’s mouth fell open, but nothing emerged. Nothing ever did, anymore.
. His ongoing Words with Friends battle—a four-way with Flint, Spinnet, and Ron for the highest possible score—had greatly increased Harry’s vocabulary. Technically, Dedalus Diggle played, too, but no one paid attention to Diggle’s scores. He was ancient, and a genius, and a terrible cheat.
“I met Millie and Flora through Dean,” Harry said, making the decision at the same time as he began to speak. “Dean took me to my first G.R.I.M. Alliance meetings.”
“Well, they were all sort of... sparkly. Pink. Some of them had those silly animated stamps George put out last year, just all over them.”
“Indeed,” McGonagall said with a glimmer of humor in her eye.
Hermione’s eyebrows went up. “Really?”
“…Nev?”
“D’you see the Grim in your teacup this morning?” Harry wondered. They pulled on their jackets as Hermione checked her hair once more in the hall mirror.
The Potters, plus the best of all possible Malfoys, waited in the back alley while Harry removed his Glamour. It left an itchy sensation under his chin every time. “Mr. Potter,” Scorpius said. “Do you think you can teach me to use a Glamour?”
"Yes you were - your voice is beautiful."
A thought strikes Draco just then, and he raises his wand, yelling, "Expecto Patronum!"
Mother calls me upstairs when the Parkinsons finally arrive. My wrists are sore from stirring my potion and getting swatted with the stirstick whenever I made a mistake. Pansy makes pleading eye contact with me and I know her day was just as bad as mine. We nod in greeting and scramble to my room as fast as possible while staying dignified enough that our parents won't notice.
comments always welcomed!!
"I still don't trust him," Theodore says, crossing his arms and scowling at the nasty hand sign Pansy throws at him. "His tail has no business being that long."
"We have to protect him."
Finally, nails scratching down my back when he straightens up again, my cock is freed. I come promptly. So much. So many times. Back to back.
I can't die here. I need to move.
"Hello," I say with my best attempt for my voice to remain calm. "Hogwarts too?" He replies with a simple yes. Perfect. "My father's next door buying my books and Mother's up the street looking at wands," I say coolly. See? I'm independent. Please love me. "Then I'm going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don't see why first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully Father into getting me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow." I won't, he'd beat me. Please don't see through me. "Have you got your own broom?" I try to sound disinterested(I'm very interested) in what his answer will be.
I'm alive, and this pain, this pleasure, is all proof of that. So maybe once I wake up, I'll make a move on Potter. Maybe he'll help me and Astoria to raise Scorp. Maybe he'll join our relationship. Maybe I'll live forever...
He lifts me as though I were weightless, laying me over his bed with a gentleness opposite to how he is ravaging my mouth. I'm on my back, hands groping feverishly and legs wrapped tightly around his hips. Come to think of it, his bed is level with his pelvis - he must bring men home fairly often.
They're out in the gardens together. She's planting flowers and Draco is running around on stubby toddler legs, trying to catch a peacock. Every day she takes him out here, reading to him and telling him stories about her family.
Similarly to Vince, Greg can't transform either. He's part giant, and hates Hagrid the most out of us. Why? Mainly because Hagrid is loved and accepted as a partbred, whereas it's a well kept secret among purebloods.
Warrington - a Slytherin prefect - herded us all back to the commons, Blaise Pansy and I running to my dorm. The dorms always looked worse than they were. According to legend, if any non-Slytherin entered our common room, it would feel miserably cold and stuffy. As if anyone in their right mind could get in here.
"Have you guys seen Harry or Ron?" She had asked us, voice quivering and cheeks tear stained. I almost felt bad for her.
Blaise clears his throat. "Can we get some water for her please?" He speaks softly, and one of the Malfoy Manors elves Apparates in with a pop and holding a tray, upon which sit a crystal pitcher and sparkling glasses. He bows to us as the pitcher fills itself.
"That's disturbing," he drawls out before turning to face him, and, fuck, Potter filled out amazingly.
Upon returning to school, I find myself having a much shorter fuse. I cursed Longbottom on my way out the library, I fought with the Weasel during the second Quidditch match, I followed the Trio to Hagrids hut, and, looking through the window, I am able to witness a dragon hatching, but I'm caught, and I sprint back to the castle to tell Snape. Maybe I can get rewarded for once.
Rather, I found myself studying him: his family, his friends, his mentors, his feats, etc, etc, etc. He came in frequently to drop off artifacts for my department. Soon my coworkers had started to clear the way when Potter called ahead, as they knew how badly I wanted to touch him. Even if it was just simply brushing his hand as he hands me a hot, bloody knife, freshly wrested from a newly dead Muggle (yes, that's happened). Anything to satiate my need, if only slightly.
"M-Malfoy?" He blinks hard in response, looking angry as ever. "I uh, I've never kissed a guy bef-"
"Can I add my fingers?" Draco bucks his hips and barks impatiently, so Harry slides his forefinger in beside Dracos own. Curling the digit down and leaning his weight on it, Draco nearly comes right there.
"No, Pansy. Where are your clothes? Also, why the hell are you transformed? Snape is gonna kill you."
"Draco, I think I love you too."
She draws back to gaze into my eyes again. Horrorstruck, I'm frozen in time, hardly registering the pain in my leg where I just got fucking stabbed.
"Right here," comes Harry's growling voice from immediately behind him. He then is engulfed in thick, muscular arms and an invisibility cloak is thrown over his head as Potter leans in to sniff at Dracos neck. Draco moans breathlessly, arching into Harry's chest when Potter's hands rub his front. Blood rushes straight down South, then Draco is being pulled through a door that hadn't been there a moment before.
"You will be quite the help to me, Draco. Veela hair is an exquisite ingredient in fire resistance potions, and I have been tasked with making a few for the Headmaster." He stands, tucking away a jar of bright gold under his arm, and releases his immobility spell he had placed on me.
"I'm gonna have some fun with you, yeah?" I whimper, nodding at a superhuman speed. She frowns, producing a ball gag from her jacket pocket and shoving it in my mouth unceremoniously. "Eager, are you? Haven't had one good as you in forever..." She trails off before stomping on my thigh. "Gotta savor this." Tightening her fistful of hair, she kicks me, hard, in the groin with what I now presume are steel toed boots as I groan.
"I am not scared, Theo. Now shut up before I stomp on your throat." This only elicits a high pitched chuckle from him. "Ok, I'll do it. But just know I hate you, all of you," he says, staring daggers at his fellow Slytherins.
When he takes me in his mouth I nearly lose it. I would've come straight down his throat, overwhelmed with pleasure, had he not thought far enough ahead to conjure a cock ring. He sucks me down to the base, my prick twitching as it hits his tonsils. After stretching me endlessly, edging and overwhelming me, he finally pulls back.
"You blithering cuck, I was moaning. I'm a Veela and you need more self control." He shoots a glare at the green eyes hidden beneath an ebony tangle of curls to punctuate his sentence, then, "Fuck me. In me, now."
"Parkinson, Malfoy. Pansy, Draco. Slytherin. Nice to meet you," he smiles nervously, scratching his ear. "I was just heading to the kitchen, you?"
