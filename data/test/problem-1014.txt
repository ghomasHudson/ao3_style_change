Suddenly leaning closer to Draco, snapping him out of his observing thoughts, Harry whispered something in his ear. 'Lucius,' he said. 'That's your middle name, and your father’s name too.’
‘Don’t be so harsh on them.’ Another man came into view. Hair like a bird’s nest, dressed in the most awful robes one could wear in the French Pyrenees. ‘He’s only a first year and you’re training him as if he’s Krum competing for the World Championship.’
how Draco reached his soul, could feel how he slowly started losing control over his own body, his own mind. "The one that stares too long might not like what follows," Draco then cited, before dropping the gaze.
Wrapped up in thick coats, Harry and Draco were making their way through the snow side by side. The Lake was slowly starting to freeze and they both stopped to watch the snowflakes fall and melt away on the remaining watery surface. 'Soon, I guess,' Harry answered him. Of course he wanted to tell his friends about them; he didn't want to keep it a secret. But on the other hand he was afraid that people would laugh at him or at Draco; he had seen it happen to Dean and Seamus before. No matter what, some people just would forever remain small-minded.
There was no sun as Draco woke up but there certainly was rain; falling from the sky as if it hadn't rained in years. Tying his hair up in a bun and rolling up his pajama sleeves, Draco attacked his wardrobe in search of his water-repellent hat. It may sound
about your task before acting,' he explained. Draco nodded his head, another tear rolling off his cheek but getting wiped away by the back of his hand. His other hand was placed on his stomach, slowly tracing one of the scars. 'Look, you are just as beautiful with those scars as without them,' Harry assured him, his eyes not leaving Draco's once. 'You will always remain to be as gorgeous as the butterfly you want to be.'
One last look into the boy's green eyes and Draco turned to leave him behind — but Harry pulled him back, wanting to press one last kiss against Draco's lips. It was already way too late and who knew who was still hanging around in the hallways. It wasn't as if he didn't want to be seen with Harry, but privacy had always been high on Draco's list. 'Meet me tomorrow by the lake,' he whispered to Harry after finally being released by the boy. 'And bring you invisibility cloak.'
Yet, as that exact curse was about the leave her lips, another flash of red hit her from the back. She fell to the ground like a piece of stone, flat on her face with her black curls following behind. From the back of the room came Draco sauntering, taking his time while eyeing Bellatrix from the floor. Harry was confused to see Draco didn't seem to have a wand, and appeared to have casted the spell with his bare hands. Draco's parents looked at him in shock, in disbelief of what their son had done to a witch that was on their side. 'Draco—' his mother began, but her son hushed her by holding a finger to his lips.
, sugars in his tea and stirring the liquid with great force. "But yes, I do have to tell you something…”
It sounded like she accused him of planning to murder the poor boy. 'It isn't really normal for a student from a rivaling school to be so friendly with another Champion, is it?'
Harry grinned, knowing that the French twins were probably just as cunning as the Weasley twins he knew all too well. Maybe they should meet one day. 'So they know that you're here?'
Hermione went silent at his words and uncrossed her arms. She leaned a little closer to him but remained far enough to not invade his personal space. 'He told me about the clue he got from the Golden Egg and… I kind of figured out he must have gotten it from you. Am I right?' Draco nodded at her words. There was no need to deny it; she would find out eventually anyway. 'So, what do you reckon we do now?'
His gaze then landed on the boy's wound again, which definitely looked a whole lot better than before. "Are you healed now?"
Not wanting the waste any more time, Draco took off the beret he had been wearing all day and tossed it somewhere next to his clothes. Untying his bun of silver hair, he kept his eyes locked in those of Harry. He could see the white reflect in the boy's round spectacles when his hair fell down on and over his shoulders. Harry's eyes grew large again at the sight of Draco's long locks and Draco had to suppress his cheeks from blushing. It was true that he had never shown his hair to anyone else beside from the twins and the girls; he just didn't like everyone to know about it. Of course, if you looked at him closely, you could see that underneath one of his hats his hair wasn't short but going upward in a tied-up way. But nobody who didn't know had ever mentioned it, which had led to him never having to explain or show it unwillingly before. The rare occasions that Draco wore his hair down were during the night, during bathing and on lazy days at home.
He glanced at Draco whom was smiling brightly, holding his hat with one hand to stop it from getting blown off. 'Only
Draco thought as he hurried himself over to a girl whom seemed to be losing to an Acromantula. A single powerful curse was enough to silent the creature for good, and the first-year gave Draco a thankful look.
, he had been at first but his determination to win had been stronger; a determination he hadn't felt before. He had kept himself to surviving only, to what Draco had wished he would do. But as he ran through the maze, turned corners and felt the magic and tension of the Tournament surround him, he had felt as if winning was only enough.
But he had no time to go and ask her wether she had seen Draco or not; Crouch had put his wand against his throat and announced that it was time for the second task to begin. 'An hour the Champions will have to retrieve an item that has been stolen from them.' Harry's heart skipped a beat at his words. What was it that they had stolen from him? His invisibility cloak? His broom? He had no idea. 'If they fail to do so; they won't be granted with any points, which will be a disadvantage in the third and final task.'
Draco agreed with him. 'I believe so. Well, at least she's not here to mess around with Beauxbatons' education, is she?'
Potter sighs to that and looks down at his hands. ‘That… changed. We visited Azkaban after visiting you last week and found out Dolohov had died that morning.’
'Then let's apparate to the square,' Harry concluded. 'We'll walk to the Manor from there; I'm sure we'll be able to find it.'
. As if he hadn't lived before. Harry didn't say another word to him nor did Draco; they both somehow knew that it was alright and that they were both enjoying it greatly.
As he left his room, fully dressed and ready to chaperon the girls to their dates, all their mouths fell open in awe.
' he asked, scowled almost while throwing his hands in the air — too dramatically, he knew. 'We don't have any time to lose.'
I do. And you should do so as well,' Draco told her. With those words said he rose from his seat. 'I'm going to study at the library.
Sighing once again, Harry tried to focus his mind on Quidditch instead of Draco — but the worries stayed. There was simply no way he could cast his love for the boy away; stop caring about him. If he could he would even give up his position as the Gryffindor's Quidditch captain any day if it would keep Draco safe from his father, mother and Voldemort. Against his will, and with Draco still floating around in his head, he started chatting about Quidditch with Ron now finally joining the conversation as well.
'No, I won't leave you alone,' Harry protested, but Draco's looks commanded him to go — and so he went.
They had left a new object behind in the cabinet; for whatever reason that had to be done. Draco still wasn't really sure what it did, but suspected it of maybe vanishing things. 'He had been surprised when the bird had still been there; it has happened many times before so I know he was. Over and over -- he's disappointed to find it again,' he explained to Harry in whispers. They were back in the dormitory, laying close to each other in Harry's bed and with the curtains drawn close. It had been a while since Draco had slept in the same bed as Harry; he had been too occupied with sneaking out of the dormitory at night or simply didn't feel like searching for affection. But now; now he just wanted to be close to him again.
Bolting off her chair immediately, Hermione snatched the locket from Harry's hand. 'You did it!' she called out in a cheerful way, followed by a sigh of relief.
He hadn't even stepped through the portrait hole or someone already pulled him into the crowd by his wrist. It appeared to be one of the boys he had '
he wants to shout, but he swallows those worlds and acts like he didn't see the transformation of the once so pale arm.
And it wasn't as if Draco needed anything else from what he had in his room; his wand, books, food and water that one of the house-elves frequently brought up. Until the first of September was nearing -- only one single day away.
Everything Draco had even known or learnt, the blond could feel seep away out of his head, through his ears and onto the dance floor. The only thought and knowledge that remained was that of Harry. If Harry would've asked him to go for a dive into the Black Lake that moment; Draco would have said
But Draco's day wasn't over yet. As he entered the carriage, he immediately noticed something was off. There were no girls lounging on the sofas and the fireplace was extinguished. Only a long, slender figure was seated upon her usual purple sofa, her hands folded together. 'Draco,' she said. Her expression was blank but Draco could read the fury in her eyes; she was mad about something. She was mad at
as he stared at a cloud of foam that had appeared on the water's surface. 'I’m about to show you something I have never shown any other boy before. Beside from the twins, that is.’
Draco thought he had assured Harry's worries but realized that he probably had confused the boy even more. ‘H-how do you mean-,' he started, eyes still focused in Draco's. They expressed
other magic to interfere with the locket. I have chosen him for this task, and that's that,' Voldemort continued, and thereby finished another topic all together. 'Now, let's discuss something that truly matters...
Looking to his left in slight surprise, he fixed his posture and turned himself towards Harry fully. 'You still have the trace on you as you're underaged for a few more days,' he explained, not willing to waste any time as he took out a flask with a damping liquid inside. 'Our plan is the following; we'll go in pairs and one of each will drink a Polyjuice potion to become the exact resemblance of you, Harry. This way they won't know whom is the real Harry and whom is the fake.'
she even care? It wasn't as if her worries would make them disappear or heal all of a sudden, would they? He sighed deeply and took Harry's hand in his again, eyes drifting off towards the boy's lightning bolt shaped scar. Memories of a large bathtub where they once had discussed their scars. Draco had gained quite a few since then.
Draco sighed. He himself had no idea at all nor did he know exactly how a vanishing cabinet worked. 'All I know is that a vanishing cabinet vanishes things; wether it disappears forever or shows up somewhere else — I'm not quite sure.'
idea. The most stupid one they had ever had. What if he would see Harry anyway? What if he would find out Draco had brought another person along with him? And it wasn't just some other person —
The ceiling and floor are both painted black, as well as the four poster bed draped with heavy curtains. In the middle of the room, a little away from the bed, a small table stands with two chairs beside it. They both look extremely uncomfortable despite their green cushioning, and Harry can’t imagine Malfoy ever sitting in one of them unless it’s utterly necessary. A wooden desk is placed against a window to their right, the top nearly invisible underneath piles of heavy old books. A few brooms, probably latest edition, are lined up on the opposite wall, reminding Harry of the Gryffindor versus Slytherin matches back at school.
That night Draco dreamt that he was seventeen, a rightful candidate himself to participate in the Triwizard Tournament. Standing in the middle of the Great Hall surrounded by Hogwarts students with red scarfs and green eyes, he eagerly waited for the Golbet of Fire to announce its first candidate. The blue flames roared, spitting out a piece of parchment shaped in that of a butterfly. Madame Maxime appeared out of nowhere and caught the parchment insect before it could drift off towards the floor. She cleared her throat, a smile already appearing on her face. '
badges with great pleasure. Harry didn't seem to mind them any longer, just clenched his jaw and kept his eyes straight ahead. He made a turn to the left and Draco noticed they were on their way to the front gates of Hogwarts, which meant they were leaving Hogwarts all together.
. It is then the Guardian's task to guide the Mortal to heaven, before being assigned a new one to guard."
Harry swallowed and looked away for a second before returning his eyes, giving Draco a bit of a tormented look. 'Are you perhaps in love with him?'
'It belongs to the Black family,' she explained. 'And therefore now to Sirius. It's the perfect Headquarters for the Order, really; the ancient protection spells that are cast upon it keep both Muggles and Wizards away from it. Add Dumbledore's spells to that melange and you won't be able to find a safer house in all of England.'
'Well… I haven't been completely honest with you about our visit to Malfoy Manor last week,' Harry says, taking a deep breath. 'He cast a concealment charm on his arm but it didn't work for me, so I saw something different than your eyes.'
Harry's smile widened because of that and as he opened his mouth to say something else, Draco felt a hand being placed on his shoulder. As he looked to his left, he stared straight into the enchanting eyes of Fleur. 'Who are you talking to, Draco?' she asked him in French.
When he thought the dragon would never land again, it suddenly leapt down, a large lake appearing from underneath the clouds. 'We have to jump!' he heard Hermione shout. He caught a glimpse of her finger pointing at the lake beneath them, only a few more feet away. Draco sighed deeply.
‘I-I see.’ Was it such a problem that Draco had his own pair of best friends as well? Why else would Harry act so weird and awkward all of the sudden? Perhaps he wasn't used to standing half-naked next to another boy.
‘I do know the exact reason… but it’s hard to talk about.’ Draco slid his fingers across his scar and then looked at Harry’s forehead, eyes searching for
The faint lines of wrinkles appeared around Harry's eyes again; as sign of a truly genuine smile. A smile which Draco thought of as his favorite. It made his heart melt, beat faster and react to every little detail he caught in Harry's green eyes. The twinkle, the deep stare into his own grey ones.
Curses had been fired. He had protected the ones he knew as much as he could. Victims had fallen — young wizards and witches giving their lives for one single boy. It had made tears well up in his eyes, but it had also made a fire burn brighter in his heart. He had used his wand in a way he had never used before — casting spells he had never tried before. One Death Eater after the other fell to their knees in front of him, were thrown into the air or were blasted through windows — glass shattering in front of his eyes into a million pieces.
Harry glanced at Draco before nodding his head. 'If that's — if that's alright with you, Madame. My friends are also here,' he replied, shuffling his feet a little and straightening his robes even though it was a hopeless cause.
Harry could clearly see on their faces they weren't too pleased with the move, and that they found it his fault they had to move in the first place. 'It's for your own safety,' he explained, and it felt like he had already said that same sentence a million times the last few days.
She shook her head, laughing at him a little. “Please, it’ll be a great start to my tenure. And then I can give you updates while you’re gone. Assuming you still plan to go?”
Malfoy let out a small huff and almost looked at him, then stared at their feet. “You are not what I would consider an academic, no.”
Harry did nothing with the information. Not at first. Not intentionally. The Daily Prophet was mostly to blame. The elder Malfoys, their house arrest complete, had held a coming out ball for themselves to mark their return to polite society, and the coverage had made the front page. Harry knew this because Hermione had extensively mentioned to him over lunch how the news had brought up all of Ron’s old feelings and they’d rowed again about her working at the Ministry. Harry had stared at the paper and wondered if the youngest Malfoy had attended. Whether there were photos. Hermione had left their lunch early when she caught sight of someone who’d been avoiding her meeting requests, and she forgot the paper in her rush. So Harry took it with him. He had to put the paper in the bin, of course, where it belonged. And if it meant he could also confirm that the answer to both his questions was yes, well, it was because the front page hadn’t talked about anything else.
A Ministry package arrived the next day. Draco sent it back with the requisite form for non-acceptance. The Ministry of Magic did not seem to care whether Harry Potter wanted their packages. Each day, they sent another, and each day, Draco returned it. The smog came back to the city. The days blurred once again.
Once they found space at the nearest stretch of the bar and ordered their drinks, Harry said: "I was surprised you came along to this. You never come out with the group to the pub back home."
Malfoy’s lips pursed, a hmm barely audible as he curved further into Harry’s space. “I can see the, um, appeal.”
She scanned his face, searching for something. He couldn’t tell if she found it, but she said, “That would be lovely. The perk of being a somewhat important person myself is I don’t have to run the bake sale anymore, I just organise it. Get me whenever you’re ready?” Giving him a tight, lingering hug, she headed past him.
It took several minutes to spot the house. A hundred feet further out, wood as pale as the sand stuck out from the ground to support the remaining tiles of a sagging roof. Space separated each slat like the gaps of a ribcage. There were no doors or windows, just empty frames that opened into a shadowed interior.
“Eh, loosely. We’re not really on speaking terms. And he seemed alright the first few times we spoke, but then he reverted back to the same old arsehole, so, who knows.”
“You don’t have to tell me,” Harry said, letting one of his hands slide slowly up through the curling, wet strands of Malfoy’s hair. It rested along the curve of his neck, grazing first over the collection of birthmarks he adored. Malfoy’s eyes fluttered closed, his head giving the slightest turn into the hand still resting against his cheek. His expression remained pained. Malfoy opened his mouth, trying to speak, until Harry’s fingertips slid over to silence him.
“Twenty-nine.” He rubbed his eyes. He always remembered the people that had stayed once he arrived, in those early years. "We were down to eight last year. It’s not impossible for five of those people to be dating someone a year later. Even if one of them is Michael Corner.” They cringed simultaneously. “Six! Shouldn’t I include you as well? Or are you still in the shagging phase?"
. Harry Potter himself was giving him a hug. It was even quite tight, as if he had never given anyone a hug before and just didn't know how to
Potter sighs and slumps in his chair a little. ‘I didn’t read that, I must admit. But maybe there’s another spell or another way... there must at least be something in the damned book that’ll help you.’
Harry was silent and seemed to think about Draco’s words; probably picturing the accident in his head as well. A small smile appeared on his face as he looked at Draco again. ‘It’s a beautiful scar, though,’ he told the blond.
"They can't see you, can they?" he then asked the boy as he slid down the ladder to the attic. He only shook his head, still too exhausted to answer with words.
There was an angel in the Dursleys their house. Upstairs. On the attic. In Harry's room. His name was Draconis— no,
Harry wasn't sure wether Hermione's charm would hold up, but he had to have faith in his best friend's skills. He didn't know what he looked like, but it apparently worked well enough as the Snatchers didn't recognize him as Harry Potter anymore — or at least, not
McGonagall basically pushed them towards a spot on the dance-floor where they stood frozen opposite each other. 'Well,' Draco then said. He wrapped his left arm around Harry's waist and pulled him closer to his chest. He could feel the rapid pace of Harry's heart as he had never been so close to the blond before. 'I guess I will lead?' His right hand intertwined with Harry's left as the music started and Draco guided him over the dance-floor.
He could only have hoped that Ron would've been smart enough to give the note to Harry or somehow obtain the gillyweed himself. But all his thoughts had faded away as the professors casted the special sleeping charm upon him right at the moment he entered the office again.
'I indeed haven't,' his mother admitted. 'I wish I could; I wish we lived in a time of peace where there was no right and no wrong. Where we were a normal, happy family that weren't pressured to obey a man after making one single mistake. Shouldn't we deserve a second chance, Draco? Shouldn't we deserve a way to make up for that mistake?'
Orange light from the sun slowly fading away, exchanging itself for the colder gleams of the moon. Evening had arrived and therefore the right time to apparate away to the town of Wiltshire. Remaining on his bed for a few seconds longer, Harry stared at the photograph of Draco he had gotten from Fleur. The blond laughed out loud again, his smile as bright as Harry remembered it to be. He looked genuinely happy, and Harry wondered wether he would see Draco ever that happy again — if the boy was still alive, of course. Harry's stomach turned around at the thought. He had tried to keep it from his head, but the worry of having killed the boy filled his insides with guilt and nausea.
things that are wonderful about being an angel — and I am sure I shall tell you more about that as time goes by."
Harry sighed as well as he turned himself around again, staring at the single star and his last name upon his back. He glanced back at Draco, still trying to get a decent opinion but the boy seemed lost in his thoughts. ‘Come on, Draco. Please tell me how I look, will you? You’re the fashion king after all.’
Hermione placed Bellatrix' wand on the counter; the one Draco had stolen from her only a week ago. His memory couldn't recall the exact moment, but Harry had told him he had taken it away from her without using a wand himself. The wood was black and bent, the sound it made against the marble heavy and muted. No, there wasn't a single memory in Draco's had in which the dark item had made its appearance. The goblin picked it up, slid a finger over the material while examining it with curious eyes. But something was wrong; Draco could see it in his eyes. the boy had always been quite good at noticing when something was going on — and right now it most definitely was the case. A single glance at Hermione was enough to let her know about his doubts. Next he peered at a piece of paper on the counter, then looked over his shoulder at a goblin in the back. 'They know,' Draco whispered, but he didn't wait for the others to react. Pulling his wand from his sleeve, he secretly pointed it at the goblin and whispered
As more walls of green had followed, so did creatures that he feared and tested him. He had beat them all in their own game of spells and quizzes, had kept on running and running. Running so fast that after a while he hadn't even looked at his feet anymore, which eventually had caused him to trip over something. That something had been Fleur getting strangled by the evil roots of the hedges, slowly taking her away into their green. Her body had been as stiff as if someone had casted a stunning spell upon her, but there had been no-one in sight to hold responsible. He knew he had to help her as she was Draco's friend and if he wouldn't; Draco would never forgive him. Without hesitation Harry had cast the red emergency sparks to the sky, watched them explode above the maze like firework.
' ran into Skeeter's photographer. The magical camera hit the ground with a thud and a bit of smoke rose from it. Dumbledore held up his hands as if to surrender and gave Draco a wink, one that confused the blond a lot. Had he just done that on purpose?
They sit down on the uncomfortable chairs again and Draco makes a new tea tray appear with a flick of his wand. No rose this time and Draco's china tea cup has been replaced by the one Potter so kindly made for him. It makes his cheeks turn pink a little; maybe he should've just tucked it away somewhere, acting like he never got it.
Practicing the Bubble-Head charm became something Draco wanted to avoid rather than look forward to. Prior weeks he hadn't been able to wait until lunch was over to go spend some time with Harry by the Lake, help him with his task and talk about many other things afterwards. He had told the boy stories about Beauxbatons, his parents, his personal life. It had all been so natural and comfortable to talk to Harry about everything; and Harry had felt the same way. At least, Draco had thought he did.
Draco thought as he observed the boy's face. He was walking the boy back to the Gryffindor common room, allowing him the rest the nurse had demanded him to take. A simple spell had fixed his glasses again, his green eyes shining brightly behind them. Harry still limped with every step he took but he didn't need Draco's support anymore, holding his hand seemed to be enough. It wasn't as if Draco had been
Draco nods. It was the first thing he did after receiving it from Potter’s barn owl. ‘It’s really interesting, and also has a lot of curses, spells and potions described that could’ve caused my condition.’
. I know,' Draco whispered back. He hadn't forgotten about the look of hunger when he had shown Harry his long hair before.
'He's a smart elf indeed, and the most loyal one I've ever met,' Harry said, looking at Dobby with loving eyes.
'You still have years to think about it, Harry. I'm sure you'll figure it out when the time's there. And whatever it will be, I'm sure you'll be
Harry never liked visiting the prison, but it seemed an inevitable thing when performing the function of an Auror. Prisoners had to be brought in, interrogated or transferred to the Minisitry — and today they had to be visited.
He felt his muscles relax after a long day of paperwork and breaking his head over the Death Eater-mystery. Not that he had come very far with his plans other than to break into the special cursed corpse department and try to steal Dolohov's body… which
'Nightmares? Seriously, Draco — is that all you're able to come up with? Tell me the truth!' A shake of Draco's head followed as he tried to free himself from Harry's grip. Should he shout? Should he act like he was in severe danger? Perhaps someone would hear him even though they were so far away from any other student. Could his voice carry itself over the grounds all the way to the castle? 'I'm your boyfriend, Draco; you're supposed to trust me.'
" A chubby, tall boy from the same age as Harry slammed the door now shut again, a smirk on his face. "Did I hurt you, Potty?" The mocking voice went on, now followed by a little laugh.
it. It was a disgrace to his pearl complexion, yet somehow he couldn’t tell Harry that. Somehow it felt as if Harry truly thought his scar was beautiful. ‘Well
“Let’s say I pursued him into forgetting today’s events — and perhaps a slice of his hate for you. Although, his soul is quite rotten, so I believe it won’t last any longer than a few days," he calmly explained.
During all those years of the curse spreading further and further, he has never been able to tell Mother about it. He's just afraid to see the look of horror on her face; the dark memories of their past flashing in front of her eyes.
' she mumbled as she rose from her sofa. As she walked towards the portrait of her room, she threw the smallest of smiles in Draco's direction before disappearing, leaving Draco with a warm feeling in his chest.
'I thought you didn't want to do that anymore?' Harry replied. Draco had indeed declined his offer many,
Draco gave Harry a side glance and then looked back at the exceptional duo in front of them. 'I could tell,' he lied. He hadn't seen Hagrid dance at all. 'Must be
in return and felt himself get dragged into a void as if he had used a Portkey against Snape instead of a wand.
The man by then had taken the color of the healer's robes, his eyes looking anywhere but the deformed body of Dolohov. 'Kingsley had hoped you'd figured this curse out by now. He isn't very keen on the fact that the Ministry's hiding a near-Dementor beneath the floors of St. Mungo's. Imagine what would happen it became public,' the Unspeakable said.
Hope you like this chapter! I decided to leave the Umbridge part and whatnot away but I promise she will make another, different, appearance in the next chapter *hint*.
“Don’t you ever get bored then?” he couldn't help but ask, for he knew he'd become terribly bored must he'd been in Draco's place.
With those words out, Draco stormed off towards the carriage, leaving Harry behind. He could hear the boy following him but he ignored it, quickened his pace instead. Harry shouted his name a few times in an apologizing fashion but Draco waved them away; he didn't feel like talking to the boy anymore. He was just rambling nonsense and it irritated him greatly.
Harry sighed. 'He won't let me.' Already earlier that morning he had tried to take it off, and even during the night he had tried — but it almost seemed as if the locket could sense whenever Harry was going to try and take it away. Draco always protected the locket immediately or took a step back even before he
'How can't I be afraid?' Draco then said, interrupting the man's words. 'I'm terrified and I don't — I don't want to kill you!' Bolting up from his chair, he looked into the headmaster's eyes; staying calm and looking at Draco with a certain pity.
The raven-haired boy leaned closer to Draco, placed a hand upon his knee. 'Don't worry, it won't possess you again. As long as you don't wear it around your neck, that is,' he explained, assured him in some way. Draco nodded, still unsure, and took the necklace from Harry with a fast heartbeat.
How would a Malfoy heir open his family's vault? How would his family have sealed it off? It had to be something easy so any family member could open it — yet difficult enough to keep others away. Thinking of a few easy spells with a difficult casting, Draco soon realized none worked to unlock a door. The French closed his eyes, let his brain work three times faster for a few seconds to try and find something within his mind — perhaps search through the picture-book of the memories of his five-year-old self. Yet he didn't have to go so far, but found an option he could try while thinking of his family. An option of which he was suddenly certain would be the right one.
That little smirk again. "Angels don't need sleep, Harry. And don't worry about me, I've done this every night since the day you were brought here."
. Harry spotted them at the bottom of a pile to his right. ‘Come on!’ he shouted, pulling Draco along by his thin wrist. They escaped the fire just in time as they snatched the first broom they saw, swung their legs over the wood and flew off towards the ceiling — the only place safe from the sea of orange.
Harry Apparated back into a dark hotel room. In front of him, the bed remained undivided, the sheets made up from room service. When he looked down the small hallway, he saw Malfoy’s shoes near the door. That answered that: he’d made it back at some point. Harry took a step toward the shoes and made out the closed bathroom door. He could just discern the shower running over the hum of the air conditioner. Again, the space beneath the door was dark. Like the day before. And the day before that.
She burrowed deeper into the couch cushions and let her head rest fully against the back of the couch. “They offered me a transfer to the DMLE. With the Head of the Department.” She took another noisy sip through her straw.
The walk to his desk was a long one. That Malfoy wouldn’t take his job back, it didn’t... He hadn’t considered—Harry paused in the aisle leading to his desk.
A little groggy, Harry stood up, then veered toward his suitcase. He’d change into his pyjama bottoms first. That done, the shower kept running. Harry turned to his clothes. Now was as good a time as any to get ahead on his packing. He waved the light on beside the bed, to the lowest setting, and folded up his things.
Thank you so much for reading. I've never made a piece this long before (it was scary), and I dove so deeply into this Harry and Draco for this story, and the world even before this part of their journey. It's bittersweet to reach the end, but it means so much to be a part of, and contribute to this fandom. Readers make it worthwhile, and I truly hope you enjoyed it!
“Mother of Merlin, Malfoy,” Harry said, rounding his other hand around the pulsing of blood at his wrist. He squeezed his eyes shut and tried to breathe around the flush of pain. “What the hell are you doing in there?”
Draco turned. Before he finished, Harry pressed along his back, his head settling on Draco’s shoulder. His arms wrapped close around Draco’s torso. He could make out the darks of their outline in the far mirror, but no details. He let them stand there for a few moments first, the lavender coming back to him. Pressing his mouth to the unsteady beat in Draco’s throat, Harry flicked his wrist and lit the several wood wicked candles throughout the room. They sparked, instantly making their faces and bodies clearer in the mirror, but they kept a shadowy quality to the room overall.
Draco couldn’t stop himself. He cried out from the pain of the tendril’s pull. It would dislocate his shoulder soon.
Harry made it to the Ministry early again the next morning. For maybe the first time, he’d beaten Malfoy there as well. The chair was empty, once he looked.
After a few hours, Ron let his files lie flat against his chest and stretched out on the length of the couch. “You’re telling me the Ferret himself put all this stuff together?”
“I do have evidence, actually, other than what Auror Malfoy gave me.” Harry gave a smile that slashed like a grimace. “But I apologise—it’s going to refute all those nice things you’ve just said about me.”
That left his inbox. It loomed from the left corner of his desk, overflowing into a series of several piles. So much for not having work the next few weeks. He pulled out the three silver-lined and oversized envelopes that stood out from the rest.
Forcing himself to focus, Draco tried to suss out Potter amongst the fray. His magic was everywhere, filling the valley that the compound occupied. But its strongest point came from the main house.
“Now we shuffle over here,” he began, sliding a cautious foot behind them and pulling Draco along. He stopped at the press of the tub’s farthest edge against his calves. Draco kept coming forward until their bodies aligned from chest to knees.
“It’s very inauspicious timing on his part. I got a report with the accusations over the weekend. I imagine he caught word that they were on to him and fled.”
The tendril pulled him onto the porch. Draco again saw the hanging ropes of gleaming peppers, the cotton and twine. The tendrils seemed to extend from those in particular. It was a focus. Potter was using them to focus.
“Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you. For the tip.” Harry felt compelled to say something: Malfoy had seemed to forget about him entirely.
The next time Harry tried to thank Malfoy, he thought he might have made some progress when the man actually looked him in the eye for a length of time. Except then Malfoy had said, “Believe it or not, Auror Potter, my ability to do my job isn’t predicated on your validation, but so glad to know that the Saviour approves,” and Harry went home that night to underline Malfoy’s name on The List several times and add variations of 'total tosser,' '100% prat,' and 'perma arsehole NEVER FORGET' in parentheses. Malfoy’s tips continued to be helpful after that, but Harry did not address him again and buried deep any memory of the heat that had run through him to face that burning gaze once again.
With the conference over, he had less than a day left in the States. The idea cheered him. After that, it was only a few days more in London waiting for the credits to come through. Then he could head to Spain. Maybe he’d just have his things sent over, after it was all official. For a new start. A new home. He could leave even earlier then.
Cold shot through him. “It’s Jenkins and Flemings, isn’t it?” At Robards’s silence, Harry’s hands curled into fists. “And Malfoy, have you spoken to him about this?”
He pulled the package from his bag and whispered the words to fix the seam. The texture roughened where the magic sealed it, but only a close review would reveal that. He didn’t worry. Potter’d never struck him as the detailed type.
Harry’s eyes flickered to Draco’s before he tugged on the soft fabric, nudging Draco slightly closer. Slowly, so slowly, Harry bent forward, his lips brushing first the left corner of Draco’s mouth, then the right, before pressing fully and firmly against him.
a ‘dirty martini,’ it was not fun to drink it. Also, he shouldn’t eat so many of those crab legs from the seafood platter, it would make him ill, and Merlin, what was wrong with him today?
“I will miss living so close by. And with you of course.” Hermione handed him some napkins. “But Ron’s happier. And it’s nice actually being home in time for dinner. A person could get used to it. Even if it means files sitting on my desk at the end of the day. That’s… fine.” Harry wasn’t the only one adjusting.
“Good night, Harry,” she said, waving behind her. He watched the door close. Brilliant. His friends were devious, but brilliant.
Draco felt it, then, past the silence and the dull throb in his forearm: the beckoning call of dark magic. It flicked at the edges of the circle on the floor, as rhythmic as flames.
“Well, if we get everything confirmed, I’ll have you both in on the raid. I could use the extra help when the time comes, anyway.”
Draco shook his head, but the faux-dour expression fell away when he pulled it free of the box by its handles. The briefcase was large and leather, but a soft kind, flexible—nothing like the hard-covered, boxy ones he saw the blokes in The City of London using. The accents were gold, but the leather itself shone a soft robin’s egg blue. The brand name appeared discreetly on the gold clasp that held the front pocket closed. His fingers caught on the leather tag hanging off the handle nearest the zipper. And there it was:
Pansy picked up the package and gave it a shake. “Please tell me you got him something outrageous, like personalized bed sheets that say ‘The Next Mr. Malfoy.’”
Harry grimaced. “I mean, we spoke, after that game I went to with Teddy.” Now it was his turn for guilt. “She might have hinted that there were some things going on.” He couldn’t bring himself to mention the fight he’d overheard. Ignored. Hermione nodded at this, unsurprised.
Harry frowned, but let it sink into a pout, aware it would amuse her. “Why do you have to be so sodding reasonable? Couldn't we have just had a sulk together? You couldn’t give me that, for like a day? A good brood?”
And there Harry stood, among Draco’s things. Only when Harry set his bags down did Draco remember to close the door.
information. You really think anonymous owls picked up on those tube stations? Figured out your first suspect was the right one? Half the time I’m reading horrible suspicions about myself and how I got the job. The other half are rumours about you.” Malfoy must have seen the expression spreading on Harry’s face, because he pressed on, buzzing with energy. “It was
Draco groaned, allowing his hands to roam freely, finally, over the expanse of Harry’s shoulders, the softness of his nape, the warm, forbidden skin of his lower back beneath his shirt. “Hopefully not too quick,” he got out, mouth exploring each inch he uncovered. If he could have this, if the world really wouldn’t burn with it, he would savour every moment he got.
“I’ll take that bet. I’ve wondered what the city looks like from up here. You can see those woods up there from our hotel room.”
“C’mon, Malfoy,” Harry muttered. Harry never sat in the front row at these things. It was impossible to concentrate when you could feel five hundred eyes on your back and the speaker staring you down. Rubbing a hand over his face, Harry turned around to head toward the breakfast set up he’d caught sight of on his way in. The seats would probably fill up more by the time he got back.
He’d been so certain that all he needed, the one thing outstanding, was the truth he’d ignored in the Department. That final case left unresolved.
Harry made his voice softer. “The lights, in the room. Or the bathroom. Whichever. It was nice of you to keep them off last night, but I’m not the world’s lightest sleeper. You can turn them on to see, or whatever, it won’t bother me.”
On the street the next morning, Malfoy set a brisk pace toward the designated conference building. Harry had offered a good morning back in the room that went unacknowledged, but Malfoy had waited for Harry to gather his things before leaving. Same detente as the office, then.
“But it’s not better for me,” he said, annoyed at how much it sounded like whinging. “There are a lot of capable adults in the Auror Department. And the world at large. I don’t have to solve everything.”
Potter had disappeared from public life before Draco’d left England. Draco’d read the papers back then. Speculation ran wild after the Ministry charged the Wizarding World’s Hero with defacing Godric’s Hollow. Rumour had it he lingered at crime scenes, too, or went back after the fact. It didn’t sit right for Draco, given Potter’s upright image. But he wouldn’t use the word ‘clean’ for Potter either. It was faint, but the compound pulsed with the same dark power as the prior address. Another tainted place Potter seemed to call home.
He nudged at her with his foot. “What about you? I know I’m kind of a big deal, but, those didn’t seem like tears of joy.” She curled tighter around the pitcher, mouth going drawn. He adjusted his glasses, welcoming the familiar weight. “Even I could see that.”
Focusing on the envelopes again, Harry bent down to the lowest drawer of his filing cabinet and dropped the trio into the pile. Numerous others just like them were already there. Then he kicked the drawer shut and headed toward the canteen without sparing a single look for the desk that only moments before had captured his attention. The dealings of Aurors Jenkins and Flemings were not the only things from the Ministry on The List. Draco Sodding Malfoy had earned his own place on it years ago, when Harry first learned the prat would be entering the Auror Training Program.
Malfoy’s voice ran through the room. “Don’t bother, that mess is only going to get worse once we’re out there. The pamphlet says it’s going to be very windy.”
“Yes. To great success, until now.” He swirled the contents of his mug. “If I don’t go, it’ll take months for the next one to come around. I can’t imagine what a horror I’d be by then.” And for all her solicitousness, he didn’t imagine Minister Salas would appreciate further delay either. He skipped over the inability to work part—he’d had enough scolding on that point.
Jenkins stood on Harry’s other side, chewing on something vaguely tobacco smelling with his mouth open. “Occamies, eh? Don’t think I’ve ever seen one of those in person.”
“I don’t know, Potter. Surely not every life is worth the bother.” With that, Malfoy drank deeply from his drink and slipped into the crowd.
Draco tugged his mouth into a customer service smile. “Not necessary, Potter. Just trying to do my job.”
She gave him a look. “Of course not. I’m going to take the job. But.” She pressed her hands flat on the table and flicked her head to toss some hair back. “I will make clear that I will be accepting the job on the condition that I get to come home by seven and work one weekend a month.”
“Oh, I’m not worried,” Draco said, his first words since they’d changed into the dressing gowns. They’d long discussed this beforehand. “Wouldn’t look good for me to die here. Pretty compromising position.”
Malfoy looked up at him. After a moment, he brought his hand up to block out some of the sun. “Not a fan of being a walking PSA?”
Draco hmmed, his fingers drawing along the inches of Harry’s skin and parting the belt until he could slide the whole thing over Harry’s shoulders and toss it to the side. “Better now,” Draco admitted, lower lip pursing a little. His fingers pressed down and around the edges of Harry’s hip bones, sliding against the skin.
Malfoy huffed before taking a drink. His breath fogged up the edge of his glass. “I’m sure. Now here’s what
misread it. Gotten ahead of himself. No, he wouldn’t bother with it now. Better to just… wait and see. If Harry ever actually showed up.
Swallowing, Harry moved himself over to lean against the door jamb. Sound carried best there, the side with no hinges. If you knew what to listen for. And these hotel doors were so cheaply made. Harry closed his eyes and focused on his heart beating, letting it slow down, his growing unease melt away. Malfoy had to be doing something in there.
“Piss off,” he said, kicking a practice bludger a bit further down the pitch. She put her hands on her hips.
“I suppose.” Harry’s shoulders began to lower. “But you reviewed them, and you found something helpful. We solved the Milbourne matter. Should be starting the trial next month.”
“So let’s have it, then. No no,” Potter added when Draco reached toward the flap of his bag. “I’ll summon it. Keep your hands where I can see them.” Draco did so, watching the package rise and float over to Potter’s hand. Potter looked it over, felt its weight, before reviewing the address. He scowled and tossed it into the air. It held there, suspended for one short moment, then burst into flames. Potter was
“‘Mione…” Harry’s throat caught at the words. His tongue felt too thick to speak around, the knot of feelings in his chest pulling his lungs tight.
Potter’s body shook. Sweat dripped from his hair. And the inky colour rose higher up his body, rolling over the curve of his jawline toward his mouth.
“But—” Harry paused, The List flashing red in his mind. Except The List was meant for England, thousands of miles away, and with the city beside them, and Malfoy near, the damned mint all around him, he continued: “But what if I can see you as someone else. What if I want to?” He pushed closer against the resistance of Malfoys’ hands. “What if I already do?”
She had a point, but Harry refused to acknowledge it. With a wave, they saw themselves to bed. Harry put away the blankets and packed up the remaining files, but even in the expanse and comfort of his bed, the thoughts didn’t slow. What if the files weren’t enough? What if Harry had missed something because he didn’t have the full picture? He pulled one of the unread files over to him to try and skim it for an idea of its contents, but somewhere between pages one and five he fell asleep.
Harry made it a habit the rest of the week to get in early. He brought a canteen of coffee with him and sandwiches or baked goods from a stand so he could eat at his desk and minimise breaks. After the second day, he’d asked Hermione if it would be possible to arrange a conference room for him to move everything. Charms or no, the depth of evidence was too significant to keep between the very two people being investigated. She wasn’t set to join the DMLE for at least two more weeks as she wound down her work in the The Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, but she was happy to give Harry the space there instead.
“Sod off,” he said, covering his warming cheeks with a quick adjustment of his glasses. “My best mates’ sleeping habits aren’t really top of mind.”
The sounds of Malfoy’s shuffling halted for a moment or two, then resumed again. “Yes, is the light working now? I put a call in to the front desk before I left to set up a service order.” Malfoy stepped into the hallway and reached past Harry for the door. “They must have taken care of it while we were at the conference. Ready to go?”
Alone for the first time in ages, Harry wandered into the kitchen. The Dursleys’ kitchen had always been so unfeeling, spotless (at Harry’s hand), but bland. He liked his condo’s light wood counters against the exposed brick in the walls. They held recipe books that were clearly swiped from The Burrow, several mugs and a French press, sets of Chudley Cannon tea towels Harry had not bought. The space felt used, loved, if a bit of a mess. Harry took the time to set it back to right. It felt nice to put his magic to work on something domestic.
From the parking lot, the guide directed them into a small grouping of trees. The guides played lookout and when the area was cleared of Muggles, they were Side-Alonged to the stretch of beach off of San Francisco and opposite the Headlands. Harry liked the Headlands more from this side of the strait. The stretch of them seemed placed in better context now, with the long stretches of green and battered coast.
“Alright, alright.” Draco’s foot arched and searched for Harry’s in the water. Finding him, he stepped close enough to bump noses. The steam curled around them and Draco’s dressing gown, saturated and heavy, swelled at Harry’s knees.
Harry watched Ron slide in beside Hermione and budged over when Ginny gave him a sharp poke in the ribs to make room.
Harry forced his expression to stay neutral. He was going to shred up that bloody useless To Do list the minute he got home. Robards went on: “You can think about it, of course. I believe you can cancel your conference registration on Monday at the latest without extra expense to the Ministry. Why don’t you take the weekend to think about it?”
Harry felt the cold through his jacket, sinking deep to his skin. “If that’s the case,” Harry said, tone harsh to his ears. “Then let me be clear about ‘Harry Potter.’ You do not tell me what I can and can’t do. It’s my business what I think of someone—whether I think of someone. And it’s pretty rich, frankly, for someone who sits behind a paperwork fortress, avoiding eye contact all day, to talk to me about keeping an eye on things.”
The woman speaking Spanish narrowed her eyes when she finished speaking with her companion. “You have an iPhone, Dave, look it up.”
Potter sat in a chair he’d pushed back on its hind legs. His feet balanced against the deck’s guardrail. He could have just left the trials, he looked so untouched by time. The same ruinous and wild hair, eyes hidden behind the same awful glasses. Revolving in the air beside him was an apple, red as the peppers had been, its skin slowly peeling away with each rotation.
“Potter,” he yelled. “Nott Delivery Service. Got a package for you.” Only the wind answered. The doorframe opened into a mostly empty room. Sand had poured between the slats and covered half the floor and a sofa. A faded family photograph hung askew on the wall. Beer cans rolled back, then forward in a corner. At the edges of a discarded magazine, a curved scorpion tail flicked out to rustle the pages.
He ignored them, clutched his bag, and left the bullpen. Going abroad with Malfoy was already a compromise of The List. He would not indulge himself any further. And if he swung his bag just so to knock over some of the papers on Malfoy’s desk on the way out, no one could prove it.
“You can always wait for the next conference yourself, if it would be that much of a challenge. I could try to find someone else to monitor him and go in your stead, though that’ll be another bloody phone call. Maybe one of the junior Aurors, they’re easy enough to strong arm. You’d have to prepare yourself to take a few months of leave, though.”
Now all he has to do is wait. Wait for his old enemy to make his way to the Manor again. And help him…
That moment Draco couldn't help but let a tear escape his eye. Not able to answer Harry without breaking into a sob, Draco softly stroke the boy's wild hair and gave him a kiss on his forehead. Harry sighed of contentment and squeezed the blond's hand a bit. It was a wonderful feeling to have his lion so close to him again; a feeling of safety radiating from his presence — but at the same time it was terrible having to lie to him and keep secrets he would find terrible if found out. Wasn't it like Dumbledore had told him to remember?
Not to mention the fact that he never really liked owls. Probably because the Eagle owl he had during his time at Hogwarts wasn't very friendly to him; he used to bite his fingers a lot and often return with wrinkled or nearly destroyed letters.
But the tears couldn't cover the ugliness of the dark, red lines on his stomach and chest. Hurried footsteps were heard as Harry nearly ran to Draco, taking his cold hands in his warm ones. 'Shh, it's alright — it's just scars,' he told Draco in a soothing way, yet with an undertone of worry and guilt. It didn't help, as Draco's tears kept falling down, his body slowly shaking with every escaping sob. 'Don't you remember?'
used to torture Muggles during the first war, did everything to help taking down the Ministry he had always despised the rulers of. He did everything to help this Riddle clear the name of the Purebloods and help to restore a world that should've always been a Wizard-only one in the first place.
Harry nodded and added another string of kisses as encouragement. When he reached the edge where Draco’s palm met the flat of his hand, he gave it a small nip and pulled back. “Turn around for me?”
Draco wiped his forehead and proceeded at a slower pace, his hands clenched around the strap of his bag.
“Thank you, sir,” Harry said. “I appreciate the effort.” He thought of Minister Salas. There’d been an owl at his desk telling him who to speak with to schedule the interview when he got back. “I think I’ll actually be around for a few days anyway. Have a matter I need to wrap up first.”
She paused, eyeing him. “What are you going on about? The two of you are together all the time. Didn’t you just go to Paris?”
“So it seems.” Draco futzed with his empty glass. “It’s going to make her a terrible solicitor. She’ll be nothing if she doesn’t build up some discretion.”
“But if you haven’t read the files,” Draco began, sealing his suitcase shut. “How do you know what they’ve been up to?”
“There’s a season of events, among all the old families. They rotate hosting balls, hunts, gaming nights. A lot of empty conversation and boasting in formal clothes.”
Warm breath? Draco opened his eyes. The Deniden sat on him, gaze unblinking. Seeing him awake though, it stretched its wings wide. They were enormous.  A cold seeped down Draco’s spine.
His gaze traced over some of the bodies on display. Pulling was out of the question, no matter how fit everyone seemed or how welcome the distraction would be. If Malfoy’d been flustered by the sight of another’s body, Merlin knew how’d be responding to some of the things Harry saw now. Or to a place this crowded. Except he wasn’t caring what Malfoy thought. He stepped into the mix, dodging various couplings to get to the stairs for the second floor. He could catch up with the rest of the group for a while at least.
The surprise that returned to Malfoy’s face withered into a kind of disbelief. “You shouldn’t.” He took a large step to the side, though his fingers reached for Harry as he did so. “You can’t.
“Auror Potter. Have a seat.” Robards gestured from his behind his desk, eyes trained on the report in his hands. “It’ll be just a minute, I want to finish up this page.”
“I would have found out anyway. His Department reports to mine as well, you know, when the tips are relevant to magical beasts.” Hermione watched Malfoy pick up his fallen items as she finished her yoghurt. He seemed small in his lavender jumper and brown trousers. “The Central Repository for Accurate and Probable Information.” She shook her head, nose scrunching. “Clever, but cruel.”
“Huh.” Ron thought on it some more, nursing the lightly alcoholic drinks Hermione had prepared to power them through, then picked the files back up. This time when he looked at her, Hermione gave him a shrug.
“Yeah.” Harry wet his lips, unable to resist the smile stretching across his face. “I’d like that a lot.”
Mint. It floated around him. Swallowing, he stepped around the cubicle wall and stopped for the stretch of lean, white-blond man leaning back in the chair before him. Jenkins’s old desk.
“Ugh.” He sat up, his hands flung out to either side of him. Malfoy didn’t seem the type to fall asleep in a bathroom. Hadn’t seemed that drunk either. Maybe it was a ploy? To distract him while he stayed somewhere else? No, Malfoy’s bag still sat in its same neat spot on the hotel luggage rack. And it seemed too elaborate a ruse. Harry checked the hallway again. The question remained what the hell he was still doing in there. What he had been doing the whole trip.
Though Draco might be a “maybe” himself, assuming he hadn’t misread last week entirely. Except he probably
“Oh, sure. Another Manhattan please. And, er, whatever that gentleman last ordered.” The bartender nodded, returning a few minutes later with the drinks. Harry charged it to the room, then walked across the floor space. London had begun to build its own share of tall structures, but nothing like the ones in front of him. His gaze swept across the colours, the glimpse of the water further on. Stories below, he could make out the small shapes of people beginning to hustle onto the streets. They seemed so far away.
At a small table in an Italian restaurant, facing the large glass windows along the pavement, Harry reviewed the titles from the day’s presentations and tried to remember what the speakers had said. ‘The
Hermione shook her head, her curls tickling at his cheeks. “You didn’t mean to. I mean, you were definitely avoiding everything—” He winced. ”But you’d never leave me alone on purpose. I know that. I just. Sometimes I can’t do this all by myself, and when Ron isn’t around, it feels strange to talk to Molly…”
Malfoy groaned, though he stopped as well to watch Harry search in the sand. “There’s making do with the situation, and then there’s voluntarily seeking it out. The showers at Hogwarts were just a way of life. And I’m not even going to comment on the loos.” Malfoy bent at the knees near Harry’s side, rummaging for a few shells himself. “Besides, those people aren’t here for my viewing pleasure: they’re here for their own. It’s fairly common on the continent. Munich has a park in the centre of the city dedicated to nudity.”
He brought down half a set for tea before recalling what he’d come to the kitchen for and switched to a pair of tumblers. He stepped over to the pantry as well and took out some of the Chelsea buns he’d ordered for the next day’s Christmas lunch. If he got up early enough, he could probably salvage together another tray or two. And if they all had to overdo it on mimosas instead, the group would manage.
“It’s a good opportunity to meet experts in the field,” Malfoy said. “And to promote my department.”
When Harry didn’t move, Draco pulled the gift tighter to his chest, forcing Harry a few inches closer. For the tiniest of moments, Draco allowed himself a glance at Harry’s mouth, the source of so much teasing and fantasy. The smell of Harry’s cologne surrounded him, and he struggled to find his thoughts through the thickening want rushing his veins. “Thank you.”
The Deniden felt heavy in his dreams. Its limbs pressed the air from his chest, and the pads of its feet still pricked at Draco’s ribs. He reached to push it away, and warm breath skated his palm.
"She'd probably take it as a compliment, getting a spot on there," Ron said, ladling out portions. He set the dishes aside, tossed off his apron, and took a seat next to Hermione. "Alright, bone-ape-tit, or whatever.”
Malfoy nodded and murmured something too quiet for Harry to hear. The official stepped away with a wave, and Malfoy closed the few feet remaining between them. He avoided Harry’s eyes, his fair skin flushed. Harry watched the rhythmic brush of his right arm along his left.
He swirled the contents of his glass. “Can’t say.” He took a deep drink. “Learned more than I cared to though.” Malfoy had no place in his home. These bricks, the fireplace, belonged to Harry. He considered the few swigs that remained, then downed the rest. The liquid blazed going down, and he welcomed the spreading heat. His charm had dried him off but done nothing for the chill. Hermione gestured for his glass and filled it again.
“Nothing special. It’s actually a joint matter with The Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. They think they’ve got someone illegally breeding and selling Occamies. I’m just consulting on some of the procedural stuff, doing some interviews.”
Harry reached up to adjust his glasses, then pulled his hand back when they met an empty nose. “What do you mean?”
Harry turned the map around as he oriented himself. “Part of my uniform,” he said, tracing a line down the paper with his finger. “Hotel’s only a few blocks away. It’s Muggle, so figured we walk?” Harry folded the paper back into his pocket and started off. It took Malfoy a moment, but the heel of his leather shoes had a distinctive enough patter behind him soon after.
, scripted in dark blue across the top, had a matte shine. Harry tapped his fingers along the envelopes’ seams. He had no unsolved cases in England at the moment. Nothing
“What the hell is a panoptic tower,” he muttered to himself, glancing over the summary of the session. He flipped to the appropriate pages of the binder and read over the slides replicated there. A forlorn prisoner. A single guard tower in the middle of a circular building, the windows obscuring the guard’s outline. The tables beside him laughed, and Harry set the materials aside once the food came. He’d learned more from speaking with Malfoy than twenty minutes with that binder.
She sat back at the question, the edges of her mouth tightening. “Not at all. I get invitations to their balls though, now that they’re back on the circuit. I can’t imagine what Narcissa is thinking.”
Charm: Keeping Watch While You’re Away.’ ‘At What Cost: Valuing The Right to Privacy When Lives Are At Stake.’ ‘The Magical Applications and Properties of the Panoptic Tower.’
Turning away to collect his bed clothes, Harry stepped around the corner and back into the small hallway to change and prepare for bed.
“I’ll wait as long as you need,” he murmured against the skin, letting his tongue mark a path now back across Draco’s shoulders. Draco relaxed by the third rotation, pressing almost boneless back into Harry’s arms. At that, Harry returned his gaze back to the mirror, his lips along the edge of Draco’s ear.
To his left, the sand mixed with gravel into a lane. It connected to no road he could see, but it was something, so he started skating forward. Without buildings or mountains, the sky seemed farther than usual—even the celestial kept its distance from this place. He shared the sentiment.
"I’ll have whatever isn’t wine." Harry set out the remainder of the treats and Vanished the box. "It’s been nothing but wine for months, and I don’t care how ‘fragrant’ it is, or how many years it’s sat, or how many ‘tannins’ there are, I can’t get a taste for that stuff."
“No, that was 1974, those Durmstrang kids on break in Germany,” Jenkins said, with a large, dismissive swat of his hand. It barely missed the edge of Harry’s glasses. Harry took a seat and started to pull out the contents of his bag folder by folder, refusing eye contact with either of the oafs.
Harry considered asking for more, but chose to leave it be. Ron’s approval didn’t matter if Malfoy had no place in Harry’s life. And that was what would happen. He’d solve the case, and then he’d go. To Spain. Without him. Or saying goodbye. Harry put his file down, the lilting, sinking feeling distracting him until he picked up the next file.
Harry got to his feet, arms rigid at his sides. What utter bullshit. You could be whoever you wanted: do what you did and didn’t want. “I think I’m starting to understand what you were saying earlier. Except the problem isn’t me, or how other people perceive you, Malfoy. It’s not that I can’t like you—it’s that
Malfoy—Draco—returned the smile. Then it dropped into something warm, if a little serious. “Now get to work.”
“Then maybe it’s for the best. And who knows, maybe they’ll promote him. That could be an apology in itself.”
Relief hit him as he watched Malfoy go. In the primary conference room, Harry found his spot from the day before. A few people waved hello, and a group joined him this time. Malfoy, too, was surrounded, even at the very front of the room again.
His hand tightened on the door handle, willing it to open. Malfoy could be hurt. He’d been so tense when they left. That energy had to go somewhere. And that tiny room didn’t have many things to break. Even fewer people.
He then suddenly seemed to lose the strength in his knees, his legs. They trembled, wobbled even as he fell to the ground and watched the students around him slowly fade. His eyes twirled away, into a new nightmare — into a new vision. Dark tiles with an emerald shine from floor to ceiling, gleaming a macabre light. Through doors, through rooms — the green light changing to blue. Glass orbs everywhere, the scream of a boy. Searching, running. The pale body of someone — the source of the scream. Silver hair, a face shining of fresh tears and a golden medallion around his neck.
There hasn't been a sign of Malfoy since his trial, not a word nor a newspaper article. It's almost like he completely disappeared from the world, hiding away somewhere in the Draco constellation. But who knows, maybe he's happier between the stars.
Draco turned himself to Harry and took ahold of his hand again. 'Do you want to stay?' He asked but judging by the anger in the boy's green eyes — Harry wasn't feeling like staying at all. The boy indeed shook his head and Draco took him away from the loud music and loud voices — away from a chaos that wasn't even supposed to be there. On their way they picked up Hermione and Draco showed her a room of which he knew for certain was free; where she could stay and rest like they had planned on doing.
At those words, Fleur suddenly seemed fully awake; eyes wide and a bright smile appearing on her face. Every normal boy would have melted at such a sight, yet Draco felt unmoved.
; Draco immediately noticed it as everything was more elaborate than usual; more food, more choices of beverages and the usual blue decorations were recolored into a bubble gum pink.
,' he thanked McGonagall whom gave him somewhat of a smile — more like a slight lift of the corner of her mouth — in return. 'I do know where the Potions classroom is,
'It is actually. I don't believe I've ever seen you smile like that in my entire life! It's so not- not
"Aren't your powers equally as strong as his then?" Harry now asked, simply out of curiosity and perhaps a growing fear towards Samael as well.
"Yeah—," André now jumped in. "— we're starting to wonder if you aren't killing them on purpose or something."
Draco could literally see Hermione curse herself from the inside out. 'Why didn't you ask Ron instead?'
Harry's arm felt scorched when they arrived at number four, yet he hadn't complained about it once to the boy; had let him support his full weight onto his own thin frame. Not that the boy weighed that much; perhaps even the same as him. Opening the front door, Harry hoped for dear life that Dudley wasn't home yet, and as he helped the boy inside with small, light footsteps he tried to stay as silent as he could — just to make sure. "Finally home, Potter?" came a voice. Harry's heart jumped out of surprise. "There's dishes waiting for you in the sink and potatoes waiting to be peeled!" Another jump at the realization that it was only aunt Petunia's screeching voice coming from the kitchen, and not that of his nephew.
' she said before disappearing behind a portrait of a tall Witch with a purple cat by her side. Other girls also went into their rooms; portrait after portrait opened up to only be closed again after a second. When almost all the blue was drained from the cosy new room, Draco also retreated back to his room, closing the portrait of Raphael behind him.
Harry let out a short laugh. 'I must admit they did look quite scary, right? Can't believe I have to face one within weeks!' His earlier smile turned into a grimace and he looked down at the books again. 'You must tell me everything you know.'
‘Fleur,’ Draco whispered. The girl didn't react to it, keeping her eyes firmly shut. Draco sighed and gave her a small push against the shoulder, an action that caused her to frown slightly.
A wave of panic wraps around Draco's heart for just a second, before he remembers his concealment charm and once again replaces his fear with anger. “You want to see my Dark Mark?” he spats once again, agitated.
Harry thinks about this for a second. How is it that only one Death Eater, out of all they had arrested, has been able to survive for so long? Why couldn't the others stand the macabre circumstances the prison offers? He also tells this to Ron, who just nods and seems eager to continue his story.
It was soon enough though that their blue, silk robes got stained with blood and dirt. Their hats fell off, their hair loose. The twins were staying close to Draco’s side, blasting curses together with him — joining their power. They looked older as well all of the sudden — as if they had aged with ten years since Draco had last seen them. The tears he had felt coming before he felt again — but he swallowed them away and kept his mind focused.
He kneeled down next to him, followed by Ron and a still giggling Hermione. What was happening? Why did Harry suddenly collapse and why did he seem to be in so much pain? 'He's having another vision,' Hermione explained as if reading his mind, sighing deeply and serious again now her strange mood had passed. 'I thought he had the skill of Occlumency under control by now.'
Raising his chin a little and returning his eyes to look at his father, Draco threw him a vile glare. 'I will use whatever language I want. You cannot tell me what to do.'
,' Draco let out as he took in the room. 'She has added quite a few things since the last time I came along a trip down here.'
Draco's nostrils flared as he let out a deep sigh. He took ahold of Harry's face with both his hands and stared into the boy's emerald eyes. 'Stop saying you're sorry, Harry. There's
Professor McGonagall appeared behind them, the tiniest of smiles lingering upon her lips. 'The Yule Ball is of course a chance for us all to — er — let our hair down,' she said. 'Let's show the others what
Draco turned himself to Harry again, who finally looked up once more. His eyes were their pale gray again, and it relieved Harry somehow. "That is because I did not use my power — but what if you're staring and I accidentally will? What if I lock eyes with you too long and do not realize that I am sucking the soul out of your body? What if—"
‘Fleur,’ he whispered again. Her eyes then opened slowly, blinking a few times before taking in Draco’s face.
It now was the day of Draco's departure, the day he would return to Beauxbatons and then to his family. They had had their last meal, had heard Dumbledore's warning speech and had said their good-byes. But they just couldn't let go. The carriage was to depart within an hour, and Draco and Harry had decided to take one last walk by the Lake, the place where they had spent a lot of time together over the year. 'Promise to write me letters, at least,' Draco told him as they sauntered past the spot where they used to practice the Bubble-Head Charm.
The dark prison rises up in front of them as a sharp, black rock. It must've been an even more horrible place to visit when the Dementors still guarded the place, Harry then thinks to himself, still feeling the terror and despair of haunted visitors and prisoners in his bones.
Harry had always wanted to visit Malfoy Manor, wanted to know what the place Draco called his home was like. At least; one of his homes. Harry knew his true home was that in France — the cottage on the countryside with a beautiful sea not too far away. A place where the French could relax on a sandy beach, a beautiful horizon throwing orange light upon his pale face. Yet he knew Draco had spent most of his life at the manor. A dark place, he had told him, where a winter's cold seemed to haunt the corridors even during the warmest of summer days. Harry simply couldn't see the two together — and now that he had to go there soon enough himself, he didn't feel that excited anymore either.
‘Your hair! It's so- so long!' Harry blurted out, eyes still opened wide and focused on Draco's locks.
Harry had leaned against the wall to watch Malfoy’s progress, but straightened against it now, his arms uncrossing. “I asked at the front desk, but they said they were out of doubles.”
Harry finished sliding his arms through his jacket before zipping it up. “Yeah, figured I’d get a look around before dinner. You heading out?”
The pair of them headed straight back to the room once the sessions were over. The schedule allowed for only a twenty minute break before the groups were to meet back in front of the conference building for the buses that would ferry them to their respective afternoon outings. Harry might have looked into these things sooner if he knew they included these touristy bits. The only other one he’d attended was a somber affair on processing overseas magical beings coming to England. If that had an outing, he’d skipped it.
Across the room, the door opened up and a different official led Malfoy past the processing desks and toward where Harry was seated.
He stepped through the door into the light. The desert landscape flashed white. Pale sand stretched to the horizon, lines drawn and curved across its surface by the wind. The boundary between earth and sky wavered and blurred as he stared. Between them, the sharp branches of tumbleweeds spotted the expanse, some cacti and rocks, but little else. The heat had mass in places like this. It pressed against him when he moved, held his hair down, even with the charm of his blades regulating the temperature.
“I see,” Harry said in the ensuing silence. They weren't ones for discussing policing philosophies, and Harry usually left the techy parts to the specialists. “Then, er, what about it?”
Swallowing, Harry led them forward across the room. This close, the mint from Draco’s shampoo dominated the lavender in the air. Harry may have gone overboard in running the bath in advance. Some scents were battling, one breath bringing a smoky cedar, another a lilac grove. He should have just bought the mint, but it had seemed lazy at the time.
Harry tried to chase the thought, but he could smell the brightness of the ginger ale from Malfoy’s breath. Malfoy’s eyelashes were darker than his hair, more of a dirty blond.
“Goodnight, Draco.” Harry murmured it into Draco’s skin. There was something beneath the mint, a fresh warmth, like new laundry. He chased it briefly with his nose, closing his eyes.
When they stepped in sync out of the queue, Malfoy wouldn’t meet his eyes. Harry felt lifted from his win and pulled out a second biscuit. He broke it in half and offered Malfoy one side. The man eyed it. When Harry waved it a little in his gaze, Malfoy finally looked at Harry as well.
Before Harry could respond, the bartender handed them each a drink. He let Malfoy get a few swigs down and enjoyed his personal victory. Theory proved. “I get that. That’s one of the nice things about getting away once in awhile. If no one knows who you are, you get to decide how they see you.”
“I see. And we’re taking it up there?” Malfoy gestured toward the inclined street going up and to their left.
The disdain on Malfoy’s face sent Harry back a decade, to a sneering expression on the other side of a hundred toxic exchanges. “Makes us even then? For—” He let the sentence hang unfinished. His mouth moved to find the words, but nothing came out. “And all your friends feel this way?” Malfoy set his empty glass down with a controlled force, then shrugged his jacket back on. “Good to know.”
The tightness in his stomach warmed at Harry’s expression. “As it should be," Harry said, his voice going lower as he shifted closer. "So... is this for me?” Harry snatched up the gold wrapped gift. Draco got a hand on it, but Harry was too fast and had already started to pull it into his chest.
don’t understand. What’s with this?” Malfoy’s long fingers circled in the air toward Harry’s face, almost touching the edges of Harry’s hair. “It’s strange, using a Glamour, for someone all about how freeing it is here. And it is very distracting to see you without glasses.”
about them? Send them to Robards. Internal Affairs. Shacklebolt if you have to. You don’t need me to handle it. You’ve never needed me with all those Aurors tossing you around. You’ve always seemed more than capable of handling it yourself.”
Harry looked at her. The lightness of her tone didn’t match her eyes, which avoided him. Ron’s remark about the Ministry suddenly lingered between them.
“Ah, yes.” So he’d known he was late. Draco took his time getting settled back into his chair. Rolled his shoulders. Straightened the bow on the gift box. “This is it, actually.” He watched Harry’s face in the mirror above the bar.
Draco opened the exit door, then froze. The compound shone under the dark night’s sky with a bloody crimson light. Wind kicked up in circles around each of the buildings, rising from glowing lines on the ground—Potter’s casting circle. He ducked. Planks of wood spiraled overhead as they snapped free of the fences and deck. Shrubbery, too, and rocks from the road were drawn into the sky.
“Why don’t you go collect Teddy? We’re all going out for drinks at the pub soon—Neville, Susan, maybe Luna if she makes it—you’re welcome to join us once you take him home.”
Before Malfoy could step away, Harry curled his fingers around the elbow of the other man’s jacket. The fabric felt soft, pliant under his fingers, though Malfoy’s body beneath was sharp and hard. “Come on, where are you going? What does it even matter here? We’re different people.”
Harry stayed near the window for a while after Malfoy left, watching the sun set. The buildings blinked on like stars. They were built so close to the hotel, glass from floor to ceiling. If his gaze lingered, he discerned the colour schemes of living rooms; floral duvets in a darkly painted bedroom; children playing in a room with office and workout equipment. Beyond, the cloud cover over the Bay hid the supposed prison from view, but he could imagine it now: life a century before, the knowledge that out there, an unknown number of souls were confined. Azkaban seemed kinder by comparison. At least in the middle of a roaring sea, the prisoners were miles from any other signs of life. This island prison, though—the inmates had to have seen the city from their windows; known that only a mile or two away was freedom, a bustling world going on without them.
Around an hour later two Wizards Harry vaguely recognized appeared at the house, ushered the Dursleys to their car with their belongings in a trailer behind. Uncle Vernon had nearly gotten a heart-attack when they had shrunken a few of their furniture pieces — saying that they weren't planning on driving back-and-forth six times. With closed eyes and a face the color of a tomato, the Wizards had managed to get Mr. and Mrs. Dursley willingly into their car. Only Dudley was left, lingering next to the vehicle with a confused look upon his chubby face. As he was about to step into the car, he suddenly froze — glanced from his parents to Harry and back. 'Isn't Harry coming with us?' he asked, obviously still confused.
Potter wasn't wearing his Auror robes like last time but had traded them for a pair of jeans and an oversized t-shirt. Something about the man and his oversized clothes made Draco think that Potter wasn't capable of properly dressing himself. A stupid smile was visible on his face, too grin-like to be genuine. Draco's hands were itching to just slap the bastard right in the face to make it disappear, but a little voice in his head murmured that Potter looked quite… cute, smiling like that.
Dumbledore let out a sigh; one almost completely soundless but definitely there. 'I know, my boy. I know. And you'll hurt Harry with that fact, I know that as well. But listen,' the headmaster now rose from his seat and moved to Draco's side, seated himself on the other chair where Harry had once been seated as well. 'He'll eventually understand.'
Opening his eyes again and immediately pointing them at Harry, the boy frowned, as if Draco thought the way to open the vault was to murder him or something. But he wasn't interested in Harry — at least, not at this moment — but in the sword he was holding. Reaching out for it, he clamped his hand around the iron and slid down, causing a cut in his palm. Blood dripped down the silver of the sword, drops falling onto the stone flooring of the underground cave. A gasp had escaped Hermione's lips, but Draco saw in the corner of his eye that Hermione seemed to realize exactly what he was doing as well. Turning around again, Draco pressed his hand against the iron door; exactly there where the iron was a lot darker than other places. Colored by blood of his ancestors. As soon as the blood touched the cold surface, something inside the door went into motion. He pulled his hand away again; leaving behind a dark-red handprint with a macabre look to it.
'It's so- so big!' He called out, facing Draco for the first time since they'd entered. His eyes looked away almost immediately again to take a better look at the depicted mermaid as she wove her hand at him. 'Can you use this bathroom every day?'
Draco immediately knew what that meant. And of course he was scared; it was a commitment he wouldn't be able to refrain from. He could've ran away after Father's words. He could've at least done something. But he didn't. Remaining seated in one of the wooden chairs of the drawing room, he waited for his faith. Taking the Dark Mark, produced by the Dark Lord's wand, was the most painful feeling Draco had ever experienced in his entire life. And it will probably remain that way for the rest of his life. It felt like his skin was burning away; a million snakes moving underneath his skin. Yet he didn't dare to scream, protest or make a single expression with his face.
Dumbledore didn't react to Harry's words — beside from his widening grin at least. 'Why is it exactly that you are so angry with mister Malfoy, Harry?' Dumbledore asked instead.
Harry could only laugh at Draco's mocking and heard the whispers go silent. One of the hallway's doors opened with a load creak and the freckled face of Molly Weasley showed up behind it. A bright smile graced her lips as she opened her arms wide, walked over the Harry and hugged him to near-death. 'Harry!' she called out. 'You're finally here!' She gave a peck on Harry's cheek before noticing Draco behind him, looking a bit lost. 'And mister Malfoy, I see you're here as well.'
Passing through a set of double doors, Draco entered another large, open room with very little furniture inside. The lights were slightly dimmed and added to the gloomy atmosphere that hung in the air. In there he found a handful of other angels, more brothers of his, lounging around. They almost immediately laughed as well, shaking their heads. "You must feel
‘Well, can’t you examine his body then? There must at least be something that can help in solving this?'
Potter now also bites his lip, eyes away from Draco as if he doesn't dare to look into the face of disappointment.
It resulted in no sleep at all, and as he was having breakfast with Hermione early the next morning, he found it terribly hard to stay awake. 'Are you alright?' Hermione asked. 'How did it go?'
Finding the Department of Cursed Corpses was one of the most difficult things Harry had ever done. It was almost as difficult as finding a damn Horcrux! Together with Ron he explored every inch of the Ministry at least three times; not finding anything that could point in it's direction. Nobody talked about it, wrote about or even heard about, besides Kingsley of course.
. He tried to stay calm, told himself if he tried now, it would be too soon. But the pain in his scar only increased by the second, and he was quickly running out of breath. It was as if Voldemort himself was pressing a finger on his scar again — was physically there and casting the Cruciatus Curse upon his figure. As his lungs started to protest, and he swore he could see a vague green light starting to glow from underneath Draco's palms — he grabbed for the locket around the boy's neck.
The Fat Lady turned herself fully towards Draco again, frowning at his name. 'I believe I've heard that name before. Are there any Gryffindors in your family?'
Neither of those words had ever left Dudley's lips in his entire life, and it had shocked both Harry as Dudley's parents so greatly that neither of them had been able to even eat half of their plates. Dudley on the other hand had eaten like a pig — a decent one for once though, which once more had shocked the Dudleys. Harry hadn't been surprised either when Vernon'd decided to call a doctor straight after he'd left the table, and the trio had driven off a few moments later.
— with Lavender Brown. Draco had heard her cry a few days ago as well; somewhere in a deserted corridor with enchanted birds swarming above her head. They had talked; she had confessed somewhat of having feelings for the ginger-haired boy — but had found it hard to openly confess to the boy himself.
Every passing day had seemed like a dream to Harry. A dream he had been able to live with Draco by his side. They had done almost everything together in need to feed a hunger for each other that didn't seem to get lessened by anything but each other's presence.
'We're insane for doing this!' Hermione now declared, also reaching the top of the hill and taking deep breaths. She was wearing dark, intricate robes — the kind Draco's mother usually wore. Her face was set dim, a look of disgust readable in her eyes as she held on to a flask of Polyjuice Potion. 'Breaking into Gringrotts! We've officially lost our minds…' Harry and Ron ignored her, Draco on the other hand agreed, but knew there was no other way.
knew. Rumors had traveled over the English Channel for years, telling the tale of a baby boy whom had survived the curse of Death. Mother had told him the boy was his age; born in the same year only a month after his very own birthday. Draco had always been interested in hearing stories, and the tale of
My plans are to perhaps finish Draconis Nox afterwards and upload a new story I'm working on (not going to spoil anything though).
Malfoy's eyes light up a bit, like the sun just broke through the clouds. 'About me? How interesting,' he replies. His sneer only grows wider, exposing a bit of his teeth. It's a smile Harry knows well from his Hogwarts days; one he only saw on the blond's face when he was extremely proud of a snide remark he made. But this time it seemed to hold a whole different meaning, but Harry wasn't sure what that meaning would be exactly. 'May I ask why?' he then asks.
It's a quarter to noon when they arrive at Malfoy Manor. Even though the glory days for the blond family are over, the front garden still looks exceptional. Somewhere between a few bushes he can see the pale white feathers of the peacocks, running around gardens where a dark force once ruled.
Draco's heart skipped a beat at Harry's genuine words. Hearing that the boy loved him was enough to slowly melt him away into nothingness, become one with the floor of his small compartment room.
Harry squeezed his hand, hadn't let go of it ever since he had taken it in his and gave Draco the weakest of smiles. 'I'm very proud of you for sharing that story with me. It must've been difficult for you growing up around a man that idolized such a monster.'
And there it is again; the terrible itching feeling followed by an immense pain. His knees start to shake and he collapses to the floor, hands spread out and heart beating faster than ever. Potter follows almost as fast; hand on Draco’s shoulder with great worry. Potter’s warm hand intensifies the pain and Draco roughly pushes it away. His hands find the buttons of his robes again and they’re off before he knows; leaving him once again vulnerable and half-naked in front of Potter. The curse crawls over his collarbone, making a way towards his neck and leaving Draco's eyesight within seconds.
'Thought you could dry yourself up with that wandless magic of yours,' Ron then said. 'At least, Harry told us you could.'
Green emeralds were shining in the pale moonlight that got casted through one of the windows of Grimmauld Place's bedroom. A few portraits, taken off the walls and turned around to grumble against nothing — a few books and pieces of clothing shattered across the floor. Two boys tangled as one, wishing that there were no dark days coming ahead, that there was no devil whom dressed in pink robes and that the Christmas holidays could last forever. A cold wind blew into the room from underneath the door, sending shivers down their spines but they had each other's warmth — a warmth that would be strong enough, they knew, to get them through the cold days ahead.
‘Oh, Arthur shut your mouth,’ Molly interfered. ‘He is nothing like his father — aren’t you, my boy?’
'Yes, later indeed, my boy. For now, a toast and presents, please!' Arthur announced, taking ahold of his wine glass with a shaking hand and raising it a few inches from the table. 'Merry Christmas.'
The sun starts to rise slowly but Draco doesn't lift his eyes from the music sheet, too focused on finishing his piece perfectly. And oh, it's going so perfectly indeed! Slide up, slide down, left fingers moving from string to string. The sore feeling in his fingers from playing a music piece so intensively isn't there; leaving nothing but numb fingers behind. It's and odd feeling; being able to move your fingers but not really getting any sense of what's beneath their touch.
Draco softly stroke Harry's cheek, watched how his eyes twitched fervently underneath his eyelids. Bad dreams. Nightmares.
Hiding behind trees with every step the pair took, he couldn't help but feel a little like a spy — and he wasn't even a good one as Hagrid noticed the sound of cracking branches and footsteps upon leafs. Fortunately Madame shook them off with asking personal questions about the tall man himself; Draco got to know all the details about his dog, Fang, and how much he loved working as Hogwarts' gamekeeper. Madame Maxime hung to every word the man seemed to say, something Draco was surprised about. He had never seen Madame be so gentle to another man, let alone have a decent conversation with one for longer than a few minutes. Perhaps it was the fact that they were both taller than average and a little…
The dining chamber was quickly filled with whispers; the words Triwizard and Tournament spreading like wildfire. Draco himself drew up his eyebrows, giving the twins a wide-eyed stare. Getting one returned he tried to remember everything he had learnt during
Hermione was seated next to him, now the one to be rather smug than the ginger-head. She still wasn't very pleased with her best friend spending so much time —
,' Draco then said. He finally realized something; something he hadn't thought of before but by seeing her so distressed and crying so much he suddenly saw it. Her words; had they been hers truly or words manipulated by a second party? Draco cursed himself on the spot for not realizing it sooner. 'He's here, isn't he?'
His words seemed to sink in the way Draco hoped they would; Ron's irritated expression cleared and was replaced by something like pity. Perhaps he had put his jealousy for his best friend away and realized that Harry had never asked to be the person he was; it had been decided by something — someone greater than them all. 'Alright, I believe you. But that doesn't mean I won't be watching
'Draco I never wanted you to—' Harry took a step closer but Draco took a step back in response. The boy seemed genuinely shocked, guilty of what he had made Draco do. At least he did seem to realize that fact; it was
The boy lifted his head and stretched out his arms with a yawn as if he had been sleeping. He then took ahold of Draco's hand again and locked like that, they sauntered out of the Hall.
When Harry woke up, Draco was still asleep in his arms. Harry watched how his close to white eyelashes were closed against his pearl skin, his breathing steady and lips more pink than ever because of all the kisses he had stolen from the boy. Harry pressed his lips against the boy's forehead and took in the strong lemony scent that always lingered around him. Draco slowly opened his eyes, awoken by Harry's soft kiss. He looked up into Harry's eyes and he realized that it was the first time he saw Draco look up instead of looking down; the tall blond that he was.
Draco got dragged forward by Harry's hand sliding up to his elbow to lock arms with him, before they entered the Great Hall.
. Flashes of his parents dying and others he didn't even know passed by, a pain as terrible as the curcio spell now filling his insides.
It quickly became clear to the boys that she was heading to Diagon Alley; the Leaky Cauldron only another street away. The crowd had thinned, the loud noises of Christmas carols slowly fading away. 'She could've flooed to Diagon Alley straight away; why all the effort of going through Muggle London?' Draco asked, his voice a whisper. Harry gave him a questioning look and pulled Draco into a dark alley as Umbridge glanced over her shoulder for the first time. A wary glance — one out of worry and suspicion.
Glancing from Draco to Snape, Harry found it difficult to keep up with any new information that was entering his mind. At least it sounded like Draco hadn't murdered Dumbledore at all — hadn't been able to complete his task but had Snape let it do it for him. The voices were also still clearly there downstairs and it almost sounded as if an intense battle was going on. 'Did you know what that spell was going to do?'
“Shall we open the hatch? He seems very persistent,” Draco suggested, but Harry simply lifted his shoulders.
Draco swallowed. This conversation appeared to be harder than he had thought; best to get it over with as soon as possible. '
Harry wondered to himself before rolling his eyes. Dudley now tightened his grasp on Harry's jacket, clearly not liking when his opponent was rolling his eyes and such — the
Harry gave Draco a smile, one that reached his eyes as well and made the tiniest of wrinkles appear around his eyes. It was a beautiful, genuine smile that Draco answered and made his cheeks feel even warmer. What was it about this boy that made him feel so… so
Yet he couldn't see besides the dark circles that grew around his grey eyes and the way his blond locks just didn't want to stay the way they once did. Malfoy seemed desperate to make it look like he was completely fine even though he was totally not. Something Harry himself never bothered to do; and it probably showed.
'I see,' Draco managed to get out. He swallowed and pulled his dressing gown more closed again. Arms crossed over one another, he tried to break through the sudden awkwardness between them. '
“You mean Unspeakable Davis?” Harry guesses and the jailer nods. “What was he scared of? The body or..?”
Harry takes a step into the entrance hall, closing the door behind him and then returning his eyes to Malfoy. He's standing by the stairs now, hands clutched in fists; one gloved in black leather and the other bare in its normal pale color. His back a little hunched, his eyes even more tired in the low light than before. A green shadow of a stained glass window hits his cheek slightly, and makes him look sick.
'Harry,' Draco began. 'How can you say I'm still as beautiful as before when you don't even dare to look at them?'
Dumbledore's slight smile disappeared as he opened a drawer of his desk and placed a shattered ring on top of it. 'This,' he started. 'Is the cause of the curse. My temptation had challenged me and had won; making me put on this ring and curse myself.' Draco hesitantly picked up the ring and studied it from a bit closer. There wasn't anything special noticeable about it; besides from the fact that there had been a symbol on the front which was now destroyed by whatever had destroyed the ring. 'It is one of many, I believe,' Dumbledore then said. 'But that's something for Harry to find out.'
They finally reached the edge; hunched down behind the first house they saw. With their backs against a cold, stone wall; they held their heads together to plan what to do next. The Marauder's map laid open on the ground, in the middle of their little circle. 'We can try to go through Honeydukes secret entrance,' Harry suggested, pointing at the narrow, underground way depicted on the map.
Harry could feel his heart skip a beat at the woman's name. The memory of her calling out Sirius name after she had killed him coldly still made him angry and sad — still tore his soul apart every time he thought about her laugh. How she had nearly destroyed the Burrow, and how she was always on that monster his side. As he was lost in his thoughts and his friends as well, they all lowered their wands without realizing — and gave Mundungus the opportunity to disapparate.
“Are you sure Malfoy is also suffering from the curse, Harry?” Ron asks, his eyes fixated on the portrait of a black cat on one of the walls. “I mean, it's been five years and there hasn't been one report from St. Mungo's asking for a healer to come over to Malfoy Manor. Neither did we receive any reports on the matter. But on the other hand, nobody has heard from the ferret since his trial so maybe he's already dead.”
,' he told him, and Ron obeyed with a small nod of his head. Everything Draco's eyes could see, he himself had never seen before. He didn't even know his family owned a statue of a horse. Out of all creatures. 'There doesn't seem to be an exit in here,' Draco declared with a sigh as he reached the back of the vault, peered behind a few piles and even dared to move a few things around. It wouldn't multiple, he knew, for he was a true Malfoy and therefore was allowed to touch the items the vault held. For now, at least. Ron and Hermione had carefully followed him, but Harry hadn't moved from his position by the door at all. 'Something wrong,' Draco asked.
'I'm fine standing,' Draco replied with his arms now crossed. Looking away from her again but feeling an invisible magnet slowly pulling his eyes back, Draco tried to concentrate on the small fountain he could see out the breakfast room's window.
'What's wrong?' Draco asked, trying to sound confused even though he knew Harry had hit him rather hard in the stomach.
Next up was Krum who took out a dragon with fine gold spikes around its face, blowing a bit of fire into the air. 'A Chinese Fireball,' Crouch declared and gave him the same wide-eyed look he had given Fleur. Krum only clenched his jaw and stared at Karakov whom didn't seem to react to the dragons at all. Diggory got a Swedish Short-Snout and seemed to be the only one surprised by the dragons; perhaps nobody had told him the first task had any involved. But hadn't he heard the boy's father whisper about dragons to him earlier? Perhaps the sudden look of one had just frightened the boy.
Draco sighed deeply and took another look around; spotted the smiling faces of most of Harry's friends — besides from sulking Hermione of course — and decided that perhaps it wasn't that bad of an idea to cheer them up a bit after the battle. '
“After you,” Harry said, voice quiet. Draco stepped in a breath later, and Harry followed, keeping a few moments’ worth of space between them. After a step or two into the room, Draco paused, and Harry swung the door closed behind them.
“—And it has been incredible to get to live together, especially someplace so close to work for me, and it’s so easy to see you when you’re home," Hermione added, the lines of anxiety on her face becoming more pronounced. “But.”
The following Monday, Harry stopped by Robards’ office to let him know that yes, he would go to the conference. He sat at his desk after that to finish the last of his outstanding reports. Watching the files go down, closer and closer to the desk’s surface, felt like a countdown. Once he finished, he could see the faded wood of his desk for the first time in years, could almost make out his reflection in the veneer, after a quick clean. Ready for a new occupant level of clean. His gaze averted quickly, only to fall on the bottom shelf of his file cabinet. The pile of Malfoy’s unread memos seemed to pulse.
They reached for their drinks at the same time, sitting in silence for a while. The apartment felt small. The couch seemed too worn, like the cushions needed to be replaced. How he thought coming home would be easier, he wasn’t sure. So Gin had been a good sister. Who did that leave for Hermione?
Something circled his wrist. He forced an eye open. The light coming from the main house had turned a darker shade and formed into undulating shapes. Coiling tendrils extended out, reaching through the other buildings to pull out furniture, ropes, hides, and knives and draw them into the central house. And one such tendril had taken Draco’s arm and begun to pull.
Harry couldn’t argue with that. Draco continued: “International cooperation is really where everything’s headed. It makes sense to send the stronger Aurors overseas.”
After another half hour of walking, the group Apparated back to their hotels to clean up and meet again for dinner. They’d joined up with Dave, Vickie, and a few other Americans for some spectacular burgers, followed by enormous biscuits from a tiny shop (“Hot Cookie”) that sold even tinier pants.
“Mm,” she said. “It has led to some good rows. But some good makeup sex, too, so I think it balances out.”
“Er, I suppose so.” Harry often shared rooms with several other people on his missions. He hadn’t felt body conscious in ages. A faint colouring was setting in on Malfoy’s cheekbones, different from the embarrassed flush at the portkey terminal.
“You still don’t have to share.” Harry shifted in place. A part of him was curious, but England was a few hours away now. The List. Spain too. Maybe Draco
“Do you mind saving us seats?” Malfoy withdrew his arm so that only his face remained visible around the door. “I’m almost ready, but the first session starts in ten minutes. No reason for us both to be late.”
“Do you?” A playful tone was edging into Harry’s voice, as one hand explored along the full inside of Draco’s collar: left, then right. “Let’s hear it.”
The tendril gave a final, violent tug, and the door frame shattered. Draco flew forward toward the circle and the dark.
): permanently. He had the option now. At the end of his last mission, when the Spanish Minister had called him for a private meeting in her office, Harry had worried he’d missed something (or worse, his recent captives had escaped). Instead, Minister Salas had offered him a seat and asked him questions. About his family and his hobbies. How much time he spent abroad. What his aspirations were. And at the end of it, she made her offer: “Come work for me. Things are changing. We need younger, open-minded leadership. Someone collaborative and experienced. International Operations are only going to become more important. And to be frank with you, Auror Potter, you sound like you are more than half out the door of England already. Your leadership is stuffed with old men that will cling to their strongholds until they die. Don’t let them hold you back. You don’t have to answer now. I can’t actually offer it to you anyway until you get your credits (and I would not accept that kind of last minute nonsense if you worked here, by the way). But get the credits and let me know. We’ll go through the formal process, but it’ll be yours if you want it.”
Harry squinted a bit at that, feeling pleased that he couldn’t tell if Malfoy was digging him or the nudists. “You have to be used to it, after school. Quidditch. Even the loos.” Harry paused to drop into the sand and pick up a few pieces of shell that caught his eye. The beach felt cool through his jeans. “After a while, bits are bits, y’know.”
“I think she likes having young people around. I took the place because it was the closest to the law library. And I’ve meant to move since I got the shop started, but just, haven’t bothered I suppose.”
“I was already running late! And then Parks would have left, and you’d have been all alone before I arrived.”
“Alright, Malfoy, I’ll buy those pants—one for Ron and a pair for myself—if you buy one of those chocolate covered willy biscuits right now and eat it.”
“Come on, stay, I can behave. Besides.” Her eyes took on a brighter gleam now, her displeasure edging away into a smile. “Don’t you want to know what’s actually been going on in the office, now that it’s just the two of us? I have at least twenty minutes before my next meeting.”
Harry woke around half past nine to an empty apartment. Only in England could he get away with sleeping in. Missions overseas by necessity ran on tight timing and coordination. The team had to be together, act together. And he looked forward to that work: as one of many instead of The One. After almost four months out, his Ministry desk likely had loads of paperwork waiting for him. Had to cover how those Magical European Union fees were being put to use, bless bureaucracy. Robards might have an unsolved set aside, though it was unlikely. Regardless, no one could rush Harry for all that.
The door creaked a little as he opened it. Harry passed him by, his head moving as he took in the room at an easy pace. The entrance opened into the cacophony of a room that was his study area, sitting room, and library all in one. Three-quarters of the walls were inlaid bookshelves full to bursting; that architectural feature alone had made him sign the lease. The rest of the wooden walls, the haphazard collection of furniture built for comfort more than appearance, were just necessities.
After an age, Draco unwound, leaning back until Harry understood he could turn over. Harry expected another closed expression, but Draco stared at him, face wet, his gaze steady.
Draco stilled at the caress of that familiar baritone. They both turned to see Harry standing beside them with several gift bags in hand, snow gathered in his dark mop of hair. Harry extended his right hand to Pansy. The outermost bag said
The humor faded from her eyes when she saw he was serious. “I mean, where would he sleep, if I took the bed?”
“I’ve brought you in to discuss Auror Malfoy, and I want you to think very hard about your answer before you respond. Two of our Aurors have come forward with some very serious accusations against him—bribery, harassment, false warrants—levels of interference I honestly find it difficult to imagine, from that desk we put him on. And I need to know if there was anything, of any scale, that gave you cause to question his character while the two of you were in San Francisco. Obviously you didn’t have eyes on him all the time, but any information you have could be helpful.”
“Harry,” Draco breathed, the longing and ache of it mirroring the press of want pulling Harry closer. His name sounded sacred, pure, in that tone of voice, an evocation. It sent his hands searching over warm, soft skin, burdened shoulders, narrow hips. He maneuvered them to the right, stopping when he felt Draco’s hips hit the bathroom counter. The jostling separated them briefly, and Harry spared no time shifting to trace the salt-lined trail down one cheek, then the other, sliding a thigh deep between Draco’s to press closer, the contact not enough. He wanted, Merlin, he wanted. When he moved forward to kiss Draco again, Draco kissed back, a brief brush, a second deeper draw, before his hands curled up around Harry’s shoulders to stop him. His eyes were closed when Harry looked at him, the corners tight with strain.
The Incarcerous struck him from behind. His wheels spun out beneath him from the impact of the ropes, and he fell face first into the sand. It filled his nose and mouth, dry and too hot from the sun. Disgusting.
Hermione took a careful bite of another churro before making a show of picking up the crumbs. “Well, I just had the thought that if you’re up for it, and won’t have much else going on, you might be willing to help with a bake sale for the Department tomorrow. We’re raising funds for doxies—”
Draco focused very close on a crease in a pair of his trousers. “You’re being compared to the likes of Jenkins and Flemings. It’s not a very competitive pool.”
Draco nodded. “After the… everything, he reached out to Theo about coming to the States and working for him. He has a delivery service based out here and a few other big cities. Ones where the animal labour issue is more of a thing, I guess.”
Potter sat too close, with his back against the nearest wall. The ink had cleared from his skin. Now, he just looked tired.
“I’m not sure what is making you force me to have this conversation, Potter, but I am perfectly capable of casting a Lumos sufficient for night time use. Thanks for your permission to use the lights, though.”
Draco approached, leaving some distance between them once he stopped. The apple fully peeled, Potter pulled it from the air and took a bite. Then he looked at Draco.
“You were right.” Harry crossed his arms, looking at that day’s combination of baby blue jumper and darker blue slacks. “About that tip. The Muggle tube connection was very helpful.”
“Checks out,” he said, after a fashion. “But when someone’s flagged, we’ve still gotta ask ‘em some questions first. Check for Dark residue, ill intent, and what not.”
He turned his attention back to the passing water and trees beside them. “It’d be a lot steadier, that’s for sure.”
Draco pointedly stared at the paper, waiting to answer. The hint eventually sank in and Potter scrawled something (hopefully his name) at the bottom. Draco caught the paper and quill as they returned to him. “Theo’s uncle,” he said.
Harry groaned into his pillow the next morning, the back of this throat aching and sour. He flicked his hand at the blaring alarm, and the small machine flew against the wall, then shattered. For a few golden moments, the room was silent save the hum of the AC unit. He enjoyed it before his mind so helpfully reminded him the final set of sessions was this morning.
“I can shake off the Imperius,” Harry said, voice low because if he didn’t hold it together, he was going to shout himself raw. “But no, I haven’t been to the Healer.”
Harry fought to arrange his bags on the floor. “Because you’re a grumpy sod when you’re working. I remember stopping by ‘Mione’s office at the wrong time, back in the day. And what's a yuppie?”
“Now see, that’s what happens when they’re thinking with the wrong head.” Flemings tapped his own oversized head for emphasis. Harry didn’t acknowledge the point, trying to sort out which of his expense reports were ready to pass into the outgoing box and which still needed revision.
“And trips overseas, it seems.” That got his attention. Harry got a glimpse of those grey eyes turned lavender in the right light, before they narrowed to sharp points.
“You’re early.” She put her book down and looked him over, then added: “Will tea be enough for you, or shall I make something stronger?”
Harry finished his mug. “I’m not sure. We finally off one another? Or we just… don’t speak for five days? Can’t really tell which of those is the better outcome.”
“As if anyone else would work with that tripe.” Jenkins had joined in now. “Or the information he gets.” This caused another round of laughs.
Hermione laughed and brushed her hair back, though she sounded apologetic as she added that “the colour wasn’t really right for the room, Harry.”
Harry looked over the pans and pots covering every burner on the stove. Ron must’ve bought some more because Harry doubted he even owned that many pans.
Harry blinked at that, his head beginning to turn from side to side. “It’s the deal the Ministry made with your family. We make them all the time.”
He came back to himself in his flat’s kitchen, hand already in the middle of an unsteady pour of firewhiskey, the package back in his deliveries box. He put the bottle down. It wasn’t good, that place. Not good at all.
Casting a notice-me-not charm before he moved, Harry walked back out of the hotel and doubled-back toward a coffee shop he’d passed by. He’d get some tea there, then head back in. Hopefully Malfoy would be back in the room by then. Harry didn’t need any more revelations today.
A dark haired figure stepped through the door. Draco leaned to get a better look, grip tightening on the edge of the bar. Pansy Parkinson strode through the entrance and made her way over to him.
“Whatever packs more punch,” Harry said, wiping his mouth with his hand. Disgusted—Draco should be disgusted, not amused. “It’s about quality more than quantity nowadays.”
“No, but refusing to help in any of my projects,” Hermione said, crumbs forgotten to wave her churro at him, “is putting you well on your way.”
“Please.” Pansy reached out to adjust Draco’s tie and fringe. "I prefer to call it artful ravishing. Full of youthful vigour that one. Don’t frown like that, darling, you’ll get wrinkles, and then you won’t be alone just because you’re a wilfully blind arse.”
He glanced again at the restaurant entrance. The angle wasn’t ideal from his cordoned off spot at the far end of the bar. He could just make out the door through the gaps in the liquor shelves. He needed to be diligent if he wanted time to brace for Harry’s arrival.
“Technically, it was the good people of this country that solved them.” Harry dug around his wilted salad for croutons and the lone tomato it came with. “He just picked out the right tips.”
. His office was as charming as he was. He took some of the biscuits from her plate when his cutting look had no clear effect. She raised her eyebrows at that, but said nothing.
Harry stopped struggling, the curl in his mouth softening from its mild irritation into some kind of frustrated amusement. Draco could feel the warmth of Harry’s hand where it settled near Draco’s ribs. If he took a big enough breath, he could press back against it. Seek it.
Harry curled his toes to avoid the urge to press further into that wandering hand. “I’m more of a head first kind of guy.”
The mailbox stood a few feet behind him. The metal that remained shone silver in spotted clusters. Whatever name it used to bear had disappeared under a series of carved slashes. An unmarked cross leaned against the wooden base, and two smaller crosses lay half buried in the sand. His fingertips brushed over the scratch marks. They ran deeper than they looked.
“So, you’re from England, right? The Ministry, or something?” Dave took out each item from his lunch box and set them out in front of him before he began to dig in. Harry watched the deliberate movements, then caught up that he’d been asked a question.
“Oh yes, thanks for that by the way—not taking it.” They’d technically purchased the bed together, so she could have staked a claim. “I would have come today just to murder you.”
The piece detailed Jenkins’s and Flemings’s wrongdoing over the years. It couldn’t capture all of them. A newly opened investigation by Internal Affairs was conducting a thorough review of every case the pair of them had worked, including all those involving the prosecutor that had helped them. But it captured everything Malfoy’d summarised, Harry’s own bits from the years, as well as some of the older cases Harry’d remembered from further back. Harry played a central role in the narrative the Prophet put together, but he made sure they addressed how none of it could have come to life without the extensive and selfless efforts of Draco Malfoy.
Except for Malfoy’s desk. Harry stilled. The blond had probably gone to lunch. He usually went around this time.
Hermione chewed on one of the churros, considering. She’d stretched out on the couch near them to observe. “Mm, nothing terribly eventful. Work is—” She paused to look at Ron, who offered “Same old Ministry bollocks wasting your time?” before she looked back at Harry and shrugged, giving him a look this time before focusing back on her food. “—Work. Nothing of interest there.”
Draco picked over his dinner, another day of deliveries behind him. Someone would value knowledge of Potter’s whereabouts pretty highly. Moreso if Draco hinted at what the man was up to. The Saviour dabbling with dark arts in the desert? It had a lingering appeal, to bring Potter down a little. Except no one would believe Draco Malfoy. And if they did, they wouldn’t pay him for it. So Draco washed up the dishes, his forearm covered and damp, and went to bed.
Harry waved his hand and the curtains from the windows slowly drew to the side, letting in light from the cloudless night outside. In the lighting, Draco looked otherworldly, his skin fair but flushed against the other earth tones of his surroundings. His eyes were closed, shut tight below his drawn brows. Harry let his hands fall down to his sides.
"Well, you’re getting better." Ron stood and stretched wide. He gave Harry a firm clap around the shoulders before heading toward the master bedroom. "Glad we’ll have you around for a while.”
“Exactly.” She tossed her straw aside and took a sip from the pitcher’s side. “Then he'll either think my job isn't that big a deal by comparison, or can be mad at the both of us, and where would that leave him? He can’t toss us both.” She nodded at this wisdom. “Now drink up. I’ve still got a lot of this mix left, and the night is young. We can bother fresh starting in the morning.”
“Maybe you should get some of these for the Weasel,” Malfoy said, pointing to the red and white stripes. They’d had a few drinks with dinner, and there was a flush in his skin and glow in his eyes that aged his appearance down a good five years. “They’d go quite well with his hair.”
Later, waiting for Hermione to sit with him in the canteen, Harry averted his eyes as some of the junior Aurors walked by Malfoy, seated a few tables away, and knocked his tray to the ground. Harry counted to four before glancing back. For the next several seconds, Malfoy just sat there, his fringe too long and loose, hanging over his eyes. Harry reached up slowly for the strands of black hair brushing the tops of his glasses. He needed a haircut, too.
Harry’d turned back to watch the children flying rounds. He took a deep, steadying breath. “Er, dunno. Sounds... difficult. I’m sure you’ll work it out.”
“Now who’s the prude?” Malfoy followed his question with a self-satisfied smirk. That look Harry’d seen many times. And could work with.
“Ugh, that’s right. Draco said that yesterday, but I am shit at names.” Harry blinked at the casual use of Malfoy’s name. Dave opened his side dish of some sort of potato mash. “Kind of funny how it abbreviates to ‘Mom,’ isn’t it? Can’t tell if that’s better or worse than ‘MACUSA.’” Dave hummed around a spoonful of the mash. “‘Mom’ is a lot friendlier.”
The following mornings, he’d stare at the Ministry package and consider delivering it to Potter anyway. Had he moved already? Gotten some rest? Would the Deniden be there, warning Draco to stay away? Then the tea would kick in, and he’d return the package to sender.
“Right.” Draco forced his attention away from his undressing to look up at the ceiling. Only Harry seemingly took the stretch of his neck as an invitation to trace the line of his pulse with his tongue. Draco stuttered as spoke: “So the theory is, one person is… is only entitled to,
“Harry, I’m so glad you’re home.” She opened her arms and he mirrored her immediately, pulling her close the moment she stepped up to him. He welcomed her familiar warmth, the calming patchouli scent she always had. He squeezed her tighter. As she cried into his shoulder, he looked around the room. The place was spotless, save a large half-full pitcher of some kind of purple drink. Some things were newly organized. Whatever it was, it had happened a few days ago. Hermione always scoured the condo when she was upset.
They entered the Great Hall, and were greeted with a mix of hesitant smiles and the sound of weeping. He could see a few of the Weasleys hunched over two bodies; lifeless like the body of the small boy. As he neared, his heart almost stopped beating. Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks had peaceful expressions on their faces —
When those words left his lips, Voldemort's soul finally left his body — floated away from it like smoke and took shape as his usual form again. Feeling exhausted and drained from it all, he looked up at the monster, noticed how Dumbledore pointing his wand at Voldemort again. 'Now, Draco,' the old man said — nearly demanded, and Harry felt Draco drag him a bit away, tighten his grip around Harry's hand.
Following the man into a deserted classroom nearby, Draco seated himself on one of the wooden chairs. The headmaster himself leaned against the desk at the front, observing a skeleton of a bird that was placed upon it. 'Has it to do—,' Draco started.
A stone, perhaps even a boulder, weighing a ton hit Draco in his imagination at hearing those words.
soul in it — and Draco fought it, destroyed it,' she explained, making the boy clench his jaw and cast his eyes away.
Draco just laughed and shook his head. 'Of course not. Being a student at Hogwarts isn't the greatest thing ever this year anyway; the Ministry is involving itself with their education,' he told them. The twins gave each other an interested glance to then return their eyes to Draco, eager to hear more. Why were Beauxbatons students always so keen on hearing gossip? 'I'll tell you more about it on our way to breakfast;
Draco sighed. He wasn’t in the mood to be arguing with a portrait in the middle of the night. ‘Please, it’s important!’
‘I thought it was a simple spell?’ Draco asks him, hands behind is back and grey eyes pointed at Potter’s clumsy balancing.
, it's just different years together. The only rule is that boys and girls are separated,' Draco explained. '
'Shall we go upstairs?' he asks Potter after a minute of silence. A nod follows and together they walk up the stairs, Potter remembering the way perfectly. Is it an Auror thing? Who knows.
'You mean he's suffering from that Dark Mark curse?' Ron asks and Harry replies with a firm nod. 'B-but I didn't see anything; only a faded Dark Mark on the git's pale arm.'
?' Draco then asked the curly-haired girl. His words made her blush, which meant she could understand French at least a little.
Draco nods. He could believe that; the Weasel girl had always been very good at playing Quidditch. There was not a single thing wrong with her technique and growing up with so many brothers probably made her a tough woman. And yes, Draco had also always known Potter would end up being an Auror; it was only natural for him to do so, saving the world until he would collapse under its weight. Yet Potter would've made a very good teacher at Hogwarts as well if he must believe all the stories from that Dumbledore Army back in fifth year.
Draco waved his words away and took ahold of his broom more steadily. 'Not to worry, Harry — they'll follow along.' And he took off, shooting up towards the sky as if he was a professional Quidditch player. Harry grinned as he took off as well, quickly caught up with Draco and looked down upon the roofs of Little Whinging's houses. Black squares, all the same. Tiny specks of light, almost like Christmas decorations. The wind blew in his face, a cold wind that he had missed ever since the start of summer.
Chaos had broken loose once again, and it appeared as if only more chaos would follow in the days to come. Having just apparated away from the wedding, Harry was catching for breath as Hermione pulled both him and Ron along the streets of London. 'We must change,' she announced as she hurried them all into a little alleyway.
Draco gave Harry his own drink, a green one that tasted like apples. The boy grinned as he took Draco's glass and tasted the sweet apple flavor. ‘And Hagrid? You told me about him delivering your Hogwarts letter, but you never told me what he was like,' Draco asked him in return.
Taking a sip of his hot tea, after stirring three sugar cubes through the herbal mixture, he takes in Potter's reaction with a satisfied look in his eyes. As to why he feels so satisfied, he doesn't know. Maybe because he outsmarted his plan? But wasn't the plan to help Draco in the first place? Everything is so hard to figure out nowadays…
Ron frowned his eyebrows and quickly looked at Hermione over his shoulder. 'You can't use magic outside of school! You're a minor just like us,' he declared.
‘Sirius!' Harry called out, hugging the man he had missed so much. It felt amazing to finally be reunited again with the people he loved so dearly. All those boring summer days he had to spent with the Dursleys last month hadn't been for nothing.
A little angst and shouting at each other never hurt anyone, did it? And it wasn't for long because they love each other too much (obviously).
The jailer nods. ”Died only a few hours ago, that piece of dark wizard. That Unspeakable already arrived only a few minutes after we reported it to the Ministry. Took the body with him immediately and everything. Seemed scared, the fellow.”
Slowly but surely, Harry's face turned the shade of a tomato. "Y-you can read my mind?" A nod of his head followed. "Have you been reading it the entire time?" Another nod. "W-why?"
'I should've gone with you,' Ron then admitted, and everyone grew quiet again. Draco looked from Ron to Hermione; to catch her reaction to his words. All he saw was that she was getting as red as a tomato, slowly hiding herself behind her curly hair.
'You know; those boys from Durmstrang. Northern beasts, that they are.' With her question answered, Draco lifted his hand as a kind of good-bye and strode back to Fleur and her friends. They were talking with some Hogwarts students, including the boy with the yellow scarf that had put himself up as a candidate earlier. As he nearly reached their small group, he suddenly felt a tick on his shoulder. He turned around and got surprised by Harry Potter's face; his green eyes looking blue so close to the light of the Goblet.
,' he answered, letting out a long breath before collapsing into Ansel's arms. 'Hold me for I can no longer stand of exhaustion.'
. It was something he had already told Harry about in fourth year — and now it seemed like he was going to have to face his fear.
They stayed at Beauxbatons for another week; Draco showing Harry every little corner of the chateau and spending endless hours in his room with him. It almost felt like the year before where they had all the time in the world and had spent hours in each other's arms as well — just whispering stories and feeling each other's presence. But now two dark shadows were looming over their heads; that of the Dark Lord and that of Draco's father. Of course the man had come looking for him only a few days after the battle; demanding Madame to see his son. And oh how the poor woman had had to lie — use all of her pokerfaces to keep one of her favorite students safe from the pale claws of his father. Draco had hid himself away in the secret room together with Harry — cried for hours as he waited for the moment to arrive where his father would burst through the door — drag him back to the cold Manor by what was left of his silver hair.
Pibbly's standing in front of Draco’s wardrobe, looking down at her feet while waiting for Draco to notice her presence. “Pibbly is here to tell master Malfoy that there are two Aurors sirs here to see master Malfoy. They’re waiting in the tea room, sir,” the house elf announces. She shuffles a bit with her feet, eyes still pointed at Draco's mahogany floor. She seems to be a bit nervous, and Draco considers asking her what’s bothering her.
The blond's eyes search for something to focus themselves on, finding Harry's tea cup the perfect item for the job. It feels like Malfoy's staring holes through the china, the tea ready to seep out of its cup any second now. But nothing happens, of course. Harry's tea stays where it's supposed to be and Malfoy's eyes wander of to his own tea cup after a while.
'Everyone's afraid,' Hermione whispered back — Hermione that had now transfigured into Bellatrix Lestrange, a woman all four of them despised.
"It shall be better if you do not look, Harry," the boy then said, having found energy to speak again — his voice so calm compared to the current situation.
The locket around his neck seemed to whisper terrible dreams into his ears — making him wake at least three times a night with drops of sweat running down his face. He couldn't take the locket off.
Finally more inspiration to finish this chapter! I feel like I finally know where to go with the Half-Blood prince part. I don't have much to say about this chapter, actually, but let's point out a few things if they're perhaps not very clear.
'It's — it's okay, Draco,' the boy told him, green eyes blinking a few times before he sat up straight again. 'You told me to stop and yet I- I touched you like that. I'm the one that should be sorry because of it.'
'I want to say something cheesy but I won't say it because it's cheesy,' Draco then said, already grinning at himself for even having the thought.
It seemed to pain Hermione as she took a step back, looked at Ron in a worrying manner. 'It's not like we didn't want to, mate; they forbid us,' Ron explained. 'It's the Order that told us not to tell you anything.'
As they passed Hogsmeade station, Harry finally lifted his head to look at Draco. 'I still don't get
In class he kept himself quiet, only answering a few questions as he hopefully awaited for the last bell to ring. And when it rang, the boy ran outside as fast as he could, forever one of the first ones to leave the school grounds.
In less than a second his nephew's face turned as red as a balloon, ready to burst. "You—" he started, pointing his chubby, equally red index finger in Harry's direction, but before he could finish his sentence, another heavy figure appeared behind him.
'If he was French,' Draco started. 'He would've written all these scribbles in French as well — not in English.
Draco thought to himself. How could he, Harry Potter, ever fall for another boy? It was clear as day that the boy was straight... wasn’t it? Yet all Draco's mind could think about was how the boy had called him wonderful, had made his heart beat too fast and butterflies flutter in his stomach. And all those smiles that he had been given, all from him. The sparkles he had seen in the boy's green eyes whenever he was around Draco. Had they all just been out of friendship alone?
Dark eyes switched from his father to Harry, to stare deeply into his greens again. His mood seemed to change, as if rain was making way for sunshine. 'I'm fine,' he answered with a little smile. 'Shall we leave now?'
Go kiss that Ravenclaw captain of yours,' Draco said to her, arms crossed and eyebrows frown. But Fleur ignored his words, wrapped her arms around him as well. She said something to Draco in French, making the boy smile and then took off to join her little sister again.
‘Let’s meet the day after tomorrow by the lake. I’ll tell you everything I know about the Merpeople,’ Draco told him.
'Because they were battling against Voldemort, Dolores,' Dumbledore simply explained before he took another bite of his waffles — not caring about the tiny, angry lady in front of him.
do you hide his secrets?' Harry's poking finger had returned and this time Draco didn't push his hand away but took it in his. If anger wasn't helping, then maybe love could.
'Look at that,' Voldemort then said. 'Dumbledore has come to help you, Harry. And he brought Lucius his son — I've always wanted to meet you, Draco. Have you considered joining my Death Eaters as well?'
His mother's words twirled around in Draco's head and confused him. Those words made it sound like the mother he knew again — but with an undertone of his father. 'We can make up for that mistake in a good way; in the
With a lot of effort they crawled into the portrait's hole, Draco behind again. Before he closed the portrait, he took another look at the door; saw how it was opened the tiniest bit. An eye colored a pale blue was staring in his direction from the darkness. 'Thank you,' Draco whispered to it, before closing the portrait and following the others.
'What were you reading?' Draco asked, swiftly letting his eyes go from Hermione to her book and back.
'It's a helpless cause for now,' Arthur admitted with a sigh. 'We'll try our best to fix it once the fire's out.'
He put on a little smile. 'He used to belong to our family when I was only a little boy — but when I went to Beauxbatons for my first year, my parents found it unnecessary to keep a third house-elf at the Manor,' Draco explained. 'An uncle of mine, whom lived not too far away, was in the need of a new house-elf and that's where Dobby went to. But then—,' Draco stopped for a second to look at Harry with a little smile. '—a certain wizard named Harry Potter set the elf free only a year later, which led to our uncle being furious with us. He wanted a replacement, which we provided him with, and
‘I’m not talking about her dress! I’m talking about her being Krum’s date!’ he spat out. The boy's hands were balled into fists and it was quite the sight.
There were enough friends, other students and professors that would help him with that task though, and while they prepared for what would be the second Wizarding War; Draco and Harry had ran off to the seventh floor to go find the diadem they needed in order to end the new War as soon as possible.
. What if I do anything wrong and I get possessed by it again?' Worry was readable in his eyes, a worry Harry apparently saw as well.
At least, I believe she is, as long as you’re on her good side,' Draco replied. He had always been on Madame's good side, beside from their little argument a month ago when he went out to Hogsmeade with Harry without informing the girls. He had then found out what it was like to be on her bad side; evil glares and tummy aches.
But her thought was wrong; as she hit it with the sword, she was blasted backwards as if hit by the most awful curse. She was launched at least ten feet in the air, and hit the ground rather hard. 'Hermione!' Ron called after her, storming in her direction with Harry and Draco on his heels.
He clutched Draco to his body with dear life and moved his feet faster than he had ever done before. He could hear the Merpeople scream at him from behind as he grabbed ahold of the girl's wrist and pulled her with him as well. It was utterly exhausting and his leg muscles were burning after seconds already. He was nearing the surface, getting closer to daylight again, when a slimy hand slid itself around his ankle. He looked down to stare into the furious face of one of the Merpeople. Without hesitation he let go of the girl's wrist after giving her a bit of launch upwards; making her move through the water a bit faster. He then grabbed his wand again and blasted hexes towards the Merpeople that had gathered around him. It was an intense battle and he got stabbed by their pointy tridents multiple times. But eventually he won by casting a bright lumos, blinding the Merpeople for just long enough to get the hell away from them.
A pale blue carriage with winged horses was eagerly waiting by the chateau's entrance; ready to bring the students of Beauxbatons to a different location. As big as a house, the carriage was and as large as elephants the horses were. Draco felt intimidated by its size but encouraged at the same time. Madame Maxime stood by one of the horses, making the giant creature look a little smaller. André and Ansel said their last goodbyes to Draco before disappearing into the chateau again, waving their hands over-dramatically.
But Harry just couldn't leave it alone, he had to see the bloody corpse even if it meant losing his job. Being an Auror hadn't been what he expected it to be in the first place, anyway; it had become rather boring over the past five years and maybe he would even be glad if he lost the damn job. Ron on the other hand didn't feel the same way; he had a family to take care of and didn't want to lose his job at any cost. Understanding and respecting his best friend's opinion, Harry decided to be more careful but also stay as determined as before.
'Well, you seemed quite mad at me because I didn't tell you that I saw the dragons before you told me that you saw the dragons and that I should have seen them but that I already saw them and-'
Draco lifted his gaze again, and this time his eyes were a bright white again — like the first time Harry'd seen them. Immediately the overwhelming feeling washed over him once more; intensely and entirely different than before. He could
A loud knock on the door and Harry was shook out of his thoughts. A few hours had passed and it was already late in the afternoon; the sky starting to turn darker by the second and the Dursleys their old home becoming more and more deserted. He had moved all his stuff to the living room and had been waiting on his trunk — the only decent piece in the room to sit on — with a book at hand which Draco had lent him in fourth year. It was entirely written in French and even though Harry still couldn't understand most of it — some things he could, and it warmed his heart in knowing it brought him closer to his beloved one.
Draco handed out his other presents as well, including a book about Beauxbatons' castle for Hermione and a box of French candy for Ron — which had made the ginger-haired boy smile at him for the first time since Draco could remember. That alone was a success already and the star atop of his Christmas tree that year.
As they stood there, thinking and waiting for the right moment to go — shouting of voices filled the silence. They were here. They had discovered there were intruders. Draco's heart skipped a beat. He didn't want to get caught. He didn't want to be brought to Azkaban — or
'Where did you hide him?' Ginny asked, glancing around the hallway as if the secret hiding place would suddenly doom up in front of her eyes.
A world slowly took shape around him, from a blurry image to the strokes of an impressionist his painting to clear reality. He was outside, had landed next to a tree he had sat many times before with his friends — a tree close to the Lake with the best view on the school's squid. Only this time a little boy no older than eleven was seated against its trunk, reading a book on Potions. His black, greasy hair made Harry immediately recognize him as a younger version of Snape.
More girls from Beauxbatons rose from their seats, the ever so quiet ones now making a fuss of their own as well, defending the one that always defended them. Gryffindors backed Harry up as well, started shouting things they didn't mean which resulted in the girls shouting things as well. A mix of French and English yelling filled the Great Hall in less than a minute. A voice, sounding like that of Ron, then declared to everyone that Draco's father was a Death Eater. The crowd went silent for just a second before continuing their verbal attack, louder and more vile this time around.
' he asked Harry in whispers. Glancing over his shoulder, but of course not seeing Harry at all, Draco hoped to radiate a certain worry over to him.
His heart sank to the bottom of his shoes when he saw Malfoy collapse after a spell he casted. Was it his fault? Did he do this to him? The curse turned another part of Malfoy's white body black, leaving nothing but more tears behind. And Harry's hand, going through Draco's soft hair. It had always looked so soft but touching it was another thing; it was a reassuring thing. It made Draco cry and Harry himself struggle against a few tears himself. Why was it that he couldn't help this man more? He wanted to help Malfoy. He wanted to help
It had been a deal he had made with Raphael; to let no-one else enter his room once he would return from his so-called morning walk, and pretend that Draco was in there alone. Raphael had found the whole secret mission rather exciting, but had been disappointed to hear that the smuggled person would be hidden underneath an invisibility cloak.
He then felt a hand on his shoulder. 'Calm down, Harry. I'm sure they'll tell you soon enough,' Draco told him.
'Did you know,' Fleur suddenly said to Draco. 'That the Champions have to open the Ball with a dance?' She looked into his eyes and put on a smile that could hold many different meanings.
, Draco thought to himself. He was ready to let the sword go down; the blade slice the locket in two, if that was even possible — but a dark cloud like spilled ink rose from the inside, together with whispers that were no longer said in parseltongue. '
Hurrying behind Harry, the pink woman in question appeared more clearly to them as well; she had the same stumpy and short figure as Umbridge and the same hairdo. A large bow bounced on her head as she made her way through the shopping crowd, bumping against people's shoulders without apologizing. In silence Draco and Harry kept trailing behind her, not even having to take the effort to hide as Umbridge only seemed to be focus on her goal — on wherever she was going.
'Terrible,' he answered. 'I kept feeling his eyes staring at me — felt how he was still awake and waiting for me to fall asleep. I don't know why I had that feeling, but it kept me up all night.'
'For what?' Draco replied, a slight smirk on his face as he took Harry's hand in his. 'I must inform Madame Maxime about my return — and about recent events,' he then said. She did perhaps know that headmaster Dumbledore had been staying in her school for the last month; but she probably had no idea that he had taken one of her students into a battle against the Dark Lord — and that this student brought Harry Potter and his friends back to her school with him.
