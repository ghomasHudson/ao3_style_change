Draco glances at Theo, who's staring at him with an indescribable expression. "Yes, an old friend of mine just returned to London," he says.
"Ready for what?" Harry asks. If anything, he looks even more unhappy.
"Who?" Theo says, voice dangerously near.
"Yes," Theo agrees. Then more softly, he says, "You were beautiful the day I last saw you. This is.. you look more
“Oh, of course I did.” Then after a while, “Why?”
Draco blinks open, eyes immediately staring at the dark ceiling of his room. He turns his head to see the clock glaring back at him with the number eight. He turns the other way to see there is no sunlight escaping from his dark curtains.
Draco looks at him; a sudden exciting, fluttering feeling he stomps down in his stomach. It almost feels like the missing feeling when he first saw Theo that day.
"Do you like it?" He asks.
Lily gives a small smile. "Hi."
Albus, in a moment of rarity, reaches for her hand. Then she feels a movement from her other side, though she refuses to turn if it was Scorpius' disappointed face looking at her.
“I want to learn how to love you properly,” he says. “Because I am, have always been for a long time already, in love with you.”

"Did you only wake up just now?" She asks. "Have you finally fallen ill? Wait for me, I'll go to you right now."
"Deal." She replies with a genuine smile of her own.
with hurried but controlled steps towards his flat.
Draco blinks, though he quickly answers in the next beat. "I did."
"Okay, I'm ready," Ron says, already pouring himself a second glass.
"It's your name, you prat."
in his arms? Definitely not his worst decision.
Harry very nearly drops his phone as he snaps his neck towards the voice. On his right, the back of his car, Draco stands with perfect posture looking at him questioningly. He’s wearing a black turtleneck and slacks, also black oxfords and a slightly lighter shade coat. He’s looking exactly as Harry imagined him to be on a casual day - how Draco prefers his ‘casual wear’ when he’s not working. His platinum hair falls artfully over his forehead, blown by the cold wind, and he’s not wearing glasses. He looks effortlessly, utterly beautiful. It’s unfair.
"'S okay," Draco says. "How do you feel?"
"Quite a person, he is." Harry says.
“Don’t get any ideas, please,” Scorpius grimaces.
"You didn't tell me?" Albus says, looking up. Rose gently pry the photo from his hand and Hugo scrambles to her side.
Harry's eyes are kind, his lips set to a small, comforting smile. He seems put together, better than he had been yesterday. Lily nods. “Well, we weren’t particularly fond of each other during our school years.” His eyes start to fog, as if he’s reliving the memories as he speaks. “He was a snobbish prat. Typical spoiled pureblood kid. He didn’t like Ron and Hermione very much. so, we pretty much hated each other.”
"No, you're not a pity case." Draco's jaw is tight, and his clear grey eyes glares forcefully at the opened page. Harry realises it’s red rimmed and-- shit,
Lily feels her blood run out of her face, and Albus has gone rigid beside her. Scorpius is holding her hand so tightly it hurts, but at the moment, she doesn't notice.
Then she hears Father shout something inside, and Scorpius wraps his arms around her. Daddy seems to be reasoning something. Sometimes Father gets really upset when she cries, and then Daddy would come to them and calmly give them warm hugs. Father always looked better afterwards, and she would already be smiling in her dad’s arms.
Harry huffs. “Well, yes.”
every part, every moment of it. Harry thinks he wants to do this for the rest of his life.
After a moment, Draco stands and walks carefully towards the wide window seat in the farther part of the room. He slumps down to the pillowed seat lightly, one hand still holding his wine glass and another loosely trailing over the window glass with his pointing finger.
The rest of the week follows by Harry insisting on driving Draco to and back from work. He keeps bringing him different flowers everyday - this morning, he’s given him a bouquet of white camellia. It's surprising when Draco doesn't say a word other than thanking him politely with this look in his eyes Harry can't quite figure out.
It is true. Lily looks back at the picture again, and her father smiles at her. Scorpius has the most similar colour of his blond hair, though Scorpius' is almost curly as their dad's while their father was only a little wavy. Also inheriting his grey eyes. Albus has their dad's dark hair and green eyes, though his hair is not as messy as Scorpius or Dad's.
"Come on, Lily Luna," James says. Then, the same time as she sees Harry place each of his hands on the twins' shoulders, James apparates them into the living room.
“But that’s mental!” Albus bursts out beside her. “He had a family. He had dad, his friends, he had us! Why would he-- why would, no. I don't understand.”
Lily steps behind him, taking notice of the sound of people talking. She realises it comes from somewhere near Scorpius as they sit down on the floor together, must be one of Uncle George's inventions and Scorpius disillusioned it.
Draco Malfoy is many things. He is smart, perceptive, diligent. It has not crossed Harry’s mind one bit that
“Harry..” Draco says, nearly inaudible. His eyes are painted in grief, and it is painful to look at.
apologies for the delay, i was unsure as to how to end the story and i am still not satisfied with this yet but here it is
. Draco very kindly does not point it out.
"You're so beautiful," Harry says, lips touching Draco's cheek. Draco is crying and lifts his free hand to the back of Harry's neck. He's never looked so beautiful as he'd been right then, utterly wrecked beneath Harry and his naked form glowing under the moonlight. "So lovely," he whispers to Draco's ear. "Come, and say my name, darling."
, Draco.” He says.
Lily pulls her face enough to see that Harry's face is expressionless, ordering James to wait for him in the kitchen. She stays long enough to see that Harry doesn’t say or do anything when Albus stomps out of the house before Scorpius pulls her completely away from their family.
Harry takes a step forward, their fronts almost meeting. Draco peers up a bit to look at Harry. Then he sighs, letting his arms fall into the pockets of his coat.
“I don’t know,” Draco says, a strange look flashes and goes away in an instant. “That place was for couples.”
As every time he goes to work with a hangover, Harry regrets drinking into oblivion deeply. He knows it won’t ever stop him though. His co-workers know to avoid him when he walks into the company dragging his feet while looking miserable, only nodding politely at him.
His car drives away. Draco turns to Harry, who's already looking at him.

." He says, Harry winces and mentally slaps his own face. "Have you always been really
Harry shakes his head sadly. "I asked. It's not the salary, not the hours, nor something I did. And he's not exactly a liar when struck with a chance to diss me."
“No.” Albus scowls. “From what I understand, you’re telling me that he was aware that he would leave us. That it was his decision to leave us.”
Draco sighs, a fond, pleased feeling swells through his heart at the sound of his childhood friend. He hasn't noticed how much he missed his friends until now.
Draco looks like he's contemplating, Harry sees the small hint of doubt in his eyes. So he says again, this time a little more gently. Because he understands that Draco doesn't see himself the way he sees him, just like Harry doesn't see himself the way Draco sees him.
Harry sighs and turns to his car, ready to march into Ron and Hermione’s house in defeat.
"Shit, Draco,
"I take it Malfoy didn't poison you, then?" He says.
Theo laughs. Theodore Nott is an attractive man, has endless charms - happiness on him would only amplify. And Draco imagines people from nearby tables taking a second glance at them.
"It's raining," Harry says, when he takes a seat on the other side.
"Work is fine, too," James offers, visibly confused as to why he's standing there as well.
"Dork."
Harry flicks his gaze up. "Hm?"
"Take pity on me and don't." Harry says fondly. He kisses Draco's head, rubbing his back with his free hand. "I love you so much that I'll tear the world to find you if you leave me."
"He looks just like him," the lady says, and stares at Scorpius who looks uncomfortable for another short moment, then to Albus. "This one's a copy of you," before sweeping her eyes to Lily. "Hello, dear."
‘Harry,’
Harry huffs, glancing at the sleeping three children on the sofa in the room, and sits on the side of Draco's bed. He softens, reaching a hand to push hair strands behind Draco's ear. "How do you feel?"
Draco blinks and looks down, but Harry doesn't seem like he's broken from any enchantment at all. Draco bites his lower lip. "I just think it was time to settle down."
"You look different." Theo says, mimicking his pose of resting his chin on his hand. "You don't use gel anymore?"
"I haven't called you," Draco says to him.
A hand covered with cold sweat touches his forehead, and sweeps his curls back. He looks up, still hovering on top of Draco, and this time he can see Draco's face clearly. His tear stricken cheeks, abused lips, his dark eyelashes.
"I won't," Harry promises, amused. "I love you so much."
"Blaise says he wants us to go on a trip to Italy," Draco says, turning to face Theo. They are currently standing in front of said restaurant, waiting for Theo's ride to pick him up. "Will you be coming?"
“Albus,” James scolds. though his voice is strained.
Harry and Ron quickly drain their second pint. Hermione rolls her eyes, still nursing her first. Ron pours the liquor to three smaller glasses, and Harry and he immediately takes the first shot.
“You said to me to marry him,” Harry answers.
Draco scowls. "What are you planning to do?"
. "But then he paid for my dinner, so."
bought black out curtains. It's just that he never really wakes up and stays to see if it actually worked.
Lily would think that Albus would be furious, and by the looks of it, Scorpius and the other two also expected it. Instead, Albus only sighs and gives a sad look at Scorpius.
Lily wakes up alone in her room, feeling awfully cold and terribly lonely. Memories of the earlier morning comes flowing back, and she feels drained even after a long nap. She takes a shaky breath, holding back the tears that’s threatening to fall. She feels oddly hollow, but she doesn’t know what exactly she should be feeling. Her eyes catch the box she and the twins had taken from her dad’s bedroom yesterday, and she moves slowly over to them. She opens the last book they had gone through yesterday; a scrapbook Harry seems to especially made for their father. It consists of candid pictures of Father mostly alone, some with his friends, but none with Harry. Starting from what must be their eight year in Hogwarts, their graduation, the courting Harry seems to insist from the messy scrawls below every picture, their wedding, their long honeymoon.
"Scorp?" she calls, refraining herself from reaching out.
He crowds Draco against the wall, holding his face with both hands as he tilts him upwards so he can kiss him deeper. He faintly thinks he’s hallucinating when he’s not even nearly as drunk as usual, because Draco’s legs are pressing against his hips and Draco’s hands’ placed upon his own like he’s encouraging Harry and trusting him to be in control.
She flips the photo to see a messy scrawl of handwriting on the back of it. It's Dad's, she realises.
. It does not stop Theo, however. They ended up ordering food not necessarily
Draco places his coat on the arm of his seat. He looks at him, confused. “Of course.”
“You betrayed them, in the end. I'm just saying you’re not that bad.” Then he sighs dramatically, “Merlin, Draco, just let me be your friend. Please.”
When Draco - because Harry decides one day he wants to call him by his given name - sits down at the table beside the big window of the library, dumping his bag to the seat beside him and all the books he had picked on a neat pile, Harry slumps into the other seat beside him.
“Albus, please stop.” Scorpius begs, and now Lily can hear the signs that he’s crying too.
Feeling bold as adrenaline comes pumping, Harry slowly moves closer. Draco is so still in his seat, unmoving. Harry keeps moving until he can feel Draco’s breath, and Draco is only staring at him with wide eyes. Harry flicks his gaze to Draco’s lips, pink and soft and inviting. He flickers back to look back at Draco, and freezes when he sees hopeful grey eyes. Something about them also seems sad and Harry doesn’t understand.
“Yes.” She turns back to James, whose expression is resolute. “You’ve always known, did you?”
"Yes, uh, good choice," Draco says. "Thank you."
She narrows her eyes at him. “You mean you got him into trouble and you’re here to hide.”
"Killed someone?" Albus jokes. "What? He said Father didn't turn out to be evil after all," he says, when lily nudges him with her elbow.
“Depression.” Albus repeats, in disbelief.
Slowly, he pulls away from the body in his arms, and looks down. Oh.
kinds of days, a signal of how many servings they want in the order of beer, then liquor.
But her steps pauses when she sees Scorpius standing beside the door of their parents’ room, she’d call him cheerfully if he hadn’t moved to put a hand over her mouth. She frowns, but Scorpius nods his head towards the slightly ajar door.
"I am an idiot," he announces.
"I need someone to poison me," Harry declares.
They haven't talked to Scorpius about the idea for when they get home. Lily nudges Albus with her heel, and after getting an annoyed glare, nods her head towards Scorpius who's in a conversation with Hugo.
Lily laughs, shoving his shoulder. "You're insufferable."
The thing is, they have never talked about their father out loud. At least, never straightforwardly. Their dad has always looked like he’s permanently grieving, even after seven years. so she had never asked him unless it was Harry's own decision to tell her a memory, afraid that he would break and shut himself alone again.
She thinks this is what it feels like to grieve properly.
Theo steps by the dark, awaiting car and opens the back seat. "Night, Mr. Potter. Pleasure meeting you." He says, then slinks inside without sparing a second.
“You don’t have to think of him every second of the day, Albus,” she says, patting her brother’s back gently. “I don't think he wants that for us.”
“Don’t hit your brother,” he says to James.
"I am not a pity case for you to--"
"Well, he didn't turn out to be actually evil," Lily says nervously, she tugs Scorpius' fingers that's resting on his knee. "Did he?"
Harry sleeps. Charming indeed.
“Oh, Harry,” he sighs, then grabs Harry’s arm and drags him into his flat.
He's absolutely not ready for this.
“No, I wasn’t--” he starts to say, then stops and doesn’t say anything else.
“Well,” Lily says, “what was he like?”
"Of course, darling," Harry says. "We'll be careful after this, okay?"
It’s convenient that Draco finally accepts his fate to Harry gaining the green card to annoy him anytime he wants. But Harry's mind is nowhere but his last train of thought. He doesn’t know why he’s suddenly taken aback when he knows that Draco has never looked not good. He'd heard girls, and sometimes even boys, appreciating Draco Malfoy’s good looks over the years.
Harry ignores them. "That's why he's been acting weird all day. He also said he'd find me a replacement and sort of train them so they can get used to my antics."
"Well?" James snaps when no one says anything.
"I woke up early and decided to walk to work, you see. And then I passed this florist just opening up their store for the day. The roses are very fresh, don't you think? Beautiful. So I thought that this would make your desk more… lively." Harry says - not rambles.
“I haven't thought of him since we left for Hogwarts,” he whispers brokenly. Lily doesn’t think she has ever seen Albus cry.
“Oh,” Draco says, a tiny furrow of eyebrows set. “It worked, then?”
Harry pulls away again, and Draco isn’t chasing him - he simply stays in his place with his eyes still closed. He opens them and blinks slowly, beautiful grey eyes finding Harry’s.
Harry sighs heavily then raises an arm, points a finger towards Ron.
Lily looks blankly at Scorpius, and he seems to don't know what to feel either.
“Why?” he repeats.
“I know,” Harry says, then sweeps his gaze from James, to Scorpius, to her, to Albus. “He loves all of you with every inch of his being, you have to know that. You’re everything he had ever wanted, everything we both wanted in our own ways. A family to love, a family that loves you.”
"Good morning!" He greets brightly.
, Harry?" Ron repeats.
"This is nice."
are my heart. You have become one with mine.” Harry says, words almost tumbling over each other.
"I have also scheduled the Golf meeting with Mr. Mahler next week."
Harry shakes his head. "No, I haven't."
"That's not at all confusing." Scorpius says.
stare at Draco’s arse and the way his body arches.
bad when I first started. Even I keep wondering how I manage to stay until now."
“Is it nice?”
That was a nightmare, she can tell, and that she’d just woken up. She’d find her father now, and cry to him about the dream. And then she would cry until Father kisses her and brings her to his and Daddy’s room, lay her in the middle of the bed, and Daddy would run his fingers through her hair as Father quietly sings a lullaby. She’d fall asleep, and she’d wake up the next day with kisses from both of her parents.
"Explain yourself, Scorpius Hyperion," Harry mutters, "That kid's going to be the most obnoxious of them all with a name like that."
His hand moves from where it rested on Draco's waist to touch his cheek, cold and smooth like porcelain. "You're very beautiful," he can't help saying, because it's true.
They're sitting on the carpeted floor in Draco's living room, leaning their backs on the sofa. Sitting very closely, nearly touching. A bottle of red wine opened on the coffee table in front of them already half empty.
Scorpius says, gently, "Let's go home."
"Oh, I really don't miss you at all." Draco sneers, though it quickly melts into a smile.
"How's school?" her dad asks, as soon as they arrive home. He shed his coat, walking to the kitchen as if he didn't really expect an answer.
"Potter!" Draco turns beet red. He shoves Harry and steps back. "You ought to learn a lesson or two about your honourable mouth."
"I'm honored." Draco replies, huffing. His gaze flicks down to Theo's loose tie, and before he realises, he's already reaching out to grab them.
“Lily Luna? Sorry, was that insensitive?”
"I prefer charming."
"Sorry," Harry says.
"School is fine." Scorpius says. Harry almost jumps at his voice, and turns around from the sink. He seems to be surprised and confused seeing the four of his children standing beside each other on the kitchen door.
"Of course," Harry says, frowning. "I would never do that. I just," he cuts himself off when a waiter comes with their food and pours their wine. "Just doing what's due."
Harry lowers his chin, a small smile on his lips. Dazzling green, green eyes lights up at him. He softly says, "Come, I'll get you home."
. Draco jerks back, losing his grip on Theo's tie.
Still, they were great together and they ended on good terms.
"I am the oldest child, of course I had to--"
"What he meant is," Lily cuts in before Albus has the chance to reply, swinging her legs down and sitting properly. "We should ask Dad, or James. Or whoever, really. To tell us more about Father."
"Doesn't," Harry starts, glaring at his glass. "Doesn't seven years mean nothing?"
He nods, then quietly, "Okay."
Harry considers this, and nods. "According to moods, I guess, yeah?"
"Well?" Harry asks, "what else?"
"Come on," he says. "Let's see how many days of detention Scorpius manages to earn."
, if he might mention. But as he registers that he’s kissing Draco Malfoy, he feels as if all his breath has been taken away.
"Harry, Harry Potter." Harry says, finally turns to look at him as he shakes his hand. "We're colleagues."
Harry peers up at him, "Thank you. Is that all?"
"Is he dead?" He hears Blaise asks.
“Where should we start?”
Draco anyway. And then I realised something."
to Harry's chest. They are still so very close.
“Rivals to lovers are a popular trope, you understand,” James drawls, crossing his arms across his chest.
“...right.”
Draco’s lips, but he pulls away shortly. He opens his eyes; Draco’s closed. And when it finally opens, a curtain of haze covers.
She watches as Harry takes the picture with trembling fingers— he isn't crying, but she thinks she has never seen such a heartbreaking scene until this. He hasn't moved on then, she thinks.
And Harry thinks it's the wine because next he answers, "You're the most important person in my life."
So he tucks his chin on Draco's head, breathing in the vanilla shampoo Draco must use, and feels his heartbeat calm down.
"If you do that then I'll go back breathing like I've been smelling people's underpants all my life." Harry says, a grin on his face.
He shakes his head. "No, only you," he says, "All my secretaries have never stayed more than two months. Well, before you."
“This.” James says. “You.” and Lily can imagine him pointing a finger to Albus's face.
"Sorry, let me rephrase that. I'll tear only the people who stand in my way from getting to you, and I'll beg you to take me back, but if you really don't want me, I'll leave you alone but I'll be very miserable and sad."
"And then I started thinking about marriage, because I realised I never really did. And then I thought I don't even need marriage, because I'm too busy anyway." Harry says, then sighs pitifully.
Draco is only looking at him, unmoving. A short hesitation; but Draco does not move away, so his hand makes contact with the side of Draco’s face as he surges forward and meet they do.
They are now sitting down at the rooftop of a French Michelin-starred restaurant on a skyscraper tower. With candles between them and a live jazz performance.
Harry frowns. "We have always fought," he acknowledges. "But it is because you are brilliant."
But James would clam his mouth shut, lips thinning and pale white, eyebrows furrowing, every time she asks him about Father. Albus is the same, while Scorpius would only hug her and doesn’t let go for a very long time.
Harry drives them to a small cosy restaurant that only serves Fish and Chips; he orders coke and Draco a lemon tea. It is nowhere near fancy as last time, but Draco doesn’t seem unfazed.
Draco looks at him and gives the impression of shrugging without doing so. Harry would think that he’s too graceful to do such a thing. “No.”
“Oh, please,” Pansy turned to Blaise. “You’re next, so don’t even start, you bloody hypocrite.”
Pansy kicked the door open and marched in, followed by Goyle, Blaise, Weasley, and Granger.

Draco had done the only logical thing—turned it into a game of distracting Harry with his mouth until he gave in (Harry never lasted very long.)
"Is that so?" Harry raised an eyebrow, barely able to keep a straight face. "What'd you invite me over for, then?"
By the time Draco had finished his nighttime routine and emerged from his bedroom, Harry was already at the couch—Draco had a feeling that he’d simply cast a full-body
"They were banking on you not catching on," Harry added.
After a long, comfortable silence (during which Harry nearly fell asleep) Draco mumbled something into his shirt.

I just shook my head. I didn't trust myself to speak.
"Yes." Harry said simply. "But I'm alive."
"Harry, I—" A voice croaked, and Harry recognized it immediately, his blood going cold. Draco Malfoy.
If the Dark Lord was a viper, Harry was a garter snake—his Parseltongue flowed smoothly off his tongue, surrounding Draco’s mind in a way that sent a jolt down his spine.
That meant that I—
It wasn't working, I couldn't control my breathing. "Because—"
“Old habits die hard,” Draco shrugged. He grabbed Harry’s hand with his own and gave it a squeeze. “But that doesn’t mean I don’t like him,” he looked at Harry for a moment. “You know that, right?”

But it was too late—it was already beginning to morph into that slow burning feeling that spread through my chest and face.
I can’t concentrate when you do that!”
Once out of the shower, he got dressed and ran a flannel under some cold water, pressing it to his eyes. When he looked in the mirror, he schooled his face into a neutral expression. No, you couldn’t tell he’d been crying at all.
“Oh! Er, up to you, I guess,” he answered, surprised by the sudden subject change.
"That's right," Harry said. "That was your first mistake. Your second mistake was killing my parents. Your

that he wouldn’t pick up on it. Unfortunately for Harry, however, Draco was raised with pureblood ideologies—which included an understanding of non-verbal communication.
“Oh, fuck off,” Harry grumbled, adding a few logs to the fire and standing up. “Let's just get to bed so we can get started early.” He turned away from the fireplace and paused.
"You don't get it, do you?" Harry interrupted. "You aren't it's true master—Snape never

Harry coughed, muttering something under his breath.
basic—a small pinch pot with Draco’s initials carved into it, a lopsided coil vessel that couldn’t even hold water, and a drape bowl made from marbled clay.
It always started with anger, and it always started with Malfoy. Just when it seemed my insides were going to boil over in rage, it would subside—in its place was something new. My face would get red, and I couldn't breathe, as if the air would burn my lungs. All I knew was that somehow, Malfoy was causing it.
Draco paused, a chip lifted halfway to his mouth. “There’s no

Hermione rolled her eyes. “You don’t
“Alright, that’s it!” Harry threw his hands in the air. “No more! Conversation over, goodbye!”
"That's a good point," Draco murmured to himself, "I'll mention that if she brings it up again." He looked up and frowned. "What are you going to say if Mrs. Weasley asks about you?"
you, I guess.”
Hey, I’ll have you know that the first Christmas gift I got after coming to Hogwarts was a Weasley sweater,” he told him matter-of-factly.
He scrubbed his scalp with shampoo, trying to get the nightmare out of his head. It would be forgotten within a few hours, but the emotions that it brought would linger.. Harry finished his shower, but stayed under the water for a few extra minutes, letting the hot water wash over his shaking body. He pressed on the sides of his nose, trying to drain out any remaining tears and remove any sign of crying. A glamour charm wouldn’t work, as his wand was still under his pillow in the other room—his wandless magic was too inconsistent for that. Turning on the cold tap, he stood with his face directly in the spray of water to reduce any swelling.
"Because you're really attractive when you brew," Harry mumbled.

He was interrupted by a soft kiss—a kiss that wasn’t filled with need and desire like the previous ones. Draco tried to put as much reassurance into it as he could muster, slowly moving his lips against Harry’s until he ran out of air. Draco pulled away and gently ran his thumb against Harry’s cheek, watching the confusion flicker across his face.
Draco took a deep breath. "I'm afraid of what they'll say," he confessed. "Their views have changed a lot within the last year, but I'm still worried."
A moment later, Draco looked up when something was shoved in his face. Harry stood in front of Draco’s armchair, his hair back-lit by the fireplace. It took Draco a minute to focus his eyes on the wand in Harry’s outstretched hand.

Ron rolled his eyes, his eyes on the announcement in his hand. “You didn’t notice this?”
Draco clapped his hand over his mouth.

Harry frowned, wondering what the message could possibly say.
“I just—” Potter shook his head. “I like going to other houses’ practices. They’re neat.”
Harry blinked.
“You’ll do great,” Harry assured him, “eat your lunch, it’ll calm you down.”
Narcissa cleared her throat. "And Harry? I don't recall hearing any complaints about him recently."
seeker, nor would they risk passing the quaffle near their own goalpost.
“What do you mean?” Draco asked.
Draco pursed his lips. “Right,” he said, “right, that makes sense.” He stared at the book in his hands. “Maybe I could—no, that wouldn’t work.” He turned the book around to show Harry the cover. “Um, it’s kind of stupid, but I was going to ask if you’d like me to read to you. Except—well, this book is in French.”
Her hands crept beneath his shirt, feeling for a heartbeat. For a moment, there was nothing, and then— a slow, weak rhythm within his chest.
He flicked his hand, and an invisible wind breezed through the room, scooping up his various belongings and depositing them to their respective homes. “
Draco blinked and opened his mouth to protest, but Harry watched him with wide eyes, doing his best to appear innocent, and he relented.
It isn't explicitly mentioned in the fic, but Harry is demiromantic in this story! Obviously not every demiromantic (or demisexual) person will have the same experience, but this is based off of mine!

Draco watched him as he moved across the room. “That was quite a long shower, wasn’t it, Potter?” Draco commented from where he sat at the table.
“Here,” Harry pulled him to the side of the corridor, stepping back to draw his wand.
Harry tuned her out as he searched for his name, but the swirling letters made it difficult. When he finally found it, he groaned.
The cabin reminded Harry much of the hut that his uncle had dragged him to on his eleventh birthday, in an attempt to escape the deluge of Hogwarts letters sent to Harry. This situation was much more favorable, however—the cabin was considerably less dusty and damp, even if it
The shop was filled with shouts and boisterous laughter, the discordant noise hurting Harry’s ears as they entered. They got in line to order, squeezing behind a group of loud tourists. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry noticed Draco stiffen. He looked over to see him staring straight ahead, his arms drawn protectively across his torso.
"Recrystallized brimstone," Draco answered, grabbing the carefully-measured amount of sulfur. As he reached across the table, he deliberately shoved Harry's shoulder, which nearly caused him to splash their potion.

going to be the thing that forced him to confront his feelings? A stupid Auror mission with Harry
“Yes, I guess I did,” she says, absently combing through her long hair. “Though my grandmother said mine is a shade darker. His was almost white, platinum.”
Albus blinks, and nods. He clears his throat rather loudly, a touch too dramatic that it catches all the other three attention.
Draco hums, twirling the red liquid in his glass. His cheeks have the pretty hue of pink, expression ever so relaxed. Harry thinks this is one of his favourite looks on Draco. Soft and content.
“Secret mission,” he whispers. She nods seriously.
She watches carefully, the way Harry's expression shutters, and how James looks as if someone had hexed him. Cold sweat gathers in her palms.
"Oh, no," Harry says. "This is for you."
"Your eyes are rare," he blurts out. Draco blinks. To his horror, he hears himself add, "It's pretty."
After a few moments of silence, he asks, "Why?"
"Oh, hush, love. You just broke my heart, I am at least entitled for a treat." He says, sipping the drink again.
And then the line cuts off.
Which is how ten minutes later Harry finds himself sitting at Draco’s kitchen’s counter eating toast. Draco’s sitting silently beside him, taking tiny bites of his own toast.
"Would you like a drink?" Draco says, voice soft, when the car stops in front of the flat.
"Yes?" Rose prompts.
; his eyebrows relaxed, calm grey eyes warm, his expression smooth, and even his lips is achingly soft that Harry wonders if it would taste as sweet as it looks. “If you’re still trying to get me to not resign, you know even this won’t work.”
"So, Lily and I talked," he starts. Scorpius sweeps his gaze to Lily, a small furrow on his brow.
"I came back from the dead. I killed one dark lord. And most importantly, I'm marrying the most beautiful man alive. I think you should acknowledge that bringing imaginations to life is my specialty."
“No,” Albus stands up suddenly, and everyone turns to look at him. “I understand, trust me, I do. it’s absolutely clear that the
Harry laughs, “Yes.” Then he continues, “His way of showing his dislike of me was very creative, you see. Once in fourth year, he made pins that stated ‘Potter Stinks’ for nearly all of Hogwarts to wear, and no one can’t break down the charms he used. Every time someone tried to reverse it, the insults would turn nastier.” He pauses. “He's damn brilliant.”
Draco freezes, raising his eyes slowly to Harry.
Somehow, as he steps inside his bathroom and meets his own reflection, an image of a messy haired man with captivating green eyes appears in his mind. Draco shakes his head almost immediately, and sighs pitifully to his own.
“Now, now, what’re little children like you guys being so mellow about,” a voice drawls behind her.
James takes a deep, shuddering breath.
"I don't toy with you." Harry says, slightly confused.
Harry stands up and offers his hand out towards Draco. "Let's go then, the reservation's at six. I'll drive."
"I would sell my soul for another minute with him." Harry whispers, and there's a shuffling noise. Lily hopes it's Aunt Hermione moving to hug her dad.
Draco squeezes their hands, back arching upwards, and Harry retracts one of his hands to wrap around Draco's waist.
Harry thinks. He says, "I'm fine. No headaches, thank you. Starving though."
He smiles at her, as if knowing what is in her mind. "When we go home for Christmas, we'll pry it out of everyone. Dad, James. Everyone. Deal?"
He leans down, kissing and sucking and biting onto the soft skin of Draco's neck. His hands trails over both of Draco's arms until they're palms to palms, and their fingers intertwined together. He picks up his pace, going faster and harder and he can only hear the gasps and small moans escaping Draco's lips.
“Twice,” Theo says, slurping the rest of the beverage. “You broke my heart twice. I am now entitled to ask you to buy me dinner.”
Draco slips his free hand inside his pocket and takes out his car key, he narrows his eyes as he drops it on Harry's outstretched hand. "I was not aware of a dinner meeting,"
The shop doesn't really offer extravagant dishes, the cook was a French man in his fifties. It dawns on Lily that it seems to be an old family business.
In all honesty, Lily had planned to just get to it as soon as the door closed behind her.
"No," Draco admits. He's staring back at Harry and it's hypnotizing. The dark, deep hole seems to pull Harry closer and closer and falling, swirling mercury that looks magical.
Theo has been late for twenty minutes when the cafe's door opens and he comes in, stumbling but managing to look dignified the next second. He catches Draco's eyes and flashes him a smirk as he walks towards his table. He quietly sits down across Draco, unbuttoning his suit and places it on the back of his seat.
“Oh,” he says intelligently. Draco looks unamused. “That's nice to hear but apparently I ate something wrong at breakfast and I need to excuse myself at this not right moment.”
Harry rolls his eyes fondly. "I did. It's why I like you."
"Lily is only thirteen--"
"Good night, Draco," Harry says, and waves goodbye until Draco's car disappears into the distance.
Draco glances up to the visible strands of his hair and blows on them. "No, I quite like them this way."
Lily involuntarily straightens her back at the mention of their father. She had thought that they had to be the ones who fish the name out of Harry or James.
When Blaise steps outside his bedroom, Pansy turns back and says, "Theo has returned to London, I believe he also wants to settle down. I'll tell him to reach out to you, if you don't mind?"
Draco carefully places the bouquet on an empty corner of his desk, offers a stiff smile when Harry catches his eyes from inside, and very discreetly dives for his phone.
"Say it," Harry says. He himself is panting, but he feels like he could take the whole world down at the moment. He still moves, pushing in and pulling out agonisingly slow that it breaks Draco little by little. He wants to wreck Draco, ruin all the walls and have him raw. "Say my name."
Draco takes back the empty glass. Harry groans as he leans back to the sofa in relief.
"Harry," Draco whispers helplessly. "
"Morning, Draco,"
"You didn't cope very well. I was afraid that you would only become worse," he says, then quietly, "a part of me also wants to be selfish. to keep a part of him for myself."
"Oh, Harry," Hermione whispers, and doesn't say anything else.
Draco is leaning his head to Harry’s palm, tilting a little to the side. Harry moves forward again, this time with more force and crushes their lips together. Draco is pushed backwards, Harry getting on his knees and nudging Draco’s to make it part way for him.
"No, listen," Harry sits up abruptly, looking at Hermione. "And then I thought, it wasn't like I was lonely either.
"Theo? Shut up." Draco says. "There's your driver. Piss off."
Scorpius' pale complexion looks even more paler. He closes his eyes, tilting his head down. His blond hair, lighter than Lily's, falls onto his face.
They speak of many things, catching up. And despite what he claimed earlier, Draco is stuck with the longing feeling that he really
“It’s not an attempt to get you to stay,” Harry says calmly even though his heart is beating faster every minute. “It’s an attempt to get you to like me back.”
“Stay.” He murmurs. The figure in his arms slowly relaxes.
Draco groans, and blinks his eyes open when a warm hand presses over his forehead. Pansy is sitting on his bed beside him, dark eyes looking at him with concern. Blaise comes and drops to the other side of his bed.
Scorpius lifts an eyebrow. "What is it?"
"We've all grown up since then, do you understand?"
"Talked about finally talking the talk." Hugo says.
“Yes.” He says, unashamed. Then he stares at her silently, all the amusement draining out from his expression. He takes a couple of her books and walks beside her out of the library.
“I don't think I ever did,” he answers softly. “He was born into the war, on the opposite side of the war. Maybe I didn't understand back then, but now that I know what it feels like to have a family that you love...” he trails off.
Pansy's smile is genuine. Blaise hums, "So, when will we officially have you back?"
Lily nods. Family was the first to think of you, the first to hold you, to love you, to teach you about how life works. It wouldn’t be so easy to throw all of the life you had built, thinking it was the correct way of living, in a short moment. To walk to the other side alone and unprotected, to leave your family behind, everything that you thought was true. To turn your back to the psychopath that holds his wand right on the head of your parents.
Draco scowls. "It’s been over ten years."
“Harry,” Draco replies, his voice is painfully soft. Harry turns to look at him. Draco indeed looks
"Fuck," Harry curses. He looks at Draco, grey eyes sparkling and crystal tears at bay, his cheeks pink in contrast to his pale skin, lips red and wet and swollen
"Harry," he says softly. "Did the dinner go well?"
It’s fine, Lily thinks. Father is just upset at something. Perhaps he also had woken up from a nightmare. Nightmares are scary, she thinks. It makes her angry sometimes, though mostly she wakes up feeling scared.
"You're in your flat, yes?" She says impatiently. Draco sighs and hums an agreement. "Well then,
Draco blinks at her. He and Theodore Nott were college sweethearts, meeting as freshmen and dated through university until Theo had to go away for work. They had tried long distance relationship but with somewhat exhausting different time zones, they eventually lost.
"Maybe I'm bored," he mutters.
There is an uncharacteristic cynical jab in Scorpius’ tone when he says again, “It was himself that he killed, wasn’t it?”
"Seven years ago," he says. She takes note of how it wasn't only Harry or James that stiffen, but also Scorpius. "What actually happened to him?"
"You're insufferable." Draco huffs.
"It's different when you say it."
The next morning, just as Draco walks out of his flat with his car key in hand, Harry's already standing outside leaning on his car. He flashes Draco his own car key with a cheeky grin. He opens the passenger's door and gestures for him to go in. He expects a sarcastic remark, but Draco only spares him a suspicious look before complying without opening an inch of his lips.
Albus cuts in, "She meant about Father." And then it's as if the whole world heard him and collectively paused.
"There aren't a lot of things to do when your supposed enemy doesn't really do anything besides studying."
. For all he knows, Draco could be from one of the still standing old noble families.
it happened. Now that he knows how sleeping while holding Draco in his arms feels like, he's not exactly sure if he would live with the fact that he won't spend the rest of his life not doing
"James‐-" Scorpius grimaces, but Albus speaks over him,
Lily wakes up with a jolt, her tiny body shivering either from the cold air or the nightmare she had. It was scary, she had woken up alone. She couldn’t find Father even when she called for him, Daddy was nowhere to be found, or any of her brothers. She'd thought it was another prank from James and Albus, that they had somehow convinced their parents and the softhearted Scorpius to follow in and hide from her. But she had gone outside, and there was still nobody she could see. She’d cried and screamed and cried, and Father would have relented and come running to her. He would hold her and hug her and kiss her, telling her that he was sorry for scaring her. But Father hadn’t come. And she had been all alone until she woke up.
"That is unnecessary," Draco mutters. "I didn't think you were the kind of person to enjoy places like this."
"Apologies," Theo straightens, brushing his suit from imaginary dust. And suddenly he looks every bit a dignified, noble man. He offers a charming grin, eyes bright. "I tend to ramble a lot after having wine."
"I really don't think I am, 'Mione," Harry's voice breaks, and even though it seems that he hasn't ever stopped grieving even once for seven years, Lily's never heard him cry. "It was him that knew how to handle babies, it was him that coaxed the children whenever they're upset. It was him that sang lullabies, and it was him that taught the kids things."
Harry pauses just as he’s about to press. He didn’t exactly plan this. What if Draco really feels uncomfortable? Draco abruptly asked for a day off yesterday, he probably wants a day to think for himself. It is not polite for him to demand company on his day off, is it?
As it had always been, the five of them cram into one compartment together. She sits beside Scorpius, and halfway through the journey, rests her head on his lap and her legs on Albus'.
"And I won't ever leave the kids, I won't- I wouldn't dare-- but I told him- I told him to don't go where I can't follow and he promised that he won't but then he left. He fucking left and I feel like I'd march to where he is and drag him back here because I can't-- I'm not as strong as everyone takes me for and I need him."
He looks at Harry suspiciously before sighing and walks back to his desk. As soon as Draco turns his back, Harry faces the window and pumps his fist in the air.
Harry blinks. "That I miss you?"
Draco looks at Theo; an old friend first before anything else. Theo is looking at him like he already knows what the answer is.
“You can’t hide in the Gryffindor tower.” She tells him.
"Hey," Harry finally breathes.
“Funny. I think the same.” Draco says. There’s a sound of clothes ruffling and then Harry feels a blanket covering his body.
They're in their usual bar, where they have their weekly drink since university. Also where they go when at least one of them wants to get wasted but still wants to go home in one piece - today is Harry's turn. All of the waiters recognise them at this point, even going as far as having a few secret signals between them. For the normal days, they'd go to the bar and refill their drinks themselves. For
Harry quirks an amused smile. "Yes, that's good as well." he says, furrowing his thick eyebrows. He has grown facial hairs since the last time Lily had seen him, framing his jaw and around his mouth. He's still very handsome, even if he now has a permanent weary look on him. "Are you guys hungry? Should we go eat somewhere?"
"No, I–"
"No," Hermione says, amused. "Apparently Malfoy is resigning. Which is worse, according to Harry."
“James,” Scorpius pleads. Lily doesn’t want to look at what expression Harry has on his face, and doesn't want to wonder why he’s silent while two of his sons are fighting and his other two kids are crying. She doesn’t want to see if their dad is only looking at them passively, that grieving and sad look back on his face as he laments about the loss of the love of his life. She hides her face on Scorpius’ jumper, crying helplessly. She wants this to end. She wants this to end now.
for it - he’s wrong. Draco’s pliant and soft in the right places, kissing back with the right amount of power but he’s not trying to
“What,” Hermione says, blinking her eyes. “What makes you think so? I mean, why so sudden?”
“And you fell in love?” Lily prompts, trying and failing to keep her grin from widening.
James glares at Albus, unwavering. “This is why I didn't want to tell you. You’re a fucking child. You wouldn’t understand.”
At this Draco looks up, tilting his head in confusion. "I never thought of that. But it's not like we're fond of each other anyway, isn't that 'good luck'?"
," Hermione sighs. She turns to Harry. "Did he say why?"
Draco sighs, leaning his head to the wall behind him. Harry's eyes catch sight of the highlights of his bare throat, watching it bobbing as Draco swallows.
"What?" Draco whispers. Harry tilts his head, as if expecting an answer and this isn't some sort of hidden joke. Draco blinks and schools his expression, no longer looking in horror instead into something - he hopes - unimpressed. "Oh, it's all right."
“Oh,” says James. “Don’t say things like that, Dad. I'm one sentence away from bawling till next week.”
“No, it’s all right.” Draco replies, amused. "I had my fill of rest."
On the other hand, Harry also wants to kiss him; a mix of lips gently pressing against each other, and hungry and thoroughly messy. So that’s what he does.
She remembers him coaxing her with chocolates when she was throwing a tantrum. She remembers him curling around her when she couldn't sleep so she could. She remembers him feeding her breakfast, and she insisted she also feed him food with her bare hands. She remembers him scolding her brothers when they picked on her, and the way he had brought all of them to an ice cream shop the next day. There is a faint memory, from the back of her head, that she had once found him crying in the arms of her dad. He hadn’t looked very good the next few days, but he still smiled at her as he hugged her when she cried because she thought that she did something wrong to make him angry.
,” he hisses. “How would you understand what he felt? What the fuck do you know about how he’d struggled to accept his mistakes, struggling how he should feel about the things he did or didn’t do?! That lots of people lost their families, and how he thought he was selfish to try and keep his own family alive?!”
Harry huffs playfully and steps back. "Excellent guess, Malfoy."
. But then Harry folds his arms on the table and rests his cheek there.
“What? You’re shocked,” he mused. “Draco, Draco, Draco, Draco, Draco, Draco--”
It is five past ten when there is a knock at the door. Harry looks up to see Draco already walking towards him with a tablet in his hand. On his left wrist is his usual expensive silver-green watch - which Harry learnt is a
“Alright, we’re friends, Potter.” Draco says.
"No," Scorpius says. He looks like he's one minute away from crying. "We were all grieving."
“I thought you would prefer last time.” Harry says.
Harry smirks. "Go on and get your things then."
There's a weird sense of Deja vu when she sees Scorpius standing before the stairs, his back leaning to the wall, in his hand is his wand. He glances at her, puts a finger on his lips, and focuses back to peek downstairs.
"Oh," Draco says, "Well, you were
When he steps out of the elevator and his gaze falls to the empty desk across the door of his office, Harry feels even more pathetic. He forces to look away and walks inside his office, slumping in his seat but not moving to turn on the computer.
She likes that photo of Father. She'd like to keep it. her fingers hover above the page for a moment, hesitating. She rips the photo off the page anyway. She closes the book and the box, slips the photo into her pocket, and steps out of her room.
James had been thirteen, he had the blessing of having complete parents from he was a baby until he turned into a teenager. He had known what it was like to receive his Hogwarts’ invitation and boast about it in front of Father and Dad, how it feels like when his whole family came with him to King’s Cross. To send a letter back home on the very first day alone without family at Hogwarts and receiving a reply the next morning filled with reassurance. James had known what it was like when he went home for Christmas bringing trouble with his homework and having Father help him. He knows how it felt like, having his family cheering for his team at Quidditch, having Father cheer for him even though it was against his former House.
"Oh, God," Draco hears himself say.
“Alright what?”
Theo steps forward, offering his hand to Harry. "Hullo, I'm Theodore Nott."
"You're a great parent, you know that." Aunt Hermione.
She flushes. "No, I meant--"
Harry clears his throat and looks at him seriously. “I have been trying to woo
Harry doesn't reply for a very long time. He traces the photo with a finger, and Lily catches sight of the golden ring on his ring finger. She remembers that he had never pulled it off even once.
Draco rolls his eyes, moving forward to take back his glass of frozen hot chocolate. Theo raises the glass away from his reach.
“Huh,” when she turns to Albus, there is a spark of wonder and awe.
"I can help you apparate, if we're going back home," James says softly to Harry. Harry nods, and stands to pay for the food.
Harry lights up at the face of the old lady and goes to greet her. The four of them exchange unsure looks at each other before awkwardly trailing behind him. They have finished the pleasantries, and the old lady tilts her head over Harry's shoulder to look at them.
"I can't pretend to understand your way of thinking, Harry. James Sirius, Albus Severus, and now Lily Luna?" Draco tsked. And even after giving birth, pale and tired, he still looks very beautiful.
"You like the rain?"
Draco doesn't bother to open his eyes, blindly reaching his nightstand to put his phone there. In a minute, he falls into a slumber again.
"I think I might fancy him," Harry says. While his two best friends freezes, Harry blinks at them. As the silence grows longer and weirder, it seems to sober Harry up. His eyes widen as he says, "Oh."
Harry turns. "These are my kids. I'm sure you've met James when he was still a babe."
Draco seems to mumble what sounds like "..love you.." as sleep overtakes him in an instant.
Draco rolls his eyes, but is unable to stop himself from smiling. "Fashionably late, as always.”
He waits, placing his phone on the side of his face and closes his eyes again. He's nearly asleep again when the other line picks up and a familiar voice greets him.
. Don't move a strand of your hair."
Harry's voice is so broken and sad and Lily can't stop her tears. Because listening to her dad, Harry potter whom people worshipped, the Chosen One who defeated the dark lord over and over again and once and for all. The strong and tall, warm and kind, and he's been through so much. It sounds so raw and honest and Lily doesn't think there's anything more heartbreaking than this.
James shoves Harry's hand off him, and meets Albus. “
to be uncomfortable. And yet, he buries his nose in Draco’s soft hair, not hearing the other's sharp intake of breath. He feels whole. He feels content.
When the car stops in front of Draco’s flat, neither of them move.
"I know," he says easily, expression smug. "Scorpius tells me that everyday."
"I stole it from one of your photobooks in my first year. I'm sorry," Scorpius says.
“Of course,” she says. “I miss him every minute of the day. I miss him very, very much.”
It's silent for a minute, them staring straight at each other and standing very closely. Harry barely registers the low noises of other passing people behind him because–
“It was himself, wasn’t it?”
Hermione rolls her eyes as Ron takes a seat between Harry and her, placing three pints of beer on the small, square shaped table.
Harry shrugs. "Dinner."
The first year asks Lily Luna, “Do you remember your father?”
"Of course you will. I'll scream bloody murder until the Aurors come here by my voice alone and drag you back here to me, if you leave."
"We're old enough. Why can't we talk about Father normally, why is it like some sort of taboo to ask about him?"
When he arrives at his own home, Harry drinks until he passes out.
Harry closes his eyes, lips disappearing into a thin line behind his beard. James looks odd, Lily thinks, and it clears up when he replies. "In a way," he says, quietly.
“Your hair, you got it from him, I heard?”
Harry must have not fully recovered, because next he sees a fond look crossing Draco's face. But as soon as he sees it, Draco has already pulled away from his arms and stretches as he stands up. He does
He catches Draco's waist with his free hand and pulls him close. He places a soft, chaste kiss. "I'm not," he says. "You look really nice."
There's a soft noise coming from Draco, and his blond head looks up to look at him. "You're very… creative with your imagination, you know that, Potter?"
It is Scorpius who moves towards Harry, kneeling on the side of his sofa as he reaches a hand inside his own coat. He's taking out the picture of Father, Lily realises. Harry doesn't look surprised, he must have known that one of them had got it. Of course, he would know that.
Harry shrugs. "Why not?"
"I'm considering doing it," Draco snaps. "You clearly deserve it."
Here is the thing. She had a thousand times of practice, delivering the same answer every time someone new asked her. She should answer with practiced ease. And yet, this time she pauses. Various notes and books from her first year that are laid out on the table for her tutoring suddenly become a blur.
"Well that wasn't awkward," James says. He had taken the seat next to Harry, Lily and the twins in front of them both. "I don't remember that old lady."
“Alright, alright!” Draco hisses, looking around in alarm. “We’re in the library, do remember that.”
Grey eyes open. "You may be a little drunk. It is raining." He says. "Stay."
"They're twins, Albus and Scorpius," Harry says, then places a hand on Lily's shoulder. "This one's Lily Luna, the youngest."
"It's not fair," she whispers finally, into the tense air of the compartment. "You might have more memories of him. I only have blurs of moments."
Sleepy, soft grey eyes turn to look back at him. Christ, his head is pillowed on Harry's bicep and his face had most definitely
"Love you," Harry says, mouthing to the vein on Draco's neck. "I love you."
James is breathing heavily, still glaring even with tears threatening to fall. Lily doesn’t bother to hold back her tears, and she feels Scorpius pulling her to his arms.
Harry kisses him, messy and wet, spit everywhere but he's never been more aroused. The last few moments in their high are brutal, and Draco can't seem to focus on anything except the harsh but welcoming feeling on where they're joined. He presses his head back, his hair spread like a halo lighting up on the Gryffindor red sheets.
“No promises,” he replies, and Scorpius sighs.
Most of the time, though-- “Your other father. Do you remember him?”
Harry blinks. “Yes?”
Harry smiles at him, then takes a nostalgic look around the shop. "Your father and I used to go here a lot ever since we graduated from Hogwarts."
Scorpius and Albus both level James with a stare, eerily disconcerting. It makes Lily shiver, and it also seems to creep James out. They don't say anything, and instead sweep through the hall to the kitchen. Lily shakes her head at James, and follows, him trailing behind her.
"She should have," Lily agrees. “But she never seems to really like us so much. Look! This must be when they graduated from Hogwarts.” She points to the picture on the first page. There’s two teenagers, standing so close to each other. One was wearing the Gryffindor robes, and he had his arms around the waist of the other one who wore Slytherin robes. They weren’t looking at the camera, but at each other instead. Their foreheads pressed together, their wind-blown messy hair tangled over each other, somehow contrasting perfectly.
"Stay," Draco whispers, eyes closed.
After a moment of silence, Lily conflicted between straightforwardly asking what happened seven years ago or try asking for another memory, it is Albus who speaks.
When the table clears, she stands to tidy her own things. The person from before slumps on the seat next to her.
"Yes, Sir," Draco replies absently, tapping the screen. Then he takes out a file of paper he was carrying on his arm and places it on Harry's table. "This is the proposal for the acquisition of Emerald Cavern Hotel."
Harry looks at him, then shakes his head with a grin. "No, I can’t say I am.”
"You really aren't going to leave me alone?" Draco says after a long moment. He keeps his eyes trained on the books in front of him.
Draco narrows his eyes, then sighs. "Oh, all right."
Harry insists he will drive again on the way to his place. When they arrive, Harry meets Draco outside the passenger's side of the car.
"Please do so," Harry replies.
“I figured,” Draco says, setting his half bitten toast down and lifting his glass of water towards his lips. He seems like he wanted something else before thinking against it. Harry understands the way his eyes flit away from his gaze anyway.
"What is it?" Ron asks, eyes wary.
"--what to do, how to handle this." Her dad's voice. "It's pathetic that I don't know how to handle my own kids."
He hears footsteps closing, and when he looks up, Draco has an exasperated look on his face. "You're teasing."
Bear in mind that Harry has
“But that’s it,” Harry says, voice grave and so, so sad. His green eyes are terrible to look at, and Lily looks away. “Depression isn’t something one could easily understand.”
Draco looks at him straight in the eyes, and it feels like he's confronting himself more than answering Theo. He nods. "There is."
"And here I thought I made it pretty clear; no."
Harry shifts closer, his hand coming up to cup Draco’s cheek, gently leading him to face him. Draco looks back at Harry with a rare show of uncertainty and vulnerability in his pale eyes. It gives Harry hope, and suddenly he’s bubbled up with courage.
"We had wine at dinner before. I did," Harry says. "Your friend said he did, you must have had some too."
"Come on," he says, waving a hand at Harry. "You should eat something light.”
Hermione places her hand on top of Harry's, and squeezes it gently. "It's alright if you're not ready to settle down, Harry."
Draco gives him a calculating gaze, and doesn't answer. He instead focuses back on his plate. They spend dinner having light-hearted conversations, not work-related and he manages to get Draco to smile a few times so Harry thinks it's a success. Draco sends him a suspicious look when he finds out the meal was paid in advance.
Harry doesn’t realise this but as he drifts off, he unconsciously grabs Draco’s wrist and pulls him down beside him. He doesn’t understand - his body feels warm, the blanket feels warm, and when he unknowingly drapes over Draco, he feels even more
"Shut up," Draco says, his voice high. "Stop being a sap, Potter. I'll break the engagement."
Draco snaps his head towards Harry very quickly. "
“He's only second to Hermione. But that charms work made her more mad than she was about his insults for me. He also took one step further to write a song specially to insult Ron's ability in playing Quidditch.”
This time, Draco looks directly at him, visibly annoyed. "Why?"
"Shut it. Where's my wand?" he winces when Harry pulls out, letting himself get manhandled to fit in Harry's arms. Harry waves his hand, effortlessly casting a cleaning charm, and drags his bed cover over them. "Show off," Draco says sleepily without heat.
. He seems like he’s kissing and he’s
Harry glares at his pint, drinks the beer with large gulps, and glares again at the empty glass. Ron exchanges looks with Hermione; he shrugs, and she sighs. Ron waves a hand at a waiter, signaling with his fingers the number three and two at them and receiving a thumbs up in return.
He turns to Draco and furrows his eyebrows as he says, "Draco also doesn't do well with alcohol, do you?" then turns back to Harry without waiting for an answer. "You should try to see him drunk. He's cute that way, because he gets quiet but not really, he would sleepy whisper-ramble all night long until he passes out. And—"
"Pansy did," Blaise says rather cheerfully. "She said you were dying so I thought she would probably need some help with your corpse."
“Oh, Albus..” She pulls him into a hug. He leans down to bury his face in her hair, holding her books with one arm instead so he can wrap the other around her back. She can hear sniffles, but refrains herself from saying anything.
When Harry moves closer again, Draco lets out an undignified - utterly adorable - squeak, and Harry is suddenly kissing a cold palm. Unsurprisingly, Draco’s hands are smooth and perfect for all the work he does. Harry’s sure the man couldn’t be more perfect and feels his heart swells.
Scorpius snorts. "He is. He loved, no, he still loves him very much."
“Nothing fancy, I hope that’s all right?” Harry asks.
"Oh." Harry says, shifting in his seat that his knees knocks Draco's. "You don't mind?"
"Are you sure, Draco?" Pansy asks, wrapping her hand around Draco's.
Pansy widens her eyes, and though Blaise merely raises his eyebrows he looks taken aback enough. Draco thinks his friends would want to ask the obvious question of
Lily turns to him, and blinks as if unperturbed. “He's still my favourite. Where did you leave him?”
Now, the kiss is gentle, lightly pressing his lips over Draco’s. It’s everything he’s expected from Draco. Soft and sweet. Harry would
“I would know what’s easy and what not,” Harry says, snorting lightly. When Draco turns his head away, Harry hastily says, “Sorry, sorry. I just meant that we went through a war, what could be harder than that?”
“He shouldn’t have fucking left!” Albus yells, red framing his eyes angrily. “He succeeded in keeping his family alive, he made a new family with the chosen one of anyone else! What more could he want?!”
Later, Draco will wake up with Harry still in the same place. Silently, patiently playing with Draco's fingers. Harry will kiss him, and he will drown in happiness, feeling content. The kids will wake up and crowd his bed, and they will eat together. and then, they will go back home a family of six, complete at last.
Something in Harry's expression hardens, and somehow, he looks colder than he had ever been. He walks closer to where Draco is standing with Theo.
Harry quickly adds, "Not work related, don't worry! I'm just,"
Harry glances between his best friends, then at his empty glass. He opens his mouth, Ron and Hermione look strangely expectant.
Right. So they're going to have A Conversation - A Specific One. Ron braces himself, drinking his whole pint in less than a minute.
Well, he
Draco raises an eyebrow. "Are you really?"
Then they ask, eyes wide with childlike innocence. “What was he like?”
"Shut it, Nott." Draco grits out, and then nearly shoving him out of the way.
Ah, the reminder of The Sleeping Incident. Harry blinks, doesn't have the slightest idea how he should approach the matter. It's not like he's actually
"Pansy, darling," he drawls softly.
Draco stands up straight and waves a hand as he strides around the car towards the driver seat. "Good night, Harry,"
“Is everything all right?”
Draco doesn't talk much these days, and Harry finds himself searching for his sarcastic snide remarks. Looking for a sense of normalcy. Malfoy has always been a constant ever since the start of his life in this magical world.
Draco widens his eyes and takes a step back, though not quite as fast. Harry thrusts the bouquet to his hands with a bright grin.
"We will have to talk about this sooner or later," she tells him, desperate.
“I’m not asking you to return my feelings if you do not.” Harry whispers. “All I ask of you is to give me a chance; but, one word from you, and I won’t ask of anything again.”
“Yes.” She answers immediately, stomach fluttering at the idea. All this time, she had wolf down every bit of information and fond memories of their father as if starving. But it was as if the world was keeping her in the dark, no one willing to answer her questions, no one willing to talk about Father for hours.
"Yes," Harry replies shortly.
Harry bites back another dirty response and laughs instead. "Sorry, sorry. Come here," he opens his arms and Draco stares at him suspiciously before burying his face back into Harry's neck. "You're really cute when you get shy."
"Also, I'm resigning."
"And it was you that cooked for him and the kids, it was you that took care of him and the kids. You taught the kids how to walk, you took them to play and kept them safe when he wasn't feeling well. And you hung on and kept taking care of your kids,” Hermione says. "You might not know how to sing, how to teach your kids potions or- or things. You don't have to know everything to be a good parent, you know."
James avoids eye contact with the three of them. As he walks outside the shop after giving a nod at the old lady, they follow behind him.
"Why on our seventh year?" Harry whispers. "Not sixth, not eight. Seven is supposed to be good luck, perfection."
Draco sighs. "You know that the flowers and dinner won't change my mind, right?"
viii.
“What?” Lily says, almost a reflex. “Oh, is it about the brothers thing? Of course I love you three equally, it’s just that--”
"I miss this," James says quietly after they all finish eating and the laughter has died down. "I miss all of you, really."
Draco turns to look at him with wide eyes. Theo is bent forward because of his stupid tie, and they are awfully
“We should talk, don’t you think?” he says, voice hoarse. “About him. we’re old enough.”
“Harry?”
"Scorpius is a copy of him," Rose says.
Lily stands up at that, as does Scorpius. But it seems that it’s still too slow, as James moves as if to shove Albus, and their dad looking absolutely thunderous as he holds his oldest son back. Lily unconsciously recoils back, and even Albus looks startled but stubbornly stands still. She has never seen their dad angry, but now, she finally believes that this man is indeed the one who killed a dark lord in his teens. Then, as if he only realises just then who he’s standing against, Harry looks as if slapped.
Lily realises with a pang that they weren't particularly close with each other after she entered first year, leaving their dad alone with a memory of what once was a perfect family. She exchanges a look with Scorpius and Albus; Scorpius grimaces, and Albus thins his lips.
- the reason why he decided to resign so suddenly.
Draco, still startled from his own sudden instinct, startles even more. He snaps his head towards the voice and feels his blood drain out. "Harry?" He whispers, then very slowly lifts his gaze to the restaurant's big, shining, colourful title. It is the restaurant where Harry was having the dinner meeting. He looks back to Harry again, who is standing just outside the door.
"Good grief, mate," Ron says, pushing a pint towards Harry. "No wonder he's so miserable."
“Hey,” Harry says, softly. He places a hand over Draco’s, sensing the way Draco stiffen when he did. “What I said yesterday, I mean it.”

"That's what it took for me to—to admit it." He forced himself to look Draco in the eye. It was now or never. "Can I kiss you?"
Harry laughed. “Because that’s how you eat fish and chips,” he grinned at Draco’s bewildered expression. “C’mon, sit down and eat.”

“Of course,” Draco squeezed his hand again and returned to his book. He hadn’t released Harry’s hand, leaving him only his non-dominant hand to take notes. Harry laughed as he struggled to circle a word on the page, his quill clutched in his left hand. “Oh, shove off,” Draco rolled his eyes, but he was laughing, too. He still didn’t let go.
Harry shrugged. "I'm nervous to tell Ron and Hermione. I mean, I

"I know."
Draco stared at him.
“Dare,” he said immediately.
“Yeah, you know,” Harry gestured with his hands. “Mrs. Weasley makes one for each of us. I call them Weasley sweaters.”
Draco stared at him. “Alright, Potter. I can excuse cuddling—

Harry snorted. "What'd you tell her?"

"He's alive!"
"Draco? Are you alright?" Mrs. Malfoy's voice was muffled through the door.
All thoughts in Draco’s mind ceased to exist—all that existed was Harry’s lips on his, the hand clutching his robes, and the arm that now snaked around his waist.
At this point, Draco was completely lost. He had no idea where Pansy’s claim had come from. Not only that, but no one seemed surprised by it. In fact, they all seemed... in on it? Draco felt like the world was slipping under his feet, any understanding he had of the situation vanishing.
"How rude of them," Draco chuckled.
Draco huffed. “This is bullshit.” He turned to walk away, just as Harry opened the door to go into the bathroom.
They both laid perfectly still for a long moment, both hyper aware of the exceedingly small space between them. And then—to Draco’s horror—Harry rolled over to face him, draping an arm across Draco’s torso and burying his face in the back of his neck.
“Do what?” Harry absentmindedly stroked the back of his hand.

His voice became clearer as he exited the closet, holding two sets of dress robes. "Babe?" He frowned as he caught sight of Harry, who was trying

Harry winced. “Okay fine, you’re right—”
"You mean, like a panic attack?"
Malfoy snorted. “Whatever.” He paused, thinking. “But what do they want us to even do?” He gestured, their shared annoyance easing the tension in the room. “It’s not like you and I can just date!”
Draco rolled his eyes. “
I ducked through the doorway and hurried down the hall. I wasn't in the mood for a fight, and besides, the anger was already retreating. This had been happening lately—any mention of Malfoy left me frustrated and angry, but as soon as he was
Avoiding the squeaky floorboards, he slowly made his way down to the kitchen. He was just about to put his shoes on when a figure appeared at the top of the stairs.

And then there was the way that Harry’s face lit up
Draco hissed in pain, trying to wrench his arm out of Harry's grasp, but Harry only held on tighter.
“Hmm,” Harry craned his head to read the notes he’d already written, but the fire was nearly out at this point, and he couldn’t make out the words. “What’s it about?”
“It’s due to the mechanics of the Connectivity Draught, I’m afraid,” she answered. “The bond can’t be removed manually. Normally, once a connection is established, a secondary potion would be taken in order to solidify it. Without taking this potion, the new bond will simply fade. So all you have to do is wait.”
Harry shrugged. “I forgot, honestly. I wouldn’t have gotten rid of it, regardless.”
Draco's mouth stretched into a grin. "My Patronus is
"Whatever you do, you'll be great at it," Draco squeezed his hand.

He stared at me. "Why else would I—why else would I kiss you?"
“Do you, now?” Draco smirked and joined Harry on the bed, wrapping an arm around his shoulder. “Well, unfortunately for you, I’m all done. It’s your turn now—what’d you get?”
Draco gave him a sly smile. “Do I have a

But then Draco called Harry downstairs, and Harry couldn't find it in his heart to ignore him. He trudged down the stairs and into the living room to find Draco with an
“No, Neville,” Harry laughed. “Ron is, I think, but that’s all.”
Draco hit his shoulder with his charms textbook. “Oh, shut up," he laughed, and Harry felt a surge of satisfaction as Draco grinned at him. His whole face lit up when he smiled, and Harry couldn't help but stare as a warm feeling bloomed in his chest.
“—was it the hair? I bet it was the hair—”
Draco blocked the entrance to their closet as Harry approached it. "Maybe we should reschedule," he eyed Harry, noting his disheveled appearance. "You should just change into your pajamas."
Harry sighed and shook his head. “I think I’ll want to wait to tell Ron and Hermione. Besides, I don’t know how Remus and Sirius will react.”

level of disagreement between them if they were to keep their relationship a secret. It wasn't that difficult, anyway—the banter came naturally to them, and Harry was actually starting to find it enjoyable. Not that he let anyone know that, of course.
Neville shrugged. “I still don’t like him,” he looked at Draco. “No offense—”
Harry snorted. “You could do accidental magic on
That being said, Harry still had his fair share of bad days. There were days when everything made him angry, when the smallest inconvenience sent waves of frustration through him that he struggled to suppress. There were days when he couldn't find the energy to get himself out of bed, when he was plagued with nightmares during the night and flashbacks during the day. There were days when he simply couldn't understand

Harry frowned, unsure whether he should be happy that he’d managed to brew most of the potion correctly, or embarrassed that it hadn’t been very strong. “So much for an uneventful school year,” he grumbled.
"Thanks."
“Did everything go alright?” Draco asked him in a hushed tone, quietly closing the door. “No one saw you?”
Draco’s mind felt like it was about to implode as he struggled to wrap his mind around this. Potter wasn’t recoiling, nor was he denying it—he just looked surprised, like he had no idea how Pansy had come across this knowledge. Draco let out a nervous laugh at the shock written clearly across Potter’s face.
Draco carefully stood up, his hands still covering his eyes. He bit the inside of his cheek as he heard Potter drying himself off with a towel. Potter was

"Oh, I'm just so used to hearing about him, that's all. I think I'll owl him, see how he's doing."
“What are you talking about?” Harry asked. He didn’t like where this conversation was going.
Harry blinked, his eyes bleary with sleep as he attempted to get a look at his surroundings. He was clearly in the hospital wing—the white bed he was in being a dead giveaway—but he couldn’t discern any other details, as his glasses were missing. Mercifully, he noticed, his skin was healed—he’d be in a

Harry frowned. “You do?”

Draco let out a surprised squeak, prompting Harry to laugh harder. “Shut up!”

He bought a ring anyways, of course. It was a simple gold wedding band that sparkled when the sun hit it. It was subtle, just like Harry liked it. He never liked to wear flashy, expensive clothing or accessories like Draco. He was perfectly happy with his worn cloak and frayed trousers, even when he had to frequently patch them.
The effort to understand the situation was dizzying.

Draco wasn’t sure if they were even arguing with each other at this point—it was more like they were monologuing without actually listening to what the others were saying. From a few seats down, Draco could see Goyle eyeing the food that sat between Granger and Pansy. Wordlessly, he grabbed the nearest chicken pie and passed it over to him. After all, Goyle clearly didn’t care about the situation, and he certainly shouldn’t starve because of it. Besides, chicken pie was his favorite. Goyle gratefully accepted it and dug in.
“I do care,” Harry frowned, “and I’m the same way, I think.”
Draco followed close behind. “I don’t need food, I need answers." He needed to know why Potter was paying attention to him like that—and he needed a better reason than

Harry lied motionless in the grass as Narcissa approached Harry slowly, kneeling at his side and pressing her fingers against his throat.
“That’s a bit scary,” Draco admitted, before yawning. “Listen, I don’t know about you, but I’m going to bed.” He stood up and stretched his arms to the ceiling.

“Will you marry me?” Draco’s voice was a near whisper, the lump in his throat preventing him from speaking properly.
Harry’s eyes wandered around the room, hoping to find everyone’s eyes focused on Pansy instead of him. Thankfully, it seemed that they’d already moved on—likely from the alcohol in everyone’s system. Harry sneaked a peek at Draco, who was staring at the ground, looking supremely startled.
"Hey, can I ask a question?"
After apparating them to a side street, he led Draco to the fish and chip shop. “Yeah, it gets crowded on Fridays,” he said when he spotted Draco’s bewildered expression. Despite it almost being ten o’clock, the tiny shop was packed with people waiting for their orders. “It’s kind of a tradition—they call it

At first glance, it looked like a regular wizarding magazine with a ribbon bow attached—but once he got a closer look, Draco nearly jumped out of his skin, his face heating.

but maybe he was wrong. Maybe their relationship had been falling apart right in front of him, and he didn’t even notice.
In fact, he may have attempted to snog Harry multiple times throughout their date, but either Draco chickened out or Harry was completely oblivious to the subtle hints he dropped. Or maybe it was both.
“You know, shagging!” He gestured wildly.

The loud chirping of the birds is what pulled Draco from his blissful sleep the next morning. Grumbling under his breath, he wrapped his arms tighter around himself and shifted his head, pressing his face into his pillow in an attempt to muffle the sounds.
Malfoy’s mouth snapped shut and he stepped back a step, his hand pressed to his chest. “Oh,” he said in a small voice.
"I can't believe it took you this fucking long to notice," Pansy groaned, leaning back against the sofa.
Bracing his arm on the back of the couch, Draco leaned down to press his lips to his neck. He was

"Alright. Goodnight, Draco."

"Is this about Weaselette?"

will help.” He placed his food on his lap and waved his wand over it to demonstrate. It was a trick that Mrs. Weasley had shown him—Harry found it really useful for heavier foods that often made him sick.
“Those are the words I don’t recognize,” Draco explained, “I’m going to look them up later.”
Harry blinked. “Oh.”
“It’s true! I didn’t know
“Night,” Draco responded softly. He sat there for a moment, his hand pressed to his cheek as he listened to Harry's footsteps as he ascended the stairs to his dorm, before slowly standing up to head to the dungeons.
Harry sighed deeply in his sleep, and the last thread of Draco’s self-control snapped when he felt Harry’s hot breath on his neck. Careful not to wake him, he slowly wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist. He could’ve sworn Harry held him even tighter for a moment—no, that was probably just his imagination. Draco rested his chin over Harry’s head, finally giving in to sleep.
“No,” she says. “My favourite is Scorpius, remember?”
James considers him. "Some people think it is."
"D'you reckon there's a lot of these that Grandmother keeps to herself?" Scorpius asks.
Draco looks at him, silent. "I don't."
“If you only remember little about him, can you miss him?” The one who had begun the questions about her father asks her with a small voice. Then, she understands the meaning behind the question.
Draco is still silent, though he’s staring at Harry with wide eyes and parted lips. Harry inhales, calming his loudly beating heart.

He takes a shuddering breath, and pulls away slowly. His eyes are red-rimmed, cheeks pink. His eyes are the exact copy of dad, she thinks. Hers are more of a lighter green.
But then there is a piece of paper in front of her eyes. A photo, she realises. It seems old, rumpled and folded. It is as if the photo had been opened and folded repeatedly, brought everywhere and everyday, not kept inside an album or a frame.
Draco raises a hand and gently rubs his eyes. "Hi," he says, voice thick with sleep.
"Me too," Pansy says, standing up. "Now get up, let's go for brunch."
Harry looks at him, considering to lie and say yes.

"That's kind of creepy and scary, Potter." Draco's voice is muffled but he's snuggling deeper to Harry's chest, as if he couldn't get more warmth from him.
“He’s also very much in love with you, that I can tell with confidence.” James tells him.
"That's what you've been planning?" James asks, sounding a little cold.
Draco rolls his eyes and sits up, leaning against the bedpost. "I was given a day off and I thought I would use it by meeting up with my silly friends over lunch. But I guess this works too."
“They’re so..” Albus trails off, staring at the picture with a strange look. “Young,” he finally settles on.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Clearly, you’re attempting to woo someone. You must have taken me there for tasting. Now you have invited me for dinner; am I to assume it went well as you wish?”
“Our rivalry went up to fifth year,” the light in Harry's eyes dims. “That summer, he took the mark. In sixth year, he looked like he had been forced to grow up in such a short time. He doesn’t pick up fights anymore, and he was silent, always detached from his friends. At the end of sixth year, the war starts. He doesn’t come back to school, and we’re officially on the run.”
"Nice," Blaise says, "Up for a trip? Let's go to Italy in two."
He blinks, and Theo is staring at him curiously. His eyes are a pair of stunning hazel, light green and specks of gold. But it didn't seem to be as enchanting as the beautiful, even more rare colour of evergreen. Draco raises an eyebrow.
He heard Dudley and the Professor shout for him as the bus jerked once more. Harry burrowed himself under the suitcases and tried not to get squished, scales changing to match the brown tones of the suitcases subconsciously. Eventually the bus stopped and the suitcases were moved around him to reveal a very concerned Dudley and Professor Snape. Harry slithered out of his spot rather slowly and changed back to human with a dazed expression on his face. He was pretty sure he heard Dudley ask if he was alright but the vibrations in his jaw were still translating sounds for him that humans wouldn’t normally worry about.
(See the end of the chapter for
Snape had only told them about the goblins a few minutes ago and Harry was getting quite annoyed. This was the man that the school had sent to explain how their new world worked and how they fit into it but so far he hadn’t explained anything that they didn’t already know! Sure they had learned the official words for his mother’s blood curse and snake-speak but they already knew about those things before. He wanted to yell at the man. He wanted real answers to questions like: did they always need wands to perform magic, why did no one else notice the strange creatures that were now walking around in broad daylight, and why on earth was everyone constantly whispering about him!
“Did you know my mother?”
“Dudley… this is about you. Why is it about you? You’re not…” Like me, wrong, different, he wanted to say to his cousin but couldn’t bring himself to utter the words.
The more conscious he became, the more he wanted to fall right back to sleep as his mother’s shrieking filtered into his ears like fingernails on a chalkboard.
Dudley said hastily trying to salvage the meaning of his words.
Harry decided he was going to do just that when the biggest bus he had ever seen pulled up in front of them in a flurry. At least he was pretty sure it was a bus. The thing was dark purple and looked more like a van if it hadn’t been for the two stacks of windows encased in metal that protruded off the top of the van base. It looked more like a backwards camper if you asked him. The bus opened its door to reveal a short white haired man with big round glasses on his face who turned and greeted them all with a smile. Harry thought he very much resembled a small owl when he did so.
The inside of the nest was filled with plush green grass and blue skies. It even had a sun, trees, mountains and Harry could swear he smelled water coming from somewhere. Snape told them that there was a lake a few hundred feet away along with fruit bearing trees and vegetables growing in natural patches. He even added game such as rabbits, toads, deer and a few snakes and foxes for predators. If the animals got to be to much then they could discuss measures to tone them down but that the populations should stay relatively fine due to everything having a limited food and water source.
His voice quivered with fear as the words were spoken.
He debated on poking Harry once more or trying to talk him awake instead and decided on the latter, figuring he’d rather not get bit so early in the morning even if it was an accident. Especially since upon further research he had found that his cousins' venom was quite deadly.
Once they looked around some more Dudley and Harry both expressed an interest in having some kind of shelter created in the new space and were soon kicked out by Umdri who said that he would be more than willing to assist them so long as they let him stay and tend to the grounds while they were on the outside. All three wizards agreed and soon exited the nest. Dudley picked up the pendant and put it on his neck after he grabbed its chain from Snape. Both thanked the professor for the extremely generous gift and thanked him even more when he explained that it was already paid for. Food was the only thought on their minds as Dudley recounted the event of Harry going after a mouse in his human form.
Harry sent out a small hiss at them when either got close and would rub his head against Dudley’s chest right after. With each hiss he sent their way they would flinch more than the last so that it became an odd sort of dance with the three of them. Dudley ignored his parents and focused on Harry’s odd display of affection instead. All of the books he had read and internet searches he had done had given him three answers for the behavior.
So with a deep breath he gathered up the torn pages once more, braced himself for more of her words and was prepared to only stop reading once he was done.
Instead of having normal colored eyes, his were yellow like an owl, with a ring of dark green around them. The Dursley’s told people he wore colored contacts to cover up the abnormality.
“What?” Hary asked through clenched teeth in English. The language sounded foul on his tongue, like week old moldy vegetables that he only ate because he didn’t have anything else available. He much preferred to speak like the snakes that came into Aunt Petunia’s garden, but he also knew the others frowned upon it. They said it was unnatural and horrid, but Harry thought the same thing about English, so he supposed fair was fair.
The letters followed them from his glass tank in the cupboard under the stairs, to the motel two towns over and finally to a rickety shack in the middle of a swamp that Uncle Vernon had somehow found. The letters outshone the fact that it was now his birthday. He wasn’t surprised though since his birthday is forgotten every year. The only good thing about them leaving the house abruptly to escape the letters was that no one had thought to load his tank with them, so he was free to roam around the room in his skin. It only took Dudley seconds to realize that the most integral piece of their lives was missing once Vernon had announced that there were only two beds.
“The knot on it is an iteration of the true love knot. I have a similar one, with an eternity knot instead, on a necklace I constantly wear. I made them myself just before we graduated from Hogwarts and we used them as friendship rings. I thought that you would enjoy having something she used to wear for your birthday.”
“Th- Thank you sir.”
Snape nodded at him as Harry bounced off of the bench to hug the elder, his glasses fell off of his nose and clattered onto the floor as he did so.
Madame Elaine, or who Harry had assumed was her, looked a lot like Dudley’s Aunt Marge if she were as thin as a toothpick. Her attitude however, was the complete opposite of the woman as she smiled kindly at Harry and didn’t comment on his unruly hair. The shop itself looked like a big antique store with baubles and trinkets everywhere. Harry swore he saw a necklace move by itself even though he knew it was impossible. Maybe he really did need glasses?
“Not really, just a reducio and engorgio charm combination, an extension charm and some atmospheric charms for the inside.”
The cousins eventually went their separate ways to explore the shop while the adults talked. Harry had every intention of looking at all the small shiny things. He truly did, until he heard squeaking behind a rather old looking bookcase. He followed the squeaking, vigorously passed old grandfather clocks, through rows of strange globes, and even under a table until he finally cornered the mousey morsel. All of his instincts were telling him that he was hungry, the mouse was food, it’s fresh. While the human part of his brain was screaming at him that was not proper behavior for a boy to do. That mice are not food when he’s human but he’s hungry. He hasn’t eaten anything more than that bit of broccoli from yesterday. He didn’t remember the last time he ate before that. He swiped up the mouse with deft hands and raised it to his mouth, ignoring the fact that it was very much alive and covered in fur. He ignored the footsteps coming from around the corner as he lowered the squirming mouse. He faintly registered Dudley staring at him but couldn’t make out the expression on his face. His only concern was the mouse in his hands and how fast it would take him to eat it.
“Hm? Ah. My apologies, this is my wand. I’m trying to hail the knight bus so that it can take us to diagon alley.”
If you want to skip this then skip the entries: 11-20-1980 and 3-18-1981
Dudley asked in a hushed tone.
Dudley whispered as he pulled the covers over him once he got into bed.
He mumbled out against his pillow after a brief silence. The words came out thick with the general haze of sleep ringing in them.
Harry let out a small huff in response and wished he’d speak to him like he used to before he turned into Vernon’s little soldier. Sure Dudley had been mean to him when his parents were around but that was because Vernon and Petunia were horrible people and could be quite scary to a small child. Before Harry shifted into a snake the first time and bit him for being a dunce though, they used to constantly use snake-speak with each other and ad been quite close when behind closed doors.
Petunia had taken to cooking the others a meal of thick sausage and grits on the stove while Harry snuck in a few pieces of leftover broccoli he had stashed in his pant pockets before they left. His teeth tingle when Dudley suddenly wafted his extra sausage in his face. Both completely aware that Harry wasn’t allowed to eat it as they kept him on a strict vegetable scraps only diet. Which basically meant that whenever Petunia cooked vegetables with their meals, once every few weeks or so, Harry was allowed to eat a few handfuls of whatever they had after the plates had been sitting in the sink and doused in water for rinsing during which most of the scraps were washed down the drain.
“You are aware that you’ll have to catalogue the extension charm correct?”
Came the rather smug reply from the snake, who seemed much more awake than Dudley had thought.
He wasn’t sure how many times he reread the letter until all of the words blurred together; only that when he finally finished he felt his companions staring at him. Harry wasn’t sure what to say to them, but he finally, finally had something that belonged to his mother in words and he didn’t want to let it go even if it was to his odd teacher who was apparently important to her.
Unfortunately, when he asked her why he could change into a snake she just sneered at him and told him it was a repulsive family trait that he got from his mother. Which made his Uncle pipe up that his father wasn’t much better since he was a damn binder. He still wasn’t sure how his father was a stationary item but had just chalked his Uncle’s words up to him being too dumb to comprehend what the adult actually meant.
“Well, it’s just that when I were to eventually change into my snake form then the ring would probably fall off because it’s so small but if you could turn it into a bracelet then it would maybe fit in both of my forms. …I think.”
“Righto Professor Snape!” The man replied quickly and tilted his hat at them as he walked away.
He knew that they had things to work on, certain things Dudley couldn’t do around him without making Harry flinch or flee in terror, and that he would have to learn all of them before Harry felt completely comfortable but this was nice and it was a start.
“So what happens now?”
He sighed in defeat and went to curl up on the floor as Petunia cleaned the dishes, all the while humming an annoying tune. He knew it was a nervous tick of hers from years of exposure to it and that it often meant bad things were about to happen to him. However, nothing did this time, and the other three residents of the creaky cabin lulled themselves to sleep.
Ignoring his companions’ obvious annoyance, Harry moved his mother’s letter to the back of the stack in his hands to see the next one had a date at the top instead of just starting like the previous paper had. Frowning he flicked the top of the new page down to reveal the next also had a date, although different than the first, and soon saw that all of the pages besides the letter had different dates than the previous entry, all of which seemed to be torn from somewhere.
“Harry, this is Slurd. He’s the head goblin at Gringotts and well, I believe it’s best if he explains.”
“Thank you.” Harry replied after he took the envelope.
His eyes weren’t any better unfortunately…
The snake stilled in Dudley’s lap, he really wished they had better facial expressions so he could tell what his cousin was thinking. Knowing that he couldn’t actually see into his cousin’s head he turned his attention to his parents instead. His mother had a thin smile on her face that looked more like a grimace. He was so used to her looking at Harry like that that he never imagined she’d look at him the same way. Nevermind the fact that they had no idea what it meant to be a wizard or what’s expected of them anymore.
“What class do you teach?”
Harry supplied while cautiously eyeing the woman behind the counter.
“Ah! Well then… that is odd. No matter, I shall explain as much as I can to you little cerastes! I am what wizards call a Coco Rumsey Catcher. Although we prefer the term Oruwin. As for what you are little one; you are a horned serpent.”
Though his scar, he thought, was the worst of all. It sat rather proudly on the left side of his forehead, taking up most of it, and looked like a burst of silvery white lightning that even ran down his nose and refused to conform to the rest of his chestnut skin tone. To his misfortune both of these oddities were still present in his snake form, his scar being even more pronounced against his reddish orange scales that looked like fire than on his chestnut skin. It certainly didn't help that his hair refused to cover the cursed thing no matter how long it got and seemed almost personally offended when Harry would try to force it to do so, sticking out even more with renewed static from his hands coursing through the strands and encouraged their defiance.
Dudley watched as Petunia’s face somehow got even redder than his father’s at that. She huffed and glared at him once more only to promptly turn around and went to sit on hers and his dad’s bed. Dudley thought she looked like a five year old child that just got told they wouldn’t be able to get the toy they wanted, or him during last Christmas now that he thought about it. He really should apologize to Harry for literally everything that’s happened in his life so far. It’s funny how one moment in your life could change your entire look on what you’ve done and how utterly wrong you’ve been. His father on the other hand decided that his wife had given up on kicking the strange man out too quickly and decided to make himself look bigger.
Dudley shouted.
His bangs tickled the tops of his eyes, breaking him out of his reverie as he pushed them out of his face for what felt like the tenth time that night. His unruly red hair was a constant problem in his life and no matter how much gel Aunt Petunia tried to slather on it, it always somehow managed to look like the broken bristles of a witch’s broom he had seen in comics in the school newspaper.

Then the walls were closing in around him, squeezing the air out of his lungs—he gasped, acid spilling into his blood as he struggled to inhale, suffocating in the darkness.
Draco smiled softly as the wand responded to his magic. His magic didn’t like his new wand all that much—they didn’t
Harry scoffed. “Would you believe me if I told you I didn’t even know I was a wizard until I got my letter?”
"Let stand until it turns to a mild yellow, then add the moss," Draco instructed, watching as Harry stopped stirring. "Then we'll siphon out the precipitate that forms." The potion slowly shifted from a dark green to a pale, cloudy yellow as it settled.
"No, I'm fine," Harry insisted, "I'm not that tired. We should still go."
Malfoy turned red.
He shoved the note into the pocket of his sweatpants and slid out of bed, carefully arranging the blankets to look as if he were sleeping.
“Uh, maybe eight?” he guessed. “Why does it matter?”
Draco laughed when Harry gave him a look. “Whatever you want to call it…it’s cute, I suppose.”
been okay with it—maybe that was a good sign?
"If everyone would stop getting injured, maybe," Harry laughed.
“I mean, it was tolerable during first year, maybe,” Pansy said, “but once second year came around? And then there was that whole Chamber of Secrets thing, bloody hell,” she and Blaise exchanged a look.
Draco sighed. "As much as it

isn't that right?"
His eyes widened at the implication of what he just said. “I mean, I only paid attention because I wanted to make sure you weren't doing anything sketchy again—” he swallowed. “Not—not that I don’t think you haven’t changed, of course! Because you have, it’s just that—that I wanted to make sure you were okay, like—what if someone was using you, again?”
"I dunno, he's cute, older, interested in me… how do I know if I liked him for the right reasons? And if I
"Oh," a smile slowly spread across Draco's face. "Does that mean you want to keep this up, then?"
"Hey," Harry grabbed his wrist and pulled him close, wrapping his arms around his waist. "It's okay. You just needed time to process."
“Now,” Narcissa said primly, “I trust you two are using protection?”
"C'mon," I'll walk you to your dorm."
“There is

Harry mumbled something into Draco’s shirt, and smiled when he felt Draco’s laugh vibrate his chest. He marveled at the fact that Draco knew exactly the right thing to say to make Harry feel better. Maybe it was because Draco knew him more than Harry even knew himself. It was just like Draco had said—he

I don’t want to talk about it,” Harry stood from his desk abruptly, nearly overturning the chair. He shoved his blank parchment in between the book’s pages and headed for his bed, roughly closing the drapes around him. Sitting on top of his bed sheets, he reapplied his silencing charm and focused on his breathing.
“But—”
“James was

was a bit of an understatement.
Draco wrapped an arm around Harry's waist."Now what?"
Malfoy, shut up!” Harry snapped, looking around for his glasses. There, on the nightstand—no, that was a quill. “Where the hell are my glasses?” He grumbled.
Harry thought ruefully.
"Of course," Harry leaned forward to kiss Draco's nose. "It's a win-win—not only do I sleep better than I would at the Burrow, but I

Harry happily accepted this response and pulled Draco to the sofa to sit and chat with their friends. Draco reluctantly let him—personally, he’d much rather go to their room and snog.
“What’s the book called?” Harry mumbled as he watched Draco open the book.
"Is everything alright, dear?" Mrs. Weasley asked in a hushed voice.
“So, uh…” Harry waited to see if Malfoy would say anything. He debated his options—Malfoy clearly wasn’t interested in discussing anything, so maybe Harry could get away with pretending that none of this had ever happened. However, this was an opportunity that he didn’t think he’d ever have again. And if he didn’t take advantage of it…

“Wait,” Hermione said suddenly, and everyone turned to look at her. “Harry, are you
Malfoy, and we hate each other and shit, but
Harry leaned forward towards the fire and gave a halfhearted shrug. “I think? I don’t know. I don’t know a lot of things. I
Harry took another step forward. He’d already said it; he might as well continue. “Okay?” he asked hopefully.
Harry met Draco outside and handed him one of the plastic bags that contained their food. “Where do you want to eat?” He asked, “we can sit on a bench, or go somewhere else.” He considered inviting Draco to his flat, but then he remembered the disheveled state he’d left it in, and decided against it.
Potter, did you add Irish moss instead of sea moss?" Draco demanded, angrily wiping the potion out of his eyes.
I guess, since you're dead—" he choked on the words and let loose a shuddering sob, burying his face in his hands.
Draco tilted his head. “Fair enough.” He waited for a response that never came. “That was accidental magic, wasn’t it?”
Some etymology behind the Vervé Elixir:

“No!” Harry sighed loudly. “Why does it matter?”
and you won’t even look me in the eye!”
Narcissa studied him for a moment, causing him to squirm. “How long have you been involved with my son?” she asked finally.
Feeling like his heart was about to stop, Draco tilted his face up to kiss him, inhaling sharply at the exhilaration that surged through him. He wrapped his arms around Harry’s shoulders, prompting Harry to curl his free arm around Draco’s waist to pull him close. Draco moved his lips against his after a moment, feeling another rush when Harry slipped his tongue into his mouth. Draco wasn’t sure if he’d made a noise—but if he had, Harry seemed to like it, for he dragged his fingers into Draco’s hair and smiled into the kiss.

Malfoy demanded. “Why can’t you just remove the bond now?”
Harry slowly eased the window shut, wincing at the sound of his joints cracking. He was about to cast a disillusionment charm when his heart nearly stopped at the sight of a shadowy figure sitting in the corner of the library.
“Will
“I thought—” he lowered his hand from his face, shaking slightly. “I thought you didn’t want to, that you’d say no.”
Draco nodded and started drafting a letter. “Thanks.”
"So she figured it out, then," Harry studied the cover Draco was holding, "or at least, she figured
The Manor floorboards seemed to be creak-free, and Harry was able to find Draco's room without making a sound. He tapped lightly on the door, hoping he wouldn't have to knock loudly to be heard.
Surprise flitted across his snake-like face. Of course, he knew that
Potter—
“Oh.” The smile slid off of Draco’s face. “What will happen if—if they don’t react well?”
“Draco,” Harry interrupted, “spit it out.”
Draco shrugged. "Only Pansy came back for eighth year, so she's the only one I've really been speaking to."

"That's alright," Draco gave him a sly grin, carefully folding the arms of the glasses and placing them on Harry's bedside table. "After all, we wouldn’t want them to get smudged again, would we?"
“Huh? No, that’s okay,” he shook his head, “I—well, I like listening to you talk.”

It was just a hickey, though, right? All he had to do was make a mark on his skin. Draco used his lips to make a seal and sucked on his neck. He was vaguely aware of a loud wolf-whistle echoing throughout the room, but all Draco could focus on was hearing Harry’s breath hitch as Draco’s teeth grazed his skin. He used his tongue to swipe over the spot, and—

Harry thought to himself. He recalled how it'd felt to kiss him on the cheek the other night, and felt a rush of adrenaline that took his breath away.

“Because just because there isn’t any pregnancy involved doesn’t mean—”
“That’s it,” Draco stood abruptly, interrupting Blaise before he could continue.  “I’m leaving.”
Malfoy sighed. "I may hate you, but not enough to make you go through this alone." He joined me on the floor, sitting against the opposite wall. "So?" he asked. "Who was your gay awakening?"
Draco marched straight past his dining table and unceremoniously dumped the food onto the coffee table before disappearing into the kitchen. By the time he returned, Harry had settled into the couch and was unwrapping his food.
Draco gave him a smug look. "What makes you sure I missed you?"
"Er, listen," he said again. Now that the adrenaline was wearing off, he was struggling to concentrate. "I... I tried to ignore it," he said finally, looking at his hands. "I thought being on the run would make me forget about it, that it would go away. I thought—"
Hermione took a deep breath, muttering under her breath. “We resolved to keep quiet about this. Let Harry and Malfoy figure it out on their own.”

“You’re sure? But—”

Malfoy swallowed, opening and closing his mouth before opting for a feeble thumbs up.

“If it makes you feel any better, Potter,” Pansy smirked. “Draco here was just as bad, if not worse.”
He nodded quickly and hurried into the hallway, taking the stairs two steps at a time to Draco’s room.

The door opened almost immediately, and Draco quickly grabbed his wrist to pull him inside.
Draco glared at Harry, poking his finger into his chest before curling his hand into a fist. “You know, there are a

Malfoy snapped.

When it finally came out of Draco’s grasp, it was pulled off his body completely, leaving him exposed to the draft that breezed through the cabin. Draco exhaled slowly, trying to maintain his composure as he pulled the blanket back over him. Harry pulled it back almost immediately.

“I’m just—just worried about everyone’s safety.” He cleared his throat. “Yours included. Not that I actually give a damn about you,” he added quickly. “I just…don’t wish you ill. Not anymore.”
“Oh, bugger off,” Harry said good-naturedly, and he settled back into the couch to watch Draco as he took notes.

Harry shut the door behind him, quickly turning on the shower to muffle the sob that escaped him. He
"Ginny?" Harry shook his head, "She knew before I did—that—"
Draco’s mind seemed to short-circuit, and before he even knew what was happening, he was kissing back; soft, gentle, desperate kisses that sent electricity arching down his spine. When Harry bit on his lower lip, he couldn’t help but moan softly into his mouth, threading his fingers through the horribly messy
"Wait, Harry—"
By the time Draco was finished, it was well past curfew—he’d need to borrow Harry’s invisibility cloak to sneak back to his dorm. When he glanced up, he saw Harry still staring into the hearth, his eyebrows furrowed. “Are you okay?” He asked.
“At least take me to dinner first, will you?” He chided, leaning forward until his lips were hovering a mere inch from Draco’s.
were never angry for no reason, and whatever this new emotion was— I could hardly describe it, much less put a name to it.

Harry opened his eyes far too slowly, and he turned to see Hermione, with one hand still on the doorknob and the other over her mouth. “

Now that his hands were free, Harry took the opportunity to pick his glasses off the floor and shove them on his face.
Draco's footsteps fell silently as he approached and knelt at his side, tucking his feet under him. "Potter—" his voice cracked, and he let loose a breathy laugh. "I'm talking to a corpse." He sighed. "

Harry did as he was told, being sure to count on his fingers so he wouldn't lose track. "Then what?"
“Yeah—yeah, there is,” he said shortly, hoping Draco would get the hint. He moved his food wrappers off his lap and started gathering them to throw them out. “Where’s the bin?”
“Yeah, I’d like that,” Harry answered shyly, and added, “I didn’t know you could speak French.”
Harry felt a rush of warmth flow through him, giving him goosebumps and causing his heart to beat faster—in a

"Oh, I left one more present in your room," she said before Draco could leave, "I'd completely forgotten about it until this afternoon."
“You’re insufferable, you know that?” Draco rolled his eyes as they neared the door to their temporary room. “Don’t you ever stop?”
"That

"Why isn't it fair, Potter?" Draco asked smugly.
Draco shrugged. “She found my porn stash in fifth year.”
“Alright, students. Form a single file line and follow me.” Headmistress McGonagall had a thin layer of magic covering her mouth and nose, resembling a muggle medical mask. Everyone frantically gathered their things to follow her. A few students attempted to joke about the situation, but they fell short.
Harry managed to grab his wrist, forcing him to face him. "Listen—" If he didn't get this out now—

Panic flitted across Potter’s face, and he quickly turned and hurried out of the bathroom. “Let’s get ready for dinner,” he said.

to be that aggressive?”
Harry opened his eyes, blinking blearily as the angry silhouette beside him shoved at his chest. To Draco’s dismay, Harry responded by pulling him closer, wrapping both arms around his shoulders and tucking his face against Draco’s collarbone before heaving a great sigh. If Draco didn’t know any better, he would’ve thought it sounded quite content.
"How long do you think we can keep this up?"
"I thought you'd be jumping at the chance to get away from the ferret," Ron snorted. "Which, why haven't you mentioned that in any of your letters?" He leaned forward in his chair, lowering his voice. "What's it like, being in close proximity to him and all of his
