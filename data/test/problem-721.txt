Looking out over the students, Albus frowned once again. Harry Potter was not in the Great Hall. The boy had also been absent for every meal since he refused to help the boy after he had sex with Ginny. He hadn't expected the boy to come up to his office and had been worried the plan had fallen through, upon hearing the boy's story he relaxed. The boy should have been grateful, Albus thought to himself. The idea had been for Ginny to seduce Harry, Molly had improvised, and Albus approved.
"That's Baise Zabini." Hermione sat down in front of them, cutting off their view of the Slytherin table.
"Harrison James Potter." Draco pulled back and pulled Harry with him, both of them coated in snow, their clothes a bit disarray from the tickling and rolling on the ground.
"Still ignoring us?!" Hermione put her nose high in the air and slapped him, the sound was sharp. "Well?!" She screeched. Harry just at unresponsive, his eyes looking up to make eye contact with the pale blue eyes of the blonde vampire who stared back. Something tight constricted in Harry's chest.
"Until next time." Draco kissed Harry deeply, leaving Harry panting heavily. With a flick of his wand their messes in their pants before smirking. "You know, those bruises are fetching on you." Draco teased with a smirk and a raised eyebrow.
"He deserved it!" Hermione screeched. The Slytherins glared at the two Gryffindor's and smirked when Snape gave them detentions and took twenty points, each, before levitating Harry and Ron down to the Hospital Wing. He told his students to start on the Potion written on the board before leaving with the stunned and unconscious students trailing behind him.
"Yes, remember, we will break it when we both get what we want," Draco promised before scowling at him.
"We want to fulfill the contract." Draco was hesitant, he was more than aware that his father was not a fan of Harry nor was their Lord.
"Lovegood, a long history of seers correct?" Draco knew he wouldn't get an answer, seers didn't have it easy, people sought them out to just use them. "Well Luna Lovegood, I do wish you a pleasant day." He turned on his heel and raced to the seventh floor, following the girl's riddle of directions. He walked in front of the wall he was told and quickly raced into the room that appeared. The room shifted around him and the once office was a comfortable room with a large couch, which Harry was sat on.
The courtroom was full; every Wizengamot member present counting to about sixty men and woman. Hermione Granger was sat in the chair before the whole court, chains wrapped around her. The stupify was canceled, and she sagged in the chair. Nervous air radiated out of her every pore. She glared hatefully at Lucius Malfoy, who was stood leaning his hip against a table that had a file, and some notes are strewn across it.
"Hello, Narcissa." Harry accepted the hug hesitantly, tensing when the woman's arms tightened around him.
Several minutes later and Harry's magic settled, his voice cracking before finally giving out. His nails were caked with blood and his magic was tired. He let himself be pulled into a chest before he promptly fell asleep,
"You're safe now Harry, we will not hurt you here. I will try with all my power to see that those responsible are punished accordingly.
Cedric's smile faltered for a second before he looked at Harry intently. "M'Harry Potter, I do-don't have a house yet." Harry was mildly confused about why Cedric stilled minutely before smiling again.
Harry didn't know what happened, why it was happening or what he was supposed to do. "Do you...." Harry felt a blush crawl up his neck. "Want to hurt me?"
Harry cried, sobbing into his hands while fearing for his unborn baby's life. After a few seconds of quivering on the floor, he shakily stood on jelly legs and quickly summoned his belongings, again falling and crying before calling for Dobby.
"Men cannot be raped! He should have liked it!" She struggled to say the words; it was clear to all those that she fundamentally believed men could not be raped but knew Harry did not want or like what had occurred after the memory cut off. "If he had just slept with her the first time she offered none of this would have happened!"
Harry shook slightly, leaning into Severus' side as the frozen body of Ginny was settled in the chair and the chains wrapped around her like snakes.
"I don't know where you got that idea, Miss. Weasley but Heir Black and Malfoy have had a marriage contract between them since before either of them was born." Lucius' smooth voice drifted over all the teens as he walked past the Gryffindors and towards his son. "Draco, Harrison Potter, are you both ready for the lunch we have planned?" He lifted an eyebrow at his son and nodded when Draco offered an arm for his boyfriend? Sub?
." The hat's voice was projected inside Harry's skull and he was curious about how that was possible and made a note to look into it later when he had the time and the right book.
Draco let the Gryffindor cry into his shoulder for a few more minutes, smiling sadly when he pulled back and wiped at his cheeks and avoiding eye contact.
"Mister Potter? Can you hear me?" Fingers snapped in front of his eyes and he turned to look upon his Potion's Professor, Severus Snape. He blinked owlishly before nodding slowly, his mind was still muggy and clouded. "What happened?" He asked in a calm tone that Harry had no idea the man was capable of.
The room was silent as Fudge called the trial into order and swore himself in. Amelia immediately stepped forward, eyes hard as steel as she gazed at the redheaded girl before her. The first few questions were slow, Ginny answering with insults to Madam Bones and Barrister Malfoy. After a vote, a truth serum was forced down her throat. Harry hid his face in Severus' chest, attempting to block out most of the questions and answers, he didn't want to hear her excuses, no matter her reasonings he raped him, he would never forgive her.
"Will you, my lovely Sub, let me take you on dates, buy you anything you wish for, kiss you whenever we want, make love to you in the future and fulfill this contract that my father made for us?"
"Y-Yes...." Potter's voice was thick with emotion that caused the paternal instinct in Lucius to awaken. He quickly kneeled in front of the teen - has been always been this small? - and made small relaxing noises.
The words caused some concern for most of the adults in the room, especially Madam Bones, who was careful to keep her next words calm. "Is there anywhere else you can go?"
"Draco!" Harry giggled, turning around to wrap his arms around Draco's neck loosely, blushing when Draco smirked down at him. A silent second later and Harry pulled Draco down for a chaste kiss.
Harry felt a large, uncontrollable smile spread along his face. "Do you know something I don't know?"
Harry quickly got to his feet and trailed silently behind the tall man, finding immediate comfort when he entered the office. Â He relaxed immediately, his shoulders slumping and he sighed, relief flooding him. At first, he didn't understand why he was so relieved but after a few seconds of thought, he realized it was the first time he had felt safe after the night before. The dorm was like the murder scene, the common room just filled him with anxiety. In classes, he was forced to be next to the people who helped someone hurt him in the worst way possible. The Great Hall was full of anxiety because of his - former? - friends watched him closely and tried to talk to him while the Headmaster seemed to bore into his soul with criticism and disappointment.
"You're not my girlfriend." Harry furrowed his eyebrows at the anger that crossed Ginny's, Hermione's and Ron's faces. "I never asked you out nor did you ask me and even if you did I wouldn't say yes." Harry pulled his arm back to his chest. He took a few steps back.
The Twins, Neville, Dean, and Seamus looked alarmed while the other three looked near panic. A quick exit for the two youngest Weasley's and Hermione later, Harry was too tired to answer more questions.
Only a few moments later and Lucius grew impatient. "What is this business?" He inquired professionally.
"I'd buy it." Draco gripped Harry's hips and rolled them over, smiling when Harry shouted his name before breaking down in giggles, his wild raven hair standing out against the perfect white snow. "Anything for you." He whispered softly.
"I haven't finished my History of Magic essay, but it isn't due for two more days," Harry was quick to explain himself, having seen the softer side of the professor he found himself wishing to please the man. He wanted to make him proud. He was his hero, after all.
Harry blushed under the scrutiny. "I don't have one..... I was kinda hoping you'd know how to get attention, being
"Harry Potter!" The slightly smaller man of the two gushed had been a while since Harry had met an adult who was in awe of his moniker. "It is an honor to meet you!" The man shoved his hand forward to grasp the young boy's, shaking it roughly without blinking for several moments.
Fudge was slumped in his chair, this case was the highest-profile trial he knew he would ever sit, it was clear that Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, had been dealt an extremely unjust hand but Fudge knew convicting Albus Dumbledore would be a challenge, getting him in Azkaban, and kissed would be even harder. He hoped Lucius was ready, if Lucius won, the Wizarding World would be changed forever.
"Father! Tippy said I could find you in he-" Draco's joyous voice was abruptly cut off. "WHAT IS THAT HALFBLOOD SCUM DOING HERE?!" He shouted in outrage. His son's outburst seemed to be the breaking point because the raven-haired teen snapped, his magic suffocated the room, his sobs and screams were deafening. Everything in the room was thrown into the air and the temperature fluctuated between freezing and boiling temperatures.
"Oh, Merlin! Pl-Please- Oh God!" Harry whined, his fingers tugging on Draco's hair, his head thrown back, exposing his neck to the Slytherin.
"And if I asked for something crazy, something that is extremely expensive?" Harry let one hand twirl around one of the blond locks that fell out of place.
Draco chose to be silent instead of answering. He closed his eyes and rubbed his temples. Severus just left the pint on the desk before leaving the room. A dangerous second later and Draco sipped the blood greedily. It was the best he had ever tasted, sweet, rich, thick, warm and so very good Draco moaned as he savored each gulp. He was disappointed when it was all gone. His knowledge of who the blood came from didn't change his body from craving it, begging for it nor his body for singing in joy when he got to taste it.
Draco sat up, too tired to really think about his father's question. "Not much, he didn't like talking about it. All I knew was that Black had promised to take him away from it after fifth year I think it was. Harry said that they had all their things ready, for Black to be pardoned but that Black was killed a few days before their appointment with Amelia Bones." Draco yawned. "Why do you ca-care?" Draco yawned again.
Harry sighed before standing and nodding his thanks to Snape before calmly leaving the room, his anger washed away as tears slipped down his cheeks. He slowly made his way into the Gryffindor common room, thankfully everyone was already asleep so he easily walked up the stairs before he slipped into bed, welcomingÂ Morpheus' embrace.
He understood now that if he had grown up catered to by elves and was taught that they were less than him and his own servant was freed from him by the kid that had killed the one man that could kill and torture his family he would have been pretty upset too. "I want to press charges," Harry admitted pitifully.
"You should go to him, he is your Submissive and it bound to be distressed right now. I know you hate him but you'll have to get over it. This contract supports a healthy relationship, for both of you." Pansy tried to comfort him, smiling sadly.
"Are you telling me that I- that I-" Draco stilled, tears dripping down his face as he gasped. "I crucioed him." Draco raised his hand to his mouth. "He said he didn't cheat, that-that-" Draco flew from his bed, struggling to dress as he stumbled out of the room.
"You'd think with all the reading you do you'd have been able to translate Parseltongue and learn to speak it." Ron retorted sarcastically.
They entered the room, everyone staring at them. They scowled at each other before walking to the sides of the room, sitting as far away from each other as possible. "Why'd you arrive with Malfoy?!" Ron hissed in anger, his face as red as his hair.
"It really is Harry! But why were you at the hospital? A normal scan can alert you of that." George questioned.
"Mr. Weasley were you aware that your friend Ms. Granger was going to receive money and books from Mr. Potter's family vaults in return for her part in the plan to 'get Harry under control'?"
Instead of stupifying the boy the Aurors just let the chains fall and lifted the boy to his feet and took his arms and led him from the room.
"Hagrid picked me up to take me shopping, he isn't a Head and I never got those. If it wasn't for Mrs. Weasley I'd never had even gotten onto the platform, Hagrid didn't tell me how to get on."
"We'll be late for Transfiguration if we don't leave soon." Harry felt flushed, even though he liked Ron he didn't think Ron would ever be able to kiss him like that.
Draco wanted to drink and drink until there was nothing left but he was already full and content. He pulled his fangs out and kitten licked the puncture wounds closed. He sighed happily, nuzzling where the wounds once were. Harry panted heavily, coming down from the euphoria as he sagged against the vampire.
"You are, unfortunately, correct. I will go seek out that men-" He exhaled sharply through his nose. "I can't even bloody well insult him!" He glared at everyone as he strode out of the common room in search for Harry.
- The Dominate is allowed to punish his Submissive for disobeying the rules as long as the punishment
"I couldn't sleep, love." Lucius smiled at his wife. She only hummed in understanding before venturing further into the room to sit on one of the many armchairs across from her husband. "Did my absence wake you?"
"Y-" Draco noticed the tears and the voice crack and felt terrible for assuming what he had. His soon to be Submissive was hurting, even if he really didn't care he knew that if he wanted their relationship to be believable at any rate and for there to be any foundation for their relationship he needed to start acting now. He slowly approached the shaking Submissive, wrapping his arms gently around his shoulders and lowering them to the cold ground. He pulled the smaller of the two into his lap and made comforting noises and rubbing his back. "Shhhhh, Sub you've done nothing wrong. I am at fault. I did not think of those situations and you did well by bringing them to my attention." He praised, pulling back a bit to thumb the tears away from the soft cheeks.
look me in the eyes when I talk to you Mister Potter," Snape demanded and Harry let out a nervous, emotional exhale before meeting the eyes of the dour man, gasping when he felt something that he could only describe as someone poking his brain. A second later, memories began to flash in front of his mind and much to his horror the memory from the night before started to play in his head.
"Your grandfather is Lord Black, the first one born and the last from the original line of Blacks. My wife and her sisters are from the second line. He blood adopted you, making him 1/3 of your parents. He has no children so you're is Heir."
"Shhh child, you are safe here," Severus reassured Harry - who was steadily on his way to a panic attack - and sent a look to both of the Malfoy men.
"He lied to you Draco, to all of us." Lucius stood and settled down next to his son, pulling him onto his lap like he did when his son was younger. "It is okay Son, we can work through this." Lucius rubbed his son's back gently, mentally smirking as his plan unfolded beautifully.
"I have a question though, I've wondered since the first year but what are Muggle-borns exactly?" Harry felt a bit stupid when both Malfoy's looked at him oddly. "I mean when two magical people have kids they have magic or are squibs but squibs have magic but can't access it. So if Muggles don't have magic at all how can they give birth to someone who has magic.
He stepped out of the fireplace with just enough time to catch Harry as he flew out of the fireplace, soot covered his robes and face while not even a speck hovered around Severus' personal space.
"Why not?" Neville asked curiously. "They aren't that bad, I mean they are pretty good compared to a lot of other contracts out there. Whoever made it obviously wanted you two to be in a healthy relationship. There is no possibility for abuse, no cheating, no manipulations, he will care for you, protect you, provide for you! I mean I wouldn't be concerned. He loves his magic too much to not follow the rules." Neville blushed when he realized everyone was looking at him.
Harry flinched at the voice raise. Shrinking away from Draco but was stopped by the tightening arms around his waist. "I-I j-just...." He felt tears in his eyes again and wanted to die right then and there. "I'm sorry."
"I could hex her," Draco growled, twirling Harry around and clasping their hands together and tugging him along down the aisle. "Nosey, pug-faced Parkinson, always sticking her bloody nose in my business." Draco piled all the Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Chocoballs, Cockroach Clusters, and a few packages of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans.
with you just because you don't look like your dad. If anything you lookÂ like the boy version of your mum. I've seen a picture or two of them in textbooks. She had red hair and green eyes like yours." Cedric offered with an encouraging smile. "When did you run into Mr. Hagrid? He's the gamekeeper here."
"Hi!" The other boy chuckled to himself. "I've lost my manners, my name is Cedric Diggory, I'm a third-year Hufflepuff." The boy leaned forward and offered his hand. Harry shook back weakly, again embarrassed that he was so weak he couldn't even grip someone's hand.
"When you don't have an obnoxious, red head plastered to your side or a haughty muggle-born behind you, you really look beautiful." Draco wanted more than anything to close the small space between their lips but held off, not wanting to assault the other teen.
Harry and Draco must return to school, and Harry has to act like nothing is wrong so word does not get to Dumbledore about the upcoming trial before anything has been set in motion.
Going to bed every night in the giant Manor alone had been terrifying for Harry, he curled tightly under his blankets, desperate to hide from the nightmares that always found him. Without arms to secure him he woke four to five times a night gasping for breath with tears streaming down his face. Although he missed Draco a great deal Harry yearned for Professor Snape even more. The man had been his first savior, had provided a safe place, and had taken him to get help.
It was only three days before the trial started, Amelia Bones and Lucius Malfoy had spent those days planning out the questions they would ask each Gryffindor. There was some debate on whether or not to have Harry present at the trial, with the memories and hopefully veritaserum, and there would be no need for Harry to testify. However, if the use of veritaserum led down other criminal paths, then having Harry nearby to question may be useful. It was decided that Harry would sit in the gallery with an adult.
"Professor Dumbledore did not say." She spat, gleeful as being able to keep some part of the man's plan hidden.
"This is terrible Harry! We've got to get you out of this!" Ginny leaned forward and set her hand on Harry's thigh, it made him a bit uncomfortable.
Harry couldn't help but to arch his back at the feeling, he let out airy pants and breathy moans every other second. He clawed at Draco's shoulder blades. He gasped for breath and whined when the arms around his waist tightened like coiling snakes. "D-Dra-Draco!" Harry shouted, gripping the cloth between his fingers until they went numb.
"Glad you could join us Mister Potter." Snape drawled, the doors slamming against the stone causing all the students in the room to turn and look at him. He saw Ron glaring at him, cheeks red with anger. Hermione looked disappointed in him and a bit angry, she turned up her nose at him and turned away with her arms crossed over her chest. "Would you like to explain to the class why you are fifteen minutes later Mister Potter?" His voice was quiet and slow but Harry heard every word.
"Okay." Harry shifted his weight slightly before leaning forward and resting his head against Draco's shoulder, letting himself relax. "Can we take a nap? I don't want to be tiredÂ when we have astronomy later."
"Child neglect and accessory to rape for Albus Dumbledore. Child endangerment, aiding and abiding rape, attempted line theft for Molly Weasley. Accomplice to second-degree assault and conspiracy for murder for both Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley. Rape attempted line theft and conspiracy for murder for Ginerva Weasley." Lucius watched the anger and horror etch itself into the lines of Amelia's face.
"Would you two quit it? You're in public Draco, you'd do well to act like it." Pansy hissed at him, glaring at Harry, snatching a quill from their basket and walking past them, shoving Harry to the side.
He froze. "No, no, no, no, no, no, no!" He pulled a picture from the file and felt his mouth go dry. It was of Potter's body. Scars and burns, words and bruises married his body, overlapping until only small patches of skin hadn't been scarred.
A few seconds later and Harry's fingers inched up from his chest to wrap around Draco's shoulders, his forehead falling and resting on Draco's shoulder. Draco felt the hunger grow the closer and longer he stayed next to Potter. He felt his fangs elongate and he dragged the across the warm flesh, smirking when Potter shivered and goosebumps trailed down his shoulder.
"Don't be so sure Potter, I am not a virgin like you are, I still have needs-" Draco froze when panic glowed in Harry's eyes and the body in his lap went still and the glass in the room shattered. "I won't touch you without your permission Harry. I'm not a monster." He felt outraged that Harry would think such things. "Why would you ever think I would do such things!?"
Draco paused to check the girl out silently. "You are?" he asked icily. She just giggled behind her hand.
"I'll find you for the next feeding." Draco promised before slipping into the shadows and disappearing from the hidden room.
"Take as much as you need," Harry whispered, his fingers clenching the front of Draco's robes tightly as he stirred in suspense. Draco just nuzzled the crook of Harry's neck, breathing in the scent of Harry, his lungs filled and his nose sang in delight. He tugged his classmate closer, holding the smaller body close and tight.
Harry slowly turned around, eyeing the alcoves in the corridor or places he could hide behind when Draco curses him with some dark curse that is father taught him. "Malfoy," Harry responded hesitantly eyeing Draco up and down.
"Could we read it before it is made official?" Harry was tired and he knew that Potion was going to start soon.
"I don't care how much you hate me Draco or why you hate me but I will not let you die. If that means waiting until you are on the brink of death and forcing you to drink my blood then so be it!" Harry growled. "I don't care if you hate my blood, it's the only kind you got right now." Harry puled his hand back before striding out of the office, tears slipping down his cheeks again.
"We're wizards, Harry." Draco teased as he dragged his wand along the rips and watching in satisfaction as the fabric stitched itself together perfectly. "Perfect, just like you. Now, let' finish you getting ready." Draco stood and pulled Harry with him, thumbing away the tears before leaning forward and pressing a chaste kiss on Harry's forehead. "Now if we could only fix that hair of yours."
"Good," Lucius smirked at the gaping faces in front of his. "You don't really think the contract was fake, did you? Your mother and I set up the contract the day after we married. We assumed that Regulus would have an Heir." He frowned. "He died shortly after the contract was made."
He thought in embarrassment, turning around an scooting out from under the sink, standing unevenly as he continued to laugh humorlessly, tears still staining his cheeks.
Severus was a bit worried, not that he'd admit that to anyone, but the child seemed to be drifting out of reality. He realized it might be a coping mechanism, detaching himself from reality as to not deal with the trauma and pain that settled itself on his mind but it was unhealthy and as much as he hated to admit it the past few hours had changed his opinion on the teen. He no longer saw his enemy's son, he saw a small child, broken and damaged from life, and he felt a kind of kinship that he felt with Draco.
"You, Potter, are by far the best virgin I have ever touched," Draco whispered in Harry's ear, his lips brushing against the sensitive skin, a smirk playing on his lips.
Harry opened his mouth to say something, everyone was on the edge of their seats when he closed it again and shook his head silently. He stood and went to turn away only to be yanked back and forced to sit. Sharp nails dug into his arm and he winced. "Hiya Harry!" Ginny's voice pierced the silent air that hung in the Great Hall like thick drapes.
Severus could only sigh when he saw the nearly collapsed child slumped against the tub; saliva dribbled down his chin, the stench of vomit made it clear what had happened just before the child passed out. Flushing the loo Severus crouched down next to the small fourteen-year-old, he pulled out a handkerchief and wiped away the sweat and saliva before casting a breath-freshening charm on the Gryffindor. He gave some thought before decided the Muggle way would do, he slid his arms under the boy and rose, grimacing at the popping his joints gave, he was getting too old for this Severus thought as he settled the boy on the bed.
The court was abuzz with whispers and hushed conversations. The lack of a defense team for all the underage witches and wizards was causing quite the stir, in the folder laid out in front of them were signed contracts were they all agreed for no defense, believing themselves, no doubt, to be able to get off scot-free on their own. It was highly inadvisable but not uncommon, it was shocking for the purebloods to know that neither Aruther nor Molly Weasley had been able to convince, if they even tried, their children to get a barrister. They could be appointed for free if the family hadn't been able to afford it.
what Harry wanted if his facial expression and body language were anything to go by. "Because I was looking forward to going further with you," Draco smirked at the blush on his lover's cheeks. "A lot further."
"Yes, well do come in. Tea?" He asked and when Severus nodded he snapped his fingers and ordered Tippy - a house elf - to prepare tea for three and set it up in the largest office he had. "Follow me, gentlemen." Lucius led them to his main office, easily bigger than the dorm rooms by itself. There was one large oak desk, two armchairs in front of it. Off to the left side of the room was a sitting area surrounding a modest fireplace. To the right side of the room was a flooing fireplace with another set of chairs and couches.
"You know you don't have to say things like that, no one is even around." Harry panted softly, his nose a little red from the cold.
"Harry would be my brother-in-law, no one would refuse my applications as best friend and brother-in-law to the Boy-Who-Lived." The answer brought on a few moments of silence. The answer was childish and full of grandeur but there wasn't exactly evidence of Ron planning of knowing what had happened, if anything it seemed like the boy had been slightly manipulated into his part of the plan.
"Severus! I need blood replenishers!" Draco's voice called out. Harry slipped in eyelids closed and what could have been seconds or hours later he felt a vial at his lips. He absentmindedly opened his mouth and he felt a large, warm, hand massage his throat to aid the cold liquid down his throat.
"Come closer," Draco smirked when Harry easily slid under his arm and snuggled back into his chest. "Just like that, my Sub." He purred his praise, holding Harry close as they both drifted to sleep.
"Legal matters, I'm afraid." Sitting up straighter Amelia pulled out a bank file and waited for the man before her to list the basic details to copy it and put it in the system. "On behalf of my client, Harry Potter, I would like to press charges against Albus Dumbledore, Molly Weasley, Ronald Wesley, Ginerva Weasley, and Hermione Granger."
"Get your hands off of me!" Potter hissed, struggling weakly, still in pain even though the damage was gone.
"Good news, the baby is healthy and fine, a bit shook up but overall is very healthy." The tan Medi-witch with dark hair smiled sadly at him before turning to her working.
It was then that Harry snapped back to reality and everything came into sharp focus. He twirled around and immediately straddled Draco's hips, surprising his classmate and his teacher. "Are you okay!? When did you become a vampire!? Why weren't you feeding!? Are you still hungry!?" He looked at Draco's face, forgetting the Potion Master still in the room.
"Things normal couples do. Hold hands, dates, kiss. Most couples don't do this but as it is a contract I am officially courting you as well. It's a pureblood custom. One that Malfoy's still upholding."
"I have to Ron." Harry sighed heavily, disappointed that Ron hadn't noticed him in a romantic any more than before and it's been an entire month.
"I deserved to be Lady Potter!" She shouted after Madam Bones asked why she raped Harry Potter. "He could never do better than me!" She was red in the face as she screamed. "I deserved that money! I want to be Lady Potter!"Â It was silent as the Wizengamot took in her answers. Many were horrified and outraged.
"Thank you, Lucius, good night Harry, Draco." Severus nodded to the two teens before following his long time friend out of the library.
"Lucius, we have business to discuss. Harry here thought you'd be a better option to consult with to Madam Bones with this particular situation." Severus watched interest spark the silver/pale blue eyes of his long time friend.
"Can I sit here?" A warm, kind, voice asked from the left. Harry turned to the compartment door to see a tall boy with a perfect smile looking at him questioningly.
Ron was released quickly and lost another twenty points from Poppy Pomfrey while the Medi-Witch fussed over Harry.
"I would like to ask the court for permission to perform the pregnancy confirmation spell," Malfoy spoke, secretly amused when the Weasley girl hissed in rage, eyes burning as she shook in an attempt to free herself of the chains. The court voted in favor of his request, Lucius was pleased he could get an answer for the child in the gallery.
Harry saw Draco walk out of the Great Hall. He quickly shoved two forkfuls of mash potatoes into his mouth before standing. "I forgot my Potions homework, I'll meet you guys there."
Every few years, there was someone who needed to be separated from the house for some length of time. Sometimes it was just for a few weeks while someone grieved the loss of a loved one, for protection if an inter-house argument ended up in injury, or back when his uncle had gone to school, a betrothed couple had to fulfill a part of the contract if they still hadn't graduated yet.Â Betrothal contracts now were less popular, purebloods still used them occasionally, but with the last few years, blood-adoptions had skyrocketed, and the need for contracts to get heirs fell out of fashion.
Before Harry could even begin to formulate a response his mouth was full of tongue and wet heat. Harry practically melted, only being held up by Draco's arms and the sheer determination to never let the lips leave his own.
"Flattery will get you nowhere Mister Malfoy." Harry blushed as he moved past Draco in the narrow aisles. "I'm never going to eat all of those," Harry whined playfully when he felt Draco's arms wrap around his midsection and pull him back gently, laughing gently in his ear.
Harry noticed Ron, Ginny and Hermione freeze and look at each other in panic. "What Muggle-born pamphlets? I didn't get any."
He sniffed pathetically, flashes of red hair and a freckled smile taunted him as his heart seemed to ache in his chest. He was too preoccupied with his thoughts that he didn't hear the door open or the sound of shoes on the tile.
"Yes Harry, Sir! Dobby serves yous!" Dobby answered quickly before stifling a scream when he took in his Master's condition.
"I'm s-sorry Sev, I ju-just..... I thought you'd know what I should do." Harry had settled down a few minutes earlier after drinking a modified calming draught for pregnant witches and wizards.
"Detention." Harry tried to blink the darkness from the corners of his vision. A few seconds - minutes - later Harry felt his body being gently placed on soft cushions and his body being embraced in a warmth he hadn't experienced before.
Then his luck ran out. Harry was in the process of giving a pint when Draco stormed into the room, anger rising when he saw the scene before him. "THIS IS WHERE YOU'VE BEEN GETTING THE BLOOD!" Draco roared.
"Are you okay?!" Harry kneeled next to his Slytherin rival while he turned the weak boy on his back.
I care about enough to chase." Draco crowded into Harry's space again. "I wasn't planning on seeing anyone else. Just you." Draco promised, gripping Harry's hips and picking him up and pushing him against the stall, grinding into Harry's hips after Harry wrapped his legs around Draco's hips.
"No, Dad, I did. I let him here, I purposed to him when all he wanted was our money." Draco growled.
Potions was better than usual, entirely because Severus ignored him instead of lashing out at him, he verbally flayed Ron and Seamus, both ruined the points with their partners Hermione and Dean respectively. Harry was partnered with Neville, and while that usually meant the focus of Snape's attention, Harry worked hard to keep Neville for ruining the Potion, and with Draco not trying to sabotage, Harry was successful. However, the liquid was a few shades lighter than intended; it was one of the top potions in the class. Professor Snape had kept his face blank but let his tone reluctantly admit their Potion was 'adequate' before sweeping over to the other Gryffindor potions and banishing them away with a snarl of 'pathetic.'
"She is of Prewett blood; they were always very fertile."Â They both paused. "However you are right, if Harry is as miserable as you say, no doubt more than even you would have noticed, I cannot justify keeping him in such a state to avoid some favors. I will talk to Amelia tonight, tell Harry that he should expect to be taken out of school before classes start, I will be there to invite him back to the Manor formally, his lack of talk about family concerns me, I don't believe he wants to be with them."
"I knew we would find them in here," Lucius smirked at his son and his new quest. He knew his son and the gleam in his eyes was something that Lucius knew he had had for Narcissa back in his school days. One day, and soon, Harry Potter would find that there was another side of DragonisÂ Lucius Malfoy.
"Get a room!" Harry and Draco turned to see a large group of people. Ginny, Ron, and Hermione. Next to them were scowling Slytherins, Theo, Blaise, Pansy, Daphne, Crabbe, and Goyle.
"Bye Harry." Hermione waved but Ron just continued to eat and stare at their other friend, Harry frowned but quickly hurried out of the Hall.
Breakfast was almost over when the group of men and women flooded the Great Hall. "Albus Dumbledore, you are hereby under arrest for accessory to rape and child neglect ." Gasps and cries sounded all over the hall. The professors could only gape at their boss as he was slapped with magic suppressing cuffs and pulled from his throne. "Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley, you are hereby under arrest for conspiracy for murder and being an accomplice to second-degree assault." The two fourth-years protested as they too were taken out in cuffs. "Ginerva Weasley, you are under arrest for rape, attempted line-theft, and conspiracy for murder." The hall was silent as the redhead was hauled out with the others. "Now, Professor McGonagall, would you let us into the Gryffindor Tower, we need to speak with Harry Potter."
"The dark Slytherin." Harry didn't point but he nodded in the general direction of the Slytherin table, taking a bite of the mash potatoes on his plate.
"Because I refuse to be the submissive, it is this or Ron will marry that Muggle-born." Draco taunted the idea in front of him had tears immediately burned his eyes.
"I'll tell you later." Harry clenched his jaw and glared at the back of Malfoy's head. "You're not going to like it." He warned under his breath as McGonagall tutted softly until the class quieted down.
The bell rang, and Harry took his time to pack up his belongings, tensing when Ron virtually dragged Hermione out of the room to get to lunch faster. Neville walked out with Dean and Seamus, a curious glance cast at Harry as he went. No doubt, the shy boy had wanted to ask why he had been absent from the tower for the weekend but had kept quiet throughout the class for fear of taking his attention off the Potion for even one second.
"I want a trial," Harry said immediately. "If people were forced to vote on charging Dumbledore they would vote in favor of him." Harry continued, voice only slightly wavering. "I don't like the idea of those memories being put on a show but it is needed - and I know that - if I want them to pay for what they did to me."
Sweeping over the rambunctious students his gaze landed on Ginny, she was whispering to her brother and Hermione; the girl was no doubt excited to be the future Lady Potter. In just two days, she would get find out if she was pregnant, to avoid questions from Poppy about pregnant thirteen-year-old girls Molly would floo it to do the spell herself. The Prewett Women had always been fertile; Ginny would likely be the same.
"Answer my questions and you can," Draco responded, sitting up straighter, his hold looser than before.
"Well...." A dusting of pink on the pale face caused a moment of attraction in Harry's chest but he forgot it when he remembered Ron's smile. "We're going to have to fake a relationship."
"That was the effect of your words," Severus said with a clipped tone, pleased when all Draco could do was gape with wide eyes.
! Why does my crying-in-a-bathroom concern Draco fucking Malfoy for?!" He pulled his arm out of the harsh grasp forcefully, going to stomp out o the bathroom only to be shoved, and held, against the stone wall, his head slamming against the wall with a loud 'crack'.
pregnant, they are both very young." Severus dearly wished the little chit wasn't pregnant; Harry would be devastated no doubt if the worst moment of his life brought forth an everlasting product.
"So if someone bound you and drugged you with a modified version of a love potion that kept you aware of everything but unable to control your own body and proceeded to have sexual relations with your unwilling self without your ability to stop it, all in the name of her getting pregnant with your child to later kill you in some way in order to obtain all your money, what do you call that?" Severus watched Draco heatedly, waiting for a response.
"Mr. Potter, I know you've been through a traumatic experience, the Board of Governors, and I believe it would be in your best interest if you took a break from school, saw a mind healer." Her voice was gentle, but the words caused a panic in Harry.
"I get the gross picture you're painting." Harry chuckled at his own joke and brushed off the glare that the blond sent him. "But how? It will make no sense to do it randomly and everyone will suspect it false."
"Hey, Potter!" Draco's voice shouted and Harry paused in the corridor. A quick scan of the surroundings made Harry aware that no one else was around to witness anything that Draco might do.
Lucius couldn't help his good mood, his son returning to him and asking to stay home for a few days was the best thing to happen to him in a long time. He sat in his office, savoring two fingers of elven wine as more plans formed in his mind. He had to keep the Potter slut from his son in all ways. No letters, no floo calls, no meeting.
With some reflection, Harry didn't fully understand why he was so incapable of keeping his opinion or thought to himself when in the magical world, he grew up quiet, never saying anything, in the Muggle world for fear of punishment. If he said anything to get the trial known to Dumbledore before the trial was announced to him by the Ministry, then he would have time to call in bribes to get himself and his partners off easy.
"Was this a one-one t-time thing?" Harry asked shyly, embarrassed and a little scared that everything would go back to how it was before and he didn't want that. He wanted more, more with Draco.
over the world either sent troops of people to help and almost everyone was involved. Anyways there was a man, he believed that everyone who was Jewish - Jewdism is a type of religion and if you practiced it then you were Jewish - should die because he thought they were below him. He wanted perfect people to breed with perfect people. He didn't want Jews to breed with other humans so he built armies of soldiers called 'Nazi's' and they gathered all the Jews into concentration camps where they were forced to do manual labor if they were physically well enough and if they were they were sent into what was basically a giant oven and they were burned alive.
Realization dawned on Draco. "Harry-Harry look at me, there, now let me tell you something. You're not like the others. They were just there because they wanted me and it was convenient." Draco almost smacked himself when Harry just seemed to close down even more. "Harry you are the only one who
"Not that either." Draco lowered his free hand to brush his knuckle against Harry's cheek in an almost-not-there touch.
"Well, are you a Weasley or not?" The boy was less confident in his question then he had been in the previous statement and Harry was unsure why.
"Father, I told you that this conversation was done. I'm marrying him and that is final, nothing you can do will change that." Draco stated a hint of frustration seeping into his voice.
Harry was confused by the personality change in his Professor but he wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth. He curled up in a ball on the Italian leather couch, shaking only slightly as silent tears on his cheeks. He tried to forget the night before but the blatant dismissal by the Headmaster was a cut to the already bleeding heart.
"This is disgusting!" Hermione cried in disgust and outrage before handing it to Ginny who looked near tears at what she saw.
"I love you too," Harry admitted with a small blush, leaning forward to capture his boyfriend's lips on his own.
"But-" Draco smirked, pecking Harry's small frown, "I have enjoyed you far more than I enjoyed the others," Draco admitted, playing with the soft raven hair, surprised by the content feeling that welled in his chest.
Those words caused disgust in many Wizards and Witches, to know the chit had tried to seduce the poor boy before and had taken to rape after being rejected made many of them want to call for the girl's head.
"You don't understand! I can't go back there, don't make me-" How could he sleep in that house? In the bed, he had been assaulted in, next to the people who had aided his rapist. Knowing that those he had called family wanted a thirteen-year-old girl pregnant with his child so that he died and her family could take his money. He didn't understand how anyone could even consider the idea.
"You've no reason to apologize. You were hurting, are hurting, and it is okay to just feel and let it out." Draco continued to drape his arm over the smaller one's shoulders. "Come on, I will give you a tour of Malfoy Manor." Draco walked Harry out of the room, pleased that his appendage hadn't been removed from where it still laid across the shoulders of the slightly younger teen.
"Are you sure?" Malfoy raised an eyebrow at the girl, he hadn't thought she would lie, but he should have expected it. He truly thought she would just say what she had done was 'for the greater good' like the man she was working with would have.
"Oh, it's a muggle thing that kills people. You put bullets in them and you point them at people and pull a small trigger - kinda like a switch - and the bullet flies out and it can go through skin and bone sometimes. If the bullet gets stuck you have to pull it out and that hurts a lot. Anyways during wars, Muggles used them to kill people."
"You, there, little blonde snake." A dreamy voice floated into his ears. "You should seek the wall across from Barnabas the Barmy on the seventh. Thrice pace and you will find what you seek." The blonde Ravenclaw smiled at him dreamily.
He kept his head down but answered clearly. "I was in the Headmaster's Office." Harry felt embarrassment burn his cheeks the longer the silence stretched.
"Did you read the letter?" Lucius asked emotionlessly, barely able to conceal his glee at the plan he was finally able to work out, and tonight was the time to start things.
"As much as I love an eager virgin, Potter, I believe that doing this here in the corridor is just asking to be on the front page of the Prophet." Draco pulled back, his arms tight around Harry's waist.
Severus sat with George at his side while Fred pulled Harry into his lap. Severus nearly laughed at the cooing, glad that his husbands got to see their longtime friend again.
"I, Dragonis Lucius Malfoy, swear on my magic that the clauses in the marriage contract are truthful and once agreed upon will be in the actual contract." A blue light enveloped Draco before fading.
Severus had never felt such an onslaught of magic before and felt both awed and terrified. The magic reserve the boy had was beyond anything he had ever seen before. He pulled the child to him before the body went limp and Harry was pronounced asleep.
Of course, his subconscious was not yet convinced of its safety, and knowing he was going back to school, Harry couldn't see himself getting better. The mere thought of going to Gryffindor Tower, let alone sleeping there, sent chills over his body, his hairs raised on end, and nausea to roll through his stomach like a freak storm.
"I know son, but I found some new information and it is exactly what I feared." Lucius played the concerned father as he sat down in his private office across from his son.
"It's ruined." Harry burrowed his face in the juncture of Draco's neck, taking in deep breaths in an attempt to calm himself, the close proximity was helping him.
"Merlin Potter...." Draco still looked weak and concern flooded Harry and his hero complex kicked back into gear again.
"He ended up killing millions of people before he took his own life when his headquarters were invaded by American soldiers." Harry paused to look at Cedric, who was ghost white and frozen. "A lot of non-Jewish people died too. Soldiers fighting to free the Jewish were killed and people trying to keep the Jewish in the camps were killed as well. It was terrible. Genocide is what my teachers called it. He killed over 1/3 of all Jewish people."
"They certainly will. Now I need to know who you want to know about this. How quickly do you want the public to know because they will find out, and how soon do you want me to take it up with the Minister himself?"
"I'm sorry," tears and snot covered the boy's face, his voice thick with emotion as he sobbed, body hunched and chained. "I didn't know, I'm sorry!" a calming draught was gently tipped into Ron's mouth. It took a few moments for his cries to settle to sniffles and for his body to stop shaking. An Auror stepped forward and gently magicked the snot and tears from the boy's face.
"You're so adorable when you giggle like that." Draco teased, pulling Harry flush to him by his hips, smirking at the startled yelp Harry let out before laughing heartily as he wrapped his arms around Draco's shoulders.
Harry opened hisÂ mail quickly, making a show of his horror and anger on his face as he stood and stomped out of the room. He heard small gasps when Draco stood and called his name, quickly walking after him.
"Saving your godson from starving!" Harry hissed back. That shut Severus up and the man seemed to finally look at Draco before his eyes widened in horrorÂ and regret. The room was silent for twenty long minutes while Draco fed to his heart's content. harry didn't worry about his blood because he could still feel the large amounts of blood replenishers still working inside his veins.
"Wizards can have children, you knew that right?" Fred and George asked at the same time. harry shook his head, he hadn't known until Draco had told him.
"Not at all, just worrying over Draco." She looked saddened. "I still cannot wrap my head around how Harry could have done what he had done. He was always so devoted to Draco, I thought they were in love."
Harry sat on his bed, breakfast long cold in the desk. He only had a few minutes left before he would need to go to Charms. Not knowing if he had the strength to face the day Harry started to weep, it was the sound of a knock on the painting that brought him out of his grief.
He was a little surprised when he found that calling Harry 'child' felt natural and smooth, wiping away all the past to start anew. Severus was a little more than relieved that Harry had yet to ask him to stop calling him that.
"NO! You're lying!" The boy accused, a single tear slipping down his left cheek. "Dumbledore wouldn't do that!" The boy swung his head around wildly, looking to the members of the court for proof of Malfoy's lies. "No! Harry's my best friend! He wouldn't do that." A few women dabbed their eyes, the boy on trial looked absolutely devastated by the news. A few of the wizards cursed Dumbledore for manipulating the boy to play a part in the rape, drugging, and eventual murder of a boy's best friend.
Albus enjoyed the rest of the meal before retreating to his office. He wrote back to the Minister and left all the letters from the Board of Governors for Minerva to do. Later he would call Ronald and Hermione up to his office to ask if Harry was in his Potion's class and again try and figure out where the boy had been sleeping. His two spies had been up on Saturday morning to tell him Harry hadn't come up to the tower to sleep. Everyone's fear of Harry leaving the school had been put to rest by all of his belongings staying at the end of his bed.
"Yeah, I mean Lord Malfoy could have done much more damage. He could have demanded an Absolute contract but if anything it's better for Harry than Malfoy." Neville passed the contract to Dean and Seamus who read it quickly.
"No, I was just looking for him. He left dinner pretty early." Hermione's voice was even closer than Ron's. "I was thinking he might be in here, Ya know he comes here when he gets upset."
"I think maybe viewing the memories would explain it better." Lucius pushed his pensive filled with false memories to his son who hesitantly lowered himself in.
He stepped forward and Ginny screamed insults. The spell wove around Ginerva's abdomen before slowly dispersing, a breath of relief escaped many's mouths. She wasn't pregnant. "You filthy death eater! I KNOW I'M PREGNANT! I'M A WEASLEY!" Spit spewed from her mouth as Aurors stepped forward to give her the antidote and stupify her before carrying her away.
"I just thought that after one night Harry and Ginny would be together, I knew Ginny liked Harry and Mum told me after they fell in love they'd get graduated and-and-and that Harry would forgive us for forcing him to drink that potion because he would fall in love with Ginny." The ease at which the words flowed proved the fourteen-year-olds compliance, the shuddering shoulder, and great heaving sobs genuine as the serum made it impossible for the boy to even lie to himself as to the reasonings he had been telling himself as the guilt ate him up since that fateful night.
"NO!" He clutched the closest thing, Snape's robe, "please don't send me home." He wouldn't be able to deal with the Dursley's. He'd barely been at school two and a half months.
"I don't want to work through it! I want him to hurt the way he hurt me!" Draco shouted, standing up and pacing angrily.
"Innocent!" Hermione called out, smugness curling her lip, no doubt not knowing memories would be provided. The trial was quick and brutal. Amelia Bones started by asking where the girl had been that fateful Thursday evening. "I was in Gryffindor Tower."
"Oh fuck-yeah, just like that baby." Draco hissed in pleasure, latching his mouth onto the pale expanse of neck, biting, licking and sucking marks of his dominance into his new lover.
"She's a friend, after she told me how to get here she said she had to find a blonde snake. I assumed she meant you." Harry blushed under the look Draco gave him. "What?" His voice was shy and nervous.
Lucius watched with a smirk, he would get the scum out of his family if it was the last thing he would do and if he played his cards right then this plan would work. Soon enough Draco resurfaced, tears streaking down his cheeks, eyes rimmed red ass anger and anguish rolled off of him and his magic in waves.
Lucius couldn't even finish the first page. He felt sick. He banished all the files back to their places before leaving.
Harry didn't even turn around, just laughing hysterically, tears choking him as he felt frustration and anger and pain crawl up his throat.
"I'm disgusted by you! I mean you blew of Ginny like she was nothing!" Ron pushed Harry's chest and grabbed his book bag before throwing it across the hall, trying to get a reaction. Harry didn't respond. He felt lost.
"Not as a Slytherin. But I'm here as Harry's Dominate, not a Slytherin." Nevile quickly opened the portrait and pointed to the dorms and smiled sadly to himself when Draco raced up the steps, calling out Harry's name gently.
"It was a gift." Harry tried to swipe it but Ron pulled it back too quickly. "Please Ron give it back, I have to wear it to the-"
I hope you guys like this chapter, slow updates because I'm having a hard time writing Molly and Albus' trials.
Seeing the blood drain from Ron's face at hearing the plan laid out had been shocking to Harry. Over the past few days, he had thought Ron had betrayed him just as much as Hermione, but he had been wrong and he didn't know how he was supposed to feel.
"What?" Harry asked, slowly slipping off of Draco's lap, letting himself be pulled up and pulled back to the parchment that was covered in glass.
"That's not how you treat your girlfriend Harry." Ginny batted her eyelashesÂ in an attempt at a flirty manner. Whispers broke out at her statement.
"Fine!" Malfoy hissed and pulled Harry into an alcove before erecting Silencing Wards around them. "What is your plan exactly?"
Attempted line-theft and conspiracy to murder were both charges that required a closed session, so press and anyone not important to the case, or a member of Wizengamot, was not allowed in the courtroom. Lucius was questioning the suspects on behalf of Harry and, therefore could not be the adult sat in the gallery, having his pick Harry choose Severus Snape, the only other adult he trusted at the time.
"You're a wizard, you could have used magic to do that, but instead you're doing it the Muggle way." Harry gibed, a smile on his lips when the blond jumped off of with a disgusted look on his pale face. "Thanks." He rolled his eyes as he stood and walked past the glaring Slytherin.
"Red hair, hand-me-down clothes, you must be a Weasley." The boy smirked and Harry felt lost and confused.
"I don't know! Apparently, there was a marriage contract between the Malfoy's and the Black's andÂ I'm Heir Black? I don't know about the last part but Malfoy said that all contracts are approved by Gringotts and according to them I'm the Heir, I don't know how." Harry rubbed the back of his neck nervously. "He wasn't very happy with the terms."
Wow... I know this update is out of nowhere, and it has been way too long since I've written for this fanfiction, or really any of my fanfictions.
Each morning Lucius Malfoy and Severus Snape were at the table with breakfast, a very low-dose calming draught next to his plate to put him at ease after his restless sleep.
"That is a very interesting idea, Harrison." Lucius leaned back and took a sip of his tea. "I may just have to talk with some unspeakable, some of the Board members to have it a law that every Muggle-born take an inheritance test."
"Harry.... Call me Harry." Harry could have slept right there, in the arms of the vampire he had been trying to feed.
"What do you mean? Draco was in line for the Black Lordship under you?" Lucius was confused, he sat up straighter, his wine forgotten as he looked to his wife expectedly.
"Shhhh Harry, we are just sleeping." The words seemed to relax the tense Gryffindor and only moments later he was asleep, nuzzled closer in his subconscious. "That's more like it." Draco pressed a soft kiss to the base of Harry's neck before burrowing his nose into the soft raven locks, breathing in the smell of pine and drifting to sleep.
"Oh, child." Snape lifted his hand to pet Harry's hair consolingly. "I know you are going to dislike your options but you have very few left. Professor Dumbledore is a man that doesn't like things that inconvenience him, this would put his plans to a halt so he doesn't want anyone to know about it. You have two options, tell Madam Bones about your situation and press charges or tell Lucius Malfoy who will press charges for you and bring her to trial."
"Sirius left him as the sole Heir when he passed." Narcissa sighed sadly. "Then my great aunt was his paternal grandmother so he was already blood-related and then when he was born Sirius had blood adopted him as well. So he was second in line for the Black title after any of Sirius' children if he had so chosen to have any." Narcissa explained with a frown. "That poor child."
"What are you suggesting?" Lucius leaned forward, he understood a lot of Muggle things, having been raised to learn them because his father had a lot of Muggle connections high up in the government.
"I do have my own money you know." Harry giggled when Draco dug his fingers into Harry's sides, tickling him and swirling them around, the borrowed Slytherin beanie slipping off of Harry's head as he laughed and squirmed.
A slow week later and Harry notices the blonde was absent the entire day. He skipped History of Magic and instead found himself in Snape's private office, sitting silently in front of the tired looking teacher. A silent agreement later and Harry gave a pint of blood before promising to be back in three days to give another.
"Where do you want to go first?" Draco swung his and Harry's hand happily, blissfully unaware of the beetle reporter that flew around them.
Harry felt a small smile creepÂ onto his lips as he nodded shyly. When the other boy sat down in front of him, smiling brightly Harry couldn't help but smile back.
"Why did you help drug Harry Potter?" Lucius Malfoy asked, stepping closer and enjoying the hatred that glared at him from the small girl.
One month later and the resentment between the newest couple has dropped in the public and they go on their first date. Some friends are supportive and others aren't happy.
"You are not intruding, I would not have offered if I hadn't wanted you here." Draco transfigured their clothing to sleep wear simply to get into bed faster. He slipped under the covers and pulled Harry in after him.
"Men are too strong to be overpowered by a woman. And we have magic, it is just impossible." Draco said firmly.
"Fuck Harry, just like that baby." Draco groaned out at the feeling of Harry's wetness seeping into his pants as Harry breathily moaned into his neck. He rutted a few more times before spilling inside his pants. "Oh fuck." Draco gasped into Harry's collar bone. "Jesus you turn me into a fucking third year," Draco smirked, helping Harry balance on his feet.
The weekend had been rough. Harry woke at least twice a night, screaming, crying, or gasping for air. Draco was always close, to offer a shoulder to cry on, lend an ear for Harry to vent his feelings, his fears, and his nightmares to.
"Thanks?" The bashful response provoked a smirk from the blond. "When you're not insulting me you look nice too....." The raven-haired boy quickly turned away and went back to his book before Draco even had the chance to move his lips.
Draco pulled out a random book from the pile he had created and started reading, only vaguely paying attention having read it before. Most of his awareness was on Harry - who was nose deep into the book - and he was eraptured by the beauty he hadn't noticed before. "You're beautiful." Draco sighed the compliment, unable to stop himself before he said it.
The first weekend had been spent around Draco from the second he woke to the second he went to bed, Draco had warmed him while sleeping, keeping the nightmares at bay for most of the night. The library had occupied his mind during the day, and at night Draco led him back to their shared bed and pushed as much comfort and support into the small and damaged Gryffindor as possible.
"How do I know that your father has sent a fake draft and the real one is going to make me do everything you command?" He was nervous, shy even, that whatever he and Draco planned was going to backfire.
"If the clauses aren't in the final contract then I will lose my magic." He stated evenly, ignoring the look of shock on the Gryffindor's face.
The next few minutes were noisy as the court deliberated; a few minutes later, the vote was called. Almost unanimously, Hermione Granger was voted Guilty. She was stunned and carried out of the room, back to her cell until all the trials were over and done with, at a later time, Cornelius Fudge, Lucius Malfoy, and Amelia Bones would decide on a punishment for her.
"The Headmaster is supposed to give them to the Head's to give to the children they get in the Muggle world. Even though you're half-blood you have been raised a Muggle." Neville explained.
"In a month Ginvera Weasley will have announced the pregnancy, the Wizengamot would be hard-pressed to charge a pregnant woman, it is Harry Potter she raped, and the evidence of line-theft she should be charged to Azkaban but being pregnant she may just be fined."
"See in Muggle science there is genetics. If two people who have brown eyes give birth to a child with blue eyes and no one in their family does then it's 90% sure that that kid isn't biologically from both of those parents."
"Being such public figures, Dumbledore and Harry, the trial may be in a few days, I have my case, we will have to see their defenses. With Harry's memories and my push for Veritaserum on Molly Weasley and Dumbledore, I hope for a quick trial." Seeing that the conversation had come to an end, Severus said goodnight and flooed back to Hogwarts.
"That Godfather of yours almost lost a few times but he seems to care about you enough to defeat his cousin, a master dueler. I was impressed."
"He's funny, always makes me laugh when I'm down. He's great as chess and is always patient when I need help, always pushes me to be my best. He'd never turn on me and-"
"Rape for Miss. Weasely. Assult of the Second Degrees for both Mr. Weasley and Miss. Granger, and Molly Weasley Albus Dumbledore for endangering children." Severus listed.
"No!" Harry was mentally screaming at his body to move to the door but it was refusing to move, he just stood still, his body shivering as a cold sweat broke out over his body. "Please don't make me talk about it." He was close to weeping in shame.
Harry was thankful that is was Friday because he wasn't required to show his face at all during the weekend because right after dinner he met his Professor back in his classroom. He felt even more exhausted than before because he had to spend the entirety of dinner avoiding his two - former? - best friend's and his rapist. The only thing that kept him from exploding into tears and screams and panic was gentle, mental probing from the professor. He wasn't looking at any memories, he was just occasionally brushing against Harry's mentalÂ mindscape? He didn't know how to explain it.
"I'm not just going to let you walk out like that." Draco frowned, confused as to what he had done to get Harry to want to leave. "Can't we talk about this?" Draco had wanted Harry since he met him. He wanted close to the teen in front of him and after hearing him in the bliss of pleasure he wouldn't settle until Harry was
"He is very smart, almost beating me in Potions." She sniffed in the haughty way that always made Harry cringe.
"No, if he kissed me I don't think it would even compare to the one that we shared in the class- Mmmmm." Harry almost moaned when Draco's tongue swept between his lips. "Dr-Draco?" Harry pulled back a bit, breathing in heavily. "Does this mean that we are..."
Harry was a bit overwhelmed. He wanted to know why, how long had they been planning, why now, what had they meant by 'accident,' did they truly want him dead, why now when he was fourteen. "Uh, why now?" He took in their confusion as a sign to continue. "This was planned, so why now? Weasley is thirteen. I just don't understand."
"Child?" Harry was tugged back to reality by the gentle voice. Â "Child, we must go now." Snape let his hand fall to Harry's shoulder blade and calmly pulled Harry into the fireplace before flooing them to Malfoy Manor.
"I get the gross picture you're painting." Harry giggled in embarrassment, his face burned by the implications.
"We need to look like we've been arguing." Draco fixed his hair quickly before pulling Harry with him, quickly healing the swollen lips back to their normal plump and plushy state.
"What kind of friend are you when the enemy cares more about him than you do?" Nevill glared at Ron who was fuming in his seat as he watched Malfoy fly up the steps.
"It's a blood quill. Usually, I only have to use it three hours but it was four tonight." He answered automatically.
"Hermione! Have you seen Harry!" Ron's voice from outside the bathroom stilled both Harry and Draco, right in the middle of their position.
He was alerted by a small trinket that Minerva was coming up the stairs, he slid some of his notes about Harry into his desk and welcomed the woman with his trademark grandfathered smile. "Albus, here are last weeks progress reports, I still don't understand why they are needed now with Yule break almost upon us." He only thanked her and handed her the letters before waving her away. He had needed her busy with the reports so that she wouldn't notice what was supposed to have been sex between two very young teens.
"How did the Lions take it?" Draco snaked his arm behind Harry's back and pulled him onto his lap, forearms resting comfortably on Harry's thighs that were spread to sit comfortably on Draco's own lap.
He stood before the fireplace, and the flames were tall but gentle, Harry didn't think it would be possible outside of a magical home. Snape was behind him, one hand on his shoulder. Draco had already gone through. Harry had hesitated so long the once green flames were back to orange and red hues. Lucius was somewhere behind Severus, waiting for the others to leave so he could lock the floo. "I don't think I can do this," his voice wavered. "No, I know I can't do this, please don't make me go back!" He backed up further, only making it two steps before he was unable to more anymore, blocked by the Potions Master's body.
"You have no reason to apologize child." Harry didn't know why being referred to as 'child' was comforting to him while being called 'boy' made him a little irritated and angry.
Aurors walked down the hall and stopped in front of the Muggleborn's cell; they stupefied her through the bars and quickly levitated her out; the first trial was ready to begin.
"Mr. Potter, you are welcome to make use of Malfoy Manor for however long you need." The offer caused some surprise to show on the faces of many adults.
"Ron, Mione, and Gin were mad like it was my fault. And when the twins asked why I didn't know about male pregnancy it then that brought up why I was picked up by Hagrid instead of a Head and then why I didn't get the Muggle-born pamphlets and then the three just seemed to run out of the tower like Merlin himself was chasing them."
Draco didn't know if he could answer so he stepped closer, wrapping his arms around Harry's waist, nosing along the pale neck. He relished at the sound of the breath hitching and the feeling of Harry's heart beating faster through his chest. He licked a small stripe across the collarbone. He almost moaned at the hint of innocence and the sweet taste of blood. '
Harry whimpered at the words, his breath hitching in his throat at the gleam that shined in the eyes of the Ice Prince. A second of silence later and Harry lost his control. He moaned at the lingering taste of strawberries on Draco's lips.
"I will get you anything you want," Draco promised, pulling Harry right back to his chest, smiling at the bark of laughter Harry let out.
When the department head case out of the pensive she looked murderous. She quickly finished the file and copied it and sent it out with a wave of her wand. She stood and gestured for Lucius to follow her as she collected some Aurors. "I will need the Board of Governors to come with me to visit the school, and I will need their permission to pull Mr. Potter from the school, he will need to get tutors and see a mind healer before being allowed back to school if he so chooses."
"Come stay with us for a few days, I don't think you going back to your apartment is the best thing right now. The twins and I have more than enough room. We can work things out from there." Severus offered and after a few minutes of arguing Harry agreed.
"Not all abide by the contract. My mother's sister was supposed to marry my father but ran off and married a muggle." Draco explained -
"Yes, poor child, he grew up with his Muggle relatives." Narcissa seemed to grow angry after a few seconds. "They were abusive, treated Harry worse than Abraxas treated your house elves." Narcissa stood and kissed her husband's cheek before wishing him good night and leaving.
"Father, Harry and I have some news." Draco took Harry's hand, glad that his father had already set up wards around the table.
"You will not be forced into anything. If either of us ever wants out of the contract then the contract will be fair and more than generous to both parties of the relationship. But we both must remain faithful or Lady Magic will punish us."
"It will definitely get their attention and maybe make them a bit envious. Blaise will see just how attractive I am and-"
"You're turning into Malfoy!" Hermione hissed. The Slytherins tensed, going to pullout their wands but stopped when Harry finally answered.
"Relax and think of memories. Even the one with the Headmaster." Severus coaxed him through the few silent minutes with the tight hold around Harry's chest.
"Merlin Harry, you don't need to apologize for anything like that," Draco smirked before kissing Harry deeply again, tugging gently on the hair and relishing in the moan that he swallowed. He quickly plunged his tongue into the wet, warm, mouth of Harry's, mapping it out, groaning when Harry gripped his hair tightly. "I'm sure that you're versed enough in kissing me to be able to do a peck or two a day when our public relationship mellows out."
with him!" Ron was red with anger and while Harry wanted Ron to oppose the idea he didn't want it to be because it was
"I will buy you gifts, things to prove to you that I'd do to show you that I would be a good husband. Courtships usually go on until the couple breaks up or stops once the engagement is sealed completely."
"And if you were threatened? If someone told you that if you didn't have sexual relations with someone they'd kill your mother, me or Severus?"
"Goodmorning boys, did you finish your homework?" Severus questioned as he read the paper, raising an eyebrow and glancing at them when he didn't hear an answer.
"Well, if the rumors about second year have even remotely true then it seems Myrtle's bathroom is the safest place in the world to do anything." Harry glanced around and found that Draco had walked them all the way to the bathroom. "Now, Potter, where were we?" Draco smirked, one hand sliding down and squeezing Harry's bum.
He felt drained and he knew his magic was the only thing keeping him alive - just like at the Dursley's - and that if he lost much more blood he could die.
Within fifteen minutes, Harry was flooing to Malfoy Manor, Mr. Malfoy following him with all his things, Madam Bones coming after last to ask some questions. Both guests were led to the Lord; tea was set out with some biscuits; Harry only made his tea after Mr. Malfoy nodded encouragingly at him.
Harry tugged his heavy trunk behind him, his arms ached from the weight as he struggled to find an empty compartment. A little over halfway down the train Harry has seated alone in a compartment. He knew without a doubt he would never be able to get his trunk onto the shelves so he just set it down by his feet before he sat down tiredly. His back hurt from the welts, his limbs were exhausted and overall he felt like he would never be able to move again.
"So-So cl-close! Draco! Pl-Please." Harry moaned out, digging his fingers into Draco's shoulders as he rutted hurriedly against Draco, his climax only just out of reach. "Dr-Draco pl-please-oh like th-that, please." Harry whimpered, kissing Draco desperately, moaning into the kiss and rutting like a cat in heat.
"The guys in the dorm talk about those things and it scares me the way they talk about it. They don't care if their partner wants it or not. Dean even mentioned that once his Muggle friend has drugged his girlfriend and did things and everyone else - besides Nev - said they wanted to try that." He felt ashamed for telling but he felt something deep within his chest urge him to tell Draco everything. "And I grew up with Muggles. Magic hating Muggles and they weren't above hurting me to get what they wanted."
"Well, well, well." Harry turned to see a boy slightly taller than him, with platinum blond hair, startling gray eyes and an overall regal air around him.
"Bloody-" Draco exhaled sharply through his nose, breathing in deeply before rolling the dead weight off of him in order to control the situation. He straddled the waist of his nemesis, holding his wrist again, feeling slightly guilty when he saw the glazed eyes of the teen underneath him. "What relationship problems could the Chosen One have?!" He snapped angrily.
"Do not worry Harry, I hated History of Magic; I'm sure Draco will help you with it." Draco nodded along with his father's words.
Harry quickly met Draco in the front room, startled by the smell of alcohol on his fiance's breath and the overall disheveled look. "Draco are you-"
"Honeydukes, I've been craving some sugar quills." Harry tugged Draco with him down the snowy alley, a little further away from the hustle and bustle of the main area.
"He does, I believe he and Narcissa dueled for a bit, two hours I think before she was too exhausted to continue."
Harry knocked on the dark oak doors, wiping haphazardly at the tears on his cheeks before hanging his head.
"Come along Harry, sleep is well overdue." Draco slipped his fingers into Harry's hand, tugging him along easily.
"Just to clarify, you knowingly and willingly drugged Harry Potter so Miss Weasley could rape him, and went along with the conspiracy to murder your classmate so you could have access to his family books and money?"
Much like the previous trial, the boy lied about his whereabouts and whom he had been with. When the memory played Ron had to be silenced as he had begun screaming that the memory was false. No new information was provided by the memory but it served to scare the boy into some compliance, instead of remaining silence he answered, although he lied through his teeth until Lucius grew tired and forced the truth serum down the bo's throat after the Wizengamot voted in favor of the potion.
It was early enough that no one was roaming around, so Draco was able to walk hand-in-hand with Harry from Uncle Sev's office to the old potion apprentice room quite a few twists and turns into the dungeons. The apprentice room opened to a small common room with a large fireplace, two couches, a coffee table, with two doors opposite each other on the sides of the room. On the right was a bathroom; they left a room. In the room was a desk, a bookcase, a few shelves, a full bed, and a wardrobe.
Harry would let out. His other hand let go of Harry's wrist to wrap a protective arm around the slim waist. What surprised him was how easily Harry slumped against him, not even caring that he was potentially being kidnapped. "Shhh." Draco purred into the ear, smirking when two redheads and the bushy haired muggle born ran past the opening of the alcove.
Lucius only nodded and quickly made use of the floo in the office and quickly made his way through to each of the Governor's houses, collecting the men and woman as he said he would in the letter he had written and sent the night before.
He sighed before standing and retreating back to the Slytherin common room. He felt sick when he recognized the salt tang of tears in the air that he knew came from Potter. Guilt settled in his throat at the thought of making his rival cry when Potter kept him alive.
"Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge providing over Harry Potter versus Hermione Granger in front of the full Wizengamot. Barrister Lucius Malfoy will be questioning with Madam Amelia Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, who made the arrest. Charges are as follows, accomplish to second-degree assault and conspiracy to murder against Harry Potter, how do you plead Miss. Granger?" Cornelius' voice was level as he stared down the fidgeting girl.
"Drink!" Harry thrust his wrist into Malfoy's face but the blond shook his head. "You idiot!" He turned around and grabbed the sharpest thing in his reach - a quill - and stabbed his wrist before dragging it sharply up the arm a few inches, ignoring the cries of panic before he threw the quill to the side before he shoved his bleeding flesh under Draco's nose. His eyes flashed silver again and his lips enclosed the deep puncture and sucked greedily.
"On, no he wasn't. You can't be serious?" Narcissa laughed. "Lucius, Lucius he is the Lord of both Potter and Black." Narcissa looked to her husband confusedly. "He is by far richer than us, at first I had questioned Draco on his motives but he was just in love."
They ate the rest of the meal is silence, Harry idly wondered where Draco's mum could have been the whole weekend but decided against asking, he didn't want to ruin the friendship that had started forming over the weekend. The first day Draco had hated him, but when Harry woke up, the Slytherin wished to comfort him, had encouraged his interests in books, and been a substantial presence he needed to fall asleep feeling safe, a protector of sorts.
"I do-don't want to-" Severus didn't need to read his mind to understand that he wasn't going to be able to go to the next class.
Hermione Granger was flushed in anger. How dare that attention-seeking brat expose her, she thought furiously.
Harry didn't know how Draco was going to react - or god forbid what Lucius would do - when everyone found out. He let out a sigh when he heard the door slam closed.
He cleaned the soaked pillows and transfigured the clothes into pajamas before banishing the food. Seeing that everything was in order he left, he had planned on talking to the boy and maybe helped him with his homework, he often had available time for his Slytherins and wanted to make sure Harry would have help now that he wouldn't be doing his work with the Gryffindors. The fight at lunch among his Slytherins meant that Draco wouldn't have much time to spend with his new friend without alienating his year mates.
"No, you are free to tell your friends-" Draco's voice rang with disgust. "-About the contract but under no circumstances will you state that it is fake." Harry could feel his magic tingle at the command.
"Then violate the contract!" Ron smiled like it was the best idea he had ever had. He snatched Harry's outer cloak - dark green with silver trimmings and a black clasp of the Black Crest - and Harry almost fell over himself trying to get it back. "What is this?!" Ron examined the cloth on the other side of the bed than Harry.
"You're pining after Weasley?" He tried to keep the repulsion out of his voice but it was a hard fight, it was a
Harry lay in one of the guest rooms, his body aching as he finally relaxed. He felt cold, alone and sad. He let himself cry, cry for his unborn child, his lost lover and for himself. He cried for Cedric, for Sirius, for his parents, and for Remus. He cried from all his friend's he had lost and all the damage that had taken place since he had entered the magical world.
"Severus Snape please." Harry fell limply back into the bed, tears brimming his eyes again as he was left alone in the room. He curled into a ball, wrapping his arms protectively around his stomach as he silently cried into his pillow.
Neville lead Draco at a fast pace up to the tower. "Can I trust you with the password?" Neville asked hesitantly.
Harry just about fell to his knees and screamed when he felt Draco's hand wrap around his dick and stroke quickly. Harry bit into Slytherin's outer robe, a silent scream caused a fleeting moment of pure bliss. "You look so sexy like this, all desperate and needy. And you can't even make a sound, lest you friends find you, with the enemies hand wrapped around your hot, thick, and oh so virgin cock." Draco whispered into Harry's ear while Ron and Hermione argued about Parseltongue and if it can even be taught and/or learned.
It was Professor's Snape warm and solid hand on his shoulder that kept Harry in the present. He desperately wished for the small comforts that holding Draco's hand had offered. His first day back to the school after the incident Harry had slowly pushed the blond away, the proximity and closeness were too much while stuck in the halls that had bared witness to the worst moment of his life. While safely cocooned in the Malfoy Manor Harry had been able to forget some of the horrible acts and had been able to fall slowly into the arms that Draco held open for him.
"No friends around to stop me from hurting you? From killing you? From torturing you?" Draco was toying with his wand, walking closer with every step until Harry could reach out and touch him.
"So even if we had each found someone else we would have been forced to marry?!" Draco glared at his father,
"He wears a mask, just like many purebloods," Draco explained as he pulled piles and piles of candy into their bag. "You wanted sugar quills, correct?" When Harry nodded Draco pulled all of the sugar quills on the shelf into the bag. "What else do you like?"
"I think you're forgetting what you told Harry earlier, Weasley. Didn't you say that you wouldn't talk to him anymore because he did as his Dominate asked him? how can you be friend's with someone you won't talk to?" Draco pulled Harry under his arm, smirking when Harry turned and buried his nose in Draco's neck.
A sick crack was heard as Ron punched Harry hard enough to break his nose. "Fuck you!" Ron hissed and kicked Harry in the side of his head where he kneeled on the ground. Ten stunners all shot out of Slytherin wands. Hermione just turned her nose up at Harry's crumpled, unconscious, body before the doors opened.
"Many pure-bloods marry without love, Draco." He paused. "And even if Harrison had wanted to leave he offered many advantages to our name. He is the Heir to the Potter and Black Lordships and maybe others."
"I get the gross picture you're painting," Draco said softly, pulling back a bit, more than disappointed that Harry still wanted Ron when he had already given up on Blaise, an entire week ago.
"What about Ron?" Draco asked instead, leaning closer until their noses were a hair away from touching.
The next morning Harry sat on one of the armchairs in the common room as he stared into oblivion. The two youngest Weasley's and Hermione surrounded him, all asking questions rapid fire. He ignored them as he stood and robotically grabbed his bag before walking out of the tower. He ignored the angry glares from his three friends and the worried or confused stares from the other Gryffindor's.
"He is the only one who knows of your condition and the only one who can give blood that you can access. Dumbledore isn't here anymore Draco, he cannot get you blood and we both knew that Umbridge won't help you. I will not let my godson starve!" Severus hissed while he closed Harry's wound with a twirl of his wand.
Walking into the Great Hall took Harry's breath away. He was in awe of the floating candles, the charmed roof and the thrum of magic.
Harry sighed, tears streaming down his face, his shoulder shaking. "Yes....." He whimpered when Ron glared at him and ripped the cloak in half before throwing it down and stomping out of the room.
"Father, Uncle, are we needed?" Draco asked, closing his book and sitting up straighter, his arm pulling Harry to his side, effectively causing the smaller one to yelp and fall onto the other teen.
Harry didn't know if he should be jumping for joy or crying in despair. He looked down at the pregnancy test one last time, letting out a watery chuckle followed by a sob when the answer still hadn't changed.
Draco slumped in he seat Potter had just vacated. He looked up at his Godfather who looked at him with disappointment. He felt like a scolded child. "Why?" Was all his Godfather asked?
"I was fine!" The blond hissed. "Stay away from me! I don't ever want to see you again! If you every touch me I will kill you." The vampire's eyes flashed before he stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him.
eat vegetables, a lot of them, lean meats, fruit and nothing junkie." Draco listed, smirking when Harry just nodded. "Good boy, now run along and get sleep. Do not tell anyone of our
"I know we are asking a lot of you, Mr. Potter, but I'm afraid we cannot keep you from school any longer." Lucius stepped forward to meet the child's eyes. They were wide in fear; the once bright green shadowed.
end this fling with my son before I do. I will not let you touch a single Sickle of the Malfoy money. Draco can and will do much better than you." Lucius snarled, raising his hand and smirking after the Potter brat flinched and ducked his head. "You will do good to remember this and if you ever mention anything to my son I will ruin you before torturing you in the worst way possible."
Draco wanted to scream, Blaise hadn't even lifted a brow in his direction when he told his friend's of the contract. Pansy was outraged, Daphne was sympathetic, Crabbe and Goyle were upset that Draco was upset, Theo was detached and Blaise didn't even care!
"Your father is not how I expected," Harry admitted shyly as Draco pulled him along the aisles of Honeydukes.
"I could suggest to Fudge to ward the room with anti-biased wards or have all members voting to take an oath on their magic." Lucius offered and smirked when he received a nod. "Good, now it is late. Draco, if you wouldn't mind-"
"Severus..... Potter." He spat distastefully. Severus glared at the man with all the anger he had felt that day and wanted to smirk when the blond flinched only slightly. He pulled Harry into a standing position, one hand still resting on Harry's shoulder.
Professor Snape arrived in a billow of his robes, an entrance that demanded attention, and he stared at them on the couch before his gaze softened just the smallest bit. "Winny," he called out, and when the house-elf arrived, he spoke again. "Collect all of Harry Potter's things from Gryffindor dorms and bring them to this room, do a wash, and put things away."
"Why can't I be the dominate?!" Harry asked in outrage, the idea of being a submissive wasn't that bad but he wasn't going to just bend to Draco's will.
"What?" Harry asked, rolling to be on his side, blindly reaching out in the hope that he would feel the metal of his glasses. He sagged in relief when he felt the pair of wire rimed glasses placed on his nose. "Thank you." Harry blinked repeatedly until his mind focused. He turned to the other student before blinking owlishly at him before scrambling to stand up. "Malfoy! What are you doing here?!" Harry whisper yelled, frantically looking to his sides and behind him before he deemed himself safe enough to talk normally.
"My grandson crucioed Harry in a fit of anger when he believed that Harry had cheated, on him," Severus spoke up, tensing when both his husbands stared at Harry in horror. "Harry didn't get the chance to tell him of the news because of a lip-locking charm."
"So, Harry - can I call you Harry?" after receiving a nod, she continued. "Now I've looked at the memories; I am going to start compiling a list of questions to ask all those involved, are there any questions you feel need to be asked?"
"Yes, I will have to view them multiple times in order to come up with charges I can bring in front of Wizemgots."
"Every night for the past two weeks." Harry droned, eyes glazed as his sight kept slipping out of focus.
The blond pure-blood coerced them to the left side of the room before sitting down in an armchair. Severus sat next to Harry on the large couch. Tea appeared with a quiet crack of displaced air. Lucius used his magic to serve the tea before they settled for silent sipping.
"Harry! Sub? Sub?" Draco froze at the sight in front of him. His Sub was on his knees, balling his eyes out, holding the torn apart cloak close to him. He looked up at Draco when he heard his voice.
"Yessir!" Dobby snapped his fingers to pack everything before he apparated them to the Hospital. Frantic minutes later and Harry was sitting in a hospital bed, two Medi-witches fussing around him, one checking the baby while the other checked his condition.
Harry stifled a near silent cry of pleasure in Draco's chest, his fingers white from where they clenched in Draco's clothing, his hips stuttering into Draco's pleasurable grasp, his body alight in pleasure as every nerve sparked in bliss.
The Wizengamot whispered to each other as Ronald Weasley was brought into the room when the stupify was released the boy snarled at everyone and tugged harshly at the chains, his efforts proved futile. Cornelius gave the beginning statement and once again the accused claimed innocence.
"You will not have to sleep in the tower Mr. Potter," Snape assured, "You don't even have to keep your things there, I promise you."Â Harry gathered as much courage as possible; he feared Voldemort less than this and threw the floor powered into the flames and walked through before he could convince himself to stay.
"Harry..." The man sounded so sad and worried that Harry broke down into tears, falling into the man's chest as his shoulder heaved with his pain. "Shhhhh child."
." The hat shouted and Harry was startled at the sheer volume of it. When his name was called he pretended that the shocked gasps and whispered were too far away to hear. He settled himself on the stool, flinching when the hat was settled onto his head.
"Harry, would you like to explain why my husband's and I were interrupted during our throws of passion by a medi-witch of St. Mungo's?" Severus drawled sarcastically, frowning when Harry didn't laugh like he usually did but instead broke down into sobs again. "Harry, what's wrong?" Severus transfigured a chair before quickly sitting by the man's bed.
He knew that he was known for being a grumpy, unapproachable, git but he wasn't heartless enough to push the child away. The sound of students outside the doors brought Severus to reality. "Harry, Harry, child, you may stay in my office for the last class of the day or I can write you a late pass for your last class." Severus knew it was out of character but he couldn't even imagine the mental pain the Potter spawn was going through.
"Cissa is fine Harry, let us migrate to the sitting room." Narcissa kissed Harry's cheek before taking her husband's arm, kissing him as well before leading all four of them towards the sitting room.
"Shhhhh, Sub, you didn't do anything wrong. You chose me, my beautiful Sub, you are perfectly fine." Draco kneeled next to Harry and pulled him close, pulling out his wand to place privacy wards around the Dorm.
"Merlin Harry! I swear you've never been such an asshole!" Ron growled. Harry just stared back at them unresponsive. "See! All you do is stare and say nothing!" Ron took a threatening step forward but Harry just sighed softly.
"We should." Harry agreed, going up on his tip toes to press a chaste kiss to Draco before slipping out of the stall. "Until next time." He gave Draco a small smile before slipping into the crowd and disappearing from sight.
"I like who I like Malfoy, I don't see why you're so curious..... Or maybe you fancy me? Is that it Malfoy? You want in my pants and you want to see who you have to contend with to win my heart? Well-"
"Is there anything else you would like to say to the court?" Amelia asked gently, she was conflicted. She was still fuming at what this boy had done to the child in the gallery, however, her maternal instincts she had developed since taking in her niece were in overdrive. She knew this redhead to be genuinely remorseful, to have been mostly manipulated to play his part in the play, yet she knew his actions could not be taken back, they were heinous and unforgivable.
The Gryffindor was straining to keep her mouth closed, face red in exertion before the words exploded from her mouth. "Professor Dumbledore said Harry wouldn't live to graduation! There would be an accident." Tears quickly rolled down the girl's face, shame overcoming her at exposing the man's plan she had promised to keep safe and hidden.
"T-Thank you, Mr. Malfoy, I greatly appreciate the offer." As Harry spoke the words, the man came over to stand behind him, one hand on his shoulder. Professor Snape packed all of Harry's things with a few waves of his wand. The young Gryffindor stood close to both the older men he had grown comfortable with. When two men, both older and completely unrecognizable to Harry, approached him with excitable grins, Harry felt himself step back, directly into the blond's body, pressing himself even closer when the men didn't pause despite Harry stepping away from them.
