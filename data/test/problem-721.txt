“Do they treat you well?” he wanted to know, and “Are they careful enough not to hurt you and your little bump?”
“Yes.”
- doesn’t matter. Henry Potter—the one that got you cast out—his grandmother, Adelia Fleamont. See, she was born a Malfoy, daughter of Lucius Armand Malfoy, and she had phoenixes.” Malfoy gestures to the copper basin on the table.
“I hope,” Petunia Dursley speaks up, her mien solemn. “That you are at peace with yourself,” she says. Draco feels sick. “And that you don’t hold any grudges. You were a complicated boy. We were not prepared to deal with this, this-“
Dear future Harry, I imagine you’ll be reading this with your family around you.
, God damn it—it’s not like they were notorious meth junkies. And it’s not even like they were drunk. People do all kinds of aggressive shit when they are drunk, but not on bloody happy pills. Bloody police with their biased opinions about drugs. And fuck the media as well for making it sound like everyone harmed on drugs is so
“It’s sinking in! It doesn’t feel like the Manor that it once was.”
I angled my hip, undulating back against Potter's unrelenting composure and much to my pleasure, Potter’s thrusts did get a little harder then, wrenching moans from my throat through gritted teeth as I kept encouraging him.
the reaction Harry had expected. Especially not combined with an odd, rueful smile that makes him look all closed off and distant.
“I regret it now,” Draco had smiled, sipping from his glass. “In the end the boy turned out to be quite a decent sort.” I watched Draco laugh, watched the edges of his lips crinkle, and I knew, in that one small moment, Draco was having a good time.
But when Tarquin stops kissing him, his thoughts about fucking are quickly forgotten. Tarquin talks about his parents who own a huge company that distributes several brands that Harry doesn’t know but sounds like they could be to do with vehicles or some kind of heavy machinery. It sounds like a big deal, and Harry tries to understand how Tarquin’s train of thought goes from there, to the day his aunt had gifted him a book by Karl Marx, and how that had changed his views on capitalism at such a young age. “I saw it in them, everything that’s wrong with consumerism. I mean-“ Tarquin braces himself on his elbows where they lie on the ground, and Harry, unnoticed, refreshes the Warming Charm on their coats. Tarquin looks pale and agitated in the greying light of dawn. “I mean, for them, it’s always about
to support their local shops!”
“They are. Not even the Ministry can get through them,” Draco says. He starts opening and closing doors nearby, assessing the huge paintings, most of which are charmed to quiet down his painted ancestors. “As a boy, I used magic all the live long day. The Ministry can’t detect a thing within the Wards.”
Fitzgerald had made him into somebody else, made him into somebody new, and he hadn’t had the right.
A bloke waltzes past, shoulders swaying to the rap-pop-ballads that have been playing all night long with their edgy seeming verses and predictable choruses. Harry’s eyes follow the young man who looks like he’s had too much MDMA, watching him dance and sing and talk to a group of people. They all look just as sickeningly predictable as the music, and Harry suddenly feels his veins freeze with solitude, emanating from deep within his rib cage and crawling into the last fibre of his extremities, clogging up his blood agonisingly slowly.
Draco didn’t really know what to say. Harry Potter wasn’t supposed to be sitting beside him and talking utter nonsense about Muggle animals. He sniffed and tried to arrange his face with some semblance of dignity. “It’s an awful plan,” Draco countered.
Draco only shrugged. “Perhaps it was all for the best,” he answered, not letting my fingers go. It felt the warmth of his magic, so familiar and engaging. “Father was bewitched by status and power. He loved all the accoutrements of being Lord of the Manor.
and Harry couldn’t care less that missing someone who’s gone for only two nights is somewhat ludicrous
?” Harry asks while adjusting the Wards. All the necessary panels are in the atelier. Everytime Harry raises his wand at them, he’s impressed by Draco’s potent magic, especially with nifty things like Wards. Through the open backroom door, Harry gets a glimpse of the workshop area where things look much less busy than they used to back in Lacock. Draco only takes interesting commissions now, none of the simple, magicked objects. It makes Harry think of the music box, the first object he ever helped mend despite there being nothing being broken for the old Mrs Crabbe. He chases the thoughts away.
Harry showed his care in other ways.
Harry couldn’t hide his surprise. “That’s- I don’t know what to say. But just to point it out again—we don’t have to. I wouldn’t ever pressure you into anything you-“
That evening, Draco examined himself in his bedroom before getting into his bed. He frowned at his reflection, disgusted with the hardly-there swell of his belly below his navel.
“I’ll be writing a few letters. Think I can tell Mrs Crabbe that her music box will be ready by next week?”
Sleep doesn’t find him, but when Harry hears a sound, it’s Draco who brings him tea and a bottle of water. There’s also a plate with a small peeling knife and an apple on it.
I can hardly wait to share it with you.
“Wait, but you've had sex with a man before, right? Harry asks.
That snide remark was the ingredient that finally spoilt the potion.
I was very adequately dressed. So was he, and he did not look ugly or like a complete weirdo. When I’ve learnt one thing during my days as a rent boy, it’s that all types of men want to enjoy themselves a little and will gladly pay for it if they must. But James didn’t look any different from all the other faceless guys I’ve been with. He didn’t look particularly smarmy or smug, not even wealthy. Not like a serial killer which I've sort of dreaded since I received his email. He had brown eyes and dark hair, with a clean-shaven face. Perhaps in his mid- or late-thirties. He looked very business overall. A bit nondescript.
“Thank you,” Teddy exclaimed, throwing his arms around my middle. “S’the best present I’ve ever had! I wanted to go out and fly after Christmas dinner, but Nana said no! She says we’ve got to wait for our food to go down.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry says sincerely. “Wasn’t my finest moment to leave like I did.”
Truthfully, I’m not really meant to still be here at St Mungo’s, gazing at you and Draco. Healer Bartsch tried to shoo me away about an hour ago, telling me to go home and rest, and that you were both in safe hands, but I haven’t quite been able to get up and leave yet. Listen to me! I'm already a besotted dad. I can’t help it. I can’t seem to stop looking at you and trying to process that this is my life now, and that you’re really real.
“No,” Harry concedes, shaking his head. Harry feels like the bloke sees right through him and also like he owes him a truthful answer, catching himself arguing whether he could get away telling a Muggle about magic.
“No, you didn’t,” Draco said. “It’s not that I’m not thankful, Harry. I am. I’m not an absolute fool… But the debt
But when I see Harry holding the swell of my belly so reverently, when I see his eyes flicker up to mine, hear him come home, smell the dinner he made… And when I think about Regulus’s old bedroom, right across from Harry’s bedroom, and that we’re working on turning it into a nursery at the moment – when I think about it, I can picture us living here. The plum whose sex is still a secret to us, Harry, and I. In my reveries, we are happy, showing the plum how important love and loyalty are. And both fun and manners, knowledge and play, work and leisure. It’s all playing in my mind like a very palpable memory that is yet to happen.
I coughed, not wanting to startle him, and he turned to look at me, smiling before grabbing onto his bump with a grimace. He held onto the wooden side of the crib with his other hand, steadying himself, and I could see that his knuckles were white. His face looked ashen, and his eyes were wide.
It isn’t that Harry doesn’t
Nothing seemed to help, and I was keen to call Bartsch – after all, he did say to contact him if anything unusual occurred – but Draco wasn’t having it. “I haven’t felt a contraction,” he grumbled, when I offered to Firecall. “I’m going to have an early night. Let’s see if the fidgety plum lets me have more than a few hours of rest. I swear to Merlin, it’s a good job that I’ve actually seen a picture of our baby. I’d be more likely to believe I was carrying a rogue bloody Bludger instead.”
“I would have thought you had grown up by now.”  Draco said, still icy and still not moved by the apology.
October, 19 Years After
"I should what?"  Harry asked, his eyes narrowing a bit as Draco tread into territory he was already tired of hearing about from others around him.
Ollivander had tried to talk to him more than once.  That kindly old man, who seemed to know nothing but wands, but who had actually held a very deep understanding of people and children through his years.  Held prisoner but still seeming more concerned over Draco's fear, his trembling hands.
Draco has been writing letters to Harry for years. The first one he wrote he really did mean to send, but then he didn't... Since then he has been writing letters, sealing them, and putting them in a drawer. They're personal, and therapeutic, they tell Harry everything... But they're never ACTUALLY supposed to be sent to him...
He didn't wait for Harry, he just turned and started walking up the hall.
And that made him think of what happened in the Observation Tower just a week ago.
“I had it for a week before I thought I lost it.  You've had it for how many years? I don't need it...”  He didn't need it.  And while he thought maybe it was awfully egotistical for him to think so, he thought maybe, somehow and for some reason, Draco did need it.
Draco looked down, pressing his lips together to try and squelch the smile that was forcing his mouth to curve up.  "I suppose that's true."
“It doesn't sound like a good one.”  Draco got up as well and moved to join the other boy.  “What is it?”
Harry almost missed it, like he often did, the sound of someone speaking parseltongue was so subtle to his ears that normally he didn't even know until someone else told him that it was happening.
"Draco Malfoy is really super gay."  Draco echoed Harry's words, chuckling as he turned his head to look away from the other man.
Making a noise that was kind of strangled, he turned and stalked back up the hall and into his bedroom.  His cheeks absolutely FLAMED as he rooted around and found a long sleeve t-shirt and a pair of pyjama pants to pull on.  Only once he was fully covered did he emerge again, returning to the kitchen to glare at the other man.
"Salt and vinegar.  Please."
Draco shook his head and Harry sighed, his stomach feeling lined with ice at the realization that Draco's life was on the line with Voldemort just like his was.  And Draco's threat seemed far more imminent than Harry's.
"See, that's the problem."  Draco said, straightening himself up in his chair a bit.  His shoulders set back and his chin raising a slight bit.  He looked every bit the arrogant boy he was in school though he didn't know it and couldn't control it even if he'd wanted to.
Harry nodded, chuckling a bit.  "Oh yes, I very much got that impression last year.  No offence but I still don't think I like her much."
He couldn't help but laugh, rubbing a hand against his forehead as the others clapped for him and he was once again side hugged by the same friendly lady.  He knew he'd done well, but he was still quite taken aback that he'd made Star Baker.
"I'll be right back, calm down."  Harry said.  "Honestly, what do you expect of me?  That I'd immobilize you, maybe break your nose then leave you to whatever came next?"
Though if he'd had a wand...
"I'll go to Kingsley."  Harry said decisively.  "There is no way that he should be allowed to come back from that.  And even if he was, there should be protections in place for you."
After awhile, he found he could breathe again.  Found he could sleep again.  Found that the world didn't seem dream like and surreal anymore.
Draco let out a low sigh, closing his eyes as he leaned his head against the door.  He didn't know what he wanted here...  Half of him wanted to open the door and confront this.  Half of him wanted to just call through the door and tell Harry to go away.
“Things change, Potter.” Draco said with a languid smile, his body relaxing and his hands sliding up Harry’s arms, twisting around them so his palms curved against the other boy’s biceps.
Draco sniffed dismissively, shaking his head as he looked towards the kitchen, then the door, then out the window.  “Impossible.  There isn't anything in here to panic about, is there?  Perfectly safe in here.”
"You can speak to it."  Draco breathed out the words, looking from the mark up to Harry's face in absolute shock.  "I forgot that you can speak parseltongue.."
“This is my house.”  Draco said, still speaking in a whisper and looking more and more scared.  “You can't be here, what if someone see's you?  How did you even get in??”
“I'm joking, Longbottom.  Mostly, anyways.”  Draco rolled his eyes then sipped coffee from the mug he'd been given, sighing as he moved to sit down on one of the stools at the counter.  “You look so disappointed in me.  Did you think I was all fully reformed and contrite and not at all a Malfoy anymore?”
It was clear by the end that several of the guests to the lunch would be awaiting further judgement by the time they left it.  Harry found himself trailing behind Zabini as they walked away to go back to their compartments and change.  He kept a few steps back, wanting to hear what Zabini said about the lunch and the people there, but knowing if any of them saw him there they wouldn't say a word.
"I can see that."
“That's okay.  I mean...  Friends lose touch...  Maybe he'd like to hear from you?”
What if Harry changed his allegiance? What if it was brought about accidentally? What if no one, not Harry, not his friends, not Borgin, not Voldemort, had any intention of it happening... But it did.
“Obviously.  You’ve been tracking me for weeks, did you think I wouldn’t notice and wouldn’t also know you’d figure it out?  But even with you knowing that, you can’t just walk up to Dumbledore and say ‘Draco’s disappearing, question him’. You have no real proof.”
The first website was a bust. Granted, the men there were gorgeous, but many were tied up in complicated knots or wore leather bondage gear. That wasn’t what I wanted, not with a man I didn’t know from Adam. Casting my eyes up at the clock I was surprised to see that nearly a quarter of my time had already passed.
Draco’s voice is calm and composed. The words don’t need the agitated emphasis from before, and they ring through the room after a mournful silence in an oddly monotonous way. It’s like Draco’s feelings, his view on all of that doesn’t matter because all he wants is being here for Harry.
Before he leaves the office of the goblin in charge of his financial business, he politely asks to go to the bathroom and refresh the glamour he had to
When Harry lies in bed that night, eyes dry and shoulders tense, he takes out his wand, casting lights and little figures against the dark ceiling. It’s astounding how forcefully he has to cast to just make some easy, playful charms like that, but it might be due to the heaps of electricity in his building. Watching a few stars twinkle and a clumsy doodle of a broom race across the walls, Harry indulges in reminisces.
“How are you doing?” I asked Draco.
. You wave your wand and then everything is magically better. You should save your worries for someone you can help.”
When Draco’s breathing changes again, and his moans suddenly quiet into a concentrated silence, Harry feels his muscles clench around him. He pulls Draco up on his knees, still impaling him with his cock, and he loops his hand around Draco’s hips to jerk him through his orgasm in quick, forceful movements. Draco seizes his arm tightly, hips jerking back against Harry’s cock and forth into his fist. “Keep going,” he pleads, and Harry tries his best to comply and concentrate on moving hands and hips, pushing deeper into Draco because Draco’s back arches beautifully when he does, and then Draco freezes. His twitching prick and arsehole are the only things in motion about Draco while he comes in hot streaks over Harry’s hands.
might get wind of them. After a shrug and a bite of food, Harry says, “I s’pose I can’t hide away here forever. Not if I’m with you and . . . not if I want to spend time with Andromeda and Teddy at some point.”
“Used to have.” Harry swallows. His mind drifts to cold-grey views across London and a mirage of Tarquin's smile. It seems like a lifetime ago, much like everything else in his mind is before the battle, before his death. “I’ve never thought about suicide,” Harry says, feeling like he needs to point that out. “Not about, well, actually doing it. Just about that it would’ve been easier sometimes to, you know . . . if I hadn’t come back.”
The last three weeks have been brilliant; living with Draco and the little plum who grows bigger and more pronounced with every day that passes. I hadn’t known how much I enjoyed caregiving but drawing Draco a bath or making him food that makes him smile fills me with so much pleasure.
He can’t though. He won’t. Harry repeats that like a mantra in his mind, feeling like he might forget if he didn’t.
“You want to?” Draco says, sounding unexpectedly hopeful. “I wasn’t sure whether to mention them or not. I didn’t want to put any pressure on you, so I figured I just . . .”
They’re interrupted by a voice on top of the stairs. “Vernon, darling? Who is it?” Then a shriek, fear, panic. And the thoughts drift to a closing door, a crying child and the sound evokes disgust. A perfect family on the settee, watching the telly. Just as it ought to be. Disrupted by the intruder, asking for water because it’s too hot to pick weeds in the sun. And perhaps a plaster because his knee is bleeding and full of dirt, dirt that’s coming off the wobbly little knee and ruins the freshly cleaned carpet.
There’s a Muggle painting on the wall across the settee, an odd one with a person sitting in a chair, his upper body vanishing into the darkness, creeping in from behind, his head fully consumed by it. It’s oddly striking, and Harry would stare at it for another few minutes if there weren’t Draco Malfoy—
That was the moment it happened. That was the moment the bump kicked him.
“And also try to
Okay, admittedly, he will likely have started regretting it by now, but this won’t take away the experience from me. Look, journal, I’m usually no one to rely on sympathy, but I take no shame in taking advantage of Potter while he felt as sorry for me as he did.
The last thing I wanted was to pry. Draco was fragile – he was pregnant and had just been made homeless – but then he sat down on the bed and indicated that I ought to sit beside him. I did so and after a moment of hesitation, I took his hand. “I know that the Manor was sold,” I said, remembering the arguments that they’d made for heavy reparations in the Wizengamot. “I never thought much of how it’d have affected you at the time. It ought to have done so. It was your home.”
” Harry asked Draco once when he dreaded the idea of leaving the house and pondered whether he could cancel seeing anyone for the next fortnight. But Draco smiled and held his hand, replying, “
“Oh, that’s nice,” Harry said with another sigh, pleased this time, and he turned a bit sideways to give Draco better access. “That’s so good.” Draco kneaded his shoulders and his neck, but it didn’t escape Harry that Draco’s hands wandered a bit further every so often, trailing down his spine, or up in his hair now and then, scraping his fingertips over Harry’s scalp. The sensations sent a fission of pleasure over his skin.
I snickered, moving my hips to put more friction in between us. “Partly, yes. I’d opine it’s one of the signs.”
“Stop it,” I said. “Stop doing
. We never came first with you. The truth is, you never stopped treating me like your rent boy. That’s all I’ve been to you, ever since October. Your pretty little toy. I’ve been your boyfriend-experience, haven’t I? Your family fantasy come to life! It stops
Harry scoots closer as they lie face to face on their sides, his leg hooked over Draco’s waist. He runs a finger over Draco’s slightly opened, velvety lips, down to the jut of clavicles that are naught but a blur without his glasses. Draco’s hand kneads his arse cheek, rubbing closer and closer to his crease, and Harry’s breathing gets heavy when a finger grazes his hole, followed by lube, charmed to be at body temperature. The head of the toy puts a firm weight into him as he feels it slip inside with one slow, gentle glide. He feels the toy and Draco’s hand somewhere in and on his arse and on his perineum.
I know how hard it is. I hope that she’ll be ready.
doesn’t reach a pair amidst the friends. One of them, a tall woman, has her lips at a man’s ear, whispering untenable promises while his hands squeeze her thighs with an unmistakable urgency. Her hand is more daring when she leans out of the kiss, heavy-lidded and open-mouthed as she reaches for his crotch, her posture pandering to his gaze and touch.
Draco stood and
,” the Weasel tried to explain, and Granger whispered, “
No doubt Fitzgerald had told all the other Arrows about his conquest by now. Draco imagined them slapping Fitzgerald on the back and shaking his hand. Draco felt his body shiver, and his chest grow tight. Perhaps Fitzgerald had told all his teammates he’d given Draco the fucking of his life.
No, but it’s real.
Potter was so certain that I’d find that guy attractive with his, admittedly, huge package, less body hair, tall he was as well. Harry was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to satisfy me and wouldn’t even be enough for me as a person. Average bloke, he called himself!
Teddy’s Christmas present from the two of us.
His hobbies all involved healthy, outdoor Muggle things like camping, and bike-riding and jogging, and seemingly, they all had to be completed in a very joyless, non-magical manner. Apparently, it built character. Draco’s cousin, little Teddy Lupin, was always being hauled away on these awful-sounding excursions. There was a long-standing open invite for Draco to join them.
Malfoy waves his hand dismissively. “Water under the bridge. We’re all shaped by the war, aren’t we? I don’t question panic attacks.”
I watched as Draco sat up and buttoned up his shirt over his small bump. He dangled his leg over the edge of the bed, and I helped him down.
Draco hesitates. He’s always worried about Wards. A relic of both his time with Voldemort and the time shortly after his return to England. Harry says, “Of course,” squeezing Draco’s shoulder as he pushes himself up. There is nothing Harry quite understands so viscerally as the urgency of love. “Let me adjust everything. They’ll have to Apparate right outside the atelier though.”
When he arrived, I was just finishing up on one of our MoonStar models, and though I waited for him to make his usual joke about giving my ‘shaft a good polish’ it never came. Perhaps Draco was hungry. He must have been. While the wizard was sitting at my drawing desk, he managed to consume most of a packet of Muggle biscuits, an act which is entirely out of character. He had always professed to not having a single sweet tooth in his head.
I shook the hand of Healer Bartsch, who’d been so open minded and non-judgmental, and who had helped us to meet you, our beautiful little plum. “Draco won’t have to lift a finger,” I assured him. “I’ll make sure that he and Cassie are well looked after.”
“This your place?” Draco asked, gesturing to the room. He took off his shoes, good manners ingrained. “It’s spectacular.”
“I’d rather not if it’s all the same to you,” came Harry’s reply. “Don’t get me wrong, Nott’s a nice chap and all, but too long in his company, and I might have to think about moving to Alaska. I've always wanted to study Polar bears.” He crossed the room before slumping down on the settee beside Draco. “What d'you reckon to my plan?”
Sunday soon came, and Pansy was every bit as vivacious and vibrant as always. She chided Draco on his appearance the minute he stepped through the fireplace. “Circe,” she cackled, taking in the sight of Draco’s loose, black wizard robes, his unstylish hair and the bags beneath his eyes, “who are you, exactly, and what have you done with my best-friend?”
“I just- I wasn’t sure because of your . . . well, your ex-wife.”
“We shouldn’t let the night end like that,” Harry finds himself suggesting. “I mean- Let’s find someone who'll sell us a few more pills or some mephedrone. Let’s go home and . . .”
“Well, you know what that means,” Draco says with a flippant gesture. “So . . . I came back to organise the funeral and everything, and I wrote my thesis back in home. But I couldn’t stay in the Manor. Gods below, it’s
A flash and Harry is on top of me, fucking into me with abandon, and I think, finally,
” And, “Punching Robards like a Muggle, Potter? I’ve always known you to be oafish brute, but even for you that’s a new low.” It wasn’t until the year that Harry was greeted with a look of disgust and the words, “
Malfoy’s face drops. “Sure,” he says, oddly distant. They sit in the living room on the dark-grey settee, the both of them served with a snuff spoon full of coke. Harry watches with amusement, massaging his nasal wings until his nostrils don’t feel dry anymore, as Malfoy shudders and sniffs, cursing all the deities above and below. It isn’t until after that Malfoy speaks again. “Back to Malfoy and Potter then, are we?”
"I don't have TIME for chances!' Draco said, the words strangling in his throat, making him cough and swallow hard.  "I'm out of time."
"It's fine.  I actually...  I like hearing that.  Not just about THIS in particular, but I like hearing what was going on in your part of the world at the same time as what was happening in mine.  It rounds things out a bit.  Things I never knew that actually fit into my timeline...  Anyways.." He shook his head, smiling as he went on.  "So we get into a bit of a scuffle and I pull my wand on him.  Which makes all his tosser mates howl with laughter, but Dudley just shuts the fuck up immediately.  He knows what the wand does and he's had a few run ins with wizards that didn't go well.  Then all of a sudden the weather turns.  The wind just goes crazy...  Dudley is yelling at me asking me what I'm doing but I didn't do anything.  We run...  And we're racing for home when all of a sudden there's dementors..."
Borgin's nod to Harry was grave, his tone serious and rather dark.  Enough that Harry swallowed, pocketing his wand again as he looked at the ring.  Considered his options.
“Wait.. Potter's divorced too?”  Draco set his bacon down, turning towards Neville with far more interest.  It had been SO long since he'd been around anyone to gossip with.  Although he was quite sure Neville wouldn't call this gossip.
She sounded reluctant to let them leave without a heavy dose of questioning, but she waved them away all the same.  They were almost out the door before Snape spoke again-
Draco made a strangled noise, startled by the words.  He jumped to his feet, reading them again, and then again as if he expected them to change.
It was on the tip of his tongue to say something incredibly cutting to the looming dark haired man but he bit it back, not wanting to get detention when he and Draco had so much going on.  “Probably right, Professor.  We'll go now...”
He was going to have to fish them out.  Ugh.  That was gross and...
“Yes.”  Harry nodded, smiling faintly at Draco as he reached to pick up the wand, holding it gently as he looked at the other man.  “So if you win it from me, it will once again be rightfully yours.”
But instead he pulled a piece of parchment towards himself and started trying to write Harry a letter.  Tried to think up good reason for his silence that wasn't the truth... Tried to find reasons to keep him at arms length.
“I suppose that's true.”  Draco said, then nodded, taking out the envelope of cash that Harry had brought him, asking how much it was and then clumsily counting out the money for him.
“Oh good, you're smiling.” A voice said and a body rounded the corner into the flat, carrying a box in the Muggle way so the person holding it couldn't be seen.
"Ahhhhh..." Harry nodded his head slowly and with a bit of a smile.  "Alright, now I understand.  Someone saw us together, she heard about it, now people are talking.  It
"You say that without even giving me a chance."
"I am right." Narcissa said, and said it with the sort of no questions tone only mothers had, which made it impossible not to believe her.
"I did tell you..." Harry smiled as he moved in to stand next to him.  "But what it lacks in frills it makes up for in taste."
“Oh so you are serving a purpose here.” Draco said icily, resenting Harry's presence, his closing the box on him like he was a child, and the tone of his voice.  “You aren't just here to have a look at a Malfoy in the Muggle world?”
"Harry?"
Exhaling a long breath that seemed to come from the soles of his feet, Draco pulled his wand from his back pocket and held it out to Harry.  “I really wish you would reconsider.”  He said without looking at Harry.
Draco hesitated for a moment, warring the old instinct to keep everything to himself.  But he knew that in the grand scheme of things it no longer mattered.  He was likely dead one way or another at this point.
"You can't be THAT surprised."  Draco said with a chuckle, feeling the redness in his cheeks get even hotter.  "And I mean.. you are..."
Not that it really did matter, his cake was going to be MAGICALLY perfect at the end no matter how he did this.
(Told in chapters that vary between Before the war and after the war, and varying points of view between Draco and Harry. It is not told in any sort of order, but bounces around to slowly round out.
Fridges opened and closed.
He could lose himself like this, wrapped up in the blonde boy, their mouths pressed together, their tongues curling against each other slowly and deeply.  The feel of him had become so familiar despite how they seemed to weave in and out of each other's lives almost violently.  But he could lose himself here, and happily, too.
“Theodore...”  Draco practically whispered out the word, everything in him squeezing, twisting up.  The air fizzling from his lungs and his blood at a very rapid pace as an odd drumming sound filled his ears.
Not enough air...
“My father’s?  Yes.  I know it sees strange since I never really knew him, but every little bit of him I did find was something I held onto almost murderously tightly.  Hating Slytherin was one of those things. I regret it now.”
Harry himself took the Dark Mark and fell into rank as a Death Eater?
And the mention of a couple of people Draco never wanted to hear about again.  ;)
“Dumbledore.”  Draco spoke the one word answer, then turned his head quickly as this time Harry faltered and shifted at his response.  He couldn't help but wonder if now he had gone too far.  If this would be the line drawn between them and this new friendship.  If this was the one thing Harry wouldn't be able to accept...
-----------------------------------
He could swear he still felt it's presence on his finger but it wasn't there.  He couldn't see it and couldn't feel it with his fingers.  And yet the comforting solid sort of energy that had come with it `was still present.
Draco nodded his head, something in him warming a bit then, thawing his body and he smiled slightly.  "That's very kind, considering who we are."
With time passing, Harry and Draco have been meeting to talk about what should be done next.  Draco wishes he could just fly away somewhere altogether and is surprised that Harry of all people knows exactly what he means.  They're getting closer by leaps and bounds, but neither of them can shake the fact that time is running out.
"I said shut UP, Malfoy!  Get away from me."  Harry shifted a few inches further away, hardly moving at all, all things considered, as Draco moved right in front of him.
“I kind of am.”  Harry admitted, then laughed with Draco, his heart fluttering in his chest.  “I don't even know why, exactly but that seems like... Good news?”
He waited until he was sure the other boy was well gone before he took in a deep breath, held it for a moment then let it out in a rush.
God that was good...
"Where's the trust, Potter?"  Draco groused at him without meaning it.
Now they were extremely infrequent and until now had been completely untroublesome.  There were never names on them he recognized as intruders.  And what did it matter who went into the Manor- or tried to- anyways?  He should just stop opening them...
Draco avoids everybody’s gazes, trying with occlumency when more memories of the three bubble on the surface, gnawing at the edges of his sanity. More shouts and crying, the noise of an electric Muggle razor right by a child’s ear, a cruel desire to make him fit in with everybody else. Fears.
“Mimir...  Did you miss me?” Draco said quietly to the owl, chuckling when the owl snapped his beak harder at him, seeming to insinuate that yes, he had missed him, but he also had a LOT to make up for by sending him away.
He took several deep breaths, pushing his hands up into his hair, fisting in the strands tightly for a few moments before sliding his hands back down over his mouth, staring at the parchment on his desk.
“How many?”  Draco looked slightly taken aback for a moment before shaking his head.  “I don't know.  You create them by committing murder.  You kill someone and that sort of creates the right circumstances to split your soul.  The book made it sound like it was a perfectly ghastly process.”
“Have everything?”  Tom asked, then smirked as he raised his wand.
With a jolt, he remembered that he'd tossed a Galleon in there when he'd moved into this office.  A strange Galleon, not one you could spend because it wasn't actual currency.  This was a relic from Dumbledore's Army, a coin that the members had used to communicate with each other.  He'd known that members were using them all fifth year, but this one he didn't lay hands on until sixth.
"No.." Narcissa said, shaking her head and sighing softly.  "I care that you're happy.  I don't care who it's with or not with.  I knew you and Astoria would not make a romantic match, but I also knew that you would do well enough as friends that you would somehow come to an arrangement within your marriage. I've thought for a long time that you must not really be together anymore."
"I know."  Harry said, smiling a bit from where he stood across the room.  "But I'm bad with time."
How had this banality been what he appreciated in friendship before Draco?
“What are you doing??”
That made Harry laugh again and Draco smirked a little more, inside and out.  He did like making him smile and laugh.  It was always a little triumph when he did.
“It's still a barbaric task.  And I still think it isn't at all fair that he's put it on you...”  Harry spoke carefully, watching the other boy just as carefully.
Draco- So stop asking me trick questions.
at a time like this.  You want to help him with this task Voldemort set him, but you don't tell him how you will, fine.  Maybe you have your reasons for that."  It almost physically pained Harry to say that last bit but he soldiered on.  "At least help him openly with this."
“When you own your own shop and it performs reasonably well, you don't have to be here every day.”
Harry sighed, looking around at the impeccably clean and orderly kitchen that belonged to his Aunt and Uncle.
"Liar.  Tell me why and I'll leave you alone.  I'll even leave the bathroom entirely if that's what you want."
The poor Malfoy child who got dragged into everything with no choice.  Made into a Death Eater against his will, forced to carry out unspeakable tasks or face death if he said no.
Jumped and lurched.
--------------------------------------------
“That’s debatable.” Harry said, since it was debatable whether or not he had won it fairly in that fight.  Nothing had been fair about any of the fights leading into the war.  “I know you have another but I know you felt the same about your wand as I felt about mine.  I never wanted another, I just wanted my own.”
"You're still here right now.  You're still alive right this second.  You have time."
But that relief didn't come.  Even as he stood there and tried to force himself to feel it, all he really felt was sick, worried and horribly upset.
"True."  Harry smiled a bit, his eyes travelling over Draco's face and down to his shoulders, taking a step towards where he was sitting just a short distance away.  "Can I ask you something?"
If anyone had asked him what the 'worst case scenario' was with this set up, he wouldn't have said it was getting caught and killed by whoever the 'new power' out there was.  It would have been having Harry fucking Potter find out about and then witness one of his panic attacks.
Draco- Well most of it went to the phone. Which I assume is not what it was for and so I considered it a loan until I could get money from my account to pay it back.  But as I am not allowed to use any magic what so ever, I can't get the money myself.
overzealously than usual since you're back with them.  And maybe somewhere along the way we learn how to fix it.”
"Now there's a question."  Harry laughed, shaking his head.  "Well...  We could just do nothing and see what happens with Snape.  That's if you trust him utterly and completely to take care of things the right way so you and your family are safe..."
can't kill Dumbledore, but what is he playing at making YOU do it?  That's just cruel....”
Harry wanted to punch that look off his face...  But instead he shook his head.
I'm sorry for that.  I'm so unreliable.  But at least I -have- actually been eventually returning here to spend some more time writing.  At this pace maybe I'll be finished in a mere decade!  ;)
"You have no idea how glad I am to hear that."
"Nah.  Just didn't feel like being in the common room with them.  What are you up to?"
"I couldn't agree more."  Draco said honestly, relaxing a bit as the conversation wound away from what he'd said quite naturally.  "He's spent time in both the Wizarding World and the Muggle world, it's surprising just how beneficial that is."
“They're nice enough.  But most of them are a lot busier than this.  We wanted to scatter people around as much as possible which meant beggars couldn't be choosers when it came to location.  This was definitely the nicest.”
"I didn't say anything."  Harry continued, moving his pinky finger to touch Draco's fingers on the side of his knee.  "The look on my face must have been terrified. At first she had this look like she thought she was getting through to me and I was scared I'd lose her.  But then.. it sunk in and she knew.  She's so smart, she knew what that look really meant.  We did talk more about it.  Not a lot, though, she was so angry.  And with every right to be."
He learned about 'phone numbers' and watched as Neville put his and Harry's and a few other of the Auror's names and numbers into his phone.  He explained what to press to open his 'texts' and showed him how to send one.  Then sent one of his own to Draco so he knew what the phone would sound like when a text came in.
Just one swing.  Just one hit.  Merlin it would feel good.
And both Snape and McGonagall would agree that it was more than a little unsettling.
“TINDER!?”
Beaming young Auror.
“I'd be willing to guess not ours.” Draco said, walking up to and pushing open the door that was now showing itself to them.
Draco said the one word, and then ducked his head.  He knew that just that one syllable had come out with such a disappointed inflection that Harry could not have missed it.
After he sent his text to Neville, Draco hefted himself up off the couch and unlocked the door as he went past it to the kitchen.  He opened the cupboard to take down two big mugs and was in the fridge poking carefully through his still grouped groceries to take the milk carton out when the door of his flat opened and closed again.
Draco thought Kreacher might keel over and die from sheer joy at that moment.  He had to work hard not to laugh as he watched the tiny House Elf try and drag BOTH full bags towards the basement door, despite them weighing at least twice what he did.
But to avoid that would mean leaving his mother alone with his father.
But it was.  And it was even better than the first time.
“It isn't, really.”  Harry admitted, setting the menu down again.  He spoke pleasantly to someone who took the order (Draco refused to look at whoever it was), just the same as in a wizard restaurant, and then they were left alone again.  “But you need someone else here for your first go just in case.”
"That's going to be really tricky.  Finding a way to communicate with my mother."  Draco said, but his eyes narrowed a bit as he obviously started thinking.
"By the end of the school year."  Draco said quietly, holding just as tight to Harry's hand. "He's getting restless but he won't go back on it.  He wants the job done more than he wants to murder me, at least right now."
Chapter Summary -  Harry, Ron and Hermione are heading back to Hogwarts and Harry, for one, can't wait to maybe get a little space.  Even from his closest friends...  He's tired of talking about what Draco might be up to.  It just doesn't seem to be their business...  And even he IS up to something, Harry is sure he has a good reason for it.
“Yes, of course.” Harry said as he stacked his papers and moved them to the side so he could have some clear space between him and Draco.  “It’s nothing truly terrible, I don’t think...  I just wanted to have this conversation with you face to face.  Scorpius is doing well in class but he seems... frightened.”
"Yes.  But PLEASE tell me you have different robes than the vicar looking ones you wore to the Winter Ball in year four..."
Re-telling in AU what happens when Harry finds Draco in the bathroom in book six. It wasn't supposed to be a chaptered fic but as I was writing it I realized there was no way to say everything in one part. So we'll see where it takes us!
Harry kind of liked that look.
Draco drew back from the window and looked towards his own door, wondering what was going on.
This wasn't what Harry would have ever expected to happen.  But then, not much of his life was turning out anything like he expected it to.   But this?  Sitting in a reproduction of Draco's bedroom, his hand held tight in a trembling grip from the other boy, talking about how Draco had to kill Dumbledore or Voldemort would kill him and his family?  That was, even for him, something that he never would have expected.
“He wouldn't listen to you.. That's too bad... I thought maybe--”
“Oh..”  Draco faltered slightly, surprised to hear Harry mention the names of two of his Slytherin classmates.  “I'm not NOT friends with them if that counts for anything?  Why...?”
It wasn't a stretch to look harried.  But this was the tough part.  It was one thing to magically make the things he wanted, even if that was going to be tricky.  Faking out two people who had made a life out of baking was going to be harder.
"Now that I really can't tell you.  But I can show you what it is he should have been asking for."
"This has to stop."  Draco said the second he knew he could speak without his voice shaking.
“So I said it wrong.”  Draco said as they were leaving the store, already pulling the phone out to fiddle with as they walked back towards his building.
Draco smiled, letting out a soft sigh.  It was fully and very dark now and while he knew he had to get home, he was reluctant to do so.  The whole evening had been rather wonderful.  A slow start, neither of them had known how to interact with each other.  But they'd overcome that awkwardness faster than Draco would ever have expected.  The years at Hogwarts didn't seem to matter anymore.  Whatever issues they'd had with each other... it was like they'd been between two different people than the ones that sat here now.
Chapter Summary-  Harry is on a mission now to find out all he can about sending a message to Narcissa Malfoy and keeping it secret and safeguarded.  He led Draco to believe the other boy knew who he would be going to for the help but he might not have been totally honest.  He needed to know the advice he was getting was the best, and to him there was only one person that he trusted for that...
“Oh... Right...”  Ron looked a little sheepish and a little pained as he rubbed his head, looking apologetically at Harry before he spoke again.  “But how do you know that's really what Draco needs?”
Harry sighed out a long low breath as Draco moved his hand out between those slender inches and touched the other boy's side.  "We're both stuck."
Silence stretched after he spoke, and he could practically feel the hesitation in Neville.  Could feel him fighting against saying whatever it was in his head or the tip of his tongue.
“No..”  Harry said, shaking his head.  “Neither did just trying very very small objects.  He thought he might have to build up to larger things.  And he tried non-living things and living things--”
Draco grimaced.  If Harry had just not included that last word.  He had been too caught up in his self satisfied probing of the dark haired boy to think too much about the fact that they were naked.  But Harry mentioning it made him PAINFULLY aware of the fact.  And the fact that he had been standing on very full display of the other boy before he got into the water.
"Thank you..."
Presently, there was a knock on his door that roused him from his thoughts, looking up he saw the still pale and still pointed despite age face of Draco Malfoy.
"Please be safe..." Harry said quietly, reaching one hand out to touch Draco's cheek, the only thing he felt he could safely do.  More than that and he might have grabbed the other boy and refused to let go for anything.
He did the polite thing and offered them tea, and then stretched his politeness as far as it would go as they talked in low urgent voices about the 'New Power' that was being rumoured.  Someone who was seizing control and seemed to lean towards the side of things Voldemort did.
"Why do you smell sweet?"
“You were actively looking to get into a fight with me.  For no reason.”
Actually, Draco wasn't exactly sure what this was.
"He can't come to the school.  None of his Death Eaters can either.  I'm safe here until the end of the year.  Maybe I'll leave before school finishes, go to the safe house with her.  We can stay there..."
"No.  He just said to leave it with him.  He'd take care of it."
"It's done."
Harry's voice was muffled through the thick wood of Malfoy Manor's front door.  Draco stood on the other side of it, chewing on his lower lip.
When they got to a room on an upper floor that had been a study, Harry paused in the doorway, hesitating as he stared at the desk against one wall.
“Take a tour with me or you'll be left on your own to figure out how everything works and make an utter spectacle of yourself.”  Harry said nonchalantly.  He didn't look at Draco as he spoke, tucking the stolen (by Draco's mind, anyways) wand into his coat pocket.
Once he'd gotten Mimir some water and food and made sure he was comfortable, Draco went into the kitchen to make coffee for himself.  As he was pouring water into the coffee maker, he couldn't help but smile.  Just a little bit...
He slid down off the counter and followed Tom into the living room, but as he stepped into it, it changed to a wide, dark panelled and richly furnished room that Harry could now place as part of Malfoy Manor.  In the centre of the room, slightly floating above a pointed pedestal was a Pensieve.
“It is Voldemort.”  Draco said, sighing out a long deep breath.  He waited, sure this time that Harry would ask him more, and he was right.  After a few minutes of silence the dark haired boy spoke again.
“I didn't need to be out there.  My cloak was open because I pulled it on really quickly.  I saw you were out there by yourself so I went out, too.”
Even as he thought that last bit he knew it wasn't right.  Draco was, actually, far less tactile than he was with his friends and that was saying something.
He hadn't expected to find him crying.  Harry wasn't sure what he had expected when he had tracked him to the bathroom, but this wasn't it.  And anything he'd planned to say or do, everything he'd been thinking about for months and weeks of tracking him and trying to figure out what he was up to was gone.
So as Draco managed to open the button and the zipper on Theodore's pants, they were also coming up with their own version of the Slytherin Crest.  As though that pointless and benign conversation would cover the red in Theodore's cheeks and the clip in his breath that Draco loved to hear.
"I doubt whatever it was.. was real.."  Draco said slowly, half trying to convince himself of that after his hopes had raised and then fallen with Harry's story.
Harry smiled, nodding at Draco and rapped his knuckles against the door frame as he went out.  “Don't forget to lock the door after me.”  He called up the hall again, just as he had the evening before.
"Nothing."  Harry said, shaking his head and chuckling a bit as he leaned back in his chair.  "I've just not seen the sharp tongued Draco Malfoy in a very,
“I'm not your Lord, Draco.  Not here and certainly not when I look like this.”  He tilted his head a bit to the side as he looked at the blonde boy with obvious interest.  “He's Harry, you're Draco and I'm Tom.  Understood?”
He was worried that leaving her with his father would be a death sentence.
“You were having a--”
And the rest..  It blurred through his mind in a tumble, far less clear than it was in Harry's memory.
What if Harry changed his allegiance? What if it was brought about accidentally? What if no one, not Harry, not his friends, not Borgin, not Voldemort, had any intention of it happening... But it did.
"Draco, come on...  Just open the door..."
"I'm just thinking, Harry."  Dumbledore said and Harry saw his chin bob as he nodded.  "Just thinking, give me a moment."
"You know."  Draco said, shifting and trying to turn towards Harry, but failing since they were already crammed onto the ledge as it was.  "Catch him being totally unfair to you.  Get proof and then confront him with it.  Threaten to go to Dumbledore or someone if he doesn't start actually grading you right."
“I know.”  Tom said. He moved closer to Harry, walked right up to him with a slightly curious and ever so slightly challenging look on his face.  He stood just between Harry's knees and when he wasn't stopped and harry didn't try to move, he slowly slid both hands onto the tops of his knees, then a little higher, his thumbs sliding against the insides of the other boy's thighs before stopping halfway up.  “I've figured out how.”
"Thank you."  Draco said, swallowing hard as he squeezed Harry's hand tight.  "I mean really, Harry...  I've never done anything to deserve this help from you."
"Clearly.  But this won't stop now."
“What is all this..”  He asked, glancing at Neville then back to the window, tilting his head as he looked at everything curiously.
"She IMPLIED, though."  Draco said, practically throwing himself down into the chair he'd just jumped up from.
Harry made a petulant noise, letting go of Draco who released him easily, snaking his hands back to straighten his bunched robes.
Panic rose in Draco in a way he hadn't anticipated.  He always thought that once he got that letter- and he knew someday he would- he would be relieved.  That final tie that had him bound to the world he once knew would be dissolved, he would truly be free.
One o’clock seemed to arrive with the same dull inescapability that Draco had always associated with his return to Hogwarts after blissfully unclouded summers. Sighing at himself in the bedroom mirror, Draco examined himself from every angle.
Harry
Muggle bicycle would have been able to fight Fitzgerald off, but he didn’t have a chance. He couldn’t even speak. Fitzgerald, was assaulting his face with kisses that would have shamed the Giant Squid, and he couldn’t fucking move.
“Is it true that there were
“Can you-
“You want to know more about it?” Draco asks, meaning the phoenix perch. Harry nods. “I’m sorry that I blindsided you like I did before. It’s just that I wasn’t sure if we would see each other again. I didn’t want to let the chance pass, but then I-” Draco clears his throat. “Anyway, it’s a phoenix perch, like I said. Big enough to house two if the birds are compatible. It’s made from a fire resilient copper that’s able to persist the heat of their Burn  Day. It might actually be forged in a phoenix’ fire, but I don't know if I'll ever know. Copper was very at the time. At the turn of the century, that is.”
He’s alone in the flat. When Nick stopped by earlier, asking whether he was okay through the closed door, Harry didn’t bother to answer. He can’t abide the idea of being approachable right now, of looking into Nick’s eyes, gleaming with something between understanding and worry. Jesus, he can’t abide the idea of being alive right now. He wants to lose all these infuriating feelings or maybe he’s afraid of exactly that, but what he needs is a few more days alone—in this flat, in a crowded club, it doesn’t matter where, he’ll feel alone all the same as long as there is  no one there who knows him.
"It wasn't much fun.  But might be more fun if you were there."  Harry raised his eyebrows a bit at Draco, smiling at him.
But here he was.  Harry knew.  And now Longbottom knew.  And likely the other Aurors.  There was a good chance whenever he got back to the Wizarding World, IF he got back to it at all, everyone would know.
Harry shook his head again, wrinkling his nose a bit.  "Not especially.  I'm tired of the conversations there.  Tired of the people."  He raised his shoulders in a small shrug.  "Hey, I was surprised you weren't at the Slug Club lunch on the train.  You should have come, it would have been more fun."
Tom raised one hand between them and very very gently touched his index finger to the middle of Harry's lower lip.
"Eh..." Draco made the noise and raised one shoulder in indecision.
“Right...”  Draco laughed, sliding back on the couch a bit and turning towards Harry a little more.  “There was a lot I didn't understand until I got older, but the basic idea is that there is a way, through incredibly dark magic, to split your soul.  And when you split it you can like... embed it into an object and the object will keep it safe.  And so long as your Horcux is safe, you can never
through Draco's veins, leaving him absolutely speechless as he looked at Harry, his eyes as blazing as grey eyes could be.  "That nasty... Of all the...." He spat the words out in unfinished sentences, absolutely livid.
“I got it.  I've been to the bank.”  Harry said, smirking a little more.  “Honestly, do you think so poorly of the Aurors that they wouldn't get it off to me immediately?  Here...”  Harry took a bulging envelope from his pocket and set it down on the counter, eyeing it rather oddly.  “I don't know what you need so much money for.  Your living expenses are all paid for.”
“...Right.  Well, we thought that would be best since what you've told Neville has sort of implied that Nott could be very particular and very sensitive when it comes to communication.”  Harry paused there, then continued when all Draco did was nod his head.  “Your communication with Nott will be unmonitored  Which makes me VERY nervous, but since you have, for the most part, been very co-operative in everything we're doing I don't see any reason not to trust you.”
Harry moved instinctually to pull Draco into him and when the blonde boy's legs buckled he carefully got them down onto the floor.
Panic was rising in him now properly.  He could retrace his steps, he was pretty sure he knew which way he'd come, but what if something was tracking him by them?  What if something was already following right to where he was??
He started pulling his ingredients towards him, sorting through them as he tried to remember everything he was supposed to do.  It was 'Cake Week', as he was pretty sure it always was in the first week of each season.  He was making a cherry cake shaped like a cauldron with... something inside of it.
Harry laughed properly then, and shifted a bit to get more comfortable before he started to run his fingers through Draco's hair just as he'd seen Pansy doing.
"Not to mention the rest of the Weasley clan, probably Lupin and Tonks and Kingsley and the rest of the Order."  Harry dramatically counted off all the people he spoke about on his fingers like he was nearing a hundred, not a dozen.
His heart resumed it's normal rhythm, faster than it should be, but it wasn't skipping beats and then trying to catch them up again.
you I was there that day and I heard everything you said to him.  Make good on your word.  Just scare him a little bit, hm?”
But Draco just realized that once his mother was taken care of, there was nothing that would stop him ensuring that Harry won this war.
Anything Draco was about to say in response never came when he, instead, let out an involuntary hiss of pain, dropping his quill and clutching his right hand to his left forearm.  Harry stayed silent, his interest pricking but not wanting to say anything.  He'd seen how protective Draco was about his left arm.  Seen how carefully he kept the sleeve pulled so far down it almost covered his hand.  He'd seen him absently rubbing at it, but never like this.
He took in a hard breath, only realizing as the air hit his lungs that he hadn't been breathing for awhile.  At least not properly and not deeply.  That first rush of air made his head spin even more but it was like water in a parched throat it hit him so keenly.
Once he was back upstairs he actually started poking through his cupboards and fridge for the first time, really taking stock of all the things that he and Harry had purchased on that first day.  Most of it he didn't recognize, or have any idea what to do with, but some of it he happily realized he had seen in 'commercials' on television.
Draco made a rather undignified noise of surprise.  He hadn't been expecting that.  He was prepared for almost anything else, steeling himself against rejection, preparing himself for a lot of padded conversation about how it didn't matter, they could still be friends.
He hadn't wanted to meet Draco anywhere but the Room of Requirement but Ron and Hermione had been tailing him lately.  Asking a lot of questions about where he was going all the time.  He had started off with lying and saying it was stuff from his meetings with Dumbledore that he had to take care of.  But they only accepted that with no explanation for so long.  Mostly because at this point they knew Dumbledore had given Harry permission to tell them about what they discussed.
“No, what was brilliant was thinking up using a Vanishing Cabinet in the first place.”  Harry said, looking admiringly at the other boy, then his face fell a bit, his shoulders visibly sagging.  “This will mean we have to play it cool for awhile.”
A very difficult letter...
Neville's voice, Draco leaned in closer to the door, as if he listened hard enough he'd be able to tell if the other man was in his right mind.
"...Yeah?"
“Come in.”  He said, beckoning with a slight smile, gesturing to the chair that McGonagall had declined to sit in.  “Thank you for coming.”
The house would hide NOTHING from him.  There was so much about Malfoy Manor Draco didn't know.  That he wasn't privy to the way his father was.  Secret rooms, hiding places, god knows WHAT still in them left over from his father's reign.  Most likely from his grandfather's reign as well.
Draco sighed and Harry could have sworn the air came from the soles of his feet it was so deep.  He just looked at the other boy, everything in him aching with sympathy and emotion for his situation.  And for him, personally.  Harry was, it had to be said, finding it harder and harder not to feel personally attached to Draco.  Through all of this, through his unhappiness, through his desperation, through his fear and his emotion, he'd gotten to see the real Draco under his ice and armour.
“So do you feel okay about everything?” Harry asked, dragging a chip through a puddle of ketchup.  Not to eat, though, Draco had been watching him swirl the chip around in ketchup for a few solid minutes.
Eventually, the doors swung open. An older man walked through the doors, with a timed grey beard and kind eyes. “Mr Potter,” he said, sticking out his hand for me to shake. “One of the most famous faces I’ve ever seen on my ward. You acted very speedily today, and Mr Malfoy owes you a great debt for your quick thinking. Now, please don’t worry. I understand that everything was very dramatic when you arrived, but we’ve managed to stabilise Mr Malfoy’s condition. It would seem that the magical centre of baby Malfoy’s cerebral cortex had been on a bit of a growth spurt. In regular, or witch pregnancies, this development is a relatively smooth process. In this regard it would seem that wizard pregnancy is a little dissimilar.”
Harry can’t help feeling rather forlorn when Draco wants to try whatever exactly he’s found out in Leeds down in the workshop. Harry trails behind, feeling like a neglected puppy, until his mind goes oddly blank the moment Draco ceases talking in favour of concentration.
from the shelf and slid it inside of his player. He pressed play.
, for that matter. Once the magicked tea service is over, Harry braces himself for a stilted conversation, half hoping they’d do a line right here and now already.
“Addicted? I am not,” Harry says pointedly. The words taste a bit bitter on his tongue, and he swallows, trying not to think about last day’s, last week’s, last month’s resolutions. “It’s just . . . fun. And it makes things so much easier.”
I watched as a large, rotund woman stood up, aided by the man at her side. Together they waddled off, and I felt Draco’s hand stiffen in my own. It was a stark reality that he’d be that big in a few months, and that there’d be no hiding the plum from the rest of the world. I know that Draco feared the public’s reaction, but I wished that he wouldn’t. I’d never, ever let him come to any harm. Draco was so lost in his own thoughts that he didn’t even notice when another Mediwizard arrived and called out his name.
“It’s partly because you’re pregnant,” the git replied. But then he demurred with a self-deprecating laugh, “But trust me, I’m everything but a good person.”
, as Draco stubbornly keeps on saying—which resembled tachycardia on ecstasy in a club that’s so crowded that you get on your tiptoes and crane your head, just in order to have one gulp of fresher air. In both good and bad ways.
Alright. Here goes.
– and every so often, the sky is illuminated with bright red and green behind my thin curtains. I can hear the shouts of Muggles, their noise muffled by the glass. They’re deep in their cups, making their way home from the Islington firework display that’s held at the park at the end of Grimmauld Place.
I tried with some dirty talk while I mouthed his prick up and down, licking and kissing the soft skin. His dick twitched, and he shoved himself deeper into my grip when I asked him if he wants to fuck me. I liked seeing Potter like that. A quivering mess, pleading for me to allow him pleasure. Fuck, I get hard when I even think about it.
“Yes, finally,” Draco agreed. He wiggled his hand free and moved it up Harry’s arm until it rested on his shoulders. Gently, he started to rub away a few knots that had tensed up there sometime during the day.
Draco scanned the room, looking for anyone else to talk to. Merlin, but Harry Potter was boring fucking company.
Harry takes a deep breath.
“Indeed.”
It doesn’t take even a whole hour until Harry feels his concentration deteriorate rapidly with a faint feeling emanating in his belly. He tries for another few minutes, and just when he wants to tell Draco that he needs to rest for a bit, Draco is by his side, a kiss on the top of his head.
We sit centimetres apart, though I can’t help but crave his touch. I lean down to untie my Oxfords, cursing the slim fit suit I’m wearing. At last, my socketed feet are freed and perched in Harry’s lap, his hand on my ankle.
“What?”
Fucking whilst on you knees sometimes tends to get exhausting on your thighs after a while. And ever since I’m pregnant, it sometimes feels weird to have this jolt go through your body with each thrust. The feeling usually wants to make me curl my hands over my belly even if the movements are not that hard.
The Muggle stares at them, maw gaping, eyes comically wide. His gaze arrives at Draco.
Harry hummed affirmatively, sitting down on the settee behind his family. But Godric, the sight never failed to warm his heart.
Draco felt faint. This was his worst nightmare, come true. Time seemed to slow down, and he felt intense shock like he’d fallen from a broomstick or been submerged in icy water. He took a step backwards and stumbled over a chair. He’d gotten so big that his centre of gravity was off, and it took him a moment to find his feet. When he finally managed it, Draco looked up at his colleague. Cormac’s eyes were cruel, and they stared at him, full of vitriol.
“I don’t know how you dare show your face,” Cormac finished. “You weren’t raped. You’ve been with a million men and that brat’s father could have been any of them. You don't even know how to say no! You’re garbage. Human garbage.”
“Salazar,” I sighed, burying my face in my hands. “Why don’t you fight with me? Is it only because I’m pregnant or are you honestly just to fucking good to get down to my level?”
the Muggles who’d see him.
Fitzgerald pushed inside of him and after that, Draco didn’t speak anymore. He didn’t want to fight, and he didn’t want to move. Draco let his body go limp as Fitzgerald pounded into him, let his own consciousness drift around the room like a spectre.
“So, are they playing Muggle songs in wizarding pubs now? Or how come you’re so up to date about music?”
After all, I was his client, and if I hadn’t falsified a Muggle identity, Draco might have used barrier protection. Now he’s visibly pregnant and his dedicated clients pay handsomely for the privilege. I am the one who has limited Draco’s livelihood.
Harry was every bit the gentleman that he is outside of bed. He lubed himself up very thoroughly, asked me if I was comfortable when I was kneeling right before him, my back against his chest, and he told me if anything hurt, I ought to tell him so immediately. He was kissing everywhere he could reach when he pushed inside. I held myself up against the headboard, and we started out nice and slow, just how I love it. His prick is the perfect size to have comfortable, very pleasurable sex.
"Oh, hell. It's hideous. My singing voice is completely embarrassing. It's fun to watch though. I've been to karaoke bars several times."
“You can try,” Harry mumbles against Draco’s neck, not quite done molesting him. He runs his hands through his hair which seems to shine even whiter in between the earthy colours, not mentioning that the perfectly sleek strands are harbouring some dirt now. His mind spins to the bathtub where he’ll wash it out later.
, I suppose.”
“Thanks,” Harry replies, feeling somehow rude and not as invested as he maybe should be. “Er, I think I need to get home sometime soon. No idea where we are though.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The day is bright with pale skies and thin light. The Manor is perfectly symmetrical with trimmed hedges to either side, an imposing iron-wrought fence, and with its white stone walls rising high above the flat land.
The music vibrates through his body, rushing through his system and past his ears in one shared beat with his pulse, every fibre in his body undulating in a harsh rhythm. Harry wants to feel like this forever, doesn’t want this night ever to end. At least it will last until after sunrise, thanks to the ecstasy they took and the spares they still have.
that the Alchemist Board so generously offered, and it’s a very rare one. I will never hear the end of it if you change your mind.”
“But I’m sure the better part of the parents just wants an easy way to contact their children while they’re at school. Especially for the Muggleborn wixen—it’s hard for their parents to just accept that their children are meant to study and be so secluded from them. They are dependent on their children writing to them so that they can reply by return owl. It’s very impractical,” Hermione says. Harry realises that, back in Hogwarts, he never wondered much about Hermione’s parents or how they communicated. It’s not like Harry was in a similar predicament; there certainly wasn’t one thing the Dursleys would have wanted to write to him about.
to catch up. “He didn’t listen to me,” Draco answered, the silence around them loud as a scream. “I told him to stop and he didn’t.”
this. I’m not in the mood anymore, and-“
“Not shave, not if you don’t want to. Trim that thing, sweet Circe.”
The first thing I did in the hotel room was to sweep James into a kiss. Well, what can I say? He MELTED. He was surprised to be pushed up against the wall, but when our mouths connected, he thawed into my touch.
He’s sat in a living room without any recollection of getting there.
“Kiss me,” Harry prompts. Draco smiles and after a second, he leans down to put his warm lips on Harry’s, fingers trailing over Harry’s Adam’s apple. It feels intimate to have his fingers and a blade at his exposed neck. Something about it makes Harry think that he couldn't  go on with his life if he were made bereft of that care and the deep feeling it evokes.
That evening Harry accompanied Draco to the Manor. He showed his Mother the ultrasound image of the bump that he’d been given and he told her everything that had happened to him since August.
Draco was breathing heavily, his taut abdomen, lined with beautifully pale stretch marks, pulsing as he shoved his hips into Harry’s hands. “We want to,” he agreed, fervently.
The Mediwizard frowned again, and I swear that I felt the temperature drop in the room.
It had become therapeutic.  Each time he wrote, he said many of the same things.  That he was sorry.  That he really hadn't wanted the war.  In some letters he went into more detail about his family dynamics and why things were the way they were.  In others, like the one he'd just finished, he felt like he shouldn't bother Harry with too many details.  So he skimmed over them lightly.
"It was going to be Daphne, but she refused and her parents told her that if they could find someone more suitable then she wouldn't have to marry me.  She ended up with someone her dad's age in need of a wife after his first one passed away.  So Astoria got stuck with me because one of the Greengrass' had to marry a Malfoy."
What would happen when 'The Chosen One" decided he liked the idea of a Wizarding World, if not an entire world, under the power of Voldemort?
But tears coursed from him, sobs bubbled up in his throat as he cowered in the fetal position on the floor.  Shaking, crying, terrified.
Then he wrote another letter.  And then another, and another and another.  They added up over the years, he had a drawer full of them.
"When you have spoken to Draco, when he has read this and is ready, ask him to write his letter to his mother.  I give my solemn word that I will change nothing of what he writes, but please impress upon him that the fewer personal notes and information he gives the better for all involved.  And that his letter should be short, the longer it is, the longer the words stay where others may see them.  I will have an owl ready and waiting, come back to me as soon as you can."
"Of course I am.  Why wouldn't I be?"
Harry kept arching into him, kept grinding forward and he matched every shift and press of hips, his breath short and quick.
Draco’s head tipped back a bit further, his eyes lidded as they looked at the darker boy, his lips slightly parted.
"I trust you, sir.  And I think that we'd be in good hands with you actively helping." Harry smiled as he nodded and was rather pleased at the happy smile Dumbledore gave him in return.
"I thought you knew everything.  I thought you of all people would be told EVERYthing.."  Draco said, moving to lean against the wall next to Harry.
to go this way, then double back to go left instead.
"Are your Aunt and Uncle really terrible?"  Draco asked, stretching his legs out as well, comparing how much difference there was between his and Harry's together.
"I'm not up to anything, I swear."  Harry said, then made a noise of frustration when Draco scoffed at him.  "Look, I can prove it."
Draco laughed, scrunching his nose up at what Harry said, shaking his head as he reached for a sandwich.  They ate in silence for awhile before Draco broke to ask something he'd been dying to since they exchanged owls a few days before.
And he truly believed that statement.
"I think it sounds delightful."  Prue said with a smile and a wink to Draco.  "Certainly ambitious as a signature bake.  I can't wait to see what you do, Draco."
And Harry had to admit that while it was incredibly strange to see the boy who was going to become Voldemort laugh like that, it was also kind of nice.
"The paper trail for your father's release."
"Apparently it does...  Too bad it can't also see the future and would have known in advance that I'd regret my decision."
“Your flat!”  One of them said enthusiastically, stepping forward with a bright, beaming smile.  “Nice, isn't it?  Nicest one of all the people being put into protection.  Biggest one, too.”
Ron's sleepy voice came from across the room and Harry heard the shift of his blankets as the other boy moved to get up.
Harry felt realization hit him as Draco spoke,  understanding what the other boy was trying to say.  "Oh my god...  You might be right..."
A panic attack...
Draco's eyes flooded again.  Then closed as Harry spoke and choking sobs shook his body that went limp under Harry who removed his hand from Draco's mouth.
--------------------------------------------------
He broke from Harry's lips when it was impossible to breath in small breaths around his mouth, needing to gasp and draw in deeper panting breaths.  He rested forehead to forehead with the other boy, looking straight into his dark eyes as his hips lurched and everything in him pulled.  He moaned a long guttural noise, his legs squeezing around Harry, his hands pulling in his hair as his hard length throbbed and he came hard and fast, pulling from so deep it was almost painful.  It was only a moment between him and when Harry tipped and he groaned a completely different and far more primal noise as he felt Harry's length flex against him in his release just as long and hot as his own had been.  His skin felt like fire and Harry's felt like it was scorching him where they touched.
'Waste of time...' Was the nicest thing he heard muttered.
Harry nodded, staying quiet and raising his hand to Draco's cheek, brushing his fingers against the other boy's skin just once.  "I can imagine.  So if I guess correctly, you want your mom to get the first message and you tell her to go to the safe house for more?"
want to know."
He waited, not moving to touch the door, not even taking another step closer to it, hoping that he would maybe get some sort of sign.
He got up from the couch again and went to the window, looking out and around until he spotted Neville across the street, then further up was another man he recognized as an Auror with a cart of some kind that he was selling things from.
Harry didn't hesitate before jumping down to follow Draco, trying to match his almost silent footsteps on the stone floor.
"Certainly would have helped HIS cause if that had happened."  Harry said, nodding his head a bit.
"It's a promise you make to someone else.  If you break the promise, you die."
“He's not actually brave enough for that.”  Draco said, sitting down next to Harry and reaching up to loosen and then take off his tie.  “Sure it sounds brave to be a double agent but in this case it's like the best way for him to just stand in the middle and not have to oppose any side.”
Narcissa smiled as well, looking towards the fire.  "You know that no matter how okay I am with you and Harry, and I am, I still don't really want to walk up on you kissing as you were today."
"Well he goes to Death Eater meetings and Order of the Phoenix meetings.  Dumbledore swears he's a spy for their side and Voldemort thinks he's a spy for his side.  Which is it?"  Harry raised one shoulder, tilting his head a bit as he smiled at Draco, then let himself out the door and went down to the compartment he'd started off in to pretend like he gave a crap about everything they would be talking about.
“I hadn't thought about it like that.”  Harry stretched his legs out, smiling a bit and thinking for the millionth time that year just how HAPPY he was being friends with Draco.  How easy it was and how much less drama he brought compared to Ron and Hermione.  And that was saying a lot considering all the twists and turns of what was currently happening.
"How?"  Harry said, leaning forward a little more.  "I have all the letters you've been writing to me.  Did she find the ones I wrote you, you mean?"
And safe.
Once Ron and Hermione had finished arguing and they put all their books away, they returned to Gryffindor common room.  Hermione and Ron worked on homework.  Harry pretended to, but what he was really doing was writing an owl to Draco.
“It's alright.”  He muttered to Harry, because it was alright.  He just wanted to make his point and be heard.  Harry did hear him..  Maybe he wasn't giving the other man enough credit in the larger scale.
He knew he was fighting the war for the whole of the wizarding world.  But in his heart he was fighting it to free just one person.
Harry- You are maddening.  Just write up the Gringotts withdrawal and pass it to one of the Aurors.  We'll talk about internet when I see you next.
Harry chuckled softly, closing his eyes for a moment then shifting slightly.  Draco felt his hands spread against his back and he shivered, tilting his head a bit to nudge their noses together.
But he didn't.  It sat first on his desk, sealed and waiting in the silent house that was occupied only by himself and his mother.  Then he put it in a drawer.
"I had to think of something." He said, grinning at Draco.  "I figured that would actually be best."
Well.  He could dwell on Harry's unsatisfying response and reaction, or he could just ignore that part of it and think more about what he was going to do about Theodore.
“Draco!  I swear to Merlin...  Open the damn door!”
"Some secrets are good."
Neville reached into his pocket and pulled out one of the rectangular box things like what was in the window.  The screen suddenly lit up when Neville tilted it towards his face and Draco took a step closer to look at it.  “Magic?”
"They wouldn't let me sit in the living room with them to watch the news.  If I laid in the garden outside the window I could hear the tv.  I was listening to hear if anything weird had happened that might be attributed to Voldemort."
Harry stayed quiet for a few moments, then smiled a bit, reaching over to lightly touch the ends of Draco's hair.  "You make a good point."
"It's all about appearances.  You're the Chosen One, the Boy Who Lived, the hero of our world.  People will want to see you married with kids and living a fine, quaint and comfortable life."
Harry didn't seem too moved by it either and Draco was rather pleased at that.  The dark haired man sat next to him relaxed with a small and completely benign smile on his face.
"You can't help who you are."  Draco said quietly, keeping his hand where it was with the small warm touch of Harry's finger against his.
Anger
Or maybe it was a Death Eater and his worry that this whole thing had somehow been a set up to test him would actually come true.
------------------------------------
Draco stood at the door, listening until he heard Harry's steps get softer and softer as he went down the stairs, waited until he heard the door close at the bottom and then hurried across the living room to look out the window.
“Huh..”  He once again made a vague mono-syllabic noise as a response, nodding slowly as he tapped his fingers against the counter.  “He seemed so pleased in the Prophet about getting married.  All that talk about settling down, having kids brought up in a world without Voldemort..”
Harry stopped in front of the door, giving his head a shake and squaring his shoulders.
"Good though..."
He hadn't seen a soul in that park when he was with Harry but... He must have missed something.
"And you couldn't have told us about it?"  Ron asked, frowning deeper.
"Nothing..?"  Harry asked, frowning as he scratched the back of his head.  "Why?"
"Harry it...." Draco swallowed hard, clenching his fists and holding them tight against his stomach.  "Harry it never went away.  It wasn't just some stressed out misplaced feelings.  I'd had them for years and.. they never went away."
They were saying their hugging goodbyes to the person leaving, congratulating each other if they were staying for another week, and receiving the proper praises or suggestions and guidance from the judges.
"You're still going?"  Draco asked,  turning towards Harry a bit.  "I suppose you have to if we're committing to try and act like everything is as normal as possible."
And once again he felt hope rise, and then it was dashed back down to the ground again.
As much as Harry didn't want to admit it, he knew Draco was right.  He'd been staunchly ignoring the fact that there seemed to be no end to what came next for himself as the Boy Who Lived.  It was still early days after the war, people and the wizarding world as a whole were still sorting themselves out.  But he could see the roads and paths that lay ahead of him.  And he knew Draco was dead on when he said it wouldn't ever be done.
He watched Draco walk towards Astoria who tucked her hand firmly into his arm and sent a truly nasty look towards Harry before she managed to turn both herself and Draco away from him.
The noise was a voice.  A gentle voice.  One that he automatically tried to obey and slow his desperate gasps to fill his lungs.
Harry immediately and swiftly bent over in silent hysterics, shaking his head, and plunging his hands into his hair, gripping it tightly as he laughed so hard he couldn't breathe, not daring to let it make a sound.  Hearing Draco gasping in almost but not quite silent laughter next to him didn't help.
“And you think he doesn't deserve to be punished for his father's actions?  His mother's weakness?”
They where THERE.  The three of them were IN Malfoy Manor.  And if they were there, they weren't safe.  They were going to be turned over to Voldemort, they would be killed and then Draco didn't know if his own life ended or begun when the final blows were made.
"It won't ever be done."  Draco said with a note of resignation in his voice.  "You're never going to be done, Harry."
But, he had to admit, that wasn't surprising.  Harry, for all his good qualities, (and even Draco had to admit that he had a lot of those) tended towards tunnel vision.  His focus wasn't on anything other that Draco getting Theodore to agree to come under Ministry care.  Everything that happened around that was superfluous.
“I only have the most basic and rudimentary grasp on what a computer is.”  Draco said, looking over at Harry as they both seemed to relax a little more, and talk without pretense.  “I'm not altogether sure I would even know what to buy.  I figured out just enough to understand that I can't walk into that electronics store and say 'one computer, please'.”
The woods were silent again except for the sound of their breathing, fast and hard to start with, but slowing as minutes trickled by.
