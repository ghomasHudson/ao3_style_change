This drastic change in Sirius’ behavior was the reason he was so quick to believe Dumbledore when he told Remus that he had presided over the trial. That Sirius had confessed. And Remus was too lost in the world, Lily and James gone, his cub hidden away from him and his mate supposedly having killed them all, along with their fourth musketeer.
A young Sirius replied, voice much higher than it was now, cracking towards the middle of the sentence. Harry looked over at his Godfather who was blushing. The door to the room opened, a woman with familiar grey eyes and elegant features strolling into the room.
It was true that Godric's own knowledge over the last 104 years was spotty, but everything before then he knew well. The time he spent away from Hogwarts, Godric used to learn everything he could. He knew that when Sal finally woke up, he would want to know everything. And it would take someone who had seen all the advancement since Salazar went to sleep to know what to tell him. After all, it would be easy for someone to overlook life-altering progress just because they had lived with it forever. Something as simple as the Floo Network would blow his mates mind but to someone who grew up in this time would never think to mention it.
Bartok warned Harry last night that they would be getting up early to go to the bank so that they could retrieve Harry’s Lord and Heir rings. But when Bartok walked into his son’s room he was still fast asleep, Neville curled around him protectively.
David went back to the original question when he saw Harry’s mood start to drop. “As for the wand itself it is said to be the strongest wand ever made, and considering some of what the Peverell family achieved, I am inclined to believe that myth. No one knows what it is made from other than elder wood, it has been a puzzle wandmaker have tried to solve over the years. But because of this, the wand has had a bloody history. The last known Peverell to wield it was Antioch himself, rumor says he was killed for the wand. Myths also say that the wand gives its loyalty to those who conquer their last owner, but it is also said that as a Peverell artifact it is only loyal to the bloodline of those who created it. And considering the earlier spectacle, we can now assume this is also true.”
Remus seemed to gather himself, straightening up in a way Sirius recognized as his Professor pose. “Harry, two men can have sex, so can two women.”
Ron seemed to perk back up at the word Quidditch and was soon going on about how they had box seats and were planning on camping out for the night. Harry just continued to stare the old man in front of him down, ignoring the vacuous redhead as he bounced in place. “As you were just told by
“Mr. Potter will remain in your custody for now while I take the time to thoroughly investigate this situation. However, come September, I expect to see him return to Hogwarts for his fourth year. Now, I am afraid I must go, I have another appointment to keep.” Fudged thanked them all for their time, thoughts far away with his ponderings as he and his escorts left through the floo, the file still in hand.
“I have only heard mentions that you knew him so I might be wrong about your relationship but the Goblins audited the Potter accounts, and they are sure the artifacts and money were stolen by Albus Dumbledore.” Bartok had on his gentle tone of voice, the one he used when talking to victims for a case.
Issy gasped in surprise, dainty hand going up to cover her mouth. “Bartok, this is your childhood home, you have always held it so dear.”
Next, to Albus Dumbledore, I once again request you leave my family alone. Now that I have passed there is no use asking for Lily to give you access to our vaults or the Potter Wizengamot seats. We have withdrawn from the war.
Arthur was the first to gather his thoughts, only able to whisper out a broken, “What?” He was absolutely devastated. His children were his life. And it wasn’t that Arthur wouldn’t love any of his children if they weren’t his, the reason it hurt so much was both the way he found out and that Ginny seemed to not consider him to be her parent at all, even though he had done all he could to raise her.
His hair stood on end, bursting into white-hot flames, all the Headmaster’s portraits waking in shock. Godric quickly calmed himself, he needed to head off the portraits which would try to inform Dumbledore of his presence.
Anna greeted them all tightly, her usually soft demeanor turning sharp like the edge of a new blade.
After a few tense seconds, he finally removed his wand from between Molly’s shocked eyes. “Sorry, my dear, I was lost in thought and you surprised me.”
Harry was walking around in a haze, Madam Longbottom had retrieved Neville soon after they came back inside, stating they had family business they needed to handle, but that they would be back before bedtime. Harry was still shocked that Neville considered him close enough to be a brother, for some reason that didn’t feel quite right but he was too stupidly happy to worry about it.
Harry chewed lightly on the inside of his cheek, going through the pros and cons. “You will be there, with me, right?”
The Minister coughed to clear his throat before he spoke again, “Yes, your sudden removal from your family was quite unexpected. All the documents surrounding the circumstances are sealed, so naturally, I am concerned for your wellbeing. I was also shocked to hear that you had come into a creature inheritance.” Fudge fought to hide the slight downward tilt of his mouth at the word creature, but he was unsuccessful. “The only creature blood that the Potter’s carried hasn’t been seen for centuries.” The Minister fidgeted, looking over at Dumbledore for advice.
Bartok didn’t have to say it out loud, but all his mates knew that as soon as the newspapers got ahold of the information about the arrests and the lawsuits Bartok would be starting, the Ministry would come down hard on them. They had no illusion that Fudge and Dumbledore wouldn’t try to bring down their full weight down on them. They didn’t have an old family name to help shelter what was to come, and even if they did, Bartok doubted that would stop Dumbledore.
“Harry, first of all, to alleviate your fears of rejection, you should know that Neville likes men too,” Remus informed his cub, it hadn’t been explicitly stated but by the way Neville acted around Harry, and the fact Augusta specifically mentioned  informing Neville about the mechanics of gay sex, let him know that this was at least true. He wasn’t sure how the other boy felt about girls but he very much doubted Harry had anything to worry about in this area.
It was the twins to speak up before anyone else could. “They aren’t our family,” they hissed out in unison.
Remus gasped loudly, eyes almost so wide they looked like they would pop out at any second. “Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin, as I live and breathe,” Remus' voice was almost more breathy than when he was about to cum and Sirius was shocked by that fact alone, he would have to work harder. And then the words hit Sirius and he was up, family heirloom wand at the ready, sparks already falling from it and a curse on his tongue.
As Harry turned, a strange poster caught his sight, it was much smaller than the others, but the reason it caught his attention was that it was the only one not moving. When Harry realized what it was be began laughing, full belly laughs that shook his frame. On the wall of his Father’s bedroom wall was a poster for the Disney movie Bambi.
Inside was the Longbottom crest in platinum, an Oak tree, and sword, with a bright amber droplet hanging from the bottom. If Neville wasn’t so terrified he would laugh at the sight of the oak. His Grandmother had drilled its meaning into him since he was a small boy. Oak; Duir the Celtic word for oak and the origins of the word Druid. Oak; durability, constancy, purity. Oak; a tendency to attract lightning.
The impromptu cheese lesson ended then, Harry devoting all of his attention to his faithful friend. Her feathers were clean, and her beak was glossy, she hadn’t looked this good since before they left Hogwarts and Harry glad to see she was being taken care of when he couldn’t. Hedwig started talking to Harry, expecting him to understand but he couldn’t and that clearly frustrated her.
He was careful as he shrunk the portrait and placed it into his pocket, making his way back to the entrance, He grabbed onto Harry’s hand, rubbing soothing circles into the soft skin as they left the vault, large doors closing behind them as they got into the cart.
Another thing I want to say thank you for everyone who donated to help me with my medical bills. It has helped a lot! And this chapter is dedicated to you. Seriously the donations have helped me be less stressed, which beyond not being good for my heart, has just caused me to have a lot of panic attacks.
“It’s scrapbooking supplies! I thought I could help you start your first one!” Issy cheered, opening a white leather-bound book. It was full of blank pages, but the front page was embossed in gold was Harry’s name. But more than that, it said ‘Hadrian James Potter Claremore’. And those nine little golden letters tacked on to the end of his name was earth-shattering. It had only been a few days since his adoption, and it was still hard for Harry to accept that the Claremores wanted him. And this little thing, that Issy didn’t even realize meant so much to him, proved once more that he was wanted.
“Is there anything you would like to ask us?” Remus questioned as he rubbed at his left calf that was cramping.
Harry hid his face once again, taking his time to think it over. It was never something Harry considered, after all, why would he? He was unlovable. But here his Godfathers were telling him they love him, and no matter his answer it wouldn’t matter to them. His new parents had often told him how much they loved and cared for him. But it was still hard to believe.
Harry forced himself out of bed, shuffling on unsteady feet to his walk-in closet, shutting the door to get dressed in privacy. As he changed, Harry looked over his body in the floor length mirror, inspecting every inch as it was revealed. His flat stomach, sparse black hair running from his belly button to below his pant line. His small flat dusky nipples and the defined line of his collarbone, his Adam’s apple that protruded from his slender neck.
After all these years, and now that he knew the betrayal they had committed on him, his anger finally bubbled up. “No,” Harry whispered, looking down at his bear before he finally looked up, glaring at Ron. “I don’t want to go with you. I want to stay here with my family, I am happy, and I have everything I could ever want.” Harry stated, making his position clear.
Everyone was down in the sunroom, waiting for the two boys to start breakfast. Tiptop was at the head of the table with Augusta at the other end, both women delicately sipping their cups of tea. Harry took the seat between Issy and David, the only seat for Neville to take was between Bartok and Remus.
Harry turned in Issy’s arms, needing the comfort they offered. Bartok held a small black velvet box with his large hands. Holding it as if it was something precious and it was all Harry could do but to shakily reach out. The box was a little bigger than one of his hands, and it took him a few seconds to open it, fingers running over the soft fabric. Inside was a delicate gold bracelet, attached to the links were small charms that looked like crests. In fact, he noticed that one of the charms was the Ravenclaw crest, a bright sapphire dangling from the bottom.
While Harry loved Lyle, he wished his Daddy wouldn’t have brought it up. He didn’t want to look any weaker than he had to in front of this stranger. But Harry also knew the only reason Lyle had brought it up was that he trusted his little brother with the information, and Harry couldn’t blame him for that. Siles seemed nice, but Harry had only spent less than half an hour in the man’s presence and couldn’t put the same trust in him that Lyle did. What if Siles used this information against him.
He blinked rapidly, vision having whited out, and unclenched his jaw where he had accidentally bite down around his digits, teeth marks dark on sensitive skin. His grip was still tight around his now softening prick, fingers covered in spunk. Neville looked down at himself, abdominal muscles trembling and thighs starting to quiver.
His mother, Cedrella, had never had cause to use it and instead gifted one each to Arthur and his late sister Guinevere.
He was torn, they were all his children, and he only wanted what was best for them. But he also could not abide Ginny and Ron stealing from anyone, especially not their family. Arthur got up and went to his bedroom, not noticing his twins peeking around their door to watch his determined face.
Remus was the one to take him through the floo, followed by Neville and Augusta. Once his parents were all through, they moved to the informal sitting room.
They spent hours crying, laughing, and mourning their losses. Sirius telling them about how wonderful Harry was, how much Sirius loved him and wished he could have been there to see him grow up. Promises that he would never leave Harry alone again, that he would be there when James and Lily couldn’t.
David understood completely and was quick to agree, going over what they would most likely ask of him. All they needed at this point was willingly given infected werewolf blood to test their theory on. Theoretically, it should work, they just wanted to do all the double checking they could do before they risked people's lives. Remus and Sirius accepted the Claremore's invitation to move into the manor, both because they wanted to be closer to their cub and because Dumbledore’s actions had scared them.
“He is fine, cub-” Remus was cut off by a silvery wolf Patronus bursting through the wall. It rubbed up against Remus before speaking.
So instead he had focused his need into creating a rose, face flushing at the implication of the flower’s colors as he placed it behind Harry’s ear. Neville pulled back, reaching to take Harry’s hand within his as he did, the metal of Harry’s clan bracelet cool against his fingertips. Neville reached into his pocket, pulling out the small black velvet box he and his Gran retrieved yesterday.
Bartok took Harry back through the floo to the manor, handing over the shrunken portrait, Neville sitting on the couch in the receiving room with a book in his lap, waiting for their return. Harry rushed right over to his mate, and Bartok couldn’t help the sappy grin on his face. To see someone who cared for his little boy would always make him happy. Harry deserved so much better than what his life had been that anything that brought him happiness also brought Bartok happiness.
Anna instructed him on how to call upon Lady Magic, Harry following her words and filling in the blanks. “I, Hadrian James Potter, do call upon Lady Magic to judge the illegal marriage contract made by Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore and Molly Muriel Weasley.”
Now that she had Albus backed into a corner, Anna took this chance to calm herself, to seem like the more mature one in the situation. To pounce on the moment of weakness he was showing. “Mr. Dumbledore, if you did not have the time to take care of a child directly under your care maybe you should have considered either not making yourself his Magical Guardian or dropping one or two of your positions. If you missed something so big pertaining to a child you were tasked with protecting, how many other abused children at Hogwarts have gone undiscovered?”
Anna stayed behind to inform Healer Charlotte of the move while the two Longbottoms solemnly made their way down the well-known hallways. The picture Neville had drawn of his parents with their names below the stick figure renderings of them from when he was six was still on the door to their room. A small stick figure Neville between them with Augusta looming behind them all.
Dumbledore’s voice was weak, obviously pulling out the last argument he had, the whole reason the Weasleys were even here. “I may have failed-” All the Claremores scoffed, even the Minister joined in, making Dumbledore flush in anger. “However, you are taking Mr. Potter away from a loving family who would gladly welcome him into their home. He barely knows you all, wouldn’t it be best for him to be with people who already care for him?”
Godric sat down onto the bed, hands running over the familiar fabric. He ran a finger over a supple cheek, skin still as smooth as ever.
Issy giggled and blew kisses at all of them from her perch. “Don’t worry Harry, we’ll be back before you know it!”
Godric put an arm around the other man, pulling Sal into his side for a quick hug. “Well, my love, first we have to visit a pair of wonderful ladies and then we have some sneaking to do.”
Arthur knew how Molly felt about her brothers, so when he recognized the signs of Fred and George being magical twins when they were only a day old, Arthur had sworn to protect them. So when Molly started looking at them strangely he was quick to distract her.
Neville coughed a few times, clearing his throat but his voice still came out shakily and much higher than normal. “Are you okay? I-I heard you scream?” Neville sounded so unsure but he obviously wouldn’t leave until he knew Harry was alright.
Helga and Rowena, both understanding, sent him up to the sleeping chamber. The old man was so presumptuous in his superiority that he didn’t even have an alarm ward on his chambers to alert him to intruders. The old man was lying on his side, in bright purple pajamas, and Godric wished he could just kill him now. But he knew the truth, and it would be no use to do that and make the man a martyr, for now, he would live. The wand that rightfully belonged to his mate was lying on the nightstand. When Godric gripped it, it buzzed unhappily before realizing his intentions.
Sirius finally pulled back after a few minutes, seeming to blink away the memories he had been lost in. “Pup, you look so adorable!” He said, and Harry could almost imagine a black tail wagging behind him. Harry felt his own thumping against the floor while a smile spread across his face. “I’ve missed you so much.”
And like that his anger deflated like a burst balloon, while he might have once thought it was worth it, now that he knew that Harry needed to be protected, his Draken side was screaming for it. Severus pulled back all his Draken features with blinding pain and turned away, head bowed as he took the key from Helix and left the room, planning to go down to the vault to read the letters now. The further he got from Harry the more his now unbound creature side screamed for him to run back. To protect.
The entrance room was just as pretty as the rest of the clinic Neville had seen, a nurse waiting on their arrival to direct them to the head healer's office. It was welcoming with many pictures of family covering the walls. Artwork children had drawn her in a place of pride right behind her, along with her mastery certificates.
"Why are you willing to do all of this to help find a cure, my son and daughter-in-law are the only ones I have ever heard of who have such a condition." Augusta probed, she was weary why this woman was so helpful, not that she wasn't grateful.
Because of this, when his sons first started going through puberty, he had made sure to take them aside and reassure them that he would love them no matter what.
Bartok’s eyes narrowed ever so slightly, he could see what the two men were trying to pull, and he would never allow it. He also knew that Lily and James Potter paid for Harry’s education in full after his first bout of accidental magic. “I appreciate your concern for the wellbeing of my son, Minister. However, I am a perfectly capable guardian for my son. He is loved very much by my whole family and is very happy.” Bartok checked his watch for show. “Now if you would please excuse me, I am late for dinner with my family.” As Bartok turned to leave, he noticed how Dumbledore clenched his fists at his side.
But they didn’t, they just held Harry tighter and reassured him over and over that they accepted him, that the Claremores would accept him. And that was when it hit him,
Lastly, there was a book titled, “So you’re going to have a Harem? A sub’s guide to growing up”, which was obviously the gift from Luna. They had become friends in Harry’s second year, the twins would often be found in the library with her. They went close since Harry didn’t get the chance to talk to her often since they were in different years and different houses, and Ron and Hermione often pulled him away when Harry tried to hang out with them. Not to mention the chaos the yearly
Issy chipped in to break the mood that had started setting in, “We all took the day off to celebrate your birthday. We have a lovely dinner planned, and Tiptop wants to know what your favorite kind of cake is. Also, I hope you really like your presents!”
“How long has it been?” Salazar whispers, trying not to break the contentment but needing to know the answer.
Bartok didn’t even hesitate. “Madam Longbottom, we would like to invite you to stay in our home for the week so that our families may get to know each other while the boys spend time together.”
"How will you improve their state of living?" Augusta inquired, obviously worried what the staff was thinking of doing.
But as Harry lead Remus by the hand to introduce the adults to each other Remus caught their scents. They were all non-humans and Remus couldn’t help but relax. Especially at the scent of a Werewolf. Remus knew that born Werewolves were very protective of those they considered pack and that this man would never allow Harry to be hurt.
Harry schooled his face into blankness, not wanting to give them any ammo to use against his parents. “Minister, it’s very kind of you to check up on how I am doing with my new family.” Harry fought not to fidget under the man’s gaze. He might not look intimidating, but there was something about the way he studied Harry that made his skin crawl.
They stood there for a few more moments before Neville spoke up once more, “I, uh, will leave it to you?” His voice rising at the end, but he clearly wasn’t asking for an answer. He began to shuffle out, eyes staying locked onto the ceiling as he bumped into the door frame on his way out before shutting the door softly. Harry turned around after a few seconds to make sure Neville wouldn’t come back in. The toilet hadn’t moved from its place and the warm seat was calling to him.
Bartok spoke up, composure already regained. “All I ask of you is to continue on this path. To protect our child with everything you have and are. And to treat him as the treasure he is, that is all we could ever want.”
Bartok knew that the plan for Harry involved line theft and theft of money and property but the thought of those people planning to kill his son was just too much. His wings burst from his back, arching high up into the air and instincts screaming to go kill those people and then to go and protect his son. The only thing that stopped him from killing the men across from him was how disgusted, furious and ashamed they looked when Bill was speaking of their ex-families plans.
But before he could curse the intruders he was falling to the floor, body stiff as a board and arms locked at his sides. Remus jerked out of his shock, jumping to stand over his mate, wand at the ready. Salazar jumped in front of Godric, hands raised placatingly, voice gentle as he tried to calm the situation. “I think we all need to take a deep breath and take a step back, we know this is probably very shocking to you, but I assure you Godric has a good reason for stunning Mr. Black.”
They lay there curled together limbs tangled and laughter slowly dying out. Their foreheads pressed together, sharing in each other’s breaths.
“Oh, yes, I forgot they don’t teach the magical classifications in Britain. There are three categories magic falls into, White, Grey, and Black. White magic is magic that can only be used to help others, in contrast, Black magic can only be used for harm, while Grey is everything in between. The Patronus charm, as an example, is White magic while the ritual to create Inferi is Black magic.”
Harry pulled his teddy closer to his chest, using it for comfort. The man took a step forward, eyes still locked on Harry, and then Harry noticed the familiar features. Mainly the tilt of his eyes, nose, and the way his ears stuck out slightly. However, he was much taller than his brother, Lyle had told Harry he had twenty-four siblings, so he didn’t know which one this was.
“We will begin with the Will of James Fleamont Potter, the Wills will read themselves and we ask you to remain quiet through the proceedings.” Helix picked up a scroll and broke the seal, and from the paper, words started echoing around the dead silent room. Harry’s breath hitched, throat tightening and eyes beginning to water.
The second one is to swear on your magic, never do this lightly because if you break your Oath, The Lady will take your magic in payment. And while we can live without our magic you will always feel the void where it once was. There are cases of people being driven mad by the loss.
Neville had a hand wrapped around one of Harry’s thin ankles, grip just short of bruising but Harry didn’t complain, it felt grounding. That was when Neville leaned forward, hands coming together as if he was cupping water within them. Harry watched closely, curious as to what his friend was doing. He watched in awe as calming green magic pooled into Neville’s hands, slowly taking shape and forming into a single rose.
They entered the dining room four other people sitting around the table. Harry was overwhelmed, trying to take in all his parent’s features.
Anna broke into the conversation, done allowing these men to speak to her son. “The records of all emergency adoptions are sealed, and the child’s name is left out. I am surprised you were able to find out as it could be considered a breach of privacy.” Anna commented casually, watching the way the Minister paled and Dumbledore’s wrinkled face went stony.
Tiptop suddenly looked at the bed, brows furrowed, causing everyone else to look over. A vortex of flames appeared over the bed, but none of them worried about it, they had already seen it enough to know it was the Phoenix.
Ginny scoffed, not noticing the danger she was in, Percy however did and was quick to take his younger Brother’s wands. “Mother and Father made a marriage contract for us.”
“What… Can I?” Harry asked, unable to finish his question but needing to know. One of his most secret of dreams was to have a large family. So even though he was terrified at the thought of bearing children, it also as delighted him, though he was nowhere near ready for children. Harry didn’t think he could take care of himself, let alone a helpless child.
“Albus!” Dedalus shouted voice quivering and lower lip wobbling. Dumbledore wanted to shoot a stinging hex at the man and tell him to grow up, but before he could, the other man spoke up again. “Albus… We lost the proxy for the Black, Lupin, Peverall and Potter seats. That is what I was trying to tell you. I flooed your office in Hogwarts, but there was no answer.”
They had decided that since Harry’s core was so large he should have the master suites since he would undoubtedly have more mates than Issy’s four. The Garden Hill home had been built for a bonding circle that had fifteen members so the master suites were very large. They all knew that someday Harry would move out, it was just part of Kitsune’s nature to nest and isolate their clan. But they hoped that giving him the biggest set of rooms would allow their son to stay with them as long as possible. To be honest they weren’t too keen on the thought of their little boy bonding but they would rather Harry’s mates live in their manor than lose their son so soon.
“Okay, cub, if you have any questions while we are in the memory just ask us, we can pause it while we talk. Now, all we have to do is place a finger in the liquid. Entering the memory might be a bit disorienting, but you will be completely safe. Just remember it’s only a memory, and I and Sirius will be the only ones who can reply to you.” Remus wished he didn’t have to say the last bit but he suspected that if he didn’t the realization once in the memory would hurt Harry.
“I need to make sure the old fucker doesn’t wake while I do what needs to be done.” Godric defended. He knew that once he and Sal messed with the wards, the old man would feel it, and he didn’t dare risk that. Godric had just gained his freedom, and the thought of being enslaved again when both Harry and Sal needed him was unacceptable. He was the only one who knew where Salazar was, and he was also the only one who could wake him.
As Tiptop took away the leftovers, she placed a package on the table in front of Harry. Unlike all the other presents it didn’t have fancy paper, just a dull brown. “Happy birthday young Master Harry,” She squeaked and popped away.
The other man hid his face in long wild red hair, "Never to be parted again… Did you… Did you find them? Salazar hesitantly asked it had always been a sore subject between them. They both knew there would eventually come a time when there would have to be someone else. It was just in Godric’s nature. Phoenix’s had one true mate. That in no way meant they couldn’t find love outside of that, that they couldn’t marry and bond with others. But they would only return to their human form with the meeting of that one person.
Neville touched the picture wistfully as he walked into the room, still wishing for the drawing to be a reality.
Sirius and Remus just held hands, trying to give their Godson the smallest modicum of privacy, only speaking when Harry asked a question. Harry asked about the scar on his Father’s chin, the result of late night broom ride that Dorea refused to heal completely as punishment. He asked about the missing little finger on Dorea’s right hand, a result of battling Grindelwald.
He was in his Hogwarts robes, top two buttons undone and tie hanging loosely around his neck. His grin reminded Harry strongly of Fred and George, that same mischievous streak they had. His glasses were just as bulky as Harry’s old ones had been but somehow on his much more masculine face, they seemed right at home.
“Sorry, Dad, I was just… Inspecting my tail,” Harry reluctantly let go of his tail and got dressed. As soon as he was finished, soft fabric hugging him and sweater covering most of his hands, Harry gathered the new appendage to his chest, cheek pressed into the tip. “I’m done now.”
Severus pulled curiously at his nipples, a groan racking its way through his body. They had always been sensitive, but now they throbbed at just the simple pull, a gentle scrape of his manicured nails causing precum to leak from the tip of his cock.
Augusta relaxed back into her chair. As a Black, people doing something out of the kindness of their heart without any gain always confused her. Even Augusta doing things to help Harry benefited her.
He had to sit and watch as the old goat fucker planned his mate’s death and there was nothing he could do to stop it; the slavery spells too strong for him to overcome in this form. But he had spent all that time carefully listening and learning. Dumbledore was so self-assured in his superiority and spell work that he found no problem in divulging all his past deeds and future plans to the Phoenix. At times he thought the old man forgot that he was a being and could at anytime regain a human form.
Even as the light died down they stayed within each other’s arms, unwilling to let go, unwilling to lose this feeling of absolute safety, nothing mattering besides their heartbeats. Harry didn’t know what was happening but that didn’t matter, this was all he needed.
Most of them were easily treated with potions, but the malnutrition would take time and care. The worst, however, was the many bindings, they were in fact very old though the time away from Dumbledore had weakened them. In their current state, Lyle, while not a healer, was able to remove them as a licensed curse breaker.
Remus almost whined at the sight, couldn’t stand that his cub thought he would be upset with Harry being happy. Sure he wished it was him and Sirius who could have adopted their cub but he also knew there was no way they could. All they could do was be there for Harry and do their best to keep him safe. And if these strangers were where Harry was safest, Remus would never try to separate them.
“I am sorry Mr. Longbottom that you had to find out this way. We talked about it on the night you first arrived,” Bartok spoke up, voice even, trying to calm down the rage growing within Neville.
I appoint my spouse to be Guardian of Hadrian James Potter until he comes of age at eighteen. If my spouse predeceases me, then I appoint Sirius Orion Black of London, England as Guardian of Hadrian Jame Potter until he comes of age at eighteen. If Sirius Orion Black of London, England, is unable to take Guardianship, I appoint Alice Helen Longbottom nee Smith of Cornwall, England as Guardianship of Hadrian James Potter until he comes of age at eighteen.
Once they were done, Minerva started leading Severus back to the main gates, peaking around every corner for threats. He couldn’t imagine Minerva’s animagus form being anything other than a lioness at that moment as she stalked the hallways with an unnatural grace.
“It is something we will have to bring up with Arthur the next time one of us sees him. However, since this declaration from Lady Magic will be made public within the week, probably the way of an emergency newsletter, Arthur will probably know soon. All contracts formed by Lady Magic are recorded in a special section of the Ministry, it is then delivered to the major newspapers. The Lady is the reason we have magic, any time she contacts us in any way, it is big news.” Remus said, mind far away.
It was soon over, song trailing off into nothing and glow sinking back into the two on the beds form. But where there had once been a magnificent but ragged Phoenix there was now a very naked man, forehead still pressed to Harry’s.
He jumped to his feet, rounding on the chair that Albus was stuck and silenced to after he had tried to interrupt the proceedings. For the first time in years, he felt his wings burst through his skin and his glamour fall. Red and black leathery wings arched far above his head.
In his momentary terror, he had forgotten that. It was Rowena’s idea to have the collective wisdom of all the past Headmasters in one room to guide those to come. Godric looked over to the empty frame which once held two of his most beloved friends. It had been over a hundred years since they last occupied it, their hearts too broken to see what Dumbledore was doing to their school. They felt helpless since they could do nothing to stop him. He thanked Hadrianus the Headmaster to follow Helga and walked over to their painting, placing a hand against the painted scene of a library filled with greenery.
Harry launched his face into the older man’s neck, breathing in the scent of wet fur, motor oil, and smokey wood. “I missed you too, Siri,” Harry whispered low enough for only the two of them to hear. It wasn’t until Neville and Madam Longbottom returned that they pulled apart. Sirius lifted Harry like a teddy bear and carried him to one of the armchairs, holding on as if his Godson might disappear if he let go.
“Happy Birthday, Harry” David whispered, voice still sleep rough, but the undertone of happiness was louder than anything and Harry couldn’t help the tears.
He smiled, face almost split in two as he pressed his forehead against her smooth stone walls. “Oh, my darling, how I have wished to comfort you.” There had been many times when the school was under attack was Godric had to continue fighting with her screams echoing against his heart. It wasn’t until Dumbledore placed him under a slavery spell that he was forced to sit idly by as the students were and danger and his daughter cried in fear.
Harry thought this over. He couldn’t remember anything outside of the thought of the wand and looking back, Harry could see how his actions could have worried his parents. And it touched him that Issy was willing to harm someone else for his sake even if he would never want that. “I understand, Papa, and I’m sorry for worrying everyone.”
And while he would love to think her attention was captured by the sight of him at seven, dirty and working in the garden. But he knew it was just wishful thinking, even before the addition of such memories she had always spent her every waking moment looking out the window.
Neville ate in silence while the Claremores talked, his Grandmother, Professor Lupin and Lord Black missing, still staring out into the garden. Harry kept sneaking glances between questions from his parents. When Harry asked where the others were Issy and Anna informed him that Remus and Sirius were both sleeping in late and that Madam Longbottom was out taking care of family business.
When he woke in the same bed as Harry, his mate laying feet from him, dark lashes fanning across tanned cheeks. Neville wanted nothing more than to move closer, wrap himself around Harry and protect him for anything that might come. But he couldn’t, at least not for now. Last night had made it obvious that Harry was much more innocent than he had expected.
And while he allowed Harry to think he had calmed, his Gran knew him better and looked over at him with a sly nod, letting him know they would talk about it once they were alone. Neville was raised at the knee of a Black, and even when he was younger and less confident, he never forgot his Gran’s lessons. The summer after his first year when Neville told her of what happened to Harry, she had taken him into the library and started their courses on traditional Black skills. Blackmailing, threats, revenge, and untraceable killing methods. Information gathering, knife throwing, and the beginnings of dark magic.
He packed away his last piece of equipment, a giant crystal cauldron Dumbledore had recently delivered to his chambers. Severus had drooled in his mind world over it, but he also knew that this type of cauldron was only used for two things with how rare they were, White magic or Black Magic. And Severus highly doubted the old fucker would use it for good.
“Rest, Harry, we are all here,” Bartok whispered from his spot a few bodies over. Harry relaxed back into the warmth his parents provided and was soon sound asleep once again.
“Well, Harry, there are still many things we cannot heal, and most who are suffering prefer the quick death of the curse instead of living through their illness or the stress of another method of euthanasia. It is not something people like to think about, but in situations where that is an option, it is more compassionate to allow people to go on their own terms.” Anna continued.
"We have you set up in the rooms across from Harry's so that if anything happens you are close at hand. Though I would like to see anyone try to bypass Tiptop, she has set up a plethora of elven wards down the hallway leading to Harry's room, we will have to tell her to allow you access." Bartok looked amused as he guided Percival through the house, the portraits greeting them as they passed.
Severus took in a heaving breath, reaching up to caress the line of his collar bone fingers resting momentarily in the hollow of his throat, counting the beats of his racing heart before trailing down his chest, nails scratching against lightly hairy skin, something he hadn't had the last time he had full control of his body.
David’s eyes went wide, and before Harry knew it, he was being pulled down atop his dad. He couldn’t help but giggle and hide his face in the older man’s neck. “Dad!” Harry squeaked as David’s stubble rough face nuzzled against Harry’s forehead.
And when Harry got into bed as if nothing was happening Neville had been forced to lay in the bed, stiff as a board until Harry finally drifted off. His cock aching and begging to be touched. He jumped from the bed, and ran to the bathroom, stripping his pajama top from his oversensitized skin as he did.
He had a newfound respect for the Weasley patriarch for holding himself together as well as he was. Bartok wasn’t sure he would be able to handle it with as much grace.
Harry gently opened the box, not noticing Issy and Lyle bouncing on either side of him in excitement. Sitting inside was what looked like an iPhone, something Harry was familiar with from Dudley’s yearly phone updates.
returns.” Severus had rarely heard Minerva use her native language of Scottish Gaelic, and he was sure whatever she had just said wasn’t a compliment by the venom in her tone.
After Bartok floo called Percival to ask him to play bodyguard once more, they all spent the rest of the night beginning the process of moving.
He keenly missed the feeling of her arms around his waist, ample bosom pressed against his abs and smiling face looking up at him with sparkling eyes. Helga wiped the tear threatening to roll down her rosy cheek away, rushing out of the painting with a quick, “I’ll be back,” thrown over her shoulder.
But then that wish broke, his Father as he always was sitting in his bed, eyes glazed and drool dripping from his mouth. His hair long lost it fullness and luster. Now just clumps of brown straw hanging limply over his forehead. His skin gray and paper thin, face gaunt, and muscles so weak Neville doubted that he could stand if he tried. As the years past it was clear that Frank had taken the brunt of the spell damage, his state much worse. His mother stood staring off into the fake window, which Augusta and charmed to change through his Mother’s favorite scenes. His Grandmother had even charmed it to show different memories of Neville.
They finished their breakfast in silence, all thinking over what they had learned this morning and then went about their days.
Like Anna said, it was a hard thing to think about, and his knee-jerk reaction was to disagree, but he took the time to think it over. While he still found the thought distasteful, he also understood why some people would choose to go down such a route.
The moment Remus walked through those doors the smell of his cub hit him like a brick wall, his contentment obvious, and he was soon lifting the boy in his arms and snuffling into his neck. It took him a full minute of holding his cub close to his chest, wolf rumbling in contentment once more, to notice what the strange undertone he had smelt was. It was the musk of a fox, and when Remus pulled back he saw the perked up white ears tipped in gold and the tail wagging out of control behind him.
“As a licensed pediatric healer, I dealt with the abuse myself. It was the most severe case I have ever personally handled, and Harry will need to be in treatment for the next few years.” Anna placed a folder onto the table in front of the Minister. “These are the verified medical scans I performed.”
Harry serenely smiled down at the wand within his hand, not noticing all of his parents’ worried questions or Anna and Lyle shooting diagnostic spells at him. All he cared about was the warm weight in his grasp, the wand humming with magic, almost as mesmerizing as the unknown Phoenix’s song. Harry watched as the wand twisted its way around his wrist like a snake and then melted into his skin until all that was left a thin, perfectly straight black line on the inside of his wrist.
The only subject Godric didn't hold the man back in was Potions, the man would have hexed him and fled the house if he had tried. So Godric had gone to more than one bookstore and had basically bought out their Potion's sections.
After the man left, Dumbledore made his way back to his office, hoping to try to use the floo to get back into the school, and if not he could try and get Minerva to open the wards for him. But the nervous form of Dedalus Diggle was hunched in front of his door, wringing his hands violently. Dumbledore motioned the man in, summoning a House-Elf to get them tea. Dedalus took in on shaky sip before speaking.
The only reason he even recognized the other boy was those warm brown eyes and his ears that still suck out, though he seemed to have grown into them. Harry couldn’t help himself as he ran towards his friend, jumping up into his arms and wrapping around him like a koala.
It took a few moments as Godric guided Salazar’s magic until the bond was formed. Godric’s bond developed over many years, slowly wiggling its way into his core but it settled. With Salazar, the bonding was a sharp shock of magic, causing him to jump and gasp in fright. But the smile soon grew, expression full of peace as a tear rolled down Salazar’s cheek. “Oh Godric, she, she is beautiful.” He, of course, was talking about the feel of her magic, no matter how much taint Dumbledore stained her with or how weak she was, they could both still feel her.
“Oh…” Fudge said, face falling. Bartok had obviously thrown off his planned speech, but like the politician he was, the Minister quickly rallied. “Well, as he is an important British citizen, I am, of course, worried about his safety and would like to know your intentions. He is a young boy, and we can’t have people taking advantage of him!”
He looked down at his pocket watch, a present from his grandfather for passing his lawyer certifications, noticing it was twenty minutes before his visit with the Weasleys. He had planned to get a quick shopping trip done between his meeting with Harry and them, but the trip to the vault had taken up the time.
The only boy with glasses was the next to speak, “All we want is to make sure Harry is okay and to make sure he knows that we really care for him and had nothing to do with those peoples horrendous actions. We will willingly submit to truth serum to prove that we had nothing to do with this.”
Percival sat forward in his leather chair, glass discarded on the side table, and gave all his attention to the conversation at hand. “What do you find out?”
“Back to judging Magical Contracts. The Lady, if called upon, will judge illegal contracts, but she can only do it if called upon, unlike Oaths. And if you were to sign the contract thinking there was no way out, it would then become legal, no matter if it was false, to begin with. We believe this is what Dumbledore was hoping would happen.” Remus laid a hand over Neville’s tightening fist, Harry not noticing, too busy questioning how he could have been so wrong about the Headmaster. Ron and Hermione had never mentioned such things to him even though he was sure it was something they both would have known, especially Ron.
“Come now, my boy, I am sure we-” Dumbledore’s thin voice was cut off by Percival’s much more commanding one.
“Harry said no. And besides, he is still under 24/7 medical watch, he has daily potions that need to be administered.” Issy informed them, clearly relying on the mental training she undertook to become a healer to keep her calm.
“That’s ingenious, Harry has told me about your dreams of owning a joke shop. With how inventive you are, I am sure you will go far in anything you choose to do.” Bartok’s smile was genuine and proud. With the way his son had talked about these two, and how honestly and proudly they confessed their love, Bartok was sure the three would be bonded and married in no time. And Bartok was glad for it, they obviously cared for and were protective of Harry at that was what mattered most to Bartok.
His control was barely hanging on by a thread. And that was when a pitch black Eagle Owl soared through the open window. Albus sighed at the sight, the familiar owl breed that only Gringotts owned, the owl dropping the thick letter atop his head and then zoomed back out the window. Albus wasn’t quick enough to curse the filthy beast, so he ripped open the parchment, the top of the letter ripping in his anger.
Percy was trying to calm down the twins who looked ready to kill. Percy felt the same, and if his brothers weren’t able to control themselves Percy would be the first one to help cover up the murder.
While his Grandmother at first looked very worried, the more she heard, the more pleased she looked. Neville wasn't quite sure why but he had learned to trust his Gran in such things. She was raised to find advantages that others missed. While Neville knew she could easily destroy anyone, he also knew she would never do anything to hurt him. And because of that, she would use the advantages she saw to help Harry.
When Arthur first found out about his friend’s incestuous relationship he had been shocked, but they had trusted him enough to tell him, so he listened to what they had to say. Apparently, magical twins could hear each other's thoughts and because of this, they couldn’t hide anything from each other, even the sexual. But that they still wanted to marry someone, it would just be the same someone. It had taken Arthur a while to understand, but with time he was just happy that they were happy. And to be honest, he couldn’t imagine them ever being without the other.
Harry stared at his friend in disbelief, “So you mean it was supposed to do that?” Neville just nodded. “Oh…” Harry mumbled, looking over his shoulder at the apparently innocent toilet that in fact was not out to get him.
When Remus first arrived at Grimmauld Place, after Sirius messaged him with his location, he had been too scared to even touch the other man. Had been afraid Sirius would reject him after the years of abandonment. Remus should have known better, but he let everyone else cloud his judgment.
They both dissolve into hysterical laughter. Godric falling atop Salazar’s slender frame, the other man pushing at him weakly, laughter still strong. “Get off of me, you fat lump.”
Salazar just smiled again, and wistfully stated that Godric's heart was too big for his own good. And of course, with hundreds of years together they would both eventually fall in love with the other clan members. But that they would always love each other was enough Salazar.
So Godric told him about the Purge, something he hadn't wanted his mate to learn from a book. The tale brought tears to Salazar's eyes, always so empathetic to others' struggles and tragedies.
“Who is?” Percy asked, mind already running with options. But what Ron said wasn’t one he ever thought possible.
“I’m sure if you tell me what potions he is on I would be more than able to handle his care. After all, I have raised seven children and seen my fair share of sickness.” Molly tried again, laughing hollowly at the joke she made.
Augusta wanted to fall apart in a way she hadn’t since she had witnessed her Son and Daughter-in-Law laying in St. Mungos looking like fragile children, healers swarming around them, doing everything they could just to keep them stable. Not only had she gone through that, but she had also survived the loss of her husband and the near extinction of her family.
Halfway through Bartok’s explanation, Harry’s magic spiked dangerously, plates and glasses rattling ominously. Anna placed a calming hand on Harry’s thigh while she spiked his water with calming draught. They all started carrying around vials of the potion once the instability of Harry’s emotions became clear to them. They all knew that Harry letting out of his emotions was a necessary part of healing, but they only wanted him to process the feelings, not necessarily linger on them for hours while crying.
This serum, unlike veritaserum, was a subtle compulsion that made one think they wanted to tell the truth. The reason it was illegal was that it was much easier to make than veritaserum and its nature made the person spill secrets without having to be prompted. The ministry had made it illegal since it was so much more damning than veritaserum and they were afraid of being forced to spill secrets. And while it was easier to make the ingredients needed to make it was much more expensive.
The Phoenix sighed longingly, “I wish, but I know he will need time, and I have some things I need to do.” He ran a hand through his long wild red hair, the curls tangling towards the end. “I should be going, the longer I wait, the harder it will be for me to leave.” He turned to walk back towards the bed, looking down on his sleep mate, running a hand through the curly brown hair and over a white- and gold-tipped fox ear.
His hands skittered away, his dusky nipples already so hard that they ached too much to touch. His flat stomach was shaking, his muscles burning.
So he held it close, the urge to take whenever one of his friends received anything from home. It wasn’t that he wanted to steal. It was that he wanted to
Before Remus could start telling Sirius about what they had found out about Severus, a vortex of flame appeared in the middle of the room. All the Claremores looked nonplussed, while their guests were all shocked.
“We are working on collecting memories to show you, but we need some time to edit certain things out,” Remus interjected when he saw the hopeful look on Harry’s face. They wanted him to have those memories, to get to know his parents in this way, but they didn’t want Harry to have to see the traitor. And removing a whole person from memories took time. Harry nodded in understanding and let the subject drop.
On the other hand, Sirius and Lyle were regaling about their past pranks. Harry laughing along whenever he was focused on them. The two already plotting pranks they would play together. Harry could imagine George and Fred alongside them and shuddered violently, sure he had just seen a vision of the apocalypse.
Harry hadn’t realized that the reason Sirius and Remus were keeping him close was that they didn’t know what had happened over the last month and didn’t trust these strangers with his safety. Harry realized this when Sirius said, “Dumbledore said you were kidnapped. Thanks to Mooney, we didn’t believe him, and seeing how much better you look than the last time we saw you we were right not to.”
Bartok gently clasped the bracelet around Harry’s thin wrist. “This is your family. It is a tradition to give submissives such a present when they come of age. When you bond with a mate, they will give you a charm with their family crest on it. It is akin to wedding rings in that way.” Bartok paused, pulling another smaller black box from his pocket and opening it. “And this is the Claremore crest with its larimar stone. We would be honored if you would wear it as part of your family crests.”
Something inside of him had shattered, not part of him but placed there by the old man in front of him. Severus knew what it was, a subtle slavery spell that slowly had taken over his body, making him a prisoner in his own body.  Severus could see the rage he felt echoed in Dumbledore’s eyes but that didn’t matter to him.
Issy enthusiastically started telling about the new manor, Harry had yet to see it. However, Issy assured him he would love it. She mooned over the sprawling grounds and the extensive gardens that surrounded the manor for which it was named. She excitedly told him about his new rooms she had been working on, bouncing up and down as she did, not noticing the shock this statement induced in her son. Luckily for Harry’s sanity, the floo flared, distracting them all. Harry tensed as an unknown man, walked out of the fire in heavy black leather robes, but when Bartok stood and greeted the man warmly with a hug Harry relaxed. While the man’s face was much softer than his Papa’s, he was just as striking. His features offset by the sharp line of his pitch black collar and slicked back blond hair. He had the intense look of a seasoned fighter something he recognized by the look Harry had seen on his Godfather’s face as he left the castle on the back of Buckbeak.
They eat a lunch of finger sandwiches cuddled together on the TV room couch while watching Star Wars. Lyle had insisted on it when he found out that Harry had never seen the movie, he had acted horrified and it had made Harry burst into laughter.
“Thank you for taking care of him,” He had to restart multiple times because of how hoarse his voice was from centuries of disuse. When he could finally speak, it was barely above a whisper, but he knew all the Claremore clan could easily hear him, the room deadly silent. He looked at the man who he had first meet and pulled away to help his mate. “And you, I owe you a life debt beyond anything I can ever fulfill, but I will try my hardest.”
Sleep came to him easily, and when he woke the next morning, much earlier than expected and Harry still fast asleep he guiltily went to take a shower, more to take care of his morning wood than any need to wash.
“Yes, and I assume by what Mr. Claremore told us that you have also bonded with Mr. Potter,” The look in her eyes said that if she thought he would do anything untoward to the two underage wizards, she would remove his genitals with a rusty spoon.
Harry, who Arthur considered one of his own children. Who he had promised to do everything he could to take care of. Harry, who now probably hated them and thought that they were all thieves. That their care wasn’t genuine… well, Molly, Ginny, and Ron were not genuine. They couldn’t be. No one who cared about someone would steal from them.
The only thing Harry could think of that might help was if Sirius talked to the portrait of his parents. When he first heard about them during the Will reading Harry had been ecstatic at the thought of talking to them. But then the anxiousness hit.
Sirius removed the memory in question with an easy flick, dropping the blue thread into the bowl. “Now, would you like us to go in with you?”
He still didn’t like the thought of his baby bonding, but he was grateful that so far all of Harry’s mates and potential mates met his standards. He would still have to test them just to make sure. Bartok tucked the journal away with care, “I promise to get this to him today.”
Harry sat, the porcelain surprisingly warm and went about his business as usual and when finished he reached towards where the toilet paper should be, only to find nothing before he could start to worry something shocking happened. Warm water was shooting at his privates, the water hitting his ass, causing a strange tingle to shoot up his spine. He yelped in surprise, jumping up and rounding on the toilet which was still there looking innocently back at him. The door behind him burst open, Harry spinning on his heel to confront the intruder, but his bottoms were still around his ankles and he barely had time to catch himself on the wall before he fell.
When he had first seen it at thirteen Neville understood why she had always done this and he wished he could just ask her to continue.
It took them four hours just to get the whole chamber cleansed. And while the stones weren’t as saturated or brilliant as they once were with time and care they would return to their original state, and with Hogwarts now sentient they might be even more spectacular than they once were. The more they did, the more the magic of the room seemed to relax around them, hopeful and content.
Percy knew one of the first things he needed to do was contact the Goblins, they could easily ruin their family for what those three had done and his Father didn’t need to deal with the stress. They also needed to find a way to get in contact with Harry to make sure he was okay and to try and find a way to cancel the marriage contract.
Later he would thank Harry’s new parents for all the care they were showing him, but for now, he could only focus on the young man in front of him. He rested their heads together, Harry’s magic reaching out to him.
A knock soon announced the arrival of their guests, six red-headed men filing into the room. They all looked grim, even the two Bartok knew to be Fred and George from his son’s stories of them, and he had said they always had a smile on their faces.
Sirius wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulder, pulling his pup into his side. “Yes, Harry, eventually you will be able to bear children. You won’t be able to until you reach sexual maturity at eighteen when you go through your last magical boost. And if you never want to bear children, or have children at all, that is also perfectly okay.” Sirius wanted to be as careful as possible with his words, wanted to make sure they didn’t push Harry into anything he didn’t want.
Sirius pouted at their lack of trust but understood. This was something very important to Harry’s health and safety and no one wanted to risk that going wrong. Sirius told them his plans and they all relaxed and thought Sirius’ plan was a good idea. Issy even started tearing up at how thoughtful she found it.
Sirius laughed softly, “Because he cares about you, pup, as he should, you are a wonderful person. And only an idiot wouldn’t see that. And you are already bonded, in terms of Creature Laws you are technically already married.”
“I want to say you don’t have to go if you don’t want to, I can stand in your place.” Before Harry to say that of course, he wanted to go, Bartok continued. “The only reason I mention this is because Dumbledore was mentioned in the Will, so he will be in attendance.”
Days spent curled into Salazar’s side, naked and glowing with contentment while Sal lounged only in his black acromantula silk dressing gown, scribbling away in his journal about now potion and spell ideas. Godric would run his fingers through Salazar’s silky black hair and over the smooth column of his long pale neck that was covered with red and purple bruises.
It was another twenty minutes before Fudge and his posse strode out of the floo as if they owned the place. He didn’t even wait to be invited to take a seat. Everyone else was tense, even the two Aurors the Ministry brought with them as they eyed up Percival.
As soon as they were out of Harry’s hearing range, Neville was looking over at his Grandmother for more information about what she had learned about the illegal marriage contract. It was Anna who spoke up, going over just how despicable it all was, obviously pleased that Augusta and Neville were so angry on behalf of her son.
Minerva had never seemed the type to participate in such heinous acts, but after so many years of being used and abused, Severus didn’t know who to trust. Luckily, the woman seemed to expect his suspicion, her wand on the floor between them. Severus eyed her warily as he bent, wand pointed between her eyes, and picked up her wand, pocketing it.
Harry took the open space between Remus and Sirius, looking around one last time before the stillness ended.
Tiptop popped in, a boatload of food floating behind her. The dining table was soon groaning with a feast fit for Hogwarts. Scotch eggs, full English, pancakes, sausage, omelets, and eggs benedict. Fruits he had never before seen. When Harry insisted Tiptop join them for breakfast, she didn’t even bother protesting, knowing she would cave to her little master’s wishes, and took her rightful seat at the head of the table.
But here they were, Molly staying home every day and Arthur spending twelve hours a day at work. And it hadn’t been until he became head of his department four years ago that he finally got a day off. So now he spent every Sunday devoted to his children.
Harry groaned as he pulled his blankets over his head, smothering his embarrassment in the soft fabric. It had been less than twenty-four hours since his Godfathers explained sex and sexuality to him and it seemed as if Harry had gone insane. After years of never thinking about it suddenly all his thoughts were consumed by it.
David placed a large stack of books in front of Harry. “I bought you some more books I thought we could read together and a few about your families’ histories, though I am sure you will have been books on that in your family vaults.” Harry ran his fingers down the stack, quickly reading over the names.
Finally, five days later, Godric was able to pull him aside to start helping him learn more about what the world now had to offer.
Neville went rigid, head snapping towards his old Professor, and barked, “Marriage contract?” His eyes like razor blades and his words like hot steel.
Bartok couldn’t help the weary sigh, the past fortnight had been a whirlwind, and the only thing keeping them all grounded was each other and the want to keep their son safe. “As you know, our son was in an abusive home.” Both men’s knuckles went white around their crystal glasses. “And while on the surface that by itself is horrible, the more we have looked into his life, the worse things seem to be.”
Harry couldn’t help but to beam up at her, her excitement infectious as always. Shooting stars danced around the dark blue paper and Harry opened it as carefully as he could. Before he could really get a grip on what was in the box, Issy was speaking up.
The only thing keeping Dumbledore under control at that point was the many people outside the bank. They were just beasts but he couldn’t turn around and blast the doors with Fiendfyre like he wanted to. He did, however, let out a fierce growl, not worried about these things seeing him without his Grandfatherly mask.
Harry watched the man stride into the room, mesmerized by the pure confidence the Auror exuded. It almost seemed as if he glided across the quartz flooring, his black leather robes flapping behind him in a way that reminded Harry of Professor Snape. While he disliked how the man behaved, he couldn’t deny the man had a flair for the dramatic.
The adults settled back into the living room once they were finished with dinner, Issy escorting the children to bed. Sirius collapsed into his mate's lap, needing his steady presence to comfort him. He had held in his screams of rage and tears of heartbreak as he listened to Bartok tell them the story of the past month. The only thing that had kept him from doing so was Harry’s, very much alive, form next to him. But now with Harry out of sight and the knowledge that he was safe within the cradle of Remus’ long arms he finally allowed the tears to fall. Sobbing between shaky inhales of air that couldn’t be called breaths. Remus was his rock as he always had been, rubbing circles into his back and mumbling soothing nothings into the shell of his ear.
David was the one to speak up, automatically shifting to teacher mode. And Harry could imagine him and Remus getting along very well, Harry had seen how lonely Remus was and even though he had Sirius back he still wished the man had more people in his life. He felt the same about Sirius, he couldn’t imagine the isolation the man had been subjected to. Fourteen years in Azkaban and then a year on the run with only his guilt for company. Harry wished he could convince Sirius that what happened to his parents wasn’t the man’s fault. But Harry knew guilt all too well and knew that only time and care could absolve him of those feelings, and even then the guilt would still be a scar on his Godfather’s heart.
Tiptop popped up the moment they got to the mouth of the corridor that led to Harry's quarters, cast iron pan in hand. She relaxed as soon as she saw who it was, her warrior stance relaxing and pan disappearing.
Bartok had rushed them back into the bedroom, instructing them all to get dressed in their best clothes. They were quick on the uptake and were soon dressed and on their way to the Ministry, sticking close to Bartok, who promised to protect them while out. Bartok walked as if they were in no hurry, not giving the bigots what they wanted.
By the time Tiptop popped into the room to announce dinner, Harry was starving. Harry went to get up but Sirius refused to let him go, carrying him all the way to the dining room. Remus and Sirius flanked him and were soon filling his plate with a wonderful roast dinner.
But kudo and comments also make my day, like a lot, everyone makes me smile like crazy and want to write to make  you all happy.
Dumbledore jumped up, the two Weasleys following, as he bristled at Percival’s demand. “Now see here, you cannot just dismiss me, I am the Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump!” His wand appeared in his hand as he faced the imposing Auror.
“It’s too early, Issy, go away,” The man whined, mouth pouting in a way that made him look much younger.
“You dare send Lily a letter saying I didn’t wish to speak to her! After all you made me do, made me turn against my friends and loved ones, made me treat the students like dirt! Made me turn a blind eye to abuse and injustice. Made me brew extremely dark, Black magic potions. I didn’t think you could fall further. But to dare allow Lily to die thinking I hated her, and then to make me seem like a monster to her son, that is your greatest sin!”
She stared at them blankly as she dug into her pocket to pull out a gum wrapper, holding it out for Neville to take.
Everyone relaxed except for Percival who stayed on guard until the flames shifted back to orange and subsided. Issy was the first to voice her dislike for Dumbledore, but everyone was quick to agree with her.
Remus spoke up, allowing Sirius to gather himself. “There are many things like this, that some people find enjoyable while others don’t. These are called fetishes and sometimes go by kinks. Like with anything involving sex, if you don’t want to do something don’t allow anyone to convince you otherwise, but also keep an open mind. And as long as all parties are of age and consenting there is nothing to be ashamed of if you enjoy it.” Remus wanted to make sure Harry knew that consent was paramount.
After the destruction incident, Sirius had pulled away from him. They had barely talked in the three months leading up to that terrible Halloween night. Sirius had avoided them all, and when he was around he was distant, emotions only showing when Harry reached out to him. Sirius had even moved out of the flat they had shared since they left Hogwarts, no warning and no note. Remus had just come home after work one day to see all of Sirius’ belongings missing.
Salazar jumped up, back straight and eyes full of determination. “Get up you lazy sod, we have no time to waste.”
“It is nice to see you all again, and to meet you, Mr. Potter,” Percival said, voice gravelly, as he bowed deeply.
But that was a discussion for another day. For now, they had already wasted enough time. They had much to get done before Godric’s spell wore off. So much to get done. “I wish we could stay like this forever, but… I am sorry, but we have things to get done.” Godric finally looked back up at Sal, his face had gone blank, so Godric rushed to explain. “Salazar, Sal, the evilest man is currently Headmaster. And… Sal… I am so sorry… He... He is the reason Boudicca is dead. He used dark magic on her to bind her to him, and then… then he forced her to do unthinkable things. Sal, I am so sorry.”
Harry sat back down gingerly, his wet behind feeling strange as he moved. Harry was tense, every muscle clenched as he tried to force himself to follow Neville’s instructions and relax. He sat there for a good five minutes before his butt unclenched and only a few seconds before a spray of water started again.
"We have done all the preliminary exams to start on a robust course of action. At this point, we are not sure we can ever completely restore their health, but we are confident we can make their standard of living better. We will be looking for a potions master to help us work on finding a cure, but I will not lie to you and promise more than we can give." Healer Lorraine stated. Anna had pulled out a notebook and started taking notes since she knew the two Longbottoms might be too emotional to take everything in.
The room had been a beautiful room lined with crystals and gems of all sizes and colors. It would glitter in the daylight, rainbows dancing around the room with the movement of the sun. But now the room was only filled with shades of gray, even the brilliant sapphire’s color washed out to the point that there was no blue to be found. This had been the first room built, every stone to followed anchored in the magic here.
Both women took in a shocked breath, they knew Dumbledore was evil, but they were still shocked by how horrid the man was. “Tiptop!” Anna cried out, the elf popping in immediately, “Can you please get both of our med bags? There is an emergency we need to tend to.”
“Neville,” Harry snapped, breaking Neville out of his fury, he looked over to his mate, Harry’s brows furrowed but his feet rubbing at Neville’s shins. “Nev, I know you are mad but there is no use for that, the contract is broken already.” Harry tried his best to be reassuring, but Neville’s anger was still bubbling under the surface. Even if he wasn’t Harry’s mate he would still be furious anyone was trying to steal his friends choice. He loved Harry and all he wanted was his happiness.
“He’s going to get Mr. Black and bring him here. We will wait until they get back to start our discussions.” Bartok called for Tiptop, the House-Elf popping in with a full tea service. She was in her best dress, Claremore crest over her breast.
But his fury grew, how dare they block his entrance. “What do you mean, I am the Headmaster of the school.”
He was mesmerized by it. Without his sight, he had forgetten the fact he now had a tail and ears, but now he could no longer pretend to still be human. But it was so soft and pretty that it almost didn’t matter to him.
Reluctantly, everyone got up and dressed for the day, Harry took in the bedroom as he dressed. Their room was much like their last one, warm woods, and sky blue wallpaper but Issy had taken this opportunity to redecorate. Before she met Anna and fell in love with healing, Issy had been thinking of becoming an interior designer, but now she did it as a hobby, helping friends and family whenever they needed it. She had lit up like a string of Christmas lights when she realized that Harry would need more furniture for his new room.
If Salazar were a Phoenix, his hair would currently be up in flames. He roared, “Two words, Godric! Two words, that’s all it would take!”
He noticed that Harry’s new mother, Issy, was staring down at his penis, he usually would smirk but instead he just casually covered himself. “May I borrow some clothes?” Issy blushed and refocused on his face.
I leave to Lily Rose Potter nee Evans of Godric’s Hollow, England, if she shall survive me, the bulk of my estate with the exception of my other bequests. In the case, she is unable to accept this bequest it is to be held in trust by Sirius Orion Black of London, England, for Hadrian James Potter of Godric’s Hollow, England. My dear Lily flower, I am sorry I have left you early, but you will forever be in my heart. Know that I love you and Harry dearly and that I wish I could be there to see our son grow into the good man I know he will be and watch as our hairs turn white together. I have left letters in the main vault for you and Harry for each birthday. Please wake my portrait when it is safe for you to.
“But the removal was rather sudden, and as the Minister, I have a right to know such things,” Fudge tried.
Issy was sitting cross-legged in her rich wooden chair, a smile splitting her face in two and her mid-length wavy white hair which shimmed blue when she turned, blew in an invisible wind. Her skin fresh honey-colored skin and vibrant blue eyes welcoming like a warm hug. She looked very young, but her eyes were motherly. Tears started to well in her eyes as soon as she saw him, though Harry wasn’t sure why.
Compared to the other males he had seen in different states of undressed he wasn’t much to look at. He was scrawny, his figure too boney compared to that of boys like Oliver, whose every muscle was defined. He didn’t have broad shoulders like Neville, that looked like they could shoulder all your burdens. He didn’t have the confidence of the twins, Harry’s body even now trying to curl in on itself to hide. To protect.
Harry immediately jumped up, rushing towards the oncoming dog. Padfoot bowled him over, and they both landed on the ground, Harry laughing while Sirius licked his cheeks, tail wagging and whining.
Issy threw the doors open to reveal a sitting room. There were three huge couches and four leather armchairs. Harry was shocked, this looked more like a living room than a bedroom. Harry couldn’t help but look up at Issy in shock, but the woman didn’t seem to notice, she just started speaking.
I leave to Andromeda Druella Tonks nee Black and Theodore Edward Tonks of London, England, if they survive me, Vault 588. If they are unable to accept this bequest it is to be held in trust by Sirius Orion Black of London, England, for Nymphadora Evangeline Tonks of London, England. For the many nights when you babysat Harry when Lily and I needed a break. Some days I think you both were the only reason we didn’t go insane at the beginning.
Unbeta'd. This whole day was going to be like 15-20k words so I split it up to multiple short chapters.
Bartok reached over, resting his much larger hand over Augusta’s trembling one. Her head whipped towards him, eyes wide when she saw the sorrow there. “No,” She croaked, she had lost so much, Neville was the last of her family left. Sure she had many distant Nieces and Nephews but until today the only one she was in contact with was Andromeda, everyone else had died during the wars. Her cousins Dorea Potter, Cedrella Weasley, and even Druella and Pollux who she had always hated, where gone. And it didn’t matter if she hated the last two. They were family, they were her’s and now they were all gone, the only ones left Druella’s daughters, one a blood traitor in Azkaban, another too ashamed of what her sister had done to ever visit Augusta and the third an outcast for marrying a Muggle-born. And Cedrella’s son Arthur, too busy with his seven children and horribly overbearing harpy of a wife. But now she had Sirius who she thought for so long to be a blood traitor and - How could she have ever believed that? - the Sirius she knew would have died before putting James at risk, let alone Harry.
Harry didn’t understand why, he turned to Remus, who only had a light flush to ask a question. “Moony, what is masturbation?”
Godric had known that Dumbledore had tampered with the wards, there was no way either the Cerberus or Troll would have gotten into the school without him doing that. But something the man had done was slowly strangling the life out of the school and stealing her voice.
Bartok sighed deeply, he knew that if the Ministry continued on this path, all the creatures living in Britain would flee for better shores. And what the bigots weren’t considering was the economic impact it would have on their community. It would be their undoing. Just the transfer of Harry’s vaults alone would make a huge impact.
Harry had always wanted to reach out a wipe that soil from his round cheeks, he didn’t know why but he held back any time the urge struck him.
Towards the end of the meal, when everyone was taking minutes between bites Bartok spoke up, “Harry, the Goblins want to know if four days from now will be a good time for the Will reading?”
His school belongings had all been new, and that had eased the ache a little, but it had still always been there. A yearning for more. And Harry always felt horrible when that monster reared its head, guilt filling him for his greed. It was something he never told anyone, he didn’t dare. Didn’t want to see the look on anyone’s face when they saw this dark part of himself.
After Harry sat in silence for what seemed to be another hour, he finally stood and said he was ready to leave. They linked hands and Sirius guided them through pulling away from the memory.
Harry had always thought it was a strange looking body part, hanging limply between his legs resting on his small testicles. The skin was much pinker than anywhere else on his body, even more so than his lips. What Harry now knew to be the foreskin, around his main genitals, looked like an oversized turtle-neck sweater, hanging a centimeter from the main body of his penis.
Percival couldn't help the small chuckle that escaped his lips. His own House-Elf Winston was much the same, and he thought the two would get along well.
“Harry, there is no way we would allow them to take you from us; I even have an Auror friend who will be at the meeting to make sure they don’t try anything. Trust us, we will protect you with all we have.” Harry buried his face in Bartok’s neck, allowing his Papa to shelter him within his strong arms. The warmth lulled him to sleep, drool soon dripping down the side of his mouth.
But in that moment she didn’t remember that. All Issy could think of was that her child was in danger and that she was unable to move to help them. It had flashed her back to the day- Issy shook her head, forcing herself to stay in the present.
Sirius paused the memory in a flash, looking between Remus and Harry in confusion. Remus groaned, hand coming to rub at his temple before he looked back down at Harry who was just innocently curious. Remus decided to take one for the team.
Harry also knew that the contract had been made when Ginny was under a year old, but he also knew that she wouldn’t have hesitated to agree to it. The way she had looked at him had always scared him, and the twins had worked to keep them apart when he told them this.
“It has come to our attention that you have custody of young Mr. Potter, is this correct?” Fudge asked, atrocious lime green bowler now being nervously turned in the man’s sweaty hands.
Remus started with the very basics in as clinical of terms as he could manage, knowing that Harry would be able to figure out the rest for himself. Before Remus could get to the subject of anal masturbation, Harry spoke up, face twisted into shock.
After Harry put on his last ring, Helix pulled out the list of all returned items to the Potter vaults.
While Bartok was working on calming Harry, David was doing the same with Issy. Anna and Lyle inspected the black box that had fallen to the floor. Inside the box was a rolled up piece of parchment, after check it for spells Lyle opened it, the usual hint of mischief completely missing from his gaze.
His beyond soft blanket was red. And there in his arms was his teddy bear, with black fur and green glass eyes. A snore snapped Harry from the admiration of his teddy, spread out over the couch was a tall man, skin tan and dark chocolate hair long and splaying all over the couch and floor.
“But that’s dirty! And if you touch it for too long, it will fall off!” Harry screamed hysterically, looking at the two of them as if they were trying to kill him.
Godric just slouched into the comfortable embrace, mind drifting. He didn’t notice how Issy was observing him, scrutinizing every expression that passed his face.
But Tiptop popped in, putting their discussion on hold, another feast behind her. She sat, table setting itself. They all made their plates and started to eat, but David picked back up the conversation.
He spent that time casting cleaning spells over his sweat and dirt cover skin and then started to meditate to try to repair his core as much as he could in the short period of time. He had barely finished patching up the hole made by the violent breaking of his bond to Fawkes when the alarm that alerted him to start of the meeting went off. Dumbledore rushed in, allowing his robes to billow behind him. He took his seat in the Chief Warlock box and survived his surroundings. The disgusting creatures were already at their defendant’s desk in the middle of the room, Bartok Claremore calmly shifting papers on the desk. Dumbledore itched to send a compulsion the man’s way, but he stopped himself when he saw that panicked look on Dedalus’ face.  Dedalus was motioning towards Dumbledore, trying to get Albus to come over so they could talk but Albus doubted it could be that important and waved him off. This case would be a quick win, and whatever his old ally had to say could wait.
“Well, Harry, all Oaths and Magical Contracts are given to Lady Magic to ensure. She is the one who judges you if you break promises of that nature. There are a couple of ways people make oaths, the first, and least damaging is swearing
“Severus, you have been and always will be my friend,” Lucius said, no doubt in his tone as he opened the front door of Malfoy Manor wide. The blindingly white foyer like salvation.
Finally, he pressed a kiss to his mate’s forehead and stood from the bed, unashamed in his nakedness as he stood in front of his mate’s adoptive parents. They were all sitting there silently, eyes wide as they stared at him.
Percival leaned back in his care, thoughtful until he finally seemed to realize who Bartok’s son was. “Your talking about the Potter boy.” Bartok nodded his confirmation. “I know the case was partially sealed to help keep the boy’s identity a secret. But since I am one of the Head Aurors I have at least heard of it. But I haven’t heard about anyone I know being involved.” Percival frowned, going over all he heard about the case looking for anything he had overlooked. But nothing came to mind. Percival knew Bartok and knew that the man would never accuse anyone without solid proof, so it worried him that someone he knew might be involved in the abuse of a child. He liked to think he was a good judge of character, but if Bartok was right then, he had overlooked something significant.
Albus awoke the next morning to an owl tapping insistently on the grimy small window, and every fiber of his being burning as if he was caught within ablaze of Fiendfyre, his brain feeling like it was wrapped in cotton wool. But the damned owl persisted, and Albus was forced to get to his shaky feet just to get the bird to stop. It held in its beak an official summons from the Ministry, the letter revealing  Fudge had moved up the date for the DuMorne clan’s trial. Normally, he appreciated Fudge being clever enough to try and throw the filthy creatures off their game, but today Dumbledore couldn’t help but want to kill the man. Albus was in no state to appear publicly, but he also had no choice, if he wasn’t there to lead his people there was no way they would win the case. Albus also knew that the man who now had custody of Harry Potter was the lawyer for the Vampires, and after a failure would be the perfect time to ambush him. He had also already convinced the Minister of the families potentially nefarious intentions with the boy, so he had to make an appearance.
Both men jumped apart as if the bedsheets and duvet weren’t on the floor, and Harry’s hair didn’t look like he had just been in a wind tunnel, all his curls separated.
“Greetings Bartok and young Mr. Potter,” Helix said as he pulled off his glasses and set his current document off to the side. He pulled open the drawer of his desk and started pulling out black velvet ring boxes. “All you have to do is to try on the ring, they will either accept you or return to their box. We will start with the ones most likely to accept you,” Helix informed, handing one of the boxes to Harry.
Harry was surprised at how fast Remus could move, his body tensing in preparation to attack if there was a threat to him. That silent act showed Harry just how much the other man cared for him, and he couldn’t help the tear that fell from his eyes, he was wiping it away with the back of his hand when Remus took a large step to the side. Harry looked up to see Neville standing in the doorway tensely. Harry barely recognized him, the other boy had suddenly shot up like a sprout and the baby fat he carried, especially in his face, having melted away.
I appoint my spouse, Lily Rose Potter nee Evans, as the sole Executor of this Will, but if my spouse should predecease me, or should refuse or be unable to act or continue to act as my Executor, then I appoint Sirius Orion Black of London, England to be the sole Executor of this Will in the place of my spouse.
All the Claremores looked around at each other in silence, stiff with tension. Tiptop popped in with another tea service and forced cups into everyone’s hands.
When he got home, he would need to talk to Sirius about this. When Helix said that the Lupin ring was next, Harry was even more surprised, Harry had never heard that the house of Lupin was one of those ancient houses that had Lordships. And he was confused about why his teacher wouldn’t at least buy himself some new clothes. Harry had noticed just how uncomfortable and embarrassed Moony felt about teaching in his tatty robes, and Harry knew that feeling so well that if he were in the man’s place, he would never be able to be half the teacher Lupin was.
Godric flamed back into the Hogwarts’ Headmaster office, the school wards welcoming him in like a child would a long-missed parent. When they first built the castle and made the wards she wasn’t sentient, it hadn’t been until after 500 years of absorbing wild magic and the excess from spells being continuously cast that Godric had first heard her voice. He tried to speak to her, but she couldn’t understand him in his Phoenix form. The best Godric could do was to sing to her.
“So if you call Lady Magic to judge an illegal contract she will destroy it and make a legal one in its place for the offending parties. The more heinous the illegal contract the more damning her’s will be.” Remus finished sitting back in his chair to finish his tea.
First Albus went to Grimmauld Place, ready to capture the two men inside and deliver them to the Ministry. He planned to claim Remus, a dangerous beast who had almost killed students at the end of the year was now hiding mass murder, Sirius Black. He was sure that Fudge would be too overjoyed to finally have caught Sirius to ask any questions before throwing them both to the dementors.
Tears filled his eyes as they always did, taking the wrapper like it was the most fragile piece of glass. Whispering a thank you that his Mother didn’t hear as she turned and went back to her window.
“Molly, dear, calm yourself. I am sure we can get this back under control, we were only doing what was best for the children and were trying to save them from Voldemort.” Albus reassured calmly, eyes twinkling. He needed her to believe in him completely, her faith in him was one of the only reasons he had been able to control her so completely. Well, that and the subtle compulsions he placed on her long ago. “We, unfortunately, have bigger things to worry about than the Goblins.” Albus used the tip of his wand pull over the decree from Lady Magic, unwilling to touch it. Molly snatched up the paper, hissing at the feel of the magic on it.
Harry wanted to be honest with Sirius and Remus since they had been so willing to tell him about their relationship, had shared the story of how they got together. And when he compared how happy they made each other to the relationship of Petunia and Vernon, he couldn’t imagine calling what they shared unnatural. The way they looked at each other, touched each other, finished each other's thoughts was the most natural thing Harry had seen and it made him ache to have something like that for himself.
“While I was a slave under that man’s control, I saw many things, one of those was Mr. Black being cursed many times. I am sure while the compulsions have by now faded some, he has been under them for so long that his violent reaction to even the word Slytherin shows that they still have a partial hold on him.” Godric informed them, Anna and Issy rushing over to Sirius as soon as they realized someone needed their healing. Anna calling for Tiptop to retrieve her medical bag.
Issy huffed, face turning into a pout. “I know that! I still don’t like it. He’s my baby, and he is too young to be looking for mates.” Issy whined.
Dorea began her lesson, beginning with the fact that puberty was inevitable, and that the changes happening to their bodies was natural. She went over the fact that they would have to shower more often and handed out a pamphlet on personal grooming. Dorea made them swear that before they tried any of the spells on themselves they would go to her or Charlus to make sure they had gotten the spells down. Remus whispered to Harry that they would provide him with a similar list of spells and that Neville would have them mastered by now if Harry didn’t want to come to them with it.
“Me too,” Neville replied voice soothing, reaching over to cover Harry’s tightly balled hand with his own.
Lyle looked surprised, “You have been looking for three years now! Congratulations! Tell me more about him.”
Harry let his hands wander on his once scar-covered skin that was now smooth, goosebumps rising in the wake of his hands. His nipples pebbling when he ran a blunt fingernail around the edge, a strange grunt escaping him at the unfamiliar feeling. Harry quickly removed his hands from his chest, letting them hang loosely at his sides while he studied himself.
Neville shivered at the thought of what this woman would do if he ever hurt Harry, not that he would, but the thought made chill to the bone nonetheless. Neville shook off the thought as they floo’d into St. Mungo’s lobby, witches and wizards sitting around in different states of distress. He nearly gagged when he saw a man using his severed arm, from a splinching accident, as a back scratcher. When he was younger when they visited his parents his Grandmother would cover his eyes until they arrived at his parent’s private room.
But when Sirius learned what his wolf had called the Headmaster, the first thing he did was bar the man and all others from the house, leaving the wards open only to the two of them and Harry.
Augusta let them all know that she gave Neville the talk before he started Hogwarts, she then let out a small unladylike snort at it, saying he had fainted halfway through. “He was fine, well as fine as can be expected until I pulled out the diagrams for explaining the mechanics of Homosexual sex.” She didn’t notice all the other adults wince and just continued. “Once I woke him and gave him a calming draught he was perfectly fine to continue. So you shouldn’t have to worry about anything from his end. Also, Sirius, Andromeda approached me after the Will reading and requested an audience with Lord Black.”
Percival took a long sip of the smoky drink. “Of course, I will. However, I would like to know why? We both know you are more than capable of protecting yourself and those you care about?”
They confronted him, searching his person for the vial of potion while Neville could do nothing but stand stock still. There was a very good reason no one risked the Weasley twins anger. But when they had opened the vial and taken a sniff they both softened, handing the vial back over and hugging Neville between them.
Anna decided to move them to the guest room Remus and Sirius would be using, now that the bindings had been removed Sirius would be too tired to stay awake. Remus took over levitating his mate, face filled with worry.
So he couldn’t hold in his emotions before he came here he had always been in control of his feelings, always numb. But here and now it seemed like all that well fought for control had been stripped. All his emotions always on display.
Fred leaped forwards, ready to strangle the boy. Charlie was quick to catch his younger brother even though he felt the same. Charlie had only met Harry once but the way his younger brothers talked about him made him feel like family. And both he and Bill had noticed that if Fred and George had anything to say about it, Harry would be their brother-in-law. So Charlie understood why what Ron had said set Fred off. Charlie felt ready to murder him himself, but his Occlumency helped him keep his temper at bay.
Sal had spent months holding her egg against his bare skin, bathing her in his venom every six hours like clockwork until she hatched. The man had never believed he would have children, so Boudicca had been his only chance, and now she was dead. Worse, it was by their mate. Godric didn’t know how Salazar would take that or Godric’s part in it. It had pained him to have to ripe into, but she was too far gone to reason with. Dumbledore had corrupted the bond between her and Salazar, along with the over a hundred years of solitude and the collapse of her tunnels to the forest had driven the poor girl mad. When Godric had been placed under Dumbledore’s slavery spell, he could not get back down to the chamber, he had spent many hours over the millennium with her and considered her a daughter of sorts himself. But he couldn’t allow her to kill Harry or risk the student in school. For weeks after he had mourned her through song.
“That was my last question for you,” Bartok stated, looking at them to see if there was anything else they needed to question. There was nothing else they need to know, all relaxed that these strangers only wanted what was best for Harry.
Harry looked into his Papa’s soft brown eyes and nodded, still in a daze. He would have to go through the vaults one day, but that day was not today. His Papa had a meeting soon, and Harry was already too overwhelmed to do anything more than look around in shock.
So they were all surrounding the two subs, a big group hug. It lasted past the point that most considered acceptable but Harry didn’t care, he could spend the rest of his life here and be content. But as if by some unspoken agreement they all pulled back as one, Issy corralling him towards the set between her and Bartok.
Standing in their floo parlor was Godric Gryffindor, still wearing Bartok’s clothes but looking far warier then he did when they last saw him. On cue, Anna started casting diagnostic spells on the man, other than being magically exhausted; nothing came up as unusual.
Harry scooted closer, only a few inches, and unclenched his fist tangling their fingers together. Neville’s much larger hand encasing Harry’s, squeezing it gently and rubbing his thumb over the back of Harry’s hand as if saying there was nothing to worry about.
Augusta looked over at Neville, silently asking for his opinion. Neville was surprised she had even thought to include him in this but he was glad she did. “I think we should listen to Mrs. Claremore’s advice, she knows more about the healers in Terradore and healing in general.” Augusta nodded at him and Anna, who told both Longbottoms to call them by their first names, and started planning a trip to the clinic in question later that day. Neville asked to go along as well, a proud glint to his Grandmother’s eyes when he asked.
But Godric would never allow that, Salazar would never recover if he had to do the deed. So while it hurt to see Boudicca dead all that Godric would have changed was Harry’s involvement, he would forever have nightmares of the fear on his young mates, the clawing stench of fear and desperation filling the whole chamber. Blood rolling down Harry’s brow and glinting sword in hand.
“Mr. Arthur Weasley, you requested a meeting with my client Mr. Harry Potter, but his Father, Mr. Bartok Claremore, as his legal guardian has requested that he speak to you first before you may see his son in light of the crimes committed by members of your family.” Helix looked at the six Weasleys, his eyes slightly tight.
