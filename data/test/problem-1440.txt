He felt eyes look over him, top to bottom. “How are you gonna explain the…?” Blaise asked, naturally cutting himself off. He gestured to his chest and Draco felt his face heat up.
Pairing: Hermione Granger/Pansy Parkinson
, to serve wizards. Why would anyone want to take that away from them?
"You want to be a good boy, don't you James?" Teddy asked, finally walking towards the bed. They pushed up their sleeves, revealing the sleeve tattoos that James loved so much. "You know what to say when I ask your color, don't you? Answer me, love."
The window glass is fogging up with every breath he takes. Every lurch of the train is pushing more of Harry's thickness inside of him. His hands grasp at the plush seat below him as a thrust nearly puts him off-kilter.
"Oh, Budge," the Headmaster said, as if he were surprised to see him. "What seems to be the matter?"
She stared at him, testing his honesty, before letting go of his arm. A group of players had already gotten dressed in their school uniform and were leaving for the castle. Ron was waiting near the entrance, but Harry waved him off. He’d be able to catch up later.
“Let’s go?” He asked, voice embarrassingly squeakier than he would have liked.
"We can help, you know," Harry whispers. He doesn't want to break the surface tension of the moment. Eventually, it will break. That's inevitable. But he wants to prolong it for as long as possible.
He was waiting then, listening for the voices to get quieter. It almost sickened him with how hesitant he was to do, well, anything without worrying about what others thought of him. Sometimes he liked thinking back to his third year when he felt like he was on top of the world. Like nothing and nobody could touch him. When he and Potter got into scuffles every other day and he enjoyed it.
"Malfoy, is it? Maybe you don't like me at all, Potter..."
He felt he was being split open as the vine traveled further inside of him. He was only able to scream for a few seconds before he was gagged with another vine, wrapping around his skull. His teeth impaled the plant and he gagged at the taste of acidity touching his tongue.
For a moment, Zygmunt allowed himself to believe that Tertius was going to use it to aid him in courting his sad, ugly self. He almost entertained the thought of telling him
, not a hand-me-down or cheap. He owned a walk-in closet to put all of his clothes and shoes. There were houseplants all over, all of different sizes. He probably dedicated too much of his time to keeping them alive.
Harry took a moment to think. He didn’t even think he’d live to hear the word Quidditch again. When he walked into that forest, surrounded by those who loved him who passed on, he couldn’t allow himself to imagine a world in which he won. But now, that’s exactly where Harry was. A world in which he won.
"Something the matter, Potter?" Draco asked, with an undeserved air of confidence.
With a pathetic groan, Draco's cock jerks and spurts all over Harry's calloused palm. He whines in sensitivity when Harry swivels his hips just so. Sighs when he feels the spreading warmth of his cum inside him.
Blaise narrowed his eyes and stopped at Harry. He gestured to Malfoy. "In order to defend my best friend's honor—"
Draco could understand that. His stomach felt warm knowing he was getting along with Granger. He never thought she’d be able to forgive him, but he was happy they could civilly talk about something, even if it was school-related. “Sure. I’m sure she’d love to lend it to you.”
Narcissa isn't a prude by any means, but even she has her limits. And hearing her son's moans while Harry shoves his hands down his pants is one of those limits.
He gazed intently at the curtain, waiting for some sort of evil creature to slither out and attack him.
Pairing: Harry Potter/Draco Malfoy
"Well, go on," he taunted. "Rut against the sofa. Defile it with your bodily fluids. Show the couch just how much you love having your poor arsehole sting after getting raped."
. It's not about what I want. It's what I need to do."
This would happen for just long enough to push them both over the edge, Harry imagines. They'd moan and pant into each other's mouth. Harry would shudder at the uncomfortable stickiness in his clothing. Malfoy would say something about a cleaning charm and Harry would laugh. The ridiculousness of the situation would make them both laugh.
"How would you beat me?"
The cold is even more apparent in comparison with the hot mouth now having access to all of her chest. Her dark nipples tingle the closer Pansy gets to the areolas and she damn near whimpers when the other woman decides to skip over them entirely to kiss elsewhere on her breasts.
Seamus laughed and stood on his toes to kiss his boyfriend deeply. When he pulled away, Dean felt dazed. "I don't know if I should be rewarding such arrogance," Seamus thought aloud.
"You can't do that," Draco said shakily. And, oh Merlin, tears welled up in his eyes and dripped down his face. "You can't do this to me. Expecting me to take you into my arms after violating my trust like that. Don't say
“Nobody noticed when I was younger, Blaise. I don’t think they’ll suddenly start asking now.”
"Ohhhhh. I suppose you do have a point with that. Let me just get comfortable... well? Aren't you going to sit? I'm not a complete monster; you don't need to stand the entire time."
"Ah! No, this isn't about that," Hank reached out to stop him, almost touching Draco's arm. His magic buzzed underneath his fingertips and crackled along his skin. "We're checking in with dozens of other potions shops, internationally. I was just assigned to the shops here. No international traveling for me." He laughed uncomfortably.
vitriolic comments.
At least he was let down gently. The grass was wet and cool against his hot skin. His mouth tasted of ash and acid. He heard the flora creep back into the forest, looking for another victim.
While one vine stroked his shaft slowly, another smaller one rubbed over the head quickly. It was torture. Before this, the only sexual relief he'd ever had was rutting on his pillow in the privacy of his bedroom. He refused to do it at school, where all of his roommates were. That was just humiliating.
Weasley gave him a wide grin and nodded slightly. Being Granger’s boyfriend, he’s probably the most aware out of any of them how much she values her books.
"I was going to cast
"Really?"
Harry stared up at him. “So you’re like Jesus.”
Hermione's cheeks light up and he rolls her eyes. Pansy always takes a bit more time to reach climax, which is quite fun but not the best when they're under time constraints. Which they currently are, as dinner should be over in just a short while. Pansy sneaks one more quick kiss on Hermione's breast before they get covered by her bra again. The skin feels a bit sticky under her clothes but it's the ultimate price she must pay.
Draco smooths his hands down Harry's back and fondles his round arse. Circe, is he not wearing anything under these? What the hell? A spike of arousal heats him up even more. The idea of his lover going full commando as he rushes to meet him during his heat does unspeakable things to his already skyrocketing libido.
Hope you enjoy reading!
"I promise this isn't required just because of the investigation. I mean, uh, I'm not doing this because I want you to spill the shop's secrets or anything." Hank looked positively awkward as hell. "But I would really love to take you out for a drink sometime."
"Did you ever go to school to hone your abilities?"
when he's at Draco's apartment.
Eventually he raised his head. Looked again at Potter's face. A face he knew better than his own. His glasses were askew, so Draco reached up to set them correctly on his nose. He remembered breaking that nose ages ago; it's still a little crooked at the bottom.
Draco was just thinking of putting his pajamas on and going to sleep. Usually, he’s the only one in their room when he changes. But now Potter would be right in the room. Anyone would find it odd that he avoids changing in front of other people, right? Potter would surely find it odd, anyhow.  It would become another reason for him to stalk him. Just to make sure he’s not hiding anything nefarious on his skin.
After a tough moment of silence, Harry stood up and opened the door. He stood there for a few seconds and Draco hoped he would turn around, make him talk, kiss him, fuck him, throw punches,
"Fuck, I can't believe that worked."
To say that he sighed in pleasure because of the warmth of the car heater is an understatement. He could say he moans, which goes only a bit too far.
End notes because I want to mention that I kind of fell in love with Draco and Harry's Dark demon baby as I was describing it? And I almost want to write a follow-up about Draco living as a widower and single parent, with the support of his friends as he grapples with the grief of losing his husband as well as learning how to parent an inhuman baby.
Malfoy was thin, thinner than during their sixth year. He was wearing a plain black and white suit. The sleeve covered his left forearm.
Ten inches. Hawthorn wood. Unicorn hair core. Reasonably springy.
As amusing as the mental image was, Harry shook his head. “That would just make him hate me more.”
"Oh, Blaise told me. When he woke up you were already gone, but he could smell that you were in heat."
"Yes. Unfortunately, our heritage can only produce one descendant at a time. The Malfoys marry other werewolves exclusively, to ensure their offspring have the werewolf gene. Whatever gene that may be. My parents expect me to continue this legacy."
But a question was lying thickly on his mind. It harassed him while he was in bed, staring up at the gray, stone ceiling, his duvet pulled up to his chest. Eventually, he deemed it late enough that if he did ask he most likely wouldn’t get a reply because Potter would be asleep. Draco licked his dry lips.
"There's no way you're getting dumped for a good reason. Why don't you ask her out? I'm sure she'd give you a chance."
Draco's cheeks are in flames. "What reason would I have to lie? This," he raised the book a little, "is my personal diary. I can hardly imagine wondering if my intimate thoughts were going to be read by my rival when I was in fourth year."
Pansy looks a bit dazed. "Probably not. It's alright though. It's so hot being the one to make you come."
Harry frowned. Malfoy was an Occlumens? Did Snape teach him? He remembered the lessons Professor Snape gave him, as useless as they were in the long run. He accidentally met Malfoy's eye and furrowed his eyebrows.
Draco having a Big Gay Crush on Charlie Weasley gives me life
Especially because he was looking so smart; donned in the saffron léine his mother spent quite a pretty penny on for his fourteenth birthday.
He's got a thin sheen of sweat all over his body. His hair was plastered against his forehead slickly. He had even begun crying out with every new sting. Every minute thrust of his hips was desperate, the saliva dripping from his open mouth was debauched. Everything about the scene in front of them made Teddy proud James trusted them with this.
James made during the entire affair was enough to give Teddy a stiffy.
This was the worst day of his fucking life. He would rather be splinched a thousand times over than have Harry Potter,
Blaise pulled him over to the group by his shoulders. "Lighten up, Draco! If that's the case, then I'm sure you have nothing to worry about."
He grins and thanks her graciously before making his way back to the table. Ron claps him on the back. The others cheer, but Dean looks a bit put off as he digs around in his pocket for the promised money.
. Dean looked on in amusement as his boyfriend tried to figure out his plan of attack.
"Pretty sure those still count as tomes, dear."
Draco sighed involuntarily, zoning out as Weasley rushed to join the gaggle of students. Potter didn’t speak to him anymore after Madame Hooch moved on, so they ended up just sitting on the sidelines next to the changing room. Nobody else was deemed a Seeker by Madame Hooch’s standards, so it was just them.
"Wow, thank you for putting it so gently, Dean," Harry tells him. The table laughs at his blunt tone and he can't help but laugh along with them. It feels nice to laugh.
." Flashes of green sparked around the poster bed. "
Pairing: Teddy Lupin/James Sirius Potter
"I'd rather be skinned alive than fucked by you, you filthy animal."
It was easy to set their wand down on the bedside table and sit next to James' body. They kissed him deeply and James matched their energy with just as much emotion. Probably more so, if they were being honest. Teddy reached their hand down and wrapped it around their lover's prick. They weren't using any lube, but they figured James would be too frenzied to wait for them to put some on their hand.
"No, I wasn't here for an interview," Hank said and grimaced. "I work for the Ministry. We've had reports of people using excessive Dreamless Sleep potion so I just wanted to check some records. People who buy large batches, maybe if large bunches have gone missing, anything will help."
But McGonagall didn’t waver. “It is under my experiences that these young adults are… traumatized. Having a comforting sense of the past, or just connecting with the rest of the students, may heal some of our students.”
Harry's wearing Muggle clothes, a pale blue shirt and some exercise shorts. (Did he come back from a run or something?) He smells like a campfire and pouring rain. Draco wraps his arms around his neck and presses his open mouth against Harry's neck. His sweat tastes like vanilla cake and treacle. It's enough to make him shudder against the solid body in front of him and grip tighter.
For the past two years, ever since his rivalry with Harry Potter blossomed into a relationship, he's never been a bottom. He's just not into it. Draco doesn't care if anyone else bottoms (he actually finds it insanely hot when his alpha boyfriend opens himself up for him), penetration on his end just isn't fun.
“Fine,” he replied. “Thank you for what you said. For…speaking on behalf of my family.”
Harry fell into his own bed soon afterward.
creep. And don't think I didn't see you eyeing me up."
"Ugh, Gryffindors." She looked down at her ring finger. "Your father and I have had a few issues. I wasn't ready to have a child and we got into a huge row about it. Even told him I was leaving, divorcing. Moved out to live with my disowned sister. She always seemed to have an answer."
"Don't be sorry, Harry. It's not your fault. It's not my fault either. All I can do is blame my father, and I will take great joy in doing so." He smiles wolfishly. "How do you feel about Daisyroot Draught?"
Draco laughed wetly. He went quiet and for a moment Sirius thought he had fallen asleep. Then he said softly, sleepily, "I care about you too."
Potter leaned back in the chair, arms over his chest defensively. “I bet you would, Princess Malfoy.” Draco froze at the nickname.
Self-hatred wasn’t fitting of a Malfoy, but cowardice was. He had half a mind to just ignore Potter and pretend to be focused on going to sleep. But that wouldn’t work forever. Eventually, Draco would have to make some sort of verbal contact with him.
Strangled groans woke Ron up from his light slumber. It takes only a moment for his eyes to adjust to the darkness and for him to remember where he is. His Gryffindor dorm room, a few days into their autumn term, surrounded by their his friends. He sits up a bit and throws open his crimson bed curtains.
"I'll bet you 20 quid you won't be able to get her number."
The potion was warmed by his hand, yet Tertius' hand felt warmer. Tertius smiled at the little glass vial and turned that smile towards Zygmunt.
Damn, the
The Room of Requirement has been used for emergency heat/rut rooms since the blockers were invented. Before those were around, it was just a full-time room for students to work through their heats or ruts. It was beneficial to have a room that can transform into whatever you require in that moment, especially because every omega and alpha had unique heats and ruts.
until it happened. And now he doesn't want it to stop. Classes will be over soon and these corridors will be filled with students trying to get to their next ones. A pair like them, in a position like this, will garner too much attention for either of them to enjoy.
Absolutely humiliating. And Potter read the whole thing.
Just when the stimulation started getting to be too much, she removed the vibrator and her fingers. With her fingers, wet with his cum, she rubbed his mound, nearly grazing his sensitive cock.
Maybe if Draco had noticed earlier how withdrawn he'd gotten in the past few months. Maybe if he was able to tell him to stop pouring over ancient magical texts on Dark magic. Maybe if Harry wasn't so bloody stubborn. Maybe if Draco was kinder. Maybe maybe maybe.
Harry stared at her. "What? Make magical sex toys?"
A loud sigh came from behind the fabric. “
And, okay, that was the nail in the coffin. He isn't usually competitive. But surely he's not so repulsive as to be unable to get a simple phone number, right? And 20 quid is 20 quid. It should be easy enough. He might not even have to pay for his drinks himself. It's tempting... too tempting.
seeker. He’s just not as good as the Savior of the Wizarding World, which was an unfair standard in general for him to compare himself to. Pansy would be at his neck if she knew he was quivering outside like a Hufflepuff first year. Maybe, this time, he deserved all of her nagging and whinging.
Draco smiled at him. "It does, doesn't it?"
“I don’t deserve what you’re doing for me.” Draco’s body was cold, but the area right underneath his eyes was warm. He wasn’t crying. “You’re the Savior of the Wizarding World and I’m… nothing.”

"Please, call me Harry."

Warnings: dub-con, mentions of HIV and STIs, self-sabotage
In his mind, swirling around and making a home there: bronze skin, thick shoulders, dark hair covering his chest and stomach and arms and legs, wild and unkempt raven-black hair. Usually tied in a low ponytail those days. Draco's hand pulling at it, watching his head fly back and his thick neck stretch, exposed.
"I was destined to die, many, many times," Harry reminds him. He's holding Draco's hands in tight fists and his hands are so cold. "I've risked my life to protect the entire Wizarding World. I will gladly risk it to give us the most precious thing in all the World. A life, Draco. A new life to cherish."
, or they could cause a mess of things. A literal and metaphorical approach to their relationship, really.
He went to the Ministry the next day. He made no appointment. Draco didn't think he'd need one. If Harry was actually an honest git, he would drop anything for this opportunity.
. He'd always loved when Blaise read his body language. Especially when it came to sex. The idea of someone knowing him so intimately made him instantly hard. For the longest time, Harry was convinced nobody would ever want to be with him that way. He'd watched enough of Vernon's favorite shows and Petunia's tabloid shows to know that trans people were not desirable. Even though nobody at Hogwarts really knew he was trans, he didn't want to tempt fate by trying a relationship. (And there was the whole Voldemort, Savior of the Wizarding World thing going on.)
Granger looked ecstatic. “I’ve never heard of that book.”
"Spit it out," he said and
And he hasn't come to this conclusion all by himself; he tried to be a "good omega" and bottom for his boyfriend. Draco thought that's what Harry wanted from him. Back when they were both nervous fifteen-year-olds with no experience other than some handy adult magazines and, in Harry's case, Ron's older brothers giving him the birds and the bees.
Where he lost his wand, his mother stood. Still in her dressing gown with her bi-colored hair pinned up in rollers. Wearing the satin slippers Draco got her for her birthday last year. Holding his wand in her hand. Her expression was a mix of anger and concern.
"Remarkable," Albus sighs. This feat of magic is great. Does it reflect whoever or whatever is on the mind of those who look upon it? Atop the actual mirror, on the frame, is an inscription:
"Fantastic," Harry whispered back and pressed his lips against Draco's.
to stutter like a second year talking to his crush? Is the mere fact that he has the hots for a Weasley not punishment enough?
, he mused.
“I believe it was his family that donated the most to the reconstruction of Hogwarts,” Hermione said, glaring at her boyfriend. “He can’t be all that bad anymore. Remember, Bill lives in the same town as him, and he says he can’t even recognize him.”
Draco raised his eyebrows. "Do you actually mean that?"
"That is correct... And it's Harry. Not Potter, not Mr. Potter. Just Harry."
Blaise dropped the box on the bed and sat down. Harry followed up, sitting cross-legged in front of her. He placed his anxious hands in his lap. His eyes widened when it was finally opened.
Potter’s head shot up, his eyes wide. Before he could even ask, Draco heard it too: growling, the sound of heavy footfalls clear outside of the locker room. His heart hammered in his chest. Fuck, they were stupid for not immediately leaving once Draco was dressed.
Except... he can't tell if that's quite true. Draco would love to fuck Harry right now. Not even take his time with foreplay like he usually does. He just wants to stretch out Harry's hole into the shape of his cock.
Potter wiped his lips. “Merlin, Malfoy! You’re freezing!”
"Yes, Miss Granger," Professor Slughorn agrees with a gentle, if not slightly panicky, smile. "It can have some rather adverse effects on those who are particularly sensitive to some of the ingredients. It can provide a temporary high, hallucinations, and excessive thirst. Usually those symptoms fade after time away from the potion..."
"I'm Harry Potter." He held out his arm, hand outstretched. "And I'm hoping you can forgive me."
"Please. Spare me the fawning."
Zygmunt was pacing the halls of Hogwarts. His robes swished all around him in a flurry that resembled his anxiety. The potion he had spent months refining was safely tucked away in a pouch tied around his waist. It was a warm spring afternoon and he was glad that he omitted his woolen jacket.
An olive branch, his mother had told him. She had made him promise not to bottle the experience up and leave it to rot in an unused cupboard. Extending an olive branch...
"Should I bind your body wholly, or just do what's necessary to keep you from interrupting?" James had a horrible habit of reaching down to touch himself while Teddy was busy teasing another part of him. "You tend to be rather squirmy, love."
He was staring at his clenching and unclenching fists and wasn't expecting when a large body collided with his.
"I suppose that'll make up for it," Draco concedes.
“Malfoy.”
him, but they were never close, not in the slightest.
“Please get some sleep, Harry.” She looked insistent. “You may think your glamours are top-notch, but I can still see the tiredness under your eyes. Please.”
Warnings: non-explicit child abuse, swearing, one-sided attraction, unrequited love
Fuck, it felt nice to talk to someone who understood. He forgot how fantastic his mother was. Narcissa never dismissed his emotions, no matter how ridiculous and dramatic he could get. His eyes stung with tears but he didn't feel ashamed to let them fall.
When their baby opens its eyes for the first time, Draco sees a brilliant marsh green.
Pansy had no choice in the matter. She wants to be forgiven. She doesn't want to be remembered as someone who hurt others, who's a villain, a parasite to everyone around her. So Hermione decided to extend some compassion, something she is excellent at.
Her voice rang in his ears like the Hogwarts Express horn. When he got close enough, she wrapped her arms around him and held him close even though he was probably getting her gown dirty and damp.
Now, though, he would have to go through that all over again with this new roommate. Slytherin or Hufflepuff would probably be the best possible outcomes for his roommate. A Slytherin would pretend not to care about him, which would hurt but he would learn to live with it, and a Hufflepuff would hold the value of tolerance over all others. He could potentially use his gender to force the Hufflepuff to tolerate him, even if they wouldn’t due to his past actions.
, Granger noticed. He met eyes with her and she smiled a little at him. Merlin, don’t tell him he was getting soft with the Gryffindors? The hostility, he hoped, was dying out but he didn’t know what to do with himself he felt entirely guilty about being even the slightest bit snarky with them.
"I'm sorry. You must know this already— your family name's been a staple in Magizoology circles for
Well, he might as well call and apologize for last night. He can't imagine it was the greatest situation for her to be in.
Draco frowned. These rooms wouldn’t be co-ed, would they? That would bring up a whole new set of problems…
Eventually, she removed the vibrator and turned it off. (That's just like her to turn off the sex toy in the middle of sex so it wouldn't waste her batteries.) She reached up to pull of her top and leaned back down. Harry was dead tired, tired enough that he hardly even thought about how embarrassing it was to be so open with his moans and whines and whimpers. He scratched down her bare back when she pushed fully into him, staying in that position as she spilled hot cum into him.
, not Hank— scowled at him. "Of course not. Don't be stupid." He flushed. "I knew you wouldn't talk to me if I just showed up at your shop and interrogated you. Someone in my department offered to give his image and Hermione recommended the name."
of him.
“I can’t help but be relieved, you know.” His words were muffled, barely intelligible.
Draco's sobbing, making ugly heaving noises. The thunder overwhelms it.
It all became too much. He shook his head and shut the laptop closed. Blaise would arrive any minute, anyway.
Harry didn't have any expectations when Blaise said
to render you harmless and still."
As the light leaves, so does Harry's strength. Draco can catch his heavy body in his arms moments before he hits the ground. The stench of blood and rain and soil is all around him and Draco refuses to look at the gaping hole in his chest. He will not acknowledge it. He stares at Harry's face for his final minutes. He tries to commit every age line earned from laughter, every scar and freckle, to memory. There's nobody else but him. There's never been anyone else in the entire world who can compare to him.
"Thank you! Okay, um." Papers rustle against each other. "I would just like you to confirm that you are a werewolf, born into a family of werewolves?"
"Good boy," they murmured in his ear. "You did so well for me, love. Absolutely magnificent. So proud of you, James."
"Was it worth getting your sick fantasies about fucking your straight, dead best friend sucked out of you by dementors in Azkaban?"
was in that diary?
The room itself isn't as dark as it was when he fell asleep. It must be close to morning. Ron looks around at each of his friends' beds. (He's the only one who keeps his curtains closed— too many experiences being pranked by Fred and George to trust his roommates entirely.)
The different colored sparks die away. Teddy grinned down at the naked body of their lover. The incantations were a nice audible and visual message that James may be getting close to his limit. The last thing Teddy wanted to was push James beyond his abilities and hurt him.
This one was fun to write! I really love hurting poor Draco, don't I? Except this time it's consensual! Yay! The next few fics are all gonna be cross-generation ships I believe hahahaha
This one is far brighter than yesterday! Also I realized I made it a bit vague what Draco's gender is. It wasn't until I finished that I realized you could read Draco as being trans or not because Harry views them as an androgynous beauty, so I use they/them pronouns to describe Draco.
," Harry whispers. His eyes are wide now. In disbelief? He doesn't look like he hates Ron...
“I wasn’t going to say anything, Draco.”
Albus feels his face burn. Does this mirror believe he... desires Gellert? But no, that can't be. He's so obnoxious and he's sixteen and, above all, he sees Albus as a teacher, a mentor. It would be beyond inappropriate for him to think this way.
James had his mouth against Sirius head, biting at his earlobe as he languidly rolled his cock against Sirius'.
Harry had the grace to look ashamed of himself, at least. It was the least he could do while Draco was sitting on his bed, crying and regretting every word. This could be his only opportunity and there he was; self sabotaging like the coward he used to be and always will be. Why did he think this would be any different?
"Oh, darling. How ghastly."
"Of course, love. "Teddy pulled on the ropes, jerking James' body around a bit. "Have to do something to reward good behavior, don't I?"
Charlie rolls up his sleeves, exposing hairy arms full of just as many freckles as his face.
Warnings: unintentional exhibitionism?
Draco could conjure up the most disgusted expression he wanted, but the round, dilated pupils at the mental image couldn't hide his feelings. Or the subtle way he arched himself more into Sirius' hips. He was like a bitch in heat, desperate to be fucked.
“Fine,” he responded. After the war had ended, it took months for the world to get itself together again. For the first three weeks of break, he was living with the Weasley family in their home. He thought it wouldn’t be any different than when he stayed with them for the previous summers, but he was wrong. They were in mourning; Molly would walk around like a ghost, and then he’d hear her sobbing at night, George would leave the Burrow late at night and not come back until the next afternoon, looking exhausted and covered in dirt. Ginny couldn’t look at him. The first time she initiated anything with him, she had to stop, saying, “I can’t get the image of you being dead out of my mind.” She said she didn’t like being the girl left at home, waiting to see if he’d come back to her or if she’d be hearing about his death in the news.
A beam of light shines on them as the door opens.

“What? Are you embarrassed or something?” He scoffed. “I would’ve loved to be fawned over by the general public like you are.”
Pairing: Dean Thomas/Seamus Finnigan
"Oh like you can talk," Harry says and Draco can hear his smile.
"So..." Harry sounded amused. That couldn't be good. "The giant squid, huh?"
“Oh,” Harry whispered, then wanted to kick himself. He knew somewhere that this was really important and he was racking his brain looking for any memories that could define what that meant. He passively remembered a day when he was about twelve when his Aunt Petunia was scoffing at a news program wherein the person being interviewed had a… sex change, he remembered they said. About a man who turned into a woman. His Uncle Vernon called them a “tranny.”
"Because it shouldn't have happened. I can't lose you."
They've been married for ten years. Friends have come and gone with time. Hermione and Ron were the first of their friend circle to have children. Bundles of joy with red cheeks and drool and shrieking cries and infectious giggles.
Draco listened, hands reaching up to run across the neat scars on his chest. He wondered what Potter would say if he saw them. Not daring to look further down than his chest, he idly wondered if Potter would scream and run to tell his friends if he found out exactly who he was talking to. What kind of person he was talking to. Guilt gnawed in Draco’s stomach; he felt like he was dirtying something that was perfect. Potter was so good and Draco didn’t feel that he deserved any piece of that goodness.
Sirius beamed. "Oh. I see now. You want to be fucked by a doggy cock, is that it dear cousin? I can do that for you. Breed you and make you put out the perfect inbred babies our family loves so much."
that were the case. It would've been preferable to this odd game of flirting they've been playing since they became Auror partners. Even Hermione, who was the one to placate Ron's impatience at Harry's stalling, was beginning to think it was all being dragged on.
"They're not supposed to be romantic, Potter. They're supposed to be honest."
"We have about twenty minutes left until we get to Hogwarts," Harry tells him as Draco cleans himself up as best he can with the tried-and-true way. (With a clean pair of underwear from his trunk. It's not the best, but not the worst.)
Something about the way Draco was glaring at the stone floor beneath them, Harry didn’t think mentioning that would be an appropriate response. He cleared his throat, testing the waters.
Ron and Hermione were staring at him when he focused his attention back to the table. They both wore the same expression. Worried and desperate to see if he was going to be okay. To be honest, Harry was kind of sick of seeing that expression.
, Albus muses and thrusts two fingers inside himself. He struggles to keep in his moans and whimpers, but Gellert isn't having any issues.
And... it was a little anticlimactic. Just a few dildos, a masturbation sleeve, different flavored lube, and some nipple clamps. There was a vibrator, so that answered his earlier questions. He didn't know what he was expecting. They were sex toys. Blaise said "sex toys" not "magical sex toys." He didn't know why he seemed disappointed.
"Yes please." Blaise sounded so quiet, so unsure of herself. Like she was hoping he wouldn't hear her and they would just go to bed. Well, tough luck, because Harry heard her.
Albus lies back on the floor. It cools him down from his post-arousal state and he can't see the mirror from this position. He can stay here for just a little while longer. Just enough to clean up and steel himself for tomorrow. To prepare to look right at Gellert's face and lie through his teeth when the younger asks him what he was doing last night.
Harry doesn't want to go bother her. But now all of his friends are looking at him expectantly.
Harry wants to thrust his fist in the air in celebration. He shouts, "We're down here! I think it's a basement?"

"Damn. I never even thought of that one."
"You can talk to me, you know." Hank looked up at him. Draco cleared his throat and looked at his dessert. "If you're anxious about... it. That's alright. I'm not expecting anything from you. We can just hang out at my place. Or we can just go our separate ways!"
For the first time since Harry dragged him out into this storm, Harry looks regretful.
Harry blinks back out of focus as Slughorn adds this information to his lesson. His face feels hot after crying like that in front of his entire class. Gryffindors
Malfoy clenches his jaw, eyes narrowing. Then, he says, "Fresh ink. Metal. Holly flowers." He doesn't look away from his feet. "And you?"
"Of course you did, pervert. It's obvious. I think nearly everybody on our floor thinks we're already hooking up or secretly married."
Then it hit all at once. A curious dream that ended with his pajama pants sticky and warm. Involving the resident cephalopod in the Hogwarts Lake rubbing its thick tentacles all over Draco's intimate bits. A detailed, yet ashamed, account of the dream in the hopes that he would analyze it at a later time and figure out why he was such a degenerate.
A thought struck him. “Do you celebrate Christmas, Malfoy?”
"Courting duels?"
"Does Potter really have a tattoo?" Draco's face was tinged pink as he asked.
I had a whole different idea in mind for this prompt but it ended up blowing up in my face. I decided to redirect the focus because I kept getting distracted. But this takes place in sixth year so I knew it was going to be a little angsty.
The man frowned, then his eyes sparked in recognition. "Oh, Draco Malfoy. So Harry told you, yeah?" He looked around sheepishly. "Look, I told him it was a bad idea. He was convinced you would hate him otherwise and he wanted you to get to know him for his personality and not who you think he is."
is such a rare potion ingredient that we have been working with Potioneers to see if we can figure out a way to make werewolf hair work. This could really revolutionize the roles of werewolves in society and change how most non-lycanthropes see you."
It was as if the weather was preparing for the upcoming holidays. Samhain was in just a few weeks. Draco was still surprised he’d survived coming back to Hogwarts again for over a month; he was certain he’d get cursed, expelled, or his mother would just sneak him back home one night while everyone else was asleep. He wouldn’t put it past her. She would probably be sending him a package filled with sweets and tokens of Samhain, as well as an enticing letter pleading for him to quit. Maybe not in so many terms, but Draco knows how to read between the lines.
The windows at Hogwarts are huge, tall things that somehow manage to let in just the right amount of sunlight without heating up the corridors too much. And with those windows are equally large and wide windowsills. They're more like benches than windowsills, honestly. The first windowsill he sees when he exits the dungeons is the one he decides to sit down on.
He wondered what Blaise would say if he knew that he was nude in the same room as Potter, all alone. Probably threaten the Gryffindor about treating him right, while joking that Draco is a first-class whore who deserves respect.
"Since then I've been placed under every potion and spell known to man and interrogated by more Aurors than I've ever seen before. Is there a right way to feel about all this?"
Harry reaches his hand up and touches Draco's cheek. Draco grasps his wrist to hold it there for him. "You'll always have me. This is the greatest gift I could possibly give you, my love."
Harry flushed and looked down. “It wasn’t just me. He leaned in too…” He ignored Ron’s gagging noises. “I just don’t understand why he did it in the first place. What’s he trying to get? I had just given him back his wand.”
"Harry—"
"Wha—" Draco twists around as best he could to glare at Harry. "You called for help? Whatever happened to
Well, he is alone in this classroom. And it's late so it isn't like many people are even awake right now. He could indulge in a little fantasy, right? It's hard to say no when Gellert is licking his bottom lip and slowly pushing his trousers down his hips. Albus removes his own robes and trousers then sits on the cold stone floor. The chill reaches his bottom through his thin underwear.
Harry reminds her of James. And of Regulus, sadly enough.
Potter's office was on the third floor. Room 18. The man who was not Hank Allen stopped and put his hands on his hips.

much more sensitive to oncoming stimulation.
“You know that I like you, right?”
The first few jinxes always took a while for James to recover from but when they got into a rhythm, it felt like second nature. Teddy never stung him in the same place twice and was always looking into James' eyes before stinging him again. Just in case he was too weak or rattled to speak their safe word, Teddy could read his expressions and decide stop if they see the need for it.
Hank's face was flushed and he avoided looking directly at Draco's face. Draco swallowed around a lump in his throat. The arm filled with more magic than Albus Dumbledore himself was still so close.
"Oh, of course. Can't have a normal time going on dates, getting to know each other, meeting each other's parents. That's barbaric."
He watched Tertius' backside as the lad bounded away from him cheerfully, vial in hand. Zygmunt lowered his head again and regretfully stood up.  He supposed he was going back home to his mother this weekend and have to endure her taunts about not making it into the Wizarding Schools Potions Championship. Wouldn't be too far off from the usual jeering. It'd probably sting a bit more, since it happened so recently, but he'd live with it.
"Hard to avoid," she said, glaring back at him. "I'm a bit stuck here and it's not as if anybody thought to paint a pair of earmuffs with me."
"You're welcome for providing such ample entertainment," he sneered. Then he felt like a child again. Then he remembered that Potter read his diary from when he really was a child.
He raises his hand and asks if he could be excused to get away from the Amortentia. Slughorn responds with an apologetic yes, so Harry rushes out of the classroom with his book bag in hand. The front of his trousers felt a bit tight from the earlier daydream. Luckily their school robes were well-equipped to hide embarrassing things like this.
A flicker of a smile appeared on Draco's face. His face was the same color as his pale pink paisley scarf. "You won't have any trouble with that," he whispered and leaned in to press his lips against Harry's.
Ron scowled at one, making an obscenely rude gesture.
"Okay, then. Um, if you wouldn't mind just getting me the records for sold potions in the last... seven months? I'll be out of your hair," he laughed as he said this.
Dean hummed, setting the book aside and holding Seamus' hands. "Hmm, let's make it gay. If you were the man—"
Pairing: Harry Potter/Draco Malfoy
Narcissa noticed his new and unusual behavior, of course.
“Nice to meet you, Draco Malfoy. My name’s Potter. Harry Potter.”
Draco heaves a heavy sigh. In the distance, Harry can hear a door opening and multiple footsteps rushing through the house.
“I bet,” Harry whispered. He looked back on all of his memories of Draco. Always flanked by a posse, a spitting image of his father. Wondered how much of that he did because he was transgender. Harry couldn’t lie to himself; he really had no idea what the consisted of. But he was nothing if not determined and he really wanted this…. whatever they had to work out. “It’s getting pretty late.”
Zygmunt pulled away from the touch and slid down the stone wall until his bum hit the floor. If he stretched his bare legs, they would touch the patch of sunlight stretching into the corridor, but he didn't want to feel warm. He curled up his legs to his chest, pulling out the vial of molten gold liquid.
The boy nodded. He leaned his head on Sirius' chest, hearing his heartbeat thunder in his ear.
Merlin, that filthy mouth. Harry was
"Oh, who cares. It's only us in here."
Nonbinary Teddy Lupin has a special place in my heart <3 In this fic they have a penis, but I had a lot of fun imagining how much being a metamorphmagus must rule (Here's to hoping my writing add-on didn't auto-correct their pronouns 🤞)
Draco’s hands were shaking so he shoved them in the pockets of his robes. There was no reason why he shouldn’t be able to, at the very least, try out for the new Quidditch team. He was a Malfoy, for Merlin’s sake. What would his ancestors say if they saw him now? (They’d probably be screaming at him for disloyalty and being a disgrace to the family name.)
He left the door open, so Draco could see when he officially exited the apartment.
(They were smart though and it wasn’t as if he was close with any of them. He couldn’t imagine anyone choosing to go against the grain and just accepting him. Especially because of all the chaos he forced upon them in their seventh year.)
"What's the point of going through these old tomes?"
, he thought bitterly.
He looked at Harry, who was blushing. Harry could blush at the drop of a pin. Draco loved it.
"And what say you to scheduling a night out after you've recovered?"
," Teddy added, pushing James' bound hands above his head. His body was strong and thick, hair covering every inch of freckled skin. "But I think you want to see me, love. I think you want to see my face when I finally push into you, is that right?"

His pajamas were less ripped than he thought they were, in his blind panic, but they were stained with green and brown from the grass and dirt. They were damp on his skin but he pulled them on. His underwear was not salvageable, but he didn't think anyone would really notice. He limped as he walked back to the garden.
"Really? That's fascinating..." He trailed off. "Do... Do you think I could borrow a bit of that?"
And, of course, helping look after Ariana.
. Instead, she was just called to the Headmistress' office and explained why she wouldn't be given any of those roles.
Harry pops his head in the office with a wide grin. Narcissa eyes him warily; a grin like that can only mean trouble, in her experience. James was a few years younger than her when they were at Hogwarts but he made a lasting impression on her. With his and his friends' juvenile pranks and taunting and James' obsession with that muggleborn girl. She wasn't surprised her cousin got swept up with them when he was sorted into Gryffindor.
"— so I'm mostly hoping to compare their accounts with yours. I think we'll start with the monthly cycles. For most werewolves, it only lasts for as long as the moon is out and the adverse effects of the transformation can be prevented with the use of Wolfsbane potion. How do your full moons go?"
He sighed deeply, removing his robes and then his jumper. His back was to Potter. If he could avoid contact, he would. Next came his shirt. There was a strange air of intimacy in the room that made his stomach constrict. What was so different about tonight? The silky-smooth fabric of his pajamas was comforting, and it calmed him down as he moved on to his trousers. Nobody in the past had any qualms about his crotch, because no boy his age would be caught dead staring at another boy’s crotch like that without being afraid of being labeled a creep. Or a poof.
Pairing: Harry Potter/Draco Malfoy
Romania in the dead of January is cold. Very cold, in Draco's humble opinion. -6°C. That was way too cold. Why anyone would want to live here is beyond him.
It wasn't really a question. James wouldn't really answer, they knew this. There must've been a push of concern in their words, though, because James nodded seriously and said, "
"Well... I want things to be better for us. And I am pretty fucked up on healing potions. I, uh, also respect what you're doing."
His back was pressed against the wall a few feet away from the kitchen door. It was cool against his back. Long pale hands bracketed his head.
And the game continued on. Ginny asked Dean next, who picked dare and had to prank call his mother. Blaise took the truth option when Dean asked him, confessing to not having sex until he was eighteen, despite popular beliefs that he was some sort of sex symbol in school.
He imagines going up to Malfoy, catching him scheming when he goes and disappears some nights. This time, Harry would be the one to tackle him against one of Hogwarts' solid stone walls. The corridor would be abandoned, so late at night. It would be just the two of them. Malfoy would gasp when he hit the wall, his pink bottom lip hanging open slightly.
, Harry thought.
"Take off your pants," he growls into Harry. The other eagerly obliges.
"Fuck," Hermione gasps desperately. She moves a hand to rest against Pansy's nape, pulling her mouth away from her sensitive nipples. "Do we have enough time to get you off?"
"Ron, is this real?" He asks, his voice rough and sweet from sleep.
And a few moments later, just that happened. Draco slipped the top over his head and suppressed gagging. He ignored the chuckles he heard from the other side of the curtain and put on the shorts. Wearing it made him feel like he needed to be disinfected. At least he didn’t need magical clothing to make his chest flat anymore; he couldn’t imagine having that taken from him and being exposed in that way.
"What did you smell?" Harry asks when Draco doesn't continue. "When you were around the potion."
With great effort, Draco sat up. On his knees because his bottom stung too much for him to move it a whole lot. How was he supposed to get home like this? What was he supposed to say? There was deep bruising on his wrists and ankles and chest where the vines were holding him up. His cock was rubbed raw and he could only imagine how he looked behind.
"The arsehole beat us unconscious and then fed us sleeping potion just for shits and giggles, huh?" Draco says bitterly.
"That's awful, mate," he said, not sounding upset at all. "The Headmaster's off his rocker. What were you planning on submitting anyway?"
His mother was confused at first, a little heartbroken that her only daughter is now her only son, but she never turned her back on him. Draco’s father was ecstatic to have a son in the family, though he wasn’t assigned male at birth. His father told him of potions and spells he could use to continue on the family bloodline with his future wife. What nonsense that was. Not only did his Healer say that the mix of the fertility potions along with his steady supply of masculinization potions would be a dangerous concoction, but Draco wasn’t the slightest bit interested in women.
Anxiety clouded his mind when he thought of going back to the manor. How was he supposed to walk those halls, knowing of the stains of curses that took lives were embedded in the very floor and walls? How was he supposed to enter his bedroom, a childhood bedroom, that’s been raided and threatened and then treated like a crime scene? His mother may be willing to embrace the past, but he didn’t know if he could face that properly.
, he thought to himself.
The bell above the shop door jingled and he placed the inventory list down. Tied the apron (a part of his uniform, not something he would wear on his own) by his waist and left the back room.
Harry Potter. Who is also quite a handsome young man, mind you. Harry doesn't really live with him, but he visits often enough that he might as well move in. Draco always gets a look on his face when she brings it up though, so she's learned to judge from afar.
"Good thing I called for help before I left."
“No.” The word cut harshly into his voice. Draco looked up at him and his lips were twisted into a hard, unyielding line. Then it smoothed over a little into something a little more neutral. “No, I would not want that. I was not always treated as male, and the idea of somebody now referring to me by those pronouns makes me feel… upset, to say the least.”
"Well, what do you want to do?"
Harry shushed him. “He’s right there. He can probably hear you.”
Even on the way back to the eighth year dormitories, they were quiet. Potter looked to be in deep concentration and Draco wouldn’t be the one to stop that. Merlin knows it wasn’t a common occurrence.
"You do deserve to be loved, Draco." She looked like she was about to cry with him. "I eventually went back to the Manor. Lucius was a wreck without me, of course. I didn't tell him I was at my sister's house, but I did tell him about the advice she gave me. She gave me an olive branch to give to my husband and end the argument. And it did."
at each other. Surely Harry's co-workers were weirded out by their little display, but Draco truly didn't know how to progress. He didn't plan for this. He thought he would be the one to slam open Potter's office door. He wanted to make a statement and strut up to his desk. He wanted to lean over his paperwork, show that he was more important than
“Well, get on with it, Potter!”
For a moment, he allows himself to breathe. He reaches behind and prods a bit at his hole. He's so wet. He didn't know he
Harry smiled at her. How many other people noticed his lack of sleep? Had Malfoy noticed? Merlin, how embarrassing.
"I know," Hermione replies. "Before the school year ends, we should tell them."
Hermione decided to forgive her. It was a difficult decision and she was definitely influenced by the knowledge that Pansy was in fact a human being and not a stone archetype of Slytherin malice.
Coming from a primary school in which Catholicism was just as important as maths, it was strange imagining a world in which people grow up not knowing who Jesus Christ is. Ron and his family had at least heard of him, but that was only due to Arthur Weasley’s love of Muggle traditions and objects. It’s why his family celebrates Christmas, Ron told him.
"You have neighbors?"
Not a bad older, either. Malfoy’s jaw had sharpened and he looked stronger. Despite all of the glares or grimaces he received from the students around him, there was an air of confidence surrounding him that made Harry’s stomach twist.
Draco swallowed the thick emotion coming up his throat. He grabbed Harry's hand and pulled the man up against his chest, burying his head into his shoulder. Inhaled the smell that clung to some of his clothes that he missed so much.
"Okay, since you had the most complaints," Seamus said with a grin. "Malfoy: truth or dare?"
and wipes away the thick layer of dust on the surface until he can see his reflection. He smiles at himself. A flash of blond hair and pale skin catches the corner of his eye. Albus whips around to confront the student (his mentee?) but finds that nobody is there. Some sort of specter?
And fuck, how could he not? "Not everything's about you," he said. "Yes," he whispered.
He kissed the spot where it began to curve to the right. Then he rested his forehead against Harry's and let his gaze slide throughout whatever parts of the room he could see. A flash of bright orange caught his eye.
Draco didn’t say anything in response to that, but he walked forward and let himself fall face-first next to Harry in the bed. (Which really wasn’t meant to hold two people, or at least in a comfortable way.) He must’ve freshened up in the bathroom because he smelled like that expensive shampoo. He flipped again onto his side so that he could watch him.
Seamus was sporting a wide, toothy grin. "Oh yeah. My mum's talked in length about this. Says that's the one thing she regrets about marrying a Muggle; there's no way she can be a part of these duels."

stretched thin, certainly.) He looked at Tertius, who smiled back even more, then at the Headmaster.
Draco was right, like Harry thought he'd be, and they broke into the house. It was seemingly empty and neither of them noticed the presence of one of the members, watching them in the darkness.
"I do too. I'm sorry I never considered your family pressures."
Draco lifted his head to look at him. Now he was curious. Obviously, he was pleased that his private healer’s human transfiguration showed. He’d been previously insecure that it would be too pronounced, but Blaise and Pansy assured him it was a subtle enough change. “Hm?”
Blaise huffed in laughter. "No, Harry. You can come whenever you like. I can't guarantee I'll stop though, after you've come."
paperwork, and demand they talk about what happened. But he supposed fantasies didn't always become reality.
"Oh my gosh, you're so obnoxious."
He pulled out, noticing the small existence of pink on his prick. Trace amounts of blood were to be expected after something like this. Sirius gently pushed one of his hips and noticed the other hadn't come yet.
"Then I'll leave. Honestly. I'm not here to harass you while you're recovering from your injuries."
Blaise stroked her cock a few times before meeting the tip to Harry's hole and pushing inside. The groan they simultaneously made should've been illegal, Harry decided. He was glad to know he wasn't the only one craving this. That was the only downside about not living together; they don't spend as much time together with their schedules so they forego sex in order just to hang out.
Draco cried out in pain, his back heaving with sobs. Yet he was arching his hips upward to meet Sirius on every painful thrust.
wear it.
"Martin Bridgers," Harry said. He shook his head a little. "I should've listened to him sooner."
“Well, I’d hope so…”
"Nobody can help me," Draco admits. He sounds so mirthless, but he still laughs as he says this.
"I don't want you to see me differently..." Draco mutters. He doesn't know how he'll cope if his boyfriend of two years decides to treat him like shitty alphas treat omegas just because he had his heat. "After this is over, I still want to fuck you."
Her son writes letters diligently, tying them to the necks of potion bottles, wraps them up in a parcel, and then sends them off by owl to the customer. Over and over he does this. Or he works at his potions set making the products.

Just as he suspects that the night will pass just as smoothly as they used to, Harry begins tossing and turning again. His forehead is damp with sweat. Ron moves to stand beside Harry's bed. He's trying to figure out the best way to get in bed with him while not disturbing his restless sleep.
He bit his nails so far down they stung. It was a disgusting habit his poor mother tried to break him out of, but failed to keep up with when he finally when to school.
After that night came anger. Draco was in the right this time; he wasn't the one to fuck everything up. None of this would've happened if Potter minded his own damn business and left Draco alone. Like he had been doing for the past eight years.
Harry followed his staring and giggled. (He

bad."
Draco set up two mugs and then got a pot on the stove. Household spells came naturally to him, having been surrounded by them all his life. His mother used to grow frustrated when he constantly asked her for things until she taught him the spells herself. It was so much simpler using magic. All he had to do was utter a small incantation, and the ingredients figured themselves out. Usually, he would use his wand to stir the hot chocolate, but he supposed a wooden spoon would do the trick.
It got so bad he began feeling more comfortable sleeping on the tiny sofa in his office.
Harry sighed and sat on the corner of his desk, hanging his head low. It was truly a pathetic sight. Draco thought he'd feel good, powerful even, looking at a scene like this. But he just felt hurt and distant. And wanting. He wanted to close the distance. He needed to extend the olive branch.
"Harry?"
Harry says a lot of things over the roar. Draco's afraid he won't be able to bear witness; he's crying so hard that the world in front of him is a blur.
And why shouldn't he say yes? "I have no use for it anymore," he reasoned. "Blasted Headmaster thinks I'm too much of a child to enter the competition. Might as well give it to someone who actually wants my potions."
He smiled back at her. It felt like the most genuine one in a while. Harry always had a soft spot for Luna, from the moment they met. At first, it may have been out of pity but by now he knows it’s definitely grown into a real friendship.
A break of squeaky, high-pitched cries destroy the relative silence. It's coming from the cauldron. Draco doesn't want to let go of Harry, but he must. The guilt would consume him if he were to neglect the life Harry sacrificed himself for.

Harry reeled. "
He flipped onto his back when he heard the door open again. Malfoy— or should he call him Draco now? Their relationship has changed, hasn’t it? Draco looked more relaxed now that he was out of those nasty clothes. But his face betrayed some of that contentment.
Days leading to the full moon always filled Remus with uncharacteristic aggression. Specifically sexual aggression. Which Sirius loved to capitalize on by adding James into the mix, fueling the wolf-like possessiveness up to max levels. Not enough to hurt James, of course, but enough to make Sirius' hips sore for hours.
Potter laughed, and he felt his chest ache. Oh, if only Blaise could see him now. He’d surely be laughing at his misfortunes. Laughing, while providing no help whatsoever. Draco offered a small smile, and both of them walked off toward the kitchens.
After his initial astonishment, he's quiet for the rest of the drive. So Draco fills the silence with his complaining as he tries to get the radio to work. The signal is too bad from the heavy snow for him to get any semblance of music.
"Harry Potter," he breathed more than spoke. His lower lip trembled. "So what was all this then? A funny little inside joke between you and your Auror buddies? Had to forget about it when you realized you might actually have to fuck a Death Eater? Or worse, be fucked by a Death Eater?"
Warnings: fantasies about an underage character
Harry's face looks naked without his glasses. Bare, transparent, vulnerable. His hair is flipped up and Ron can see his fabled scar clearly, even in the dark dormitory room. Ron ignores the squirming his stomach's doing inside his body and pulls up the duvet.
Harry's eyes are narrowed and Ron wonders if he can convince him this is just a sleepy hallucination. But then he opens his mouth.
And by the time the plant had its fill, the sun was beginning to rise. Draco's mind felt foggy, as if had just woken up from a deep sleep. His body felt sore and ache. The vines were able to wring four orgasms out of him, the last two completely dry. His prick hurt so bad he never wanted to touch himself again.

He was still staring deep into the blur of reds and oranges and yellows when he felt the tip of someone’s shoe tapping his shin. Hermione was looking at him with a fretful gleam in her dark brown eyes as he raised his head in the direction of the tapping. In a way, he missed seeing that gleam. It held less pity for the person he’s become, and more about the trouble he was thinking up in his mind.

Draco Malfoy was in a room with him. Draco rolled his eyes and went back to putting away his clothes.
Malfoy’s wand was located in his trunk, hidden at the very bottom in a wand case he got handmade from Ollivander. It was a gift, he said while he gave Luna Lovegood her new wand. It called out for him. Harry often wondered why it was so easy for it to accept him as its wandmaster. When he asked, Ollivander just admitted that it was a very strange occurrence and left it at that.
He had similar broad shoulders. His ears stuck out a little more and his pseudo-military haircut made them stand out so much more. There was a blemish on that perfectly smooth, pale skin. But his hair was the same blackness. (Okay, maybe a little more brown than black, but it was curly and wild in a reminiscent way.)
The door to the study opened smoothly and Potter walked in. (No, floated in. Those Auror robes were too long, swinging well past his ankles.) His face was completely red up to the roots of his inky black hair.

"My apologies Mr. Allen. I am not qualified to take employee interviews. But I can take your information to send to Mr. Barnes so he can contact you and schedule for an interview."
"I need to talk to him. Let me see him." Then, because he was a manipulative arsehole, added, "It's the least you could do, considering your involvement in all of this."
Somehow, the pathetic situation isn't enough to deter him from using the mirror's image as masturbation material. It's when Gellert leans in to kiss his cheek, brow furrowed in concentration as he comes in spurts, that does it for Albus. He cries out and it's so quiet in the room that his needy voice echoes all around him.
"Yes. Sure. Let me just, um, get my bag." And, Circe, did he
Malfoy rolled his eyes. After great deliberation, he said, "Truth," as nonchalantly as he could. But Harry could see the tell-tale twitch of his fingers that betrayed his anxiety. He took a drink of the wine.
“—and I don’t want to hear it.” He sent Blaise a polite smile. “I
Everybody was staring at him. Some a little more surprised than others. Draco stood up and held out his hand. Harry took it on impulse, and found himself being dragged out of the living room. His head whirled but he hardly even drank.
But he nodded, albeit rolling his eyes at Ron’s statement. “I swear I’m okay. The ride was long and I am just exhausted from packing.”
The stares, Draco was expecting. The murmurs, he was expecting. There was nothing about the unwanted attention that he was surprised by. But he was surprised by the heaviness in his gut, the same feeling that plagued him all throughout first year. When he was desperate for his secret to be held safe, for absolutely nobody to find out that he wasn’t assigned male at birth.
. He was getting frustrated with himself. He wouldn't take it out on Narcissa.
His cock is hot against Draco's. His knot has even started forming. How cute. Draco wraps his hand around it firmly as Harry sits back down on his lap. Harry whines pathetically and Draco increases his grip a bit more. Just to make his mouth fall open and hear his panting. Draco's heat is no doubt pouting that he's not getting such a magnificent knot inside him. But his heat will just have to cope, alright?
Neither of them spoke for the rest of the time in which they finished their drinks. For a long while, Draco assumed that would be the end of it, and maybe the next day they’d pick the conversation back up and bicker some more. Now, he was quite glad Weasley wasn’t there. He’d probably disturb the silence by taking jabs at Draco that he couldn’t reciprocate.
Less handsy is Hermione. She tends to be too nervous to place her hands anywhere under her girlfriend's clothes, opting instead to rub and massage over her clothing when she can. Sometimes Pansy will remove her top with a mischievous glint in her eyes, letting Hermione know it's okay to touch her boobs. Like, really.
Warnings: light description of a corpse, underage mutual masturbation, not somnophilia but kinda veering on it I think?
He looked like he didn’t get enough sleep. Dark circles were under his eyes and he was slow in his movements. Now that he was thinking about it, Harry didn’t remember seeing him at breakfast or lunch. And despite the apparent hostility from some of the students, Malfoy didn’t ever refuse to show his face during mealtimes.
after he mentioned never buying any. He tried desperately not to expect anything. But... his mind wandered.
Three times the professor had to shoot a tame charm that zapped him to alertness because he kept on resting his head atop the desk. Each time he flinched harder. It wasn’t difficult to imagine what may have caused the reaction. Harry’s fists clenched underneath the table.
"I'll see you tomorrow night, Professor!" Albus calls out behind him as he leaves the Transfiguration classroom. He isn't a student, not anymore, so he walks through the corridors of Hogwarts with a sense of calm unknown to him. He's used to rushing from one classroom to the other, trying to stay on track with all of his extracurricular classes.
They stopped in the kitchen. It was a small room (cozy, Ginny called it). There was already the essence of the two women all over the place: Luna's strange-looking plant trimmings and messy notes on the windows, Ginny's knitting equipment and her newest project— a blanket with the logo of the Holyhead Harpies on it. The clear reminders of his friends helped ground him in the moment.
Sirius let himself grip James' shoulders, dipping his nails in. There was a bitterness to these times; he knew James wasn't actually into him, to him this was all just to let off steam and help Remus out. And Sirius was happy in his relationship with Remus. But... his schoolboy crush on James Potter couldn't be so easily squashed.
"Well, I imagine I'd just woo you. And you'd be so frozen from my charm that you would concede right then and there." He was grinning, they both were.
By the time that train of thought leaves, he realizes he took a wrong turn somewhere. He's in a corridor he's never seen before, with faded posters from classes long-gone. All of the doors are locked except one. With a thudding heart, Albus opens it, cringing at the creak of wood in the otherwise silent part of the castle.
It's all for nothing. Draco knows this. The cauldron is filled with smoke; tendrils of thick black peek out as if taunting him. He also knows what must come next. What the translated ancient text tells them must come next.
Ah, a date. Draco was glad Hank asked so he wouldn't have to humiliate himself and take the initiative. He smiled at him. (Not his customer service smile.)
"So cute," Blaise said when they finally separated. "I want to tie you up and make you scream."
Pairing: Queenie Goldstein/Vinda Rosier
But he wasn't a real victim. He was a disgusting pervert he liked to pretend to be a victim so he didn't have to face the fact that he loved getting fucked by Sirius.
His girlfriend had a mischievous smile. "Why not? Can't be that hard? Do you have any ideas for our first product?"
His mind trailed back to that sliver of pale stomach he saw earlier. How far did that paleness stretch? He shook his head sharply. What was he thinking? Even if the person in his fantasies wasn’t someone he’s held so much hostility for in the past, it was still wrong to distract himself with those fantasies instead of trying to help.
"I liked it when..." Ron trails off when Harry glances up at him. Fuck, he's so much harder to talk to when he doesn't have his glasses on. "I like it when you speak parseltongue."
The day before was rainy and his boots were sinking in the soft, pliable mud of the field. He’d heard over the summer of a muggle sport called football and watched on the tiny muggle television moving images of men slipping in mud while trying to kick the black and white checkered ball. Watching it made him feel even luckier to be a wizard. A rainy day at Hogwarts was almost ideal; the castle would make its candles and fireplaces warmer and entering the castle after spending the day outside felt like being wrapped up in a handmade woolen blanket and given a steaming mug of hot chocolate.
"Ah, yes, I remember. You kept casting shield charms when the Aurors would get close to you and that Muggle. Absolutely extraordinary. Is that a skill that shows up when you're a child, like with other magical children?"
But Blaise only transitioned after Hogwarts. She'd been with loads of people by the time she got with Harry. She taught Harry a lot about feeling sexy and comfortable in front of a partner. He learned a lot. Like the fact that he adored dirty talk.
This ship is underrated. Enough said.
Blaise pulled him up, indicating she was finished, and kissed him gently. He opened his mouth so they could breathe each other. Harry knew they'd regret falling asleep like this soon. They were too sticky and sweaty to be fully comfortable, but he didn't want to move quite yet. She didn't want to move quite yet. Holding Blaise in his arms, filled with her cum, feeling her play with his hair is exactly where he wanted to be.
Oh, fuck. "Um it is, yeah," Ron hesitantly responds. "I'm so sorry. Please don't hate me—"
No, he was not interested in fame. He would rather sit at his desk, alone (blissfully alone, without an echo of his mother's voice) and write his book— a potions instructional manual. The new Headmaster at Hogwarts had asked him to write a thing or two for new students and he couldn't turn down the opportunity. If he could inspire students to love the art of potion making the way he did, the writing was a small price to pay.
But this is a bit of a different situation. One that she's not ready for her best friend to know, let alone him
"You've been sleeping in here an awful lot," she said softly. She always spoke quite softly. "Are there pests in your bedroom?"
Their moans echo in the large heat room when Harry finally sinks down.
Draco turned to Ginny. "Truth or dare?" He asked.
Sirius removed his clothing first, took his hair out of its ponytail, and helped Draco out of the clothes left on his body. There was already a bruise forming on his thin wrists and chin. Not to mention the pink-purple color on his arse cheeks. Sirius made a mental note to perform a healing spell on him because of the blood from earlier. He must have torn a bit.
"We're going to have to tell our friends eventually," Draco says, while Harry is unprepared to brush it off and change the subject.
After, Draco ordered a tiramisu. Hank didn't get anything. He was wringing his hands again, looking as anxious as ever. Draco frowned. The date seemed to be going so well, too.
"Oh, hello," he said.
“Why did you save me from the Fiendfyre?”
he knew his eyes were widening and his hands gripped the eggshell pale button-up tightly. Was McGonagall pulling his leg? She must’ve mentioned something about (forced) inter-house unity before he entered the Great Hall. Pansy would be protesting outwardly if she was aware of this, but the little Blaise on his shoulder was giving him a sleazy expression.
He moved Seamus' arms to sit on his shoulders and then grabbed Seamus' waist. Then he swayed them both to the tune of ballroom music only inside his head. It was reminiscent of their dance at the Yule Ball, and made Dean's insides feel all fluttery again.
, Sirius mused, a grin tugging at his lips. An absolutely beautiful whore. Draco's back muscles were flexing and quivering. They tensed when he held the sofa cushion harder than before. It made Sirius a bit melancholy that he couldn't flip him over and see how his stomach muscles jumped. Fuck, he probably could've seen his dick poking around in his guts if he had flipped over. Next time, definitely.
Zygmunt was nearly done with this chapter of his book. He was exhausted with writing, but it was better than leaving his isolated home in the Hebrides for countless awful interviews. Every so-called journalist was dying to get their hands on the reclusive potions master who created a number of advantageous potions.
Now he felt weird about looking at Granger, after thinking about Harry’s friends knowing what his bits looked at. He looked back down at his essay for Arithmancy and tightened his hold on his boyfriend’s hand. There were eyes looking over his essay before he heard a soft gasp.
Harry hasn't moved. Outstretched are his arms, which look like they want to return the embrace. Draco wonders how he's holding it together.
“Yep. Time to go.”
“Why should it matter? He’s called me worse things.”
Beside her, obscured from his vision as he was sitting, is a blond androgynous person, with cheerful gray eyes and long, pale fingers. Oh god, Harry thinks. He doesn't want her, he wants to be with
It was dark in the room. A white expanse of moonlight swept over the young men's bare legs. Teddy placed their wand back on the table. James wrapped his freed arms around Teddy's waist and pulled them closer. They laughed when they felt James' scratchy beard tickle their neck.
Madam Pince surely wouldn’t allow that to happen, at least.
Ron scoffed, his elbow digging into Harry’s arm.
"Do you still feel that way?" Harry asked, and he was still so close. Draco could feel his warm breath on his cheek.
Draco casts a patronus, having to try four times to find a happy memory until it works.
"That sounds incredible," he whispered. He sounded like he was speaking in a dream.
When he found the records, he sniffed and stood upright again. Hank was admiring his shiny dress shoes and his face was still flushed deep red.
Draco was cold and uncomfortable. His skin filled with goosebumps as his bare skin made contact with the icy tiled floors. He wasn’t just going to stand up like some sort of lost House Elf. He picked off some dried dirt from his foot and sighed again.
"Um, this is the guy from last night. The one who asked for your number so I could win a bet. That was a really shitty thing to do, I'm calling to apologize."

"Yeah, you probably should've."
After her death, he inherited so much. Most of it was probably still at the Manor, left to be taken care of by employed house-elves to conserve as much as possible. One of the things she left for him was a magical portrait painted when she was twenty-six years old.
“Who’s Jesus? Is that a Muggle thing?”
, Harry wanted to be good. He felt hot and flushed from his head to his toes. Blaise removed her hand and sat up. She leaned over and grabbed something out of the box. A wand vibrator. Harry remembered she was tickled pink when she heard the name and impulsively bought the thing for 32 quid.
Warnings: none? I think? I'm pretty sure
“Let bygones be bygones.”
What a surprise it was to his mother and father when his face in the family portrait that hung in the main dining hall changed, some odd ten years ago. The long, wavy blond locks were cut like they had been sheared in the painting. And painting-Draco had ripped off his flowy, pale pink robes with all of its ruffles and lace to replace them with decidedly sophisticated, decidedly
Hermione tugged harder and he finally sat back down. His gaze didn’t leave Malfoy’s form, which had sat down at the very end of the table with the least amount of students and was subtly adding food to his plate. It took him a while to recognize that he was feeling surprised. He couldn’t remember the last time something had truly shocked him. Oh, a symbol of death is following him around? Sounds like a Tuesday. The weird creatures that infested the Weasley’s shed were asking for autographs? How many need a signature?
"That look on your face doesn't mean anything good," Harry says with a smile.
They could see the effect their words were having on him. Another full-body shiver like before, except that time James' toes curled and his hips flexed.
The Quidditch pitch was surprisingly quiet and made a good study spot. Occasionally, the first years would have their flying practices, but even that background noise was tolerable. And if he just hid near the bases of those tall, magnificent stands for the audience then he went unnoticed by everyone.
Neither of them could agree on the method of having a baby. Draco wanted to go more traditional, adoption and surrogacy. He insisted there would be bumps in the road but they'd be worth it. But Harry... Harry was convinced there was a way for them to create a child of their own. With just the two of them.
"You didn't check my medical charts before harassing me? You must be an amateur... my name is Draco Malfoy."
"Fuck yeah, that's right." James squirmed a little, his hips swiveling in an attempt to get Teddy's knee to touch him where he was hard and aching.
, look at his personal diary from when he was fourteen years old. And, of course, it wasn't like he could edit it before the Ministry snatched a hold of his childhood home and all of its objects, setting up a stasis on everything so it wouldn't be touched.
Potter jerked a little but didn’t pull away and Draco realized he hadn’t moved an inch since they started. Strong hands met his shoulders. To pull him closer or push him away, Draco didn’t know. Potter was doing something amazing with his mouth and he didn’t want to stop.
Even after that embarrassing mix up of Draco's, they scheduled another date. A lunch, that time. At another muggle place. One of Draco's suggestions; there was a diner he would visit in the early mornings when he was hungover. The staff knew him, but they didn't
His sleepy eyes open at the sound of Charlie sitting on one of the opposing armchairs. He's lighting the fireplace. That's when Draco notices them and now he's wide awake.
"Just did, love."
"Who would take me? Hogwarts is the closest school and they don't allow 'late bloomers.' And, not sure if you know this, but us wolves tend to be territorial. Moving to another country is out of the question."
Draco snorts and leaves his suitcase near the door, gravitating towards the plush sofa. He buries himself among the blankets and sighs. They warm him up to his very core. He brings his knees up to get them underneath the blanket as well. Draco could just curl up and fall asleep right then and there. He was exhausted.
Narcissa Malfoy is twenty-six years old and she won't be getting any older. She's been twenty-six for the past twenty years or so. It's been so long she's lost track of all the years. And time doesn't mean much to a painting, does it? All that changes are her surroundings and the people around her. Some of which she knows and others she never really met.
The mirror is back to normal when he looks back again. Just him, flushed and sweaty, with his hand in his sticky underwear. It's probably the quickest he's gotten off in ages.
Harry wondered too. Usually Draco was the one men were infatuated with, so it was surprising to see him on the other end.
wanting to kiss him all day. But that gnawing guilt kept getting in the way.
Hesitantly, he stood to his feet and opened the curtain. Potter was standing a few feet away. He looked handsome and Draco wanted to kiss him again. He’s
A flash of white then James was gasping and writhing in quiet agony. It only took a moment for his mind and body to remember the feeling of a stinging jinx, to remember how to recover, and he settled down. His chest was heaving and his mouth stretched into a lazy grin.
Slytherins. He moves his head almost unconsciously until his eyes meet striking gray ones.
"James and Lily's boy? The one you like?"
Harry rolled his eyes and pushed Draco's shoulder. Almost affectionately. "No, git. About
“Malfoy.”
him. It was an incredible juxtaposition to the food services in the Wizarding World who would spit in his food if they found out they had to serve it to the likes of him.
. A line in one of the ancient texts that gripped Draco's brain like a fog. A stroke of thunder and lightning deafened his cries once more. Harry promises him that he won't need to touch the dagger. That he's been cultivating, conserving, his magic to dig out his own heart. It's morbid and wrong and Draco never imagined magic would ever be used in such a way. Harry says he must bear witness.
"No, Budge." the Headmaster frowned deeply at him. "The answer is no. That contest is in
. Draco thought he was so full of himself; Draco was his only employee, where did he get the authoritative stick up his arse? "How may I help you?"
Potter looked at him intensely. “You seem a lot happier. I like how you look when you’re actually happy. You walk with more confidence than when you were that bratty eleven-year-old who thought you were the shit.”
Draco closed his eyes. “Severus told me the name once when I was in third year. Where my body doesn’t feel right to me.” He opened his eyes, looking like he wanted to hit something, but not looking anywhere near Harry. “I’m transgender.”
It was during one of these study sessions that he overheard Madame Hooch speaking to someone.
"Can I?" She asks with a voice so innocent it feels sinful that Hermione knows what exactly she's asking to do.
"Blaise!" Draco hissed, punching his (not-best) friend in the arm. He looked at Harry, in sympathy and curiosity.
Harry frowned. “Did your father…?”
Honestly, Hermione never thought someone could grow that much. She tends to reject the idea that terrible people can change. It's harder to get hurt when you assume you know what somebody thinks.
He heard the door creak closed, but his roommate didn’t walk any closer. Draco couldn’t help but feel judged.
“I’m fine,” he tried to placate their concerns. “It’s just… a lot, being back. Good, but also strange now that we’re not fighting for our lives.”
Despite Malfoy’s promise that they would talk about it in the morning, the boy was out of the room by the time he woke up. Seemed to be gone for a while too; even the smell of his posh soap was almost completely faded. Harry had cursed when he realized. The git was as sneaky as a snake when he wanted to be, and there was no doubt in his mind that he’d barely see Malfoy all day. The only time they’d be able to truly talk again was going to be during practice.
Cedric Diggory's body wasn't the first corpse he's ever seen in person. That honor would go to the pharaohs buried on his Egypt trip. But he's never seen a corpse look so... alive before. He's never seen people wailing and clutching one and grieving. It must've been worse for Harry; no, it was infinitely worse for Harry, if these nightmares are any indication.
Surely, Harry wouldn't notice if his cloak was missing for just a few hours. Would he? Hermione's lip aches from between her teeth as she pokes around one of her best friend's personal trunk. She tries her hardest to look past the pairs of underwear and socks. (Did Harry even keep the cloak in his trunk when he wasn't using it?)
"I know, but let's imagine. And I was the voluptuous damsel whose affection you needed to win. By means of violence, of course."
Draco extended his arm. "Hello. My name is Draco Malfoy. What do you say we start over?"
Using the velvet curtain, he cleans off the rest of the mirror. Gellert is standing right next to him, except he's not. His head is just an inch taller than his, like usual, except it's not. He's not truly there, just in the mirror.
He hardly notices the way his eyes well up in tears and the droplets spill over his cheeks. Harry sniffs and nods. Hermione's staring at him imploringly from his right. Ron is rubbing his shoulder, squeezing it every so often. He leans into the casual touch.
Come on, I wasn't
They didn’t speak about the Seeker position for the first two days, despite plenty of opportunities. They lived in the same room, for Merlin’s sake. They had two classes together and they had Quidditch practice for one hour every day after dinner. Yet neither brought up the issue with their positions nor did they have any other conversations.
Warnings: none! Just Luna admiring her girlfriend
Ron pays close attention to how Harry's mouth wraps around the unfamiliar language. The hisses and clicks he makes thrum in Ron's brain. His stomach is squirming again, but not from nerves. What is wrong with him? There has to be something deranged about him if he's here, becoming aroused from watching his best friend sleep talk during a nightmare.
He turned his head, hopefully casually, and met his eyes. Fuck. Potter looked like he was doing well, so much better than he was during his family’s trials. He’d put on weight, his shoulders had broadened more, there were sparse hairs on his chin that indicated possible growth of a beard. Draco couldn’t help but admire his masculinity. After being denied his own for so long, not to the fault of anyone around him, he realized he was feeling adequate next to Potter. It was unfamiliar.
Back in the mirror, Gellert is looking at him again with that damnable grin. His white button up shirt has the top few buttons undone, exposing even more of his pale flesh. Albus has some trouble swallowing.
Harry looked up and grinned shyly.
"That's quite enough!" She squawks from her spot on the wall. She hopes she's bot blushing, but it's normal for Blacks to go a brilliant crimson when they're embarrassed. All of her sisters and cousins were the same way, and her parents used to get all red when they had too much to drink. "Take this to your room!"
“Hello, Harry.” Luna looked at Ron and Hermione each and acknowledged them before looking back at Harry. “Have you heard the news?” Her hands were fidgeting with the folds on her skirt.
“So, you want to create… an eighth-year team? Any house, any student?”
At the moment, he was thinking of that.
Harry reaches around with his other hand to tug at Draco's cock. Who would've thought that five weeks of forced bonding time while they cleared out his family manor of Dark artifacts could become this? He feels the weight as Harry leans onto his back, licking up the sweat on the back of his neck.
The next night is the same. Ron doesn't even let himself go to sleep, this time. He knows he'll just need to wake again so there isn't any point trying to use his own bed.
It didn't take long for him to come, not at all. It was almost too soon. But, then again, Blaise was whispering in his ear all the different magical toys she would make specifically to use on him while he was being stimulated.
His fingers are so long and thin. Harry admires them for a moment. He wonders what lies beyond his wrist, etched into his forearm. The thought isn't pleasant. He swallows around the ache in his throat at those thoughts.
At least they're together. That's one upside.
He nodded at him, still looking dumbfounded like he couldn’t register that
Wringing his hands, a tall and dark-haired stranger was standing at the register. He eyed the more dangerous potions behind the desk nervously. Draco coughed gently in his fist. The stranger gasped, head spinning to the source of the cough.
It's still odd to her that Harry is head-over-heels for Draco, but she supposes she can't really judge. Considering she's got Pansy's cool hands sneaking under her sweater and caressing the skin of her stomach and sides.
“Where’d you get that?”
he was. With his other hand Sirius held both of the boy's wrists, square against the small of his back. A part of him hoped that the angle of his arms would give him a dull, aching pain.
. He didn't say anything.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck, looking a bit abashed. "Yeah. Thought so."
." Similar sparks of red danced around Teddy's head.
For a moment, it's like Harry's the one in heat. And hell if that doesn't arouse him even more. Draco sympathizes with his poor biology, who must be so confused at this point.
Even just being around some of their friends with their new toddlers who had grabby hands, having long hair was unadvised.
"What you saw..." Malfoy says, averting his eyes away from Harry.
The idea of being used like that is enough to push him over the edge again. True to her word, Blaise didn't remove the vibrator and instead leaned forward to kiss him deeply. Harry weaved his arms around her neck to keep her close while his hips twitched, trying to get away from the vibrator while also wanting to be filled with her cock.
Pairing: Draco Malfoy/Charlie Weasley
Its cries soften at the human contact. There's blood in its mouth from where its fangs punctured its forked tongue. Black sludge drips down its honey-blond hair.
It's getting rather ridiculous, Albus thinks. Though... he can't say the attention is entirely unwelcome. It's the most he's been given by anybody since his sister's accident. And Gellert has so much time on his hands after being expelled from Durmstrang Institute and unable to enter Hogwarts so late in the term.
Seamus shoved a thick book in his face, making him drop one he was holding. Then there was a downside: Seamus had the attention span of a flea.
. Sends him chocolates with little notes about “sharing with a loved one” or “giving to someone special.” Very subtle, mother.
Ginny held up a finger so she could sip her wine. Then she said, "He didn't when we were at Hogwarts. We have not been together in quite a while, so I am honestly unsure if has any tattoos nowadays."
As James came down from the roller coaster of emotions, Teddy grabbed their wand and cast, "
“What’s the news?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. It was becoming a familiar gesture to see, Harry being used to sneers and glares. “Yes, Potter. The
"Thank you, darling," James choked out, unprompted.
The only piece of furniture in the entire room is a flat, wide object standing up. It's covered with a black curtain. Albus lifts it and then resists the urge to smack himself on the forehead.
And Madame Hooch would have their heads on pikes if their drama interrupted her practice.
"— that my medical charts are all right here. Including my crazy werewolf blood and shit. I consent to you using them for your research."
'Them' being their friends. It's not as if Hermione doesn't trust her friends. She just... it's hard to...
After about thirty minutes of this, their game ended and they finally began studying altogether. Weasley grinned at his girlfriend and slid his essay over to her, asking her pleasantly to look over it for any errors. She narrowed her eyes but took it with a sigh.
Right on cure, the fireplace roared. Harry pushed the laptop aside and stood up as the tall, familiar figure passed through the floo. She was dressed in a way that made Harry's jaw drop. Tight white jeans with a silver chain hanging from the belt loops. Complimented nicely with his spiked black combat boots and black mesh top. Over everything, she wore a grey feathery jacket spotted black.
Harry squeezed his thighs together and Blaise's eyes darted down. She bit her lower lip, sliding her warm hand up his leg. He was so glad he was only wearing boxers when she arrived. Less to take off.
," Malfoy would gasp when they finally pull apart. The blond would grasp his wrist and pull his hand to his warm, hard crotch. With pleading eyes he'd refuse to break eye contact with Harry.
Potter ended up cornering him outside of a changing stall after Quidditch practice.
Twisting in his sheets, his limbs jerking wildly every so often, is Harry. The boy of Ron's childhood legends come to life. And he's not like Ron's younger self could've ever prepared for.
It takes a few embarrassing moments for Ron to realize he's asking to touch him. He nods eagerly, removing his hand and inching down his pajamas slightly. Harry bites his lip.
Teddy let their arm drop to their side, admiring the work they've done. On James' previously unblemished skin were red, swollen marks. Perfectly where the jinx hit him. Some of them were intercepted by other strikes of jinx, making beautiful Xs.
"Draco," Harry whispers, and he sounds just as affected as Draco is. And he isn't even experiencing a rut.
“You want me to what?” Harry was standing in front of Headmistress McGonagall’s desk. It was different than Dumbledore’s, made from rich redwood and swirled with marble on the tabletop. There was a cat bed on the corner of the desk, which made him smile a little.
"Mr. Potter, is everything alright?"
"I thought you wouldn't want to see me," Harry said, staring at his anxious hands. His fingers tumbled over each other and in between and were just plain
"Truth."
The women giggle in the darkness of the broom closet. The world is out there, waiting for them, but Hermione feels as if her whole world is right there with her.
Draco inhaled shakily. He was crying more than he had in years. "You never did forget. You always treated me so well. Like I deserved to be loved."
Potter looked away. “I didn’t think you cared about what other people think.”
There was another lapse of silence after Potter asked his last question and Draco had blown up at him. Why would Draco have any idea of what to do in this situation? Did Potter think he made this into a regular occasion?
It was hard to notice the box being pushed off his bed with Blaise's lips against his. She wasn't wearing any lip gloss, so the experience was a lot less sticky than usual. He slipped his tongue in her mouth as they moved further down the bed. Harry was nearly lying down and Blaise was on top of him. He rutted his hips up.
They lapsed into an exceedingly uncomfortable silence. Draco was imagining the other Aurors making a mess of his bedroom and of his, oh Merlin, parent's bedroom. Were they thinking his mother would ever let other Death Eaters near him while he was home from school? They were dead wrong.
. He hopes he doesn't slip on his own slick— how embarrassing would that be?
"Careful there, Harry. I might think you were cheating on me."
Turns out, he didn't need to. Hank pulled away first. His lips were plumped and Draco had half a mind (okay, maybe a quarter of a mind) to feel embarrassed by how carried away they got. They were both panting hard.
The door to the cart swung open, and Luna Lovegood drifted in dreamily. She sat next to Harry and looked up at him with a gentle smile. Her silver eyes betrayed nothing of what was going on in her mind. She looked like she was doing much better than during the War. Her cheeks were filled out more and her light blonde hair held a healthy glow. Harry heard she was dating the grandson of a famous magizoologist. She took a seat beside Harry, turning slightly to face him.
Hermione clears her throat. "It's Amortentia, Harry," she says. "The most powerful love potion ever brewed."
, Narcissa thinks.
It was also a defense measure, to make sure Draco wouldn’t have to see Potter’s bare skin either. Draco didn’t have anything to hide. His chest wasn’t even bruised anymore; it was just the scars that remained. Potter wasn’t a stranger to scars.
Nobody was in the changing room when he walked in. It was a mess, towels and Quidditch clothes strewn about. Harry found the locker he kept his clothes in and began undressing. There were mirrors that made up two walls in the changing room, which were always a little strange to Harry, but they made up some use now. As he was buttoning up his shirt, a pale hand darted out from under one of the curtains before clenching up into a fist and retreating.
“Malfoy?” There wasn’t a response, so he continued, “What are you still doing here?”
Unfortunately, he wasn't alone in that office. Three years ago, his lovely mother died. It wasn't anything sudden but it was still traumatic; some Muggle disease that the Healers hadn't seen coming. None of them saw it coming. Draco hurried her to a non-wizard hospital despite her protests but it was too late. (He tried not to suspect that his mother had already accepted her death by then. It would make things worse.)
“We don’t have anything to make hot chocolate though, Malfoy.”
"Of course I knew that. This is my life's work, you know. I'd appreciate it if you took this a bit more seriously."
The ropes that held his hands up disintegrated and James' hands fell limp. Teddy massaged his wrists firmly. They knew the ropes wouldn't intentionally hurt him, but it helped them to feel like they're doing something helpful. And James has confessed in the past that it does help him emotionally.
He smiles. Harry
Draco raised
"My name isn't really Hank Allen. This isn't what I really look like."
And with that, Potter grabbed his wrist and pulled him away. They didn’t stop running until they reached their shared dorm room.
Draco dropped his hands away from the man's legs as if he had been burned. He took a few steps back and tripped on a damned shoe. Luckily, he caught himself on his bed. He sat down slowly and closed his eyes, head tilted backward.
Harry's barely gotten used to the rhythm when she puts the vibrator back on his dick. He was so sensitive his eyes stung with tears.
"I finished up all of my paperwork... so I have the weekend entirely free! No work this weekend to interrupt us," Harry says lowly. Oh, Narcissa doesn't like the sound of that. She doesn't need to know her son's private life, thank you very much.
If only they could do this outside of a damp, dingy closet. Hermione feels she has had multiple opportunities to tell her friends, or Harry at the very least, but she can never work up the courage to express her thoughts. Draco Malfoy of all people already knows; Pansy said he caught her coming back to Slytherin common room after one of their midnight expeditions, coincidentally because he was coming back from a secret love affair with Harry. They promised not to reveal each other's secrets.
But there's a lot on his mind. More so than usual, typically containing one wild-eyed blond who's taken to following him around Godric's Hollow. He introduced himself as Gellert Grindelwald, nephew of Bathilda Bagshot. (Who Ariana's taken to calling "Bat-shit insane Bagshot". Not her most creative insult.) The sixteen-year-old instantly took a liking to Albus. Bothering him when he was working on his essays, interrupting his nightly walks, even sending owls after him when he was travelling for more than a day.
to me unless you mean it."
So when they let their hair grow long, it's all for the blanket appreciative smile James would give them.
"Is it true? What you wrote about?"
But then there it was: the thin pale scar slowly making its appearance above his brow, splitting the dark hair at the very edge of his eyebrow in two.
Harry, but she
to move you around a bit."
Once he looked up he was faced with Potter’s face. He was just staring at him, smiling shyly. Like he wasn’t expecting to give him the wand that night either. He was breathing quickly, overwhelmed with emotions. Something in his chest pulled him forward, and before he could really think about it Potter was leaning in as well. Their lips met.
There were plenty of items that Harry thought he knew but found out were completely different in the magical sphere. Owls weren't just creepy little bastards who stared at you if you were out too late. They were the entire postal system. Chess wasn't simply a strategic logic game between friends, but an actual battlefield with chess pieces getting ruthlessly slaughtered. So why should sex toys be any different?
He climbed into the bath and pulled Draco on top of him, laughing as the water sloshed up the sides of the tub. Draco smiled and leaned in to Sirius' body even more. His eyes were red and puffy from the crying earlier. Sirius pushed a wet strand of hair off of his face.
Fuck, his own apartment was beginning to be a weird spot. Potter only spent time there once yet made a lasting impression. Draco had seen the people of ash in Pompeii after the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. That was what entering his bedroom felt like; excavating a tragic scene and seeing the imprint of a loved one on his door.
It was different than when they held hands. But, not different at all. There were similarities in skin, the softness. The unexpected roughness of it being another human being. Draco’s never kissed like this before. He’s only kissed one other person and it was an experimental kiss; Pansy convinced him that it wouldn’t hurt to try. This wasn’t like that.
"I'm home!" Harry calls from the other room.
"And then, of course, and
The short-term dorm rooms for the eighth years didn’t have a portrait to protect them, but rather two hideous gargoyles set on the left and right of the front door. They were nasty little creatures with mouths like spitfire and their feathers would shed all over the stairway leading to the front door. Now, they were cackling rather loudly at the muddy, exhausted states of all the Quidditch players.
In fact, the room was different than when Dumbledore was headmaster. Everything was neat and tidy, the furniture all matching and the books organized. Some of the portraits hung up on the walls had thick pieces of cloth draped over them and it reminded Harry of Mrs. Black in Grimmauld Place, whose screams can’t be placated unless she’s covered up. He’d never noticed that when Dumbledore was alive.
This was too much. It felt like too much. He groaned loudly as he finally came, the smaller vine swiping it up while the other one stayed wrapped around his prick.
Harry’s hand crept toward his, under the table, and grabbed it. His hand was warm. It always was and Harry couldn’t explain it. Not that it really needed explaining; Draco’s hands and feet were always cold so it was a nice change of pace. But holding hands in a public space, even if it was underneath a table, was a little embarrassing. He felt himself flushing, thankful that it wouldn’t show that much on his fair skin.
It was Blaise Zabini's idea, at first, confessing that he was always fascinated with Muggle party games. Then it was Dean Thomas who brought up Truth or Dare. That got Blaise's attention, a mischievous glint in his eye that made Harry grateful he refused to be sorted in Slytherin.
"A spell that can, uh, change the speed of a vibrator without having to get up?"
"It was just what I needed," Draco promised. He suddenly looked guilty. "I didn't go too far either? With the comments about..."
She was leaning forward, placing her hand on Harry's knee. Was this flirting now? Were they flirting over a box of sex toys? What was Harry's life? Harry felt his stomach twist in arousal.
She looks like she doesn't really want to be there. Ginny would say she has RBF, but Harry always thought that was a crude way of saying it. Her straight black hair was cut right around her chin, emphasizing her dark makeup. It was glittery-black except for her lipstick— a dark green color.
Zygmunt couldn't promise he'd be back at this fuck of a school on Monday morning, though.
Ball is based on a holiday that has deep roots in witchcraft,
"Hmm," Draco hummed. Harry wondered if his truth serum hadn't really worn off yet. "Yes. Because I was obnoxiously obsessed with bringing you up in every conversation."
. Every single shelf. Because of course nobody actually cleans up after themselves and Dean's almost positive the librarian was really just some gargoyle they stole from a church.
Harry can't smell anything else over the potion in front of him. It looks like a drink that would fit in at Madame Puddifoot's shop. He doesn't dare stir it, though his hand twitches. He itches his nose instead.
"Harry, this isn't worth it, please!"
"Talk more, you little terror. See how far that gets you," Sirius growled. He rotated his wrists, relishing the fact that he caused the surprised gasp of agony from the young man. He was so young, so stupid. Far stupider than Sirius ever was at the age of twenty-two.
. It’s been celebrated by wizards and witches for centuries, but it doesn’t seem to be fairly popular nowadays. None of the seasonal holidays seem to be…”
In the distance, beneath the thick snow falling to the ground, Draco sees the twin shine of headlights.
Fuck.
Blaise groaned, spreading her fingers through his wetness. "So good for me, darling."
His face was flushed red and Draco didn't know if it was from the wine or anticipation. (He hoped it was the latter.)
"Should we take this into the bedroom?" He asked, in a voice that he hoped was more sultry than anxious.
“Fine. Slide them under the curtain.”
His friends cheer him on as he stands up. It almost feels like a walk of shame as he stands up and walks toward her.
Weasley didn’t seem too put-off by his presence, which was a change he wasn’t expecting. Harry sat down beside him, but those two sat across from them. Granger mimicked his set up and got into her work quickly, as expected. She would be the brightest witch of her age if she didn’t study. Weasley was staring at him, though he didn’t look particularly judgemental.
Zygmunt smiled. (And he knew it looked grotesque. His teeth were atrocious and his lips went white when he smiled like he was stretching his skin taut. He
Draco can't help but feel betrayed. Does Harry truly think he wants a child more than he wants his husband? When they dedicated their vows to each other, did Harry believe it was a farce? That Draco was just using him as a means to an end? A lifetime of trauma, of being used as a pawn in a greater game, must have instilled this into him. He wants Harry to snap out of it, to realize the importance of his life.
There was still a particularly haunted look in his eyes. Probably plagued by nightmares. Draco could relate. He bet some of those nightmares were caused by him.
Ron stands up and stretches. He stretches until his shoulders scream at him. Then he shuffles over to Harry's bed. Harry still hasn't stopped groaning as if he's in pain. Like his nightmares are causing physical hurt.
"Halfway done, love," Teddy told him gently, running their fingertips along the welts.
"Why do you always disobey me? You could have been killed! The plants and animals beyond the garden are unregulated and have been here for generations, so it's not as if we can just mow them down. You look filthy, darling, did you sleep out here? Merlin and Circe, come over here at once! We need to give you a warm bath and some illness checks. Hopefully you aren't sick— winter break is almost over, you know."
The cabin is less dark on the inside, especially when Charlie flicks the lights on. Multi-colored blankets were draped over the sofas, the fuzzy rugs were each a different neon color, and even his trinkets all had contrasting patterns and colors.
The woman immediately took notice of his presence, moving her head sharply to look at him. His courage dwindles under her glare.
Forcing his legs to move, Draco entered the changing room. Rowdy laughter and raucous conversation pressed against the tiled walls. No eyes laid upon him, not yet at least, so he wasted not a moment, speeding past the other eighth years and into a stall. Under his breath, he muttered a sticking charm on the curtain so that nobody but him could move it. When he was in Slytherin, everyone knew about his snootiness for privacy, but this was a group he didn’t know. Or, perhaps more accurately, they didn’t know of him.
"Unfortunately, I've been afflicted with a far worse disease than lycanthropy... homosexuality."
James blushed, his freckles standing out as if under a spotlight. He didn't respond verbally, but Teddy noticed the full-body shudder. They noticed the stirring of James' cock against his thigh.
Obviously, spur of the moment trysts would occur, which neither of them ever complained about.
“Harry, are you positive you’ll be alright? You seemed kind of out of it on the train ride here,” Hermione asked imploringly. All summer she’s been trying her damndest to encourage communication. She just didn’t understand how awkward it was to talk about everything; the breaking up with Ginny, the days spent listlessly in his bed staring at the ceiling at Grimmauld Place, the nightmares he got even at the Weasley’s that left him breathless and panicked for hours.
The strength in his voice made the butterflies in Harry’s stomach flutter. He smiled a little. “It’s not as if you’ve ever needed my permission for anything,” he said softly, which drew a small exhale of mirth from Draco. “I don’t mind, though. I would still like to be with you if you still want me.”
Charlie smiles a bit. It's the first time Draco's ever had one from him. He hopes he leaves soon so Draco can swoon in private. Unfortunately the cold that creeps in from Charlie's open door is enough to persuade him to leave soon after Charlie does. He grabs his suitcase and trudges through the snow to the cabin. Charlie presses his car keys and locks it from the porch.
The phone rings for a good two minutes before someone finally picks up.
He smiled at her and nodded, throwing himself back down on the bed. "I'm not gonna complain."
," Teddy said at last. Their wand felt strong, solid, in their hand. The magic thrummed through surprisingly flexible sycamore wood and made contact with James' bare chest.
It was on their second child and Pansy and Luna's first, that Draco decided to bring up the topic to Harry. Harry was hoping they would have kids; he'd always wanted a big family like the Weasleys, but he was nervous to ask Draco about it. Thus began their attempts at having a child.
I hope you enjoyed reading! Comments and kudos are appreciated :)
Harry looked over the tables at all the other students so he wouldn’t have to see his best friends’ concern displayed so explicitly on their faces. The new Gryffindors looked promising. A rambunctious pack of eleven-year-olds. He could see their need to prove themselves, coming from the same House as Harry Potter. A large part of him wanted to grab all of them by the front of their shirts and talk to them about why idolizing him wasn’t a good idea.
He allowed himself to cry for a while. Rubbed his palms into his eyes so hard that star burst in his vision when he opened them again. His entire face felt swollen and hot.
Malfoy didn’t notice his outburst. He was looking at the ground. His hair was a bit longer than it had been the last time Harry had seen him. Filled out his robes more, though. Reminiscent of when they were younger, both young and spry, treating each other as silly childhood rivals. Harry was struck by how much
“Malfoy—”
“Hey!” Harry stood so that they were looking eye-to-eye. Ron was growing to be quite taller than him, Charlie Weasley suggested he’s probably magicking his height. But he was probably just trying to make Harry feel better about his own height or lack thereof. “He’s been avoiding me all day.”
kisser. Very grabby, putting those firm hands to use.
One of the only of his inheritances he took to his apartment was that magical portrait. She was still painful to talk to sometimes, but Narcissa— it felt wrong to call this young woman his mother when she had barely known him when the portrait was made, though she didn't mind when he would slip up— was usually quiet, watching him work with a curious eye.
Pairing: Albus Dumbledore/Gellert Grindelwald
when you mother hen, Hermione, but maybe we should let him be for right now? Harry’s a big boy, if something is going on then I’m sure he’ll tell us.” He gave Harry a pointed look. Both of them knew it took a lot for Harry to come to them when he was feeling down.
"I know!" Draco pulled at his silky hair. "I know. I just... It really hurt that I looked so stupid in front of him. Fawning over this man who wasn't even real. It hurt that he didn't trust me just to appear as himself from the beginning."
. His stupid fucking prick still hasn't deflated and is eagerly twitching in the warm, wet hole it's found itself in. Harry's rough hands knead his thighs and arse and Draco wonders if he is put off by how sticky the skin there is.
The door to their bathroom creaked open and out came Malfoy, wearing silk blue pajamas (of course it’s silk) and drinking a hot drink from a mug. Harry frowned.
know that, right?"
Well, almost everyone. Madame Hooch definitely knew he created a study spot out of what was, essentially, her office. Sometimes he would walk to his usual spot and find a plate with little sandwiches on it and a glass of pumpkin juice. Or a picnic blanket on the ground when it rained, charmed to keep him dry and warm. And in return, he made sure to clean up any mess he made and to help Madame Hooch put away any equipment that was left out.
"That sounds greatly appealing. Unless this is all merely a ruse to get more
Her fingers fill him up so well, thrusting slowly inside of him. With her other hand she turned on the vibrator and rubbed it gently against his cock. Harry moaned, surprised— it didn't matter how much she did this, it always caught him off guard how good it felt. He never knew sex could feel so good. He barely even masturbated before meeting Blaise.
Once he caught his breath, another vine slipped between his bum and began rubbing against his hole. Is that why it wanted him to come? To make him more pliant? Draco was feeling a lot more relaxed, though his heart raced inside his chest.
How long has Malfoy been looking at him? Why was he looking at him like that? Harry notices a pink tinge on the other boy's sickly skin. Did he see what Harry saw?
Well, Draco could see the appeal. Especially since he would never get a chance with the one he's wanted for so long. (Since fifth year, as pathetic as that sounds.) Maybe that's what it all was; insecure partners who know their lover's minds are wandering so they believe changing into that other person will fix everything. Draco couldn't imagine it resulted in anything beneficial. But... he could definitely see why someone would want that.
he looked.
So many of the teaching positions were open after the Battle of Hogwarts. How did McGonagall manage to fill every single one in only one year? As well as fix up the century-old castle? There was nearly no evidence left of the destruction the school went through, save for the few intentional broken parts of the school left to honor those who died on school grounds.
"Please leave," he said. The words felt like sand in his mouth. It hurt to push them out, they coated everything around him and he knew it would take years to clean up after everything was said and done.
"I know. Who do you think incinerates all those blasted letters your kind send us?"
