“Don’t you want to talk about this? Have you even thought things over?”
“Let’s go Christmas shopping,” Hermione clapped her hands.
“It’s more believable than you think. Don’t make me regret helping you,” Pansy huffed. “So, what are you going to do?”
Harry listened as Draco and Dumbledore continued to converse.
He chuckled. “No, ‘course not. I need to go shopping for myself, anyway. You guys have fun.”
“Do what? Come on, Harry, you know you want to.” Draco was taunting Harry now. He was feeling so infuriated with himself and Harry as well.
“Is that how you greet your father, Draco?” he asked, setting the newspaper down on the table in front of him. “Re-enter the room.”
“Stop worrying,” Draco cut him off with an eye roll, though he was smiling (of course he loved how Harry was worrying about him), “I’m fine. Just tired today. Of course, you pick today to procrastinate and work frantically, so now I can’t relax either.”
“Will you let me finish?” Harry said, leaning forward and smacking his shoulder lightly. “All I’m saying is, it might take some time to get used to it. I’m sure after dinner they’ll all love you as I do.”
“Morning, Scarface,” said Draco in an amused tone, “You look stunning today.” He was standing at the door. Harry jumped, slowly turning around to face Draco, rolling his eyes. He wiped the drool off of his face and fixed his hair that was sticking up in different directions.
So he stood up and left when it was safe to do so, walking down the empty hallways.
“Do you really need to ask?” he responded, wrapping his arms around his neck and pulling him into a slow, careful kiss. The two waited for a moment, perhaps to feel a burning sensation, but it never came. Draco slipped his arms around Harry’s waist, a little too concerned, in case Harry would suddenly feel the effects of the curse.
“How do you expect me to be with someone who doesn’t fucking trust me?”
Harry turned around. “Okay, I’m ready.”
“Draco!” he heard his father hissing. Draco slowly got on his two feet, trembling as his father motioned for him to come over to him. Draco slowly, and carefully, took a few steps towards Voldemort. He turned to face Harry’s body.
Ron and Hermione didn’t think they were doing anything particularly romantic that would make Harry feel like a third wheel. But then again, they didn’t think they were making Harry feel like a third wheel at all.
A week passed. Ginny Weasley was finding every excuse to talk to Harry, but he wasn’t up for it. Eventually, she gave up and simply just stayed by him as he remained silent.
He opened it quickly.
“Maybe this wouldn’t have happened if you didn’t keep your relationship with that girl so secret,” Ron said.
Draco rolled his eyes. “No, I meant you didn’t eat breakfast, right?”
“Well, they can’t be caught slipping up, can they?” he spat, looking at her with disgust, folding his arms. “Don’t tell me you believe that
“Whoops!” Harry said with a giggle. “Hi!”
(See the end of the chapter for
It was merely the beginning of something new.
“Hey,” she snapped her fingers. “I’m just trying to make sure you and Harry-”
Draco looked up from his book, raising an eyebrow. “Well, you never asked.” Draco replied, shrugging as he set the book down on the table in front of them, frowning slightly at Harry.
“Well, it’s not interesting if I’m not in it,” he stated, raising his chin and smirking. “Can’t imagine what sort of news would even come in the American newspaper.”
“Let me see that,” Draco cut him off and grabbed the letter that was from Ginny.
“I’m sure you know you can’t owl him. Or anyone, for that matter. I don’t trust that source of communication anymore,” she stated, biting her thumb. She eyed him somewhat suspiciously. “You won’t, right?”
“Honestly, you know how hard it was for me to push your hand away without Snape noticing? Merlin, I wanted to push you to the ground but I, of course, couldn’t.”
“I got you something else,” Draco admitted.
Two weeks had passed since Harry had fallen sick. The next Quidditch game was against Ravenclaw, coming up in a week.
“Draco, that’s great,” Pansy said with a smile. “All thanks to
“I need to get going,” Harry said. “Wait, Pansy, could you… do me a favor?”
“Late as always?” Draco retorted, keeping his eyes on the other as he sat down across from him. “Hey,” he leaned forward, his face all serious. Harry leaned in too, frowning, wondering if there was something wrong on his face.
It seemed like opening the window didn’t help; the room was still boiling hot. It was hotter outside than it was inside.
“Like anyone would send you a letter, Ron,” Hermione laughed, high fiving Harry who also chuckled. “But you know, if this person is bothering you, we can get to the bottom of it.”
“Did none of what I told you in the summer get into your head?” Lucius stormed, raising his voice. “Sacrifices need to be made for the Dark Lord to succeed. You’re letting your emotions overcome you. What is it about Hogwarts? Every few months you need to be told the same things again. Do you need to be reminded-”
I have many ideas left for this fan-fiction. The problem is, I don't have much time. But I don't know, if you really want me to finish this fanfic (which I feel I owe to Draco, Harry, myself and you), I will try my best. please comment below your opinion if you want to (which would be very much appreciated).
“Hermione. You don’t know what happened.” Harry cut her off. “See? I knew you’d react like this. That’s why I didn’t want to tell you.”
“You’re really committed to learning this for some relative you don’t even know that well,” Harry commented, taking the book from his hands checking out which page he was on. “Oh, come on, this is easy.”
Draco shuddered at the mention of his name.

“You can’t just not attempt any new spells,” Hermione stated. “That’s ridiculous!”
“Mate, fix your hair,” He stated. Harry, confused, walked into the bathroom to look at himself in the mirror. The streak in his hair was bright white, contradicting his semi-dark brown hair. He raised an eyebrow. Maybe it was a wizard thing. He had no time to think of this now. He was having a huge headache. He instantly regretted drinking that much Firewhisky all because he couldn’t handle not being able to kiss Draco.
“Harry won’t tell me who his girlfriend is,” Hermione explained, and they started walking again. “Honestly, Harry, we really should know. We’re your best friends.”
Pulling his silk pajamas closer to his body, he sat down to eat breakfast, which was simply just cereal. The warmth that had been radiating off his energy was slowly wearing off, and he felt almost numb.
Draco kept his eyes on Pansy, who was trying not to laugh. “Fuck you,” he mouthed, his body tensed. He cleared his throat, dumping some food onto his plate, almost dropping the serving spoon when Harry reached past him for a glass of champagne. He smelled… the same, but different. It was the same, comfortable scent that made him feel at home, but mixed with cheap cologne, it seemed.
“Really? Who?” Harry asked, suddenly intrigued.
“You knew, didn’t you?” she asked.
He snapped out of his thoughts, shaking his head. “I’m not. I was listening,” he protested, looking up at Hermione, who was staring at him accusatively, her arms folded. She narrowed her eyes.
But his lips let out a laugh, his mouth forcing a smile.
“We think it’s better if you stay here, with us,” Narcissa told him. She sensed how tense Draco was, judging by his body language in that moment. “Both of us decided we want you here.”
to avoid you to keep up the facade-”
“Harry! Harry, we won! We won against Ravenclaw!”
Molly stood up, putting a hand on his shoulder. “Let’s get you home, love.”
“Oh, Merlin, do you seriously do this every Saturday?” Harry asked them as he shut the book he was reading. Hermione and Ron exchanged glances and turned to look at Harry, not saying anything. Hermione clutched the dress in her hands as she rolled her eyes at Ron.
be real.”
“Draco?” Astoria asked, waving her hand slightly in front of him. “What do you think of these glasses?” She held them out. “I like the elegant design on them. Should we get a set of six?”
“A chance to what? Stay with me and let yourself endure the pain? You think I don’t know you?”
“Blaise will switch spots with Harry, sir,” Pansy immediately piped up.
“I bet,” she replied. “Where
“Good morning,” said Draco as he reached over and ruffled Harry’s hair. “Finally, you’re awake. I didn’t want to leave without you.”
Harry woke up to a pounding head as he slowly sat up, groaning in pain.
Draco sat down beside him kissing his cheek. “You did good today. By the way, I… probably should tell you, I won’t be able to do Sundays from now on. I have some… homework. You know.”
“Hey, Ginny,” he smiled. “Need help with the dessert?”
“It’s not that, but… talking about it with you…” Trailing off into silence, Harry ran a hand through his hair, knowing that what he was about to say would be bad. His eyes moved down to Draco’s arm. “I’m not sure it’s a good idea.”
“Draco. What’s wrong?” Harry asked. “I’m not stupid. Even a blind person could tell that something’s up.”
“Well, he sort of… told me to leave and never come back, so…”
That was a wrong thing to say, and Draco knew that more than anyone at that moment.
She rolled her eyes. “There’s a curse, isn’t there?” she asked. “I noticed the magical energy as soon as you entered. Something bad. Almost Voldemort level.”
After breakfast, Harry, Ron and Hermione all went up to his room. Ron frowned. “The hearing aids could work,” he said.
“Well, that was when--” his gaze averted to Draco, who seemed to be listening intently as he ate his dinner. “...when I had somewhat of a plan. I’m trying to just take things as I go.”
Handing the hearing aid back to Harry, she eyed Draco suspiciously. “...well, I suppose dating Malfoy has its perks.”
“Exactly! Everything’s still going to be in stock. Come on then, boys,” she nudged the two. Groaning, the two followed after. Hermione had grown her hair out to just below her shoulders and from what Harry could see, she was happy with Ron. They bickered now and then, but it was usual for them to quickly move past it.
“I only had three hours with you, though,” Harry murmured as Draco laid beside him, stroking his hair gently.
With that, Lucius Malfoy gave Draco a demeaning glare before turning and leaving.
“I should’ve come to see you first.”
“It’s still my turn. I choose the color red… and uno,” Harry said as he set down a skip-turn card, then a normal red card. “I win.”
“What? No. That was totally out of the line and incredibly stupid.” Pansy told him. “I was talking about drawing your wands out and pointing it at each other. You know, Harry, the good ol’
“Draco,” Harry breathed when he stared into Draco’s eyes. He didn’t know what was up today, but staring into those endless silver eyes, with his silk hair that he didn’t gel up specially for Harry, and his beautiful smile, Harry couldn’t think straight. “You look stunning.”
“Were you just with him?” she questioned, her eyes moved down to his neck, where a greenish-purple ‘bruise’ was just above his collar. “You need some concealer or something, honey?”
The owl wouldn't stop coming. God. May the creature be blessed. Draco made sure that the owl was well fed, because it must be
(Draco left before dawn.)
Draco wanted to laugh at that, because
"What?” Granger snapped. Draco made sure not to take a step backward. “What is

because that's what people did, right? They got tired of him, every single time. Draco devoured his worries. He didn’t say anything.
“Yeah, okay, love.”
Draco stayed silent and blinked again. Granger let out a defeated breath.
Draco wanted to cry. “I left you.”
Draco finally let a breath out and he cried on the first count. He clung back, holding for Harry. "Harry," he said, voice wavering, "I came back for you."
“We can try again, then.”
"Until you send me away."
“Wonderful.”
Draco didn't dare to touch Harry. He was afraid of waking him up. Draco thought about leaving in the morning. At least he did what Granger must had wanted; him being present. Draco could stay awake until the sun come up. He couldn't sleep since he moved back to the Manor, so not sleeping wouldn't be a problem. Right. But he could smell Harry- that man with god knows what cologne he secretly used. And his smell had always help with Draco's nightmare, an anchor to remind him that he was safe and nothing was real and it was all just a stupid dream. Harry smelled like home and a sanctuary and Draco knew he was stupid for clinging onto Harry, drowning the man with him. Draco knew better than making home out of people, because no one would stay for him. No one, not ever.
But Harry- Harry seemed like he wouldn't be awake until the next week, Draco thought. It wasn't true, of course, because the Healer said that Harry had gained his consciousness and was just sleeping. But. Draco promised himself he would go before the man wake up. He looked at Harry once again, noticing the visible lines on his forehead. Even in his sleep, his brows furrowed. Draco’s breath hitched and everything seemed so heavy right now, so he let his eyes fluttered and he slept, so quiet, for the first time after so long.
Harry’s breath was quiet and still, and so was Draco’s. He really couldn’t wait; for them to try again, to spend days ahead with Harry. Harry harry harry harry
"Are you- are you going to stay?"
“And you came back.”
"Why?" was all that Draco could say. The clock in the Manor ticked, suddenly loud between silence.
Draco dreamed of Harry. Every night. And his nightmare had somehow shifted, from the war to the loss of a lover. Lover. They were lovers, weren't they? But. Draco realized that Harry deserved better and- what a curse it was to had the world on your shoulder before you were born and be in love with someone so worthless afterwards?
"But you are the love of my life."
Draco wanted to ask why and what for. He wanted to say,
"Draco," Harry stroked his hair in an assuring rhythm, "do you want to tell me? It's okay if you don't want to. We can- we can sleep or make breakfast. Have you eaten? I could-"
“Because I was cold and you were on a mission.”
"I didn't want to ruin his life," Draco found himself talking. "This is for the best."
"Draco," Harry had called him, again. And that wasn't the first time Harry tongue curled into his first name, no. But they were special, you know? Harry only did that several times and every time the man did, Draco wanted to burst because the flutter in his stomach was getting too real and distracting. When Harry spoke again, Draco could feel his mouth, wet, moving on his neck, loud and was so honest, "I'm sorry. I was too stubborn and I should had listened to you and not to my stupid guts and I was-"
"I'm sorry," said Draco again to Harry's neck. It felt kind of pointless and empty now, saying the same thing over and over again. "I fucked up. I'm sorry. I was afraid. I know it sounds stupid, but-"
Draco knocked again.
"He was happy. With you, I mean. And he was doing so much better,” Granger said, quietly.
. Over and over again until he thought,
Draco closed his eyes. He wanted to shut his mouth, wanted to succumb back in silence. God. He deserved not even an ounce of Harry. Harry harry harry harry
, you had spent half your life in agony, carrying a burden too heavy for your own good. I can't let you have another burden in your life- after everything you have gone through. And I knew if I didn't leave, you wouldn't get the chance to meet new people. You wouldn't get the chance to find the love of your life and-"
"You have."
"For how long?"
Draco's days went on. Per usual, as how he expected them to be. He ate and showered and read some old books left in his room and burned anything that Harry's owl brought. He didn't speak. Didn't ask. He went quiet, still. He cried, sometimes, but he made sure that he had put on a muffliato before hand. And he had his nightmares and sometimes he thought of Harry. Sometimes he woke up after choking on his own tears, expecting Harry would come with a cup and cried even more when he realized those days were long gone.
The conversation turned to Hogwarts. The way they talked about it, it was quite literally the best place on earth. They kept saying it, and they kept saying that Harry had been happy there. The silent
‘Castle’ almost seemed like an understatement. It might have been a hundred castles, all mashed together and existing simultaneously against all laws of physics. A majestic gathering of soaring turrets and barbicans of pale, worn gray. Smoke drifted up from several towers. Not a ruin of some old stronghold, as he had expected.
Her pink lips tilted up. He thought he might be sweating. “You like to invest in new companies. Donations, really. Diagon Alley would not have rebuilt so quickly after ze war without your help.” She leaned forward at where he was looking. “Ah. Last year…I believe it was to George…’e was fined by ze Ministry for hiring a test group without ze proper permits.”
Hermione gave Harry an accusing look, then wordlessly tugged Ron back by the back of his robes. “Go on, Harry.”
“It’s my fault,” Ron said. “I’m sorry.”
Harry watched Teddy dance backwards down the stairs, clearly for the sole benefit of making Reena laugh and scold him. “Why wouldn’t she help?”
“And you’re the only one who knows that about me?”
Minerva looked faintly - very faintly - disturbed.
talk about magic in those books is in, like, Middle English. They say
So Harry and Ron had fought about this before. Harry took Hermione’s side often enough for it to be an issue.
“Draco,” he repeated, and when he got no response he leaned forward, touching his hand to Draco’s neck and forward, drawing him up as gently as possible by the chin. He looked to be sleeping, but if he was it wasn’t pleasant. There was tension in his face, his eyes circled in bruised purple skin and highlighted by tear tracks. Something like soot marked his cheek.
“Right. Of course.”
“Wow, fuck you, Harry.”
“Oh, I wouldn’t dare to,” he mocked, nudging Hermione, who was shooting daggers at Draco.
Your thoughts?
The second night, not so much. He checked his watch. It was nearing five. He had barely been able to sleep the entire night. The sun was starting to rise, so he decided to get up. Ron was snoring soundly and Hermione was passed out. She was probably exhausted from the stress. She tended to take on a lot of pressure from situations.
“Pansy,” Draco groaned. Pansy quickly got up and walked to where they were. Harry slightly hid behind Draco.
“No,” Harry said truthfully. “I think… I think I just need to be alone.” He quickly got up, moving away from Draco’s touch, grabbing his wand and exiting the Room of Requirement.
Just then, the bell rang from the Clock Tower, signaling the start of the next period.
“Draco, it’s been two days. Everyone’s really worried, and Blaise is locked out of his dorm… Please, just open up?” Harry asked through the door, knocking lightly again. Everyone from Eighth Year (except for Draco and Harry) were in the Common Room, pretending that they were unable to hear Harry speaking.
Reluctantly, he did as asked, and Harry realized it was the first time he had seen Draco wear short sleeves. His eyes moved down to Draco’s forearm, where a Dark Mark was clearly imprinted, who quickly put his arm behind his back.
“I’d tell them that a Malfoy wouldn’t ever say such an absurd statement, and they should get their ears checked,” he held his wand up. “Is Harry safe?”
Both of them said it at the exact same time, at the exact same moment, with the same look in their eyes.
“Me too,” she said quietly. “And… with Draco?”
“I wasn’t even there for most of the party… fuck, how much did I drink?” Harry said with a slight groan. “Had to have been a bottle or two… How about you, Ron?”
Ron nodded. “You’re really brave, you know. I wouldn’t have been able to handle all of this,” he said while signing the same thing. Although their signing wasn’t as good as his, he was still grateful that they had been willing to learn - most of the Weasleys now knew basic sign language, too.
He was going to figure out what was up with Malfoy.
She sat down on a chair, taking a deep breath. “You must be stressed.”
And then he smashed their lips together once again.
a chance.”
“No, that’s the problem,” he shook his head, feeling hot tears run down his face. “This isn’t enough for me. Do you not understand? Every time we meet, I end up wanting something more. We had a day together and it felt like I had a purpose to live again, Draco. I had forgotten what that felt like. But there are so many things to consider-”
“What?” Harry stared. “You need to start signing even a little bit if you’re going to talk so fast.”
What was wrong?
Draco immediately took this as the perfect chance to check out Harry’s arse. It was just as cute as he thought, definitely. He watched as Harry put on the silk pants, feeling a little disappointed that he couldn’t stare at Harry’s arse anymore.
ex-crush. And I kissed her back!” he answered, and the three broke into a small smile, knowing full well it was not something to laugh about.
“If you had just let me fucking explain, you would have known already!” Draco snapped at him. “Go ahead, Harry. Hex me. Curse me. Use whatever spell you want. You know you want to. I’m on Voldemort’s side, aren’t I? I deserved to be treated like trash.”
“I hope… I hope I make a decision by then,” Harry said, playing with the sleeves of his sweater. The three sat in a comfortable silence before standing up and Apparating to Luna’s house.
If you reject that, of course it means we have to be enemies!”
“Hold on, some girl was trying to get you to fall in love with her? This is why you don’t accept chocolates from just anyone. And I suppose you were going to eat them yourself?”
“Sorry!” Harry readjusted Draco’s tie, looking up at Draco’s silver eyes. They didn’t have much of a height difference, but Harry was just a bit shorter than Draco. Harry softly placed his lips on Draco’s, kissing him gently. Draco was taken aback but immediately responded, kissing him back.
“Shut up, Blaise,” he snapped, nostrils flaring, his eyes piercing.
Growing impatient and worry spiraling his thoughts, he stood up and walked towards the shelves, tracing his index finger down the spines of a few of the books.
“Harry.”
Harry adjusted his glasses, squinting at her as he came back to reality. “Who?” he looked around the group, then cursed under his breath when he noticed Ron, Luna and Ginny weren’t anywhere in sight. The next few events were a blur in Harry’s mind. The only thing he should’ve been thinking about was what Lucius Malfoy had just told him, and saving his friends. Saving Sirius.
“Shut up!” Draco shouted, getting very frustrated by now. Out of instinct, he took out his wand and pointed it at Harry. “You know nothing. This is not about you, Harry.”
“Draco, don’t you think this is a little too much?” Pansy asked, frowning. “This doesn’t seem like a good idea-”
He stood alone in the hallway, staring up at the ceiling. He didn’t want to cry. Before, he hadn’t had the time to. People were all over him, talking to him. It hadn’t hit him until now. The only family he had left was gone, and he was
That’s when he looked up and saw Harry’s body being carried by Hagrid.
“Draco, do you have a crush on this person?” she asked carefully.
“I understand, but you do know that you can talk to me, right?”
“You’re not the enemy.”
“I think it would be more interesting for you to find out on your own,” Lucius said with a smirk. “Now, off you go. I want you to study hard for the rest of the year-”
“Malfoy. Draco Malfoy.”
Draco picked up the vial of hellebore, using his right hand instead so they wouldn’t have to look at the bracelet. There was silence until Harry gasped. “You put ten drops! It said to put exactly seven-”
She looked at him almost empathetically, then dismissed him from her office.
********
“No,” he shook his head. “I need to finish up some homework.”
“You should get it,” she smiled. “It’s cute. Meanings behind your gifts.”
“Go on,” Harry raised an eyebrow. “On the other hand?”
“I know, I know,” Harry nodded. “It’s for the best.”
Draco rolled his eyes when she grabbed the book from his hands, scanning the cover that said ‘Wizarding Sign Language for Beginners’. She opened it and flipped through some of the pages, seeing that he had left all sorts of notes and bookmarks. Blaise, who had entered with her, was peeking over her shoulder, snorting.
Harry moved back to Draco’s lips, kissing him more roughly than before, more passionately. Their tongues were in each other’s mouth. A sudden lust dawned on the two, and soon enough, the Slytherin had turned the Gryffindor over so that he was right on top of Harry.
Draco, despite himself - despite knowing he should probably return home - nodded and followed her down to her kitchen. Leaning against the counter, he watched as she got out two glasses. They stood in silence while she made some lemonade, then sat down back in her room, where she had a lounge area.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Quite.”
“It just… it hurts to see you like this.”
“Harry, bud? You know how the streak in your hair was turning brown?” Ron asked, grimacing slightly, but also somewhat amused. “Yeah, um…” he gestured to his hair, shrugging.
His father’s cold eyes bored into his soul. There was complete silence, until finally, he spoke in his usual icy tone. “Don’t ask me such ridiculous things, Draco,” he said finally and left rather swiftly.
“Hold on. That can wait,” Harry cut him off, leaning forward and kissing Draco on the lips. At first, Draco froze, but he eventually kissed him back, the tension leaving his body. “I’ve missed you so much.”
“It’s Ron’s birthday,” he said. “I was planning on celebrating with our dorm mates, then sneaking away, but… this girl put a love potion in these chocolates meant for me, and Ron ate them. It was a huge mess. We ended up in Slughorn’s office, and he gave Ron an antidote. Then-”
“I wish I could believe that,” she sighed as he looked down at his food.
“Hello, love,” he said softly, then looked around, spotting the new table. “Wow, you really went all out for this date.”
“No. I wanted you to hear it. And I realized I hadn’t learnt the sign for it either, so I didn’t want you to just see it on my lips,” Draco explained.
Harry had calmed down slightly. He hung his head low, staring down at his lap. “Is that really all you think of me?” He asked in a low voice.
“As much as I’d like to blame you for this,” Hermione cut him off, “I know it wasn’t you. You loved him. Your father did this, didn’t he?”
Harry stayed silent, looking outside the window. “Why are you here, then? Did you think I would take you back in my arms willingly? Or are you here for forgiveness, hmm?”
“Where are you going?”
“I’d… um…”
“Your hearing aids. Take them off.”
Harry nodded. “Yes, I think I’ll focus more on Dumbledore’s lessons now.”
“Calm down, Draco. Harry can handle him, you know that.”
“I do consider myself lucky,” he stated. He sat up, intertwining both of his hands with Draco’s, looking up into his eyes. “Tomorrow’s Sunday.”
“Shh,” Harry quietened Draco with another kiss. As he pulled away from him, they both stared at each other, breathing heavily.
Would he?
But of course, it was completely different. She didn’t have the same passion; she didn’t have the same emotion; she didn’t have the same lips. Nothing about her was suitable for him. And that’s why he pulled away from Ginny.
Draco had been studying Harry, too. He had dark circles under his eyes, and his hair was a mess. He seemed more scrawny, as if he hadn’t been eating much. His eyes were greener than ever, however, and Draco found himself getting lost in them.
Harry stared back, before facepalming and turning away from him, getting back to his work. Draco chuckled before getting back to his work as well. The two were in the library, but after they were done studying and finishing off their homework, they would be going to the Room of Requirement to spend the night there.
“More like one secret admirer,” Ron commented, finishing up his breakfast and trying to take the letter from his hands. “That’s the same owl from the past few days, isn’t it? Can I read the paper?”
And with a soft kiss - much that felt like goodbye to this moment, or whatever peace their relationship had left - Harry was walking away, an ache in his chest, because he knew for certain things would never be the same again. He opened the piece of paper, which revealed a poem. It was the first one in months.
********
“You’re just… okay with it? Why?”
“Thanks,” Draco kept his eyes on Harry, who was fiddling with the hearing aids in his hands.
“On the other hand…” she repeated, “Draco clearly doesn’t want to follow the rest of his family’s footsteps, and it’s not as if he’s ever done anything in the past few months to cause distrust. You both knew what you were getting into and even had a month to test it out. Why is this an issue now?”
“I don’t even want to know…” he sighed, head in his hands. Harry was starting to make it a habit to sign while he spoke. It felt more natural to him this way, and it helped him become more comfortable with sign language. “I just don’t understand what his deal is. I never… I never wanted to be
“Okay, take in a deep breath, and close our eyes.”
Draco shut his eyes, as if he was willing himself not to. “You know I can’t, love. You have to go.”
Draco fell asleep, and so did Harry.
Harry thought he did something wrong. Draco turned around. His eyes were glinting with tears, but he was smiling so wide that he looked like the happiest person alive.
She groaned. “Do we seriously have to go for that? Can’t we just have a Christmas party with our circle? The PureBloods?”
Harry said nothing. This is what pained Draco even more. He put a hand to his left arm, where is Dark Mark was.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think it’s a little big for me,” Harry stated (completely oblivious to the fact that Draco had been checking him out) , looking down at the silk pants’ ends that were under his feet because they were too long for him.
He pushed away the obvious meaning of it, turning away from his reflection, jumping when Pansy walked in, clutching her purse. “You need to stop doing that,” he scoffed.
as a dancer.”
“Right,” he sat up. “Your poems are horrible.”
“I love how you just know you live in such a great mansion that people get lost in it,” Harry said with an eye roll.
“Sorry I kept you waiting,” Draco said as he approached Harry. Harry, who was busy daydreaming, hadn’t even notice Draco walk up to him. He suddenly felt extremely nervous. “But Pansy wouldn’t stop fussing over my clothes and wouldn’t stop until I had to practically run away from her.”
“No,” she cut him off, moving closer towards him. “I’d be stupid to not realize how genuinely happy you have been with him. He helped you in a way that I wish I could have. But… it’d have been dangerous. With You-Know-Who inside your mind right now, it’d be bad to be with him anyway, right?”
(See the end of the chapter for
. I never disliked you!”
Draco didn’t have to explain that he was feeling frustrated. He’d spend most of his time reading or catching up on homework. With everything going on, he found himself barely catching up with schoolwork. It wasn’t only that, he barely even had the motivation to do anything about it.
“You need to pretend to be in deep conversation. Then slowly look up - casually - and stare into his eyes with a smile. It’ll get him flustered.” Pansy explained. “Now, laugh.”
“Harry!” Hermione called from downstairs.
“Ron could you chew
“W-wait, don’t give me yours,” Harry whispered. Everyone else in the room was too busy fighting to notice that the two were on the floor, talking.
The blond nodded slightly, looking at Harry suspiciously. “I guess,” he folded his arms.
“Ask the absolute motherfucker,” Draco said, putting a hand to his cheek, unable to even look in Harry’s direction, but knew damn well that he was staring. He felt severely humiliated, his silver eyes gleaming as he frowned. He was unable to fathom what was happening. Gulping, he swiftly went towards the door, face getting warm.
“Uh, sure,” he nodded. “I don’t really mind anything.”
But Draco simply ignored Harry calling his name, not even looking at him. He walked into the hallway and into his dorm, shutting the door, as well as using a different kind of spell to lock it. He couldn’t have Harry entering; he couldn’t have him getting too close. Draco, not even for a second, wanted to doubt his father’s words. He didn’t intend on finding out what the curse would to do Harry.
After class was over, Draco and Harry were forced to let go of each other's hands which both of them didn’t want to do. Handing Snape his essay, Harry turned around hastily, and walked right into Draco, not realizing that he had been right behind him.
Exiting Harry’s store which was in Diagon Alley, they went through what felt like every single store, finding gifts for everyone. At one point, they even left Diagon Alley and went to some Muggle mall that Hermione knew of. Ever since graduating from Hogwarts, Harry had kept somewhat of a balance between his wizard and Muggle life. He had opened a store that sold books and potions. He was too uninterested in getting a job at the Ministry of Magic, where Ron and Hermione both worked. Harry had also dyed the streak of white hair back to brown.
Harry eventually fell asleep, tired from all the thoughts circling him.
“Shut up, you suck at compliments,” Draco said, but both of them knew that Draco secretly loved it. They walked out of the dorm - holding hands - and into the Slytherin Common Room, where Pansy was seated, reading a book. She looked up and saw Harry and smirked as if she was expecting Harry to be with Draco.
“You don’t get it. I spent so long feeling so horrible that I’ll never actually be able to hear your voice. I don’t need to know if it works or not,” he chewed on his lip, hands trembling as Draco gently handed it to him. “Draco, we don’t know if it’ll work. It was dark magic, whatever happened.”
Draco’s face was paler than usual; and Pansy was practically force-feeding him. “Come on, I’m not your mother, Draco!” she complained. “Are you going to tell me what happened or just sit here like a baby?”
“Dray?” Draco asked with a short laugh.
“Your point, Parkinson?”
“Umm… Draco, a word?” Hermione said, glancing over at Astoria. Nodding, he walked into what was probably Ron’s room. Shutting the door behind them, Hermione turned to Draco. “You
“Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t,” Harry whispered to himself as he felt tears welling up in his eyes.
It echoed in his head. The words went into his brain. But he couldn’t register it. His heart stopped, and his body practically jolted upright.
“So, that’s it? The first time I see you smile in months; genuinely smile, and you’re letting go of him already?”
“Wha- how do you know about-”
Draco frowned, unsure of what to say. He was holding himself back, unsure if it was from hugging Harry or crying. Either way, he shook his head. “I can’t take this, Harry,” he said quietly.
“Your job is to look for Harry Potter.”
“Try again,” he urged. “That can’t have been a one time thing, right?”
He took out the note from his pocket, holding it up somewhat accusingly. “The poem. It’s beautiful. You ought to give it to the girl who you wrote about. Rather than sending it to me. I don’t really like getting poems meant for someone else.”
Suddenly, either everyone was getting back to their goodbyes, or walking up to Harry. They were shaking his hand, some even hugging him, all talking at once. Harry noticed that even Hermione and Ron were getting bombarded; though the only difference was that Ron actually seemed to be enjoyed the attention, while Hermione and Harry simply awkwardly stood there.
“It doesn’t work like that, Harry, not with you and me. We don’t have the liberty of having a normal relationship,” he mumbled. “We can’t break up when we feel like it, and then apologize when we want to get back together. I thought this was clear.”
“It’s fine,” Draco managed to say.
“Obviously, I’ll go with him,” Astoria smiled. “I’ve always wanted to stay in America anyway. I think it’ll be good to get away from Malfoy Manor. Mr. Malfoy can be a bit… overwhelming.”
Harry turned to Hermione and Ron, who winced. He tried not to cringe in embarrassment. Well, of course those two would want to work together. Who would want to work with the deaf kid? “Er… alright, Harry, I’ll work with you,” Hermione said, but the look on her face made it seem like she was being asked to do a chore.
Draco quickly reached for his sweater and put it on as Harry scratched the back of his neck awkwardly. “Sorry, were we being too loud? I was sure we put a
“Ouch.”
“Why are you doing that?” Draco whispered. He was afraid to ask because he knew Harry would stop as soon as he did, but it was weird. Odd. Almost made what Blaise had accused true.
“It’s going to kill you,” Harry’s voice cracked.
“Well… I didn't say yes, but… I didn’t exactly say no, either.”
********
“I’m sorry,” Draco said.
“Nothing, nothing… just…” Harry paused, running a hand through his hair. “Have you seen Draco?”
Narcissa returned with the family owl, Dodger. She placed him on the table.
Pansy and Draco exchanged glances, both going near the door so they could listen better. From the looks of it, the roles had been reversed.
to me at Christmas,” he raised an eyebrow, to which Harry just shook his head.
“I’m sorry?”
Silence.
On Monday, Draco and Harry had no time to meet after classes. After desperately trying to find time for each other, they realized that they didn’t have time on weekdays.
“Oh, look who’s talking. ‘NOTHING HAPPENED LAST NIGHT, SHUT UP, I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING.’” Draco imitated Harry right back, sitting up and rolling his eyes.
Everyone stared as silence fell once again.
“Like?”
“I said I’m
“You were watching their conversation too?” Draco asked, looking at her somewhat accusingly.
Harry’s eyes widened slightly. “That’s a bit…”
Draco looked at her with a deadpan expression, shaking his head at her, but he couldn’t deny it. “...I dunno,” he said finally, chewing on the inside of his cheek nervously. But the answer was yes.
“You’ve been grinning all day, you know,” Hermione said as she noticed Harry smiling to himself again as they entered the train. “It’s a bit alarming, actually.”
Harry laughed in response. “A little too deep.” he paused, then looked up. “Can we not tell anyone, by the way?”
“You know,” she shrugged, “you’ve not been happy the past few months. But sometimes you get these waves of temporary happiness. And it feels like everything’s going to be okay again.”
“I would, if you stop being a brat,” Harry grabbed the WSL book from his hands, flipping through the pages. “Alright, so I’m guessing you’d probably want to talk about Hogwarts to your relative. I’m still pretty rusty on signing the terms, but I think you ought to learn it. You might as well go all in rather than just learn random bits of the language. Who knows, maybe you’ll encounter more deaf wizards in the future.”
He looked at the envelope in his hand, raising an eyebrow. “You’re… inviting me to your wedding?”
“I thought you said Nargles live in mistletoes?” Harry asked after everyone stared at her for a few seconds. Pansy rolled her eyes and grabbed the waffle from Harry’s hand, biting into it. “Hey! That was ours!”
“Then he was right to break up with you. Of course, the way he handled the situation was horrible and childish, but I’m sure his intentions were good. He just didn’t want you to be hurt.”
“Uh… pardon?” Harry asked. A confused Draco looked up at Snape who was looking at him. Snape gave Draco a stern look before turning to Harry again.
“Oh, no, nothing like that, love,” she sighed. “I just wanted to know… did you actually intend to kill Dumbledore that night? Snape told me about your hesitation. He said it must be due to your inexperience, however… I know you haven’t been a perfect boy, but… you’re not a killer.”
“Draco,” Harry muttered under his breath, looking up at the sky, the green skull with a serpent tongue, hanging right above the Hogwarts castle.
He stayed in the hospital wing for a few days, insisting that he was getting a bad stomach ache. Madame Pomfrey was too tired of his whining to do anything about it, telling her he needed to stay in the hospital wing.
“I think, if you want to be saved from Death Eater duty, you better go,” she smiled at him warmly. “Okay?”
“Harry,” he said in a soft voice. They both felt the music die down, dissolving into a calm yet tense silence in the atmosphere. “I’m sorry. I was only joking.”
Pansy turned to Harry after watching Draco go inside his dorm, “Did something happen between the two of you?”
Draco answered by pushing him down on the bed and meeting Harry’s lips again, undoing the top button of his shirt. The fact that they were at a party didn’t seem to matter much to them anymore, and it didn’t seem as if anyone was actually missing them.
“I’m sure it was hard to be a pure-blood and welcomed into the Malfoy family lovingly,” Harry said loudly, then put a hand to his mouth. Everyone stared at him in disbelief, except Draco, who seemed like he was trying to stifle his amusement. “Er… sorry. I didn’t mean it like that.”
“When did you become friends?”
Harry simply shrugged, pulling Draco into a kiss, wrapping his arms to hold Draco up, their tongues dancing in each other’s mouth as Harry slowly moved towards the desk table, setting Draco down on the table, starting to kiss his neck, biting at it to leave a mark.
“Talk it out,” Harry repeated with a scoff, still staring at Draco. “Yeah, I really don’t think so.”
She blinked in confusion, placing a gentle hand on his shoulder. “You don’t think Harry will say yes?”
Exasperated, he finally replied, “well, I am not listening.”
hello hello! so sorry for the late update but... i think this is sort of what works for me! updating every *few* weeks. i've also kind of been stumped as to where this fanfic should go. i have many ideas, but writer's block can be super frustrating!
“Calm down, you two,” Ron said, stepping in between them. “Harry, the important thing is, do you regret saying no to him?”
Harry frowned. “You’re… using the Room of Requirement for your… homework?”
“Granger, I hope you realize there
“Hey Draco,” Harry greeted, not looking up from the book he was reading. He was huddled up in blankets on the couch.
Harry had no answer for that. “Where the hell is my Invisibility Cloak?” he asked, quickly changing the subject. He dumped his clothes back in the trunk, closing it and sighing as he started looking for it under his pillow and on his bedside table.
After an exhaustive yet somewhat informative conversation with Kreacher, they all went to sleep, deciding to stay at Grimmauld Place until they figured out their next move. He was out like a log the first night, because he was tired.
“This last summer break… well, it was horrible, Harry.” Draco said slowly. “They made me go looking for you, at the Grimmauld Place. I went to the door but didn’t go inside. I stayed there for a good twenty minutes before going back and saying that you weren’t there.”
lose our lives. Is it really worth the risk?”
He averted his gaze to Draco, who cleared his throat. “I’m thirsty. I don’t suppose I could just ask for some tea?” he asked, to which Harry simply shrugged. The two stared at the table in front of them, and suddenly, two cups of piping hot tea appeared. Draco picked up one of them and set it closer to Harry’s reach. “Drink up. I asked for chamomile.”
“Aggressive much,” Ron mumbled, taking out his wand. “There, happy? It’s less noticeable.”
“Yeah, well just take it,” Harry folded his arms. “I don’t want it.”
“I dunno… I feel his pain sometimes… and it hurts so much,” he whispered. “And it’s not the same with Astoria, because… she and I both know we don’t love each other, it’s just…” he buried his face in his hands, groaning loudly. “I miss him.”
Harry needed less training and it wasn’t as if Draco had much time, so their Saturdays were gone too. Now it was just the Friday evenings, that sometimes one of them wouldn’t even show up to, because they got too busy with other things. Harry with Dumbledore, and Draco with - well. It didn’t need to be said.
“No! No, I want you to know. In case… in case anything happens. You need to know that I’m on your side. You know that, right?”
“Yeah, there’s no way you’re going for a walk now,” Hermione told him. “You need to calm down, I’m on your side here.”
of course,” Pansy said with a shrug, sitting down on Draco’s bed and grinning. “Anyways, I know you’ve been avoiding me since Saturday. Did the date not go well?”
“I’m injured,” he said dramatically, putting a hand to his forehead. “I know it’s surprising to hear, but even I, Draco Malfoy, can’t be perfect at everything. I’m better at it than most, of course, but no, not perfect.”
hope you like this
That evening, Harry quickly changed into his Quidditch uniform before getting out into the field to practice.
“Don’t blame yourself,” Harry whispered slowly. “Please don’t.”
“Clearly you haven’t seen our living room,” Draco rolled his eyes, but the two were smiling. He sighed when he noticed the time on his watch. “I have to get going, but…”
At night, thoughts of Harry consumed him. Was this the right choice? Was Pansy right? What he knew was that this was bigger than him. It was something out of his control.
“Is he?” Pansy asked, grimacing.
“I’m not particularly satisfied that my first kiss was my dead-friend’s-ex-girlfriend who also happened to be
The quill scratched against the piece of paper, his grip tight. Finishing off the letter, Harry tied it up and handed it to his owl, Hedwig Jr. Sighing, he watched as the owl flew out the window, well on his way to Mrs. Weasley, agreeing to go to their home for dinner.
He pushed his hand off, fuming as he moved back, looking down at him. “That’s not something you should be joking about!”
“No, it’s not that,” he shook his head. “I’m just not sure about exploring when… I feel weird around this one person.”
“Harry, let’s go outside,” Hermione said as soon as she noticed, guiding him to the backyard. Clutching his stomach, his face had gone completely white. “You okay, Harry?”
Deep down, Harry knew. Harry knew who exactly who it was.
Harry pushed his curls out of his eyes, pulling up his trousers, smiling at everyone, eyes almost sliding past Draco, who was looking over at Pansy. Almost. His eyes stopped searching the room. They finally stopped searching the room for the silver eyes, for the smile - for the touch. The person who made him feel like home was here.
“What if it works, Harry?” Draco frowned. “What if you’ll actually be able to hear me?”
“Ah well, I hoped that not showing up would please him dearly,” Draco muttered to himself. Lucius didn’t hear what he said properly and decided to ignore it.
“Stole, Pansy. You stole from her.”
“I don’t think it’s him,” Draco said in less than a whisper.
She knew that he was anything but fine.
“Yes, mother, you’re right. Must be so hard being right under the Dark Lord’s wing.”
Harry was speaking so fast that he didn’t even bother to sign, his face starting to turn red. He didn’t know if he was even comprehensible, but he didn’t care.
“We could go on about this all night. It was both of our faults, okay? I’m okay, aren’t I? And I forgive you. And I love you, and I know you’ll never do it again. Don’t worry, okay? No one blames you.”
He’d make it to some random Muggle’s place, then leave before the sun came out. This had been his routine for so long. Most of the times he’d end up ditching the person before they even did anything.
“He read your mind?!” Harry asked.
Hypocrite. A huge, huge, hypocrite, Harry was. But he felt as if someone had just torn his chest open, pulled his heart out, and put it back inside, leaving a huge, open wound.
Even Draco seemed surprised by what he was saying. “I just mean… it’s not unreasonable for you to feel this way. And not unreasonable for you to need a break.”
Harry could feel it; something was so terribly wrong. It was making his insides lurch. It was making his chest tighten, and his heart sink every time he imagined a worse and worse scenario about what’s happened to Draco. His left cheek was hurting, for some odd reason.
There it was. Harry slowly turned around, smiling bitterly at Lucius. “Pardon?” he asked in a sweet voice, trying to be the bigger person and let Lucius take back what he said.
“Why did you two fight?” he asked. “I’ve… never seen you look so hurt before. I was worried. Again, like I said, not my place.”
“I didn’t mean
“The hell is that?” Draco asked, a confused expression on his face.
“What’s up?” Harry asked, starting to feel a bit impatient.
“You’re worth the risk,” Draco said while signing, making sure what he said got across fully.
Harry parted ways with Ron and Hermione, going to sit in the front of the class, joining Draco who was already seated.
“Well, we walked past the whole Forbidden Forest and there was this empty area with just grass all around. We sat down there and ate the Muggle snacks you gave me. You put in a Muggle device on purpose, didn’t you?”
“I’d-” Draco twirled him around, but all of a sudden, Harry slipped over the floor because of his socks, causing him to fall backwards onto the ground. “Oh my God, Harry-”
Harry scoffed. “What a nice way of trying to save my feelings.”
The agreement between Draco and Harry was that they would continue to insult each other, but keep their friends out of it, in the risk of saying something that could possibly start something. That way, they were making it believable enough without causing issues between the friend groups.
“Draco, this is not easy for anyone. We’re in a dark time,” she said, frowning at her son.
“Yes!” he jumped up excitedly. “I can hear myself. I can hear you!”
“I love you,” Harry blurted.
She squeezed his shoulder gently. “It’s okay. Let me get you something to drink and we can talk about it more.”
“Since when do you care about Malfoy?” Ron asked with a raised eyebrow.
“Oh, come on, Granger, I’m smarter than to be caught by anyone,” Draco folded his arms.
“Harry, I’ve been meaning to talk to you,” She said, slowly walking over to where he was lying.
“I don’t know what to think,” he shook his head. “I just… want you to be prepared if the marriage actually… takes place.”
“Draco,” Harry had managed to choke out, “what if it i...isn’t?” Draco looked up at Hermione and Ron, a panicked expression on his face. He felt his shirt dampening as Harry buried his face into Draco’s chest.
He slowly entered the Hall to see that Draco wasn’t there. He frowned but didn’t let it bother him. He made his way to Ron and Hermione who weren’t arguing for once. He sat down and started eating.
Harry felt his chest sink deeper as he sat in the Eighth Year Common Room. He looked over at Pansy who was reading a book beside him, unsure if he should ask her where Draco was.
He quickly cast
“Still,” he urged. “I’m sorry.”
He pushed Draco backwards. “You’re so infuriating,” he rolled his eyes, standing up. “Alright, then, come at me. You have the clear upper hand here.”
She shook her head at him, then sighed. She had meddled enough. She didn’t want Draco to get mad, nor did she want to pressure him into anything  “Well… if you feel that’s best, then I suppose I support that.”
“Barty Crouch Jr.,” Harry corrected. “How would you rate my dancing skills on a scale from one to ten?”
By the time their kiss had turned passionate, filled with desire and hope, the warmth had clawed its way back to their hearts, as if it was always meant to stay there. Just as Harry was directing the two of them to the bed, there was a knock on the door.
“I’m concerned,” Harry said as he held onto Draco tightly, putting a fearful hand to his blindfold. “You’ve taken away the only sense I can depend on! What’s the point of this?”
“Well, for one, you look like you’re going to vomit, and two, I can read you like an open book,” Hermione said, shutting her book and going to sit beside Harry. “What’s up?”
“No,” Draco said. “Should I?”
Hermione and Ron shifted uncomfortably in their spot, exchanging glances. They hadn’t even thought about how Harry must have been feeling, about going back to Hogwarts, about the war, how he could be feeling.
Draco shook his head as he sat down on the table at the front of the classroom, the table which was closest to Snape’s desk. “None.”
“I didn’t see the whole thing. Who’s D?” he raised an eyebrow, smirking. “Are there any Gryffindors that have a name from D?” he gasped. “Is it Dean?”
“Fuck you, Harry! Stop making things harder than they already are!” shouted Draco. “Haven’t you done enough to me?”
When their heated make-out session was over, Draco fixed his shirt and rolled his eyes, muttering something about Harry not giving him a proper hickey as he opened the door, looking around before quickly slipping out, and Harry exiting a few moments later as if nothing had happened.
“Hold on,” Hermione interjected, glaring. “What’s all this about?”
Harry, who hadn’t noticed that Draco was there, jumped slightly when he heard him speak, looking up. Harry’s eyes widened as he quickly wiped his tears away. “Draco, I…” He didn’t know what to say. What could he do? Apologize for his deepest, darkest fear was Draco being evil and not loving him this whole time? “The Boggart came out of nowhere, and-”
The woman that appeared the oldest went first. Dark hair was pulled back into a severe bun, making her sharp features all the more intimidating. She said her name was Debra. The other woman, Élise, wore a black hijab. A good looking black guy was named Dean, and the man next to him was Seamus. He remembered those names.
“What? Am I so miserable I don’t even like doing
“Fine,” Harry snapped. He didn’t need another reminder that he wasn’t who he was supposed to be.
“Draco – “
“Trick stair?” Ron teased, looking at her feet. She made an irritated noise.
“I suppose so. I haven’t tested it too far.”

Ron mumbled something that sounded similar, and they popped off into nothingness.
The owl just clicked its beak impatiently. Harry sighed, giving him a few more cubes. He had a feeling who this letter was from, and he was both extremely eager and dreading to read it. He would have to reply, and then the jig was up, wasn’t it?

It was…nice. More than nice. Ron and Hermione clearly loved him. He found himself wondering if he deserved it.

“Interhouse unity!” He hissed. Ron scoffed.

“January.” He stepped back. “The last lunar cycle for this potion.”

Draco’s lips parted, then pressed closed. His eyes were still leaking at intervals.
Harry exhaled, meeting his eyes. “That’s horrible. I’m so sorry.”
“He doesn’t. Still took them off me easy enough, though. What are you doing?”
Harry wound his fingers together in his lap so he wouldn’t tap them against the wood. He understood that the war had been bad, but did it really need so much ceremony? It had been ten

He turned back, thinking. This whole university was Illusioned. It existed, but couldn’t be seen from the outside. The lower panel slid up soundlessly, letting a burst of cold air that blew his hair about as he stuck his head out.
So Harry told him things. Maybe…maybe he wouldn’t be too shocked by this. Relatively speaking.

Harry took a step back, wondering what this might look like. He’d promised Ron he would stay out of their fight, and not feed into whatever dependence linked him to Hermione.

“No, no. You knew before.” He looked down at his tea. “I knew it wouldn’t be a big deal if I told you, because…you’re sort of – “
Draco frowned, at the question or the taste of the tea.
“We don’t have to talk to each other. You don’t even have to sit near me. But I could get you in.”
Harry stepped into her circle and let her grasp one of his hands. When he raised his wand and copied her incantations, the wards shimmered into view. It was like opening a second set of eyes; swirling layers of blue and green auras over the walls and floors.
“Ron doesn’t
Ron gasped. The voice cut off.
It did sound great, Harry thought as he wrote to tell Teddy. Great and terrible all at once.

Draco glanced up, looked surprised for a split-second, then grit his teeth. “I need quiet.”
“Hello, erm, snake,” he said. Hagrid gave him a bewildered look.
“What if you can’t fix me?” Harry asked compulsively. She closed her eyes for a moment.
“You got it in your head that you couldn’t start living until every Death Eater was captured – “
Ron’s eyes widened when his next
The room was huge. Golden arches spanned over his head, and above them a series of glass lifts rose and fell leisurely. People and creatures alike moved past windows overlooking for at least twelve levels. At the center of the large space was a fountain. Clear spouts of water shot out of a golden statue. He wasn’t sure what it was meant to be. Amorphous limbs and curves stuck out of a central blob.
Hagrid’s eyes moved up. “He’s been a’right, so long as I keep ‘im fed. Had Butch out catching mice fer ‘im.”
and weighing it in his hands. It was larger than Hermione’s book, but much lighter. He needed to get home. There was a mountain of paperwork Ron left for him to sign off on, and Todrick probably couldn’t find this place to deliver a letter from Teddy if it came.
She laughed. “Well, you should be glad they’re keeping it so secret. Do you know the

There was a knock on the main door. Everyone froze for a second. Ron shot up and moved past Harry with a hand on his back, pushing him gently toward the head of the table.
“I’m – I’m sorry, mate. I’m really mucking up my first impression, yeah?”
and held it ridiculously high in front of her face. "Oh, come off it. I can still see you."
Harry pulled a knee up, facing him. This was what he had wanted to hear, all those weeks ago, when he’d asked Draco what he was like.
She was like something out of a story book, the same book as Hogwarts. They weren’t exactly robes she was wearing, but a filmy, draping beryl-blue dress. The stitching was white and all over – stars, maybe. Or birds. Her hair was blonde and wavy almost down to her knees. Purple flowers were braided at intervals. Large blue eyes lined in silver blinked owlishly down at him.
“I find him quite nice to talk to,” he pressed. Ron set his jaw.
“Not this week. I think your mum was getting anxious. What's going on? Where is everyone?”
not understanding?
“Seed.” Draco Summoned a small glass vial, like the one he’d taken Veritaserum from. This one was full of a swirling blue almost-liquid. Memory. “Here.” He looked highly uncomfortable as he handed it over to Hermione’s waiting palm. “It’s not pleasant, Granger, I warn you.”
“I was just gonna ask if you could give me your least boring book.”
“I’m trying to find a way to get rid of it without resorting to amputation.” He shut his eyes as he said it, his eyebrows drawing together sharply.
and despite the lack of portraits he thought he felt eyes on his back.
“Nearly there,” he said out loud, patting his pocket. When he got back to his house, he set his bags down and took the bubble out. It felt hard like glass, but shimmered like soap. He turned up his central heating and Levitated it to the carpet.
“No,” she breathed. “He’s at Hogwarts right now. Just left two weeks ago, actually.”
Ron’s smile faded.
snake! I didn’t even – “
, he slid a hand into his pants. His flaccid cock just barely twitched as he pulled a hand up over it. People did this, didn’t they? And it would certainly put him to sleep. The urge had been there the past few days, particularly in the mornings. He’d staunchly ignored all of them.
Draco turned around, cheekbones sharp in relief from the window light. “Preservation magic. Keeps them intact – “
“Tell him…tell him that Transfiguration is bonkers on purpose, and he’ll look smart if he never questions it. As for Hagrid, I think he likes it when the little ones are scared - he’ll never admit it, though. You’ll be of no use to him with potions, and Zabini probably does have it out for him…tell Ted to bring up our sixth year Quidditch match where he tried a Wronskey and ended up taking out an entire stand. “
“HERE COMES THE GRYFFINDORS,” boomed the other student, amplifying her voice further by actually just yelling into her wand. “THEY’VE PRACTICED DAY AND NIGHT FOR WEEKS, READY TO TAKE BACK THE CUP THEY LOST LAST YEAR, AND HERE COME OUR FORMER SCHOOL CHAMPIONS  – “
“It didn’t work,” Hermione said pointedly. “Why?”
“You were famous, and well-liked. Adored, actually. I resented it, because all who adored you turned against me.
reason any young people ever come out here. Without me, they’d all be at Side Ward or K. Atty Corner. It’s all…clothing shops and potion supplies out here. Old people stuff.”
Slowly, his surroundings filtered past. Rain pounded onto him where he lay, sprawled out in the mud. All of him was soaking wet, but the moisture on his stomach was warm and thick. He pressed his hand to it, gritting his teeth and forcing himself to his feet. As he tried to sit up, things only got worse. Dizzy nausea joined the sharp pain.
“Oh, you – !”
There was a twinge of something, behind the tiredness. It must have been jealousy. Harry couldn’t imagine this type of situation could possibly cause any other emotion in someone in Ron’s position.
When he said that, something disrupted the studious calm over her face. But she schooled it quickly away. “Middle name?”
"I doubt he knows you're brain dead," George said, looking it over. "He probably just means the Ministry business."
“I don’t wanna choose sides,” he said. “And it’s not my place, besides.”
Ron still had on his work robes. He hadn’t gone home. “I asked if you were up for a pint.”
Minerva stopped, eyes on Harry as she handed him his cloak. In all his gallivanting around, he'd completely forgotten about it. “Have you all you need from my school today, gentlemen?”
Ron pried her away from a thoroughly reprimanded Harry. “Let him
“Fine, then, just…” Ron and Teddy shared an excited look. “Just be Harry Potter, you know?”
“I’ve been hanging around the Auror office, but…It feels like I’m just dead weight, at the moment.”
carved into a cupola will ensure acoustically perfect dimensions.”
“How,” Harry said, interrupting her rapid flow of words. “Will I carry on a conversation with anyone without them realizing something’s not on?”
“Really? Which one?” He wracked his mind, like the new addition would suddenly present itself. “Was it about Teddy?”
He weighed the broom in his hands, then looked up at the sky. “Fairly good at this, am I? I’m not going to fall?”
“You checked all of his references?”
“Thank you, Luna,” Hermione said with thinly veiled impatience. “I will take that into account.”
“What does it sound like?”
Harry looked over, where Hermione’s back had gone very straight as she made them both a plate. “About what?”
“It’s a time turner,” she murmured, tucking it inside her clothes again. “They used to be standard fare for Unspeakables. Any qualified Ministry worker could apply for one. But…we destroyed their supply in fifth year.”
Hermione wasn’t one to forget things. It meant a lot that she could be so optimistic about Draco.
“Hello, Edward,” she said without looking away.
Harry knew Ron was talking to himself more than anything, but he was starting to feel guilty. “I can come in, you know. If you need me, or need another body, It’s not like I’m - “
it hissed.
“Would you take lunch in my office?”
“No.”
“I can’t do this alone,” she said, composure breaking as her lower lip wobbled. “Not any longer. Not after – “
Draco chewed his lower lip, which Harry tried not to notice. “No. It should be cloudy.”
It was a long tour. Harry didn’t actually need to do that much talking – Reena and Teddy traded stories with gusto. Classes, a poltergeist named Peeves that regularly disrupted them (?), and general mayhem that surrounded a castle-full of magical teenagers. The two of them shared a dislike of Zabini, but got on fairly well with other Slytherins. There was a note of pride in Teddy’s voice as he said that.
“Everything,” Harry said, relieved his voice didn’t crack. “I’m sorry, but when I woke up I didn’t even know my own name.”
“Maybe it was a rendezvous.”
stopwatch.”
Ron sat up suddenly, completely serious. “Please tell me you know what that means.”
But they could argue about that later. “You said you’ve been researching.”
“Isn’t that a good thing?”
Harry did. They descended the stairs and walked out into the late afternoon of Grimmauld Place. Christmas lights sparkled in the distance.
He heard it clearly in her voice – if Harry had woken up as himself, then it wouldn’t have mattered. But he hadn’t. Did that mean he was going to have to tell this boy that his own father didn’t remember him?
“I plan to,” he said, quite seriously. Minerva nodded and held out her arm. Teddy took it, raising his eyebrows suggestively at Harry. He grinned back, imagining the  prestige that came with this sort of invitation. His friends would be impressed.
For a tray, he picked up something long and flat that leaned on the top of a Baker’s rack. It, too, looked priceless, made of gilded gold and adorned with twisting, balustrade strips of iron. More of a torture device than a breakfast apparatus. He turned to start loading the mugs, realizing he wasn’t alone. A burning pulse of adrenaline nearly had him grabbing at his wand. Draco was so quiet – and it was of no help how skeletal he looked in the harsh light.
“Why are you sorry?” None of this was
. It wasn’t too much of a leap, in his opinion, to put it together: he must have wanted a pet snake for a while, and waited for Teddy to go away to try and…train one? If they could even be trained, that was. Why he needed an illegal, cross-bred cobra was a little tougher to answer.
“The time turner,” he said. Harry nodded. “Well, what do you think?”
Faint numbers appeared above his face. Harry had to discern them at a backwards angle.
“S’okay, mate. I already know,” Ron said softly, nudging his shoulder.
“Wait – “
“Which part of this is new to you?”
Because she so looked about to keel over, he did just that.
it read. The script was childlike, looping and halting.
Harry stepped back as soon as it seemed appropriate, bidding them goodnight. Hermione’s lip was trembling again as he shut the door, and he felt bad about it, but he needed to be alone.
like it.”
“How’d he take it?” Ron asked lowly as they crossed the large space.
“You’re joking.”
as he walked up the steps, ducking out of the way of a herd of sailing paper thestrals.
Harry tried to look calm and confident, two emotions in very short supply this week. He cast a silent
He felt his mouth fall open a bit as he scrambled to cope with this subject. The simple fact that he was unbalanced only unbalanced him
“Hey, Harry,” he said, crossing his arms.
“Erm,” Harry said.
“Are we married?” He blurted.
“I’m fine.” Teddy cleared his throat. “Aunt Hermione will fix it.”
“I’ll read it later,” Ron said, less irritable than Harry would have expected. “At first glance, it looks like Horcrux – “
“You already asked me – “ His eyes did the fluttering thing again. “No. If he was, Potter would be dead. I probably would, too.”
Harry blinked at his wistfulness. “You’re a Falcons man?”
His strange looks from the night before. Harry leaned forward. “Yeah?”
After all that, it was only late afternoon. Anxiety settled at the bottom of his stomach watching the sun sink lower. He re-read Teddy’s most recent letter – a four page account of Halloween weekend at Hogwarts. The ghosts had put on a performance of Macbeth and McGonagall had organized a massive scavenger hunt in the dungeons. Of course, those two events got a paragraph each and the other three and a half pages were an account of the dinner spread. Harry marked down what Teddy appeared to like the most. He’d look for a recipe book the next time he was in Diagon.
The pitch loomed high above, the raised stands billowing behind maroon and green banners. It was a cloudy morning without too much sunlight, contrasting as sharply against the colors as they did against each other. They couldn’t see inside from this vantage point but it was clearly a full house. Not even the railing wind could cover the sound of that many voices.
She bit her lip, burrowing down into her jumper. “Shacklebolt
The shops were closed, but the restaurants and candy shops were still open, mingling crowds of young adults standing near the windows.
Ron looked up with a thoughtful expression. “We could go there, if you like? Maybe a new Boggart settled in we could take care of.”
Harry sprinkled curry powder over the sizzling chicken. “Six.”
If she fixed him tomorrow, would he thank himself for wasting this time? Time where he could recklessly follow his impulses without the years of baggage holding him back. Time to
“Word? About me?” He thought about it, picking at his food. Hermione had asked him to come into Mysteries again earlier in the week. He had refused. “No.”
“And I’m sure you know not to mention to anyone that Draco is staying here.”
“Is it?” Harry looked out, failing to see either of the teams on the ground. Ron filed in to his right. Hermione was still going around talking to the professors.
. We’ve been waiting for him to step out of line for years. And no one wanted to bother
Harry smiled, feeling trapped, until eventually Ron cleared his throat. Mahmoud blinked and released Harry’s hand.
had a Jack-O-Lantern wreath stuck to its door. As he walked past, a pumpkin pasty shot out of the crooked mouth, hitting him in the chest. He picked it up, moving past
“Well – yes?”
Harry was still at a loss for words. There was a rapid, exponential rise in volume from the crowd that had him spinning to look. But the teams still weren’t out. He looked around at ground level, confused.
Harry gasped awake, sitting up so fast his shoulder protested loud and clear. A matching pain shot through his ankle. He sucked in sweet air, lungful after lungful.
“So he’s a…coworker?” Harry asked tentatively. Hermione looked heartbroken for a second, then seemed to collect herself.
Potter.”
“Yes, as a matter of fact. But we don’t have – “
Harry resisted an eyeroll, wondering what it would take for Draco to stop asking him that every time he showed up. “I was worried.”
“Oh yeah? One time Marcus Flint – “
“Great, actually.”
He looked genuinely confused. “What?”
Harry looked up. “I didn’t think you knew Draco at all.”
“What’s he
Greenbaum’s eyebrows shot up. “That’s definitely something.”
, still finding a bit of silliness to it that no one else seemed to. “You might have some insight as to what happened to me.”
It was quiet aside from bubbling, but Harry was unsettled. He’d been thrown in here by some accident, yes, but there was something else going on. The place was…different.
Draco sat up sharply, eyes still closed, brow pinched. “Don’t touch anything.”
The envelope hit the shield hard, bursting into flame. The doors slid shut just as a shrill voice boomed through reception. They flinched against the sheer volume of it, backs hitting the wall.
“Right. With Castor. What’s it been, now, five weeks?”
Writing paternal instincts/feelings is, like, really hard. Thanks for reading!
“Take it off,” he said, very quietly. Harry stepped back, alarmed.
“Anyway, now there’s just this one. I made it myself.”
Draco set his jaw. "Of course it is."
“By all means.” Mahmoud stood. Ron’s shoulder brushed Harry’s once as they both got to their feet, then again with purpose. Harry cleared his throat.
He thought he could escape when everyone began shuffling to the Floo or outside to Apparate. Only Percy remained, finishing off the bottle with Arthur.
“I have my ways, Ron. You don’t make it through a war without picking up a thing or two.”
. It was ridiculous and camp and he should have hated it.
Draco pulled his arm free and shoved Harry sideways, toward the kitchen.
“Of course,” Harry said quickly.
His mouth dropped open. “And what am I to say?”
All too soon, it seemed, Ron found them back in the Common Room. Teddy was showing off the wizarding chess set Harry had gifted him earlier that year. The animated pieces killed each other with brute force, reforming themselves once the game was over.
“It’s just…easier? You haven’t heard mum go on about wanting grandchildren.”
“Well…” Ron scrunched his face up. “Don’t tell ‘Mione I said this, but I think she’s convinced she’ll fix you. And I don’t doubt she will, but it might take a while. If you don’t have your memories by the weekend…”
“I was thinking chicken sandwiches.” He started pulling the items needed from the fridge, feeling George’s stare on his back. “Are you hungry?”
When she pulled away, she was smiling again. “You…are exactly the type.”
“What?!” George yelled, throwing his hands up. “That’s
Draco looked up, making a furious motion with his hand that clearly meant
I’m not sure she meant that as a good thing.”
Ron snorted. “I wouldn’t get away with it.”
, and all she’d ever had was fears.
“Probably planning an
“Here,” he said a few minutes later. Harry turned left, into the narrow alleyway. Something invisible brushed against his hand.
Hermione came up the stairs at a jog, clutching her purse against her chest, hair in disarray. “Where is he?”
“I think you know.”
If Dolohov had seen him then, it meant he’d been in London for a while. Wearing a different face. Harry had been out, a lot. He’d never been attacked, or even noticed anyone watching him the wrong way on muggle streets.
“Why?”
“Carys is with him now. We prepared oolong for Mistress but he prefers mint. Do we have fresh mint?”
hello hello hello!! long time no see! thank you for loving and enjoying this fic, all of you have inspired me to write again!!
Of course he had to sit beside Harry. Of course today had to be the first time they met after over a year. Of course today had to become more difficult than it had to be because their two friends had decided it would be funny if they sat right. Fucking. Next to each other. Draco had only one thought running through his head at that moment.
She shook her head. “
“What is?” Ron asked as they entered the Hall. Harry was about to answer but his eyes went and fixated on Draco.
“I don’t know how I can help you if I don’t know who you’re going on a date with, but sure.”
I don’t even love him anymore. I just want to be able to explain to him what happened,” Draco pleaded. “I just need you to undo the curse. What if we run into each other and he gets severely injured?”
“Good. I’m glad that we’ve come to terms that you ruined everything.” Draco said. “You ruined everything.” He repeated.
“Harry? Harry, come
“Malfoy?” she finished, flabbergasted. “Is he the one who kept sending you those love letters?”
Five minutes to midnight, Harry was seated at his desk, staring at the clock. Sighing, he adjusted his t-shirt and looked down at his homework that he had finally decided to do, but was nowhere near finishing.
“I heard you’ve been getting special lessons from Dumbledore,” Draco raised an eyebrow. “Teacher’s pet, are we?”
“I don’t know,” he answered truthfully. “We spent a whole day together yet I didn’t feel sick or get hurt even once… Maybe it was just a normal headache. I seriously don’t want to think about it right now.”
“No, I’m not,” he shook his head. “I was way out of line. I guess it was because I felt offended when you told me to shut up or whatever. Either way, I’m sorry.”
He watched him reach for the door, and at the last moment, he spoke. “If I was in Harry’s place…”
“Oh, what do you know,” Draco spluttered. “Besides, that was only a way to get your attention.”
“Oh grow up!” Pansy said, sticking her tongue out at Harry, who scoffed.
“Sleep,” Harry said. He stopped writing and set his quill down, adjusting himself before patting his empty lap. “You need it.” Draco raised an eyebrow, but crawled onto Harry’s lap, resting his head on his left shoulder. Harry used his left arm to hold Draco, and his other to start writing again.
Ron rolled his eyes, and they continued eating.
“You’re so fucking dramatic,” Harry rolled his eyes, but he was grinning. He stood up, watching Draco adjust his watch, trying to resist the urge to kiss him. He couldn’t believe all it took was one night for all the feelings to come back like an adrenaline rush. “I’ll owl you.”
“Thank you,” Harry sighed, moving to sit on the bed. Draco, who still had his hands on him, followed. “I wouldn’t want to be caught in the first place I’ve been hiding. That’d be quite a failure.”
pain in the ass,” Harry winked, grinning widely and fiddling with his necklace. “Good luck. I can’t even stand myself sometimes. I’m being a hundred percent serious-”
“I don’t think he minds,” he bit his lip. “Also, it wasn’t as if he specified what the poem had to be about. Besides...he can interpret the poem however he wants to.”
They stared at each other in silence.
He felt a warm tingle in his chest as he stood up, blinking in confusion, turning to Astoria, who had just entered the room.
Pansy, who was waiting for Draco to pack up, caught Harry’s eye, who winced. She gave him a subtle nod. He chewed on his bottom lip, slowly walked out the classroom and waited by the door.
Luckily, Narcissa Malfoy had managed to put the conversation in a different direction.
I'll try to make the next chapter longer :)
“Draco, don’t do that.”
“Bullshit,” Draco whispered, “You know the Boggart’s the same. Whether you’re prepared for it or not.”
Draco sucked in a sharp breath, cursing under his breath. Guilt and resentment flooded his chest. Feeling Harry’s eyes on him, he tried to seem calm, but Harry had noticed. They both stared at each other in silence for a moment too long. Harry bit his lip, unsure of what to think or say.
“Yeah, but it’s not a big deal.” Harry reassured, sensing the tone in Draco’s voice. He walked out of the bathroom and chuckled. “I mean, I lived in a cupboard under the stairs until I was eleven, you really expect them to buy me-”
“Now what?” Draco asked in a whisper. A startled Harry looked up from the direction of the noise but went back to taking off his hoodie. He lied down on the bed, staring up at the ceiling.
“Vividly.”
Harry seemed surprised. He opened his mouth, but nothing came out.
Harry put a hand to his hair. “Where?”
“Oh, yes, I love the pep talk, babe, it’s helping a lot.”
“Did you…” Harry put a hand to the streak in his hair uncomfortably. “Did you know?”
“Barely a day and a half, actually,” Harry corrected, “and that’s not nearly enough out of seven days a week. Not when Friday evenings are spent
“That’s what we called Sirius when we were in public - didn’t want to attract attention by saying the name of a “criminal”. Which he wasn’t.”
it might take a while to come out because I want it to be perfect.
“What?” Harry asked, confused.
“Merlin, you need to read this book. Well, it’s not really your type, but it’s so good. I’m on the fifth chapter, and it’s awesome already.” Harry ranted as he finished the chapter. “Draco, you have got to read this-”
“Assume
“Oh, for fuck’s sake, we’re wasting time! Fine, I’ll do it! Fucking pain in the ass!” Draco muttered, pulling the Invisibility Cloak over him.
“Just stop, Hermione, please!” Harry shouted, stepping forwards, pointing his wand right at her, the wand only centimeters away from her chin.
“I knew I should have come,” Harry said, clenching his fists.
Draco and Harry exchanged glances, before smiling at each other.
He scanned through the most recent poem in his journal, one he was supposed to send to Harry, finding himself smiling bitterly. It was stupid; letting himself fall. No, it wasn’t that he let himself fall. It was that he didn’t think of what would happen once he hit the ground - once reality hit both of them. It was something looming the past two months, yet easily ignorable, if they tried hard enough.
It had been a month since Dumbledore’s death. The days had been bleak. Luckily for Draco, his father was usually out with Death Eater work, and he’d be left at home. The only dreadful time was the Death Eater meetings that occurred every week or so.
Harry coughed uncomfortably, putting a hand to his hair.
“You,” he said hoarsely. “Nothing else mattered to me.”
Harry sat down on the floor, too worried his knees would give away. “War… war-” he gulped, trying to blink away tears. He knew this already. Why did it hurt so much to hear from Draco? “But…"
Draco took a step closer to Harry. “When are you going to understand that we could be happy together? I’m sorry for the last two years, I really am. And I’ll… I’ll spend the rest of my life making up for the way I’ve mistreated our relationship. I just don’t want to lose you completely.”
, Harry. It hurts.
He was walking down the hallway with Hermione, on his way to his first class of the day.
“Do you wanna go upstairs to relax for a bit?” Luna asked sympathetically, taking the glass from his hands. He nodded, barely able to see the room. His head was spinning and his ears felt like they were underwater.
“Draco.” His voice was strange. Almost as if he felt guilty.
“I know you don’t,” Harry said calmly, frowning. “Still… let me be there. For me.”
“Oh, so you’re rhyming in real life too now?” Harry rolled his eyes. “That’s going to get old.”
“You guys are adults,” Ron chimed in, pulling Draco in for a hug as well. The two wondered when they had become this comfortable with each other. “I’d hope you two could handle one night for us?”
Harry looked over to Hermione, too surprised to continue listening to their conversation. “I’m sorry, what?” he whispered. “Is she saying that as a joke, or?”
It was as if Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy had never met.
“Um… yes, a few months ago,” he nodded. “Why?”
“They won’t hate you! It’s really hard for them to hate people, okay? You’ll be fine. Trust me,” Harry tried to reassure Draco, and frankly, he didn’t know if it was working or not. “Okay, let’s go inside. I’m freezing.”
“Because I knew if I left it up to you, you would never talk to him about it. You would just avoid it and never give him an explanation,” she sighed. “Other than that...I hoped you two would have been able to sort things out.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry, I spent…
“It’s a promise ring,” Draco said, panicked when he noticed Harry’s smile fading. “I… Oh fuck, should I have not gotten you that? I just thought… I can’t propose, but I just thought if I promised-”
“Your solution is to ignore it?”
“Oh, don’t worry about it, sweetie. I’m sure you’re busy with work and things. Just… it was a bit empty this time, you know with Harry being abroad and all.”
Draco was only half-listening, too busy paying attention to Harry’s hands as they stroked the page, gulping. This was weird. A bit too weird. It was mostly the weird feeling in his chest that was putting him off.
“Actually, that’s what I wanted to talk to you about,” Pansy started to say.
“Um… your hair,” she gulped, too surprised to respond to his horrible joke. “It’s… um, where’s the brown streak?”
“Yeah, sure. I can join this evening, I think.” Harry told Ron.
There was a stunned silence, and Harry felt his throat closing up, unable to look Draco in the eyes. Letting out a bitter laugh, the blond shrugged. Words couldn’t describe the humiliation - or perhaps the hurt - he was feeling.
“Don’t quote me.”
“Are you okay?” Hermione asked, now frowning too. “You seem upset. Is it because of Draco? You can go to him, you know. He’s probably sitting where Pansy was. Pansy, which compartment are you sitting in?”
On the sixth day, Harry came storming down the hallway, banging on the door, kicking and trying to open it by twisting and turning the knob.
He gazed out the window, looking up at the full moon. He hoped going back wouldn’t bring back everything he had been trying to forget.
“I’d hope not,” he replied. “That’d be quite depressing.”
Also this fanfic just reached 90k words!!! I'm so happy to still have people reading!! Thank you so so much for reading, leaving kudos, and commenting!! It just makes me so happy :))
What’s worse was that today was Luna’s birthday, and she’d invited Draco to her party, as well as Astoria.
“Ow,” she blurted, outraged.
“You and me both,” Draco muttered, “I hate you, Pansy.”
Harry sleepily sat up, rubbing his eyes as he felt around the large bed for his glasses. “Morning,” He muttered. “Where the fuck are my glasses? I can’t even see my own hands without them-”
“Stupid? Ridiculous? Absurd?”
“I’m sorry you’re going through this, Harry.”
The next week was chaotic. They had finally left Grimmauld Place behind after breaking into the Ministry, and Harry was, somehow, starting to feel more settled into his life as someone on the run. It felt a little fake, however, due to the fact that he was still meeting with Draco on Fridays in the comfort of Pansy's house.
This time, Draco knew how heavy Harry was, and held him, until his knees gave away and he sank to the floor, sobbing, his arms tight around Harry.
“Just butterbeer, thanks,” he signed back, looking back at Draco, who had now turned back to his friends. They sat down a few booths down from the three Slytherins. Harry sat down, then looked up, noticing that he and Draco could see each other perfectly. They made eye contact again, both awkwardly raising their eyebrows, as if they were unsure of what to say.
?” Harry repeated as if what Draco had said was so crazy; a bitter laugh escaping his lips. Harry looked up at Draco, pressing his lips. “Well, there you fucking go.”
“I promise, too.”
, he thought to himself. She folded her arms, and Harry correlated her expression to one of an angry mother. “I was worried.”
“He asked me to stay and I left him. Because he’ll be safer if I leave,” he wiped his face. “Tell me I did the right thing.”
He quickly attached it to a school owl (which offended Hedwig deeply) and it speedily went to the Hall. Not even five minutes later, the owl came back with a quick response:
“Uh… Harry? You haven’t said anything for the past three minutes.” Draco told him awkwardly.
“I’m not trying to fool anyone, Hermione,” Harry sighed.
“No, of course not!” Draco answered, and Harry let out a sigh of relief. Harry crawled over to Draco and wrapped his arms around his neck.
Of course it was. Draco recognized him from the minute he had entered the room. Of course he did.
“Harry?” Ron said in an attempt to get his attention.
“We did,” he said. “I told him I didn’t want to risk anything. He gave me this and left.”
Draco and Harry had just Apparated right outside The Burrow, and Draco was tightly clutching Harry’s hand, frowning deeply. Much to no one’s surprise, Draco decided to leave the iPhone back at Grimmauld Place until, as he quote on quote said, ‘decided it was worthy of his trust’. Harry thought it was cute how he was scared of such a little device like that, but he was probably the only one on Earth who could find Draco’s constant shrieking as soon as something on the phone happened cute.
He weighed his options. Realistically, it’d be better. He’d be away from Death Eater meetings, so he wouldn’t need to feel guilty about knowing the plans and not being able to tell Harry. That was good. But Draco also couldn’t imagine Hogwarts without Harry - as his enemy or anything else.
“Right back at you, love,” Draco whispered back, before turning to leave.
“Just wait,” Blaise replied, folding his arms.  “I saw him coming. He looked mad.”
“Well, S-sir, I intend to spend the rest of my life with him,” Draco said, his chest tightening as he chewed on his lip. Harry put his left hand under the table (Draco was to his left) and got a hold of it, squeezing it gently.
“Oh no,” Harry said under his breath, slowly picking up his stuff and going to sit beside Draco. He didn’t dare look at Draco, what if he was mad at him? He didn’t want to see Draco glaring at him.
The two resisted the urge to smile.
Harry constantly looked over to Draco. He knew it was stupid to approach him. They’d probably just end up arguing again. And Harry hated that. One thing he couldn’t stand more than arguing with Draco was when he could feel Draco’s pain as they argued. Which was exactly how Harry felt. Harry felt like he was being overdramatic, or just imagining it - but it had been true. It was almost as if Harry could feel his pain.
“I told myself I’d do it later but I procrastinated so much I forgot about it completely.”
Just then, Astoria stopped kissing Draco. Pansy came out from under the Invisibility Cloak.
“I love your eyes.” An unfamiliar voice was telling Draco. “They’re just so handsome. And your hair, oh, your hair…”
“What is all this about?” Draco said as he entered Malfoy Manor in a hurry, frowning when he noticed his father standing in the living room, facing the fireplace. “You said it was an emergency, but everything’s fine? I had to Apparate from Hogwarts-”
*********
He sent two taps back. ‘I miss you’.
“I… don’t really know, actually. Can you explain what happened when I passed out?” Harry asked curiously.
kills him?” Draco asked in a broken voice. “I’ve been to the meetings. He’s so powerful. He’s… he’s made all these plans, Pansy, am I just getting into the wrong thing here? What if he dies? I’ll be all alone-”
“Sleep,” Draco finally said, gently pushing Harry’s head to his shoulder, starting to stroke his hair again, using his other arm to hold him.
Harry nodded and quickly turned. It was time to come up with a plan.
“It’s Harry Potter! The Boy Who Lived!” Harry heard someone shout. If everyone wasn’t staring at Harry before, now they surely were. Everything and everyone was silent for a few seconds. Though it was only a few seconds, it certainly didn’t feel like it for Harry.
“Now, we won’t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy?” said Greyback.
“Sorry,” Draco signed, shaking his head. “I can’t…”
. You’ve got bad security in this place.”
“Were they ever gone, to begin with?”
“I missed you,” Draco mumbled to Harry. He had now stopped kissing Harry’s neck and simply was laying his head on his shoulder. Their hands were intertwined.
“Why didn’t you throw away the bracelet?” he asked. Harry felt Draco’s hand against his head slow down.
“Harry!” Hermione called from the living room, grinning. She walked up to Harry and hugged him tightly, grinning at him, before slowly turning to Draco. The two stared at each other awkwardly. Hermione finally pulled him into an awkward, quick hug, before quickly pulling away as soon as possible.
“You’re gay,” he replied.
though?” he groaned. “None of these would be good for him!” He looked around the store, gasping when something caught his eye. Pansy followed him, raising an eyebrow at the necklace he had picked up. “I know it’s simple, but… it’d symbolize something we talked about.”
Draco tilted his head forward, frowning, silently urging for him to continue.
“Me asking you to be with me is a sign.”
“I didn’t think so either,” Draco spoke, and this time, he signed while speaking. “I didn’t want to see you.”
A longer chapter will be out next.
“Draco,” Snape called out to him as he walked down the hallways. Draco turned and looked at Snape.
“No, Harry, you can’t see Draco because he isn’t-” Pansy paused when she realized what Harry had said. “I didn’t see you looking around the train. How’d you know?” Pansy and Hermione quickly looked over at each other, exchanging glances.
“Yeah, they measured my perfect size and made it accordingly,” Draco said a little ashamedly. “But other than that, it’s soft and beautiful, right?” Draco made sure.
“Really, Potter? Here again?” Draco asked as they made their way by the lake and sat down under the tree. “It’s freezing.”
Of course, he didn’t say that out loud. He could just imagine the shock on her face and the judgment coming from both her and Ron.
Harry was right on top of Draco. He quickly sat up. Both Draco and Harry’s eyes went down to Draco’s left arm. The sleeves were rolled up, so his Dark Mark was visible. Harry moved and sat right in front of his arm so nobody would see it, especially Ron and Hermione.
When Harry didn’t respond, he took in a sharp breath, keeping his eyes fixated on him. “Something happened to you. Something bad. You should talk about it. Sort your feelings through, not shut it out and hope it goes away.”
Draco bit his lip. “My father didn’t think it was the best idea for me to go to come back to Hogwarts, so before I could leave, he locked me in my room with no way to leave.” Draco said after a few moments of silence.
Before he knew it, Lucius had his wand out. “What do you know? You’re a lowlife. You’re probably only with my son to get his money.”
They were seated in the Room of Requirement once again. Harry missed the smell of light dust and Draco’s faint cologne in the air. He studied Draco, who was sitting beside him. He was still in his school uniform, but his tie was loose and the collar button of his shirt was undone.
“Ginny’s really hurt right now.”
“Really now?” Draco asked with a slight smirk, not looking up from his food.
Harry watched him walk towards the exit, then finally spoke. “One month,” he blurted loudly. Draco stopped, turning to look at him, eyebrows knitted.
Draco laughed softly, “yes. Yes, exactly. It felt right. I felt alive again.”
“Harry, how was the detention? What did Snape make you do?” Hermione asked as Ginny quickly took a step back from Harry.
“But after dinner, I’ll be going to bed anyways-”
“I’m sorry, but it looks really bad! I like your hair like this,” Harry reached forward and ran his fingers through Draco’s hair, who glared at him, but didn’t push him away, trying not to smile.
He moved and sat down opposite his mother, worry growing in his chest. “Is something wrong? Do you feel sick again?”
“I know, don’t worry,” he squeezed the other’s hand gently. “I remember our deal. And our rules. I trust you. But I see… you quite disrespectfully forgot rule six.”
“Malfoy, you didn’t have to,” he said, staring down at the hearing aids. He carefully put them on, adjusting it, staying still for a moment. He shook his head in disappointment. “I expected it not to work. Whatever happened to me was some sort of dark magic. It was a longshot anyway.”
“Are you kidding? I was talking about that twink over there! Draco is mine!” Draco hid his face in hands even more and groaned again.
He felt defeated that he’d given in to such an easy task, and his knowledge of everyone else watching him crept back in.
"A very determined bowl-cut."
“No no no Potter, I need to know so. I need to know that you and my brother are chums or whatever.” She stared him down.
“Like you’ve been shagged.” Theo popped in. Draco refused to look him in the eye and flushed a deep red.
The entire area was covered in fake spiderwebs and blood, giving the dungeon the appearance of being abandoned and...used as a average castle would have intended. There were a couple of plastic spiders stuck to the walls that Draco stayed wary of, and some plastic bats. One of which was labelled ‘SNAPE’ and had a goofy expression. Greg had a giggle over that.
Draco looked to both of them and realised he was still in the middle of the barrier.
"How the fuck do I have to earn it?"
“Will you race me or not? Isn’t it crucial that you give me a favour on your ‘Slytherin honour’ or whatever?” Draco looked down and huffed. “Just one little race?” Draco gave the other boy an exasperated sigh.
"Lucius! You brought the peacocks with us?! Why would you do that, it's completely insane! And you go on about not wanting to look like a circus act, well hello there I didn't know I was married to mr hypocrite-" Narcissa began to rant to her husband as he rubbed at the back of his head in pain. The house elves got right to work.
Vince snickers as well. “Crabbe and Goyle,
He took a short breath in when the epiphany hit him but he kept his squealing internal. He turned to the downtrodden boy and put two hands on either shoulder.
"See you later then Draco," Seamus waved us away before dragging Dean down the stairs and into the empty common room and kitchen.
Both Octavia and Draco had had a great love for chocolate since they were younger.
"That does not mean we take them everywhere we go! Especially camping of all things!"
'But I do belong in Slytherin!' Draco thought louder. 'I should be in Slytherin!'
“Good?” Blaise asked.
“Hey Drake the Dragon.” Octavia greeted casually, breaking Draco from his walk. He raised his eyebrows.
“I guess I am.” He said begrudgingly. He then pointed at Potter. “But later you and me are going to have a duet up at the karaoke machine. How do you feel about the Backstreet Boys?” Potter blinked.
If he went to one of Slytherin’s secret nook or crannies, he was eventually found by either a couple trying to shack up or a determined first year trying to map out of every square inch of the dungeons, (
"As if. They're stupid nosy Gryffindors, and they're annoying as shit...take mushrooms. They're annoying as shittake mushrooms." Octavia snickered.
"No, we're far subtler with our colour scheme. More silver." He looked round properly. "If it looked anything like this I'm afraid I'd have to burn the place."
“Ugh, fine Blaise! Whatever! I’ll ‘get to know them’. Don’t put your hand on my mouth ever again, I don’t know where it’s been.” Draco gagged. Blaise bounced his brows and lowered his eyebrows.
And I can cap them all.
I heard him changing into pajamas and the soft "Nox" that followed. I flipped over to lie on my back and looked up at the ceiling. The stars glowed a soft blue, filling the room with a light less harsher.
She went up and sat down on the stool primly. Professor McGonagall rested the hat on her head. Everyone in the hall seemed to be holding their breath for her, causing a slight unease in her stomach.
“A Veela cheerleader for the national Bulgarian quidditch team.” He gritted out.
“-Only one known person has ever survived it, and he’s sitting right in front of me.” Moody broke him out of his inner ramblings. He glanced over to where Moody was standing. Right in front of Potter.
Draco and Harry go shopping in Gladrags Wizardwear.
“Thank you, you are very kind. But, Drako, why are there the paper bats on the ceiling?” Viktor gestured upwards. Draco looked up and saw the theme that was splattered across the great hall.
“Did he manage to curse you, laddie?”
“Finally! It all would have been worth it.” She clutched her hands. “The past eighteen years would have been worth it.” She leaned down to Draco and smiled. “I will see you in a couple of days. Stay safe,” she tugged on his ear roughly, “and don’t do anything stupid.”
"I hate it when Father has to be such an arse-kisser," Octavia whispered in Draco ear, and Draco had to clap a hand over his mouth to stop himself from laughing.
“Please get the alcohol?” Blaise pulled out the sad puppy dog eyes. Draco tried to harshen his look. Blaise’s eyes were positively sparkling.
“I was joking Potter. Besides, its not your fault I’m not very popular with Aurors. It’s fine.” He looked away from the stupid raven haired boy and up at Blaise, who was smirking at him.  “What are you looking at?”
“Why do you want to help, Malfoy?” She asked him. He shrugged, feeling awkward.
“Pity.” She nodded. “Because you are such a little daddy’s boy that you went along with whatever he taught you and its turned you into a right arsehole.” Potter gasped. Draco raised an eyebrow. That must have been the first time he heard Granger swear. “You don’t really think muggleborns are lesser, do you?” She asked him.
He somehow knew exactly how to get under his skin, to get Draco to show the very worst of himself. He was no longer composed. He could become embarrassed, openly angry, pompous, incredibly boastful, and unfortunately passionate in his insults.
==============
"Goodnight ladies!" Michael called out jokingly as he turned off the light. Draco wondered idly what was funny about calling them 'ladies'.
His shoulders hunched. His immediate internal response was
"Oh not you too Draco!" She said. Harry chuckled.
“You said it, not me.”
“-you’re the partner stealer Blaise! You’re the one who’s a slag!”
This chapter focused on Lucius being shitty and why Narcissa is the way she is.
"Oh I'll show you what my thing is! Wingardium Leviosa!" She sent a hardback flying into Anthony's chest. He landed on his back with an audible 'oof'.
He’s gonna need a refill.
“Grand!” Martha pulled out a pink hairbrush and immediately set to work getting to knots out of Octavia’s long blonde hair. “Your hair reminds me of this girl I knew in primary school. A muggle one. My parents are both Muggle-Born so they wanted me and my brother to experience a normal childhood. Well, not ‘normal’, that’s a bit general, but an average muggle childhood. So anyway, this girl was called Jessie and she had the longest, blondest-“ she continued to yammer on. Octavia listened happily, grateful for the distraction.
He enjoed Ravenclaw. He truly did. But he was in too deep for his father not to react. Especially since his only other friends outside of Ravenclaw were Gryffindors. He like his house, but his father would not. He heard the whispers that followed him around the hall. He needed to be resorted.
“Blaise if you even consider flirting with my sister then with my own bare hands I will rip out small intestine and then proceed to strangle you to death with it.” Draco glared at Blaise with such intensity that even his flirty personality quelled down.
“I hate you.” He tells Blaise.
"Night Malfoy."
"Blind stalker."
Hope you enjoyed that you wonderful people have a good day and a happy good day 😙😙😙😙 kith kith kith
She cleared her throat and began. "My dear Hogwarts Students coming back for an Eighth year, I welcome you all again after a stressful yet productive summer. I have managed to repair all of the classrooms so everything shall go on as usual, although the staircases may be a tad bit...sensitive to many people at once so just be careful and alert. The uniforms will not apply to you as you can all make your own clothing decisions, and it seems a bit foolish to force you back into your school robes when so many of you are adults by now. As many of you might of heard I will be the new Headmistress, but a new teacher will take my place as Head Of Gryffindor house, and will work as a temporary Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher, who you will call Miss Lou Freebush. Although that shouldn't concern many Gryffindors with the change of your head of house, as you will all be one large unit in the Eighth Year dormitories. If you have any problems feel free to speak to me about anything, as I will be recommending therapy and counselling to anyone who feels the need to ask as well. After the feast ends, you will all come to me so that I may lead you to your new quarters." And with that she opened up the doors and led us all into the Great Hall.
“You’re the owner of those books!” Draco blurted, before realising that was a silly thing to say.
“They’re too old anyway...”
“Of course I’ll be.” He reassured her. “Thanks Madame Pomfrey. Come on guys, let’s get to dinner before the food runs out.” The nurse looked shocked, before smiling.
"It beats killing a teacher."
“Don’t pretend you haven’t heard what happened already.” Draco told her, his voice muffled from where he hid.
“Don’t you dare spread such ridiculous rumours again,
"Oh no way is Gryffindor the best! Don't you know that Merlin was a Slytherin! And Newt Scamander was a Hufflepuff! Recklessness usually gets both people hurt, it doesn't save one person, and why self sacrifice when there's probably another..." They continued to question and bicker for the rest of train ride. Neville tried acting as the mediator every time things got heated, but eventually gave up.
“Get my wand from the bad man.” He whispered to the cat, feeling a bit foolish to think they’d listen. Cushion blinked up at him slowly and jumped back off his lap and lazily padded their way over to Sirius. They sat down next to Sirius’ pocket and meowed at the wand. Draco nodded rapidly and they picked it up with their teeth, neatly taking it out of Sirius’ pocket. Draco grinned. What a clever cat!
Professor Dumbledore revealed her to be the headmistress of Beauxbatons, Madame Maxime, as the two exchanged pleasantries. It was then that she summoned her students out of the carriage. About a dozen boys and girls, all late teenagers, emerged from the carriage in a cold and shivery group, all looking at Hogwarts in apprehension. They were led by Madame Maxime into the school as the Hogwarts students were back to waiting, this time for Durmstrang.
“AND I NEED YOU MORE THAN EVER!”
"We were just doing a spell to get back Neville's pet toad." Draco explained. He then turned to Neville. "Can I move into your carriage? Some people in mine are rather...rather rude." Neville's face lit up.
"Yeah, I'm a pretty big disappointment to the family." Draco accepted it.
Though he kind of wished it did...
Draco sighed and ignored the supposed Casanova on his shoulder. “Ask away.”
"Via!" Pansy's attention turned to her. "It's been far too long since I last saw you! I can't believe you're joining Hogwarts this year, we're going to have so much fun!" Pansy turned her constrictive hug onto Octavia. Draco knew that Pansy was a bit like an older sister to Octavia, spending a lot of time at the manor and being one of the only girls she'd interacted with. It really spoke about how much Octavia cared for Pansy that she smiled after nearly being strangled. Then Pansy turned back to Draco.
Greg and Vince chuckled and Draco’s lip twitched up in a smile. He could always count on his entourage.
She felt a faraway pain that even though Hogwarts miraculously had two champions, neither one came from Slytherin. It seemed perpetually unfair. Slytherin had incredible candidates. Many who she guessed were monumentally better than Diggory.
What in Merlin’s beard...
Draco raised an eyebrow.
“I REALLY NEED YOU NOW TONIGHT!”
“I need a drink.” Draco said groggily.
“I wanted to attempt to transfigure a cushion into a...cat of some sort. To keep me company.” She still wasn’t talking so Draco kept going. “A pet would definitely help my restlessness, and if I were to solely provide for one it would teach me about responsibility, and I wouldn’t bother you as much -I know how much you hate it when I talk too much- and it would really be a challenge for my transfiguration skills.” He rambled.
He checked himself over in the mirror once again and nodded in satisfaction. That would do.
“Yes please.” She agreed, and let him talk her through some stuff. She was only going to make some notes on it at first, but as Greg explained everything she continued to write and write until eventually she practically had her full essay done.
“Oh, hi Blaise!” She greets with a wave that feels a little overdone. Blaise waves back weakly.
“I take it he talks about me a lot?” He asked.
Love you all, leave a comment and a kudo my angel cakes, and be sure to wear a mask and stay safe out there! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Can I have a go my duckling?" She asked, referring to the mixing. He handed her the spoon and she took to it with gusto. While she was busy, he readied the baking tray and cupcake wrappers, this time choosing the light blue ones. He rather liked blue. It was a friendly colour.
There was a pitter pattering of feet and the sound of a door opening and closing. Draco kept his face in his knees, his hands outstretched before him.
He sighed a long suffering sigh, before digging into his satchel for a pouch. He began pouring some Galleons into his palm.
“No I am handling this so well, you don’t get it, this is fucking amazing wow!” Octavia bit her tongue from telling Danny off for language.
"Can you quit it, I feel like the bed's about to come down on top of me!"  Michael's voice broke through the newfound enjoyment. Before Draco could apologise, Anthony interrupted.
"We first met at the Manor" He said, his face careful and closed off, though I could sense a slight defensive tremor in his voice.
The days at Hogwarts had continued well, and Octavia had soon cemented herself as the best in the class at nearly every subject, the only downfall being constantly compared to her genius brother. But she had kind of terrible since her midday outburst at Draco, and her ignoring of him at dinner. She had her reasons, and she stood by them, but she was getting concerned. It was getting pretty late and no one knew where he was.
“Well why not?” Her face scrunched up. “I’ve done my waiting! Four years of it! All for you!” She cried.
Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry. “Hello,” He finally replied, slowly looking away. It hadn’t occurred to him that Harry was drunk - sure, he registered the strange behavior but didn’t think too much of it.
, and there’s no problem with that because we’re definitely not even together anymore but Astoria Greengrass? He deserves much,
Draco gulped. He knew he had taken it too far. The fleeting satisfaction had left and the regret was starting to settle. He shook his head. “I didn’t mean-”
“...Alright, good,” Lucius nodded. He stood up. “I will leave you to it, then. Come down early for your Christmas presents tomorrow.”
“Prat,” Draco said with an eye roll. “Hey, it’s getting late and everyone’s heading to their dorms, and the Dementors and Filch will probably see us. Want to just sneak out and go for a walk on Saturday? It’ll be our first date, and I’ll bring some snacks..." Draco paused before getting embarrassed. "Unless you don’t want-”
“Draco, I have to. Here, hold on to my Cloak to dig your fingers into for the pain.” Harry handed him his cloak and took off, sneaking into the Hospital Wing.
, they decided to settle on small gifts.
********
“Then that’s all that matters to me. How could you possibly stop all of them? You can’t blame yourself. This was my fate, you can’t beat yourself up over something you can’t control. Whatever you have to do… do it.”
Draco took a sip of the lemonade, his eyes widening at how good it tasted. He looked up at her after a moment, trying to process what she said. “Uh… what are you trying to tell me? That I should live with you?”
Ron shook his head. “Harry, you better be right about him.”
He got two taps back. ‘I miss you too’.
“I was reading the instructions and we can make meanings with each tap. See, one tap can mean hey, and two taps can mean ‘I miss you’. I know it’s a bit ridiculous, but… given that we can’t spend a lot of time together… I thought it would be good for us.”
“Then leave,” he said, taking a step forward. He set his bag down to the floor, not taking his eyes off of him. “I’m not going to force you to be here.”
Harry looked at him, groaning. “I know,” he admitted. “I don’t suppose you did it as soon as it was set?”
“You’re signing,” he smiled. “Lousily, but it’s good. You should do it more often when you speak to me. Helps me understand you a bit better.”
Lie. In fifth year, the night after he kissed Cho, he had dreamed that it was Draco who he was kissing. He played it off as a nightmare rather than a dream, and never told anyone about it, and pushed it to the back of his brain.
Every morning, without fail, there would be Draco’s owl at the window with a new poem. Harry found himself writing back, either related to the poem or just something completely different, just to get his mind off of the things that had been eating at him. Those ten minutes every morning were the only eventful and positive thing about his days.
“They’re PureBloods too,” Draco pointed out, but this only frustrated Astoria more. Standing up from his lap, she left their room to find Narcissa. They were going to go Christmas shopping.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Merlin, what?” Harry asked, almost dropping one of the plates on the floor. “No! No, Draco and I are dating. We’re not… we’re not friends with benefits… Merlin, I didn’t even know people in the Wizarding World did that!” Molly smiled sweetly at Harry.
”A decision like this really shouldn’t have a due date,” Harry pointed out. His expression was completely unreadable.
“Anything?” he responded, burying his face in his hands. “It’s stupid.
Hermione was glad to see Harry picking himself up, but she couldn’t help feeling sad that Draco and Harry hadn’t cleared things up between them.
“Er… I’ve been studying,” he said. That wasn’t far from the truth. “By myself.”
“You know,” Harry said, finally putting the pieces together, before turning to Draco. “Thanks for telling me, Draco.” He added with an eye roll, staring at the other who sheepishly smiled and scratched the back of his neck.
Harry could’ve thought of more things to say, but after seeing Draco’s hair, he stood up and left the living room, saying he was going to go see if lunch was ready. The four sat in silence until Ron and Hermione awkwardly shuffled out of the room as well.
“But I’ve apologized,” Blaise folded his arms.
When Draco had finally come up with something, he looked up, opening his mouth to speak, but no words came out, not when he saw the look on Harry’s face when realization hit him.
Till the next chapter! <3
The worst part was Draco was letting her do so.
Harry smiled at Draco sheepishly, shrugging slightly, “Maybe,” He whispered, placing his head on Draco’s shoulder, “It’s only October. We have loads of time until the exams.” He murmured, shutting his eyes.
“Harry, I’ve been meaning to talk to you.”
hii i'm back!! sorry for the short chapter but i just wanted one out there asap. hope you enjoyed xx
Draco had to tell him. So he could stay away. So he wouldn’t get too close. So that he wouldn’t be hurt. Draco hated how selfish he was being; unable to tell Harry the simple sentence.
“That’s sad,” Harry said absentmindedly.
Draco let out a snort, and Hermione and Ron behind Harry stared at him, eyebrows raised. He cleared his throat. “I mean, is that really the best you can do?”
“And why on earth should I listen to you?” Draco demanded right back.
Draco tried to keep his laughter in. “I have no idea what you’re talking-- oof!” he balanced himself as Harry pushed him backwards. The white-haired teenager felt somewhat satisfied. He had hit a nerve - good. He went near the edge of the water, holding the hearing aids out. “Alright, that’s it. I don’t know what this stupid thing is, but I might as-”
And it came.
“I don’t know,” Harry answered in a shaky voice. “It’s not like you’re any better.”
It was just what Draco needed.
“That wasn’t us.”
no me and Harry anymore! Why can’t you understand that?” he practically shouted. “I’m married, Pansy! This isn’t a joke! I gave him his chance and he didn’t take it. Why can’t you just accept his decision?”
“Trying to pretend to be enemies isn’t going to work if you keep looking at each other like that,” she whispered in his ear, but Harry shrugged. He was too good in a mood to care, and the dark atmosphere that had bestowed upon Hogwarts had almost slipped past him. Almost.
“Trust me, you wouldn’t be the first person to get lost in Malfoy Manor,” Draco said with an eye roll as Harry left to the kitchen.
“I try to dye it back, but it doesn’t work. I think I just have a patch there or something. Hey, it could be part of the curse your father put on us. You have a brown streak, see?”
“Yeah, yeah, I won’t,” he replied.
He shouldn’t have let it come to this. What was he thinking?
“It was cute. Have you ever considered becoming a poet?”
“But why tomorrow?” Harry asked pleadingly. Draco gave him a look that said ‘don’t make me feel bad about this’, and Harry immediately stopped whining. He turned over and leaned forwards, kissing Draco on the lips gently. Then Harry slowly moved his lips, starting to kiss Draco’s cheek, then his jawline, then his neck, nipping at it, leaving a huge love bite on his neck, before kissing where he had just bit, gently. Draco shuddered, a chill running down his spine.
There was no way he wanted to be soulmates with Harry! Harry couldn’t even trust Draco, and now they were supposed to be soulmates? Draco scoffed. He hated Harry, he didn’t even want to look at him. He hated…
“I love you.”
Harry smiled at Draco. “So we’re on the same side, then?” asked Harry, his green eyes sparkling as he looked into Draco’s eyes, slowly putting the wand away and taking Draco’s hands, holding onto them tightly.
Pansy stood up and shut the blinds so that anyone passing by wouldn’t be able to look inside. She sat back down beside him. “I’m sorry,” she spoke finally, running her hand up and down his arm. “But I’m sure Harry would understand this, right?”
“You came,” Harry said.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“I don’t love you despite your imperfection, Draco, I love you because of it,” Harry answered softly. “Anyone who sees it as something that should be held against you is wrong. I’m not perfect either. Far from it.”
“Do I get a gift too?” he asked.
Harry opened his and smiled when he saw it was a sweater with the letter ‘H’ on it. “Thank you!” He said, quickly pulling it on and giving Molly a hug, before turning to Draco. “Hey Draco, we should- Draco?”
“Yeah, he kept talking about you the first few days. Don’t even get me started on the stupid rumors floating around because of him.”
bond with Potter. I cannot have that happening. Soulmates are disgusting, as well as painful and unnecessary. Especially if your soulmate is Harry Potter. Honestly Draco, I really didn’t want it to come to this; but it seemed that there was no other way to convince you.”
An hour passed and though he was trying to get on with his work, all he felt was humiliation. They had barely been friends for two weeks and it was already messed up. Was it impossible for the two of them to have a normal relationship- friendship? Sighing, Harry stood up, shutting his books and dumping them into his bag. This was too depressing. Perhaps he had misread the proximity of their friendship.
“And there’s no need to regret that-”
*******
“Well… I was just watching how Draco was trying not to cry, and how he was shaking as he pointed his wand at Dumbledore…”
“I don’t need you to be worried!”
Harry turned to Draco, nodding slightly. Lucky for the two, Hermione and Pansy started a conversation about Astoria and Draco’s wedding, which kept the group in a less awkward position.
“Pansy, I’ve never done anything for him to question my intentions.”
“America? Really?” Draco gulped.
Harry sat down on the bed again, glad to have calmed him down. He took a mental note to talk to Hermione about it as well, but the exhaustion was starting to kick in, and he still had a full day of celebration yet to go. Everyone had been hyping up Harry’s birthday, especially because they knew he had been down because of Sirius.
“I didn’t say that. I can’t be with him right now. I mean… of course, he’s still my boyfriend. It’s just that we can’t see each other. It’s too dangerous.”
Harry finished the last of his hot chocolate, biting his lip.
Hermione repeated her explanation of what the assignment was, and Harry got to work.
“...Do you think it’s the curse?”
“I got you something,” Draco said. “Well, I got both of us something.”
“He wanted this to happen?” Harry finished for him. “Yeah, me too. And I’m so confused as to why.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The brunet hesitantly reached forward and took his hand. His heart was racing and his cheeks were flushed. He was being bold for someone who had just been rejected. “Then we go back to being Malfoy and Potter.”
this, a husband that was fucked in the head.
Draco took a step forward. They were so close, now. Draco wanted to savor this moment forever, because he didn't know how long this would last. Harry stared, the same longing still linger in his eyes.
Draco had stopped reading the news, of course. He had isolated himself, being too afraid of the headlines. He had imagined how they would go, though. The Savior Finally Break Free from A Love Potion Disaster. Harry Potter and His Happy, Single Life. Harry Potter and Merlin Knows Who Going on a Date.
“Merlin, I hope not,” Harry admitted. He laughed, nervously. “I did plan on proposing, though, before you left. Should’ve done it sooner, I think.”
"I was afraid. I mean. You were being so good to me, Harry," Draco said, quiet. He stopped for a while and when Harry didn't reply, he continued, "I didn't know how long it would last and for all I know, nothing lasted long for me. And. And when it was almost a year, I thought things were getting too real. And then I dreamed about you leaving me for someone better-"
“I saw you wore mine once.”
to have such a stubborn owner. He never opened the letters, though. And next howlers were coming. Draco burned all of them because he couldn't bear having any piece of Harry in his room. The letters kept coming and Draco kept lighting fire.
"Draco, I won't."
Some time later after the incident, Harry asked him again,
Harry's eyes widen. "What?"
Harry sighed in relief, as if he was expecting for a death sentence. He hugged Draco and his embrace felt so safe. Draco hadn't felt safe for months.
"Yeah, of course."
"He's in St. Mungo right now," Granger said. She was already walking away and Draco had questions. "Do what you will with that information. I don't care, I swear."
Draco didn’t know what to say. Didn’t know how to respond to a proposal from a man that he had left for months. Draco didn’t know if he deserved this, didn’t know if Harry
"Merlin, stop cutting me!"
Granger looked amused and disappointed. "God, Harry was right."
"What could I do so you would trust me?"
"What the
Harry hummed. His hand found his way around Draco's waist. Always the small spoon, Draco thought fondly. They stayed silent for a long time.
When Harry was the first person he saw in his bed in St. Mungo, Draco had so many questions- because why would the man stay and wait for Draco? He had gone into a coma after a mission went reckless for a week, if Draco wasn’t mistaken- and the first thing he saw was Harry sodding Potter and the first thing the savior did was to hug him. Despite his mind running wild, Draco stayed still for a full minute. Stiff. Until Harry sobbed. Until his body trembled and he whispered sweet nothings like, "Please don't do that again." Draco was taken aback for what seemed to be a long time, because surely Harry didn't mean it, right? Because Draco had been a burden for everyone he knew and Harry couldn't be the first one to admit that he was more than a tool to get rid off later, right?
The question came with worry in the green iris.
"Draco, darling, you owe me nothing."
"Draco," Harry had called. And god, no one had called him so gentle. No one but Harry.
The name felt like a jab in Draco's chest. He didn't know how to respond- didn't know what to respond when Granger was about to cry anytime now.
"Again, I thought it would be better that way."
“And you thought I wouldn’t do the same thing again?”
Of course Draco didn't say any of it, because that was silly and a Malfoy did not do 'silly'. So he went still, quiet.
When Harry asked Draco to move in to Grimmauld Place No. 12, Draco didn't ask anything further. Instead, he went to the Manor and packed a bag. To think about it, now, it wasn't a big job, you know? Draco's clothes and shampoo and potion and basically his everything was everywhere at Harry's place. It was as if Draco was trying to remind Harry of his existence. As if he didn't trust Harry to remember him on his own. Because- because Harry surely would leave this whole thing behind later, right?
When Harry's hand lingered longer on Draco's shoulder as he passed by, Draco didn't think much about it. Or- or he did, but he stayed quiet. Silent. He didn't want to ruin this, right? A friendship that could had started since he was eleven- something that he yearned for so badly. Draco tucked questions under his tongue, kept his jaw in clench when he started to get too eager. Draco breathed, quietly, and he didn’t say anything. Not to Harry, not to anyone.
Granger was gone with a pop. Draco was quiet, again.
Draco went quiet. He couldn't find judgment in Harry's tone. Couldn't find a sense of coldness in his voice. Draco tried to find a reason to go back to where he was- alone in the Manor. Harry didn't give him any.
There was no anger. She wasn't venting. No frustration. Just. Just helplessness and a handful of shameless truth.
Granger seemed desperate with the silence, which was funny, because she seemed so confident at first, with her bold steps and all. "
"What is there to be afraid of?”
"Just. Would you come and visit Harry? At Grimmauld Place?"
Draco spent his days in his room, only went out if necessary. He didn't step out of the Manor, not even to the garden. Mother looked at him with sadness in her eyes but Draco felt like it had always been that way. He shrugged it off, yet he didn't dare to look at her in the eyes after realizing it.
Harry laughed with him. “So what do you think? About us being married?”
"You weren't so smart, then," Harry concluded. He rested his forehead against Draco's. "I was miserable."
Draco was scared. Because it meant it would hurt so much when Harry saw his everything. Thus Draco went quiet. He kissed Harry on his cheek, soft and gentle. And Harry—fuck him for being so good to Draco—closed his eyes and hummed, content with Draco’s presence.
When Draco walked into Grimmauld Place No. 12 on a Sunday morning the day after, Tinky looked at him with relief. The house-elf didn't say anything, though, except exhaling hard and loud. Draco looked at her and Tinky said, "Master Harry is in the bedroom."
The word slipped out and Draco felt like choking. He shouldn't do that. Now his breath went unsteady and he knew how silly he looked like. He knew that his dignity was stripped off now, looking like a lost puppy. He had given it away- all of it.
Granger stormed. She was angry and there was a tear streak on her cheeks. She looked like she hadn't gotten a proper sleep for weeks. Draco wanted to pity her but he wasn't any better, so Draco went quiet. He didn't need to speak, apparently, because next Granger was pointing her wand at him. It looked like the woman would kill him right there if she wasn't The Minister of Magic. Draco licked his chapped lips, waiting for his death sentence, for anything on the table for him.
Draco could feel himself smiling- and then he was laughing, for the first time after months. He pulled Harry closer. “You are a hopeless romantic, do you know that?”
"You never answered my questions."
“Harry,” said Draco, careful with his words, “you are going to regret this.”
“Draco, marry me.”
Draco left a kiss on the top of Harry’s head. Harry left out a giggle and snuggled closer. At that moment Draco couldn’t wait to try again. And again and again and again.
"Draco." He said his name like opening a safe.
"I know!" Draco replied in frustration. "That's why it became a problem. Because I know you won't leave. But- but you deserve better, alright? And no, don't cut me this time. Harry.
"Did I do something wrong?"
Draco breath was steady. His breath was always steady- learnt that from Father who taught him how to lie. ("The breath always give it away. Be quiet. Silent. How many times do I have to tell you?")
Harry rested his hands on Draco’s hips, so careful, like he would break anytime. "Draco. Why?"
"I already ate and showered, Hermione."
Apparently, Granger wasn't expecting answers, too. She spitted questions like she had recited them. "Didn't you think? About Harry? Or about yourself, then, if you were such a selfish prick? Why the fuck did you just- why did you suddenly leave? Your job? Your old life? Harry? For fuck’s sake, Malfoy!"
"I owe you an explanation.”
Draco packed his bag the next day, without telling Harry. He put his resignation letter on Robards’ desk. The Head Auror looked at him with confusion. Draco couldn't say anything, so he shook his head, defeated by himself. Robards picked up something in his eyes, Draco didn’t know what, but the man shoved his questions away and didn’t ask.
When Draco stood beside Harry's bed at St. Mungo, Draco had questions. His mind went berserk. And he stayed quiet again this time, because what would a dying man do? Draco conjured a chair and he wished he had the courage to walk away.
Draco’s eyes snapped open.
"Please," Harry had said again. His eyes were wet now. His lips trembled as he spoke, "Please tell me why you left- were I. Were I not good enough? Or is there anything I did wrong? Just. If you would tell me, I promise I would do anything. Please."
He was a fool, for letting Harry go, of course- but he wasn't selfish, you see. He knew-
The day after, Draco moved back to the Manor. He put up protection everywhere and told Mother and Winky to not let Harry in. The two, god bless them, didn't ask.
Draco noticed that Harry's under eyes were darker now and his eyes looked so tired and swollen, like he hadn't stopped crying for Merlin knows how long. The lines on his forehead were more visible. His lips were chapped and god, his bones were practically poking out of his shirts. Draco had noticed there were new scars just right over his collarbones, and several more on his shoulders.
