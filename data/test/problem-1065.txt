“My predecessor didn’t run a very tight ship, Mr. Malfoy. The clientele in my department have some very complex needs, and I have spent the week organising a list of the most critical. Here, Ms. Moretti has been the
“A night on the settee with you sounds... Well, it’s perfect. I... I don’t know, Draco. I don’t know what I can say to you. I can’t convey my thoughts into words. I... I just love you, Draco, and I think for the immediate future that might have to be enough...”
After showered, clean and dry, he put on some shorts and a tee and sat down on his desk. He was about to grab a piece of parchment and a quill when he remembered the device his boyfriend had given him a few months before. He opened his drawer, grabbing the little muggle machine with the name NOKIA on top, and looked at the bars that said if it had energy or not. It still had two bars, so he guessed he didn't need to ask Harry to charge it just yet.
It didn't stop him from having an over the top libido. Draco constantly felt hot and bothered, and he couldn't help but imagine how would it be with Potter. Holy Fuck, he was needy. He smiled, though, crossing his arms over his chest because he knew his nipples would try to press on his shirt.
"I love this, too... I can't help but think it would be the perfect moment to have your mark..." Draco whispered, putting his hands under his head and closing his eyes. "Harry... If you weren't working at my company... What would you do for a living?"
“Harry... Move... Make me feel good...” Draco asked, putting one of his hands down, touching his cock, that had gotten flaccid, but slowly was getting harder. “Yes... Yes, make me come like this... “
He was so worried that the changes to her body that pregnancy had brought would send her back into the dark place she’d been in before; that she was ashamed of her body and didn’t want to sleep with him as a result.
Harry could feel his body reacting to the kiss, and he knew that it would take only one look from Draco for him to carry him into bed. But he’d never put his beloved into the position of feeling pressured.
He breathed through his mouth, his omega scent all over his bedroom. Unconsciously, he touched his cock, moaning louder and imagining Harry's huge cock hammering inside him, fucking him so good Draco would come for days around his thick girth.
Draco.  You were beautiful... Such a good fuck. And I felt like we really let ourselves go... It’s not been like that for ages... I loved it; I’ve missed it.”
"Potter, report!" He said, loud enough that the other offices could listen, and he banged the door behind him. As soon as the door closed, Draco sighed. "I'm sorry. I'm angry. Just give me the damn report so they know I'm as bad with you as I am with them."
And Draco had to prove himself. Yes, he would rather be married by now, thank you very much, but if he had a job, he'd be the
"I guess you're done, baby girl. Now stay a bit quiet, papa is trying to stand up here," Draco held on the safety bars at the side of the tub that Harry installed on his first pregnancy, and slowly lifted himself. At seven and a half months, he was absolutely
He didn't have eggs. Draco sighed, looking around his fridge, finding a piece of cheese. It also smelled okay, so maybe it could go well with the toast. He grabbed a knife, trying to cut even slices, but not quite managing that. Well, he supposed it would taste good enough.
“I can’t spend my life hurting and waiting. I think, Draco, you have to come to the decision of whether you want me to be a part of it yourself. Let’s have a few days, a week perhaps, alone just to think about what we both want. We’ve rushed into things, and it’s been too much, too heavy and too fast. I want you, but you have to want us too. I think we need to be professional business colleagues for a little while.... You’re very quiet, Draco. What is it that you’re thinking?”
"My parents would take my name away if they've known I've been with you like this. If I ever introduce you as my boyfriend, you'll have to promise them we've just hold hands all this time. This is how prude they are," Draco sat down on the tub, facing Harry, his arousal disappearing completely. His parents could ruin everything even if they weren't near him. "I... I'm falling for you too, Harry. And having this... Having what we have right now is becoming not enough really fast. I crave for your mark every single day. And it hurts me to know I can't have it," Draco sighed, holding Harry's hand.
Harry thanked Merlin that the Aurors were reasonable, and listened to the witnesses who’d seen the whole incident.
“Back to the factory after breakfast, then,” Harry yawned, stretching in his chair. “I wish we didn’t have to, love,” he followed in a quieter voice. “I just want to go on an old fashioned
Right now, all he wanted was to be with Draco. That brief moment in the kitchen had whetted his appetite for every part of his omega, and he felt his blood rush with anticipation. For the whole rest of the day he was useless. He couldn’t settle to any task and nothing could hold his attention. At soon as his watch announced the end of the day he was blinding for the stairs, counting the minutes and seconds until he was back in his right place in the world: next to Draco.
“I’m not going to pressure you, sweetheart. If we shower it’s not because I want it to lead to sex... It’s because I want us to be together with any barrier. If you’re worried about your period, get yourself sorted and I’ll join you in five minutes... but if you’d prefer to go to bed that’s fine too-”
"God... I wish I had more experience so you could shove it down my throat..." Draco said, holding Harry's cock with one hand and putting the head on his mouth, moaning around it. He licked around, letting saliva gather on his tongue before he put almost half of it inside his mouth.
Dressed in the formal robes so carefully chosen by his beloved, Harry knew it was but a few minutes until Draco and he were presented to each other, and their bonding would begin.
“I know, Harry... It's just... I feel ashamed that I even have these type of thoughts. Maybe because I had to contain them while we were courting. Give me time... I'll tell you eventually.”
Harry felt himself start to drift to sleep, enjoying the feel of Draco’s heart beating under his fingertips.
Of course questions of 'how did you guys do it?' popped up, and Draco had to explain to them how they made it without potions or magic. Hermione, being who she was, was the first one to catch up and decided to do the explaining herself, even though she was already big and round, shiny eyes and chubbier cheeks. Draco thought with himself if he would ever get as big as she was now, and probably yes. It wasn't a bad thought, and he felt a little ashamed about it. He was fit and loved his body now, but somehow he wished for the round shape of her belly.
Harry pushed in a forth finger. It felt tight, and scolding hot inside Draco but not impossible. Tensing his hand Harry gave one last push forward, pressing with all his strength till he met resistance. It felt so fantastic, like he was discovered Draco’s most hidden, forbidden place, and he was loose limbed and panting with desire.
Draco moaned loud when Harry touched his nipples, his body arching towards Harry's hand. He was already hard and wet by now, and he tried to open his legs even more so Harry could touch him.
Harry wanted to enjoy this moment, wanted it to be all about Draco, this first lazy morning married and together. Pulling away, he instructed his husband not to move a muscle.
He kissed Harry as hard as he got, holding Harry with all his strength then turning the alpha with his stomach up. Draco took off his silk shirt, and practically broke his bra's clasp with the fury he took it off. He straddled Harry after taking his bottom clothes off. He licked his lips and bit down the side of Harry's neck, pointy teeth drawing blood inside his mouth.
"As you said... You don't want a relationship, and I don't have time to have a relationship, so we're fine this being... Not serious, right?" Draco asked, tying his long, blond hair in a loose knot on the back of his head. "As I said before... I can't lose my... virginity. I mean, my family checks my vaginal channel every month to see if I'm still a virgin, so no cock or fingers can get up there, or else, I'm figuratively fucked. Other than that... I'd like to feel everything. Oral sex, hands... touching me..." Draco got closer to Harry, holding the hem of his tee and taking it off. It made the knot break, and his hair fell around his shoulders. His perk, small and white breasts were sensitive, nipples pink and hard. "I want to feel how is it like to have an alpha sucking on me... on my cunt, on my cock, on my tits... I want you to use me and abuse me as you feel like... Except for those things I said you couldn't do. What do you think? Are you up for it?" Draco asked, and then, he took off his knickers.
Draco decided to come back to Harry's page, looking out for Lyra. He found a good amount of photos of her. She was such an adorable girl, with tanned skin, bright green eyes and brown, curly hair. Draco fell immediately in love with her, and liked all their photos together, even one from many years ago when Lyra was about three.
Draco almost felt his brain melting with that kiss, but it was clear enough so he could close the door with his foot before Harry placing his hand over his crotch. God, it was so big. Draco wanted nothing but to lick all of that and let it choke him until Harry came.
"I don't offer sex to you because I think you want me for it, Harry. I just want to see you come. Let me be a little selfish sometimes," Draco commented on what Harry had said, but didn't try to keep the conversation. He'd hope he could release the sexual tension at night anyways.
"I'll tell him I need to stay the night, that's all." Draco replied, and messaged Harry, because he couldn't wait.
Harry relaxed into the shower, enjoying the hot water rolling over his muscles. He was still a bit sticky from yesterday’s chocolate and he smiled, recollecting Draco’s clever tongue licking him clean. Honestly, that man was endlessly keen. Harry loved his slight, pale little body and wished dearly he could give him his knot.
Of course, it was all nonsense. They were as likely to have that sort of relationship as they were to fly to the moon. Harry had
“I can tell you’re anxious about money, and I do get that. I hope you don’t mind me saying, but when you’ve always had money, it must feel frightening to be without your family wealth.” Harry sighed, leaning back in his chair. “But I want to be your alpha in every way. I want to support you. Tell me your dreams Draco. How do you imagine our wedding to be like?”
He moaned louder when Harry put his mouth on his cunt, holding his husband's hair and wishing for his cock so desperately. He whimpered when Harry left that part of his body, but smiled when Harry got him in his arms.
Draco was a truly beautiful person, inside and out, and Harry thanked Merlin every day that he was lucky enough to share his life with him. This was the life he’d always imagined, complete with beard and dog thrown in for good measure!
He made them coffees, too. Rich lattes that from Draco’s percolator that probably cost more than his kitchen. With the thin layer of dust on everything, it didn’t seem like his omega came in here much. Obviously working far too hard.
Looking down at Draco, Harry felt unsure as he asked his request. Of course he respected Draco’s choices, and he’d do whatever
Lyra was certainly an intelligent child, Harry thought as he finished their call. Her comment set him thinking, and he idly googled omega history on his phone.
Harry palmed his hard cock through his shorts. They were already damp with pre-come but what Draco wanted, he always got.
“Draco,” Harry said quietly, looking at his beloved standing on his doorstop. “What’s happened? Ever since you left I’ve not been able to focus, I’ve been so worried.”
Harry didn’t care so much about the sex as he did about showing his wife how gorgeous she still, absolutely was.
“Yes, Harry, please come inside me...” Draco looked into his eyes, one of his hands going down to his small cock, the other one pinching his nipple, sending jolts of pleasure through his body.
He shook his head, surprised at the level of his desire. He wondered if Draco would be amenable to coming to the OIW with him. They could be professional colleagues during the day, and spend their nights in the throes of hot, sweaty passion.
“Sorry you were bored, Draco.” Harry smirked. “You need more amusing than any person I’ve ever met... Good job you have other, considerable talents...” Harry laughed, rubbing his soaped-up hands all over Draco’s body, paying extra special attention to the round curves of his husband’s arse.
And the scene that faced him on his return was quite honestly, the most frightening thing he had seen since the end of the War. A woman with short blond hair was trying to get hold of his baby, and she was sobbing and screaming in fear.
Draco just let Harry move him, passively. He was glad that, for the first time in his life, he didn't have to make a difficult decision. He just let go of his control and rested against Harry.
Gritting his teeth, Harry managed a few gasped words. “I’m going to push against you now.... Might hurt, Draco... Just tell me to stop if it’s painful...”
Draco was funny, sexy as hell and he’d made Harry’s life wonderful. He couldn’t believe Draco thought of their lives in that way.
With a last pinch, Draco's hands left Harry's body and helped him with the job of taking his shirt off. Soon he was naked except for his navy blue knickers. He got away from Harry and took off his last piece of clothing before sitting in the sofa.
Harry pulled away, and kissed the inside of Draco’s tender white thighs. He pushed the omega’s legs apart, and bit lightly, leaving a tiny mark.
“Is... Is it good?” he asked, lifting his eyes to Harry, his tongue playfully licking him still. “Do you... Do you want to... In my mouth?” his cheeks were burning and he was nervous, but he wanted it. Oh, how he wanted it.
Of course they were everywhere. The press wouldn't stop talking about them. Rita Skeeter would write about how amazing Harry was for forgiving a
"How about we get some dessert? I feel like having some chocolate." Draco suggested, a smile on his face.
Harry smiled around Draco’s prick and then he set to work pleasuring him. He slid his mouth up and down slowly, teasing Draco’s foreskin with a dexterous tongue. Harry swirled his lips over the glans, playing with the slit before he moved down to suck Draco’s balls into his mouth.
“Come on Draco? Tears? We’ve only been married 24 hours, surely it can’t be all that bad? We don’t have to do anything till you feel comfortable, it’s your body. I’m never going to pressure you.”
Harry knew it was only a matter of time: he’d long ago accepted everything in his life was column inches. He decided on a dinner party at their home, a lovely warm affair to tell all the people he loved the biggest news of his life. Over a dessert of treacle tart and strawberry ice cream Harry made a speech.
“So... Our marriage is in three months. I think I have found the perfect place for our ceremony,” Draco started, turning a little to look directly to Harry. They were on the sofa, because they couldn't bother eating properly at the table.”Also... Do you know someone who could cast the bonding spell on us? It must be a very important person. And you know a lot of important people.”
“I love to know I make you feel good.” Draco whispered, feeling a little tired. He couldn't sleep with Harry, though. Not yet.
“No, mama!” Jasmine threw her new tiara on the floor, black, messy hair getting even messier. She was, as usual, dressed as a fine little lady, perfect green dress with apples sewn on it, and beautiful green shoes.
Draco turned on his heel as he stormed away from the counter, heading for the nursery to tend to some of his kinder magical plants; they always calmed him down. “I will not be Harry Potter’s next conquest. I will be his only or, I will be fine on my own.” Draco grumbled to himself as the door to the nursery opened and Elijah almost ran into him.
Draco smiled slightly with Harry's attempt to cheer him up, but being honest, he wasn't in the mood. He felt sad. Maybe in the future he'd get used to the possibility of being just him and Harry, but for now... It was too raw.
, said the report. Alpha, Unmated. There was no picture, but Draco didn't mind. He breathed in, knowing it would be another arrogant, egocentric alpha, that would look at him once and declare he was 'too much of an omega to be a CEO' and 'don't you want to have a family some day?'. Draco rolled his eyes, standing up with Potter's file and walking to his department, that was on floor seven.
Draco felt hurt. And angry. Harry basically took Jasmine out of her arms and sent her upstairs without even a word. She went. And she took a shower, and changed to other clothes absolutely fuming. She needed Harry. She needed Harry and he just sent her away.
Pulling off, Harry kissed a line into the curve of his boyfriend’s arse, licking and nipping lightly as he went. Panting, Harry begged, “Let me make love to you... Let me fill your arse with my wide cock. I want to feel you riding me, Draco-”
Draco sighed, drinking his last gulp of wine. Their plates were gone already, and Draco felt the night was coming to an end.
“And I’m going to make you beautifully clean, love, just enjoy it.” Picking up his beloved easily, he held Draco aloft above him, holding his legs clasped still. “Don’t worry darling,” he whispered, “You’re safe with me.”
His heart started to dance inside his chest, and he decided to make a surprise. He didn't want to tell Harry straight away. He was going to make him so horny throughout the day that Harry would barely resist when they came back to the hotel and Draco finally opened his legs for him. With a plan in mind, Draco went on with his morning routine.
They made it swiftly and Draco shouldn't have felt so worried, but it took him a while to understand having a mid-class life wasn't the end of the world.
Jasmine had decided that now was the time that she wanted to wake up. Harry sighed, a little in frustration. But this was being a father, with all its ups and downs.
Draco immediately got on his tiptoes so he could hug Harry by his shoulders and return the kiss. Thinking about how bigger than him Harry was made him shiver, reimagining the sensation of Harry's huge cock entering his tiny cunt. Draco grabbed handfuls of Harry's hair and touched his whole body to Harry, his nipples hardening and showing behind the shirt.
"Do you think if we asked Lyra and your ex for secrecy... Would they keep it? I mean, I'm sure Lyra would at least try. Kids are very kind like that. But would she really keep it a secret?"
“Draco,” Harry asked urgently, “what’s the emergency, love? Is there anything I can do... Talk to me, please. We can get though anything Draco, just please talk to me.”
Draco bit his bottom lip. His father wanted him to find an alpha, hn? Potter wasn't a CEO, but he was in the highest position after him in the company. Yes, he was unmated with a child but... Draco wasn't feeling very grateful towards his father at the moment and really wanted to piss him off. Also, messing around with Potter seemed like a really,
“Draco. You’re beautiful and this is... Well, it’s perfect. But it’s too much, too fast. You can’t fight your biological imperatives... I don’t want to make you regret your choices. I think we need to slow things down, think on what we’re doing... I think I’m going to go home.”
Draco couldn't stop crying. He hugged Harry for dear life, clawing his shoulders and wetting his skin. There were just too many feelings in him at that moment. He couldn't understand how Harry could possibly love him, with his past and the possibility of not having a big, amazing family as he'd always dreamed of. He knew Harry wanted a family of his own with all his heart, and he didn't believe when Harry said they both would be enough. It wouldn't. In Draco's head, Harry was just trying to calm him down by saying what he needed to hear.
"Do you think you could live like this for life?  Do you think you could handle me for eternity, even when I get soggy and ugly and old? I... Every day I spend with you I think that this is it for me. I'd love to have you forever. And it kills me inside thinking that I... That we..."
"I am... Fuck, Harry, keep... Keep going...!" Draco couldn't keep his legs up anymore. His hands were sweaty and slippery, and his legs fell to the floor.
“I know you’ll do everything... You’ll are such a wonderful mummy. And I’ll do everything I can to support you later in the pregnancy.” Harry kissed Draco, and stroked her white blond hair. He really meant it when he say he wanted to make the remaining months of her pregnancy as easy as they could possibly be.
Harry roused himself, knowing that if he didn’t get up, he never would. Harry could stay in bed all day given half the chance, but he’d sworn to Draco that he was taking her out for the day.
Harry gasped the words. Every word was true, every moment between them was agonisingly exquisite. Harry had never waited, never denied himself and certainly never fallen in love before. This was new, his brain racing to catch up with the erotic frisson felt by his body.
Being touched on his chest was something Harry didn't do with him the other day. Of course Draco knew they'd be sensitive, but he didn't think it would be
Harry laughed when he saw his wife’s beautiful head looking at him though the steam of their bathroom.
"When your idea of a husband was someone over sixty, every 40-something year old is young," Draco teased, smiling and showing his teeth. He licked his lips, enjoying his alpha's presence. Even with all the hurt, he wouldn't change his actions. After Harry had showed him his plan, he felt calmer about the future. "I'm very open to training. We did everything by the book and you popped my cherry on the bonding day, so I guess I need more and more sessions to actually know about it."
He also had put his flat to rent, and that gave him an extra money to decorate Iris' nursery when he found out he was pregnant - after that one first try at their bonding night.
“And I miss us, too. All the things we used to do... But we’re here now, and I think we should make the most of our night. Would you like another one of those, or shall we head off towards home?”
Harry laid his whole hand on Draco’s belly. Harry was so big in comparison to his husband that his fingers splayed widely, cupping the softer, rounder front.
Then, they'd come back home and play a little, kissing each other and touching, as much as Draco would allow, sleep together and wake up the next day. They explored Museums, old churches, food parlours and even the Grand Canal. Those were incredible days, and, on the last day before they had to return to England after their honeymoon, Draco woke up to no bleeding at all.
“Can we... Can we shower before we have this conversation? You know is a delicate subject for me. I really don't want to cry while leaking your come between my legs,” Draco chuckled a little to ease his feelings. He knew they had to talk, but not like this.
He scraped his fingers down the nubile flesh of Draco’s body, getting his fingers tips everywhere he could reach. His cock was hard, and leaking and his pre-come was mixing gorgeously with Draco’s wet slick. Their scents were mixed deliciously, and Harry thought he was teetering on the edge of madness.
Draco felt on fire. Everything inside him was burning, burning like never before. It was like something had clicked, like he was free. He never thought that actually saying those things to Harry could make him feel this way. Maybe... Maybe, in the future he would say all the things in his mind. But for now, it was enough to feel all of these amazing feelings.
Harry wasn’t fooled. This was alpha/alpha posturing and Nott was trying to assert his dominance. Well, Harry wasn’t interested in any of that macho bollocks. He respected Draco as a manager and a boss, and wouldn’t get into a stupid rivalry with the younger man.
Harry laughed at the keenness of his message, and how much he was really starting to enjoy Draco’s messages.
Harry gave Draco’s nipple a quick, tight little squeeze and moved his hand down to his husband’s belly. Harry loved that it was softer, that he could actually feel how much Draco had loved Venice.
Draco’s words spurred him on to even more fervent fucking, the tangle of their bodies spurring Harry to buck into his husband even harder, mindless with lust.
“Congratulations!” Draco's voice was pure cheer. His eyes were beaming and his smile was big enough that could reach his ears. He got up and hugged her. “I'm so happy for you! Having a baby is such a joy!”
To give him more space, Draco supported himself on the wall behind him and opened his legs, his magically sensitive nipples peaking, the air making Draco shiver.
Harry was incredibly aware of how little barrier there was between him and Draco; just a tiny piece of lace. He could feel his husband’s hard little cock through the material. Harry could feel the shape rubbing against his thigh.
“Shush,” Harry whispered, kissing a line over Draco’s shoulder, holding his body tight to his. “I’m going to make you come so hard, here in your green fucking bedroom, like you fucking wet-dreamed when you were fourteen...”
"I'd love to, Mr Ollivander. But... Will there be a possibility that I worked at a home office, instead of going to the company every day? Of course I'd do on camp visits, but with the company being in another city and me having just mated with my alpha..."
“The office is lovely, thank you,” Harry muttered, “I’m just settling into the new role... It’s very different, having a client-centred job. A lot to get used to.”
‘Dad! How is everything with my beautiful baby sister? Baby Chloe is being typically cute and cuddly over here and basically driving mum bananas, so I was wondering if we could all meet later for a play date at the park? That’s if Draco still feels up to the walk? He looked very pregnant last time we met, and that was nearly a week ago. Anyway, daddy, love you. Xxxx Text me!’
Harry thought a blow job sounded like the most wonderful idea he’d heard all day. Draco was all mouth and desire, and he couldn’t help but be enraptured.
It was as hot as when they arrived, but, different from where they lived, everything was just so... Spacious. The roads were incredibly large, all covered in cobblestones, with many trees on the pavement - yes,
"What are you looking at, arsehole? Move!" Draco shoved the money on the man's chest, ripping the coffee away from his hands and banging the door on his face. "
With that, leant back down over his lover, and started kissing a line down to Draco’s slick soaked knickers.
“Sweetheart, it’s fine. It’ll never feel like that again, I promise... Next time will be easier, you just need to let your body heal,” he gave the top of his husbands head a kiss.
Harry could feel how wet his husband was getting, and how much looser this was starting to make him. He wasn’t just going to thrust in though, he wanted to draw this out for Draco, make his husband burn with sensation. Pushing in another finger, he found no resistance to his knuckles.
“She’s famished; poor little Jasmine. No wonder she decided to make her entry so early. She wanted to make a grand entrance, a drama queen like her mum.” Harry smiled at the scene in front of him, his heart full of love.
Draco couldn't wait anymore. With a last kiss, he packed up the things he took off from his bag and they made the slow, slow way back to the hotel. They couldn't just apparate to it since it was all muggle, after all, and maybe the trip was there to make expectation bigger.
“Oh, you liked them. I’m glad.” Harry said, as he took hold of Draco’s proffered hand. “I wasn’t sure. But I promise that while you’re beside me, I want to make every moment special.”
“Fuck, Harry!” Draco's cock was already hard, and he could feel himself getting wet. His hard cock didn't change much the overall aesthetic of his clothes, so small it was, but it was already leaking and making the soft fabric see-through. “This is... This is so good... Don't stop...” he asked, rutting against Harry's cock, not even noticing what he was doing.
“I married you for your cock and fame, everyone knows that. But you were insensible and... And I still don't fit my clothes. You're right, though. I look in the mirror and I see little to no difference. It's like it's been happening for a while and I haven't noticed until I couldn't button up my trousers. That's it. No more cake and pasties at galas.”
“Leave! Go! I don't want to talk to you now! Go!” she pushed him again out of the shower, feet slipping.
Still he waited for a beat, taking a breath and one last debauched glance at his husband. Then he gasped, grasping Draco by the hip, and pushing hard into the warmth of his well slicked cunt.
The night was long, too long, but Draco kept his smile on check. They ate and they talked and the Potters had promised to be the first ones to give their baby a gift. It wasn't a surprise when they asked them to be the babies godfathers, and they gladly accepted.
“Of course I understand, love... This is my baby too, and you are doing such a wonderful job of looking after our little Jim. Keeping them all safe and warm and snuggled inside.”
“You get enough of me as you have now, Potter. Don't push,” Draco teased, but held Harry's arms as they wrapped around his own body. He got embarrassed with what Harry said after, and bit his bottom lip. “I feel like I've slipped off. I'm a healer, I'm supposed to be healthy. And above all, I'm a Malfoy. I'm supposed to be perfect... And not only on your eyes, Harry.”
Harry shook his head. He’d never say a word to Draco; he let her lead, and make their sexual decisions. Otherwise, he’d feel too guilty, like he’d pressurised her.
She moaned when his lips found her breasts. They were definitely sore and sensible, but the feeling of his mouth around the nipple was just too amazing. She raised her chest against his mouth, legs spreading so he could kneel between them.
Despite the early hour the alpha felt himself drift off to sleep alongside Draco. Harry supposed it was the emotion of the last few days catching up but his eyes closed nearly as soon as they hit the pillow.
"I'm sure my life will be forever happy with you, alpha. My alpha," Draco touched Harry's face, his grey, deep eyes searching into Harry's. His heart was so full it might have blown with feelings.
“Married me for my cock and fame? Ha, Draco, you must feel disappointed every day. Okay, you go and get changed and wait for me on the sofa... I’ll be distinctly unperfumed when I return, I promise-”
Harry looked at his husband’s beautiful globe of an arse, and willed down his cock that was starting to stir.
"Hey, Potter! This is Draco Malfoy, from the company, remember? Sorry about the time, I was thinking we could maybe talk a little outside the walls of the company? Reply if that's okay with you? I really liked our little chat on Friday. DM"
Draco moved, his belly up, and held Harry's hand, putting it over one of his breasts. It was such a comforting warmness, having his big hand holding that part of himself. It felt like he was protected from everything.
He pulled Draco to him. They’d had a wonderful, loving honeymoon and it had only made Harry adore Draco more than ever. He didn’t care about small-minded muggles pulling disapproving faces. He cared about the man he loved. He pulled Draco’s lips to his, enjoying their softness and warmth, the taste of pastries still there from lunch. Harry ran fingers through Draco’s hair.
Harry checked his appearance in the mirror. He thought he looked good enough with a new burgundy shirt and black trousers. Draco would rib him a bit about the colour, but it was one hundred percent worth it.
Their baby was definitely making its presence known. Even Teddy Lupin was impressed, and had asked to listen to the babies heartbeat spell.
Draco send it, already receiving many papers to sign and read. His secretary, an omega called Pansy, was wearing a mini-mini-skirt dress again that day, but Draco didn't say anything. He knew she was desperate for a mate. He just hoped Harry didn't look at her and gave up on their agreement.
“This doesn’t seem like much at all, Draco,” said Harry evenly. “But if there’s anything you need then we’ll go and get it, whenever you’re ready. And of course, anything here is yours.
“Potter, come and get your dog! She needs to go to her doggy house to sleep!” she called Harry. It was way too late for Jasmine to still be awake, but she wouldn't sleep no matter what Draco did now.
Was this really a good idea? Harry considered himself a decent guy, but a million years of alpha biology couldn’t be undone easily, and he wasn’t sure how well he could control himself if Draco was genuinely going into heat...
He was close, and he moaned into Draco’s shoulder, desperately wanting to keep quiet for the child’s benefit, but finding it a real struggle. He was close, and every part of his body was tingling.
She lost track of Harry, but then his voice was around her, soothing her, even though it was impossible to be soothed at the moment.
His husband was still tight, but good and slick, and it made all the air leave Harry’s lungs, feeling as good as it did.
Draco, however, wouldn’t adore him wasting anymore of their precious day off. Not to mention, the longer jasmine stayed at home, the more likely she was to mess up her beautiful and very ladylike dress. After all, she had 50% of his DNA and he wasn’t well known for his tidiness or his finesse.
his house if he got there. He didn't know what his father was capable to do. He had been punished before, in cruel ways, for much less. He could never promise Harry something he didn't know he could do.
“We should. I love when we are like this, only us enjoying each other. I love the galas, too, and all the fancy dinners that come with dating you, but... I guess I prefer wearing your clothes and breathing your smell...” Draco moved his face do Harry's chest, breathing in his husband's true scent and feeling calm. Harry smelled a little like amortentia - or maybe, amortentia smelled like Harry? - and it was something Draco would rather sniff, other than the disgusting aftershave. “Can I ask you something? Can you... Not wear perfumes or aftershaves or anything for a while? I just love your smell...”
“You like, baby?” murmured Harry, stroking his fingers over Jasmine’s braid. “This little puppy could come to live with us... I think we should book to see the little doggy at his home. Luna says you should always look at a dogs’ parents, to see what you’re going to get... Remember
As much as Harry was growing to love Draco, his hunger won out and within a few minutes both were enjoyed the pizza. As he ate, Harry thought how beautiful Draco looked when he was relaxed, happy and enjoying himself. His fiancé spent so much time on his appearance, and how he presented himself to the world, it was a simple pleasure to see him looking so carefree.
Then, he took off his shoes, socks and his trousers. Now, he was only wearing his laced lingerie, a delicate necklace with a tear shaped diamond between his clavicles.
“I don’t want to forget it,” he wrote quickly. “Don’t worry sweet thing, I’m already on the way. You’ve not done anything wrong... I’ve never seen anything so sexy in my life.”
Harry could hardly rouse himself, adrift as he was in his post-orgasmic bliss, but he understood that Draco needed to be left alone with his thoughts. Leaning over, he pressed a chaste kiss onto Draco’s cheek, his lover’s face still flushed and hot from the sex.
Draco was soon beside him once more, and they headed out to get into the Uber Harry has booked. They were going to Fratellis, an ice cream parlour that Harry knew Lyra loved.
After a while he managed to open it, and pulled Harry's cock out. He knew it was going to be big, at least bigger than his, but... That was
He didn't know if he was going to be feeling like this after the sex. Or after today. But now... Now he felt like he and Harry could do this forever.
Draco read Harry's silence wrong. His eyes started to water, and he tried to swallow his hiccups. He bit his bottom lip, trying to control himself, but it was hard. For more than a year, they have waited, and he couldn't give it to him. He couldn't do it. Why did he have to have this body, after all? If he was just a regular guy, like Harry was, they would've been naked by this time.
“I used to hear all this rubbish from my uncle when I was growing up... That there was nothing more valuable than a ‘pure’ omega, and that once they were used, they were
It felt so good just to lay there together, his heart beat slowing and his body relaxing. In a few months they would share their bodies entirely, without any boundaries remaining.
Harry awakened the next morning to a sunny autumn day that was alive with promise. Travelling to their bonding ceremony in the company of Ron, his best man, Harry felt no nerves. Instead he felt satisfied that this was the first day of a new life for him.
“But I think I deserve more torte... I’m a growing boy, Draco,” he murmured as he pushed his finger into the thick, creamy chocolate and wiped it down the thin skin over his lover’s clavicle, tenderly kissing, sucking and nipping it away, wanting to consume everything.
“I’m sorry, I’m just so excited love. It’s the most wonderful thing that’s ever happened to me... Well, apart from marrying you of course... and I’m a bit overwhelmed. I love them so much too.”
Even though Draco was getting plenty wet he wasn’t going to impale him quite yet. He didn’t want to actually damage him. He gave the pinker of Draco’s two nipples a quick bite just to see if he’d squeal. He pressed a third finger in, Draco wet and perfect around him. His fingers were everywhere, making a superb and incredibly lewd squelching noise.
In seconds, Harry’s lips were back on Draco’s cock, licking, caressing and stroking it all over. But it wasn’t enough. He pulled the knickers off entirely, and moved lower, sating his need for Draco’s cunt, and really burying his face deeply in his hot, smooth thighs.
"Well, you were the best thing for our business, and I figured, since you were out of your last job, and we are out of the Malfoy Company's contract, you might as well come and work for us."
He brewed two coffees, and placed a few biscuits on a plate too. He carried them back to where Draco had sat on the settee.
Harry murmured the words into the soft, damp material of the knickers, his mouth all over his husband’s cock. Biting the soft material, he jerked his head downwards, pulling the knickers down to Draco’s knees.
“I want you Draco, want this... Look at you, wet and slick and so ready for me,” Harry stroked his wife’s sweet entrance, and fingered her small cock.
Harry was aware of the subtle sweet aroma of Draco’s slick, carefully concealed but still prominent to his lusty imaginings. He might have gotten closer, but they were disturbed by a delegation of other workers.
It was too weird when it began. Draco didn't understand the feelings he was having but, after a few thrusts, he started to feel real, real pleasure. The way Harry's cock slid inside him was delicious, and his own hand on his cock was making him closer and closer to his own peak.
"We need to sit down and talk about what we are doing here. Our start was confusing and I have no idea where I'm stepping anymore."
He breathed in deeply, the aroma of Draco’s gorgeous scent filling the room. Harry felt close to orgasm already, his prick so heavy and full, aching with need and so much want.
He smiled, opening his eyes and looking into Harry's green eyes. Fuck, how he was handsome. Draco had
“Okay, love”, he rasped, the excitement in his voice obvious. “I’m going to move now... Tell me if it hurts or you want to stop...”
“Isn't a burger something cheap? Why are we going to a King to eat it? Harry, I'm not dressed to meet a king! I'm sure I can eat this whole whopper thing, but not while dressed on your tee shirts! It looks like a dress on me! Find me a restroom so I can at least change!”
Harry didn’t want to move. Having Draco underneath him, ripe little breasts under his hands, gorgeous mouth meeting his, it was just too wonderful. He respected his mother-in-law well enough, but he only had eyes for Draco today.
Draco listened to Harry, and she was too tired to say anything other than agree. She wanted to pick a fight just for the sake of it, but that wasn't the time.
Every urge of Harry’s was to seize up Draco and carry him back to their room. But he respected his perspective, and if he wanted to stay a little while longer, he supposed that was okay. It felt lovely enough to wrap his arms around him, hold him tight and know that they were bonded forever.
Harry felt incredibly pleased that Draco had been brave enough to say what she wanted. He knew how hard she’d found the previous few months, and how much she’d struggled with her body image.
When he was on the hospital bed, legs opened so the doctor could check whether he was still a virgin or not, he checked his phone, trying to look unimpressed. After a couple of uncomfortable touched and lights directed to his most private areas, the declaration of 'still a virgin' to his parents made him relax, but he didn't show it.
Harry started moving a little faster, cock still clasped so tight and so delicious. The sensation was entirely different to their earlier fucking: more sensitive and less pliant.
He pulled away and slicked up one finger with the Vaseline. He picked up a glob of the slippery stuff, and spread it thickly in, and around Draco. He entered him, sliding up to the knuckle with no trouble at all.
The last time they did it, it was the third finger who made Draco cry and suffer in pain. It didn't happen this time, maybe because they played a little with their fingers as they showered, waiting for this moment. Now, Draco knew he was ready for a forth finger, maybe something bigger. He opened his eyes, swallowing water pooled around his tongue, and looked into Harry's eyes.
Harry couldn’t help but feel a raw shiver of desire for his wife as she sat beside him. He felt keenly how attractive she was, and how much he wanted her. Some mornings he’d wake up achingly hard; and he’d been having the most erotic dreams...
He kissed Draco lightly, and nosed the soft skin on the side of his lover’s throat. The park was quiet and Harry didn’t mind, for once, being intimate in public.
She almost came again feeling her body get filled with his come. She rested her forehead on his shoulder, breathing heavily as she tried to calm her body down.
“If I’m being truly honest, and I remind you they were your words... Sometimes, I’ll be honest... Draco your gender presentation doesn’t really line up with your gender identity. You’re obviously pregnant, for one. Some muggle trans men
“I would've healed myself when I got myself alone in the bathroom, you know that,” Draco said, his eyes turning to Harry just before his husband kissed him. Draco melted against him, closing his eyes and feeling like he was exactly in the right place.
Draco knew his father was going to refuse, if it wasn't for his mother's fierce look in his direction. She handed the documents so Harry could sign, and Draco was happy to tell her all about his baby after all the bureaucracy, while they were sipping tea and Lucius was trying to blow Harry's head with his eyes.
Draco rolled his eyes, trying to avoid smiling, but it was obvious he was holding it back. He sighed happily when Harry hugged him, feeling warm all over. Harry was so big compared to him, that Draco felt his legs shake a little. He also had to control his own urges. It's been a little more than a year that they were dating, and every passing day, Draco felt more and more attached to Harry. He was beautiful, and sexy, and Draco often had naughty dreams starring Harry, but he couldn't give in.
“Okay... One finger is... Okay...” Draco licked his lips, full of expectation. He moaned with Harry's words, showing off his arse and opening his legs to expose his cunt and arsehole even more.
“No, I've never. I don't have this kind of habits, you know?” Draco put up her pointy nose, flicking her hair and looking at Harry when he was talking about this King.
He was wearing heels, since he was small even for an omega, and he did want to impose a little bit more. A
A sense of sheer happiness had taken over him. Also confusion, and sadness, and a feeling of being inappropriate. There were so many things inside his head, he just went with Harry. Let him kiss him, closed his eyes with the feeling of Harry's hand running through his hair strands.
Draco felt happy. He really did. It was like he was finally getting over the fact that he had his dreams shattered months ago. Of course, he'd never stop wishing it was different, but he could see the appeal of being just him and Harry forever.
Draco raised her head, licking her lips and swallowing the food in her mouth. Harry’s words passed through his… her… head. Confusion arrived again, and Draco licked her lips.
Harry knitted his hands through Draco’s, and led him into the bedroom.  He lay Draco down carefully, and rummaged through the bottles that littered Draco’s dressing table. Harry came up with a small bottle of vanilla fragranced oil, and slicked up both his hands.
Harry was proud of his computer skills. He’d certainly not used a computer at the Dursley’s, and there were no computers at Hogwarts. But Harry liked Muggle inventions, and he’d brought himself a laptop and taught himself to use it. And right now, he was happily researching the various dog breeders locally, and he
Draco melted under Harry's hands, and he had a smile on his face as he let Harry do what he pleased with him.
not focusing on when we were at school. I do realise we have a Queen, but Queens marry Kings right?”
Harry soon had Jasmine by the duck pond, feeding them bread and laughing when they mounted the shore in order to get even more of the tasty treats. It was funny, and Jasmine gave a big green Mallard duck a
“I want to touch you. Harry, I know I'm traditional, but I'm not a prude,” Draco started, raising his chin as if to try to prove his point, even if Harry towered over him. “I have needs and I desire you just like you desire me. I just want my first time to be meaningful and respective of tradition. It doesn't take the want away. I... I'd like to see you naked. Ironically, you've seen my chest but I've never seen your...” He eyed meaningfully Harry's crotch before looking back to his eyes. “Believe me, I
, I'm going to come again..." He whispered hurriedly, his orgasm pooling over his groin. "Oh, fuck...! How I wanted your come in me... I want you in me... fuck, fuck--Harry!"
have that? It was sad, but he supposed that was the lot of omegas in their society. An alpha could have it all; the company, the career, the babies.... But, rightly or wrongly, an omega was held to a different standard.
As soon as he entered the door he wasted no more precious time; pulling his lover close and attacking his mouth passionately with powerful, loving kisses. It was as if he’d been in suspended animation since they’d parted, as if a part of him was only now fully restored.
“I’m, ah... Enjoying my holiday immensely here... Thinking all about you and all your divine little body... Come in the shower with me Draco... We don’t have to do anything. I just want to soap you up and get you beautifully clean for our day...”
Harry held onto Draco’s hand, their fingers knitted together in the closest of knots. “Your vision... It’s what I want too. Want us to be a family. I don’t have a lot to offer. I’ll never be rich like your parents, but I can offer you happiness. Please. All I ask is that you consider me.”
It came to him like a wave crashing. The pleasure of his orgasm was so big that he lost his conscience for a moment, and all there was, was Harry. His cunt was holding on to Harry's cock with a furious grip, contracting around it, as he came and never stopped coming.
Harry shifted his body, suddenly unsure of what Draco was saying. Of course, he wasn’t going to bond with him, not right there and then. It wouldn’t be right. Harry wanted to though. He wanted it desperately.
He even forgot the tea he was making. Well, it was dead cold now. No need to worry about it anymore.
“I haven't drank in over a year, Harry. One glass and I already feel a little tipsy,” Draco smiled, her cheeks pink with Harry's compliment.
Harry kissed the back of Draco’s head, inhaling his soft, citrusy scent. “But Draco, please don’t panic about this. We’ve got years to try... It doesn’t have to be straight away... And even if it never happened, you’re still enough for me, you’d still the family I’ve chosen for myself.”
“How do we even understand them, Harry? I can barely understand the name of the rival team!” Draco sighed, biting her lower lip. She criss-crossed her legs on the settee, thinking for a moment. “Okay. I guess if I don't get on the field and you apparate me to places we'll be fine. I heard that they don't have a floo line, Harry. We'll probably have to use a portkey.”
After they had their breakfast, they sat on the settee so they could cuddle for a while. It was when Draco's phone rang.
But in that matter, he had to thank Nott a bit. The man was terrible at his CEO job, and soon enough, the company was sinking. Five months after the change in the company, his parents came to him begging him to come back.
"Alpha... I'm so happy you're here with me... I know I'm not the perfect omega... but I'm so happy you still want to be here with me," Draco felt so safe, he didn't mind saying things normally he'd keep to himself. "I'm your regular rich omega. Old money, old values. I'm the perfect little baby who was supposed to be an Alpha, but since my childhood my parents knew I would present as an omega. I just didn't grow enough. So, instead of being a natural leader and breeder, I'm made for breeding,"
, but he was promoted to this new function just a few days prior, and Draco still hadn't paid attention to him.
They left her house in less than half an hour. The only thing Draco needed was his clothes, shoes, some documents, hygiene items and books. It all fit in four large suitcases and a backpack.
He then moved on to the juice, trying to find something on his fridge. He didn't have fruits either. He sighed. Well, he had to order coffee then. He rested his back on the counter, all forgotten about the toasts, as he ordered two cups of coffee to be delivered at his flat.
“I’ll heal those for you, sweetheart,” Harry offered, stroking over them lightly with his fingertips. “I want you to feel comfortable.”
"I want us to be here... Me, you, and Lyra... Maybe I'll be big with a baby and Lyra would want to be an amazing big sister... I'd love it... So much, Alpha..."
Harry was a mass of sensations. The hot water surrounding him, the snug heat of Draco’s cunt and the breath that didn’t seem to quite fill his chest.
Draco smiled, crawling on the bed until he was close enough to Harry to nest against him. He always wanted to be the little spoon for the entire night, and know that he didn't have to leave. Now he didn't have to. He smiled even bigger.
“Oh yes, Draco. I think I can manage that,” Harry smiled, stoking his palm over Draco’s cock, enjoying the friction of under his hand. “You have a beautiful cock, Draco. It’s a work of art.” He stroked it, enjoying how silky smooth the skin was, how neat and perfect it was.
“I won’t, love... I’m going to fill every hole, make you all mine. I’m going to give you such fabulous shag... Fill your cunt with my come...”
Every time he saw Hermione it stung, but every visit, a little less than before. They went to galas, and Draco loved to show off, and when they'd visit orphan kids, he'd give them potions, and let them play with his non-magical medical tools.
It was a boring, tiring and exhausting week. At Friday, he was trembling all over. It was the first time he was going to his monthly check-ups after... Well, having sex for the first time. His period had ended the night of the day before, so he was fine. He went to the clinic, as bored as ever (or pretending to be) and met his parents there.
As Draco arrived home himself, and closed the door behind him, he was welcomed with silence and solitude.
Draco kept looking at his phone, waiting for some kind of reply. It never came. He felt his eyes watering. He bit his lower lip as his heart dropped to his stomach.
The weeks passed speedily by after they returned from Brazil. There didn’t seem to be a weekend that passed with a quidditch match, a trip to see Narcissa or a visit to see Ron and Hermione’s beautiful baby daughter Rose.
Harry grinned as he spoke, his fingers ghosting over his husband’s thighs as he spoke. Climbing higher, his fingers were soon stroking the front of Draco’s trousers. Harry would have taken Draco there and then, propriety be damned, but he wanted to stay on good terms with his mother in law.
Pulling Draco by the hips, he ground the slighter man onto his cock as the streams of come filled him fully.
"I'm sorry how I reacted in the end of the night. I didn't want to make you feel bad for being respectful. But how would you feel if you didn't make
Draco tried not to moan so loud, but it was hard. His whole body was into that fantasy, lost in Harry's fingers brushing inside him. His cock was so hard that it was about to burst at any second, his entrance sensitive. His cunt was gushing clear liquid, his pleasure falling down and wetting over Harry's fingers and his arsehole, making everything even wetter.
a natural leader; it doesn’t matter whether you presented as an alpha, beta or omega.... It shouldn’t ever affect your life, or your career decisions.”
Draco got a little scared, because although Draco didn't mind having a different body anymore, she knew how difficult it was to go through school being who she was. She didn't want that for her daughter, even though she would support her baby in any way. She didn't have her wand, because they forgot about it in the rush of going to the hospital, but she had eyes and hands.
“He hid me my entire life under a cover. I won't allow him to do that with my baby,” Draco murmured still, looking at Harry. “And I hope her eyes turn green, and her hair is just like yours and her nose is freckled just like yours. I want her to be a little Potter through and through. When I gave up my Malfoy name, it was for good. I don't want any of that in her life. And not in the life of any other kid that we might have in the future.”
Seeing Draco so upset and sore made Harry feel an ache deep within. He’d known it would hurt, but he hated being the cause of his loved ones pain. He lent down, rubbing his face into Draco’s wet blond hair.
Harry wondered at Draco’s words. From the confident, masterful way that Draco had spoken to him in the office, and the sheer
Soon enough, it was time. They both were to walk down the aisle together, representing their freedom of choice, and then, be bonded and say their vows.
agreements with the Ollivanders. They pay almost half the price the other clients pay. Fortescue already knows that and keeps nagging me to lower prices, and you keep telling me not to do that, sir. I think we should cut half of their agreements."
“I know... I just feel I would miss it forever. I know Mother has always been sad for only having me. She wanted more children. But she just... Couldn't have them. I was barely born. I am afraid... I am afraid that, because of how I am... Because I am not a man or a woman, physically at least, I am unable to... To have a baby of my own. It happens, you know? Most of intersexed wizards and witches are infertile. And all of muggles are. It's... I've always dreamed of it. What if... What if it doesn't happen? I'll be heartbroken.”
Draco was almost sleeping with her baby on her arms when one mediwitch came and told her that Jasmine would need to be in this special little bed with a diagnostic spell over her throughout the night. It was a warm, small bed that could be attached to Draco's own bed, allowing her to at least look at her daughter, even though she couldn't touch her when the spell was up.
we just had about our relationship, I think it's time for us to recharge. What do you think, husband?” Draco smiled wickedly, taking off the spells around the room and opening the door. “I'm feeling like eating some strawberries. Let's see if I can find some.” He said before leaving the bedroom.
“Fuck, Harry, you make me hot just by teasing me,” Draco mumbled, lowering his hands and touching Harry's chest, knowing well that he was the only one to do it. One of his preferred hobbies was to touch him while healing him on the field and smiling smugly as his fans looked at him with envy in their eyes. “Tell me you're mine, Harry... Tell me you're only mine... “
He breathed deeply and tried not to let memories overtake him. He had been blindsided when Draco dumped him with only a curt letter delivered by owl. They had been so deliriously happy, and he had trouble processing the words written. He still remembered the sting of each one.
Entering Draco’s bedroom, Harry realised he was nearly shaking with excitement. The omega was waiting for him, dressed only in lingerie. He looked like every one of Harry’s late night fantasies brought to stunning life, every part of the omega perfectly formed in his eyes.
“I guess we have to get ready if we want to catch our portkey,” Draco said after they were finished, his cheeks still burning a little. “You'll stay here for a couple of days still, right, Mother? I want you to enjoy it the most you can.”
The need to be filled got even bigger. His eyes watered with desire, his inner omega screaming to be knotted, to be full and
Draco supported himself on his hand, looking down at Harry, his eyes getting used to the dark as he observed his husband, touching his beard with his free hand.
For a moment Harry felt like he had quite lost his mind, as he watched his thick sticky come coat Draco’s cock and stomach. Warm and viscous, Harry rubbed his fingers through the spunk.
Harry didn’t think that Draco would know how to help him like he wanted at that moment. He unlocked his apartment frantically, nearly throwing down his coat and bags as he slammed the door behind him.
Draco was lazing on the sofa, reading a teenager witch novel which he felt a little embarrassed for enjoying so much, but currently couldn't care less. He was tired and reading about a Hufflepuff girl who fell in love with the Slytherin bad boy was exactly what he wanted that night. No thinking, just enjoying a mindless reading. He was wearing a white almost see-through shirt that he got from Harry's side of the wardrobe, and it reached his mid-thighs. He wasn't wearing any shorts, mostly because the shirt covered all, and also because it was comfortable.
“It's just a question, don't get so worked up,” Draco felt embarrassed, and crossed his arms over his chest, hiding it as he usually did when he was ashamed of something.
Thank you so much to all of you who have been here with us, knowing that this story was born out of a game and that there would be mistakes and errors along the way. Thank you so much to all of you who supported us throughout all of this story, and I hope we can give you many other fictions like this. Thank you so much!
If there was a thing that Draco loved more than Healing and Harry, it was tradition. He wasn't the most traditional person ever, it would've been his father, but he still valued a good tradition. And it meant that they weren't to have sex until after their marriage. When Harry asked for his hand - to his mum, as tradition said -, Draco felt over the moon. Now, he couldn't wait for it, because he wanted to give in.
Harry couldn’t even contain his joy as he pulled Draco close, linking their hands. There were huge obstacles ahead of them, Lucius, obliviation, memory loss, and so much more. But to be honest, they were strong enough to handle it all. At least now they had that chance.
Harry felt shocked, utterly shocked to his very core. He couldn’t quite get his head around Draco’s words. He frowned.
“I already love them. I already love them and I've known this little worm's existence for about five minutes. I was so sure I couldn't have a baby I missed all the signs... But here they are. Fuck, Harry... I still can't believe it... We're going to be parents! You're going to be a daddy and I'm going to be...”
Harry moved slowly upwards, kissing and massaging Draco’s legs and thighs. He wanted to take his time, to really show Draco how much he wanted this. It felt like such a gift, such a privilege to be this close to his lover; his wife.
Somehow, the notion of being 'her' felt awkward. At that moment, remembering their first time, Draco felt like not being a 'she'.
"Have you heard of it?" Aunt Bellatrix started, her high and raspy voice torturing his ears. "That Bulstrolde girl, Millicent. Is seeing another alpha. Can you imagine the shame of her family?"
Not wanting to get carried on the feeling, Harry pulled away. Brushing his lips once more on Draco’s hair, he moved off to the door. The pizza had arrived and Draco liked his dinner promptly. It wouldn’t do to keep him waiting when he was so hungry.
“And me too,” Harry agreed. “Everything. I’ve been dreaming of since I was a child, and first understood what a gift it was to be born an alpha. To know you have your omega, your one true person, and that once you bond you are theirs till
Slowly the noises of the cafe grew loud once more, and the sight of his daughter’s frightened face filled his vision.
Harry focussed his magic as hard as he could. He’d left his wand in the lounge and casting wandless was a challenge at the best of times.
Harry was furious, abandoning the hunt for coffee to go back to his office and stew in anger. He wanted to do... Well,
. To take the full bond. I don’t know... What do you think about alphas and omegas who do that? Do you think it’s a ridiculous commitment?”
He’d loved Draco’s humour, his mannerisms. He’d loved how they laughed together and how he could be completely himself. They’d been able to talk about everything, and he’d fallen hard before he even knew it had happened.
When Harry came back, Draco accepted the coffee mug, that mismatched the one Harry had, and smiled softly. Nothing in his home mismatched. They were bought to be part of a whole, and everything was perfectly on place.
Harry realised he was rambling, and that both of them were likely to be in too much shock to actually be making much sense.
He took a bite of his sandwich, and chewed thoughtfully, wanting to move the power back over to Draco. Finishing his mouthful, he looked Draco in the eye.
good enough. You’re clever, and lovely and a good mum. More than I’d ever deserve, really. Don’t say you’re unworthy. It hurts me terribly, Draco, that you feel like that. You’re wonderful.”
to have babies, but that's not as if I can decide whether or not I can have one or not have one. You know I love sex with you, and I have no problem with doing it every day. Me wanting or not a baby is not really a problem, is it?”
The feeling of Draco’s lips at the end of Harry’s cock was as close to nirvana as he’d ever experienced.
“Yeah,” said Harry, not able to take his eyes away from Draco’s naked form. “I’m up for that. I can give you some nice orgasms, make you come lots. I can do that now.”
Draco looked at Harry with furrowed eyebrows, then walked to their sofa and sat down, thinking for a moment. Hand rested over the bump, Draco thought for a couple of minutes before answering.
Seeing Harry in his bed was a dream. He was incredibly handsome, like sculpted by Michelangelo's hand, except his cock. Michelangelo would do one like Draco's. Harry's cock was a masterpiece, even soft after sex.
Sometimes Draco wanted Harry to touch him more intimately, and once, when he was feeling bold and closer to his PMS and his tiny breasts were super sensitive, he let Harry touch them. He had come with that touch only, and he felt super guilty for not giving nothing back to Harry, so he let him peak under his shirt. From time to time, Draco felt super embarrassed knowing that Harry had seen his chest this one time. But most of the time, he forgot about it. Especially when there was pizza around.
Now they were alone, Harry thought it was time to bring up a subject that had been worrying him. He’d thought they’d have more time - never imagining that their baby make such an early appearance- and he’d not wanted to upset Draco either.
Draco felt his whole body shiver with Harry's words. He was scared and he was nervous. He didn't know who could possibly out them, and there was a big possibility that someone could've seen them, but right now... He just wanted to be taken care of.
wouldn’t be to Draco’s liking. Perhaps he’d look far too old in the cold reality of the evening. He wasn’t the biggest alpha possible, or the broadest...
He typed out a quick reply, his other hand idly stroking a drop of come around the head of his erection.
Harry could feel how closely Draco held him, and knew that he was loved. Draco wasn’t ever one to use a lot of words but Harry had never felt unwanted or unloved, and he intimately knew how that felt.
About a year had passed. Jasmine was one year and 2 months old - and, no, Draco wouldn't say those ridiculous months age. Jasmine was walking, and speaking a few words, her hair longer and really, really smart. She was still very small for her age, but Draco had to remember she was an early child.
She sat and cleaned her eyes with her hands, hair messed up over her shoulders. Unconsciously, Draco touched her bump, greeting little Jim good morning.
Draco certainly took his time. He was even more sore now, and his hips hurt a little, his legs unused to being so open for so long. Maybe he'd lost his envied body when he quit Quidditch and spent so much time eating in Venice. His tummy was softer now, it was for sure, and he made a note to himself to start a diet as soon as he put his foot on England again.
. His cock almost reached his navel when he was over Draco, and he wasn't even lined up properly, so it might be bigger than that. Draco didn't know he'd be such a size queen, but here he was, craving for that piece inside him already.
“Easily.” Harry smiled. Draco would be a pleasure to hold all night. So small and slight, Harry knew that he could easily cover him with just his body. Just their bodies, pressed together with nothing between them. The intimacy of the gesture took Harry’s breath away.
Draco’s kisses as they entered their hotel room were searing in their heat and intensity. Harry wasn’t slow to reciprocate, and he pulled his husband into an even deeper kiss, arms holding him tight.
The moment he had heard Draco’s voice start to rise in octaves, Elijah had taken his leave of the room, quickly disappearing into the nursery, which was the farthest part of the shop from Draco and yet he could still hear almost every word. Knowing that Mr. Malfoy would sort out the situation, Elijah tried to relax as he gathered supplies to tend to the plants in the nursery.
“Every day, Draco”, Harry gasped. “Every day, I’ll fuck you so deeply. You’ll be so full, and your hips and back will ache, your big heavy belly will be so round, and every day I’ll make you come...”
Leaning his back against the back of the shower Harry got his stance comfortable and gave Draco as much space as he could.
with you. You know, coffee and cake in a cafe and a walk around a lake. Get chased by a duck or something...”
me. That was all I ever wanted. Love and commitment forever. I’m a proper alpha, I suppose. Looking for a partner and babies. She knew we weren’t right for each other. Draco... We broke up because I asked her to
But he still needed that comfort, and somehow, he felt the need of Harry's touch on him. Decided to get even closer to Harry, Draco guided one of his hands so it could rest over his breast, warm, surrounding the soft skin with that roughness that was all Harry.
Looking at himself in the mirror, completely white as a marble statue, he decided to use just a tiny little bit of lip tint, making his lips just a tad bit pinker. He dressed in his favourite - and most expensive - lingerie, a complex green lace piece. The bra was delicate enough to show his skin but hide his nipples. The bottom covered him almost chastely, going up to his navel, but being almost transparent all over. He called a local restaurant for their dinner, in case Harry decided to eat with them. Chicken and vegetables were fine, Draco supposed, and after that... He waited.
He couldn’t wait to tell Lyra about the bond, and tell her that Draco wasn’t going anywhere, not ever again. Harry wasn’t a fool though. He knew there’d be hard days ahead. Draco’s parents wouldn’t be pleased at the humiliation of their son’s bond with an older man with a child. But that was a problem for tomorrow.
“I'm sorry, I suppose I shouldn’t talk about things I can't give to you,” he said, the sarcasm falling out of his mouth before he noticed.
Draco grabbed his cup, sipping the coffee with pleasure. "I'd like to unpack. I'm wearing the same clothes of yesterday and I really want to have my comfy baggy tees back."
“We don't have a little James, but how do you feel about Jasmine?” Draco asked, her voice small and tired, but a smile on her lips. She was all about traditions, and she wanted Harry's family tradition to be followed too. A little flower, she wasn't expecting that. But she came and Draco thought it was the perfect name for a baby called Jim their entire eight month's life.
He wanted to fuck Draco’s arse incredibly badly, so he closed his eyes, casting a spell to lube up Draco’s arse, nice and slick, ready to take him.
“Fuck, Draco... Are you alive there or what?... Bloody amazing, fucking hell...” Harry shook his head, trying to get his brain to work. The reality of the Malfoy crest painted on the wall and the green drapes on the bed pierced his consciousness. He laughed.
“We need to go grocery shopping, Harry. I really want some celery to munch on. We have nothing here!”
Holding his hand inside for a moment, feeling the give of the muscles, Harry couldn’t help but feel awed by the moment. This was an intimacy only experienced once in a lifetime, and Draco had given it to him. His husband was forever changed as a result.
"I'm happy you came to your senses, Father," Draco had said, and he didn't ignore his mother's hand on his father's arm, as if she was the one making him go there. An omega's power, silent but final. "But I have a good job at Ollivanders' now. And I'm also pregnant. I'm not coming back to my old routine. Harry, on the other hand, is perfectly capable of running the business. And it would be kept within the family, as it should be."
“Harry... I know it's been... more than a year... Almost two years, but... Can you... Can you call me a boy? For today?” Draco asked, feeling vulnerable. Speaking those words out loud made the feeling stronger.
In the early months of his pregnancy, Draco would feel jealous of Ginny. Knowing his alpha had had sex with her, had a baby with her, was eating him from the inside. It was hard not to bark at her, but then when he saw her with her mate, his heart calmed down. They were two separate families, but Lyra made them one anyways. And Draco loved her as if she was his own.
"You're not so bad," Draco came back to Harry, before looking at Lyra again. "Yes, I am his boss, but I am more friend than boss, so that's more than okay. I haven't eaten well on my lunch today. What would you suggest me getting, Miss Lyra Lily? You're the expert here."
Harry seemed to be doing so much stuff around her and she felt useless. She just wanted those weeks to pass and have her baby out of her.
“I'm sorry, Harry... I know we've been waiting for this for a long, long time, but... I... I can't do it. Not today. I'm sorry. I'm... I'm really sorry.” Draco felt like crying as he said it. He didn't want to have to do it, but when he thought of blood and dirty sheets, he felt nauseous.
"It's good to see you, Severus," Draco said as he entered his old family home. The nostalgic sensation ended as his mother arrived at the foyer, absolutely livid, her eyes red from tears.
Feeling Harry play with his breasts, Draco arched his back towards Harry's mouth, his whole body exploding in millions of lightning bolts. He was almost naked, vulnerable, and it made him so hot he could die of pleasure right at that moment.
“Harry... Please... I need it... Just put it in... Fill up all my holes with you... Don't leave anywhere empty...”
His orgasm was building by the second, his cock rigid and tight with need. He bore down hard onto Draco, full of need, full of want. Every part of his body was tingling, coiling, electrified with the moment...
“Okay,” he agreed. “We’ll have a look at the RSPCA tomorrow, and see if any of the animals there are ones you can imagine living with.”
Harry finished of the last of his cola, and collected the packaging together onto their tray. Harry pushes it into the bin, and turned back to face Draco.
Harry thought this wonderfully filthy tongued Draco was quite the biggest turn on he had ever seen. Harry was ready to break Draco in, to fill him so deeply with spunk that he’d feel it even after he’d showered.
they always get what I want!  And I can only look and wish it was me! First, brothers and sisters. Then, you. Then, they were at the right side of the war, and now... Now they've got a baby, too?!”
He loved the sheer bliss that seemed to be radiating out of every pore of his beloved’s body, and the sight of him, slick soaking his lithe thighs, his cunt ready and willing and his beautiful cheeks flushed sent shockwaves radiating though Harry’s whole body. His prick was massive and swollen, shiny with his own pre-come. Even getting his cock in position made his body vibrate in pleasure.
you hadn't said I love you just an hour before. Which leads me to think... You'd say 'I love you' for whatever reason. And I'll never know if you're being honest or if you're just happy because I made you come."
“No, of course it’s not a problem. I just don’t want you to put pressure on yourself. You mean too much to me.”
“Now... Don't heal me. Don't even clean us. I want to sleep right here and now with you. Let us be sticky and gross for a moment... “
Two and a half years after that, Lucius was still trying to blow Harry's head with his eyes, but he adored Iris. She had both of her grandparents wrapped around her little chubby finger.
Harry was both surprised and aroused by Draco’s reaction. He didn’t think he’d ever seen this level of want in her face, or how angry her face was. And maybe he was a little angry as well.
She was so tired she slept almost immediately, one hand holding the bar of her daughter's bed, as if trying to assure they'll never get apart. She just hoped Harry would be there at nine as he said he would.
Harry didn’t look fashionable: he was wearing a plain blue jumper and dad jeans. Not anyone’s idea of the perfect, sexy alpha, he thought.
“I’ve missed this,” Harry smiled, amazed at the sheer adoration he felt for the omega in his arms. “Missed you. I think I’m finally ready to appreciate what
Draco felt her cheeks burn with desire and a little of embarrassment from what Harry said, but she loved it so much. She went down with him, feeling her body pliant and lazy. Harry's arms were warm and comfortable, and she felt like sleeping then and there. She stretched her hand, summoning her wand with a whispered spell, and cleaned both of them, because the smell of sex was getting just a little bit too much for her sensitive nostrils.
Harry loved breasts, and he loved Draco’s most of all. Loved the feeling of nipples in his mouth, their stiff, pebbly hardness slippery on his tongue. He loved how pliable they were under his fingers.
“That feels so beautiful,” Harry gasped, arching his neck against Draco’s warm mouth. “Everything you do is so good...”
give up everything for you... But... Do you know that in our constitution there is still a law that says that
Harry took a deep breath, enjoying the sweet scent of the perfect man lain beneath him, unsure whether to tell Draco the next part, but deciding to repay the omega’s own honesty.
It all seemed a little much, but Harry felt like he’d take anything at the moment. He requested an Uber, and found himself moving rapidly towards Draco’s apartments in next to no time.
“We have no preparation time. And where is this place, you said? Up North? I've heard it is even hotter! And we won't even get close to the beach! Fucking 'Middle of the World' place. The World is round!
it Draco. I’ll fill you with my seed, and you’ll get pregnant. You won’t be able to help it. Imagine
And today, I’m honoured and happy to share with you the news that’s made me happier than anything else in my life. Draco is carrying our baby and in around seven months - give or take a day! - our baby will be born.”
Harry didn’t think much of their seeker, but then, he only ever had eyes for the man sat beside him.
Talking about report piles, Draco's were even bigger. His office was enormous, as the only son and heir of the Malfoy Company would have. The floor was a dark colour of Mahogany wood, just like the big circular desk in the centre of the room. The walls were a cream colour and, behind the desk, a huge glass window that showed the whole city, as he was in the 16th floor.
Harry felt truly at peace. The bond was everything he didn’t know he’d been missing, and his body was completely relaxed. As Draco slipped into sleep he felt his knot start to shrink, and he slipped it out carefully, not wanting to wake his beloved.
Of course, Harry composed himself as he walked towards Draco’s office. He wasn’t going to embarrass his lover by turning up half-hard, panting with need. This could well be purely professional. Indeed, that cretin Nott might be there... How very dare the man, using Draco’s first name like he was an equal partner in the business? Even if he and Draco were bonded mates Harry would
Harry walked in, and had to hastily arrange his face into a more serious expression. Draco, it seemed, was close to a meltdown.
“Ummm... That feels lovely...” Harry murmured, enjoying the soft warm arms wrapped around his middle.
“Don’t be ashamed” Harry said quietly, as he sat up more fully. He could see that Draco looked embarrassed by her leaking breasts but he thought that she shouldn’t be.
"Leave. You're not worthy enough to be my son. I knew when we discovered you were a fucking omega we should've gone and adopted another. One that we knew was an alpha. But we thought... We could make it work. We could make a weak omega into someone respectable, that would find a good alpha to take care of him... But we were wrong." His father said, and Draco cleaned his face, anger overcoming fear and sadness at the moment.
He licked his lips as he felt his husband's hand straying downwards, and he smiled to himself, offering his arse like a prize for him.
Harry realised immediately that Draco wasn’t going to order, and narrowed his eyes. When was Draco going to realise that he just wasn’t that sort of Alpha? If Draco wanted to order omelettes and broccoli then he ought to just do so. Harry ordered the all-day breakfast, and then quietened his voice to let Draco make his order after he was finished.  No doubt Draco would have words with him about that, but Harry didn’t care. He wanted Draco to know he was valued as man, not just as an omega.
Draco was so incredibly wet that a strand of slick clang to his knickers, breaking as he took it off and running down his thigh. He was sopping wet and shining from it.
“But you’d never be owned by me. You’d be your own person. But we’d be a couple; be two sides of the same coin.”
“You’re as paranoid as you are handsome,” Harry laughed. “I’m up, I’m up.” He leant over and kissed Draco warmly, sliding an arm around Draco’s thin shoulders. “The people in these hotels never say a word... They’d never have any customers otherwise.”
“Come on, little pup,” he joked. “Time for you to be in bed, love.” He carried her through to her bedroom, and charmed the light shine; just enough so that she could sleep without being frightened.
Harry couldn’t remember an orgasm so satisfying. The aftershocks ran through his body, making every nerve tingle and filling him with a sense of bliss. It had felt so incredibly right; natural and sensual, their bodies ripe and ready for each other.
“Mandrake root, venomous tentacula…um sir are you certain you just want the one bouquet? We really should…” Elijah’s voice was cut off abruptly as Draco took the Firecall from him and practically screamed into the hearth.
Harry felt privileged to be able to touch Draco like he was doing. The kiss was warm, intimate and held all the promise of their future. Harry deepened the kiss, finding Draco’s mouth incredibly soft.
As the mediwitches came to take her empty tray, one of them cast a spell on Jasmine that made the yellow spell surrounding her come all the way close to her skin.
It was like a bucket of ice cold water was thrown over Draco's body. She finally moved as the woman's kid started to scream as her mother fell, rigid, to the ground.
They stayed like this for some minutes, the novelty of their daughter’s absence not lost on Harry. Eventually, he pulled away from Draco’s soft, warm lips, and stroked a finger done the side of her tender face.
A fleeting thought of running away with Harry passed through his mind. But he couldn't just leave everything behind like he didn't care.
Harry threw his arms around Draco’s shoulders, pulling him backwards onto the bed. Nuzzling into his neck, pressing chaste kisses everywhere he could, Harry wanted Draco to know how purely happy he was.
In the long moments before the door opened, Harry realised he was nearly trembling with desire and so much want.
Draco didn't answer straight away. He thought for a while, inhaling Harry's unique scent that did wonders to calm him. He felt sleepy all of sudden, and had to pry his thoughts out of his head.
“I think it's boring. I'd rather watch the ice skating,” she snuggled to Harry's side. She wasn't confident to ask for sex, but she wanted his comfort and his kisses. When he complimented her, she felt her cheeks burn, but also felt that he was just saying that to make her feel better. She couldn't be beautiful like she was now. Just... Not possible.
It was true, Harry was still feeling the erotic charge of their previous encounter. That was how it always was with Draco, the man was a like a magnet drawing Harry in, the draw irresistible. Massaging shampoo into his hair, Harry let the bubbles roll down his sides and his front.
When Draco took a breath to ready himself to give this ridiculous man another earful…he stopped at the sound of laughter coming from the other end. Draco glared at the wall, wondering why on earth this possibly nefarious man was laughing and how best to proceed. Draco had just recovered his train of thought when the laughter died down and a familiar voice met his ears.
. You made me slick and aroused with your voice alone in the first day I met you. I had to cover my chest so you wouldn't see my hard nipples... It was like your scent talked to mine. And if we could never mate or have a baby together, I'd rather not have anyone. And I'm very conscious that I'll die alone."
And just what was that water on his chin doing? Merlin, the man was normally so fastidious, so ruddy perfect... That little imperfection made Harry feel quite hot under the collar.
Harry pulled out, and covered his finger in more lube, plunging it in deeper this time, and turning it in a
They ordered sandwiches and pancakes for their breakfast, with two cups of tea. Draco cut Jasmine pancake in tiny pieces and took off her dummy. She went for it immediately, eating one and then shoving a piece on Harry's mouth. Then she would eat another piece and try to shove it on Draco's mouth.
was that he told Ron, Hermione and the rest of the Weasley clan to their faces. He couldn’t have the sodding gossip columnists at the Prophet announce it before he’d said something.
“How can I make you feel just like the boy you are, Draco? What shall I do to you to prove that you’re mine, and mine alone?”
"I'd be the most precious princess, I'm sure." Draco smiled, grey eyes glowing. "But also a very expensive one. I'm not very keen on jewellery or cars or anything like this, but I like to eat and I like to eat good."
As Harry stood next to Draco, made his vows, and felt the magic of their bonding twist through his veins and around his heart, he knew he was completely at peace. This commitment was entirely his choice and this relationship was the part of himself that he realised he’d been missing forever.
workers, Potter,” Nott sneered, spooning three large sugars into his tea. “After all, we’ve not seen anything of you... or Mr. Malfoy... all this week. Seemed like a bit of a coincidence to us workers, but hey, we’re not here to judge.”
Harry has to laugh at their baby. Jasmine has gone completely puppy-crackers. She wouldn’t wear her nightie unless Harry charmed little puppies to run around the hem. She wouldn’t put her toy terrier down and she was driving Draco round the bend
He tasted delicious, and Harry knew then that he’d never shared a more perfect kiss with anyone. Yes, Harry had been with many people, one night stands that had meant so little. But so often, kissing was just skipped over to get straight onto more sexy activities. Harry had never appreciated that with the right person, a kiss could be the most beautiful thing. He was exposing more of his soul in this kiss than through any of his previous sexual encounters.
He tried to clean his cheeks, even though he didn't stop crying, and moved his wand, whispering the appropriate spell.
"Yes, alpha," Draco held the blanket around him, hugging his own body and trying to be smaller. He wanted to be protected, and he really didn't want to think about difficult things on that moment. He had to make difficult decisions all the time, so he let Harry do this for him now.
She massaged Harry's bollocks, putting as much as she could in her mouth, eyes closed and nipples hard. Merlin, how she wanted that cock inside her...
“So we’re back at the factory this morning? I don’t think that Ollivander has any idea at all, do you?”
And Harry had told the truth when he’d said he wouldn’t last long. He could feel his orgasm growing in his balls, feel his knot start to grow at the base of his cock.
"Draco, please, try to reconsider... Your father... Your father can take you back if you just... Draco, please, it's not too late!"
Draco sighed, feeling like Harry was drifting to sleep. He wasn't feeling that much tired anymore, but he tried to force himself to sleep. He knew they had a long trip tomorrow, going back to England and their lives, now as a married couple.
Not that he’d give it, mind you. Draco had trusted him, and the regret would be absolute were they to break their trust. An accidental baby would no doubt be a disaster for all concerned. Not that Harry was thinking about babies, no, not at all...
“You know, you’re still the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen in my life... And I’ll make you come if that’s what you want... But I know you, and if I did fuck you, the voices would start to whisper in your head, and you’d be heartbroken and guilty tomorrow... You know I love and want you, darling. Let’s enjoy our day and have make some wonderful memories.”
Harry felt the most wonderful erotic charge as he stroked Draco’s breasts. They were warm and smooth, and he rolled the taut little nipples in his palm. They felt so good underneath his rough fingers, like the softest silk, and it left Harry panting, feeling so much need for this man and everything about him.
But it was only for a second. How could he feel negative with such a beautiful little omega on his knees in front of him?
Harry loved the touch of Draco’s thin, elegant fingers on his cock. He was so aware of the other man’s surprise at its size and girth, and despite how excited he felt, he wanted to reassure.
They were sitting in the middle of the living room, surrounded by his luggage, and she handed him the account with his money on a piece of paper.
“Don't worry, baby, it's okay. Didn't hurt, see? It was just a slip, you're fine,” Draco got up, holding Jasmine in one arm, the toy in the other hand, as she kissed her knee to prove it wasn't hurt.
Draco smiled, sated, snuggling closer to Harry's chest. His smell was amazing. It was weird, because they've known each other for a couple of days only, and Draco already felt at home.  Smelling him around his bedroom gave him peace, made him happy.
“I’m yours... Just, only yours Draco,” Harry’s heart was racing with the exquisite pain of his husband’s hair pulling, the plush touch of his body pressing against his own.
“Okay, Draco,” he said, nuzzling close to his beloveds throat and kissing a line down his wet jaw. “I’m going to go
“I can't believe the Ministry didn't take this child away from you the moment she was born. I guess it has its perks to have used a love potion on Harry Potter,” the woman looked furious, and Draco stepped back, looking around for Harry, who had disappeared from her eye sight.
“Is this...Is it okay? Gods, you’re so fucking tight, so hot... Fuck, Draco... Is this good for you?”
As soon as he arrived, he took a long shower and looked around his body. He barely had any body hair, but where he did have, he plucked them all out. He was very used to it by now that he barely felt anything. Also, they were so thin and blond that if he missed one or another, not even him would notice.
Draco closed his eyes. It was the most profound moment of his life as well, finally a moment where he was feeling completely and utterly free. It was his deepest desire coming true. Yes, he had met Harry for a very short time, but he knew in his heart that it was true. That it was what he was meant to do. He never believed in fated mates before, but knowing Harry... How perfect he felt in the alphas arms, how strong his feelings were... He knew Harry was
Draco's face reflected his relief, but he rested his head on Harry's shoulder for a bit, loving that Harry didn’t care he was also getting wet.  Draco’s nose scented Harry's bonding scar. It wasn't as deep as Harry's mark on Draco's neck, but it was there forever nonetheless.
“I'm excited to it. I keep imagining it all the time. I wake up hard and wet all the time. I'm wearing your jersey and some comfy pants. What about you?”
"Don't worry about Nott. We've been childhood friends so he sometimes forgets himself," Draco said, smiling at Harry and feeling like he was at home. He has never felt protected like this. It was only him in this big world, and now... Now he felt he had someone to be with him, even for a couple of hours.
Waking up early in the morning (he’d cleverly set a Tempus alarm spell before they’d lay down together) Harry carefully wiggled out from underneath his sleeping wife. It was still hotter than any place he’d ever visited. He slipped his clothes off and padded into the bathroom. A cold shower, and perhaps a quiet wank might be in order. He was on holiday, after all.
“You’re an awful fibber,” Harry said. “Admit it, Draco. You were smelling them!” With that, Harry jumped on the bed, and on top of Draco. “I'd never reckoned a man as straight-laced as you could be so deviant. I like it.”
Harry felt boneless, floating with desire. He kissed Draco once more, seizing his heated lips, demanding entrance.
He moved to the bathroom so he could have a shower and prepare for the day. He was resolved to go on with his plan, but he was getting cold feet. What if someone found out about what he was going to do? Something he has been doing for a while, but much more subtly. As he went on with his routine, he kept thinking and thinking. It wasn’t illegal, but it would give him freedom if he ever needed it. And he was thinking that maybe he would.
"I love your home, Harry. I've never been somewhere I feel so immediately protected and safe. Except maybe at Pansy's," Draco reached and touched Harry's knee. He wasn't really hungry, but he bit a cookie just so he could do something with his mouth. "So... I went to my parent's old Manor. Nott was there. He took pictures of us in the company's kitchen and showed my parents. They... They knew every single thing about you, Lyra, Ginny... Your parents, too. They said I should forget this nonsense and marry Theo Nott of all people," Draco laughed, because the idea was laughable at the minimum. "I told them I couldn't marry him. Because Nott was weak and you've fucked me already, just not broke my hymen."
, a decent guy, but it still left an ache when he thought about his daughter living with a different alpha.
“I’m sure my ego would have been incredibly bruised Draco, and I’d have dwelled on it all night. But there needed to be some sort of break; I’m far older than you and understand how easy it would be for us both to fall into something deep... And we both have our reasons to keep
“Come here, you dafty! There’s never, ever been a sillier, more beautiful creature than you. I adore you, Draco. You and our baby... But right now, I may well collapse into an absolute heap unless I get some breakfast in me. Shall we go downstairs?”
Harry’s breathing was shallow, and he was desperate for release. His body was electrified, like it was full to the brim with need for the man in front of him. At the back of his mind he wanted this to be the time, get Draco pregnant with the baby they both wanted. He couldn’t, wouldn’t mention it but he hoped Draco felt the same.
Harry knew he was big inside Draco, but she was tight and grasping his cock in all the right places; she felt perfect. He could feel the way her warm body was warming up to his massive length as the seconds passed.
Harry bit into Draco’s breast, the feeling of her soft, pliable flesh under his teeth a turn on like nothing he could remember. His wife was wet, and ready and Harry was achingly hard.
As it was Harry felt the energy drain from his body. Two orgasms in such a short while, plus all the emotions of their day meant that he was beyond exhausted. Hugging the other man tightly as the water pooled beneath them, he whispered into his lithe white neck.
“We’ll have the ice cream, with the banana, silly. We always have a banana split here. Daddy and me have been coming here forever, ever since I was little,” Lyra stopped for a moment to drink from her cup before continuing. “I’ve been hoping daddy would get a new friend like you, ever since mummy got married... I don’t like daddy being alone every night, it makes me feel sad. But you should tell him, Mister. Malfoy, that he
Harry looked at his gorgeous, red faced husband and felt like smiling. He didn’t though, not fancying being hexed into the middle of next week.
“I don't think me and Jim can eat it all,” Draco confessed, but bit into her burger all the same. She moaned with all the flavours in his mouth, so unexpected, and started stuffing her face. She just couldn't stop. Everything was so delicious she wanted if forever.
She put her hair on a high pony-tail after her shower, put on a lighter dress, sandals and perfume, feeling much better already.
He lathered the Vaseline onto his scalding hot cock, and gave it a few rough strokes to cover it completely.
Draco fed her and she drank eagerly, but now she was turning her head from Draco's chest, not latching anymore.
When he felt Harry's come filling him up, it was enough to make him come, and he moaned, loud, his whole body contracting, his cunt holding Harry's cock inside, squeezing around it. Draco didn't come from his cock, but the sensation of coming through his cunt was enough to make him see stars.
“To be honest, Harry... I don't want to leave our house. Can't we just go grocery shopping real quick, come back and be together at our settee? I just...” Draco breathed in deeply, blinking his eyes so they didn't cry all over again. “I feel like a whole pile of dragon dung. Can we just... Just... Just cuddle? Please? I know you need it too, don't hide it from me...”
. I've never had the need for lube. But I have Vaseline... Medical Vaseline, but still. It works the same, right?" Draco asked, looking into his eyes. He really wanted it to happen.
Harry smiled to himself as Draco marched out of his office, head held high. If he were being truly honest with himself, he had let work slack a little that week, and the telling off was probably deserved. He’d sworn that he wanted to remain professional at work when all he day dreamed about was getting Draco in that big double bath that he knew was in his hotel room that weekend, shampooing the omega’s hair, soaping up all of his body and massaging him with the most relaxing oils he could imagine.....
"Trust me on this one, Alpha. " Draco patted Harry's hand, eating his breakfast and feeling like he deserved that.
Draco was being a hypocrite, he knew that. He touched himself there before, but the idea of Harry's massive cock getting in there... It was scary, to say the least. And it was improper. He couldn't even have babies from there.
He pulled out, feeling a little bad as he stilled his hips. He needed to engage his brain a little for what he needed to say next.
"Harry, please... I've been saving money in case something like this happened since I started to feel this was going to be bigger than we were expecting. I'm sure, Harry, more than I've ever been my entire life. This is what I've longed for ever. And everything my family said about you... It wasn't true. None of it. Ginny is an omega just like me. She has expectations just like I have. The expectations of loving whoever impregnated you, of being married even though unhappy because this is what is expected of you. There's nothing wrong with you, Harry, but you weren't her mated alpha and she did what she had to do to be happier. She can't be condemned for having a choice. Just like you have, just like Lyra have... Just like
Harry raked his hands through his hair, shocked by the evenings turn of events. He brought up the Uber app on his phone, and called for a car. He’d had far too much to drink earlier to drive.
It was long after tea time when they'd finished. Draco had another shower - he hated the idea of being sweaty - and was dressed in leggings and one of Harry's shirts, one that he had forgotten in the old building where Draco lived and Draco had never given back.
“I wish I could stay here with you forever... But if I stay, I know I won't be able to resist your charms and you'll have an already used husband on your bed.”
Sure, they got on brilliantly, and still did. But great friends and good co-parents weren’t enough. The spark had never been there, and he could see from her happiness with Blaise that she finally had what she needed.
“I’ve never seen anyone as attractive as you. You’re a dream made flesh, Draco Malfoy,” said Harry softly, crossing the floor in a couple of gigantic strides. Standing in front of Draco, Harry tipped his chin backwards, and seized his mouth in a searing, passionate kiss, pulling him close, sighing around the kiss.
Draco was happy. She hugged Harry and kissed him on his cheek. She could eat it all and more, and it was something she would terribly miss once she was at England again.
Harry frowned upon hearing the sound of his mobile. Who wanted him at nine on a Sunday? He jumped up, reaching over for his phone, anxious that it might be an incident with Lyra...
“I miss you, too... I miss everything... But... I don't... Harry...” she searched for his hand under the covers, hers cold and trembling. “Can you... just...” she directed his hand to between her legs, and she was sure he could feel the heat. “Just your hand... Here... Can you? We... I won't make a sound... Or Jasmine...”
Draco was having the most amazing dream, where he was laying down in a field full of flowers, white and red, and Harry was there, creating a shadow over him with his hair all over his face. Draco laughed, and moaned a little when he felt the sensation of Harry's hand on his skin.
Draco breathed in deeply. Fuck, it was still hard to think about the damn war after so many years. She knew she was being unfair with Harry. She knew
. It was something no one else would ever have, only Harry. And for a moment, Draco felt sad that he was deprived of having the same from Harry.
Harry wrapped his hands carefully around Draco’s body, nosing the soft skin of his mate’s neck and running his tongue over the bite mark.
That was the moment when the ice creams arrived, and Harry felt quite relieved. He loved his daughter immensely, but sometimes she did speak a little without thinking about the words leaving her mouth.
He manoeuvred their bodies till there was hardly any space left between them, and placed Draco’s hand on his hard shaft, tending his trousers.
His body was shivering all over with pleasure. His nipples were hard, his small breasts bouncing and sending shivers all over his body. His cock was also hard, leaking precome, and he came before he even thought about it. All of his body exploded in pleasure, and he let his head get lost in it.
Harry took a deep breath, and repaired the vase. He disappeared the water and the flowers, and laid down his wand. He pulled Draco’s tear-soaked face to his chest and rubbed small circles on his back, all the time whispering
Neither Harry or Lyra felt like eating their ice cream once Draco had left. A horrible quiet fell on them, and the little girl struggled not to let any more tears roll down her cheeks. Harry squeezed her shoulders tenderly. He hated that she had to see either him or Draco in such distress.
is, but tomorrow,” Draco once again moved, a little awkwardly, and bit her lower lip. “Today… I want to be with you, as close as possible.”
He felt utterly relaxed, and knew he’d be falling asleep before he knew it. Leaning over, he kissed Draco all over her face, cupping her chin and finding her soft lips underneath his.
Harry had been intimate with many people, but nobody in his life had felt like Draco. It was as if the other man completed his very soul; like he was the final part of the jigsaw that Harry had always missed.
As far as Harry could tell, Draco was running the business singlehanded; an omega in an alpha’s world. He was trying hard to deny his omega nature whilst still being the perfect omega son. Nobody could manage so many different roles. It just wasn’t humanly possible.
“Fuck, Harry... I want you to leave marks all over my chest. I want you to suck them until they're sore and red and I'll feel your mouth on me whenever I put a shirt on. I want them to bounce when you fuck me, and I want you to hold them tight as I ride you... Please, Harry... Please, please do it...”
Harry found the most tender spot on Draco’s neck, kissing and sucking the soft skin there. He pulled away, smiling.
She grabbed his hand, put it on one of her breasts and pressed his fingers around it. She wanted to see herself leak on his fingers.
Harry returned after having taken out Monster on his evening walk, and was incredibly surprised to find his husband looking very shocked. Jasmine was already in bed, so he slid next to Draco in the settee, and slipped an arm around the curve of his waist.
"I feel so good with you, alpha. Even though my life is a mess, you make my heart beat a little better, my breathing normalises, my thought comes clearer. Your scent only makes me feel calm and safe. I know I made the right choice... I couldn't give up on you for all the money in the world... Now take me to bed. I'm tired and I need to feel you taking care of me."
“Well, yes, I’ve had sex before. And you know what? None of those people meant anything to me. All of those people wanted the saviour, the Harry Potter Quidditch star. They didn’t see the real person. You do, you always have and that’s why I want to marry you... In some ways, it’ll be my first time too, because I’ve never had sex with a person I loved before. And I love you, I truly do... And what do you mean, you made a fool of yourself? I promise you, touching you has stayed with me every waking moment, and haunted my dreams too. You have no idea what you do to me, how much I desire you... you’re everything I need, the completion of my dreams. I want you in every way, body, mind... And I want you to have my babies too, I want to see you big with our children, and love and support you...”
“I like you like this. So soft. Don’t be sensitive about your body... I could see you looked uncomfortable walking in... But you’re gorgeous, perfec.t”
And Draco’s cock felt like heaven in his mouth; wonderfully petit but so hard and perfectly formed. Harry played with it in his mouth, massaging it with his tongue and enjoying its sweet and musky taste.
"They shooed me out." Draco whispered to Pansy, looking up at her with his feelings dying little by little. "I bet there'll be someone in my office on Monday."
“Harry...” she moaned, licking her lips. “Please fuck me... We can do it slowly... Very slowly... But please... I want to feel your cock in me... Please, Harry... We can go lightly...”
Harry kissed a line down Draco’s jaw, tiny innocence kisses to show the reverence he held for the man sat next to him.
“I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t thought about breeding with you. Knotting you and filling you with my seed. You’d be a great dad, Draco. Brilliant with kids. I can see that already, and in another life I’d love to share that with you... But you
"Don't fool yourself, Potter. The alpha my parents want for me will probably be twenty, thirty years older than
Lyra declared that she would love a banana split, and Harry ordered two of those, and a tutti-frutti for himself once the waiter had arrived. They sipped their drinks while they were waiting, and talked about their afternoon plans.
It was a different feeling, but it was definitely a good feeling. Draco wanted more, but he wanted Harry to go slow still.
“Today, I want to visit Torcello Island. Do you think we can do it?” He asked as he left the bathroom, already dressed in some jeans and a t-shirt.
As he got closer, Harry was aware of his heart drumming in his chest, the sheen of clean sweat coating his body. Any other alpha would be able to scent his attraction in a moment, but luckily the corridor was deserted. He rapped on the door, bypassing Draco’s secretary altogether.
They seemed like the perfect breed. They’d be wonderful company for Draco and Jasmine while he was playing away games, and Luna had told him that their dog would defined his husband and child with his
“Of course it was true,” said Harry easily. “You’re a kind, beautiful individual who deserves the world. I mean, it wouldn’t be living in the lap of luxury, but yes... I’d marry you tomorrow.”
Harry snapped a picture of his trousers, his hard cock a gigantic tent in the front, and sent it before he could change his mind.
“I know you feel like you’ve lost everything, love,” he whispered into his lover’s skin, “but I swear... I promise. You’ll not lose me. You’re all that matters, now.”
“Oh, don't be nervous, darling! I've had two, it seems weird when you're expecting for the first time, but I'm sure you're going to be a great mother. You look like you're taking great care of your baby.”
Harry sneaked a look down at Draco’s long legs, so shapely and white, lined with fine muscles. Harry couldn’t resist, tickling Draco’s thighs in the exact place that made him scream. Harry couldn’t help himself; the pasta would just have to wait for a few more minutes.
He went to the en suite, showering and taking care of his hair. Draco wanted to be amazing for Harry, because he had taken care of him and welcomed him in his home...
“I want your permission Draco,” Harry rasped. “I want to spank your gorgeous round arse, I want to leave it red raw and stinging...”
“You know how sensitive they are... That I like them played with... But I want more... I want you to fuck me while biting and sucking them, I want you to play with them non-stop, I want you to hold them hard as if...” then he stopped. He wasn't sure if he could say the last bit, but he had to. “As if you were milking me... Please, Harry... I... Do you think you can do it?”
Pushing Draco off him gently, Harry pulled off his jeans. His huge cock, excited and rigid, bounced between them. Harry would be embarrassed by his keenness, but every time with Draco was exactly like this; he just couldn’t get enough.
Harry could only stare at Draco’s latest example of ignorance about the world of Muggles. He stroked her chin, admiring the sparkle of her shining eyes that still looked a little sad.
He was also tired, and missing Harry terribly, but he forced himself to only talk to the alpha as soon as he got into his car. He hated the way Nott looked at him when he was around, as if Draco was becoming soft, and the omega absolutely refused to show any weakness.
Harry thought how wonderful this week would be. The dinners, the walks, and just the conversations. It all felt like a dream really. Not that he was going to say anything; he could just imagine being called a sappy git if he said any of this aloud...
It was all there, all the smiles, and kisses, and the way Harry hugged him for dear life. The pictures were lovely and their love was so obvious, Draco would be happy to see them if they weren't his death sentence.
"Can we just relax together?" Draco asked, his nose red but his eyes shining. "I... Harry, I am so happy to be with you, but I must admit that my feelings are incredibly confuse and I don't really know how to deal with them right now. I... I just want to feel your arms around me, and smell your scent close to me. Can we?"
He felt his balls tighten and his cock flex into his wife’s mouth, spilling a thick stream of come straight into her mouth. Harry had his eyes screwed tightly shut, his hands tensing as they clutched onto Draco’s soft skin. Every part of his body flowed with magic, and every cell of his body burned.
Draco got beet red with Harry's comment, and hid his face into Harry's chest. It was weird, being embarrassed of such a comment when Harry was playing with his breast in such an intimate way.
Harry grazed his teeth delicately over his earlobe, kissing a line down his delicate white throat and finding his soft, pliant lips beneath his. He really was the most gorgeous person Harry thought he’d ever seen. Pushing his tongue against his lips, Harry teased Draco’s mouth, hoping he would let him enter.
“Have you decided on what are we eating?” Draco asked, without actually turning his head from the book. “Are you going to cook? I really fancy some pasta today...”
Harry’s awe at the sight of Venice was entirely replaced by blissful lust at the sight of his husbands soft, white skin, exposed inch by inch as he so, so slowly undid each of his buttons.
He kissed Harry as his life depended on that kiss, and he couldn't wait anymore. Not any second more. When Harry lined himself, but didn't push in, Draco lost his patience.
Draco breathed in, his body super aware of what he was doing. In the back of his mind, his conscience remembered himself he wasn't supposed to do this. But he pushed the thought away. He kneeled between Harry's legs and started to open his jeans, even if it was a little hard because his fingers trembled so much.
Harry wand-dried his hair, and checked his appearance in the mirror. He looked as rough and unkempt as he normally did. Darn it, he hadn’t even managed to have time to shave that morning! The Brazilian Quidditch fans would have to have a star seeker that was slightly more stubbly than usual. He didn’t suppose they’d care too much.
Draco closed his eyes, enjoying the feeling of having someone so close. He'd surely feel ashamed when he saw his parents again, but it was just so good... He didn't care about being prude right now.
without even thinking. The women froze, and Jasmine was freed. Harry was immediately by his daughter’s side, pulling her to the heat of his body and carding his hand through her dark, wiry hair.
Harry bucked his thick, lengthy cock into Draco’s mouth. Somehow it felt better even than earlier. It was hot, sexy and so, so fulfilling, and Harry was coming before he knew it.
"I can't boil water, if that's what you're saying. I never cook. This kitchen was given in the hands of the architect and it's been exactly the same ever since," then a stray thought came to Draco's head as he sipped his coffee, arranging the sandwich delicately on his left hand. "It seems like you took my virginity and my kitchen's, too."
Draco's smile got bigger. He sat down, even though he hadn't eaten that afternoon, from his nerves. He really wanted her to like him.
Harry laughed at her enthusiasm. “I don’t know. We’re having a week catching up with our lives. But I’ll give him your love.”
Suddenly, a commotion behind them caught their attention. Harry snapped his eyes to the room as he immediately recognized the voice shouting within.
He felt like coming, but he needed more, he wanted more. He could feel his body preparing itself for what was to come.
To be honest, Harry couldn’t even tell whether Draco was asleep. Perhaps he was, for he seemed entirely relaxed. Not worrying about clothes, Harry places Draco in the bed, and curled in beside him. After all, his omega had given him permission to stay -
“O-Okay...” Draco got out from Harry's lap and did as he was told. He made himself comfortable, a little nervous. He didn't know what Harry wanted to do, and convinced himself to just wait.
Harry hoped he’d been convincing, because he’d told Wood they were going during a fire-call only half an hour before.
She also got leggings and tunics, a lot of them white and light green for field work. She also made them walk around to a medical shop so she could buy a medical coat that fit her.
Harry couldn’t quite believe it when he heard Jasmine’s screams. Jerking away from his colleague, he found himself running back towards his family, his legs carrying him unconsciously back to where he had left them.
“I guess it's too hot to wear robes here,” Draco whispered to herself again, following Wood again. They walked about five minutes to get to the hotel they were going to stay. It didn't look like a hotel, really. It was like a huge manor, coloured in baby blue, from gate to windows. From the front, Draco could count at least nine huge opened windows, and a huge door, also coloured baby blue. They entered and Wood walked to the reception, where a girl was sitting behind a wooden desk. She had many muggle appliances on her desk, and she seemed to understand him just fine. Draco got closer, listening.
“Harry... How could I ever be able to even talk to her if you do it to me?” Draco asked, but didn't go away. It was so good that he was complaining only half-hearted. “What do you want to do to me, Harry?  What do you need me to do to you?”
Pulling Draco to him, Harry kissed the top of his husband’s head. He loved his husband, and wanted to put his well-being over everything else.
She breathed in his scent, and although he was too warm and the weather didn't help - thank Merlin for the white box that made their room cold. Harry smelt like home and love. She could just be there with him forever.
alpha takes care of them. Yes, Father, my beautiful hymen is still here. But you know what? I've given myself to Harry. Over and over and over again. Just not in my cunt." He said. His mother hid her mouth with her hands, a shocked expression in her face. His father went pale, and Draco felt like it was a small victory for someone who's lost everything.
Draco's body exploded in desire and pleasure. Yes, that was exactly what she wanted, that raw and rough desire. She didn't know she wanted it up until that moment, but now that Harry was giving it to her, it was more than a need. It was like breathing.
of your Muggle Studies lessons perfecting the daydreaming charm? You do realise that the Muggles have a Queen? A lady? And she doesn’t tend to spend a whole lot of her time serving up the burgers. She’s a bit like a Minister for Magic but most people actually
that only meant one thing, surely? Words were stuck in Harry’s throat like rocks, and he didn’t want to say them aloud.
His trousers were tented with the heft of his cock, thick and heavy with want for the beautiful woman in front of him.
Draco felt incredibly comforted by being between Harry's arms and legs. It was like a safe place, a place where they could be forever.
Harry could hardly get the air into his lungs to respond to his husband. Without even thinking about it, Harry wrapped his arms around Draco, surrounding him, holding him tight.
As soon as they got home, Harry sent Draco straight up to the bathroom, telling her to have a bath. He could see she was dreadfully upset, but the last thing he wanted was a big hysterical scene. He loved Draco immensely, but right at this moment he couldn’t offer her the comfort she needed. Harry was just too furious, his mind racing, simply too mad with a world that was so unforgiving that he had been forced to take up his wand to defend his family.
Jasmine was such a tiny chick, and it seemed to Harry that she slept all of the time. He called Hermione on her third day in the hospital just to see what she thought. After all, his friend had always seemed to be an expert on most things.
If anyone had asked Harry what was discussed during the rest of the meeting, he doubted he would have been able to tell them. He had noticed the tall, younger alpha, Nott, glaring at him as the meeting carried on, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to care.
“No,” Harry replied. “I think you’ve got every idea in the world where you’re stepping. You’re stepping in exactly in path that your parents have laid out for you. And that would be fine, it would be excellent, if that was what you wanted. But I’m not convinced it is.”
. Harry didn’t think omegas had been checked in such a manner for a century or more. He was completely, and utterly shocked.
Harry’s body felt supple and warm, and he felt infused with heat. He certainly did want to come back to the hotel. His prick was swelling in his trousers, pushing uncomfortably again the buttons. Somehow, this felt different from before, and Harry felt very turned on by the fact.
Finding the master bedroom left Harry speechless. The tall ceiling was only offset by the size and grandeur of the room; the bed was quite the biggest piece of furniture he had ever seen.
Sometimes he still dreamt of the babies he’d have loved for Draco to have. Sometimes he’d wake and imagine for a moment that it’d been real. But he knew it was impossible, so he’d never say a word to his husband. He has sworn to himself never to bring the dreams up with Draco, fearing it would hurt him.
“Ha--arry...” he whispered, his legs trembling at the sheer energy of their coupling. As he felt Harry reach the bottom, he swallowed the saliva that gathered in his mouth and tried to open his eyes. He was sweating. “Do it... Please... Move... I can handle it... I need it, do it, do it...”
But still, it felt great to manage his own client base, and not have to answer to anyone. There was still the matter of the CEO, of course. Well, no doubt he’d be a fussy, spoilt little omega, brought up with daddy’s money and never made to work a day in his life. Harry grimaced as he thought about the meeting they were due to have later that week. Harry has met
Pulling out, Harry pulled Draco into a tight hug, rinsing his hand behind he other man’s back. He only hoped it hadn’t hurt too badly.
But it wasn't. When they returned home, Draco stopped in the middle of the living room and couldn't hold his tears anymore.
scared. I know you love me, Harry, but I also know that I'll never be good enough. You insist in saying otherwise but... It's hard to see me as something other than unworthy of you. I keep thinking that the only good think I've ever done was Jasmine. And after today... It reminded me why. Why I was unworthy. I'm sorry I'm a selfish, coward person.”
Harry got up reluctantly. He wanted to stay close to his lover, but their sticky bodies and the dropping temperature said otherwise.
He run to their wardrobe, picking up the cutest, most beautiful lace knickers he had in soft baby blue and put them on. He got his wand and, concentrating, he spelled his nipples more sensitive. He touched them slightly, feeling them a little sore and puffier than before, and moaned a little.
She was still sore and her back hurt. As she looked at the mirror, she sighed to her naked body. Since Jasmine wasn't there anymore, it looked saggy and empty, all her new fat holding nothing. She looked away. Well, what could she do? She had a baby stretching her belly all this time. Out of the hospital, she would go straight to a nutritionist to change her diet and lose all this fat and loose skin. She wouldn't
Draco was all cool with the playing and the touching, hot even, but when Harry started to take off his trousers, he panicked. He didn't mean to, he just lifted himself on his hand and moved around so Harry would get off him.
“You’d love it Draco, you’re just too fancy to admit it,” laughed Harry, admiring the quiver in his husbands slim legs as he got up, and thinking for the thousandth time what a entrancing man he had married.
At the door was an omega, a male around his own age. Harry’s eyes narrowed, taking in the man in front of him. The omega was slight, and nowhere near as tall or broad as he was. His hair was long, very silky and a bright platinum. Whomever this person was, he certainly stood out from the crowd. He pulled his eyes away, unwilling to be caught staring. The omega wore a very fitted black suit, that looked obviously expensive...
"Let me be honest here, Harry. I never scented someone so compatible with me as you. I never dreamed about someone as I dream about you. And I've met plenty hot alphas. It's
Without waiting for an answer, Harry was next to Draco, pulling him into a long sweet kiss. It was easy to be open, and loving with Draco, and Harry  found himself deepening the kiss.
“You look sexy, you know that, right?” Draco whispered, feeling like she was in the first days of being in love with Harry all over again.
"Yes, alpha... Everything is green... Really, really green," Draco smiled, feeling his heat there, throbbing inside him. It would take at least five more days for it to go. And as Harry kissed his body, over his last piece of clothing, Draco almost cried because he
Harry felt like he was losing control as he squeezed and bit Draco’s breasts. They tasted so good, sweet and slightly of Draco’s honey body lotion. He knew he was marking Draco, bruising him, but he couldn’t help himself. His husband’s nipples were hard, pebbly on his tongue. His mind swirled and whirled, and he knew he couldn’t last longer.
“Is that something you’d like?” Harry asked, surprised. Draco “I know you like Lyra, and that family is important to you... But a baby? With me?”
They’d had a passionate thrust behind a curtain in the conference room; he’d given Draco a gorgeous blow-job under his desk, and they’d even got heavy and panting in their stationary cupboard. Harry wasn’t an idiot, he knew that people in their business were talking, and he knew the alpha spreading all the gossip as well.
But this was Draco’s night, Draco’s experience. Waiting in the half-darkness of Draco’s room, Harry waited to see what his lover’s verdict was.
Harry gently pulled Draco’s warm body on top of his, and lent down to kiss his lover’s sweat dampened forehead.
hand, she was sure - and just pain and strength. She was doing it for Jim, she tried to remind herself. It was all for Jim, if they wanted to come out earlier, that was okay, but then they needed to be with her forever.
He held tight to Draco in the moments post-orgasm. Harry needed to omega to know he was respected and valuable. But he also knew he’d have to take himself away before passion overtook him.
Harry pulled away from Draco’s body, and looked at the omega though hooded, lusty eyes. “I’m going to ask you for something now, and I don’t want you to say yes, or feel pressured. But I’d like to tie you to the headboard, and let me go down on you tied up. How would you feel about that?”
“Are you ready?” he asked Harry after he'd put on his shoes. “I'm excited. I've read so many things about this place.”
Harry closed his eyes, revelling in the ravishing, sexy omega giving him such a wonderful time. Even though he knew they were on borrowed time, and it couldn’t be forever, Harry didn’t want his time with Draco to ever end.
“Draco,” he said, carefully “I’m not the Alpha that you threw water into. I’m not a liar and I don’t
He could feel his orgasm in every fibre of his being, feel the blood rushing to his cock and the knotting glans start to swell. Draco was far too new to sex to take his knot immediately, but that was no matter. Most omegas needed to build up towards taking one, needed to be loosened up a little. That was fine, they still had so much time. He could just come outside of Draco’s arse anyway; he wouldn’t manage another knot in one night.
“I’ll always treat you so well, Draco,” Harry said, nuzzling into Draco’s neck and kissing him happily, a wide grin splitting his face into two. He was happier than he’d been all week. He had his omega in his arms and all the bloody Notts of this world could disappear for all he cared.
“Besides, there’s other things we can do... Now that we’re bonded, of course. What would you feel comfortable with doing, now you don’t ever have to leave?”
Everything was great. It really was. After they came back, Draco was all over the moon. Sometimes he felt bad because he waited so long to have sex. It was so good, especially because Harry was the one doing it with him, and it always felt amazing. The way he touched him, the way he looked at him in the eye and gave it all, like the Gryffindor he was. Draco felt amazing.
“Can't you ask for takeout past-- HEY! That's my book! I'm intellectual but even smart people like to have fun, you stupid oaf!” Draco moved so he could grab the book back, but Harry's hand made his head all fussy and he stopped thinking for a moment there. He braced himself on the sofa, his legs opening unconsciously. “Potter... What are you doing? Give... Give my book back...”
He looked at how Harry's hand moved above his, up and down, and started to try to replicate the touch. He wanted to please him, to make it good for him. His eyes were fixated on the pearl drops of his pre-come falling from the tip of his cock, and, without thinking, Draco got closer, licking the drop. The flavour was weird, salty and sweet at the same time, but when he did the first time, he wanted more. He kissed the head of Harry's cock, not trusting that it would fit his mouth, a licked slowly as his hand went up and down the shaft.
“Feeling romantic today, Potter?” She asked, smiling and giving room so Harry could give her her breakfast. Her mouth watered with the scent of toast and honey. “And yes, please. I can't go to work using your clothes all the time. People will think I'm sloppy. What will you have for breakfast?”
“Ummm, that sounds delicious, Draco,” said Harry, nearly growling in anticipation. “Don’t know how I’m going to be able to focus all afternoon when I’ve got you to look forward to tonight.”
"I live near the company, in the Bright Sun Residence Hotel. Is it far from you? Can you come here now? I need you."
His pale skin was little by little showing itself. He wasn't using anything under his robes besides his tailored trousers and pants.
Harry moved closer and found Draco’s lips, biting them slightly and pushing his tongue against the soft mouth of his husband. If Draco wanted to be his boy, then Harry could certainly oblige.
Draco left the bed, slowly, trying not to wake Harry. He really needed to empty his bladder, so he tiptoed to the bathroom to do so. After, he decided to wash his face and brush his teeth, since he was already there, and sighed as his stomach grumbled. A rice cracker wasn't enough dinner, he supposed.
Jasmine was happily munching on a banana, dirtying herself more than eating it, but Draco supposed she had to let Jasmine learn how to do things by herself. They ate their sandwiches and drank juice, all the while observing how Jasmine reacted to the world around her. She was curious, and absolutely
“The worm will have your eyebrows, and your eyes... Also, they can have your height, I'd like them to be tall... Maybe they'll have your hands, and your bum... But I hope they have my knees, Merlin forbid they have yours. Also, they must have my hair and my nose. They can have any of our mouths. They are pretty good, I think...”
“Well, too bad! I think I had at least half of this plate of cheese,” Draco laughed, a little drunk on passion fruit juice. “We can have it, Harry! It is great! Jim loves it too!”
to get hold of the dog. Magical pet shops were out. They dealt with magical creatures only. He’d have go to the Muggles, but that was no trouble. He decided to go online. There was an Internet cafe a few streets away, and Harry knew he’d find the information - and the dog - he desired.
asked, but after two years... Well, it was a long time, and Harry was the first to admit he’d become used to the status quo.
When Draco received Harry's text, he was about to put his food on his plate so he could eat. His eyebrows shot up to his hairline as he completely forgot about Harry in his plan to keep some money safe. He needed to go and fix his stuff before having breakfast with Harry then.
Harry decided to stay for another hour or so before leaving to go home and get changed. He’d use the emergency door, save Draco’s worries, and give the omega a chance to feel a little better. This afternoon, they were professionals working alongside each other, and they had to conduct themselves accordingly, or risk exposure.
They cuddled together that night, eating ice-cream and just enjoying each other's presence, waiting for the pain to get easier to bear.
Pushing against Draco’s burning heat, Harry pushed into his beloved, opening him, showing him with his fingers how much he was desired.
that. They've told me plenty of times. I work hard because I love this company and I love my work, but I know this is going to be my job just until I'm married. Once I turn 30, they'll force me to make a decision. Either marry the alpha they've chosen me, or don't marry at all."
Harry felt his orgasm start to rip though him like a spear. It seemed to come from his cock, and spread out to the whole rest of his body. He couldn’t ever remember it feeling so powerful before.
“I don't think having such a tiny dog would protect us from anything. If they are roughly the size of a crup, then the attacker would just have to kick them out of the way,” Draco raised her eyebrow, looking at Harry. “But... You can show me what you're thinking and we should have a think together.”
His first orgasm did wonders to his body, and he already was leaking again around Harry's digits. He knew he could take more.
“I was looking at your Instagram, and I searched around on your pictures and then I found Lyra’s mum and I wasn’t meaning to, but then I liked one of her photos and now she’s messaged me! Harry I don’t know what to do! What if she knows about us? What if she hates me and doesn’t want me to meet Lyra?”
Harry lavished kisses all over her silky hair - which he thought was even more thick and glossy with the pregnancy - and found her lips. He wanted Draco to know she was utterly loved and wanted.
“Those kind of fictions Draco? I have simply no idea what you mean. None at all. Nope, if I’m going to help you, you need to give me a few more pertinent
And then he was coming, hot streams of spunk filling his wife and spilling over the pair of them. He held their bodies together, their bodies slick with sweat and Harry’s heart hammering a beat in his chest.
Draco didn't know much about laptops, being honest.  Just that she could see shops inside it and sometimes the mail would drop things on their post box or something. And they could watch muggle films in it as well.
“It's not going to happen. I'm broken. It's... It's never going to happen,” Draco declared, trying not to cry. Trying not to feel dead about it. “Can we... Can we please skip our diet today? I really want a whole glass of ice-cream and two bars of chocolate.”
The bath was fabulously large and ornate. Harry had fucked in a few bathrooms in his time, but this had to be the most fancy of his life. This was one for the Pensieve, he decided.
But he knew he couldn’t push, couldn’t prod. Even after all these months, Draco was still likely to close up, shut down.
Harry could see how much this was costing Draco to say, how deep his husband had to wrench the words from inside his heart.
“I’m here,” he whispered, their hearts syncing as they beat next to one another in the comfort of Draco’s bed. “And I don’t want to leave. You’re safe, with me, and I’m not letting go. We’ll lay, and you can tell me about your life, and your family, and anything else. I want to know everything.”
Summoning the massage oil from their on-suite bathroom, he poured a little onto the base of his husbands back, where his waist was the narrowest. Harry wanted Draco to be utterly relaxed, and to forget all of the stresses the last few days.
Harry looked down at the wanton sight of his lover, his come still leaking a line from Draco’s arsehole onto his fine, white thighs. Harry shivered, feeling overwhelmed with the emotions overtaking his body and his mind.
Hours later, he was passed out on his bed, naked and snuggled against Harry as if his life depended on this. He wasn't worried that Harry would sneak off in the middle of the night. Maybe he would. But to know that he'd still be his boyfriend in the next morning made Draco feel like the king of the world.
Harry saw the tears rolling down his loved one’s face and he felt his own heart break. He’d never defined their relationship in those terms, had considered them only as equals. Sure, he’d asked his bosses to give Draco the job... but they’d needed a healer.
When she got back to their bedroom, Jasmine was sleeping soundly. What did Harry do to her?  It made Draco a little angry because it wasn't her who put their baby to sleep, but she was thankful that Jasmine was sleeping now.
They were incredibly caring, kind and their busy professionalism was enabled Harry to actually start breathing again. He hadn’t even realised he’d been holding his breath until he slowly filled his chest with air again.
“No, I don’t care about that... It’s part of you. Every time you bleed it’s your body telling me it’s getting ready for me to put a baby there... So, I love it. You’re perfect and so ready for me...”
Draco spent the whole day in the verge of crying. Not because of the wedding, he was pretty excited to it. As he checked himself in the mirror and Pansy fussed about his hair and robes, he kept thinking about that morning and how he wouldn't have his dream wedding night. At least not now.
Draco closed his eyes, imagining the day that Harry would fuck him in all his holes, fuck him in his cunt and pour his seed deep inside his womb. The day that Harry would fuck a baby into him, make him full like in their fantasy... Out of control, Draco came, his arse twitching around Harry, his walls grabbing him, pulling him inside as he moaned his lover's name over and over.
Harry didn’t have time for another word as the limousine had arrived at the factory. He swallowed down any further words as the driver came around to open the door. Harry respected Draco, letting him exit the car first. It wouldn’t do to give anyone anything to gossip about.
He moved slowly, letting his husband get used to the feeling, enjoying the moment. His huge cock felt completely clasped, smothered in heat and slick, and he was so, so excited.
"Harry, I... I don't know what to say... I just... I'm sorry, it's just that a lot of things are happening at the same time. I'd love anything, really. I'm happy just being with you. Let me think about it, okay? We'll... We'll talk about it soon and when I'm feeling capable of holding my tears we'll discuss it again."
Draco hit send, then he reread his message. He did it without noticing, but had he ever told Harry 'I love you' with all of the words? He didn't think so. And he just said 'ly' like it was the most normal thing to send his lover.
Draco bit his bottom lip, hard, hands pressing himself so tightly his skin was turning red around his fingers.
“Stay and I’ll make you feel nice, baby...” Harry moved his hands downwards to the front of Draco’s shorts.
. Wood has told him the muggles who lived locally believed it was deserted, but it was actually a thriving wizarding community.
Once they were done, Harry held the door open for a red-eyed Draco, and they set off walking down the road. Harry locked their fingers together in a rough knot, and pulled him close. “So happy I can be yours. So happy that I can kiss you in the street, and not care about who can see us.”
He got up, still completely naked, and walked to a mirror, looking at himself. He looked good. Beautiful, and somehow different. He looked... Complete, with the mark on his neck.
He held himself up, touching his chest and resting his head on the sofa's cushion, putting his hand down. One of them pinched his nipple, hard, and as he was deciding either to touch his cock or his arsehole, Harry came inside of him.
He kissed Draco hard, finding the smaller man’s lips once more, enjoying their softness and their yielding warmth. Harry wrapped his fingers through Draco’s soft blond hair, revelling in the rich scent surrounding them both. That reminded Harry of Draco’s other question, and his alpha nature roared into life.
“A couple of touches and here you are on the want... If you weren’t so hot, I’d have half a mind to make you wait a bit longer. As it is...”
“Queens marry princes, Draco. This country doesn’t actually even have a king.... You certainly look like you’re enjoying that-” said Harry, breaking off to bite his own burger.
," Draco whispered, a little scared that the man would see them and say something. He pushed Harry a little, although a smile was on his face.
“No, I don’t think you would,” Harry said sadly. It seemed such a pity that Draco had given up so much for a role and a job that hadn’t been his passion.  He hoped he was worth it, not wanting Draco to risk any more than he already had.
Harry texted back quickly, suddenly beyond excited at the thought of seeing Draco. They’d not really seen each other for the whole week, and had only talked in professional emails. It simply hadn’t been enough, and every part of his alpha soul had been crying out to have his lover close, skin-on-skin, their scents mingling and filling the air.
"Harry... I... I really wanted to say what I'm feeling right now... But I don't think I can put it into words..." Draco said, looking at him and caressing his hair. "Are we forever?"
He finished with his hair and looked at himself in the mirror, naked. He put the comb on the sink top and raised his hands, cupping his small breasts.
Harry looped his arms around Draco’s smaller shoulder and they started on the path towards their home. Because, Harry supposed, that was what it was now. Their home, their space. It was a wonderful thought and even though they were quiet, Harry knew he was smiling.
"I guess I can make an exception for you, alpha," his smile got bigger. “But now... Please, just hold me tight...”
“I was bored of waiting, you twat,” Draco said, but smiled with Harry's touches. He loved how his big hands could just cup his arse and tits, like he was made for Harry's hands. “I know a lot of talents you have that amuse me a lot. Especially with your tongue...” Draco laughed, kissing Harry's shoulder. He washed his hair, untangled it with conditioner and just made his whole beauty routine even after Harry had finished cleaning himself.
