"Gilbert has been harassing me," he responds quickly, avoiding direct eye contact. "He hasn't stopped since... He does it all the time, yesterday he said that..."
The first few months of the new year are always Draco's favorites, with the spring graffiti coming in and Quidditch matches the order of the day, he barely has time to be distracted by his own thoughts.
"I'm not quite sure it's appropriate for Lupin to see his two fathers with penises drawn on their faces."
Malfoy feels his heart pounding in his chest repeatedly until he nods at Harry.
"I'm talking about soup, who eats soup of their own free will?" Neville growls crossing one leg over the other. "Why don't you invite MacMillan over to your place?"
Draco feels the blow to the stomach, he doesn't know if the color is fading from his face or if it's red. He cannot define what he's feeling right now. Mcgonagall stands up pulling the chair back and stands in front of him.
How likely is it?
"I guess we should celebrate, right?"
"For today's game we have the newest Hogwarts teacher, Gryffindor house boss Harry Potter, as referee." A general cheer floods the field, Teddy smiles before continuing. "The first team to make an appearance is Slytherin. Fresia McKinnon is in the lead guiding the lineup, behind her is superb puncher Jerome François recovering from his injury last year. What do we have here! Gryffindor's Darrell Jones is not intimidated and flips into the sky, is that a Centella 3006? Wonderful! One for each team member. What a great game awaits us with brooms of that caliber."
"If I find out again that a student in my house is doing that kind of stupid thing one more time, I will not hold back, I swear by Salazar that I will move heaven, sea and earth to have them expelled." Nobody flinches too much. "This year his behavior has been terrible, every week I have to lower points to my own house and take charge of the detention of at least three students. If this is because I am being too soft, then forget about me, there will be no further consideration, and I will not hold back from lowering the house four hundred points if necessary. Merlin! Get that face off, Joanne."
"Who's God?" Connor asks to which Felicity shrugs.
"No, he has to prepare his tests for Monday morning ..." They are both silent for a couple of seconds until Harry lifts a finger and turns to him, taking his arm. "Would you go with me, Draco?"
"I only wanted to help you!"
"Shit, if you ever mention fucking yule one more time I'm going to rip my eyelids off."
"What the hell are you doing here?"
"Hi," Harry says.
Teddy leaves a scroll as long as Connor's. Evan huffs and hits him playfully with his shoulder.
The two of them are drunk when they are outside Draco's apartment, and it is not until that moment that he realizes what this implies, all that it implies to bring Harry Potter to his home; Technically he was opening up what might be the most private place for him to Harry, and somehow, in a very alarming way, that made him feel strange, almost defensive.
"What do I do about what?"
"What do I do first?"
"Yule sucks."
Silence.
Oh, sweet Helga, why did you send this angel just now? Why when he's sweaty and red and definitely not very present to see the love of his life?
Evan McGregor and Connor Tremlett are auditioning for choir. Evelyn Wolff accompanies them and she also does auditions. They aren't amazing, but he lets them in.
The matter is bullshit and he feels like one, certainly.
"It doesn't seem like Christmas around here." He jokes pointing at the room. He pulls his wand out of his coat bag "Can I?"
When Draco was younger, probably at fourteen or fifteen he discovered that if he played chess with Crabbe or Goyle for more than fifteen minutes a little tic would appear in his left eye, then with the arrival of the fucking dark lord and his family getting him into shit that they were too much. Too much for a sixteen year old who hardly knows enough about the world around him to have to choose a path without favorable options. Everything about him during that time was a stress that consumed him, left him without sleep, and became thinner. He lost any trace of the tic despite everything, not even the war made it come back to him. But here is this girl who cannot measure more than 5'5 and makes her tic return in less than a mandrake cries.
Draco rolls his eyes in disgust, Ernie smiles shyly at him and if it weren't for his presence Neville would already be hammering right and left. "Ernie and I are going to a bar."
"Oh, yeah, Ron told me about it a couple of days ago." Neville nods with his cheeks still very red, he wants to run to the nearest bathroom to wipe off the light layer of sweat that falls on his forehead. But sweat is sexy according to some of the girls. Neville begs that Ernie thinks the same.
"It doesn't hurt me to accept that they are handsome, although they are not my type because they do not go me blonde, but I know that Neville does." Neville groans, tucking her face into his arms.
Of course Draco has a meeting in the Slytherin common room. They all look quite upset that they have to waste an afternoon off being nagged by a teacher for something they didn't do. But for Draco they can go a lot to shit. He doesn't have the time or desire to know who the hell bothers to receive an afternoon of reprimand.
"Cassie? Who is?" Another female voice comes from within until a plump blonde woman comes to the side of whom Draco assumes is Cassie. "In the name of the lion's teeth! You are identical to James. Cassie, what are you doing there? Step aside and let them pass. I am Marlene McKinnon, I studied with James and Lily, this is my wife Dorcas, but as you can see, she is speechless with shock."
Then he observed Potter who was barely shaking his head to the music with a smile, obviously drunk.
"You know, I was in love with you during school, I mean, I liked you a lot." Draco feels a hole dig into his stomach and he suddenly gasps for air. And why is it so hot here?
"I thought you learned."
"Is the hallway so funny?"
"That would be very helpful."
"Oh, don't you know?" Draco swears he sees him smirk.
The gray clouds spread in the sky like smoke, Neville quickens his pace as the rain begins to fall hard. He puts on his coat cap, but it doesn't seem to be enough, so the second thing he tries is to teleport as close to Hogwarts as possible.
"Sirius made up a song ... I don't remember it, it was something like, uh... A poor Jamesy bird boy, take a flight dumb, Jamesy boy. Far above the ridiculous you are, Jamesy boy..."
Harry Potter didn't seem to be that bad, at least so far, and yet Malfoy couldn't say much. They didn't fight during the week after the bar, but that didn't mean they had a lot of conversations in that period, they weren't great friends and he didn't see himself rubbing shoulders with Potter in the near future.
"There's nothing wrong with you liking boys."
"Haven Kingsley asked me if the choir would be closed," Draco snorts when he sees that Neville is still more focused on the music on the radio than what he's saying, he throws a spoon at him and slaps him on the arm. "Are you hear me?"
Draco licks his lips and gulps down his drink to clear his throat. "I'm a potions teacher at Hogwarts. Slytherin head of house."
Draco would have said given the chance.
I have a quick point to clear up so as not to create confusion and this will be explained in more detail later. Here Teddy was born in 1994 and not in '98 as in the cannon. But he is a third year student. And Neville's parents died months after they received the cruciatus.
"What?"
"Did you have plans for today?" Harry asks and his voice shakes like he's shitting himself, then Draco suspects he's nervous, even though he's never seen Harry Potter nervous in his whole fucking life. Not even in fourth year when he took the scare out of his life and thought that giant lizard had made Potter coal.
"Macmillan." He just does the same.
"Yes, but that's the magical community in China, those in Japan have a different way," Rio adds.
A smile settles on his face. "Do me a favor and call me Draco, Potter."
Haven Kingsley is the first to welcome Draco as a new singing teacher. The enthusiastic Gryffindor girl explains the voice type of each of the choir students.
Observes around him the majestic plants in the small greenhouses that rest on the ledges. A click comes from the bottom and Neville turns with a grin ready to meet Hannah.
"You are pretty when you laugh, you should do it more often."
Draco ruffles his hair and the boy nods.
"A toast to the company of oneself." He says still with the glass up before taking the big drink. Draco looks at him somewhat puzzled, but nods with a smile. He collides his glass with Harry and mimics the action before returning the glass to the bar.
Teddy is on his feet, leaning towards the field, his hands are fully gripping the fence and the people in the stands are just as concerned as he is looking at the girl. John is slow to react, but Milton flies with great speed towards Victoire, she is moving on her broom, but another bludger wants to hit her. Renée bites her lip and flies quickly to hit the second bludger.
The days go by quickly and the Quidditch match is already present at the table.
Damn, Neville thought. Fireworks blazing in his mind. As brilliant and scandalous as the ones released by Fred and George Weasley during their fifth year. "Damn, yeah!"
Neville laughs with a shrug. He's clearly drunk. Not enough to take off his clothes and dance in front of Madame Pomfrey, but enough to not be fully conscious.
It's Monday and they go back to Hogwarts. Naturally Neville has to arrive much earlier than the students. Which in itself is a shame because he's very sleepy and a cup of red tea before leaving so early wouldn't have hurt. In fact, he wonders if any of the teachers would notice that he's leaving the station to return for a cup of whatever opens his eyes, however, when he is leaving the place, a hand grabs his shoulder. .
Merlin help him if he's going crazy.
"You?" His voice comes out in an incredulous and very annoying shriek.
"To Helga's ears, hurry up, McGregor." Evelyn Wolff arrives at the classroom door and takes Evan away so fast that she doesn't have time to see Connor's reaction.
"Don't pretend surprise, he's your best friend, you'd already be the first in know."
Draco smiles gratefully at them, glad to have Haven Kingsley as his right hand man and a group of kids willing to take his side.
"As long as he's not Snape's ghost, even Peeves can teach in Hogwarts."
"We sing, we don't model, Kingsley," Zelina murmurs with her arms crossed. Haven rolls her eyes in response.
He doesn't know who he hurt so badly in his other life, but he begs for mercy.
Potter looks at him, green eyes that somehow look both annoyed and scared at the same time. And the gaze on his body only increases Draco's need to fight.
"Malfoy, hi." Ernie greets without the usual regular smile.
"Oh, I know their tastes, I'll accompany you."
Evan punched her on the rib to make her shut up and she squirmed like he'd just tickled her a lot.
"Doesn't it bother you to do this?"
That morning isn't too bad after all, Harry mentions something about how Remus was as much a chocolate lover as Teddy and the boy smiles happily. Then Teddy looks at Victoire with dreamy eyes and he is so much like Sirius that no one would doubt for a second that Edward Lupin was his son.
"Will many boys stay?"
rudeness in his voice.
"Yes, I'm his best man, we've known each other since Hogwarts."
The bathroom lights are dim, a slight purple lighting, just enough to get a view of the place, not to have details, and Draco doesn't know if it's the light, the alcohol, the stupid voice of Zoe Rymar or the incredible solo by Katleen Buteercup, but bridges the gap between him and Harry and... and Draco kisses him.
Of course he didn't expect to find Harry Potter there. Not at that time, not in that place, not talking to him.
"Yes, well-"
"I'm not presentable!" Harry watches several students giggle with cheeks as red as Neville's.
"I'm afraid we all know the François family, so you'd better go home, the party's over," Harry says, pushing the other students towards the exit with a much more relaxed tone. Except for Evan, whom he of course takes to the infirmary to deliver something for the pain. The boys say goodbye to Evan and leave laughing toward their homes. "I think you should write to Principal McGonagall as soon as possible."
Hannah shrugs. "What can I tell you, Nev? There are no secrets among Hufflepuffs." Neville smiles. "But I imagine you've come for some impatiens capensis. Not to talk about how in love you are with my best friend."
"What do I do first?"
"You have to be to give in and Neville appreciates you."
Harry Potter doesn't like him one bit. Harry Potter is a mustard seed in a jar of walnuts, nothing special, just something strange, small and irrelevant, just a tiny fraction of his life. Nothing special happens with Harry, he's just his old childhood enemy.
Draco barely let out a laugh, even to the echo of the hallway. Maybe her own bad mood was due to how bad all his past relationships had gone. Not counting all the boys and girls he kissed drunk in his teens, there were Blaise Zabini, who left him when he discovered that he was actually more in love with Pansy Parkinson than with him, Tracey Davis was his last attempt to prove himself as such. Maybe he wasn't gay and that's why he couldn't find anyone good enough, but it all resulted in the girl's tears because he really didn't seem to love her. And finally, his story with Terry Boot was no better. Just a couple of disastrous dates that ended in "we can't seem to keep up, we should just leave it here, Draco."
In short, Neville was exhausted.
"You shouldn't have said that, Ron." Harry laughs.
Draco nods taking the bottle of paprika potion between his fingers. Ernie says goodbye by conjuring an umbrella with his wand. He turns, ready to follow Neville.
The Neville in his head is singing some kind of Christmas carol that Draco can't quite recognize and then reminds him of how exaggerated he had been about his fight with Potter, to which Draco has to accept, he exaggerated too much.
Blaise once tried to get Draco to touch him under his underwear on one of his escapades in fifth year, during which time he hung out with Pansy and Draco functioned as his sex toy clearance. Blaise cornered him in a hallway around midnight, they were kissing and Blaise was putting his hands on his butt trying to break any hint of distance between the two, Draco was good at keeping up with him. He was kissing him desperately, just as they both liked, the adrenaline rushing through every corner of his body and Blaise's hands touching his skin, going up his back, and he imagined that there was love in his touch; That the Pansy thing had been for sheer appearance in fourth year, he liked to imagine that he was on Blaise's mind when he kissed Pansy. And then Blaise's hands left his back in peace and relaxed on his belly until they began to move down towards the buckle of his pants and Draco pulled away from him, broke the kiss, and the contact, and no they spoke to each other again.
He approaches the man carefully and shakes him to wake him up. Which in itself is easy enough because Potter practically jumps in his place like a frog watching him expectantly.
"I don't know, are you?" A new group laugh comes.
"It seemed like a good opportunity to talk, to make the passes. I saw you reconcile  with Neville." Draco hummed in agreement.
A girl raises her hand from the back, Draco speaks to her. "How many points will this assignment go up?"
"What?"
Then he observed Potter who was barely shaking his head to the music with a smile, obviously drunk.
"It's Teddy Lupin, isn't he adorable? He started this year and he's Hufflepuffs, aren't the Hufflepuffs adorable? He's tenor and we make an amazing duo."
"He has a cold," Ernie says, pulling a jar out of his pants. "Could you give him this from me?"
"Oh well, it's a... it's a gay bar."
"This is my chance, Harry, please." Neville pleads and Draco tries his best to sharpen his ears to find out what those idiots are talking about.
Draco shrugs, putting the coffee cup on the table. Takes a napkin and wipe the corner of his lips. "Let's say I need a better salary."
It is not an extremely spacious space, it is just a room with a bed and an armchair that immediately opens onto a small kitchen and right next to it, there is the bathroom. It is not big and it is clear that he could have paid better, but he was at a good price and the brick wall captivated him as soon as he saw it. If I lit the fireplace it was almost mesmerizing, and had natural light coming in through the windows that hit the ceiling. It wasn't much and it wasn't even close to matching the room he grew up in at Malfoy Manor, but it was his.
"What do you say, Miss Wolff?" Draco asks, standing up so fast that for a moment he gets dizzy. Connor shrinks in place.
After two classes with the Ravenclaw fifth-year group, Draco was finally able to relax in his office chair.
There's an interesting glow so he brings his hands up to the face of the man in front of him and carefully removes his glasses.
Sometimes Neville wondered if Teddy could remember anything about his parents, but the boy was only two at the time and it was almost impossible. Two years with Sirius and four with Remus, it all seemed like a bad joke from the universe. Look at the sweetest child in the world and take away both of his parents. Take the loneliest man, give him a second of love and take his life away.
The bell on the bar door echoes in his eardrums, the alcohol making him more sensitive and much less tolerant with this dying noise.
"Do you think they know more about my parents?" Harry's voice is overflowing with magic, and Draco doesn't know how that's possible, but he's there, with stars in his eyes and magic between his fingers. Ron smiles at him, a smile like the one they gave themselves in their first year after the selection ceremony.
"A ritual, like Christmas, but ... uh, it's more of a wizarding family tradition."
"After you told me about your masturbation routine? No, thanks." Neville laughs, like the big jerk that he is, laughs and Draco snorts.
"Know what, Potter?"
"Why doesn't he have Sirius's last name?" The two decided to start with the tree and in the end they opted for white spheres.
Draco can see Quidditch's practices from his window. For the surprise of him, Weasley becomes popular with students who don't stop talking about him even during his class. "Look at Professor Weasley, he's great, right?" a boy sitting in the background says. "Spectacular!" Answer Hanako Fujioka with a smile, the girl always has an album on the best players of the Japanese League and the African, who are in Association. "He's so handsome, what would I give to touch his eyelashes..." A pair of girls sigh and several boys frowning with annoyance.
"Not as much as you from Paul, Padfoot."
"Oh, that's little. You couldn't have that pair separate, they used to send me to visit Tonks with Teddy to have the house alone."
Harry is about to speak when Draco interrupts him saying that they are not friends at all. The woman only says that friends or not, if it hadn't been for him, no one would have found him until the next morning.
"Okay, because they're both my friends, and I'm definitely not" opening and closing quotation marks " 'taking a favourite' or whatever."
"What was the visit for?" Ernie looks down and an uncomfortable smile spreads across his face. He drapes his right arm behind the back of his neck in what Neville thinks is a nervous tic that reminded him of the younger Ernie who was always accompanying Hannah.
Draco is folding his arms trying not to touch anything around him, turning to him with a frown than before. "I'm not going to wait to find out."
Harry smiles at him.
"Of course I do, Evan, don't even ask."
Michael and Jeremy are escorted by Potter to their classes and Draco asks Evelyn Wolff to be very aware of his sister Rio and her friend Noelle. Suddenly Evelyn who's always accompanied by Evan is escort with Connor and Teddy for the both girls to go everywhere.
"Yes." He just says. Short words always lead to fewer questions, fewer questions end in silences, generally uncomfortable, but silences after all.
"Uh, y-yes of course don't worry." Neville says. And Draco thinks at the time that if MacMillan hasn't realized how much Longbottom likes him, it's because he's just an idiot.
"I'll be a professor," he says. Look up, again they have eye contact. "I have Defense Against the Dark Arts class."
"Do you think Victoire loves me?"
Toxic Poison started with The end of the work and that was the outlet for Draco, he needed air.
Of course that idiot was going to send Harry Potter.
Draco laughed. "How are the preparations for the next game going?" Neville shifted uncomfortably in his chair.
"What about you, Malfoy?"
"I can't," he laments, "I have a two-hour class with Gryffindor."
After Christmas dinner, Draco decides it's time to start the paperwork that McGonagall commissioned him before the end of the holidays, so he decides to start barely opening his presents the next morning. She received a couple of new scrolls, courtesy of being a regular at La Casa del Papel y otros, also a couple of socks from Pansy, a box of caramelized fruits, and a book on scent potions wrapped in a thong, as part of a traditional joke with Neville. The usual letters from his students along with some sweets he would first have to examine and to his bewilderment, a packet of tea from Mr. and Mrs. Peevtney that was not signed by anyone.
"Shit!" Neville yells. He backs up and nearly falls to the ground, then shakes his head in denial. Dumb dumb dumb. "Ernie, hi, I- yeah, like I do all the time. I don't like- it's not something I do during work, or whatever, it's more of a uhm... It's for the... uh, stress?"
"Oh, no. Thanks."
"And I... wanted to apologize for everything I said the other day in the greenhouse, and for forcing you to choose between Potter and me and for... for being an idiot, in short."
Would he have leaned into Quidditch? The Chudley Canons were always at the table in any discussion on the subject, there were even rumors about Potter being recruited to play the Caerphilly Catapults as a seeker, but turning them down for an Auror position in the ministry.
"For his son, I know they had one. We would have loved to meet him, but... going back there and- we lost many friends... family and- going back is painful, but we would have loved to meet him, they would both have been amazing parents."
"I'm sorry, I think- I need to use the bathroom, if that's okay with you?" Harry has naturally sleepy eyes, despite having big eyes, they always look tired, probably due to the shape of his eyelashes.
"Draco!" In Merlin's honor, you woke up! Draco responds with a wince at the painful noise and Neville puts his hands over his own mouth as an act of mending his mistake. Or alternatively avoid it next time.
He didn't have a good Christmas dance. He attended with Pansy Parkinson and everything would have been fine until the time when Blaise took him to a secluded place where he kissed him, managing to confuse many things in him. The following weeks he didn't speak to Draco and if he fell asleep in the bedroom, he didn't notice. Then in fifth year, Blaise asked him for an opportunity to clarify his feelings (of course it was only going to be his test, of course he didn't know it at the time, and in a way Blaise was his test too). He took advantage of his position as prefect to sneak out with him, but two months later he simply left with Pansy claiming he wasn't as interested in boys as he thought. No, let's just say he didn't treasure dancing very well.
"You're doing a great drama, Draco," he murmurs with a combination of patience and weariness. This is not leading to anything good. "You should be objective, you are an adult. He'll not cheat because it is not something he likes to do."
"Man, I sucked for that..." Seamus mutters with a pout. Harry laughs happily and Dean kisses him on the cheek.
Connor and Edward struggled at their homework.
"Gilbert is hitting Jeremy and Michael, Jerome François is with him. They are on the stairs to the second floor."
"I can not stand up, I think," I think I was frozen my ass.
Harry appears in his long Quidditch robe and the trunk with each of the magic balls to play with. He says a few words to the students, the basic rules of the game, Draco guesses, and then sends them to heaven, they all soar on their brooms as Harry Potter takes the whistle between his fingers and then the game begins.
"Heard the Hufflepuffs are having a party tonight." The three men's gazes shifted to Headmistress McGonagall who was watching them through her half-moon glasses.
And a part of him was glad to know him dead and underground.
Harry watches him dubiously for a couple of seconds before nodding and adjusting his glasses. "Yes of course. Why not?"
Draco picks up the fire whiskey and denies. "Thank you, I hope you found everything you were looking for."
Harry pauses and looks at him in a strange way. As if he were looking at something big, as if he was something good to see.
"Uh, I guess you have business to discuss," Ernie says very awkward and a little... upset?
"Of course not, Director."
"I was... was passing by and I thought that," Harry stumbles on his words, then shakes his head and clears his throat putting his fist in front of his lips. "I wanted to know if everything was okay- If you... you were fine, actually."
"Of course not. I'll teach singing without the slightest knowledge of the subject, Longbottom." He says sarcastically. "Of course I can sing."
Draco sees himself in one of his students when he tells him that he's gay.
Harry apologizes quietly and remains silent for a while looking at the infirmary as if being there all the time during his stay at Hogwarts wouldn't have allowed him to know the place by heart.
An owl came through the window, it was the fourth of the day that he was addressing Ron Weasley, but this time, his eyes lit up, Draco guessed it was a letter from Granger.
He continues in his duties to keep everything in order with the crops. Sometimes he stops to write down advances that he notices on the leaves of some, or if his experimental crow cane fertilizer has worked well enough.
So it's Monday, and it's a day after New Years, and well the old say, "New year, new loves," and maybe it's time for him to give up on Ernie and time for him to give up on everything, because he'll never find love, it doesn't matter if Draco says he's being melodramatic, because it's true. Neville wasn't born to find love, that was never a destiny for him.
Also in the next chapter the waters between Harry and Draco will begin to calm down.
"Pay attention at every step, today I'll do enough potion for everyone, but next time everyone will take care of creating their own dragon mucus, okay?" A sonorous assent is heard and Draco sees Harry take nods with the other students, without realizing a slight smile is drawn on his lips.
"Professor Longbottom! Can Connor Tremlett come to our table?” Evan approaches the pair of teachers with a pair of puppy dog eyes.
"Draco Malfoy."
Draco stops looking at the cauldron. He arches his eyebrows and crosses his arms. Probably annoying? The devil is wearing it. Neville could have told him that Harry Potter would come to teach at Hogwarts, they were in contact all the holidays, there is no excuse that is worth not having told him.
Connor begins to hyperventilate looking more annoyed, as if the dementors are going to come in at any moment to take him to Azkaban. Like he'd killed someone and then left his body in the bathroom with Moaning Myrtle.
"I understand, I also have fame, but they don't stop me for autographs or photos, you saw it a while ago." Draco winks at him mockingly. Harry looks away watching the round of beers float down to his table. The man quickly grabs one in his hands.
Being this drunk made him feel light, like all his problems didn't exist. The pressure of work, the problems with his family, his own homosexuality, the choir, Connor, none of that was invading his mind. The only fixed idea was the desire to feel the wind on his face
The best thing Neville could do to calm his nerves after the request was sent to Hermione's owl first thing that morning was dance, obviously.
"I think not, woups."
"Marlene and Dorcas wrote!" Harry's gaze, which had previously been focused on a book on Lycanthropy in the Magical Laws of America, was now fixed on Ronald.
"Is there ferrets in the forest?" Draco question intrigued, a smile replaces Harry's serious frown and Draco gets back in his chair. "Ha. Ha, so funny, Potter."
"You don't have the authority to do that!"
Jerome is about to put a curse on Michael when Draco uses an expelliarmus to disarm them both. Connor luckily acts fast and takes care of taking the boys down with care. They are two students, a third year Ravenclaw and a fourth year Slytherin teasing two fifth year Gryffindors.
The next morning nothing was clear in his mind, but if he was sure of one thing, it was that this wasn't his room.
The color fades from his face and his generally large eyes become much larger. He denies.
"From the... uhm, the- the kiss I gave you." Draco clears his throat avoiding Harry's gaze at all times. Harry straightens up in his place, clearing his throat under a loud cough because he accidentally swallowed a piece of cookie. "I wanted to apologize for having behaved that way. And I know it was not the first time. So I'm sorry that you had to put up with me like that twice."
"Harry, what is it?"
"I think they like it." Neville punches Harry who continues to laugh. "Don't get grumpy, we're all excited for Teddy's thirteenth birthday."
"No? Try me."
Harry Potter had always struck him as one of those who sought fame and recognition, but apparently, they were all ideas of Draco himself.
"Good evening, Director McGonagall."
"Not yet, Lord, but we will and we will shine with the solo that I will do." Haven put her hands spread across her chest. "Teddy wrote a passionate love song for me, details about his muse it's in secret, of course."
"Ferrets, I suppose, I saw them enter the forest."
"I don't see why that should matter to you," he replies. He has a raised eyebrow and his best face doesn't give a shit.
"You said that- well, I figured I had to keep it formal with you."
"I understand," he laughs with a nod. "Being unaccompanied doesn't mean being alone. I agree." Harry lifts the goblet already served to him and takes a drink. Draco stares at Potter's Adam's apple mesmerized by the movement.
Neville nods, twisting his lips. "I try to touch myself and the first thing that comes to mind is Ernie, but I immediately feel guilty because I shouldn't think about him, Draco, that's an invasion... it almost feels like- like- Shit! What do you do?"
Harry laughs again. Draco doesn't believe it is an effect of alcohol because it is very early and Harry Potter has good resistance to alcohol. But it's the first time he's seen him laughing like that with him, despite truces in recent years.
"Together?" Harry asks, still looking sleepy enough to be aware of space-time.
"How long have you known about this?"
"Who would say you were an old-fashioned old man, Ron?" Harry jokes kicking his knee weakly, Ron throws him a cushion that throws his glasses at him in response.
He has had too much of this situation.
"Of course. Can you lean here while I clean up?" Potter points to the sink, Draco rolling his eyes and pulling away from Harry's grasp. "I think you're not very good at drinking... that's unexpected. The Weasleys have good resistance to alcohol, I thought it was a pureblood thing-"
Ron shrugs, carries a large trunk beside him, a new one. "Madame Hooch called me, she needed a substitute. I guess she got Weasley wrong, right?"
Connor denies it. "I don't know how to sing".
"Oh no, they are always there, they are the owners, I have seen them on my outings with Rolf and Atticus." Draco and Harry looked at Neville right away. Atticus Bulstrod was a magician from New York who had settled in Sweden. He made regular trips to Hogsmeade and was the announcer for WWN, everyone was crazy about him, with his shiny curly hair and gray eyes. "We don't stop to talk much. We are not especially close."
"As far as I remember, didn't they both have a mania for Viktor Krum?" They both laugh, but the one doing it the most is Harry.
Of course, after noticing that this was not a temporary thing, Neville went to the infirmary to see Madam Pomfrey, however, right at that moment she was out shopping for supplies for healing potions. What luck he came to touch, and just when Draco was mad at him.
"Fucking tran-
Harry takes a seat next to him and laughs, throwing his head down. It's a weird way to him, Draco can tell because he's seen him laugh many, many times.
January, 2007
"I just wanted to tell you that I won't say anything." He says, his jaw tightening. "Thanks for the potion."
The three of them nod as they watched MacMillan leave.
"Yes, I know what I'm doing." Draco snorts. Renée, hasn't John Davies ever asked you out?
The gleam in Teddy's eyes was indescribable, especially since discussions to improve conditions for werewolves were under discussion.
"Hello." He says hello, fixing his clothes. He's not wearing his tunic and his hair looks rather like a bird's nest, much worse than when they were children and had a fight during a Quidditch match. "You want to eat? Ernie made hangover chicken soup. I'm not really sure that works, but you must be hungry I guess I don't know. Or we can buy something, the bar is not open yet, they have a blood-
Draco wanted to scream and pluck his teeth to wipe the stupid grin off his face. If it bothered him? What an idiot was asking! Of course it didn't bother him. He was furious.
If he plans to tell everyone, if he decides that if being an ex-Death Eater isn't enough to destroy his life, being a fag probably would. Look at stupid Draco Malfoy, not only is he a fucking ex Death Eater, he also likes other men to touch his dick, how does that sound?
"Sure," he says with a smile.
"You look funny with that face."
That Tuesday he meets again with the students of the choir and is happy to receive two girls in the choir. Noelle Charming and Rio Wolff, both were in Draco's eye, especially since Gilbert and Jerome considered teasing them a good idea. Fortunately, though, Jerome was no longer a problem.
"Harry! Victoire gave me this chocolate frog, what does it mean?" Teddy Lupin opens the door and comes to Potter hopping back and forth with red cheeks and a slight mark of lip gloss on his cheeks.
Neville sighs. Draco is taking this too far again.
The girl disappears and the wooden base closes completely around both of them.
"Oh no, nothing. I was informed that my sister was hospitalized in a Muggle hospital in Brazil and I'll have to retire for a while. I wanted to say goodbye and wish you both happy holidays." Neville runs up to the woman and embraces her in a tight hug that is reciprocated with the teacher's bright smile, however, they can both notice the concern in her gaze and Draco also comes over to wish her well in the near future and her sister's speedy recovery.
"It's a pleasure, thank you for having us."
There's nothing Neville enjoys more than tending his garden and spending the day with his plants, maybe except music.
"I'm retiring, I'll have to make a lot of hangover potion, apparently." Draco put his napkin on the table before leaving.
"Malfoy, hi." Ernie greets without the usual regular smile.
"Then I'm glad for the changes to the werewolf law code."
In his first year, he had to share an office with Neville. At first as in everything, the matter bothered him excessively, but one thing led to the other and both turned out to be quite good, so being part of the younger teachers of the school was no longer a big problem. In their second year they were given different and separate offices. They were small and did not have the best view, but it was nothing a couple of spells couldn't fix. They were also given the title of heads of house. Of course Draco took Slytherin under his wing. Neville for his part was more interested in having Hufflepuff.
Draco squirms and Harry grabs him, he doesn't know if he can stop him because he's stronger or because he's more sober. "You kissed me. You're not in your five senses, let's just go back to the table, I'll go get Ernie and Neville."
Draco shrugs, starting to play with his feet. That's something he does whenever he's nervous. "I'm not sure I thought of that. The first years of my life were just manners classes, private tutoring, parties with my father's friends, the kind of shit they make you do when your family is 'pure blood' And then it was all about surpassing Harry Potter in absolutely everything he did... until the war came and when I opened my eyes, I was already in front of... who-should-not-be-named, hoping that him not kill me." Draco takes a breath when he feels his voice cracking. "I always thought that he would inherit my father's fortune and that he would not have to do anything else. I considered making the Quidditch team, but, you know, my father had other ideas in mind for me."
Potter finally leaves his classroom and his new group of students begins to enter to take their places. Draco calms down trying to suppress the urge to get out and jump on Potter's scoundrel and crush him. However, Draco takes a deep breath and does his best for a calm smile.
Draco felt foolish at the time. He was simply wearing a white shirt, black pants, and his Slytherin robe. Potter was the same case.
Draco wrinkled his nose, a grease stain smeared on one of the scrolls Neville was grading.
DRACO
"Well, it was a pleasure to see you gentlemen, but our band today is yet to arrive and we have things to fix. I'll bring you a bottle of marc, the house invites."
Because Neville is right, new years, new beginnings. And it's not that Draco is a big believer in the New Year's resolutions that are burned under the yule tree, much less the bullshit Neville says when he's being the drama king, but he's determined to get better and people usually change their appearance when they try to put all the shit they did behind them, so Draco does the same.
With the new occupation that was the choir his free hours were reduced considerably so Neville returned to spend all his time with Potter. He was taking his new best friend.
"I hate going back to my room," he says. "I never thought I would say this, but it was better to share a room with yourself and others."
"How wonderful! What about you, darling?"
Draco was adding the latest ingredients to the calming potion for Neville. He rummages in his closet for the oleander leaves he needs to finish, but he can't find them anywhere. He curses internally because it was obviously a bad idea to start preparing without counting all the ingredients ready and at hand. He keeps looking in the closet until he sees them in a box on top. He takes his wand to bring them with him.
A letter arrives two days later, it is a letter from his mother with the seal of the Black family, signed only by Narcissa, not even her father's last name, only Narcissa. The owl, however, is from the Malfoy family, but Draco doesn't open the letter, as soon as it arrives he puts it in a drawer and forgets it there when he puts his old summer clothes. Months later, he would regret that event, but by then, he was too foolish to know.
"None of your business, McGregor, I recommend that you meddle in your own business."
Time passes, John Davies continues distracted trying to talk to Renée while she ignores him and takes care not to lose sight of Wolfgang on the field. Suddenly there are ninety Gryffindor points and Hufflepuff barely gets eighty.
"No!" Neville says as Draco says "Yes." MacMillan watches them bewildered. "My friend Draco was leaving, right, Draco?"
Point.
"I didn't have time to go out and look for a tree." He jokes leaving a cup of hot chocolate in front of Draco. "I don't have coffee, I hope it doesn't bother you."
"Ugh, okay, I guess."
"He's busy with the whole ministry and werewolves business."
"You're going to kill me, one of these days. You're really are going to kill me."
Neville is going home for the holidays and Draco is officially alone. Which sucks because he also has to take care of decorating the big dining room for the dates, and although Hagrid has been kind enough to leave the pine in place, Draco has no idea how to get started on the whole hanging ball and candle business.
"Why?" Neville asks with feigned innocence before seeing Draco stand up ready to go.
He may notice a blush on him when the glasses are no longer there, and neither both look away.
The idea crosses his mind at all times, the words he can say, the excuses, the apologies. But what do you say to someone after you kiss them? And not only that, you kissed him while you were so drunk that you didn't remember anything the next morning, and even though he must have killed you, he was kind enough to heat you soup and escort you to your room. Guilt gnaws at him inside and he's about to apologize when Jerome lunges at Evan and hits him non-stop. Potter gets to his feet as fast as he can and pulls them apart taking Jerome by the shoulders, while the boy growls in anger.
"My face isn't funny, asshole,"
"Oh don't pretend you don't know, weren't all those Gryffindor girls pining for you when you got sick? Mr. Longbottom, can I put ointment on your neck?" Neville blushes and puts both hands to his ears as he hums to cover up Draco's bad imitation of teenage voices.
Silence settles between the two again, Harry is playing with the napkin holder and Draco is looking around too self-consciously. There's a too pompous boy in the center of the court. He's wearing a horrible coat that looks like artificial animal fur and several boys are coming up to him to dance with him. Malfoy looks away quickly when a boy at the table across from him watches him. He's a handsome, red-haired guy with his hair tied up in a bun and a half-buttoned ministry shirt that reveals some tattoos.
Draco sighed as Harry did and after pouring himself more whiskey he raised his glass for another drink that burned his throat to a lesser extent than the previous drink.
"You don't know, but you probably saved lives by kicking Jerome out," Rio told him after chorus rehearsal when Noelle was away, talking to Evelyn Wolff and Zelina Sylvester.
"You are correct, Professor, and I want to think that you have no problem with my sentence, am I wrong?"
"You don't even know how to keep the tones high!"
"It's a shame." He manages to say Harry, setting the glass aside and turning his entire body towards him, reaching out to take his shoulder between his fingers and give a gentle squeeze on it.
"You passed out, buddy," Neville whispers, his face troubled.
Evan grabs Connor's sleeve and walks alongside him. The Gryffindor prefect appears and makes everyone go to their respective classes.
He has a drink in hand and Draco internally scoffs that of course Neville Longbottom was going to drink uncontrollably.
Harry Potter was right, again.
"You see it? If the Gryffindor seeker is interested in Renée, he will let her go so she can protect Wolfgang from the bludger."
The atmosphere, on the other hand, felt tense, in a way very different from any that has been between them. Even very different from the one they had during the war. And it all felt overwhelming, almost as if his lungs were shrinking and his stomach was creeping up his throat to be thrown up into a very tight knot.
"I forgive you. Neville mutters. And I also want to apologize for not trying to fix things."
And a feeling of relief filled his chest.
"Harry sent an application to the Ministry and I'm waiting for it to be approved."
Neville falls back on the bed with a plaintive wail, like a wounded dog.
"I'll go with you."
"Only at Christmas? You, Harry Potter?" The young man twists his lips with a shrug. "I didn't expect that at all, I mean, what about Weasley?"
Draco frowns and spins around with a speed he wasn't aware of possessing.
Harry laughs. "Looks like he couldn't resist Remus's charms."
"Well, it's now that you're here." Harry laughs. Why the hell is he laughing? "Now what do you want, Potter?" Draco carves his face and turns as if it hurt to do so. And it could be true.
"Oh ... do you have plans with someone?" Harry's tone sounds like what would be defined as disappointment. Or curiosity, in either case.
The room feels freezing. He fidgets between the covers looking for a warm place between the covers, but the empty space next to him is much colder and his skin instantly bristles sending a wave of chills throughout his body. He turns back to his previous position cursing under his breath. He hadn't expected winter to take over the ideal fall weather this year.
These scenes remind Draco of the horrible school days during the war when everyone walked in groups to avoid being enchanted by some Slytherin who had crossed over to the dark lord. All the half-blood walked near a teacher, even. And suddenly Draco realizes that the war for people like him never ends.
Neville looks at him. Eyebrows raised up and mouth slightly open quite surprised. He immediately denies as if he is taking something off and stands up. "You?" He points at him with a smile. "Draco Malfoy as choirmaster? That would surprise me to see. And let me tell you that, Hagrid showed me Ashwinders eggs, I just thought it would be impossible for anything else to leave me speechless." Draco crosses his arms in annoyance.
Harry goes two steps forward, he tries to back two more. His back hits the wall.
Fresia takes a deep breath and denies with calm and a severe frown of outrage, but Jude Singh nods and stands in front of her teammates even though Milton and Jerome pull her to stop her. "Fresia said she would guarantee us the match," she says. "Kyle was so bad in practice that we all thought a little help would be good, just enough for the game. Professor Malfoy was so convinced that Professor Potter would cheat that we believed we could also cheat when Fresia offered it. I'm so sorry."
In the next chapter the action will begin, I promise, I'm just clearing the way so it won't be so fast. I can tell there will be a kiss, that's all.
"What do you want?" He asks with a sore throat. Draco plays with his hands and bites the inside of his cheek.
And oh hell, being an adult meant not being shit, especially with one of the few adults who didn't shirk like he could bring the unnamed to life.
Harry has to explain the situation to McGonagall, things are enough to make Draco get a problem with his breathing.
Harry smiles looking at the photographs in his hands. "He's identical to Remus, but when he smiles and does his thing, he's more like Sirius ... although Tonks inherited all the energy from him."
When he arrives at the classroom he finds it empty, however, the students begin to arrive little by little in groups and end up separating by houses. Hufflepuff is on one side while Ravenclaw takes the other end, they're a third year and do not look at each other.
The woman nods without smiling. Teddy Lupin turns on a large microphone that makes a deafening noise at first, but immediately apologizes and catches everyone's attention by announcing the start of the match. Draco scrambles into place.
"Just spit it out, Potter," he says, angrier than he expected. Red cheeks and a tingle up his spine making every spot on his body bristle. "You can't even look at me now, can you?"
"Oh... Malfoy! What, God, who would say... uh-"
"I know."
"Not." Draco grips his lip between his teeth, twisting his face into a grimace. Fantastic! Announcing to Harry Potter that he's more alone than Trelawney's madwoman because yes, he is abandoned and sad, and very, very drunk.
CW: Homophobic language and internalized homophobia. If this doesn't do you any good, please take a break. Or I can alert you as soon as the scene gets too hard, I'll put a small notice in capital letters and italics.
Teddy blushes a lot more as he looks at the cup of tea that Draco sets in front of him. "I like her a lot, and Evan says that the same and I like her, but I don't know how to understand the girls because Gilbert says they are complicated, and more if they already met your parents, and well... Harry teaches her and helps her with Quidditch."
"I was telling Dean that I accompanied Neville on his date, but it's more of a pretext to come see you. How have you been?"
"I guess I tried to-
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry pats him on the back standing next to him and Neville groans. "Don't even mention it, give me your robe."
"Thanks for joining me, Ernie, see you." Neville speaks quickly before heading down a hallway to climb the stairs to his room.
Draco wants to turn around to get that other boy, but they couldn't act until something happened according to the rules imposed by the ministry.
Draco nods trying to stand up, but as soon as he comes out from under the covers he realizes that he's not wearing pants. His face soon turned red when he quickly looked up at Potter and he barely looked away as flushed as he was.
Harry leaves it on one of the sinks and makes sure to hold it under his armpits so he can wipe his pants off, and from Harry's face, Draco guesses he looks pathetic.
Pomfrey frowns at him. "Don't use that tone on me."
"Never? Like never before?" Draco rolls his eyes before shaking his head. "But you have had sex, right? Don't you do anything when someone makes you horny?"
Something in the environment felt strange, it was not a matter of the season or the effect of alcohol on his body taking over his mind. There was something surrounding them, something like magic that rose through his body when he cast a spell. Something just like when he rebelled against the dark lord.
"And my dad never gave up? It seems my mom didn't... like him."
"I could use some fresh air, now that you mention it, friend Neville. Your garden has a lot of that, doesn't it?"
"Oh." Haven smiles, biting her lip. "Well, I felt guilty for giving you all the burden of talking to Miss Miner - I mean, the principal, of course. So this morning it occurred to me to take charge on my own, so I just told you that you entered us in the contest. You're welcome."
"I can not stand up," he murmurs.
Harry is shocked and chokes on his saliva, pathetic as he's, Draco regrets feeling so vulnerable right now because making people uncomfortable with these jokes is one of his favorite things. Maybe he only worked with people he didn't like one bit.
"Look how crazy things get! A Potter and a Malfoy living in the same room without killing each other! That does surprise me, it really does surprise me." Marlene pushes them into the house and makes them sit. "Are you friends with Ron?"
"I suppose everyone is here." He glances at the late-arriving Ravenclaw and notices his face turning red. "I thought that the presentations would not be necessary, but if I am honest I do not remember more than half of the students."
What an idiot you had to be, Longbottom, Draco thought.
Harry shrugs with a smile. "Can you remove it?"
His grandmother was never very expressive about anything, the less decent words that came out of her mouth, the better it seemed for her and for anyone. And Neville didn't have much time in the presence of Remus and Sirius to find out more than those old conversations at one of the Order of the Phoenix meetings during Christmas '96. They were such short and generic conversations that there wasn't much to get out of them.
"Are they finished?" He asks, wiping a small trickle of drool that runs down his cheek.
"Yes, well, was it a good start?"
The holidays are ending too quickly for Neville's liking, who still hadn't even digested the turkey for his return to school.
"It's me?"
There's a mistletoe above them, right in the middle where their knees can touch if they are stretched enough, but Harry decides he doesn't want to have just the contact of the knees.
"It's not written in any book that I cannot use the infatuation of my students to my advantage in the field." Draco shrugs and Neville curls his lips in agreement.
Evan stands up carrying his briefcase in his hands. Draco looks at him curious, it's a briefcase decorated with figures that move all over the surface, he has photos glued to the back, Muggle photos that don't move and are quite blurred, he also has small dolls hanging from the strap, and it's probably the briefcase most colorful he had ever seen.
"And you haven't decorated anything?" He asks surprised, almost outraged. Harry forgot how important Christmas is to pureblood magicians.
Draco looks impatiently at the cauldron, then at the window and back at the cauldron. He doesn't want to be around Potter and he needs that rock to climb so he can give it to him and the guy to go.
"Isn't that cheating?"
"It's about the planning the Quidditch match," he says. Draco obviously, what else would Harry Potter be interested in? "The next game is Slytherin vs. Gryffindor."
"Are you sure? Because I know the boys are outside playing in the snow."
They played lined up like a barricade, the only ones who could separate were the couple formed by Wolfgang and Renée.
"I have to wait until this floats and it's ready," Draco explains, wiping his hands. Harry comes fully into the room with his hands in his pants pockets and advances the entire length until he's also in front of the desk.
"Connor, if you've already come to see me and your integrity is under attack, you have to tell me so I can sanction him."
The waters had been calm between them since the last time, the one in which Draco stopped playing the puberty boy who doesn't know how to control his emotions, but that didn't mean that they now trust each other, not like that, at least.
The entire Gryffindor team comes down to congratulate Penny, Darrell carrying her in his arms celebrating. The Hufflepuffs also get down to the ground and come over to shake hands with the opposing team. Evan McGregor and Connor Tremlett climb the fence alongside Teddy, who greets them with a smile and slaps Connor on the shoulder when he sees him in Hufflepuff colors.
"It's possible, you can go see them this weekend, before they go back to Puerto Rico."
"Hey, idiot, you left your damn boxers in my room." Draco stomps into the orchard. He stops when he sees Ernie next to Neville, and then a smile replaces the scowl on his pale traitorous face. "... MacMillan."
The first weeks are over and Draco doesn't meet Harry for the rest of the days. Neville mentions something about the Gryffindor Quidditch team and that he's the head of the house, but it doesn't matter. He prefers to focus on assessing who his best students will be (or technically who he has the most faith in). He has Evan McGregor, a rather distracted and cheerful Hufflepuff, not a novelty in his house and Eleanor Aknes, from the same house. Connor Tremlett and Alek Millicent from Ravenclaw are also a good bet, there are six outstanding Slytherins, it doesn't surprise him and he still can't find a Gryffindor. Maybe in it's time.
Draco's classroom bell rings, ending class. All the students collect their books and put the scrolls with the homework from the last class on the table. He smiles at Connor when the boy leaves a scroll at least a foot long. And he shakes his head when Evan walks over, leaving one barely four inches away.
"Yeah right."
"Are you staying somewhere?" He questions starting to take out his wallet to pay for the Whiskey and Draco thinks it's all at night.
"Yeah, he was! We met once for Mione's birthday, yes, I remember. Remus baked the most horrible cake I've ever seen, and look at Fred and George always blowing up their cakes, but he was good, I admit it. And you know, Hermione likes details,
Everyone remains silent as Pomfrey talks about Draco's condition and how he won't be out until after a few days of reviewing especially his meals. Which doesn't stop Draco to protest, although he's completely ignored by Pomfrey.
"Teddy has Victoire to hand him homework! That is not fair." The bright red color lights up Edward's face and hair. The boy fixes his gaze on his friend in annoyance and shame. So she was the girl he was writing that song about.
Valentine's Day comes fast, faster than Draco would have wished, in fact. Not that he was a grump of the season especially. But he wasn't a fan of the whole scene Neville was setting up with his brilliant idea of allowing students to send each other heart-shaped lollipops, either. "It's to have funds Draco, funds, don't you want to have school trips like Merlin wants?" No, Neville, not really. But Valentine's Day was just one of his excuses for receiving candy from his students, Draco had already come to know that that idiot loved the attention and all the turns of "Oh, Professor Longbottom is very handsome and always smells like summer Wind." He was a jerk and smelled like owl shit, Draco thinked when he heard the girls talk about Neville like he was one of those Olympian gods.
The man nods hanging his backpack over his shoulders and thanks him for the millionth time for accompanying him, and he says that it is not a problem, for the millionth time, but swears that if Potter thanks him one more time he is going to kick him.
"Oh, yeah, right, me too. Sure. Harry, see you at Hogwarts, okay? Take care of Draco for me, see ya." Draco hears the door closing and he can almost imagine Potter's shocked face.
"Guys, I have to go." A third voice makes an appearance, Draco hears Neville squirming instead of just hearing Ernie's voice. He's been through so many times that it's more of a predetermined state in his memories of Longbottom.
"What? What distracted you?" He asks himself with murming while he shakes his head, but Potter's blushing does not go unnoticed.
A little time outside wouldn't hurt, but he didn't want to leave everything to Harry Potter either.
"You didn't tell me who else is teaching." Ron turns to him offering him a slice of the sandwich he was eating. Neville accepts and takes it between his fingers thanking him with a quick gesture.
"We would have invited you, Harry, but it was secret. Seamus's mother wouldn't allow it and he said 'hell, let's go to one of those Muggle places' and we went to Holland."
she always tells me. And then Sirius came out with one of those guitars like
"They started!" Gilbert complains, pointing at the couple. "Those fags were kissing in front of me."
During the trip back to Hogwarts, everyone was talking about the recent expulsion of Jerome François. He quickly became the gossip of the trip and theories abounded everywhere. Some even claimed that he had burned down the Hufflepuff bedroom. Neville couldn't tell as a teacher, but he was glad he didn't have to deal with Jerome ever again (or at least not at school). Especially if he had planned to set Hufflepuff's bedroom on fire.
Harry sat next to him sliding his body down the brick wall. The moon shining at its highest point allowed for proper illumination.
He's going up to the common room to celebrate with the biggest smile he can put on until McGonagall appears at the edge of the stairs annoyed with Potter behind her and calls out to him. A knot is made in his stomach, and he doesn't know if it's fear or anger because he knew this was going to happen.
"All right." Draco gets up from the bench where he had resigned himself to sitting. He snatches up his things and leaves the greenhouse.
They loved him?
October, 2006.
Harry laughs, throwing his head down in denial. He looks at him for short moments before deciding he couldn't do that.
"Everyone go up to your rooms, I don't want to know more about your stupid kiddiness for today. And for those of you who have been behaving, understand that none of this will affect your performance or grades, especially now that EXTASIS are on the way."
They practice indecent hours and honestly, he doesn't see an improvement. Nothing extraordinary outside of a team that plays very well, but needs more than that. Slytherin needed more than that if they wanted to win the house cup. Probably now that Dumbledore was dead ten feet deep, there would be no one to remove the stitches from under his shoes to give the stupid goblet to Gryffindor. Over and over again And Draco can bet his best clothes that more than one is happy about it.
"Hey, idiot, you left your damn boxers in my room." Draco stomps into the orchard. He stops when he sees Ernie next to Neville, and then a smile replaces the scowl on his pale traitorous face. "... MacMillan."
"I had my first class, Potter, the day hasn't even started."
"And I already signed us up." Draco's gaze rivets hard on Haven's body. She smiles slightly undeterred. She has large teeth and full lips, which makes her indifferent smile stand out a lot.
When they say goodbye to the two women, the sun is already beginning to hide behind the mountains as if it were a kind of ritual that always arrived without fail. Harry turns to him asking if he's ready to go and Draco nods so they show up in Hogsmeade in the same alley from that morning, right behind Hog's Head.
"Don't worry, I won't ask you to tell me about your life reduced to what you like and what you don't because I certainly don't care if you think Macbeth's Witches is the best RMI band." There's a general laugh. Draco mentally pats himself on the shoulder. "However, I need you to mix with each other. One Ravenclaw and one Hufflepuff in each row."
"And what have you done?" Dean asks taking a seat at the table, Draco assumes he's being brought into the conversation.
"I'm listening!"
"I have to go."
He gets to the second floor as fast as he can, Jerome has Michael and Jeremy pinned in the air while some students made noise, Gilbert was striking purple sparks coming from his wand in what appears to be a scar-like spell at Jeremy as Michael was trying to get out of Jerome's hold with all his might.
"I didn't copy it, professor, I promise."
So this was something short one about Draco's (Neville and Harry) important relationships. Of course I want Draco to have some trouble opening up to new relationships and I consider him to be the type of person who hates change.
Anyone with the ability to count with five fingers would know that drinking alcohol the day before the first day of school is the biggest mistake they can make. However, they seemed to ignore it.
Harry Potter had always struck him as one of those who sought fame and recognition, but apparently, they were all ideas of Draco himself.
"What is all that?" Neville points to the owls coming and going with more and more letters that appear to be from the ministry.
He says it for Connor, but somehow he says it for him too.
After long training sessions that week, the Friday of the Gryffindor vs. Hufflepuff game finally arrives. The stands were full in all the houses. The Slytherins were excited to see Gryffindor lose, the Ravenclaws supported their fellow Hufflepuffs and the Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs supported their respective house with pennants and painted faces.
"How did you discover that you are gay?"
Neville shakes his head in time to the music. It's a new group, Draco doesn't know them and because of how bad they sound, he doesn't care either.
"What's that got-"
"Do you at least sing?"
"I was only fertilizing." Harry nods, is about to start checking the place out of curiosity when they hear footsteps and Neville looks up where it is completely blank. Harry also looks over at the footprint spot and sees a boy with the yellowest blond hair he's ever seen and a pompous expression.
"Nothing sweetie, I just wanted to talk about your underwear in my room." Draco bit his lower lip, feigning innocence. And for Salazar to save Draco Malfoy, Neville would get his hands on that jerk as soon as Ernie left.
"I'm afraid not I didn't know his parents long enough to know, but my mother told me that Sirius Black was good with the piano, and musical talent in general."
He puts both arms over Harry's neck and leaves them there. Feel Harry's fingers firmly hold his waist. Draco's in control of the kiss and ends up pulling away for a moment to whisper a "Merry Christmas Harry" which is answered with a "Merry Christmas Draco."
"That's ten points for Gryffindor! With a great pass, Leonor Byrne opens the scoring. David doesn't look happy, let's wait to see his attack." The training begins again under the excited shouts of the students. Wolfgang continues searching for the golden snitch without success and Victoire flies to the other end of the court. The Princhester brothers fly to the center of the field, Helga swoops down when a Quaffle falls lost in midair. The girl rushes to punch for a touchdown for Hufflepuff and Leonor Byrne blocks it. A boo from Hufflepuff resounds and Gryffindor celebrates. "Oh dammit!"
"I only have eyes for you, you bloody Moony."
Draco appreciates that Harry is stupid enough to conclude something like that before he can open his own mouth.
"What are you talking about? I still hate you."
"I love decorating for Christmas, I never did it at my uncles' house, but when I arrived with the Weasleys it was almost a tradition. When I lived with Remus and Sirius it was almost an obligation to do so." Harry smiles wistfully. Draco licks his tongue between his lips.
"WHAT I SEE? KYLE O'NEILL HAS THE SNITCH IN HIS HANDS!" The Slyhterin explode in applause and shouts of celebration. Kyle falls to the ground and everyone runs to him to celebrate. Draco prepares to run to his house to celebrate until he meets Harry's gaze with a smile that doesn't give him a good feeling, but the game is over and there's nothing he can do.
"Neville, he hates me, he's going to kill me if the first thing he sees when he wakes up is me."
"Sh-shut your muh-mouth, Clearwater!" Another Slytherin girl yells at him. Noelle Charming, a fifth year girl who holds the hand of her best friend, Rio.
The cold doesn't let him go back to sleep for more laps than he does instead. He tucks the pillow under his head once more, but that doesn't seem to help much either. Draco is lucky at least, his first class is not until ten in the morning and in case you don't sleep overtime, he will at least get a full day's sleep.
"Right."
"Write an essay on bonding, do all you can because it will be very important later. And go thinking about the person on whom you will use your potion."
"Neville sent me for a potion." Harry Potter calls from the door frame. Draco curses as he jumps into his place in shock.
Ernie waves a hand in the air. "Don't worry, it's nothing, Hannah said you were sick and if it helped you then I'm well served."
Harry turns around without waiting for Draco's response and his figure disappears into the dark hall of the teachers' dormitory. Draco slammed the door and yanked his hair tousled even more than it already was. He hasn't spoken to Neville for almost two weeks, Draco avoided anyone who might question him about the last game, and that included students alike. And he wouldn't admit it out of pride, but he was ashamed, after all he had acted like an eleven-year-old boy.
"We will have to be more strict if we want to win, I say that we meet to rehearse all week at the same time." Haven leads the class.
"Well, loving seems very hasty to me, I don't doubt that two children can know love, I'll tell you how Weasley and Granger looked at each other in the great dining room, but it is hasty, especially considering that you can't even speak when she's there close."
"Together?" Harry asks, still looking sleepy enough to be aware of space-time. Draco suppresses the slight blush that begins to color on his cheeks, looking away.
"Sirius never wanted to link his son with his family, the only ones who knew Teddy were Tonks, Andromeda and Ted. He even wanted to change his last name to Lupin." He says with a laugh. Draco smiles contagiously.
"I don't understand your obsession with that group."
The night starts off badly and Draco just wants to get out of there.
"Don't brag about a war you didn't fight." Harry mutters under his breath so only the man can hear him. He did it in a way that even he had a chill run up his spine, and he wished Potter couldn't feel his goosebumps from him.
"That's mine!"
"Why did he hit you?" A boy from Ravenclaw asks. Evan smiles with a shrug.
"No, I don't think so," Neville mutters under his breath with a frown. Draco was enjoying this, there was no doubt about that. That son of a bitch.
Connor smiles.
"He suspects you're strange with him, but I don't think he thinks that."
So, Merry Christmas early! I hope you have enjoyed the chapter and the drawing I made about the last part. Hope everyone reading this has a happy holiday season or a quiet night. In my country there is still quarantine so please let us be careful with our health.
"Ok?" He asks him when he is already standing, Draco nods.
"Seriously, why are you so interested?" Neville asks.
"My ass is-"
"W-what?"
"Why does this always happen to me?" Draco raises both hands to his head as Neville lies down on his bed. "Weasley, of all the people capable of teaching Quidditch, Weasley!"
"You just yell a lot, you're always yelling," Neville murmurs from his desk stuffing a crisp into his mouth. Muggle junk food was something they had become a fan of in recent days.
"Yeah, I never really thought about that." Draco hugged himself to warm himself. "I still remember her wedding day, Ron was so scared, even when at eleven years old he called her a nuisance." A cheery laugh came from Potter.
"I only told him that you signed us up for this choir contest, and that I didn't want it because it was a big Christmas surprise."
"Why didn't you tell me?" He asks with his fingers curled around Neville's arm.
(See the end of the chapter for
The headache adds to the list of problems that accumulates in his back that Thursday. The day doesn't start well and doesn't seem to want to improve. He's teaching the second-year Gryffindor group. Everything turned to disaster and grunts of impatience.
Toxic Poison started with The end of the work and that was the outlet for Draco, he needed air.
"Who is Marlene?" Neville questions raising his head.
"Are you sure?" Neville asks nervously.
"Of course not, asshole," he said, tossing him a napkin.
"You weren't with the whole Voldemort and nightmares either." Harry smiles, but soon it becomes something he shouldn't have said. The war took a lot of everything. A part of them was also flooded with memory. And although he knew that Harry had never given in to the fear of the name, it brought with it something new and inevitable.
At the beginning of the year I had decided to stop this fanfiction because of the transphobic comments of the author, as a trans person, the least I want is to support people who seek to oppress us as a minority. I feel like I am failing my community to continue with this, but I dare say that if any trans person is reading this, my profile is always open for you, and for anyone who needs to speak to someone.
"There are no Death Eaters here, I don't see why she could want you." Draco teases with a notorious
"Hufflepuff comes onto the field! Am I seeing a new lineup on the Badgers team? Amazing! David Everly is in the back of the lineup. Renée Berry leads by protecting Wolfgang Goldstein and alongside her the unstoppable Paris Green, Hugo Stravinsky and the intrepid Princhester brothers. We'll see how this exciting game turns out. Professor Potter enters the field."
"No, no! I heard you, I heard you, "he says between laughter, moving both hands in front of Draco. "It's just what- demons, Draco."
"HARRY?" An annoying voice comes from the bar and Draco doesn't even have to turn to know who it is. "The man, the legend. Harry Potter, what the hell are you doing here?"
"Yeah, well, I don't know that, but it was annoying not being able to have a root beer with my friends."
"Holy shit, Draco, did they tell you pants aren't second skin?" Neville jokes, looking him up and down with a mocking smile that Draco responds to with a sly smile before slapping him on the forehead with his index finger.
As expected, François's parents made as much or more scandal than Draco expected; It wasn't a surprise even when the boy's mother threatened to destroy the status of the Malfoy family and the sole heir to it, and Draco couldn't smile more when he answered a clear "fuck it."
He stops. Harry walks into the garden with a smile, he hasn't seen him since morning at breakfast.
"I'll have to prepare more."
"Sure? I saw you spilled tea on yourself, didn't you burn yourself?" Harry advances towards him with the intention of looking for the tea stain on Draco's clothes, however, he steps back looking flushed.
Haven's gaze drifted and she gasped for a few seconds, there it was! Of course she left the dirty work to him. He wanted to yell at the girl for not considering that McGonagall would slit her throat if he asked her permission to enter a contest that they were in fact already entered.
"Uh... well, we're co-workers ..."
Oh, if only he wasn't a wimp to talk to Ernie Macmillan he wouldn't have to worry about making his cold schedule not coincide with Ernie's schedule things would be less pathetic.
Malfoy picks up the chart with the list of students who will be staying for Christmas and quickly reads it. "Six Gryffindors, thirteen Ravenclaws seniors; I guess it's because of the N.E.W.T.s. Also two Hufflepuffs and four Slytherins.
In fact, it made sense that he was there all the time; He didn't have his own office yet because the Defence Against the Dark Arts office had a Grindylow infestation or something like that and the remaining classrooms were no better than that room where they had coffee on hand, and cinnamon cookies if they were lucky and the elves felt happy to make an extra dessert.
"No, you hate him, he's just the fool who plays with you."
"How are you doing with the wolves?" He asks after a while because the silence with Potter feels suffocating, especially when he's like this indeed shit.
"Hermione is opening the case to create better conditions for them, they will no longer be locked in cages during full moon nights. Or at least that's the idea, Harry is researching one of the enchanted forests in Wales to make a refuge." Neville explains. "I found that they have trees with healing roots that will help them."
"Yeah, well, he's already had his way with Evan, I don't think he's too shocked by them."
"So...?"
Alice and Frank Longbottom, the happy newlywed couple who were killed by one of the worst hexes during the first wizarding war.
He likes Evan, he's a good boy. He's not his favorite type of guy, but somehow he likes him. He's quiet when he has to and talks up to his elbows the rest of the time. Draco would say that he's a friend of all the students in the school or simply that there is no one who doesn't know him.
"Dean and Seamus? Did you also... invite them?" Ernie denies with a smile.
"Are you saving yourself for marriage?" Draco twists his lips, sighing and denying at the same time.
Connor denies scared.
"We are separated now." He says without much regret. "I didn't mean to bother the Weasleys, and although Ron and Molly insisted that I go with them I feel like I should give Ginny her time."
Draco chuckles mentally, he was told the same thing every year when a new defense teacher walked through the door. A classic, he thought.
(See the end of the chapter for
"How she was...?"
Draco blushes embarrassed. He was the same and he must have made up another last name, a dull and boring one like Longbottom.
Draco can feel Harry dragging him into the men's room, and his body feels strangely light.
That weekend he packs what is necessary for a round trip in two days, maybe they didn't even stay in the house of the two women, but a cautious man is worth two and better safe than sorry. Like on that trip he took with Neville at Easter last year when the plan was to rent a cabin on one of those beaches in Mexico, and it turned out that they didn't even have a reservation and they came back like dogs with their tails tucked between their legs. And instead they stayed in Neville's apartment which was a lot bigger than Draco's fucking room and had French fries with lots of mayo and ketchup.
The girl groans under her breath and twists her lips. "I've told him a million times that I'm not interested, but he never understands."
"Yes."
"You don't look like you don't care tremendously."
"My bed already came with the room, I regret to inform you that I have no clue who the Petitgirard are."
Draco watched the scene in horror and shook his head flatly over and over.
The walk to McGonagall's office down the hallways isn't very comforting. He bumps into a couple of prefects who are doing their usual rounds, but he doesn't stop to give a proper greeting because he feels that the later he talks to the headmistress, the more she will get mad at him for being such an idiot that anyone defies his authority.
And okay, he's trying to push his recent fight with Draco out of his mind which is not good because Draco is not just anyone who gets mad and lets it go by with the days, he's more sensitive than that. He knows his routine, he's going to lock himself in his office to write the thousand and one potions that he knows by heart, and he's probably going to invent one that will not go well, so the next thing on his list is to cry and get depressed because again he will. He feels lonely and abandoned by the world (and he's being selfish for not clearing things up, but he must also mature).
Draco becomes alert when he sees Connor's crystallized eyes that have already started to shake. It's not normal at Connor Tremlett. He is generally peaceful, with almost no expression on his face.
"I haven't had sex in three years, and I can't even masturbate."
"When I told Neville I was coming he said you would probably be upset."
Draco's life is usually quiet, yeah, he's a potions professor in a magic school and he is a former Death Eater who is called to testify once a month to assure the rest of the world that he is not dangerous and that he is not plotting the third wizarding war. And yes, his life is as quiet as it would be for a man who was on the wrong side in a war that took lives and alienated many other wizards like Theodore, leading them straight into the drab Muggle life of England, the one Draco he secretly wanted to flee on his worst days.
The music hits Draco's ears right away. There are too many people in the place, some of them are dancing and others are just at their tables drinking. His heart stops when he sees two girls kissing with no one paying any attention to them.
The next morning the weather didn't even seem to improve. Draco doesn't need to poke his nose through the window curtains to realize what a cloudy and rainy night it is outside.
Potter guides it until his office, and attentively, Draco is already lighting the campfire, he doesn't even care if the smell remains in his office, at the moment he cares not to die of a hypothermia.
"Uh, no, I was coming to visit you, you know, and I was carrying some bottles from my sister's pharmacy, it was coincidence. But you weren't there, so I was going home right then."
It's Draco's third year teaching at Hogwarts. He teaches potions because he always thought it was what he was best at. He owed a lot to his godfather.
"Ah, well, I just love have plenty of gifts to me and it's enough for me. I got a stuffed frog from Connor, right, Con?" The boy nods flushed. "I have not named it, but as soon as I have it I will let you know."
"If McGonagall sees us arrive like this, rest assured we'll be fired in less than a madrake sings," he murmurs with slow pauses as he slurrs and Harry doesn't take his eyes off him. "We can go to my apartment and come back tomorrow."
Neville received the pepper potion.
Harry nods smiling, then slaps Neville on the shoulder and leaves the staff room.
"Uh, yes, please." Draco sits in one of the chairs across from the headmistress's desk and watches his teacup fill up.
"Connor, your sister loves you."
"Are you okay, Draco?" Asks Harry, taking him out of his train from thought. He nods fiercely feeling his teeth crashing hard inside his mouth. "Let's go inside? I don't want to bother you or anything, but I would appreciate if you gave me a little bit after, there's no longer."
"Nothing..."
"I don't know if I'm ready to go back to headaches, guys," he said at Halloween dinner. The Slytherins had taken great care in decorating while the rest of the houses were more concerned with getting the best sweets. Except for Hufflepuff who was more eager to give the best candy. Like Evan McGregor who's searching through heads of the students for the shy Connor Tremlett.
Neville rolls his eyes and snorts. "As usual. I'll sit by the fire pit, make one of those homemade tomato soups, and go to sleep thinking how much I wish I had a cookie, sinking into my misery."
"You could have planted this staging! No one would be such an idiot to take it to cheat and put the stupid name on the label!" Malfoy shoves Harry.
Notes and more notes about the famous magic pine used in the magic yule were giving him a huge headache that was beginning to be unbearable.
So going back to work doesn't sound so bad anymore because he at least he's able to not think about Ernie all the time when he has to worry about not cutting off any of his students' hands. Although at the end of the day Ernie is always there, and the pain in the stomach; which is more like a broken heart invades him until he wants to lock himself in his office to listen to Sagittarius = Tears at full volume while he feels sorry for himself because he is not able to go straight to Ernie and ask him if he likes boys, or if at best of the cases, he likes him.
With the end of the first semester and December exams coming through the door with the bells set for the holidays, the most exciting topics also began according to Draco. The first few months were simply a preheat with absinthe and fire paprika for simple and almost useless potions, and although he seemed to be the only one excited about it, he knew they would end up liking it. Especially since in third year most of the adolescent crushes arose.
The din is louder when Victoire and Levi are named. It was no secret that many considered them attractive and Davies even had a kind of fan club. Draco scoffed secretly, Teddy was too obvious how much he liked Victoire and from the girl's response, it seemed like the feeling was mutual.
"What's wrong with you? Don't you want to win the house cup at the end of the year?" The Slytherin team turns to look at him in surprise. Of course they wanted the cup.
"It's very kind of you, Connor, but I'm afraid I have to take care of this."
Of course Draco pulled out one of the envelopes and set about making tea for the entire afternoon of work that awaited him. At that moment an owl with a letter with the seal of the Malfoy family came through the window and dropped the letter on his desk. He sets aside his cup of tea and rushes to take the letter in his hands, he watches it carefully for a couple of seconds before deciding to ignore it as he has done since the war ended.
"François, gather your things, you will go home."
know him possess.
"They were taken by surprise, professor!" Yells a Slytherin with red cheeks and tears in his eyes, Rio Wolff.
Blaise rarely took the time to open the door for him, or woke up next to him the morning after he slept together so there were months when he didn't get much attention, but that's fine because that allows him to find a charm right now the one Harry says, "Come in and get comfortable."
"Yeah well..." He takes a sip of his beer. "I would have loved to find more, but that wasn't possible, I guess, maybe I should just look for more. Although Teddy will blow his mind when he sees the photos of Remus and Sirius. We don't have many at home, Remus didn't like photographs."
"Well, we're still waiting for the wizarding council and the Ministry to approve it."
Draco smiles, opens his mouth to take a deep breath, and shoves Neville lightly in a playful way. "Did you want to be a sexy teacher?"
"What!?"
"What are you doing here?" Spits. Harry doesn't back down. He maintains a desperate and worried expression.
"Longbottom sent it to me." Harry's puzzled look tells Draco that he hasn't played well with his words. He shakes his head in denial, licks his tongue over his lips, and gasps a few times before correcting himself. "It's an old joke between us, we're not involved or anything."
"No, I'm afraid not, Professor Malfoy, but I don't know much about Muggle disease and I'm terrified that it's a disease without a cure."
"We couldn't expect less with Herms in command." Neville nods trying his best to smile, the stuffy nose killing him.
Draco looks at the mess that is his office. There are a bunch of coats piled up on one of the chairs and he doesn't even stop to wonder when all of that got there, and his entire bookcase seems to be empty because all his books are in fact on the table next to his chair. the entrance. He does as much as he can by waving his wand in the air and arranges everything just before Harry shows up at the door with an embarrassed smile and the tip of his nose red.
McGonagall closes her eyes and nods. Draco leaves as fast as he can, but manages to hear the punishment for his house. They will have two hundred points less on the final point count. Malfoy stops in the middle of the stairs, falling onto a step.
Draco looks out the window at some of the boys who have gone out to play in the snow as has been their custom since the first snow and smiles when he sees Evan playing next to Teddy and Cecyl, a Gryffindor girl. And he almost fell backwards as Harry Potter flew past him on his broom at the speed of the wind; he spills some tea on his sweater so he rushes to wipe himself with a napkin. Harry turns around, goes back to the window and greets Draco before giving him a signal indicating that he will go to his office.
Harry enters with cautious steps, even for being drunk he seemed to keep the same composure that he always maintained around him, walking as if he were taking care of something, perhaps that this was a trap and Draco was actually a Death Eater who seduced him into bring him to his apartment and kill him.
"I know but-"
"We haven't made any progress, the council is difficult and finding a free werewolf willing to set foot on the ministry is... it's complicated, technically they sign a death warrant. I know from Remus that his biggest fear was ending up in the silver cages of the ministry."
Neville moved closer to him. A hand placed on Draco's shoulder. "Edward Lupin's father was a werewolf. We all saw how difficult it was for him to bear the pain after the transformation... Harry says it was worse when Sirius was... gone."
November had been a quiet month after his altercation with the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, usually there was nothing to upset the stirrups in Draco's mind. All the students were getting better at Potions by then and the 7th graders they finally managed to create an almost perfect Amortentia. The suspension of the Slytherin Quidditch team was also ending that month and things couldn't be better, at least until Haven walked through his office door being timidly followed by two Hufflepuffs and a Ravenclaw. His long skirt accompanied by bright gray and pink rhombus stockings wavy with his constant bobbing.
"They died. But I try to pretend that didn't happen."
"What do I do here?"
"Oh, look who's talking...
However, all these people seem to care too much, and he can't be a selfish bastard who has decided that being a killjoy at one of the most important holidays for wizards is his mission.
Draco sighs. "Three years?" He falls into the individual chair.
Harry leaves it on one of the sinks and makes sure to hold it under his armpits so he can wipe his pants off, and from Harry's face, Draco guesses he looks pathetic.
But Draco doesn't like Harry.
"You were eye-catching, you mean," Draco jokes, getting a blush from Harry.
"That's the last straw, Mr. François!" Draco exclaims, his face is red and the blood boils under his skin. The students back away, even Jerome and Gilbert shut their mouths. "I will advocate for their expulsion."
"Ernie gave you mandrakes a few weeks ago, you couldn't finish them so soon."
The group looks at him in alarm, as if a screw had been removed and he's now whinnying with insanity. Draco narrows his eyes and raises his arms to move them.
"You know what? Sounds good, Ernie, uh, maybe I will." Ernie smiles back at Harry and is about to speak when a voice yells from his pocket. It's Hannah's voice, Neville acknowledges.
No, they didn't lose their habits.
Harry laughs nervously. "Yes, but... do you like it as... like when you love someone?"
A small flash shines right in front of Teddy and the boy can see Wolfgang flying towards him and little Penny following him. Teddy ducks down just in time to dodge the two boys. "In the name of Helga Hufflepuff! That was fast, the snitch is already in the game, ladies, gentlemen and others. We'll see who will win the victoire in this game." Several laugh at the bad joke, including Neville and Draco can't help but put a hand to his forehead. "Wolfgang flies like lightning, he's nowhere near the snitch, come on, buddy, you can and oh, look at that! Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. Gryffindor wins thanks to the golden snitch caught by Penny Lambert! What a game. It gave me the creeps."
"There it is! We are going to Japan." An excited Evan jumps in his place, out of Haven's grasp. "I heard that one of Taiwan's most famous magizoologists teaches there. Is it true that they are transported in dragons?"
"Why would what be a problem?" Harry asks coming out of Merlin will know where, and why the hell is everyone here all of a sudden? Better put the tea in case McGonagall needs anything.
"Yes," Potter agrees.
"I guess we're all aware that winter holidays starts this Monday." Some students make festive noises and others snort in annoyance. "And it's a mutual agreement between us never to send homework during Christmas, but I reviewed his assignments for the past few days, and...” Draco brings the palm of his hand to his face and shakes in a tired voice. "You're my worst group, okay? And I don't want to see bad grades, especially in the students of my house, so to upload your grades you'll write eight scrolls on dragon scale substitutes, two scrolls on The Natural Conservation Agreements of Magical Animals from 2001 and an extra couple about the investigations of Tomás Alebrie."
"Why do you keep calling me that? I feel like I'm talking to one of my students." Draco leans into his arms. The music was too loud.
Pomfrey almost runs in with Neville trying to keep up with the woman and failing at all.
"Damn," Draco murmurs, dropping his face into his hands as a sign of his own defeat. He's being very soft on them. He may hear his godfather reproach him for not sending them six homework scrolls, an essay on how wormwood is not added before the crystal drops.
"I told you to call him Professor Potter, Lupin!" Professor Flitwick admonishes Teddy. A general laugh is heard when he apologizes.
"I don't think Harry is capable of cheating."
Harry waves a hand in denial before speaking in a tired tone. "You need to rest. If you continue like this you will not be able to attend the Halloween party."
"You got into my conversation with Ernie."
Neville never dared to listen to The Beatles again after Sirius' death the summer of that same year. Doing so felt like disrespect for Sirius and for Remus who was so shattered after his death that the full moons left him almost haggard. "Wolf stuff." He had told them.
The cunning way he had gotten to his office was the same when he left. He obviously relished the opportunity to tease him, and he could feel him savoring victory by ruining his life (which honestly isn't an exaggeration). But he was very wrong if he thought it was going to make things easier for him, especially if Harry was making fun of him.
His eyes see Harry's face and the useless potion on the table. He goes back to Harry and his gaze turning into something more worried, and suddenly everything is spinning, he looks at his own blurred hands and it's a matter of seconds for everything to be black and his body hurts.
He curses all the time for everything. The game is coming up and his team doesn't seem to have a decent search engine. Kyle O'Neill keeps his head in the clouds and if it weren't for racing against time he would be looking for a better search engine. It is not explained how such an absent boy reached such a decisive position for a match. Influences? Says the little voice in his head. Or wasn't he having fun fighting Potter instead of playing?
Harry grimaces. Since when were his eyes so green? Not just green, but seriously, really green. Like two sparkling emeralds in his eyes he would be an idiot if him didn't stop to look.
"This year it's the choir competitions against the other schools of magic."
It has not been the same in recent weeks. Who would be the same knowing that his mother can call him at any time to tell him that he is a disgrace? But Evan has added him to his recurring circle of friends and while he doesn't seem sure he fits in, after three years he's trying.
"Here it is, this is our table." Ernie stops at a table in the back. It's lucky unless he's away from the dance floor. "You guys want something? I can go get our drinks."
Draco turned his gaze to the blond boy again, surprised to see that his hair was as red as his face. It would have been fun another time, but not this time.
Neville smiles and throws his head to the side. "Well, they played my first dance. It's nostalgic."
This time the kiss is demanding and he doesn't plan to end as soon as the past.
"Nonsense, let's all go together. I bet you want to see Thomas and Finnigan, you guys were great friends, if I remember correctly."
Harry looks at him indignantly. "I already apologized, Draco. I didn't even read it or something."
Harry smiles at him, no teeth, just lips and Draco looks away, as if his body itches.
Harry smirks with a goofy blush accentuating in that spot where the glasses shade him. He's looking at him for two seconds because the third one looks up and his smile widens making him turn too.
"However," he begins, "I'm not going to let you hide something like that from me. I'll keep an eye on Gilbert, but I need you to tell me if he's going too far. No matter what, I need you to tell me, okay?"
"Ernie never wrote to me once, what's wrong with me?" Neville wails, putting a hand on his forehead. Draco walks into the room in long strides.
Draco stiffens in place for some reason. He feels his heart pounding inside his chest as if he's going down to his stomach and up to his throat.
"What do I do here?"
He barely finishes his breakfast and heads to his classroom in the dungeons. He says goodbye to Neville with a mocking smile when he sees him appear with dark circles under his eyes and an obvious migraine that seems to be drilling his brain.
"Oh, so you haven't told him yet."
"Ugh, those decrepit old men. You can't expect anything good from a bunch of idiot old men." A laugh echoed behind Malfoy, he whirled around with a frown so frowning it probably reached the center of his face.
"You have your mother's eyes," Dorcas murmurs very softly.
"That was horrible, I'm very sorry you saw me in that state."
"What are you doing here, Nev?" The girl is in front of him, the same or more smiling than Neville.
He liked Neville, he was a good boy and he didn't hate him, which was the important thing at this point. He had a fondness for talking about exotic plants up to his elbows, true, but if you could divert his attention, he was someone interesting to carry on a conversation with. He had become "hot", as the girls defined it, and that led him to receive confessions from students at least once a month. And it would have been funny if it weren't because it was actually scary.
"It's an unbranded torture spell, ancient magic that leaves only the sensation of pain. Unfortunately it doesn't fall under the ministry code." Harry twists his lips. Draco is pissed off, but even now he knows that making a great scene won't do any good, it's no one's fault in that room.
"Come on, laugh if you want."
"Do you ... uh, do you feel something like better?"
"Harry kicks off the game!"
"May I ask what happened to you and the Weasley girl?" Harry nods, adjusting his glasses on the bridge of his nose with his index finger.
"Gilbert found me looking at- Peter Helmings," he explains, "then he pushed me against the stairs and said he would tell my parents that their son is a... faggot." Connor was crying. At this point, Draco was no longer worried, he was angry and turned to rage. He wanted to go and hit Gilbert with his own hand. "He's been doing it since last year, but now we have more time together."
But at the worst possible moment, his cold decides that it is time to play a bad trick on him and when he sneezes a balloon of mucus comes out of his nose. Disgusting.
"I... I don't know, I don't know if I can go alone, what if they tell me things I don't want to hear like- like with Snape?" Draco lifts his head, meeting the gaze of the two men. "I'm sorry... I didn't mean to-"
It doesn't take long, but it does take longer than expected until they find themselves in the magical town of Ireland and climb a hill to the purple houses at the top, and according to the letter they sent to Ron, this must be where they live.
Of course he has two options when he's in front of the door. He could leave the jar on the door for Neville to find when he comes out, but there's also the option to swallow his pride and not act like a jerk who isn't a good friend for a change.
"So you were coming here because she… sent you?"
"Thanks Harry, but it was Draco who trained my boys this time."
"We're fine, we're gay and we're married." Seamus responds showing his hand with the ring.
The memories of the night before hit him hard and although they were vague and fuzzy, he could recall confessing his sexual orientation to Potter. A blur of Potter sitting next to him in the astronomy tower, the cold autumn wind gently hitting his face, the ghastly thoughts of how pretty Potter's emerald green eyes were, or how favorable their difference in height was. in a more intimate situation.
"Ron is always talking about Hermione and how she's the best magic minister ever had in the wizarding world."
"It means you can't be here, Mr. Lupin." Draco mutters and Teddy smiles at him, the way little Sirius in the family photo of his mother smiled, with teeth and that dimple on his right cheek. "Don't make a fuss or they'll figure it out."
"For how long?"
"I didn't even know that I would end up here as a teacher."
and then he stops, because he's acting like a spoiled five year old and he's pathetic, but the feeling stays there and doesn't go away.
"I know how... to take care of myself."
"I don't think you want to come in and help me anyway." Draco's face flushes red before heading off to the kitchen to make tea as soon as possible.
Draco feels a knot tighten in his stomach. Try to calm down, after all the Centella 3006 weren't a big deal, the Windbreakers were much better, faster, and less wobbly. And Fresia McKinnon was terrific with her strategies, they had nothing to worry about if she was on the lookout for any suspicious Potter moves.
"As soon as you learn of the condition of your sister, feel free to write. I'll see what I can do." Rolanda takes Draco's hands and thanks with tiny tears at the edges of her eyes.
The rhythm of Black Cardigans was stimulating for anyone, it wasn't even necessary to know how to dance, the song itself carried you. ''Be-Sexual'' was her latest hit and was playing on WWN radio despite complaints from some pureblood families. Neville as a twenty-six-year-old bisexual man couldn't feel more identified by the lyrics of the song that spoke of a girl in love with his best friend and fascinated by the beauty of a Quidditch player. Rumors even spoke of Falmouth Falcons player Gilbert Anders as the inspiration for the song. Gina Brilliant's voice was great and it worked like a pretty uplifting vitamin. Full of unmatched energy.
"Hey! Watch out." Draco bites his lower lip hard, closes his eyes resigned. Holy crap, why today of all days? Why today? "Draco ... hey."
He doesn't need to dwell on the question because as soon as he leaves the principal's office, he finds Harry Potter sitting on the floor half asleep in a position that doesn't look very comfortable. He feels his heart stop for a second to go down to his stomach. Metaphorically, of course.
"And the blows of that spell!? Michael was writhing even when they lowered him."
And Draco didn't need to lose for magic points taken from the tip of the-
"If you're busy giving a good presentation, I'm sure they might consider it." Draco says very calmly, but his body was burning under his skin, as if he had an instinct installed in his body and the need to fight Harry had grown. "They love graphics, but you should know that by now, you worked with them after all."
Draco likes to be attentive to him, it is a detail that fascinates him in a man, and although he doesn't know if it's something that should fascinate him in Harry Potter, but the truth is that he loves it.
"Teachers, please take the students to their compartments, we have to avoid a ruckus. Welcome Professor Weasley, I see that Madame Hooch has done a great job finding a replacement." Professor Flitwick shakes Ron's hand, and he nods in the same way with a slight blush on his cheeks.
"It doesn't really interest me."
I want to apologize for any mistakes, this time I used words that were a little out of my knowledge. I would be so grateful if you let me know of the mistakes.
Neville makes no attempt to stop him. He stays for a moment listening to his footsteps back to the castle, but he doesn't move. He doesn't want to see himself in the position of having to choose one of his friends as who he likes the most, or who made fun of him the least all this time because there were certainly many other things in his friendship with Draco or Harry. If they believed he was going to enter their game they were very wrong.
Girls like Noelle don't live quietly, and people like Gilbert and Jerome aren't happy until there's no blood between their fingers.
Harry flushes with anger and clenches his jaw as if he's summoning all of his strength not to hit this boy. The rest of the students argue that he should be expelled. And everything is too much.
"They must have been very close."
"I would have preferred a little more sun." Put his hands together to get friction and get some heat.
Neville accelerates his steps to cross the wave of people that flood the streets until he reaches the door of the botany. He tucks his nose into his Hufflepuff scarf and hides his hands in the pockets of his old corduroy coat (a Ron's gift last Christmas). After he learned to weave he seemed to have taken the tradition from his mother and decided to make one for each of his friends. The man was talented, by the way.
"I'll have my first class at eleven in the morning," he says. He wants to tell him that he doesn't mind knowing about his class and that he knows he doesn't care either, to stop being friendly or shit, but he doesn't.
"A round of Fire Whiskey for Harry Potter." Says the bartender from The Three Brooms with a smile so big it seems to hurt.
They don't talk much at the time, he doesn't know if it's because there is nothing to say, because the ravages of his drunkenness are already taking effect or because they are the kind of people who can be close to each other in normal silence. Draco has nothing clear with Harry, or what kind of relationship they have, if it's okay for him to listen to conversations about his family; he doesn't even know if it's right for him to accompany him when he could call anyone, friends weren't something Potter lacked ... unless he saw it as a charity case, did he feel sorry for how lonely he was it now?
"Did you really notice it?" Draco says. Harry remains silent, his gaze fixed on him until he makes a strange movement and quickly wipes the drool from his mouth and tries to accommodate his hideous clump of hair and then finally speaks again.
Draco thinks,
Evan and Connor present a gift to each other just after Evelyn hands him a small tube wrapped in gold foil. Victoire stays by her side even as everyone gathers to break the huge chocolate cake the elves made just for the occasion.
"And raising your grades on potions, you stinky dwarf." Harry appears next to him taking him of the tea Draco made for him to give him a sip.
He's afraid he will not be able to go this year with the tranquility he had planned. Although he has never been able to make Harry Potter move of his way.
"Oh... I must go, see you in front of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes on Saturday in two weeks at nine, okay?"
"Listen well, Weasley; I hate myself, but I can bet my ass it's not because I'm gay." Harry smiles and Ron follows suit.
"I thought you learned."
"I won't have a hangover," Neville says. Draco smirks.
He advances to the front where Roderick Kettleburn points to the seat next to him.
"I don't see another war nearby so far, but you're going to fall on your ass with this. Do you know who else is teaching?"
Neville turns with a grimace seeing his escape being interrupted, his mind is ready to respond with the first excuse that comes to mind, but when he meets the reddish hair and the sea of freckles, his mind goes blank, leaving a surprised and excited smile on his face.
They return to their path going to one of the tables at the back. Harry walks in greeting the owners' daughter and she tells him that her table is set aside as usual.
"Did what?" The way he asks is slow, as if a large part of him expected this to be a trick of his mind, as if this girl hadn't led Draco to the wolf's mouth to be mercilessly devoured.
No, it was totally gross.
Because it's nothing from Ernie, and this feels like a crime, like imagining Ernie doing to him Helga will know what. Is an invasion, and he doesn't know if that's the case, but he doesn't. He pushes Ernie out of his mind as much as possible and does nothing but change the temperature of the water because he now needs a cold shower.
"No, you're drunk."
Music flooded the room, The Goblins blared, Neville as always danced deftly, the colored lights shining on his face and the drink in his hand shaking to his beat. Draco always wanted to ask, if Neville hadn't leaned toward herbology and being a teacher, would he have been a dancer? The traveling circus of the Prichatt brothers always carried great dancers from Russia and Scotland. It would have been a good life, traveling the world without worries, receiving ovations from the public.
"It's Teddy's birthday, come on, Evan McGregor asked me to take you as soon as possible."
Filch leaves Mcgonagall's office and runs with Mrs. Norris in hand. The three of them wait until Filch returns with the students who appear in the office with incredible calm for someone who has been called to the principal's office. Even when they have won a Quidditch school match.
"Your seeker has disadvantages against Gryffindor, his seeker measures the same as my hand, that makes him totally fast and the last time he was in the center, that way he has a better chance of finding the snitch. Wolfgang, you are very tall, take that to your advantage, I want you to be in the center And you... Renée I want you to move to her left."
He nods, a little point of happiness growing in his stomach.
"My team didn't cheat!" He exclaims furiously. "It's Potter playing a trick on us!"
The bludgers take off in the sky, and the first to hit one is Paris, who sends it straight to Levi Taylor, the girl is booed. The bludger is blocked by Milton Li and Leonor Byrne rushes to shove a quaffle into the opposing team's hoops.
"From your face, anyone would realize that it was a shitty day." Someone says behind his back. And no, it's not what he needs now. Of all that could have come, this is what he least needed.
"Exactly, Miss McKinnon. Any ideas, Mr. Milton?" The boy shrugs, but behind him Kyle shivers like crazy instead. "What's the matter with you, Mr. O'Neill?"
Draco's face turns white and when he tries to stand up suddenly he feels the overwhelming pain in his entire body that does not allow it and makes him return to his starting position.
"Shut your mouth, asshole."
"No, I have no idea how to start even, and McGonagall instructed the elves not to help me."
"What kind of an adult would I be if I destroyed the illusion of a child?"
This was bad, I know, the school is removing me the desire to write or do anything in general. But I promise that the next chapters will be long and will make sense.
, but today. Just today, which should be a great night to undress and live his five senses, he's wrapped in alcohol in a bar in Hogsmeade forgetting about the dignity and elegance that he
"I was thinking of looking for Pansy by asylum."
"Uhm ... doesn't that sound very simple? I had thought that it could have a more... uhm- more magical name, because Connor gived it to me, is it bewitched?" Connor denies and Evan purses his lips in disappointment.
Silence finds a place between them. Draco doesn't move, he doesn't know what to say or what words to use, and Connor looks down, waiting for the professor to kick him out of his office requesting his direct expulsion from Hogwarts. But that never happens. Draco instead gets up from his spot and walks around the desk to sit down and walk over to Connor.
"It really was embarrassing."
"Oh, Merlin. Merlin, Merlin, Merlin." Neville moves all over the place trying to remove the dirt from his pants and almost crying when he approaches Harry to ask him if he smells like dirt.
"They had no problem, Lily was a bit shocked, but ... by now she was a totally open mind and heart. After all, her best friend was a werewolf, right?"
That day he puts on lotion, a new one that he ordered from the Pansy perfumery and that came to him in the Parkinson's owl three days ago. It was the same one he used in important events in his family, the one that smelled of peppermint. He doesn't cover himself as he would have done in early January and, on the contrary, takes off layers of clothing, leaving only the usual emerald silk shirt under the tunic and the gray vest that hangs around the body in the waist area. He doesn't wear a tie and swaps it for his old student scarf. He fixes his hair by ruffling everything, setting aside all the hair wax that he usually uses.
"You know names escape me, Harry." Ron nods. "But hey, Remus with that hoarse voice that he had did not give one for music, although he still sang the songs of David Bowie and those of Queen at full volume."
Neville stopped abruptly, it was as if the world and his heart had sped up at the same time to start moving like mad in space as he struggled to catch his breath.
"Nice to meet you, Draco Malfoy."
Several boys laugh blushing.
"I don't know if I was ever in a good time for love, because, I would like to know if this is going to get worse."
He saw no reason to have a second party when there was already dinner in the great hall. Did she have a boyfriend and was that why she was in such a good mood?
The boy nods excitedly. "Do you think she likes... me?"
The fireplace is lit and Draco can hear murmurs and laughter from outside. A horrible headache makes him squeeze his eyes shut, and then he realizes how dry his mouth feels, probably from drinking so much the night before.
"The usual, please." There's something in the voice of the subject sitting next to him that makes him look at him, and for Merlin, not this.
The woman nods satisfactorily. "I imagine you have classes tomorrow, so I'll let you go for now. Goodnight."
"Well, you will sit next to ... Roderick Kettleburn. Raise your hand, please."
Draco clearly looks much more upset, and he must have guessed this would happen.
After the last Gryffindor match against Slytherin, Neville caught a horrible cold that was boring his head from the endless headaches and constant runny nose that had already irritated his nose to the point where Neville believed that at any moment the tip of his nose would fall off. the nose in pieces.
They are at the beginning of February, the snow continues to fall, but the sun already illuminates the mornings and although the children can still skate on the lake, the snow is already melting between their fingers.
"Poor man, why didn't you go to the Macmillan store?"
"What is yule?" Evan asks.
Then Dean Thomas takes the stage where he announces Black Cardigans and the screams increase when they announce that their first song of the night is their latest hit "Be-Sexual". Some girls at tables near his stand up ready to dance and Draco pours another glass of pomace, his fingers feeling too out of control and weak as he tries to hold the bottle of pomace.
"Merlin, Christine." He brings one hand to the bridge of his nose and takes a deep breath. "I've already explained ten times that absinthe is not added at the end." He's desperate to get a good potion for today's class of at least one student.
Draco doesn't realize he has been staring at Harry until the man scrambles into place waking up from his sleep. He's not wearing his glasses and he assumes he doesn't see him looking away quickly. Harry stretches out on the nightstand and probes several times until he finds the ugly round glasses and brings them to his face.
"Hi," he greets.
Draco didn't know much about James Potter outside of the inordinate hatred his godfather had for him. But he knew a little more about Lily Evans; that her sister was grumpy and that she told her that she would burn in hell like all witches did and that she cried a lot at night because she didn't want her sister to hate her, and because she didn't want to burn in Hell. That what she least wanted was to lose her family during the war, that she went to Snape to convince him that Voldemort's side was not the right one, that he wept and asked for forgiveness.
The two remain silent. The radio continues to run on the Wireless Magic Network and when the Macbeth witches' turn with "Do the Hipogriff" ends, Draco stands with the papers from the last job he commissioned from his class in hand. Neville continues to hum the song on the radio as he grades his students' homework.
He can tell by his expression. He's putting his whole life in his hands and Draco is scared.
"What the hell are you looking at?"
"You are damn strange, Potter. Only you give a shit like that, you know I would have hit you?"
"You know what, Potter?"
"I thought that we could coexist behaving like adults and not like immature children, I see that it is not like that."
"It turns into a bed, and is of course a quality sofa; I bought it with the Petitgirard a couple of years ago."
There are three photos, one of the two women with Harry's parents, another of Harry's parents with Remus Lupin, Sirius Black and someone he recognized as Peter Pettigrew, but he had a spell and his face was not seen in the photo. The last one was of Sirius and Remus sleeping on the floor with... penises drawn on their faces and James Potter laughing in the background.
The punishment for François and Clearwater is four weeks of punishment without magic. They have no right to go home for Christmas and their families are informed about their mischief with two students. Draco hears that Gilbert Clearwater's father sends a letter to the principal asking her to forgive his son and let him go for the holidays. Fortunately, McGonagall says no and the punishment of the two boys is in charge of Professor Flitwick who also drops a hundred points for Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Which according to Draco's accounts, puts Hufflepuff and Gryffindor in the lead by just three points of difference between the two houses.
Although the most obvious thing after the war was to accept that blood differences were dangerous, important families like Jerome's did not understand. And Neville couldn't be more glad that they took that kid out, especially with all the bullying he was giving Noelle.
Still he feels Harry can hear the sound of his heart about to come out of his chest.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Thank you, it looks beautiful."
"No." He sentences and takes two steps closer to Harry with a dangerous look that makes Potter recoil. Draco could have scoffed, but he doesn't. "You don't care. You're here because you're making fun of me, you're taking this opportunity to rub my face that you won and that I'm a stupid bad shit teacher and-

Christmas was spent with the Weasley family, Neville's grandmother had passed away two years after the war and he had no one else for the holidays, of course the always cheerful Weasleys took him under their wing. For his part, Harry lived in the Black mansion with Teddy and they appeared together anywhere. Everyone loved talking about his parents with the little Edward. The great adventures of the sensible Remus Lupin and the rebellious Sirius Black.
"Neville isn't coming today, take my word, he'll be in the greenhouse waiting for Ernie to show up with his thousand roses." Draco points, lowering the newspaper. Harry gives Weasley a puppy dog look and he nods in defeat.
The atmosphere is tense. Draco clears his throat, going from behind the desk to taking his place in front of it, leaning back. The glances quickly come to him expectantly. A final Ravenclaw student runs in and takes his place in the back. Draco casts a spell and the door closes. He recognizes a some of students, the others have been erased from his memory, or their names just don't seem to be on his mental list.
"If something bothers you you can tell us, I know you like to have the professor's room just for you and for... Neville, I suppose you are very close, right?"
With careless steps he left the room to go to the astronomy tower. He hummed in time with Kingsley as he dragged his long limbs through the hallways, ignoring the annoying noises from the squares on the walls.
"You guys are doing great. Anya, please raise your tone higher, I can't perceive you among your classmates. Edward, go to the back, you're covering up Evan. Connor, please I need you on the other side, yeah, right between Natalie and Felicity."
It is not what he expected after two years of relationship.
"Hello, Neville," Harry says, smiling. "Too much alcohol again?"
"Professor Malfoy, finally you wake up."
They leave Hogwarts because they cannot appear there, no matter how cool Harry Potter is, and they walk in the direction of Hogsmeade from where it seems that the sun is rising barely bright and still it colors their skin golden and it's funny how it is freezing the tip of their noses, but still the sun shines on their cheeks.
Neville knows that it's that inferiority complex that he has been a victim of all his life, he finds it difficult to accept compliments and more difficult to believe them.
"Okay, you didn't ask her and you're hoping that I'll fix it."
Draco wants a dragon to swallow him and spit him out in Scotland. Maybe on a cliff, he doesn't care, he just wants to escape this situation as easy as possible. "Don't get used to this, Potter."
"I see you are a bit busy, professors."
"I'd wait for it to be approved, you know, we shouldn't claim victory ahead of time."
And it was true, Draco had never been curious to touch himself or anyone else. He had listened to Theodore a few times in the bedroom bathroom. His moans were low, making it easier to hear him through the door, and he had to put a silencing spell on the bathroom more than once. Only for the damned to look at him the next morning and smile at him as if he had done it all on purpose.
Anyone would think that it's sad that your boyfriend leave you after the relationship you thought would be the right one, yes, and it is even more sad and cruel, damn, that your boyfriend leave you on the twenty-third of December when there's a mistletoe over their heads with the words
"We should wait for Neville... right?"
"I kissed you, and that wasn't right. You should have hit me, and yet you didn't..."
"I'm accompanying Neville on his date, Draco and I are keeping each other company." Harry extends his hand to point at Draco and the man spins around with almost inhuman speed.
The plan to approach Principal McGonagall had to be fail-safe, not very flattering because she would know right away that something was up, and nothing to be a jerk because she and anyone else hated assholes. He had to find an exact middle ground between being nice, but not very nice, and rude, but not too much. Which in itself was difficult considering that Draco Malfoy had never been good at dealing with Minerva McGonagall, not when he was eleven years old, not now twenty-four. She was a tough nut to crack.
"How have you and Harry been? Has he gotten into trouble? Has he already defeated another evil wizard or is he finally using the school for what he is?" Neville laughs. A loud laugh that catches the attention of some Slytherin and Ravenclaw students who, as always, are the most punctual.
Draco stands still in his place, cursing under his breath, taking the glass of whiskey between his fingers, careful enough not to attract the attention of Harry Potter, but the weight of the alcohol already on his body makes him a bad move attacking with his balance making him stagger in movement. Harry holds him in his arms in a firm grip under the arch of his armpits.
By instinct, the first thing he does is try to ask what is happening, but he can not even open his mouth when he's already closing it quickly. He takes two of his fingers to his nose pressing her in an attempt by no smelling. Suddenly, everyone's eyes have tears by the stinging of the strong smell that floods the room.
"He's not 'just Ernie', Harry, he's  Ernie, the guy I've liked for two years. I cannot calm down."
Ernie nods wisely. The years have passed well on him, now he had a slight blond beard and his eyes were much darker than before. He could abandon his little human dignity and sigh falling at her feet. Now, right at this moment.
"Connor, look at me." The boy continues to tremble looking at his taut thighs. "Connor, look at me," he repeats. Connor nods, facing him. Draco notices makeup on his face, in the chin area. Oh no-. "Hell, Connor, what did that idiot do to you?"
"Mr. François, Mr. Clearwater, you'd better pack your things because I'll see to it that they are sent home at least until after Christmas break."
If it bothers him?
His breath reeked of alcohol, he probably drank more than firewhiskey.
"I... I was wondering if you would like to go... with me."
"Everyone seems to be noticing. How wonderful."
A Hufflepuff in the background stumbles to his feet, the group chuckling.
Music was all Neville lived for. From The Witches of Macbeth to The Goblins, everything served in Neville's musical repertoire when it came to music, and he wasn't simply a receiver like Draco, for him it didn't matter if the guitar solo was good or if the drums were good to the beat of the lead singer's voice, or if the backing vocals sounded good. For Neville, music was a dance partner. Or just a pretext, to hell.
Draco doesn't expect anything else to put Neville aside and walk out of the teachers' lounge where Principal McGonagall came up with a back-to-school party or Merlin will know why.
"Do you know what is missing? If McGonagall brought in Granger to be the new headmistress, we'd have the Three Musketeers again!"
That is until he is finally in front of the door of the woman's office and this must be his record time in getting there so fast to the place, but he does not have time to breathe one last time because before he even considered knocking on the door, Minerva is already asking him to enter.
"I ran into him when I was coming back from Hogsmeade, my magic goes out of control when I have a cold and this time I appeared at the lake." Draco's puzzled gaze is on his body. Lucky for Longbottom. "Right at the worst moment my snot came out! A mucus! Like looking like if a centaur kicked me wasn't enough."
"Yes, yes, go ahead."
He reminded him of the Weasley twins, no bright red hair and such annoying behavior.
"Professor McGonagall told me you'd give us hangover potion and er..."
"Jerome was holding the two boys in the air. Gilbert was casting a spell, something akin to the cicatrix. No... I have no idea what he was doing."
"You kissed me, that night at the bar. And you know what? I didn't make a big fuss about it, yet I touch one of your cards and suddenly I'm the most self-centered and evil man in the world." Him picks up his coat and gloves from him before slamming the door out of the office. "See you in the new year, Malfoy."
Neville denies waving a hand in the air. Too busy wiping his nose with a tissue that he holds with his other hand. "I can go, I need some fresh air anyway."
"How were your holidays?" Draco asks when he's entering the great hall.
"Me too. I've known him since I was eleven! We hated each other ever since, did you forget?" Neville narrows his eyes. How to do it if it is all he repeats?
The reproaches are not long in coming, Jerome is furious and many boys are questioning them. Slytherin hasn't lost a single time since Draco started in command and to his pride it's best to keep things that way. Malfoy doesn't want to lose, but there are more important things.
"Professor Malfoy?" A voice called from the other side of the door, immediately recognizing him as one of his best potions students.
Would he have leaned into Quidditch? The Chudley Canons were always at the table in any discussion on the subject, there were even rumors about Potter being recruited to play the Caerphilly Catapults as a seeker, but turning them down for an Auror position in the ministry.
"You're a good friend."
Harry smiles at him from the end of the table, licks his dry lips, and shrugs.
The good astronomy tower was usually used by lovers to have some privacy, in years past it did not bring up good memories for Draco, but now he usually used it to observe the sky and smoke his pipe. Unfortunately, tonight he didn't have it with him.
"Well, All you need is a little help from a friend." Evan sings without worrying about singing correctly the song. Connor laughs.
Draco stays in position until he opens the door carelessly and frowns so hard he gets dizzy for a second.
Marlene shrugs, playing with the pile of Quidditch team bracelets she was carrying in her hands. "But the three of us knew that Lily loved James, she would have put a stop to him if she hadn't and when they worked together they were the best team, Sirius was jealous."
"I still don't see you tearing your eyelids off, Longbottom."
By Thursday of that week the waters seem to be much calmer; everyone was freaking out over the Hogsmeade outing next week and the loads of to-dos before the holidays. And of course, the long-awaited Gryffindor vs. Hufflepuff match for which Draco had been accompanying Neville to team practices despite the horrible freezing weather outside. Except for the days when he had to rehearse with the choir, of course. Haven would never forgive him if he canceled a choir rehearsal, and Draco couldn't afford to cancel either, much less now that they were entered into a contest.
"Yes!" he answers quickly. Clears throat. Disguise, as if this were not the consolation of your misery. "Uh, yeah. I mean, it sounds, like, super good and like that, it would be gre-
"Good Morning Class."
"What's going on? I can hear perfectly, Miss Haven."
"Harry, you came!"
"Agh! Fuck you."
"Thank you! By the way... it looks great, professor." The boy nods flushed and Neville can imagine Harry behind him covering his mouth to keep from laughing.
"Good evening, Professor Malfoy, I'm sure I know why you're here so let's avoid the fuss. Tea?"
Draco flops onto one of the benches, quite exhausted from mulling over unimportant things like "what color should the spheres be."
"Now you also suck, Potter."
Ron blushes and shrugs, looking away. "I had more mistakes than succes."
"Neville, are you here?"
There are times when you have to talk, and he wants to. Perhaps the function of a potion like Amortentia is to take courage. So take this moment and he takes courage.
A knock on the door makes his heart race in surprise. Who in their right mind knocks on a door at three thirty in the morning on a workday? He wasn't willing to find out because the person would leave as soon as he came to his senses and leave him alone. But the world hates the idea of leaving Draco Malfoy alone, and the blow returns this time safer and stronger.
"You'll be fine?"
"You'll see that it won't be like that, boy." Flitwick smiles at him one last time before saying goodbye.
"You don't understand."
(See the end of the chapter for
"If I had known you were coming, I would have prepared that barbecue that you like so much," says the girl, holding the order table against her chest.
Ernie nods with a smile and Neville walks with him towards the bar, leaving Draco alone with Harry Potter. The man looks around and Draco just waits for a reaction, a disgusted face or whatever now that Neville is gone. But there is nothing, not even when two boys walk into a bathroom and their intentions can be seen.
"We will start next week, you don't occupy Tuesdays and Thursdays after four because I hope to see you here."
"I found out about them, like officially and all, but I swear that squeaky bitch James already knew about it." Dorcas laughs and Draco's body is electrified by the joy of that laugh. "We went out into the muggle world to show these crib children what the world was like without magic. We lost Sirius, it turned out that he went on a motorcycle, and Pam! Remus ran to look for him, I think he could sniff it out or something like that because he always found him when he was given the chance to do a drama and he was hiding somewhere. But when we found them they were kissing behind a repair shop."
Draco shakes his head repeatedly, bringing the tips of his fingers to the bridge of his nose. Everything turns a thousand times. "I think they should be expelled. Sooner."
"Harry Potter in love with me?" he asks pointing at himself. Potter nods with a rather flushed smile and hiding under the palm of his hand. Draco does everything to hide the sound of his racing heart. "As incredible as it sounds, I'm not surprised. Who doesn't?" He jokes.
It's not a good kiss, it's just a lip smacking that leaves a metallic taste on it and he deduces that some blood was drawn from his lip, but he stays that way for a few seconds before being pushed away by Harry. The man's eyes are open like two huge moons, his glasses are crooked on the bridge of his nose, and his hair is a mess. More than normal. And Draco can only wonder how he did that in such a short time.
He's leaving.
"Just go get Connor, Evan."
"Oh, great, I learned a bit, do you have the necessary?" Draco slowly denies, "Draco?"
"For God's sake, Haven," Evan murmurs in the background, tugging at his blonde curls in exasperation.
He is ashamed of being a bad teacher and especially disappointed in his team. Annoyed at being an immature idiot who wasted his time thinking about Potter playing tricks on him as if they were still fourteen years old. He was an idiot who would never achieve anything. Not a steady relationship, not an apartment that wasn't depressing shit, not even a stupid worthless school mug.
Draco doesn't wait any longer to take long, heavy strides straight towards the students, he can hear the children following him, but for now he ignores them.
"A tracking potion is quite similar to a heart compass, it can be poured onto a piece of paper that will allow you to track a person," he explains. Now he's walking around the room glancing at his students. "Much simpler than a spell, yes, but less complex. It will only allow you to see a specific person and there should be a strong feeling towards that person. The so-called bond of union."
"Shit, and why is Potter there?"
Neville's gaze fell on Draco who was shivering instead, the man rolled his eyes and snorted.
Neville gives Draco his best serial killer look. "You look like a fucking mouse," Draco would have said given the chance.
He closes the door behind him, noticing immediately that there was a silencing spell in the room. Of course, McGonagall wasn't an idiot.
He's locked in the staff room with Weasley and Potter, and knows that they too are secretly hiding from the students who were taking advantage of the date to confess, and Harry had already suffered the havoc that morning, according to Weasley. He was about to give his Defense Against the Dark Arts class when a Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes rocket came in through the window and left an explosion of pink smoke that said "Professor, would you be my Valentine?" signed by a fifth year girl. "I've never seen Harry so upset, I guess the girl won't speak to him after that." Well, how much did you tell her, Potter? He wanted to ask, however he didn't because Harry still looked upset.
And if they were going to celebrate, they had to do it well, just as Salazar will say.
"Do I read it to you?" He asks and Harry nods, dropping into the spot next to Draco. "Good," he clears his throat. "Ron, it's a pleasure to greet you again, Cassie and I were in the same class as James and Lily, we were good friends with both, although more with Lily, I have to emphasize. Unfortunately Frank and Alice were a grade above us, so we didn't spend much time with them, sorry. To tell you about the exploits of the Potters in a letter would be a bit tragic, from what you mentioned, their son is with you, feel free to come with him to our house in Ireland, we'll tell you everything we know with pleasure, although we'll only be in Europe this week, we returned to Cassie's house in Puerto Rico. We also found out that Remus and Sirius had a son, send him our regards. We enclose the address, happy Valentine's Day."
Dorcas approaches her taking a seat next to Marlene putting an arm around her shoulders.
February, 2007.
Draco vomits and the last thing he remembers is the stupid lighting in that horrible bathroom.
"If that's your way of telling me you love me, that's fine." Draco clicks his tongue sarcastically. "If someone had told me that we would end up speaking like decent humans with no spells involved, I would not have believed it for a second."
"I don't like being the Hogwarts choir, we should have a more representative name, right? Like...
Is damn convenient, and his ass is freezing because they are in January and the snow still painting the ground with ice, and can not even stand up because they numbed his legs and arms and fingers, and everything that He wants is a cup of hot tea or a bath that sits as if sinking his body in lava, because no matter how many spells put on your tunic, never, it's going to be enough if there's snow through.
"Right." The woman pulls her half-moon glasses up the bridge of her nose and crosses her hands on the table. "I've known Miss Kingsley for a couple of years, and I'm think I want you to explain the situation to me without the girl's lengths."
Not that he liked Neville all the time. Sometimes he was too silly and sometimes too optimistic.
Connor laughs and doesn't know who is more excited.
"And you, Mr. Potter." The woman turns to look at him, pulling him out of his reverie. "It seems that you has the strange luck of being the one who brings your friends to the infirmary whenever you are here."
"I don't want to do it." Potter's voice is heard behind the door, he seems to be annoyed.
"Shit..."
Teddy soon appears at the door of the great dining room accompanied by Victoire Weasley, Neville sees out of the corner of his eye how Connor and Evan whisper to each other before they all yell a loud "surprise!" which causes Teddy to change his hair color from pale pink to bright red. A smile is drawn on his face when all his companions run to ruffle him hard.
Harry shakes his head and shrinks into place. "We are all a little foolish when we're kids. Ron and Hermione fought all the time."
Draco nodded, that explained the sudden happiness Teddy exuded even in potion classes, where he honestly sucked.
"Are you not the least bit upset?" Draco stops him by taking him by the arm. Neville denies with a smile.
"Fucking Merlin, Draco, shut your mouth." Draco responds with a laugh and Neville frowns in pain.
"Really? T-thank you." The woman returns with an album, she hands Harry three and he greets them with shaking hands. "You want to see?" He asks addressing him trying to integrate him into the conversation, Draco hesitates at first, but gets closer to see what he has to show him.
Draco then waits for the remainder of the week in the infirmary and Neville tells him that he and Harry were with him the entire time since the incident and forces him to eat to his limit. Pomfrey doesn't let anyone see Draco for his upcoming recovery and part of him is glad to know that his students have wanted to see him, but he also knows that he's not taking account of the Quidditch team and the idea is killing to him.
Seamus Finnigan arrives right next to Dean Thomas spilling some of the drinks he was carrying on a tray. Draco winces at the noisy man.
"At least I don't put my mouth in other people's mouths." That stops Draco,
The last time Draco saw a werewolf was at his parents' mansion during the war, when the dark lord recruited Fenrir Greyback and his entire pack to fight alongside him. The look the werewolf gave him still gave him nightmares and the strongest retching he's ever experienced. It was the gaze of an animal gazing at its prey, and years later he discovered that werewolves like Fenrir were capable of recognizing men like Draco.
"What the hell are you looking at?"
Dorcas and Marlene give each other a long look. "Malfoy? Like ... Lucius Malfoy?"
Harry then lowers his gaze slowly down his arm until it stays on his forearm. There's a strange grin on his face and Malfoy can't figure it out. Instinctively he reaches into that spot trying to hide his arm from Harry's gaze. Maybe there's a Death Eater to catch after all.*
"I like him. He's the beautiful guy I told you about, okay?" Neville whines before taking a breath. "I don't know what he's doing here because I haven't asked Hannah's herbalist for a job."
The night is long, as long as it can be once Principal McGonagall arrives and he explains the situation to her. The woman frowns moistening her lips with her tongue and she watches her student's parents attentively. She is clearly furious.
"I'm gay," Draco says.
"Punishments don't make people like them change," Draco mutters. He doesn't expect any of them to understand, but for some reason, the look Potter gives him is quite alarming. As if he knew everything that was going on in Draco's head.
"You are a bad listener." Neville denies it. "I didn't know you cared so much about the chorus. Even I didn't know you cared so much, especially," he says, resting his chin on the back of his chair. "However, I think they're looking for a new choir teacher, McGonagall loves these recreational things that keep the guys out of the adventure seeking attempts." Neville shrugs. Draco takes a step back, leaning his back against the wall next to the coffee table. They remain in a new silence until Neville suddenly straightens up as if Merlin had given him the answers to his doubts. "She could bring Myron Wagtail!"
"My head hurts, and your horrible voice at 120 decibels doesn't help me much."
"What did you do?" Harry changes the subject by grabbing the scissors from Neville's hands.
"You're right, eighty points less every time one of you uses the word 'fag' and when I run out of points, I will suspend you from the Quidditch tournament, I will not allow you to do that kind of stupid thing while Slytherin is in my charge."
The students are euphoric. Gryffindor is a screaming and banner mess with their house crest. Slytherin students have the same emotion, but they aren't that loud. Hufflepuff students talk to each other, don't pay much attention, and the Ravenclaws present are countable on their fingers. However, he's glad to see Connor for the first time in a match alongside Evan who sneaked away with his home.
And therein lies the fucking irony of life, Harry Potter, who went from being the most wonderful being, to the most petulant and hateful, had always been a damn angel among human garbage. The boy who defeated who should not be named, the boy who fought in a war they should never have lived through was here in front of him, Draco Malfoy, the stupid rich boy who let himself be branded as a Death Eater by asking him to be friends.
He leaves his robe on his chair and walks over to Christine Hemlett's cauldron to finish the potion of the day. Draco can see the tiredness in their eyes, but the hour is running out and the group runs away from the final conclusion. Nobody waits an extra second because they swear they had even packed their things.
Jerome shakes off Harry's hold as he strides out of the Great Hall in the direction of the Slytherin rooms, muttering curses. Gilbert wastes no time and follows him. Draco calms his breath as he turns to attend to Evan.
"And you? Why are you here?"
"Indeed, Professor Potter, those spells were used to torture prisoners in Azkaban two hundred years ago. It's quite alarming that a thirteen year old is using it."
"It's Halloween, Neville!" Potter answered eagerly. He had his plate full of goodies.
"The Beatles! Neville says with a chin full of chocolate. We love listening to my mother's old records at Christmas. He plays Paul and I play George, of course, sometimes Herms joins us and plays John. Harry doesn't sing and so he goes to play Ringo's drums."
"No! If he knows I said something, he will tell my parents."
"If you plan to talk about Quidditch, I'm going to ask you to withdraw from my class." Draco gets to the center of the room calling the attention of his students. They're silent and Draco smiles triumphantly. "Now, add goodwhelming carefully, just a spoonful, no more, no less, unless they want that we all suck as the gases of the Trolls."
"What was that?" Neville asks.
"What is he going to tell them to keep you so worried? Whatever you've done won't change their perception of you. You're a good boy."
Draco laughs.
The boys had no problem playing this way. The Princhester brothers were very good at playing as a team, they complemented each other so well that somehow their energy spread to the rest of the team. David blocked every quaffle Draco sent and Paris prevented a bludger from hitting her teammates at least six times.
But Neville is his friend and he hasn't said anything. He tells himself with a cool head, but you never know, and he's not one to go and yell that he likes men.
"Are you sure, Neville?" Harry looks at him doubtfully too tempted by his hero's heart. How lucky to have this man as a friend.
"What is your problem?" Harry stands up quite annoyed. His eyebrows clench tightly against the bridge of his nose. And that for some reason annoys Draco.
Jerome had the same profile as his father, he was an exact copy, with black hair and brown skin, however, his way of walking and even speaking were totally a reflection of his mother. He wondered for a moment if people saw in his family the same as he sees in the François.
"What?"
"I do not know, may be." It must not be more than eight o'clock at night, they are full of the banquet that was held to welcome the students who were returning from home. And the thing is, Draco doesn't know if he's like plants, or if his libido is broken. Maybe he's just an idiot who hopes to fall in love one day without sex, not because he is self-righteous and hopes to introduce him to his parents at a traditional magical wedding. "As Salazar commands," his father would say. Not because he expected to step on the corsages before taking it to bed, just ... he didn't want to.
Draco groans wearily and tousles his hair. A couple of strands fall across her forehead, but he doesn't even care anymore.
How is Ernie MacMillan supposed to realize that Neville Longbottom is the love of his life if they are always running into the worst moments? If there was no snot dripping from his nose, then it was sweat running down his forehead. There is no better aphrodisiac than body fluids, right?
Neville replied sipping his tea with a smile behind the cup.
Draco twists his lips in annoyance. "Nothing."
"Sugar?"
"That's what you have Potter here for, right?" Harry was sitting across the room near Professor Flitwick who was taking a nap. The man waved his wand as he read some scrolls that floated in the air and an enchanted pen signed each page he finished reading. Neville turned his gaze to his friend and his lips twisted.
The girl closes her eyes and sits in one of the chairs ignoring Draco's annoyance. "I aspire more than the Magic Wireless Network of Europe, sir. My boyfriend Almir says I have a future in America, even in Asia. Can you imagine me giving a concert in Mahoutokoro?"
He shrinks his shoulders. "That is why it is so complicated, without them accepting that their methods are inhumane we cannot progress in any direction."
Neville's eyes widen, then frowns.
"I can't say, he'll tell my family."
She nods twisting her mouth.
"Man, that sucks."
"You know Ron, he's proud of her." A new horde of letters arrives at Harry's desk, he whimpers, Neville even feels a little sorry for him. "I can help you with that when I get back."
"Yes? It seems to work."
"I just wanted to ask you for a partner change for your advanced potions class," he says. Draco looks at him surprised and puzzled.
Evan shrugs with a smile.
"Not." Draco mutters, looking away. Is it possible that he doesn't look like the fool who was abandoned the night before Christmas?
, as if he hadn't tried hard to do a tantrum to show him that yes,
"Because you were drunk and very unconscious. I think I should tell you that I tried absolutely nothing with you." Draco smiles much more relaxed, which infects Harry. "I was more worried that night that you would find out and be mad at me than I was about the fact that you had kissed me or whatever."
"Oh..." Neville says. "It'll be good to see they again, I haven't seen they since uh, I don't know. Time passes fast, I think."
Draco sees it in a muggle movie and it's funny because
"I-I didn't do it, Neville set you up to sleep... you were too drunk. I didn't see anything, sorry."
He never took care of anything at his house, and it's not like Draco was going to waste time decorating his apartment when he was the only one who lived there. No one would care if he didn't hang the stupid ornaments in his house.
"I was just going to say hi." Harry is still leaning against the door frame as if there is nothing better to do.
His body feels wet when he field of vision returns. Everything is dark, he can see the castle a little closer, and he realizes that he is on the lake.
"Mr. Malfoy, I understand your annoyance, but the power of Hogwarts is not entirely in my hands. However, I will see to it that I punish that pair."
"Don't fight." Draco separates them with a stern look and a flick of his finger that pulls them back. "Evan, don't tell your friends' secrets, and Edward, I'll ask you not to copy anyone's essay next time, you're too smart for those things."
"Ugh, don't even mention it, it was horrible, he must think I don't like him."
"For how long?"
"My face isn't funny, asshole," he says between stammers and his words drag too far.
"If you don't have a problem with missing a day off reading and signing reports, then an extra pair of hands wouldn't hurt." Potter smiles as he sits in the chair across from Draco's desk. He picks up a couple of folders and sets out to read everything. Draco mimics him, offers him tea and they work quietly for a couple of hours.
Wake up after what he feel was a long and heavy dream. The back of his head hurts and his mouth feels dry. He's lying on a stretcher in the infirmary with his head bandaged. Open his eyes with the clearest view. He meets Neville sitting to his left and looking away he finds Potter sitting in another chair with half his body on the stretcher beside him.
"Principal McGonagall called me," Harry explains.
"Just to confirm, Professor Malfoy. Were Messrs. Clearwater and François physically beating Messrs. McKinley and Henderson?" Draco denies in Minerva's direction. She has her long, bony fingers curled on the table as she sets her penetrating gaze on him.
"I didn't know they had this here," Draco mentions, wagging a finger in the air to point to the spot.
Be that as it may, he had an office and if he could avoid Harry as much as possible, he would use it even if he didn't have coffee or cookies on the table next to him.
Harry nods with a reassuring smile patting him on the shoulder. Draco is about to speak when Ernie appears from the crowd of people with a smile and Neville seems to tense up because, yes, Draco had to admit it, the boy looked good. He was wearing black jeans and a gray coat rolled up on his arms, which somehow gave him pale skin a bit of color.
"I'd better go see the director as soon as possible or else it'll be worse for me, shit..." Draco picks up his coat and briefcase in his arms and adjusts his neck because if he looks worse than he knows feels she will probably kick him. "Please go to your common rooms, we'll see you tomorrow."
"They obviously liked each other."
"I'm kicking you out of my house, and I'll advocate to get you kicked out of school as soon as possible. So go get your things and wait for your parents. I don't want to see you here another second."
The man turns around for good, and doesn't give Draco time for an answer. To Draco's torture, he doesn't feel any better after that, he just feels like an idiot trying to step forward, but only takes ten steps back trying.
"Uhm."
When did someone talk about seducing?
"I think you'll have to go out to Hogsmeade to buy some pepper potion." They are in the staff room. Harry has stacks of papers around him and the letters keep pouring in through the window.
"Thank you, professor, I hope I don't disappoint you."
"Nice to see you this sweet afternoon, Draco." Neville walks in and drops the stack of papers on Draco's desk. He raises an eyebrow and Neville grins at him before breaking the news.
"What!? Can not do that!"
The two of them stand up quickly shaking hands with Draco before saying goodbye to Harry. Finally an elf appears with a bottle of Lady Willembur's pomace and Draco is the first to help himself. It doesn't take long for him to start feeling the effect of alcohol on his body until a man sends him a drink.
"I have a couple of photos of them, one from the wedding and another couple from our student years. I'll give them to you."
"To my niece? No way, she's still a girl, go play dolls or old cats, at your age you should not think about that."
"Exactly! Isn't the Weasley girl playing for a professional team? It's more logical to bring her and not Potter's accomplice."
The last day of school isn't normal for anyone, much less for Draco who has to deliver a decorating plan to Principal McGonagall before dinner, and also needs to receive the list of students who will stay at Hogwarts during the holidays. All this while several owls fly through the halls dropping sweets canes on the heads of the unfortunate fool who's walking to their classes.
"No, Potter." He rolls his eyes in mock annoyance as a small voice in his head reminds him of the whole bar thing. "Actually... I'd like to talk to you first. Would you like a drink in the staff room?"
"We weren't doing well living together after the first three months," he sighed. "Seven months later we canceled the wedding and I decided it was best to end the relationship, she agreed."
They pay the bill, in the end they split it up and Harry makes a strange pout because "You will give us asylum tonight and I said I would pay", but Draco won't allow it, maybe another time, but this was some kind of party for Potter, I owed him after all the shit he'd said about his family when they were kids.
"Yes, why not?" Draco replies with a shrug because who is he to turn down a beer, especially if it's free.
"Tonks was great..."
"It was installed three years ago, I used to come here with Ron and Luna after work, it was more comfortable because outside… we attracted a lot of attention."
Draco's mind disconnects from the real world, which is normal when he's going through paperwork, but he curiously seems to be having a conversation with Neville; who is noteworthy, is wearing the most horrible Christmas sweater he has ever seen in his life. And Pansy particularly liked wearing the most hideous ugly sweaters, it was an essential part of her constant flirting with Aidan Lekser, a Ravenclaw senior.
Neville waved his arms in the air and wiggled his hips to the correct rhythm, shook his head from side to side and closed his eyes tightly feeling the music.
September, 2006
There are times and dates when one must be direct and sincere. Draco wasn't with Blaise. He hasn't been with anyone before, and he never talked about how he felt and how he wanted more than sex without commitment. He didn't speak of how he always wanted love and a relationship more than a long day of moaning and swaying with no other merit than to be that.
"You should join the choir." Draco tells them after finishing advanced classes.
"What the hell are you doing here, Potter?"
"What is a tracking potion?" Eileen Jefferson asks, raising his hand. Draco clicks his tongue and points at her sitting on his desk. He crosses his left leg and rolls up his shirt, but stops when he plans to lift his left sleeve.
"He's bad with alcohol," Harry says, looking at the cauldron. He doesn't make eye contact with Draco. "That's, it's generally more resistant. Professor Flitwick said he only had a glass of his smoke liquor."
He knocks on the door, two light knocks that deep down he hopes will not be heard.
October, 2006.
"Who gave it to you?" Kyle points to Fresia. "Is that true, Miss McKinnon?"
"You passed out, buddy," Neville whispers, his face troubled.
"So you expect me to let you continue in the choir?"
Draco is silent for a few seconds. One moment he is looking angry and the next he seems rather disappointed. His stomach churns.
"Whatever Kirley does, Barbary can do it in his sleep." Neville raises his hand to his chest in disgust and shakes his head with his eyes closed. Draco laughs and brings the coffee cup to his mouth.
"Why?" Harry bites his lip.
Draco can feel Harry dragging him into the men's room, and his body feels strangely light.
"We're going to behave, aren't we, Connor?" Teddy says in that shut up tone that they discover us, and while Draco is not stupid not to notice, he ignores them.
"I think they're ready for the next game."
Neville nods with a smile. Of course it was the great Hannah Abbott.
"What are you laughing idiot? It is not funny. Come here and help me."
"I'm not an amateur, and we can make up for the points we lost in class today." They both turn to watch Evan and Teddy fight over the microphone. Neville cackles before turning his attention to Draco again. "You look a lot more upset than me and it's not even your team."
"Why are you interested? Werewolves have an extremely dangerous rating according to Ministry records."
"Same for today, I guess. There's a new bar in Hogsmeade, they say it's quite... interesting."
Draco nods. He doesn't know if he should speak or if it is best to remain silent and say nothing.
Harry is waiting for him in the corridor, he's wearing a navy blue coat full of colorful patches that if he were someone else would look like a tramp, but since he's Potter, it makes him look like one of those Witch Weekly models. He is leaning against the wall chewing gum with the scent of tropical fruits, he knows it because it is his favorite flavor, from his favorite brand and in his favorite size, Buumblue Gumm tropical fruit gum, medium.
"Sir, Lupin, watch your language!"
He stands still looking at the ceiling of his room. Waiting for the dream to come back to him, he still remains quite awake.
He didn't think about it too much before daring to talk about Blaise.
