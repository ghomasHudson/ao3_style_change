Umbridge attended Potions when the fifth year Slytherin and Ravenclaw students, throughout the lesson. She scribbled down her notes, not saying a word as her pen flew over the parchment. Harry made an effort not to look at her, but when he did catch a sight of her through the corner of his eye, he thought that she reminded him of that gleeful reporter woman who had been fired for writing an article about Harry Potter last year. Harry couldn’t recall, but he thought her name might have been Rina Scooter.
She smiled weakly at him, “I suppose we have indeed learned that. I think I’ll talk to her a little later today, do… uh… do you mind coming with me? I would truly like the company.” She finally raised the tea cup to her lips and drank, feeling the warm and familiar tea heat her from the inside and out. It helped ease her headache slightly.
Harry informed the Head of his House of what had happened to him at Umbridge’s office, both with the truth serum and being persuaded against his will to show her his left inner forearm. The man did believe Harry as he could not only read his mind, but knew him to be truthful almost to a fault when it came to serious matters.
Together, the three friends began to discuss the American Mage War in the study room. Schoolwork helped Hermione feel better, and Harry learned that the upset in regards to the interruption had been temporary and fleeting, as he liked having Hermione around in normal circumstances. His comfort around Hermione hadn't actually changed because he was stressed and upset.
“So what was that thing about the club?” Teddy asked Harry when Hermione and Neville continued to discuss the changes in the book. “I didn’t quite understand that.”
To his great horror and confusion, when Potter spoke up, he did not agree to his begging, but instead he began talking about something different. Was it a test? Draco was so caught off guard by suddenly being the one to be asked questions that he had to take a moment to gather himself. He reached out and placed his hands on both sides of the unicorn cup, staring down into the brown liquid that was his tea, as he could not gather the courage to look at his old classmate.
“What the hell was I supposed to say, 'hi Draco surprise! I’m in love with you and by the way I’m bi'?” Harry was sounding belligerent, spitting like an angry cornered cat.
Taken aback by how strong Malfoy was, Harry slapped ineffectively at his hands. “Get off me, do you have any idea how long it took me to get all the creases out of this.” Hermione would be so proud of him, or rather would be once she'd finished admonishing him for deliberately prodding and provoking a less than sleepy dragon.
“I find baking relaxing and, well it’s not that different to potions so long as you follow the instructions carefully.” Draco takes a neat bite and wonders if the raspberry is a little too tart. Next sugar next time, he thinks.
“Harry Potter as I live and breathe,” she says while never taking her eyes from Draco’s face. Not for the first time he wishes his mouth didn’t run away from him after a second bottle (glass) of champagne.
Potter’s laugh is warm and Draco is almost disappointed at how he quickly cuts it off, as if he shouldn’t be letting his guard down. Potter, Draco thinks, should laugh more often; it suits him.
When Harry, fully sated and more than little sticky, was finally able to lift his head from Draco's shoulder, shining grey eyes met green. Draco looked thoroughly debauched, his fair hair dishevelled and sticking up all the place, a once pristine thousand galleon shirt hanging open to show off a smooth but mottled chest covered in already blooming bruises, trousers bunched around his ankles, lips swollen and plump.
Resisting the urge to fiddle with his shirt cuffs (or to make a quite possibly ill-advised run for the storage cupboard to skulk alongside the shop's resident spider until the coast was clear), Harry willed himself to remain exactly where he was. He was a grown man and a powerful wizard to boot, who could handle Malfoy and whatever insults he might throw Harry's way (although the tauntingly slow approach towards the counter - because once a sadistic bastard, always a sadistic bastard - was admittedly not doing much for Harry's blood pressure).
He looked at his friends, all loose-limbed and giggly and a wave of fondness filled his throat for a moment, making it hard to swallow. Pansy holding court and dressed tonight in a barely-there red silk slip dress always swore by a mojito, heavy on the rum, light on the soda water; Luna, the group’s self-crowned captain of chaos, loved anything sickly sweet and the pinker the better. Greg always chose a pina colada for reasons best known to himself. And Harry’s favourite was a negroni.
“Harry, you are being ridiculous. It’s not like you’re my mother or anything. I can date whoever I want. I'm nearly thirty years old."
“I think it’s very romantic,” Luna said dreamily, twirling a paper parasol in the air, happily oblivious to the full blast of a glare directed her way that would obliterate most people, leaving only a small pile of ash in their place, before Harry broke it off to fix his attention back on Draco who shuffled in his seat. Sometimes, when Harry’s focus was centred on him like that, it was almost too much to handle. His heartbeat accelerated fast and he hoped nobody could hear the way his heart was beating out of his chest.
Potter puts his hands on his hips which is not in the slightest bit hot. “You’re being completely ridiculous.”
Draco narrows his eyes. “Oh, don’t flatter yourself. As if I’d ever consider wasting my time having tragically vanilla sex with a straight man.” (He would, he really would.) “I was asking for your address, Potter, because if you think I’m going to risk using Tergeo on these,” and he points again to his boots, “you’re even more stupid than I thought.”
Potter chuckles and mutters something like ‘posh idiot’ under his breath before bestowing a toothy smile on the stupidly good-looking waiter who’s just appeared at their table, no doubt sensing an expensive order and a staggeringly large tip. Draco grinds his teeth.
Draco chooses to ignore him in favour of turning to shoot daggers at Pansy, who’s looking like all her Christmases have come at once. Luckily for her (short-term) survival the waiter returns bearing a tray filled with bottles and glasses. He’s greeted with whoops and cheers. Even Weasley seems to have perked up at the sight of neat alcohol.
“Honestly Ron, just try it rather than trying to stare it to death,” Hermione said fondly, giggling against his shoulder for a moment.
Young people today have no respect for their elders. “You’re being ridiculous, Draco, and behaving like a sulky teenager instead of a grown man. You can’t keep yourself barricaded in here, it’s stupid, and not conducive to making any money.” She makes a shooing gesture.
Once he’s gone Draco collapses back into his chair. It feels very quiet without Potter crowding him out. He stares at his champagne glass, throat tight with the sudden swell of emotions in his chest. He hates his life, he really does.
Draco blinked, turning to look at him. “What?”  He had no idea to what Harry was referring. Or to whom.
Malfoy had stiffened at the mention of Lucius Malfoy. Voice flat and low and altogether thrilling, he snarled, “say that again Potter.” Harry remembered now that Malfoy was always more dangerous when he was still and calm rather than acting all hysterical, and his inbuilt alarm system switched over from amber to red. Harry weighed up his options, aware all the time of a gaze threating to set him on fire.
Draco shoots him a glare. “Of course he’s bothering me, Blaise. I don’t want him constantly in my shop, people will start to think I’m up to no good, and he’s also – distracting in that uniform looking all…” He breaks off, unsure how to finish that sentence.
Pansy preens, the shameless hussy. “Why thank you Potter.” She gives him a twirl and Draco prays to the gods above that she chose to wear knickers else he and Potter risk being damaged for life. “I confess I didn’t have you down as a follower of fashion.” (She’s not the only one, Draco thinks sourly. His eyes have only just stopped watering after the atrocity he saw fit to wear to the Christmas Gala, involving far too much orange trim.) “Madame Coccinelle really surpassed herself if I say so myself.” One crimson-nailed finger trails a path from her throat down to where her decolletage begins, before tugging her neckline lower still; Potter makes a choking noise low in his throat and Pansy raises one perfectly sculpted eyebrow.
Something unpleasantly hot curls its way around Draco’s belly as he watches Potter sucking first one long finger clean of salt, and then another. He really should get going. He has a hungry cat to feed and he needs himself to eat something that’s less heavy on the grease and carbs.
Clearing his throat, he gestured at the money bags. "I’ll wait while you count it, that way we can both be sure the debt’s been paid. After all I’d really hate for you to have to take time out of your busy schedule to slum around Muggle London before next rent day.”
Draco thinks wistfully of the days when the only words Potter used were ‘er’ and ‘um’. He tries to wrestle back control by throwing Pansy under the nearest bus. “Well, Pansy always was easy with her affections.”
Malfoy made a sort of strangled noise as Harry shrugged off his coat to reveal a new pair of fitted trousers and navy dress shirt with the top two buttons left undone that had met with Hermione’s approval, or at least it did up until she got to the bottom of Harry’s sudden interest in all things sartorial, and then it was ‘oh Harry, no! Ron said but-’ And: ‘Harry, promise me you’re not stalking Draco again’. (Harry had frowned at that because well, it hadn’t actually technically been stalking because Malfoy had most definitely been up to no good.) But once he’d reassured Hermione that there was no stalking involved, just a bit of healthy and satisfying revenge, she’d ended up laughing softly and patting his cheek and making him promise to let her know how it went when they next met up for lunch.
Harry hmm hmmed. “If you say so. It’s just that not having heard a peep from you since you left me in my shop (all hot and bothered and untended-to, Harry doesn’t add) you’d forgive me for assuming that perhaps you’d forgotten. But I suppose that once you get to this sort of position in life,” pointing first at a hideous painting of what looked like a run over hedgehog and then tilting his head to examine the self-portrait of Malfoy that had surely done by a wounded hippogriff, “it’s terribly easy to not honour your word. To over promise and under deliver. You know, what with you being so terribly busy and so awfully important and all. Why do you only have one eye and half a nose?”
Draco had long accepted that his feelings for Harry was destined to be unreciprocated and had made his peace with it; it was enough that Harry was warm and fond and kind and funny, and that he’d been able to forgive Draco’s transgressions. Draco was content to bask in the glow that Harry generated, wherever he went, whoever he was with, soaking up whatever he was offered.
“Again with the swearing.” Potter’s tone is mild but his eyes are dancing with amusement and – something else Draco can’t’ quite parse. “Good to know.”
Harry glowered at him. “I’m ridiculous? You’re the one, Draco, who's taking a punt on someone who might lock you up in his cellar and keep you as some sort of sex slave.”
She offers him one of her rare genuine smiles. “Well, it would be rude to say no. I could call Blaise and see if he’s free to join us.”
“Deaf as well as stupid.” And there it was, the snide tone was back. “I asked, Potter, whether he made you scream?” Malfoy's elongated vowels were not doing Harry's belly any good at all; it felt uncomfortably hot and and filled with squirmy eels. And if that wasn’t embarrassing enough, his prick, now unhelpfully alert to the fact that Malfoy’s voice was having quite a powerful effect on Harry’s ability to breathe, was plumping up so quickly he wanted to die. He tried to will the worse timed erection of all time to subside but a soft exhalation Harry couldn't suppress put an unholy smile on Malfoy’s face. Leaning in again, his breath gusted against Harry's cheek. “And is that before or after he makes you beg?”
Blue eyes twinkled. “I’m not scaring you, am I?” he asked Draco. Draco was still a bit tongue-tied, unused to this sort of intense flirting, but managed to shake his head. Will beckoned Draco to lean further across the bar. “Yeah, I thought not. But by way of an apology, how about I make it up to you by shouting you a drink of your choice?”
“You might still be a child, Potter, but some of us have long since left the playground behind.” Draco picks up speed in an effort to shake off his shadow but Potter drops in to easily match Draco’s stride.
Harry hummed tunelessly and ostentatiously examined his nails as Malfoy continued to glower darkly until seemingly realising that it was a waste of energy and instead forced a thin smile onto his face that didn’t warm his eyes. “Forgive me, where are my manners. Perhaps I might offer you a drink while you wait?”
“But Harry, I don’t quite understand why you care that Draco’s trying to shut you out of his life. Hermione said the other night you were just doing this to get under his skin but it sounds to me as if…”
Pale blue eyes gaze at him. He feels very seen. “Harry. I hope you're not just playing around with Draco’s feelings. That would be very cruel and I know you’re not a cruel person."
It very quickly became apparent that Harry’s victory celebrations might have been a tad premature. “Interesting choice, Potter,” Malfoy said, oozing smug satisfaction. “Perhaps a little - lowbrow, if you don’t mind my saying.”
Harry dipped his head for a second, because he was damned if he was going to give Malfoy the satisfaction of seeing this pronouncement hit home, and then lifted his gaze. Not looking away from Malfoy, he rang up the old-fashioned cash register (his pride and joy) with a dramatic ting and slowly removed around fifty large velvet bags, bursting at the seams, feeling grateful, not for the first time, for Martha keeping her ear to the ground and sharing her gossipy titbits of local information over coffee and cake on Friday afternoons when trade was at its quietest.
“Wow.” Harry was silent for a moment. “I wish, I mean - I honestly had no idea. I really thought you hated me. ”
Draco, inwardly groaning as Pansy sits upright, tries to fend off his impending doom with a sharp kick to her shins. His aim is off if the way Potter winces and shifts uncomfortably is any indication.
Draco sighs. “To be honest I really haven’t got a clue what Potter’s playing at. To add to all his other eccentricities, he’s now become weirdly obsessed with Wilbur. And he’s driving Agatha mad.”
Fortunately, after what feels like several life times later, Potter finally stops torturing Draco and lets the robes drop to the floor in a soft puddle of fabric. Underneath he’s wearing what looks like a half decent pair of extremely snug fitting dark woollen trousers and a green dress shirt that fits just so. Draco makes a Herculean effort to drag his eyes away from Potter’s torso. He tuts and then worries he sounds like a prissy maiden aunt rather than a man in the prime of his life. “You can’t just leave your clothes lying there like that, Potter. I dread to think what your bedroom floor looks like if that’s how you treat your robes. Although it does help to explain why you always look so...” He flaps a hand in Potter's face.
Reaching for his satchel, Draco starts to make his excuses. “I’ve stayed out far too late. Thanks for the beer and the…” he waves his hand at the greasy plate. “But it’s time to call it a night.”
“Excuse me a moment.” Draco stalks dramatically into the galley kitchen. Agatha, blithely oblivious to her impending doom, is neatly folding a chiffon scarf and humming cheerfully to herself. “What on earth do you think you’re playing at?” he hisses, careful to keep his voice low to avoid being overheard – he wouldn’t put it beyond Potter to be listening in. “Potter’s a menace and we should be discouraging him from turning up here uninvited.”
“Pansy, I think we’ve had enough drama for one evening. Come back to mine for a nightcap and I can change out of these filthy clothes.”
He swallowed hard. And then, demonstrating what Hermione liked to not-so-fondly call his lack of impulse control, without ever taking his eyes off his prey Harry gave in to whatever the hell was happening and moved predatorily around the counter, never once removing his gaze from Malfoy. Malfoy, like all bullies, immediately dropped his confident demeanour in favour of one resembling deep alarm, a look that only grew with every step that Harry took towards him. He started to protest, "Potter, what the hell do you think you’re –?" but Harry was on him before he could get to the end of the sentence, growling, “don’t even think about it, Malfoy, don’t even think about running away,” and grasping both of Malfoy’s slender wrists in one hand. There was a short and unseemly skirmish, involving quite a lot of pushing and shoving and cursing before Malfoy twisted free and in one fluid movement somehow had Harry pinioned against the desk, his wet mouth pressing against the pulse fluttering in Harry’s throat.
Harry’s boxers were teal and decorated with mallard ducks. Luna’s taste in clothing and presents apparently remained as eccentric as ever.
Harry’s hand clenches around his fork. “I’m just having some fun messing with his head. That’s all.”
Draco sighs. He’s never going to find anyone to love, let alone fuck, either tonight or ever. “First, how many times do I have to tell you that I’m not in the market for a one-off in the gents so you’re completely wasting your time tonight if you think you’re going to set me up with anyone. And second, I thought the whole point of tonight was that we weren’t allowed to talk about Potter, or even mention his name, but perhaps I missed the memo.”
Immediately, Harry shakes his head, turning around. "No. Do you want me to make you some breakfast?"
"He wasn't your husband, Harry." Harry knows that. He never thought of Draco as his husband. He still can't think about being married to Draco. "And you could never have gone with him. No matter how much you miss your mother."
"Alright, Hermione. Let's hear it from your lips so we can actually understand it," Harry says, his words just barely slurred.
Harry's only in the kitchen for a moment before he hears footsteps and, expecting Hermione, he doesn't say anything.
Draco shakes his head, rubbing his temples as if he has a headache and they both recognize the action from when Draco has too many cases and not enough time. "Good to know you're just as similar here. Scrains are just a type of food. It doesn't matter. I don't know how to make them but I'm really craving one or eight now."
Abruptly, hours after it had started, the screams stop and before Ron can grab him, Harry's running up the stairs. "Draco!" he calls out, concerned, scared. What if something had happened?
"Does the prophecy exist here?" Ron asks, curious now about this. He's not sure that he believes Draco but he at least wants to know. And he decides to disregard his personal feelings (did Draco just say 'our' baby about Harry and Draco?) and approach this as he would any other case he'd been on.
"Because I am Draco, idiot. Merlin, obviously you need me or else you're completely lost, aren't you?" Draco snarks, crossing his arms over his chest, one hand immediately sliding down to rest against his stomach. It's something protective, something that Ron saw when Hermione was pregnant and he's intrigued by it.
Harry stares at him a long moment before shaking his head and turning to his best friend. "I really need some alcohol," he mutters. Ron thinks that he could use some himself and, after getting Draco a glass of water, he pours himself and Harry some firewhiskey.
"Well it's no surprise. We were idiots in my dimension too for a while. I mean, Lily thought that we'd-" the other Draco stops, looks between the two and purses his lips.
It was only a few days, really, and it felt like a lifetime since they were together so often. Harry hopes that he's alright. And then, he thinks about the fact that he misses him. Perhaps the Draco here is different. Perhaps he has every right to despise him.
Harry stares at the folder without opening it. He's hated Draco since the first time that he met him and it's only heightened since they graduated. Draco had everything that Harry could've ever hoped to have, a family who loved him, and he'd made the wrong choices.
Although Harry is awkward, Draco isn't. He takes the guest room as soon as he's there and Harry goes to bed soon after, knowing that he shouldn't have drank so much on a night that he had to work the next day. True to his thoughts, he has a hangover the next morning and can barely pull himself out of bed. He peeks into the guest room, finding Draco still there, still pregnant and thankfully still asleep. He leaves a note telling Draco to make himself at home, how to contact him and Apparates to work.
Draco comes up next to him, resting a hand on his back and it feels almost nice. It's comforting. It's the touch of somebody who loves him. Harry lets out a shaky breath. "I never knew her," Harry says because honestly, he has nothing else to say.
Draco lets out a surprised laugh at the question, nodding and he doesn't move his hand from Harry's back. "It took her a while. It took Sirius and Remus longer. I was that Slytherin boy with a father in Azkaban. But… they could see how much I love you, how much you love me. And, in Seventh Year, they were happy when we… got together. I have stories. Of you and your mother. Of stories that your mom's told me of her and your father. If you want to hear them."
Harry wasn’t sure where to look so he allowed his gaze to slide from Malfoy’s gleeful face down the length of his torso to – and, oh. Oh. Perhaps it wasn’t just Harry being – affected – by the conversation. Malfoy, sensing the direction of Harry’s eyes, snapped shut his mouth, folded his arms and re-crossed his legs but not before Harry caught a rather tempting glimpse of a distinct bulge that hadn’t been there earlier (not that Harry ever made a habit of ogling old school adversaries, no matter how they might look in expensive and well fitted trousers).
“Not so fast, Potter,” says Draco. He waggles one sparkly boot in Potter’s direction.  Potter goggles at it. “Your address if you don’t mind.” Draco knows perfectly well where Potter lives but he’s all about the dramatic effect so.
Draco is starting to suspect that appearances are deceptive and that beer is a lot stronger than it seems. The table is littered with empty glasses, and there’s a plate shining with grease and smears of what Potter tells him is tomato ketchup. His head feels like it’s filled with a swarm of angry bees.
Malfoy stilled as Harry stood up in order to wiggle his arse while fishing the invoice out of his trouser pocket (it took a while because they really were quite tight fitting and he was putting on quite the show). By the time he’d retrieved them with a triumphant ‘aha’, Malfoy’s cheekbones were pink-blushed. Harry wondered just how low the flush went.
Harry’s mouth salivated at the sight. He’d been single for close to a year because he’d be the first to admit that he found relationships - proper relationships - hard, and one-night stands neither interested nor satisfied him that much. In fact he’d pretty much accepted that falling in love was something that happened to other people and had made his peace with it so he took a moment to appreciate the irony of how it was Malfoy, the boy he’d been obsessed with since the age of eleven, shaking him out of his lethargy and tumbling him into a fiery pit of desire by dint of saying all those filthy things in that sinfully posh drawl of his.
“You could always just demand he desists.” Blaise lifts an eyebrow. “If – of course, he’s really bothering you. You seemed quite chummy that night in Mayfair.”
Harry wasn’t falling for that trick; he could only begin to imagine what an enraged Malfoy who was still smarting from Harry’s rudeness of last week might do to his drink behind his back.
Not for the first time since Potter’s barged his way back into Draco’s life, Draco has to subtly shift behind the counter and wish he’d worn looser fitting trousers.
Draco sinks back in his chair. “Well of course you are, Potter, it’s hard to forget the crimes you committed in the name of potion making. Top up?”
Draco still sometimes found it hard to reconcile Hermione Weasley Granger the legal hotshot with the Hermione Granger who had bonded with Pansy over their joint fixation with salacious celebrity gossip. His teenaged self would be pinching himself if he could have known how his adult self would be – of his own volition – friends with the Golden Trio and assorted disreputable hangers-on (Seamus, Dean and George Weasley to name but three off the top of head).
Harry hung his head, defeated. “I couldn’t stop thinking about you,” he whispered. “I wanted to spend all my time with you, not her. I always wanted-” His words faded off, his faced closed off making it impossible for Draco to read him. Luckily Draco was too busy spluttering in a mix of shock and disbelief to worry about this. “You absolutely prize idiot. That was – that was nearly three years ago. What the actual fuck?”
Will’s grin, all wide-eyed faux innocence, told Draco he was clearly a highly dangerous individual. “Come off it, Leo,” he scoffed, slapping him on the arm “as though I could scare off the clientele, even if I wanted to, let alone Blondie here.”
Luna chews carefully. “I’m not sure what’s going on with the two of you but I do know that Draco doesn’t like surprises, in fact he hates them. It's a hangover I expect from when Voldemort lived in the manor. What he does like is a sense of order and feeling like he’s in control, so you popping in and out of his life is only going to make him more closed off and defensive and not want to engage with you.
Harry tries not to wilt in his seat. “There’s nothing going on, Luna, honestly. I mean, it's not as if Malfoy and I could ever be anything other than.." He breaks off, suddenly feeling a little sick. Getting to his feet, he tries to smile at his friend but judging by the look on her face he's not sure he's pulled it off; even to him it feels much closer to a grimace. “I’m just popping to the gents, be right back.” Out of sight, he takes a few deep breaths and splashes some cold water on his face before entering one of the cubicles and pulling down the seat. He needs a couple of minutes and then he’ll be fine.
Wishing he’d worn his new woolly burgundy gloves because it’s a miserably cold evening, Draco trudges alongside Potter, unable to shake off an impending sense of how this is all a terrible mistake.
Draco grinds his teeth at how Potter’s mind leaps from one bizarre statement to another, like a drunken frog in search of the next lily pad although it certainly helps explain quite a lot about Potter’s pathetic academic record.
The kiss lasted a while. “Oh God,” Harry gasped. “More. Please.” And, beneath not quite steady hands: “Off, take it off, now.”
“Can't you read? We’re closed,” Draco calls out. “Stocktake in progress so will you just kindly fuck right off and leave my premises? I’d hate to have to call the aurors…Oh, wait a minute…”
He could have happily have spent hours, days, forever just exchanging languid kisses but but there were silk shirts to untuck, and form-fitting trousers to unfasten, so soon his questing fingers were occupied with undoing a thousand tiny shiny buttons (‘seriously Draco’) and (‘careful, this is from Savile Row you heathen’), and wrangling leather belts from silver buckles in order to chase down warm skin he needed to have beneath his hands. Draco’s hands came to settle gently on Harry’s waist.
Blaise, the complete and utter bastard, is Mr Conviviality as Weasley slinks over from goodness knows where, looking both appalled and bewildered in equal measure. For once, Draco feels some sympathy for how he must be feeling, which is a very odd sensation and not one he wishes to experience again any time soon.
been keeping a vague eye on the clientele, mainly because he knows Pansy’s like a dog with a bone and is unlikely to let him escape scot free tonight unless he at least pretends to play along. He’d spotted a man earlier on (or rather his rather fine behind) who’d then promptly vanished. But as Draco scans the room again, he spots the same man who’s now propped up at the bar chatting with the exceptionally handsome if too skinny mixologist. A careful up and under glance confirms Draco’s first impression was the right one; he’s very much his type. Dark haired. Broad shouldered. Form fitting trousers that showcase a firm rounded arse, a shirt that’s just the right side of tight and a tiny bit see-through. He looks to be tall, but not too tall because Draco always likes to have an inch or two on whoever he’s with.
As if he could read his mind Malfoy called out, “I’ll have an earl grey please if you’re making one. And maybe a biscuit or two.”
“What. The. Everlasting. Fuck. Are. You. Talking. About?” Draco’s voice had gone high and posh. “Do you mean to tell me-?”
“I broke up with Ginny because of you,” Harry finally muttered. When he flicked his eyes up to settle on Draco’s, there was an angry flush from his cheeks down to the bit of skin where his shirt had come undone.
They were properly shouting at each other now and someone flung open their window to tell them in no uncertain terms that they were bringing the neighbourhood into disrepute and would they kindly take their fight somewhere less exclusive. Adrenalin was surging through Draco.
The smile was more leer than cute now. Draco cursed his Malfoy genes as another wave of heat flushed over him.
Potter gnaws his lower lip and turns pleading green eyes on Pansy as though seeking clarification. She helpfully mouths ‘dry cleaning bill’ at him and Potter shoots Draco another incredulous look.
All of the fire and fight in him was extinguished, leaving Draco feeling small and deflated. He hated how he sounded, quiet and soft and a bit sad and vulnerable, but he had to ask, to be sure. And find some new friends while he was at it.
Draco sometimes wondered if he’d been cursed to spend his entire life inconveniently in love with Harry Potter, as some sort of punishment for being an entitled arse growing up. Life had been so much easier back then at Hogwarts, when they’d loathed each other in a wonderfully uncomplicated way rather than now, when they were close friends, their lives and friendships inextricably entwined. It was like he was being punished, over and over again, every single Friday night.
Harry spared a fraught moment to be grateful for the fact that if he wasn’t so busy having a meltdown about how he’d somehow managed to enter a war of one-upmanship with none other than Draco Malfoy about a fictional boyfriend and his sexual prowess, he’d have had more time to consider whether Malfoy speaking French was posh twattery at its finest or the hottest thing he’d ever heard.
Draco immediately bristled at his tone. “I don’t owe you anything. And I don’t see why not. He seemed keen and I’m single.”
Draco smirks. “Yes, thank you Potter, Mother found them in Dorchester.” He watches from beneath lowered lids as Potter takes a cautious sip and winces.
It’s past seven o’clock on a foggy Tuesday when Draco finally locks up the shop. It’s miserably damp and he’s looking forward to nothing more than an evening in the kitchen, a glass of the new Bordeaux that his mother had brought over last week and trying out the recipe for a new tarte aux framboises Greg’s recommended.
There’s a look on Potter’s face Draco can’t quite parse. He raises his eyebrows, mouth stupidly smirking. “Bit presumptuous of you, Malfoy, seeing as how you haven’t even asked me out to dinner yet but good to know the rumours were true about Slytherins being easy.”
Draco lifts his own cup to his mouth, his little finger crooked as he does so. It’s really delicious. “As eloquent as ever, Potter. Do pray continue with your insightful comments, although a tip from me. Judicious use of nouns and adjectives really can be most invaluable when constructing a whole sentence.”
“Cheeky fucking bastard,” Harry muttered but not quite under his breath because Malfoy stiffened at the words.
“What would your boyfriend think of you getting up close and personal with your arch nemesis, hmm? Do you think Justin might want to duel me at dawn for daring to steal Harry Potter from underneath his very nose?”
Harry finally pulled away, Draco whimpering at the loss of him until he received a lick and a suck to that sensitive bit of flesh beneath his ear. Being marked. The whimper turned all too quickly into an undignified moan. Harry smiled evilly, eyes crinkling at the corners and Draco huffed out a tiny laugh against Harry’s hair before nipping his earlobe in return. He heard a sharp intake of breath and made a mental note to repeat that as soon as humanly possible and see what other tantalising noises he could elicit from Harry.
Malfoy had been busy glaring daggers at Harry but now eyed him as though he’d taken leave of his senses. “What on earth are you talking about now?” he asked tersely.
He leaned back to admire Harry, whose face was heat flushed and Draco was suddenly harder than he’d been in years. Maybe since that time when he’d caught Harry coming out of the showers after a particularly gruelling quidditch match. That trail of dark hair and the most interesting bulge beneath an obscenely tiny towel had kept Draco fuelled with enough wank material to last him a life time.
Potter shoots him a pouty grin before poking at the biscuit selection with a calloused forefinger and selecting a particularly coconutty one. “Mmph,” he says around a mouthful, a small scattering of crumbs missing the plate and landing heaven only knows where. Draco shudders. “This is – er…” Potter catches Draco’s eye and tries to drag an adjective from what pretends to be his brain “Delicious. Really delicious. Are these from that new bakery in Diagon Alley, what’s it called?” He mulls it over for a second. “Ciel Et Terre?”
Malfoy seemed suddenly on edge, almost as though he was nervous, which made no sense whatsoever, but being one of life’s pleasers, Harry now felt obliged to accept, if for no other reason than to shut Malfoy up or they’d be here all night. “Fine, if you insist, then I’ll have a brandy, but just a small one.”
Harry carefully memorised the way Draco looked because he was never going to want to forget the results that judicious application of praise and tongue could achieve. The way Draco was hungrily running his eyes up and down Harry’s body made Harry suspect he might look equally as wrecked, only wearing slightly fewer clothes. Out of the corner of one eye he could see his boxers dangling from what he thought was possibly a floor lamp. The fact that an addition of a pair of pants improved its look spoke volumes for how ugly it was.
It seems so. “Birds nest hair tied up in a man bun?” Pansy supplies helpfully. “Stupid green eyes? I could go on. I mean you do…”
There’s a moment where Potter’s mouth quirks upwards but then he’s hanging his head in what Draco fervently hopes is shame. He’s quickly disavowed of this when after a few moments of fake penitence, a pair of dancing eyes lock onto Draco. “Sorry for being sick all over you,” he sing-songs before turning to Pansy. “Nice dress.”
“It’s so hot…” Harry whined, shaking his head. “It’s just morning and I’m already not looking forward to the day.”
“I do, and Narcissa has been taken hostage to assure the completion, if not the motivation of the task.” Severus gave Harry a highly authorial look, one which was displeased with his senseless blaming. “Thus, I cannot confess anything more than I have, even to you, Harry.”
Hermione’s hand was nothing like Tom’s though. It was warm and real, slim but not slender, slightly softer than Ron would have expected. It was baffling to think that he was holding the hand of the most capable witch of what was possibly generations, yet also just holding the hand of his friend.
Sirius began to fall, and he began to fall towards the vortex. Rabastan had not known that he could react as fast as he did. He leaped after the body of the man who had been his lover when he had nobody else, and he managed to crash into him, keeping him from falling into the spiraling, endless vortex. With his heart racing in his chest and tears already rolling down his cheeks, Rabastan turned Sirius’ over, searching for his face in the final, desperate hope that the man was still alive and that the green light had not been the killing curse but something else.
Last year when Umbridge had created a war between the Houses, Slytherin and Gryffindor had managed to punish one another enough to reach record low numbers for both Houses. Then they had both honed in on Ravenclaw to not let them win, which left Hufflepuff as the sole House unaffected by the House war. Thus, at the end of the year and to everyone’s great surprise, Hufflepuff was bewildered to find themselves with an untouched number of points, leaving them as the only one standing, a mountain amongst the shallow sea of other Houses’ points.
Draco didn’t have much problems convincing Sirius to let the two of them explore and take whatever clothes they wanted from both his own and Regulus’ old room. The distant cousins discussed the situation back and forth, not about the clothes, but rather about spending any time in that room, but Sirius’ couldn’t dismiss the arguments which Draco presented. He agreed, but he also made a long disclaimer about why his room was the way it was. A lot of his arguments had to do with the fact that he had been young and rebellious. They also learnt from Sirius that Remus had relocated Regulus’ old clothes into Sirius’ room, which meant that they wouldn’t have to search two different locations.
Then Lucius Malfoy himself turned against the Dark Lord and the Death Eaters for the sake of securing the safety of his son.
Harry’s hands were shaking as he committed to being as brutally honest as he possibly could in favor of telling the man what he needed to hear. This wasn’t Luna being bullied or Ron struggling to understand what he needed to do. This wasn’t Remus being worried that he wasn’t enough, or Draco needing reminders that his mistakes didn’t define him. Albus had a lifetime of regrets, all of which accumulated into a pain which a sixteen year old teenager was not really equipped to handle. Yet despite that, Harry continued on speaking, knowing that leaving the old wizard to his emotions would have been the same as rejecting Remus when he needed and asked for help. Harry simply couldn’t do that.
Judging by Albus’ smile, he was indeed consoling, rather than condescending. “I suppose that I can now finally joke with someone that I have lousy luck with my relationships, be it my partner or the relationship with my son.” He laughed merrily to himself, but it didn't appear fully sincere.
"I'm going to get some more water," he mutters, grabbing his still full cup and heading towards the kitchen, trying not to break down completely.
"I'll be right back," Harry promises, going to Floo Hermione. He can barely get words out before he's back in the guest bedroom, grasping Draco's hand and wincing at how hard the grip is. Although he's been trying not to think about it, about the fact that this is his baby, that Draco is his husband, at least in another life, now he thinks about it. Draco is alone and Harry doesn't like the thought. Harry wants to be next to him when Draco gives birth to their baby.
Now that he's alone, now that he has a moment to himself, a sober moment. Now that he realizes how real that this is, Harry can't help but feel some panic rising inside of him. This man in front of him is pregnant, apparently married to him. Yes, it's in another dimension but it's the age that they are. In another dimension, Harry is apparently happily married, is expecting a child.
Harry wouldn't be caught dead with the kind of bedhead that Draco has and then he realizes that Draco's probably seen him like that a hundred times. More since Draco had told them that they'd been married a few years at this point. It's weird to think about. And the biggest part is that in another world, he's seen Draco with the kind of bedhead that he has plenty of times before.
The other Draco shrugs when Draco doesn't bother to respond, rubbing his stomach in the way that Harry has come to know it as the baby kicking. He's almost ashamed to have realized that but Draco is more than happy to share progress with the pregnancy. Harry thinks that Draco misses his husband and so Harry doesn't try to stop it although he's embarrassed to respond to some of the news about the baby.
Fortunately, Draco doesn't say anything about the obvious sentence. "I know. She wants you to know that she's proud of you, though. That she loves you. That both she and your father loved you more than you can ever imagine. My mum loves me. I know that. But your mum looks at you… like you're her entire world. And you are. Your mother's a good woman."
"You stare at me while I sleep in my dimension too, you know," Draco says sleepily from the bed, rolling over to face Harry.
Barely sparing Ron a glance, Draco sighs. "Would I be here if it did? This is one of the only realities that I'm safe in. I enjoy my home. My home has scrains."
Within minutes, his house is teeming with Healers and Unspeakables and Hermione forces him out into the hallway, ignoring his protests. "I'll hold his hand, Harry, I promise," she says before slamming the door in his face.
Harry swallows, listening to Draco walk away really this time. By the time that Harry's calmed down enough to leave the kitchen, he sees that Hermione and Draco have left and the other Draco has gone to his room, the door closed. Harry looks down, smiling slightly and he thinks it is nice to have somebody who loves him.
"It alright, honey. That's how you always are. Like I said, hopeless without me," he says in a condescending voice.
It's a week before Draco and Hermione actually manage to make it over to Harry's house. Before the first evening is over, Harry is visited by the damn Minister of Magic himself, nodding along to all of the demands. They're given protection and an order to stay inside and Harry can't help but chuckle when Draco says that this isn't exactly the subtle way that he wanted to give birth. And that presents another problem. Male pregnancy hasn't been reported in hundreds of years in this dimension.
Although he knows that Draco went into his own room so that Harry can have his privacy, he knocks on the guest bedroom door before stepping inside when told he can enter.
"Okay." Draco nods, his hand finally falling from Harry's back and he turns to leave the kitchen. Harry can hear him stop a few steps away and turn back to him. "I know that you don't understand this but I love you. And it kills me to see you cry."
"I'm about a month away from giving birth, thank you. I'd appreciate it if you could stop ogling me," Draco responds with a frown, pulling his shirt a bit further down, making sure that his stomach is completely covered.
It's a Sunday when Harry wakes up to Draco screaming and he rushes to the guest bedroom, barely managing to get his glasses on and his wand in his hand.
Harry pushes the folder on his desk aside and stands up, going towards Draco's office. He doesn't bother knocking, simply steps inside. "So, you're attracted to me, are you?"
Draco tells Harry stories often, little bits that Lily or Remus or Sirius has shared with him or that were shared with Harry and Harry shared with Draco. It hurts just as much as Harry thought that it would but it also feels kind of incredible. Draco avoids telling stories of after James' death, telling Harry all about his parents and what kind of people that they were. Harry wishes so badly that he could've known them. Or even just one of them.
Although Harry isn't sure what he expects, it's not the utter amusement that's evident in Draco's eyes, a small smile curving on his lips. "Yeah, we hated each other at first too. I mean, how could I not hate Saint Potter?" Draco asks as the smile turns into more of a smirk. Harry thinks that the nickname sounds affectionate, though, much more affectionate than it had when Draco had said it to him in this world. "But eventually Harry's head deflated and I realized that he had a nice cock and-"
"Huh. And so, Harry really is the father? That's so weird. You two hate each other," Ron responds, his words a bit more slurred than Harry's are.
Harry chokes again and he can hear Draco do the same thing from the other side of the couch. He wants to look at Draco, to see if it's true but he's too embarrassed to do that.
Hermione meets him in the hallway, a grim look on her face and Harry feels his heart drop. He's not in love with the man. No, but he does feel a strong sense of friendship with him. He knows now why himself in another dimension is in love with Draco, even if he couldn't understand at first. What is Harry going to do in the other dimension alone if something happened to Draco?
Harry isn't sure if he wants to. It seems like the kind of thing that would sting more than it would help. "I'll think about it."
While Harry is relieved that nothing is wrong with Draco, he can't help but frown. He didn't even get a chance to say goodbye. He didn't get to see the baby.
Bartemius Crouch Junior wasn’t evil enough for this punishment to be just without a fair trial. In fact, he looked slightly related to Penny, especially now that his blonde hair was slightly more tended to. He could have been her bonier, slightly underfed cousin.
George blinked, feeling as if he had been doused in cold water, water which somehow appeared to chill him down to his skeleton. The world fell out of focus, the only thing he could really see was Teddy’s eyes, while the movement of the other’s lips were registered by his brain, but were too out of focus for him to really understand what he was seeing.
The young woman appeared to blush as she turned her attention towards the book, unable to respond to his statement as of currently. She pointed to the title, “look at this H, it was not this faded when I last read this book, it’s practically gone and much more faded than the other letters. So I opened it and over the following first pages, the faded letters spelled my name. I thought that I might be imagining it, but I continued to read and it truly was a message to me! From Narcissa!” Eagerness and relief mixed upon her face as she looked between the three gathered people.
As he had a habit of doing, before and after he was killed and resurrected, the Dark Lord reached for the body of the snake to pet her. However, he stopped when she hissed at him, warning him that he was not allowed to touch.
“And since you feel bad about it, you can simply apologise to her when you see her next.” Hermione continued on. “After all, asking her to not date him wouldn’t be fair to her.”
George had not been hurt badly in the battle, yet a stray spell had burnt his leg slightly, but he was recovering with minor care needed. He took Sirius’ death badly, as he blamed himself for having allowed the killing curse to reach him, despite the fact that the curse was not something which anyone but perhaps Dumbledore might have been able to deflect. George realised that he would likely not be able to complete his NEWTs that year, leading to him the understanding that he would be needing to retake them later. Yet he hardly cared.
“I’ll never call you anything but Lupin.” Goyle mumbled as he avoided Harry’s gaze. “You’ll never be Potter to me. I promise. And Teddy will never be whatever name he left behind.”
“Draco and Ginny.” Teddy chuckled. “They both started diving after the same Golden Snitch, and crashed into each other mid air.” When he saw Harry’s concerned expression, Teddy quickly added “in the beginning of the dive really, they barely managed to go into a dive before they collided.”
“He’s my brother, don’t you remember him from last year? We… Oh my Goblin, that was you! We turned you pink! You were the dog!” All thoughts about Fred were forgotten in the moment of remembrance, as he recalled that the former therapy dog had been turned pink last year during the winter holidays. George couldn’t believe that he had forgotten that Snuffles had been there.
The focus on Draco helped distract Harry from his grief of the loss of his dogfather. He missed the man, and he would often turn around and expect him to be there, although he was not. Harry would think that Sirius would be by the table, in his room, or sitting in the library. He expected to find him standing on the landing, or sneaking ice cream from the fridge. Even when he wasn’t thinking of him, or rather, when Harry allowed himself to not actively think of Sirius, he would appear in places where it had been natural for him to be. Although he was never there. He couldn’t be.
Harry gathered all his courage and then asked without managing to look at Colin’s face. “M-may I kiss you? Before you go? I… I feel like… I can do it now. For you. Uh, I mean, just for you…”
Sirius raised his hand and produced a collection of multi colored sparks from the palm. They formed into a miniature lion which roared without making a sound before disappearing as he closed his hand.
“How were they? Are they alright?” Lucius’s voice broke as he attempted to formulate himself through the worry and regret.
Work was just as boring and none-engaging as always, but Arthur pretended not to notice. The winter holidays and the new year always came with new cases of mages being, as Arthur liked to call the phenomenon, complete buffoons. Every year, there was an abundance of mages who simply could not help themselves but to make the most magical fire show in the entire world through the use of fireworks. Every year there were people to reprimand, payments to be issued for breaking the laws, and a collection of other things to sort out in regards to careless use of magic. It was hard, not very rewarding, and sometimes more work than it was worth.
“El appears to be both gentle and kind.” Harry slowly raised his head, looking up at the other man. “It is clear to me that he is, or at least was, emotionally intelligent, magically gifted. He most certainly cared about you in many ways. Yet as you said, I can’t exactly claim that my current view of him is objective, since you have already claimed that the memories might be beautified due to frequent visits. I think… I think I would have liked him if I had met him, had we been the same age. Maybe even… if I had met him today.”
Her question earned her a groan from Teddy, who didn’t particularly enjoy talking about his, or other people’s, futures.
“Thank you for lending me the book about ancient Persian potion brewing as well, it will be an interesting read. I would thank Potter for it, but he doesn’t appear too keen to speak with me at the moment.” Severus glanced upwards as well.
down upon her lap and stretched herself up somewhat. Harry had already seen her read it a few times, and it appeared that she had now taken to reading the newspaper backwards to try and find more enjoyment out of it.
“Alright,” he stated, the grin finally spreading over his lips. “Really, I’ll revel in any proof I get that you can take care of me, Draco.” It was a little closer to the type of bantering and insults they had thrown at one another in the past, except that it had an entirely different meaning. He was giving Draco a chance to step up and prove himself in that they could be friends, or more, he supposed he really had to give that at least one thought or two, but he primarily meant friends. Besides, there was no real proof that the other would want anything more than friendship and comfort, they were both in a pretty bad state, and hence pretty needy; Harry really didn’t want to assume anything.
“I’m coming!” Sirius yelled back and soon enough, he came sliding down his usual way, forcing Harry to quickly remove himself from the railing. Sirius landed and walked over to the door, peeked through the peephole, and opened the door to allow Draco to come inside.
Harry took a few deep breaths to steady himself. He then nodded, agreeing with the other man. “I know… but do you really think that he can forgive me?”
“Just turning around is fine,” Harry promised his date as his heart raced away within his chest. He hoped that he looked calmer than he felt.
“The snake? Narcissa said he wanted to, I’m not very surprised to hear that she is here. You can take the one from Sirius’ old room, then.” Remus concluded, giving them permission to enter the room which Sirius had forbidden them from.
All his worries came back to him not treating Colin right in return for being such a genuinely nice and caring person. Not that Colin was expecting, or demanding anything in return, but Harry was still uncertain about the fact that he was using him as a comfort, one he wasn’t sure he had the right to.
Even then, the same commands as those used in Harry Potter would not actually work out for such a narrative here.
“Master Malfoy, a pleasure to make your acquaintance.” Kreacher bowed, before staring at Draco with his giant eyes. “May Kreacher say that Master reminds so very much of his mother when she was his age?” The House Elf slowly and conscientiously voiced his thoughts.
Sirius laughed loudly in return, “fellow disappointment! To think the house didn’t fall with the both of us under the same noble roof.”
Professor Slughorn appeared more confused in return, “you thought I would refuse someone with excellent and outstanding grades in more than three subjects? Your OWLs were beyond impressive enough to admit you to the Slug Club. Of course, I suppose your name made it even less of a complex choice, but I do not pick my students based on merely their names, boys. I pick them based on performance.” He allowed his words to sink in before he leaned forward, studying them with his small yet intelligent eyes. “Now what is the real reason you wanted to be in the Slug Club? I know secret intentions when I see them, I have not been wrong about that. Did Albus put you up to anything?”
Remus was happy to learn yet again that Severus didn’t shy away from him, or perceived their relationship as a weakness enough to back away from it. They had already spoken about Severus’ interaction with the Dark Lord, Remus knew all about it, and the implications worried him. However, he was all the more uncomfortable with how evidently understanding Lord Voldmort was, and how patient he could be. It made Remus feel as if rather than allowing a blow to land, the golem of a man was withholding it for the sake of increasing the fear and pain of when the strike did come to connect in the future.
Both Ron and Teddy had thought it was a great idea and thus, they had happened to teach Dobby his new favorite joke, which consisted of exclaiming ‘revolution’ whenever he did something which a House Elf could not do, but which an elf could. That included riding a unicorn down the halls of the manor which had previously enslaved him.
“It was a complete accident. I am totally fine.” Chang let her go and smiled at her. “You said some things about your boyfriend, as well as something about a plant?”
“I shall.” Harry spoke with a bit more conviction than he had meant to, more or less raising his voice as he answered. When he realised just how loud his response had been, he felt his face heat with embarrassment.
Albus flinched at the final words, then, he gathered his strength and asked without allowing his voice to tremble. “Was it worth it?”
“Of course. It is not worth anything unless you are comfortable with the clothes as well.” Draco pushed the clothes back into the corner of the closet, where they wouldn’t be picked up by anyone for a long time.
“I’ve been wondering that too,” Colin nodded. “The older students keep on saying things like that they used to hang students up by their wrists in the dungeons.”
“And I will keep the contact between the Order of the Phoenix and Draco,” Harry spoke up in turn. “Together with Hermione and Neville, we’ll attempt to create Floo Powder, so that you both gain more time in your ventures but Draco doesn’t stop trying to fulfill his mission.”
“He would be useful in the kitchen and the arrangements, you may send him over as you please. I can make use of another set of hands.” Narcissa agreed without hesitation.
At the very least, Neville appeared much like normal and without any current mental problem. He kept himself happy and distracted by his duties of the Herbology Club, and he was managing well in the approaches of Professor Slughorn. He was there for Hermione when he could, but she didn’t appear to want to confide in him. Yet despite that, Neville was a welcome calm and point of stability in Harry’s life. Almost like Colin, but not quite as colorful of a distraction.
Harry noted that it was a little humorous to see Severus so out of his element with a mind he could not read in the least. Severus was at a loss for what the other man was speaking about. All he could do was blink slowly, waiting for his fellow Potions Master to begin making sense. It appeared entirely alien to the mind reader to not understand what was happening.
The ghost of a smile flickered over Severus’ lips, but it might have been an illusion from the shadows caused by the flames in the fireplace. “Assuredly,” he promised.
“I am,” Harry stifled a laugh as he reached out and placed his arms around Colin’s neck, smiling up at the slightly taller teenager. “I think I told you that I wanted it, but I wasn’t ready. I feel like I am now.”
When Pat didn’t answer, and remained by the door, pressing her herself against it as if she could keep Lavender from following her with her body, Chang turned back to her.
The voices of other students drifted towards them through the fog as other students who wished to be less crowded made their way towards the turning point of the carriages. Neither of the two friends paid them much mind as they began to discuss their respective summers.
“It’s not about me, I just can’t let you hurt yourself like this,” Colin leaned back against the stone fence, smiling softly at the person he was crushing on. “I told Hermione to not hurt herself by trying to replace the person she has feelings for with another. I can’t let you make that mistake simply because it would be in my actual interest to date you.”
Al smiled without an overly abundance of joy at him as Harry returned to his seat, wrestling with his emotions in regards to having found yet another similarity between himself and his birth parents' murderer.
George nodded along with the explanation. He didn’t need particular conviction to allow his brother to do whatever he wanted, but since he had been given the role of the one asking the questions, he continued to voice all his doubts. “But is that a guarantee that you will become happy if you marry?”
"Having role models who were teaching Regulus exactly how he would not want to behave, as it proved to go against all which they were meant to achieve, worked in its own sense. After all, his father had learnt to distance himself from his wife and children, since as long as Regulus could remember. Thus, Regulus took it as a sign of how to continuously live in a household with the Blacks."
Colin knew that he had done the right thing. He held his arms out and allowed his friend to hug him, to cling to him as Harry cried against his chest. That was likely not a chance which would come again, and Colin had most definitely blown it. Oh well, it was worth more to him to keep Harry safe than to allow him to hurt himself until he realised that his real feelings were for Draco.
Albus was allowed the peace of retirement at an age where most would have been long since retired. Harry would have wanted to personally speak to the old wizard about his feelings in regards to being fired, yet he had yet not had the chance. He had a suspicion that the old man would not have been too bothered with the arrangement, all things considered. There had been many times where the man appeared exhausted and hurt by his work. However, he was partly removed because the community no longer trusted or believed in him. As an icon, he had fallen, and practically been declared an old and raving madman for his attempts to prepare the British mage community for the return of the Dark Lord.
“...Sirius, may I ask you a question?” Harry suddenly remembered what he had come to ask Sirius about in the first place.
“It was rather convincing as a child…” Draco commented dryly as he crossed his arms over his chest, not quite comfortable with simply letting the topic slide.
“It could be protected by some manner of magic,” Al responded. “I truly do think that I should come with you.”
A young mage, older than eighteen but likely not past twenty, shook Peter’s hand as tears rolled down their face. “Thank you, thank you so much,” they sobbed, much to Peter’s slight discomfort. “If you hadn’t found us, my father likely would never have made it here. We would never have found the way when the Ministry stole everything from us.”
The son of a werewolf swallowed back his emotions as he looked directly into the eyes of the Dark Lord’s former teacher. The man was clearly not convinced still, but he was wavering as he was forced to see perspectives he had long denied to himself, things he could deny perfectly well as long as he wasn't challenged. “Sir, I have lost my best friend to this conflict. He’s being kept from even interacting with me these days, and I miss him more deeply than I have words to describe. With your help, we could be reunited again, but if you keep that memory from the world then I… We… I risk never hearing the voice of one of the most beloved people in my life again. Please, we’re asking for the past, present, and the future, not simply to hurt you.”
In order to get to the Department of Mysteries, the group of mages had to apparate to the main entrance floor of the Ministry building, as it was the only floor to which one could apparate. Any and every other part was protected from apparition and disapparition through the same or similar magic which protected Hogwarts from it. Thus, a great number of mages, led by a collection of Aurors leading the rest of them upwards, moved through the Ministry and towards the department in question.
He was considering asking Bill Weasley to help him with that problem, but then he would have to show him the pictures, as well as his old room. Sirius liked Bill well enough to want him to visit again, but he wasn’t sure he wanted it to be for such a reason as to remove Sirius’ old soft pornography off the walls of his teenage bedroom.
Harry shut his mouth and avoided her altogether, feeling ashamed over his evidently lacking snake manners.
While I do like the incentive of saving orphaned mages from a world without magic, I never imagined that it would mean that busy Hogwarts teachers like myself would be expected to go and hold inspirational talks with the orphaned children to try and convince them to lay low until they could come to Hogwarts. Telling a child that they are very special is never good for their ego. Yet it becomes ever worse when you ask them to keep how special they are hidden from their friends and bullies.
“Yeah, then you can let your own boyfriend in, and I don’t have to run up and down the house all the time.” Sirius agreed, nodding eagerly to show Remus that he supported the idea.
“Albus…” El stands up and approaches me, reaching for my hands but then thinks better of it before he grabs them.
Harry shrugged, “I’ve lived with it all my life. I don’t think it’s going to kill me. I mostly don’t even notice it at all.”
Harry thought he realised what the other man was doing, and he played along in what he hoped was a convincing way. He sighed as if dejected and then slowly stood up, “how inconvenient. I have yet to finish my tea. I’m terribly sorry to leave so early, sir, I would have liked to hear more about the reforms which you are likely to bring to our House.”
Harry shuddered at the recollection of the dementors in the woods. They had indeed been more of a direct danger to him and his friends than Remus had been.
Kreacher looked at Sirius then, his face an empty mask which revealed nothing but a slight disapproval or disgust. Sirius never knew which one motivated the creature the most. “Kreacher sees no Albus Dumbledore here. Without him present, Kreacher cannot trust Master Sirius with something so important.”
“Couldn’t that have waited…?” Sirius yawned as he rested his body against the doorframe. It creaked under his weight.
The fighting had come to a halt, if there was any chance to cross the room without being hit by something, it was now. Harry dashed across the floor of the teater, running as fast as he could. His movement caused the battle to continue but no spell managed to reach Harry as he more or less dived into the tunnel and continued to run, following Draco before he could engage the mad witch on his own.
“Oh, that is Hermione Granger,” Molly happily escaped her inner turmoil by allowing another topic to take precedence in her mind. “She is a Muggle-born witch, and Mrs. Malfoy is her patron.”
Draco managed to calm down from the unpleasant surprise of the wyvern’s brand new costume, and instructed his friends around the library in what they were allowed to touch and not. After making sure that everyone was engaged and the dogs were relaxing in front of the fireplace, and on top of Teddy’s feet in the case of one canine.
“Do you think you will become something simply because you’re staying around good old famous Harry Potter?” Someone in the group laughed, using the name which they likely thought that Harry disliked.
Thus, Pat was left alone in the dressing room, trembling with fear, anxiety and adrenaline. It appeared that two such miscellaneous items didn’t actually become the symbol of a Death Eater sympathiser to a reasonable person, who would only see the classical Slytherin snake and a somewhat bedazzled skull. Pat removed them and placed them in her locker. This time, she remembered locking it before she headed for the Quidditch arena.
The man who was not quite man any longer, slowly forced his aching, throbbing body to move, allowing him to sit up.
The Order was out of options, that much Remus knew. Professor Dumbledore had tried many ways in which to find a way to destroy the Dark Lord before the supposed assault and threat to the Malfoy family, and they were out of options. They couldn’t prolong it longer either, as Severus had witnessed that the Dark Lord had rushed Draco and decided upon a date sooner. It all felt crushingly hopeless, and beyond uncomfortable.
Molly smiled at her son, leaning her head to the side. She had appeared happier than George ever recalled since a few days back. He wondered if something had happened.
Percy recalled the mail in his hand, and he gingerly raised it to look through what people wanted from him. It was mostly commercial fliers, and some Ministry of Magic propaganda which Percy could cite with his eyes closed. Yet at the bottom of the pile, between the rent and a commercial about a new hair salon at Diagon Alley was a brown, inconspicuous letter. It had a clumsy wax seal upon it, stamped out with what appeared to be a spoon or perhaps the handle of a hammer. It smelled vaguely familiar, but it wasn’t until Percy saw the handwriting upon the envelope that he recognised it as one of the twins’ handwriting. Probably George, since it appeared as if the person writing couldn’t quite hold a quill. With his damaged hands, it was more likely than not George.
Luckily for them, finding Luna proved to be surprisingly easy as they met her in the stairs when she was on her way to the Room of Requirements. The group of three met up later in the entrance hall, and took a walk together in the cold evening. The air did wonders to Harry’s mind, even if he couldn’t quite shake the feelings of rage and anger towards how Umbridge had treated Hermione.
A flush of redness passed over Draco’s currently heart shaped face. “You… You… We had chosen for me to be the friend of Delacour since I speak French!” he objected.
“We will, sir,” Neville assured him as he stood up. “Guess there is no point waiting. Shall we leave?”
Professor Slughorn was evidently not impressed with the mention of Professor Snape. His displeasure was followed by a somewhat displeased answer, although the answer itself did not sound cruel. “Well, as a former Death Eater, I suppose he does have some rather limited, but nonetheless noteworthy good deeds performed in his life. Such as the Lycanthropy potion, as well as teaching the next generation, well… something of value. He has never expressed political opinions in the classroom, has he?”
“Have you captured a Squonk?” Luna asked with her big eyes focused on Harry from her position in the corner.
“I hesitate to ask this of you but I would like you to bring a message to them,” Lucius continued to speak. “A verbal one, as I do not want to write one down when it can be remembered and delivered verbally. Would you…” He stopped to swallow before continuing once more. “Would you kindly bring that message to Narcissa and Draco?”
Sirius licked his lips and averted his gaze, staring into an unoccupied corner before he slowly began to chew on his lower lip. After a while, he spoke up. “Logic fails me again,” before he attempted a successful trust fall onto Remus’ lap. “What are we eating today, Rem?”
The Lycan even left Pettigrew alone, but that might also be because Pettigrew had been removed to the Lestrange Estate. The other location suited the animagus far better as the Dark Lord did not quite have use for him at the moment, and could thus save him from Greyback. Neither did he have use for the Lestrange husbands, who had no interest in a war, but would take in the refugees which they could fit. It was all the same to the Dark Lord, as he understood that his followers needed to be safe before they could be rallied into war. He hadn’t been entirely certain that it would be possible to do what he had done almost twenty years ago, but Scrimgeour was practically doing the requiting for him.
“That still leaves a collection of classes who will need the ability to complete their OWLs and their NEWTs,” Professor Dumbledore spoke softly as he gestured for Harry and Draco to come inside the room. “And Hogwarts will need a teacher until then for the sake of those students. Now, as this meeting has dragged on for an excessive thirty minutes, I must attend to my other arrangements.”
Severus breathed in slowly through his nose, attempting to gather himself as his heart raced within his chest, making him feel slightly ill with the realisation that the Dark Lord could have chosen to kill him for his insolence, as well as for seeing a memory which the other did not want him to see, yet the Dark Lord did nothing and simply gave him permission to do as he pleased.
Neville appeared to notice her distress and so he lightly bumped her with his elbow. “Tell me about the book you have there. All of it, any of it. Tell me what you like and what you don’t like.” He smiled his reassuring, kind grin up at her, as he rested his head in his hand. “Or tell me nothing at all. I’m fine with that too.”
Colin considered his statement, nodding to himself. “That sounds true. You’re not so delusional as to be a stalker, or desperate enough to bend the truth to your liking, so I think you are right.”
“No need to sound so surprised, Pansy,” Draco muttered. “I’m not that much of a dating disaster.” He took care to not look at Harry as he spoke. Being horribly in love with Harry Potter since he was fifteen (um, maybe closer to thirteen) had been his best kept secret that not even his closest friend knew about, and Draco very much intended to keep it that way for the rest of his natural life.
Potter’s thoughtful look Draco’s way does something unpleasantly wobbly to his insides and he gives in to the urge and drops his head to the table for a moment while he rebuilds the spine he needs to get through the rest of this evening.
“Christ,” he says, dropping low in his seat. “Fucking hell, what’s he doing here?” Both Pansy and Blaise shift from loose limbed poses to being on high alert in an instant. Panic curls in Draco’s belly. “He’s coming over,” he hisses but has no time to explain what he means before Potter parades over to where they’re sitting and drops down uninvited in an empty seat. He’s carrying a yellow (really Potter, really?) drink garnished with what looks like an entire fruit platter, because the man has clearly learned nothing from his last encounter with cocktails of dubious colour and content.
“To making good on the promises you make,” Harry muttered, savouring the choking sound of brandy going down the wrong way. Once he'd regained his equilibrium, Harry watched with interest Malfoy's face run a gamut of expressions, from outrage to something darker. Harry’s insides coiled like molten ropes.
He snorts. “I’m confused is all. If you’ve been in a long-term relationship with Wilbur, why was Parkinson so keen to help you pull the other night – she said you’d had a messy breakup.” Potter studies Draco. “It’s just.” He shrugs. “I didn’t think you’d be the sort of person to two-time. I mean, six years, Malfoy. Jesus.”
“Jesus,” he says, clattering his cup back down on the saucer. “That’s just…Alright, yes, a biscuit would be lovely. Thank you.” Draco nudges the plate of raspberry and coconut shortbread across the table. If he says so himself this batch turned out particularly well. Firm yet still crumbly.
And even worse for the state of Draco’s heart, even in this advanced stage of inebriation, hair tousled (although he concedes that it always looks a mess so he could perhaps ignore that just this once), shirt crumpled, cigarette ash congealing in the corner of his mouth, Potter still looks like every wet dream Draco’s ever had. Reluctantly dragging his gaze away from Potter’s flat stomach, Draco examines a piece of damp newspaper stuck to the pavement.
Draco spins round. He opens his mouth, then closes it again. This happens several times before he’s able to speak. “Potter! Did nobody tell you that listening in on other people’s conversations is rude?”
“Morning, Malfoy,” Potter says cheerfully, and Draco looks up from his inventory before taking a sharp step backwards. There appears, unless he is very much mistaken, to be a – gecko – tangled in Potter’s more atrocious than usual (if such a thing was physically possible) hair.
Harry had just a few seconds to wonder if he’d made the right decision before his vision was filled with irate Malfoy, all sharp angles and eyes flashing with something impossible to process. Malfoy then proceeded to haul Harry out of his seat by the collar of his shirt.
Draco is going to fall out with Agatha before too much longer if she carries on like this. Potter’s call of “sounds delicious, make it two slices,” doesn’t make him feel any better.
"You're a hundred galleons short, Potter," he said loudly, and Harry marvelled at how calm and collected he sounded. "I'll call back on Monday. Please make sure that you have it, otherwise there will I fear be a price to pay. I'll see myself out. Good evening." A curt nod to Ron, all bobble hat and rosy-faced, and Malfoy disappeared, like a ghost, into the cold wintery night.
He’ll have one more fag and then call it quits for the night. Pansy can do perfectly well without him.
Draco licked his lips because he loved the hollow of Harry’s throat, so soft and kissable, and then the words registered with him. “What?” he yelped, incredulity flooding his voice. “What did you just say?”
Now it’s Draco’s turn to blink. “Not that it’s any of your business but Wilbur’s my fucking cat, you idiot.”
There’s a strange look on Potter’s face as he mumbles something about maybe seeing if Granger and Weasley fancy a nightcap so Draco assume he’s not all that drunk. Nodding briskly, he leaves him to the rest of his evening and strides home.
A month on into this odd détente and Potter’s now made himself very much at home. It’s a cold windy day and his cheeks are frost-pink and his all-over-the-place hair makes Draco want to run his fingers through it. Settled in his usual chair he’d looked very pleased with himself when Draco offered to make a pot of tea.
And Harry suddenly no longer cared that he was trapped in place by a man who’d once made his life an absolute misery. Malfoy’s heat soaked into his chest and Harry burned with the realisation that even now, he wanted more. Wanted Malfoy’s long fingers cupping his face, his hands gripping his wrists, warm mouth on his, his tongue driving him into oblivion.
Finally pulling away, with Harry’s mouth tracking him, Draco’s eyes were warm and serious for a second but then the look was replaced with a more familiar sparkle.
Neither man said anything for a moment, each taking the measure of the other. It had been a while since their paths last crossed at some ministry event or other, and other than a curt nod they’d not interacted that evening, Malfoy too busy looking down his long nose at the champagne, and Harry too preoccupied with the after-dinner speech he’d been conned into giving later on.
“You’re on. Give me five minutes to lock up. See you there, yeah? And mine’s a Guinness if you’re buying.”
“That’s really not necessary,” Draco demurred but Will shushed him. “My pleasure’s all mine, hot stuff,” he purred.
“I swear on my godfather’s life that this is absolutely the last time I let Luna choose for me.” Draco’s eyes flit for a moment from the street to Potter’s six pack, and then back down again. Potter gets to his feet. He looks a bit wobbly. “That last cocktail was so blue, Malfoy.” His brow furrows. “And I think it had pink sparkles in it.”  There’s an odd look forming on Potter’s face as he seemingly replays the earlier portion of his sordid evening and all the bad choices he’s made thus far – that or he is about to be sick again.
Malfoy steadied him, gripping his bicep. "Weasley," he hissed under his breath and for a man who just a moment ago had been tugging Harry’s hair and whispering profanities against his ear, his reaction was impressively seeker-fast. One minute he was making Harry both melt and be harder than a man in his late twenties should be in his place of work, the next he was gathering up and shrinking down the money bags, cool as a cucumber. Finishing up, he scribbled out a hasty invoice, and then turned to Harry, face an inscrutable mask, breathing impressively back under control, hair in place, coat buttons magically and strategically fastened to conceal his groin from prying eyes.
The atmosphere, thick enough now to cut with a knife, took Harry straight back to when they used to face each other on the quidditch pitch; red and gold versus green and silver. “I’ve come to collect what’s owed me.” Malfoy’s voice, deeper than Harry remembered yet still as drawling, was deliberately bland but Harry wasn't fooled for a second; he knew Malfoy must be relishing his new found position of power over his childhood rival.
He knows he’s being a bit short with his friends and that they’re only looking out for him but he’s had too much to drink and he’s so tired. Blaise lifts his glass in apology. “Consider my wrists slapped, Draco. My lips are sealed forthwith.”
Potter pouts and it’s not in the slightest bit endearing. “What? Oh, come on, Malfoy, it’s not late. Surely you’ve time for one more for the road.”
It was all there (well almost), but in sickles rather than galleons. The grin he didn't try to conceal on hearing Malfoy’s tiny huff of displeasure was equal parts triumph and pure defiance. He knew it was an act of pettiness that might come back to bite him on his arse but for now, getting anything over Malfoy was a win in Harry’s books.
Grinning as he and the chair came to a halt in front of him, Harry felt Malfoy tear his eyes away from the hole he was boring into the side of Harry’s head to glare instead at the money bags. Harry thought he could see him counting to five (slowly) under his breath. And then counting all over again.
“It’s a thin line Harry, a very thin line. And we've both done things we regret and need to talk about - just not now, if you agree.” Draco’s face brightened at Harry's nod. “Anyway. It turns out all it took to snag me a Potter was buying out old Harry Wetherington and becoming your landlord. If I’d known how easy it would be, I’d have done it years ago.”
“Do you have any idea how long – how long I’ve wanted this?” Draco’s words were panted out in tiny gusts of warm breath.
Malfoy looked livid. “Oh, here we go, Saint Potter, thinking you’re so much better than everyone else and that it’s perfectly fine to barge your way in here, lobbing insults every which way, like confetti. Well, I’d advise you to tread very carefully, because you really do not want to see what I’m capable of if provoked. And Dean Thomas painted that so.”
“Justin Finch-Fletchley,” he blurted out, and with that pronouncement, gone was the raised eyebrow, to be replaced with a tiny furrowing of a perplexed brow. Harry was just beginning to congratulate himself on a hard-won victory and had half come up with a joke about how frowning like that was a fast-track to wrinkles and crow's feet, when he caught the tail end of a blink-and-you-miss-it uptick of Malfoy’s mouth.
Another painful fifteen minutes later and Harry eventually cracked under the weight of silence and the sight of slim fingers and soft hair falling across a face that had no place looking that - pointy.
“Don’t let us stop you,” Blaise says lazily. “I can see at least three men who can’t take their eyes off your tits.” Pansy is wearing a barely-there emerald green silk slip dress that is riding up her thighs, leaving very little to the imagination; she looks down at her cleavage, a pleased expression on her face.
“No. I want to know why you’ve turned into Mr Frosty Knickers and have been ignoring me for the last month.”
He laughs, a warm soft sound. ‘The landlady really needs to rethink some of the names of her beers.”
Pansy, having faced Agatha’s wrath on more than one occasion, shudders and Draco smirks into his glass. For a tiny slip of a girl, Agatha can terrify even the bravest souls. Only yesterday she’d brandished (not without significant effort) a copy of ‘Mr Philpot’s Guide to Monster Hunting’ when Potter had breathed too heavily on one of the glass display cabinets. Draco had watched him dodge her aim with grim satisfaction.
There’s a long silence. Draco presses his ear against the door. He knows better than to think Potter will give up that easily. Sighing, he’s about to make his way back to the counter when Potter’s deep voice is joined by another, lighter one.
He tried to distract himself from how his body was betraying him. “Thanks Draco,” and tried not to notice the flush spread across Draco’s cheeks. “Apology accepted. And right back at you on the looks front. I mean. Jesus. You look like you’ve just stepped off the catwalk.” Draco preened, just a tiny bit. “And call me Harry. If we’re doing this, and I most sincerely hope we are, you need to drop ‘Potter’ from your lexicon.”
Five minutes later and Draco is staring down at his feet in disbelief as the man he’s been crushing on for close on a decade throws up all over his thousand galleon made-to-measure boots. Boots made from the finest, rarest dragonhide and buffed to such a high shine you can see your reflection in them.
There’s a moment or two of silence. “Quite the eventful night,” Pansy says, voice deliberately cool. Draco knows she’s holding back on his account. “Are you alright, darling?”
“Do I need to remind you what it says here?” Harry asked, the picture of innocence, wafting the piece of paper in front of Malfoy’s altogether too patrician nose.
He knows, he really does, that he should stop pestering Malfoy but the reactions he’s getting from the Slytherin are too delicious for him to be able to put a stop quite yet to his activities. He glances down at what’s next on his list.
Luckily Blaise is on hand to help out. Reaching for his glass, he looks amused. “Dashing and manly?” he offers.
Draco’s not really paying close attention to Agatha as she chatters on about Potter’s weird obsession with his cat, and bites down on a lemon crisp. Next time, he thinks, a little more zest and five minutes longer in the oven.
Draco deduced from the steady flow of complaints being muttered against a background of vigorous cocktail shaking about what a bloody disgrace it was that there was no beer on tap, and what the bloody hell was aromatic gin when it was at home, that Ron, for one, was determined to hate it with every bone of his body.
Draco wiped the slightly soppy look he knew was on his face and stirred his drink, careful to not make eye contact with Harry, whose eyes, he could feel, were still boring into him, hot and angry which was doing something uncomfortably deep in his belly. Like coils of molten steel.
When he can't keep them closed any longer without drawing attention to himself, Draco manfully ignores Pansy and Blaise who are, he can see out of the corner of his eye, watching his every move. He snorts inelegantly. “Hardly, Potter. More to the point, what the everlasting fuck is someone like you doing in a bar like this. Wouldn’t you feel more at home in a dive somewhere?” He’s rewarded with a complicated look Draco can’t quite make sense of, due in part at least, to the five glasses of champagne fizzing around his head. He thinks he catches ‘promotion,’ and ‘not my idea this time, I swear.’
talking, conscious that Potter’s eyes are now burning a hole in the side of his head. “So we’re here on the hunt for willing prey to warm his bed, but failing that, unwilling will do just as well.” She cackles like a demented hag.
Turning back to peruse the menu, Draco dithered over whether he was in the mood for champagne or sharp citrus. An over-the-top throat clearing rudely intruded into his musings but when Draco looked up with a glare it was to the sight of a pair of the deepest blue eyes he’d ever seen fixed on him and a dazzling smile showing off to fine advantage teeth that even Hermione’s parents would approve of.
However, watching Malfoy desperately trying to keep his rage under wraps made all the hard work of counting out those knuts and the schlep out here to the arse end of nowhere feel like time well spent. Malfoy was clearly seething and doing a very bad job of hiding it, but then he always had been a terrible actor.
Wilbur buts his head against Draco’s chin, as he lies on an overstuffed sofa listening to the sound of raindrop pattering against the window, trying to read but the words dance in front of his eyes.
Draco glances around the bar. It’s all tasteful dark wood floors, artfully distressed leather banquettes and solid silver buckets containing champagne on ice, and the pulsating dance floor is filled with young, impossibly beautiful people. Blaise has a glass filled with brandy between his hands and Pansy is busily eyeing her empty champagne flute. “We should be dancing,” she announces, tapping her scarlet lacquered talons along to the music.
A begging Draco was a Draco Harry could very much get to like a lot, he thought, as Draco went soft and pliant under him. The soft ‘uh uh uh’ when Harry tugged at his hair made Harry smile and wonder what other delicious noises he could pull from him.
She moves to rest her hand on his waist and he leans into her, her hair smelling faintly of citrus. He breathes deeply, not realising how wound up he’d been.
Draco’s finally taken a stand against Potter because it’s not doing his heart and nerves any good having Potter popping up unannounced all over the place, looking all – dark and brooding and a bit mean and moody. Which helps to explain the current thumping and banging that began just after nine o’clock this morning, accompanied by a string of really quite imaginative swearing. Draco’s charmed the sign so he knows it now says ‘If you can’t read this, a book shop is not for you. Try the toy store down the road.’
“What’s this?” Pansy asked, snatching up the coaster and then let out a gasp and clutched at a string of invisible pearls, the bloody drama queen. “No way, Draco. That guy.” She glanced over at the bar and Draco noticed that Harry turned his head as well, training his gaze on Will, who gave the table a cheery wave before mouthing ‘nice tits’. Pansy waved back. “That incredibly hot guy gave you his number.”
Draco narrows his eyes as Potter balances the champagne on a pretty wrought iron table before plopping gracelessly down on a garden chair. The glass closest to Draco wobbles precariously. Potter runs a finger underneath the collar of his robe before fiddling with the top button. Draco looks on in something approximating alarm as Potter proceeds to slowly pop open the top three jet buttons, eyes on Draco. An (un)welcome amount of naked flesh is slowly revealed.
“I second that.” Luna’s voice was gentle. The parasol was now tucked into one of the braids framing her face. “I think he’s probably an impoverished writer finishing his first novel. Or maybe an artist, living in a garret. Definitely someone who suffers for his art.”
Draco, mulling over the merits of assam versus darjeeling, raises his eyes to the heavens because he’s clearly being punished by every god who’s ever existed for that spur of the moment petty act of spite that resulted in him sending Potter that invoice (although in his defence, it had taken two rounds of intense deep cleaning to eradicate every last trace of glitter.)
But Draco’s not interested (never has been) in a quick shag in the loos. He wants far more than that, not that he’d ever admit to another living soul under threat of torture. He wants what any normal person wants. Love. Friendship. Adventures. Cosy nights in. Lots and lots and lots of quite outstanding sex. And the reason why this is just a pipe dream is because he wants one person in particular, has done in fact since he was sixteen (or maybe even younger, if pressed), which is why Draco knows he’s destined to die alone, his only company dusty books, vintage wine and fifteen cats. Because he’s in love with the one person who has always refused to give in to Draco. Who laughs at him when he complains about the second-rate champagne served not-quite-cold enough when their paths cross at dull ministry functions. Who calls him a posh prat and is unafraid of him. Who is always in his orbit but never comes quite close enough to be anything other than a casual acquaintance.
