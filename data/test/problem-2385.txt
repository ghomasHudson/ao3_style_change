A laugh. Voldemort had simply laughed at the scene that was unfolding in front of his eyes. People were crying; mourning the death of one they had defended so greatly.
eyes,' he explained to his friends. Hermione gave him a worrying look, placed a hand upon his shoulder. 'He's at the Ministry again, just like your father was, Ron!'
As Draco turned around again, Harry Potter didn't seem willing to let him leave. 'What about your clothes? They're all wet! Aren't you cold?' The words were followed by the sound of rustling fabric. Draco looked over his shoulder to find the boy's arm outstretched towards him; his black cloak with Hogwarts crest clutched in his hand for Draco to take.
other magic to interfere with the locket. I have chosen him for this task, and that's that,' Voldemort continued, and thereby finished another topic all together. 'Now, let's discuss something that truly matters...
, Harry.
Not understanding how Dumbledore could remain so calm at explaining the fact that he was about to die, Draco glanced from the man's hand to his calm eyes and back.
' she said before disappearing behind a portrait of a tall Witch with a purple cat by her side. Other girls also went into their rooms; portrait after portrait opened up to only be closed again after a second. When almost all the blue was drained from the cosy new room, Draco also retreated back to his room, closing the portrait of Raphael behind him.

, he told himself for the millionth time,
With her big blue eyes always pointed at the floor when in the presence of her master, Pibbly has never noticed his arm before.
Draco gave Harry a side-glance and noticed him doing the same. Maybe they both thought the ginger-haired boy had gone mad. ‘Perhaps you should have asked her to the ball first, Ron,' Draco said to him but it seemed to hit a nerve.
And that seemed to bring more Gryffindors into the game as well. '
'I see,' Draco managed to get out. He swallowed and pulled his dressing gown more closed again. Arms crossed over one another, he tried to break through the sudden awkwardness between them. '
Days seemed to pass like they lasted weeks at the Manor and Draco stayed in his room all day long; avoiding his mother and more conversations about what was right and what was wrong — or just about his father. Of course it was terribly boring and drove Draco mad, but the thought of going downstairs and having to face his mother again was enough to keep him in that boring room. His cheek still burned from that one slap she had given him; something Draco had never expected her to do. She hadn't acted like the mother he knew; the mother that would've cried because her husband was gone -- but would've seen the good in it.
Those words seemed to light a fire in Harry as the raven-haired boy came into action and made his way to the boy -- Hermione just quickly enough to grab Harry by his robes and keep him from strangling the boy to near-death.
'There's something on the floor,' Luna pointed out and bended through her knees to pick up something, then reached out the smallest golden item for Harry to take.
'It's so soft,' Harry whispered to him, making Draco grin. 'I've always wanted to touch it.'
'Because I still am a child!' Draco replied, shouted in his father's face as he pushed the man's hand away. 'So let me still be one! Protect me like a real father would do!'
Harry sighs and lifts his shoulders slightly. 'That's alright. It's only normal for you to be confused, I would be too.'
Without hesitation, Ron immediately sat himself down on one of the chairs and shoved a piece of bread into his mouth — his cheeks immediately bulging like that of a hamster. 'Thank you,' Hermione said to the man, seating herself as well and taking a slice of her own. Harry glanced at Draco, questioning wether he should eat some of the bread as well. Draco shrugged, sat himself down next to the others but didn't touch any of the food at all.
. Hermione frowned her eyebrows though, not entirely sure of what Draco had just told them. 'What do you mean, beasts?' she asked, curious.
, but Draco had heard them for what they really were; plans and rules to change
Yet, as that exact curse was about the leave her lips, another flash of red hit her from the back. She fell to the ground like a piece of stone, flat on her face with her black curls following behind. From the back of the room came Draco sauntering, taking his time while eyeing Bellatrix from the floor. Harry was confused to see Draco didn't seem to have a wand, and appeared to have casted the spell with his bare hands. Draco's parents looked at him in shock, in disbelief of what their son had done to a witch that was on their side. 'Draco—' his mother began, but her son hushed her by holding a finger to his lips.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
A little surprised by the immediate reaction, Draco blinked with his white eyelashes before nodding his head. A strange feeling then washed over Harry, as if a soft breeze had passed through his veins. It made him feel warm, and he slid up his sleeves a little. This immediately drew Draco's reaction, and in a blink of an eye the boy had moved himself over to Harry. "Harry!" he nearly shouted, bending a little through his knees as he grabbed for the boy's arm. "You should've told me you were hurt!"
but all the rooms look the same. At least we have a separate room like at Beauxbatons. You share rooms,
'Of course,' Harry replied, handing the shining piece of jewelry to Draco with a weak smile. 'We must go find Hermione immediately, she had the sword.' Draco nodded to his words, his eyes not even looking at the beautiful item in his hands. His gaze was casted through the arched window; staring at the heavy defense spells that were being casted around the castle — towards the skies and making every pastel color imaginable appear between the stars. It felt like they were trapped inside a large bubble, and it reminded Harry of a childhood he never had. Of a toy other kids played with and he never got to.
Draco placed his hand on the green locket at the mention of it, took a step backwards but didn't lose eye-contact with Harry. 'He's indeed not quite acting like himself,' Hermione replied.
,' Dumbledore concluded. 'That explains everything.'
'But — but your son-,'
And of course he
'I didn't tell you to leave,' he started. 'Just — get some sleep as well. Looks like you could use it.' The other boy indeed had dark circles from a lack of sleep around his eyes; his blond shoulder-length hair a greasy mess and clothes put on in a hurry. The strangest thing about him, though, was the fact that one of his eyes was as white as snow; something Draco had never seen before.
'Doesn't matter.
"But why? I've never shown that much interest in religion or anything!"
The fog around his head only grew thicker and made him extremely dizzy, his mind overwhelmed and his legs tremble.

was never planning on asking Cho. Cedric asked her, not me,' Harry explained, his finger pointing in the direction of the double doors. There Draco found Diggory talking to Cho Chang with a bright smile on his face, arms locked. 'And I wanted to apologize to you earlier and ask you to go with me, but then I heard from Ron that a Durmstrang boy asked you and that you said yes and—'
last?
" A chubby, tall boy from the same age as Harry slammed the door now shut again, a smirk on his face. "Did I hurt you, Potty?" The mocking voice went on, now followed by a little laugh.
'No, we aren't, mister Potter,' Slughorn replozd with frown eyebrows.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Suddenly he was in the water with Harry; watching him dive deeper and deeper. The charm was working just fine and Harry seemed to smile because of it. Why was the boy always smiling so much? But as Harry went even more deeper, the Lake grew darker as well. Its bottom came in sight and Harry's toes touched the muddy ground, eyes searching for something that wasn't there. There was only darkness around them and a single beam of daylight that shone upon Harry and his bubble. And then it happened; the bubble snapped. Harry started to panic as he swam back up as fast as he could — but he was too deep, the surface was too far. Draco tried to reach out for him but found that he had no hands, no arms, no body. He simply wasn't there physically; only a witness to an unintentional crime.
A meaningless waste of his life, that's what his work has become. Harry peers over the edge of his cubicle, catching a glimpse of red hair and then the look of a bored man. At least his best friend feels the same way about all this paperwork as he does. He sighs and drops himself back down on his chair, lifting his head up towards the ceiling and looking at the ugly, cool lights of the Auror Department.
was as well.
"I am unsure," the boy answered, his face actually set unsure as well. "I shall ask my brothers once I return."
which way he had to go. Perhaps it was a side-effect to the gillyweed. Large arches doomed up in front of him. He saw a few small hills covered with a kind of green moss, but as he neared them, he could see it weren't just hills; it were the Merpeople's houses. Everything was draped in a green light; casted upon the evil faces of a few of its inhabitants. Gold and silver, jewels and shiny stones; he saw them all on the bottom of the lake — but even when he just took a quick glance at them, he could already feel the presence of one of the village's Merpeople getting nearer.
' he whispered to Harry as he got pulled onto the dance floor again.
"You have for the past years though," Draco reasoned. A reasoning that sounded incredibly silly to Harry at that moment.
'Perhaps in another life,' Draco told him. 'When you're not a portrait.' Raphael seemed to agree on that as his cheeks turned their pale color again, and he gave Draco a nod. 'But I need a favor.'
The duo had left right that moment, leaving Draco behind in even more confusion than before. At least he now knew his suspicions had been right; Harry didn't want to be found. But
Draco's eyes immediately found Harry's as he turned a corner and walked towards the group of Champions and their dates. The boy was wearing bottle green robes that matched his eyes perfectly, even Draco could see that from afar. His hair wasn't as messy as usual but he slid a hand through it at the sight of Draco, messing it up to its usual disaster again. His lips were slightly parted and his eyes opened wide; almost as if he was awestruck by the sight of Draco, just as the girls had been. But apparently, everyone seemed to feel the same way, as they looked at him rather than at Fleur.
'There are different kinds.
'Draco,' a voice whispered. Draco frowned, but kept his eyes closed. His mother was twirling in front of his eyes; dancing to the wireless positioned in the corner of the breakfast room.
The most terrible feeling spread through his body as he felt the impact against his wings, his head hitting the ground. For a moment Draco was dazed, unsure of what had happened. Suddenly afraid, Draco folded his wings in, even though it was incredibly painful, and closed his eyes to take a moment for himself. He was sure he'd pushed Harry to the sidewalk, into safety — and he was sure his Mortal was alright. But himself… What had happened? Was he hurt? Why had the car been able to collide with him and not go right through him? Why—
as he stared at a cloud of foam that had appeared on the water's surface. 'I’m about to show you something I have never shown any other boy before. Beside from the twins, that is.’
With his wrist twisting in every direction possible, and his wand swinging from left to right, Draco tried to block three curses at the same time while trying not to trip over the various items the room held. Colors of the rainbow collided and sent off sparks brighter than any night's sky. Draco blocked an orange-colored curse and sent it off towards the ceiling, and to his surprise it came back down to transform into a giant snake of fire.
'It's never a good-bye,
'Harry,' Draco began. 'How can you say I'm still as beautiful as before when you don't even dare to look at them?'
'That's the Gryffindor table,' she finally replied. 'The table of the
' she called out to Hagrid, whom gave her a content smile in return.
Ron and Hermione joined their side only moments later; Hermione completely soaked like Draco and Ron a bit shocked by it all. 'Still can't believe they tied up four students to the bottom of a bloody lake,' he said. 'I'm glad it wasn't me.' Ron looked away for a few seconds, eyes a bit glassy as he probably thought about himself surrounded by scary Merpeople. He shivered and Hermione rolled her eyes because of it. 'Anyway, I brought your jumper so you can warm up a bit.'
and you might not like this
. And finally he gave in, unable to control himself any longer and looked.
Draco shook his head, smiling. '
The Healer swallowed. 'I-I don't know…' he muttered for a second time. 'I'll run some more tests this week but that's all that I can do. Once they return for the body I won't be able to do any more.' The man looked nervous and tired, probably utterly exhausted because of the case.
' Draco laughed a bit himself at Harry's slight stupidity.
Draco tried to avoid his eyes, looked away, but as Harry grabbed him by both wrists, it was hard not to look at the boy. '
In fury Umbridge rose from her seat, her plump self leaning closer to the man. Draco got surprised by it and had to hold a hand to his mouth not to let a gasp escape. 'Watch your words, mister Cuffe — you wouldn't want the Ministry to start involving itself with the Prophet, now would you?'
'Draco is safely at home, where he's supposed to be. Probably writing letters to James again,' Lucius told him. 'Pity I will have to tell him James won't be writing back.' Harry clenched his jaw at the man's words. How dared he use his own son as bait? Harry's mind didn't get it — he had never known the love of a real father but if his had been like Lucius; he found having non not even that bad. 'Now give me the prophecy!' the man demanded.
Ansel rolled his eyes and pointed them at the content of his page again. 'Just because
And it seemed to work; Harry's grip around Draco's arm loosened a bit and his frown disappeared. Draco desperately tried to read his eyes but Harry had them focused on the ground underneath their feet. 'Why would you? Nobody believes me, especially not the girls from your school or those Durmstrang students.'
It seemed to pain Hermione as she took a step back, looked at Ron in a worrying manner. 'It's not like we didn't want to, mate; they forbid us,' Ron explained. 'It's the Order that told us not to tell you anything.'
Passing through a set of double doors, Draco entered another large, open room with very little furniture inside. The lights were slightly dimmed and added to the gloomy atmosphere that hung in the air. In there he found a handful of other angels, more brothers of his, lounging around. They almost immediately laughed as well, shaking their heads. "You must feel
, had entered the tent. Draco recognized him from a few weeks ago; he had also been present at the Champions Selection but he hadn't paid any attention to the man back then. In his hands he clutched a small purple bag made out of silk, tightly closed with a silver ribbon. His eyes moved between the bag and the participants, then fell upon Dumbledore and drew the man's attention by coughing loudly. Dumbledore ended his conversation with Madame and shook Crouch's hand with the tiniest of smiles upon his lips. 'Shall we begin, professor?' the Ministry man asked.
“I'm sorry to say this but… you look
,' Draco then said. He finally realized something; something he hadn't thought of before but by seeing her so distressed and crying so much he suddenly saw it. Her words; had they been hers truly or words manipulated by a second party? Draco cursed himself on the spot for not realizing it sooner. 'He's here, isn't he?'
that he saw. The fog of panic then faded away a little, and his mind was quick to make out a person, a boy around his age, on the street. Skin as white as the snow around him, hair the same shade. Clothing an ethereal white too, from his silk shirt to his trousers. Barefoot.
Draco couldn't help but feel the slightest guilt well up in his stomach, but at the same time he knew it wasn't his fault. He had never done anything wrong but help Castor with something that had been his job
'Something wrong?' Draco asks him. He's not entirely sure why he asks Potter just that; the look could mean anything. A gut feeling, that's what it is.
Tall grasses were surrounding them, the wind whispering unknown words in their ears. The Burrow could still be seen from where they stood, the roof of the structure rising above all. He had drifted off again; searched for a calm and quiet place amidst all the chaos of having the entire Order at the Weasleys' their house. Nodding to Fleur's words, he rose and followed the girl dressed in blue.
… but also because I have to go home.'
at the same time. At least, so they thought. It had sent them spinning, flying, moving to another place like Harry knew only a Portkey could do.
With those words out, Fleur pushed Bill's hand away to wrap her arms around Draco's neck — almost throwing the blond off his chair.
Draco and he took it without a second thought. Harry's palm was sweaty and warm, but firm and reassuring at the same time. 'Aren't you mad at me anymore?' Harry asked.
Draco closed his eyes, looked away for only a second. As the room became brighter as Harry's eyes adjusted more to the darkness; he could see more and more tears roll down Draco's pearl skin. '
,' Draco said to Harry with a sigh.
, the French. 'I don't know… a cat, perhaps?' he guessed.
Bolting of their chairs, they clustered themselves around Draco's figure. "Who is it? Where does he live? Are you sure it's a
, would specially be grand. His eyes automatically stared at his door at the thought, the door where Draco had appeared and taken Harry away to Grimmauld Place for the first time.
!' he answered Harry, finally also answering the look of green. He had seen it from far away already; the boy's red Quidditch uniform. It had always stung him to see others in Quidditch robes he knew he would never wear. At Beauxbatons they wore ones in blue, gold, silver and white silk, and even though he had heard that the games were quite the sight, he never had gone to look at one. The girls had tried to convince him many times by many different ways, but Draco had always declined their invitations.
look until I tell you to," the boy explained calmly.
And so it was that Harry still had no plan B beside from the Bubble-Head charm. It was only a few more hours until he had to go the Lake's pier now. The dark void that was the Lake's water had become liquid again a week ago; but Harry knew it was still extremely cold. Draco had advised him to cast a warming charm before casting the Bubble-Head charm; it would save him from freezing to death. But the blond was nowhere to be seen, and it made Harry panic that everything they had planned would go wrong.
A grin appeared on the boy’s face. ‘Let me guess; you also chose to use the magical butterflies for Beauxbatons’ entrance in September then?’
With frown eyebrows Draco glanced at Harry who shrugged and let go of his hand. 'I'll be back soon; don't do anything stupid without me being able to witness it,' Draco told him; making the boy in red laugh.
Hunger could wait — knowing whom this man was couldn't.
But Draco always kept himself to walking — or even remaining seated. Why chase a girl he didn’t have feelings for? Why chase a heart that didn’t beat at the same pace?
'Why don't you give the boy some privacy, Hermione,' Seamus then interrupted. Harry could almost hear an angel sing in his ears at his words. 'He's also not asking you about your love life with that Krum fellow.'
. The girls and I use it every morning before our classes. It was really nice of Headmaster Dumbledore to provide us with it.’ Draco was still really thankful for being able to use such a beautiful room; it reminded him of the bathrooms they had at Beauxbatons — there they were smaller but just as elegant.
' because he thought it was my name, you complete idiot! It means '
… As if he suddenly ceased to exist. Nothing made sense no more, and he felt completely fine with it. Like drifting on a cloud — slowly away from reality and everything that defined the world he lived in.
He bumped into his friends again at another crossing, their eyes all staring at the looming clouds of smoke. The Death Eaters stole Harry's idea of throwing orbs and soon rows and rows of them fell down, making everyone run as fast as their legs could take them before falling down into yet another new mystery room.
Harry's eyes shot up directly to look at Draco's, first making eye contact with the French's lips before remembering their height difference again. ‘T-twins?’ he stuttered.
'So?' Harry repeated.
saving Draco once again. Oh, the pity in the boy's green eyes as he'd looked at Draco, sitting there with his hands cuffed, in his wrinkled black suit and with the face of someone who hadn't slept in over ten years. And as Draco'd sat there, listening to Potter defending him, he hadn't dared to lift his head and look into those green eyes displaying all that pity.
Before his mind followed up on his actions, he was already unbuttoning his robes. He couldn't help but feel Potter's eyes staring at his long fingers, taking off his clothes layer by layer. Draco never liked being watched while getting undressed, or while being naked. Back at Hogwarts he would never shower together with any of his roommates nor would he change clothing in the presence of a single soul. But here he was, stripping down to his bare flesh to show Potter what had become of the man he now felt pity for.
Soon enough they were greeted with the voice of Death Eaters, of whom Draco didn't even know their names, as they neared the drawing room; accepting the invitation of joining
glance before deeming him to be a vile child for life; unable to see any good in him no matter what he did.
. Without another word the woman then walked away, back towards her car which she'd hurriedly parked in the distance. She drove off without looking back, and Harry watched as the car left the street.
However, life went on, and Dumbledore had left Harry with a task that was more grand than he had ever expected it to be; he had to go on a horcrux-hunt in order to defeat Voldemort — to end the Wizarding World's misery. Of course he had explained this plan to Hermione and Ron as well as soon as he had felt strong enough; and his best friends had both insisted on coming alone. Neither of them would even think about letting Harry go by himself. They couldn't leave just yet, as they still had to plan things and Harry had to return to the Dursleys again wether he liked it or not
Doing just that, Draco sat down again and moved his chair a bit closer to Dumbledore's desk. '
Feeling worn-out, Draco lowered his other hand as well and nodded his head slowly. He then glanced over his shoulder at the others; most of them with tears in their eyes and the girls their heads resting on the boys their shoulders. 'It's all my fault,' he then said, whispered.
. Everything was slowly returning. Draco could hear the ripping of flesh again his ears — a macabre memory he had hoped to have lost. Accompanied by the cry of a boy — cries he couldn't recognize as his own yet they were. A nod followed, as he could remember what happened again.
This time it reached Harry's ears, and the boy quickly turned his head around to see Draco come running from behind a large pile. 'What's wrong?' he wanted to ask, but the words didn't even leave his lips. Behind his lover a giant flame rose, licking his heels and hissing fire in the form of a snake.
'I have no idea what you just said but sounds good to me,' Harry replied with another sigh and Draco gave him a last kiss before descending down the stairs, joining the partying crowd again.
, was the most terrible thing to overcome the boy out of all. He worried about Draco every second of the day; wondered what was happening to him and of course, wether he had survived the damage he had done. What would Voldemort do once he knew Draco hadn't completed the task he had been assigned to? Would he be mad? Or would he forgive him as he hadn't even been a decent member of the Death Eaters in the first place? Harry had no clue, and therefore worried even more.
Malfoy nods and stands up, avoiding Harry's eyes again. In complete silence he guides Harry back towards the entrance hall, to the giant wooden door with the peacock, the snake and the rose bushes.
I can't promise the next one will follow soon, but I'll try. I've also been writing a few other stories and saving them for future uploads, as I did have a lot of inspiration for other fics.
Harry followed his eyes to the mermaid and shook his head. 'Beside from them having a fin and living in the water; I have no clue.'

to say the least.
"Your special strength?"
'What were you reading?' Draco asked, swiftly letting his eyes go from Hermione to her book and back.
Green and blue eyes stare at his skin with great interest; their bodies a bit hunched over towards Draco's arm. The Weasel is the first to look away, pointing his oceanic eyes at Potter instead. “Mate, there's nothing wrong with his arm. Bet this git didn't get the same Mark as all the others,” he whispers to Potter, yet loud enough for Draco to hear.
A smile appeared on Harry's face. ‘No more fighting then.’
'I'll use the Dursleys' their last name as mine; I'm sure your owl will find me that way.' Draco spotted a little grin on the boy's lips that faded away at the thought of his Muggle family. He had heard awful stories about them from Harry and knew the boy had to return to their home in Little Whinging this summer again.
'And don't forget that we can always still go to Bulgaria, see if we can look into that case I told you about earlier. Maybe a change of location will do you good as well,' Harry tells Malfoy after a minute of silence. The other man just nods, eyes still focused on the tea cup.
A battle won. He had escaped from Voldemort with a dead body in his arms. Cheers were surrounding him as he returned to the grassy field in front of the maze. His knees hit the ground as he fell on top of Cedric’s body, clamped himself to it with dear life. Music burst around him and overpowered his own screaming and sobbing. His face felt wet and sticky as he pulled Cedric even closer to him, unwilling to let go.
'Don't act like you don't know; I can't
With a nod, Draco continued. 'He's one of them;
Hesitantly yet determined, Harry took a step forward.
A little surprised by that reaction Potter's smile disappears as well and he reaches out with his hand, taking Draco's in his again. The warmth fills Draco's inside and makes his cheeks flush ever so slightly.

. 'I just want you to know to not be afraid, Draco — and to trust me.'
'What happened?' Fleur asked, but Harry shook his head for he didn't even know himself.
Let me explain the direction I'm taking my fiction in! So what first started as a good old fourth year fic I'm now taking all the way to the last book; I believe that will be a lot of fun and interesting to read. I have decided to keep myself to the actual books a bit and therefore I'm giving Draco the task he has been given by Voldemort in the real books as well. I hope you guys like that idea and aren't too heart-broken that our elegant, beautiful Beauxbatons!Draco is being put under the pressure of this task. But not to worry; I'm totally making it my own, French Draco, version which you guys will love (hopefully!).
This is him. This is the one whom defeated my master.
A silence fell between them as they made their way through hallways and around a few corridors; basically going nowhere, Draco noticed. They weren't on their way to Gryffindor Tower nor to the carriage. It appeared that they were just aimlessly walking circles, as Draco noticed they passed the doors to the Great Hall again. 'Harry?' he asked. 'This is not the way to bed.'
He'll get better in a few days,' Hermione assured Draco. 'Ron, will you get some cold water from the river? Thanks.'

He watched her swallow and cross her arms over one another. 'It's not entirely the same though; I'm not helping Krum,' was her answer.

Draco gave him a nod as a thank-you and turned back towards the other portrait. ‘Françoise?’ At the call of her name, the mother immediately opened her eyes and took a look around to see whom it was that had awoken her. With frowned eyebrows she gave Draco a head-to-toe look before her face softened and the smallest of smiles appeared on her face.
'That means story, right?' Draco gave him a confirming nod. 'Hermione has this French book and I've been trying to learn a few French words ever since April, but — but that doesn't matter right now, does it?'
'Still, we should change as drying charms leave clothes a bit damp. And I'm not willing to wear these robes any second longer.' Hermione indeed looked a bit silly in the dark robes; they were nothing like Draco would ever imagine her in.
'Not on purpose,' Draco replied eventually, changing his words. He then swallowed and casted his eyes somewhere else but Hermione's intense stare or Harry's unconscious body. 'He didn't mean to hit me; he wanted to curse someone else.'
; their butterfly.’
Draco turned around, catching the boy still standing at the spot where Draco left him. '
, Harry thinks to himself.
'I thought minors weren't allowed to use magic outside of school?' Harry noted.
As he had lain down in bed, the other boys already filling their dorm with loud snores, his mind couldn't stop thinking about the next day. They had kept on practicing the Bubble-Head charm but the result still weren't where they had wanted them to be. With the Lake fully frozen for a few weeks since Christmas, they also had had to move to the Prefect's/Beauxbatons' bathroom to continue their try-outs. Beside from the Bubble-Head charm they had also tried out a few other things that they had found in books. But non of them had worked.
. He wasn't only bad at waiting, he also always worried wether he would like the surprise or not. And it was just that that happened.
Draco spelled his own hair dry as well and Harry could feel an invisible wind pass by as the spell hit him too. 'Guess you won't be needing that jumper anymore,' Harry said to him but Draco shook his head, clutched his arms to his chest.
I hope you haven't gotten tired of my beautiful Beauxbatons!Draco yet & thank you once again for all the loving comments! :) And we did it! We're officially over 100K words.

And to work they got. Hours later they were still seated at the same table they had claimed before, but this time it was covered with books on all the subjects they had to look into. So far they had found out about the Bubble-Head charm but Draco found it too risky for Harry to use it for the span of an hour; it could collapse at any moment if intervened by any of the living creatures of the lake. Beside, he wanted something more powerful for Harry. Something that would make him finish the task faster than the given hour. Hermione hadn't agreed on that; she found the Bubble-Head charm the ideal spell for Harry to use.
'It's not important… But Malfoy's case is. He's suffering from the same curse as Dolohov and probably all the other Death Eaters before they died.'
But the mention of the Dark Lord's name seemed to anger her even more. 'You and your silly talking,' she started. 'You must stop immediately with spreading rumors of his return! Now that I know you're here as well I will tell the Minister and he-'
Potter. It makes me feel uncomfortable...’
'But what if he doesn't? I can't tell him anything… I can't tell you anything,' Draco replied. Thoughts were racing through his head; memories of Harry and him mixed with the few fights they had multiplied by three times. What if he wouldn't be able to find a way to avoid his task? What if he would
Harry himself was wearing a normal black suit which a Muggle would wear, his hair a mess as usual and his glasses the only accessory the boy would ever need. 'Probably,' he replied, not even looking at the robes Draco held in his hands.
Draco raised an eyebrow. 'Do I look like a cat person to you?'

Almost immediately Dudley’s chubby fingers curled themselves around its rungs and his heavy figure crawled up at the speed of lightning. “
Those words changed something in the man. His expression changed from terrified to
Another glance at Draco, sitting there lifelessly and showing no affection nor emotion at all. 'I wonder wether that part of him is still there,' Harry replied. From what he saw, the current Draco wasn't interested in being kissed or hugged at all — simply seemed as if wanting to destroy everything around his very figure.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Draco had been by his side almost every day since the Yule Ball. Even if they had classes all day, they would still try to find each other in hallways and exchange looks while brushing hands as they passed by. Or when they stumbled upon each other alone, they would hide in a dark alcove and kiss each other until one of them ran out of breath. Harry had been late for many classes during those weeks, but had all waved it away with a smile. Of course he also hadn't been able to hide it away from his best friends any longer. Hermione grew more suspicious by the day and Ron just seemed utterly confused. He had told them in the first week of January, declaring his love for Draco and that he was still the same Harry as he had always been. Hermione had just sighed out of relief; she apparently had already known about their relationship and had been suspicious because she thought Harry was hiding something else. Ron hadn't known what to say at first but also kind of had felt it coming. In the end he just shrugged and said it didn't matter as long Harry was happy.
? Or show me?' Draco then asked, no longer able to contain his own curiosity. The headmaster sighed and placed his right hand on his desk. It looked black and coal-like; as if terribly burned above a great, magical fire. 'What has happened to your hand,
Draco gave Harry a side glance and then looked back at the exceptional duo in front of them. 'I could tell,' he lied. He hadn't seen Hagrid dance at all. 'Must be
Tonight was Slughorn's Christmas party, and even though Harry couldn't care less about it — Draco knew a lot of important Wizards and Witches would be there. 'I heard he even invited a vampire,' he told Harry as he pulled his Gryffindor jumper over his head, exchanged them for the beautiful robes he had missed wearing so greatly.
‘What about charms for you?’
It felt like something exploded in Draco’s brain at that moment. He finally dared to look into the boy's eyes, searching for the lie but they were an open book; reading that he was telling the truth. 'You— you wanted to ask me?' Draco pointed at himself and Harry nodded. 'But... whar about Cho Chang? Ron said—'
One last look into the boy's green eyes and Draco turned to leave him behind — but Harry pulled him back, wanting to press one last kiss against Draco's lips. It was already way too late and who knew who was still hanging around in the hallways. It wasn't as if he didn't want to be seen with Harry, but privacy had always been high on Draco's list. 'Meet me tomorrow by the lake,' he whispered to Harry after finally being released by the boy. 'And bring you invisibility cloak.'
Wanting to deny those words but unable to do so, Draco had no choice but to obey the boy and tuck his wand away in the inner pocket of his robes. 'What do you want?' he had asked. For whatever reason the boy had taken him to a private space to talk; Draco didn't know. But by the look on his face it seemed as if he wanted to discuss something.
because I was close to Little Whinging a few times.'
As they neared a small hill, Ron got hit by a hex, making him slow down a bit. It was a harmless spell that was only meant to stop him,
With all the power that was left inside his body and soul, he let the sword come down; right atop of the locket.
Malfoy. Deal?' Draco just grinned as well. 'What was it again that your portrait called you? Amor something?'
As Harry shook his head, they all turned around and ran away even faster — split up and all ran in another direction to fight a Death Eater of their own. Smoke rose from between the aisles, hands reached out to grab him by his clothes and tried to steal the prophecy from his hands, but Harry ran even faster and casted spells at those who dared to come closer. The reappearing figure of Lucius Malfoy kept demanding for the prophecy, kept reaching out a hand of his own for Harry to lay the orb in it each and every time
Lost observing the lone boy, he almost didn't notice Bartemius Crouch Sr.,
'Then let me rephrase it, my boy; why
he whispered back. 'Go to bed.'
'I see,' Draco replied and saw how Harry lost the fight and started sulking at the sight of his old potions book. And for the first time in weeks, Draco couldn't help but grin just the tiniest bit.
of England — not of France!' Draco had followed Madame Maxime to her chambers after breakfast and was now hysterically trying to reason with her. He wanted an explanation to why she was letting the pink devil involve herself with a school that wasn't even hers to rule over.
?’ Draco said but by Ron's squinting eyes, he knew it wasn't what he had wanted to hear.
'Just — just some thoughts,' Draco said as an excuse for his over-poetic self. Or for trying to be at least a little poetic.
A little smile couldn't be suppressed and Harry looked up at his friend who laughed with him, picked up his backpack and placed an arm around his shoulders. 'You're right, Ron,' Harry admitted. 'And we have a wedding to celebrate first, don't be?'
"Aren't your powers equally as strong as his then?" Harry now asked, simply out of curiosity and perhaps a growing fear towards Samael as well.
that just makes everything feel alright.’
Interest triggered, Draco crawled up from the ground — his limbs aching and bones cracking by the sudden movement. 'Want me to help translate a few things?' he proposed, and Hermione put on a bright smile.
Footsteps. Someone was descending the few steps to the cellar. Ron quickly extinguished their light, and they all waited side by side with their eyes casted upon the bars of the iron gated door. A dark figure appeared behind it, stood stiffly on the other side of the gate. Squinting his eyes a little, Harry took a few steps closer and quickly found it was Draco. He called out his name, arms already opened wide to hug the French through the bars — but the blond boy himself took a step backwards. With frowned eyebrows, Harry looked up at Draco in confusion. 'Draco?'
The two boys gave André a glare and then got shaken out of their little angry moment by a hoot announcing the arrival of owls. More hoots followed, and a barn owl appeared at the front; it's heart-shaped face proudly holding a letter in its beak. It flew to Draco with elegant fluttering of wings and landed on the golden post in front of him, the letter in its beak sealed with the Hogwarts crest. A smile appeared on Draco's face as he took it from his owl, opened it immediately to read what his dear Harry had to tell him this week.
Draco shrugs. A simple spell wouldn’t hurt him, right? He’s dying anyway; wether Potter casts stupid spells on him or not. He could at least try, couldn't he? Potter tried so hard himself already; flipping through that book all intensively and everything. Probably the first time in ages the man had made his brain work that hard.
Putting on eyes the size of lightbulbs, Draco moved to the edge of his seat. 'Fatal?
December didn't only mark the start of winter to most students, it also marked the twenty-five days there were left until the Yule Ball. There was not one student from any of the three school that hadn't mentioned it before. Rumors had been spread of a Yule Ball ever since the Triwizard Tournament had been announced, but nobody had known there actually would be one until Headmaster Dumbledore made his announcement.
Draco had introduced him to his friends, the girls from Beauxbatons, and they had been the sweetest angels he had ever met. They had embraced Harry into their little blue family as soon as he had entered the carriage, expecting an awkward atmosphere but getting pulled onto one of the sofas right away. Of course they had asked him a million questions and Harry had replied with a million of stuttering answers, but they approved of him almost immediately and seemed to be just as caring for Draco as Draco was for them. Blue had mixed with red as Draco had joined Harry at the Gryffindor table; now also calling Harry's friends his. They all seemed to love him and enjoy his snide remarks and eye-rolls the most of all. Even some of the Beauxbatons girls had wandered off to the Gryffindor after a while, leaving the Ravenclaws in a fool mood because of the change. But everyone had loved having the French girls at their table; especially the boys.
, you are coming with the lovely ladies,' Madame Maxime's voice then declared.
— D.M. —
,' Castor replied. '
And they weren't even mad about it; they put their arms to their sides, bowed deeply and took off to the castle again. Draco was surprised by such good manners and had often taken regret in sending them away. Only seven Durmstrang boys he found fit enough and therefore he could only please seven of the girls as well — but those whom didn't get a date from Durmstrang quickly found theirs amongst the Hogwarts students.
A nod follows from the blond, his grey eyes looking away for just a second. 'Our relationship…' he whispers, more to himself than to Harry. He follows Malfoy's eyes to the tea cup he made for him. He looks at it as if he hadn't noticed it was there before; eyes wide and lips parted a bit. Harry then feels a slight squeeze in his hands. 'And what is that to you, exactly?' Malfoy asks, his eyes still staring at the tea cup.
'He won't. And if he will; I've given

The snake was killed. Split into two.
The anger Draco had felt in his chest couldn't be controlled any longer. '
'That's not what I meant, Harry. We just — we can't be sure.'
He therefore let out a long, deep sigh. "But I never knew you were there… never
knows.'
‘That’s because Ron was being stupid the whole time, and she was probably afraid no-one would ask her if she didn’t accept Krum’s invitation. As soon as he’s gone, both her eyes will be on your ginger-haired friend again,' Draco assured him.
for you? We're doing this to defeat
With a kiss as an answer, Draco almost couldn't let go of Harry anymore. He wished every Gryffindor would just disappear so he could spend the night in Harry's warm four-poster bed, wrapped up in sheets of red with his lover dreaming by his side.
Draco snorted and let go. ‘Now don’t start exaggerating,
Dumbledore took another long stare in Harry's eyes before he let go and faced Madame Maxime. 'I think he's telling the truth, Madame. The Goblet's magic is too strong for a fourth-year to mess with,' he told her.
Harry sighed. 'He won't let me.' Already earlier that morning he had tried to take it off, and even during the night he had tried — but it almost seemed as if the locket could sense whenever Harry was going to try and take it away. Draco always protected the locket immediately or took a step back even before he
At night he felt the carriage slowly sweep from left to right with neighing horses in the background. The girls were deadly quiet; not a single sound was made and no footsteps were heard. But Draco couldn't contain himself from opening his door slightly and taking a peek outside; only to find the small passageway deserted. A yellow lamp flickered and swung from the ceiling; making grim shadows on other doors. Door closed and back pressed against his mattress again, he decided to get some sleep. Tomorrow would be a busy day; meeting new students, learning new culture and trying to swallow Scottish food.
. Madame Maxime had informed them that there was such a day coming up very soon; a day which allowed them to leave the Hogwarts premises and visit the nearby little village. Most of the girls hadn't been interested in visiting, they rather wished to stay in to study or gossip in the carriage's common room. Draco on the other hand really had wanted to visit the village, but had found no-one to go with him, which had made him simply disregard it. But with Harry walking in the direction of this
It startled Draco, which nearly made him drop the bird in his hands. He glanced at it; a peaceful expression on the little creature because of, what Draco hoped to be, a peaceful death. 'It isn't working!' Castor's anger for the dead bird had transformed itself into anger for the cabinet.
Both Hermione as Ron nodded their heads at Harry's words, but it didn't help Draco feel any better at all. '
'Alright, mate. I'll help you as well. But I'm doing it for
'From his eyes, yes. Or, from his snake's this time. I was the snake, you see — attacking Arthur.' Harry swallowed at those words, dropping his hand from stroking Draco's head. 'I was the one hurting him, and I couldn't do anything.'
"I can read minds, remember."
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
'You know; those boys from Durmstrang. Northern beasts, that they are.' With her question answered, Draco lifted his hand as a kind of good-bye and strode back to Fleur and her friends. They were talking with some Hogwarts students, including the boy with the yellow scarf that had put himself up as a candidate earlier. As he nearly reached their small group, he suddenly felt a tick on his shoulder. He turned around and got surprised by Harry Potter's face; his green eyes looking blue so close to the light of the Goblet.
Draco'd never expected anyone to stand up for him — to defend him in any way. He knew his mother's words were useless, and he didn't even consider his father's for one second.
You're waking up all the girls!' Draco gave him a vile look. His heart was racing again because of Raphael's loud voice. He didn't want any of the girls to hear their conversation.
,' the blond's name leaves his lips before he can even try to stop it.
The words were like a stab through his heart, his soul, his whole figure. He felt his knees weaken as he bolted forward — wanted to meet a Harry that was no more. But his knees gave in, made him fall to the ground. ‘No!’ he heard escape his mouth, but it didn’t sound like himself. It was a sound that could cut through stone. That made shivers run everyone's spine. His wand rolled out of his hand, got neglected somewhere between the mess the battle had left behind.
Was he surprised it had been reality and not a dream? Perhaps a little. But secretly Harry'd wished it had
?' Raphael asked, his voice full of concern. A sad look lingered upon the portrait's face, and the key's wings seemed to flutter less fervently than usual.
Harry nodded and tucked his hands a little deeper in his pockets. 'Yeah, I want to visit some shops. Get distracted from all the chaos for a moment. Clear my head.'
'Now we destroy these two, with this one,' he explained, pointing at the items. Bending forward, he picked up the sword and reached it out for Draco to take. There was still a bit of his blood visible on the silver blade; gleaming a bright red in the fire's light. Hesitantly, Draco took it by its handle and felt how heavy it actually was — no wonder it had been so hard for Harry to swim to the shore with it earlier. The boy then reached for the locket — its parseltongue whispers still upset and demanding. 'I believe,' he started, turning the locket around in his palm. 'That you should be the one to destroy it, Draco.'
'Headmaster Dumbledore and I went to
Harry's eyes were shining brightly all of the sudden; as if he had finally discovered why his lover had been acting so strange. Yet, it was for nothing as Draco shook his head. '
. 'Give it back, Dudley!'
'Did Draco—‘ Harry guessed, confusion himself as he touched the tule fabric and lace details of the dress.
'Cozy,' Draco answered in a simple word.
, Harry thought,
He heard voices whispering and footsteps nearing and turned himself to Cedric. 'We have to go,' he shouted at him, crawling up to his feet again as he searched for the Cup. 'Where is the cup?'
,” he spits out, biting his bottom lip with fury. What is
'There are no deeds as there's no-one who does them,' Umbridge interrupted the man again.
It all didn't matter to Draco; he had a task and it was weighing down upon his shoulders like nothing else had ever done before. Every fight he ever had had with Harry or every argument with his father couldn't compare to what he was experiencing now. He had been trying so hard for years and years to gain access to the good side; to switch sides and finally be away from the monster. But now he was caught in the monster's claws and unsure of how to escape.
Alright, it wasn't really the way they had expected it to go — and they were still in capture of the Snatchers their claws — but they were there. And maybe Draco was there as well.
But he had no time to go and ask her wether she had seen Draco or not; Crouch had put his wand against his throat and announced that it was time for the second task to begin. 'An hour the Champions will have to retrieve an item that has been stolen from them.' Harry's heart skipped a beat at his words. What was it that they had stolen from him? His invisibility cloak? His broom? He had no idea. 'If they fail to do so; they won't be granted with any points, which will be a disadvantage in the third and final task.'
, was the other student's name, and Harry immediately recognized him as the blond git from Slytherin that had hated him since day one. He was the son of a Pureblood family with high influence in the Wizarding World; his father held a high position at the Ministry and his Mother was known for writing Wizard-superiority articles for the Daily Prophet now and then. The boy always bullied younger students and loved to make fun of all the Weasleys; telling them how poor they were or how pathetic they looked with all their freckles and bright orange hair. Therefore Harry hated him as well; detested the little fellow to the core as he was truthfully evil. The tiny little feet that depicted Castor's walking way had stopped right in front of Draco's name; the two of them hovering close to each other and staying still before suddenly disappearing completely off the map. Had they entered a room which wasn't mentioned on the map at all, Harry wondered. And why was Draco meeting one of the most vile students of the entire school in the middle of the night?
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Harry couldn't help but grin himself, squeezing Draco's hand before letting it slide to his waist; to pull him even closer than he already was. Their noses touched, their breaths flowing into each other. 'I'm glad you here,' he whispered, his eyes closed again. 'I won't ever leave your side again.'
Malfoy blinks a few times with his eyes, then drops them a little. The gesture is followed by a slow nod and a push of the pale hand against the dark wood. The heavy door falls shut and Harry is left alone on the doorstep of the Manor, raindrops falling around him with a soft drop, drop, drop.
That was, as he had thought of it with a mind more clear, because his father had made him grow his hair long like his in the first place. The man had said that sons of the Malfoy line had always had long hair; that it defined their prestige and elegance. His mother had only said he should keep it long because it softened his pointy features, ones he got from her. But Draco wasn't like any of the previous Malfoys in his blood-line. He may have inherited the looks and the vain aspect of their lives, but he was so different in many other ways. So why couldn't he be different in the way he looked as well, then?
Putting on his shoes in the entryway and grabbing his bag from the closet under the stairs, Harry decided it was best to just walk to school a little earlier than to linger around. He wasn't going to be able to get anything edible from the kitchen anyway, and the longer he stayed, the more chance he had that Vernon or Dudley would annoy him once more. As the conversation from the kitchen slowly drifted into Harry's ears — once again about Dudley's outstanding school grades — he put on his coat.
Harry's smile grew wider. ‘You’re unbelievable, Draco.’
"Just turn around, close your eyes and do
Harry grinned at Draco's sleepy talking. 'Alright. I'll be Harry
. Brown eyes then reflected white — opening wide. Draco smiled softly, with a hint of melancholy. "Are you ready to go?" he asked the girl, reaching a hand out towards her.
, Draco thought to himself.
Hermione sighed and shrugged. 'I have no idea what's going on with him, Harry — but you have to admit he wasn't acting anywhere near normal, was he?'
"Oh, we do, Harry. We do. But imagine if you were tied to someone else for the rest of your life, spending each and every day with them and only having a few times a day where you would be separated. Not all angels can handle such a thing."
They stormed outside almost as fast as the objects had done, Draco demanding the goblin to follow him. To where, Draco didn't know as there seemed to be no way out without the use of a cart — a cart they had been thrown off earlier. With the sword still safely in Harry's hands, they continued their journey through the underground, following the way the goblin was leading them. Draco had demanded him to lead them to the exit; out of Gringotts — but it seemed as if the goblin was only taking them deeper.
Draco pushed Harry away from him, shocked by the woman's words. 'And you are?' he asked as he faced her with crossed arms.

'What about that table?' Draco asked the same Ravenclaw, a girl with blonde hair. He pointed at the table where the boy he had seen before was seated. She giggled at his accent, but Draco ignored it with a steel face — waited patiently for her to answer.
'I was also wondering if we could meet up again tomorrow? Been wanting to surprise you with something for quite a while now,' the boy then said.
DADA classes were taught in the West Wing of the castle; in a classroom Harry had made his own. The skeleton of a giant bird hung over his students their heads. To their left they could find a collection of golden snitches. To their right piles of books Draco had recommended Harry to keep there must they ever come in handy in his classes — they hadn’t yet, but who knew what the future would bring. His desk at the front was a mix of ungraded homework, peculiar items he wanted to show his students and a framed photograph of Draco — the picture Fleur Delacour had given him at Burrow a few years earlier. Young Draco still smiled brightly as if laughing at a stupid joke, and it reminded Harry of how much he truly loved the stubborn French to death.
Nothing made sense to Draco at that moment, but he stayed calm and composed while he thought things through; tried to figure it out. Meanwhile he sent fog Harry's way through his eyes; the best way to keep a mortal dazed and still. "You can see me?"
(See the end of the chapter for

Harry chuckled at Draco's words and shook his head, pushed his lover down again. 'No, silly; Snape's classroom's in the dungeon. He insisted on teaching me Occlumency that same night already. I know you told me it was a good thing to learn, but it certainly isn't from professor Snape.'
face still has to be invented.'
Harry takes a step into the entrance hall, closing the door behind him and then returning his eyes to Malfoy. He's standing by the stairs now, hands clutched in fists; one gloved in black leather and the other bare in its normal pale color. His back a little hunched, his eyes even more tired in the low light than before. A green shadow of a stained glass window hits his cheek slightly, and makes him look sick.
'Yes, what about it?' Harry replied to it.
'Then how do you recommend us to get there?' Ron asked.
'And because mister Malfoy hadn't told you anything about that fact?'
Draco bites his lip guiltily at the thought of waking his mother over nothing, and sending Pibbly off in the cold morning air to go do something he could’ve done himself. The thought makes him bite his lip even harder. Why should he feel bad about letting a house-elf do a house-elf thing? Isn't she there to do any task demanded by her Masters anyway? Draco shakes his head slowly. He shouldn’t think that way. Times have changed.
Curses had been fired. He had protected the ones he knew as much as he could. Victims had fallen — young wizards and witches giving their lives for one single boy. It had made tears well up in his eyes, but it had also made a fire burn brighter in his heart. He had used his wand in a way he had never used before — casting spells he had never tried before. One Death Eater after the other fell to their knees in front of him, were thrown into the air or were blasted through windows — glass shattering in front of his eyes into a million pieces.
Draco moved closer to her and hovered by the seat on the opposite side of the table. '
There was no hiding, they found out as Voldemort's next move was to break all the glass the atrium possessed — all the tiny windows from Ministry workers their offices shattering to pieces and raining down upon all of their heads. Harry looked at Draco whom was staring up at the rain of glass in slight shock — the sharp pieces only a few inches away. He threw himself on top of the boy to protect him, and felt a few shards stab him in the back before Dumbledore stopped them. Grey eyes stared in his with fright, Draco's lips saying
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Finally looking up into the boy's emerald eyes again, Draco tried to find anything that would point out wether Harry would lie about his answer, but as the boy answered with 'of course'; he couldn't spot any lies. Yet Draco was still worried the boy didn't understand truly what he was saying, what he was believing. Would he still care more about Draco being safe, being able to be with him than his dear headmaster Dumbledore?
Changed into warmer and more comfortable clothes, they set coarse to a nearby forest to disapparate to a place they
Always had Draco hoped he would visit another Wizarding School in his life — and he must admit that he had heard a lot of good things from Hogwarts. He might not be able to participate in the Tournament, but who knew what other great experiences were lying ahead of him; waiting for him to grab with both hands and devour.

As she lifted herself up to a sitting position, Draco sat down on her bed as well. ‘The first task; I know what it is.’
Draco let out a sigh. 'Then say the magic word, Harry.'
'Dumbledore?' Harry asked, suddenly confused. 'But I thought that Sirius—‘

different. And then there's Samael… you might know him as our fallen angel?" Harry nodded, though he had never heard about the name Samael before, but
With his eyes now staring right at Draco, their psychotic state returned, Draco tried to concentrate his mind on something else than Harry's questions. Singing a lullaby in his head and thinking of Beauxbatons' beauty at the same time — Draco desperately tried to ignore the fool taste of blood on his tongue and the rambling of words Harry was hoping for Draco to answer. As his heart suddenly skipped a beat — not of being with his beloved one, but of being cursed — Draco couldn't take it anymore.

Years have passed since that moment — the moment that he felt that he’d lost his freedom for good. And even now, he still hasn’t been able to regain it again. It remains lost.
Panic raced through his heart and mind as he searched the clearing for the fifth time; turning every
McGonagall basically pushed them towards a spot on the dance-floor where they stood frozen opposite each other. 'Well,' Draco then said. He wrapped his left arm around Harry's waist and pulled him closer to his chest. He could feel the rapid pace of Harry's heart as he had never been so close to the blond before. 'I guess I will lead?' His right hand intertwined with Harry's left as the music started and Draco guided him over the dance-floor.

Saturday meant casual-wear and Harry seemed to take that quite seriously; everything the boy wore was only invented to be comfortable. A pair of jeans that he probably owned for many years already and a simple black hoodie that was three sizes too large for his figure. Draco himself had exchanged his regular blue silk uniform with cape for a white button-down and tailored light-blue trousers to his waist, held up by suspenders. Topped off with a pale blue beret, he found himself being as casually dressed as he could be.
'Keep it?' she finished his sentence. '
Both Harry as Ron smiled brightly at Hermione's cleverness before getting fresh, casual clothes thrown in their arms and hurrying themselves out onto the busy street again. The adventure — the hunt — had finally begun. It was an unexpected start on an unexpected day, but it had started wether they liked it or not. They were maybe going to have to change location every week, perhaps every day to stay safe — but it was a mission that had to be done, that had to be completed in order for their loved ones to survive and live on.
but not worthy of their attention. A bit hesitant he made his way around the crowd, finding a vacant table and chairs somewhere in the corner of the pub. As he sat himself down, a Wizard beside him gave him a vile head-to-toe glare before returning to his conversation. Another dingy looking Wizard passed by his table, giving him a bright smile of rotten teeth before joining a few others at another table. It all gave Draco the creeps and he gave himself a reminder to wash himself extra thoroughly when he would return, just to make sure no weird bacteria had crept upon him during his stay.
, he thought as he kept staring around him at the deserted landscape of Hogwarts. The sky looked whiter than usual; snow would soon start to fall. Draco tucked his hands away in his coat's pockets, a blue one that was a shade darker than his normal blue attire. He had forgotten his wand as he had left the carriage in such a hurry; making him unable to cast a warming charm. He could cast a wandless one but it had to be refreshed every few minutes in order to keep it working. Just thinking about all the effort made Draco already wince.
' she mumbled as she rose from her sofa. As she walked towards the portrait of her room, she threw the smallest of smiles in Draco's direction before disappearing, leaving Draco with a warm feeling in his chest.
And every night since that day, he would dream about the terrible pain he felt and about the mistake he made.
They arrive at the atrium and take a sprint towards one of the fireplaces. He pushes Ron besides him in the narrow space and they both grab for some floo powder, pronouncing the words 'Malfoy Manor', loud an clearly.
'Alright, but I insist on guiding you there as the other students won't know what will overcome them. As I said before; we have never had a student from another school transfer to Hogwarts in his sixth year. The first a few times but
With the greatest effort, Harry managed to help the boy get onto the ladder, through the hatch and up the attic, where he collapsed onto the floor and stayed still as if dead. "Are you — are you alright?" Harry hesitantly asked after a few seconds, looking at the strange sight of the strange boy. His skin looked a shade paler than before, something Harry'd thought to be impossible.
'I actually do. At least, I think so,' she said. 'Draco, is it — is it because of your father?'
'Oh, but I believe you,' Tonks said, pulling up her eyebrows slightly. 'Otherwise you would've led Harry straight to that creepy Manor of yours instead of Grimmauld place.'
'Yes, he can,' Harry admitted, pushing Draco's wand-holding hand down and getting a look of squinted eyes from the blond in return. 'But he can't use any dueling spells. Aren't I right, Draco?'
Tomorrow the Dursleys would leave to a safer place; a place guarded by Wizards — something they most definitely weren't that pleased about. But it was safe, and that was the most important thing to both Harry as his weird family. Harry himself would travel to the Burrow with the members of the Order later that same day; protecting him for must there be an attack or any trouble on the way. Of course, they hoped that wouldn't be the case — but one never knew.

' Madame Maxime shouted around the carriage.
Doing a literal walk of shame, Draco passed through the crowd of people dressed in white from head to toe — white scars upon their shown flesh and white wings behind their backs. They kept laughing, whispering, pointing. Some kept quiet, others cried instead. Heaven would forever be a divided place just like Earth — no matter how good their souls were.
It now came in handy; something they should've used a long time before. And with the vial in Harry's hand, it was about time they'd use it. Seated in front of the fireplace, on a scarlet colored carpet in the Gryffindor common room, Harry kept on hesitating wether to take it or not. '
Biting his teeth, Draco slowly faced his mother again. He could see tears in her eyes; tears for the fear of losing her son and not knowing anymore what was the right thing to do. 'Leave Harry out of it,
There was no sun as Draco woke up but there certainly was rain; falling from the sky as if it hadn't rained in years. Tying his hair up in a bun and rolling up his pajama sleeves, Draco attacked his wardrobe in search of his water-repellent hat. It may sound
"I've been wondering… are my parents up there as well?"
it had been screaming. And it still was doing so.
'But-' the Healer tried.
The smile that graced the boy's face turned rather cheeky as he bended forward, his face closer to Draco's and making the French slowly sink away in his pillow. 'What are you doing, Harry?' With the boy now nearly on top of him, his vibrant eyes now full of lust — Draco knew that his luck was slowly running out. Especially when he had enough of this strange Harry, and decided to — for the second time in their relationship — throw the boy onto the floor. A loud WHAM followed and a moan of pain as well, Draco peering over the edge of his bed to see Harry squint his eyes. '
. Objects of gold reached their shoulders by the time Harry spotted something shiny on top of a large pile; shining a crimson red and reflecting a red light alike through the room. 'There!' he shouted, pointing at the place where he had seen the sword. 'I'll try to get it.' Trying to push himself up by stepping on top of more golden items — whom multiplied immediately — he tried to reach the sword. Meanwhile Draco, Hermione and Ron were fighting against the objects; fighting against not getting stabbed to death by multiplied daggers likewise to Ron's earlier discovery.
'Oh, it is,' Hermione answered instead of Harry. 'I believe it just wants to use you as a temporary host, as it finds you the best method to get closer to Harry. Which of course was its plan all along.'
'As soon as I awoke from that nightmare, I went to professor McGonaggal; told her everything about what I had seen. She brought me to professor Dumbledore straight away.'
A hand was placed upon his shoulder and shortly after soft lips were pressed against his cheek. 'Come on now. I even dressed up in my full uniform especially for you,' Harry said to him, smiling a bit. Draco couldn't help himself but smile weakly as well. 'We could also fly together, if you want? On the same broom, that is.'
Only a few hours of sleep had done no good to Draco as he woke up close to noon. His eyes were dull and circled in purple and grey. Most girls were still asleep as he left the carriage in a hurry, afraid Harry would've woken earlier and was awaiting him by the Lake in the freezing cold. Draco had hurriedly put on a jumper and hidden all his hair away in the thickest knitted hat he owned. A gift from the twins' their mother; she liked to knit things and gift them for Christmas. He had only unwrapped it the morning before, but it appeared to be extremely helpful in the cold winter weather that haunted Scotland.
'Get out now, Potter!'
Harry reached the cottage first. A squeaking door, a chandelier of seashells slowly swinging in the wind. The smell of lavender. Fleur stormed in their direction, and Harry knew she wanted to wrap her arms around Draco — hold the friend she had missed so greatly in her arms. But Harry stopped her, placed a hand upon her shoulder and brought his head close to her ear. 'he's not himself,' he whispered to her, hoping she would understand.
" Another angel now called. "You

'So you say they haven't found anything?' Malfoy is sitting across him, dressed in dark green robes with a large silver brooch in the shape of a snake positioned on his heart.
'It'll be especially hard for Arthur to accept you, as he had the pleasure to go to school with your father. At least, for a few years.'
Suddenly aware of how close he finds himself to Potter, Draco takes a step back; only to be grabbed by his wrist by Potter's hand. His right wrist, fortunately. Draco's grey eyes stare back into Potter's greens and they're both silent for a moment.
The sun starts to rise slowly but Draco doesn't lift his eyes from the music sheet, too focused on finishing his piece perfectly. And oh, it's going so perfectly indeed! Slide up, slide down, left fingers moving from string to string. The sore feeling in his fingers from playing a music piece so intensively isn't there; leaving nothing but numb fingers behind. It's and odd feeling; being able to move your fingers but not really getting any sense of what's beneath their touch.
The girl, Hermione, let out a long and loud sigh at his words.
'And we want to help you as well, Harry,' a small voice then announced. Harry turned around to see Luna, Neville and Ginny stand behind them. Where in Wizarding hell had they suddenly come from? 'You also shouldn't go by the Floo network.'
Suddenly realizing what Dumbledore was trying to say, Draco rose from his seat. 'You haven't cursed yourself for me, have you,
Panic overcame the French as he realized where Harry had gone. He hadn't even had to ask Hermione. It was obvious, and he could read in Hermione's eyes that she knew, or at least suspected, the same. 'I must stop him.' He bolted from the bench, ready to storm to the Forbidden Forest and protect his dear Harry, his lover, until the very end. But Hermione grabbed his arm, pulled him back and refused to let go. His heroic, fairytale-like mission shattered to pieces.
know. With his arms locked with Harry's — whom still seemed exhausted from the swim — they hiked up a small hill and formed a circle amidst the trees. Before they knew, they were gone again — and landed a few moments later in another forest that could have been exactly the same, if it hadn't been for a small river that ran a few feet away from them. 'I've hiked through this forest with my parents once,' Hermione explained, taking a glance over her shoulder at the small river. 'It's not too far from Hogsmeade, actually.'
Green eyes looked up into Draco's again. ‘You care a lot about those girls, don’t you?’ Harry stated with a smile.
he then realized.
It felt like his insides were burning; his throat was on fire and his hands and feet were tingling.
, he was here for the girls, not to interact with boys with mesmerizing green eyes.
Harry's friends followed without hesitation, kept their eyes glancing at the newly battle that had begun between Dumbledore and Voldemort — their only chance to get away safely before things would get worse again. Ron took Harry's other hand in his, Neville holding on to his leg and the three girls all clutched themselves to some part of Draco before Harry felt himself getting pulled away as if Draco had become a human Portkey.
Draco felt bad for Harry as he genuinely looked confused, but on the other hand he also started to feel more and more agitated by the second. The fact that Fleur now had to face three other Champions instead of two made his blood boil. Beside, Harry had blocked the curse of Death as a baby — who knew what magic he was capable of at his current age.
Draco couldn't help but swallow as he looked at the strange object, at its silver engravings. Whispers, as if a snake was singing strange melodies.

an accident in his first year; rather preferred staying with both feet solid on the ground. But what had to be done, had to be done — and traveling by flying horses had always been a tradition to the school of Beauxbatons.
Not really having a choice, Harry threw Draco a side-glance with his eyes before following the headmaster's trail. They walked to his office; were seated down in the comfortable chairs Harry had sat in a lot of times before. The little, magical sounds of the headmaster's office snuck into his ears again. 'Is something wrong, professor?' Harry asked. He knew Dumbledore had requested him to become friendly with professor Slughorn, but Dumbledore hadn't really explained to him exactly why yet. Was that perhaps the reason why he wanted to talk to him? But why did Draco have to join him for that?

The butterfly disappeared in the Headmaster's hands and the flames colored red one last time. Out came the last piece of parchment, neatly folded in four. Unfolding it took longer than the others, and the tension amongst the Hogwarts students grew. Dumbledore then cleared his throat one last time and read the name out loud. 'And finally, the Champion for Hogwarts…
The Slytherin lowered himself on an old chair which was positioned close to the cabinet while shaking his head. 'No, not at all. Well, it isn't really a good thing if someone dies when inside but — but that isn't the point!' Getting angry at himself for almost spoiling something, he put on a pout and crossed his arms. 'Just continue working, French kid.'
The blond's eyes took a moment before turning themselves to Harry, unfocused and tired. '
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
But Harry shook his head.
At least that was something he didn't have to worry about, Draco thought to himself. He already had to worry about Harry who was going to try and fight a dragon by summoning a broom.
'I'll come back… don't worry,' he tells him. It's something he had to tell Malfoy; to reassure him once again, to not let him lose hope. 'We'll figure this out.'
Ron didn't know where to look and decided the red carpet underneath his feet was the best choice at that moment. 'W-we were wondering where you were. Thought you'd gone to bed or something.' He scratched his head, messing up his ginger hair in a nervous manner.
Blood seeped over the pebbles as a weird sound escaped Voldemort’s soul. He grabbed for his chest, his heart, as if he was tearing apart from the inside.
‘Sirius!' Harry called out, hugging the man he had missed so much. It felt amazing to finally be reunited again with the people he loved so dearly. All those boring summer days he had to spent with the Dursleys last month hadn't been for nothing.
He mutters to himself, grabbing his arm as to try and make it stop from spreading any further. '
deserve at least some name-calling for what he had made him do.
Draco guided Fleur together with a few of her friends to the Great Hall. Gabrielle, Fleur's sister, also joined their little encouragement group and held on to Draco's hand. She had always loved to be around Draco and today was no difference; after Draco had braided her hair this morning she hadn't wanted to leave his side anymore.
With legs that felt like jelly, Harry searched for his round spectacles on his bedside table —
'Misunderstood creatures, that they are! Let's see if I can get yeh a bit closer,' Hagrid said to Madame Maxime, and made his way through the bushes, over to the men that were keeping an eye on the dragons.
The strangest sound then escaped from the boy's lips; as if he let out a painful breath. It wasn't loud, but Harry'd heard it nonetheless. He ignored it however, and kept on watching as the boy once again quickly glanced into the mirror before turning away equally as fast again. "Why can't you look into the mirror longer?" Harry couldn't help but ask, knowing his curiosity was once again jumping out.
'Harry's busy,' Hermione answered him, not daring to look him in the eyes anymore.
as if nothing had happened. He wasn't even entirely sure wether he'd be safe there at all, or if the Durseleys themselves would be safe in their own home.
'Of course we can't,' Ron interrupted. Both Harry's and Hermione's eyes stared in his direction, had forgotten he was there as well for just a moment. 'But he's after something at the Ministry, isn't he? I mean — when my father was attacked he had also been there, just like you mentioned before, Harry. He was probably guarding something for the Order. And now Draco's at the Ministry as well — also attacked. There must be a connection, right?'
' his family on the marriage of the werewolf to their cousin and how Bellatrix had fought against any recognition of it. But that was a long time ago, a time that had to be forgotten.
; that he was somehow being
And with those words said, Snape disappeared into night — away into nothingness.
I just did what was right.'
Draco finally stopped his pacing, his head a little tilted as he gave Harry a judging look. "What makes you think I've never communicated with one?" His voice held a hint of anger once more, and Harry couldn't deny that it made his heart jump a little — made him feel perhaps a tiny bit scared.
Wizards and Witches had shouted vile words at him as he'd left the Ministry that day, his knees wobbly as he'd tried to shield his mother from several wands that had been poking in their shoulders and backs. The green flames of a fireplace had never seemed so far.
'He just hurt his father without a wand, Harry! He's dangerous!' Ron protested, again in a bit of a whisper as he was afraid Draco would hear his words.
and claim both wands as his — but he was too occupied to look over his own shoulder; at Harry whom stood frozen as well. With no wand at hand. 'Where's your wand?' he asked, throwing him a confused look.
I'm not!' he replied. '
To Harry's surprise, Draco pushed his mother's hand away — a gesture Harry knew Draco would never use with his own mother. He had always talked of her with respect. Described her as a loving mother he would never hurt. No reaction followed to her words as Draco rose to his feet again, still kept his eyes locked in Harry's. Looking down upon him, he repeated his words. 'I can't be sure.' As his eyes finally wandered off, he turned around to face Bellatrix, whom seemed to have lost her patience. Her eyes grew wide of irritation, her hand got raised and slapped Draco against his cheek — the noise resounding through the large room like an echo in a well.
With that said, he had left the classroom with Draco wondering what he was up to; what the Dark Lord had given him for a task. Would it be harder? More tormenting than murdering the headmaster?
They were frozen to the bone by the time they arrived in London, their legs stiff and their ears burning from the wind's cold. They landed on a square, only dimly lit by streetlamps. Houses with crooked windows and paint peeling off their doors were lined up in rows, not really giving Harry the welcoming feeling he had expected. 'Are we here?' he asked Draco, who was trying to smooth out the wrinkles from his robes.
how Draco reached his soul, could feel how he slowly started losing control over his own body, his own mind. "The one that stares too long might not like what follows," Draco then cited, before dropping the gaze.
The blond's eyes search for something to focus themselves on, finding Harry's tea cup the perfect item for the job. It feels like Malfoy's staring holes through the china, the tea ready to seep out of its cup any second now. But nothing happens, of course. Harry's tea stays where it's supposed to be and Malfoy's eyes wander of to his own tea cup after a while.
himself; he just knows that he has to go, has to see if Malfoy is also suffering from the curse. What if he died already years ago and he didn't know about anything? Harry's heart jumps again, leaving him feeling empty and hollow for a few seconds. Then he suddenly remembers, Malfoy looking at his arm with great horror during the trial. It had looked like something was wrong with his Dark Mark, but Harry didn't think anything of it back then.
But her thought was wrong; as she hit it with the sword, she was blasted backwards as if hit by the most awful curse. She was launched at least ten feet in the air, and hit the ground rather hard. 'Hermione!' Ron called after her, storming in her direction with Harry and Draco on his heels.
Standing up again with a lot of effort — either from exhaustion or of old age — Dumbledore walked over to the portrait of the girl. He spoke to her in whispers, drawing Draco to the edge of his chair to hear what he was saying. But it was to no avail; they spoke too soft and swift to be heard. 'That is Ariana, isn't it?' Hermione then said, freezing Dumbledore's whispers. 'Your sister.'
go home for the holidays. But as Draco arrived at the usual spot; a clearing in a circular shape surrounded by trees — the apple wasn't there. Under rocks, under leafs, under the soil — the apple was nowhere to be found.
'You're not looking, are you?' Harry then shouted at him. The boy sounded far away even though Draco knew he couldn't be closer. 'Open you eyes! Look at the beautiful scenery of Hogwarts!'
A shake of her head. ‘I don’t know, Draco.’
It sounded like she accused him of planning to murder the poor boy. 'It isn't really normal for a student from a rivaling school to be so friendly with another Champion, is it?'
The following morning, Harry kept on placing a hand on his head — trying to figure out just why it was hurting so much. 'I can't remember what happened,' he told Hermione, whom had given him worried glances. 'Did I perhaps have to fight with Slughorn to get the memory out of him? I thought I'd just persuaded the man with talking?'
Without even waiting another second, Hermione was already gone — quickly followed by Harry and a hesitant Ron. But Draco's legs wouldn't move. He saw how the dragon suddenly turned wild, shook its head at the feeling of something heavy upon its neck. 'Draco!' Harry called out, making large gestures with his arms for Draco to follow. The French shook his head, his feet still stuck to the ground as if glued to it.
Three days after the Tournament, everything was still a chaotic mess; no lessons were given, students locked themselves up in their common rooms and Hogwarts seemed close to deserted. One of the only students still running around was Draco, hurrying himself through hallways to try and find Harry. He hadn't seen him ever since the night of the last task, the night Cedric had died, the night Voldemort had returned. Draco had tried many options like asking the Fat Lady for entry to the Gryffindor common room or even waiting in front of Dumbledore's office for hours on end. The Headmaster had offered him a cup of tea out of pity but hadn’t known where Harry had been either. Harry was nowhere and everywhere at the same time. Draco could see glimpses of red or the reflection of spectacles' glasses but there was no Harry; there was no lover anymore.
to be a lie!
He nods at his reaction, pouring in some tea for the both of them; the scent of bergamot tickling his nostrils in seconds. He's always been rather fond of Earl Grey tea; it relaxes all his muscles perfectly. There's a whole cabinet in the Manor's kitchen providing every kind of Earl Grey tea you can find in both the Wizarding as the Muggle world. Collected over many years; only the finest tea gets served at Malfoy Manor.
Harry shook his head and let a few fingers slide through Draco's hair. Long or short — the boy would forever be obsessed with it. 'I saw him in one of my nightmares,' he explained. 'I saw how he got attacked by
'Just leave him alone, Harry. You've done enough,' he heard Fleur tell him. The other girls agreed with her and by the slight sound of squeaking shoes on polished floor it almost seemed as if one of them had pushed Harry away.
Everybody held their breath as the names of female students rolled off Madame Maxime's tongue; all of them sounding familiar in Draco's ears. The girls were either very talented for their age or extremely beautiful, meaning that Madame knew exactly who she was choosing and why; she wanted to impress Hogwarts at all costs.
'Yet you fired a spell at me?'
'Please,' Draco interrupted, placing the ring back on Dumbledore's desk. 'Tell me about it as well so I can help Harry.'
seemed to count. Yet Draco knew this moment of peace couldn't last. Outside of their little circle, outside their safe-haven of spells; there was a war going on. The monster wasn't defeated yet, nor were his followers. There still was a lot that had to be done, and Draco knew Harry had been given a task — a task of finding certain things that belonged to Voldemort — objects similar to the locket he had worn. Why else had they been so desperate to retrieve it?
The boy's eyes squinted themselves slightly, to then relax again. 'That brought up an idea in my head actually,' Harry admitted. 'But that would be rather difficult.'
so to say. Dumbledore also noticed and looked at it with a frown. The Headmaster got surprised by a sudden burst of red flames, shooting up towards the ceiling higher than any of the previous three had done. Another piece of parchment wandered down towards him, landing on the palm of his hand. Dumbledore swallowed at the sight of the written name. 'H-Harry Potter,' he called out, his voice trembling of confusion.
‘I’ve got an hour or so to spare after flying class.’
. After being held captive at the Auror's headquarters for around two months, it had finally been time for the youngest Death Eater to defend himself at a trial he had already lost. At least, he thought he had, until a figure entered the room; someone whom couldn't be ignored. There he was,
!' He could feel his eyes sting a little; tears not so far away anymore.
The others seemed to believe it was pure luck as well, besides from Hermione of course, whom also threw Harry a suspicious look. They closed the locket subject, and Hermione hid it carefully away in a small purse.
Draco felt like he had already said those two words too many times that night and it made them sound weird and false.
Keeping his eyes fixed on them, he couldn't help but feel confused at the recognition of the boy. He had heard so many tales, so many rumors. Were they true? Maybe the boy just had a similar scar… And his
It feels different, not being able to hold the violin with his bare left hand; instead, gloved and sealed. He's afraid his glove will get stuck between the violin's strings and without thinking about it; he briefly stops and takes it off. The glove lands somewhere next to his feet, abandoned like the wilted rose was earlier. His blackened fingers find their way to the strings again as if it's all they ever do, waiting for Draco's eyes to catch the next few notes. And they do; music notes flash in front of his eyes and translate to the right movements in under a second. He slowly drifts away in his own thoughts, carried away by the cry of his own violin.
, I think so too,' Draco agreed.
‘A bit what?’
Harry smiles at her. 'I need to talk to you, and Ron.'
'Do — do your friends know?' Harry asked. 'The girls and the twins you mentioned before?'
,' Draco explained. 'But don't go shouting it at me everywhere; your French is terrible.' Harry laughed at his words and tightened his embrace around Draco a little. The blond sighed of contentment. 'You should go. Before they report their fourth Champion missing or something.'
physical yet,' he told Harry with a grin, quickly flushing a bright red again. The boy looked up into his eyes and smiled hesitantly.
'Harry,' Draco replied, the right side of his mouth slightly lifting upwards — as if he wanted to smile but keep a straight face as well for the monster next to his lover. Wearing one of his many hats and dressed in well-fitted trousers in pale blue shades again, he couldn't have been a bigger contrast to the elder Wizards in the room whom seemed to be dressed in ancient Wizarding robes. Harry himself looked disheveled in his school robes and couldn't help but find it truly wonderful how Draco always dressed so well — even when coming into battle.
resurrecting Voldemort again or break into Dumbledore’s grave to steal the Elder Wand like he did, am I right? Don’t get me wrong; the Prophet would
Harry indeed couldn't say he was acting like the Draco he used to know. His face was so emotionless; no expression there to tell how the boy truly felt. He seemed to be in pain, but yet there were no signs stating that as a fact — beside the scars and tired eyes. Those eyes... they weren't quite what they were either, were they? So much darker and filled with…
'I thought you would know the difference between dreams — and reality,' the dark figure answered, his mask disappearing with a flick of his wand; revealing the face of a man he had seen before; a man he knew as Draco's father. Lucius Malfoy was standing before him, his silver hair draped over his shoulders like Draco's once had done. 'You saw what the Dark Lord wanted you to see, Potter.'
wanted to join such an important department at the Ministry. Only a week later they were learning about the most complicated curses to protect, defend and capture.
Weasley!' Draco's hands were trembling, his magic slowly taking up all of his energy. 'I can't let that happen!'
His best friends then gave each other a questioning look. 'At the Ministry? Why would you think that?' Hermione asked. 'And isn't Draco at Beauxbatons?'
Grabbing a chair for himself now as well, Harry sat himself down and stared out of the window. There were a lot of stars tonight. Tiny dots of fire, thousands and thousands of miles away. He placed a hand on Draco's thigh, drew a few circles with his index finger as a loving gesture. 'What now,' Draco asked, a sigh escaping his mouth.
'I wish he could be here — he probably would've wanted to,' Harry admitted with a sigh, letting go of Fleur's dress and staring back at the photograph.
, it is not because it's not in French. You're rambling words you don't know the meaning of.
Focusing his attention on his own Mortal again, Draco stepped through the closed bathroom door as if it was the most normal thing in the world. To him it felt like stepping through a shower of cold rain; a little chilly but nothing more. Noticing Harry was looking at himself in the mirror, Draco positioned himself right behind the boy. He himself almost reached six feet two, while Harry stayed at a mediocre five feet six. Keeping his own gaze on the boy's reflection and not his own — vanity was one of the biggest sins angels should not commit — Draco tried to read his thoughts through those emerald eyes of his.
A few moments later the portrait swung aside; revealing a dark tunnel behind a smiling Neville. A bruised eye. A broken nose. Crusts on his lips. 'Hello, guys!' he greeted them, and Draco swore he could see the slightest glimpse of tears at the sight of his friends.
He then felt a hand on his shoulder. 'Calm down, Harry. I'm sure they'll tell you soon enough,' Draco told him.
Draco’s mind is slightly blown at this look; at this emotion he hasn’t seen that many times before. An emotion that’s worrying to him. And
The days at Grimmauld Place went by too fast and the new school year was coming closer and closer. Harry knew he had to say goodbye again to Draco, had to miss him for Merlin knew how long. At least, if he was allowed to go to Hogwarts again; he still had to go on and defend himself at the Wizengamot. How on earth was he going to do that?
,’ he said to her.
Draco jumps up from his chair, throwing the table to the floor with a single swing. China breaks to pieces on his black wooden floor, scattering bits everywhere. The wilted rose, somewhere lost in the battlefield. His hands, one black and one white, clutch themselves around the armrests of Potter's chair.
'A dog then?' Harry said with a growing grin upon his face.
'What about you, actually? Never got married to another Pureblood girl?' Potter asks him.
Reassured that there was nothing wrong with Draco beside from being asleep, he glanced over at the other three that were tied up as well. He felt is chest tighten from the inside out at the sight of Hermione; asleep as well. Cho Chang was also there and what seemed to be a little girl, probably Fleur's sister.
“What exactly did you do, if I may ask?” Harry turned himself to Draco, who had pulled up the ladder and closed the hatch as if he was the one who'd been living on this attic for years — well,
Harry glanced over his shoulder at the man. He stood in front of a giant round clock; almost Draco's timepiece enlarged. Everyone their eyes were casted upon it, ready for it to start ticking. And then the shot was given, followed by three splashes and the swallowing of gillyweed. It had a fool taste and the slimy texture made Harry want to spit it out again. He dove into the lake while awaiting it's effect, a bit nervous wether it would work or not.
Enthusiasm flowing through his body, Draco got back up to his feet and ran over to the other broom they had deserted earlier. Leg swung over he tightened his hands around the wood a little more. 'You sure about this?' Harry asked, getting into the right position for take-off as well. The boy looked a little worried but Draco could feel his shared enthusiasm radiate from his presence.

Even though his first thought should've been telling it to Fleur, he had thought immediately about telling it to Harry. Of course, in the end, he planned on telling them both, but the fact that he had thought about the boy first, made him realize that he cared about him already too much. What was it that made him so
'I think I'll keep it; it's warm and smells like pine needles.' Harry couldn't help but smile as he knew he himself smelled like pine needles. It looked quite funny on Draco, though; the bright red wool. It was a color Harry had never seen him wear before and it contrasted greatly against his pale skin.

'I want to say something cheesy but I won't say it because it's cheesy,' Draco then said, already grinning at himself for even having the thought.
Dumbledore didn't seem to be changing his mind by Harry's words and kept a straight face as he guided Harry around a street's corner. A street-lantern flickered orange light onto the pavement and a slight mist, of which Harry's didn't know was Dumbledore's doing or just nature, hovered around them. 'Draco is a clever boy, Harry — and very talented as well. He will probably outsmart you any day of the week and defeat you in any duel as well. So for that; you shouldn't worry. Nor should you worry about mister Malfoy, his father. He won't be able to hurt his son — trust me,' Dumbledore told him before he stopped at a house that looked as abandoned as the others.
at the library trying to find
The furious look from Draco's eyes now filled his whole face; his eyebrows frown and his mouth a thin line as he took a step closer to the monster without hesitation. 'I will never join your side,' he said to him with hands balled to fists. If one could spit flames from his eyes; this definitely would have been the moment where Voldemort would've caught fire.
Fleur didn't seem satisfied with his answer and took ahold of his arm. 'You're a good dancer,
? I heard the views are spectacular.'
,' the twins answered in a mocking way before disappearing in the partying crowd.
It felt as if his body got split into two. As if his scars were ripped open again and warm, dark blood was seeping out. He tried to breathe, but his lungs protested. He tried to understand, but his mind was failing. His eyes saw the truth; they saw the lifeless body of his lover held in the arms of a man. His face set peaceful. His eyes closed.
a gigantic moon! "Yes." The word was said so silently that Harry didn't hear Draco at first. A few seconds later he turned himself to the boy; looked at his white presence that was slightly illuminating in his dark room.
'How I know?' Harry interrupted. 'While I was held hostage by a
Harry's smile was replaced by a confused look and once again a frown. ‘Er — yes.’
But he didn’t. Castor stayed on the ground, and seemed to be in a state of shock. Staring at the wall in front of him, his eyes appeared blank. His mind must've exploded, Harry thought to himself. Not only had the boy faced his biggest fear was again — he had lost two of his friends in a situation he had created himself.

And Draco hugged her back. '
"Explain."
confusion now and Draco didn't like the look of that
He nearly dropped it as the door was slammed closed behind his back. Turning himself around; he saw the man whom looked like Dumbledore cross the room — leave through another door. Draco quickly placed the book back the way he had found it, joined the others whom awkwardly remained standing by the window.
'He's a smart elf indeed, and the most loyal one I've ever met,' Harry said, looking at Dobby with loving eyes.
'He knows what?'
Draco kissed him again, a warmth filling his insides as he felt the blond's long fingers tangle themselves in his hair. How much he had missed that feeling as well. The touch of silk beneath his fingers, the strong scent of lemons. He pulled away again but kept his eyes locked in those of his beloved one. ‘But — what on earth are you doing here?'
' he demanded, more serious and angry than he had ever heard his own voice before. The goblin obeyed immediately, took lead and started marching away. The trio next to him were frozen, stared at Draco as if they had never seen him before. '

You-Know-Who himself gave it to me. Bellatrix had found it somewhere, returned it to him before he gave it to me to wear. I had no choice but to wear it, even though I knew it was something evil.'
“Pibbly would be delighted to welcome Harry Potter sir and Ron Weasley sir to Master Malfoy's house. Please wait in the tea room as Pibbly gets Master Malfoy for you sirs.” She bows her head deeply again, gesturing towards two double doors on their right before and disapparating from the hall, leaving them heading alone for the tea room.
Harry let out a sigh. The poor boy had tried already many times to talk to the potions professor; but it almost seemed as if the man didn't let any conversation go in the direction that Harry wanted to take it in. From the second Harry said a word about Riddle or even just a memory; Slughorn would change the subject dramatically and act like Harry hadn't mentioned anything about it at all. The Christmas party would be another opportunity for Harry to talk to the man and perhaps finally get something out of him. 'It'll probably be a failure once again,' the boy admitted with another sigh. 'Why has Dumbledore given me this task anyway? Isn't he more capable of it himself?'
Malfoy,' Draco said with a little smile.
“Dunno... he’ll probably just shout at me more, perhaps come upstairs to give me a good punch in the stomach. Then leave again; tell my aunt and uncle I’m not allowed to have dinner.”
The blond then looked away, first at his feet then at one of the Muggle trains beside them. 'Well… That's
“What — what are you doing?” Harry asks, confused.
Was it truly that what he saw in his visions, in his nightmares — or was it something else? Harry had no idea, and his head was already too full to add another theory to it. He had said his good-night to his friends, picked up the few books he had brought down for studying and had gone to bed — to hopefully dream of more peaceful things than brightly shining orbs of glass.
Draco let out a chuckle. 'You're so cheesy. Cheesy Harry; that should be your true name.'
Another portkey. Had he ever taken that many portkeys in one year before?
'Distraction,' Hermione simply said before leaving Harry alone in the kitchen.
A hesitant step. A look of confusion and disbelief. They neared. They laughed. They shouted. Something that was a lie. Something that
Immediately Vernon's eyes spat fire; a fire Harry'd seen raging quite a few times before. "I have," Vernon answered his son, although Harry was pretty sure he hadn't. "No breakfast for you, Potter."
said to you, but
Of course it made Draco cry, what had he expected? It was all too emotional, suffering from an unknown curse without having anyone to care about him. Not to mention the fact that he had become quite the monster; wilting roses and everything. He didn't even want to know what would happen if he accidentally touched Potter's skin; perhaps it would just burn away.
Harry felt more nervous than before now that Draco was gone, and stared into the mirror again. He could've looked worse, that's true; and since when did he care about what he looked like anyway?
There had been nightmares as well though; terrible ones. Harry would wake up, sweating and panting as he reached for his scar and placed cool fingers upon the burning flesh. The few times he had awoken that way with Draco by his side, he had been helped back into a peaceful sleep by the French' soothing words — but times when he had woken up alone, he hadn't dared to go back to sleep; afraid he would face the darkness of a place that looked like a graveyard again. The nightmares had started the summer before, but hadn't occurred a lot in the first half of the school year. With the final task nearing however, the nightmares seemed to near as well, occur more often and haunt him with visions of snakes, green light and an increasing fear of Voldemort.
A deep sigh, which surprised Harry as he didn't know angels could sigh — didn't they need breath to do that? "You would not understand," he simply replied; cold and with a slight hint of anger. An emotion Harry thought he'd never hear from such a calm, peaceful presence as that of Draco.
Harry bit his lip as he remembered Draco's last letter; telling him about his father demanding him to come home. 'I'm not so sure about that, actually. His last letter had me feeling quite worried about his situation, and he hasn't sent me another one since. Besides; we don't have any time to lose — he might be hurt!'
"Oh!" Harry then exclaimed, interrupting the boy. Placing his hands to his mouth, red creeping up his neck out of guilt. "You're hurt! Of course!" Feeling immensely stupid and like the world's most idiotic human being, a feeling of extremely guilt washed over him. How could he have distracted the boy for so long? Who knew in how much pain he might've been this entire time!
Sunday evening came faster than Draco had hoped and it made him nervous. Ever since Fleur had put her name in the Goblet of Fire, Draco had been hoping that she would be the chosen one. Of course he would support any girl that would be chosen as Beauxbatons' Champion, but it would hurt his ego a bit if that would be the case.
Harry nodded. ‘Alright, I’ll be there.’
All of that was for the future, though. Right now they were all relying on Dolohov's body to have that one single clue they needed to solve the mystery that was this curse. Never had Draco thought that the Death Eater would become so helpful; he'd never liked the man at all. Always listening to Voldemort without hesitation, killing many in his name and torturing any Wizard or Witch that crossed his path unwillingly.
At exactly that moment he got pulled out of Snape's head; back into his scruffy Potions classroom. The professor looked disheveled and worn out, took ahold of the table behind him and seemed to be panting of exhausting. 'Sir, I—,' Harry began but Snape raised a hand to silence him.
Not even a moment later Hermione shot a spell at the chains that held the dragon hostage; releasing it from its imprisonment. The dragon struggled though, its wings unused for years and heavily scarred. A few failed flaps later and the creature was finally off, flying upward towards the globe of light.
‘So, how did you find out how to decipher the Egg’s message anyway?’ Harry asked.
She sighs and lays down the Prophet next to her tea. She drops a sugar cube in the hot liquid, stirs a few times and lifts up her eyes again. "I want you to come to Diagon Alley with me today, Draco. I think visiting some of those shops will do you good. You can buy whatever you want."
'If they want me to stay, they'll have to accept you as well,' the boy answered. He then turned to face the others, raised his chin a little and cleared his throat. 'First of all; thank you for sticking by our side,' he announced. Draco had caught words of that fact as well; how they had gone in against the new rules of Hogwarts, and had been hiding and preparing in secret for a battle once Harry would return. 'Secondly, I would like to ask for everyone to accept Draco of being on our side. He has proved multiple times that he belongs with
Unsure of what to do, Harry hesitated for a few seconds longer, but then decided he couldn't let this boy suffer any more, and gave in. "It's a few more minutes walking though — will you be able to manage?" The boy in white nodded. "Wouldn't it be better if I took you to a hospital? To a doctor? You are bleeding and seem terribly hurt…"
Harry sighed and nodded at his words. 'Of course you are. But don't worry; you've got me and Ron and Hermione. And all of the others that know the true you! Don't listen to what those idiots have to say; they don't know anything about your situation.'
Triggered by his son's reply, Lucius rose from the bed and glanced at his wife, whom seemed helpless in what do or how to react. The man moved a over to Draco, leaned close and let a few strands of blond hair brush his face — taking Draco right back to that time his father had chased him down the maze at Beauxbatons; demanding him to come home. Well, now he was home once again. 'You are wrong about that, Draco. I
, at least."
'But how?' Ron asked, his hands searching the walls next to the vault for some kind of secret exit.
'You're smiling!' Potter points out, still smiling brightly himself.
and that monster do once they hear I am unwilling to come home?'
There had to be something wrong. Something
No, there was no way he was going home for the holidays — wether his mother was all alone or not. Accepting Molly Weasley's offer, both Draco and Harry were boarding the Hogwarts Express to make their way towards what was described as the most interesting Wizarding home of all. Ron didn't even seem bothered anymore with having Draco over; having him as a close friend now as well. It almost seemed as if in the few months that they haven't seen each other, he had somehow grown used to him. There were no more angry stares or blames of him being a Death Eater as well. Perhaps cleverness had come to the boy rather late.
In a heap of leaves she laid, and to everyone's amazement; she was smiling. Laughing.
A few months after the war, the curse showed its first sign of spreading — it's first itch. Maybe Draco had even felt it itch right after the Dark Lord had been defeated — Voldemort or Tom Riddle, however one would want to call him. Of course Draco had thought of his arm itching before that time, had thought of it as a gigantic mistake and a regret. But that kind of itching had been something between his ears — something non-physical.
The blond lifts his tea cup and saucer, staring so intensively into the liquid as if it'll bite off his nose if he dares to look away. “It's about my Dark Mark”. Harry parts his lips, ready to say something, but immediately gets interrupted again. “And yes, I know that you saw it. My arm, that is.”
Draco nodded. 'I indeed am not a Gryffindor, but I do have Gryffindor friends. They are having a party right now,
,' Draco whispered to her and it made her cheeks turn a violent red.
she announced, a smile gracing her face.
to do it? Would Harry hate him for it? 'Yet you know, don't you?' Draco then asked, suddenly realizing that Dumbledore had been talking about something else than just being on the wrong side. Did the old headmaster perhaps already know what the Dark Lord was up to? What he had given Draco as his task?
Fury rose within Draco; a fury that angels didn't express quite often. "The
, he thought to himself, before casting perfect drying charms on all of them. Although they were perfect, Draco still could feel that something was different; something about the magic that had erupted from his wand felt different. Was it because he had been possessed by an evil force? Because he had given his wand this new worn-off look? He had no idea, and no time to think about it either. Everyone's hair frizzled a little at the blow of a magic wind, their clothes indeed still the tiniest bit damp. Draco wanted to get out of the black robes just as eagerly as Hermione, and if he could, he would never wear the damn color again.
without having you around. And don’t think I only missed you because of your help; you radiate a certain
So as he got back to the carriage, he found all the girls had returned already as well. With the door swung open, he immediately heard a silence fall. All their eyes were pointed in his direction, blank expressions on their faces. Draco stood frozen in the door, unsure of what to do or how to react. Madame sat on her purple sofa by the fire, her eyes fixed upon him as well.
The woman’s eyebrows raised slightly. ‘
'Then it'll be gone,
'Mister Malfoy must open the door himself,' the goblin reminded him with a blank stare.
'Neville!' Harry called out. 'What are you doing here?'
Puzzle pieces fell into place in Harry's mind as well; of course the prophecies were stored at the Ministry of Magic — the most secure and safe place beside from Hogwarts. 'So you think that that's what he's after? That the prophecy is something he couldn't get when he attacked Arthur? And that it's at the Ministry?' Hermione nodded at his words. 'Then there's another reason to go to the Ministry right now — wether Draco's there or not. We have to keep the prophecy from his hands!'
And now he was running again; for what he seemed to do every time he was in an argument with Harry. Where had the time gone where he didn't run at all? Where was the time where he envied the girls getting chased — running away from their potential lovers in an innocent way?
,' Draco said to him. 'Everyone, hold on to either me or Harry.'
The sentence McGonagall says about 'chance to let you hair down' was something I stumbled upon when doing more research into the Yule Ball and I just HAD to put it into this fic as well!
