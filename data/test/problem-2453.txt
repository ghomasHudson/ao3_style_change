you working on?” He cranes his neck to try and get a glimpse of the books on Malfoy’s table.
He pulls the stack of letters out from the concealed drawer at the base of his desk, spreading them in front of him in chronological order. They’re all opened by now, but they hadn’t been prior to yesterday, and with mingled dread and guilt Harry opens and scans through them again, one by one.
“Not much in the mood for talking yet,” Draco murmurs, crowding Harry back into the wall. The shower stall is steamy and warm even when they’re not under the water, and Harry’s body is slick and trembling against his. “We can have our
“Sorry,” Potter says, and he sounds miserable. “I know this is… Well. I know you barely tolerate me, and this has got to be your worst nightmare, and...I’m sorry, as much as I joke around I do get that this isn’t exactly ideal for you, but…” He trails off, and Draco’s shoulders slump.

Draco flings the polo over his shoulder and marches for the bathroom. “You’d better head down, then—we shouldn’t be seen arriving at breakfast together, unless you’re interested in starting rumours,” he says, fiddling with the taps until the shower is at his preferred temperature.

He drifts for a bit, lulled by the repetitive motion of Draco’s hands in his hair, and jolts a bit when Draco speaks again. “You don’t suck, you know. You’re not nearly as bad as Games. You just have a little trouble remembering the deadlines.”
The man jumps, and whirls, and some sort of Glamour charm skitters and warps over his features. The auburn hair fades to silver, then back to red, and the square jaw lengthens to a point before snapping back.
He rushes to undress and select his spot first; the Ministry showers are utilitarian, and while they do provide a variety of products, there are no individual stalls, just two rows of showerheads along opposite walls. Naturally, they have features Muggle showers never would, but the utter lack of anything remotely resembling privacy had been...jarring, at first. Harry’s used to it now, but not with

I recommended her for a promotion—she’s up managing the Minister’s secretary pool now. She was far too good for the DMLE; I couldn’t hold her back just because she’s impervious to the press.”
Harry hadn’t known what to say to that, but he thought Draco understood the silence that followed his statement, and Harry made his admiration clear in other ways.
as each thread vibrates under Potter’s touch, and it sets his teeth on edge and sends goosebumps rushing all over his skin. A tendril of Potter’s magic snakes away from the door, back to where Draco is standing; he slaps it away as it attempts to twine with his own magic.

Ron’s on edge. They all are, of course, but this case, the discovery of what Harry was doing in his spare time; it was second-hardest on Ron, when the truth came out.

He squeezes hard, and Harry groans again. “Do you like that?” Draco asks, nipping down Harry’s neck. “You have no idea how hard seeing you the other morning made me.” He nudges his hips forward until their cocks are lined up and thrusts a few times, until they both are moaning at the friction. “You’re so gorgeous, Harry. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.”
Draco steps into the shower and firmly shuts the door, then spells an opaque privacy barrier between the bathroom and the rest of the suite. “We’re on the job, Potter,” he says firmly, keeping his voice as neutral as possible. “We can talk about it later. I can’t afford to lose focus, not with Browne-Heathcote fixated on me like he is.”

He barely has a second alone at work, and the gym allows him time to decompress and take time for himself.

As autumn fades into winter, Harry starts going to the Ministry more and more.
A muffled whisper against Harry’s shoulder, and Draco’s fingers are slick, gliding down his spine and circling his hole. “Like that?” Draco says, swirling slowly, pressing lightly but not all the way in.
Harry laughs without humour. “All those brains and you’re a real first-class idiot, aren’t you? What, were you going to do this

“What,” Harry manages to gasp out, and Draco sighs and glances pointedly over at the bar, which obligingly sends a glass of water zooming over. Harry takes a few sips and finally gets his breath back. “You. Really? Are you sure? I don’t want you to…”
Harry sighs, then relieves Ron of a few more books. “Yeah, you’re pretty hopeless, I’ll grant you that. But honestly mate, you’ve got to stop talking about this like you’re on some sort of prison term and Hermione is the sentencing judge. You

And, well. Potter’s his partner; whenever they work together, he does everything he can to keep Draco safe, sometimes at the expense of his own well-being. So Draco would really have to be the worst type of person if he didn’t offer to bring Potter home with him for the evening.
Harry’s smile had been a bright, hard, fleeting thing, almost enough to make Draco back down. Almost. “If I win, and you can’t bake this cake...you’ll let me suck you off.”
After that, it’s a simple matter of smiling and nodding and rolling his eyes in the right spot, and acting vapid when Travis questions him on his Auror status (Draco’s become excellent at getting people to assume he’s merely skating by on his family’s money and not actually contributing anything to the corps; it drives Harry crazy, but it’s come in handy more than once), and doing his level best to stay somewhat sober despite the multiple refills Travis calls for.
Harry’s hands fly to Draco’s hips as he grinds forward, and the snake on his leg crawls up and down his thigh, and from the way Draco starts shivering he can feel it. Harry drags his hands up over Draco’s torso until he reaches his chest, and he pinches and tugs at his nipples and the piercings until Draco’s squirming and howling in pleasure while Harry ruts his cock between Draco’s cheeks.
Harry laughs, a bit hysterically. “Merlin. You mentioned blind luck at lunch today; have you taken up Divination in your spare time?”
It’s enough, though; it always is, Harry knows exactly what Draco needs, every time, and it’s only a few minutes before Draco’s coming all over Harry’s fist.

Harry tugs off his jacket and lets it fall to the ground. Draco narrows his eyes. It doesn’t always go like this; sometimes, Harry falls right into character, and Draco has them both cleaned up and asleep within an hour.

Harry groans as they stop at the intersection of several aisles, where Hermione had instructed them to meet her. “No thank you. It’s bad enough pretending I don’t know what you’re doing when the two of you sneak off for a quarter of an hour at the pub—if I had to somehow

Harry’s due back at three from his meeting with the Minister, so Draco spends the time tidying the office a bit for him, sorting files away and Vanishing the trash and folding up clothes that need to be taken home to be washed, then carefully moves everything off the desk and out of the way.
and when Harry bends down to nibble at the taut tendons of his neck, he relishes Draco’s shouts and incoherent begging.
Harry’s face is red and splotchy, and his eyes are rimmed in red, and his lips look painfully swollen, and his hairline is damp from both sweat and the flannel, and Draco’s heart skips a beat, because really, he’s never seen such a beautiful thing in his whole life.

She winces. “Right. So. You’ll have to stay within ten feet until the spell has been, er, satisfied as it were, but once that’s done you’ll be released from the constraints of the bond instantly, with no ill side-effects.”
) and don’t talk about Harry at all.
Now, it’s long enough that he usually wears it in a bun, to keep it out of his eyes when he’s combing the stacks at the Magical Institute’s library for whatever obscure research tome he needs. He finally understands Hermione’s fanaticism about the library, now that he’s a research fellow in the Dark Arts Theory department; it’s quiet, and soothing, and he can lose himself for hours, and give himself a break from his own thoughts.

His eyes rove over Harry’s chest and torso, imagining painting the ridged muscles and chest hair with his come. Harry’s cock is twitching again, the head turning purple, and the navy blue of the rings offsets his skin so deliciously that it’s not long before Draco is coming onto Harry’s stomach with a cry.
Sometimes he catches Harry looking at him like he has similar thoughts, but he never says anything, either.
isn’t fair for me to force her to remind me to do stuff around the house, because that’s not actually less work for her.”
Draco feels pinned in place by Harry’s gaze, but he can’t meet his eyes, mesmerized by the flickering candles—silver, gold, and blue, and all emitting a sweet almond scent—and Harry has to tap him on the chin to draw his attention back.
“It’s good,” Potter says. “Were you interested in me trying that anywhere

He keeps going well past when his knees start to ache on the tile, well past when his skin is pruning from the water. He licks and sucks at Harry, and wiggles first one, then two fingers in along with his tongue, pressing against Harry’s prostate until Harry is shouting and pounding on the shower wall, thrusting back against Draco’s face.

Draco breathes on the sofa for a minute, trying to will his erection down with no success, before he finally shakes his head and heads back into the kitchen.
“Of course he did,” Draco says smugly. “I’m a bloody fantastic shag. It’s a point of pride. But trust me…” one hand wanders down to squeeze Harry’s arse, while the other fondles Harry’s now nearly-erect cock, “...you’ve absolutely nothing to worry about. I have very firm ideas of what I want in a partner, and Weasley would
Harry leans back and gasps for air, then glances down and smirks at the wet spot on Draco’s fine grey trousers. “Oh,” he says casually, as if he’s not naked in Draco’s lap, “did you need help with that?” He wiggles forward purposefully, and Draco groans; Harry’s arse and thighs have

could they have figured it out?”
Draco bundles them out of the bathroom, grabbing for his wand and casting Warming and Drying charms until they’re both comfortable again, and then, with a burst of daring he thought he’d used up entirely to go join Harry in the first place, cancels the Separating charm and turns the double beds back into one.

Harry’s sitting at the other end of the table, eyes roving greedily over Draco’s body while he drinks. When he’s done, Draco Vanishes the glass and shoots Harry a tired smile. “Was it everything you wanted?” he asks, shocked at how hoarse his voice is. Was he shouting at some point? He can’t remember.
Potter’s jaw drops. “Are you fucking

Even after almost a year, Draco sometimes wakes up and thinks he’s still in the southwest of America, that he’ll spell his curtains open and be able to curl up and bake lizard-like in the morning sun streaming in through his window. As much as being back home makes him happier overall—and it certainly made his mother happier, too—there are things about Arizona he misses.
Inch by inch, Draco feeds his cock down Harry’s throat, pausing when Harry gags a bit to give him time to adjust, but never pulling out, never stopping. He only stops when Harry’s nose is pressed to his pubic hair. He can feel Harry’s exhales against his skin and shivers.

His skin is crawling as he straightens and steps out of Potter’s reach. “Let’s be quick. The wardstone shouldn’t be too hard to find; he’s done something horrific to it, it’ll stand out.

Draco groans deep in his throat and falls forward, planting his hands on either side of Harry’s head and kissing him. Harry can taste himself on Draco’s tongue, and that’s far more erotic than he thought it would be, and he adds a bit of a twist to his motion, along with a rub over the head of Draco’s cock on every other stroke, and it’s not long before Draco’s coming too, all over Harry’s stomach and chest.
By the time Harry walks back into his office, Draco’s leaned artfully against the desk, one hand down his trousers—he’s flushed already, he knows, and when Harry freezes and rakes his eyes greedily up and down his body, Draco knows

I’ve been to a couple of your matches, you’ve been playing so well, I’d love to hear all about it.” He gives her a hopeful smile.
“Thank you for coming in, Mr Malfoy,” he finally begins, and

“As always, your hospitality is unmatched, Draco,” Harry says fondly. His voice is scratchy with exhaustion, though, and Draco frowns at the dark circles he hadn’t noticed earlier.
Harry nods once and turns heel, making for the door.
he does, and sometimes, Harry likes it. He doesn’t mind telling Draco when that’s the case.
Harry manages to shoot Draco a remarkably incredulous look through the deep breathing he’s doing. Draco waits patiently, and once he’s sure Harry’s not going to spew, leads them out of the copse of trees they’d landed in and gestures grandly to the manor home just ahead of them. “Behold: Linthwaite House.”

He starts to slide down Harry’s torso, stopping to bite at his nipples until Harry’s near tears at how good it feels, then finally licking his way down until he’s got his face buried in the trimmed patch of hair just over Harry’s cock.
“Harry?” Malfoy says. Harry pauses, but doesn’t turn around. “It’s good to see you again.”
Harry lets the silence drag on, just long enough for Draco to shift uncomfortably in the chair, before he starts talking.

“You’re just as much of a little shit as you ever were, aren’t you,” he snarls, green eyes bled to black. He pushes one of those gloriously thick thighs between Draco’s legs and grinds up ruthlessly onto Draco’s half-hard cock, chubbing rapidly in his trousers. “Fuck, you and that goddamn whistle, barking orders all over

Second only to Draco. Ron’s the only one who has even an inkling of what the last months have been like, and even he only can scratch the surface of the stress.
Harry scrambles to his feet and strips off his trousers and pants, taking a moment to fold them carefully and set them aside. His socks are folded over each other and placed on top, and his glasses, arms carefully bent back into place, on top of those.
Draco, it’s just something your brain does to protect itself. You’ll get there. Or you won’t, and that’s fine too.”

“Okay,” Potter complies, eyes wide as he looks down at their bodies. “Fuck.”
“No, I’m fine,” Draco says. “I sleep nude.”
This is
“Back to insults now, isn’t it?”
“Did I say something?” Malfoy asked.
“But I could, Draco. I love being here with you. I love flying with you and swimming with you and watching you be picky about your tea. I’ll never go home again—I don’t want to. There’s nothing left for me there.”
Almost
Seeing the back of Draco’s head down the hall in front of him as Harry walks into the Department of Mysteries is hard.
Harry takes the book, opening it to where the parchment is, and sees it’s most definitely Hermione’s handwriting.
Draco hears him muttering protection charms, and then his hands are back again, except this time there’s a warm, slick finger pressing at his entrance, and Draco cries out. “
“I’m still a bit...” Harry pauses, trying to think of the right words. “I dunno. Is that what you think of me, what you said earlier? That I’m some smarmy swot who just likes to, I dunno, save people?”
“Go on, then,” Draco says. He’s still not looking at Harry, and Harry’s stomach twists.
“Sorry I took so long,” Potter says, a little out of breath. “I didn’t have anything to wear—I had to Floo-call Hermione.” He’s flushing a little, which is unfairly attractive—Draco always looks like he’s about to explode when he goes all red.
“I sleep on the right side,” Potter says without preamble, and Draco gives him a dour look but concedes. It’s been rare for him to share his bed with someone else, and he tends to sprawl out in the middle more than anything.
“Oh!” Draco looks shocked, his cheeks going rather pink, his eyes darting downwards. “I—I suppose that would be fine.”
“Oh,” Harry says. “Right.”
“And Mother loves me, but she’s not the most affectionate person either.” Draco thinks about it for a moment, thinks of growing up in Slytherin, where showing too much fond emotion for others was sometimes regarded as weakness. “I had Pansy growing up, but other than that, Slytherins aren’t really the hugging bunch.”
“It was just… sudden,” Malfoy cleared his throat. “I’ll… I’ll do it again.”
Harry pauses, then shakes his head. “Either of those things could happen, I suppose. But I’ve never felt as strongly about—about anyone else. It’s always been you, you know.”
“Oh,” Harry says, and the world rolls over beneath his feet. “You don’t want to—practice more?”
Draco snorts. “No, no, I was a little shite, you don’t have to pity me. That’s just—background, I guess, to the real answer to your question.”
Malfoy swallows nervously, glancing around the room before finally settling his gaze on Harry. “Potter,” he says, less sharply than Harry would’ve expected.
Harry rolls his eyes, laughing. “I didn’t like us much back then, obviously. We… we’ve had a lot of shit to work through. Like when I cut you open,” he says, a twinge of remorse pinging in his throat even now.
—this
Except that ever since they both kind of sort of admitted they wouldn’t mind having sex with each other, it’s all Harry can think about.
This is it—his small amount of happiness. It’s his and his alone, and they cannot take it from him.
Draco still feels embarrassingly warm just thinking about it.
Malfoy raises an eyebrow at him. “You look pleased,” he says, and Harry flushes.
When Harry pulls away, there are tears in his eyes, and Draco’s throat burns. “Please,” Draco says, trying to wipe them away, but there are too many. “Not on my account.”
“Please,” Malfoy says, and the desperate tone to his voice gives Harry pause. “There’s going to be an attack. They’ve found out about the Phoenix Gardens.”
And, well, Potter is here. So Draco may as well look at
“That, er.” Harry swallows, laughing slightly. “I’m glad that was something you remember, because, er. I dunno if you noticed, but. I sort of wanked over that?”
He looked in. Draco was standing in the middle of the vast room, and in the room was a thick, black darkness. No fire, no towers of abandoned objects—just emptiness.
“Yeah,” Potter says. Then he leans into Draco, letting his head drop to Draco’s shoulder, and Draco can’t hold back a faint gasp of wonder. “Sorry,” Potter says, jerking away.
“And you?” he asks, pausing for air.
She gives him a look, but still, she nods. “Briefly,” she says, setting her fork down with a sigh, and he nearly regrets bringing it up. “He’s busy drowning in his own misery, and I suspect that nothing either of us can do will change that.”
He hands Potter the cup.
Draco leans his forehead against Harry’s, warm and intimate, eyes sparkling.
And then Draco laughed. It was a desperate laugh, and Harry didn’t know what to say, but then Draco came to Harry and hugged him, held him tightly. Harry could feel tears start to drip down his cheeks. He felt paralyzed, too hurt to wipe them away. All he could smell was ash.
“Well, tough,” Potter says. “If we’re not linked together somehow, then we’re going to accidentally separate at some point, and I don’t fancy waking up in the middle of the night because of a headache.”
But he also knows that there’s really nothing he can do about it, because he’s gone and done the most outlandish, idiotic thing he’s ever done in his life—
“…I suppose it does,” Harry said. He hadn’t really been keeping track.
He’d expected to see a picture of Potter in the showers, just as he’d been that day, or maybe a vision of Potter wanking at best. He would’ve been happy enough with that, he thinks.
Draco backtracks, looking nervous. “I mean, not if you don’t want to—and it’s not like I
“Not that this helps,” Harry says. “But I dunno if any of us are ever ready. I wasn’t, when Sirius died.”
“Don’t think of it, okay?” Potter says, as if avoiding it will make everything all right.
Harry laughs. “Yes,” he says. “I don’t mind that at all, actually.”
It’s not real, and yet it

and he can’t help rutting against Draco, pressing his forehead to Draco’s shoulder. And then time seems to slow down as he looks up again and meets Draco’s eyes, and Draco
“My lab’s there,” Draco says, shrugging. “I don’t interact with patients much, so I’m probably safe. Plus Mungo’s is loaded with automatic sterilization charms. It’s more important to try and finish my potion.”
Except that in the back of his mind, there’s always the faint whisper of a thought that he’s wasting time, that he could be working on finding Astoria a cure instead, not faffing about with golden-colored trinkets.
“You can say you love me, you know,” Potter said with a chuckle.
Fuck.
Draco takes him in—takes in the sad look in Potter’s eyes, the way his shoulders are all hunched in defeat.
Cool hands cup his arse, spreading him wide, and Harry gulps as Malfoy makes an approving noise. “So
Draco clasps his hands against his chin and thinks about it. “I’d mourn,” he says truthfully. He can’t imagine life without Astoria. He doesn’t even know if he’d want to go to work, or do anything at all, really. He would just want to sit around at home. “Maybe sell the Manor,” he adds, because honestly he can’t imagine staying there alone for the rest of his life. The only reason Mother was able to convince him to keep it for now is because the wards offer special protections for Malfoys who reside there, meaning it’s safer for Astoria.
was going to happen?
“That’s mine,” Draco stopped him. Harry glanced down at it. Predictably, ‘Draco Malfoy’ was emblazoned clearly across the top.
And it doesn’t help that Draco’s been head-over-heels for him for far too long.
Draco laughs, the truth of it smacking him in the face as he says, “Looks like you have a type.” Then he stills—shit, he’s just implied that
Harry tears his eyes away and swallows hard. “Nothing.”
“It’s okay,” Malfoy says, looking vulnerable anyway.
Draco swallows thickly. “I suppose.”
Fuck. He’s really going to do this, isn’t he?
“What the
His only regret is that he can’t tell Hermione about his reading—she would be proud, he thinks, of him being excited over research for once.
“It is. Well, it’s owned by Muggleborns,” Malfoy explains, and Harry is struck by a sudden appreciation for this new, post-war Malfoy, one who eats hamburgers at Muggleborn restaurants and goes out of his way to seek Harry’s company.
She doesn’t mention that they might be out for much longer than the rest of the season.
Before Draco even really knows what he’s doing, he’s reaching out to Potter, grabbing at Potter’s waist and pulling him down over top of him—and then they’re kissing.
“Never mind,” Ginny’s lips curved upward slightly in the ever-so-endearing ‘ha-ha, you’ll never know, will you?’ way, and Harry knew that it was useless to try and badger her into explaining.
Then he catches sight of it, glinting off to the side of the yard. Potter hasn’t seemed to spot it yet, so he slowly drifts in that direction as they soar and dive—and then Potter
Fucking Amortentia.
“It’s none of your business!” Draco tells him, and it really
Malfoy looks even more surprised at that.
Everything slowly clicked into place as Harry realized that keeping Draco from this oblivion was more important than facing his own. Because he did love him. And it hurt deeply, so deeply that Draco wouldn’t accept it, but Harry’d only just realized it after all. He supposed it couldn’t be helped.
“Fine,” Draco mutters.
He’s the one avoiding Malfoy now, turning corners so as not to run into him in the halls and timing his bedtime to when he knows Malfoy won’t be there. Dimly, he becomes aware that Malfoy’s probably avoiding him back, but thinking about that hurts even worse so he stops.
“Okay,” Draco says, smiling back, his eyes bright as he looks down at Harry. “They’re a bit bulky. They get in the way sometimes.”
Then he leers at him and calls it “an honor”.
Draco swallows. “Tonight?” he says.
“Please...
Draco groans. Fuck. “Whatever. It’s not going to happen.”
Before Harry can speak, Malfoy looks up at him and says, in a listless voice, “I’m sorry.”
“Mother,” he says, keeping his tone light. “Would you mind if we went out to work in the garden?”
“Took you long enough.”
“Yes,” Malfoy says. “How uncouth of you.” But he slides his hand down further and palms Harry’s arse anyway, and Harry lets out a groan that very much lets on how hot he thinks that is.
He barely restrains himself from reaching behind him. There won’t be anything there, he knows, and anyway, seeing Potter like this is almost enough.
“Oh, bugger off,” Harry says, shoving him in the shoulder, which was a mistake because then Draco smirks and shoves him back, clambering on top of him, catching his wrists and—“
Draco lets out a sigh. “I ought to just make you go home,” he says, and his voice still sounds bitter.
“You’re… you’re n-not like your father,” Harry found it in himself to say. “Never…”
Draco looks unconvinced. “I suppose...”
“Did you read anything useful?” Hermione asks, taking the Butterbeer he hands her, and he nearly chokes. He’d forgotten he told her he was going to be studying.
,” Draco states firmly. He’s heard enough of Azkaban from father; witnessed the haunted look it gave him, the way he’d been almost mad with grief.
He steps through before he can chicken out.
“You were careful, though,” Harry points out.
Just Draco, lying next to him, closer than they’ve ever been.
Harry is shocked into silence.
But it’s… it’s fine. They’ll probably be put on different departmental assignments anyway. It’ll be
That was… fuck.
It’s not a no.
“We can slow down,” Draco offers.
“What do you want?” Malfoy says then, and Harry stares at him, puzzled. “Tell me,” Malfoy adds, and then it’s a command, and Harry is compelled to say something, so he says the first thing that pops into his mind—because really, it doesn’t matter, as long as it’s here with Malfoy.
“Feels good,” Harry mumbles, letting his eyes drift shut, drifting his hands down to tug at Malfoy’s hips.
Ah, fuck, his limbs are sore, his arse too, and—and Merlin.
So much for ignoring Malfoy. It’ll likely be impossible now. Fuck.
Draco’s throat goes tight. “Sentimental prat,” he mutters, trying to deflect the sudden sadness that wants to swallow him whole.
“Yeah.”
Potter nods again, reaching out for Draco’s hand, and Draco winces at the vice grip of Potter’s fingers but doesn’t complain. Potter’s
He loses himself in the rhythm of casting charms, doing several batches of items at once, then testing each one in turn and putting them on their proper shelves. His usual charms go quickly, as he knows them by heart at this point, but once he reaches the dwindling stock of automated children’s toothbrushes that he spelled onto his to-do list half a week ago, he has to lug out his big binder full of charms recipes.
He knows he’s kind of being ridiculous at this point. But more than anything, he doesn’t want to lose this new comfort he’s found being in Malfoy’s presence, this warm happiness that’s sprung up nearly out of nowhere.
When exactly did he start to fall in love?
He bloody misses it. He misses
Right. They’d
Harry almost drops the coin pouch again. “No! No. And anyway, he’s too old for you,” he says, flustered, and Esther snorts.
Harry laughs and kisses him again, kisses his cheek, his jaw. “Want to sit down?”
“You didn’t say that,” Harry contests.
“Because you’re a sap,” Draco says, pushing past Harry and into Harry’s bedroom.
“I don’t! Like I said, that has nothing to do with it!” Harry denied it quickly. “Not at all. Besides, I’m not gay.”
The words have barely come out before he slaps a hand over his mouth. He hadn’t expected something like that to come out so
—it’s still a bit tight, and, I—fuck, I want it to be you, I keep thinking about it,
He hears Mother take a shaky breath. “I know, darling,” she says, hugging him. “I know.”
And she’d caused a medical revolution. Her coworkers at St. Mungo’s had been distrustful of her methods at first, because even though the war was over, varying levels of anti-Muggle sentiment still remained. But time and time again, Hermione proved that her new kinds of spellwork were undeniably effective. It helped that at that point, Muggle ideology had finally started seeping further into Wizarding culture, and eventually Hermione was moved from the Janus Thickey Ward to a position where she could be appointed wherever she was needed.
“Careful,” Draco mumbles, putting a hand on Potter’s arm—partly out of caution and partly out of need to anchor himself.
“Stop complaining,” Draco mutters, reaching for his wand so he can spell the blanket over the damn thing. “You’re fixed now, aren’t you?”
Harry’s relieved too as he watches Ron go. He’s worried enough as it is about Ginny and Neville and Blaise, and he couldn’t bear to add Ron to that list.
“They’re still interesting to hear,” Draco says. “It’s your turn, anyhow.”
“Oh, give him some credit,” Harry says, laughing. “He’d at least try to figure out what you were doing here first.”
They sit in each other’s arms long after the Veritaserum has worn off. Harry nearly can’t believe it—that he’s sitting here now, with Draco next to him, touching him.
“No,” Potter shoots back, and picks up the bread Draco was just holding. “Take it. I don’t care.”
Draco raises an eyebrow. “You think I’d tell you?” he asks, and Harry laughs.
“Honestly? It’s probably a good idea,” Draco says. “Especially with how fast this thing is spreading. If I weren’t trying to help cure it, I’d have half a mind to stop going in too.”
“Do you know anything about Muggle science?” Draco asks, opening his own book to the first colored section.
“I swear there was another torch around here…” Hughes says to himself. “Ah, well, I expect you’ll find it at some point.” He holds out his arm. “Afraid we’ve only got one desk to spare. I’ll bring another chair over.”
Do you think Harry is all right, Hermione?" Ron asked.
"What has happened? she asked, taking off Harry's dress and shoes.
"Already? Time passes so quickly," Harry breathed as she sat down before getting up, while Hedwige returned to her perch. Here you are, beautiful," said Harry, taking a piece of meat which, she handed to Hedwige, who immediately took it to eat before settling down to eat.
"Say, who's the impartial judge?
“Oh no, not that way," said Moody.
"Due to a special event that will begin in October, continue throughout the school year, and require time and energy from the teachers. I am very pleased to announce that this year's event will take place at Hogwarts.... »
His head turned even more. Harry was completely lost. Being both hot and cold, sweat covering his forehead, and despite his shaky body, Harry got out of bed but didn't bend down to put his shoes at the foot of the bed. Heading towards the door of the infirmary, Harry held on to everything in his path to get to a floor below, the Great Hall, where everyone was for lunch.
Ron sighs and polishes off his drink. “No, I’m fine. Really. Just...people keep taking the piss, you know, and it’s nobody’s
“You’re such a knob,” Potter says fondly, but he follows Draco out of the kitchen, stopping to grab two glasses of water on his way.

He reaches for the bottle, but Draco twitches his hand instinctively and sends it sailing back to the kitchen. “Don’t jump to conclusions, Potter,” he says lowly, moving across the sofa until they’re pressed up against each other.
Harry has to close his eyes at that, and when he opens them, the look on Draco’s face...well, he can’t
“Oh,” Draco breathes, eyes flickering over his face. “You’ve finally figured it out, then.” Before Harry can ask him what he means, Draco arches his back, deliberately, and rubs his arse against Harry’s cock.
Harry snorts. “I’ve been pawning him off on Dean, truth be told. I’m far too busy and important to deal with the rookies, you know.”
about Harry all summer.
Malfoy, though—he was the only Slytherin to repeat his seventh year at Hogwarts, instead of taking his NEWTs remotely or packing off to finish abroad like the others. By all accounts, he’d kept to himself, and in return was largely left alone—Hermione had reported that the student population hadn’t quite known how to react to him, and the general consensus seemed to be that as long as he didn’t cause trouble, nobody else would either. After the school year, he’d had an incredibly public row with his parents; nobody knew what started the argument, but the pictures in the

frankly. He almost can’t believe it.
Draco catches him, and they hold each other close until they’re recovered. Potter steps back and scratches the back of his neck, laughing ruefully, but his eyes are bright, and there’s a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.
Draco looks over his shoulder, and his eyes are huge, pupils blow, and Harry groans, resisting the urge to rub against the back of his thigh. He needs to know Draco

Draco doesn’t leave him waiting for long, but Harry’s managed to work himself into a proper lather by the time Draco bursts through the building door and hustles them over to an alleyway to talk.

But then I open the paper and the proof is screaming at me from the front page—another death, another business gone under, hell, another tariff reduced on ingredients I need.

is a menace. He’s definitely guilty of having a drinking problem, if nothing else. Anything interesting come up on any of the spells?” He pulls his pyjamas off, grimacing at how grotty and sunburned he feels, and selects a new outfit. Thankfully, he and Harry plan to golf poorly enough to be dropped from the last two rounds after today, although they’ll be expected to stay at the hotel and mingle until the end of the tournament in order to avoid suspicion. At least he won’t have to be out in the sun any longer.
Then he waits. Harry needs to come to him. He’ll never manhandle Harry into this position; won’t ever

Once Draco feels a bit more in control of himself, he steps forward again, slapping Harry’s cheeks with his cock. Harry sighs and closes his eyes; the impact isn’t hard, and he probably can’t even feel it for any length of time, but it’s the closest Draco will come to actually slapping Harry across the face, which he knows Harry wants but Draco won’t do.
Harry thinks fervently, tossing it back in one go and noting the unusually pleasant minty aftertaste—the shop-bought version tastes unpleasantly of overripe fruit salad allowed to sit out in the heat for too long.
“No,” Harry says, voice a bit strangled. “Nothing outside the normal shite you hear at these sorts of things—affairs, some light money laundering, a few statements about voting that Kingsley might be interested in. Here, toss me your shirt from last night and I’ll strip the spell and store it, we can save that and anything we get from that booth for when we’re back at the office and can properly listen.”
why she asked for a break. If you keep acting like you’re just waiting it out to placate her she’s going to see right through you and you’ll never get back together. You can’t reason her into starting back up with you just because an arbitrary amount of time has gone by.”
“Ah!” Potter exclaims, springing to his feet as the door creaks open. “Excellent. Let me just check the threshold—oh,

“God help me, I do,” Harry mumbles into Draco’s neck before he drifts off.
the sight of Draco just inches away from his prick is going to make him come on the spot, and he rather suspects he doesn’t want to miss what’s on offer.

Harry’s cock, which is shining with the lube Draco carefully applied before slipping the cock ring on, is slowly getting harder under Draco’s ministrations. From his position on his knees, Draco can see Harry’s knuckles whitening as he tightens his grip on the duvet.
Draco leans back against him and closes his eyes. “Long. Cold. No thanks to you.”
There’s a low chuckle from behind him, and Harry wraps his arms around Draco’s waist. “You shouldn’t be; it’s practically tradition at this point. How was work?”
Finally, she steps back from the table, and Harry wraps the book in a tight Stasis spell before he gently rests it back on the table. “Well?” he asks tightly, glancing at Ron and Malfoy, who are both still sitting on the ground, although they look a little more alert now.

Once he gets the wardstone off the property, it’s the work of just a few minutes to crush it down to nothingness, and as he steps back into the house he’s finally able to drop his shields; as he expected, all the wonky Dark magic is gone, and all that’s left is the residual magic of the McKilips and their charmingly precocious toddler. He’s breathing much easier as he makes it back to the second-floor study, and he finds Potter still obediently sitting on the floor.
“Look, Potter. I can’t say I didn’t...see this coming, although perhaps not quite that loudly, or in public. And after talking with Ron, part of me was hoping that… Anyway. You’ve had a lot to drink. Ron’s going back with Granger tonight, I think, and you can’t get back on your own, so—”
. He doesn’t know what he’s going to claim from Harry yet, but, well...he’ll think of something.
“Very well,” Malfoy says, sitting back down and taking up his quill again. “I’ll have something on your desk by the end of today.”
Harry almost asks, but something in Draco’s voice… There’s a flat resignation there, a surrender to whatever he’s decided fate has in store for him. Harry hates it. Draco should be bright, and mean, and pushy, not...whatever this is.

They manage to get through dinner with a minimum of chaos, once Draco directs Potter firmly to the sofa and tells him to

headline and accompanying photo had been enough, thank you very much, and he’d fended off enough questions on why he was blushing so much over the idea of two men being together to last him a lifetime. He does have to admit that Malfoy gets a lot of the details of Auror investigations right, and Bill Weasley has commented on similar accuracy regarding Cursebreaking.
He watches Harry’s throat bob as he swallows, and they’re so close all it would take is one of them leaning forward a mere inch, but…

They’re on the right track, then. It’s just a matter of staying focused enough that they can gather some real evidence on Browne-Heathcote without him realising who, exactly, is on to him. Surveillance spells are fairly common at larger Wizarding events like this, so it’s likely he hasn’t connected the existence of a spell with Auror presence, but they’ll need to be even more careful now.
“Oh fuck,” Harry moans, grabbing at every bit of skin he can get his hands on. “

According to Hermione, when he’d been Turned, his magic had changed—changed in intensity, changed in feel, changed in strength—but he hadn’t noticed. Draco’s slightly-less-academic explanation, delivered in the middle of him begging for orgasm as Harry alternated between sucking him off and drinking from his femoral artery, was that Harry’s magic was simply

Harry stretches his lunch break as long as he can, but eventually he and Hermione have to make their way back to the Ministry.
“Don’t mind him, we’ll talk about that later. So, tell me, was it anything like in the book with the Aurors, you know, the one where…”
Sighing, Harry flags down a waiter and orders another two pints. He can already tell this lunch break is going to stretch longer than the hour he normally takes. “Yeah. Draco’s coming in this afternoon.”
“How much longer?” Harry asks, pleased that his voice is steady.
. I keep fucking up, and now I’m out of ingredients. Can you help?”
All those nights he’s laid in bed wondering what it would be like if he were the one making Harry sound like that, all those fantasies he put away each morning and pretended they didn’t exist; he knows now, and it was perfect, and amazing, and
list, not a bloody fleet of memos clogging up my department—and I will review and respond accordingly.”
All he can hear is a dull rushing roar, and his nose is filled with Draco’s scent—a particular intoxicating combination of fear and pain overlaying the pleasure Harry had been doing his best to deliver just moments ago, a smell that never fails to rouse him even when he’s as satiated as he currently is, a smell he’s as attuned to as the feel of his own magic sparking inside his fingertips.
finally, from nothing more than the force of his own rebounded spell. Harry shares those meetings with her easily, over wine in front of the fireplace. Later, though, he stops telling her what they’re asking about, and she’ll come downstairs to find Harry crouched in front of the fire, talking quietly with Ron and Hermione.
In the meantime, he’s more than happy to reinforce it.
looking so different from their school days, tall and wiry and…), Ron and Hermione were nowhere in sight, and Ron’s door was firmly shut and warded, and frankly, Harry hadn’t wanted to know.
Once he’s gotten Draco situated comfortably and covered in blankets, Harry steps back and simply looks at him for a moment.
“What— What do you want? What do you need? I can—tell me what I can do,” Draco says breathlessly, inching his hands down under Harry’s trousers, fingers cold on skin.

“I’m sure there will be plenty of
the only one,” an amused voice from beside him chimes in.
Almost.
“’S good,” Draco groans, and Potter’s eyelids flutter for a moment.
“Good morning,” Draco says, waving his hand at Zeller as he passes by her desk. She gives him a cheery smile in return, and he attempts to walk away before she can strike up a conversation—he’s grown fonder of her over the year he’s been in the department, but she still annoys the hell out of him sometimes.
“You’re thinking hard for someone who’s supposed to be done with his workday,” Blaise remarks from across the table, an eyebrow raised. “Anything on your mind?”
Every now and then, Malfoy’s eyes meet Harry’s, and Harry’s brain shorts out as he fights the urge to go to him, to shove the other man away and kiss Malfoy like he’s been thinking of doing for days. He’s hard, he’s so fucking hard, and he leans his shoulder against the brick wall and imagines how it would feel if it were him instead, standing there with his cock down Malfoy’s throat.
“You know what I mean,” Draco says, raising his head to look back at Harry. “Romantically.”
Harry blinks rapidly. “Huh?”
When he wakes again, Potter’s sitting up against the headboard, staring listlessly across the room.
“What is it?” Harry asks, his heart aching with every beat as he looks at the man he loves. Draco looks so small on the hospital bed, small and alone and—and Harry doesn’t want to leave him.
“You'll pass,” he says, reaching over to pat Harry's arm. The touch burns, and for once Harry is glad for the charms that obscure his own face—because that means Four can't see the sudden warmth in his cheeks.
He lets out a deep sigh. “How long?”
He doesn’t even realize Malfoy’s left until the end of the night, when he’s already long gone.
Potter frowns. “Why don’t you ever say what you’re thinking?”
now, and you won’t let me drag you to the club—”
Malfoy looks shocked. Then he frowns sharply. “That’s low, even for you.”
“No, that’s definitely true,” Harry says, laughing.
Maybe Harry’s imagining it, but it feels like there’s the smallest hint of fondness in that statement.
After a moment, she changes the subject. “It’s nice, isn’t it?” she asks, pointing further down the table.
“Malfoy,” he tries, but Malfoy kisses him again and he melts. When they break for air, he tries again—“Malfoy, wait.”
“Don’t,” Draco says desperately. “Don’t say—
Hermione makes a face. “I’ve already tried, and I don’t know if it’s possible. See, the virus isn’t targeting proteins at all—it’s targeting the DNA, and breaking it down.” She pulls out a piece of parchment to illustrate her words as she speaks. “Muggles have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Wizards and witches actually have an extra small pair—that’s where all of the genes dealing with magical core creation and maintenance are. This virus is doing something to destroy that extra set of chromosomes, but only in Purebloods.” She shakes her head, sighing. “I can only assume that there’s some small difference in the Pureblood genome that causes the virus to be able to recognize it, but I have no idea how to go about finding the exact location—there’s so much variance in that extra chromosome pair as it is.”
He shook his head, trying to head her off. “Malfoy’s just…” a great kisser, his mind supplied unhelpfully. “…aggravating, is all.”
He shuts his eyes again, but the song continues on, so he relents to the whiteness, squinting into it and wondering if he’s at King’s Cross again.
Potter’s cock too, all thick and slightly curved and gorgeous, he wants, he
After all,
“Fuck—Draco,” Harry cries out. It’s so fucking tight, and Draco’s not stopping, pressing down until Harry bottoms out inside him and almost immediately setting up a relentless pace.
“Draco,” Potter says again, and Draco has to look at him.
Fucking Blaise.
the smirk in his words. “Why yes, Potter, I think I might. After all…” He reaches around and wraps his fingers around Harry’s cock, stroking it once, and Harry fights not to whine as he bucks his hips into the touch. “You need to be taught not to go sticking your nose around like the bloody snoop you are. What better way than to give you a punishment you won’t forget?”
He walks immediately to Astoria’s room. It’s still a surprise to see it empty of all her things, even though she said it was so, and he gets the brief urge to go back and start punching Potter again.
you’re being coy. You basically asked for this,” he says, laughing when Draco bucks fruitlessly against his hand.
It’s more fervent this time on both sides, Draco crowding him against the wall and licking into his mouth, Harry clutching at Draco’s back and pulling him in tighter. Draco tastes sweet, like alcohol and honey—and then Harry can’t think anymore because Draco bites at Harry’s lip, and Harry can feel the points of his teeth and oh God, oh
Draco’s heart threatens to break, even as he draws closer and closer to orgasm. “You’re lying,” he chokes out, hand stuttering on his cock.
So he doesn’t say anything, and neither does Potter.
“You like it,” Harry says, grinning as he reaches up to stroke Draco’s wing.
, Harry,” Draco mumbles. “Keep—keep doing that.”
“Understandable,” Harry replied. “After… all that happened.”
Harry blinked. “Do what?”
“Yeah,” Draco says, a small smile on his lips as his eyes drift shut. “Me too.”
“Malfoy?” Hermione asks, turning to him. “Would you mind letting me pick your brain about potions sometime?”
Then it seems as if all the fight goes out of him, and his shoulders hunch. “Yeah,” he admits.
“The sex,” Draco surmises.
“I want...” he says, his voice rough. He can’t bring himself to finish the sentence.
“Am not,” Draco says, though he absolutely is. He spends enough time with Potter at work as it is. He can’t bear looking at his face for once moment more than he has to—
Draco snorts. “Of course that’s your reasoning.”
He hates it. He’s so fucking
“Do you ever think about dying?” Draco asks one night. It’s raining, tap-tapping on the window, and Potter’s hands are warm on his waist.
“I was thinking of leaving,” Draco says.
“I like it,” Harry says. “It makes things interesting. Also, it’s your turn.”
Harry began to tremble. He didn’t want to leave. But he couldn’t say he loved Draco, not without being able to follow through—he thought he could love him, but only in another universe where he didn’t have sadness hiding in every corner, ripping at his insides and diminishing him until he didn’t even know who ‘Harry’ was anymore. Grief had halved him as a person, making him unfit for love—even love from the only person who knew him best, who didn’t care about the dark parts inside of him.
Okay. He might owe Malfoy a favor.
Draco’s lip trembles. “Harry,” he breathes, and Harry nods above him, eyes wide, somehow looking just how Draco feels—scared and hopeful and happy all at the same time.
Eventually, Malfoy shakes his head. “I did,” he says then. “But it wasn’t... I felt terrible, for liking it.”
gift in the form of dropping Draco Malfoy on his doorstep.
Harry shivers, because God, he doesn’t think he’s ever been more turned on in his life. “If that were true,” he says, unable to keep the slight rasp out of his voice—“Would you really think it was ‘untoward’?”
Three: he’s not taking the Amortentia again. He can’t.
He brushes away fleeting thoughts of caving and sending Potter an owl. There’s no time left, and anyway, his pride won’t let him. All he can do is convince himself that he’s doing the right thing, no matter how badly he longs to be in Potter’s arms.
Then Draco slides off of the bed, walking over to the hospital window and staring outside. Harry follows, and when he gets close enough, he sees that Draco is shaking. “Oh, Draco,” he says, going and wrapping his arms around him.
Draco wishes he could leave Potter to settle in, but the moment he lets Potter go, they both wince. Potter gives him a look that says ‘
The desk beside him is still empty, of course. Potter tends to run a bit late in the mornings. It typically takes him a long while to get out of bed—especially after a night like last night.
Even now, Potter’s hand is gripping his own so hard it hurts. A punishment, he’s sure.
But it seems Adams wasn’t entirely out of earshot, because she turns around again, eyebrows raised. “Serious about what? The Amortentia? It’s not off-limits, at least not to Unspeakables. Why would it be? If anyone from the department is idiotic enough to take it after hours, at least we can study the effects later.”
“Arsehole,” Draco mutters, nevertheless throwing Harry’s shirt on the floor and tugging at the zip to Harry’s trousers.
“I really didn’t think I would, you know,” Draco says. “I always thought it was just the mate bond that was forcing me to want to be around you, but then we actually started talking and I—I fell in love.”
It’s just as warm as Harry remembered.
“Yes,” Potter says, knocking his forehead against Draco’s temple. “But so am I.”
“You make this so hard,” Potter says, and it almost sounds like he’s crying. Draco’s too much of a coward to check, or to ask what he’s on about now.
And then Malfoy starts fucking him again, but harder this time, slamming into Harry so forcefully he rocks back against the cushions with every thrust, and
Draco lies back down. At some point he
“I guess,” Draco says. Slowly, his mouth spreads into a smirk. “But either way, you’re fucking me in the morning,” he adds, looking pleased.
As dawn approaches, Harry mumbles something about showering, and Draco nods and leads Harry to the bathroom attached to his room. They step into the warm spray and hold each other close in between washing and oh, oh.
, because Harry loves him—and those feelings aren’t going to go away anytime soon.
“We can keep kissing until it fails, then,” Harry says, and Draco laughs.
“What?” Draco says, eyeing Potter.
“But—”
Draco nods his approval, and Potter smiles. Then he just sits back on his heels and stares at Draco, his pupils all blown out, the morning sunlight stretching out over his body.
Harry raises an eyebrow at him. “You’re the one who just said you loved me.”
In return, Potter reaches over and squeezes his hand from across the table, and Draco can’t fight a pleased flush.
“I don’t have to—I know you want it,” Harry tells him, forcing his voice into one that’s more authoritative, body hot with arousal as he picks up his wand. “But I’ll spell them off if I have to.”
“Yes,” Draco says hotly. “Why are you telling me all this?”
“It was,” Harry agrees, “But—you’re right, honestly. I really don’t get out much. I prefer working, and—I dunno. It’s probably because I’m lonely, like you also pointed out.” He pauses for a moment. “And by the way, I’m very annoyed with you for forcing me to think about that.”
“Oh? Being an Unspeakable must mean a lot to you then, hmm?” Malfoy says, looking as if this delights him for some bloody reason. “It’ll be my pleasure to point out every single time you fuck up, then.”
Draco wants to argue, but there’s a little piece inside of him that’s starting to realize that maybe she’s right. He thinks back over the past few years. Sometimes he barely sleeps when he thinks he’s onto something that could help her, even though it never really pans out. He threw himself into the Unspeakable program without a second thought when one of the Curse Breakers said it might be worth a shot, even though it’s well known as one of the most grueling programs in the Ministry.
He’s thankful every day that the Harry that smiles at him in the reflection, his arms warm around Draco’s waist, is as real as can be.
He can feel Draco nod. “Okay,” Draco says, and then, quietly, “I’m sorry, I suppose. About earlier.”
this, no matter how terrible the repercussions are later.
“I already told you one of mine!” Harry frowned, crossing his arms.
“Y-yeah, that’s fine,” Draco says, bucking his hips upward and making Harry moan. Draco feels around and picks up his wand, and then he casts a Lubrication Spell, and
They might just… kiss.
He sits in his desk chair and starts to read, feeling anxiety start to rear its ugly head in his chest.
But this time…
, I want—I want your fingers, p-please,” Draco babbles, gasping for air, and Potter grins and sits up. He slicks his fingers with lube and casts a subtle cleaning charm at his own mouth, and then that finger is back, running in circles around Draco’s hole and then pushing in.
“I don’t know if it would work. You’re bloody infuriating, Potter,” Malfoy’s lips puckered.
In another time, it might have annoyed Harry, if he hadn’t had those same exact thoughts many times over. It occurs to Harry then that he’s not angry Malfoy’s here anymore, not at all.
Again, Malfoy looks nervous, and Harry thinks of a time when he’d seen Malfoy crying into the sink of Myrtle’s bathroom, a time when Harry had done something absolutely unforgivable. He has to physically shake the image of Malfoy, bleeding so, so red on the bathroom floor, as far out of his head as he can get it.
“Good,” Draco says, something predatory in his eyes as he slowly fucks into him with his finger, twisting his hand and making Harry groan.
Malfoy’s the one to drop his gaze. “Come here,” he says quietly, and puts his wand on the bedside table. Harry’s gut clenches; he’d let his guard down enough that he hadn’t even realized Malfoy was holding it.
, you’ll do as I say.”
“No sugar,” Malfoy says, when Harry offers him a cuppa and the sugar bowl. “But I’ll take cream.”
“And you do realize that you two will have to remain here over the summer for training in a largely empty castle? Do you think you will be able to refrain from seriously maiming each other?”
“Piss
Potter’s fault.
Harry feels his face go red. “Why should I say it if you’re not going to believe me?”
“You’ve got to be joking,” Ron says, eyes wide.
be tossed to the Dementors.
Malfoy looks exhausted. His skin is pale, he has rings under his eyes, and he hasn’t even healed his lip from when Harry punched him last night. Harry thinks he might even be wearing the same robes as the day before, which is something he’s never known Malfoy to do. Ever.
“Oh—really?”
“Oh, it will, don’t worry,” Malfoy says, rubbing the head of his cock back and forth against Harry’s arsehole, making him groan. “You’re going to look so good on my cock, Potter,” he murmurs—and the near reverence in his voice shows that this isn’t just some sort of game, or a fucked up power play. It means Harry can close his eyes and bask in the fact that Malfoy wants this just as much as Harry does.
“About doing it, just now?” Harry asks. “Or... or about wanting it again?”
Or, no, it’s not blank, he realizes, as he walks over to pick it up. His eyes widen as he reads what it says, once, then over again.
He shivers a bit in anticipation, climbing onto the bed with his arse in the air, hands splayed into the sheets beneath him. ‘
“I want to be nice,” Potter says, and starts sliding his finger out, then in again. “You’re letting me inside you.”
He is silent for a moment. “Nothing,” he says quietly, upon thinking about it. “Nothing is happening.”
“Is that a bad thing?”
“No, no, it’s fine,” Potter says, downing another swallow. “Really. I’ll need it if I want to dance at all.”
, and even worse—
Malfoy puts his forehead in one hand, letting out an exasperated sigh. “Salazar, he’s wasting his life away! Pitiful!”
Malfoy shifts, looking uncomfortable. “I can leave.”
“Fine,” Malfoy says, and then he curls closer, into Harry’s touch, and ah—
Harry can’t help a surprised burst of laughter. “I couldn’t imagine you eating a hamburger.”
“I can’t really say too much about specific patients. Healer confidentiality and all that,” Hermione says, sounding serious. “But we had quite a few people showing up today with really awful symptoms.”
Draco always,
And he would feel mortified except that Potter is hard too. Draco can feel his prick through their trousers, and suddenly he can barely breathe with the amount of
“Maybe I do,” Harry says, leaning his head against Draco’s. “But so do you.”
“I basically told you I’ve fancied you for years, and yet you’re still shocked?” Draco says, grinning at him mischievously. “Merlin, you must be just as thick as I always used to think you were.”
Because usually she’s right, he thinks, deep in the back of his mind.
, the way Potter cried in his arms, the way he kissed him so softly Draco almost could have believed Potter was in love with him—the way he looks now, as if he’s going to just take whatever Draco throws at him.
“They couldn’t. I’d stop them,” Harry countered.
Finally Draco pulls back, and when Harry blinks his eyes open, Draco’s face is red, his lips parted, eyes locked on Harry.
Draco wants to scream.
His second choice of rotation doesn’t matter nearly as much, but it still makes his heart flip in his chest as he writes the word, “
“But?” Draco asks, making a very bad effort at hiding how terrified he feels.
“But that’s boring,” Draco says broodily. “Everyone knows what your dating life is like—you snogged Chang back in third year, and then there was Ginny Weasley of course, and then you decided you weren’t into women and stopped dating entirely.”
It feels like everything else in the room falls away.
“We share a workplace,” Malfoy says. “I wouldn’t say I work with her, per se, but I see her around occasionally.”
Harry thinks about it for a moment. Then he swallows against the embarrassment that creeps up in his chest, shifting nervously. “No,” he says. “I suppose I’d probably... say you as well.”
“You’re going to make me think about sex whenever we’re in close proximity to a broom closet,” Draco says, glaring at him. “Very inconvenient.”
Harry’s throat feels a little dry, and he coughs. “You could say that. We were in the same class at Hogwarts. We weren’t friends, though.”
And so things get a little more complicated.
“What—what is it?” Harry asks, breath ragged. Lust is spiraling through every bone in his body, urging him onward, making his chest burn and his erection throb, but just for a moment he pauses just to admire how lovely Draco looks like this.
Harry nods shakily and climbs over him and presses in as slowly as he can bear—
, messy hair and slight slouch and all
“No!” Malfoy bites out. “It’s
“Who is it?” Draco asks, leaning toward him in interest, and suddenly Harry is even warmer than before. Maybe he should switch to drinking water.
Fuck. Harry was most definitely fucked, because a shock of heat swept through his body, ending decidedly in his groin. Merlin, he hadn’t felt wanting like this since Ginny, since before he’d been broken and reborn—
Damn Malfoy. Always mucking up Harry’s life. At least Harry won’t be running into him any time soon—there aren’t any Ministry events on his calendar for months, and at any rate, he doubts Malfoy will step foot into his store again.
After several moments of snogging he finally remembers, and he Apparates them into his living room mid-kiss, the crack barely audible against the heavy beating of his heart. “Fuck,” he says, grinning at the sight of Draco in his flat. “I’m so glad you’re here.”
“Well, it
For a moment Potter looks hesitant. Then he reaches out and starts to rub Draco’s back again, and Draco has to hide his shock, even as he can’t resist leaning into it.
And Harry is left here, alone, with no way to return home.
“But you do it anyway.”
“Potter,” Draco says, nudging Harry’s elbow, and Harry turns away from the conversation Ron and Hermione are having—he’d only been half listening anyway.
“You’re not asleep,” Potter grumbles from behind him, and Draco realizes with a start that he’s gone all tense.
Then they Apparate home.
Then he leans down and kisses Harry, slides a hand down Harry’s stomach, and takes his cock in hand.
“It’s undignified.”
Except he can’t.
“Well, why aren’t
“Sure,” Harry says, watching as Hermione spells a good-bye note for Ron onto a scrap of parchment on the table and then heads out the door.
Fuck.
“Make me,” Harry says again.
Potter nods. “I assumed as much,” he says. “But I don’t know how to fix it.”
“I sure hope so,” Ron says, sighing. “Oh, hullo, Harry.”
“If that’s enough to call me mad, then I’d take it any day,” Harry tells him seriously, pulling back to look at him.
“Come sit down,” Harry says. “I have something for you.”
The hole in his chest tears itself wide open, and he gasps for air—it’s like when Astoria left, only
The opening ceremonies had taken an entire day, with a speech from Minister Shacklebolt himself ending the first bout of formalities. Then, there was food everywhere, in quantities larger than three Hogwarts feasts combined. Harry was sure he had heard Hermione muttering under her breath about “those poor house elves!”
Before he can protest, she walks away with a wave of farewell, darting past the edges of the Muffliato.
Draco—”
“You? Wanting to talk logistics instead of rushing into something? I never thought I’d see the day,” Draco says, managing to sound mocking despite his swollen lips and flushed cheeks.
“Did anyone ever tell you that you’re a sap, Potter?” Malfoy asks. He’s staring at where their fingers are intertwined with an almost bewildered expression that makes Harry want to laugh.
But he’s made the unfortunate mistake of forgetting that he’s on Veritaserum.
“Yeah, I sort of forgot about that. Thanks, though,” he replied, swallowing nervously. Now that he thought about it, sharing one’s food seemed far more romantic than he’d first anticipated, making him anxious for a very different reason.
It’s a miracle Mother was spared. For that at least, he’s grateful.
Draco lets out a soft huff of laughter. “Fair,” he says, and then he presses himself closer to Harry.
They lapse into brief silence, and as the sudden surprise wears off, Draco has the clarity to fully appreciate that Potter is
“Being cagey, hmm?” Malfoy says, leaning into his ear, and Merlin, he’s so close. “I bet that means it’s true.”
“Repeat after me,” the stern-sounding Unspeakable in front of him says. The Identity-Masking Charms shimmer over her face, distorting the very air in front of her, and it only adds to the eerieness of the moment.
“Then let me be your friend,” Harry says, and Draco looks up at him then. “Truly, this time. Nothing else.” It hurts to say it. But it hurts less than it would to leave Draco behind.
Harry chuckles, and Malfoy shoots him a glare. “Come off it, Potter.”
touch Potter again. He shouldn’t
“I love you,” Harry says, and he tilts his head up to kiss Draco’s nose as Draco smiles. Then Harry grins. “You know, you
“If this is your way of apologizing, I should let you be rude to me more often,” Harry says, feeling a little smug.
Malfoy lets out a long sigh. “Painting is complex.”
“Not at all,” Draco says, and then quirks his head. “So—
He’s too overly aware of the fact that Malfoy’s body is so close to his. It doesn’t help that they’re facing one another, and—and maybe it’s because of his stupid overreaction after their argument earlier, but he can’t help but find himself wanting to touch Malfoy. And not in a platonic way either.
Potter picks up his tea and sips it. Then he lets out an approving moan, and Draco pretends that he’s not infuriatingly, deeply aroused by the sound. “You got the sugars right,” Potter says, grinning.
“I agree,” Hermione says, reaching over to pat Harry’s arm. “I won’t tell him either, but—we do both care about you, Harry. If you ever need to talk, I’m listening.”
This is all Potter’s fault, Draco thinks, as he watches Potter’s hex go wide, as the pile of Neville’s strange fan mail in the corner explodes.
Green is the color of Potter’s eyes as Potter slowly starts to let him in.
“Draco,” Harry says, and then presses his lips to Draco’s mouth in a chaste kiss. “I loved it. And I’d do it again—you seem to have forgotten that I’m the one who suggested it.”
“It is. I’ve ridden it a few times, but only when necessary—I wouldn’t do it otherwise,” he scrunches his nose. Draco takes the opportunity to try and kiss him, and Harry caves momentarily, relenting for a few seconds before breaking it. “Stop, I’m telling a story!”
“Lie down mate...I’m going to get you some tea. Come on...careful.”
He wrote a letter to Ron the next morning.
Even the head healer, an elderly lady with a piercing voice, didn’t have the slightest idea what caused the condition. However she was able to dissolve the suspicion of the Portuguese Head Auror that Ron had caused the magical disease.
“Purebloods always marry hetero even if they’re preferring the same sex, Potter. We can’t afford having even less children in the next generation if we don’t want to die out completely.”
Holding Ron with one arm and carding his hand through the sweaty, red strands Harry became very much aware of the fact that he was just wearing pyjama trousers and his wand was still with his work gear at home.
“Honestly, he’s just a normal kid. He’s polite but also liked to play Quidditch with the other sprogs….and that’s because he thinks its FUN, Draco...not because of your stupid reasons like betting money or financial gamble or being cheered on by big masses...just a couple of kids playing for fun in the garden.”
He fell asleep only a few minutes later.
Lost in thought Harry clicked the switch a few times and let the ceiling light disappear and come back few times.
“Ron...I don’t want to marry him, I just like...”
doesn’t seem
Draco took another sip from his glass before continuing his story.
It was odd.
He probably shouldn't be here without magical protection gear he thought and dismissed the possibility  to come back with better equipment right away. Ron needed him.
Which they had been for weeks.
In the early morning hours Crinkle, the Head of the Portuguese Heads of the Department for International Crime and Law Enforcement arrive followed by a small shifty man, that Harry expected to be a translator. Finding they resting in the same position. Ron’s still sleeping, but he he must have felt the presence of the arriving wizard since he looped the black arm-tentacles a bit more forceful around Harry ribcage.
Around three in the morning he gave up.
It didn’t matter if he was burying his face into Ron’s pillow or wearing one of his friend’s knitted jumpers while hie rubbed himself raw. No one was there to judge him. He didn’t care that the faceless men in his fantasy featured freckled skin and easily could hold him down. Gentle, safe but powerful. Big callused hands and strong arms and legs...beautiful in a completely different, natural way to the carefully manufactured elegance of Draco.
To be honest he wasn’t sure he cared about anything any more.
He didn’t care about not seeing the person Draco Malfoy though.
“hm...”
He didn’t like how Ron’s writing looked too. Ron’s handwriting was positively messy and scratchy on a good day but this seemed like he’d been having difficulties holding a pen. There was blotches of ink and something  unidentifed...black and crusty on the paper and it didn’t help a single bit to curb Harry’s worry and he told his friend so in a quite rushed letter before he had to go to the courtroom.
“Shut up, Harry.” hissed Ron curtly and blindly grabbed his chair to sit down again. Harry saw the way Ron moved like big cat waiting to jump on his prey. Like he was in the mood to play with it. “Let the inbred boy eat with us. He probably is all alone now that his Mummy and wife died and his Daddy is in Azkaban and his inbred lonely child is off to school.” there was a coldness in his voice that Harry’d only very rarely heard at work.
After a few days without an answer he got really drunk in a bar in London and woke up the next day in a strange bed with a strawberry blond man. The man didn’t laugh about Harry’s jokes and Harry thought he was kinda dumb but the sex was okay and it was better than staying at home and being constantly reminded how lonely he was.
“H’rry...” Ron rasped again and he sounds so weak and helpless and it’s not what Harry is used to. Ron, even during the war, even when everything seemed hopeless and like they’d never manage long enough to grow into adulthood, had always been the strong one. The one to adapt the quickest, who kept them together and worked on keeping them emotionally capable and finding practical solutions.
And maybe this was when it started to get weird between them.
After finding out that Hermione hadn’t gotten a letter for two weeks in a row either. He decided that something must be wrong because Ron might be sometimes a little forgetful, but he’s loyal and likes to routinely keeping check of his family and friends. Ron would never stop communicating without a good reason.
“So there are people like you that marry out of love, huh.” Harry muttered finally breaking the quiet.
Ron usually was the one to take care of
“You’re welcome, Potter.” smiled the blond sweetly before he made his way to the door leading inside the living room. “You also want another whiskey?”
The black substance was glued to the head so much that it took Harry a moment to notice, that this person was smaller than his friend, that it wasn’t Ron who fighting for his life right there on the tiled floor of a Muggle kitchen.

it, is the thing. It was meant to insult, meant to sting Harry into lashing out so she could keep screaming at him until they got all of this nastiness out of their systems and could work through whatever’s going wrong between them, but instead Harry’s face goes white, and he says nothing at all, and Ginny suddenly feels unmoored, as if she’s going to fall down if she doesn’t grab hold of something.

so, Potter,” Draco snaps, striding to a couch pushed up against a wall and Levitating it out of the way. “Charming as always, I see. It’s under the floorboard over here; don’t come closer, I need to focus. Just be ready with a Stasis once I get it out.”
It’s when Potter’s almost fallen down the stairs for the third time that Draco begins to think that maybe the spell had done something after all.
He doesn’t need to finish his sentence, though, because just then the Floo flares, and Ron’s voice is heard calling, “Cheers, mate!” before he whirls into view and steps out of the grate, brushing ash off his shoulders and Vanishing it before it hits the carpet. He’s slightly pink, and he’s got dark circles under his eyes, but he’s—smiling? “Harry! Hermione! Merlin, did you invite over the entire Trainee class? Who’s all this food for?”

Their partnership isn’t widely-known outside the DMLE, so when Harry bumps into Draco at some point during the night, they’re able to manufacture a convincingly polite scene that anyone who knows they’re distant coworkers would expect. Draco finds his eyes tracking to Harry all night, though, and his ears seem fine-tuned to pick up on Harry’s laugh.
“Yeah,” he says eagerly, glancing back at his desk. “Yeah, I just… There are a few things I need to finish up here, but I’ll be up soon.”
Draco sighs impatiently and slaps the paper down onto his desk. “Of

It was like a numbness that could only be pierced by some people.
“The Weasleys and Malfoys originate from neighbouring villages in Devon and in the past they married so often among each other that they were often treated as a single family by other purebloods...a lot of my ancestors have the same red hair you know...” He took a sip of his outrageously expensive whiskey.
Not only did he know his friend better than anyone else, Ron hadn’t tried to be a good supportive husband for years to not know every household charm they could ever need and he wouldn’t be Molly Weasley’s child he wouldn’t know how to cook in the way Harry liked it the most.
“You are still seeing the ferret?” Ron spat putting his glass down with more force than needed leaving puddles of beer on the scarred wood of the pub table.
Harry felt like throwing up.
He stood up from his chair and leaned over the marble railing to look into the small nightly park beneath the balcony.
As a true auror and with the skills of a small brother who had to compete with much stronger and more experienced older siblings for his transformativ years...Ron went for what hurt his opponent the most. Without any remorse he went for Draco’s emotional balls so to speak.
“Can you tell him, that I miss him and he’s not allowed to pull some dumb shit while I’m not around?” he requested the head of the international department and the old man chuckled and nodded before slowly shuffled back to his office again.
“He was distressed and when I arrived he was covered in tentacles and coin-sized blistered.” he answered kind of truthfully with the weight of the deluminator in his the pocket of his black-stained pyjama trousers.
Harry around.
Ron’s icy laugh disrupted him.
A week after he sent the letter to Ron an unknown owl had landed clumsily on his breakfast table and he almost crashed his tea cup in the hurry to free the paper scroll from her talons.
Following a whim he put down the barely-touched meal on the coffee table and padded towards Ron’s room.
Living with Ron was easy too.
“I’m sorry, Ron. It was really spontaneous. I didn’t feel like I was fit to apparate tonight so my place was closer.” this was obviously the wrong answer because Ron lifted on eyebrow, a gesture he’d clearly acquired from his marriage with Hermione, and pursed his lips visible trying to get a reign on his temper.
It almost looked as if Malfoy is pouting.
At some point Ron had opened his eyes, but he stayed quiet mostly just sometimes throwing out short, hoarsely sentences when asked directly. Obviously fighting to focus enough, clearly in pain Ron did still his best to do his job and Harry was torn between pride, worry and the seething anger that his friend had to suffer like that.
Harry padded closer and it felt oddly vulnerable to be barefoot in this situation. “Ron...please...” his friend came so abruptly to his feet that the chair slammed backwards against the heater with a loud bang towering over both Draco and Harry in all his almost 2 meters of boiling anger.
“I’m not going to supervise every step of my men in their free-time. They deserve some privacy.” huffed Crinkle and sat down on one of white waiting room chairs beside them and crossing his locust-like legs.
“Don’t you dare to speak about my family like that...” croaked the blond. “Don’t call me that, Weasley, I warn you, I’m gonna...”
It were disgustingly superficial letters and Harry hated them a little, but they were the only thing that still felt like a connection to his best mate so he always waited for the letter to arrive eagerly ripping it from the mail owl’s talon.
“No no no...I need you to stay awake, make...” Harry rocked him in his arm slightly to make sure he was still conscious as he blindly fumbled on the table top to get Ron’s wand.
Harry didn’t care.
After two beers he made his way to the bedroom and changed into Ron’s pyjama trousers. They were too long for him but they were well-worn and soft.
He wasn’t at home when Harry returned a few hours later.
Ron took the memory vial and Harry for a short moment thought he should probably try to find out was this was about, but he forgot about it just as quickly as Ron stood up. Like Harry’s last sentence was what had brought some kind of decision. He nodded decidedly and made his way to the door of Harry’s office.
It wasn’t until noon that finally,
They tried the usual and pretend it didn’t happen. Harry was sure Ron assumed that the thing with Malfoy was a one-time thing and he really didn’t want to ever see him like this again so he would rather eat a flubberworm than tell him it was regular thing.
He doesn’t need more brothers and Harry’s not like them. It was like a punch in the liver the first time Ron said it. Harry needs Ron’s bluntness to tether him down to earth but sometimes it does leave some bruises.
Harry wasn’t exactly sure when it started.
There was an air of finality around him as he rounded the desk and sat on the edge of the tabletop looking down on Harry.
He didn’t write about work.
Lucky for the deluminator Harry still had his seeker-like reflexes so the tiny artefact landed safely in his hand.
Ron had turned his face away and Harry almost suspected he was crying. “I took you into my apartment and defended you against my brothers and made sure you had a place to regroup and be safe...and you tell me you’re into blokes like it’s some kind of bloody new discovery.” Harry wanted to touch him, do something to stop Ron from shuddering under all that emotion but something kept him glued to his chair.
It wasn’t the first time a Weasley packed the bags on him. This one hurt much more than when his ex-wife had done it though.
It had been a big mess but after he’d moved in for good into Ron’s small past-divorce apartment in London (Though the divorce of Harry’s two best friends had been only a fraction as messy as his own, they too had decided that Hermione fit better with someone that was willing to support her in the way she needed it.) he thought things could finally mellow down and he’d at least have some time to figure out what he wanted to do with his life now that his big dream of a life with a family like from a children’s book had train-wrecked in the most epic way.
card.
“There’s something wrong.” he said and his throat feels raw from the lack of use.
Too still even in slumber. Dark veins under translucent skin, black tentacles limply surrounding his thin upper body and his dry mouth open in silent agony. Someone had propped him up in a half-seated position to make sure he wouldn't choke on his own vomit.
If he could he went to a club to find company.
Harry could feel Ron growing dangerously still beside him and closed his eyes to brace himself for the inevitable.
Things still seemed okay when he started to go to pubs more and have some random dates. It was a nice ego boost and Harry felt like he could concentrate better on his job when he didn’t ignore his physical needs completely, like it had been with Ginny for a long time. Maybe it was also the lack of marriage related stress, however he finally managed to secure the head auror’s position he’d be working towards for years after Robard’s retired to enjoy his remaining limbs and his granddaughters growing up.
Ron wouldn't lean so far away against the balustrade on some cold balcony and tell him about things that Harry didn’t care for. Ron’s warm shoulders would bump against his as they sat on their old ratty couch as he wittily commented the game on the radio.
In those nights Harry didn’t sleep and stared at the ceiling of Ron’s room.
Harry was at his side before he could think about it.
So...Draco called Ron's best friend a slut, Ron a fairy thus insulting his masculinity, made fun of his big family especially his baby sister and of the fact that  they used to be very poor. It must be a special talent to push all of Ron’s buttons at the same time.
In his own bed because Hermione had told him that he had no right taking Ron’s bed. It didn’t feel like she was wrong, but being in his own bed which felt unfamiliar and cold in comparison he could find a good position. He rolled from one side to the other, but he just couldn't get rid  of his restlessness.
Squinting into the into the thick fumes wafting lazily through the air he saw the traces from a magical ritual. Different kinds of herbs were burned in little ceramic bowls clumsily painted with runes and there was a circle painted on the floor of the quite spacious kitchen dimly lit by the flickering lights of a microwave. In the middle of the circle was a heap of human, unmoving except for the weak breath filling the ribcage every few seconds.
“Ron...” Harry tried but was disrupted by Neville who looked oddly scandalised.
Sometimes the deluminator stayed quiet when he clicked them in the night, when his loneliness became to much to bear.
The guy spend his free-time reading financial magazines for fun.
He knew Harry needed his blunt honesty much more than politeness. The mutual respect build on decades of friendship and willingness to give your life for the other didn’t need superficial pleasantry.
“Bride prices can be pretty expensive and it’s still a very common way among the old families to secure real estate.It okay to have a few sons that you’ve gotta pay houses for if you’ve got also daughters that bring property back into the family. With no daughters though and a lot of male children that wanted to have a family, the Weasleys had a hard time financing all of them which led to them having less and less influence among the leading families.”
Harry was just pushing aside another box of unmatched socks when a small glinting something almost feel down on the floor.
It wasn’t that he exactly liked Draco and he sure as hell didn’t trust him much further that he could throw him...but maybe he did grow onto him a little.
To be honest Ron’s cooking was much better than Ginny’s who didn’t have the patience to cook for longer than fifteen minutes. Ron was better wife-material than his actual (ex)wife when it came to domestic skills...at least if you bracketed out the physical parts...Harry really didn’t want to think about that. It always made him feel a little queasy. When he mentioned it to Ron once as a joke, the redhead threatened to hex his balls off.
Ron’s cold laugh cut like a knife.
It wasn’t like Ron to let his room become so chaotic.
He forgot how long he stared down on the empty paper and he wished Ron would just come home, so he could tell he him in person that he was sorry.
Draco put down his glass on top of the stone railing and stubbed out his cigarette.
He liked Quidditch because of the financial struggle between the different clubs and because he liked being cheered on by hundreds of people.  Harry would have even accepted if he’d said he liked it for the hot men on brooms...but Draco genuinely didn’t care about the game itself being fun. Even if he hadn’t been one of history's biggest knobheads in their youth...even if Draco had been a Gryffindor like him, Harry doubted that they’d have been friends in school, seeing how different their interests were.
Ron turned around to look at him and his eyes dry.
He knocked before entering his room and made sure to always be out of the flat when Harry mentioned someone was coming over.
He just somehow slid into it and it seemed much more comfortable than his straight life with Ginny.
With a soft hum of magic a blue ball of light gently floated through the air until it disappeared in his ribcage and deep intuition settled in his heart.
“Y’re h’re...” sobbed Ron and Harry hurried to assure him that, of course, he was there and wouldn’t go anywhere which threw Ron into another crying fit.
“Septima Malfoy who’d been already engaged with Albfrid Weasley was married off to Callus Burke instead and before she took her own life she cursed the Weasleys so that they wouldn’t be able to give birth to any girls for seven generation to remember her name and tragic loss of her love.”
“Ron’s not writing any more.”
So Harry made himself some tea and took out parchment and quill and put the pen to the paper and...there’s no words. He didn’t get past
They’d become such constant in Harry’s life that it throws him off the train for a whole week and it took him a long talk with Neville (who’d slowly grown into Harry’s voice of reason, now that Ron is not there to remind him how to be human) and several emergency lunch breaks with Hermione to get back on track and notice that when their best friend writes them, normal people write back.
“You up for another round before I go home?”
His white blond hair was standing out like a second moon in front of the dark, starless sky.
When did Ron start thinking that they, that Harry didn’t need him any more?
Harry mumbled a curse under his breath. He remembered a time when Ron never left the house without the deluminator tugged into the pocked of his jeans. It  had never been necessary after the war but he assumed Ron felt more secure knowing that he would be able to get to his friends as fast as possible in case they ever needed his help.
“Well…” Hermione huffed exasperatedly propping up the overflowing washing basket on her hip. “I’m glad you’re finally noticing
“Hello, Harry.” she said softly and looked at him in a confusing mix of worry and indignation.
“Ron has a soft spot for him because he’s smart and likes chess...” he almost laughed at the surprise ghosting over Draco’s. “Ron always liked the smart ones…honestly it’s pretty funny seeing him doting on the kid and being all patient and fatherly while the actual father of the boy is probably the most likely candidate to publicly get in a row with Ron.”
“Neville...it’s not like that… it’s not like we’re are dating or something… it’s just sex, mate...”
Harry had never really expected himself to be interested in blokes but it wasn’t a big shock either. Of course he had homosexual fantasies (it was hard not to have them, as a horny teenager sharing a dorm with Dean Thomas) before his unplanned ...uh...
As soon as the night came though, Ron’s tired and desperate voice filled the room and Harry knew his friend wasn’t okay and he was helpless and everything hurt...and he did nothing and fell asleep to Ron talking to a stranger.
In August Ron’s letters broke off suddenly.
It was unusually messy. Ron had so much things. He liked collecting all kinds of stuff. Quidditch merchandise, cards, comics and (since the marriage with Hermione) books so it was normal to see the room brimming over with things. Ron was usually really proud of everything having it’s place and being very well-organised though.
The human pile was covered in a black-iridescent tar-like substance and a disgusting amount of black grubs the size of his forearm sluggishly wriggled on the drenched shirt and around the head.
Draco chuckled and leaned back in his chair, arms crossed in front of his chest and grinning broadly into Ron’s red face. The guy obviously greatly enjoyed the show and had less self-preservation instinct than a dead fish.
“Having many children is preferable for families like mine but sadly the Blacks as well as the Malfoys didn’t have the best health in the last generations letting the generations grow smaller and smaller...most pureblood families have that problem sadly...except the Notts and the Weasleys of course.”
Harry wasn’t sure when he’d stopped to care about people...or if he ever cared for more than just the handful of people that he claimed as his surrogate family...Hermione, Ron, his children, Neville, Luna, the Weasleys...he did care in some way. He wanted the wizard world to be good and children and people to be safe and healthy...but he didn’t care about those people specifically.
With a slam of the door Ron was gone. A couple of sickles were left behind to pay for the beer.
Regarding his job Ron rarely did things just
Harry didn’t know who Ron was talking to, but it felt like he was talking to him and as he listened to snippets of Ron’s speech and sounds of boiling water he sat on the floor beside the bed, leaned his back against the frame and dozed off.
He missed having a place to go on weekends and not being completely alone in an empty flat.
On Wednesday Hermione stood at the foot-end of the bed and forced him to get up and take a shower.
Giving up on the night he drank a few beers and as he leaned back against the headboard of Ron’s bed he tried to remember when was the last time he slept in his own room.
He missed sex.
“To be honest, I asked yesterday about his well-being, Mr. Crinkle, and you said he was fine.
Draco stretched out cat-like in the bed with a sly smile. Hermione would probably say some like that he looked exquisite with his champagne skin against the black silken sheets. She always liked big words like that. Harry thinks he looks pretty hot on a superficial level...he’d look better when he didn’t have such a shitty personality though.
Draco sounded surprised.  As if from his own childhood experience he didn’t expect people to actually not care much about his son’s family background and just...treat him as a normal child.
Ron said, the hand already on the door handle and it sounded like a farewell.
Hermione once said, that Draco was a bit like a very small dog in that he was more bark than bite. He liked to talk loud but he wasn’t actually the type who’d go for a serious conflict...it was just that he sometimes forgot that he was a small little dog because he was able to spook people when he barked loud enough.
when his subordinates were in a life-threatening situation. That’s what health-supervision charms and the big charmed maps in the head office were for after all.
Harry emptied his glass and came to his feet.
Ron wouldn’t lecture him about pureblood history or the importance of the upkeep of proper school clothing in Hogwarts.
Draco had just lost his wife and was not ready to have a serious anything with anyone and somehow the decidedly non-romantic nature of their relationship was really relaxing.
“I tried so hard, Harry.” Ron pressed out his whole body convulsing under the emotion. “I tried to be a good f...friend. I tried to be so bloody supportive...and you fuck Malfoy while I’m sleeping just on the other side of that wall. Not only that, you didn’t even feel like you needed to inform me...that I deserved to get perhaps a little warning instead of having him insult me, you and my whole family at the breakfast table.”
"Hagrid... Take young Potter to the infirmary, said Dumbledore.
Draco returned to the classroom while Professor Snape went to warn Dumbledore. Madame Pomfrey, meanwhile, was busy with Harry...
"I...! I...!
When teachers and students saw the golden trio arrive, silence fell immediately as all eyes turned to Hannah standing among her friends at the entrance. Not daring to take a step to sit at their respective table, Hannah felt her hands tremble at the glances she was receiving from people whispering in the room. Hermione on her right reacted and placed her hand on her friend's cheek to get her attention.
" Well? Nothing," said Pompom as she got up.
"Finally! Harry thought.
"Come on, be brave. You can do it," she whispered to herself in front of her reflection.
"The password? she asked.
Hannah was just finishing putting on her pyjamas after dinner when knocks were heard. Wearing a pair of black slippers, she opened the door behind which she saw her friends. Hannah knew something was up when she saw the looks on their faces and let them in. The three of them settled down on Hannah's bed, and Hannah leaned against the head of the bed.
“Dumbledore, Potter," said Fudge as a greeting.
The walk to the Great Hall seemed far too long for him. Harry was on the verge of fainting when he arrived at the Great Hall, where the hubbub was going on, and then disappeared when they all saw a girl with curly black hair falling into the crotch of her loins, dressed in the boys' outfit, pale complexion and feverish emerald eyes, her breath jerky, leaning with one hand on the door to his right. The teachers, seeing his condition, stood up, intrigued.
The portrait then opened to make way for Harry’s new room. A wardrobe and a single bed and the Edwidge cage are against the wall to their left, while the fireplace is opposite. There is a desk at the back of the room next to a door leading to the bathroom. They entered the room and put the bags next to the wardrobe.
"They can't do this! We're going to be seventeen in April, why can't we be a part of it?
The director observed her for a moment before leaving his office to go to the Great Hall where the pupils were heading. Hannah, for her part, waited about ten minutes with Fawkes before leaving the headmaster's office to go to her room.
"Professor McGonagall, young lady, good morning.
While her eyes stand out much more than before with her curly hair framing her face, which has become thinner and her skin paler than it used to be, Harry watched every change in her body as her waist and hands became thinner. As her breasts became voluminous, Harry put on a bra and briefs and put on black trousers and a short-sleeved Victorian-style purple shirt. Harry decided to dry his hair and let it fall back before going back to his room again to fall back on his bed when knocks came at the door. Getting up, Harry put on a pair of black shoes and opened the door to see his two best friends.
After making dinner and doing the dishes, Harry went up to his room, sat down on his bed and watched his owl sing.
“Come in," says Professor Snape sharply.
Returning to her room, Hannah finally took her new school outfit out of the wardrobe and changed into trousers instead of the usual skirt that the girls wear when knocks at the door were heard. A slight smile appeared on her lips when she saw her friends after opening the door.
Harry followed McGonagall to Hogsmeade. There, McGonagall took Harry to Madame Malkin’s store. Once inside, the owner of the premises approached them.
It was with these words that Dumbledore left the infirmary, leaving Harry in the care of Madame Pomfrey.
“Don't do that, my boy!”
Putting on his clothes from the night before, Harry joined his teacher after putting on his witch doctor's robe. When Harry came out of the infirmary, he couldn't help but stop.
"Only two weeks left, Hedwige... Only two more and we can finally go back to Hogwarts. "He said before he changed and went to bed, turning off the bedside lamp.
Waking up to the glow of dawn seeping through her bedroom window, Hannah emerged from her bed little by little. It was with difficulty that she got out of bed knowing what was waiting for her in the Great Hall, while Hedwig hulled for a moment before leaving when Hannah opened the window for her. Heading to the bathroom, Hannah washed her face and brushed her hair to decide to keep it loose on her back before standing in front of the mirror for a moment.
They arrived in front of a sturdy doorway, where there was a portrait of a man with thin, elongated features. Seeing the man with long hair and ebony eyes, Harry immediately thought of her potion teacher.
It was on his words that Draco walked away from his comrades to go to bed and sleep while looking forward to having fun doing Potter dirt.
With those words, the boys also separated, promising to send each other cards. Harry had taken his things and Hedwige before heading back to " the house " or rather to the Dursleys. Upon his return, Harry returned to his old routine of housework and meal preparation. Every day passed tirelessly as long days for him, but the letters his friends sent him during the holidays comforted him and made him spend his days not brooding.
The teacher gave her a reassuring smile before leaving the room. Finding herself alone, Harry decided to put away his new clothes. When she finished putting away her clothes, she took one of her new pairs of pyjamas and some underwear and headed to the bathroom.
"I know many people want to be champions, but the three competing schools, in agreement with the Ministry of Magic, felt it prudent to impose new rules this year regarding the age of the candidates. In view of the difficulty of the tasks imposed, which will remain dangerous despite the precautions taken, only students who have reached the age of majority can submit their names for selection. I will personally ensure that no student who is a minor can cheat. As I told you, the delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstang will arrive in October. I would therefore like you to show them courtesy throughout their stay. All right now, everybody goes to bed!”
Running breathlessly through the empty corridors of the castle leading to her bedroom, Hannah hurriedly opened the door to her room before closing it behind her and removing her cloak of invisibility to lean against the door.
Meanwhile, Harry's friends on their way to their next class were worried about their friend.
When she emerged a good half hour later, Harry stood in front of the mirror and watched her reflection while touching her facial features.
They continued up to the Gryffindor Tower, the entrance to which was guarded by a fat lady in a silk dress in a painting.
Once at the Ministry, Dumbledore went to Minister Fudge's office, followed by Hannah. When they reached the door of Minister Fudge's office, Fudge let them in and sat down on the chairs facing the desk.
"Weasley! Hey, Weasley!" shouted Malfoy to attract his attention with Crabbe and Goyle coming behind him.
Waking up with difficulty the next morning after a very difficult night filled with nightmares, Harry sat on the edge of the bed provided for her the previous day by the director, her long hair falling down his lower back. Forcing herself to get up, Harry got up before taking some clothes and underwear from her new purchases and went to the bathroom. Removing the pyjamas that Professor McGonagall had advised her to take to be comfortable, Harry stood naked in front of the bathroom mirror. Not wanting to look again in the reflection of her new appearance, Harry ran the bath water and rushed in when the water came close to the rim.
"I present to you, Mr. Maugrey, who will be our new teacher of defence against the Dark Arts. Well, as I was about to tell you, we are going to have the honour of welcoming to our institution in the coming months an event that we have not seen for nearly a century. I am pleased to announce that this year's Three Wizards Tournament will take place. Some of you don't know what this Tournament is all about. The Three Wizards Tournament is a friendly competition between the three greatest schools of witchcraft in Europe: Hogwarts, Hogwarts and Durmstang. A champion was selected to represent each of the schools and they were asked to complete three tasks. Each school took turns hosting the tournament every five years. But until the dead numbers became high, the decision was made to interrupt the tournament. This year, however, the Department of International Magic Cooperation and the Department of Magic Games and Sports said that it was finally time to try to bring the tournament back to life. During the summer, we have been working to ensure that no champion will be in mortal danger. Beauxbatons and Durmstang will arrive in October with a list of candidates and the selection of the three champions will take place on Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete.”
"Mrs. Pomfrey?" he called her.
“Damn it,” she murmured, catching her breath. “What the hell was he screaming like that?" she wondered after her teacher's reaction.
"Are you sure you're gonna be okay? Hermione had asked him.
Having no choice, Malfoy stood up and between the two of them supported Harry by his shoulders for Snape and by his legs for Malfoy.
When she heard him, she saw him awake and approached him...
Once near the Great Hall, Hannah felt her heart beating strongly as she heard all the hubbub in the room and took a step backwards as she felt the stress overwhelm her.
Suddenly George Weasley exclaimed:
"Mr. Potter, how can I put this...? Last night, when you were brought back here after you fainted, Professor Snape and I examined you. We tested spells and potions several times, but there was no effect. That's why we think that...
"Hannah? Is everything okay?" Ron asked as he saw his friend step back.
"Look at that," said the teacher in a dry tone. May I ask what you're doing here at this hour, Potter? To what honour has our dear celebrity come to the dungeons? he asked as he stood up before her.
They took the young man, who was still unconscious, to the infirmary. Mrs. Pomfrey, seeing them enter, rushed to Harry's bedside and asked them to put him on the nearest bed.
Lying on her bed since breakfast, Harry continued to caress Hedwige, who moved to her side before being interrupted in her gesture when the meal tray appeared on the desk again.
Harry, on the other hand, is in shock. Eyes popping out of his head, his mouth gawking, his gaze fixed on the nurse. He had a nervous laugh.
Ron and Hermione turned around and saw Professor Moody coming down the stairs, his stick in hand and pointed at a weasel shaking his whole body on the floor where Malfoy was.
When Professor McGonagall arrived at the infirmary, Harry was finishing breakfast.
Reaching the dungeons as quickly as possible, Hannah avoided all the students heading towards their common rooms before stopping in front of the door leading to the office of her hated teacher, Severus Snape. Taking her courage with both hands, Hannah folded the cape and hid it with her wand in her back, under her clothes, before putting away her wand and knocking. Silence answered her first before a voice was heard.
End of chapter 4
“Hello Hannah," says Hermione.
Poll: Hi everyone, I am posting this poll here because I would like to know for those of you who are Severus fans, if you would like me to make a version of this fic with Severus and Harry as the main couple. If you are interested, please let me know in the comments so that I can see it and make the necessary modifications knowing that I already have ideas on how I will do it if you are interested in this idea.
"And now St. Potter becomes a girl, said Draco sarcastically...
Taking her time to eat, Harry spoke for a moment to Hedwige, who watched her all the way until knocks at the door were heard. Harry got up and opened the door to find that his friends had returned before he let them in.
" Settle down," she said, pointing to seats.
It had been almost an hour since classes had finished and the banquet had begun. Harry was alone when he awoke in a fever... When he opened his eyes, he realized he was in the infirmary when he saw the walls around him. But he felt lost, his vision was blurred, his breathing was shallow, and he was shaking. Although he felt dizzy when he got up, he sensed that something was physically wrong when he felt his hair longer than usual. Reaching his trembling arm towards the bedside table where he spotted a standing mirror. What he saw, however, shocked him so much that he let go of the mirror on his legs. He observed himself and saw the changes on his body.
Ron always rolled his eyes at how much Harry spent on his membership there, but Harry’s found that nothing quiets the memories of a child lying still and cold after a spell gone wrong, or the anger from relatives and loved ones who don’t understand that sometimes there’s nothing to be done than a good, hard sweat session. And if he can’t get it in the bedroom, Third Space’s top-of-the-line equipment and over-the-top amenities more than suffice.

“After you,” Potter says, clapping Draco on the shoulder. Draco breathes in deeply through his nose and starts walking towards the front steps.

Ginny’s schedule is punishing as they near the finals, and Harry’s spending more and more time out of the house. It was technically Ginny’s turn to get the dishes done, but she’d been absolutely shattered when she got home that night, and she’d done them twice in a row the week before as a favour to Harry (not that he’d said anything, or even noticed at all), and she just...didn’t want to.
Draco’s nails score lines down Harry’s back, and he thrusts up once more and comes with a cry, leaning back against the couch and slitting his eyes at Harry, who tugs sharply once more on Draco’s hair before he comes all over their stomachs.

The fundraiser is Wizarding, of course, and the golf course itself has been rented out and staffed by their own for the day, but the hotel is still open to Muggle guests, so Draco keeps a tight hold of his magic, wraps it back down into his core until he’s hidden by the trees and can let it out.

“Hmmmmwhat,” Potter says muzzily, tugging Draco closer and lipping at his collarbone. Draco closes his eyes in despair and tries to will his erection away.
“Okay,” Harry says peaceably, reaching out and grabbing a blanket from further down the couch and wrapping it around them. “I’ll keep that in mind.”
Harry nods frantically. “No, you’re right. I just. Wow. I didn’t ever really...I told you it’s okay if we never did, and I meant it, but I really…” He shifts, and Draco glaces down and raises an eyebrow at the bulge Harry’s already sporting.
be picking up her slack in the clean-up department—Harry had put a lot of work into making Grimmauld a sanctuary for himself, and with Kreacher permanently installed at Hogwarts, he had no interest in picking up after his friend.
Potter clears his throat. “Er...Draco, just. What if I need to get up in the night? I’m not sure I’ll be able to make it to the door, let alone the loo or the kitchen…”
Harry’s never been anything less than professional with him since they were paired up, and while their relationship has certainly warmed to cordiality, if not outright friendship, in the intervening years, Draco’s well aware that his inconvenient attraction is incredibly one-sided, and impossible besides; they’re Aurors, and to Harry, the mission will always come first. It always has.
He’d been so excited when he bought this bed—

Harry tightens his grip on the long loop of Draco’s hair he’d wrapped around his fist earlier and yanks back, exposing the long, tense line of Draco’s neck, dotted with red and purple bruises from Harry’s earlier attentions. Draco hisses and pulls against Harry’s hold just a bit, just enough to make his eyes water from the sting, and Harry sighs and bends down to bite at his collarbone.

Harry’s cock twitches—if it weren’t for the cock ring, he probably would have come already, but instead he’s harder than Draco’s ever seen him, weeping precome that Draco’s quick to lap up and swallow, exaggerating his moan for the look in Harry’s eyes.
kiss him, and it’s reassurance and hope and arousal all mixed up, and they find themselves quite occupied for a while longer.
Almost delicately, Draco closes his mouth around the head of Harry’s cock and sucks. Harry whines high in his throat and slaps his hands down on the bed. Draco grabs one of them and puts it on the back of his head, winking up at Harry before he slides his mouth down and takes the entirety of Harry’s cock into his throat.

Draco’s clothes are always perfectly pressed and starched to within an inch of his life. He wears the same style of shirt in a variety of colours every day, rotating between them on a strict schedule only he understands (Harry wasted over a week one time trying to track the pattern and he only got as far as determining it’s not alphabetical), and he has six different suits that he seems to select based on mood. He somehow always seems to coordinate his ties with the Minister’s, so when they’re striding down the halls, heads bent together as they discuss whatever budgetary crisis the Ministry is dealing with that day, they look like a matched pair. Harry doesn’t know how Draco’s doing it, but he
Not for the first time, Draco sneaks a glance at his partner, who’s animatedly chatting with the concierge as he checks them in, and wonders.
“Ahh,” Harry groans, sitting up and swinging his legs over the side of the bed. He crosses one ankle over his knee and fiddles distractedly with his sleeve, doing up one of the buttons at his wrist that had come loose during his recent
He wanders through to the sitting room, where the fire is roaring. “I’m surprised you beat me home,” he says, shucking his coat and kicking off his shoes.
This isn’t just about them and whatever conclusion these little games have been moving them towards, though. This is about Teddy. And Draco refuses to disappoint his family, not any more.
Harry leans forward and presses their torsos together. It’s wet between them, kind of disgusting really, but Harry doesn’t mind, needs that closeness right now, and anyway he knows that Draco likes it.
Potter stills. “You,” he starts, then clears his throat. “You were serious.”
weren’t the one who ran as soon as you possibly could—”
He doesn’t want to hear it. He’s not sure he could take it, hearing Malfoy say that he simply couldn’t be arsed to tell Harry he was leaving, that what they were meant so little to him that he was able to just flee the country without a by-your-leave.
Draco grinds his back teeth together, then blows his whistle sharply twice. “Tighten up, tighten
if Draco is going to a child’s birthday party sober, as much as he loves Teddy).
He loves paying Harry compliments, loves to watch him blush and stutter and rub the back of his neck as he tries to be gracious while still denying it. He lavishes attention over Harry’s plush supple mouth, the way his stubble feels on Draco’s neck, how thick his cock feels in Draco’s arse, the way his hands can practically span Draco’s waist.
his wand is in its holster, but that’s Draco, he supposes. “Sure, why not. It’s not like we’re going to get called for anything else today. Merlin, what a waste of

Draco sits back and takes himself in hand, but Harry crouches down and bats his hand away, diving in and kissing Draco so thoroughly his head spins. Harry’s hand over his cock is fast and brutal, the water not doing nearly enough to relieve the almost burning friction, but Draco’s so on edge it doesn’t matter, and soon he’s sobbing into Harry’s mouth as he arches his back and comes all over Harry’s fist.
this time.
. I kind of...can’t believe I get to have it, actually.” Harry’s red, and he won’t quite meet Draco’s eyes, but he’s smiling, and it hits Draco all of a sudden that this is hard for Harry too; this vulnerability has them both equally exposed.
Harry slips out and retrieves several vials of Blood-Replenishing potion, returning just in time to hear a quiet whine slip from Draco’s lips as he starts to stir.
like that, he really knows how to make a bloke feel comfortable with all of it, honestly. I was bloody terrified—I mean, who wouldn’t be? But he talked me through it, you know, and he knows this absolutely
Draco blows a slow breath out through his nose and steps back. “Fine. Make it quick. I have places to be tonight.”
First come the questions about the Final Battle; the wands, Harry’s dead body coming back to life, the way Tom had simply
“Good. Stay there. I’m going to get this thing out of the house, and then I’ll come back for you. No,

need to talk.”
They’re small, unobtrusive; just small silver barbells that flash in the light reflected off the water, almost invisible on his pale skin, but to Harry they’re as enticing as a siren song.
Harry sighs, pushing back from the table and grabbing the letter, sending his empty plate off to the sink with a glance and a twitch of a finger. Bloody show-off. “I told him that if he finished something in off-hours, he should send it directly to me. It’s important that he gets feedback, you know, positive reinforcement, and that isn’t always—”
Harry’s read them—of course he has, everyone’s read them. And he’s learned that any of the novels featuring either the Auror partners, or the Cursebreaker and the Unspeakable, need to be read in the privacy of his own home—one

Harry doesn’t say a word. The doors at Mungo’s are charmed not to slam, so all he gets when he leaves is an unsatisfying
Draco gags.
He slumps down against the floor, panting for breath, and Draco waves his hand hurriedly to Vanish the bindings, crouching down and Summoning the glass of warm water from his nightstand. He helps Harry straighten, holds the glass until he’s had at least half of it, then pulls him to his feet and guides him to their bed.
he’ll demur with a shrug,
They continue on like that, Harry perfectly in place except for involuntary twitches when one of Draco’s strikes is particularly hard, or in a sensitive spot, and even when he’s trembling and covered in goosebumps he never misses a count.

She’d almost forgotten about the whole Draco Malfoy issue, until one day she’s sorting the post and pauses on a massive, thick envelope, made of parchment so creamy it’s soft to the touch, addressed in green ink that shimmers in the light when she tilts it.
what are you—” he chokes off the last few words, because Draco’s Conjured some lube onto his own fingers and pushed Harry’s hand away, and started stroking Potter’s cock himself.
“I want to try it,” Draco tries to say insistently, eyes fixed on the candles floating behind Harry, but since he’s got a ball gag in, it doesn’t exactly come out intelligibly.

“Thanks

“That’s right,” Draco says approvingly, pulling his hand back and spreading his legs a bit further. “Now. You know what you should be doing.

He kept it military-short the summer after the War; he was tired, and heartsick, and being pulled in a hundred different directions by friends and family and funerals and trials and the Ministry, and in a fit of irritated pique one morning, when he was running late to a memorial service at Hogwarts because he couldn’t get his damn curls to cooperate, he used the same spell he used to shave his face on his scalp, and showed up with a buzz-cut that set the entire crowd of mourners and reporters and looky-lous muttering amongst themselves.
