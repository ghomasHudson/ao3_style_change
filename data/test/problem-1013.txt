“I’m sure a color-changing spell would help you a lot later,” Harry responded. “But thanks for the insight.”
Harry’s breathing steadied as he calmed down. He sat up, moving away from Draco’s touch, tracing over the scar on his forehead. Turning his head, his eyes met silver ones that were looking at him rather expectantly.
“You guys go ahead, I’ll get myself a drink,” Harry said. Hermione and Ron exchanged glances, but nodded, making their way towards Draco’s group, greeting each other with hugs (but giving Draco an awkward handshake each). Harry’s eyes moved to the Firewhisky, but instead opted for a glass of champagne as it seemed no one was going to touch it.
“It’s our anniversary,” he said softly, sounding defeated. “Dates aren’t quite important, I know, but…”
“Yeah yeah,” he leaned forward and stared at the picture of Harry seeming somewhat bewildered by the flash of the photo, a nervous smile on his face. “He looks nice. Despite the nasty title.”
Harry took a few steps towards him, studying Draco’s face. There was worry etched upon his face, and guilt flooding his eyes. There was a sudden switch in Harry’s thoughts. This didn’t have to end their relationship. Nor did he have to let it drive a wedge between them. Yes, this wasn’t easy. But he didn’t want to give up Draco just because of Voldemort.
“Well, the only other thing I have is Butterbeer, and it’s far too early in the morning for that,” she replied. “Besides, I make pretty good lemonade.”
Draco was seated beside Pansy once again, only this time, as Harry walked past, when their eyes met, he quickly looked away. Harry embarrassedly averted his gaze, quickening his pace. Hermione and Ron followed after, both giving Draco a disgusted look as they passed.
“I didn’t say that. I can’t be with him right now. I mean… of course, he’s still my boyfriend. It’s just that we can’t see each other. It’s too dangerous.”
“Well, it’s not only for him now is it?” Draco said, reaching out for the book and glaring when Harry put it out of his reach. “I also have to learn it because of you. But perhaps some Ravenclaw is better off learning sign language for you.”
“What did you do to him?” asked Lucius as he took a small step forward so he could see Harry’s face clearer.
Harry simply nodded reluctantly, and they sat there, both their eyes on the fire but both of their minds wandering in different directions.
He pushed his hand off, fuming as he moved back, looking down at him. “That’s not something you should be joking about!”
“Are you okay?” he asked, instinctively moving forward, pushing Harry’s messy hair out of the way and stroking his scar gently. Harry held onto his free hand, both calming down before screaming in surprise. “Why does it work like this?!”
That’s when the puzzle pieces were put together, and right when Harry wanted to actually disappear from existence. He facepalmed and ran a hand through his hair - how stupid could he get? First, deciding to get drunk, then going over to Draco and not even recognizing him? Harry couldn’t even imagine what was going through Draco’s mind.
“Oh, I didn’t know you two were friends,” A casual voice said. Hermione and Pansy turned to see Luna Lovegood smiling at them curiously.
Draco gulped. He knew he had taken it too far. The fleeting satisfaction had left and the regret was starting to settle. He shook his head. “I didn’t mean-”
“You know why that idea would sound insanely absurd to me, right?” Harry retorted, then shook his head. “I’m sorry. This is weird. I don’t know how I’m supposed to behave around you. It feels like the walls are closing in on me every time you look at me like that.”
“He’s too soft to do that, but yes, we’ll be pretty mad.” Harry told her. Pansy smirked, watching them leaving the Slytherin Common Room.
Draco entered the Room of Requirement, his gaze softening when he noticed a bed in their room, Harry practically passed out on it. He slowly made his way to the bed, but frowned when he noticed Harry’s sweaty forehead and the frown on his face. Chewing on his lip, he gently reached forward and caressed Harry’s cheek.
Harry put his hands in his pockets, then nodded. “Alright. If you say so,” he said, putting a hand to the white streak in his hair. “Have you noticed this? It goes white every time I see you. It’s probably the stress I get from seeing your face.”
“I don’t want you to make up for anything,” Harry scoffed. “We’ve both made so many mistakes. Mistreated each other.”
“Sit down,” she said, grabbing his hand and pulling him down. They sat at the dining table, both sitting in silence. “Do you still love him?”
Draco had his back to Harry, but he was tall, so whoever was in front of him, was being covered by him. All Harry saw was a slim hand running through Draco’s hair, their long, pointy fingernails brushing through as if it was a comb.
Draco blinked, before cracking a smile. “Well, it’s two seconds to midnight, so… ditto,” He said. Suddenly everyone was shouting ‘Happy New Year’, and the fireworks had begun. “Happy New Year, love.”
“How did you find this place, anyway?” he cleared his throat, looking around. They were on a cliff and they could barely see the castle in the distance, it was somewhat of a foggy sight. He looked back at Draco, who wasn’t making an attempt to move from his position.
“I could hear you guys running about,” she muttered, then shut the door behind her. “But that’s besides the point. Malfoy, you shouldn’t be here. Literally everyone in this residence right now hates you. They’ll accuse you of spying for your father!”
There was no way he wanted to be soulmates with Harry! Harry couldn’t even trust Draco, and now they were supposed to be soulmates? Draco scoffed. He hated Harry, he didn’t even want to look at him. He hated…
“Why do you look like you just had a major revelation?” she asked, placing a pile of clothes on his bed. “Laundry for the week. Listen, Ron and Hermione’s anniversary party is tonight, so try to look like less of a mess.”
“Look, it’s one thing they can actually agree on!” Pansy teased, receiving a snowball in the face from Draco. “Oh, you did
Harry sleepily sat up, rubbing his eyes as he felt around the large bed for his glasses. “Morning,” He muttered. “Where the fuck are my glasses? I can’t even see my own hands without them-”
“Well, don’t get any- Harry!” Draco snapped, startled when Harry nudged his shoulder then quickly ran back, smirking to himself as if he was a child.
Harry moved back to Draco’s lips, kissing him more roughly than before, more passionately. Their tongues were in each other’s mouth. A sudden lust dawned on the two, and soon enough, the Slytherin had turned the Gryffindor over so that he was right on top of Harry.
With everything in him, Draco took a step back from Harry. “Go, darling. Before I change my mind. Because it’ll be bad for both of us if I do.”
The redhead stared at him in confusion. “Yes, that’s how relationships work. I think so, at least. Why? Who told you this?”
Draco sat up suddenly, making Narcissa almost jump out of her skin. “You’re right! Oh, you’re so right!” he stared into space for a few seconds, grinning, then looking back up at his mother. “I need your help.”
Pansy cleared her throat. “Okay, I’m gonna leave before you both start fucking right here,” she announced, walking over and slapping Harry on the back. “You’re not bad, Potter. Not at all. I think you genuinely have a chance against that wanker.”
“Your father has heard of some wizarding hearing aids being made. Not a cure, but… it would help me hear again.”
“Hey,” Ron sat as he flopped down across from him. Harry was seated by the window. “We’re going to Hogsmeade if you want to join.”
“Like I said, Dumbledore already knew. If he wanted to, he would’ve done something about it,” he shook his head, then stood up. “And yes. It is what I’m worried about, because I love him. Would you please respect that?”
Draco had been laying down on his bed, with the doors locked, staring up at the ceiling. Draco felt like he was in Sixth Year all over again. The feelings were the same, only this time so much worse. They had been through so, so much together. Didn’t that mean anything to Harry?
Draco looked over at Harry now, who was scribbling away on a piece of paper, mouthing to himself the words he was writing. He smiled slightly to himself. Whatever happened the next day, would happen.
He remembered what his parents had told him, more so his father. People needed to be ‘worthy’ of a Malfoy’s love. What was even love, according to a Malfoy? Despite how much he resented Lucius, he couldn’t deny the nights he had found his father pacing back and forth last year, worrying about Narcissa as she fell sicker and sicker by the day.
“Okay, two pets. But that’s the limit. And you better not be buying random things for the apartment. It’s honestly hoarding at this point!”
Pansy, who had been watching, slowly walked to Harry, gently taking his arm and squeezing it. “Leave him be for a while, okay? I’m sure he’s just upset. It’ll be okay,” Pansy said gently. “It’s better if you both just get some space…”
“Well, uh… Harry will be having dinner with us, Father,” Draco said, edging closer to Harry, who was trying his best to smile. Though he despised Lucius Malfoy, he was trying desperately not to for Draco. Harry knew that the last thing Draco needed right now was for his boyfriend and his father to fight.
The sunlight shone on Harry’s face. Squinting, he got up to draw the curtains, only to stare out the window, his mind wandering back to Draco. It had already been a month since their “goodbye” date, but Draco was anything but away from his mind. Technically, he said he needed time, but still. Was it normal to think about him this much?
“Okay, no, let go of that,” Draco said, but the owl was fast. It flew out of reach. “Okay, no. That’s not the letter you’re supposed to send.”
“I am?” Draco’s voice cracked slightly, and he cleared his throat. “I am?” he repeated, more clearly. “Are you sure?”
“For the best,” he echoed, relaxing as Harry rested his head on his shoulder. Draco pulled him closer. He shut his eyes for a moment, feeling his Dark Mark sting, trying to erase it with the feeling of having Harry in his arms.
Harry had found out about Horcruxes, and Draco was finishing off his job for Voldemort. The two of them were moving on with their lives, in completely opposite directions.
“Draco and Astoria might be moving,” she called from the living room, jumping when she heard a crash. Slowly, she entered the kitchen, raising an eyebrow as she saw a broken plate on the floor. “Harry!”
He Apparated to Pansy’s house, feeling a little disoriented when he reached. He probably would never get used to the feeling of Apparating. Looking around, he flinched when he saw Pansy and Draco, wide-eyed, sitting on the couch.
Draco sat in the living room now, coming back to reality. Astoria was just beside him, holding onto his arm. As soon as Hermione entered the room, Draco stood up, nudging Astoria’s hands away. “How is he?”
Hermione and Ron shifted uncomfortably in their spot, exchanging glances. They hadn’t even thought about how Harry must have been feeling, about going back to Hogwarts, about the war, how he could be feeling.
“I’d-” Draco twirled him around, but all of a sudden, Harry slipped over the floor because of his socks, causing him to fall backwards onto the ground. “Oh my God, Harry-”
He looked down at his feet, unsure of what to say, but when he looked up again, it seemed that his heart had started speaking for him. “I’m in love with you, Harry. Madly. Deeply. Unwaveringly.”
“Oh, Arthur, look what you did to the poor boy! He’s all shaken up. Don’t worry, Draco. You’re welcome here any time. Harry seems to be so fond of you. If he cares about you, so do we.” Molly said, giving him a reassuring smile.
He gulped when he noticed Draco’s serious expression. “Brilliant,” he blurted. “That’s just… brilliant,” he breathed when he felt Draco’s hands under his shirt. He felt Draco’s lips all over his neck, his face, and eventually his stomach, feeling the cold air against his skin.
“Was there anything you wanted to specifically say to me, or…?” He folded his arms, looking over at the white-haired boy.
“I trust you,” Harry whispered - or tried to - he couldn’t tell. “I want to be with you without feeling guilty that I’m putting you at risk too.”
“Relax, I just saw it the other day over your shoulder. Merlin, it makes me curious what you say in those letters,” She put a hand to her forehead dramatically. “Oh, fuck me daddy!” she cried out. “Fuck me so hard in the broom closet, which is quite ironic-”
With some hesitation, Draco spoke. “He was saying these stupid things about you. Things I was saying at the start of this year. And hearing it from him made me realize the stupidity of my words. Anyway, I told him to cut it out, and he started telling me how you’re my boyfriend because I’m trying to ‘protect’ you.”
“I-I know I shouldn’t be. Really…” Harry protested. “I just… I was just thinking of the look in Draco’s eyes the night that Dumbledore died.”
“It’s to make sure Harry understands them,” he replied, and all Pansy did was smile at him, as if she knew something about himself that he didn’t. “Don’t look at me like that. It’s frightening.”
He was the first thought in the morning. He was the first to make Draco feel worth something. The first to help him understand that being a Malfoy didn’t make his entire identity. His first love. His first everything.
Tears were forming in Ginny’s eyes. “What about that person you were talking about to me? That you didn’t expect to love?” she asked.
“Hm? Oh, no. I think we should be on good terms with them,” Draco replied, smiling at her. “They did invite us for Christmas dinner, after all.”
“It’s ten thousand Galleons. I don’t know about you, but I don’t have that kind of money,” Harry sighed, setting down the paper. When he looked back up at her, she had a look on her face. “I know what you’re going to say. I’m not going to ask him!”
“But no one saw me.” Harry said with a grin, receiving a smack on the shoulder from Draco. “Ouch! Besides, I
Draco stared at his father in disbelief. How unlucky did his fate have to be to be fucking related to someone like Lucius Malfoy? And the fucking nerve that his father had to look ever so proud of himself; as if he was doing such a great thing. In that moment, Draco wanted nothing more than to be stripped of his family name and be able to find a way to not be related to his father.
“I love you too, Draco,” Harry whispered back, unable to stop a grin forming on his face. “Okay, look at what I got you!” he said excitedly, running to the Christmas tree and grabbing his present for Draco. “Okay, so I know you don’t really know about Muggle stuff, so I got you this.”
Ron was surprised at the change of subject, but it was the first time they had spoken about something other than school in a while, so he rolled with it. “Er… I would think they’re trying to convince themselves they don’t like me, but failing.”
“For what, Harry? This isn’t your fault,” Draco shook his head, reaching forward and using his fingers to delicately wipe his tears away, pulling him closer.
After class was over, Draco and Harry were forced to let go of each other's hands which both of them didn’t want to do. Handing Snape his essay, Harry turned around hastily, and walked right into Draco, not realizing that he had been right behind him.
“Just stop. Don’t you think you’re forcing yourself on him a little too much? Stop confusing him. Maybe you should focus on your wedding which is in one month,” Ron snapped, folding his arms. Draco gulped, looking away. “You know I’m right. Stop botherin-”
“I would never rip your throat. I’d pull your hair off,” he responded. “I know how much you love your hair, so, you know. I’d do something you’d have to live with for the rest of your life. Baldness.”
“How did it go?” Pansy asked as Draco entered his room, jumping. “I told you I’d come over. Why so surprised?”
“Whoa, what’s the matter here?” said a familiar voice. Harry, who was hunched over the counter and took a bite out of the burnt apple pie, froze in his spot. It couldn’t be. But of course, it was. Turning around, his eyes met silver ones. Hermione, who was just behind Draco, frowned.
He weighed his options. Realistically, it’d be better. He’d be away from Death Eater meetings, so he wouldn’t need to feel guilty about knowing the plans and not being able to tell Harry. That was good. But Draco also couldn’t imagine Hogwarts without Harry - as his enemy or anything else.
right now, Ron,” Hermione told him in a whisper, before turning back to look at Draco and Harry, smiling to herself.
“Wow, just out me like that, thanks,” Draco said half-jokingly. Harry snickered but Hermione raised an eyebrow at Draco. “I… I was joking- never mind.” Draco looked away from Hermione.
“Take it off, Draco, it’s boiling,” Harry replied, standing up and leaning against the open windowsill, breathing in the fresh, cold air. “Come here.”
“You know,” she shrugged, “you’ve not been happy the past few months. But sometimes you get these waves of temporary happiness. And it feels like everything’s going to be okay again.”
“Why do you always Apparate here first?” He rolled his eyes, but knew it was because half of the time he would never even show up to the parties or gatherings their friends were having. Now Hermione and Ron would make sure to stop by his place to see if he was going to come or not. It was sweet of them to do so, but he would never tell them that.
“Don’t want Madam Pomfrey to ask questions,” Harry stated. “Thanks, though you do realize if you would have just accepted my great joke, this wouldn’t have happened, right?”
He got up and quickly got ready, going to breakfast with Ron, meeting Hermione at the Gryffindor as usual. He finished his breakfast quickly, then stood up and left, sneakily signaling for Draco to leave the Hall too.
Harry looked at Draco, reaching forward and squeezing his hands. “Of course. I’m sorry. I won’t ask. But, tell me, is it difficult? I don’t want you to feel like you can’t tell me if you’re going through a hard time.”
Draco’s eyebrows creased as he tried to recall or remember the term, then shrugged. “No idea. Maybe I’ve heard my family use the term a few times. Why? Aren’t you working with Dumbledore to try and stop You-Know-Who?” he asked.
After a moment, he looked up so Harry could understand what he was saying. “Are you mad? That I didn’t tell you?”
“I’m so sorry, I’m not good at comforting,” Draco whispered, pulling Harry in close. Even this was a bit different now, but neither of them tried to think about that. “I better go soon.”
“They’re actually poems,” he mumbled, but shook his head. “I’m sorry you had to find out this way. I just didn’t know how you’d react to me being bisexual, let alone dating our worst enemy.”
“Well, yes,” she nodded. “But I’ve seen the way you look at each other. Something like that… it’d take a lot to break, don’t you think?”
“We think it’s better if you stay here, with us,” Narcissa told him. She sensed how tense Draco was, judging by his body language in that moment. “Both of us decided we want you here.”
“So… can we finally move past this awkward stage?” Draco asked, holding his hand out, trying to shake off the uncanny feeling of deja vu.
Ron and Hermione, who’s eyebrows were raised when they had watched Harry struggling to find his stuff, nodded.
The first letter he got from Draco was painful to read, and it took so much not to write a reply or even Apparate to him, but it was the last letter he got on his wedding day that hurt even more.
Harry helplessly looked over to Hermione, who winced, then translated what he was saying in sign language. He rolled his eyes, turning to look at the white-haired teenager in front of him, trying to ignore the small crowd that had formed.
“Course not,” he said up, a cheeky smile on his face, wondering why his face felt so hot. “Back to work?”
“I just don’t think you should be making fun of him for being deaf,” he said quietly, taking a sip from his drink. Pansy, beside him, chewed on her lip uncomfortably. Even she didn’t know what to say.
“You guys are adults,” Ron chimed in, pulling Draco in for a hug as well. The two wondered when they had become this comfortable with each other. “I’d hope you two could handle one night for us?”
“Harry!” Hermione’s voice called from his left. Harry immediately turned to Hermione, causing Ginny’s lips to touch his cheek instead of his lips. Startled, Harry flinched backward. Harry had to say something since it had gotten awkward.
“I…” Harry stood before his headmaster, his heart pounding. He moved forward down the spiral staircase, pausing when he heard footsteps. He looked back at Dumbledore, who gestured for him to come back.
Harry looked at him for a long moment. He could feel butterflies in his stomach, but he was unsure why.
“Excuse you, I think they’re quite fantastic,” he snapped, folding his arms. “But… does this mean you forgive me?”
“A tad bit strict if you ask me,” he commented, opening the book and staring down at the textbook, smiling to himself. “Don’t consider becoming a professor. Students will hate you.”
Every time they stopped for air, their eyes met, only for them to go back for another. It was as if they were the only two people in the world. Draco kept his hands on Harry’s face, too nervous to touch him anywhere else. His whole body was tingling and he felt Harry smile, which only made his heart leap more.
“Hey, I’m only buying nice, pretty things! We need to make our house seem homey, you know. I’m not surprised you don’t know how to decorate things. Malfoy Manor is literally just white walls.”
They walked around the whole castle, but Luna’s shoes were nowhere to be found. They eventually went outside, to the lake where there was a tree beside it.
Draco, who was seated at the front of the class, was still finding it hard to process what just happened.
“I have an idea,” Pansy clutched her mug. “My parents aren’t usually home, and even if they are, they don’t really come up here to my floor.”
Harry had taken his time with drinking the two bottles, but he still felt slightly dizzy as he took ahold of the third bottle, deciding it was too tiring for him to stand up. He slowly walked towards the couch, trying not to fall over in the process. Eventually, he made it to the sofa, sitting down beside a white-haired male, almost falling right on top of him.
“Would you… stop being friends with me if I was gay?” he asked, voice shaky as he sat up slowly, wondering if she would hit him. She was the type to smack people if she disagreed with them.
“I saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains! Thank goodness, thank goodness- but what’s wrong with Albus?”
“Never,” Draco whispered as Harry slowly shut his eyes, almost instantly falling asleep - Draco’s warmth, his scent, and the way he held him, it was perfect for Harry. It was comfortable.
“Well, that too,” Ginny said with a slight giggle. She took a step forward. “I shouldn’t have lashed out like that. I respect that you like someone else.”
As soon as those words came out of Ron’s mouth, Harry kicked off the duvet and grabbed the piece of paper from Ron’s hand, not bothering to take anything with him before running out the door.
“I think so too,” he replied, grinning to himself as he looked down at the charm bracelet on his wrist.
They had gone from enemies, to sort-of-friends, to lovers, to strangers, to lovers again. And they had finally,
“Do you really need to ask?” he responded, wrapping his arms around his neck and pulling him into a slow, careful kiss. The two waited for a moment, perhaps to feel a burning sensation, but it never came. Draco slipped his arms around Harry’s waist, a little too concerned, in case Harry would suddenly feel the effects of the curse.
Harry had missed so much. He had missed the raspiness in Dumbledore’s voice, Hermione’s laugh, Ron’s snorts, and most of all-
“Okay. I’m sorry for pushing you. Rule five: don’t ask me about my family or any Death Eater stuff.”
Harry lifted up his right hand, maybe to smack the other playfully, but he ended up turning to face Draco, cupping his cheek, looking far into his silver, glistening eyes, leaning in close, close enough to feel Draco’s gentle breathing on his lips. Draco stared back into Harry’s shining green eyes as he laid back on the bed, wondering what was going through the other’s mind.
“Harry, it’s cold,” Draco whined, “Why did we agree to come see some stupid Muggle fireworks with Muggles around?”
“Yes, but… he’s also apologetic, kind, nerdy, and stupid,” Harry sighed. “And it’s so easy to be around him. We were friends for a few months before and even had a while to try it out. So, please, just don’t tell anyone, okay? Especially when I don't even know where our relationship is going to go after this…”
Draco stood still, looking anywhere but into Harry’s eyes, then finally spoke. He wanted badly to say yes, but his brain was telling him to think logically. “What if we find that it’s not worth the risk?”
“Sorry for pushing your limit today, I just think it’s better than to wait around. Since I’m at school now, I won’t be informed of anything.”
“Harry,” he said in a soft voice. They both felt the music die down, dissolving into a calm yet tense silence in the atmosphere. “I’m sorry. I was only joking.”
Harry knew he should’ve said no to the proposal, and he should be saying no to coffee. But it seemed his heart taken over, because he nodded.
They had only been shopping for around thirty minutes, but he was already tired. Everything seemed so exhausting lately. All he wanted to do was lay in bed and stay there.
“Finally you’ve visited,” A voice said, making Harry jump. He turned and saw Pansy standing by the bed. “He’s been awake all day, restless. Every time someone entered he begged for me to open the curtains to see who it was.”
, Harry,” she stressed, trying to keep her composure, “but he may be in a position where he can’t choose. All I’m saying is… can’t this wait until things have cleared up more? If it ever does…”
He let out a loose laugh, walking closer to Draco, who gulped. “I’m kidding. Thank you for the poem.”
Hermione and Ron exchanged glances, mildly horrified but also very confused at what was going on. Pansy, in the background, pursed her lips, deciding it was best if she kept her mouth shut.
“Pansy, if anyone in my family found out about us… it wouldn’t be only me in danger, but Harry as well. Besides, I should back out while I’m ahead,” he stated. “You were right, you know. We are star crossed lovers. Meaning there’s no point in it.”
“You were stalking me?” Draco normally wouldn’t have minded. In fact, he would have been pleased. But not in this situation. In this situation, it was perhaps the worst thing possible.
Draco waited for him to look up again, then started speaking. “I mean… a little,” he shrugged, and for some reason, Harry’s chest darkened. “It’s quite unfair that she gets all the guys, isn’t it? She should leave
The feeling in his chest lightened a bit. “Oh, you mean that way. I was just wondering if you… I dunno, liked her or something.”
And while everything else was uncertain, this was the only thing he could say he was sure of. Trusting Draco with his life.
“Missed a deadline.” Draco slipped out. Harry’s head snapped in his direction. “He asked me to do something before the Winter Holidays, but I didn’t do it.”
“Well, they can’t be caught slipping up, can they?” he spat, looking at her with disgust, folding his arms. “Don’t tell me you believe that
“Really now?” Draco asked as he smiled back. It was impossible not to. Harry’s green eyes were sparkling as he grinned. His hair was greasy and sticking up (revealing the white roots in those specific strands of his hair) and his glasses were falling forwards as he leaned over to move his car to the box.
In the coming weeks, the first few lessons went this way. They’d do a few minutes of physical signing, then Harry would give him a new phrase to learn, or a new topic of words to learn. They would usually sit in silence then, until Harry decided he needed to leave. Draco would stay for an hour or more, trying to study WSL on his own.
walked towards Harry, careful to give space. “...And I just felt really off. I knew something was up,” Draco explained as he wiped tears off of his face too. He slowly sat on the large, large bed, slowly approaching Harry, wrapping his arms around him.
Draco was perched on the side of the armchair, his hair disheveled, a few buttons of his shirt unbuttoned. Checking his watch, he raised an eyebrow, concerned. Harry was very, very late. He had tried reading a book and doing his homework, but nothing was keeping him busy.
“And… have you made a decision about his proposal yet?” he continued, sitting down on the couch. Hermione and Harry both sat down as well. Ron was surprisingly supportive, despite his ‘I told you so’s after their break up.
“I know you’re trying to prove me to be the idiot here,” Harry gestured to Draco’s hands, “but the only person who looks pathetic is the one trying to bully the deaf teenager. I don’t think you thought this one through.”
you guys have no idea how many times i tried to rewrite this chapter. things just weren't working! but i finally figured out what felt right, so here i am! i hope you guys are still around. i know i make you guys wait a lot for a new chapter, and i'm so sorry. i appreciate all of you for being so patient! i'll try to make the next update sooner.
“You know, Pansy, I was going to thank you. But like always, you said more than necessary,” Draco massaged his temples gently. “What about when we have to go back to Hogwarts?”
“You know, you’re a really bad liar,” Draco said, lying down on his bed, Harry still at the foot of it.
“What is?” Ron asked as they entered the Hall. Harry was about to answer but his eyes went and fixated on Draco.
“Where’s mother?” he asked, watching as Lucius Malfoy looked up from his newspaper, raising an eyebrow. For a moment, they stared at each other in silence, until he curled his lip.
“Hey, Harry, Hermione, haven’t seen you since…” Pansy trailed off into silence but quickly changed the subject, “Anyways, I need to talk to you guys.” Pansy quickly entered the train compartment and sat down beside Harry. Hermione politely greeted Pansy and waited for Harry to greet Pansy too. But he didn’t. He seemed to be staring into space. Ron awkwardly waved at Pansy.
“Trying to pretend to be enemies isn’t going to work if you keep looking at each other like that,” she whispered in his ear, but Harry shrugged. He was too good in a mood to care, and the dark atmosphere that had bestowed upon Hogwarts had almost slipped past him. Almost.
She groaned. “Do we seriously have to go for that? Can’t we just have a Christmas party with our circle? The PureBloods?”
“Because so many mistakes have been made between us. Let’s put aside the fact that we were enemies for six years,” Harry folded his arms, “even while together… you didn't tell me about your Death Eater tasks, I used that… stupid spell on you, you thought I didn’t trust you, and then… then there’s this fucking
“Gee, thanks,” Draco said with an eye roll, turning away from Harry as he removed his shirt to change into his pajamas. Harry grinned, slowly getting up and walking over to Draco, wrapping his arms around his bare torso, kissing his shoulder gently. Harry felt as the other male froze. He raised an eyebrow but thought nothing of it.
“Gee, thanks,” Ron scoffed, and the three let out a small chuckle. Harry turned around to look for Draco. It was Friday evening, which meant it was almost time for them to meet in the Room of Requirement to study, but he seemed to be nowhere in sight. Maybe he had finished up already.
Harry looked up, his eyes reaching Draco’s, who was already staring at him. But his stare wasn’t nerve-wrecking, unlike Cedric’s, unlike Cho’s.
And somehow, this had become their new (ab)normal. But it was like Draco had said: normal wasn’t quite their thing.
“Uh, wow,” Harry said, blinking in confusion, “I didn’t realize… that your father was… like that.” Harry’s fists clenched under the table, and he looked away from Draco, trying to keep the anger he was feeling hidden. Harry knew that it would probably just make Draco feel worse.
“Like you’re ready to go shopping,” she smiled sweetly, walking over to fix his collar. He nodded, putting a hand to the faded brown streak in his hair. It seemed he didn’t need to dye it anymore. It was slowly turning white on its own.
“Focus on your own feelings,” she shook her head. “Allow yourself to feel everything. If it doesn’t work out, then it wasn’t meant to be. You don’t have to, but wouldn’t you beat yourself up not knowing what could’ve been?”
He turned around to leave, he jumped when he noticed Draco standing at the door, his tie loose and hair messy, seeming out of breath. The two locked eyes, and for a moment, everything had left Harry’s mind. The overthinking, the stress, the worrying had left, and the only thing he could think of was: Draco’s eyes had never gleamed this way before.
He turned when he noticed a faint tapping on the window, only to see an owl waiting just outside. Quickly walking up to the window, he surveyed the area outside before opening it to let the owl in.
“Mr. Malfoy, late as well. Come to sit beside Mr. Potter, will you?” Snape said with an eye roll. Draco made his way to the front of the class. Both Harry and Draco scoffed when they made eye contact with each other. “This is the seating arrangement for the rest of the year,” Snape said, especially glancing over to Harry when he finished his last sentence. Usually, professors don’t give out seating arrangements, but Harry guessed that Snape just hated him so much he made him sit next to Malfoy.
Also this fanfic just reached 90k words!!! I'm so happy to still have people reading!! Thank you so so much for reading, leaving kudos, and commenting!! It just makes me so happy :))
She gave him a long, hard stare. “I suppose your father would be proud of that,” she said finally, but the disgust in her tone was clear. “Did you apologize? Did you pay him back for it?”
“I’m sorry I didn’t come sooner,” Draco started, his voice cracking. “I’m sorry I just left you like that. I’m sorry that we fought.”
Harry watched him walk towards the exit, then finally spoke. “One month,” he blurted loudly. Draco stopped, turning to look at him, eyebrows knitted.
“Malfoy’s been weird recently,” Hermione spoke up, picking at her food. “He seems… bubblier or something. Less nasty, too. He barely even insults me anymore.”
Draco cleared his throat awkwardly, turning to Pansy. “Cho Chang,” he said in a somewhat disappointed tone, picking up the quill on his table.
“Harry!” Pansy squealed, walking towards him and pulling him into a hug. “I haven’t seen you in forever, love!” Harry hugged her back, laughing awkwardly, looking up to see Draco’s eyes directly on him. He quickly looked away, pulling away from the hug.
He rolled his eyes. “No one said anything about a Gryffindor,” he pointed out, then instantly regretted it. “Forget it. You’re not going to be able to guess.”
He glanced over to the Slytherin table, where Draco was laughing and talking with Pansy, Blaise and some other friends.  Their eyes met and Harry’s expression was somewhat confused yet also pissed, and he quickly looked away. He needed to talk to Draco one way or another.
“I don’t know,” he answered truthfully. “We spent a whole day together yet I didn’t feel sick or get hurt even once… Maybe it was just a normal headache. I seriously don’t want to think about it right now.”
“Okay. Maybe I’ll have a salad…” he frowned, walking past the mirror, then abruptly stopping, staring at his reflection. He put a hand to the brown streak, sighing loudly as he left his room. Narcissa, concerned, followed after.
“Well, this may come as a surprise to you, but it’s not exactly something I’d like to broadcast to the world,” Draco snapped.
Draco ripped out a piece of paper, scribbling something before slipping it under Harry’s door. Then he turned and went into his dorm, going into the shower to wash his feelings away, which, if he was being honest, didn’t work.
The first thing Harry saw was someone in the corner of his eye. No, not just someone. He looked back down from the ceiling and at Draco, who was looking at him, a frown on his face. “Hey,” he said finally, while signing.
Draco rubbed his eyes, groaning gently when he reached around for the alarm clock on his bedside table that was, in his opinion, much louder than it needed to be. A smile crept up his lips when he saw the time on the clock, the bright moonlight falling into the dorm. Luckily, it seemed that none of his roommates had heard the alarm.
“Holy shit, Harry. You had me so worked up over the metal device that I completely forgot about Christmas dinner with the Weasleys. Oh, they’re going to hate me. They’re going to actually hate me!”
“But Harry! These people practically treat you as their own son! I can’t mess up! Besides, they already hate me so much! Harry, I can’t do this. I can’t! They hate me! They’re going to hate me even more-”
“Harry, Harry,” Draco whispered when he noticed Harry groaning slightly in his sleep, sitting up. “Harry, wake up, it’s just a dream-”
Harry felt tears well up in his eyes, then stood up, picking up a letter from the counter. “I don’t want to make a fool of myself.”
“Harry!” Hermione hissed when several people turned to Harry at the mention of Death Eaters. “Besides, he’s only sixteen! He’s underage. Surely You-Know-Who would think he’s too young. I really think you should let it go, Harry.”
Draco wolfed down his food, and Harry resisted the urge to call him a hypocrite, mainly because Draco looked beautiful when he was excited. Well, he always looked beautiful, but even more so.
“Right, makes sense.” he got out his wand as well. “It was the color-changing spell, right? Okay, stand up.”
“Here, have a sausage,” Draco cut a sausage into a smaller piece and held it to Harry’s mouth. “Normally I’d find the Three Broomsticks a bit low for my standards, but… I’m not going to lie, this is pretty good.”
“What? What’s wrong? Are you getting hurt again? I’m so sorry,” Draco asked, panicked, scrambling to move away, only to stop when he saw the other shaking, then bursting into laughter.
“You don’t need to explain.” Harry cut him off. “This is what you’ve been spending the past few weeks doing, haven’t you? Canceling Saturdays, not coming to class? I’m not stupid. I knew something was up. I just… can’t believe it was this.”
“I was actually dreading sitting alone in this cafe! Just wait here, honey, I’ll get a drink and sit with you,” she smiled, setting her bags down. When she returned, she tilted her head. “So, how have you been? You weren’t there for the Christmas dinner again, so I was a little worried…”
“Don’t listen to your father. I want you to stay in Malfoy Manor, okay? Who knows what’s going to happen if you go without anyone with you.”
Draco rolled his eyes (but he was grinning at how cute Harry was). “I said if you ever want another set, tell me,” Draco repeated himself, now carefully closing the box which had the other two sets, stowing it away under Harry’s bed.
“What?” Draco asked obliviously, “is there something on my face? Why are you staring at me like that?” Harry chuckled slightly.
“I heard what you said. Just wanted to see how you would lie about it.” Draco replied, running a hand through his hair, which wasn’t gelled up for once. Harry rolled his eyes at what Draco said.
that I hated you, I just couldn’t, because it’s not true. I don’t hate you. I could never, ever hate you.”
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Come on, Malfoy, get your head in the game. In a real battle, he wouldn’t have time to prepare.”
“That’s good, that’s good… well, as long as you’re happy, we’re happy too, I hope you realize that.”
As he sat down at a table, watching Hermione dance with Ron for a while. Moping around a little, he made small talk with Luna who had momentarily paused her unique dancing to check in with him. Afterwards, Hermione sat down beside Harry, sighing.
It seemed to Draco that him and Harry were at completely different places now. He seemed different - more willing to talk, breezy, yet somewhat of a composed exterior. Heart hammering, he suddenly stood up, excusing himself to the bathroom.
He felt his eyes sting with tears. “She’s deaf,” his voice was quiet. He was grateful that they were the only ones in this carriage. “She fell really sick last year, and now she’s deaf. It was something to do with her eardrums.”
“I’m sorry. I know I should’ve been honest with you, but… it was the only choice I had. I was already supposed to be mad at you, so... I just used that as the reason.”
Harry held out his wand. The two watched as it trembled in the clasp. He gulped, opening his mouth to speak, then set his wand down, turning around. “I can’t,” he shook his head. “I’m sorry.”
staggered a few steps backwards, but managed to balance himself before they could both fall on the floor.
He felt betrayed. Another person had left him, a person he trusted deeply. There was an unbearable feeling dawning on Harry’s chest.
“Everything okay?” came a voice from the doorway. Harry slowly looked up and turned around to see who the voice belonged to - it was Ginny. She was smiling softly, “I couldn’t help but overhear your conversation with Ron and Hermione.”
“Er… I need to use the bathroom. I’ll be back,” he said, then quickly left. When he went out to the hallway, he frowned when he saw Draco by the door of the Great Hall. He turned around, his bloodshot meeting Harry’s. There were tears rolling down his face and he was struggling to catch his breath. “Draco,” Harry said softly, taking a step towards him.
okay so I hate how the order is messed up now; it says chapter 26 is chapter 27 oooooof wow this is great. Hopefully, it doesn't bother you guys
“Hey, stay,” Harry pleaded as he tried to get up, pulling him down so they were sitting beside each other, refusing to let go of his hand. “Stay for a second.”
“It’s fine. I guess learning how to defend myself is more important,” Harry stood up. “Hey, listen, I’m really tired, and I should probably go check up on Ron. I’ll see you tomorrow, okay?”
“Like you feel sorry for me. I’m aware how pathetic I might seem compared to you. I mean, you’re in the middle of all of this, and I’m just… a minion, I suppose. Someone to do the dirty work for him.”
“Let’s talk in the other room, I don’t want them to know you’re here,” Harry said quietly. They went up to Harry’s room, where Draco remained tense, eyebrows creased into a frown.
Harry didn’t know what to think of that. Was it a good thing that she was asking? Or was she asking because she was scared of him? Harry continued to stare as he watched the girl’s parents looking over at him, and saying something inaudible. The girl had turned and she was now staring at Harry.
“I’m sorry. It was stupid to come here. And… now I fucked up my one shot at being successful in my father’s eyes-”
The two eventually stopped kissing. Not because they wanted to, but because Draco’s Dark Mark was starting to burn, and Harry’s scar was hurting too.
“I don’t think either of us thought this far ahead, love,” he shook his head. They sat in silence, and Harry took his moment to study Draco. He looked tired, but less pale. He was wearing a black suit and his hair was gelled back.
“We’re living together… we have a small dog… and… Draco’s making me pancakes.” Harry chuckled drowsily. “He sucks at making pancakes… but it’s fine. I pretend that I like them. Then… we go out for dinner and I propose… and I’m finally…”
Looking up, he caught Draco’s eye, who mockingly waved his wand around, as if to remind Harry how to use his wand. In response, Harry rolled his eyes, but kept his gaze on Draco, unsure of what to do.
Draco put a finger to his lips, kissing him gently, as if to tell him to relax. Harry kissed him back, then huffed. “Fine. I’ll keep it on for five more minutes,” he gave in, wrapping his arms around the other. The fact that he couldn’t see where they were going made him more nervous, but he decided to put his faith into Draco’s riding skills.
“You know, you ought to be sending those poems to your girlfriend instead. I guarantee they would be more than delighted to read a poem like that,” Harry blurted, looking over to the other, who seemed quite confused.
Meanwhile, in the Great Hall, Draco kept glancing over to the Gryffindor table, sulking. Pansy, beside him, tugged at the sleeve of his robe. “What’s the issue now?” she asked, following his gaze to see if he had something to say about Potter again.
With a deep breath, Harry nodded slowly. “...fine. But if it doesn’t work…” he placed each of them in either of his ears, adjusting them properly. Looking up into Draco’s eyes, he squinted, too scared to speak.
Harry closed the map and stowed it away, exiting his dorm, not even paying attention to Dean and Seamus who were asking him where he was going.
“Oh yes, it’s me who has to grow up,” Harry replied with an eye roll. He grabbed the waffle back and starting eating, turning to Hermione, Ron, and Luna who seemed to be arguing.
Draco, who was still suspiciously staring at the phone as if it could kill him at any moment, hesitantly pressed down on the home button.
The brunet hesitantly reached forward and took his hand. His heart was racing and his cheeks were flushed. He was being bold for someone who had just been rejected. “Then we go back to being Malfoy and Potter.”
He stared into the brunet’s green eyes, unsure of how to tell him that the poem was about the two of them. “I guess so,” he said finally. “And… it’s only one of them that likes the time they spend together.”
“Listen, Draco. If I die tonight, I don’t want to leave you with unfinished things,” Harry whispered. “So I’m going to say what I need to right now.”
“Ron’s right,” Pansy said, who had been amusedly enjoying the conversation. “Nargles are real, okay?! If Luna says they’re real then I believe her.” Harry groaned as Pansy smirked, ready for Hermione to start arguing about the facts and how Nargles were not real.
“Mr. Potter, that is not your seat.” He stated loudly. This time, it was Harry who almost fell over at the sudden mention of his name. He slowly looked up and gazed questioningly at Snape.
He looked up at him, seeing the determination in Draco’s eyes. “Can’t hurt to try again. Except that it could,” he chuckled, standing up and moving closer to him, only laughing more when the blond rolled his eyes at his joke. Trying to endure the pain, Harry reached out to touch him, only to fall back on the bed, wincing. “Fuck me, that hurts!”
“Seeing as that took you twenty minutes…” Harry said, ignoring Draco’s sly insult, he took out a book from his bag. “This helped me learn the basics. Just flick through it whenever you have time. For now just go through the first chapter.”
“I don’t think you have anything to be embarrassed about, as Pansy already sort of knew. Me, I had to make up a story so that Hermione wouldn't ask so many questions.”
“You learn to tune them out,” he laughed, taking a sip from his drink. “Besides, I think every couple bickers. By the way, what made you have a party this year?”
He stared down at his steaming hot drink, pushing it to the side, suddenly losing his appetite. “I don’t know. On one hand, I’m still really mad about everything, but… he’s the only thing I used to be sure about. I thought as long as we were together, I could figure everything else out in time.”
The class started off pretty normally. The class was set to work, but this time Harry and Draco were too focused on their work to hold hands under the table.
Harry gave Arthur a rubber duck, Molly a necklace, Charlie a book about dragons, Bill a book about Herbology (Harry really just took a long shot there) and George a book about jokes.
Harry burst into laughter, unable to contain it anymore. “Draco, it’s Siri. She’s like a robot assistant.”
Draco Malfoy’s smile; the calm after the storm. Harry wished Draco could be the calm after every storm to come. That he would be there to conquer the storm with him. That’s all Harry really wanted.
He tried not to think of the other options. Like - maybe Harry was mad at him, or maybe he was cutting him off. Or… worse. He could be hurt or in danger. With every waking moment, the regret of making an absurd deal with Harry only grew. How could Draco
“Oh, come on. It has to be you. I mean, you have more experience with the Cloak than me!” Draco pointed out, shutting the door so that no one would see them. “I don’t really have much experience!”
“So… uh… be with me for one month. Now, I’m not sure if it could work out either. But that doesn’t mean I don’t want to try. Draco, I’ve never felt this way about anyone before. Not to this extent.”
When Harry didn’t respond, he took in a sharp breath, keeping his eyes fixated on him. “Something happened to you. Something bad. You should talk about it. Sort your feelings through, not shut it out and hope it goes away.”
“That’s the thing. Why would I take him back like that? Is that all my purpose is, waiting for him to come back to me? Mind you,
“Is that it? Do you like her? Are you jealous that I got to kiss her?” he persisted. “I didn’t think you would like a Ravenclaw, but… I’m not going to fight with you over a girl. God, Draco, why do we always have to fight? Why can’t we just-”
They both turned to the now even further extended room, a large bed in the corner. “We could go to bed, you mean?” Draco asked, looking down at him. “Hm… maybe. If I get the right side.”
“I better start calling you Granger instead of Weasley,” Draco rolled his eyes, but nodded. “Yeah. Just don't make it too awkward.”
Draco frowned, unsure of what to say. He was holding himself back, unsure if it was from hugging Harry or crying. Either way, he shook his head. “I can’t take this, Harry,” he said quietly.
“Well, of course we’ll support you being bisexual,” Ron nodded, “but you can do so much better than Malfoy, mate.”
It took a lot for Harry to not smile. “No, but I’m ready for another of you being an absolute pain in the arse,” he retorted. They exchanged a look and Hermione rolled her eyes, grabbing his arm.
“The part where you said you liked me in spite of that. The part where you told me I was worth risking all of that. The part where I thought you
Harry looked up at him for a long moment. “What does it mean when someone tells you they dislike you, but like spending time with you?” he asked suddenly, squinting down at the piece of paper.
Harry had no sense of time, though. He didn’t know what time of day it was. He heard the door open but didn’t let it bother him, turning to lie on his side. He had been on the bed for about sixteen hours. But he hadn’t had even an ounce of sleep.
His voice was deeper than Harry had last heard it. Well, the last time was probably in fourth year and Draco was insulting him like always. He had never heard Draco’s voice sound so soft.
Harry walked over to the bed where Draco had placed blue silk pajamas. “All you own are silk pajamas, I swear,” Harry muttered as he pulled off his shirt, putting on the clothes before flopping himself down on the bed again, staring up at the ceiling. Draco stayed sitting on the desk, looking over at Harry.
“Harry Potter is dead!” repeated Voldemort, looking around at everyone. Draco took in a deep breath.
Harry smiled and pocketed the note, suddenly finding himself desperately waiting (and feeling quite nervous) for lunch.
“Well, she put what I was thinking into words. Besides, I agree. I think you need a break from all of this, mate,” he sighed. “I know you don’t want to hear it, but I’m worried about you.”
Harry walked to where he had seen the Room of Requirement last. He stared at the blank wall and slowly thought to himself.
Harry felt as if someone had smashed his head against a window. He nodded, turning, putting the Cloak over him and leaving.
“Harry-” Hermione started, then tapped his shoulder when she noticed his bare ears. “No hearing aids?” she asked while signing. “Is this some sort of exercise Malfoy’s making you practice?”
“I’ve got back-up. The Death Eaters are in your school tonight,” Draco was saying. Harry wanted to do something. He wanted to stop listening to what was happening, he wanted to leave. He didn’t want to listen to this.
“I’m in need of a wand,” Harry whispered, staring down at Draco who had three wands in his hands: Hermione’s, Ron’s, and his. Draco quickly and carefully pushed Harry off of him, making it seem like the way he pushed him off was brutal. Draco handed over the three wands in his hands.
to take his eyes off of Draco, who awkwardly stood there, wondering why Harry was looking at him like that.
“No, it’s not that,” he shook his head. “I’m just not sure about exploring when… I feel weird around this one person.”
“I think it’s very obvious,” said Narcissa. Draco turned to look at his mother. Had Snape told her about Harry? “Send a letter to whoever’s on your mind.”
Draco rolled his eyes, staring down at the ring on his finger, wondering why he was suddenly so close to tears.
She smiled at him almost sympathetically, then cleared her throat awkwardly. “Well, run along now. You’ve a feast to get to.”
“I figured. That’s how I feel about Pansy, too,” he stated, staring down at the book in front of him.
Harry stood up. “This is stupid,” he sighed, looking away from Draco’s eyes, that by each day, were becoming easier and easier to fall into. “Maybe I should just ask Ron and Hermione for help instead.”
Draco’s eyes burned with fury - no, frustration. “Don’t do that. Don’t. It’s not going to help you or me. So let me tell you what needs to be said.”
Draco, despite himself - despite knowing he should probably return home - nodded and followed her down to her kitchen. Leaning against the counter, he watched as she got out two glasses. They stood in silence while she made some lemonade, then sat down back in her room, where she had a lounge area.
Folding up the silly poem, he reached for his owl, who grabbed it and quickly flew away. Draco sighed, taking out the other one from his pocket, opening it, his heart dropping to his stomach. “No.
“Oh, um, I’m fine.” But his voice was cracked and all he wanted to do was die. He was a horrible person. A disgusting, revolting person. That’s what he thought of himself, at least.
I really want to thank you guys so, so much for your support. Looking at your comments really got me motivated and made me feel much better about continuing this story - I genuinely thought that no one liked this story. So, really, thank you. My writing is not great at all but it is really important to me (always has been), so seeing your support really helps me.
Hermione entered Harry’s room,  eyebrows creased when she noticed him in bed, staring at the letter. “Harry, it’s noon! Today is…” she stopped when she saw the owl.
After a few minutes, Draco stood up to move to the couch, deciding he would wait till Harry woke up. Harry grabbed a hold of his arm, his eyes fluttering.
“Come, sit down,” Harry said. Draco did as he said and sat down. The two stared at the fire for a few moments.
“I… don’t really know, actually. Can you explain what happened when I passed out?” Harry asked curiously.
Pansy stood up and shut the blinds so that anyone passing by wouldn’t be able to look inside. She sat back down beside him. “I’m sorry,” she spoke finally, running her hand up and down his arm. “But I’m sure Harry would understand this, right?”
He looked around, eventually walking deeper into the room. After a few minutes, he eventually found a blond head in the dark, only one candle on the table beside him.
“Well, that was when--” his gaze averted to Draco, who seemed to be listening intently as he ate his dinner. “...when I had somewhat of a plan. I’m trying to just take things as I go.”
“Don’t,” he shook his head. “If I ask, you’ll have to explain, and…” he looked down at Draco’s Dark Mark that was half covered by his sleeve. “And I don’t want to go down that road. Not tonight.”
He nodded. “You two look good too. Like a proper married couple,” He smiled, picking up Luna’s gift that was on the center table. “I figured I should probably come today. I haven’t seen everyone in a while.”
“Merlin,” Draco grabbed it back and opened it quickly and effortlessly without making a single tear, revealing a velvet box. Harry took it back and opened it to see a watch. “Look, I have the same one. Put it on."
By the time their kiss had turned passionate, filled with desire and hope, the warmth had clawed its way back to their hearts, as if it was always meant to stay there. Just as Harry was directing the two of them to the bed, there was a knock on the door.
“After what happened…” he gulped, “everyone was treading on thin ice. They still are. They try not to bring it up if they don’t have to. But you? You weren’t afraid to say it to my face. And you weren’t afraid to treat me the same way you have been the past few years. It was like… while it feels like everything is changing, you’re the one reminding me that not much really has to change.”
“I don’t see it that way,” he shook his head. “I just… I’ve been afraid that if I say something, he could potentially tell his father or Voldemort. That’s what our argument was about. It’s been hard for me to trust him because of my fear.”
“Give me a kiss for good luck, at least?” Draco said in a slight whiny tone, and Harry rolled his eyes, turning to Draco and kissing him on the lips softly, wrapping his arms around his neck.
“Saint Potter is wearing a Slytherin Quidditch jumper,” a snarky voice said, “how did he land his hands on one? Oy, Potter, did you steal it from us?”
“Shut up,” he snapped, but turned around, leaving the kitchen and finding a mirror in the hallway, staring at the glistening white streak in his hair. Ron followed after, both of them staring at his reflection. Harry turned to him quickly. “Quick, make my hair a different color.”
Today, as Harry entered the Room of Requirement, he tapped his watch (that was paired with Draco’s) once, which from what he remembered, meant ‘hey’. He got one tap back, which likely meant that Draco was on his way.
They reached their usual grass area, but this time there was a huge white tent put up. Draco’s eyes widened an all Harry did was smile.
He picked up a pen, quickly scribbling a letter back to Ron and Hermione, since it seemed the owl they had sent would not stop following him until he sent a response to them.
“Oh, don’t worry about it, dear. I have loads of things anyway,” Molly said with a smile. “Now, off you two go. It’s getting quite late.”
“Are you now?” Draco asked, a pure smirk on his face as he stared at Harry. Sure, he was upset with him, but it was hilarious to see what drunk Harry was like. Harry let out a loud whine as he punched the cushion beside him, frowning deeply as he nodded.
Changing into something more suitable for a party, he jumped when Hermione and Ron Apparate into the living room. They’ve been busy, so they didn’t have time to meet up with him and see how things had gone with Draco.
"Harry, can you tell me with all honesty that you wouldn’t have endured through all the pain to be with him, to the point where you get seriously injured?”
“It’s a party,” She said, a glass of Firewhiskey in her hand, “Pansy planned it. I don’t know why! I was supposed to be studying but Pansy forced me to stay. I have to admit, it’s been a bit fun. Where were you? The party started about an hour ago. Anyway, Draco’s over there. No one will notice you and him, so you can hang out if you want.” Hermione was talking really fast - it was clear that she was slightly drunk.
“Sleep,” Draco finally said, gently pushing Harry’s head to his shoulder, starting to stroke his hair again, using his other arm to hold him.
Narcissa smiled, but it wasn’t the smile he wanted. It was a sad smile, that reached her eyes, as if to let him know that she was too afraid to give him an answer. “Pansy said he might…” he muttered.
But was that true? Harry wondered how different things would be if he accepted his friendship on his first day at Hogwarts. Well, he certainly wouldn't be friends with Hermione or Ron, and that in itself sounded like a nightmare.
It felt strange to be back. Everything looked as it did before the war - before Voldemort had destroyed it.
Two weeks passed. Things were changing, perhaps for the better. Harry was smiling more, despite the nightmares and visions. The end of their one month was near, yet neither of them had brought it up. They would meet every Friday and Saturday. Fridays consisted of actual work whereas on Saturdays, both of them would find it hard to focus and end up doing something else.
“How could you possibly help?” Draco whispered, before biting his lip. “I don’t need your help. You would never understand.”
That evening, Harry quickly changed into his Quidditch uniform before getting out into the field to practice.
“It-” he paused, shaking his head. “I suppose it doesn’t. Anyway - there are Death Eaters here tonight.”
“Why didn’t you just tell me we were soulmates from the beginning?” Harry asked. “Why didn’t you just tell me about the stupid curse?” he lightly smacked Draco on the chest. “I think I’m still in love with you. I know you’re married to Astoria, but-”
“Yeah, there’s no way you’re going for a walk now,” Hermione told him. “You need to calm down, I’m on your side here.”
Draco looked up from his book, raising an eyebrow. “Well, you never asked.” Draco replied, shrugging as he set the book down on the table in front of them, frowning slightly at Harry.
“Oh, there it is,” Luna said casually, looking up at the branch where her shoes were tied. Harry reached up and got it for her, handing it to her. Just then, Harry heard the bell chime at the Clock Tower, indicating the start of class. “Thank you, Harry!”
Draco shook his head. “I was just supposed to be looking for him. I didn’t intend to actually find... He told me he can’t keep doing this and that I should stay with him. I mean, he’s mad, isn’t he?”
Harry gulped. “Okay, I suppose you’re right. Can we at least start with one-” he paused to dodge another spell, “hearing aid on? I’ve… gotten used to having them on all the time and- it’s- hard- oh, fuck off!” He whipped his wand out and threw an Expelliarmus spell at Draco, who countered it with
“It sounds awful,” Pansy admitted, putting an arm around his shoulder. “But give it time. Do you have any idea how genuinely happy you’ve been the past two months? Don’t let go of him so easily.”
Harry turned to Hermione and Ron, who winced. He tried not to cringe in embarrassment. Well, of course those two would want to work together. Who would want to work with the deaf kid? “Er… alright, Harry, I’ll work with you,” Hermione said, but the look on her face made it seem like she was being asked to do a chore.
“Um…” He looked down, struggling to open the wrapping. “I don’t want to ruin the wrapping, it looks really nice-”
“Everything’s spectacular,” Harry said when he paused from drinking to catch his breath, before taking another gulp. Hermione raised an eyebrow but decided to leave Harry to it, joining Pansy and Luna to converse with them. Draco and Harry had been able to hide that they were arguing surprisingly well. Pansy and Hermione did notice that when they walked past each other in the hallway, they just disregarded each other’s presence rather than saying anything snarky or shooting an insult. They decided it was probably better not to pry, and just assume that they weren’t in the mood to fake-argue in front of everyone.
“Draco. What’s wrong?” Harry asked. “I’m not stupid. Even a blind person could tell that something’s up.”
And then they spent the rest of the night playing Truth or Truth, which eventually dissolved into normal chatter about this and that. The two felt so comfortable around each other, it was unreal. Harry felt happy. And the next morning, when they both made their way back to their dorms, they felt disappointment that the night was over.
Draco slowly stopped writing, folding the paper and putting it to the side. “What about?” He asked in a tone that made it seem like he cared when in reality he didn’t.
“Only because you were going to press me for answers! I still needed to process everything that happened,” Draco exclaimed, but there was no hiding it. The date had gone extremely well, and what gave away this was his wide grin. “I can’t stop smiling.”
“Then that’s all that matters to me. How could you possibly stop all of them? You can’t blame yourself. This was my fate, you can’t beat yourself up over something you can’t control. Whatever you have to do… do it.”
“Yeah,” Harry replied, grinning back. Harry reached out to take the Snitch from Ginny, put she put her arm out of reach.
“I’m concerned,” Harry said as he held onto Draco tightly, putting a fearful hand to his blindfold. “You’ve taken away the only sense I can depend on! What’s the point of this?”
“Does that make you mad?” Harry asked carefully, taking his books out of his bags again so he had an excuse to avoid his gaze. “To see her making out with guys?”
“Yeah…” he looked away, trailing off into silence, unsure of how to tell her that being a Death Eater would end their relationship on the spot.
Pansy pulled up her stockings, holding her champagne in one hand, almost losing her balance. Draco quickly grabbed her glass. “Could you be more careful? You almost spilled that on me!”
Draco took a step closer to Harry. “When are you going to understand that we could be happy together? I’m sorry for the last two years, I really am. And I’ll… I’ll spend the rest of my life making up for the way I’ve mistreated our relationship. I just don’t want to lose you completely.”
“Hey, hey,” Draco whispered, removing Harry’s glasses and wiping his tears away, cupping his cheeks, “I forgive you, okay? Besides, it was mostly my fault-”
“I’m injured,” he said dramatically, putting a hand to his forehead. “I know it’s surprising to hear, but even I, Draco Malfoy, can’t be perfect at everything. I’m better at it than most, of course, but no, not perfect.”
Things were blurry, but eventually, Hermione, Harry and Ron had managed to escape. They were panicking, and in desperate need of a hiding place. So they went to the first place Harry could think of - Grimmauld Place. He didn’t think he’d be back here so soon.
Draco put a hand to his cheek as he turned around to face him again. “Right, friends,” he nodded. “I suppose that’s all it is.”
Draco looked over to the Gryffindor again, who was looking at him now, almost curiously. He raised his eyebrows slightly, as if to ask him if everything was alright. He nodded in response, and Harry gave him a small smile. Draco smiled back before the two both turned back to their work.
Standing up, Draco walked over to his closet, searching underneath his clothes and finally getting out the iPhone Harry had bought for him two years ago. Switching it on, he went to the Photos app and stared down at the selfie they had taken, smiling at the fear in his eyes. The phone had freaked him out so much that they had to keep it in another room for a few days.
She stood up, pursing her lips. “Fine. But all you get is two hours. I’m not leaving my fate in the hands of a Malfoy.”
Draco nodded slowly. His mother turned and left. Then he lied back down on his bed and turned over, scoffing at the idea of sending Harry a letter.
The Squad started to file out, but Draco and Pansy hung back. “We’ll keep watch, Professor Umbridge,” he said, trying his best to sneer. “Make sure these three don’t try to come up with some way to escape.”
“My, my,” Harry said as he saw Draco sprawled on the couch, WSL book in his hands. “It’s the last day before the holidays and you’re
Harry took in a deep breath, swallowing what felt like a rock in his throat. “I just want to help you,” He whispered softly, his eyes getting welled up as he got more frustrated. “Please, Draco, just let me.”
“Sign here,” Draco pointed to the piece of paper. Lucius stared at him for a long moment. “A true Malfoy never goes back on their word, don’t they?”
“You don’t need to answer,” he said. “You’re not really obligated to admit anything, especially to me.”
“Harry, we’ve been practicing non-stop without you, I really have a good feeling about this one,” Ron said as Harry sat down at the Gryffindor table, starting to eat some toast. “When are you going to join us for practice? Our next practice is this evening.”
Draco let out a soft chuckle, and the two dissolved into silence for a moment as they continued walking. “You seem… different.”
“Ah, come on, mate, it’s fun.” Ron insisted. Harry took the bottle and spun it very fast, hoping and praying it wouldn’t land on Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be staring at Harry very intently as he stared at the bottle spinning and spinning until it finally came to a stop.
“You know,” Harry said, finally putting the pieces together, before turning to Draco. “Thanks for telling me, Draco.” He added with an eye roll, staring at the other who sheepishly smiled and scratched the back of his neck.
“Can I ask you something?” Draco asked once Harry looked at him again. “Why do you keep staring at the ceiling?”
“I know you’re there,” Draco spoke in a low, quiet, voice. He sounded different. Harry sighed, taking off the Invisibility Cloak. Draco was still staring at the ceiling. He refused to look at Harry.
That was a lie, but Harry didn’t call him on it. If Hermione, Ron, or anyone else asked, he would just say he didn’t think to check the last day for turning in assignments. Which was certainly not the week before, because Harry, like said earlier, hadn’t checked.
“...together,” Pansy added, winking again. Harry felt himself go red and Draco facepalmed, rolling his eyes. “I just hope you’ve been using prote-”
“Draco, are you okay?” Pansy asked, noticing Draco clutching his arm tightly. Then she sighed when she realized what it was. “Are you ever going to tell me what he’s making you do-”
It was only natural that he was asked to be a Death Eater. Practically his whole family was. It was the most logical thing, and he knew it was bound to happen. This wasn’t something to mope over, or to be hurt by.
“I felt horrible. I felt betrayed, mostly. I didn’t want to eat. I couldn’t sleep. I cared too much about what happened, and no matter how much I tried to convince myself
“What do you mean? Of course, I’m coming!” Hermione protested from the other side of the room, walking towards Ron and grinning at him. “I’ll go if you go.” She leaned forwards and before Draco and Harry knew it, they were making out beside them.
“It’s easier to hurt myself than see others get hurt because of me,” he said before he could stop himself. He shook his head. “Forget it. I won’t say this again. Just leave the issue alone. I’m fine.”
“I’m sure you heard me, Potter. Didn’t you?” Lucius asked in an icy tone. “My son shouldn’t be dating a lowlife like you.”
The door opened and Draco entered. Harry let out a sigh of relief, sitting up. There was now a couch in their study room that was conjured up every time they entered the Room of Requirement.
“Well, it’s not interesting if I’m not in it,” he stated, raising his chin and smirking. “Can’t imagine what sort of news would even come in the American newspaper.”
“Good. I’m glad that we’ve come to terms that you ruined everything.” Draco said. “You ruined everything.” He repeated.
“So… America, huh?” Harry said, folding his arms. Astoria, Ron and Hermione had already left, and the Weasleys were upstairs, getting ready for bed. The two sat outside, neither one quite ready to leave yet.
“We fought about something stupid,” he lied, shaking his head, looking down at his grazed knuckles. Gulping, he chewed on the inside of his cheek nervously. “He’s just… been getting on my nerves lately. It was just a lot of small things that led up to this fight.”
“Well, because I’m much better at Potions than you,” he said with a small shrug. Harry scoffed in response, but didn’t say anything, flipping over to the page. “How much of this powdered moonstone is-”
Harry slowly walked to the tree by the lake. It seemed like Draco wasn’t there yet. He awkwardly leaned against the tree. Hermione had picked out something for Harry to wear and although she wasn’t really that informed of what to wear during dates, Harry was grateful nonetheless.
“Why does everyone assume I have a girlfriend?” Draco asked, looking up at him. “I know I’m hot, but…”
After a lot of insisting from Harry, they decided that the hearing aids he received would be as large as the gifts would ever go, because he never wanted to feel like he was using Draco’s money for his benefit. Much after Draco’s whining and pleading that there was a difference between
“You had your chance,” Snape told him. He turned to Draco and briefly looked through his mind, using Legilimency. “I was right.”
Harry licked his dry lips, his eyes faraway. “A dream,” he answered, then shook his head. “A nightmare.”
Harry looked up at Draco who had entered the cellar along with them, looking around the area frantically.
“Coming for the feast, Harry?” asked Ron - the Eighth years were allowed to go to their rooms and set up their rooms before the feast - as he walked over to the door, looking back at his best friend.
, Ms. Granger!” she raised her voice. Her patience seemed to be wearing thin. Harry caught the eye of Draco, who seemed just annoyed as he did. “Mr. Fudge will be here soon. I need to greet him. Meanwhile, all of you,” she snapped her fingers to the Inquisitorial Squad, “find the rest of the group.”
“Mr. Potter, I would have been willing to overlook this due to your… unfortunate circumstances,” she said, “but you resorted to violence, and you already had detention from Professor Umbridge last week. Both of you will have three weeks of detention with me.”
“However, you did anyway,” she snapped, folding her arms. “Detention. Three weeks. And fifty points from Slytherin.”
“You came,” Draco repeated after Pansy, his trembling hands enveloping Harry, as if he couldn’t believe it. “Oh, Harry, I’m so sorry. I left so awfully. I… fuck. I don’t know what to say. I understand if you’re cross.”
The three hung out in the Gryffindor Common Room for most of the day. Thankfully for Harry, Hermione and Ron stopped bickering after the color incident, as he wished. But, he thought maybe he was better off when they were bickering because now he felt like an immense third wheel.
“It’d be amazing,” Draco nodded. He moved his head slightly, placing a gentle kiss on Harry’s lips. He stood up. “But things can’t be like that. For the sake of my safety, and more importantly, yours.”
Harry was quiet for a moment, then smiled. “I do have another board game in mind, actually,” he beamed. “It’s called Life. What do you think?”
After finding gifts for everyone, they made it back to the store. Since it was the weekend, Hermione and Ron helped him with business at the store, which was busy as always. Piece by piece, Harry was bringing his life back together, one without Draco.
“No,” Draco firmly said this time, sitting up properly. “Leave it. Don’t involve yourself with him. He… all he does is cause trouble wherever he goes.”
“Well, yeah, because you need to know them. Anyway,” he threw the textbook in his hands somewhat aggressively. “Read it again. You have five minutes.”
The promise he had made to himself; that he would make only one letter to Harry to keep for himself, was broken.
“Come on, Harry, it’s two in the-” Hermione stood in the doorway. Her hair was disheveled and her clothes were crumpled. She paused. “What in the
“Morning,” Pansy said as Draco sat down beside her at the Slytherin table for breakfast. “Slept well?”
“More like one secret admirer,” Ron commented, finishing up his breakfast and trying to take the letter from his hands. “That’s the same owl from the past few days, isn’t it? Can I read the paper?”
Short as well, I know, but in my opinion, it's just the right amount and way to end their 6th year at Hogwarts.
Harry let go of Draco’s hand as if it were fire, looking away from Draco. The stinging pain in his chest hit him; because no matter how much Harry denied it, it was true. He will never understand. And Harry will always have missed out on having a real family; a real childhood.
Harry had to numb it out. He had to, he couldn’t let himself be torn. He turned and started to walk away.
“When are you going to get it into your head that it’s impossible for me to hate you?” Harry took a step closer, his eyes threatening to let more tears fall. “When are you going to understand that every fucking time I see your face all I get reminded of is how I’ve only ever been happy with
- you know what? Forget it,” he held his head up high. “I’m just going to read from the textbook. You better get started with your Potions essay. I know you haven’t done it. It’s due on Monday.”
“I never learned how to properly block him out, Draco,” Harry replied. “Do you really want to break up with me?”
“Even if we were dating these two years, you would’ve changed. I don’t think you understand that I don’t want who you were or will be, but who you
“You’re a sweetheart, Astoria. Oh, and Harry came!” Pansy said, looking past Draco. He turned around, putting a hand to his hair as he did, heart dropping when he realized she was right. Much to his surprise, he was laughing and talking with Luna, Neville, Hermione and Ron. “You okay, honey?”
just do that,” Pansy stated, leaning down and quickly making a snowball and throwing at Draco, who instead of throwing a snowball back, turned away, burying his face into Harry’s chest.
Harry, face flushed, folded the poem and placed it in the box he had. He was thinking of getting another box as his current one was almost overflowing. The Saturday coming up would be there one month anniversary, and he couldn’t help but be nervous. Although they were having fun, did it necessarily mean that he was worth the risk? He didn’t want to think about it. He didn’t want to grow attached to Draco, only to have him break his heart.
“You want to see if this…” he walked closer to Draco, “was worth the risk, right?” Harry tried not to show his trembling hands, chewing on his lip nervously. He didn’t even know what he was saying, nor had he thought it through. But his gut feeling was telling him to go with it.
Walking over, Harry tapped him on the shoulder, then signed, ‘what are you doing?’. Draco stared at him for a few moments, hiding whatever was in his hands under the table. Harry stared at him expectantly.
His mouth dry, Draco looked back up at the ceiling, the corner of his lips twitching. “Sometimes our hands touch and it feels like an electric shock,” he mumbled. “And today he was looking over my shoulder… his body was pressed against mine. It felt like my heart was beating out of my chest.”
Harry nodded. “I understand. I just wanted to apologize. I know that… I was stupid. So… I’ll see you around, I guess,” he said, then moved towards the door. Draco was stunned - maybe it was the hope or delusion that they would actually be able to be together again, but no. Harry still didn’t trust him fully, and Draco didn’t want to be the only one trying in their relationship.
He stood up quickly, almost tripping but regaining his balance. He picked up his bag, ripping out a piece of paper from his notebook and taking out his quill, dipping it in ink and starting to write.
Both Hermione and Ron stood in front of him somewhat menacingly. “Are you going to tell us why the hell you and Malfoy were talking about
“Astoria, do you have a moment?” He asked suddenly, placing his plate on the table in front of him. She nodded, signalling to Pansy silently to go ahead without her. “Listen, um… I just wanted to talk about… the possibility of our… marriage.”
“That bracelet looks nice,” Pansy smiled as she sat down beside him in the Great Hall. “Did someone get it for you for Christmas?”
“Mr. Potter,” Snape said suddenly, causing Harry and a few others to jump. The class had been silent for a while and Snape had just broken it, a few people were bound to find it sudden. “Please stand up.”
Draco’s demeanor fell, face blank. “I didn’t know he was going to be here. I came for Molly and Arthur, and-”
Draco kept his eyes on Harry, frowning. He took in a deep breath, then finally opened his mouth. “I thought it over,” he said slowly. “My feelings. You. My family. The Dark Lord.”
, stop daydreaming,” said Hermione, rolling her eyes when she noticed Harry wasn’t paying attention to what she was saying. The loud chatter was deafening, but Harry didn’t mind it. He smiled slightly to himself when he stared at what seemed like a shaken up first year kid, nervous to leave her parents.
“Yeah, yeah, sorry,” she dusted her hands off and took the glass back from him. “Hey, where’s the trio?”
“Can’t believe I’m doing this,” Draco muttered. Harry’s lips twitched in amusement but he tried to hide it. “I just need your help for a few months. My relative… he’s deaf, so my father wants me to learn WSL so I can communicate with him.”
“Blaise is right, you know,” he spoke finally. “I don’t know how I expected to get by this year. I’m already falling behind in Potions. I feel like Snape is purposely going faster than usual this year, just to see me suffer.”
“Harry, don’t,” Draco said in a tone that Harry knew all too well. Harry bit his lip, frowning as he stared at Draco.
Harry and Draco exchanged glances. "Well... perhaps... uh... more than friends," Harry managed to say, feeling embarrassed.
“Seems like everything else,” she nudged his shoulder, then sighed when he looked down, playing with his fingers. “I think you should spend more time with him to understand how you really feel."
Monday through Friday, Harry only used his hearing aids when necessary and kept his distance from Draco. Well, it wasn’t as if they were too close in public anyway, but he avoided their usual banter that would take place here and there. But he could only escape it for so long, because it was Friday evening and he had to go to the Room of Requirement for his usual lesson time. He contemplated on even going, but then realized he was being extremely unfair towards Draco.
Draco had to tell him. So he could stay away. So he wouldn’t get too close. So that he wouldn’t be hurt. Draco hated how selfish he was being; unable to tell Harry the simple sentence.
“Draco,” he whispered, lowering his wand. Relief flooded his chest, and so did a sliver of happiness. Draco was here. In front of him. “Are you with anyone?”
Hermione and Ron exchanged glances, both uncomfortably imagining kissing each other. They stayed silent and Harry shook his head. Those two were in such a weird phase and he realized it probably wasn’t a good idea to say that. “Whatever. All I’m saying is, I’m not too happy that she was my first kiss.”
“No, it is not! Are you colorblind?” Hermione asked outrageously. “Harry, tell him it’s dark purple.”
“Oh, don’t worry about it, sweetie. I’m sure you’re busy with work and things. Just… it was a bit empty this time, you know with Harry being abroad and all.”
“It’s fine if you don’t want to,” he said. “I don’t want you to feel like I’m forcing you to do anything.”
“No one believes me, do they?” he muttered, looking over to his friends. “I can’t believe I got detention from Umbridge because she thinks I’m not really deaf.”
“Oh, that’s great,” Harry said, in more of a blank tone, and a slight smile. “Sorry I couldn’t make it.”
“You’re rambling,” Hermione stated with a sigh. “Tell you what, let’s stay till dark. If he doesn’t come by then, let’s just assume he spent the night at his home - his parents probably want him to, you know… We’ll go back to The Burrow if he doesn’t come home tonight, and we can come back tomorrow to check if he’s there.” Harry smiled slightly - Hermione was being rational; she was probably correct, anyways. Harry was probably just being dramatic.
“I don’t know,” he answered finally. He couldn’t lie to himself. Cedric may have been an infatuation, sure, but Draco was different. It was everything he felt with Cedric and more. It was stronger. It was the way Draco fiddled with his ring whenever he was focused, it was the way he’d run his hands through his stupid, silky hair at least a thousand times a day, the way his silver eyes sunk into Harry’s, making him feel so on display, yet so safe at the same time. It was the way Draco’s poems were the only thing he was looking forward to in the mornings, and the way Friday evenings were his favorite time of the week.
“Harry, you were sent to the Hospital Wing for two weeks because of him, and vice versa. You can’t just-”
“Looks like he’s completely normal to me,” Ron said when he noticed Draco glaring at them. Harry finally looked away from him and focused on his food.
“Yeah,” he said. “It’s just…” he leaned forward, kissing him on the lips quickly, taking Harry by surprise. “I haven’t kissed you in a week, you know.”
Harry entered the classroom one minute late, slowly and sneakily sitting beside Ron, hoping Snape wouldn’t notice.
?” Harry asked in astonishment. His head turned to Draco, who looked away in shame. Harry took in a deep breath. Draco turned to leave. “Wait, Draco!” Harry called after him, grabbing his hand. Draco turned at once.
“So like old times? Do we need to fight over who’s under the Invisibility Cloak again?” he asked as they pulled away from each other. “It better be you, just so we’re clear. I’m not about to sacrifice myself again.”
“What? I’m just asking. Besides, I was talking to Harry. I know you’ll tell me absolutely nothing.” Pansy said reasonably. Harry stepped out from behind Draco.
He hung his head low in shame. “It’s difficult. But it’s nothing I can’t handle. This summer was the worst, if I’m being honest. Even though… I basically went with everything my father told me to, he was still so angry with me. I feel as if he wishes I was a better son. But his version of a better son is someone who would abide by everything he has to say, and probably worship the Dark Lord as much as he does.”
“...well then fine, I don’t care if your stupid arm hurts or not.” Draco huffed, turning to look away from him.
The boy almost fell over from the sudden noise, dropping everything that was in his hands, turning to face Harry.
Draco’s eyebrows were furrowed and he was holding Harry’s hands tightly. This was crazy. He could hear Draco’s gentle breathing. The wind rustling the leaves just outside the window. The gentle shift of the covers as he sat up properly.
“Draco,” Narcissa sighed, sitting at the foot of his bed. “Astoria’s gone for the cake tasting without you, love.”
“Ah, okay, you should’ve told me that,” Hermione shook her head as she set down the two mugs of hot cocoa. “Now this is dangerous territory. Either you lead him on only to break his heart, or you fall in love again.”
“I knew that, of course. So I came up with a little something…” Lucius slowly got out his wand.  “I’m sure you know all about your little…
ex-crush. And I kissed her back!” he answered, and the three broke into a small smile, knowing full well it was not something to laugh about.
“Mad? No,” he said, stroking Draco’s hair, who shut his eyes. Crying had tired him out again. “I wouldn’t have wanted to say it if I was in your place. I understand. Thank you for telling me now.”
“WHAT?” Ron said loudly, earning a smack from Hermione. Both Draco and Pansy looked up, surprised by the disruption. They kept their eyes on the three, who seemed to be part of an intense conversation. “Sorry. Um.
Ginny nodded helplessly, and Molly and Harry both followed after her into the kitchen, both trying not to laugh at the burnt apple pie. “This… is unsalvageable. How did you manage to burn it?”
“Ah, dear, I don’t know much about what happened there, but… you two were so great together. It just seemed so… how do I say it? It felt right to see you two as a couple. I always knew you were a good kid. But… if you’re happy with Astoria, then that’s what matters.”
“I never loved you,” said Draco. His eyes looked different, and he had a different expression on his face. “I was always working for Voldemort - dating you was just one of my tasks.”
Harry sat up in his bed, smiling weakly at Molly who handed him some soup and left him to be alone. They were all going to continue the dinner downstairs (Harry insisted that they didn’t need to wait for him). Hearing a knock on the door, Harry said a quick ‘come in’ and continued sipping the tasty mushroom soup.
“Yesss,” He cried, “and I r-ruined everything! You see, I just wanted to help… to be th-there for him, and I ruined it. I also said some things I shouldn’t have said… even though I knew the pain he was going through…” Harry trailed off into silence.
“I know it’s not my place, but…” he started, looking down at the pack of plasters that appeared on the table beside the couch. Picking it up, he shook the box slightly. Draco waved his hand as if to say no, and Harry found himself taking out a plaster, carefully putting it over the cut, carefully tracing his thumb over the swollen part of his face.
“I should have.” He mumbled, looking away from Harry. Harry put up his hand and slapped Draco right in the face.
Harry wondered where Draco was. He thought back to the previous years - walking to each others’ compartments, exchanging insults… Harry wanted to see him again. He stared out the window as the train finally started. They were on their way to Hogwarts.
Harry set down his quill, looking at him. “Oh. Well, I hadn’t thought that through whatsoever,” he rolled up his sleeves. “Maybe… the day we got back together? I guess?”
“Well… I guess the situation had to be confronted sooner or later,” he said, laughing awkwardly. He looked over to Astoria, who seemed to be invested in a conversation with Luna, noticing the ring on her finger. Draco was legally married to someone else. He couldn’t dare change his mind now. But he wasn’t sure if his answer was supposed to be a ‘no’ to begin with.
“That was not the plan. The plan was to do something else, but it ended up backfiring.” Draco said, walking to Harry. “I don’t want to do any of this. You know that.”
“You know, you become a little more like Hermione every time I see you,” Draco commented, dodging a smack from Ron, entering the room. Harry walked back to the bed while Draco stayed by the door after he shut it behind him.
“Why didn’t you wake me up earlier?” Harry asked. Draco turned, revealing a bruise on his cheek. “What happened?”
“And why, exactly?” She asked with a raised eyebrow. Harry pushed his hair back to reveal a few strands of his roots greyish-white. She rolled her eyes. “That’s completely normal. It’ll probably just wash out, it could be paint or something of that sort.”
, Christmas is in a month. That means I need to go home for the holidays but I’ve barely learnt any sign language-”
As the past week had passed, Draco had been growing nervous. He remembered that Harry too needed to know if their relationship was worth it. He had been trying to tell himself that it was okay; and he had to be grateful for even having a month of Harry Potter. He did not know what love was, and the more time he spent with Harry, he wondered if that was what it was. Enjoying the green in his eyes, his gentle touch, his lips. Perhaps it was the way the snow seemed prettier and how the sunrise was brighter.
“Draco, if you find Harry Potter for the Dark Lord, he will be pleased. He will be very happy with us.”
Hermione, Ron, Harry, and Draco all stopped chewing, and Ron even choked on his food a little. All four of them mentally cringed.
“Well, good, because I didn’t raise you to be like that,” she said sternly. “Anyway, we tried to acquire them, but it was difficult. For now, I’m fine like this. Besides, wizarding hearing aids would be quite expensive.”
“Uh, yeah, so I’m going to go get ready,” Harry said after awkwardly clearing his throat, having to practically tear his gaze off of Draco, scratching the back of his neck.
“When does something not happen to me?” he sighed, looking across the room, raising his eyebrows slightly at Draco as if to greet him, who tried not to smile in response, looking back down at his work. “Um… I was kissed.”
Hermione grabbed Harry’s hands, surprised to see no ring on his finger. “Uh… you said no? Even though he wants you back?”
Their deal to meet at Pansy’s ran past September. They had never addressed it. Harry would Apparate from wherever he was hiding, exhausted, happy to be with Draco, who’d Apparate from Hogwarts, which was way more relaxed in the sense of Apparating. Also, it didn't quite matter, because he was a Death Eater. He would describe how much Hogwarts had changed, and how much he hated it. Harry would be vague with whatever he was doing, but it was easier to just address things rather than hide behind the rules. Harry was more open about how he was feeling. Sometimes he'd confess how anxious he felt, or that he was missing someone. Other times he'd listen to Draco rant about how frustrating his father was. And to their surprise, it helped. Talking actually helped.
Draco bit his lip, his eyebrows furrowed. It took a lot for him to not stand up and go after Harry, but he knew that would make things worse. It would make everything so much harder.
“You’ve been through a lot,” Hermione frowned. “I’m just trying to make sure you feel comfortable around us.”
“Draco, I’m always here if you need anything, you know that right?” Harry asked, leaning upwards and kissing Draco’s cheek before intertwining their hands together.
“Harry, what was that all about?” Hermione asked as they walked to their next class, which was Potions, which they had with the Slytherins too.
Draco wrote, and wrote, and wrote until he was almost asleep at his desk. He would write the most random thoughts that would pop up in his head. But he would also write the thoughts that had been lurking in the back of his mind for months.
She nodded, sitting down beside him. “I’ve already prepared for it. I don’t have… anyone in mind right now, so I think if Harry doesn’t show up… the best option is just to go through with it. After all, we can’t let our parents down.”
“Are you out of your mind? Of course we’re going to come,” Ron shook his head. “That’s out of the question. But I do think we should think this through.”
Harry sat in his dorm, holding the poem in his hands tightly. He hadn’t realized it earlier, but looking back, the poem Draco was writing seemed awfully similar to their situation. But… it couldn’t be, right? There was no way. Otherwise, Harry had just unintentionally told Draco they love each other.
On Friday morning, Harry woke up after a rough night. He hadn’t been able to fall asleep. There were too many thoughts circling in his mind. It was hard to do anything this past week.
His warmth was back, but still, Harry knew it wasn’t right. He knew Draco was safer listening to his father.
Harry looked over at him, instantly regretting what he had said. “I’m really sorry, Draco. I’m being inconsiderate. This must be really difficult for you, too,” he said, shaking his head. “I’m really sorry.”
“Very well, then,” Bellatrix said. “Send the prisoners down to the cellars. Except for the Mudblood.”
“Will. You. Relax?! You’re giving me a fucking headache!” Harry cut Draco off from his ranting, rubbing his temples before taking another sip of his coffee. “Look, they don’t hate
Harry shrugged. “It’s not fair to him,” Harry said with a sigh. “I want to keep what happened between us.”
Once Harry pulled away, he gave a lingering look towards Draco before turning and laying back down on the bed, pulling the duvet over them both. Draco wrapped an arm around Harry, and they stayed that way under the Gryffindor finally managed to fall asleep, his soft snores making the Slytherin slowly fall asleep as well.
He put it on his left wrist, staring down at the tiny bird. It was a thoughtful, meaningful present. The bracelet actually suited him. He decided to keep it. It was too pretty to throw away.
A knock on the door shot him out of his thoughts. He said ‘come in’, knowing it wasn’t his father, thankfully. Lucius usually knocked more sharply and loudly, the authority behind it clear. He smiled slightly at his mother, who shut the door behind her gently.
Harry chuckled. “Yeah, but no one really annoys me - except for you, of course. It… gets quite boring for me. Everyone’s having a conversation and I… I need Hermione to translate what’s happening.”
Each morning, he’d promise to confront his feelings, maybe consider going back to Britain, but every night, he’d find himself in a random club. Searching for silver eyes. Searching for the smile that made his insides turn, searching for the touch that made him feel safe, that made him feel at home. But he knew he was far away from home.
The two had spoken at the same time, so suddenly that they were taken aback. Blinking in surprise, they were interrupted by Hermione, Ron and Astoria entering the living room.
The two were in silence for a few seconds, before Harry burst out laughing. “Dear lord, things are sure going to be awkward at breakfast tomorrow.” Draco nodded in agreement, sighing.
“...right,” he nodded, trying not to seem caught off guard. So Harry really hadn’t told anyone about the two of them. This was surprising mainly because from Draco’s understanding, Harry was really close with Ron and Hermione.
On that dull, Monday morning, Harry instinctively reached to put on his hearing aids, then quickly kept them back on his bedside table. He didn’t want to hear anything today. He wanted some peace.
“Don’t you get it, Harry? I never loved you, and I never will. The only reason I was with you was for Voldemort. Did you really think I’d have been that careless to let you find out about my Dark Mark? It was because I wanted you to. Because I wanted you to think I was a victim. You were a fool to trust me. I think you’re worthless, useless, disgusting. I never loved you, and I never will.”
It was as if they had never crossed paths. The hallways were much quieter. The communication between the Gryffindor table and the Slytherin table in the Great Hall had come down immensely.
A shirtless Draco grabbed his wand and pointed it at whoever barged in. He rolled his eyes when he saw that it was only Pansy. Draco was the only one in his dorm. He always liked using the bathroom after his dorm mates because everyone would leave for breakfast and he’d have the room to himself while he got ready.
Harry turned to face Hermione and Ron who were caught up in their own conversation, bickering about their schedules, before turning back to Luna. “Sure.” He said and stood up, leaving the hall with Luna.
Hermione looked over to Harry, who was continuing to walk, unfazed. She finally nudged him when Draco said his name a third time. He stopped walking, confused, following her gaze.
“There are only three ingredients,” he folded his arms. “Come on! What about the Invigoration Draught?”
She shook her head at him, then sighed. She had meddled enough. She didn’t want Draco to get mad, nor did she want to pressure him into anything  “Well… if you feel that’s best, then I suppose I support that.”
“Hey, mate,” Ron said from behind Harry, hugging Harry for a long moment, before turning to Draco. The two awkwardly shook hands.
He blinked. “Do you think I want this, Pansy? I’m trying to protect both mine and Harry’s lives here. This isn’t a joke. If the Dark Lord is really back… we’d be at opposite sides of a war. What don’t you understand?”
She put her hand over his, nodding. “Don’t force yourself to make a decision if you’re not ready. In the meantime, maybe you should think of seeing him again.”
“You’ve been grinning all day, you know,” Hermione said as she noticed Harry smiling to himself again as they entered the train. “It’s a bit alarming, actually.”
“Why not?” asked Draco, starting to grow impatient. When Harry didn’t answer, he scoffed slightly, following his gaze to his arm. “Do you think I’m going to run off to tell my father about the dreams and visions you’re having? Is that it? You think I’m a Death Eater?”
He averted his gaze to Draco, who cleared his throat. “I’m thirsty. I don’t suppose I could just ask for some tea?” he asked, to which Harry simply shrugged. The two stared at the table in front of them, and suddenly, two cups of piping hot tea appeared. Draco picked up one of them and set it closer to Harry’s reach. “Drink up. I asked for chamomile.”
“Except you are,” he cut her off. “You knew how hard this would be for me, and you intentionally tried to make it worse.”
“I don’t love you despite your imperfection, Draco, I love you because of it,” Harry answered softly. “Anyone who sees it as something that should be held against you is wrong. I’m not perfect either. Far from it.”
“I trust that it’ll work out,” Harry said, referring to the war. “And if it doesn’t… well, we’ll just have to see.”
“Yeah, well, that’s understandable. And do you also feel like an idiot for giving up on the relationship so easily?”
After breakfast, Harry took his time to get back to the Gryffindor Common Room - it wasn’t as if he had anything to do.
Harry had said everything way too fast, way too quickly for anyone to even comprehend it. But he smiled slightly, feeling as if a small weight had been lifted off of his shoulders. Hermione, looking as confused as ever, took a few seconds to even realize he had stopped talking. She cleared her throat.
Hermione hesitantly slowed down, turning around to look at him, her gaze moving to someone behind him. Harry turned, following her eyes to Blaise, who he guessed had been trying to get his attention.
Draco didn’t do anything but watch him. He studied Harry’s long eyelashes, his pink lips, and his injured nose. He saw very light freckles on the bridge of his nose, and he watched as Harry breathed in and out.
Pansy turned to Harry after watching Draco go inside his dorm, “Did something happen between the two of you?”
“I prefer Scarface, Ferret.” Harry cut him off, winking and smirking. For the rest of the walk, they occasionally bickered but it was mostly silence and a lot of staring into each other’s eyes.
“You have no right to do that,” Draco hissed, his eyes piercing into Harry’s. Harry slowly opened his mouth to speak.
“I haven’t seen you for two years and you greet me like that?” Draco folded his arms. “Not cool, Granger. Oh, sorry, it’s Weasley now, isn’t it?”
Wincing, Harry stayed on the ground, opening his eyes on looking up at the concerned silver-eyed boy who was leaning over him. The music continued to play and as the two stared at each other, they burst into laughter.
Pansy nodded. “Be right back.” She ran into Draco’s dorm and came back two minutes later with many clothes in her hands. “Let’s go to my dorm, everyone’s already left for breakfast.”
As it turned out, Harry went to dinner at the Weasleys’, not surprised to see Draco there. But what did surprise him was that Ron, Hermione or Astoria weren’t around. It was only him, Draco, Molly, Arthur, Ginny and George. Molly said the three had gone shopping for some last minute recipe she wanted to cook. Harry wondered if three people were necessary or they just didn’t want to deal with the heavy, tense atmosphere that loomed every time Harry and Draco were in a room together.
When their heated make-out session was over, Draco fixed his shirt and rolled his eyes, muttering something about Harry not giving him a proper hickey as he opened the door, looking around before quickly slipping out, and Harry exiting a few moments later as if nothing had happened.
“Oh, yes but, just wait! I’ve got gifts for the two of you,” Molly said, rushing up to the two of them and each handing them a box.
“Better get your eyes checked out,” Harry said, but he was trying to fight back a smile. “I need help with a few potions, but I think I need to master these spells first.”
At that exact moment, Hermione and Pansy went running to Harry. Pansy immediately helped Harry up, with help from Hermione.
The awkwardness had somehow managed to die out soon after Draco had greeted all of the Weasleys. Draco ended up in a heated discussion with Hermione about some book that Hermione thought was amazing but Draco hated.
“Of course. Anyway,” she fumed, continuing to sign, “what is the reason behind this? This is the third time this week I have heard of a commotion between you two. It has come to my attention that it has been because of you, Mr. Malfoy.”
“I wasn’t expecting you to lounge around my room,” Draco rolled his eyes. “Anyway… uhh… He said maybe. I’m not entirely sure what that means, but...”
“I don’t need to understand. I don’t need to be able to help,” Harry whispered in a soothing tone, using his index fingers to draw circles on the other’s hand, slowly taking Draco to sit on his bed.
She put an arm around him. “You did the right thing, Draco. That can’t have been easy. Choosing between him and your family.”
Hermione stared at the two of them. “I… genuinely can’t tell if you two are dating or are still enemies,” she said, then paused. “Harry, what’s that in your ears? Oh my God, are those the Wizarding hearing aids?”
“I heard you’ve been getting special lessons from Dumbledore,” Draco raised an eyebrow. “Teacher’s pet, are we?”
He gulped. “...okay,” was all he could say. She couldn’t know about him and Harry, could she? He had tried his best to not speak of Harry at all, and he spent most of his time in his room when he wasn’t being forced to attend Death Eater meetings.
She smiled at him, the exhaustion in her eyes clear. “I’m alright. I’m sure you got the letter from your father… that I can’t hear at all anymore.”
Pansy placed a hand on both of their shoulders. “I’ll be in the other room. Holler if you need anything.”
His stare was heavy, it was intoxicating, it was somewhat tense, but it made Harry feel at ease. He thought of his lips on Draco’s and felt his face heat up. There was no denying it now. The blond had definitely been listening to their conversation. Harry looked down, shaking his head, his face pink.
“For the last time, Malfoy,” Harry wasn’t the best at lip reading, but he could make do when all that came out of Draco’s mouth was the same bullshit. He shoved him backwards, “I’m
“What’s there for me to say?” he shrugged, sinking down on the chair. “I don’t want to do this anymore. I’m just… so sick of all of it.”
“Don’t do that,” Draco told him, instantly noticing his fists and placing his hands over Harry’s, unclenching his fists. “It was fine… stop looking at me like that. So it wasn’t fine. So what? It’s never fine.”
After everyone was settling on the table, Harry exchanged glances with Draco. So far, only Narcissa had managed to make a nice impression towards Harry. And maybe perhaps one of the house elves, but that was it. Lucius Malfoy had kept his icy expression from the moment he had entered the room and until now.
“Sure,” he replied, looking over to Draco, who was smiling at Astoria. It was so easy to forget he was married when it felt like they were the only two people in the world. He had to push it away. They got to the kitchen where Molly was arguing with Ginny about cupcakes. They took the things out of the bag.
“There was nothing that could be done. You don’t think I tried warning Dumbledore, even if it was subtle? He told me to stay silent before I could even utter a word… he knew already. And what do you think would happen to Draco if they found out he wasn’t really-”
“I mean…” Pansy spoke up, fiddling with the things on Umbridge’s desk, “Draco, you come from a family full of Death Eaters, and there’s been five years’ worth of rivalry and distrust between you two. I don’t blame him. On the other hand…” she looked up, startled to see everyone staring at her. “Did I overstep?”
Fuming, Hermione nodded. “Fine. But if anyone asks you why you were being so loud in your bedroom, I’m not covering for you. Hopefully I won’t see you until Hogwarts, Malfoy.”
“Oh, honey,” she smiled, and in a bizarre plot twist, wrapped her arms around him tightly. “Of course not. I’ve always had a feeling, you know.”
He turned back to Draco, who was still staring at him, almost nervously now. Harry quickly scribbled down a note that said ‘meet me at the seventh floor during lunch’, watching as it made its way around the classroom.
“No buts,” Draco managed to say firmly and gently at the same time, jumping off his desk table and lying down beside Harry on the bed, taking his hand and touching the gold ring. “I know this is hard to comprehend, but if I hated you for it, I probably wouldn’t have given you this ring.”
Draco chuckled. “It helped, thank you,” he said while signing, looking down at the letter in his hands. “It’s my mother,” he blurted suddenly. “She’s fallen sick again.”
All Draco wanted to do in that moment was to die, because only he knew how much he didn’t deserve the pure love from Harry.
“What about the Potter kid?” Lucius asked as he entered. Draco and Narcissa turned, and the atmosphere had immediately turned sour. “Off you go, then, Draco. Your mother and I have… some matters to discuss.”
A confused Harry turned to look at Draco who seemed just as confused as he was. Harry quickly gathered his stuff and made his way to Pansy.
“Don’t call it a second date. Just ask to hang out today evening.” Pansy said. “That makes it easier.”
Harry felt the hot tears run down his face, his chest hurting as if it was scalded. He turned to leave. Just before he pushed past the curtain, Draco spoke, springing up Harry’s hope.
“I couldn’t just push her away! She was sad,” he pointed out. “I don’t suppose you would push, I don’t know, Hermione away if she kissed you while she was sad?”
He looked into Draco’s eyes, then shook his head. “I’m sorry,” he said, wiping the tears off his face that he hadn’t even noticed were there. “I just… I forgot where I was for a second. I’m fine.” He moved to stand up, but Draco pushed him back gently.
Pfft.. hey, guys... it's been a while... There's probably not many of you left, but I hope you all are safe and well! Here's another chapter (good luck remembering what this fanfic was even about)! Happy reading!
Harry nodded, slowly taking off his glasses and putting them to the side. Draco leaned down and kissed Harry’s forehead.
“I’m surprised you’d even want to talk about me to your relatives,” Harry raised an eyebrow, leaning forward, a small smirk on his face. “Am I that important in your life, hmm?”
“Don’t worry, it’s not you,” Ron said, sensing his best friend’s misery. “She’s been like that all day. She’s worried about her own stuff.”
“I think you’re better than most poets out there. You know, you kinda get straight to the point while still managing to have some hidden meanings in there.”
“I admit, what I did was stupid,” Draco said, sitting down across from Harry on the floor. “Avoiding your letters. But I’ve realized that we can’t do this, you and me. I don’t- I don’t want to be in a position where I have to choose between you and my family. I didn’t think it through.”
“Sure!” Harry quickly got up, fixing his sweater before turning to face Draco, who was taking his time getting out of his bed. Harry walked over to Draco and fixed his sweater and tie which had become messy.
“He had mentioned in the letters that his father wasn’t particularly happy with Draco. Maybe he’s not letting Draco come to Hogwarts.” Pansy said carefully, looking over to Hermione before turning to Harry.
“Not my fault that I think you’re deaf, you sit at the front of the class and can’t even hear what the teachers are saying.”
Taking a sip from his drink, Harry, shut his eyes for a moment, feeling the scar on his forehead burn. Gulping, he opened his eyes, wincing. It hadn’t hurt in two years. Was being around Draco what sparked it for him? Swaying a little, he shook his head, trying to snap out of it.
“Right. Are you sure Cho didn’t see you again?” Ron asked as they walked past the Slytherin compartment. Both him and Hermione snickered. “You know, maybe for a round two…”
Hermione sighed. “What happened?” She asked in a hushed voice. Ginny stared at the three. Just as Harry opened his mouth to speak, all three of them turned to look at Ginny who was staring at them intently.
“I guess we’re both stuck with bad luck, then,” Draco said, moving forward. He leaned downwards and brushed his lips against Harry’s ever so gently, as if to ask for permission. Their hearts were pounding as Draco kissed him again with more confidence, trying not to smile when Harry put his arms around his neck. It wasn’t a wet kiss this time. It wasn’t awkward and nor did Harry feel like it was some sort of obligation to be kissing Draco. It felt like a need that needed to be fulfilled.
Draco wrapped both his arms around Harry, kissing the back of his neck, making him shiver. “I know, darling, and I’m sorry,” and his tone sounded so genuine, Harry knew he meant it. “We could spend the summer…” he trailed off into silence. “Actually, I’m not sure if that’d be a good idea.”
Draco’s cheeks flushed. He coughed slightly, sitting back down. “You can’t even eat properly,” he mumbled, but he was smiling. “Whatever. I love you too.”
“I still don’t know what to do, Harry.” Ron whined after Harry and Draco stopped glaring at each other.
“Just enter,” Harry said. He looked around before quickly opening the door and entering. Draco hesitantly followed, looking around to see a somewhat empty room. “This is the Room of Requirement.”
“Well, it’s kind of hard when I just found out we’re soulmates,” he said, and the two smiled for a brief moment. “I just… I’m sorry.”
“That would be most appreciated, thank you. Is there any way I could repay you?” Harry mocked, wondering if he was pushing it too far. But he couldn’t stop the words slipping out of his mouth. Draco bit his lip, showing a clear sign of unappreciation. He grabbed a hold of Harry’s hand and handed him his wand.
“Draco,” she said, narrowing her eyes. He slowly looked over at her, fearful. “Do you have a crush on a boy?”
Harry sat in the Room of Requirement that evening. Draco was late. He was never late. He was either early or they would catch each other in the hallway just while entering, Harry under his Invisibility Cloak. But Draco was never late, nor would he stop writing poems. Maybe Harry
“Really? I’ve always been here.” Harry said, referring to the fact that Ginny could have talked to him any time.
“If Harry Potter comes too close to you, he will suffer... some serious consequences, let’s put it that way,” Lucius Malfoy explained.
”Well, try your best to make that answer a yes. I’m sure he just needs some time, alright?” Pansy said sympathetically. “You two just need to... rekindle your love?”
“Do you have the heater on full blast or something, mate?” Ron asked as he entered the room, walking over to where Harry was sitting at his desk. Picking up one of the potions, he stared at the beautiful colors. “It’s beautiful.”
So after a few secret letters to each other back and forth, they soon decided that their meeting day would be Saturday.
“No, I’m not,” he shook his head. “I was way out of line. I guess it was because I felt offended when you told me to shut up or whatever. Either way, I’m sorry.”
She glanced up at him, then sighed in defeat, still glaring. Pulling a note out of her pocket, she handed it to Harry. “Pansy gave it to me amidst the chaos. Said it’s for you.”
Harry quickly scribbled out a reply. Then he put the note on Draco’s notebook, gently so Snape wouldn’t see.
Draco frowned. “I’m so sorry. This is all my fault. This is probably so awful for you. Do you ever… regret being with me?”
“Leave it,” he pushed Draco off of him. Slipping on his shoes, he stood up, turning to leave. Draco scrambled out of the bed, blocking his way quickly. “Draco, stop it.”
“Well, whatever Pansy said makes sense. You had time to try it out. Why’s the distrust coming up now?” Hermione asked. “Not that I blame you. Malfoy’s not exactly trustworthy.”
Draco tried not to let his irritation get the best of him. “Would you like me to demonstrate, then?”
“What?” Harry stared. “You need to start signing even a little bit if you’re going to talk so fast.”
“Rambling?” Harry raised an eyebrow, his eyes sliding over to Draco, who seemed to be laughing while talking to his friends.
Because, suddenly, Draco was on the floor, trembling, panting, starting to shake uncontrollably, blood starting to seep through his white shirt.
As Harry walked down the hallway to go to his dorm, he wanted to walk back. He wanted to enter the library again and take back what he fucking said; because he didn’t mean it.
“Do you wanna go upstairs to relax for a bit?” Luna asked sympathetically, taking the glass from his hands. He nodded, barely able to see the room. His head was spinning and his ears felt like they were underwater.
“Harry, eat,” Hermione ordered, getting annoyed with him. She dumped a lot of food on his plate. But Harry didn’t eat even a bit of it. He tried to take a bite but immediately felt like puking, so he pushed the plate away and replaced his with someone who was finished with their food and left to make sure Hermione didn’t get upset.
The green-eyed boy slowly turned Draco around so he was facing him, raking his eyes over the other’s chest before stopping short, noticing the scars all over his chest. Harry slowly took a step back, laughing slightly as he put his hand out and traced one finger over one of the scars, jumping slightly when a memory hit him as soon as he touched the scar.
He played with his fingers, staring down at his feet. “It just feels like I’ve talked to you about things I couldn’t even dream to say to my friends, through these poems. And you don’t judge me. I watch you quietly chuckle at the poem, maybe smile. Sometimes I catch you reading over it again and again. And… it feels like we’re really friends.”
Meanwhile, in Malfoy Manor, Draco was in his room, frowning as he stared down at his notebook. He looked up to see his mother entering the room, smiling at him sympathetically. He absentmindedly rolled down his sleeves. It was the peak of summer, yet he still knew better than to wear short sleeves now.
“Was that a requirement?” he asked, his face inching closer to Draco’s, who laughed slightly. “You know, they say it’s bad luck if you don’t kiss under the mistletoe.”
“Oh, good, because I thought that was just me,” Draco let out a sigh of relief, pulling Harry to his chest. “You know, we could still create a life together. I can get divorced. Astoria wouldn’t mind. We’re already in an understanding that we don’t love each other. I could move away from my stupid house and be with my real family. That would be you, by the way.”
“Why?” he asked, and in response, Harry grabbed his hand and tugged him until he stood up. “What are you doing?”
“I’m there,” Draco said. “It’ll just take some getting used to. I don’t care if you’re a pureblood or not. They shouldn’t either. You’ll be fine.” Well, the truth was, Draco didn’t know if he would be fine. Sure, things with the Weasleys had gone quite smoothly, but the Malfoys… well, needless to say, they were a whole different story.
Harry slowly looked down and saw Draco’s pale hand with a piece of paper. Harry looked up at Draco, but Draco wasn’t looking at him. He was pretending to take notes. Harry slowly reached down at took the note, propping up his textbook so he could read it properly. Harry hesitantly and shakily unfolded it.
“There are books in the library for it,” Harry said after a moment, mainly because he was still trying to process what Draco was saying. “Seriously, you don’t need me for this.”
“I told you, I have a boyfriend,” Harry murmured, his eyes still shut. Draco chuckled slightly, turning around to look at Harry.
“I fucking hate you,” Draco whispered, tears welling up in his eyes, “get out of my goddamn sight.” Turning away, he Apparated back to Hogwarts. He had managed to hold back the storm of tears, and he had managed to fight the urge to punch the wall repeatedly, or perhaps punch his father repeatedly.
The white-haired boy studied Harry’s demeanor as he sat at the desk, getting out his homework and textbooks to work. His every move seemed so fragile, almost as if he was afraid. He also stared down at his work and rarely looked up during classes, nor did he engage in conversations with anyone other than Hermione or Ron. Hand slightly trembling, he stared down at the paper in front of him, then back up at Harry.
“I like it better like this,” Harry said, reaching out and running his hands through Draco’s hair. “It’s not nice when it’s gelled up. It looks better when it’s like this.”
The person wrapped their arms around Draco’s neck, pushing him against the nearest wall and kissing him deeply.
“Morning, lovebirds,” Pansy greeted as Harry entered. Hermione, Ron, Luna, and Pansy were all staring at Harry, then at Draco after he pulled the Invisibility Cloak off of him.
Harry had spent the past month or so pacing, pondering, imagining, daydreaming. He found himself unable to focus, nor did he go out much - well, it wasn’t as if he had been going out too often anyway. His shop was closed more often than it was open, but none of that seemed to matter to him.
“I always think you’re pathetic anyway. Isn’t that the whole point?” Harry asked, lightly patting him on the shoulder to ease the tension. He wondered why there needed to be tension at all. Draco was probably the one person he had talked to the most in the past three weeks.
“I should have said it sooner. I should have told you.” Harry said, using one of his hands to stroke Draco’s cheek. Draco adjusted his legs and held onto Harry tighter. “I can’t believe I didn’t tell you that I love you sooner.”
“He’s just tired,” Harry said to the rest who were raising an eyebrow, surprised that Harry was going along with Draco’s dramatic act, watching as he ran his fingers through Draco’s hair and held him tightly. “He’ll be fine once he sees the fireworks.”
“Okay, ew,” Pansy said, rolling her eyes and turning away. Ron just gagged, Hermione rolled her eyes and Luna smiled.
The funeral occurred. Draco didn’t show up for the funeral. Ginny stayed close to Harry, attempting to comfort him. It didn’t work at all, for Harry. No matter how mad he was with Draco, no matter how angry and betrayed he felt, he couldn’t help but miss him.
He looked up, waiting for Harry to finish, but he simply sat there with his mouth slightly open, frowning. “Tomorrow’s… Saturday,” he finished, gulping nervously. Draco nodded, a small smile on his face.
“As I was saying, I think it’s best if we go back for Christmas. Ever since Fred…” Ron trailed off into silence, biting his lip. Harry nodded, frowning as he bit his lip. “Harry, you’ll come for Christmas dinner, right?” Ron paused, then added, “And… I suppose bringing Malfoy along wouldn’t be the
With that, she left, shutting the door to her office behind her. Hermione and Ron both turned to Harry, who looked extremely frustrated. “How did she find out about this?” Hermione asked in a low voice, shooting a glare at Draco who was looking at her, frowning.
“Really committing to this act, aren’t you?” he said, folding his arms as he took a step forward towards the two. “You always need the attention to be on you, don’t you? First it was Cedric’s death… and now these stupid lies you’re spreading around. You could at least try to have a year where the spotlight isn’t on you.”
Harry woke the next day and got ready before going to breakfast. Everyone got their schedules and so did he. Harry glanced over at the Slytherin table in the hall, only to see that Draco wasn’t there. He opened his mouth to say something about it to Ron when Harry saw Draco entering the Hall.
Harry sat down on the bed again, glad to have calmed him down. He took a mental note to talk to Hermione about it as well, but the exhaustion was starting to kick in, and he still had a full day of celebration yet to go. Everyone had been hyping up Harry’s birthday, especially because they knew he had been down because of Sirius.
Ginny Weasley, who was sitting next to Harry, choked on the water she was drinking, spitting it out all over her plate, coughing violently. “I’m okay,” She said croakily, patting her chest and drinking more water to calm herself. Draco snickered behind his hands, trying his best to stop laughing, which made Harry start to snicker too.
“You… you…” Harry cut him off. He was refusing to believe it. “No, no, it can’t be. Tell me you’re joking. Tell me this is a big, cruel joke.”
“I think it’s a little big for me,” Harry stated (completely oblivious to the fact that Draco had been checking him out) , looking down at the silk pants’ ends that were under his feet because they were too long for him.
Somewhere along the tangents in his mind, he had managed to leave the windowsill and snuggled into bed, eventually falling asleep. His thoughts had been racing more than ever lately, and he wondered if it was the stress from Voldemort or his incapability of trusting his own boyfriend. Well, that was a relative term now.
Pansy gave Draco a look, one that said, ‘Aren’t you going to go check on Harry?’. Draco rolled his eyes and shook his head, but slowly stood up and walked down the hallway to where the dorms were.
“You did! You could have come to me! Draco, I told you I would have understood! Unless you actually want to kill him?”
“Oh, it’s a bit stupid,” he snatched it back from Draco. “Once it’s done. And if you tell me what you’re doing here?”
“Oh, I’m fucking sorry, have I upset you? I thought you were the one to bring up the fact that I have no parents.” Harry replied, blinking innocently as he shot daggers with his eyes.
Harry turned to the clothes. It was a Slytherin Quidditch Jumper, and another set of silk pajamas. And then it hit Harry.
Harry turned to see where what used to be a blank wall, there was a door. Draco was really in the Room of Requirement. Harry took in a deep breath before slowly entering.
Harry took out his wand from his pocket, slowly stepping out of the kitchen. As he did so, he bumped into someone, but instinctively took a step back, putting his wand to their neck. His eyes filled with recognition when a pair of silver eyes looked back at him.
“He’s right there! Why don’t we just hand him over?” One of the Slytherins shouted. All of a sudden, the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaws stood in front of Harry, facing the Slytherins. Pansy quickly stood up and joined them, slowly going to stand beside Harry.
“I’m used to you annoying the fuck out of me,” Harry retorted. “But it’s a good kind of annoyance, I suppose. Beats Ron and Hermione’s constant bickering. Though, obviously, I have no way of being able to tell if it’s bickering or a normal conversation. I don’t really speak to them much.”
Draco shut the book and put it back on the bedside table, turning and walking over to the door to exit. He had to tell Harry.
“Draco, don’t you think this is a little too much?” Pansy asked, frowning. “This doesn’t seem like a good idea-”
Draco was practically just standing there, waiting for his father to come outside. Draco let out a shaky breath, slowly turning around to face his father. “Goodbye,” said the blond in a more mocking tone than a genuine tone, “see you next year.”
He blinked in surprise. “Your mother? But…” he stared down at the piece of paper, reading through it again. “Oh.”
“Dodger, no,” Draco said slowly. He was still for a few seconds, and so was Dodger, before he ran towards the window to close it. But Dodger was too fast.
“You know, there is one reason I’m glad I’m deaf, Malfoy,” Harry took a step forward, sizing him up. He was unsure of how loud his voice was or if his speech was comprehensible, but at that moment, he didn’t seem to care. “I don’t need to listen to any of your bullshit anymore. Though, four years was enough for your God-awful voice to come in my nightmares.”
As they entered Hogwarts Express to return to school, Harry kept an eye out for Draco. Had something happened? This was strange. Even for whatever reason Draco had stopped writing poems, he wouldn’t ignore his letter, would he?
“You know what’s ridiculous? Me coming back for another year,” Harry signed with one hand as he tried to eat. “There can’t have been zero deaf wizards until now, right?”
Harry didn’t know what to say. Just then, the three heard footsteps approaching. Dumbledore cast a binding spell on Harry once again, and Draco quickly picked up the cloak, walking over to him and pulling it on Harry so he wouldn’t be seen.
“Morning, Scarface,” said Draco in an amused tone, “You look stunning today.” He was standing at the door. Harry jumped, slowly turning around to face Draco, rolling his eyes. He wiped the drool off of his face and fixed his hair that was sticking up in different directions.
“I didn’t think so either,” Draco spoke, and this time, he signed while speaking. “I didn’t want to see you.”
“No, it wasn’t. I already told you, I don’t like her anymore. If I ever did, I mean…” he trailed off into silence, thinking about Cedric again, then shook his head. “Listen, don’t tell Hermione I have a… girlfriend.”
Harry looked at her, trying to hide his surprise. Though before the conversation could go further, Hermione slammed her hands on the desk, glaring at Pansy, who just smiled coolly back at her.
“Hey, Harry,” Draco greeted. Harry turned and smiled when he heard Draco behind him. “Okay, go to your dorm. I’ll be right there.”
“I sure as hell hope so, Draco,” Harry replied, biting his lip as he frowned. Draco slowly opened the large doors of Malfoy Manor, entering the mansion.
“Take whatever side you want,” Harry rolled his eyes. “Spoilt Slytherin asshole,” he murmured under his breath.
“Um… you know Draco’s coming, right?” Ron asked almost carefully. “How did your date go, by the way?”
“Hey, hey,” Harry cut him off in a gentle tone. “Calm down. You were talking too fast for me to lip-read, but I think I got the gist of it.”
“You weren’t following Draco, were you?” Hermione asked, ignoring Ron. Harry choked on his bite of food, having to cough it all out, loudly too.
“Yes,” Harry said. He quickly said the password and walked through. So did Draco and Pansy, under the Cloak (that they had taken from Hermione, which Hermione had taken from Harry without his knowledge).
“Lemonade?” he asked, raising an eyebrow at her, looking down at the glass. “You didn’t strike me as the type.”
“Yeah, I’m sure. Let me just not finish my education, that’s doing what’s best for me,” said Draco sarcastically.
Pansy shook her head. “No,” She replied, frowning. “We exchanged a few letters. He said he would be here today. I don’t know, though. Maybe something happened with his father.”
Harry quickly put on his clothes, pocketing the letter, and slipping out of the person’s apartment - whom he guessed was Peter? Or Phil. He couldn’t remember, nor was he in a desperate attempt to try.
“What are you two arguing about this time?” Hermione asked with a sigh, shutting her book and putting it aside, finishing off her breakfast.
Harry was looking around before slowly turning to Draco. “I’m really sad, you know,” Harry blurted, his green eyes widened as he stared into Draco’s silver ones. “You know Malfoy?”
“Look, Potter won’t even attempt the spell today,” Blaise nudged Draco, who looked at him in disgust.
Draco shook his head as he sat down on the table at the front of the classroom, the table which was closest to Snape’s desk. “None.”
“No. I don’t know,” he responded, feeling his eyes well up again. He hated crying; once he started, he just wouldn’t be able to stop. “We both said awful things. But the bottom line is, I wanted to be there for him, and he didn’t let me because he can’t trust me.”
Caught off guard, he quickly cleared his throat, looking down at his book, shaking his head. “No, nothing. You just… um… seem different.”
“Oh Merlin, I have feelings for…” Harry didn’t finish his sentence which frustrated Hermione deeply; not knowing who his secret girlfriend was annoyed him. “Sorry, ‘Mione, I think it’s best if I keep her identity secret for a while.”
“When Draco finds out, you’ll be having more than just one moment of weakness,” Harry muttered, adjusting himself on the bed and turning so that his back was facing Draco, who was silently chuckling to himself before he left.
Despite Hermione’s tendencies to be early, they were actually late for once. Everyone was already at the party. Harry found it odd but a little nice to see her laidback and relaxed for once. Maybe it was because she was too afraid to be sharp with Harry. While he was grateful for his friends worrying for him, he felt rather irritated that he was treated so delicately, almost like glass.
“It was nothing…” Harry said, slowly sitting down on the couch. “I just wanted you to be comfortable. After all, walking for twenty-five minutes just to reach here gets tiring.”
“Strange,” Hermione replied. “Usually you wouldn’t have done that. Maybe your girlfriend is making you sweet even to your enemies.” Hermione added, just to tease Harry.
“I was going to apologize. Ask you if there was any chance you could take me back, any chance at all.”
“Um… your hair,” she gulped, too surprised to respond to his horrible joke. “It’s… um, where’s the brown streak?”
Draco stood up, knocking the glasses on their table over, grabbing Blaise by the collar and pulling him up. The chatter in the pub had quietened down, and all eyes were on the two. Harry, clueless, followed everyone else’s gaze after noticing they were gaping at something.
When Harry woke the next day, it was his turn to be frantic. He sat on the bed as Draco entered the room, handing Harry a cup of coffee.
“Why? Why do you need to know? Will you die, or something, if you don’t know? You don’t need to know anything, this shit doesn’t concern you!” Harry furiously wiped his eyes to the point where they were burning of the dryness, refusing to cry.
“Yeah, we just decided to have a small Christmas dinner with mine and Astoria’s family,” he cleared his throat, taking a sip from his drink. “I’ll try to come this Christmas, but I’m not sure what the plans are yet.”
“What, do you need me to write you a poem to help you believe me?” he asked, and Draco snorted. “Ahem.
As Harry walked down, he heard some movement. Harry slowly looked up and jumped when he noticed Draco standing right in front of him.
He put the sweater to his nose, breathing in the distinct scent of Harry, then quickly pulled it over his head. Picking up the journal on his bedside table - along with a quill and some ink - he creeped out of his dorm and sat down at the Slytherin Common Room. He opened the journal, flicking through the poems he had written. As much as he didn’t want to admit it, Harry had helped him find a new hobby; a way to express himself. The problem was most of Draco’s poems were about Harry, and with their fight, he couldn’t find much inspiration.
“I guess there’s no point in telling you… I think this is something you should find out for yourself.”
“Wait, please,” Draco said, realizing he would have to put aside his ego to get any help from Harry. Standing up, he quickly grabbed the others hand, stopping him from walking away. He turned around, staring down at their hands, confused. “Just… hear me out, please?”
bond with Potter. I cannot have that happening. Soulmates are disgusting, as well as painful and unnecessary. Especially if your soulmate is Harry Potter. Honestly Draco, I really didn’t want it to come to this; but it seemed that there was no other way to convince you.”
There was a stunned silence, and Harry felt his throat closing up, unable to look Draco in the eyes. Letting out a bitter laugh, the blond shrugged. Words couldn’t describe the humiliation - or perhaps the hurt - he was feeling.
After everyone left, Draco quickly slipped and left to his dorm. He couldn’t take it anymore. He grabbed a piece of paper, a quill, and ink.
“Harry, you alright?” Hermione asked, but her voice seemed almost distant. He put a hand to his forehead, nodding slowly.
“Really?” he asked, his voice trembling slightly as he held onto her, “because… I feel like I’ve known for a while. I just… put it away. Avoided it.”
Throughout the rest of the week, Harry’s speech was minimalized. He barely spoke out loud, and during their next Charms class, he didn’t even attempt to take his wand out when they were trying to learn a new spell. Blaise sat back in triumph, while Draco beside him wanted to slap the smirk off of his face.
“Why did you two fight?” he asked. “I’ve… never seen you look so hurt before. I was worried. Again, like I said, not my place.”
“You didn’t hear the last part?” Pansy asked, disappointed. “Harry said that he’s becoming soft because of his ‘girlfriend’, which is you, obviously. Your boyfriend is really cute.”
“We… things are shaky between us…” Harry finally said, letting out a sigh. “Long story short, he stormed out of the room three days ago, and we haven’t talked properly since.”
“Christ?” Draco asking, blinking in confusion. “Well, whatever. Romilda Vane, that bitch better watch the fuck-”
“That’s me,” Harry said with a shrug, adjusting his glasses as he slowed down his writing, looking over at Draco. “You never want to just make out. Are you tired? Did something happen? Did someone insult you? Did someone-”
“Well, since you’ve been wishing for it since first year…” Harry started, then let out a laugh when Draco smacked him on the shoulder. “I don’t know why, but… it feels easier to be around you than most people lately. So, yeah, I’d say we’re friends.”
“It’s more like a few tears. I… don’t really allow myself to feel sad about Cedric and everything else, so… I suppose it comes through frustration of other things, if I’m being honest. We all need a good cry, don’t we?”
Harry adjusted his glasses, squinting at her as he came back to reality. “Who?” he looked around the group, then cursed under his breath when he noticed Ron, Luna and Ginny weren’t anywhere in sight. The next few events were a blur in Harry’s mind. The only thing he should’ve been thinking about was what Lucius Malfoy had just told him, and saving his friends. Saving Sirius.
Then everyone stood up to get to class. Draco and Pansy bickered all the way to class, about whether Draco was in love with Harry or not.
“Come on, Harry, you could ask him for your birthday! It’d be like barely anything for him. He’s rich.”
Reluctantly, he did as asked, and Harry realized it was the first time he had seen Draco wear short sleeves. His eyes moved down to Draco’s forearm, where a Dark Mark was clearly imprinted, who quickly put his arm behind his back.
“Ah, yes. They don’t allow us to be in separate houses, though, and Quidditch is simply out of the question… it’s really a pity. All of us had quite a lot of fun playing the sport,” Harry explained, awkwardly eating the food. It wasn’t that the food was bad, it was just that he felt odd feeling Lucius Malfoy’s eyes on him as he ate.
Then she left, and it was just Harry and Draco, who moved to the couch, sitting back. They were exhausted.
“Merlin, I’m stupid,” Draco squeezed Harry’s hands. “But here, listen to me clearly.” He paused, looking up at him, eyes glinting under the moonlight. He let go of Harry’s hands and as he spoke, he signed, “I love you."
“You know, you can ask me to come to stay at Grimmauld Place with you, right?” Harry said with an eye roll, but squeezed Draco’s hand gently under the blanket, sneaking a smile at him, before turning to Ron. “What about you guys?”
“You may continue with your work,” Snape said after all the students stared at him expectantly. “This will remain your seating arrangements until I say so.”
“You’ve been set to some work, Draco,” said Lucius Malfoy as he entered Draco’s room. “You were not there for the meeting last night. The Dark Lord was not pleased.”
“Malfoy, Potter!” Professor McGonagall practically shouted, running towards the two. Draco, who was pale and clutching his cheek, seemed to have guilt written all over his face. Harry turned to see the professor, cursing under his breath, letting go of him. “Both of you, my office.
He looked down at his hands. “Oh. Thank you. Pansy insisted on putting it on me. And you know, once she sets her mind on something, it’s hard to tell her to stop. Especially when it’s to embarrass me.”
“Hush,” Harry said, kicking his shoes off, trying his best to feel the vibrations through the floor. “Now, I don’t know any other dance except for the Yule Ball one, so we’re going to have to do that. I’ll lead.”
“It’s still my turn. I choose the color red… and uno,” Harry said as he set down a skip-turn card, then a normal red card. “I win.”
All Harry hoped was that Draco didn’t really mean that he couldn’t be with someone who didn’t ‘trust him’. Draco knew that Harry trusted him with every strand of his being, didn’t he? Draco would never… not trust him, no matter what…
“Be enemies? We only ended up this way because of you. If you’re done with your sob story, I’m leaving.”
“No. Especially not on your birthday,” Draco sat down on the bed again, and Harry followed, gazing at him intently. “Stop looking at me like that.”
“And… there’s no one for miles,” he replied, tracing his index finger up Harry’s chest and wiggling his eyebrows rather suggestively. Harry let out a laugh in response. His face was a deep shade of red.
“Alright, I’m going down,” she said. He grunted in response, and she placed a hand on his shoulder. “Chin up, Harry.”
I'm so, so sorry that this took super long to come out, but I had the absolute worst block that lasted for 2 weeks straight.
“I just didn’t see the point in anything for a while,” Harry mumbled. “Right, the coffee shop is just here.”
“Are you sure you weren’t an accident?” He said, making Blaise, Goyle and Crabbe laugh. Draco felt terrible for saying it and immediately turned away from Harry, grabbing his bag and leaving the classroom and waited right outside for Pansy so he could talk to her.
Narcissa scooted up and took the blankets off his face, stroking his hair gently. “Just let your father undo the curse on your wedding day, Draco. Then get divorced and go back to Harry.”
“And I think we should still be together, but we always can’t get what we want,” Harry snapped, then took a step forward. Draco gulped and stepped further away from him. “Please, Draco,” he whispered. “Why are you doing this to me? I love you.”
This is literally the last weekend before school starts skjssks so I don't know how often I will be able to post chapters (I have this thing where I get the most inspiration to write in class, and zero inspiration to write during the holidays).
“Yeah, thanks,” Harry said with another eye roll, but stared when he took notice of Draco - his silver eyes were glistening, his hair looked silky as always (Draco finally stopped gelling his hair up), sharp cheekbones, soft looking lips and clothes that complimented his body perfectly. “Wow,” Harry said before he could stop himself.
Still trembling, the white-haired boy refused to look at his lover’s killer in the eye, reluctantly getting out his mother’s wand that was in his pocket, and Apparating away.
Perhaps it was because their scar/mark was hurting, or maybe it was because the memories were hitting both of them at the same time. Whatever it was, they both were suddenly getting riled up.
With both Draco and Pansy taking turns, it was a bit more difficult, but he was able to work with it. After about five more minutes, the three of them came to a stop, tired out.
Harry was going to protest, he was going to open his mouth to say something. But something told him that he should let Draco talk.
The two sat in silence as Draco took out his WSL book, trying to sign a few more words. He stared down at the book in confusion when he got to the phrase ‘can I help you’. Holding his hands up, he flinched when Harry reached out, then relaxed a bit. “What are you doing?” he asked.
People were starting to show up in the hallways. So, before Draco could retort back, they were forced to throw on Harry’s Invisibility Cloak.
“As much as I’d like to blame you for this,” Hermione cut him off, “I know it wasn’t you. You loved him. Your father did this, didn’t he?”
“It’s not about that,” he shook his head. “The Dark Lord is back, as you know. It’s just… complicated with my family right now. Apparently, we need to prepare for his return…”
It's late for me as I upload this so I'm sorry if there are tons of mistakes, this is not proofread lmao
Hermione completely let go of Harry, causing him to trip over his own foot, not expecting for her to do that. She rolled her eyes and sat down at the Gryffindor table and Harry clenched his fists in annoyance, turning to the Slytherin table, sighing at the Slytherins who were now laughing at him as he joined Hermione at the table.
“Thanks, you too,” Draco murmured. As Harry had been checking out Draco, he was doing the same to Harry. He was studying his beautiful green eyes and his messy brown hair and his cute nose and his glasses and his scar that he always liked to hide behind his hair.
“Talk to me, Draco,” she said in a soft tone, placing her hand on his shoulder. “I’m on your side here. You know I love her. I’m only worried.”
Pulling his t-shirt down, he made his way to the kitchen, craving some tea. As he turned on the kettle, he leaned against the table, trying to ease his throbbing head by massaging his temples.
(p.s. I didn't proofread the chapter! I'll do it a bit later, sorry early readers if it's a bit wonky or some grammar is bad)
“A… while,” his voice was low, almost as if he was afraid to say it out loud. “You know, with everything that’s going on in my family… he helps me forget. He doesn’t even realize it. And… his laugh is so sweet. It…”
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Didn’t seem like something stupid,” he muttered, grabbing Draco’s hand. The two watched as a gauze bandage appeared. Harry picked it up and started wrapping it around Draco’s left hand, where the wounds were. “Hermione said my name was mentioned. I don’t want to assume, but…”
“Because,” he looked down in embarrassment, biting his lip, “maybe if you forgot, things don’t have to change again.”
Draco let out a soft, low moan as Harry’s hands slowly trailed down to his thighs. Harry stopped kissing his neck, slowly looking up at Draco, slowly taking a step back. Draco opened his eyes and nodded at Harry.
“How can you say that? When I have this?” Draco pulled up his sleeve aggressively, looking away. He couldn’t even look at his mark. But to his surprise, Harry took his arm and gently brushed his lips against his mark. “Harry, stop. You’re being an idiot.”
Draco was confused as he read it. He turned and saw that there was a Gryffindor Quidditch jumper, and a sweater with H written on it.
“Heard that, Draco?” Pansy said with a wink. Draco and Pansy had been walking right behind the three Gryffindors.
Harry mockingly waved his hand, as if to say ‘go ahead’. Draco stood up and slowly took a few steps towards Harry, who, with each step, started to feel more nauseous. By the time Draco reached him, Harry was struggling to keep his consciousness. Reaching forward, he gently touched Harry’s cheek, bringing it back as soon as they both felt it burn.
“Listen, Molly, I… I suppose I haven’t properly apologized for my words and actions as a child. I was under the influence of my father-”
“Draco, do you want some of Hermione’s foundation and concealer again? I can give it to you, you know. Hermione won’t mind - hopefully.” Harry told Draco gently, shutting his book.
By the end of the day, Harry flopped down on the couch before putting on his hearing aids again. “My arm hurts. Can we stop now?”
“Should’ve thought of that before you decided to get on my nerves,” he fumed, backing away from the lake, then throwing the hearing aids the furthest he could. Harry watched in awe as it sank into the water, frozen for a moment. Then he turned to Draco, a stone-cold expression on his face. He practically ripped off the robes that seemed to hold him back, grabbing Draco by the collar and pushing him against the nearby tree.
Harry didn’t mean to say it. It just slipped out of his mouth. Draco was getting aggravated at this point. The two were past the tears, only feeling pure anger towards each other now.
“Don’t,” Harry bursted, frowning, stepping closer to him carefully, too panicked to even try and understand what he was saying. “Draco, don’t. Please.”
“Of course,” he replied, smiling. He picked up his coat, feeling everyone’s eyes on him as he left. Draco felt his heart sink as he watched him leave. He needed to open that book again. What was the advice on being married and on weird terms with your soulmate?
Harry accompanied Dumbledore to find the Horcrux. When they returned, Harry was trying his best to find someone to help Dumbledore.
“--And I just find it ridiculous that Romilda wanted to smuggle me a love potion. She’s really so annoying. Draco, are you okay? Is something wrong?” Harry asked, suddenly noticing that Draco looked on the verge of tears.
“He’s been like that all day,” Hermione was saying in a low voice, frowning as she looked over at him. Ron and Ginny turned to look at Harry, who was curled up on the couch in the Gryffindor Common Room, staring into the fire. “Harry,” she said in a gentle voice, tapping him on the shoulder.
“Daphne?” he repeated, yelping when he smacked him. “Kidding! But come on, I’m your best mate! Was it Cho?”
“I’ve been sleeping better,” he answered, taking a sip of the tea. Harry didn’t question why he wanted to change the subject. “Like you said, they obviously wouldn’t be able to get rid of the nightmares, but… at least I get a few hours in.”
Harry laughed in response. “A little too deep.” he paused, then looked up. “Can we not tell anyone, by the way?”
The next day, Harry walked to the tent to check on how things were. He noticed that the two jumpers he had left were gone, to replaced by something else.
The following Monday, Harry’s day started off relatively normal, feeling a bit at ease that Ginny wasn’t following him around anymore.
He turned to her, fuming. “Stop it, Pansy,” he snapped. “Stop meddling. Seriously. Making us sit together at the dinner table? We’re not school kids anymore, honestly! These are feelings you’re playing with.”
“What? No. That was totally out of the line and incredibly stupid.” Pansy told him. “I was talking about drawing your wands out and pointing it at each other. You know, Harry, the good ol’
Draco carefully finished off his poem, waiting for the ink to dry before folding it up. “Send this to Potter,” he whispered to Pansy, who handed it to the girl beside her. Eventually, it made its way around the class and to Ron, who tapped Harry on the shoulder, handing it to him under the table.
“Well, that clearly wasn’t the best thing to say,” Draco muttered to himself after he was thrown into his room and locked in there without his wand or luggage. At this point, he wasn’t even surprised; but he was wondering why his father was so firm about keeping Draco at the Manor - what was he planning? Draco was sure that it couldn’t be anything good.
“Yeah yeah, good morning,” Harry mumbled, walking over to the bedside table to grab his glasses and fix his hair.
Harry and Ron sat down on either side of Hermione, grateful that she saved a seat for them like she always does.
“...Draco, that’s so stupid.” Harry said softly. “You should have just walked inside. What if I was there? Then you would have lied and it wouldn’t have been good for you if they found out.”
Harry stared at him for a few moments, unsure of what to say. For someone who had told him he didn’t love him anymore, this was strange to hear. “Er… well they usually all hang out without me, and even when I do go, I just… I don’t know… I’ve kind of been out of touch with my friends.”
“But that’s what’s normal to me. You being Malfoy, an absolute prick, trying to find new ways to get under my skin. I agree, the hearing aids were too far, and I’m really glad we were able to move past all of that and become friends.”
Snape started the class and told them to write an essay. Since Harry sat on the right and Draco on the left side of the table, it was helpful. Draco was left handed and Harry was right-handed, so the two could hold hands under the table. Of course, it was risky so the two did it very slowly and calmly so Snape wouldn’t notice.
Meanwhile, Harry was already eating, today actually making an effort to listen to Ron and Hermione’s conversation. He had another nightmare and wasn’t able to sleep much, but still, knowing that today was Saturday eased him, since he could see Draco again. He looked over to the Slytherin table, raising an eyebrow when he noticed he was reading a letter.
“Mate, fix your hair,” He stated. Harry, confused, walked into the bathroom to look at himself in the mirror. The streak in his hair was bright white, contradicting his semi-dark brown hair. He raised an eyebrow. Maybe it was a wizard thing. He had no time to think of this now. He was having a huge headache. He instantly regretted drinking that much Firewhisky all because he couldn’t handle not being able to kiss Draco.
Draco slowed down his quick scribbling, then nodded. “Yes, I remember. We can… do a late lunch? Here?”
Draco thought of just leaving the book, but his curiosity got the better of him. After all, it had been roughly five months of wondering why the book could possibly be so important that Snape had to leave it for him.
“From last summer. This time, when you came back. You’re different. It’s hard to explain,” she said in response, frowning. “I can only assume that you are having problems with someone you’re dating.”
“You won’t leave me here while I’m asleep?” Draco asked softly, slowly shutting his eyes, already knowing the answer as he relaxed himself, getting comfortable.
Harry knew he should have pushed her off. That he should have told her he was in love with someone else. That he didn’t like girls. That he didn’t like her.
“What kind of question is that, Draco? The Dark Lord can see into Harry’s mind. What is he going to do when he sees all these memories with you? He’s going to use you to get to Harry. And your trust from The Dark Lord will be taken away. You know what he threatened to do if you don’t carry out your job.
He moved away from Harry, sitting down across from him. “I was, uh… supposed to do that extra credit work. But the Room of Requirement ended up bringing me here for some reason.”
Draco leaned forward, pressing his forehead against Harry’s. “I know, my love. It hurts me too. More than you could imagine. But we have to stay strong.”
“Remind me why I’m here again?” Pansy folded her arms. She had rolled the sleeves of her white shirt up as she clutched her wand, looking back and forth between Draco and Harry. “I gave up a date for this.”
The day had gone by slowly. The party didn’t start until six, and Harry didn’t plan on opening up shop today. He just turned on the TV and watched some shows to distract himself from thoughts of Draco or anything to do with the fact that he had only a month left to make a decision.
The two slowly walked out of the dorm, Harry smiling and Draco still upset over the information he had just found out.
Draco stared at him in disbelief, but the darkened expression in his father had tinged a fear in him that was all too familiar. He nodded, leaving and entering the room in a well-mannered position, trying to remember everything he had learnt as a child. Hold your head up, even steps, and more importantly, be the most confident person in the room.
“Yeah, well, he doesn’t make sense either,” Harry replied, looking down at his food. Ron and Hermione exchanged glances, but said nothing in response, choosing not to comment on the fact that he was smiling.
“Harry, let’s go outside,” Hermione said as soon as she noticed, guiding him to the backyard. Clutching his stomach, his face had gone completely white. “You okay, Harry?”
“Don’t these strands of my hair look white to you?” Harry asked, turning to Ron, keeping his hair pushed back to show him.
Harry put a hand to his hair as he felt his dyed streak itch. Turning to the oven, he saw his reflection, noticing that it was white again. Draco quickly took several steps back, fear creeping into his eyes.
Draco rolled his eyes when she grabbed the book from his hands, scanning the cover that said ‘Wizarding Sign Language for Beginners’. She opened it and flipped through some of the pages, seeing that he had left all sorts of notes and bookmarks. Blaise, who had entered with her, was peeking over her shoulder, snorting.
“Er…” Harry glanced down at his textbook that Draco quickly grabbed so he couldn’t read from it. “Come on! Just tell me the first ingredient.”
They were seated in the Room of Requirement once again. Harry missed the smell of light dust and Draco’s faint cologne in the air. He studied Draco, who was sitting beside him. He was still in his school uniform, but his tie was loose and the collar button of his shirt was undone.
“There’s Potter,” Blaise spat. “He’s been doing spells again, even pronouncing it properly. I wonder if that Mudblood has been teaching him that.”
Neither of them knew how they ended up that way, but they sank down to the floor, Draco still crying, and Harry hugging him, never letting go once.
Draco was gazing out the window. When he heard Harry coming up the stairs, he moved aside, making sure to be a good five feet apart from him (cause they’re not gay).
The morning went by roughly. Harry kept his mind on the poem, and as beautiful it was, it bothered him. Who was the poem about?
“Just getting to know her,” Harry said honestly. “I didn’t know that I would ever go on a date with her. I never even dreamed of it.”
Draco sat down across from Harry in the room of requirement, a small smile on his face. “Are your hearing aids working fine?” he asked as he got out a few textbooks, adjusting his white shirt. It was a bright Saturday morning, and the light from outside was seeping through the windows.
also thank you for 200 kudos! also (i write this on a doc before uploading it on here) this fanfic reached 200 pages lmao, so happy 200 <3
“It doesn’t work like that, Harry, not with you and me. We don’t have the liberty of having a normal relationship,” he mumbled. “We can’t break up when we feel like it, and then apologize when we want to get back together. I thought this was clear.”
“No, no, I’ll go get some myself,” Harry said with a slight sniffle, “Just… I don’t have any night clot-”
Draco slowed down when he finally reached the entrance too. The doors were closed. Hermione and Ginny walked about to talk about her fight with
Harry turned and when he made eye contact with one of the owls, all three came flying to him, each having a paper with them. The owls dropped the letters in his hands and went back to the table, patiently waiting for Harry to tell them something or give them a letter back.
Harry walked to the entrance of the forest on Saturday morning after dinner, to see Draco already leaning against the tree.
“No. Father,” he whispered. “I felt free for once. I knew what I wanted to do. But he ruined all of it. I’m not happy. I’m alive, but I feel so dead. Without him, everything is meaningless. He made even the smallest things so much better.”
“How would you know?” Draco asked. “Y-you don’t know what I’m capable of. You don’t know what I’ve done…”
Harry sat back on the couch, shutting his eyes for a moment. He was barely listening to Draco. “He’s gone,” he whispered. “I can’t believe he’s gone.”
“What? Oh, yeah,” he replied. “It’s strange, isn’t it? It’s not like I heard it recently, but… somehow still got stuck in my head.”
When Harry entered the Room of Requirement, he noticed Draco was already sitting at the table. He looked up as the other entered, and the two stared at each other until Harry made his way to the table.
“Oh, um, dispute,” Hermione signed it for him again, then once more slowly, smiling proudly. “I just learned it yesterday.”
him this. That I didn’t want to be in a situation where I had to choose. But here I am, like some bloody idiot, wishing that I was with him, but I’m too much of a coward to actually do it.”
Unsure if he should smile or nod or ignore his existence, the seeming trance placed on him was broken by Hermione who nudged him. “What do you want to drink?” she signed.
Harry kept his eyes on him, then shook his head. “Anyway. I guess we should talk about something else. We’re on thin ice with rule two,” he smiled. Draco tried to give one back, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes. Harry just leaned forward and kissed him on the lips carefully. “I love you,” he mumbled against Draco’s lips.
GUYS I'm so sorry for a late update! I had the worst block and I couldn't write. I hope you liked this chapter! Merry Christmas!
“N-no,” Harry whispered, “I didn’t- I… Fuck, I…” Harry looked away, unable to stare at the scars anymore, his eyes glistening with tears. “No, I…”
“I’ve done the research necessary, and I’ll do more until we have to leave,” Hermione replied. “We’ll stay for the wedding. Then we’ll go.”
got our friends to believe us,” Harry said with a sigh. “If Ron or Hermione had interrogated me further, I probably would have blurted it out right there and then.”
“Well, no, but I did finish it in time, and now I get to relax rather than trying to finish it two days before the due date,” he said, then noticed Harry’s dejected expression. “...it’s alright, I said I’ll help. Just start the introduction, alright?”
?” Harry repeated as if what Draco had said was so crazy; a bitter laugh escaping his lips. Harry looked up at Draco, pressing his lips. “Well, there you fucking go.”
“Draco, it’s been two days. Everyone’s really worried, and Blaise is locked out of his dorm… Please, just open up?” Harry asked through the door, knocking lightly again. Everyone from Eighth Year (except for Draco and Harry) were in the Common Room, pretending that they were unable to hear Harry speaking.
Molly nodded, a sad look on her face. “I certainly do miss him, that boy. I know he was already hard to get a hold of after graduating from Hogwarts, but… at least he was around.”
“Shut up,” Harry said, but he was grinning as he moved over and sat down on Draco’s lap. “Merry Christmas, Draco.”
On nights where Draco had nightmares, Harry would turn on the dim lamplight at the bedside table, grab a book and hold Draco close, reading out stories to him, mostly ones from Draco’s childhood. The mornings after, you’d find them sleeping in odd positions, either curled up together or completely apart from each other, the book somehow on the other side of the room.
“Uh, that’s literally what I just asked you.” Draco didn’t feel the need to be formal with Snape. After all, Snape was always around Malfoy Manor, having meals with his family. Snape was Draco’s godfather, after all.
Draco slightly flinched at the mention of his name, however, Lucius took no notice of it. “Go alone. Out of all of the Death Eaters, you know him best. Look at places he would go.”
“Hmm? No. Oops.” Harry realized, quickly fumbling around, looking for his Potions textbook, getting it out. “I reckon I should do it now, right?”
“I think you should come. You haven’t been out of the castle in weeks,” he stated outrageously. “You need to clear your head.”
They slowly walked inside. Inside, there was a couch, a small coffee table and on the other side, there was a slightly bigger table with all kinds of stuff. There were also fairy lights inside.
“But… I don’t even know if he’s gay, let alone if he likes the guy who threw his hearing aids into the lake.”
“You would never listen to me if I told you to stop dating Potter, right?” Lucius asked, raising an eyebrow.
Harry groaned but did as Draco said, crawling onto his lap in his new comfortable pajamas, giving Draco a very sloppy and wet peck on his lips.
“Well… uh…” Hermione struggled to answer. She turned to Pansy, hoping she would answer.  To her dismay, Pansy suddenly looked very interested in a nearby duck that was waddling around, which was completely unaware of the serious situation. “Pansy.” Hermione snapped annoyedly.
“Is he alright?” Harry asked, unsure of how to feel as Pansy ran after him. Seeing Draco certainly wasn’t easy, but he was trying his best to make it work for Ron and Hermione. It was nice to see familiar faces again, but his chest ached.
Gulping, he reread the poem a few times, trying to understand what he had just read. Since when did Draco add hidden meanings to his poems? Hell, since when did Draco become so good at writing one?
“Looking for you. Why aren’t you coming to lunch?” she asked, folding her arms. “Seriously, you’ve been acting weird lately. I’m a little worried about you. You disappear on Friday evenings, and you were gone today too.”
Harry gathered his stuff and caught up with Ron and Hermione, and they all walked to their next class, Potions.
Draco shook his head in disbelief, looking down at the sun, a smile on his face. “It’s beautiful, isn’t it, Harry?” he asked, nudging him gently. Harry, who had been staring at Draco’s face, reached forward and gently cupped his face.
After the two pulled apart, Draco stared at Harry for a few seconds, “So the reason you decided to meet up in the late hours of the night in the library was to make out with me?”
His eyes moved down to his lap, thinking of how Cedric’s stare used to make him feel nervous. He had been too afraid to confront his feelings. It was strange, right? To feel like this about another person, let alone someone who was also a male. He was able to push it away before. It wasn’t a big deal - Cedric was warm, caring, and kind, it was only understandable. He was a role model, a fun person to be around. It was only an infatuation, barely anything real.
