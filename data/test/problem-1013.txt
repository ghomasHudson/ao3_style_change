“I think that would be lovely. Thank you, Narcissa, for the offer. Would Monday be good to start?” Narcissa nodded gracefully.

“I hate to disappoint you, but I am not the type. Protect Harry? Be his shield, and a protector, absolutely. But I am not the slavering beast that you think I am Severus. I might have scared the shit out of you when we were in school, but I need you to understand that I was as much of a victim of that as you were. And given that I was just as close to death at the time, I would hope that you would have grown up enough to understand that.” Severus flushed an even deeper red at the comment. He knew that if Remus had hurt him, in any way, he would have been sentenced to the death penalty.
“Listen to me, wolf. I understand that you have a pack bond with my son, and that you were friends with his parents. I will let you spend more time around him than just lessons after the New Year. But you WILL be taking Wolfsbane potion every month, and stay in a place that I deem safe away from Harry on the nights of the full moon. And if I get so much as an inkling that you might be in danger of infecting him…” Remus interrupted him.
“I think I can walk.” Harry slipped out of the bed and pulled the covers back up, smoothing them so it looked like he had never been in it. Severus watched this with a tight expression, knowing exactly why Harry would do such a think and not liking it. He realized that he was going to have to do a lot of work to help Harry heal from what his family had put him through. Harry turned back to Severus, and Harry reached up to take the hand as Severus led him out of the infirmary.
“As a matter of fact, I am indeed quite knowledgeable,” Draco replied, keeping his tone on the edge of bored.
If it was a surprise for Draco, who hadn’t even realised someone had entered the room, Snape's presence was clearly expected. Dumbledore barely glanced at him before giving his full attention back to the book, as if the other man had always been there.
Professor Achebe’s eyes darted to the student “Pardon me, Mister —“ she asked, with a stern tone.
So, when a wisp of silvery smoke morphed into a phoenix, right before him, asking in Dumbledore’s grave voice, “Have you found him?”, his responding denial was resolute and confident.
He met Theo’s eyes and the other man mouthed “Wanker”. Yes, Draco was truly blessed.
In spite of what was expected, most of the Slytherin in Draco’s year had returned, making six of them when Pansy had joined the two girls and three boys already at the castle. Even with Pansy and Tracy not taking the NEWTS class for Defence, the boys and Daphne had been merged with the group of eight from the year below, making them in every way Seventh year students. Due to the increased number of pupils in the new combined system, the NEWTS periods, that normally included all four Houses, had been separated into two. That’s how the Slytherins came to share Defence Against the Darks Art with the Hufflepuffs.
“No” Draco said, barely audible. “No” he repeated, louder.
They sorted a quick lunch during which Draco tried to stand inconspicuously around the Muggle appliances he had no clue how to use, while still giving the impression that he was helping.
They said their goodbyes not long after, and when Draco woke up the next morning he was greeted with the confirmation he never wanted to receive.
Draco managed a weak “No.”, before she was gone.
Potter brought his friends back to reality and the moment was broken but the telling tinge of pink still lingered on their cheeks, their tired expressions a little bit brighter. The trio walked in front of the wall three times and Draco felt Vince and Greg move behind him. He made it trough the door just in time.
“You’re just a bad copy of your father”. Theo’s accusations echoed in his mind and, for the first time in his life, Draco felt he could reply “Not anymore.”
They occasionally engaged in trivial conversation, thanks to which Draco discovered that the other boy worked as a trainee pastry chef at his uncle’s bakery and doubled as a delivery driver during the summer months, when their usual hand flew back to Alabama to help with his family’s farm seasonal harvest. Not that Draco had any idea what that actually meant. He nodded along, offering little, harmless information about himself, but mostly listening.
“It’s not really that surprising.”
“Draco” his mother admonished, “I think it’s a good idea. A new beginning”.
The Gryffindor deflated “Tomorrow is— would be Professor Lupin’s birthday. I’m going to Andromeda’s to spend it with Teddy. I haven’t seen them since the opening of the Gardens. . .” He trailed off.
He cleared his throat, cheeks still pink, and Draco felt a thrill at having made him flustered, surprised that it lacked the old malice.
“Hey. . . Hello, everybody” Longbottom cleared his voice “Well, now that we are all here, we could decide the groups. We will take a break tomorrow but it would be nice to have them set up already for Monday”
“They don’t teach you how to ride bicycles at school, you nimwit!” He ventured, feeling less confident about such claims that his voice let on.
“And do you believe her?” Did he believe her himself?
Longbottom seemed somewhat satisfied and chewed on his lips like he wanted to ask more.
It was a sleek, deep burgundy Jaguar dated from the late fifties and, as little as he knew about cars, it had been his grandfather's pride and joy when he was alive.  It was a little precious memory from his youth that he had never had the heart to part from. But, a sports car that beautiful was of no use rotting in a garage and, with only a smidge of regret, he had handed the keys over to the new owner, telling himself that it was what his old man would have wanted. He didn’t have a driving licence, anyway.
They caught up with Macmillan and a few other Hufflepuffs half way to the third floor. Theo had been impressed by Ernie’s inclination to recognise Draco’s merits regardless of his house. The Hufflepuff had said that being quick to judge, even people like Harry, in his youth made him learn to give others a chance. Coming from a traditional Pureblood family, even if one with different ideals from Theo’s, he had been interested in the other boy’s decision to sell his Manor, which was an important symbol for wizards and witches of their status. Theo had replied “What status?”, and that got them talking. So, three weeks into the school year, the two of them had struck some sort of friendship.
Yes, still some are better than others, Draco thought, smoothing down the fabric of his shirt “I think I was looking for a confirmation that people can change, that I can be more than the little, stupid Death Eater.” He closed his eyes, pretending to be alone. Imagining he was talking to himself, getting the heaviness off his chest one stone at a time.
He called to his friend, who was sitting at the old desk they shared, head buried into his Arithmancy notes.
“I . . .”
The front door of the building was left ajar, and Scott pushed it, muttering something about a damn Mr Carl-something and his damn disregard for the rules. Draco followed the Muggle up several flights of stairs until they stopped on the third floor and continued down the corridor to the last door, marked 18C.
Draco could see the terror in the eyes of the smaller children, too young and innocent to fully grasp the meaning of what was going on but aware that it was bad.
“Anyway, ladies, I shall depart. I’ll leave you two to bond and figure out if this apartment sharing thing is meant to be. Eves, I’ll talk to you later. Dean, if I won’t see you again, it was a pleasure. Bye”. And he was out of the door with a dramatic flair that would have put Snape to shame.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Is there a way you can give her a message?”
He observed the photo again, a bit unsettled in its stillness. Half of him expected picture-Potter to lift the paper crown any moment and reveal his green eyes. Maybe do something completely insane, like wink at him. He was about to stick it back and search if he could find the other boy’s face in any of the other images when a voice from behind made him jump.
By the grace of Merlin he actually found a secluded seat on the bus and promptly dropped his backpack on the spot beside him, hoping that the Muggles would take the hint.
“Well, if you must know, I have solved all of your problems. The obvious ones, at least” He teased, before Draco felt himself being dragged helplessly into the room “Ellen found you a stray!”
Lupin was waiting for him in the corridor, hovering awkwardly, a bundle of clothes gripped in his hands like a safety blanket.
“Would you have done it?” Blaise asked eventually, because that was the point. The heart of the issue.
Remus.
“What are we going to do?” She asked, imploring for an answer. Pansy was a follower and, without a guide, she was lost.
Pathetic, the dying voice of his remaining sanity whispered in his mind, sounding a lot like the sneer that used to taunt Potter ten thousands years ago.
Professor Lupin sat at the small dining table with two cups of tea in front of him, far enough out of reach that they could have both belonged to Draco. Draco wanted to say no, thank you and fuck you. But there was no point in punishing himself and he peered inside the cups, picking the one clouded by a splash of milk.
Anyway, enjoy and if you want to tell me what you think about it, it would make me super happy as it’s almost my birthday. Fun fact, I do actually share a birthday with one of our heros. I won’t tell which, but all i can say is Leo at heart (although Pottermore placed me in Slytherin and I want to think I am a Ravenclaw).
I am going to add all the art to this chapter so I won’t continue to interrupt the narrative
Draco felt his fingers circling metal as soon as the other boy hit the grass below, and he froze. Suddenly he wasn’t miles from the ground anymore, barely feets, hovering in mid air like a feather. Weightless, lost.
“Neither can live if the other survives.” Dumbledore recited, mouth twisted in a grimace.
So, when Harry wasn’t at dinner, Draco believed that sadness was something Harry wanted to deal with alone. He was about to leave for the Dungeons, when he met Granger’s gaze. “Quidditch field” she mouthed. Go and get him. And that was it, Draco had no more excuses. It was now or never.
“Why did you come back?” He asked. Part of him hadn’t expected her to.
“Technically we are not open until 7.” She told him, glancing at the huge clock with no numbers as if it would confirm that it wasn’t 7 yet. Draco had no idea of the time, but his stomach rumbled quietly and she chuckled. “Nevermind, what can I getcha? I was just whipping the first batch of pancakes batter back there, or you can wait for Scott with the deliveries. Still warm from the oven, I’d bet.”
Draco felt the name Harry Potter ringing in his ears and he looked at him wordlessly.
The other boy remained silent, listening. Draco continued “He was the only Professor I admired. Probably the only adult, beside my parents. It didn’t fit his character. . . Don’t get me wrong, he was a bastard. But I’ve always wondered. . . Last year, with the Carrows, I think sometimes I’ve even doubted . . . But I was never sure.”
Draco turned “We have one. But no, I’ve never used it”. I never had memories I wanted to relive.
Theo didn’t disappoint. “You are getting mixed up in things way bigger than you.” He glanced around the room to make sure the other boys were paying them no attention and casted a muffilato, before digging his index finger painfully into Draco’s ribs “Somehow, I think you don’t fully understand what you have gotten yourself into.”
“Draco, no one would care” reassured Luna. She put a gentle hand on his shoulder and he felt like crying.
The Great Hall was empty but for a rather large round table, at the centre of the room. The Professors were occupying their normals seats. Only a few of them were already back, chatting amiably and seemingly ignoring the little group of students. About half of the table was filled and he spotted a few familiar faces. Most of them were seventh years or returning students. They were all sitting on the left side of the table, discussing together while helping themselves to the food. Thomas and a boy he didn’t recognise, but that was wearing an Hufflepuff tie, seemed to occupy the central seats and were surrounded by quills and parchments, and what looked like a sketch pad. He awkwardly took the seat next to Longbottom, Daphne going for the one after. The other students looked at them and, for a moment that in Draco’s nervous mind stretched way too long, there was silence.
Draco assessed the ridiculous boy in front of him, and laughed. He felt comfortable and a bit tipsy and the happiest he had been in a long time.
In the days waiting for his owl to come back, he had imagined his mother’s reaction. Maybe she would assure him it wasn’t a big deal, that a pureblooded wife would understand a man’s need to search for other pleasures outside the marriage. The idea had depressed him greatly. His father didn’t say much of anything, after the war, but Draco had pictured the disappointed look in his eyes.
Draco chewed on the inside of his cheek and pondered on what to do, not willing to comply without a fight. He itched for a fight, his magic coiling his muscles with nervous energy.
“You know, I knew your parents. We went to-“
Granger bumped into him, but she barely acknowledged it, looking frantically around. She held Weasley’s hand firmly in her own, dragging the ginger impatiently behind.
He barely had the time to register the pull, that he was suddenly face to face with the boy he had so valiantly tried to push at the back of his mind for the majority of the past year.
All the years he had spent hating the Gryffindor for being a privileged, unwarranted celebrity melted when faced with the fact that he didn’t really know the other boy at all. The things he had always accused Potter of being were born from his own assumptions and, admittedly, jealousy. Maybe it was the need to share something equally hard about himself, the desperation to return on common grounds and assure that no, his life wasn’t perfect either. Maybe it was the last, fading effects of the Felix Felicis that were telling him it was the right thing to say, but talking about his father was oddly relieving.
Draco was about to point out that he could have used one of his hands instead, when a bubble appeared from the liquid, inflating like a balloon and propelling the other wizard across the kitchen with a loud pop. It was over so quickly that Draco had to wonder if it actually happened, but Lupin’s slumped body against the cabinets was proof that something, at least, had happened.
Oh. Oooh. So the Ravenclaw didn’t want to jump on Granger after all.
Something had happened between the Gryffindor and his Ravenclaw during the holidays.
Draco came to his senses slowly, groggy with sleep and the disorienting feeling of waking up in an unknown place.  He shifted against rough fabric, coughing as a puff of dust filled his nostrils and made his eyes water. His mouth tasted stale and dry, and for a moment he wondered how much he had to drink the night before.
“Yeah. . . Mum said so too”
The other boy looked so comically offended that Draco couldn't help bending down to scratch behind the tabby’s ears, whispering “Don’t worry darling, let that vulgar boy keep his own Weasel. I think me and you are gonna be good friends.” He said the last part loudly enough to be heard, chuckling at Potter’s responding groan.
He was trying to contain the enthusiasm of the thank Merlin! threatening to spill from his lips when she suddenly looked at something behind him.
Dumbledore’s reaction caught him by surprise. The older wizard stood straighter, shaking his head. “What have you done. . . Oh, what have you done. I should have known, after Sirius. James and Lily. I should have seen it in your heart, one can only take as much. . . Please forgive the blindness of an old man”. He pleaded, louder, to the air.
“Uhm, no. I named him Ron. But she’s the one that rescued him, and he doesn’t seem to like me much.”
The threat, aimed craftily at the pupils,  had the power to make McGonagall hold her tongue, and both the student and teacher bodies fell quiet. Draco was disturbed that grown men would jeopardise the safety of what were mostly underage children. He had never thought about the other students of Hogwarts as possible victims of the war, probably never really cared before, but, after seeing Professor Burbage die, his little bubble had popped and now the reality of what was happening had hit him full force. He tried not to think about what would be of some of the wizards and witches that were in the Great Hall with him at that very moment if the Dark Lord was to win the war. People he had shared classes and meals with, or simply just passed across in the corridors, students that weren’t even fully qualified, just children or barely more. Somehow he doubted there would be mercy.
One hour. Luna looked worried. Macmillan was chewing his bottom lip apprehensively, glancing back and forth from Draco to the Gryffindor’s body. He seemed to have come to a decision, because he moved to stand behind the boy’s head and reached to grab him under the armpits. “Help me, will you?” He asked, nodding in Draco’s direction.
The money was good. More than enough to buy Harry a complete wardrobe and a new pair of glasses with a thick, square frame. They sat differently across his slender face, accentuating all the right angles of his cheekbones and altering his features slightly, so that he was still recognisable but, at the same time not quite himself.
Only his mother had ever loved him so profoundly. And even then, he was still there, fighting in a war he was raised into. Fitting like a cheap suit in a role he was led to believe he wanted.
When Draco didn’t respond her went on as if talking to himself “I guessed nobody was thinking of him. And I really don’t know how I feel, I mean he was a pretty horrible person to me my whole life. . . But he did a lot for me too. And he had to do it in secret, so that nobody actually knew who he really was. . . It must have been pretty lonely, so I wanted to remember him —“
“What do you want, Draco?” The largest of the two, Vincent, asked menacingly. Incidentally he was also the brighter, so he had taken upon Draco’s role as a leader.
“She is a bait” Draco added, because he wanted to say something. “They won’t hurt her”, because he wanted to believe it.
“Well, I’ll bring the Coke just in case.”
It was only when he had reached the corridor to the main exit that he let himself slowly come to a halt.
“Water. Yeah, water would do.” He replied, wishing his stomach to stop growling so that he could get going.
Now, though, as an almost 17 years old, Potter wasn’t too skinny nor short. Now, he looked every inch the athletic git his skills already advertised him as, and Draco was bothered. He had towered over the other boy for years, giving him leverage where the Gryffindor begrudgingly bested him in fierceness and lionhearted bravado. Draco was a sensible person, after all, not a reckless idiot. Potter had decided to grow, though, and Draco had lost that advantage, knowing he was hard to look intimidating with those green eyes so annoyingly levelled with his own.
Draco involuntarily searched for the Professors, but all the portraits were now empty.
Lupin ignored the jab, but his skin remained tinged.
“Allright, you know how he gets when he is inactive for too long. He was ready to bounce off the walls. I come from there actually, that’s why I’m a little late. Brought him breakfast, he was up at 5:30 if you believe it.” He told her, lifting tray after tray full of pastries from inside the crates.
“You were a better witch than me” he said, instead. Because that was part of the problem.
The hallucination didn’t go away.
“I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you,” continued Dumbledore. “But now at last we can speak plainly to each other. . . . No harm has been done, you have hurt nobody, though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived. . . . I can help you, Draco.”
His father, on the other side, looked on the verge of a breakdown and when he spoke his voice was hoarse “My Lord?”
The adults spared him an uninterested glance and concluded he wasn’t a threat as they resumed their grooming. The little one stared. Draco aimed a quick warming charm at the ground to seat more comfortably, supporting his back on a chunky tree, and stared back. The white glossy eyes of the foal were fixed on him, seemingly blind if not for the precision with which the animal followed his movements. With the curiosity of the youngsters the thestral tilted its head and took a few step forwards. Draco had never been fond of animals before but in that moment he wanted nothing more than for the creature to approach him. I am alone. I won’t hurt you. He assessed the skeletal body, the eerie grace in the slender structure of the folded wings, the slight disproportions of infancy and thought that even if not quite perfect, not quite beautiful, the animal was magnificent. The foal assessed him back positively because he came within Draco’s reach, letting the boy run his fingers on its bony snout.
Around 11 a small crowd had gathered at the entrance to the Gardens, marked by a delicate arch of jasmine. The gentle scent of the flowers danced in the air. People were wearing bright colours, because as McGonagall had said it wasn’t a funeral. As they passed the archway a multitude of enchanted tiny globes started to float around them, glittering gold and silver in the sunlight. They moved with the rhythm of nature, giving the Gardens a peaceful feeling. In the four corners, short, flat rocks, were positioned between random arrays of plants and flowers, to create bucolic seats for the visitors. The red chrysanthemum at the heart of the site moved gently in the breeze. One by one the families and friends of the fallen dipped their hands in the pots and threw their seeds in the air. The dark soil was soon filled with forget-me-not, and amaranth, and buttercups, primroses, saxifrages and so on. As each one of them approached, the earth under the gravel glowed different colours.
“I know. That’s why I forgive all the shit you pull. And just so you know, when I was really angry I used to imagine you were Kirley Duke”.
He rested his hands on his thighs, chest heaving with the intensity of his breaths.
On his way out he bumped into Blaise, calling for Theo.
Oh father, what fools we have been, living our life mocking people for being less when we feared they were, in truth, much more, Draco pondered sadly. The perception of not actually being that special that had hit him hard that time at 11, when Potter refused his hand for a Weasley, came back stronger and, more than ever before, he felt small and insignificant. The people that had worshipped him when his family was well known and influential were quick to turn their backs once the Malfoys had lost it all. And at the end, now that it could truly be The End, he was alone.
“I haven’t got any options!” He said, and he was suddenly feeling faint. “I’ve got to do it! He’ll kill me! He’ll kill my whole family!”
Harry shrugged “Just going trough some options”.
“Because I am a nobody. Greg has left, you know? His father wasn’t lucky like yours. . . And he left. He has family in the continent, and after Vince he couldn’t come back. But I have no future, no qualification. Who wants anything to do with the daughter of supporters of the Dark Side? And you know what’s funny?” She laughed bitterly “ — We were even too cowards to join Him properly”. Pansy’s parents had never taken the mark.
“Give him some credit, it was a last minute decision. Finding a new roommate for just the summer is always stressful.”
If it wasn’t for the lack of evidence of misconduct, he would have bet on being dragged into an interrogation as a prime suspect. Even Snape eyed him suspiciously these days. It was almost flattering.
The conversation dragged on, all his work unravelling in front of him, making him nauseated by what he had accomplished and what was still left to do. “You care about me saying Mudblood when I am about to kill you?” The whole idea sounded stupid, concentrating on something so righteous on a moment like this, when surely nothing mattered but trying to survive.
I’ll try to keep the notes short, so to spare you all my ramblings. As probably everybody else, I do enjoy to hear your opinions, so feel free to tell me whatever is on your mind 😊 thanks for reading
A couple of hours later Draco was slouched on the sofa, Ron happily sleeping on his stomach. Potter had taken seat on the floor, his back propped against the coffee table for support, bare toes plucking mindlessly at the plush carpet.
Draco felt like he was intruding, so he made to leave. He wanted to check on Theo anyway. He managed only a few metres when he was stopped by a couple, followed by a shy looking boy.
Draco recognised it for what it was, an offer to reestablish the comfortable levity they had settled in during the film and a way out of talking about his father.
He thought about Theo and Blaise, probably fucking in their empty dorm while Blaise mind was on Daphne’s tits and Theo’s on Draco’s sins. He thought about Potter, the bastard that got out behind everybody’s back, with the shape of Draco’s knuckles still fresh on his skin. Maybe Potter was a product of his insane mind, and they were all crazy. Maybe Potter was Draco’s first step into the pit and he was a killer after all.
Pansy’s nose scrunched up unattractively in laughter.
“Mother”. Mum.
Anyway, there is no Harry in this chapter but be should make an appearence in the next one
“Ah. Very well, and where do you think you are going? All students are required to follow me to the Great Hall” and he gestured back at the entrance of the Slytherin dormitories.
He didn’t have an answer, so he stood, emptying his half eaten plate in the bin and setting it by the sink.
“Okay”
It felt like opening his eyes underwater, the sting of tears just barely held in under salted eyelids, because Malfoys didn’t cry. Often. When it mattered.
Greg was stunned, his body falling ungraciously at Draco’s feet, who had just enough time to register it before Granger screamed. Like in the Manor. High, loud, terrified. Draco saw the flames before the two boys running away from them. They were huge, red. Hot. The room temperature grew quickly, suffocating. The fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts: Flaming serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up in the air into their fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, before being consumed by the inferno. Fiendfyre. Draco cursed. Then he looked at Greg’s unconscious form, and he knew he had to run but not like this. Not with Greg burning because he wanted to live. So Draco dragged him along, desperation making him stronger. He was still so slow. Too slow. Vincent had vanished and so had the Gryffindors. That’s it, Draco thought while he pushed Greg on top of a pile of desks, an useless attempt when the flames where so close he could feel the ground burning the soles of his shoes. That’s the end. Not what he had imagined, not what he had hoped. But death never is, a hope. Draco held Greg tighter and breathed in air and smoke. He opened his eyes to a hand dangling in front of his face, Potter hoovering in the air on a broomstick, looking determined. The grip was weak and sweaty and Greg was heavy. Draco knew it was pointless even before his hand slipped away, but still wouldn’t let his friend go. Death, a terrible one, but he wasn’t going to leave Greg to save himself. Not this time, not when it was the last thing he would do after fucking up so many times before.
“Oh” Harry said, a bit surprised “Well, I never played before. Anyway, the rule is no concealing charms —” He giggled louder. It sounded pleasantly warm. “But, you see, when making the rules Ron hasn’t considered my invisibility —“
Technically, he could even claim to have seen telly before, as his longest flight provided a small, black frame lodged at the back of every seat, where tiny Muggles moved around soundlessly, completely unconcerned about his existence. He had barely paid them any mind in return, before slipping into his potion induced slumber. Really, he didn’t see what the fuss was about.
Someone was calling his name, voice desperately trying to raise above the noise. And then arms were around him, his mother blond head buried deep inside the crook of his neck.
No time like the present, he told himself, trying to sound confident for his own benefit.
“Hello” Potter said smiling, with an awkward little wave that had Draco’s lips tugging at the corner in response. “I am Evan”.
“Hey” Draco said, for lack of better words.
“How did it happen? I mean, I thought you and the girl Weasley —“ He couldn’t help being curious.
The picture portrayed a boy that was most definitely Potter, standing under a banner proclaiming “Employee Of The Month”. A paper crown adorned with big, red hearts was pushed down over his hair and covered most of his eyes, balancing on the tip of his nose.
“Mind if i sit?” Draco asked, cautiously.
And people were scared.
As his eyes adjusted to the light he noticed a picture on the bed side table. A muggle picture, deadly still. Even like that, just slits caught in the middle of a laugh and barely older than 13, Potter’s irises were really that green.
“Boarding school together!” Harry finished for him. “Yeah, I remember. Although, I cannot imagine them in a boarding school. I mean, Aunt Petunia, for all she acts high and mighty, she is quite middle class really. I guess it does explain why she would hate her sister so much, but. . . boarding school, sounds fancy. I guess I don’t really know much about my parents”.
“Is he happy?” Draco’s heart clenched at the tenderness of the question, not quite proud of the jealous urge to deny the truth, to keep his former Professor stewing in his guilt.
He felt the need to defend himself, to explain it wasn’t what it looked like.
“My dear boy, let us have no more pretence about that. If you were going to kill me, you would have done it when you first disarmed me, you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means.”
The other wizard had acknowledged his help with Luna simply trough short nods in the corridors and quick hushed greetings, enough to let Draco know his plan was successful. He didn’t expect nor wanted a thank you. It was dangerous on both fronts to demonstrate any involvement, so they hadn’t spoken to each other since that time.
“I think what you just did shows that maybe you aren’t”. But Blaise reassurance was of little consolation.
It was the third day into the holidays when an house elf interrupted his family’s afternoon tea in one of the Manor’s fanciest drawing rooms to announce they had guests at the door. His mind was partially engaged by thoughts of Luna, so he barely acknowledged his mother’s worried expression when she left the room to tend to the visitors.
“What brings you here on such a terrific evening and all that crap?” He asked, rehearsing one of their previous conversations.
Lupin walked tiredly to the kitchen, as if knowing that Draco wouldn’t have been satisfied if he were to summon it with magic. Only when the younger wizards had stirred three spoonfuls into his tea he finally spoke. “He had never seen the ocean. 16 years and living most of them an hour or so from the  beach, and he had never put his feet on sand. What was I supposed to do? Almost a man and his only glimpse of water was on his 11th birthday and. . . And that went as well as it did. . .”.
Draco was back in the Great Hall, listening to one of the Ravenclaws, a tall brunet called Boot, yelling the story of how the Golden Trio escaped Gringotts riding a dragon.
Potter was in the castle and Draco was looking for Greg and Vince. He had noticed the vicious gleam in their eyes during the silent exchange they shared while slipping away from the evacuating crowd, and he knew they were planning something.
“Nonsense. I am sure the travel agency will help and you’ll be all set to go within a week.” He smiled, forcing the weight of the lies to drop back into his stomach.
“Only you could finish such a speech calling everybody an idiot” Weasley commented, still looking impressed.
Draco felt a wave of contrasting emotions and his feet taking him to Professor Snape’s grave. The tombs of the two former Headmasters stood one after the other, the only deceased to actually be buried on ground. Dumbledore, imposing and white, faced the calming waters of the lake. Snape’s, smaller and cut from a darker marble with black veins, faced the gardens.
The bell jingled again.
He would never taste someone else’s tongue in his mouth, and for the first time that year he felt the unwelcome jolt of raw want in his gut. His gaze lifted on its own accord.
The surprise at finding he had not been disarmed faded when Draco noticed the second wand poking out from the folds in the cushions. His stomach churned and he hastily snatched his own wand before scrambling for the toilet.
Drums roll for the big reveal!
“Coward” the girl hissed. Yes, he agreed.
Draco left before the other boy could think of a retort.
Would anyone else miss him, if he died, the way people would miss Potter? Potter, that had the name and the means to gain a crowd of adoring followers but instead spent his time building few but strong relationships. Meaningful. Important. Loving. He wished he could tell that 11 years old child that boarded the train feeling like a king that nobody would care for the shiny crown resting atop of the untended and forgotten grave. That a few people standing next to you are much more precious than the idolising thousand looking up at you from below.
“Yeah”
“You know, I keep thinking am I allowed? That I will go there. . . and people will think who could he have lost? All I could hear the other day was I don’t want to be with the Slytherins. . . That we are never going to be more than what someone from our House has defined us to be. Someone like my brother. And still, I miss him, and wasn’t he a victim of the war, in same way? The Patils lost their best friend because of someone like Stephen, but he was my brother and I don’t know if I have the rights to remember him. . . If my reasons for grieving are as valid as theirs. As the ones of people like Potter that lost so much. . . After all, Stephen brought this upon himself. . . But I know my pain is. . . And I’m not sure, I guess I’m just trying to fit in and make them see that I am like them. . .that I never wanted this. And that maybe I can be suffering too?” Theo paused, to blow his nose. His face was all blotchy and he looked like a lost child. “Is it stupid, that I want to do that? That I still love my brother and want to commemorate him in the same way of the ones killed by people like him?. . . Maybe it’s just stupid that I still love him, because he was like them.” Like me, Draco thought. “I was angry with him. . . Blaise knows, all I could talk about was how angry I was. But now I am just sad, and my family is gone too”.
With the second mirror safely stored at his grandparents’ Muggle house as the only connection left, it was time to let Harry go.
And that was it. And Draco heard his voice saying “If I might be bold, you” while he held his breath.
Draco had remarked that he was starting to sound more and more like Professor Snape, but in his heart he was grateful for Blaise.
“And don’t you forget it” the other wizard replied with a smirk.
Knowing that he would later regret sleeping during the day, he swallowed the entire vial anyway, grimacing at the medicinal aftertaste of the lavender. He was asleep, face smushed against worn cotton, in an instant.
“Do you think Harry will go?” His voice sounded brittle.
With a quick wave of his wand he watched as abused cartilage straightened, blood and dirt vanished, leaving no traces of what had happened behind.
“How do you know?” He felt childish, like throwing a tantrum, and tried to compose himself, “You don’t know what I’ve done, what I’m capable of” he spat, trying to sound assured.
A cloud of dust enveloped them and Draco coughed to free his lungs. The battle was degenerating fast.
There was resignation and acceptance in Dumbledore’s words, and for a short moment Draco let himself believe that that was it. The Headmaster’s last gift, for him only.
In a fit of anger he took out the journal and scribbled “I HATE YOU” across the first available space. He looked as the dot carrying his mother’s name rushed to the border of its own page. It almost felt like she was judging his childishness in disapproval.
“I thought that, since it sounds similar to your own, it would be harder to get confused.” There was an edge of danger in Lupin’s voice.
Lupin looked relieved, some of the weariness slipping off his tired face. “Thank you”.
I’ve noticed I am crap with titles, but that’s what the edit button is for once the light of creativity comes at me from above. Anyhow, I think i might be writing too fast and so im not sure about the quality of the work but i need to put the ideas down before my brain decide to never remember them again ever. Anyway, this story is not about looks but when i saw this picture https://photographymag.tn/people/portraits/portrait-photography-inspiration-not-my-fc-for-whit-but-kinda-close-and-they-dress-kinda-the-same-i-guess-lol/amp/.
“School is over” Draco said, stating the obvious.
Draco looked down at his new shoes, still doubtful. The black pair of high top sneakers stared back at him, not offering much consolation. “Absolutely not!”
Sorry 🙃
Draco swallowed, wondering if that was how Muggleborns felt when they first arrived at Hogwarts. It was overwhelming. “Er, tap water.”
They talked about the night events further when Dumbledore fixed him with a stern gaze, eyes firm but caring.
“We are out of caviar, I am afraid.” He sneered mockingly.
Draco, before, would have never given it the time of day. As it was, Draco now barely spared the chalkboard that inanely proclaimed “Come to the Math side, we have Pi” a glance and pushed the door open with a thrilling sense of anticipation.
Without checking if the other man was following, he started marching in what was hopefully the direction of the airport.
“Well, I don’t really get why Blaise would redo the year. He had top marks last year and could just take the exams privately. . . Anyway, it’s easier for you two, you did nothing of significance, no one would have problems with you coming back” he huffed.
“Ugh!!Honestly, Draco!” He yelled, leaving him gobsmacked and the few heads in the room turning towards them. Theo had the decency to look sorry, and when he continued it was softly “Are you really that self assured to think people haven’t got better to do that preoccupy their minds with what you deserve or not? Yes, I will concede there will be some that won’t be pleased, but your biggest enemy is yourself. Once you get out of whatever self-pity corner you are hiding in and stop making excuses you can actually live instead of exist!” He finished, sagging on the bench with an exaggerated huff.
Not so long ago, sleep deprived and desperate enough to be considering the daunting promise of deathlike slumber bubbling away in his cauldron, Slughorn’s challenge had ringed in his ears with the suave voice of hope.
“Not many would have done what he did. He was a brave wizard” he said, to validate the boy’s actions. The young wizard’s last act. And he was killed spinelessly by a coward, likely a pureblood that felt superior but couldn’t even look a child in the eyes when striking, he wanted to add. He was angry.
Dumbledore closed his eyes, the world fading around him until Draco could only see his lips moving “You need to find him, and when you do you- you need to tell him. Harry Potter is the only one that can defeat Voldemort. Moreover, I came to the conclusion that to do so, and t-this is quite important Severus. . . ” his voice shook, silver lashes glistening with tears “He must be willing to die at his hand”.
“For the people that died”. She said, looking uncomfortable, like she was revealing a secret.
When the basin was full Lupin uncorked the vial and poured its silvery content into the liquid below. Twirls of smoke erupted at the contact between the two, before settling into a watery mist lingering just above the surface.
Lupin was a motherfucker, and a sadistic one at that.
Lupin sat cross-legged on the kitchen floor, his wand pointed right above the bowl, and started chanting something in a hushed, lulling voice. Cloudy liquid slowly filled the basin, setting the precious stones encrusted in its rim alight. Their reflections danced around the room, accentuating the white scar tissue that marred most of the werewolf’s skin. Draco felt an odd pang of regret for calling the man a creature when the pain of a lifetime was so clearly etched all over his human flesh.
“Don’t be ridiculous!” Draco gagged, horrified.
“Nah, he seems innocuous” But the other boy must have sensed his frustration because he hastily added “I know you are talking about what people might think and say about me, but I found out long time ago I never truly cared”.
Then the other boy broke the silence “The first time I heard my mother’s voice, aside for in my dreams, was in Snape’s memories”, he said, still very interested in the floor.
“Dumbledore offered you an escape” The other boy said, looking directly at him. “I was there. You were going to take it”. It didn’t sound like a question.
Draco shuddered. “I have a reservation” he replied, pushing a printed sheet towards the man, careful not to make contact with any surface.
He plopped one of the sweets into his mouth with a thank you, quickly turning back to the window to avoid further interaction.
To his surprise the other wizard relented, addressing him gently “Yeah, Okay- Okay. There is a bath upstairs, actually quite spacious. . . I mean, if you want to.  I’ll go and prepare the guest room.”
He had always craved to be seen but this year needed to be different. With the magnitude of the task he had been assigned, he knew it wouldn’t serve him well to attract attention. Nonetheless, the idea of Potter silently knowing he had been overpowered, melted some of the stress away, allowing a slow smirk to stretch his lips. He might even get to enjoy the Welcoming Feast, after all.
Draco’s gaze fell uncomfortably upon his left arm and the Professor twitched.
Lupin eyed him curiously, weighing the question like Draco was the one being a cryptic bastard. “Shrieking Shack” he replied, persisting in making zero fucking sense. “And Cardiff, but that hardly matters.”
17 years old Draco now recognised what the child he had been did without realising. He had picked his “inferiors”, his “enemies” not between the students that were somewhat less talented than him but among the peers that presented the most challenges to his own superiority. Granger, with her brain and her dedication. Potter, with his fame and his courage. And even Weasley, that was deemed a superior choice by the only person to ever reject him. Him, that was raised to see himself as desirable company in the eyes of everyone and that couldn’t understand why this time he wasn’t.
His gaze found Draco’s, green and confused. Draco gaped back, before realising that Potter had no clue of what was going on in his mind. He laughed, embarrassed, his right hand reaching the base of his head in a mirror gesture of the other boy’s.
Forget me not: memories and hope
“I left something behind,” he shrugged dismissively, and began perusing the selection of food set before him.
But while Lily Evans already seemed to know that the sorting could not taint their relationship, Snape struggled to separate his friendship and the influence of some of his house members. So Draco watched as the boy’s pull towards the Dark Arts eventually set them apart. There was something, in Lily’s strong, unwavering sense of what was right. She cared about him, but she would not excuse him for his actions, for the way he treated others. And when he chose not to see outside of the limiting four walls he had built in his mind, when he decided to follow those people that raised themselves above others, above people like her, he lost her. And then he realised, too late, he had made the biggest mistake of his life.
Draco’s eyes widened. You are? He wanted to ask, but he heard his voice replying “I am not scared” instead, his usual sneer in place.
It was only after they had made their way downstairs and were waiting for the Muggle bus, considerably slower than the Wizard triple decker but looking a lot safer, that Draco wondered stupidly if Potter was going on a date.
“The very same.” Malfoy has a small smile, here, to share. “He’s an invaluable asset, when he’s not abroad.”
“Why don’t you say that to yourself?”
His tone is unreadable, nothing new—but Harry thinks of the last time they saw each other, how tenderly Draco had taken his hand, held it up to his lips. Warmed it with his breath.
But Harry has already taken out his wand, teeth gnawing through a silted spell. A great groaning underneath their bodies, in the bowels of the home. Pansy’s eyes flash back at him, jaw gone slack, eyes clouded. “Potter, don’t you
“I’m all ears.”
“How do you mean?”
Malfoy pulls at Harry’s elbow, urging him into what presumably used to be a kitchen. The counters are covered in thick layers of ash. Malfoy stares at him intently.
Someone follows.
“Jane?”
“Use me.”
The silence past polite greetings is large but not uncomfortable. They settle on plush leather stools, letting the murmur of other conversations sweep them into anonymity. The bartender is a strong-armed man with clipped blonde hair; he smiles at them both, twice too many times to be professional.
⋅ ⋅ ⋅
Drives all the way back, untangling as he goes.
Harry blinks over. To survive a feeling. Nothing solid, or defined. A hunch of a feeling.
Malfoy is watching, absently, as Isaac and Diana put their hands against a wall, and listen. “Might require—”
Harry can’t get his feet under him. This isn’t Malfoy, this is someone else.
Imbalance.
Malfoy writes a few days later, saying there’s another job, if he wants to join. Harry does. He meets the faction on the uneasy border of Diagon Alley and a busy Muggle street, their cluster more skittery than before, perhaps because of such a public wizarding locale.
The idea of survival split between them like a wishbone; right down the center.
There seems little reason not to feel this wanting.
, Potter, shut up—”
Tries, all the while, to swallow. For the leaf to slip down the drain.
“This,” Harry echoes. “What is this?”
Harry exhales. “Fire?”
“Someone
He’s never been good at washing himself clean of feeling, especially this kind; the kind that burrows under his tongue, wrenches open his jaw. “Don’t tell me you’ve fucked Dean Thomas.”
Harry gasps awake. Malfoy is clingy, in sleep. Shaking and pale under a sheen of poor light, diagonal from behind the window shade. “Harry?” he grumbles, voice trapped in sleep—and though it’s the second time he’s said the name, it feels like the first.
They come up the side of Stoatshead and find their breath, look out over the village. In the far distance, a curling plume of smoke from the Burrow.
But when Draco bent up off the bed, looking down, Harry saw it there, plain: the door, hitched ajar. Stoppered by something like distrust—or else fear. Or else pain.
“Though, it is harder than I thought it would be.”
Harry is a fixer. Harry is eyes-closed concentrated, searching for rivers of black. What a desperate force they are. Nose flaring with the stench, mealy and sickening, his brow already banked in sweat—arm reaching, reaching, wand-clenched.
Like pain fixes anything.
Eventually, Draco cuts Harry a glance—and it’s sheepish, almost. Doesn’t fit the sharp cut of cheekbones. “I was guilty, and you set me free.”
At the change in tone, Malfoy’s gaze softens, and he nods.
⋅ ⋅ ⋅
“Doesn’t matter. Not the point I’m making.” Malfoy shoves the sleeve back down and runs a restless hand through his hair—and Harry tries to ignore that, he does. “The point being,” Malfoy says, softer, and this is a different Malfoy altogether, Harry knows, in this moment. “I need you.”
Remus sighed into his tea. He had at one time believed that Albus was the shining example of all things good, but now that he was older and more aware of the world was sure that Albus kept his own agenda. What it was, he had no idea. But he also knew, because of his heightened senses, that Albus had not been completely honest with him. And he didn’t know what to do about it.
Harry, who's home life until very recently had given him extreme sensitivity to currents and moods in his environment, had slunk down into his chair and was trying to make himself as small as possible. He had stopped eating and was watching Lucius and Narcissa very carefully. Narcissa sighed, which was enough to get Lucius's attention, and flicked her eyes towards Harry so he could see what his question and the change in conversation had done. Lucius glanced at Harry, and realized that he had to fix this before Severus got the impression that he was causing his son distress.
Lucius made his way to his private study and locked the door as soon as Severus came in behind him.
“Not at all, Severus, but what in Merlin’s name are you doing wandering the halls disillusioned like that?” Severus’ face grew grave, and he stepped to the side so that Minerva could see the tiny figure floating behind him. “I am afraid that I am taking care of one of the Headmaster’s grave mistakes.” Minerva gasped as she got a look at who was wrapped in the blanket. Even with the messy hair and blanket wrapped around him, the scar on his forehead was clear.
There was indeed outdoor gear in Harry's new clothing, including a hat that covered Harry's scar. With both of them ready to go out into the mid-October wind, they made their way through the castle.
“I… I mean…” Lucius stammered.
“Do you want to talk about it?” The trust that Narcissa, and everyone, had established over the past months had done its job, and curled against her chest Harry began to tell her about what life had been like when he lived with the Dursleys. Not eating enough and always being hungry, being slapped and kicked and beaten for the smallest things. Being forced to work, many times doing things that someone of his size shouldn’t and wouldn’t have been able to do. His cousin stealing the few joys that he had, and being tormented by the bully and his friends. At one point, Lucius came up to the doorway but Narcissa shook her head minutely. She didn’t want Harry to be interrupted. She wanted to purge this poison from his soul. Lucius nodded silently, and walked back the way he came. Harry continued, with Narcissa making small noises so Harry knew that she was listening and rubbing his back. After what felt like hours, Harry wound down.
“I… I don’t want to say something and make them not like me anymore. Like my cousin at my uncle’s, and his friends. They didn’t like me. And they were mean to me. I thought it might have been my fault, and I didn’t want the same thing to happen here.” Narcissa knelt down and gathered Harry into a hug.
“Yes.”
I sort of challenged him to fight me, and so we started wrestling. It was very fun and lighthearted.” He determines to leave out his hair-pulling revelation, and the part about Harry being worried that he'd cause another seizure somehow.
“I had coffee this morning at breakfast. I was tired but I should’ve known better.”
“Okay.”
Malfoy's eyes roll backward, and the rest of the biscuit falls from his hand. He topples backward, landing on the sofa, limp.
Draco blinks in confusion.
Harry rolls his eyes.
“Okay. You can tell me later.”
With a very uncertain feeling, Harry plucks at the elastic on Malfoy’s pants.
“Oh, that’s right, you want news of dear old dad, don’t you? Well, he’ll be Kissed. But even if he wasn’t, I told him where you’d be. But has he come to get you? No. He doesn’t want such a pathetic excuse for an heir. Who would?”
Hermione, despite not really caring about Quidditch, is very much in favour of the plan.
“Yeah, I will.” Harry smiles. “Shannon’s going to have plenty to deal with, between the two of us.”
“Have you been able to eat?”
Harry hugs Neville firmly.
“Did you have a good Christmas?” Harry asks.
you dress up all the time? There’s no one here but me.”
“Accio, rubbish bin.” He whispers, catching it as it flies to him. He holds it in front of Draco in time for him to puke into it.
“Because he was in your territory! If he had, and you’d felt weird about it because your dormmates are present, you could really embarrass him.” Seamus says.
, the lies were all piling up and everyone was mad at me- and- and
A few minutes later, he turns to look at Malfoy, who looks shell-shocked and nervous. He’s looking at the floor.
“An inspiration to us all, didn’t you say?” Harry taunts as they carry their brooms back.
“Alright,
They play for hours, and Draco finally relaxes. They hear a bell from the kitchen signalling dinnertime, and Draco stands.
Virginity is a social construct :D
“Ah, am I missing something?” Harry asked, wracking his brain for what on earth was going on. Draco lifted off the wall smoothly, walking over closer to Harry in three long strides.
“Yeah, I took it off him, sorry. You were out when I got back.” Neville’s voice calls.
“Do you know anyone else who’s asexual?”
“Oh, right, so when you were speaking with Dumbledore in the Astronomy tower the night he was killed-”
“Alright. Yeah. You fancied him, you would never shut up about him.” Zabini leans onto the arm of the chair, smiling faintly. “You would talk about Potter’s stupid hair and his ridiculous scar and Potter’s awful green eyes. All of us dormmates knew, that was you, me, Vince, Greg and Theo.” Zabini laughs. “We used to tease you all the time for it. I’m honestly surprised Potter didn’t know.”
"You're too attractive to just be one of Adam's friends."
Draco swallowed. He did steal sometimes, occasionally a paper to read what was happening outside, he once swiped a book, then acted as if he'd just picked it off the floor and gave it back to start a conversation.
“It sounds like a date.”
“It’s just, the school has been so downtrodden. It’s not a healthy environment for learning. We could use a bit of spirit right about now.”
Draco moves his hand from where his fingers were resting tentatively. He’ll have to work to remember all these instructions, but Draco is a quick study and he’ll catch on fast. He has to.
“I’m not supposed to. There’s a difference.” Malfoy mutters, ripping his shirt off and stalking off in the direction of the house. His shirt flutters to the ground.
“You alright?” Harry asks gently.
“Marion?” Harry calls out. Marion steps back inside the room. Draco doesn’t say anything, so Harry asks her instead. “What were you thinking about Draco’s body when you were looking a minute ago?” Harry asks. She frowns.
He removes the hair jinx from Harry and returns his attention to his back.
“Yes.”
“No.” Draco says too quickly. “No, I- I mean, it’s only been a few months.”
One squeeze, and Malfoy’s head falls back just like before.
“You doing alright, pet?” Harry asks, stroking his hair. Draco whines, looking up at Harry with those lovely grey eyes.
“No wonder you were a twat, growing up here.” Harry mutters as Draco raps on the door.
“What? What do you mean?”
“Sorry, you want me to marry
“Yeah, I know. It’s hard to keep it tidy, especially long.”
“Where is he, anyway?”
?” Potter finally asks, his eyebrows shooting up.
“I’d let you suck on my fingers anytime.” Harry murmurs.
Draco gives Harry a funny look, but nods.
“Of course, everything is allowed.”
“Draco? Were you reading this?” Harry asks with a laugh. He picks it up. The bookmark is in the same place as before.
“I- sorry, nevermind-” Harry stammers, feeling his entire body flush with embarrassment. “I dunno why I asked-”
"They just got very warm."
“Can Marion ask a few more questions? You’re doing very well.”
“Is that… something you’d normally… er, get taken care of? At home, I mean?”
“You’re going to snog someone? To see if they’re gay?”
to be the embarrassed one between the two of us.” He says, nodding to Ron and Neville before pulling Harry out the door.
Draco says goodbye to Astoria and returns his neck and head to Romania to wait for Greg.
Draco complains some more, but it’s quite nice to have Greg here in Romania even just for a bit, so he goes to bed willingly.
“I keep seeing his face.”
“Mhm.” Malfoy says, methodically taking off his shoes and socks, then his trousers and shirt. “I moved to a different wing after I started school at Hogwarts because I thought it would make me feel more grown up, but I moved back here after the war. That wing stank of dog.”
“Ashe?” Draco asks, turning to see her flipping the coin.
Malfoy shakes his head.
“Good. Can you tell me all your new rules as you understand them?”
“Hey, I’m here so we can answer some of Marion’s questions together. Joint effort.” Harry says, hopping up to sit beside Draco on the table.
“You’re besotted.”
She leaves him to get washed up, and he takes his time letting the irritation and stress of the last several days run down the shower drain.
“No, she gave up SPEW. Kingsley made her rebrand. Winky, though, she’s come a long way.”
"Then again, she could have been Imperius'd." Harry suggests.
Harry is shaking in horror and rage when he drops the spell.
Draco helps Neville
“Oh fuck you.” Harry snorts, rising to his feet again and snatching up his bag. “And no snooping.”
Blaise nods at him with a warm smile, and the potatoes-bearer sets the dish down with a bit of a clunk before running back into the kitchen.
By the time Harry does get up, he’s feeling refreshed and surprisingly well rested despite getting his usual four and a half hours of sleep.
. I honestly don’t know that you’ve ever really been
“What about the blue one?”
Draco joins in the handful of people groaning.
Harry frowns.
Harry has to set an egg down so he has a chance to consider Malfoy firing off hexes at Death Eaters wearing eyeliner and platform boots.
“Here we are.”
Draco smiles, finally looking at Harry’s face.
“Are those from this morning?” Draco asks, to be sure.
to feel weird about this. Even if Draco’s soft skin and the steamy room has him feeling some sort of way. He’ll never act on it, of course. But it’s distracting and a bit confusing.
“Snog later, we’ve got things to do! No one can figure out how you got the curtains up and we need your help getting them down again.” Pansy Parkinson says, shoving Malfoy back out from beneath the stage. “Nice work, Haz.” She says to Harry with a nod.
“They’re not exactly nobodies in England, and I lived there until recently.” He says vaguely.
Harry can only watch as they walk him off the property, then Apparate from outside the gates. Once they’re gone, he closes the door and turns to see the elves standing in the hallway. Most of them are crying.
“After…
“I love Quidditch.” Malfoy says as they head toward the pitch. “Why wouldn’t I want to?”
Harry shifts so he’s laying against the arm of the sofa with Malfoy on top.
“I haven’t decided yet.” Malfoy shrugs.
He doesn’t seem to care that Harry’s in the room, and Harry supposes it doesn’t much matter given that he’s seen Malfoy naked every night for several days now.
thinks I’ve been selling my body in boredom.”
See my drawing of
“Oh I know, I could see it all over your face.” Harry says, smiling widely. Malfoy huffs.
“I think I need to quit my job.” He stopped in his tracks, facing his friends.
Draco hasn’t moved since she started, even his shaking has stopped. But that worries Harry more than anything.
“Want me to tell you?”
“Do you have condoms?”
“Thanks, Angel, very kind of you.” Draco says, punching his thigh lightly.
“I’m so glad you’ve told me that, you made me very happy.” He says, taking Draco’s hand and squeezing.
“He’s my pet, Remus.” Harry says simply.
“I won’t be requiring Polyjuice, I’ll arrange for my own disguise.” Malfoy says confidently.
“God, I hope not.” Draco says lowly. “Can we talk about something else?”
"No. Look." Harry insists.
"Merlin, Harry, are these
Harry looks up, catching Mrs. Weasley looking abruptly away from him and busying herself with already perfectly folded fabric serviettes.
A faint nagging sensation at the back of his mind distracted him briefly. This feels off.
“I most certainly am
Then, Harry would press back in, deeper this time but still only one finger, waiting for the whine he’d heard when paler, daintier fingers had been buried inside that same hole weeks ago. Harry wanted to be the cause of that whine, to hear it again outside his thoughts and to watch those silver eyes go glassy with lust.
“Then it’s okay how it is, unless you want to move it. I’m alright, you don’t need to worry about me.”
“Would you like to spend the night?”
They leave the bathroom together and head up toward Gryffindor without speaking again.
“He’s doing very well on his own.” Harry says as conversation before they reach the next shop.
Harry spent his empty days with Ron and Hermione, sometimes joined by Ginny, Neville, Luna or their other Gryffindor classmates.
Mr. Weasley leans forward in shock.
“You volunteered.” Malfoy points out.
“Fuck.” He swallows heavily. “That’s… that’s hot. I- You can’t wear that to the- to the thing, it’s too- it’s too hot.” Harry croaks.
Harry thinks for a moment.
“You have clothes for me?” He prompts, and Harry pulls things from his magically expanded pockets.
. I want to be good for you, to be better. You make me want to be good.”
“Fenrir!” Draco cries, then claps a hand over his mouth. “Oh no, you
Draco giggles a bit despite himself.
“What happened? Start from yesterday, when he started feeling weird.”
“But you could have fancied me and hated me at the same time, right? Maybe you thought I was fit but you still didn’t like me.” Harry suggests. He doesn’t know why he’s talking Draco into the idea.
Harry laughs.
Prat.
Scarrow bursts out laughing.
worried for you.” Malfoy drawls, twisting to look down at Harry. He spots the bag right away. “What’d you get?”
“You’re extra affectionate this evening.” She says softly.
“You were… I- talked about me. Before.”
“Sounds like a nightmare. I was considered a Potions Master after opening my shop and I didn’t kill anyone for a year.”
Draco makes a pleased noise, taking longer steps than Harry’s shorter legs can reasonably handle.
“My favourite thing about Draco and Harry is their love.” Luna says without preamble. Draco grins at Harry, holding out his hands. Harry takes them.
“If I am not okay, you get... upset.” Draco pauses. “Not upset, but
“Not… not
“I have done nothing of the sort, I’m only expressing my disdain for my stupid flatmate who can’t figure out how to write a
“Okay.”
“Anything?” Harry prompts the Twins, who sigh heavily.
“Really?” Potter asks. “I would’ve thought something sweet for you.”
“Of course, it does get tricky sometimes to take care of magical plants without having any magic myself, but Neville’s been kind enough to help me out anytime I have trouble.”
“Absolutely.” Harry says, slipping his free hand into his pocket and pulling out three new glittering gel pens. “I brought these for you.”
“That certainly brings back some memories.” Neville jokes, and Ron and Harry laugh. Draco rolls his eyes.
Harry must admit he’s rather excited to see how Malfoy intends to disguise himself and what he’ll look like. He thinks privately that he should be able to spot him quickly despite appearances as he’s very attuned to the way Malfoy carries himself and gesticulates. He’s eager to test the theory.
“‘S so good. Jack makes ’m s-strong.”
Draco smiles, allowing Ron to take his hand and give it a squeeze. Harry smiles too.
“If I
“Goodbye, Ron.”
“Dear god, no. I asked George what I should see, and gave that list to my Father. I imagine George would’ve picked the most inappropriate or otherwise horrifying options.”
“First game we’re playing is called Paranoia. As usual, your being here opts you into the game, no exceptions. If you would all take a spot in the sitting room, we’ll begin.”
Draco shuts his eyes, shaking his head. Potter keeps talking.
with her, weren’t they? She wasn’t over Cedric, and I had a lot going on… But I mean, this summer, I started… missing Ginny especially.”
He sits in the velvety chair and looks around at the many mirrors hanging on the walls. He assumes that behind at least one, a camera or a person watches the happenings of the room. It makes his skin crawl.
“Yes. Okay.” Draco nods.
“Blaise mentioned he wanted to talk to you about something, didn’t say what.”
Draco sighs, giving Harry a pained look.
“Would you like to talk about it?”
“Do you save these from your garden for baths?” Harry asks, sprinkling the petals into the water.
“Should’ve gone with the silver one.” Harry shrugs, and grins when she gives him a look.
“No need, mate. I don’t really want to know.”
Harry sighs.
Hermione sighs.
He sinks down onto Harry slowly, and Harry puts his hands back onto Draco’s arse.
Harry doesn't have to. He
The girl looks even more surprised.
“I understand.” Harry says gently. “Don’t pretend with me. You know I have bad days too. If you're not okay, we'll be not okay together. Yeah?”
"I- Dobby? Visited- The Burr-
“Uh, thanks, erm.
There’s another silence before Pansy’s feet shuffle toward the door.
“Who is Pierson?” Draco asks weakly.
“Your hand smells like latex.” Harry complains, grabbing it and holding it against his chest instead.
“Mate, that’s incredible!” Ron says excitedly. “Can I have a go?”
“Holy shit!” Rebecca’s eyes open up and she drops her wand.
“You’re right. Okay, I’ll be right back, we can get this blasted thing done. I’ll write so you don’t have to disturb Draco.”
Hesitantly, Draco’s hands run along Harry’s sides and settle just above his arse.
“And is that my new assignment? Buying myself a notebook?”
“Harry!” Hermione snaps.
Draco’s eyes move up the Burrow, around the garden. He lets out a shaking breath.
Draco nods, smiling.
“You shook off the curse.” Ron says. Hermione nods.
“They’ve actually got pretty rotten tolerance.” Malfoy grins, resting his chin on his arms. “Anyway, they’re very funny hungover, they keep trying to make the other one pilot their body so they won’t have to. George usually wins.”
Harry’s mind blanks out as he listens.
Both he and Draco, as well as a handful of others, move to the left, Draco taking a seat on Hold’s lap, whose hands flutter awkwardly for a moment before they land on her chair's edges.
Draco doesn’t wake up until Harry puts him on their bed, and Harry rolls his eyes.
“Last week.” Malfoy says around a yawn. “I'm surprised you haven't noticed them, considering how much you look at me.”
“I don’t know, Neville. I’m not kicking him out, though, I’m sure he’s got a reason for it.”
“It doesn’t work as well without tits.” Malfoy says.
Resolution
“You’d better. Technically you report to me now.” Neville says.
Upon entering the common room, Harry squeezed his hand tighter, and Draco saw Parvati in the group chatting animatedly. He pulled Harry over with him.
you can finger yourself anytime. Marion is a healer, so she understands what’s good or not good for your body better than I do.”
“Thanks, Ron.”
“I was just imagining telling Sirius about us.” Harry admits.
“I think I would know!”
“You and I are not the same, Potter.” Draco says finally.
“Fortunately, they’re not the bad ones, I’ll give you potions to clear your system. You got lucky on that front.”
“No.” Potter says amiably. “No, pretty good day. And you?”
“And you don’t want to be punished, even if it doesn’t hurt. The rules help you know how to not get punished.”
“Alright.” Harry sits on the rug by the tub, leaning against the wall. “Do you like the smell?”
“I’ve seen your videos, the flatmate stuff.” She grins. “You went viral recently with his livestream.”
“Third time.” Harry says. “Are you alright?” He asks Draco.
“What?”
“You wrote this down?” Ron asks.
, it works a little
“What do you like about it?”
“Yeah, is that not okay?”
“Merlin, you’re right.” Harry pauses. “Think he could handle a shopping trip?”
“What?”
“Oh yes. I told them the first full day, and I could hear Blaise’s laughter through the letter.”
“That’s alright, I’m sure yours are lovely. Who else do you usually write to?”
“Talk about me much?” Harry asks, biting his lip.
“Are you going to take a bath too?” Draco asks, shifting the frothy bubbles around.
He drinks between bites and looks extremely miserable.
It’s right when Harry and Malfoy are leaving the dining room, about to enter a passage, when they hear the rain outside.
“Yeah, we did. We split on good terms.” Harry shrugs. “She’s an excellent dancer.”
. But holding onto the notion that Malfoy’s this cat just because he shares colouring and you’re convinced he’s got the same personality isn’t really healthy. You’ve got to let it go, Harry.” Neville says seriously.
The words ring in Draco’s ears as he finds his way back behind the curtains. He’s more than a little tipsy, and had only turned this direction when Jack had urged him to call it a night.
“It’s
“I know. But I don’t know anyone here, it’s lonely to go out alone all the time.” Harry says.
Draco gently takes the book from Harry’s hands and scans over the page.
“If you leave me here with a full hard-on just to go wank in the loo, you can kiss my arse goodbye forever.”
Harry rolls his eyes.
But as he removes each piece, setting it aside with longing glances and tender touches to similar items in his wardrobe, Harry recognises it for the costume that it is. The neat tweed trousers, unlike the ambiguous black ones Malfoy usually wears now.
Harry rubs his thumb over Draco’s knuckles.
“Okay.” Malfoy says.
It ends up as a jumbled
“I know he needs me. He needs to figure things out for himself, I’m no good for him.” Malfoy snaps. “He should make new friends and stay far away from me.”
“Yes.”
After all, the Prince’s pet deserves to be pampered, does he not?
say things like that and he won’t get in trouble.
Crane, shockingly, is a brilliant conversationalist when he’s comfortable with his surroundings. Why he’s more comfortable in freezing water, naked, with three of his coworkers than at a party has yet to be determined.
“How will I know it’s you?”
“Are you fine?”
All just one happy group of two dozen of their most favourites who all happened to be in the area at once - even Charlie, Bill and Fleur.
Night lights
Hermione sighs, and Ron pats her arm.
“All day!”
“Of course, Harry.” Draco says without pause.
“It’s gotten better, I think.” Harry says hopefully, though privately he thinks Draco’s ability to remember things as they happen hasn’t really improved at all.
“Okay.” Draco says. He wraps his arm around Harry’s and they Apparate home.
Crane, shockingly, was one of the first to visit.
Harry twisted again, but the greater bulk was too much, and his movement caused Greyback to lash out, knocking the stolen wand from Harry’s hand.
“Ah, Harry. Thought I’d see you today.” Gawain says blandly. He rubs his hands over his face. “I take it you’ve heard of your new partnership?”
“Yes.”
The man spills inside Draco, and when he pulls away, he presses his fingers to Draco’s gaping hole.
Draco smiles, tucking a strand of hair behind Harry’s ear.
“And just for that-”
Harry nearly jumps out of his skin when he hears Malfoy’s very real voice breaking through his lust-clouded mind.
“Very well then, I will stop telling you how cute you are for now.”
“I thought you didn’t know I was working at the reserve until later that conversation.”
Have you guys seen those videos on Tiktok about the flats with the kitchen drawer that won't open unless you open the oven door and turn on the stove? Because now I live in one of them, it's like a jigsaw puzzle and it sucks.
Draco didn’t like him at first, but his lessons have gotten better.
“Are the pants I’ve given you comfortable?”
"At any rate, I don't remember much inside the club when I was there."
“Is that why you thought I was disappointed in you when I said I wasn’t going to fuck you tonight?” Harry asks from behind his palms.
“Hm, are you going to let him say that to you, Dream Boat?” Malfoy asks Harry, biting his lip with his eyes looking back and forth between Harry and Theodosii.
“Yes. You served me a margarita.” Draco says, growing impatient.
“Mims?” Harry asks, summoning the elf.
He’s recognised right away, and the mediwitch directs him to the room with his patient.
“Did you seriously pack your dildo before your socks?” Harry laughs.
Draco’s eyes open suddenly, and he sits up with a jolt, scrambling away to the furthest corner of the bed.
“I can't sleep.”
“No. It took time.” Ron admits. “But I am now, and I work hard to keep things that way. To keep Hermione no matter what, for Rose to grow up with the childhood we all deserved but didn’t get. I know we’re poor, and we probably always will be. But… it doesn’t bother me like it used to. We’ve got each other, and that’s more than enough.”
after like three weeks out of the place, but he’s at least getting better.”
“How are you holding up?” Harry asks.
After they pay him, Draco pulls Harry from the car.
“I will.” Harry says, giving Draco a squeeze. “Now get to it so you can be done soon.”
Pierson appeared on scene, loitering by a little used backstage door which opened to an alley.
“Apologise!” Harry demanded.
“Listen, Smith. If you continue to disrespect and intimidate our
Harry confirms with him once more before they Apparate to see Marion.
“Oh Merlin’s pants.” Malfoy grumbles as his phone chimes three times in a matter of seconds. “I knew somehow you’d be the reason I have to turn my notifications off.”
Harry laughs darkly.
Mims appeared by Harry’s side, tugging on his sleeve.
On a whim, Harry spends the rest of his time waiting by perusing a muggle catalogue he’d received on accident. He’s thrilled Draco has found something to enjoy, sure it will help his recovery. He finds the page with bathroom things.
"Will do. I want a pensieved memory of Harry's face."
“I’m not scooping up your brains to bring to Pomfrey.”
, if Malfoy were to brush against Harry in a corridor, his round little bum not hidden by their dreadful uniform trousers… absolutely
“Hermione, it’s fine, we’ll finish up here and get to bed then. It’s no use lying there if we can’t sleep anyway.”
“Of course. 7pm, we’ll set up the fourth room in the green hallway.” The waiter says, and the arrangement is quickly made.
“I have no idea. He’s been… heavily abused though, has a lot of injuries. He’s malnourished, barely been able to keep anything down. I’m bringing him to my private healer tomorrow.”
Draco nods vaguely, shifting closer to Harry.
“But he still trusts you. So you’re doing alright.” Ron reminds Harry, and Harry sighs.
“Ron, that you?” He asks. His friend turns.
“Draco-”
you want to do this? We could still back out.” Draco offers, not for the first time.
“Someone told him about the higher education system muggles use. Usually, unless you have six years worth of higher education, you’re called Mr. or Mrs. instead of Professor.”
“And are you still like that?”
With a sigh, Draco curls up closer to Potter, letting his memory hang in the air.
Harry showered again, if for no other reason than to get some time without worrying what Malfoy might’ve been thinking.
“Alright?” Malfoy says, taking a drink of water.
The memory fades away, and everything shifts around for the next memory, which, unlike the two previous, starts without preamble.
“Eduard.” Malfoy says rather blankly. “You gave him to me, remember? Hang on, I’ll see if he’ll let me Summon him.”
Harry cringes when he sees the moving picture of himself dancing with Meredith’s head on his shoulder. He can’t help but note how… content both of their faces look. Meredith has her eyes closed and is smiling faintly.
“That’s what I was saying-” Harry says a bit pleadingly, hoping Draco isn’t too upset with him.
“You have imagined it, then.”
“But we have to go to my house.”
“Er, sort of. You weren’t bad, I don’t think. The team didn’t play as well when you stopped being the Seeker, so I think you must’ve won other games. But you got very distracted playing against me.”
“What’s been tried so far?” Draco asks, eyeing the tourniquet cutting off the right arm’s circulation. “He’ll lose the hand if that’s not removed very soon.”
Also, Mind Healing time is coming soon!
Harry teared up as he read this part.
“Have you considered making your own broom?”
Harry whispers through his teeth. He hopes his lips don’t move noticeably. Malfoy starts slightly, leaning back to look into Harry’s face. His hips grind down, and Harry closes his eyes with a quiet moan.
"I will." Draco lies.
“What do you mean?”
Their table erupted in whoops and shouts as a grinning Dean and Dean’s brother, whose name Harry still hadn’t learned, approached.
“I was
“Potter, you’re wasting my time, I’ve only got-” Malfoy casts a wandless Tempus, and inhales sharply, voice going from pleading to frantic. “I’ve only got a few minutes left. Please.”
“No.”
An awkward shimmy later, and Harry’s fully under the hot water.
Potter grins, shaking his head in Draco’s direction as Draco lifts his bottle at him.
“That was
“No, I haven’t. But I know what to do.”
“A good host never kicks out a guest.” Malfoy scoffs, standing up and nodding toward the door. “Now shoo.”
Goyle laughs, the sound still foreign - but not unpleasant - to Harry.
“I’m sorry.”
“Alright fine, but you’ve got to get to sleep soon or you’ll be useless tomorrow. We need you well rested, especially you, Harry.” Neville says, setting Malfoy back down on the sink.
He’s very capable of not talking about his sex life, though he still finds it strange that the tamers are so hung up on it.
“One must be in order to make a profit.” Malfoy sniffs, and Harry laughs.
Draco opens up the duvet, and Harry sits beside him, tucking it back around the both of them.
“Since neither of you are crying or bleeding, I assume you’re here to talk about your semipermanent jewelry.” She says, ushering them both into the exam room.
“I’ve got someone I need to call.” He tells her.
“I used to be very mean. They don’t know me now. They don’t know I won’t attack.”
think they are??
“Yes. You’re different. Now, you take care of me. No pain.”
“You wear these often?” Harry asks.
Letters
Big Strong Harry Potter
“So why aren’t you asleep?”
“He went with the girls to the Greengrass’s for lunch. He’ll be back, lovely.” She says gently.
“Looks nice.”
“That sounds like me.”
“No, we do!” Harry assures him. “I’m trying to think of one you might not remember. And a lot of nice things we’ve done have ended up not-so-nice because I triggered you by accident. I’m not good at Occlumency, so I don’t think I could stop the memory before that part.”
“That’s true.” Harry agrees. “Have you talked to Shannon about it?”
Harry snorts, watching Malfoy pull his big platform boots from the corner of the room.
“Tap out.” Harry repeats, frowning. “You don’t know- whatever. Tapping out is… giving in. Like, if you don’t want to do what I say, you can tap out and I won’t make you.”
“You take good care of Draco or you’ll need something a bit stronger than Expelliarmus to stop me.” He warns, quiet enough that Draco doesn’t hear him. Harry nods.
“Draco, squeeze my hand if you can hear me.” Harry instructs. Nothing. He sighs, rubbing a hand over his face.
“I needed time.”
“A healer?”
Outside the shop window, the florist across the street is putting out his window displays. Harry’s eyes land on a particularly pretty lilac arrangement.
“I may be a sore loser, but you’re a sore winner, which is worse.” Malfoy grumbles, trying to step on the backs of Harry’s trainers as they walk.
“Look at that! Amazing!” Harry says in a loud event announcer voice, making Draco laugh. “Incredible spin factor, showstopping ostrich presentation, what a look on Draco Malfoy tonight. Memorable as always.”
“Roll over, I think it’ll be easier. I haven’t done this with another person before.” He says, and Draco complies. Harry sets the pillow under Draco’s hips to lift his arse slightly off the bed, which makes him feel
"Charlie?" Draco asks. Charlie is so mild mannered, even tempered and thoughtful that Draco can't imagine him being responsible for a death.
“I have An Initiative.” Draco says importantly. Harry looks up from the carrots he’s slicing.
“You didn’t like me. Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” He says quietly. “But… but Blaise did. And Jack did, and… they-”
“Once again, I hardly see the purpose of having him here.”
Draco smiles.
“I’m sorry to hear that.” Marion said quietly.
“Alright.” Draco says, shrugging. “I’m fully capable of keeping it in my pants. I’ve wanted to shag Greg since we were thirteen and still haven’t.”
“I’m already blond again, I have to do
“You still trust me?”
“Okay.”
Harry has to laugh at that, though it makes his step falter and he nearly topples over.
But Lucius
“Yeah, a bit. And sure, I think you make an incredibly attractive woman, but I’m not more interested in
“I’m really proud of you, right now.”
Harry’s mind spins.
“Seriously?” Draco says. “I- I thought you might eventually but, are you sure?”
“Doing what? Bubbling?”
“Now I know my sex life is endlessly interesting, but if no one else has pressing questions, I think it’s time we move on.”
Draco looks up at the sky again.
Feeling slightly relieved, Harry leans back on his elbows to make fun of the way Malfoy’s folding his pants.
“He got Pierson to lure them in.” Harry explains.
Harry and Draco Apparated to the garden gate of the Burrow for dinner.
Harry gasps a laugh, his breath taken when Draco looks over his shoulder and the pink in his cheeks makes his grey eyes seem warmer.
“Why the hell do you think that?”
“Shockingly, we’re here for him and not me. He’ll need a full diagnostic if you don’t mind.” Harry says.
Drake grimaces and shoots an unsubtle look at Knox, who rolls her eyes.
She steps out of the room briefly and comes back with two vials.
“Is he alive.” Harry says blankly.
“Are you busy tomorrow?”
This is going to be awful.
“He changed it so that when I touch it, I stop remembering.”
Harry realises suddenly that Malfoy doesn't seem at all surprised to hear that he talks about Harry in the first place, though.
“What now?” Greg asks, peering over Draco’s shoulder. “Thought you were spending tonight with us.”
“No.”
Ron stands, agreeing easily. He nods at Draco, then floos out.
“And did it?”
In a second, Malfoy was up and out of his chair, red faced and talking a mile a minute.
Mordred hated how compassionate Arthur was, seeing it as weakness. Mordred brought his soldiers to fight against King Arthur. Now, Arthur had been granted a magical sword from the Lady in the Lake called Excalibur along with a scabbard that would protect him from all harm. The Lady was believed to the  Queen of the Fae races. But Arthur, in his depression, forgot the scabbard when he left to fight Mordred one on one. This was his downfall, as in the fight Arthur was gravely injured while slaying the traitor Mordred.
“For your information, he's adopted.” Rowle stared at Snape for a few more moments, and then turned and walked away into the crowd. Severus watched him go.
“Is... is there anything that you would like me to clean or any chores you want me to do while you are out today, Father. Or any work that needs doing?” Severus smiled sadly. This was going to take longer than he thought, and he made another mental note.
“Thank you love.” She whispered against his skin. She knew that he had given her space to work through her temper at it's worst, and kept everyone else distracted. She also knew that he had seen the cold glint in her eyes. She and Lucius may have turned over a new cheek when it came to the struggle between Harry and the Dark Lord, but nothing was going to stop Narcissa from enacting retribution on the Muggles that dared put a finger on her family.
The morning after Severus visited Malfoy Manor was exciting and frustrating for the Malfoy family. Lucius and Narcissa had told Draco during breakfast that his godfather had adopted a son, and that from then on the young man would be considered family. Draco's immediate reaction was to throw both an impressive temper tantrum and all his breakfast dishes that he would not be the center of attention for his godfather any longer. Draco had been banished to his room, and Lucius had retreated to his study. Narcissa went to her lounge to start putting together a lesson plan to teach Harry about the Wizarding World, and for Severus to learn about raising a young man.
Severus continued to go through the members of his family for a little longer, then turned to a different page.
“Severus, we are ready. Please come through. “ Severus stepped out into the receiving room and was immediately handed a tumbler of Firewhiskey. Severus sighed and sat down, taking a sip and looking at Lucius expectantly.
“I am feeling fine, ma’am.” Harry said as quietly and politely as he could. “Please, where am I?” Madam Pomfrey smiled.
“Minerva… and Severus? This is a surprise. What can I do for you this evening?” Both Severus and Minerva had grim looks on their faces, and Pomfrey was surprised when a tiny child appeared between the two of them, hovering over to the bed closest to her office. Madam Pomfrey looked between the two of them, and then at the child in shock. Why had they brought such a tiny child to her? The child was much too small to be a student. Then she saw the boy’s face, and the scar, and she knew.
“Severus.” He paused for a moment and looked back. Lupin's head was hanging a little, and his voice sounded hoarse, like he was holding back tears.
Albus chuckled to himself as he used legillimancy to gently probe Severus's state of mind. He didn't want Severus to get involved with Harry, and it would be much easier if his opinions regarding Harry were based in the idea that Harry was spoiled by his relatives. It was so much easier to control people when they wore their emotions so close to the surface, and since Petunia and Vernon Dursley spoiled their own child it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine that they did the same for Harry. “Be that as it may, Severus, I would like you to check on Harry to make sure that he is well.” Albus’ voice had a note of finality to it, and Severus knew from past experience that he wouldn’t be able to say anything else to change his mind.
“You stop that, or I will slit your throat here and now, I swear to the Dark Lord.” Harry stopped, but the vipers kept moving towards him.
Vincent and Greg weren't really interested in talking at all. They stood next to each other on one side of the corner and watched Theo, Draco, Blaise, and Harry talk and didn't add anything to the conversation. Pansy sat on a chair by herself and didn't talk either once she had realized that Harry had all of Draco's attention.
A small boy road past on a small broom, and a younger girl ran giggling after him. The broom only hovered about 2 feet off the ground, but it raced through the store at what appeared to Harry to be high speed. Harry saw children playing with wands that shot colorful sparks through the air, and from somewhere within the store came giant bubbles with pictures inside them. One came close to Harry, and he could see a butterfly flutter it's brightly colored wings.
“Master Draco lost his temper again. So many things broken...” Draco looked sheepish.
(See the end of the chapter for
A house elf in a rose colored tea towel appeared next to her. “Please gather all of the clothing that Draco has outgrown in the past 6 months and bring them to Tippy for young Harry, please.” The house elf bowed and disappeared. Severus was touched at how quickly Narcissa had accepted Harry as his son. Lucius had yet to say anything, but he knew that he would stand by Narcissa without question. Finally, Lucius spoke his mind.
“I did. I was… dismayed to hear what she had to say. I have a question in return: Why did Albus lie to me regarding Harry?” Severus sat down, his expression not changing.
“Dad! No, he’s bad! He follows the bad man!” Harry cried. He couldn't let the bad man hurt his family.
“Moving slow won’t spare you having to go outside, you little shite!” Vernon cuffed Harry on the side of his head again, and then grabbed him by the hair. “I’m sick of your stink. Petunia will have to deal with your mess.” Despite the pain in his side and his head, Harry kept a tight hold on his blanket. Since he was going to have to sleep outside, he didn’t want to drop it and not have any covering. Even if the blanket smelled like urine, it was better than nothing. Pulling Harry by his hair, Vernon dragged the limp boy to the back door, opened it, and tossed Harry into the back yard. “We will see how we are feeling tomorrow, if we let you come back in.” He shut the door and threw the lock. Heaven forbid the nasty little thing try to creep back in while they were sleeping. Petunia, sensitive to the cleanliness of her house, had already dealt with the mess in the hallway; one might never have known anything happened.
When Harry first came through the Floo, he thought that he was in a museum. Everything was bright and shiny and looked very expensive.  Harry was worried about touching anything. Severus stepped out of the Floo right behind him and put his hand on his shoulder.
“I promise.”
Severus sneered, and thought that he wasn't sure if he was sneering at having to deal with Petunia for the first time since they were children or having to take up his time running errands for Albus in the Muggle world. “And what, Albus, should I be worried about with Mr. Potter? Are we sure that his distress is something that needs to be checked on? I am sure that he’s merely throwing a tantrum because his family won’t buy him his favorite toy or another treat?”
Harry had never had another child pay so much attention to him. He agreed with his father that Draco would probably be a great friend.
The Yule Gala at Malfoy Manor.
“I went to bed around 11 after I finished scoring the midterms. I woke up at quarter to 2, so sometime in the 2 hours and 45 minutes that I was sleeping Harry vanished. And Shadow is missing as well, but I don’t know if that’s a good thing or just happenstance, since the cat seems to be able to get where ever he damn well pleases.” Severus was almost yelling at this point, scared for Harry. He was getting ready to start laying out search plans when the door to the chamber quietly opened.
Draco and Harry were having the time of their lives. Draco introduced Harry to Theo, Blaise, Greg, Vincent, and Pansy. Theo seemed very smart, and he liked to talk about the books that he read at home. Harry was fascinated, and wanted to know all about the many books so that he could tell his father and get some of the books that he didn't have.
“Harry, didn't you understand when I was talking about the house elves? They clean the rooms and the dishes and do the laundry. You aren't going to have to clean. I was you to learn how to play, and to draw, and figure out how to be a little boy.” Harry stopped eating and started chewing on his lower lip again.
What worried him was Harry, and how he would react to what happened. Given the kind of unbelievable power that was flowing through him, it was possible that he wouldn’t remember anything about Rowle’s death. But it was also possible that he remembered everything, and he didn’t know how someone as young as Harry would deal with having caused someone’s death. Remus worried over it for a while as he finished his tea and then crawled into bed. He didn’t know how he was going to convince Severus to let him spend more time around Harry. Maybe he should reach out to Hogwarts and see if there was a teaching position available.
Shadow led Harry through the hallways, going to parts of the castle that Harry had never seen before. Before long, Harry was standing in from of a gargoyle statue. Harry stood there for a moment and studied it as Shadow sat next to his feet. After a moment, Harry felt a wave of tingles over his skin that he recognized as magic sweeping him from head to toe. Then the gargoyle tilted it’s head down to look at him.
Blaise had traveled over the world with his mother and her assorted husbands. According to Blaise, she got married all the time. None of her husbands were interested in getting to know Blaise, so Blaise wasn't interested in getting to know them. He was more interested in people's secrets. Blaise always wanted to be in the center of knowledge, and he had a nose for secrets. He started to ask Harry questions, but Draco distracted him every time he started to ask something by asking about one of Blaise's stepfathers.
He heard the lock slide on the outside of the door, and the door opened to his uncle’s red face and angry expression.
“I’ll leave immediately.” He knew that it would postpone his dinner, but it also meant that he wouldn’t have to spend it surrounded by the inane chatter of staff and students, and could order food in his quarters and eat in privacy. As he Flooed back to his own quarters, he let the nasty thoughts about James Potter and Sirius Black fade from his mind, and let the happy memories of his friendship with Lily come back to the forefront of his mind. There wasn't anything that he wouldn't do for the only child of his lost friend.
“Harry, I have a couple of questions before I am okay answering your new friend’s questions.” Severus sighed, then leaned up and put his elbows on his knees so his face was closer to Harry and the tiny serpent that was now curled around Harry’s forearm.
Albus Dumbledore looked around his office at Hogwarts with smug satisfaction. It had been 5 years since the end of the second Wizarding war, and everything was going to plan. Voldemort had been defeated, just like Grindlewald had been, and Albus now had the reputation of being the Leader of the Light for two Wizarding wars. Yes, there had been losses, but the ends had justified the means. And in case of resurgence in Death Eaters or the rise of another Dark Lord, Albus had tucked away the orphaned Harry Potter as his ace in the hole. Albus smiled to himself and leaned back in his chair, looking across the room at Fawkes dozing on his perch.
“Oh Merlin, Severus. That’s an Occamy that has made friends with your son.”
Remus had just settled into his new quarters, not that it took much. It never took much. He didn’t expect to stay long in any one place, so he had never acquired much in the way of things to take with him. His toiletries bag went into the bathroom, and his clothes into the wardrobe. He had one picture frame on the desk, with a picture of better times. Sometimes he left the picture in his suitcase, if it was too hard to look at, but given where he was he was feeling particularly nostalgic. As he sat down to a cup of tea, he looked at the picture of the Marauders standing with Lily at the Potter wedding.
“He’s a Parselmouth!” Remus exclaimed. Harry looked up and saw Severus and Remus, and went pale. He hissed something, and Remus got the impression that he was talking to them and didn't realize that he was still hissing.
“Yes. Lucius altered the wards so he can’t leave, but we need to find him before he hurts Harry.” Remus nodded, and began to move down the stairs, tracking the scent of his pack mate, his cub. He knew Severus wouldn't appreciate that he thought of Harry like that, but he was there when Harry was born and his wolf wouldn't think of him any other way.
“You are telling me that you are striking out against the Dark Lord AND Albus Dumbledore at the same time while raising the Boy-Who-Lived as your son? That's... positively Slytherin.” All three of the adults laughed at the house joke, then Severus finished his drink and stood.
“Harry, are you enjoying your lessons so far?” Lucius made sure that his tone was warm and light, attempting to break the tension that his perhaps ill-advised question had caused.
It wasn't very long before the first guests arrived. A beautiful woman with dark skin came it, shortly followed by a little boy around Draco and Harry's age. Draco immediately pulled the little boy over to the corner that had been assigned to the children, while Severus, Lucius, and Narcissa greeted Lady Zabini. Shortly thereafter, Theodore Nott and his father Cornelius came in. Once again, Draco came over, politely address the elder Nott, and then lead Theodore over to where the children were gathering. This became a pattern as the Parkinsons,  Greenglass, Goyle, and Crabbe families came in. The children were all gathered in their corner, and the adults mingled throughout the rest of the ballroom. More adults came in, including many of the Dark Lord's followers and high up Ministry donors and officials.
“Well... the night that he killed your parents, he did a spell. The spell was... “ Here, Severus hesitated. He was worried about telling Harry about the man that had almost killed him. He saw that Harry had stopped eating and was watching him intently while chewing on his lower lip. Severus knew that he couldn't just stop.
“Father said that you followed the bad man who killed my mom and dad, but that you stopped because you wanted to protect my family. Cousin Narcissa said that we are family. Does that mean that you will protect me too?” Narcissa looked incredibly sad, and Lucius could see tears glimmering in her eyes. Lucius looked uncomfortable and shamefaced, but he nodded.
“I know Severus. We need to keep an eye on him.”
“I, Harry, the Promised King, do judge you, Rowle, as following the Shadowed Path.” Harry’s eyes began to glow, and Rowle could almost see a shadow of a crown above his head. His voice got deeper, as if someone was speaking through the small child. “As Mordred before you, I condemn you to death, to save the world from your darkness. May your soul find peace in the Beyond.” Rowle let out a gurgle of pain, and fell on his face onto the ground, writhing in pain.
“Well, the snakes helped you get away from him, like you asked. And the Aurors took the bad man away. You won’t ever have to worry about that man again.” Harry nodded, and seemed content to cuddle with Draco and Severus. It wasn’t long before Severus could hear deep breathing coming from both boys. Severus let out a sigh of relief that Harry wouldn’t have to deal with the memory of Rowle’s death at his young age. He had already been through too much. Making sure the boys were fully sleeping, Severus moved them so they were in the bed and covered them both up. Leaving a small light on in the corner and setting an alarm spell to let him know if either of the boys woke, Severus made his way to his room to finally sleep. He felt drained after being so worried for so many hours.
I am so sorry for the wait! Between new job and holidays, this has been a crazy month. But here is the next chapter, and I am writing regularly so there will be more soon. Thank you so much all my readers!
Harry woke up, but this morning he remembered everything that had happened the past two days. He was at a place called Hogwarts, and he had a new father, and his own room, and he never had to see Dudley or his aunt and uncle ever again. Harry jumped out of bed, then turned and carefully made his bed. Once it was all neat, he went to the doorway of his room.
The book hit the opposite wall, and bounced back to run into a lamp and knock it to the floor with a crash. It bounced off the couch and headed towards Harry. Harry ducked and screamed, grabbed his blanket off the couch, and ran.
“If you gentlemen can reign it in for a moment, I think I found what we all have been looking for.” Narcissa placed the book on Lucius’s desk and opened it to the page with the prophecy. All of the men came to look as she stepped back.
“This place, it’s very special. It’s very special to everyone, because everyone thinks of the Founders of this school as very important people. But it’s extra special to you. Why don’t you show me how to open the door, and I will tell you more inside.” Harry nodded again, and then put his hand on the image of the crown hovering over Avalon, confirming Severus’s suspicions. Harry was the Promised King.
“So, I found out Harry was a Parselmouth when he left our chambers late last night…” Severus detailed the previous night to Lucius and Narcissa, gratified to see their eyes go wide and both of them go pale. He had wanted to do the same last night, but didn’t want Harry to think there was something wrong or that he was afraid of him.
**********
Had had made his way about halfway across the room on the third shelf when he started to hear a buzzing, almost like the hum of bees. He looked around the room, but didn't see anything. He continued to dust the books on the shelf. The buzzing got louder, and Harry turned to look around the room again, looking for something that could be making the noise, but couldn't see anything. The buzzing continued to get louder and louder until with a bang one of the books shot off the shelf and began ricocheting around the room at high speed.
“Harry was severely abused by his relatives, and tends to be very timid around new people. I will discuss with him when he would like to meet you, since the Headmaster has made it abundantly clear that he doesn’t have a choice in the matter.” Lupin grew pale for a moment when Severus said that Harry had been abused, then hot color began to flood his cheeks.
Just as the thoughts that everything was going according to plan crossed his mind, one of the many devices on his shelves began to whirl and buzz. Albus cocked his head and his brow furrowed. The device was linked to Harry’s well-being, and was only supposed to go off if Harry was in danger. As Albus got up to check, the device slowed down and stopped buzzing. Albus relaxed. He was sure that Harry had merely tripped or was roughhousing with his cousin. No actual harm to worry about. Albus was confident that all was well.
By the time Severus was done explaining, he was almost hoarse. Remus was sitting again, his elbows perched on the arms of the chair and his clasped hands in front of his mouth. He seemed deep in thought. After an indeterminate length of time, Remus finally spoke.
A moment later, the two of them appeared in the Floo reception room. Draco was waiting for them, bouncing in his seat on the settee. As soon as Harry and Severus were through the fireplace, Draco jumped up and ran over.
Harry and Severus spent the rest of the evening together quietly. Severus asked Harry how he would feel about helping with potions on Sundays, as a ritual that the two of them did together like reading before bed. Harry immediately agreed. After dinner, the rest of the evening went by as it had for the past several days, lending a feeling of familiarity that Severus was happy was developing. Severus helped Harry in the bath, and then Severus helped Harry into his pajamas. Harry cuddled up with Shadow and his stuffed dragon while Severus read a chapter from their nighttime book. As Severus was finishing his chapter, Harry spoke up.
“He's fine. He's just startled, one of my books got a little excited.” Looking at Minerva, Severus figured out that he might have an idea of a way to give Harry a safe place as well as a place where Severus could find him. But he wanted to work on it a little bit first.
“Y-yes, sir.” Harry answered quietly. Lucius smiled at the small boy.
As soon as they were done with morning lessons, Draco grabbed Harry's hand and started to lead him towards the dining room, chattering all the while about the animals that they had in the stables, and the ones that he wanted to see, and the different kinds of animals that he wanted to see, and the different kinds of magic that he  couldn't wait to learn. Draco explained that they couldn't learn until they got wands, and that wasn't until they were eleven, five long years. Draco led Harry into a large dining room, much fancier than Harry had ever been in. There was a long table, with four settings at one end. Draco directed Harry to sit next to him, and Narcissa joined them on the other side of the table.
A few minutes later, Severus appeared at the door of the bathroom followed by a woman who appeared to be his opposite in every way. Where Severus was dark of hair and eyes and clothing, this woman was fair. Her hair was such a pale blond that it almost looked white, and her pale blue eyes perfectly matched her dress. Harry couldn't help the words he said next.
He arrived to find the room in shambles. A number of bookshelves had been broken, as well as all of the lamps and he could see through the bathroom door that the bathroom mirror was cracked as well. He barely managed to duck as a book flew through the air towards him. He immediately recognized it as the Treaties on the Element of Air. It wasn't a book that was malevolent, just one that preferred to be flying around unless spelled down. The spell was easily disturbed when touched. But where was Harry.
Harry finally spoke again after a quiet moment.
“I know, it's intimidating.” Severus crouched down so he could whisper in Harry's ear. “The first couple few times I was here I was afraid to sit on any of the furniture. “ Severus looked Harry in the face and nodded seriously. Harry giggled.
“Yes. Harry is very polite.” Severus walked up to frame Harry, hoping that it would make him feel better. He hadn't anticipated that Draco had already made up his mind about Harry.
“No! You said that I could stay with you! You said that you were friends with my mom. Please don't change your mind! I promise I'll stop crying!” He began wiping his face furiously with the sleeve of his pajamas.
“Shadow! What are you doing?! I can’t leave the rooms! Father will be mad!” Harry hissed quietly. Shadow glared back at him, and almost looked like he was telling Harry to be quiet. Shadow slinked out the door and then turned back as if waiting for Harry to follow him. Harry looked back at the door to Severus’s room, where he could hear quiet snoring. He didn’t want his father to be mad at him, but something in him said that this was important. Mr. Malfoy said it was important to trust his instincts, and this felt like instincts to Harry.
Severus took Harry to the lounge next to the dining room, waiting for everyone else to join them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Can she safely be around other people without biting them? I cannot condone you having a serpent as a… friend if she is a danger to others. Or Shadow.” Harry hissed, and the tiny serpent fluttered her little wings, which were almost dry, as she hissed back.
“You don’t want me to, do you?” Severus sighed. His son was really too observant sometimes.
**********
“Um, excuse me,” He asked the black haired man, as he was closest. “How does everyone know my name?” Severus looked at Poppy, who shrugged and gave him a look  that indicated that she was going to let him explain.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And are you going to be discussing more... recent history?” Lucius's voice was mild, but Narcissa knew that there were layers to Lucius's question. He wanted to know if Severus had warned her off talking about the Dark Lord. Narcissa narrowed her eyes at Lucius, who pointedly ignored it and continued to eat while he waited for an answer. Draco continued to eat, punctuating his lunch with comments about magical animals that his mom had told him about earlier. Harry...
Harry was absorbed, and wanted to help stir to change the colors. Severus let him play with stirring the potion for a little bit, then showed him how to clean the potion supplies correctly. After their potion was completed Harry went to play in his room and Severus started on the laborious task of researching Harry's scar and others like it. He quickly learned that the worst thing as a parent was researching something that might be wrong with your child. He did his best to ignore the possibilities that had nothing to do with Harry's history, or things that showed symptoms where Harry had none. He was dismayed when he came up with almost nothing.
The days flew by quickly, and the day of the gala arrived The house elves were making sure that all of the final decorations were in place and everything that was needed for the feast was prepared, and Narcissa took on the task of making sure that the boys were dressed and looking their best. Severus allowed Lucius to assist with making sure that he was dressed well, as he decided against wearing his usual black dress robes.
“He said that he made a mistake, and that he would help protect us because we are family. And he is going to teach me magic like the old knights from Merlin's story!” Severus raised an eyebrow and looked at Harry closely.
**********
“In regards that that, Draco, I have one thing to say. And you will obey this period end of story.” Draco looked at his mother. He knew that when she used that tone of voice that there was no wiggle room. “This will NOT be discussed with ANYONE outside of this room and Severus. You can discuss the fact that you are friends with Harry, but nothing about wandless magic.” Draco nodded, completely serious.
“Does this have to do with Harry speaking Parseltongue? I didn’t tell anyone.” Remus stated.
“Yes. I am sure now that Harry is the Promised King. And that Occamy egg had been waiting in the chamber for him to get there so it could hatch and be his familiar. I can’t even imagine what is in the rooms of the individual founders. I believe that it will be a great wealth of knowledge that Harry will need to have as he gets older and his powers grow. Gods, with his powers as they are now, I can’t imagine him being stronger.” Severus sighed. If he was this stressed out about protecting his son now, after only a couple of months, he didn’t know how he was going to make it until Harry was an adult. Narcissa caught the look on Severus’s face and laughed lightly.
Thank you everyone for all of the wonderful comments. I have been working on this regularly, and I will try to update once a week but might be up to two weeks between updates depending on life.
Much loves to you all!
Severus and Harry appeared in what appeared to be a dingy alley. Normally, Severus would have Apparated directly into Diagon Alley, but Severus wanted Harry to experience the opening of the alley on his first visit.  He looked at his son, and noticed that he was a little green.
Not mine, not mine, not mine!
“Before I speak with you, I would like to confirm three things. First of which, may I place a ward around the room so we have no eavesdroppers?” Remus nodded, startled at how polite Severus was being considering his earlier comments.
“That traitor adopted the Dark Lord’s greatest enemy. I am going to put you somewhere where they will never find you, and when the Dark Lord returns those traitors will get what they deserve. Which is a slow and painful death.” The man looked down at the boy in his arm. “Probably the same for you. Once the Dark Lord gets rid of traitors and you, there won’t be anything in his way. And I will be his most trusted and respected.” Harry felt something inside him go cold. This monster was going to hurt his family. His father, who took care of him and loved him like no one he could remember. His cousin Narcissa, and Lucius, and Draco. Harry could feel himself start shivering, more scared for his family than himself. He knew that he could deal with whatever this man would do to him, but he couldn’t let him hurt his family.
“So, Severus, since we have a moment, would you like to discuss what has you on pins and needles? You are practically radiating tension.” Narcissa came around the couch and sat down, patting the cushion next to her.
“I also need to tell you that I adopted Harry. In a magical ceremony, almost as soon as I found him. I didn’t want Albus to be able to take him away. Harry is MY son now. The only reason that I am going along with Albus’s request for him to spend time with you is because I don’t want him to get any ideas about my feelings regarding Harry. The longer Albus stays in the dark, the safer Harry will be.” Remus stopped him by raising a hand.
“Harry, wake up.” Harry blinked a couple of times and then smiled at Severus.
“Harry, I would like you to push the fork down towards the table if you can. With your magic.” Harry stared at the fork, focused on pushing the fork down. The fork wobbled in the air, and dropped about half an inch before Harry stopped and blinked, shaking his head.
“I can't tell you how worried I was about Draco, for ages. He was so tiny and fragile. He's much heartier now. Although sometimes he just won't stop talking.” Severus chuckled.
“You nasty little shite! Trying to get out of a well deserved beating!” Vernon dropped him onto the growing puddle on the floor. Vernon kicked the boy on the floor, fury and glee mingling when the child whimpered. Vernon had always had a sadistic streak and was more than happy to let it out on the freak that had been forced upon their family. He kicked again, knocking the boys head against the wall.
Severus gave a curt nod once he had Remus’s agreements, and then quickly left. He knew he was going to have to get used to being around the werewolf for testing, and because he was spending time with Harry, and because of the headmaster, but that didn’t mean that he had to like it. He felt a wave of exhaustion from holding up his occlumency for so long. He walked into his quarters, nodded at Tippy, and made his way to his bed.
**********
“I take it the house elves have been sharing the Christmas chocolate already?” Draco nodded. Harry, always more sedate than Draco, went to Severus, who pulled him up onto his lap. He looked shyly at Remus.
“I was talking to your mom for a while, then I fell asleep. Sorry about that.” Draco put his arm around Harry.
“But… magic isn’t real. Magic is bad, and not real.” Harry began to shake, and seemed to shrink into himself. Snape moved forward slowly, remembering when he had been this age and did the same thing when trying to keep out of his father’s bad temper. He sat down on the chair next to Harry's bed, and Harry's eyes locked on the black eyes. He'd never seen black eyes before.
“Welcome again, child of magic.” The gargoyle said. Harry waved, and moved to the side with the hidden door. Severus was about to stop Harry from walking into what appeared to be a solid stone wall when Harry walked straight through. Severus walked up to the wall, and placed his hand on what appeared to be a solid wall to him. All of a sudden, Harry’s head poked out of the wall.
Thank you very much for all of the WONDERFUL comments. Your love is my drive to keep writing. I am sorry if this chapter seems a little short compared to others, I wanted to share this meeting before there was rioting.
“It’s too late. You are a bad man, and you follow a bad man, and I won’t let you hurt my father, or Lucius, or Remus.” Rowle let go of Harry so he could swipe at one of the snakes with his knife, and pull out his wand with the other. Harry stepped away from him and turned to face him. Rowle looked him in the eyes for the first time, and saw ancient eyes in a little boy face. He felt a sharp pain in his leg, and looked to see that the black viper had reared up and bit him on the calf. He dropped his wand and pulled the black snake off his leg, only to have one of the grey and black vipers bite him on the hand. Rowle dropped to his knees as pain shot through his leg and arm. Harry watched emotionless, and Severus came up behind him and put a hand on his shoulder. Lucius came up to stand beside Severus, and Remus did the same on the other side.
He was still trying to process what he saw. He knew, intellectually, that Severus had told him about Harry. The Promised King, the parseltongue, the wand less magic. But seeing Harry standing there, power emanating from him in waves, with the shadow of a crown hovering over his head and a grown man’s voice coming from him… That was way more than Severus had told him. He’s gotten the impression, although they had not shown it, that Severus and Lucius were surprised as well.
“How about we go home for dinner, and you can tell me more?: Harry nodded, and turned and give Draco a hug, much to the surprise of everyone in the room.
“I got him, Lily. He's my boy now, and I am going to make sure he's okay. Your sister... I don't know how she could do that, but she will never hurt him again. I swear it.”
Without a second thought, Severus Disapparated back to Hogwarts, not realizing that Harry had woken at all.
Harry had stopped eating. He felt very overwhelmed. Things were changing so fast, and his tummy hurt like he had been spun around fast for too long. He took a couple of deep breaths, trying to settle his stomach. Severus recognized the look of panic on Harry's face. Too much too soon. He crouched down next to Harry's chair and covered Harry's hand with his.
“I've never seen them do that before! They don't usually react to people at all! That's so cool!” Harry smiled shyly.
“Harry, now that you are going to be living with me, there are things that you are going to need to know about the wizarding world. We are going to go through things each night, and I don't expect that you are going to remember them the first time that we go through them, or even the second. But if we start reviewing these things now, when you are older and start attending school, these things will become like second nature.” Harry blinked a couple of times and nodded, although he wasn't really sure what his new father was talking about. Severus opened the book to a page around the middle.
***********
To everyone who has read, liked, bookmarked, or commented: Thank you so much for your patience. I know that I haven't updated for a long time, and although the depression was part of it, the other was because this was a very emotional chapter for me. It hits very close to home, and I hope that the emotion reflects in the writing. I cried, a couple of times, while writing it. I only wish that every abused child was as lucky to have a loving forever family the way that my Harry does.
“I have already brought the situation to the attention of Minerva and Poppy. They were both so furious with Albus that I am sure they will side with me in regards to Harry just to spite him. Minerva actually performed our adoption ritual. Albus will have no more control or influence over my son than the Dark Lord.”
Severus went over to the Floo and called to the Malfoy’s. Stepping through, he was very quickly presented with his glowing son.
“Ugh, Shadow, stop. I’m sleeping.” Harry muttered. He was very excited for his first Christmas, which was only a few days away. Shadow was determined to get his attention, and climbed up on his chest and batted at his face again. Harry opened his eyes and glared at his cat. “What, Shadow?” Shadow put a paw right in the middle of Harry’s lips, as if telling him to be quiet. All of a sudden Harry was wide awake. Shadow was doing that thing where he didn’t act like a cat. Harry sat up, and Shadow jumped off the bed and moved towards the door of his room. Harry put on his slippers and robe to ward off the chill of the dungeons in winter, and followed his cat. Shadow moved to the entrance of the chambers and put a paw on the door. A moment later, the door silently opened.
“Severus, would this be okay with you? We would be more than happy to keep Harry during the day, and I know that there are a number of things that you wanted to make sure that Harry was taught.”  Severus thought about it for a moment. It would actually take care of a number of things that he was concerned about. Harry would no longer be kept to himself most of the day, he would be acclimated to being around people, and Harry would begin to learn the importance of his family.
“This is your other family, the Potters. This is James Potter's family.” He showed Harry that he was also at the bottom of this family tree. He showed Harry the pictures of his mother and father, and Harry stared without blinking, drinking in the first sight of the parents who he had never met.
Dealing with the aftermath of Rowle.
“Severus, can you please come to my office?”
“I am glad. I hope that, should you have any questions, you will feel free to ask me. I might not be the educator that my wife is,” he smiled at Narcissa. “But I do have a wide scope of knowledge.” Harry stared at his plate, fiddling with his fork.
It took much longer than he expected before someone realized that there were more children than expected in the corner.  One of the less savory members of their former group, Thorfinn Rowle, came up to Severus and Lucius as they were discussing the new year.
“Harry, I have something for you. It was given to me many years ago... by your mother. It's not really my style, but I thought you might like to put it up in here. Would you like to see it.” Harry sat up and dropped the ribbon he had been playing with the figurine with. The tiny dragon pounced on the ribbon and rolled, much the same way a crocodile would, catching the ribbon with teeth and claws, wrapping itself up and wiggling to try to get out once it realized that it was tangled. Harry absentmindedly untangled the figurine while watching Severus. Severus unrolled the tapestry, which was about as long as he was tall and about as wide as his arms would spread.
“Have you picked out a name for this little one?” Severus placed the tiny dragon on Harry's bedside table. The dragon had come with a stand that included a little nest, and the dragon made it's way up and curled up in it's nest.
Harry looked around the room as the lights came on at the room that his new father said was his. His life was changing so fast that he didn't know what to do or think. Severus set Harry down on the floor and pulled the blanket and sheet down so Harry could get into the bed. He gestured towards the bed, and Harry climbed up.
“Shadow, I am well aware of how smart you are and therefore that you understand everything that I am saying to you. You are here as a companion to my son, Harry. He's not been well taken care of, much like yourself. That room...” and he turned and pointed to the door of his lab. “That is my lab. I frequently work in there with things that will doubtlessly make you very ill and possibly kill you, so I would stay away from that room. You are more than welcome to wander the grounds, but please look out for Harry. That's the most important thing.”
“Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon said that they died in a car crash, and that my dad was useless and a freak and didn't work.” Severus sighed deeply to control his anger, and he noticed that Harry tensed.
“I will let you know. Depending on how expensive I determine the ingredients needed, I may take you up on that. I very much doubt that I could get them through the potion ingredient budget for my classes.” Severus pinched the bridge of his nose, not looking forward to the conversation that he was going to have to have with one Remus Lupin. “I should take Harry home. We have to talk.”
“Harry, I know that things are overwhelming right now, but you are going to get used to it. You don't have to be afraid to talk, or to eat, or anything. I would never do anything to hurt you, and you aren't going to get in trouble for speaking your mind. I WANT to know what you are thinking. That is the only way that you are going to start to heal.” Harry didn't really understand what Severus meant by heal, because he wasn't in pain anymore from the beatings yesterday, but he nodded anyway.
“I know that I was worried about you, but I want to say that I am proud of you for following your instincts. It’s important to hone that skill, and I know it’s hard to recognize. In time, you will also know when to discuss these instincts and when to keep them to yourself.” Harry smiled a small smile and nodded, then led Severus out of their rooms and towards the chamber that he had found the Occamy in. As they got closer to Dumbledore’s rooms Severus grew worried, but Harry noticed and took one of Severus’s hands in his.
“Severus! Thank you for indulging me! How is young Harry adapting to being surrounded by magic? Lemon drop?” Severus reinforced his mental shields and shook his head in the negative.
“Lily and James Potter were amazing and selfless people, and they died protecting you.” Harry licked his lips.
Severus walked over to the bed where Harry was curled up, crying softly. “Harry,” he said. “Harry, if you don't want to stay with me, you don't have to. I only want to protect you.” At the thought that Severus might be taking his offer back, Harry sat back up.
Severus took Harry home and offered him dessert. He liked that they had developed a tradition of talking about serious topics at the table together. Harry had just started eating his chocolate ice cream when Severus cleared his throat.
“Maybe there is because of their history.” Narcissa stepped forward and put a hand on each of their arms. “Severus, Remus, we all care for Harry. Let’s not continue fighting. It’s not good for the children to deal with this kind of animosity.” Severus stepped back but continued to sneer at Remus. He couldn’t believe that this… this… mangy cur was intruding on his time, his life, with Harry. But he knew that Remus wouldn’t hurt Harry, he just couldn’t help but throw in his face that Remus had almost mauled him as a teenager. He also knew that at the time, there hadn’t been Wolfsbane Potion. He also knew, although he’d rather have his fingernails ripped off than admit it, that Lupin had suffered a great deal from the loss of Lily and James. Maybe as much as he had, if you added the prejudice against werewolves to it. He huffed a breath out through his nose and sat back down.
“And I think that I should bring Remus up to speed. With everything. Having a Griffyndor in my corner will make dealing with Albus easier. Especially when given all the details, Remus will be firmly in Harry’s corner.” Severus didn’t want to share Harry with the werewolf, didn’t want him anywhere near Harry, but he had studied them extensively after his brush with a death as a teenager and knew that Remus’s pack mentality would be another layer of protection on Harry.
“That was what he said. “I, Harry, the Promised King, do judge you, Rowle, as following the Shadowed Path.” Both Severus and Lucius nodded. That sight was burned into their memories. Narcissa excused herself, leaving Severus and Lucius to their own devices.
Harry and Severus finish their weekend, and Harry's first lessons.
“He's very near-sighted, but nothing that I can't fix. We may need to do it again when he gets older, if it's degenerative, but I wouldn't worry about it.” She subtly waved her wand again, and Harry stopped following the light. He blinked a couple of times, and then smiled at Severus and Poppy from across the room.
“Severus. Lucius.” Both men turned to see Remus walk out of the ballroom. “Narcissa sent a Patronus, said that you needed help tracking Harry.” Severus felt hope fill him, and at that same time resentment for needed Remus for anything.
“I look forward to seeing Harry. When would you like to arrange introductions?” Severus took a deep breath and stood to his full height.
Severus opened the door of the carrier, and the cat stepped out and stretched. He was thin and lanky, showing that he had a lot of growing to do by the size of his paws and ears. He mewled at Severus and touched his hand with a soft paw before jumping off the table and exploring the room with his tail like a flag over his back.
Harry doesn’t ask anything more, for fear of the glare Diana hawks at him, her eyebrows thick and dark. She’s wearing a turtleneck, though the day is beginning to heat.
“Ministry-sheltered family.”
“Not exactly,” Hermione says, though her brow crinkles in confusion. “It’s just—I’m not entirely sure, Harry. But I heard from Nev, actually, and Padma—” she sighs. Upstairs, Ron’s frantic footsteps, rushing to the cries of their daughter, waking from a nap. “Maybe,” she suggests, “you should just write to him? No harm in a letter.”
The aspens fall off at the edge of the park and the handful of strangers—six of them, Harry counts—check for cars, step out into the street.
Bristles. Pushes into Harry’s neck. Kneads the pulse with his tongue. “Okay. I’m ready.”
“Well—did you?”
“Well, I am.”
“Oh. It’s blue, for me.” Malfoy circles a finger around the rim of his glass. “The poolwater. Theo’s eyes. It was the most I
Malfoy stares down at his drink, half-full. Harry wants to take the clenched jaw between his fingers; feel the bone under his tongue.
There’s another pause—longer this time, long enough for the dormouse to sniff the autumn air, meticulous, suspicious, then raise a miniscule paw and begin to creep toward Harry.
But Malfoy holds him there, knee wedged between Harry’s thighs, biting his lower lip, moaning as their bodies shift, heat-seeking. They’ll both drown, eventually, but water is just like heaven: Bright, airless, blue. Harry tastes Malfoy’s tongue. The loose shirt cast open, Harry’s palms on flushed skin like he’s already devoted. He blinks down at the pale plane of it; the old silvery scars.
Harry waits.
“Too much.”
It’s Malfoy—Harry starts, looks over, like he forgot who was there, who gave him the date, the location, the time. Malfoy, for his part, unaffected, speckled in early sun. “Makes it sound political somehow, but I wanted...a unifier, something professional. Ezra—Rhodes, just on—just up there,” he motions toward a wiry black man just ahead of them, who turns and nods in Harry’s direction. “We met just after the war and he—ah, he helped me find my way.”
It’s the kind of winter that wipes clean the slate of the city. Big sloping white ribbons of breath. Cold air like a clipped, jagged tongue, up and down the throat.
“Look.” Malfoy takes half a step back, situates his hands on his hips. “The only thing I find the need to trust, here, is that I know—beyond any doubt, you’re stronger than the rest of us, combined, and—you’re good. I don’t care what else is in there.”
“What the
But growth is not weakness—and Harry knows, even in his childish slump, that a friend who sees, who
The house is concealed with charms much like those obscuring 12 Grimmauld; Harry recognizes the almost-invisible glimmer. Ezra raises a broad hand and dissolves the signature. It’s a grim face that greets them. Raven-bricked and shuttered; the only hint of light the gleam of sun off a large brass knocker. Diana presses the tip of her wand to the knocker, and it shudders, then glows. A lock unclicks.
“She died just after the trials.” Malfoy continues. “She was...not herself. They tried to help her, but—so long in one place, so starved of light and human contact, she wasn’t herself. She wasn’t willing anymore.”
“Well, it’s not exactly—” Harry inhales frustratedly. “Not as though I know what I should or shouldn’t do, Malfoy, you’ve not given me a single instruction in all of this save ‘be here, this time!’”
Draco holds him till morning.
Draco presses, “Is this about poor sleep? Or Muggle technology, or—”
A car is making its way down the thin alley. Harry and Malfoy separate in the middle and press against opposite walls. The brick is cool at Harry’s back. He keeps Malfoy’s gaze; trying to deconstruct. The failure—the winning magic—itches at his skin, still. When he blinks, he sees Annabeth.
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING TRUE—AS ONE INCAPABLE OF MY OWN DISTRESS
It’s a rather debauched look, the more Harry stares.

He turns on the light in the loo, sits down along the cool, dark wall. The skin of his neck sweating. He licks his lips, eyes shut. If his complications—immense, untraceable—were malleable, he would form them into something small, palm-sized. Stuff it in the bathtub drain, wash it down with water.
Then Ezra clears his throat and Draco turns away. Tips his neck back and touches his fingers to his neck. “Isaac? Do you remember the practice?”
“You’re tired, you’re in no condition to—”
“I wish I could be balanced, like I need to be—for this work.”
“I had a hunch,” Malfoy cuts in, eyes not quite meeting Harry’s. “I had a feeling. That you would...find the pain, quickly, and know how to fix it.”
“And?”
Harry nods, finger stuck on his bottom lip. “Grief.”
When Draco looks up, his eyes are full of longing; perhaps for someone to tell him that the root of all healing is love.
“Then why won’t you go in my car?”
“And just...sorry, I’m still a bit muddled—what is it, he does?”
Harry is reaching, now, for Draco’s thigh under the bar, and when he places a tentative hand he feels the leg shaking.
For all his pushing away, Draco reaches around and clings, hands fisting Harry’s jumper, lips slipping dark hair. “See what.”
Ron takes a drink of his own, long and meandering. He leans back against the wooden booth, tracing a thumb over the wet ring his glass leaves on the table. “I dunno, mate,” he shakes his head. “It’s a bit odd, is all, that he’s—y’know, claiming this is all...honest, no strings attached.”
Feels like a boy again, full of irresponsible fire. Knowing nothing. Feeling everything. Burning out on a glance, a brush of fingers—a
“Say,” Malfoy starts.
“Muggle university?”

“I’m...I’m bad at relationships,” he tries, shifting where he sits, “I’m bad at normal relationships, I should say. I never quite learned how to...I just feel all sorts of things, all at once, and I find it difficult to sort through. Jane says—”
“Unless—unless you’re a total stranger, and you’re quite talented at voice-altering charms, and I’m being completely bamboozled.”
ARE YOU ALLOWED TO LOVE IN ANGER?
The light relaxes and shines. Warm, yellow, full.
“No,” Draco smiles halfway; a feat. Below them, the broken house groans. “I do.”
Draco goes to sleep without even trying; that’s how good his body is. That’s how
Hearing Draco say, “Won’t you look at me?”
to swim, rather than charm oneself into swimming.”
“Well, sure,” Harry shrugs, in an effort to rid any of the hysteria buzzing in the tips of his fingers, snapping at his throat. He shrugs again, quickly, for emphasis. “Why not? All needs doing, sometime.”
Harry steps forward, raises his face to the open air. Feels a slight breeze. He focuses on the blue underneath it all, hazy, desperate. He flexes his fingers, again. Wand buzzing. He doesn’t reach, yet. Maybe he won’t need to.
The faction crosses the empty street. “Owners are gone,” Draco tells him. “Sometimes it’s difficult to witness.”
His own magic slips. Slice of bright light.
Because I never learned to hold my tongue, Harry wants to say. Because I couldn’t stand it if you left, forgot about me, slept better in another house—a sturdier, more beautiful house, one you made with your own magic, your own two hands. One you fixed, without me.
He accepted one last kiss from Harry, on the cheek—though it lingered to the point of a small noise in the back of Malfoy’s throat, something that sounded like
“Go ahead. If you—even if you don’t want to help, again, I’m grateful you tried.”
A tightness forms in the space behind Harry’s eyes. Malfoy, patient. Slow. The idea gnaws at him. Briefly, attracts him.
“I can’t
“Oh, please.”
he is. And Harry has hands that always seem to be reaching. Grappling, desperate, pushing fingers up through white hair, down the pink neck.
Though her eyebrows go up slightly, Hermione makes no other sign of surprise. “Well—how lovely. I’m glad you’re...getting along with—I’m glad, Harry.”
Harry chokes on wine. “Pardon?”
It doesn’t sound like an insult, but Harry can’t be sure. “And he is serious,” Malfoy remarks, glumly.
“No,” he says. “No, I feel fine.”
“It’s a—bad change?”
“He tried to tell me it was like sleeping; something that would come easy, with time. If I relaxed, if I stopped thinking of it like a chore, like a difficult chore. So I started swimming in my sleep. Dreaming of the pool, of my arms knowing what to do, of my breaths syncing in with my strokes. And it worked, it really worked—I learned how to swim. Didn’t always know if I was swimming, or sleeping. Or if when I swam, I slept.”
In bed, sprawled, the walls of Grimmauld close in quick. Harry breathes hard. Regrets instantly. Can hardly stand the evidence of his mistake, sticky on fingers.
There is a sound like a sigh, then a little bit of a laugh. It wriggles into Harry’s sternum and stays. “I hoped you would call.”
It seems a continual effort of Malfoy’s to surprise Harry. “Look—I apologize.” The apology is bare; firm, and honest. “I didn’t prepare you enough. I should have—done it slower, and been patient.”
Harry is practiced at each. He asks Draco if he would like to go home.
Harry wonders what it would be like to invite Alan Tiller for a drink; maybe share a brusque fuck in the loo. Drink a whiskey, after, and part ways. Uncomplicated.
Ron blusters. Stands up from the table. “I’m—I have to check on the stew.”
need you, your help,” Malfoy stumbles, a bit, in the correction, like his first words didn’t want to be atoned for, or tempered.
A string of pearly lights loops from the edge of the kitchen window to the other. There’s a clock with bold red numbers hanging above the hob. Malfoy and his half-familiar face. This does not look like a place he would live—but he is living here, and he’s cooking, for Harry. No shoes no socks. Two glasses in. He wears a loose burgundy shirt, tucked halfway into a pair of neat slacks. Hair brushing neck.
the way some might think of a ladder: Steps, and one long climb. The destination higher than the starting point. Uphill. Diagonal. Home is an easy word to sound out, it sounds just like it should. But the carpet is unsure of its color and the walls unsure of their job. Falling-in. What immensity could stand so small a space?

“What?”
“I’m sorry, I’m just—” Harry turns, restless, facing Malfoy’s profile. “Trying to understand you.”
“Not you—me. Maybe I need to be...smarter about this.”
survived.”
Malfoy, who tells him, “I don’t put out on the first date,” then slips his tongue between the seam of Harry’s lips and gasps, quietly, as Harry presses hands under the loose maroon shirt, looking for skin.
“I worry, Harry—” Hermione cuts herself off, takes her hand from Ron’s to grip Harry’s arm instead. “That you’re overthinking.”
“I hope it works.”
Maybe the drain would clog with his hurt; maybe the hurt would crawl back up. Wouldn’t stay where he wanted it to stay. Couldn’t be drowned. Slip along the light to dark he had manufactured, so carefully, in this old ancestral home.
“I don’t,” Harry sucks a spot into his neck. Skin covering bone. “I won’t.”
“You’re not keeping me,” Draco says, quiet. “I got in the car of my own volition.”
Harry realizes his hand is still stuck firmly to his chest, over his heart. He lets it loosen. Fall away. “Covenant?”
“Usually you feeling flighty, huh,” Ron muses, yanking closer the fuschia round of a Molly-made scarf. “Leaving before—well, someone else leaves.”
: Harry finds it of course it’s too close to home. Vision oscillating between Annabeth—kept, unclean—and his own crouched form, abused in quiet ways.
“Can you feel it?”
But to imagine oneself kissing one’s childhood swimming instructor; hardly anything straight in that. “So you’re, um,” Harry clears his throat. “You’re—”
“You’re blinding.”
The encounter didn’t perplex Harry as much as he thought it should. He warmed at the thought of it frequently the next few days, couldn’t get it out of his head. Stared at the paper then decided not to call. Boundaries, Malfoy had said.
Ezra slants a smile, now. “Didn’t know what he was good at till I showed him.”
like a tightrope artist, knowing one good knife could cut the whole act down.
. Says, “who looked like you.”

Harry is taken aback. “I just wanted to hear your voice.”
“A year, mate, you’ve got time,” Ron interjects, gently. He’s staring down at the poorly scrawled list Harry’s gesturing toward, madly, brow knit in evident concern. “You have to get it all done...this week?”
Malfoy looks like he won’t believe a single word out of Harry’s mouth—not so long as he’s bleeding.
What is this—a play?
Feeling is a byproduct of a body. Harry resists, for a moment. Tries to, at least. His finger drips circles of red to the floor. Malfoy reaches out, appalled, yanks the wrist under water.

“Like that’s a good idea,” Ron laughs, lowering Rose into her little highseat at the end of the table.
“No,” he finally answers, picking distractedly at his sleeve. “It’s only that the location is confidential, and you’ve never been. We’ll have to side-along.”
“Oh,” Harry breathes, laughing, running a hand up Draco’s neck; feeling him tense with the hold. “I love you.”
The to-do list will fix everything.
The vision blurs: the green and black flash of premeditated failure.
No history—no future.
“Hi.”
“God,” Malfoy coughs on a laugh, “no.”
“Exactly,” Malfoy bookends. One hand reaching up, self-conscious, to brush a hair behind his ear.
“Oh,” Harry says, stupidly, because he doesn’t understand. He’s hardly a second to ask all the questions crowding his head, like when—

Harry blinks at the empty space; breathes in the absence. But Draco is yanking open the driver’s side, demanding, “Get out.”

—did Malfoy start fixing up magic houses, and when did all these others join in? And why is it they walk to where they need to go, instead of apparition, or flying? And how do people find them?
“Shut up.” Malfoy bites at his shoulder, tongue soothing the spot—and this is how it will proceed, no doubt; a burn followed by balm. “
Maybe he ought to feel self-conscious about being so bare, for laying so much of himself out—but Malfoy leans forward on his legs, elbows bent on knees, tipping his glass to his lips, letting the rest of it drain, and Harry feels nothing but an itch at the back of his neck, a burn in the flats of his feet.
That night, Harry touches himself to the thought of Malfoy.
He puts the words into the sweet rounded ear. “You’re sure?”
“Are we falling in love?”
“I should be angry with you. Why are you calling?”
He lets that impulse stay. Asks, “But—what does any of this have to do with home being a color?”
“Oh,” he inhales, sharply; lets the feeling ingratiate.
The magic is restless, glitters at the edge of the sink; it knows Harry’s heart. It knows Draco, too, like a river knows the bank—reaching out, always reaching.
“Oh, Ronald, aren’t we old enough to let go of our prejudices?”
someone whispers in his ear.
“Are you upset with what I’ve done?”
Malfoy looks up, then, surprised—laughs. “Oh, I thought you knew.” And then smiles. “It’s all completely pro-bono.”
⋅ ⋅ ⋅
Malfoy looks over. Has he always had such unthinkable eyes? Stones gilded in light? The way a river smooths over a rockbed, gentle, constant, Harry breathes and breathes and breathes.
And Harry has to hold breath: even when a house accepts his help, there is the chance it doesn’t work. The chance a dark, unsettled force still lurks. Waiting for vulnerable skin.
Malfoy sighs heavily. There’s a sound like rustling, like cloth on cloth. “I wish you’d spare me the honor.”
“Yes,” Malfoy laughs, a little. “You do.”
Harry keeps him. Tucked to his chest in the night, mumbling and sated. Like a fixable axis. He doesn’t sleep, for the longest time. Feels himself actively caving in.
Harry tries to breathe but the air is unbreathable. The others stuck fast to the floor—the house demanding they stay—but Harry is loose, hope spilling out like a downpour.
In the depths of sixth year, buried under expectations that exceeded self-worth, exceeded all cowering doubts, Harry sometimes stopped off near the Great Lake and looked over the dying grass of autumn and wondered if he was cut out for it, after all. The fixing. The ugly truth—felt in the cleft of his chest, tucked between ribs—being he had already failed to fix himself. He was a coward in the worst way—unable to admit he was alone in the failing, that he would always fail alone. Fix one thing, break a thousand others. It was all his own undoing.
They walk through the park, past people lounging on benches, children screaming in a pit of sand, flying by on swings. Past a marred stone fountain and copse of yellow-leaved aspens, they arrive at a huddle of people, chatting closely, voices low.
He thinks of Malfoy’s breath, hot on his neck. His
Harry shakes his head, looks over, laughs. “If I knew, I’d feel better, now.”
“You’re—still with him?”
“Potter, look, I—”
Draco snaps a stasis on the eggs, pins himself between Harry’s thighs. Looks up, wanting. “We’ll take less of the sun each year; and then, in repose, or rejection, or regret, we’ll fall down to die. Heavy and boned.”
So now, Harry’s fastening Hermione’s necklace around her throat while she holds up her bushy hair.
Harry opens the room’s door with Malfoy’s hand gripped tightly in his own. The same man from earlier is already walking up the hallway.
“No.”
Astoria has work to do for Daphne, so after Greg puts him under, Astoria enlists Draco’s help in stuffing envelopes with letters and forms.
“Did Hermione sic you on me?” He asks blandly, taking a sandwich.
“I haven’t been here much. Half the time I wasn’t supposed to go at all and was under my cloak the whole time.”
“No. Unless you want to.”
“Five, actually.”
“No, it’s okay. I’m sure you need the rest.” Harry says, rubbing Draco’s knuckles. It’s a reflexive action now, and he doesn’t need to verbalise its purpose anymore, as Draco relaxes with the touch.
“Okay.”
“Yeah, alright.”
“Sorry?” He sputters.
“I… no I don’t, I haven’t seen any of them in years. I ran into Nott at some point on Diagon, but we didn’t speak.”
“Just put on your nice suit, be glad it doesn’t have lace.”
“What if there’s someone who could help you better than me?” Harry asks softly.
Draco sits gingerly, waiting.
“I’m in the study, Draco.” Harry calls back, poking his head out the door.
“How would you know? Vane won’t even look at you.”
Draco rests his head against Harry’s shoulder, letting his eyes fall closed as the fingers in his hole move deeper, stretching his hole open.
“Of course you were. You weren’t interested before, now that you’ve seen it, you are.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fuck you, Harry.” He says, though it’s laced with a smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The Boy Who Lived, everyone.”
Draco mostly tunes out for a bit until he hears his name called by Prott.
“Alright. Sometimes it’s used for this.” He says, his hand moving faster now that the
“So tell me both options then, the dress and the robes. We can coordinate.” Harry suggests.
