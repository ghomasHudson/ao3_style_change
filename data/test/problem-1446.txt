Harry had stopped all his ministrations. He was looking disheveled, more than his usually untamed hair style. He stuck his tongue out once again before saying :
oOoOo
*Knock, knock*
Draco woke up from the nightmare, the memory from the sixth year. He was sweating. His heart was beating fast. If pairing with Potter brought back memories of their fights, the cohabitation wouldn’t be easy, remembering those worst moments did not really put in peaceful mindset. The bruises from the day before had not disappeared yet. He could feel them when he tried moving his mouth. The glamour from the day before had probably worn off during his sleep. Therefore Draco hoped Potter’s curtains would be shut in order to be able to go to the bathroom unnoticed. In order to perform the spell correctly he had to see his reflection in the mirror. He got out of his bed and decided to also take a small shower to recover from the dream.
The room inside was beautiful. Two large four-posters beds were on each side of the room. Draco’s trunk had been put in front of the left one and he assumed the other one was Potter’s. Each side had a common setting: the bed, a bedside table, a chest of drawers and a small desk with a chair. Opposite to the entrance, there was a door that led to a bathroom. Curious, Draco pushed the door and discovered a magnificent room. Having a room for the two of them was a real improvement on their conditions. A bathtub big enough to fit two people and double bowl washbasin were for their use only. A few tablets were available to put their stuff on it. Behind a magical privacy screen there were the toilets. Contemplating the decoration of the room and its equipment, Draco did not hear Potter’s entry. He was surprised to hear a small whistling just behind him. Turning around abruptly Draco saw the look on Potter’s face. It was startling, he looked like he had not seen or had such a room before. Taking two seconds to see joy in those green eyes, Draco cautiously stepped out of the room in order to start unpacking. Robes, cloaks and pants found their place into the drawers. He gathered his school books, parchments and quills on the desk. From them he chose two books that he put on his bedside table to read at night. He wondered how the presence of Potter’s would affect his capacity to focus on homework. He might have to work in the library.
Impressed by his confidence, Harry looked at his friends to see their reaction. He already told them about the crush and quick time he had with the Quidditch player in the summer. He was not afraid of homophobic reaction but curious of what they thought when that affected Malfoy. Hermione looked concerned, as always she did not like when the press was trying to destroy somebody's life, even Malfoy's. Ron turn from blank, somewhat scared to flushed with a little smile. Perhaps the idea not to have any more Malfoys coming was appealing to him.
"How does next Saturday sound to you ?"
Easy enough but that started the game. Several students played without Harry taking real notice of what happened. But he focused again when the bottle landed on Draco, who chose Truth.
He lowered his head and stuck his tongue out. He felt Malfoy starting to shiver from impatience. When his tongue reached Malfoy's cock, he leaped the head. Then he proceeded to map every vein, every skin from the base to the top with his tongue. Below Harry, the Slytherin was loosing his mind, he squeaked not wanting to beg for more but the sensations too much and too little at the same time. After two minutes of the same treatment however his pride was not found and he asked :
Apart from the moments were they were gathered with all the other students, the mean looks and insults stopped. The other eighth year either took the recommendation from McGonagall very seriously; either they were tired of the war and needed calm to just study and come out of the year graduated. From some of them he could sense the suspicion, Longbottom was clearly avoiding him and Granger did not seem to be able not to look at him. He felt cautiousness and even pity from her. That made him feel sick, not because of her blood status; he had grown out of these beliefs, but because after everything he had done to Granger she still seemed to care.
"Everybody please go back to your seat and save a part of your potion for me" asked Slughorn "No need to remind you that it is strictly forbidden on Hogwarts ground to have Amortentia or to use it on somebody" he added while looking at two whispering girls from Hufflepuff.
The silence in the court room was heavy. People were glancing to Draco and back to Potter. Their animosity was publicly known. Draco had even published lies and tells of Potter thanks to Rita Skeeter back in fourth year. Despite Potter's intervention, he still felt his inside shaking. One minute he could not feel them and the other they seemed to be back with extra pounds in it. All the options were frightening, if he was released what was he going to do ; and if not, Azkaban wasn't a place he wanted to visit. People were now chatting while waiting for the jury to come up with a decision. All his future was going to be decided by a handful of persons in a tiny room. His eyes were looking for his mother. She should be here somewhere among the many witches and wizards. He finally spotted her in company of.. Potter?! The both of them where just on the side of the room. The Auror in charge of her surveillance was just a few feet back. Potter was extending his hand to Narcissa, she shook it a with a quick smile whispered a few words to Potter, she turned around and went back to her seat on the second row. Potter remained frozen a minute, gazed at Draco, nodded and went also back to his seat. The door on top of the room opened and Shaklebolt and the jury stayed up for the announcement.
Seamus was quickly counting on the people gathered in the little room. The room had provided them with sofas, cushions and little tables. They were 12 to play this evening from all the Houses. Harry was struck by the fact that they had managed to get everyone on board, even the Slytherin that were rarely seen in the common parts of the castle.
Once dressed up and ready for breakfast, he got out of the bathroom and saw that Potter’s curtains were still shut. He put in his bag some parchment and quills. He did not have yet his timetables, therefore he did not know what to expect. The courses were bound to be different from last year. Hogwarts managed by DeathEater had not been a sound idea. While walking towards the Great Hall he did not spot two seventh year students waiting in a corridor. When Draco heard their footsteps it was already too late. Both of them grabbed him by the collar and threw him on the floor. His head banged loudly on the stone. The hurt made him close his eyes so he did not see the fist that was coming. Hearing some noises from an adjacent corridor, both students stood up, leaving Draco on the floor. Painfully he got back on his feet. Going in the nearest bathroom he saw that he had some bad bruises on the face. He did not want to go to the breakfast like this, and the infirmary wasn’t an option as well. Even if the Malfoy’s name did not worth much these days, Draco was still proud and his talent in Glamour good enough to cover the bruises for the day.
After exchanging an intrigued look they stopped and replied "yes, sure".
He paused in his speech, maybe the whole thing was rehearsed after all, and resumed.
This time Harry went for Malfoy's perineum and that managed to shut him up. His tongue doing back and forth movements betweens the Slytherin's balls and his furled hole. The air was getting hotter from the quick breathing of both boys. Finally Harry settled to lick the blonde's hole with a flat tongue. That elicited some good noises from Malfoy. He kept repeating the motion until he felt him squirming below him. Then he push slowly into the hole.
Draco released a breath he did not realize he was holding. His mother was released and would be able to return to Malfoy Manor from now. Narcissa took his son in her arms and whispered
He jumped off the stage and slowly regained his seat next to a seemingly proud Granger and a struck Weasley. Just now, Draco was facing the same feeling that the red-haired one. How Potter came this morning with the idea to save his mother from jail... He breathed heavily and waited while the jury was deliberating. He tried to catch his mother's eyes but she was focused on the top rows. A few people where leaving the court room during the break. Draco did not have the same opportunity, as any Wizard or Witch under DeathEater activity suspicion they were handcuffed until the end of the trials. One hour and a half later, they came back and quickly required silence from the audience.
"Yes"
"Oh wicked of you, Potter" Malfoy murmured. He was not able to say more since Harry had picked up a rythme of in and out.
"Is the revelation from the Prophet true?"
~oOo~
After a few minutes of drilling, drooling and twisting with his tongue Harry heard a whisper from above.
During the game of Truth or Dare, he had been dared to kiss Malfoy by Seamus Finnigan, the Irish boy was looking too smug, maybe hoping to have some fight or for one of them to back done. The latest was not bound to happen anytime soon. Both boys, despite their truce were too happy to compete one against the other. And that's with ferocity that Harry crashed his lips against Malfoy's. The tongues were fighting for dominance and soon the audience was forgotten, both boys too deep in the kiss to mind.
Leaving in small groups the Room of Requirement, Harry was planning on going for a little trip in the castle. He decided to stay a bit longer and wished good night to Ron, Hermione and the other students. Alone in the room he picked the parchment in his pocket and read it.
Every time he saw some green eyes on people, the fear and look on Potter's face instantly come back.
He spun the bottle that landed on Ron. With a grin he asked for the first time "Truth or Dare?" Taking two seconds to think Ron asked for a dare.
"Perfect" Harry was beaming. If they managed to have a certain Slytherin on board he might have the opportunity he was looking for.
Harry smiled with a savage grin "I thought you wanted to see my tongue skills, I will only grant you my tongue Malfoy"
Without wasting more time, Harry took the quill used by Draco during the game to write down a reply.
oOoOo
The next day was dedicated to his mother's past activities and support. She was there because she had open her house to the Dark Lord himself, she did not report her sister to the Aurors and held hostages on her grounds. After a few testimonies stating that she never had any DeathEater activity, that her support for her husband was purely to protect the family bond, one person in the audience stood up. Potter, the Saviour of the Wizarding World himself, was going to testify in a case. From what he heard in the jails of the Ministry of Magic, that did not happen before. All the heads were turning in his direction, a few whispers heard. A quick glance at Granger revealed that this contribution was not really anticipated. Potter took place at the witness spot and that's when it happened again.
Malfoy got red from envy to start again and out of anger from the nickname... Blondie... Even Blaise would not have dared. He opened his mouth to replicate when he saw Harry going down on him again.
Harry went quickly to the showers, he had shaken the hands of all his teammates that wanted to congratulate him for his bolt move. He just wanted to be alone and take a well deserved hot shower. Alone in the shower cubicle, he washed off the sweat and some dirt he got during the game. He was very pleased with the match and how it went. Deciding to treat himself well, he let he rush of adrenaline due to his last move affect his body. He decided to have a quick wank in the shower. He was close to the release when he heard a door opening and footsteps outside. Suddenly a wave of peppermint scent went through the showers and that triggered the orgasm from Harry. Peering through a little hole on the door he saw the back of a well known student going back to the locker room. The scent faded quickly after the blond hair and slim body disappeared.
At ten thirty his mother and he were ready by the fireplace. A special Floo Network arrangement had been made to go from the Manor directly to the station and then to escort Narcissa back to the Manor. Draco was satisfied that they let his mother come to his final departure to the school. However he was apprehensive of the reactions from the other persons there. The presence of the Auror turned out to be an advantage considering their situation. Once the wizard was there they quickly went to the fireplace and shouted “Platform 9 ¾”. The three of them were wearing Wizarding cloaks. Some swirls later, they arrived in front of the Hogwarts Express that was due to leave at eleven. Kissing his mother goodbye, Draco did not wander long on the platform. He preferred to avoid as much as possible to face the other students now. The advantage of his early arrival was that he found an empty compartment right away. It seems that this strategy had been chosen by most of the Slytherins, and soon Pansy and Blaise were with him. They closed the door, magically locked it, and made small talks. Draco glanced at the platform, the train should take off in a few seconds now but some students were still chatting with their family and friends.
asked Pansy.
A few officials came to pick him and accompany him till the cells where he had spent the last month. The next day will be dedicated to his actions. He already knew that several people had attested of his behavior at school. They had received some advice from a lawyer that informed them that some memories and testimonies had been collected from former DeathEaters themselves and students.
"Malfoy.." managed to say Harry in a whisper, trying to lift his own pyjamas.
"I hope Malfoy will still want to play, I want to have at least a minimum of competition on the pitch"
"Don't worry, Potter, I will still be able to kick your ass and grab the Snitch in front of you"
"Great idea Harry"
"So it belonged to Malfoy's shampoo..." thought Harry astounded.
Harry did not waste time to kiss Malfoy collarbone, then slided below the blond to kiss his pecs and then nipples. Pushing him they switched positions and Harry on top of Malfoy stared at him in awe while using his hands to remove the last clothe off.
"I said more Scarhead.. please" he added to ensure Harry would not flee right now. He was sporting the hardest erection of his life. He did not want the Gryffondor to change his mind right now.
The shocked expression of Malfoy's face was sufficient to made him do a proposal.
Once again a wave of surprise went through the audience when Potter stood up after Shaklebolt asked if anybody would want to add anything. Draco stared at him. He was not able to look away and concentrate on the emerald green eye that were now directed towards the Minister.
"I have a little request for both of you. I want to throw a party with all the Eight Years included. I just want to be able to play Truth or Dare with someone and I think it will be best if there are other students as well. I think I can manage to have some Butterbeer and even Firewhisky from the house elves. Are you in ? Everybody seem to like you so I hoped you would not have any trouble gathering people from other Houses."
From now on Draco would be careful not to walk in the castle alone. That thought was depressing but as he was not allowed to repost he had no other choices.
Firewhisky, Butterbeer, special Party Drinks from Weasleys' Wheezes Wizards shop, the table of the Eighth Years common room was full of drinks and glasses. Soon the students returning to complete their education were drinking to forget, to get along and to play some silly, stupid but so funny games. Harry was among them. Returning to the castle, his true home, has not been an easy path. Memories often came back to him during the nightmares, the Battle, the persons who should be there with them but were dead. Ron and Hermione had returned as well to obtain their NEWTs, hopefully, at the end of the year.
Draco froze, Harry thought for a second that he had said the wrong thing until Draco started to move faster than before. With his wand he removed all the remaining clothes and gave Harry the most amazing smile he had ever seen. They rub onto each other for a while before Draco's hand came lower. He took both hard and leaking cocks and moaning they both came. Once Draco recover his breath he murmured "I might not be indifferent to your charms as well, Potter".
“Room 6 : Potter / Malfoy”.
The two first hours were dedicated to the listing of all his charges and proofs of wrongdoings. He listened to his behavior expressed from Longbottom's point of view and realized that it was not only child play but real harassment. People feared him while at school. Some DeathEater attested Draco's pride when compared to his father, that Draco really was a mini Lucius that wanted power and was happy to comply with tasks. In the audience he saw her mother, with an Auror at her side. She had managed to come, but Draco was afraid she would only witness her son be sent to jail. After a small break for lunch when Draco had not been able to eat anything, they resumed the trial with the details of his own interview. The relatively calm and wealthy childhood with his parents, his behaviors in Hogwarts, the good grades and the way he interacted with students. They also mentioned his doubts and panic when facing an impossible task : killing Dumbledore. Finally they also reported the reluctance towards the movement at the end. It was a summary of a boy who was proud of who he was but too coward to finally act upon his beliefs.
In the Great Hall the students were chatting and eating breakfast when the owls arrived. Students received news and packages from their families. Hermione looked up and spotted the owl meant to deliver the Daily Prophet. She gave it a little bit of water and the bird took off. Harry had a quick look at the front page as usual and froze on the spot. It was a massive picture of Draco Malfoy, taken after his trial, with a big headline "
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco woke up early on the day in was due to the train station to go back to Hogwarts. He did not sleep well this night. However when Draco reflected on his summer time, maybe what was to come was best. The summer had been horrid. First, his mother and he were alone in the large mansion. They were not used to such loneliness. The departure of the Dark Lord and his minions were obviously great news, but the fact that Narcissa was compelled to stay at home and that no visitors seemed to want to come was depressing. His father absence was heavy on the mood. They did not get the permission yet to visit him in Azkaban. Draco did not know if he looked forward to be able to see his father again or if he was relieved to have an excuse not to go to the Wizarding Prison. They could send him two owls a week, and the letters were checked.
oOoOo
Heated by the memory, he found himself tugging at his bottom to free his semi-hard cock. He closed his fist around his penis and slowly began up and down movements. He heard a ruffle from the other bed and the awareness that Malfoy was just here, a few meters away, was sufficient to get him fully hard. He was so concentrated reliving the kiss that he did not catch the opening of the curtains noise nor the footsteps. He almost screamed when a half naked Malfoy opened his curtains standing by the bedpost. His almost white torso free of clothes and the bottom covered by silk pyjamas.
"Good! As announced our intention was to play Truth or Dare. To keep a little challenge and interest we will provide you with legal and less powerful version of Veritaserum in order to ensure no cheating during the Truth questions." Clarified Dean.
*. Draco opened the book and saw a lot of information, spell work instructions, pictures of wounds. He took it in his arm and went back to his table. Pansy frowned but said nothing. That was the point of having Slytherin friends; they observed, knew but did not raise any questions.
The door of their dorms opened and Granger’s head popped in. Her eyes quickly scanned the room. She was obviously looking for Potter. With a sign of his head Draco indicated the bathroom. Granger entered the room.
It landed on a few more students before they were all calling it a night.
Harry felt the tingle in his body before replying automatically "Treacle tart" he saw a few students giggling, Draco was rolling his eyes and for the last two Harry just looked at him in his grey eyes when he said "Broomstick handle and Peppermint".  It wasn't a real revelation as the majority of the students had no idea to whom it could be related but three of them opened their mouth just to shut them after, Zabini, Parkinson whose smile was even bigger and obviously Draco. Harry took the bottle to spin it and after several rounds it landed on Draco. A quick grin appeared on Harry's face before asking "Truth or Dare". Draco considered both options for a minute, when Zabini coughed he looked up and required a Dare. A lot of ideas came to Harry's mind from kissing him to strip tease but he mostly didn't want to embarrass Draco so he found the perfect solution to check something.
“—Nothing like that Ernie,” Harry said quickly. Ernie raised his eyebrows.
It takes several drinks, but eventually Draco feels the adrenaline start to fade. He is surprised to find that he is hungry again, so when Greg bids them goodnight after an hour of idle chatting, Draco decides to make a snack. Feeling lazy, he just makes toast and he hopes it will be enough to take the edge off of his hunger.
“Unless you’re scared,” he says. He hopes that Massi will take the bait. Draco will feel better about the whole thing if Harry is at least involved. There is still a knot of disgust in the pit of Draco’s stomach, but if Harry is there, Draco feels much more like he they will be able to pull this off. Even if the this in question is Massi.
“Blaise and I will go again,” Pansy said, pushing herself up from the table. “Although I’m starting to think you all invited us here just for this purpose.”
“It’s definitely from Oliver,” Draco says. “I gave him these coordinates when we first started dating. If you could call it dating.” Draco is no longer sure he would call it that. The only dates they ever had were here in the house, when Draco would cook dinner or they would order take away. But he supposes that was all that Oliver could do. He sighs and Greg squeezes his shoulder.
“Good,” Hermione said. “Now walk.” Harry did. Or, at least, he tried to. It was much harder than either of them had made it look. Hermione sighed. “We probably should have had you practicing in these earlier.”
“Ok, by all the details, I guess I mean all the pertinent details.”
“Well,” Hermione said, putting her knife and fork deliberately next to her plate. “It can’t have disappeared forever. The Room probably just moved it to some sort of storage location.”
will be trained for situations like this. He jolly well hopes so, or he fears he will never sleep comfortably again.
“The socratic method? At a time like this?” Draco asked. He wasn’t sure but he thought he saw Dumbledore’s mouth twitch in amusement.
“Hermione,” Harry said firmly. “If Dumbledore told me to wear it for protection, I’m going to wear it for protection.”
“I thought that was what you wanted.”
“Mostly,” Ron said. “All the skin is gone, but the bones are there.”
“Can we come?” Seamus asked.
“Perfect,” Draco says. “Let’s go get Greg some shoes!”
“Don’t you three dare leave,” Croaker calls behind him. And then the door to his office slams shut and locks itself. Harry feels for a fleeting moment like he is back at Hogwarts and he, Ron and Hermione are in trouble in Dumbledore’s office. But instead it’s Parkinson and Malfoy and none of them is in trouble per se. Except perhaps Malfoy.
“Never said I wasn’t.”
He groans and spits his toothpaste out. He’s going to have to share his bed with Harry. And it’s going to be awkward. Oh, they’ll pretend that everything is fine, but Draco knows that he will be painfully aware of every movement either of them makes. He wishes now that he had agreed to the nightcap, even though he knows he’s had more than enough alcohol for the day.
“Shit, I should bring him back here,” Harry says. He jumps up from the couch. “I’ll be back.”
“Draco Malfoy,” Harry says before Draco can say anything else. “Will you be my top secret, most certainly frowned upon by the Ministry boyfriend?”
He realizes, with another painful jolt of his heart, that it’s true.
“Don’t be daft. You’re lovely.”
“So be on the watch for any gossip magazine witches.”
“But I think this whole Simmy-whatsit conspiracy has you two rather paranoid.”
“Right, boss,” Luca says, saluting him. “We will be model employees today.” Draco does not point out that he is not their boss, because every time he does that, they ignore his protests anyway. In their mind he is the assistant manager, although no one officially holds that position.
“For fucking killing both of us.” Dumbledore by this point had taken several steps backward and seemed content to let them talk it through, just the two of them.
a matchmaker after all.
“Oh,” Hermione said. She sat up, and therefore away from him, in her surprise.
“Eh,” Seamus said, joining the conversation. “Be glad it’s while we’re still young. Can you imagine being Dumbledore’s age and wondering why no one had thought this up earlier?” All five boys reflected on this for a moment.
Harry picked up the silver potion and sniffed it. He wrinkled his nose and
“Doubt it,” Greg said listlessly.
“Thanks, Dobby,” Harry said, his ears burning. He made his way back over to his seat.
“Come on,” he says. “Let’s finish getting dressed and join the party.” Draco nods even though all he wants to do is stay here, alone with Harry, and delight in the fact that their fake relationship might not be as fake as he had previously thought. He wants to nail down exactly what Potter means when he says that Draco does have him. But Harry is right. This is a party and they need to go and socialize and keep up their cover that might not be a cover after all.
“I’m glad she found the coffee,” Draco says. He crosses the room to the coffee pot and reaches for it before realizing he doesn’t know where any of the glassware is. Potter notices his hesitation and raises his wand. A cupboard to Draco’s right opens and two mugs fly out of it, landing with a soft clink on the counter next to the coffee. “Cheers.” Draco pours two full mugs and carries one over to Potter who accepts it gratefully.
“Right.” Potter stares at a knot on the table, a frown etched into his forehead. He seems reluctant to meet Draco’s eye. Draco lets the silence hang, waiting for Potter to break it, but after a minute, it becomes apparent that Potter is going to do no such thing. It’s clear Potter still doesn’t like him, and though Draco would rather flee the house and drop Potter/Pike as a client, he’s a professional and he’s going to act like it. A job is a job, after all, and Potter had hired him. So Draco places his briefcase on the table.
“No? Well, either way, I’m going to wait out here. Come out once you’ve got the first things on.”
“Is it supposed to be this difficult?” he asked. Hermione frowned down at the book in front of her.
“I meant it.” Draco doesn’t know what to say to this so he just nods awkwardly and starts to look around the room. Nothing jumps out at him.
But Harry doesn’t play along. Instead, he pulls his wand out and taps his bunk, muttering something that Draco can’t hear. Then he climbs into his bunk, disappearing from Draco’s view.
“What?”
“It's not bloody semantics. You agreed to go out with me. Plus, you said just the other day that we were dating.”
Hermione found herself tending bar with Blaise and Pansy, marveling at the fact that she was voluntarily spending time with Pansy Parkinson. Pansy and Blaise were keeping up a steady stream of commentary on a variety topics, not least of all was what the sundry members of the school were getting up to in their different parts of the room. Hermione had been tuning in and out of their conversation, depending on what interested her.
“You,” Pansy says. “Are not going to do anything, aside from tell me any other details that you have about her disappearance. Potter, McLaggen and I will likely go and get her back.”
All of a sudden, he catches a flash of movement out of the corner of his eye and acts without thinking, throwing himself in front of Draco, and putting up a shield charm as he does. All heads turn as the front window of the restaurant shatters. He feels rather than sees a stunning spell hit his shield and ricochet across the restaurant. An unfortunate patron slumps in her chair. He pulls Malfoy down, throwing up another shield in front of the both of them. Harry gestures for Malfoy to head towards the back of the restaurant, but Malfoy is immobile with either shock or fear, or perhaps a combination of the two.
“I’m sorry,” he says. Ron looks up at him.
“Care to spend it with me?” Harry asks, raising his eyebrows expectantly. Draco shrugs.
“Yes, I think he’s been trying to get you two to get together for years.”
“Sure it is.” He frowns and leans forward across the table towards her. It takes every ounce of her self control not to jerk backwards.
“Let’s.”
“But people might miss
“Keep your voice down,” Seamus hissed. “They are
“Yes.”
“Mine too, now that I think of it.” Potter looks as though he is going to say something, but then stops himself and instead picks up his wine glass and, seeing there is not much left in it, drains it. He stands.
“I’m pretty sure you would hex my balls off if I did, what, seeing as you’re a hit wizard and all.” Pansy stiffens in surprise and Greg looks pleadingly at her. “Please don’t confund me again.”
“Why not?” And he leads him through the crowd again.
“There is nothing more important than this right now,” he insists.
“I could do it,” Draco said in a small voice. “And complete my task.”
“Gemino,” he said. A perfect copy of the Cup appeared next to it on the desk. Harry reached out and picked up the genuine Cup before they had a chance to confuse the two. It was cold to the touch, and felt the way the locket had - like there was something alive about it. Draco carried the copy back to the bookshelf and placed it on the shelf before closing the grille again.
“Hannah,” Malfoy protests. “He was a big part of my life for almost a year, and now he’s fucking dead.”
The door handle rattles again and another thrill of excitement goes through Draco. The pressure on his cock increases as Harry sucks harder and though he wants this to last longer, his orgasm has other ideas. It crashes over him and he bites his lower lip to stop himself from crying out. He grips the boxes behind him as his knees go weak. Harry swallows it all down and then slowly pulls his mouth off of Draco. He grins up at him, the look on his face a strange mix of mischievous and affectionate. Draco’s heart melts, the way that it always does when Harry looks at him like this.
“Why you’re working with us.” Pansy sighs.
“No, but that is a very Luna thing to do.”
“Haven’t told me what?” Draco asked, but Snape didn’t answer him, and instead continued to stare at Harry. Draco turned to look at him too and Harry squirmed under their combined gazes.
“No.”
Harry watched while Hermione raised and both Blaise and Draco decided to call her on it. Blaise won the round with triple aces, much to Draco’s displeasure.
“Make another one?”
“What?”
“Fine. We’ll finish eating and go to the Cooler under Fortescue’s.”
“You have to be seen with me on a daily basis,” Harry replies. “That’s much worse.”
“Oh, it’s a big fucking deal,” Parkinson says. “It’s
HALLOWEEN MASSACRE: HUNDREDS DEAD AT MUGGLE AMUSEMENT PARK; DARK MARK SEEN IN SKY; PROMINENT AUROR INJURED
“Fine,” he says. “You’re free to go.” He waves toward the door. Draco stands and turns to leave. He stops before leaving the room.
“Maybe?”
“Figured what out?”
The blond gives a small nod. Hannah turns her head to look at Harry again, who feels himself blush crimson. “So what are you mooning over Wood for?”
“How did you know that?”
As he nears it, he realizes that there is a watch sitting on top of it. And it is a watch he recognizes. He breathes in sharply. It’s Oliver’s watch. He hasn’t seen Oliver since around the time he started at Flourish and Blotts, but he would know that watch face anywhere. The number of times he had lain in Oliver’s arms, playing idly with the dials and watching the planets move about the face. He takes a step backward. He does not know why Oliver has seemingly sent him a mysterious package, but the year spent trapped in Malfoy Manor with the (other) Death Eaters has made him wary, even now, almost ten years on.
“You say that, but look.” Draco gestures at the dappled light and the - well, mostly brown - river. “Just look at that bridge.”
“That can go,” Potter says dismissively, waving his hand dismissively in the direction of the tapestry. “They’re not my family,” he continues at Draco’s raised eyebrow
“Yes,” Draco said. “Can you take them to the room at the end of this corridor?” Dobby bowed and snapped his fingers. The tables vanished. Harry frowned and lowered his wand.
Seamus
“Did you miss me?” He asked and then cursed his idiocy as Pansy snorted in laughter.
“He has an embroidered, purple Simurgh on his sleeve.”
“You didn’t always know that you wanted to be the savior of the wizard in world?” He asks. Potter gives short bark of laughter, behind which Draco can hear an aggrieved tone.
“Do you call all your friends by their last name,
“Then I need to get home.”
“And who do we have here?” the other vampire asks as she reaches Draco. She places a hand on his shoulder. It is cold.
“Family comes first. Your happiness comes before anything.” He couldn’t help it. The tears spilled out of his eyes and made tracks down his face before he could stop them. “Oh, darling.” And then she swept him into her arms the way she used to when he was small. As he cried, she rubbed circles into his back and pressed kisses to the top of his head.
“‘Course you lot were there,” Draco says suddenly.
“It has,” Draco agrees. “How have you been?” Seamus is Draco’s account manager at Ashe bank, one of the smaller Wizarding banks that had popped up after Harry, Ron and Hermione had broken into, and subsequently out of, Gringotts during the war. Ashe’s had been the first bank that would accept Draco as a client, in part because Seamus had taken a chance on him. Over the months of working through mortgage paperwork, they had become friends. In fact, Seamus was the first guest Draco had ever had over at his house for dinner. (Hannah had been the second, while they planned the Leaky Cauldron makeover.)
“The fuck?”
“You call everyone else by their first names.”
“Make something for me!” Blaise cried. “I want tequila.” Draco nodded and turned back to the shelves. He pulled down more bottles. Then, realizing that his bar top was becoming cluttered, put a few of the other bottles back. A flurry of measuring later, and he placed a drink in front of Blaise.
“‘Mione, I need to go. Malfoy’s trying to leave… At least two weeks you said? Fuck. Ok.” Potter stabs the end call button and shoves the phone back into his pocket. He stares at Draco as if trying to find the right words to say. Draco closes his briefcase and snaps the clasps shut. The click that they make echoes around the dining room.
“Right,” Draco says. “So who knows Potter is an Unspeakable?”
“Winola Swinn turned up on her parents’ doorstep this morning, disoriented but unharmed.”
“You were? What do you mean almost?” Potter shrugs.
“I suppose.” She didn’t really want to go back there, but they were rather short on options. Then inspiration hit. “What about the Room of Requirement?” Blaise slapped a hand to his forehead.
“No, cousin, I think not,” came a voice from the other end of the corridor. Blaise and Hermione looked up to see an auror in full battle regalia coming towards them. Hermione recognized her, though she wasn’t sure Blaise did, so she leaned over and whispered,
“Yes. Exactly.”
“I believe it we were part way through doing this,” Draco said. He snaked a hand around to the back of Harry’s head and pressed their lips together. Harry thought about making a witty retort, but figured that would probably waste time, so instead he just responded by slipping his tongue into Draco’s mouth.
“I don’t think that will go over well.”
“I agree with Potter,” Cormac says.
“No,” Harry said. “It’s not.”
“Do you know what’s going to happen to the team once Draco’s trained?” Harry asks in order to diffuse the situation. “Has Dempsey talked to you about that?”
“For these first exercises, I would like you to resist the veritaserum if you can.” Draco nods. His mouth is dry. “And don’t worry if you don’t get it on your first try, or even on your second or third. It requires a lot of practice before most people are able to mislead or lie under its influence. For this, we will pretend that you have been captured by a rogue witch, who wants to know if you are a Ministry employee. You must try to keep your cover intact. Ready?”
“They would probably just think we were friends,” Harry protested.
“Of course,” McLaggen says. “Who doesn’t?” Harry doesn’t point out that Muggle children don’t. What’s the point of saying that now?
“Not knowing you were the master of death?”
“Because it’s nighttime?” Harry asked.
“I’m sorry,” Massi says quickly. “A friend of ours informed us yesterday that Harry works for the Ministry.”
“At least you don’t try to crash any of the photos à la Luca and Joe.”
“Harry,” Hermione said briskly. “We’re wizards. Of course it can.” Harry wanted to ask more questions, but Draco was looking at him with a small frown on his face, so he decided to save them until later. Plus, he was getting ahead of himself. Before they could even
“You wound me. It was a dance between friends.”
“Go on,” Harry said. He reached up with one hand and attempted to wipe the remnants of the tears off of his face. His sleeve came away sodden.
“Merry Christmas, Draco,” she said, perching next to Draco on the arm of his chair. She handed him the parcel and then she and Harry watched as Draco opened it.
all of Draco’s new clothes from Bertie. Harry must see Draco’s amazement, because he chuckles. “Do you like it?” he asks.
“-Sit down McLaggen,” Harry snaps. “Draco has a point.”
“A wizard,” Harry says. “I’m sure lots of wizards haven’t been to the cinema. Not everyone is comfortable with muggle things.”
“Christmas lunch at my parents’ house,” the pale, blond, pointy one said.
“Are you saying we should take advantage of this privacy by making out?” Draco asked, crossing the room to stand in front of Harry.
“I won,” Ron said.
This, of course, sends him down the mental rabbit hole of what he would do if Draco were kidnapped. He had told Pansy he would be fine, but would he? Shit. He loves Hermione like a sister, but that’s nothing compared to the depth of feeling that he has for Draco. It has only been five months, give or take a few days, but he is starting to think that Draco might be
“Literally, whatever’s open.” Ron nods and picks up the half full bottle of red that’s sitting on the counter near the sink. He walks over to a cabinet and pulls down two stemless wine glasses before uncorking the bottle and pouring two heavy pours of wine. He hands one of the glasses to Draco.
“Possibly.” Draco sighed and took Harry’s hand.
“But there is,” Massi says again. “I’m not allowed to like you.”
“Ok,” she says finally. “I am going to go to my ‘boss’,” and here she uses air quotes. “And tell him that I’m under the weather. Then we’re going to every single real estate agent on this map.”
“I see your point.”
In the time that they had been playing, many of the other students from their class had filed up the stairs, looking tired but generally pleased with themselves. Most people had stopped by to grab sandwiches and a few had stayed to watch their match, including Seamus and Neville.
“Would these be your plans to bring down the Dark Lord?”
“What can I do for you?” he asks.
Curious, he opened it. A blast of icy October air hit him as he looked out onto a never before seen balcony that now jutted out from the side of the castle. Perfect. Now he could be properly miserable. Although, he wasn’t too keen on being
“Ideally, it wouldn’t be in public,” he says quietly.
“We could change the entrance,” Harry shot back.
“Wonderful,” Pansy said. “Can I see it?” Draco held it out to her. She looked at it for a moment before shrugging. “It’s a cup.”
. That’s part of the problem. But I’ve been ignoring the fact that we’re from such different backgrounds. That we’re so ideologically diverse. That-”
“I’m sorry?”
“Then what are they doing?” he asked. When Hermione continued to giggle into her hands, apprehension dawned. “Oh,” was all he said.
“What? No.” Blaise sat up quickly, no longer nonchalant. Pansy laughed.
be secret agents now.”
Draco's weekend so to speak is on Sunday and Monday, so he just nods wearily. He decides then that his evening run is not happening. He is too damn tired.
“I have already invited him to the castle and he has graciously accepted my invitation. Between us, I think that brazen attack on the theme park the other day spooked him. He is scheduled to arrive tomorrow and will be brought up to speed on your sixth year project. It will continue on as before and I look forward to hearing about the results. Severus tells me this year’s batches look particularly promising.” Hermione sat up straighter at this and looked pleased with herself.
He was exceedingly distracted at dinner. He kept catching a certain Hufflepuff’s eye and blushing. He couldn’t help himself. Last night had been rather spectacular, perhaps because for one of the first times in Seamus’s school career, there had been a bed, rather than a broom closet or a shower or a dark corner. And though Justin always seemed timid in public, once they found themselves alone, things really took off. Those things generally being clothes.
“I knew I liked him.”
“And you have agreed to work for us?” Hermione asks Malfoy. Malfoy’s eyebrows rise in surprise.
official.
“Don’t mention it. That’s what potions partners do for each other,” he said. She laughed and lifted his arm up to make him twirl her again.
“Mr. Potter?”
“Sounds good,” Harry says, slowly turning back to look at Draco. His tone is nonchalant, but Draco thinks Potter’s irritation is fading nonetheless.
“You were the one kissing me earlier.”
“Don’t fucking lie to me.”
“Speak for yourself.” But there is a smirk on Malfoy’s face and a sparkle in his eye that tells Harry he is kidding. Perhaps this wining and dining is going better than he thought. But it should be going well, Harry supposes. After all, he
“Well, the spell needs something to latch onto,” Hermione explained. Draco scowled.
“Really,” he croaked. She sighed and looked away in disappointment and honestly, that was worse.
“You could go home for Christmas and inspect the cup,” Blaise suggested.
were you thinking?”
“How?”
“Or our dorms. If everyone’s here, no one will be there.” Draco made a face to indicate he did not want to do that. “Or we could just stay here in this corner and keep our hands off of each other.” Draco sighed.
“-Stop,” Hermione said, reaching out to grab one of his hands before he snatched it away. “I was just surprised.”
“Is everything alright in here?” he asked. They nodded in unison. “Good. I was instructed by Dumbledore to check on all of my students to make sure they were coping after this morning’s news.” He seemed less than pleased by this predicament.
“Mm, this place near my house,” Potter says. He wipes an apologetic hand across his mouth. “It’s called Made in China.” Draco’s eyes widen in surprise and delight. He knows exactly the restaurant that Potter is talking about. Oddly enough, he had gone there with Ian. The food had been delicious and he has been trying to find an excuse to drag Greg to dinner there, but Greg is somewhat wary of the muggle world and only ventures out when he has good reason to. Draco has tried to point out that really delicious food
“Oh Circe, you two,” Draco said. He slapped a hand to his forehead.
“Wait, you did actually take the mark?” Potter asks. Draco grits his teeth.
He’d found himself too. Or, rather Ghost Harry had visited Draco at Malfoy Manor. As his parents had supported He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, he had been allowed to stay under house arrest. He stayed huddled in his room, guarded by his own personal dementor, unsure if the visits from Ghost Harry made him feel better or worse. When Draco left, his other self had been constantly repeating that he’d failed Harry and there had been nothing he could do to get him to stop.
“Thank you, sir, but what is it?”
“Yes, he is. Just look at Oliver.” Pansy takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly.
“In a minute.” He closed his eyes again and Harry took the hint. He stood up and walked over to the others.
“We have not discussed this with them specifically,” Snape said slowly. “Though I’m sure the thought has crossed Draco’s mind.”
“Yes, I can see that. But shots of what?”
“Draco, darling,” Pansy says. “If you’re going to be a top secret, higher up approved Unspeakable, I’m not going to be the one to blow your cover. Even within the Ministry. I’m sure if Dempsey needs to know, she will know.”
“McLaggen,” he said as he drew close. Cormac looked up, surprised. Seamus crooked a finger at him, beckoning him away. “Come dance.” Hermione looked up at Seamus with grateful eyes. Cormac considered him for a moment before he slid out of the booth and stood up.
“He also asked why I was spending so much time with Pansy.”
” The Riddle-Harry’s eyes flashed a brighter red for a moment and he tossed his hair, looking more bewitching and also more cruel than the real Harry ever had.
“Harry,” Hermione hissed. “What are you doing here?” Harry shrugged.
“Do you think you can ask your friend here to make me two old fashioneds?”
And then they heard the Derek, the anthropomorphized niffler portrait that guarded their room, squeal. They broke apart quickly.
“Yes. I’ve already sat down. So how about it?”
“Which is why he had an erection?” Snape asked.
“Duh,” Draco added. “Merlin, you’re thick sometimes, Potter.” Harry stuck his tongue out at the blond and Hermione rolled her eyes at the pair of them. She wondered how long it was going to take before the entire school caught on to the fact that they were not only friends, but an item. The way they were acting, it would not be long. She just hoped their relationship wouldn't leak to the press or the outside world at all. She couldn’t imagine that it would go well if it did.
“Because it’s bound to turn into something more than just sex.”
“Why are you sorry?” he asked.
“Yes.”
“Hey, can you hear me?”
“What?”
“How did you know about that passage?” Justin asked as Harry came through the opening that lead to the tunnel.
“I didn’t do it on purpose,” Harry snapped. He glared at Snape with as much dignity as he could muster sitting on the couch with no trousers on.
“Circe, Cormac. Do you want my help or not? May I remind you, I just brought you onto the most high profile task force in the DMLEHS.”
“Who? No. I meant Conan the Barbarian.”
“I get it,” Justin said. His tone was bitter. “You’ll tell Seamus, but you can’t tell me.”
“Now obviously I can’t tell you why I’m working at the bookstore, but don’t worry, it has nothing to do with you.”
“Why? Because I invented it and it has been called nothing short of miraculous. Obviously.”
She is still seething about the fact that Wood managed to get past her team and steal that book. She is even more mad about the fact that she can’t question the coward about it. Her muscles still vibrate from the adrenaline, even though it was several hours ago now, and she fights the urge to bounce on the balls of her feet. This is neither the time nor place to appear antsy.
“If you’re sure,” the General had said and Pansy had nodded. And that had been that.
“We’re ok,” Harry says.
“What is it?” Harry asks. Draco shakes his head and makes a beeline for the side table.
None of them wanted to go back to their dorms, so they decided to go to the Room of Requirement, as there were no other house neutral places for them to all spend time together, barring classrooms.
“I take back my earlier comment,” Draco said.
“Of course not,” Blaise said, nodding.
chop up the snowdrops?” he asked.
“You got to go to the opening night of La Scala?” Hannah asks, awe in her voice. Draco nods, smiling. “That’s amazing. What was everyone wearing? Was it wonderful? I can only imagine it was wonderful.”
“This is wonderful,” Dumbledore said once they had showed him the two horcruxes on Boxing Day morning. He clasped his hands in front of his face in delight, throwing his deadened hand into sharp relief. “Well done.”
“Oh, don’t remind me of the basilisk,” Pansy moaned. “It was horrible enough as a skeleton.”
“Cheers,” Harry says, holding his glass out. Malfoy clinks his glass on Harry’s.
“I hate it when he’s right.” Pansy let out a long, angry sigh. “So what now then?”
“Neither of them are wearing what they came in,” Pansy said, pointing at the pair. “Are they?” Ron shook his head. “So I want to know: why are we?”
“Holy shit,” Draco said as Harry’s stag patronus charged around the room. Harry grinned. “No wonder that thing knocked me over.”
“I mean, I’ve stocked up on food,” Potter says, continuing on as if Draco hasn’t spoken. “And loo roll. Just in case. You know.” Here, Potter turns to look at Draco and Draco has to admit that he doesn’t know. “In case we go into quarantine.”
“They sound awful.”
“I know.”
“Right then,” Harry said. “We’ll see you in a bit.” He wrapped the cloak back around himself and Draco and they made their way back into the Honeydukes cellar.
Harry is out of the hot tub in a moment. He grabs Massi’s wand where he has left it next to the veritaserum and kneels next to Draco. He waves Massi’s wand over Draco and then frowns at the readout. Draco has a concussion, and his lower back is bruised but it is nothing that magic can’t fix. Though Harry is not going to attempt anything using someone else's wand.
Feedback is always appreciated :)
“Well, you know the rest.”
“That sounds nice,” he said. “Shall we?”
“Well, you seemed to enjoy last night?” Massi sounds suddenly unsure.
“Don’t be silly,” Pansy said. “I’ll do it.”
“Right then,” he said. “Let’s get cracking, shall we?”
“But what about the heat tracker on his house?” Draco asks. Beside him, Pansy gives a snort of laughter.
As soon as he’s through the curtain, Harry reaches out a hand and put it on Draco’s arm.
“You have no tact,” he said.
". Harry heard students whispering across the Hall. This news was obviously a scoop, at least for the vast majority of them, and widely unexpected. The rest of the article was a testimony from a foreign wizard telling the reporter the time they had this summer together. Glancing to the other side of the Great Hall, Harry quickly spotted the blond hair, Malfoy was reading carefully the article and when he put it down, his face was inscrutable. The same mask as usual was in place, he chatted with Blaise as if he wasn't aware that half of the Hall was either looking at him or talking about him.
Malfoy eyes lit up with an hungry look Harry has never seen before. He climbed on top of Harry and kissed him. It was not as agressive as during the game. Malfoy's lips were soft, parted and his tongue curious. Harry soon gathered his thoughts and dived in the kiss. Giving all he got, they had to part a few minutes later to breathe.
The game was on for more than one hour when the Snitch finally decided to show up. Harry spotted it just behind one of the other team's Beater and not letting it out of his sight, he slowly went towards it.  Malfoy took three seconds to understand what was happening and they flew together at full speed behind the small golden ball. It was as if time was frozen for the other students. Many younger ones had decided to come and see the older ones play, even if it was out of the championship. Harry and Malfoy were side-by-side, diving at the same time. It was as if they were connected and no one could predict who will take the final advantage over the other. After two minutes of the high-speed chase, Harry decided to climb on his broom when the Snitch rose instead of maneuver the broom and grabbed it in his palm. Losing his balance, he fell off the Firebolt and managed to catch the handle at last moment. Smiling, he sat on the broom and watched as colors came back on Malfoy's face. With a quick nod he seemed to acknowledge the defeat and managed even a sneer looking at the crowd that was shouting "Harry!". They both got down the pitch and the players went to the locker rooms.
On his way back to his desk to gather his school material, he saw a small bottle on Potter’s bedside table. He did not want to spy on him. Anything that could cause a fight between them was excluded from his mind. However he was curious of which potion Potter had to take. Coming nearer he saw the red label *Dreamless Sleep Potion*. Feeling uncomfortable by the discovery, Draco quickly took his bag and went to the eighth year common room. He was alone this early in the morning. As they did got a few homework from their first day, he picked his Herbology book and started to read the relevant chapter for the next lesson. His objective was to wait for Blaise and Pansy to avoid being all alone in the corridors. He was half through the chapter when they met. Other students were passing by and they joined the flow to the Great Hall. Nobody attacked them. When they were downstairs, however, he heard some insults that he assumed were meant for him.
Only Malfoy could still provide cheeky comments during foreplay. That was driving Harry crazy in a good sense, that made him feel normal for once. Malfoy would not cherrish him and glorify his 'Savior status' and that was exactly what he needed after the war.
"Actually... yes a lot"
Before Ron was able to answer, another voice, low and cold replied.
The journey went quickly and soon the sun was declining. No incident had occurred and soon the stress came back from the idea to mingle with the other students during their way back to the Castle. Lucky they were to find an empty carriage. Once in the entrance, the three of them went to the large doors and then into the Great Hall. Draco chose to sit at his usual spot, facing the other tables while Pansy and Blaise preferred to turn their back to the rest of the Hall. The room was filling up with students. Draco spotted some of his former classmates from his school year. People were happily chatting, except for the Golden Trio that Draco saw. Potter was also seating at his usual seat facing him; He seemed strained. Weasley and Granger did not seem to mind it. The Weasley girl was seating a few seats ahead. Maybe there was tension in between the couple.
In the dormitory two hours later, Harry was laying on the bed. Sobering every minutes passing without a drink, he was replaying the night in his mind. Despite all the fun he had during the party, the one memory that kept coming back was that kiss with Malfoy.
* Draco thought. He lied down on his bed and picked his Potions book. Potter was still in front of the door talking to Granger. Trying not to spy on them it was difficult not to hear their voices. They were chatting about the next days’ plans and if Harry was going to be okay. Draco shut his bed’s curtains and read for an hour before he got to sleep.
Potter went out of the bathroom looking a bit miserable. He was walking around as if he did not fit in there. A feeling Draco got accustomed to in the previous months. However, Draco would have thought that after the war, being the Saviour of the Wizarding World meant that Potter could act as if he owned the school. The reality could not be more different, Potter really hadn’t found his niche there.
New chapter, new emotion
"I thought I was here for your tongue skills Potter"
Second point that did not make his summer the best time was the community service. The tasks were not hard, they require a minimum of physical effort which was good compared to the emptiness of the manor’s life. He was even allowed to use a minimum of magic to lift heavy furniture or repair mistakes. The gloomiest point of the work was the interaction with the other wizards and witches. Most of them glanced at him as if they were waiting for him to shout and attack everyone on sight. Some of them hold looks of pure disgust. Finally he managed to find out two people that were indifferent with his family name and the reason he was there. It took most of his energy and time, but in the end he had finally the impression to have accomplished something meaningful.
"You only witnessed a small portion of my tongue skills Malfoy, wanna test them?" Saïd Harry when recovering from the fact that the Slytherin was not here to taunt him but apparently interested in reliving for real the scene of the common room.
"Truth"
The plates and dishes filled with delicious-looking food. Draco’s appetite was not so big but he enjoyed a few portions of roasted chicken with potatoes. Most students were looking as if a war did not happen here just a few months before. Yet, some Eighth years seemed to lack energy. That’s when Draco’s eyes crossed Potter’s. Probable fixing an empty space, Draco allowed himself to stare for a few seconds into these green eyes. The emotion connection came back like in the court room. He felt an unfamiliar sensation of dread. Potter’s apprehension was logical. Last time he was in this room he had faced his own death and fought the Dark Lord. Last time he was in this room he saw many of his friends and mentors dead bodies. Potter’s eyes were still on Draco’s but now he seemed to notice that they were staring at each other. A quick nod later, Potter resumed eating his meal.
"And here I thought you were here for my tongue skill.. something wrong blondie?"
Peering through the end of his curtains he saw Potters’ shut tight. Draco opened his bed and from the sounds he heard from the other boy’s bed, Potter was still asleep. Now on his feet, Draco took his wand, his clothes for the day and went to the bathroom. After a quick shower, he put the towel around his waist and looked into the mirror. Purple circles were clearly visible on his fair skin of the right jaw. Setting his wand against it he chanted the spell, careful not to wake up Potter with his incantations. Once done, nothing was noticeable on his skin.
Without any warning he took the Slytherin's cock in his right hand and squeezed. The feeling was strange but quite enjoyable. Having Malfoy at his mercy, voluntary, was an opportunity he was not going to waste.
"Dean, Seamus, can I have a word with you for a second ?"
A wave of approval as well as apprehension went through the students. It became clearer that it could lead to serious revelations. Everybody took a shot of the potion. They felt normal but they will test it soon enough.
On this day, after the last lesson Transfiguration, Draco chose to go to the library. The atmosphere of the common room was too odd for him. People were chatting, some playing and many of them already studying. They were acting as one big family and he did not fit in there, too much people despised him and even if they weren’t aggressive he could feel their eyes upon him. He knew he had to face his choices at one time, but doing it while trying to work was quite complicated. If it had been the Slytherin Common room he would have gone to his dorms to study. But with Potter’s presence probable, he preferred to avoid it. Pansy agreed to accompany him. Both of them were on a table in the back of the library. To finish his Charms essay he went to the relevant section. In between the numerous book regarding Charms he spotted one title that caught his attention *
Hearing his first name from Draco, said with calm and passion, sent a flow of desire into Harry who decided that he will probably spend the best night so far in the castle.
"I dare you to write a note to the person you love or fancy the most with some compliments in it. You have to write it down now and send it now".
For once, Draco thought that Weasley probably had the right reaction. Looking for his friends’ name he saw that Blaise was roomed with a Ravenclaw and Pansy with one of the Patil twins, the Gryffindor’s one. Both of them were looking at him and struck. Making a noncommittal shrug, Draco went to a sofa and sat down with his friends. Both of them seemed to have lost the ability to talk. The complaints and whispers were still high in the room regarding other room assignments. The Golden Trio had also sat down at the opposite site of the room. Looking around him he took notice of the common room decoration. It was a subtle mix of all the houses colours. Some of the emblems were interacting with each other’s. The first impression was calmness and cosiness. The room was bright and various styles of armchairs and sofas were distributed in the large room. Some bookshelves ornamented one wall and a few games were displayed on two tables at the back. Two corridors went from there with their row of doors that lead to the bedrooms. From where he sat he saw the room number 6 where he and Potter would be roommates.
“Fuck. Sorry, love, this was supposed to be a pint and a chat,” Miriam said, clearing his throat and dabbing at her eyes. He shook his head.
“Bit hard to grow anything when you’re a flaming poof, wouldn’t you say?” Draco arched an eyebrow.
“You’re beginning to sound like my father.” Rage was starting to simmer through his veins, and he felt a little more steady on his feet because of it. Weasley shrugged.
“Yes, you did.” Weasley said evenly, and this time Draco did throw up, racing to the bin at the end of the alley. He allowed a passing fantasy that when he turned around, Weasley would be gone-- but when he finally finished retching up his morning coffee, the gangly redhead was still there, unmoving. Draco walked shakily back, pulling out his handkerchief to wipe his face.
He was shocked into staring at her.
“I know what to do. Tell them we’ll take it.” The words came out before he knew it, and she arched an eyebrow.
He smiled into the cherry blossom paste he was blending, carefully piping it into the buttery nests. She was the only one allowed communication (his rules), and he adored her even more than he had at age seven, hands in her skirts and stealing her canapes.
Mr. Iida watched her go, turning to Draco a few silent moments after her footsteps left their range.
“Why don’t you?” Draco said carelessly.
His mother. She hadn’t been the happiest when he’d first started working here, but at least it was the best in London, she’d said, sighing. He almost pitied her pride, except it hid in the corners of his heart just as fierce.
“Yes to all of it Miriam. I spent six months awaiting my own trial in that prison, and I would honestly kill myself before I set foot in it again.” Draco shuddered, straightening his back.
“Am I missing something?” he said, and she shot the messy-haired man a blistering look.
“Okay wait, so why weren’t you arrested too? If your father-- I don’t understand, what about your mother?”
Draco thought his eyes might fall out of their sockets. Maybe there was some kind of camera, some Skeeteresque reporter ready to jump out and capture his surprise on film. He narrowed his eyes.
“Did you know I left?”
“Because they’re paying enough to afford Papa’s Live-In, that’s why!”
Draco winced.
“I don’t know what you’re up to, my bizarre pointy angel, but I’ll trust you. You’re sure, yeah?”
Just then, Mr. Iida walked in, and the anxiety was lost as the shop whirred to life, morning rush of pastry giving way to afternoon tea cakes, and evening bread rush, and by the time he turned the placard over he finally felt he could think without vomiting.
The next morning he was up before dawn, London barely swirling to life around him. He loved this time of day, sky barely light, ears full of the sounds of busses rumbling to life and sleepy binmen hacking with laughter. It was a time where barely anybody took a moment to notice the posh blond with perfect posture picking his way through the streets.
“I’ll see you around, Potter. You sounded divine, Miriam, as always.” Draco gathered up his dignity like a shroud and glided out the door.
“I still can’t believe you three did that,” Draco said with a shake of his head. “Incredible. I had no idea.”
“Nah,” Seamus said. “I just have the magic Cormac touch.” Justin wasn’t sure this really made it better. Perhaps he should worry more about the fact that Cormac was in the same house as Seamus and that he lived just a short walk down the corridor from Seamus. Or however the Gryffindor dorms were laid out.
“Like you love Potter?”
“-Oh save me the sanctimonious bullshit, Potter. You didn't tell me because you were thinking with your dick.” Harry says nothing, but presses his mouth into a thin line. Malfoy is right, of course, but Harry is not about to admit it. Malfoy glares at him again and then crosses his arms and slumps back into his chair, all the fight going out of him. Harry takes a deep breath.
angry with Draco if he could still find him funny, right?
“What?” Draco pulls back sharply and stares at Massi. He does his utmost to sound shocked by this. “You can’t be fucking serious.”
“Do I ever? That was possibly the hardest potions challenge he ever gave us. And possibly the only one that I beat you at that year.”
“I can do it,” Pansy says.
“Yes,” she said again.
It was Harry who came first, leaning heavily on Draco though not pausing in his ministrations even as his body shuddered in pleasure. Draco climaxed a moment later, biting his lip to keep as quiet as he could. Harry smiled at the soft almost mewling sound Draco made as he orgasmed. When he was done, they stood panting, still pressed together.
“What’s that?” Hermione asked, looking up at him.
“Alright, Dobby,” Hermione said. “Shall we?” Dobby reached up and took her hand and a moment later, they vanished.
“And how does Mr. Potter factor into this excursion?”
“You’re doing a joint costume with the Weasel?” Draco asked. He did
“Fine,” Draco said again but Harry did not turn around, instead leaving the blond standing there, staring after him.
“And we’re not friends?” McLaggen asks.
And somehow he’s gotten Draco to agree to it.
“The Malfoys want to do business with you. My parents can’t leave their Wiltshire Manor, but that doesn’t mean they’re retired. Which is why I’m here. We would like to propose an alliance.”
Draco had, of course, received an Order of Merlin First Class for his efforts, as had Harry for his defeat of Voldemort.
“Don’t be an arsehole, Massi. Of course that’s why. Why are you here?”
“Good. That was the point. Now tell me more about the Sim-whatchamacallit’s plan to take over Muggle real estate.” McLaggen takes a large quaff of his G&T. He wipes his mouth on the back of his sleeve.
But now it was time to fix the place up. The Parlour was just a few doors down from Flourish and Blotts, so Harry would be able to keep an eye on Draco while he worked there during the day. It was not that he didn’t trust Pansy to do it, except, well, he didn’t really trust Pansy to do it. After all, she had killed Oliver. Or let him die. Same difference in Harry’s mind. And while Dempsey, Croaker and Hermione all seemed to trust her, Harry still did not.
“The whole Sixth Year?” he asked. “Dobby thought the Halloween party wasn’t until next week.”
Around eleven, Greg begs tiredness and heads home, leaving Harry and Draco to snuggle on the couch, nursing the ends of their own drinks. Harry turns on the television, but Draco doesn’t pay much attention to it. He is drowsing in his cocktail and all but asleep when there’s a flash of green light from outside.
just homework. At least for now it wasn’t possibly hundreds of Death Eaters pouring into the school. But they had a plan for that. And really, he thought, it was a jolly good one.
“Why are we so bad at this?” Harry whispered to Draco as they turned their attention back to their ingredients.
His heart was hammering in his chest. He couldn’t believe his mother had managed to get so much information out of him. But then, he supposed, she
“Forget I mentioned him.” Ron sits up and looks at Harry.
I'm juggling 4 different stories right now. I'm so sorry that this is so late.
“He wanted to give me this,” he said, holding it aloft. “He said that it would protect me.”
“What is it?” Draco asked as Harry passed over the protective amulet Dumbledore had given him.
“Yes, yes,” Pansy says, waving off Draco’s comment. “Well done you. But we have bigger mandrakes to pot.” He sighs.
It took them the rest of the evening, but by the end, all five of them could keep Harry’s spells at bay. They left the Room of Requirement in high spirits and walked right into Seamus.
“No,” Draco says, shaking his head. “It’s just what we call him.” He claps a hand over his mouth, almost unable to keep from laughing. He glances over at Pansy and Potter who are also trying hard to suppress their laughter. Even Dempsey has cracked a smile. Granger clears her throat.
“It would be even more helpful if he just volunteered the information without us having to ask,” Blaise groused.
“What makes you say that?” Pansy asks. McLaggen looks around again. Pansy sighs and pulls out her wand. “Muffliato,” she says. It is a spell Potter had shown her a little while ago that muffles conversations so that people can’t overhear them. She wonders why it is not in any Ministry guidelines. McLaggen looks at her in confusion, so she explains the spell. He nods and his shoulders relax a bit.
“Being the photographer.” Draco breathed in sharply through his nose.
“I’m headed back home to Milan.”
“But we have a theory as to where it is,” Blaise said quickly.
“Bullshit,” he said. “Relationships take work. Do you think they’re just a walk in the park?”
“Fair point.” Draco put the book back into the box. “What do you think I should do with it?” Greg shrugs.
“Colloquius,” he said and then waited. “Harry?” he whispered. There was nothing. Draco did his best not to feel too disappointed. He looked down at his watch, squinting at it in the dark, and saw that it was late - far too late for Harry to be awake and wearing his glasses. Draco slumped back onto his pillows.
“You’re very obviously asking if you can help me catalogue the new inventory. Why? What did you
“Yes.”
“Pansy and Ron.” The aforementioned pair were snuggled together on another sofa, their faces pressed together.
“As you wish,” Harry says. He clambers off of Draco and shimmies out of his jeans. And for half a second, Draco is nervous. It’s been so long since that first night.
“If there’s anything wrong with my unborn child,” he’d said, shaking his fist.
“You’re back,” Ron cried. He and Pansy were still sitting at the table where Harry and Draco had left them.
“Ha, you owe me,” he cries triumphantly. “Hand over that galleon, Ronald.” Ron catches his eye and Harry raises his eyebrows and grins at him.
with McLaggen, so perhaps Pansy is the better option. This way McLaggen will be more likely to come back in one piece.
“Oh, just enough to infer that a certain Slytherin may have taken you up on that date I dared you to ask him on.” There was a knowing gleam in Seamus’s eyes. Harry groaned.
“They’re unconscious,” Harry points out.
“Thank you,” he said. “It’s lovely!” He wrapped it around his neck and Narcissa looked delighted. Then they both turned and watched as Draco opened his other gifts. There were several books, including the Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare, which Harry had to stop himself from commenting on as he remembered he was supposed to be Pansy. The books were followed by a new pair of black wingtip oxfords. A burgundy sweater (“Red, mother? Really?” “Hush, Draco. It looks good on you.”) and a small snake lapel pin with emerald eyes rounded out the presents.
“I mean,” he says, so quietly that his voice is little more than a whisper. “There’s something strange about that Muggle murder that Potter and Malfoy stumbled into.”
“I’m very used to doing dishes,” is all he says as he sits back down. Draco frowns at him, but he does not elaborate.
“Yum,” Pansy said, leaning over to break off a piece of a doughnut. “Thanks Ron.” Ron beamed and then realized what he was doing and toned it down somewhat.
They make their way across the bridge in silence. Harry doesn't know what to say. He's not a hundred percent sure what Draco means, but he doesn't want to ask about it until they are sprawled on the grass in the sun. The closer they get to the park, the more Harry feels like this is the right way to spend the afternoon. They both have baggage, much of which concerns each other, and it will be easier to talk about in a neutral setting for both of them.
“No, they’re not,” he said gently.
“Cool,” Draco says. He makes a mental note of where in the entrance hall this spot is. Right under the large dome in the ceiling.
a slow day, he can take a nap in the break room. He lifts his coffee back to his mouth and drinks several large mouthfuls. It is helping, but coffee can only help so much when you are running on two hours of sleep. If only he could remember what the book had been about, then perhaps the tiredness would feel like it had been worth it. But as much as he strains, he cannot remember a single sentence.
“Can we get ice cream?”
Cup,” Harry said.
“Sim Soc?” Draco suggests with a smirk.
“It’s an intimate conversation.”
Once they reached the end of that corridor, they went down a flight of stairs and along another corridor until they finally reached a pair of massive twin oak doors. Draco hesitated for a moment, staring up at the wood, before he squared his shoulders and pulled one door open.
“Thanks,” Ron said once he had left. Pansy shrugged.
“You have no idea who Felix Green is?” Granger presses.
“Are we really going to fuck in the common room? Hell yes, we are, Potter.”
“Beg pardon?”
“Precisely.”
that woman.” Harry grins.
“Right, yes. Go on, dear,” Narcissa says.
“I literally protested once.”
“Well, yes, but-“
“I definitely say so.”
“Arthur Weasley helped me.” Draco nods. From what he’s heard about Arthur Weasley, it sounds like the exact kind of thing he would do.
“Not really,” he says. “Pansy’s in Argentina, Blaise’s wife has just had a baby and Theo’s in America.” He pauses, frowns. “In case it has escaped your notice, Potter, I don’t
Getting everyone back through Honeydukes and through the cellar was a much more difficult task than it had been getting everyone out, but finally it was just Harry and Draco under the cloak, sneaking through the boxes of sweets. Draco kept biting his lip and looking sideways at Harry while Harry pretended not to notice.
“He insists. We have plenty of space. Plus, I thought you were spending tonight in my bed anyway.” Harry catches Draco’s eye and Draco returns his stare cooly, praying that Harry will pick up on what he’s trying to convey.
“Sometimes that counts as flirting,” he mumbles. He pulls his glass to himself and drains the last of his gin and tonic.
“Please?”
“But then what badge do you keep flashing at people? Like security? Or the line of people outside of Bertie’s office?”
However, this isn't Draco's first rodeo and he knows all the spells for wrinkle release and beyond. Within minutes, he looks put together, even if he feels like he should look a mess given his nighttime activities.
McLaggen starts to say something, but she shushes him with a wave of her hand. She thinks she might be on to something. The distribution of the houses. It’s not random. It can’t be. The houses are so close together. And they’re so close to Diagon Alley… But they need to confirm with the real estate agents whether or not they’re holding properties for a certain buyer.
“In case something happens. I want you to know. I love you.”
“Did you know anything about this?” Harry asked as soon as he and Draco were safely ensconced in their potion’s room.
“You’re smart,” Pansy says. “Play and learn the rules as you go.” She nudges him with her elbow and he relents.
“You think it’s this crazy thing, with kidnapping and what have you, when a more commonplace explanation is much more likely. Maybe Granger is having a bad day. Maybe she’s got other things going on in her life that are distracting her. Maybe, dear Merlin, she’s human and she forgot
“What? No significant others?” Harry asks. He sounds scandalized. Draco shakes his head.
“He hid under the table.”
“You say that now…”
“How have you not noticed the patio?” Draco asked, pushing a drink across the bar to Harry and gesturing at the large window against one wall. Seamus shrugged.
“That doesn’t help me much,” Pansy protests.
“Yes,” he said. “Thank you, Harry. Draco didn’t know who I was.”
“I swore an Unbreakable Vow to Draco’s mother, that if the time came and he couldn’t, ah, finish the job that I would.”
“And that perhaps you should have told me?”
“OK,” Massi says. He sounds nervous.
“Language, Potter. Please recall that I’m your professor. Ten points from Gryffindor.” Harry glowered at him, blood pounding in his ears.
“What are you doing out here?” Draco asked. He looked around the space for some sort of chair, and, finding none, slid down the half wall of the balcony and sat on the floor with his knees bent before him. There was a small popping noise and a small furniture set materialized in the corner. Draco sighed dramatically and dragged himself back to his feet before sitting down heavily on the nearest seat, which happened to be a loveseat.
“Take Me to Grimmauld Place.” The GPS pulls up the directions after a moment’s pause. Draco knows he can program it without his wand, but he’d forgotten to do it when leaving the house and this requires much less of his concentration. Which is good as there’s a large lorry trying to overtake him on the inside and Draco’s more than a little concerned it’s going to swerve into his lane.
“But Ron,” Harry cried, exasperated. “It’s
I mean, I had to make sure to post *something* on Harry's birthday. ;)
“How long ago was it, Cissa?” Lucius asks. Narcissa twists her mouth as she thinks.
“Hey,” Ron said suddenly. “Do we want to go find that Cup now?”
“You’re sure you’re not hitting on me?”
“Always room for biscuits,” he muttered. He crossed his arms in front of his chest and glared around at them. “Oh, Harry. You’re starting to turn back.” Hermione checked her watch.
“Yes,” Massi says.
“Me?” Harry asked.
“Fuck.”
“Oh my god,” she breathed. “That’s so cute.” Harry flushed and Draco rolled his eyes.
“I read about her once.” Massi nods and places a hand on the small of Draco’s back, steering him to the next display. It holds a large, golden chalice inscribed with runes.
“No.” Harry’s voice is fierce against his head.
“If you have any biscuits,” Ron started to say before Hermione cut him off.
“It’s
“Yes,” Dumbledore said. “I was getting to that. Do you remember when I showed you all the memory of Riddle in the orphanage?” They had all gone pensieve diving during the past few hours. “I had been working with Patterson on the problem of horcruxes, and we figured that cave was as good a place as any for Voldemort to want to hide one of them.” He paused, looking around at them sadly. “Jonathan got it into his head that he should attempt to retrieve it alone.”
“Circe,” Draco says loudly as they push past the curtain. “I think I need another drink.”
“No, I didn’t
“Can you be trusted to clean yourself up properly?” Draco asked. “I mean, I know what happened last time.” He started to laugh, but stopped when he saw the look that Harry was giving him.
“May I have your wands please?” McLaggen asks. Draco glances at Harry and sees Harry clench his jaw briefly.
“But now that all of our secrets are in your head,” Croaker breaks in. “You work for us.”
after Draco.
“Yeah,” Seamus said. He started to move away, but Justin grabbed his hand. He turned back in time for Justin to peck him quickly on the cheek before walking quickly into the Great Hall. Seamus put a hand up to his cheek and blushed. He shook himself. He was getting soft. Although, the image of Justin walking away, or more accurately, the shape of Justin’s arse as he walked way, lingered in Seamus’s mind for long moments before he followed the other man into the Great Hall.
“Are you bringing Harry to the Manor?”
“Fine,” Draco said. “But after Christmas, I will have my diatribe against your relatives and you won’t stop me.”
“From that Beedle the Bard story?”
“How much do you know about Occlumency?” Harry asked, looking up from the lemongrass he was shredding.
“Eh,” Harry said, waving his hand. “Fuck it. I don’t care who knows.” Seamus took a long hard look at Harry.
a few more times since that night. Each of those evenings had started in the Leaky Cauldron and ended in Greg’s bed. Pansy thinks she could get used to this. Not that she will admit it to anyone, least of all Greg.
He could pretend that they were back in the Room of Requirement curled up together on the couch.
of your tasks.”
Harry looked at his watch. It was now nine in the evening and he and Draco had been each other for over eight hours. Draco had, of course, taken the first opportunity he could to kiss Harry-Draco and Harry had just closed his eyes and pretended that it wasn’t his face that had been moving in to kiss him. With his eyes closed, Harry decided it wasn’t so bad.
“Oh,” Blaise said as he spotted Harry soaring above them. “That’s a good idea. I left the other brooms by the door.”
The Dursleys had sent their customary token gift - this year it was a wine cork - which lead to Harry explaining that his surviving family were horrible people, a fact that surprised the Slytherins.
“That was fun this afternoon - all of us playing poker together,” he said.
“I can’t help it if it’s true,” she says, smirking.
“Yes.”
“Aah,” he yelled as he burst forth. He ran with the sword held aloft above his head and when he reached the snake, he struck without hesitation.
“Yes,” McLaggen says. “My colleague and I-“
“Are you saying you want to help me with Operation Keep The Death Eaters Out of Hogwarts Without Them Realizing What I’m Doing and Punishing Me?”
“-Well don’t,” Harry cuts her off. Hermione turns and spots the pair of them. She presses her lips into a thin line.
“No.” Luca’s face falls.
“Where did they go?”
“She probably already has a pretty good idea of what went on. You’re not exactly quiet, Potter.”
Even though Draco has had veritaserum training, Pansy thinks that confession was real. That idiot. Why did he have fall for his handler? Pansy supposes part of this is her fault. After all, it had been her idea for Draco’s cover to be that he was dating Potter. She had suggested it for a laugh, and because they
“There is a clear chain of command, Parkinson.”
“Potter’s head is big enough without Horace flattering him all the time,” Snape sneered. Harry scowled, but he was not going to start anything with the professor in front of Dumbledore, so he let it slide.
“I know.”
for me because I couldn’t tell anyone what I was up to, aside from Greg and Vince. I pushed people away rather than lie to them. I don’t want to do that for the rest of my life.”
“Yeah, it’s been what? Ten years?” she says.
where you were on Tuesday!” Harry nodded.
He finds himself wishing that Greg were not there. He wants more than anything to talk to Hannah about his and Harry’s relationship, but it’s not a conversation that he wants getting back to Pansy. So instead he describes wandering through the Galleria and hints that he bought everyone Christmas presents in Italy.
“Come on,” he says. His mouth quirks up at the corner in a half smile as they emerge onto the main road.
“No,” Hermione said quickly. “Thank you for letting us know, Dobby.” Dobby bowed.
“Yes, they will.” Pansy puts her hands up in surrender.
“Capital job, Spaniel,” Draco said. He set the rune gently down onto the table.
“Well, it didn't used to be. Although after the ferret incident, I dare say I worked on it.” Draco went back to chopping. “It's probably more of a Slytherin trait than a Gryffindor one.”
“So you’ve mentioned.”
As he stood on the moving staircase up to Dumbledore’s office, Harry wondered if that time was drawing near. Part of him wanted it to be, part of him didn’t. Because… what if they lost?
“Should I?”
“What’s on offer?”
“I thought you liked me without clothes.”
“Cazzo,” Massi says, more to himself than to Draco. “I’ve said too much.”
“With Agent Potter.”
Draco bites back a comment of “I wonder why,” just as Harry says,
“All of them?”
“Wait,” Blaise cried. “I just want to know your name.”
“I’ll look at you however I want to.”
“I guess,” he said. Something in his voice must have alerted Harry to the fact that he was now worried about that because Harry quickly apologized for bringing it up.
“If that’s what you want to do.”
“Do you normally do that?”
“Merlin, Harry, have you been listening to a thing I’ve said? Of course I don’t.” Harry breathed a sigh of relief.
“I do?” She rolled her eyes at him. Then she reached out and took his hands, which had been hanging dumbly by his sides.
“Long story short, McLaggen came in and found Draco and I crouched next to two very bloody and very dead bodies.”
“Why not?”
Suddenly the past few days jump into startling clarity for Draco. Massi’s insistence on touching him all the time. Massi’s insistence that no one fuck him during their threesomes. Massi then wanting Draco to fuck him when they were alone. No wonder Draco had started to feel affection for him. Massi has been slowly intoxicating him.
“Because we need you on this heist. This is the priority. We think it’s going to lead us to the head of an Italian crime family - the Battaglia Family - that we, and the Polizia Magica, have been tracking for years. They’re notoriously slippery and it is Dempsey’s opinion that it’s time to send in the big guns.”
“I located Draco Malfoy. He was at dinner with Agent Potter. I believe Potter was on a reconnaissance mission. I observed them from the window for a short while until I noticed a figure emerging from the kitchen with what appeared to be a Confuso-bomb in one hand and an Instant Swamp in the other. I swear, I would recognize those Triple W logos anywhere. So I, er, got involved.” Pansy pauses here and looks shamefaced down at her shoes. She knows he's has created a giant mess inside that restaurant, and Minister Tusneem will not be pleased with her.
“Lovely,” Harry said. Narcissa looked delighted and Harry noticed that when she was happy, Draco’s mother was beautiful. He was distracted, however, by Draco shoving his cracker in Harry’s face and waving it about.
“Would I what?” Ron asked.
“Sure,” Ron said. He looked around the room. Unfortunately most of the available seating appeared to be taken. He was about to suggest going outside, when Pansy took his hand and led him over to the small graveyard that was in the corner of the room, where she promptly sat down on the thick grass that covered the floor there. She was immediately enveloped by the thick fog that hung in the air around the gravestones.
“Probably. It’s not like she can put it anywhere else. The Manor is the safest place for the moment as I doubt she can just walk into Gringotts. You know, as she’s an escaped Death Eater and all that.” He shrugged. He wanted them to change the subject. More than anything, he wanted Harry to stop staring at him with so much intensity.
“If you say so,” he says finally. “But, no, I don’t have an espresso machine.”
“You too,” he says, as his cock bobs loose from its cloth confinement.
“Not that it’s any of your business, but yes, I do,“ And Pansy isn’t sure if that’s the truth or not. Because Draco’s been trained, and she knows he has. But it still seems so genuine.
Hermione looked over at the note and preemptively handed Harry her quill.
“Uh,” Harry said. “Having had the strange experience of kissing myself-“
“What?” Ron asked, shaking his head slightly to dispel what he’d been thinking about, which was, incidentally, how Harry and Draco were doing in muggle London.
“Total dick move, mate,” Ron added. “Not that it worked.”
“Yes,” Harry said. “It was miserable, though I am getting better at it. What did you do?” At this, Ron blushed scarlet, his face clashing nicely with his hair.
“Because I’m not going to suck your cock right now,” Draco says, pushing up against Massi. He puts his mouth next to Massi’s ear and whispers, “I’m going to bend you over this cabinet and fuck you until you cry out my name.” Massi inhales sharply and Draco gently nips his earlobe. He finds the idea of fucking Massi over the Voldemort Hand of Glory perversely exciting. A big ‘fuck you’ to the Dark Lord, if you will.
“What’s that?” She shook her head, bringing her attention back to the room and the task at hand.
“I think I have an idea,” she said.
“No,” Harry groused.
“Great.” Potter pushes off of the doorframe and starts down the corridor. Draco watches him leave, unsure if he should follow or not. He walks to the door.
“You heard correctly. How about you? Has it just been Flourish and Blotts?”
“I thought we just stumbled upon it?”
“All this talk of cock sucking and threesomes is making me horny,” Harry says. “Why are we sitting here drinking and not naked in a bed?”
“It would probably be better,” Hermione agreed, wincing as Harry hobbled around the room. “He’s going to give himself away otherwise. Or twist his ankle.” She brought her hand up and massaged her temples. “I can’t believe I didn’t think of this earlier.”
We're in the midst of moving hell right now, so all comments and kudos are appreciated to inspire me to write, not pack ;)
“Are you okay?” She watches as he takes a deep breath and slips his ‘everything is fine’ face back on.
“Why?” asked Dumbledore.
“Fucking Potter,” she mutters and then adds something inaudible. Harry almost feels sorry for her, but then he remembers that she had just tried to knock them out. He is surprised that she was so brazen. The DMLEHS must be really gunning to fix the situation before the Unspeakables can. He wonders if she knows The Reliquary is gone. He doubts it, or she would have been more gentle in trying to bring Malfoy in.
“We’ll get her back,” he says. “I promise.” He squeezes Ron around the shoulders again and then jerks his head towards the door. “We should get back.”
“You could hold him by the ear?” Hermione suggested.
“So you’re telling me this is the only nice jumper you own?” Draco said, plucking at the offending jumper. He and Harry were in Gryffindor Tower, getting dressed before their day out in Hogsmeade.
“Are you cold?” he asked.
Apologies for the delay - I took a week off for Thanksgiving! :)
“It can create beds,” Ron said, winking at her.
“Do you think it’s to do with last night? With the Chamber?”
didn’t want to be a Death Eater and
“Susie, you wound me,” McLaggen says, placing a hand over his heart.
Once he is crouched next to the earring, he motions Pansy over and shows it to her, being careful not to touch it. He explains the simurgh to her and she nods.
“Would you prefer that?” Draco sneers.
“Where?” he asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I promise you, sir,” he began but Snape waved his hand to silence him and Harry snapped his mouth shut. Snape lowered himself into his chair, opposite Harry.
“We can see.” They badger the helpful sales clerk until she lets them share a changing room and once the door is closed, Harry pulls out his wand. First he adds a secondary lock to the door and then he calls the house elf.
“Yes, well, curiosity killed the cat.”
“But mother,” Draco started to protest but Narcissa shook her head.
He was thinking about the diagrams that Draco had looked up from the restricted section books, but he wisely refrained from saying any more.
“Were you aware of the fact that Justin Finch Fletchley and Seamus Finnegan have an on again off again somewhat relationship?” Pansy asked. The two in question were sitting on one of the sofas that were scattered about the room, Seamus with his arm around Justin’s shoulder. Their faces were very close together.
A flurry of back and forths later and they had settled on codenames for all of them. Pansy was Esmeralda, because in her words she was the best Disney princess as she was such a badass. This lead to Ron pointing out that Hermione should be Belle as Belle loved books. Blaise proved to be much more difficult, so they named Crabbe and Goyle Thing 1 and Thing 2 respectively while they were discussing his name. They finally settled on Stinger as Blaise was an avid Wimbourne Wasps fan, at which point he and Ron had a heated discussion about whether the Chudley Cannons or the Wasps were the better team. (“The Cannons have won the league twenty two times!” “Yes, but the last time was in 1892, and anyway we’ve won it eighteen times.”)
“Yes,” he says as her eyes focus on him again. “I think that would be lovely.”
“Are you ticklish, Potter?” he asked, unconsciously switching back to Harry’s last name as his brain tried to keep up with the situation.
“Again,” Blaise said. “No one knows what you’re talking about.” Harry threw his hands up in frustration.
“What about the jam to cake ratio?”
“You shouldn’t open it for another twenty four hours,” he says, reaching up to pull off his mask. “Just to be safe.”
“And uh, here goes.” He thought back to his time in Dumbledore’s study at the end of last year. It was hazy. He had been upset, and had broken a lot of things. He wished he had Dumbledore’s pensieve. He wondered if he could borrow it to show Draco the full thing.
“Shall we?” he asks, ignoring Massi.
“Yes,” Draco breathes. The sight of Harry’s hands on himself while Draco is inside him is so intoxicating that Draco knows he will be using this mental image with his own hand for months to come. Except, he might not have to.
“You are most welcome,” Lucius says. “Now then.” He claps his hands together. “Why don’t you two go put those on so that Narcissa and I can spectate some Seekers’ Games, eh?” Draco turns to his father and raises an eyebrow.
“How could you have helped?” Draco shrugs.
“Go on then,” Harry said. “What classroom?”
“Perhaps the barbecue course,” he said. “That pork belly was so crispy, but so tender.”
Taking things in stride was a skill he had honed as an Unspeakable and one that he wished he’d had a better grasp on earlier in his life. He supposed some of it came with age though. And at least this had been a pleasant surprise. He’d had far too many that had been terrible. Not least of all the unpleasant surprise from earlier in the week.
True to his word, McLaggen is waiting for Pansy at the Leaky Cauldron at five thirty. Pansy scowls slightly when she sees him. She was halfway hoping he would give up on whatever it is he wants to tell her. She jerks her head in the direction of the bar and he meets here there. She studiously ignores him while she orders a whisky and soda water, but she waits while Hannah pours his gin and tonic.
“So I can eat your bacon then?”
There is a loud thump from the corridor and Harry jerks blearily awake. Draco grabs his wand off of the beside table.
“No,” Harry cried, his voice choked. “I want that someone to be you.”
“Yes, well,
“Tell me anyway,” McLaggen says. Pansy sighs. She shifts her weight from one foot to the other.
Harry shrugs.
“It’s more what she didn’t say. It was abhorrent, Mother, so much… so much goodwill and
“Would you mind getting us some tea and… well… checking the MAIL?” She said with an inorganic emphasis, and Harry’s swift nod and exit made him realized they’d
“What else do I supposedly say?”
Weasley opened his mouth; he closed it abruptly.
“I did mention that a Muggle bakery might be a good choice for the party, I’ll admit. I was growing impatient and realized I was being a bit overprotective of you, though they picked Iida out all on their own.” She laughed his favorite laugh again. “As for Weasley, that was a decidedly peculiar choice and entirely against my recommendation, though he was clearly effective.”
It wasn’t that he didn’t trust Malfoy, really, it wasn’t. Bygones were very well gone, and so were the days of assuming nefarious deeds were occurring right under his nose. Malfoy was living his life as it should be-- quiet, simple, and not in Harry’s way.
She sighed, putting her head in her hands, and he pointed an accusing finger.
, something respectable, something he’d thought he could at least slightly enjoy, after weeks of coming home with the stench of Peri Peri making him nauseous.
“Ahem.” A voice snapped him back to reality. He blinked.
“No, Mer--no. Christ. If anyone was the bully, it was him,” Harry said defensively, and she let out an undignified snort.
“S’alright Malfoy, Christ. Didn’t know this job would have so much of you crying in it or I wouldn’t have wasted time with a gap year,” Weasley said, and Draco’s blood surged back in his face.
“The fit brown one or the fit ginger?” she asked, and the absurdity of those two being described as such broke his restraint, and a laugh escaped.
Every time, he told himself, ‘Harry, this will be your last.” And every time, he found himself there. Again.
“Mrs-- er, Ms? Malfoy? Do you know? Draco, what?” He watched her struggle to find the words, and he realized he hadn’t at all, in the entire walk, planned what to say to her. He opened his mouth several times before shutting it again. His mother cleared her throat primly.
“And I’m to assume you’ve agreed, my dove?”
“Oh, just a story about his dear old--” Draco kicked him under the table. “Er-- dear old school days,” Potter finished lamely. Draco wondered how he’d ever vanquished anything.
“I’m sorry about Ron, I mean, my friend, he means well, it’s just that he’s obnoxiously particular, not that we knew that before, obviously, I--”
“The boy with the glasses--”
Mr. Iida’s eyes began to glisten. Draco felt ill.
“Is that how you met?” Harry blurted out, looking immediately regretful. Draco shook his head, laughing incredulously. He needed a drink. A very large, very strong drink. He raised a groomed eyebrow at the still sorrowful looking Potter, and wondered again how he ever managed his social life. Granger or Weasley, most likely.
“Welcome to moving forward, Malfoy.” Ron clapped him on the shoulder, and Draco started. “Good to have you with us.” And before Draco could retort, he Disapparated.
“Could this be about the…” she whipped her head to look at Draco, and Narcissa’s eyes were a fraction too wide behind her. He looked at his mother, who nodded.
“Come along, Potter. Let’s see if you can outdrink a Death Eater.”
Add an extra shot and be at the lookout on top xxx
Draco felt his face turn white. There was the uncomfortable sense of the other shoe dropping: it figures that with this reckoning of the rest of his life, that his most solid friendship would be imploding too. He sat quietly, trying to gather his thoughts, and she seemingly understood. They sat there in the quiet for a moment before he began speaking.
“Two more strokes and the chantilly would have turned.” Draco looked down in horror.
from Narcissa Malfoy.
“Just a bit tired, sorry. Renovations, you were saying?” Miriam eyed him with the look of the unconvinced. He managed a smile, hoping it didn’t look as grim as he felt. She turned her head back to the papers.
“Lucky me, you do both! Well, lucky for Papa, anyway, because you’re so much better than me it’s almost insulting,” she said brightly.
“Yes, Papa, I did. He must be new,” she said, turning to him. Her eyes twinkled.
“Fuck!” Draco swore. He’d forgotten the butter. He peeled back the long thin mess.
“Miriam!” he jumped, almost hitting her head hovering over her. He looked around wildly. “Where is she?”
“She sounds wonderful, doesn’t she,” Liam said, gesturing towards the woman on stage, looking incandescent with a mic in her hand, as Miriam always did.
house, stealing my sister and torturing my family. Even in the early days, my love, this house held nothing but fear and rage. You and your father were my only joys, and once you both were gone, I had nothing to do but sit with it all. This would be a purpose, my love. A challenge.” She sat down next to him, pulling his stiff body towards him. He buried his head in her shoulder.
“What?”
“Would you change it?” Miriam’s voice was strong and steady at his side, as it always was, and he was startled into looking straight into Miriam’s eyes. “If you could go back in time. Would you do it again?”
“Don’t be fucking daft,” she spat out, and Draco was surprised by her vehemence. He waited for her to speak further, but nothing came. He sat back, letting but nothing came. He sat back heavily, letting the bench shake under his weight. They sat in silence once again.
“I was everything you despise. A killer, a liar, a thief, a sneak, a bigot. I tortured people, I watched as they died, I...I…” The tears were unstoppable, streaming down his face, and he dug his nails into his palms, wishing for some sense of control and yet unwilling to look into Miriam’s eyes. His voice came out more like a croak, and he cleared his throat, whispering quietly.
“Feisty little toff, you.” Her eyes twinkled even as she acquiesced. He watched carefully, unwilling to admit his own butterflies as she bit delicately into the cooling pastry. She chewed for a moment, and Draco held his breath. What if it was wrong? What if his measurements were off? Oh Merlin, had he used kosher salt instead of caster sugar, fucking--
“Jean-Michel. I bummed the cigarette, he… asked after you, said I was on my way to meet you. Made some jokes. But someone-- in the market. He got so...still. At your name. I remember thinking, must be an ex or summa...I can’t see his face though, in my head. Even though I got a good look, I remember I did! I looked right at him but I can’t remember. I’m sorry!” She burst into tears, and Draco bounded up to his feet in alarm.
“I’ve covered for you so far. Lucky for
She nodded her head.
to look,” Draco said confidently, cutting one in half deftly.
convincing mother to make it to the shop, and--
“Don’t you fret, darling, I’ll have plenty,” Draco spat out, and Liam took her waist with a smug look and walked away. Miriam glanced back, mouthing her thanks.
“We are worried it might be,” Narcissa said smoothly. “We already have sent someone to look after your father at the shop. He’s been told you both witnessed an automo-bile accident and are giving testimony together.”
“That it’s not your mother’s fault. Every time.”
He knew better than to deny fate when he saw it.
“Back here! Just a moment, please!” Miriam shouted.
“Right then. The financiers need doing, double the sweet basil for the gift sets. Cottage loaves’ second proofing will be done in ten. Off you fuck.”
“Liam.” Draco willed his jaw and fist to relax, and the man gave him a charming smile that didn’t reach his eyes.
Miriam rolled her eyes. “You are wasted as a baker, my little Cumberbatch. You can’t fight the drama, can you?”
“Please!” He didn’t care how desperate he sounded. “Don’t make me go out there.”
“I’m beginning to think everyone at that school of yours was dead barking,” she said with a grimace. Harry chuckled, tension leaving his body.
“Look, Malfoy, I--”
His mother deserved all heavenly items after so many years of personal hell.
“No, my dragon. I do not think it will. But for the first time we have a chance to make something new! How foolish would we have to be, to let our regret for a past we cannot control prevent us from creating a future we can?”
“So who are all those people that keep-- the prison. The party. Is that where… is that why?”
Miriam, however, was already there, tongue peeking out in concentration as she piped royal icing onto delicate cookies.
“Of course he was stalking about, Miriam. He was hungry. I thought you told them all to come round the back,” the old man said, and she rolled her eyes.
“Well then. Thank you, Mr. Mallory. I look forward to seeing the final product. This is-- it’s a very important night, you see. We need to show people that the old ways are no longer necessary, that we can mix together all sorts and take care of those of us who make mistakes. We normally wouldn’t be out--” she glanced at Miriam. “--here. But… well… you’re the best,” she said, slightly out of breath from all the atrocious subtext.
“Not the right PUMPKIN, he says.
Miriam grabbed his head between her hands with surprising force.
“We can’t undo the past, Malfoy, but we can shape a future without our mistakes.”
“Pass the cornmeal, Miriam,” he said grimly, and she cocked her head tentatively, face red from fading anger as she handed him the box. He flicked some at her face to her delighted surprise.
“Mouth. Shut.” She set her lip stubbornly, wiping at angry tears welling in her eyes in a desperate attempt to save the chocolate. Draco knew better than to argue, and the air was thick with emotion when Mr. Iida came into the kitchen. The old man raised a furry Vulcan eyebrow.
Harry had the distinct feeling he’d been had.
“And I guess some people didn’t agree with that. In Diagonal Way.”
“Look, I-- oh fuck it, can you meet me at Primrose Hill in an hour? And bring a coffee!” she clicked off before he could answer, and his phone buzzed in his hand.
“I am so, so sorry, Miriam. I thought…” he held her under his chin, and she shook her head into his chest. He kept his voice as stable as he could through his tears rolling down his cheeks.
He didn’t realize he was running out of breath till he gasped for air. There was silence for a few minutes.
Draco knew he’d regret his words before they came out of his mouth, but Potter always knew how to take away his filter.
The timer felt almost deafening in the quiet shop. A harried look came over the young man at the prep counter, sighing as he wiped his hands on the apron.
“Did you off your headmaster?” she asked carefully, and he shook his head.
“What?” Harry jumped up. “No, neither, not-- nothing like that. We were friends, of a sort. In School. Well, enemies.”
A pang that dissipated in an instant when he turned around, coming face to face with ruddy cheeks, shocking blue eyes, and a nose almost as slender and greek as his own.
Draco nodded.
He had just enough thought in his head to think, ‘of course it’s you’ before his consciousness left him and Miriam in a pool, platinum blonde spreading thinly against a shining brown sea.
Draco dropped his towel.
It was Draco’s favorite time of day, this early morning, where everything was quiet-- well, as quiet as London ever got. When the sun was coming up, and he was alone with his work, he could almost forget how far he was from home.
“I take it you’re at Liam’s?” he said, and she sighed.
In another time, Draco would have shrieked at the number of Gryffindors in this house.
--------------
“I KNOW there was a little-- Draco,” Miriam froze, finger almost comically pointed at Harry’s easy, open hands. He felt her smell all around her as she jumped in his arms, and he was glad that he’d already cried.
“Draco?”
raise.”
She shook her head.
“They’re almost all done. Just the garnishes to finish and then you can put the bread in for the morning rush.” He sighed for possibly the 27th time in the last 72 hours, and wondered to himself if he wouldn’t have been better off never meeting Miriam at all. She put a hand on his arm, and he almost dropped the jar of preserved blossoms.
“Thanks.”
“I’m already scheduled to come in,” Pansy says. She picks up her ring and slips it back on her finger. “Don’t want to let down Big Dick.” She doesn’t look at any of them, but instead stares detachedly at her fingers.
“Okay,” Draco whispered and obeyed.
“I’m buying a house,” he says. Draco blinks at him.
wearing pants.”
“Oh, so you admit that we’re dating now, do you?”
“Cormac,” Pansy says, putting a hand on his arm. “It’s Christmas. Let it go.” Cormac turns to look at her, his eyes dropping momentarily to take in her hand on his arm. A flush spreads up his face.
“I didn’t,” Hermione says primly. She stares up at him over steepled fingers. “Please sit, Harry. Towering over my desk isn’t making this conversation any better.”
other red-headed wizarding families,” he said.
“Are you implying that I don’t know how an undercover assignment works?”
And now this day is turning out to be pretty shit too. Perhaps not as bad, because only one person died, but as Harry and Oliver had been more than just partners, it really ranks up there.
“I call bullshit,” Greg says. “You, sir, are intoxicated.”
“You are hardly the first Hogwarts student to ask me about that
“Right,” Harry said once they were all assembled. “Let’s go to Hogsmeade.” Blaise, Draco and Ron cheered, and Pansy allowed herself a small smile. Perhaps this would be fun after all.
“Go tap on her shoulder and ask if she wants to dance.” Neville slumped back into the pillows of the couch, running his hands through his hair in concern. Small puffs of white talcum powder floated up from his head as he did so, turning his hair slightly less gray.
“Somehow,” Blaise said.
“I’m not sure that’s how the metaphor worked,” Harry muttered, but Ron carried on, ignoring him.
“And you won’t,” Harry said. “Because I will be with you when you develop this film and I will destroy it. In fact, give me your camera now so I can keep hold of it in the meantime.”
“Yes, well, the occasion has never arisen before.” This earns Draco a shove, which then somehow turns into Harry shuffling over to him on the bed and kissing him until they are both breathing hard. Draco paws at Harry’s sweater until the brunet relents and pulls it over hs head, leaving his hair tousled. Draco reaches up and smoothes it down.
“Welcome,” Harry said. “To the Chamber of Secrets.” He spread his arms wide and walked into the room. It was just as he remembered it. Lines of stone pillars and the large statue of Salazar Slytherin at the end. The only thing that was different was the skeletal remains of the basilisk. They were stretched across the floor, ribs sticking out from the spine, and its wide open mouthed skull yawing at them.
“I can’t.” Draco narrows his eyes and glares at her.
“Oops,” he says.”
“Yes, for the rest of the day.”
“But we’re not silent.”
“What? Now?” Harry shrugs. He removes his hands from Draco’s waist and instead reaches up and takes one of the hands that Draco has draped around his neck.
“Do they even have books about sex in the library?”
It wasn’t that he didn’t think that Harry could afford to buy his own clothes — he knew Harry had enough in the wallet he’d handed Draco to be exchanged for all of this and more thanks to the strong galleon — but the idea of spoiling Harry in a way that Harry had never been spoiled before appealed to Draco.
“As well as can be expected.”
Massi takes Draco to the Galleria, or, more accurately, to the office across the street from the Galleria. Draco is amazed at his brazenness until he realizes that Massi either thinks that Draco is a dumb civilian, or that he’s expendable. Draco’s not sure which one hurts more.
He makes it up to his bedroom and heaves his suitcase on the bench at the end of the bed, spurred on by the promise of clothes that aren’t red. While Potter’s tracksuit bottoms are certainly soft and though Potter’s quidditch shirt feels a lot like his own (and the red actually looks rather good on him, not that he will ever admit that
“Cool,” Ron said. I want one of these.” He snatched the parchment out of Harry’s hands and read it again. “Blank, of course.”
“What about Hannah?” Draco chews on his lip for a moment before a slowly nods.
He’d also taken the opportunity to dash outside to his car in order to get his phone charger. He’s not sure where to plug it in, but the fact that Potter also has a mobile indicates there must be some outlets
“Understandable, Miss Parkinson,” Snape said. “As you were.” And he swept out of the room again.
Harry is pondering how best to get into the building when an elderly lady shuffles up, dragging a wheelie cart full of laundry. He slips inside the door as she struggles to pull her wheelie cart through behind her. As soon as he is inside, he realizes his mistake.
“We would never,” Ron protested, but she waved off his protests with a smile to show she had been kidding. She rested her hand briefly on his shoulder as she passed by his seat, and his stomach filled with butterflies. He looked guiltily over at Hermione to see if she had noticed, but she was preoccupied by finishing the last of her gin and tonic.
Greg,” Harry says. Malfoy cracks one eye open. A frown crosses his face.
“Maybe,” Harry relented.
“We’ll only tell you if you don’t report it,” Seamus said. Hermione stood up and whacked him on the back of the head with her book.
“I certainly enjoyed
“You literally just sacrificed yourself for me. You’ve gone soft.”
“Do you not know how a Hand of Glory works?” Massi doesn’t wait for an answer, just launches into an explanation of their use. Draco nods along as Massi tells him this Hand of Glory allows up to ten people to see in the dark at a time - and they don’t even have to be touching. “And the best part is, no one else can see the light.” He looks delighted. Draco smiles.
“I mean, I like ice cream,” Draco says with a shrug.
“You’re decent looking.”
“Before I tell you what it is, I think I need to get the six of you up to speed on where we are. Harry, I know that we have had a few sessions with the penseive, which should give you some background on what we are about to discuss. However, now we that do not have the luxury of time, I must put on my teaching hat and instruct you all. I trust that you brought parchment and quills?” There was a general flurry in which Harry and Ron turned to Hermione, and Draco and Pansy turned to Blaise.
“I don’t know who might overhear.”
“Figured this was better,” he says. Draco has to agree. Harry is wearing a forest green teeshirt that matches his eyes and jeans that
“Uh,” McLaggen says, staring dumbly at him.
“Hi,” Potter says.
“Ten four, Blond Unicorn. On it,” Harry said, smirking. He strode out of the room, pinching Draco’s butt as he walked by.
“Harry.”
Draco and his family have predictably faced backlash for being Death Eaters, although the fact that his mother had played a part in Harry Potter’s survival, and the fact that they had defected before the battle even started, means that they have escaped doing any time in Azkaban. Draco is loathe to admit it, but Saint Potter had provided much of the testimony that allowed them to walk free.
to come in and ruin everything.”
“That’s a shame,” Harry says. “I was enjoying kissing you.”
“Um.”
“Is that so?” Cormac asked. He took a step towards Seamus. “In which case.” He snaked an arm around Seamus’s waist and pulled him close. Harry raised an eyebrow as Cormac’s lips ghosted briefly over Seamus’s.
“Wasn’t the worst idea,” Draco says begrudgingly. He reached down and pulled up his trousers. “Only because no one caught us.”
“How about Conan,” Ron continued, ignoring both Harry and Seamus.
They are onto the crispy shredded pork now and Harry keeps having to take sips of water to combat the spice of the dish. He watches Malfoy over the top of his water glass.
“Hello.” Draco gives him a small, awkward nod. This serves to widen Harry’s smile even more. Draco licks his lips. This is seemingly all of the invitation Harry needs to shuffle closer to Draco in the bed.
“Harry gets final approval on all the pictures,” he said. Seamus adjusted his fake glasses a few times, staring at Colin, before nodding his okay.
“It’s certainly for the greater good,” he said slowly.
“It’s complicated,” Potter says. “And I’m not going to get into it before Parkinson gets here.”
“Oh yes,” she says. “Ernie and I are very excited about it.”
Inside the house, an almighty racket starts up. Draco can’t hear exactly what is being yelled, but someone is having a complete conniption fit. Draco’s eyes widen and he takes and unconscious step backwards before he gets a handle on his emotions again. He tugs his waistcoat straight and takes a deep breath.
“Were you lot having a party that no one told me about?” he asked. Hermione rolled her eyes.
“Oh, no,” she says. “Harry and I haven’t been together for years.” Draco extricates himself from the conversation, worried that Ginny’s magnanimity towards him will fade if he stays. She had insisted to him earlier that she was over Harry, but Draco isn’t sure anyone can ever truly get over Harry.
“Where’s Harry?” he asks when he sees that the brunet is not with Draco.
“Give or take.” But Draco has stopped walking again and is staring at his watch. The face of it has turned a funny purple color.
“Hugh Grant.” Ron failed to hide a snort of amusement.
“Seriously? It’s the three of you?”
forgot his gloves?” Blaise asked Pansy as they made their way through the tunnel back to Hogwarts. They were several paces ahead of Ron and Hermione, but he took care to keep his voice quiet.
“Who’s having sex in a private room?” asked another voice from the middle of the room. Harry and Ron spun around to see Seamus who had clearly just walked in on the conversation.
“They, ah, don’t actually know I’m gay.”
“Which I of course know about,” Dumbledore said. “But I don’t think it will be necessary.”
“What?”
They continue to ask him about Green, and then other things in the Reliquary. He continues to fight the veritaserum, finding that it gradually gets easier as the potion starts to wear off. By the end of the session, he is exhausted, but pleased with himself.
“Really?”
“The crest?”
“What would have been dangerous about an empty house?”
“So we have to have a covert investigation into a thing we’re already investigating?”
“Uh, it was supposedly made out of He-who-must-not-be-named’s hand,” Draco says quickly. Harry leans back into the pillows in shock.
“So you’ve been there too,” Seamus said. It wasn’t a question.
“Yes, that,” he grudgingly agreed. “And then one thing led to another and I was left feeling rather happier and having a mess I needed to clean up.”
“Mother.” His voice was now barely above a whisper.
“We had the budget for this,” Pansy gestures around at the Cooler.
“Get away with what?”
“He’s a satyr, but I take your point,” Ron said.
“The Whomping Willow is such an interesting specimen,” Neville said. “How did you know that it would freeze when you touched that knot in the tree?”
“Sparked?”
“They’re not
“Because,” Massi starts to say. He is clearly flustered. Draco moves his head again and nuzzles Massi’s neck. “Affanculo - because the other person you’re dating works for the British Ministry of Magic, which means he’s also an enemy of the family. And probably an enemy of yours too.”
“Seen our guy yet?” he mutters.
“Hermione,” he says. “What’s going on?” Potter stands and begins to pace again as he listens to whatever it is that Granger is saying. Draco fidgets with his fountain pen and listens to Potter have one side of a conversation.
“Those are my socks I’ll have you know,” Ron said. “They were my Christmas present from Draco.”
“Well great. We have one name.”
“Bloody hell,” Ron said, breaking the silence. “That was a lot.”
” Seamus said, pausing with his spoonful of peas partway to his mouth. “We can’t go there.”
“We could bring them in through Aberforth’s pub.”
“You wear contact lenses?” Hermione asked.
“I’m aware, McLaggen,” he says. “As you recall, I was an auror.”
“We might,” Potter says. “It’s all over the news.”
gobstones?” Ron asks. Draco realizes with a flash of irritation that he can’t just call Ron by his surname as there are multiple Weasleys at this party. Then he supposes that he should go ahead and call Granger by her first name as well. They’re Harry’s friends, and though they haven’t seen much of them since they started pretend dating, he gets the feeling they will going forward.
“I didn’t bring it up around Greg because,” Draco starts to say. He pauses and bites his bottom lip.
“I beg your pardon?” Harry said. Draco’s hand froze, mid stroke.
“Why are you defending him?”
“I’m not,” Pansy grunts as she swings her fist at the bag again. “Just let me finish up here. Unless you want to spar with me?” She looks questioningly at McLaggen, a small smile playing about her lips.
“Hello.”
“It’ll work.” McLaggen says it with such confidence that for a moment, Draco believes him.
she’s a Major, right?”
“Yes, alongside Harry when he’s back.”
“Now that we’ve seen the full potential of The Reliquary project,” Granger continues. “It is high time we started training you for more field operations.” She holds up a hand as Draco starts to protest that he has already been on field operations. “Yes, Draco, I know you’ve been a valuable asset in the field.” She gives him a small smile and for the first time (in perhaps his whole acquaintance with Hermione Granger) he appreciates her smile. And, perhaps for the first time, he notices that her teeth aren’t nearly as large as he thought they were. But that has no bearing on their conversation, so he banishes that thought for another time.
“What?” Draco asked. “Kill the fucker?”
“Because you’re not expendable,” Pansy yells back.
While the six of them were still getting some strange looks from the rest of the student body, they had emboldened others to sit wherever they wanted. Neville was an almost constant fixture at the Hufflepuff table, having officially starting dating Claudia - the girl who none of the rest of them had heard of until Neville had introduced them. Ron still wasn’t one hundred percent sure which one she was.
“So that’s it then?” Massi asks. “We’re all getting naked?”
He is sure he will not feel this way in a few days, once he’s had to pretend that he and Potter are an item without any of the benefits associated with seeing someone regularly. But for now he is more than glad he took advantage of being able to sleep with Potter while he had the chance.
The remainder of the week flies by and then it’s Friday and the day of Hannah’s party. Big Dick has encouraged the Flourish and Blott’s staff to dress up for Halloween, so Draco puts on his costume from the year before.
the feel of his hand there. Curse everything, but she likes it.
It was a rather large box and Draco eyed it suspiciously. It rattled slightly when he picked it up. Tearing off the paper revealed a nondescript box, so Draco opened that and peered inside.
“Big Dick knows,” she says. “But none of your idiot coworkers have put two and two together.”
“Why were you with Harry Potter tonight?” McLaggen asks. Pansy watches as Draco frowns at him. Draco’s eyes are slightly unfocussed.
“Ok,” Draco says because there is nothing else he can say about that. When the your boss says you will do something, you do it. He doesn’t mention that he has been working on his defensive magic in his spare time because he is sure that he doesn’t know half the things he needs to.
“Are you ready?” Harry asks as they draw closer to the doors. He glances to the side and sees Draco chewing on his lip. He reaches out and takes Draco’s hand again. He squeezes it once before dropping it. “It’s going to be fine. I will be with you the whole time. And Parkinson will be there too.” Draco nods slowly and stops worrying at his lip.
She hung back somewhat, lost in her own thoughts as they climbed the stairs out of the dungeons and so was surprised when Draco turned to the left and began walking towards the stairs as opposed to the doors to the grounds.
“Would it be able to tell you if someone was in the Simurgh Society?”
Hermione, whoever is impersonating her is doing a damn fine job.
“Um.”
“So we’ll be able to communicate long distance so long as we’re wearing our glasses or contact lenses?” Harry asked, moving the conversation along.
“Have fun?” Draco suggested. Pansy raised an eyebrow.
Harry had no idea where they were going but Draco clearly did. Harry followed as Draco cut a quick path through the ambling tourists and window shoppers. Once they were in the store, he stood and watched as Draco decisively pulled various things off of racks. Occasionally, Draco would hold something up next to Harry and either nod and add it to the ever growing pile, or shake his head and return it to wherever he’d found it.
“Where
“Oh, I know.”
“What did you do?” Draco asked.
serious. She nods her acknowledgment. “Very good, Parkinson. You are dismissed.” Pansy stands and walks to the door of Dempsey’s office. Once there, she stops and salutes before leaving.
“But what is going to happen with our six week project?” Pansy asked.
“Draco.” Narcissa’s voice was low and dangerous.
Draco wants badly to say no, for he doesn’t feel ready, but he forces out a yes. And once he has done that, he realizes that he has already done what Hermione is asking. Hope flares in his chest. Perhaps this won’t be as bad as he fears.
possible future. Professor Slughorn had left the room, but Professor Snape was still there. He looked bored.
It is all Harry can do to stay professional. The more time that he spends with Draco - and he spends a damn lot of time with Draco - the more he likes him. And the more he likes him in a way that is not allowed in a professional setting. Draco is his asset for godssake. He’s not supposed to fall in love with him. But Harry fears that is what is happening.
“It’s ok,” Draco said. “It’s on my mind too. How could it not be? Every day I’m,” he stopped himself there. Harry frowned at him.
“Three.”
“Yes,” Draco says. “Opera is a passion of mine.”
“Fair,” Blaise said. “Maybe some Ravenclaws know more about it. What if,” he paused for dramatic tension. “It’s a Ravenclaw house secret?”
It is most definitely the First of August, and it is a bitch of a day.
“That was Barty Crouch Jr.”
“Snape made these?”
“Aren’t you?”
“But magic is special,” Draco protested.
“We thought,” Draco said. Everyone turned to look at him. “That we might use my orders to lure the Death Eaters, and the Dark Lord himself, to Hogwarts.”
“You’re impossible.”
“What has gotten into her?” he asked. Harry rolled his eyes.
“Sure,” he says. “I’ll be your top secret boyfriend.”
They all stare at the door for a long moment.
“Some drinking. Possibly somewhat underage.”
“Fuck. That’s seriously high level clearance.” Pansy walks over to the sofa in the corner and sits down heavily on it. McLaggen waits a beat and then follows her. He sits on one of the chairs, a respectable distance away. She looks at him.
“How about Truth or Dare?” Harry suggests. Both Massi and Draco gasp. “Oh, fuck. Is this another one of those situations where I was brought up with Muggles and say the wrong thing because wizards play it very differently?”
“I’ll explain fully later.”
Saul Croaker is an older wizard, with thinning salt and pepper hair. His face sags somewhat at the jowls and his dark eyes are sunken. He is an odd combination of thin in the limbs with a large, rounded belly. Draco is not sure what to make of him until he starts talking. And then he thinks that he’s going to do whatever the man jolly well tells him to do because that voice all but demands it.
“Nothing,” she says quickly. “I’m surprised at your dedication.”
“You’re impossible!” Harry cried, throwing up his arms. “One minute, it’s no details, the next minute you’re implying I’m having sex in a private room!”
“Gods no,” Harry said. “You think Hermione would stand by and let us do that?” At this, Blaise’s face cracked into a smile.
“Look, I had a question.” Terry continued to frown at Blaise. “About Ravenclaw.”
“Such as the fact that you’re here?”
“Are what?” Fred asked. George turned his attention to his twin and winked at him. “Oh! Well that’s unexpected.”
“I think there’s time for some toast,” Potter protests. As Pansy opens her mouth to respond, he waves his wand again and six pieces of bread fly out from the breadbox and deposit themselves in the toaster oven, which dings to announce that it is on.
“Please, Draco,” Massi says. “You’re with Massimo Battaglia. Nothing is too extravagant.” Draco catches Harry’s eye across the hot tub and smirks at him. He can’t quite imagine Harry saying something like that, but at the same time, he most certainly can. Harry raises his eyebrows briefly but smiles at Massi when Massi looks his way.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said. He felt like he needed to step in and defend himself. “But excuse me for not wanting all of our sexual encounters to be in a dusty storeroom and what is ostensibly a classroom.”
“Are you sure you’re comfortable with everything, Massi?” Draco asks. “We can always just leave.”
“What about Greg?”
“Ok, so what?”
So what was he doing with a Simurgh Society embroidery on his sleeve?
“I told you, Ron,” Harry said. “It’s like a letterman’s jacket.”
“No.”
“So he went to prison for no reason?” Draco snatched his hand back. He was pale - paler than usual.
“Prost,” added Blaise.
“Wait, you’ve never?” Pansy asked. Harry looked down at his toes and shook his head. “But you’re the bloody golden boy of Gryffindor!”
“But he said no when you dared me to ask him.”
he have to do it? And on top of that, it wasn’t like anyone had taught him how to even
The final few weeks of school had been spent learning whatever the teachers had felt like teaching them. This meant lots of celebratory and decorative charms from Professor Flitwick, pepper-up potions and calming draughts from Professor Slughorn and more normal lessons from Professor McGonagall, albeit with no homework.
“I’m so sorry,” Harry said again. He reached up with his free hand to wipe away the tear, but Draco batted his hand away, his face hardening.
But really, he wanted the freedom to kiss Draco at any time, not just behind closed doors. His heart ached with the longing for it. He wanted to show Draco off to the world, and say that Draco was his and he was Draco’s.
He remembers finishing the book, sure. He remembers reading the book, and that insatiable need to inhale the words off of the page. But for the life of him, he does not remember any of the content. He glares at the empty cover of the book, which lays open on the bed. He feels like the book is mocking him and he does not like it. He picks up the cover and hurls it across the room. It hits the wall with a dull thud and then falls to the floor. Draco hurries over to it and examines it fearfully, in case he has damaged it. The book cover is fine. It is still inexplicably empty, but it is not damaged.
“We do,” Signore Battaglia says. “I will not concern you with it, but suffice to say, he will be taken care of.” Draco nods. “And it will look like an accident.”
“Weasley,” he says with a nod of his head.
When the dessert appeared, Harry had to admit that it was beautiful. It was a white sphere, dusted with gold, sitting on a clean white plate. Harry picked up his dessert spoon and tapped the sphere. He managed to break through the white chocolate easily and soon was enjoying the chocolate mousse inside. Harry had to admit, that while he had laughed at the idea of the dessert, eating it was a delight. The mousse was light, but rich and the blackberries gave it lovely pops of brightness.
my mother’s sister.”
look a bit silly. But he’s supposed to be Father Christmas, so that’s kind of the point. He has so much latex on his face that Harry can barely recognize him. The only thing that gives him away is his hair, but McLaggen’s now working on getting his wig ready, so even that will be disguised shortly.
“But we’re not friends,” she points out.
“Ha, fucking. Diagrams. Diagrams about fucking.” Harry hadn’t thought he could laugh any harder, but he was mistaken. He was laughing so hard it was getting difficult to breathe. He put an arm out and steadied himself on Draco’s shoulder, gasping for air in between each guffaw.
“You mean,” Draco started to say. Then he paused. “You mean we could have been friends?”
“What if it is?”
“Another murder?”
“Nah,” Blaise said. “In fact, now that they’re here,” he jerked his head in the direction of the three house elves who were now patiently waiting by the corner of the bar. “We can stop. But I want to make you something first.” He caught her eye and smiled. Next to Hermione, Ron resisted rolling his eyes and making a gagging noise.
“Sorry,” Pansy said. She dropped back down off of her tiptoes. “I don’t like being sad, and I figured this would cheer me up, which it did.”
“Whatever I want?” Draco asks. Harry nods. “In which case, I want to go clubbing.” Harry raises his eyebrows but nods. “We might have to stop home first though.”
“I don’t know who you’re talking about,” Draco says. “I’ve never heard that name before.” Which is strictly true. He hadn’t heard of Green until Granger had mentioned him just now. He is discovering that mixing in as much of the truth as he can to his lies, makes them easier to tell.
Once he is all the way inside, his balls resting against Harry’s arse, he stills. Harry is so tight around him he is almost afraid he will come just from holding himself still. He can feel Harry clenching and unclenching around him and it sends shivers of desire through him.
“Perfect,” Ron said. He turned quickly and started towards the door. In his haste, he knocked over an ottoman that was piled high with books. The books went crashing into a pile of goblets which clattered down around them. “Sorry.” Hermione rolled her eyes and bent down to start cleaning up after Ron’s mess. Ron made a guilty face, then continued toward the door. Pansy bent to help Hermione and soon the floor was clear again.
“Yes,” Harry says.
“Right. Yes. Of course,” McLaggen says. But then he stops talking and stares at his shoes, chewing nervously on his lower lip.
“Half an hour, you said?” he asks, checking his watch.
“Kiss you?”
“Of course,” Harry says. “Why wouldn’t I?” Draco shrugs.
Looking at the house next door, there is nothing apparently wrong. The lights are off, same as they were when Harry and Draco stumbled down the street on their way home from Hannah’s.
“I’m glad you’ll get to see your family for Christmas, Pans,” Draco says. Pansy turns her gaze to him and it is not the excited look he was expecting. Rather, she looks annoyed. “Unless you didn’t want to see them?”
“Shit,” Harry mutters. He laces his fingers behind his head, elbow sticking out to the side, and scrunches up his face. Draco looks up from the papers with an expression surprised guilt.
“No time,” Draco says and it’s true. They had gone from bed to the shop in a matter of a few minutes.
that messy and there’s no apparent gel or potion that will fix it for very long. He knows that Harry’s biggest fear is dementors and he knows that Harry would do anything for his friends or the people he loves. Including buying an entirely new house just to be closer to them. When he stops to think about it, he knows a damn lot about Harry.
spike their butterbeer with firewhisky. Not that he would strictly say that Hermione was the rule enforcer of the group, but with her gone, it seemed an easier topic to bring up with the other two. “‘Mione’ll find a way.”
“You’ll live,” she said comfortingly. “It’s only homework.” Ron sighed but nodded because she was right. It
“Define tried.” This earns Draco another smirk. Potter spoons the meat, now browned, back out of the pot, and transfers it to a plate. Then he adds the mirepoix to the pot where the meat was. The vegetables sizzle as they meet the hot oil.
“You sure?”
at him.
“Fireworks probably?” he hazards. “It’s almost Guy Fawkes day. They are probably some idiots setting things off a few days early.”
bring in the Battaglia family.
“Do it,” Harry said, not looking up. He kept staring at Draco instead, as if staring into his lifeless eyes would change what had happened. “I don’t care. I’ll go willingly.” He was numb. What difference would it make if he died now? Draco had gone and with him had gone all Harry’s future joy. He clutched Draco to him and didn’t even flinch when he heard the words,
“Really,” Massi says as the night winds down. “You should come. My father would love to meet you.” So they graciously accept. And it’s only in the morning that Draco realizes they will be walking into a den of vipers.
Because, yes, he
“You can talk to me, you know.” Harry looked sideways at him and watched as he chewed on his bottom lip. Harry brought his beer up to his mouth. He tilted his head back as he took a sip and then shifted his body so that he was siting closer to Draco. He waited for Draco to say something. He had the feeling that Draco would talk when he was ready - and if he didn’t want to talk that was fine too.
“But they were killed with a knife,” Pansy protests. “A wizard wouldn’t have done that. It’s too messy."
“Eh, fuck that, “ Draco said. “I’ll just hop back there and make you something.” He dropped Harry’s hand, suddenly realizing that people could most likely see them. He bit his lip and tried to see if anyone had been looking at them, but it was hard to tell in the darkened room. Circe, they needed to be more careful. They could be seen as friends, but nothing more.
“Mine.” He watches as they turn to face each other, each of them staring daggers at the other one. This is the office politics that Harry so desperately wanted to avoid. He looks down at his hands in his lap, willing them not to draw him into their dispute.
“You can see it too?” Pansy indicates the area on the map. Granger nods slowly.
“Draco,” he said softly. “It’s ok. I won’t be angry.”
“Sorry,” Draco says to his feet. “I just feel so bad about-“
They didn’t have to wait long for the information. Dumbledore called them all back to his office during the first week of March. The snow had finally started to melt and tiny blades of grass were pushing their way through in patches where it was thin enough. When they arrived, the office was entirely full of people, most of whom Harry recognized, including every single Hogwarts professor aside from Binns, but some of whom he did not.
“Snape,” Ron said. She frowned at him.
“Malfoy,” Granger’s voice snaps him to attention again.
“Books are a shelter from real life when real life gets tough. - Harry Potter,” reads the sign. Big Dick affixes it to the front of the fort. Draco looks around for Jamie and finds the other man staring daggers at them. Draco leans into Harry again once Big Dick has moved away.
Harry said nothing, only grunted and took a swig of whisky. “I wasn't sure how to bring it up earlier. And maybe this wasn't the best time, but I wanted to be honest with you while I had the courage to do it.”
“But Draco, you’ve already seen it. It charged you down in third year,” Blaise said.
“Why’s that?” Ron asked.
“Harry, there you are,” Ron said as he entered the 6
“Of course. It was the only time I ever felt more accomplished than you in school.”
you love him?” Pansy asks. She leans forward and stares at Draco. “And don’t change the subject this time.”
“You can’t sit with us!” Harry cried, his voice shrill. Draco raised an eyebrow, but didn’t say anything as he stood up and walked over to where Pansy and Blaise had just sat down. Harry felt a twinge of guilt, but he would explain it to Draco once they were alone in their private room. His stomach turned over in anticipation of being alone in their room and he marveled how how smitten he had become with Draco in the past few days. (But hadn’t he always
“Carrots?” Draco feels the warmth of his blush creep into his cheeks, and he does his best to keep his face neutral in spite of this.
He feels as light as a cloud by the time he walks into Flourish and Blotts, buoyed by holiday cheer and relief. He finds Draco towards the back of the shop, talking to Greg. He doesn’t look particularly busy, so Harry sidles up to them and then plants a kiss on Draco’s cheek. He wraps his arms around Draco from behind and Greg rolls his eyes.
“Sorry,” Harry says. “I accidentally took your wand.” He tosses it back to Massi, who fumbles to catch it.
“Well, it’s not like she has anywhere else to go,” Draco mumbled. “And she
“Thanks,” he said.
“Was it a
“Nose goes,” Harry said.
“Right then,” Blaise said once they had all taken a sip of their drinks and nodded appreciatively at Draco who had smiled in what was only somewhat of a condescending manner. “Rules.”
“Thanks.”
“That works,” Draco says. He briefly catches Harry’s eye and Harry gives him a small nod. He hopes he appears calm. He
True, Draco does have the fresh memories of Harry sucking him off, but this pales in comparison to his memories of their stolen night (and shower) at the start of the whole Reliquary adventure. But Draco will take what he can get, even if it hasn’t happened again.
“You should have let us have a proper breakfast then,” Potter says. She rolls her eyes at him and ignores the comment.
“Harry gave you his invisibility cloak and that ring, did he not?” Draco looked down and found the amulet still hanging around his neck.
Luca directs them like a choir master, waving his wand and occasionally calling out instructions. They have to stack most of the books by hand, due to the temperamental nature of the books, but they have been practicing so they go quite quickly. Draco applies his stabilizing spells to the books on the bottoms of the stacks and slowly but surely, a tower arises in the middle of the store.
“I’ve found a pile of papers on a table, McLaggen. That’s all. Please just tell me what’s going on.” Harry is getting tired of trying to talk around McLaggen’s feelings. He wants answers and he wants them now.
It doesn’t help that Draco can now picture Massi moving above him, crying out his name. Or that he had very much enjoyed it.
“We need answers,” Blaise said with a shrug.
“No, really, you're what? I missed it.” There was a smirk on Draco’s face that told Harry he was joking, but nevertheless, he said,
He should definitely learn that skill. Not only is he Granger’s campaign manager, the Joke shop’s lawyer but he’s also now Potter’s financial advisor because the git uses his galleons on renting enormous stadiums for a stupid amount of money and on every whim his heart desires. Potter says it’s because of the Dursleys. He knows it's because of them, Potter had told him how horrendous they were. He should have gotten elected at their district and done everything in his power to drive them out or better yet, hex their bits off when he visits them and be done with it.
Harry did the thing that made his heart stutter like a gormless berk. Grin so bright that it reaches his eyes, all signs of sleep depravity gone. He pecked Draco on the lips.” You could have just said you love me. God knows I do, to you.” Harry tightened his hold on Draco and sneaked a kiss on his forehead.
Any takers?  This is why he stayed at a Muggle community after charges against him as a Death Eater were dropped. They were after the big ones, not coerced teenagers like him. If they had, the Golden Trio and their merry band of Gryffindors who fought the war should've been tried, some of them for murder. The Order and Dumbledore's Army don’t exactly have legal standing, do they?  They're rebels who performed extrajudicial killings on people who absolutely deserved it but, who are they to be the judge, jury and executioner? The government would have lost all credibility then and reestablishing it from the ground up by a group of rebels is a whole can of worms nobody wanted to do and deal with at the time.
"I embarrass myself enough in front of you, pretty immune to it." He mumbled.
A grievance that blossomed back into his chest when he first saw Potter after so many years. Potter was still an insensitive, insufferable git who speaks before he thinks. He has told the berk to go home countless times. He was no help to Granger’s campaign. He takes up space in the office like that blasted dead plant he told Granger to throw out. He did admit that he has nowhere else to go and, he did not want to die of boredom while serving his suspension. Draco called him pathetic and ignored him after. He’s grateful that Weasley does have a stable job and only comes by during his break. But every time Weasley comes in, he has stories that he thinks are funny but are actually potential lawsuits waiting to happen.
The odds are definitely against her. Even he has a better chance at winning despite his track record. He's got the hair, the charm and the comeback story everyone's a sucker for. He’s that confident, no one can steal that away from him anymore.
He had a momentary lapse of judgement and agreed. The remnants of alcohol from last night's farewell party ( it was his last day in office and decided one term was enough) clouded his reasoning which should have made the agreement null and void. He wasn't in the right state of mind when Granger caught him unawares.
Which is something he regrets advising. Because then, Granger started calling him weekly, to help build her platform and give him unwanted updates on whatever it is she was doing. He often told her off when she began listing every single piece of cheese she wants to sink her teeth in.
And despite the storm he drove into, he hated that Granger was right.
Draco caught the finger. “I’m happiest with you.” He said with fake annoyance and pressed the finger to his lips.
Of course, he liked to prolong the inevitable, before his fate as a Death Eater was sealed but then threats of death and deadlines were sent out. He had to do it now, didn't he? Bare his fangs and be this caricature of a Death Eater.  Should he have been noble and chosen death? Maybe, but really, who else will truthfully say they'll choose such themselves knowing their bloody mum will follow them to their grave?
"I 'ave work, 'erret 'ace."
But he can do better. He has the finances. He was very transparent about where his money came from since he is a public figure. The official story is he inherited it from the multiple wineries they own at Saint Julien in Paris, which is the truth but it's not the only source of his money.   He invested in small businesses and donated to different causes. The masses of his electoral district loved him. He has the face and the hair for it. He was built for politics.
He glanced at the digital clock that Granger gifted him last month. She was beyond pissed whenever he was late for their meetings. But, hey, it's not his fault he isn't a morning person. Who arranges meetings at eight in the morning?
" What is it?" Harry opened his eyes just to glare at him.
Harry brushed a fringe of Draco’s hair " Come on.” He sighed. “ Now, I won't be able to sleep. Just great." His finger traced Draco’s nose and ended on his cheek, which he repeatedly poke while chanting
He's going to get it and nothing can stop him! Except that he wasn't going to leave Leeds and, he wasn't connecting his flat to a bloody floo. Fire upsets him. Granger had to pull special strings to get him his apparition licence right away. As much as it pained him to admit it, it filled him with glee. He got disgustingly sick during their apparition exam and after that, he never found the effort to do it. He lives in the Muggle world anyway. He's not going to pop in dingy alleyways that reek of piss. That's very uncivilized. Instead, he learned how to drive and bought himself a  nice automobile. Now, that's sophisticated.
He apparated into Granger's office and Salazar, he wished he hadn't. It was utter chaos. Too many books in too little space. Her desk was spilling with parchment paper and half a dozen coffee mugs. The chairs looked like they were fished out of the dumpster. A dead plant served as decor. This was unacceptable. This isn't a place to form strategies and greet constituents.
It was like he had a child he had to babysit because no daycare will take him in. Potter did provide him banter, dry commentary and the occasional thoughtful and substantive conversation. Dare he admit it, he’s grown to like Potter, accept his existence like that clicking on his shoulder when he twists it a certain way. He did enjoy Potter’s company but some of the things he does irritate him-- how he uses filler words when he’s uncomfortable (all he did was sling their arm together for a side-along), when he doesn’t clean the smudges on his glasses (he has to do it for him), when he insists Draco should try what he’s eating while offering a piece of it stabbed on his fork  (Does Potter not know the optics of that?), how he has this silver ring with a stripe of sapphire on his pointer finger and kisses it from time to time (Definitely unhygienic), and how he bites his cheek when Draco catches him staring (Potter doesn’t have to hold back his insults, he can take it).
"Suit yourself."  He shrugged.
to her pureblooded husband, if she can keep her emotions in check, and so and so. There's also the fact she has a bloody former Death Eater as her campaign manager!
So no, this wasn't for redemption. He's still a bastard who thinks Muggles are inferior and that's only because they can't perform magic, only this time he doesn't want them dead, not that he ever wanted it in the first place! Muggles and their destruction were the last thing in his mind when a certain somebody decided to squat in what used to be his home.  What he was on about is that their blood shouldn't mix with wizards and witches. Then he grew up and learned it's all pseudo-science--- see, they have science too--- that half-bloods and muggle-borns are less powerful than purebloods. Magic isn't stored in the blood, if it were, they should be eating... He doesn't know, uh Unicorns? To sustain whatever nutrient Magic requires. It's an ability. That's it. Some are lucky, some are not. It's like how he has an eidetic memory, a secret he never shared with anyone.
And fucking dammit, he should have kept his mouth shut. Not only is he Granger’s campaign manager, but he’s also now the Joke shop’s lawyer because apparently, they don’t have one, never thought of it. This time, he’s charging real galleons. He doesn’t care if this bankrupts the married couple. All they’ve given him is stress and Potter, who decided to tail him everywhere he goes because as established he doesn’t have anything better to do.
He traced circles on the back of Harry's hand with his thumb. " It's bloody unfair you don't remember things at three in the morning.", which is another grievance he holds dear to his heart.
Granger's crafty like that, like a little mouse rubbing her tiny dirty hands looking for a moment to attack the nice house kneezle. The only advice he gave her is that she needs to build a foundation first, be involved with the community and gain their trust. Even if she helped defeat the mad man, that does not mean she was automatically qualified. There's always an
If that wasn't bad enough, her team consists of Weasley and Potter. The idiot duo who can't tell which way was South. Weasley nodded at him while Potter did that thing awkward people do. Scratch the back of their head, bite their lip and say something trivial like
Draco carefully turned so he can face his partner. Harry kept his eyes closed. "Hey, Scarhead. Wake up." He whispered.
At the end of every voter thought. She mentioned she continued championing for Elf rights which he scolded her for and not because he doesn't think Elves don't deserve better conditions, but because elves can't vote. They don't win you seats. Why should wizards care about policies that do nothing for them? Unfortunately, only a small percentage would care for it. She didn't have to stop pushing for Elf rights but, she needs something for Wizards and witches too.
She'd argue and say there's nothing wrong with having a stance on every issue. He'd counter it with the fact that no one asked so why bother have a stance on the bloody thing.
He thought that'll be the end of it. He had forgotten how hard-headed Gryffindors are. They don't take no for an answer when they think the outcome will be for the better. Unlike Slytherin's who make certain from the very start that declining wasn't an option unless they are fit to receive the repercussions that came with it.
And when he gave her that blasted speech, her eyes glimmered and asked him to be her campaign manager with conviction. He declined. As far as he can tell, the wizarding world was still fucked up, purebloods were still in power with the occasional half-blood and a token muggle-born on the side. And Granger wants to mix a former Death Eater into the pot? No, thank you. He very much adored where he is now. He is happy here.
Granger never begged or bargained. He doesn't need the money anyway.  She only gave him a very long speech, cut into snippets as she visited him daily, how this will be great and why he is the one she needs. He argued she doesn't understand that he is happy with his life here. He was content and no amount of galleons or ego fluffing would change that.
“Black’s fine.”
“Draco, what the fuck is going on. Who are these guys that keep popping around. What did you do to them? Why do they care so much, and why do you look like a crying zombie everytime they come by? We are best friends, Draco, and I know you’re hiding something huge. What is so bad that you wouldn’t tell me?”
Draco sighed. Backwards from ten, Draco, backwards from ten.
. How did he
“What if’s are for when it’s all over, my darling. Now is the time to act,” she said, tugging at his clothes and brushing away the (for once non-imaginary) lint. She nodded at him once, opening the door to the infirmary.
Draco opened and closed his mouth like a fish, unable to think of a single response that wasn’t utterly stupid. Harry must have thought he was angry-- he stood up.
Sounds came roaring back almost as soon as he broke eye contact with his former nemesis, and Miriam was beside him in an instant.
If only.
“I believe your scrotty little friend here has something to tell you. Doesn’t he?” She shot Potter another menacing look, and Draco laughed at the sheer absurdity.
,” Draco boomed out in his best Ludo Bagman. “
“No! Well, I didn’t. I was at school. But my parents, they-- my father probably set the charge himself. My mother just served the fucking tea.” Draco spat out the last words. “I was at school, figuring out how to off the fucking Headmaster, my father was plotting mass genocide, and my mother making tea and trimming fucking roses.” He felt the urge to vomit come up again, tongue dabbing out to the salt on his lips.
He walked into the spring chill with a vague sense of unease. He’d never known what to do with himself besides working, and even more so now when everything in his life seemed utterly turned around. He had no real friends to call, besides Miriam--speaking of, he probably should call her to let her know there would be extra work.
“What’s a story?” Miriam’s eyes were soft, and Draco could tell she was pleased. Whatever scheme she was hatching up, it clearly involved the two of them getting along.
“Er-- coffee. Thanks.”
It was going to waste, to tell the whole truth. He’d tried dating, in the beginning, but he couldn’t stomach the lying required. He may not be using his talents in public, but life was much harder without hangover potions and scouring charms. He’d tried one-offs too, and found them exceedingly dull. He’d thrown himself fully into his work, and even Miriams sly, ‘aw, love, this is my mate Sean, sorry I gotta dash but next rounds on me yeah?’ had failed to turn up any actual possibilities.
“How can you.. Do you really think we can do it at all? Will this redeem us?” He said quietly. She stilled.
“Yeah, sorry, I used to be-- it’s scoliosis. Had to stop dancing but otherwise right as rain. It doesn't say that on my chart?” she asked, waving at the file in Weasley’s hand. His eyes got big.
Miriam.
“Now go on. Scuttle home before I throw you out myself.”
in your spine?” Weasley said loudly, and she nodded.
“We reformed Azkaban because that isn’t fair, Malfoy. You shouldn’t have to hide out here, without-- I mean, you’re one of the Sacred Twenty--”
“Oi! Draco! Did you even hear a word I said?” She said, arms crossed.
“I am dying. My daughter will not accept this. She is her mother’s child-- always has been. She refuses to see reason and will give others every chance to hurt her, over and over again. We cannot stop her.” Mr. Iida’s mouth was set in a grim line, and for the first time Draco truly remembered she was his daughter. He had only ever thought about it from Miriam's side, her father an old hard taskmaster to be obeyed and respected, reluctantly or otherwise. It had never occurred to him that everything that broke his heart about his best friend would break her father's as well. “She is headstrong, and we both know telling her what to do will only cause her to draw further away. I am the only family she has left-- soon, it will be you.”
, he says. BLAND! One of our savories.
“So he helped you get out? Is that when we met?” she asked. He shook his head, wiping his face and grimacing.
“Miriam!” he said throwing her a scathing look, and she just continued laughing, standing up with some difficulty.
??” Miriam’s eyes were so wide, Draco couldn’t help the smile that came out.
“And are you distracted now?”
She brushed his tears with her handkerchief.
. Fold. Fold--
His mother sat in silence for a moment, pensive as she stared out into the rose garden.
He’d fallen into this line of work completely by accident-- Miriam had been one of his first friends after his release, and the only one to stick. She was a shag gone upside down, when Draco didn’t know himself, stopping halfway because he was ‘somewhere else’ and making herself a cheese toastie Draco could still taste. She’d been his guide when it was all too new and too terrifying, armed with a fierce brightness Draco adored.
