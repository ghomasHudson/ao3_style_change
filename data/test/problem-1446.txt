A heavy silence hung around the table. Ron abruptly stood and clapped his hands together, startling everyone else. “Okay, that’s enough, we have stuff to do. Malfoy, you said you brought some books; look through them for diagnostic charms, and, I don’t know, try to learn them? Oh, and sit with Harry — even if you’re not doing anything, your magic is good for him, right? The rest of us will look through the library for more books on healing for a couple of hours, and then…I guess you can practice the spells on Snape.”
“You don’t have to go out of your way to embarrass me further, Hermione,” Harry grumbled, deliberately not looking at the entrance.
“Well, they’re better than none. Do we know what the death eaters are doing?” Remus asked, and all heads turned to Severus.
Whenever he moved his hands above his head, a sliver of skin appeared just under the jumper as it rose up - despite being too big for him, Harry
he had to keep his cover, in case he could provide any useful information to the Order. The Dark Lord really needed to be taken down.
“I didn’t tell you everything about the afterlife. There was one thing that I wanted to keep private, but…you need to know.”
“Oh come on, get on with it.” Harry rolled his eyes as Draco’s gaze flicked from his face, and back to the cut, still not making any move to do the spell. “Scared, Malfoy?”
Harry had, surprisingly, enjoyed sitting next to Draco yesterday. He hadn’t realised how much he missed sarcasm until talking to him. Not to mention, despite the fact that they’d barely even talked, he’d felt more like a part of a conversation than he ever did with Ron and Hermione.
, Draco thought, thinking back to the conversation he’d overheard when fetching food from the kitchen.
“Alright.” Potter shrugged. “Do you want to cast or shall I?” His voice was not only gravelly but also monotone, as if he was occluding.
Since then, they’d all been hiding out at an old Black safehouse a few miles from Malfoy Manor, deep in a forest. No one had come knocking, so they’d figured this one, at least, was probably safe for the time being.
Draco tried his best not to scream, though he wasn’t sure if he’d succeeded, for all he knew was the pain — his skin was being flayed and his organs were being poached, and all he wanted was it to stop, just for a moment.
Malfoy smoothly cut him off. “Not that I don’t agree with you, but we have other matters to attend to. Severus, I thought since he was awake, I should do the diagnosis charm that shows his magical core.”
He grinned - a huge, unrestrained smile that lit up his entire face. “I don’t think you need any glamours today.”
“Me? Die? Never.” Harry’s voice — what was left of it — trailed off before he could finish the last word. His eyes were so heavy...maybe a little nap.
“Anyway, I normally have nightmares about Dumbledore being killed, or other people I care about. But last night, I was forced into that position.”
He sprinted across the grassy park, thanking his good luck, as every time he felt the need to turn around to check a spell was flying towards him with just enough time to deflect or dodge them.
“Of course I’m ready.” Fleur flicked her hair and rolled her eyes, but Remus didn’t miss the slight tremor in her voice, and from the look of Bill’s arm around her shoulders, neither did he.
Draco, as opposed to being the proud pure blood, was gaping like a fish until this point, when he reached out to take the wand from Potter’s hand. He jerked back with the wand as their fingertips brushed together. He cast a cleaning charm on Potter’s glasses (which were irritating him So. Much.), who didn’t so much as flinch, as he should have when being cast at by a death eater, but rather smiled softly, and said “Cheers, Malfoy.”
It was the first time Draco had featured prominently in his dreams as well - but that wasn’t particularly important. Other people had featured in the same position before.
“Of course you can, Harry. Isn’t this house fascinating? There are so many different breeds of Nargles inhabiting the walls — likely due to the age of the furniture…”
She didn’t seem convinced, but couldn’t question him as the new Defence Professor beckoned them inside.
“How soon can we get him out?” Draco’s skin had taken on a grey tinge, and he was resting his head on the tiled wall. He was clearly in no shape to be breaking old classmates out of dungeons. Not to mention, they didn’t know when the rest of the death eaters would be back — and fighting hoarders of death eaters with an unconscious Potter wouldn’t be good. Not to mention, this would blow their cover, so they’d have to time it
Harry had got back into bed, but at least he’d taken one of the croissants. Draco smiled and vanished all but two, one of which he ate (due to barely eating the entire day from worry) and one of which he left on the plate alongside the food he’d brought up from dinner. He checked the bond again, asking Harry
He was pretty sure they’d been flirting throughout the lesson - Draco grasping his wrist to make him do the correct wand movement, overly sultry expressions being sent through the bond. But it could easily be viewed as banter between friends - so Harry ignored any impulses he had, ignored growing warmth in his chest at the sparkle in Draco’s eyes.
Severus rolled his eyes. “No, Mr Weasley, Draco will have to be the one to cast the diagnostic spells until we know who’s magic is compatible with Potter’s.”
“Finally - what did I feel through the bond, who hurt you?” Harry stepped back, looking at Draco, who was shocked at this behaviour from Harry. “Why don't you look hurt? I felt-“
A wave of grief washed over him, dragging him down, into that place where he hid all his emotions. Wrapping his arms around him, Harry tucked his head inwards, barely feeling the tears falling into his lap through the sea of emotion.
wasn’t happening; he was back with his old, yew wand, which did serve him better, even if it made his magic feel weaker, after Dumbledore’s wand. A quick flick of his wand had the inferi he’d hidden pouring out into the hallway, which was too narrow for any sort of fire to be used without the risk of hurting allies. He ordered them to attack all but him and Potter — Potter was
He considered feeding the children to Nagini, but she was quite happily sleeping upstairs at that moment in time. Easier to just get Lucius to dispose of them.
He flopped down onto his bed and took three, shaky breaths, staring at the red hangings in an attempt to calm down. He looked around at his new permanent residence - there was
“You couldn’t make it easy, could you.”  Voldemort sneered in disgust, before delicately pinching Harry’s nose so he had to open his mouth, before pouring a potion down his throat. Harry spluttered and coughed, moving more than he had in days. Apparently that was good enough for Voldemort, who swiftly left the cell.
Draco covered his shock with a smirk; since when did Potter call him Draco? No matter - he could still talk. He thought, anyway. “And why would I do that? My voice is much nicer than yours; and I make such good points.”
“Hermione?” He screwed his face up as he turned over, and Hermione grimaced. He had dark shadows under his eyes, his cheeks were slightly hollow (expected since he hadn’t eaten in a while) and his hair was limp.
Harry glared at Voldemort, his green eyes burning with untamed fury. As Voldemort’s facial expression didn’t drop the sneer, Harry figured that it was more trouble than it was worth and started to write, internally wondering how to drop a hint about where he was that would both get past Voldemort and Lucius, and wouldn’t result in them getting killed.
“I — okay. Start on this book.” She scourgefied the smallest of the books so dust wouldn’t fly into Ron’s face, before thrusting it in his lap and beginning to read her own.
“Not to mention, a perm would deflate immediately under the water unless you waited a couple of days.” Seamus added, earning a couple of weird looks.
After getting dressed in silence, Harry decided to finally break the silence. He couldn’t deal with all the silent tension in the air. “I can’t believe I promised Hermione that I would actually go down to breakfast. At the Gryffindor table.”
Remus raised an eyebrow before looking at Bill, who’s shoulders were shaking with silent laughter. “Sure. The ones we used in school probably weren’t the nicest spells, and in any case, it’s not the severity of the spell, but rather the way you use them. A simple wingardium leviosa can be used to drop someone out of a window. Or throw knives at them.”
Weasley and Granger physically jumped, and Severus huffed lightly. “Perhaps this wasn’t the best place to have this conversation, Miss Granger.”
Moody mostly spent his time making sure Mundungus didn’t fuck everything up, which was a full time job that only someone with Moody’s magical eye could achieve. He also went to Kingsley from time to time, because despite his extremely anti–death eater stance, he hadn’t been put on the wanted list. The most popular theory behind this was all the death eaters were too scared to go after him.
Secondly, I have plans to do another fic after this that will have deleted scenes, including a couple from this time skip :)
“I can’t believe you’re ordering me around,” Severus replied, but his hand left Draco’s shoulder. He was likely happy to have something to do that wasn’t looking at Potter’s emaciated form.
“If you could stop gloating for a second…” Hermione glared at Ron, who shut up and made a ‘go on’ gesture at her.
However, Harry started as he heard different footsteps. They were faster than Lucius’ leisurely stalk, with soles that made clicking sounds against the stone floor.
Looking outside again, he noticed it was dark. How long had it been dark for? A tempus revealed it was half an hour before curfew - maybe he could make the effort to be back in his dorm on time.
After writing every day since she’d started back at Hogwarts, Ginny suddenly stopped writing in the notebook in November. Remus only just convinced everyone else to
Just as Harry was about to doze off, his eyes slowly closing, something caught his eye. He blinked. And blinked again.
A grin broke across Draco’s face whenever he thought of that - not only that Harry felt comfortable enough with him to even consider stealing his food, but that he was eating that little more than usual.
“Why did you want to talk to me?” She purposely kept her face neutral, watching Draco’s eyes nervously dart back and forth, his hand rise to reveal badly bitten nails before falling again as he caught himself.
Kreacher had been very helpful - he always seemed to know what Harry had needed, whether it be a cup of chamomile tea (it tasted disgusting, but always calmed him down), a hot meal, or something to blow up. Harry had especially enjoyed blasting the wall which Walburga Black’s portrait had been on, and Kreacher had been surprisingly amicable to Harry destroying some Black family heirlooms. Of course, he insisted on keeping some, but there were many even Kreacher had found distasteful - the first things to go had been the decapitated house elf heads that had once lined the stairs.
He’d hoped that maybe he and Ron could be civil, but it was true that over the course of their school years, they’d done —
Next to Remus and Sirius was Peter, looking better than he had whilst in service to Voldemort. Not that that was a surprise. His small, watery eyes looked adoringly at the other Marauders - had he been in service to Voldemort at this time? He had to have been a surprisingly good actor - but then again, to be their friend, Peter must have been surprising. He’d managed to become an animagus, after all.
Bill bit his lip, before counting on his fingers as he listed people. “Well, there’s everyone in this room other than Ginny, who’s still underage,” Ginny glared at him, “some aurors — Kingsley will know who isn’t under the imperius. Some Hogwarts Professors — McGonagall, Flitwick, Sprout, Hooch, and so on. There’s also the people in hiding or on the run — the Tonks family, Moody, Diggle, Doge, Podmore, Fletcher…” Severus sneered at the name. Mundungus Fletcher was useful, sure, but he was also a lying, stealing
At first they’d been just that - screams - and that had been bad enough; Draco would have done anything to stop those screams.
Draco grimaced — he’d seen no sight nor sound of the old man in the last three weeks of term. Since Potter had disappeared, in fact. They were probably gallivanting together somewhere. Hopefully cooking up a plan to murder the red–eyed man in front of him.
Harry’s ears strained to hear anything past the footsteps, but only got a whisper of robes before he felt the cut on his cheek reopen. Another swish, and the end of a wand lit up, illuminating the face of Bellatrix Lestrange.
I’m not hungry. Harry felt a pang of guilt at the reply, but reminded himself just how much he hated people coddling, and decided to talk to Draco when he got back.
Harry braced himself for an interrogation from the rest of the Gryffindors as he sat down, but none of them said a word, rather sending ‘knowing’ nods and smiles his way. Harry smiled weakly in return, not sure what was going on but not wanting to stop it. A couple of people opened and closed their mouths, and each time Harry turned to see either Draco or Hermione staring daggers at them.
Draco sighed and snaked his arm around Harry, pulling him into his side. “What do you want to do at Christmas?”
He had been a bit tipsy after the Three Broomsticks, but the rain had sobered him up pretty much immediately. He’d been quite grumpy - as anyone would be, being soaked to the bone in a matter of seconds. He’d stormed off to the castle, quite forgetting Harry was still attached to him until he’d registered the tugging at his arm.
A small funeral was held the next day in the back garden of the Burrow, where Tonks’ body was lain in fresh earth. Several people delivered moving eulogies, but no one had really gotten over their grief when they had to get to work.
“Well, I suppose this won’t be much of a change.” Voldemort twirled his wand between his fingers, before grasping it properly and snarling
of them had come was important in itself. His mother indulged him in little touches — a hand on his shoulder, or at the small of his back, and his father smiled weakly, but proudly, at Draco when he thought no one was watching.
from the other end of the bond, eventually sprinting back up to the dorms with the need to check on Harry. He walked into their completely silent room and was greeted by closed drapes, which, to Draco’s dismay, were spelled against him. They’s been spelled so they were hard and couldn’t be moved aside, the wards impossible for Draco to unravel. After half an hour of pleading down the bond (which he was quite sure Harry didn’t hear anyway), literal yelling and attempting to unravel the spells surrounding the bed, Draco left the croissants he’d snatched from the hall before settling at the desk and reading. At least he’d know if Harry ate.
“Well I’ve got a few diagnosis charms written down here,” Hermione hurried over to the other side of the room, extracting copious amounts of parchment from the pile of books, “although I’m not sure which would be best.” Severus walked over and peered down at the paper, and after a moment’s hesitation M–Draco went too. As they all looked at the paper, Hermione asked, “and regarding the healing charms — you know some, don’t you Severus?”
“Okay, but don’t be tactless.” At this point, the couple turned into the Great Hall. Draco considered following them, but there was a much higher chance of an invisible person being discovered in the crowded Hall than the relatively empty corridors. He dodged a group of Hufflepuffs and headed down to the kitchens. Despite the business of lunch, the elves were all too happy to provide Draco with food, and he left with an extremely heavy basket under the cloak. He didn’t know what was inside, but the elves’ cooking was excellent, and whatever was in the Hall smelled good.
It was odd, to see how the dynamic around the Dark Lord changed without Severus. The Dark Lord, for one, seemed a lot more insecure; he was always briefly looking to his right, which was where Severus used to stand. However, this was always followed by a round of
“Of course, my Lord.” Bellatrix turned in a flurry of robes, quickly returning with something silver. The Dark Lord held it out to Draco, who knelt before him, staring at polished shoes and trying not to vomit.
Harry shook his head. Draco seemed perfectly content when he’d left - but Harry couldn’t hurt him. He put the books back and got some on occlumency - he’d failed terribly when Snape tried to teach him, but perhaps now that he was motivated towards a goal he would pick it up quicker. Not that keeping Voldemort out of his mind wasn’t a good goal, but the link had proved more helpful than not.
He pinched himself on the arm for good measure - failing to wake up, Draco decided to come to terms with the fact that Harry had just called him cute.
Potter turned to face Draco, holding a hand out. Draco took it, his palms a bit sweaty as he looked at Potter’s profile (ever the Saviour), and stood in a smooth motion as he was pulled up.
Malfoy’s voice was a lot closer than Harry was expecting it to be. He wearily cracked open one eye, not really getting much information other than the fact that there was an angry, pale smudge hovering above him.
Harry nodded in agreement, jumping slightly as Draco’s knee knocked against his own under the table as he sat down.
Draco’s eyes widened with realisation, his lips thinning before looking around. Everyone was getting out of their seats and levitating the desks to the side. Harry and Draco followed suit, glad that they had a corner seat as they could watch everyone else.
It did, sooner than Draco had expected. “Be grateful, Draco. Your Lord is feeling merciful despite your...misdemeanours.” He held out one of his feet expectantly.
It turned out that the people working in the archives were more than happy to provide some hair and take the day off, on the condition that the Order at least
They didn’t do much that day, spending most of their time anxiously checking up on the sleeping werewolf on the sofa. Bill sent a patronus to the twins asking for a healing potion when they come back, but other than that he just stared at a book, not turning the page. Ginny did…
She’d been marched into the cold, dank dungeons that apparently had cells, and been chained to the wall, along with the rest her classmates, not really knowing what to expect. She’d told them about the second years’ plan, but they weren’t convinced that they could use it here — surely the Carrows would torture them themselves?
Harry grimaced, already feeling the potion working its magic, once again shivering as he fell into a restless sleep.
,” Dumbledore added as Harry opened his mouth to object. “You must keep your wand out, in case Voldemort comes before we’ve got the horcrux. I need you to force me to drink it, even if I say no. You
Harry lightly huffed, before crouching and starting on the bruises on his legs. There weren’t many, and none of then were
Otters made of fire sprung out of her wand, and engulfed the small bag. Ron thought he heard screaming, and tightened his grip on Hermione’s hand, but didn’t apparate them away.
“Excellent job, Draco.” Draco’s father gestured behind, to the destruction Draco had tried to detach himself from.
“Severus? No, that’s weird.” Bill frowned, before grinning in delight as Ron walked in. He immediately ran over, wrapping him in a hug.
“I’ll get the ingredients, since you will definitely get ones that are inferior. Half fill the cauldron with water and get it bubbling” Draco ordered, not giving him a chance to reply as he stalked off with a robe-swish worthy of Snape himself.
The next thing Draco knew, he was lying in Harry’s lap, his arm in a bowl of...something. Harry was murmuring under his breath “how could you be so stupid, you could have died, thank Merlin you had some dittany and murtlap...”
“Number eight being irritating me when I’m anywhere near...anything. Walls are excellent for cracking people’s heads open, but floors will do in a pinch.” Millie smirked.
His mouth had gone dry at the sight of the expanse of skin - he’d never fully registered it before, but Draco, for all his pointiness, was graceful and willowy - long, delicate limbs, slim but covered with a layer of muscle. He was embarrassed when Draco had asked if he was “enjoying the view” because he, well, was. He’d dutifully healed the bruises on Draco’s legs, and finally asked Draco who’d done it. Not because he didn’t know - he’d committed the names he’d seen on the map to memory - but because he wanted to know what Draco thought. He was back to his old self - despite only being in his underwear, he had his head held high and his back was straight. He hadn’t said their names, claiming he didn’t know - which was viable, since Harry hadn’t known either - and he’d gone to sit on the bed, put his head in his hands. This was no time for Draco to have a hero complex. Harry wasn’t going to go after them, if Draco didn’t want him to.
Harry might have observed more had he not suddenly had to yawn. Draco immediately stiffened, his shoulders dropping and neck lengthening, his fingers abruptly stopping their movements, his mouth closing.
. I promised your mother I’d keep you alive at all costs, and that does not include breaking random people out of the dungeons!”
“Fine, so I’ve been sitting with him and calling him his actual name. What does that have to do with anything? I do the same with you guys and I’m not shagging either of you!” Harry shuddered at the thought - he loved them both dearly but it would be like incest. “You agreed to look out for him in arithmancy and ancient runes, does that mean you’re shagging him?”
Now, he didn’t know what to think about Draco knowing. He knew why the nightmare had suddenly occurred - other than when he was at primary school, the Dursley’s didn’t feel the need to give him clothes other than some boxers, resulting in many cold nights under the stairs. That’s why now, he always had to wear a full set of pajamas - or at least joggers and a t-shirt. Wearing Draco’s shirt yesterday, it had been so soft it felt like he wasn’t wearing a shirt - hence the flashback to the Dursley’s.
“Thank you, for…you know. Saving me and stuff.” As the sudden burst of energy receded, Harry found himself overcome to climb into a bed — preferable a soft one, with a thick duvet, and maybe a hot water bottle — and sleep for a week.
Draco found that, looking across to the other side of the bond, Harry had somehow figured out occlumency over the course of the day. Draco had looked when he’d felt
your decision! I am almost of age, and can make my own decisions, so if I need to go back to Hogwarts — which I
“I think something is wrong. Harry wouldn’t go this long without sending us another letter, and Dumbledore
— it didn’t take Tonks back to the Ministry, but it did take Umbridge to the woods. Both women fell to the ground in a heap, and the ensuing duel left cracks and craters in the ground, deep gashes marking the surrounding trees. They were surprisingly evenly matched, Umbridge becoming more and more vicious with each spell, but dropping her guard slightly. Tonks waited patiently on the defensive, looking for the opening to stun Umbridge, when a loud
“The bank ledgers. They’re on the fourth floor — hidden, of course, but not very well. They have records of everything in the Black vaults and, somehow, every family we’ve married into. So all the pureblood accounts, basically. If Bellatrix has something in one of her accounts, you’ll be able to see there.”
One useful thing that had come out of their research was a spell to remove marks infused with dark magic. Hermione and Ron had immediately sprinted down to Severus, whose face had lit up in a rare show of positive emotion. Remus had walked in, looked at the spell and immediately volunteered to do the spell. He’d estimated five days, just to be sure, since he wouldn’t get any practice rounds.
“Finally! I thought we were over the whole Potter-stalking, but evidently not.” She rolled her eyes and started making two cups of tea.
Draco groaned and flopped backwards on the bed, hands clasped on his stomach. “I cannot be fucking arsed.”
During the night, the nightmares seemed to be better as well - they spoke to each other through the bond, knowing that the other was there, which made the entire situation not enjoyable, exactly, but a lot better. Neither of them got an unbroken night’s sleep, but they often fell asleep draped over each other after waking up from the nightmare. Neither of them discussed this, in fear of forcing their own feelings upon the other.
Malfoy blood — that meant Malfoy — Draco — could get him out. Harry doubted that the Malfoy heir would be so generous, but perhaps with a bit of manipulation. Lucius must have seen the spark of hope in Harry’s eyes, and he chuckled.
Harry hung off the side of his bed, searching underneath for a pyjama top. Every night, the one he was wearing the night before had disappeared, and he’d gone from five overly large t-shirts filled with holes to no overly large t-shirts filled with holes.
“While we’re here, we might as well start calling everyone by their first names. Just…to provide a nicer atmosphere?” Everyone glared at Hermione, but she glared right back. “Come on, don’t be children. We’re all of age, we can act like adults for a little while
Grey eyes flickered down and back up, before Draco leaned in and kissed Harry. It was barely a brush of lips against lips, but Harry froze, panicking.
Are you guys proud of me? Only one week between these two updates! I'm hoping to keep that up for chapters 15 and 16 :)
“Well, I’m glad you came back. As are Ron, and Hermione, and the rest of the wizarding world. Just remember that, and never think otherwise.” Harry smiled up at Draco, before turning and leaning into his side, eating some bread. Draco took some too, and eventually the pair ended up asleep like that, legs tangled together.
Hermione’s smile had grown wider. “Draco, you really didn’t have to do that; bringing Harry back to us was all the apology we needed, and it showed that your allegiances had truly changed. I forgave you a while ago, but the apology was appreciated nonetheless.” Draco inclined his head as Hemione nudged Ron with her elbow.
, stepping through the doorway and sobbing at the sight in front of him. Draco was slumped on the floor, a bloody knife in his right hand, blood pouring from his left. Walking over, Harry almost threw up at the sight in the sink - a neatly cut patch of skin, clearly depicting the dark mark. Harry pushed the nausea down - Draco needed him, now was no time for panicking.
When Harry and Draco rolled to a stop, Harry was lying on top of Draco, his head on Draco’s chest. He pushed himself up with one side on either side of Draco’s chest, grunting “stop wiggling, you little shit.”
“Yeah, that’s great. If you want, once all this is over, you can spend some time documenting them, or something.”
They always sat together at the back of the classroom, talking through their bond and not really drawing attention to themselves. Draco was doing one more NEWT than Harry (he wasn’t doing runes at all, it turned out, just very complex arithmancy), so Harry generally spent that time in their room, harassing Draco through the bond with questions his homework or whining
“Contemplating life and all its contents. And how messily you eat.” Harry replied, the corners of his lips twitching at the outrage written across Draco’s face.
“Well, now that thats sorted, the second topic of today: Hogwarts. Can you fill us in?” Remus asked McGonagall, who’d been sitting quietly with the rest of the professors while plans for the Ministry were made.
“Then what are you going to tell her?” Ron was fully awake now, and half risen off the sofa as if he was under the impression that he could single-handedly stop Hermione from storming off to McGonagall’s office.
Draco couldn’t remember dreaming that night, although he was very convinced he’d woken up to a nightmare.
“Speaking of damage,” Remus cut in, preventing Harry from assuring Hermione that his plan was very logical, thank you very much, “we should probably check for any unseen injuries.”
Harry, Hermione, Draco, Severus, Remus and Narcissa all went into the Manor, looking for Voldemort. It was surprisingly easy; he was
“I tried to recruit some werewolves, but they really just want to be left alone. They’re not fighters, and the best we’ve got is that they’ve said they won’t go to You–Know–Who’s side.” Remus added.
He had a letter from Charlie sitting on the table beside him, which he kept skimming to make sure that he hadn’t missed anything. The general gist was that the Romanians were reluctant to travel to England to participate in a war that hadn’t quite started, but they were willing to send supplies and provide shelter for people in need, if they could make it there. Some colonies in Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria were also saying they’d help with temporary food and shelter as well. Fleur had sent letters to her contacts in France and Germany, but she was confident that they would also be willing to help. The wizarding populations in other European countries, while secretive, were actually very friendly and helpful, contrary to popular belief.
“For Potter’s dick,” Blaise muttered under his breath. Draco turned to glare at him, but didn’t deny it.
Harry reached up to wipe his mouth, immediately staring at his arm in surprise. “That’s fast acting.” He grinned — his voice was by no means back to normal, but it was ten times better than before. It suddenly occurred to him that he’d just been rescued by the two people he’d hated most at Hogwarts. Other than Umbridge. And Crouch Junior. And Quirrell. Still quite high up.
Harry sighed inwardly, stiffly making his way over to the fridge to get his ingredients. He cracked the eggs over the hob, burning his hands and wrists as he was too short to reach the pan properly. He put the bread in the toaster, making eight slices with a sliver of hope that maybe, maybe he’d get some.
Draco dragged himself up to his room, first immersing himself in transfiguration homework and then ancient runes, determinedly ignoring the pulses of content from the other end of the bond.
into Draco’s mind, already raising his glass to his lips. They each downed what was left, pulling near identical faces at the burn.
Draco’s eyelid twitched, but he didn’t move from his kneeling position. Clever boy — maybe there was hope for him yet.
I’m going to spend the next week writing headcanons and short fics on tumblr, so if you have any requests please send them :)
Draco joined them for dinner, nobody looking particularly surprised, integrating Draco into their conversations quite easily. Once, Harry was asked a question he didn’t have an answer to, and he felt his heart rate rising, his palms sweating. He needn’t have worried, however, as Draco smoothly inserted himself into the conversation and drawing the focus away from Harry, nudging Harry slightly with his knee as he did so. Harry would have thought it accidental except he knew Draco calculated his every move in public - there weren’t huge differences, but to Harry, Draco was clearly different here compared to how he was in the dorm.
“Little shit.” Lucius sneered one last time before sweeping up the stone stairs. Harry rolled his eyes, shivering violently as the obtrusive prickle of magic left, leaving him with a bone deep chill despite it being the height of summer.
Remus watched as Ginny and Fleur hurled hexes at each other across the sand. They’d been at it for fifteen minutes, and Remus had watched as the fight had gotten increasingly hostile; at first, Fleur had been reluctant to fully attack the sixteen–year–old, but Ginny hadn’t held back in the slightest, forcing Fleur to go on the defensive. Now, Fleur was back on the offensive, and using a technique unlike any Remus had seen before — likely something she’d learned at Beauxbatons. He analysed both of their movements — both unorthodox, both skilled — and made some mental notes on how they could improve. Ginny was outmatched by a
These people were attacking the wrong person, Draco hadn’t killed their families. If Harry had been a little quicker...perhaps they needn’t have died.
, Harry thought, but judging by Ron and Hermione’s sympathetic looks, they knew what he’d left unsaid.
Ron bristled at Hermione’s side. “Mum, Hermione’s smart and almost always right.” Hermione bit back a response of ‘mostly?’. “If she’s got a suspicion, we should probably listen.”
“Ah, well, he’s not the best teacher. Anyway, clear your mind - there can’t be much going on up there anyway - “ Harry rolled his eyes, “and feel inwards. Towards the back, there should be a rope. I’m going to try and send something over now, since I know how to find it.” Draco stared at the wall behind Potter, reaching into his mind with ease. He found the glowing rope - it was glowing brighter, and less tense than before - and looked towards the other end. Potter’s mind was wreathed in shadow and pain, but now he could see something inside. He knew his own mind appeared as a sixteenth century castle - weathered stone walls, surrounded by a glittering, blue moat, mist the same colour as his eyes hanging around the top. His mother had shown him the memory in the pensieve when she’d done legilimency to test his occlumency.
“Today is the anniversary of my parents’ death. I wanted to be alone.” Harry shrugged, trying to appear as nonchalant as his ‘dreadful’ appearance would allow.
All at once, the pain stopped. “Interesting. So we can cast at you, but you can’t cast at us.” Voldemort lazily flicked his wand at Harry, causing a deep cut to appear on his cheek, before leaving.
“Only in the summer. The amount of warming charms this place needs in the winter…it’s going to be a right pain.” Bill smiled softly. “Oh, and Fleur will be the caster, I’m here if something goes wrong, and Ginny is lookout.”
“Grimmauld…” Snape sighed. “I remember it, but it’s under a fidelius, so I can’t apparate there. Since you’re technically the ‘master’ of the house, the fidelius doesn’t affect you, so you’d be able to apparate us, except…”
She put her wand back in her holster, and palmed two knives from seemingly nowhere. Her grin grew, showing far too many teeth. She threw the two knives in quick succession, the sharp blades easily cutting through his clothes and leaving two deep scratches either side of his ribcage.
After getting comfortable, stretching out his legs underneath the table, Potter said “It’s okay to sit here, right?”
He sighed and slowly made his way to the cells. Hopefully Lucius would know to be quick — he wanted this over and done with. He didn’t want them letting slip about his secrets to his followers — they just don’t need to know.
“Mate, what are you doing?” the Weasel muttered out of the corner of his mouth, the effect ruined by the volume of his voice.
Bill rocked back on two legs of his chair, before Fleur slapped him on the shoulder and glared at him, so he rolled his eyes and the front two legs fell down with a clatter. It was easy for Severus to forget, but really, they were all still
Harry’s neck cracked as he lifted his head, blinking blearily at the figures outside his cell. There were two - one of them was probably Lucius, to open the door.
Regardless, there was one specific, forgotten loophole in all magic, that “rather liked to screw everything up”, in Severus’ words: True Love. Not a small crush, or most of the forms shown in the stories; pure, unfiltered, romantic love could be harnessed to remove or cancel out most curses placed upon a being. This meant that somebody who truly loved Harry could kill him. But then there was the issue of requiring hatred to use the killing curse.
Draco sighed - now was not the time to be arguing about Harry’s self-sacrificing instincts. Never mind the fact that he was putting himself in situations that were likely going to result in a panic attack.
A quick glance around the room didn’t yield much information to Draco, so he cleared his mind before non-verbally conjuring a glass, and filling it with water, before banishing the lot.
He cast a quick tempus, which revealed it was 7:30 on the dot. He whipped off his thick duvet, gritting his teeth at the cold air, and after a quick shower flicked a hex at Blaise that would get his lazy arse out of bed. He pulled on a pair of soft, woollen, charcoal trousers and a green, cashmere sweater which matched the drapes on his bed. He then pulled on thick socks and dragonhide boots before firing a second hex at Blaise, who finally got out of bed muttering a string of varied curses, some of which impressed Draco - he was sure Blaise had a book filled with them.
“Freak.” The fat man spat at Harry, sliding the belt through the loops on his trousers without even cleaning it. He went back into the house with a smile on his face, saying something - Draco couldn’t hear - and the family happily left, leaving Harry on the floor. His eyes were glassy, staring at nothing, his back bled freely and a feeling of hopelessness engulfed Draco, as he tried one more time to go to Harry, to comfort him,
“Yeah.” Remus pasted on a weak smile and summoned some bacon and eggs, quickly frying them for the rest of the family. After years of living alone, he was quite adept at it — even if his
He closed his eyes and accepted his death — everyone else had gotten out with the files, and while his family had suffered enough losses, all would be well without him — but apparently Percy had other ideas, hurtling around the corner and tackling him to the floor, the green light barely missing their heads.
“Blaise, no.” Draco glared at Blaise, still irritated from the quidditch comment. It wasn’t that dangerous!
Draco muttered something under his breath - Harry couldn’t quite hear, but chuckled all the same. “Come on, let's get back to Hogwarts. Sun’s going to set soon anyway.”
The group shared a collective sigh. One of the aurors — Daniel — picked up Tonks, and said, “She got the files, at least. They’re tucked inside her robes.” Everyone felt relieved, but no one felt like celebrating their success. Everyone apparated away, and Bill side–alonged Percy.
A couple of weeks into September, they’d officially run out of books. Surprisingly, it had been Ron that suggested that they tell Draco and Severus — since the apology, Ron had grown increasingly close to Draco, mostly over a chessboard Draco had brought from the Manor. Ron had pointed out that neither of the Slytherins had done anything remotely untrustworthy — in fact, both had done everything in their power to help Harry, above and beyond what the Gryffindors would have asked. And Severus had never been that bad in school, in hindsight.
Draco ended up going back to the common room with half a loaf of sliced, crusty bread, a lot of butter and practically a cauldron of soup, packed into a basket with extension and stasis charms. Draco cast a featherlight charm on it before taking it back up to the common room.
After eating his fill (one muffin and half of a piece of bread) Harry closed his draped and resumed his vigil of staring at the wall.
Harry chuckled softly as Draco nodded serenely, before stopping dead at a large, marble gravestone. It stood out from the rest of the dark stones, a beacon in the dark graveyard. Upon it, the words were inscribed, as if they’d only been carved yesterday
“They can make a miraculous comeback!”), and Ron wasn’t glaring at Draco at all, which was more than Harry could have ever hoped for.
Confusing as it had been, he’d never felt such dread as when he’d seen Draco shakily lower his wand, Voldemort whispering into his ear. He couldn’t move, couldn’t say a word, couldn’t do anything except attempt to convey his acceptance that yes, he must die, so Draco could live.
“I’ll teach him,” Snape volunteered, and Draco visibly relaxed. They quickly started discussing diagnosis and healing charms, and Harry tuned out their conversation. Ron cast a glance at them and shook his head, dragging a chair about halfway across the room.
Harry clearly figured that nothing else was coming out of Draco, so he started talking instead. “I had a really weird nightmare last night. It was on the astronomy tower - I was there that night, under my invisibility cloak.”
“I’ll cast Potter, since you have the delicacy of a Hippogriff in my mother’s china cabinet.” The corner of Potter’s mouth twitched before his face went neutral again.
Not seeing any reason to reply, Harry marched out of the room. Getting down the stairs was odd — he hadn’t
about what happened in the cave, but if we could use the pensieve, then I could show you and Hermione. And maybe you’d pick up some details which I missed.” The more Harry thought about it, the more he thought that this was the right thing to do. He certainly couldn’t do the situation justice from a description…and while Ron had always believed him, Harry didn’t think Hermione would believe Dumbledore was dead without indisputable proof.
She knew that this was somewhere the prisoner — whoever that was — had taken them, since the Malfoys had never been big fans of cities.
staying in that cold, dark corner of his mind, but if it helped Draco sleep, he’d do it. He’d woken up to Draco having a nightmare a couple of times, but Harry didn’t mind, and in any case, that was different; Draco wasn’t depending on Harry
The corner of Draco’s mouth pulled upwards, his eyes smouldering as he leant down. The kiss was chaste, but it sent sparks fizzling down to Harry’s fingertips.
Emotion...this was human. He’d read that while emotion could be imitated by magic, it couldn’t be properly rendered by anything that wasn’t living. And Draco certainly wasn’t bonded to an animal.
After about thirty seconds of sitting there with James squirming between them, Draco drawled “So are we getting food or not?”
Draco sighed and didn’t deny the question. That’s how, for the second time in twenty-four hours, Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter ended up hugging on a bed, although this time it was both of them with tears streaming down their faces.
Narcissa exited the room in a swirl of silk robes, leaving everyone scrambling to keep up. She quickly ascended the stairs, eventually coming to a stop at an old portrait of a simple landscape. It was masterfully done — light from nearby torches flickered, making it look as if the water was moving, but it was just that; a trick of the light. Which meant—
Ron stumbled through the door, bracing a hand against the doorway to stop himself from being flung into the dining table. “What’s this about a bloody trap? Tell us what happened!”
Bill went straight to the lifts, only realising after the doors had closed that there was only one other person in the lift — Percy Weasley.
“Do you think we could go up early?” Draco wondered out loud, falling off the sofa when Pansy, Blaise and Theo all shouted
Ron quickly scribbled down the address on a piece of paper, and handed it to Narcissa, who hurried outside.
Harry was hyperventilating now, having forgotten that Draco was in the same room as him. He flinched in surprise as he felt a tentative hand on his back, but leaned into the touch when he remembered who was in the room with him.
“Really?” Draco crossed his arms and stepped back, one eyebrow raised. Harry took a step forward, and the room pitched to the side, before Draco caught him with one strong hand. “You’re
Draco waved his wand at the door, which lit up with strings in many colours, representing the various wards, and…yep. He just had to put his hand on the gate. However…there was a bright green thread that led out of the room, and Draco was willing to bet that it would notify Lucius as soon as he opened the door.
like he could die in his sleep,” Granger whispered, and Draco resisted the urge to turn over to see if what she said was true.
“‘Mione, we can’t do anything right now, so we’re just going to have to trust Harry’s word. That is his handwriting, isn’t it?”
Remus breathed in the fresh air, deliberately ignoring the memories of coming down to the beach with Sirius, back when everything was okay. Well, as okay as it
, which caused a laceration in Nagini’s scales, but didn’t seem to do anything other than enrage her.
Indeed, the common room sofas were looking quite inviting, but Harry didn’t feel anything towards the idea of having to room with Malfoy. “He isn’t a threat, and maybe he’ll just leave me alone.”
Seamus and Dean were together, as were Neville and Hannah. Ginny was with Luna (they’d got together soon after Harry and Ginny had broken up, constantly visiting each other over the summer and had been near inseparable since they got back) and...he didn’t really have any other close friends.
Severus refrained from sighing, before turning to the Dark Lord and saying in a low voice “my Lord, I know he was less than useless on the raid, but he may have...other uses.”
“It was no problem, don’t worry about it.” Remus nodded at Severus, before leaving at the question. Severus traced the clear skin one more time, before rising on unsteady feet and going to his room, passing out as soon as he lay down.
“So you see, Miss Granger, the bond is the only thing keeping them alive. It is weakening the Dark Lord a small amount — not enough to cause him any difficulties, but he’s slowly feeding small quantities of magic into Potter.”
— Fleur knew more spells, more techniques, and had had a lot more practice — but Ginny made up for it in sheer savagery. More than once, she’d cast a mild
“He was practically a blood traitor, my lord. He didn’t kill the muggle until after I started torturing it.”
for once, after years of being called ‘useless’ by his parents, had certainly been appealing. How Dumbledore had been sorted into Gryffindor, Severus would never know, what with how easily he manipulated people to his side. A small part of him was glad that he was dead — Severus had had enough emotional manipulation for five lifetimes.
“I thought so.” He casually casted a warming charm over Harry before leaving the room. Feeling quite awake now, Harry sat up and put on his glasses before picking up the parchment Draco had been reading. It was quite boring, just some in–depth information about
He’d dozed off, and had a relatively peaceful sleep, despite the excitement of the day. He couldn’t remember anything regarding dreams - if he was tired enough, he never did, hence the clubbing - but had woken up to pure panic coursing through his veins.
Potter continued to shake his head, adamantly responding that he was “fine”. After about thirty seconds, Draco reached the end of his tether.
He walked side by side with Harry - as if they were equals. Harry ignored the stares of the others, briefly looking around the common room for his friends before heading straight out. Draco kept his head held high, stealing sideways glances at Harry when no one was looking. Harry didn’t say anything, but not out of awkwardness - over the last twenty-four hours they’d perfected the art of companionable silence.
Snape shot him a nasty look. Then again, he’d never been particularly fond of Ron, who was responsible for at least a third of the potions accidents that occurred in their classes. “Because according to Potter, he’s the only person who’s magic doesn’t
Draco cast a tempus and calculated they’d been asleep for around three and a half hours, but it was still two in the morning - enough for another five hours of sleep at least. “So you just...don’t go back to sleep?”
He brushed his teeth and emerged from the bathroom. It had been two hours since he’d woken up, meaning he had another four hours in which to contemplate his existence.
“Potter? I haven’t seen you all day. You look dreadful.” Harry didn’t take the words at face value as he noticed a flicker of worry in the grey eyes.
him — they would never do that, anyway. They didn’t care. And no one else knew where he was. This was his life now — torture, and pain…but never death.
Voldemort was there, his wand trained on Malfoy, and those screams - Harry would never be able to unhear them, and he was screaming too, screaming at Malfoy to
Harry continued, probably not oblivious to Draco’s reaction but talking anyway. “You were there, and
Regardless of how much better he was feeling, Harry was decidedly unimpressed when a painful spell dragged him out of his dissociation — likely from the source of the painful magic — and found himself looking into grey eyes.
which means she needs to be kept at a temperature of at least twenty–five degrees. It’s around five degrees here, so it shows up on the charm — and there’s a random ball of warmth up that way.”
He headed down to breakfast early, deliberately sipping at his tea and picking at eggs and bacon. He must have spent half an hour, lost in his thoughts and wallowing in self pity. He eventually dragged himself up from his grief, stuffing four croissants in his pocket before going back up to the dorm.
“I wasn’t able to glean any useful information, other than about a week ago, when someone let slip about ‘children in the dungeon’. Well, I’d heard about what they did to you, Harry; but only after you’d left. I would have broken you out sooner if I’d known.” The corners of her mouth quivered, and her eyes shone with unshed tears.
would have issues with those spells, never mind someone who wasn’t using his own wand, but after a while had given up and just taken to insulting him until he came out of his strop. It roughly had a ninety percent success rate, in any case.
One of the twins cracked a watery smile. “You know what mum would say, though — ‘cleaning is the base of all productivity!’”
“Who’s doing the spell?” Remus asked, gazing at the little home. It was adorably quaint — probably three bedrooms, single pane windows that somehow added character, vines climbing up trellises and a humble fence that contrasted with the golden sand — a feature that was a rarity in Britain — and a green, glittering sea.
Severus did so, and Remus wasted no time in starting the spell, moving his wand in a series of loops over the mark, his wand leaving a pale purple shimmer in the air in a diamond–like shape, while murmuring under his breath.
Harry’s hands had started shaking, and he’d jumped out of bed and started pacing - what was going on? Why was Draco in so much pain? Had he fallen down the stairs? What if he couldn’t move?
Kreacher growled as he stood up, fighting every movement. Hermione didn’t want to force him to do anything — other than forbidding him to provide intelligence of any kind to anyone outside of the Order, she hadn’t given him a single order — but they
Ron walked over to Harry cautiously. At around three feet, Harry winced. “Ron’s is bearable — feels a bit like pins and needles, rather than actual pain. Not compatible, though.”
“For the shits and giggles, Severus.” It was a phrase he’d heard the muggleborns say, and was clearly lost on Severus, who simply raised an eyebrow. “Because the Dark Lord said I had to, why else?”
. “This is a lot to take in. We suspected something was wrong, but for him to be in this state…we can’t thank you enough. Do you need somewhere to stay? This is a big house, after all.”
“I don’t see why not.” Bill walked over to the gate, and then deliberately took five, large steps away. “This should give us the maximum radius.”
The Christmas holidays were fast approaching and Harry wasn’t quite sure what he was going to do. Originally, he would have immediately said “I’m going to the Weasley’s.” Merlin, even a week ago he would have immediately said “the Weasley’s.” But now - now he didn’t know what Draco was doing. They’d only been dating for a week, but Harry felt they’d been more than friends since that night after they were told they were soulmates. Would Draco even
Harry sighed. “We’re friends, and I’m quite enjoying it since he’s my only friend not in a relationship - it’s nice to not feel like I’m on the outside all the time!” Harry felt taken aback at his outburst, and immediately hunched in on himself, looking sheepish.
“The fire isn’t going to tell you how to get into the dungeon.” Severus sank into the armchair on the opposite side of the fireplace.
Perhaps the luckiest thing happening was that Potter was...completely oblivious, from what Draco saw. Draco felt himself pretty observant, and Potter didn’t seem to be anything other than himself - basking in adoration from his fans, screwing up his potions worse than Draco at his most distracted, and not paying any attention to Draco (for once).
After the last potion delivered by Voldemort, no one visited Harry for a long time. At least, he thought it was a long time. He faded in and out of consciousness, fully residing in neither. At the sound of heels clicking against a stone floor, Harry instinctively occluded, and didn’t quite come out afterwards. He got vague impressions from outside — a flash of blades and a high–pitched giggle, a horrid smell and an unbuckled belt, long, sharp fingernails digging into his hips. But he didn’t really know. He was a coward — he was afraid. Afraid of the pain, of reality.
Draco glanced between the two men and the book. Deciding the expressions Severus was trying to hide were much more interesting than a book he could read later, he watched his godfather.
- it had been a triple potions lesson, which meant it was now lunch. He walked out of the room, spotting Pansy and Blaise immediately. Pansy looked him up and down and smirked, while Blaise raised an eyebrow.
Harry dried his eyes, sighed and lifted his head up, re-casting his glamour. He hadn’t talked to Malfoy since charms this morning - not that he’d been planning to. He cancelled the silencing charm and opened his drapes. “Yes?”
He didn’t realise he forgot to draw his drapes until morning, when he rolled over to see Potter was long gone.
Remus tilted his head slightly as he watched them. That should be him and Sirius — When he’d get angry or tired, his French accent would reappear — he’d frequently rant in French, too. Well, he
Draco’s curiosity quickly turned to horror, however, as the door swung open to reveal an emaciated child, wearing only grey boxers that were a few sizes too big, curled up against the wall, sitting on a bloody cot. Draco shuddered to think just how exactly it got that bloody.
A diary, with a hole in the middle. A locket to the left. A cracked ring to the right. A diadem to the left. A cup to the right. A snake winding behind Harry...and now there were seven Voldemort’s, one with Harry’s glasses on, all made of swirling fire and pointing their wands towards him.
Afterwards they headed up to the room, Harry in the middle of a large throng of Gryffindors. He hadn’t been approached by anyone who wasn’t his friend yet, but based on what happened on the one outing to Diagon Alley that Harry went on it wouldn’t be long before the crowds got braver. Harry decided to enjoy the peace as much as he could, while it lasted.
It was quickly wiped from his face as he entered a small sitting room - decorated in plain colours, but tidy and clean — and was faced with four wide–eyed muggles. There was a mother, and a father, arm in arm and trying their best to shield their children, peering from behind the parents with wide, hazel eyes. Draco wasn’t good with ages, but both looked too young to be at Hogwarts. Too young to die.
what was so special about the wand, what gave it these properties, but he could find out with time. And for now, what mattered was that he had it. And with it, he would be
They made short work of reaching the dungeon, and Severus gasped at the sight of Potter corked up on the floor, causing Draco to crack his neck turning to look at Severus because he
Draco sighed, turning back to his runes homework, but they turned and swam off the page. Huffing in irritation, Draco got ready for bed and slid under the covers, casting a
Ron felt something break in his chest as he sat, unmoving, on the floor, and somehow knew that his parents had just been killed. He took one deep, shuddering breath, and then two, before looking up at Bill, Fleur and the twins, who hadn’t moved since the door had shut. The Death Eaters, surprisingly, had stuck to their word, apparating as soon as they’d left with Molly and Arthur.
“Well, since your grand escape from the manor, the Dark Lord has become more and more unhinged. Not to feed your ego, Severus, but I really do think you were the only thing keeping him sane. He’s constantly putting his followers under the cruciatus—” Draco flinched, and Narcissa’s head snapped to the side. “No, no, don’t worry. He was just doing it to people who spoke to him, and…well, you know how they are with any woman that isn’t Bellatrix. I stay in the shadows — where it’s safest.
“Shall we begin then? No need to stand around,” Fleur said, her accent becoming slightly more pronounced as she looked around cautiously.
- When all of the children moved out, Harry and Draco moved into Godric’s Hollow. Harry had been redoing Grimmauld Place so it would be a hostel, of sorts, for abused kids who didn’t have anywhere else to go over the summer that they couldn’t spent at Hogwarts. Harry ran it, hiring any elves that wanted work for the cooking and cleaning.
Harry’s heart had dropped into his stomach. He’d told Draco to tell them, sure, but Draco hadn’t got the message...and he’d told them anyway. Harry took a deep, shuddering breath, and let his head fall as Bellatrix cackled triumphantly and let go of his hair.
He hadn’t allowed the skin of his wrist to breathe since he’d left the Manor, wrapping a bandage around the ugly mark at the first opportunity and spelling it to repel all liquids and dirt so that he wouldn’t have to take it off. But today, he would finally remove it.
Ron chuckled, and Draco rolled his eyes, before walking off towards the Great Hall, the trio close behind.
When the three Slytherins walked into Gringotts, the long hall was almost empty. Apparently, they still operated by the same schedule, despite the Ministry’s new rules under Voldemort’s rule.
“Yes well, she was from the Black family. As was Draco’s mother, actually — although I’m not sure of her allegiances.”
Voldemort’s skimmed the page looking for the footnote — it was just some random information on ‘ancient magic’ interfering with it; as if it didn’t interfere with
On this particular day, Potter was more excitable than usual. It probably had something to do with the fact that it was the first Hogsmeade weekend, and despite being a year older eighth years were limited the same amount as the seventh years until Christmas, for whatever inexplicable reason McGonagall had come up with. Draco wouldn’t usually mind, except he liked to avoid crowds as a whole, and also liked to get his ideas for various Christmas presents around October.
“Only Harry and I could get into them, or even find them, since they’re keyed to the Head of the family or anyone born directly into the line. Not to mention, we aren’t exactly sure which ones Bellatrix knows about,” Narcissa pointed out.
Hermione headed down the stairs, while Harry and Ron went straight ahead to a stone corridor with cheerfully burning torches on the walls, lined with wooden doors and gleaming, brass numbers. Ron was two doors down from Harry.
Draco hesitated for a moment, before removing his trousers, standing before Potter in only his underwear. He started blushing as Harry started staring, just at him, before saying “Enjoying the view?” It was an intimate moment, but Draco didn’t deal well with delicate situations.
Draco’s head abruptly snapped to the left as heavy footsteps sounded down the steps, followed by panic surging down the bond. Draco’s instincts told him to follow the fat, pink man who had just come down the stairs - likely muggle, based on the clothing, with no chin and a barely-there moustache. As Draco watched, the fat man unlocked multiple locks on the cupboard under the stairs. Intrigued, Draco drew closer to see inside - what could possibly require this much protection? A weapon? Jewels?
But after feeling a distinct kick to the nose that set his eyes watering, Harry realised someone was beating up Draco. Many someone’s, if the rate of the kicks was any indication.
“There was no ill intent when sending this letter, which means it’s a legitimate letter. So unless there’s some hidden meaning that we’re not getting, we have to believe that Harry is safe, and with Dumbledore.”
The twins appeared at the bottom of the stairs, their faces grave. “This is a variant of the polyjuice potion which we’ve tested and developed. It lasts five hours, instead of the usual one.”
“You WHAT?” Weasley shouted, and a thud quickly followed — probably Granger stamping on his foot — before all three waited in silence with baited breath. Draco tried his best to keep his breathing even, and apparently he passed their test, as Weasley started whispering furiously.
than in his dream. At least there, it had been neutral. Here, it felt like the dark magic had seeped into the very bones of the castle.
Expressions of shock were exchanged between the five, but Hermione nodded, and gestured for Kreacher to carry on.
Draco had never been so glad to have his wand as much as he did the next few weeks. He shared three classes with Potter:
“Help yourself,” Hermione interrupted, waving a hand at the table. Malfoy nodded his thanks, slathering a slice of toast with copious amounts of raspberry jam, somehow taking a bite without spilling a drop. “So I guess the next question is, what do we do next? We have to defeat Voldemort — or get Harry ready to — and there’s some…other stuff me and Ron need to do as well.”
us.” Remus felt his heart rate start to rise, and deliberately took deep breaths, willing it to calm down. Now was not the time to panic. Not in front of everyone.
Remus appeared a moment later, and summoned the papers at the other end of the table, quickly skimming them before turning to Severus.
, who looked rather smug. Draco knew Theo was going to spend the thirty galleons on books which Draco won’t be allowed to borrow.
“Oh, are we betting how long it takes Blaise to come out? Half an hour.” Millicent rounded the corner, sensibly dressed in a knitted grey sweater, mid-thigh navy skirt and fur-lined boots.
Harry thought he’d known fear. Enough of it that he’d generally been desensitised to the idea of his death.
“Did you not hear Hermione announce it to the entirety of London? A trap!” Draco said, slightly hysterical and still holding Narcissa’s hand, his knuckles white.
It became that this was the most enjoyable meal Harry had had at the Gryffindor table since he’d come back. It didn’t quite measure up to those intimate meals with Draco, sitting on one of their beds in comfortable silence, but this was a close second - Draco took all the pressure off Harry and brought it onto himself, allowing Harry to be in the presence of his friends without the pressure of being the Saviour. Hermione shot a couple of weird looks at him, but that was something to worry about later.
She took another deep breath, before checking for wards around the bed. There were a couple of basic ones, likely to tell Draco that he didn’t want him there. She easily dismantled them with a wave of her wand, before sweeping the drapes back, dispelling the smell (he clearly hadn’t moved much for three days) and gently said “Harry?”
After recovering (not enough, in Severus’ opinion) Remus spent even less time at Grimmauld, overworking himself by going between the Burrow and everywhere else in England. Bill was grateful for the company — since his wife was in Europe most of the time, he’d been getting quite lonely, even with Order members dropping in and out — and was especially grateful for an extra person to help him deal with Mundungus and Mad-Eye.
Apologies for the formatting of the gravestone, it is 10:30pm and I am very tired. The words on the gravestone and the sign are taken directly from the Deathly Hallows, and the origin of The Tale Of The Three Brothers is from Beedle the Bard (jk, credit to the tale goes to J.K.Rowling who’s transphobic views I do not support in the slightest). I wrote it from memory which is why it’s a bit different.
He tentatively pulled back the drapes, worried about what he’d find behind. Harry was curled up, hands clenched in the duvet as if he’d forgotten to remove them after the dream. Draco was quite sure there would be little crescent-shapes indentations in Harry’s palms from his nails as well. He had his back to Draco, and flinched heavily as Draco gently touched his shoulder.
He managed to take another bite of his mashed potatoes when he heard the familiar clink of coins being exchanged. He frowned, but dug his fork back into the food, when he heard another clink, and then another. Soon, the entire room was filled with the muffled clinking of money changing hands.
She softly shut the door as she exited, saying “I’ve sorted his bullshit out, come to me sooner next time.”
“That is an excellent plan, but I wondered how many people you would need going in? I’m sure myself and the aurors,” he gestured to his group of people, “could get ahold of any hair you need, but there are only so many people in top positions that would have access to the documents.”
He threw open his wardrobe, the jumper already half off, to find it empty, because today was the day he’d asked his house elf to deep clean and steam his clothes.
“Draco, Draco stop, my legs are not that long,” Harry tugged at Draco’s arm until he was face to face with Harry, looking near identical to a wet kitten, in Harry’s opinion. His hair was plastered to his head, hanging over his eyes, which were a steely grey. The corners of his mouth were turned down, but one twitched, as if he saw a bit of humour in the situation.
So this is a *bit* later than I said, because I've been struggling with...stuff. On the bright side, we're back in lockdown because Christmas caused a massive 'rona spike (honestly the amount deaths have increased is actually appalling), which means I may be able to write more! I make no promises, but I'm going to try to write every night and try to get a chapter out each week, and hopefully finish the fic by the end of January :) but again, I make No Promises.
Harry gazed longingly at the last slice of stale bread on the floor of his cell. He’d eaten the first slice about an hour ago, but his stomach felt like it was digesting itself. Relenting, Harry grabbed the last slice, glad that at least he wouldn’t have a shortage of water — the bucket appeared to constantly refill. Harry nibbled at the bread before taking a big swig of water — he’d learnt at the Dursley’s that drinking constantly with a meal made you full quicker. It temporarily kept the gnawing pain at bay, at least.
Harry looked across at Draco. Harry was lounging in bed, enjoying some free time as Draco worked on another essay. Harry felt like Draco had so much more work than him, even though he was only doing one extra NEWT.
“Be glad that I remembered to put it on,” Harry muttered, sliding the tie under his collar and tying it.
She’d been anxious as she arrived on the platform with Bill and Fleur, but seeing all the little first years — less than usual, but they were there — strengthened her resolve. They needed someone to protect them, and that’s what she was there for.
Harry still spent the best part of an hour walking all over the school, in hopes that he would come across Draco. He would have used the Marauder’s Map, except he left it in his dorm and what if, while he was fetching it, Draco went to his dorm when he wasn’t there before?
.” Ron threw some clothes - hopefully his uniform - at Harry, who took them and blindly stumbled to the bathroom, remembering a moment too late that he needed his glasses to see.
For the next three weeks, the pair were considerably more relaxed, occasionally firing concerned glances at each other but generally trying to obey Harry’s letter and enjoy themselves. Ron often woke up and felt his heart jolt as he saw Harry’s empty bed, before remembering that he was on a secret mission with Dumbledore. Despite the nagging feelings in the back of their minds, Ron and Hermione enjoyed the newfound monotony of normal school life. Since Harry wasn’t there, there were no major events, and no one knew about the body, lost among masses of inferi, floating at the bottom of a hidden lake.
They walked into Flitwick’s room. Draco tried to take a chair in the back corner, like he usually did, but Harry dragged him to the front, with the wall on one side and Harry on his left.
“Better doesn’t mean good,” Draco said, noting the weariness hidden behind the still challenging posture. “Did you sleep at all last night?”
Wearing the face of a middle–aged, white male with salt and pepper hair, Tonks strode into the Ministry, not making eye contact with anyone as she got into the lift.
After their third butterbeers, it was near five, meaning the sun was going to set soon. Draco swayed slightly as he stood up, and Harry grabbed his arm, laughing. “You really can’t hold your liquor, can you?”
After having spent the best part of the meal determinedly staring at his food rather than at Draco, who looked irresistible in
“Ah, well, there was a bit of a…” Harry trailed off under Hermione’s stern gaze, but continued as she poked his chest, “trap.”
He focused on the conversation at the meal, allowing Ron to steal from his plate to cover up the fact he didn’t eat very much - a slice of bread, a bit of meat and potato, half a slice of treacle tart - enough to satisfy everyone, not so much that he’d run out of the room ready to throw up.
Harry collapsed on the floor, his screams echoing around the cavern as Harry clutched his forehead. Dumbledore watched with mild interest as Harry writhed on the ground. He shifted his attention to the wound on his hand, examining it before casting a wordless healing spell. As Harry’s pain seemed to subside, Dumblefore gazed at him with concern. Ron went to throw himself at Dumbledore because
He picked at it as he slowly walked back to the cottage, quickly vanishing the rest as he walked through the door. He wasn’t hungry anyway.
“You’re not supposed to gulp it, you moron. You’re supposed to sip it.” Draco did so, delicately, grimacing at the taste but clearly not as close to spluttering as Harry was.
He rallied his magic, making a second jump to the North Pennines, immediately collapsing on the grass as pain rippled through his thigh. A quick glance downward confirmed that he’d splinched himself, but a bit of prodding revealed that it wasn’t very bad. He tore off a chunk of his shirt and tightly wrapped the wound, before setting up a few wards with the last of his magic and collapsing under a tree. Harry was lucky he’d made it here; the Pennines were considered an Area of Natural Beauty, so there were almost no people around.
They stood like that for a little while, watching Harry run between the basin and Dumbledore. They watched him keel over, Hermione making a small noise and burying her face into Ron’s shoulder. They watched as Harry bent down to check — and dropped his wand, the git. A flash of light illuminated the cave, and Ron and Hermione almost lost their footing when they spun around.
If they said anything else, Severus didn’t hear, as he turned on his heel, feeling his robes flare out behind him as he apparated. The others wore muggle clothes — jeans and t-shirts, but Severus didn’t particularly like them. Too…exposing. And muggle suits were too formal, so he stuck to casual black robes.
Hermione grabbed his wrist and suddenly he was dragged onto the sofa. “If you insist.” He made the sofa a bit bigger, and curled up beside her, quickly dragged into a deep slumber.
“What do I have to do?” Harry knew, and was pretty sure Voldemort knew too, that Harry would to anything to save his friends. No reason to hide that.
The moment he wordlessly vanished the glass wasn’t a moment too soon, as Draco’s concentration was broken by a white...
Ron huffed softly before answering — even in a situation like this, Hermione was looking to use new spells. “Don’t think so.”
had such an awful birthday, was bake him a cake. He’d never baked a cake before in his life, but he knew the basics — flour, eggs, sugar — and really, how hard could it be?
“So when can we start with the diagnostic charms?” Hermione asked. Malfoy shot her a relieved glance — a surreal experience — before answering.
,” she snarled, “is the headmistress. It’s going to be like the year before last all over again. On the bright side, the portraits, the elves, and the Head’s office all recognise me as Headmistress. I doubt that the office will let Umbridge in, thankfully, and the elves will be able to provide food in the room of requirement.” She looked directly at Ginny. “I hate to ask this of you, Miss Weasley, but if you are going back to Hogwarts—”
“What are you doing, Harry?” As Harry turned over, a pair of bare, pale feet appeared on the floor (ceiling? Harry was still upside down).
around,” Draco’s voice faded as Harry approached the stack of silver cauldrons at the front of the room. He knew that, regardless of what he said, Draco would huff and go get the ingredients for him.
“Well they didn’t turn up. They just send a note through saying they’d been summoned back to the manor.”
“I miss him too, but I don’t think he wants us there. He never talked at mealtimes - it’s like he wasn’t even there!”
, Draco? Be brave more than once?” Draco flinched, and Harry sighed, his anger dissipating. “I didn’t mean that.”
He winced — he knew that, somehow, that Death had refilled his magic, maybe even given him a top–up of sorts, but he still wasn’t sure if he’d make it — that 150 miles had half–drained his magic, and he remembered from the atlases in the Dursley’s house that he still had a long way to go.
“So you know how the death eaters were supposed to invade Hogwarts tonight?” Draco sunk into one of the plush armchairs in the living room.
Before either of them could object, Molly and Arthur exchanged a chaste kiss and downed their potions. Arthur grew a couple of inches, gained freckles, lost his worry lines and his hair lengthened slightly. Molly’s skin and hair darkened as she grew as well, her clothes now hanging loosely off Hermione’s slender frame. She looked down and grimaced, casting a couple of shrinking charms so they fit.
He didn’t know when, exactly, Draco stopped being such a prat; then again, he couldn’t imagine Draco kicking him when he was down. He’d come out with some bullshit about honour. Never mind the fact that Harry had cut him open when he’d been crying in the bathroom.
Harry and Snape both glared at Hermione. “Hermione, you don’t really mean I have to call him,” he nodded at Snape, “
The words died in Draco’s throat as he blinked and looked at Har–Potter’s face. It was contorted with terror, his eyebrows were drawn in and up and his breathing was increasing in rate.
“So what have you lot been doing?” Harry’s voice trailed off — he clearly wasn’t up to speaking — but Malfoy got his drift nonetheless.
“Bill? Bill! Thank Merlin you’re okay—” Remus appeared, but from the trees, but stopped short at the sight of Percy.
He removed himself from Draco’s waist and pressed a soft, lingering kiss to his lips. “Are you asking me to live with you over Christmas?”
Harry’s breath caught at the idea of being alone, with that coldness, for even a second, but Malfoy apparently caught onto this and cast a warming charm before going downstairs.
“Anytime.” The moment had lasted half a second, and Potter let go of Draco’s hand, nodding once before strolling away, only the set of his shoulders revealing anything was wrong.
Ginny had not expected to leave those dungeons with only a couple of bruises around her wrist and a silent allegiance with the Slytherins, that much was sure.
Draco moved his hand and brushed a bit of hair that had drifted over Harry’s eye, and tilted his head slightly. He looked as beautiful as ever — all high cheekbones and silver eyes and slightly parted lips.
“It wasn’t a death eater, since no one of high ranking has been injured. It wouldn’t be a muggleborn or a muggle, since he usually just kills them anyway. Who else could it possibly be…”
Harry’s heart might have stopped when he was levitated out of the cell, but it was...different. The magic was painful, but Harry couldn’t feel any hostility in the way it carried him, nor could he hear their hushed whispers, as his consciousness was still tucked away in that safe pocket of his mind where nothing could hurt him.
The corridors he walked down were almost oppressive in their cleanliness, shiny wooden furniture and blindingly white walls closing in as he checked plaques for Umbridge’s name. He knew, approximately, where the office was, but if she’d moved…he couldn’t afford to waste time.
Severus had to say, though, he’d never had a friend like Remus. Sure, Lily had always been there for him, but there had always been a clear division between them; their bond was more fragile than either of them (at least, Severus
And then the world was filled with colour again, as he was shaken awake and opened his eyes to see Draco’s.
The diadem…it was the least guarded, now. He’d send some more death eaters to patrol the corridors and boundaries tomorrow. And he’d send Bella to reinforce the wards surrounding the castle. No one gets in or out without him knowing.
“Hermione’s is very…neutral. I can’t really feel anything, but again, not very compatible. Maybe try casting something?”
“I think Potter will survive an hour or two without me, Weasley.” Hermione was finding it extremely difficult to hold in her giggles at the contrast between the tomato–red Ron and relaxed Malfoy. A glance to her side showed Severus’ eyes glinting with mirth, even as he frowned. “Anyway, I wanted breakfast.”
“What you two have is very special, and nobody who’s ever had it has ever felt the need to get rid of it. There is no research in the area of breaking soulmate bonds.”
“What was down there?” Severus said softly. “You came sprinting in and just started hurling in my bathroom, so it must have been bad.”
Sure enough, the pan suddenly started spewing smoke everything, causing the two adults - fat man and horse-faced woman - to come over, yelling at Harry. Draco shook with anger - Harry was tiny, and while he was short now, here he couldn’t have been older than three or four. And now he was shaking in terror, still only wearing those horrid boxers, and there was a smaller duplicate of the fat man - his child - pulling faces at Harry while pretend sobbing about something whenever his mother turned around. Draco shook with anger at the scene - Harry was so young, he shouldn’t be cooking.
“Harry, you can walk the halls of this castle despite the war.” He flinched at her harsh tone, but this boy needed it - Draco had been spoiling him, clearly. Not that she could blame him. “I think you can deal with seeing Draco after something that
“The Lost Diadem of Ravenclaw?” Luna raised an eyebrow, and Harry shook his head. “Well, it’s like a small tiara that would bestow the wearer increased knowledge and wisdom — or so the legend says. It’s actually pretty famous, but it’s also been lost for centuries.”
It perhaps wasn’t the best — granted, the green, silk sheets were a nice touch, but it was a bit on the small side, and there was no manual lock, so he had to rely on
Hermione smiled at Ron, before turning back to the family. “I think, at the very least, we should send a letter to Harry. Just to find out what’s going on. We can put concealment spells on the owl and the letter to stop it from being seen, and finally get word because it’s driving me out of my mind.”
” Potter’s motionless form shook a few times before his eyes shot open. “Excellent, you’re awake. Drink this.” He held out the potion through the bars expectantly. Potter sat there and watched him, his face expressionless.
Ginny sniffled from her seat in the corner and nodded. “Cleaning seems a bit pointless, now, doesn’t it?”
Malfoy shifted, opening his mouth to spit some response, when Snape laid a hand on his shoulder. Malfoy glared at him, and they had some silent conversation, which ended in Malfoy mirroring Ron’s stance and looking quite sulky.
“I brought you some bread and butter,” Harry said, looking sheepishly at Draco from under his lashes while levitating over a plate with food on it. Draco smiled - he had brought food for him. Maybe he cared a little.
When he wasn’t learning the spell, he went back and forth between Grimmauld Place and Shell Cottage, making plans for the Order. Three times a week, as promised, he took Ron, Hermione and Draco with him to Shell Cottage, and taught the three of them, as well as Ginny, as many duelling techniques as he could. He was glad to see that they all did well, although they all had their strengths and weaknesses — Ginny had the lowest range in spells, but fought most viciously, and her style was very unorthodox and fluid, making it harder for people to predict what she was going to do next — Hermione had clearly learned many spells, and wasn’t afraid to use them — Ron could figure out his opponents weaknesses and exploit them — and Draco was a marvel to watch, as graceful as a dancer as he dodged and threw spells within the same breath, but was fixed in his technique; while it was impressive, once Ron had figured out how to get behind his defence, he was easily beaten. However, he was still the best out of the three, and improved further as he observed Ginny’s new techniques and exchanged spells with Hermione.
.” Malfoy sneered haughtily, flicking his wand at Harry who lifted rather gracefully from the sofa. Ron itched to tackle the blonde git and carry Harry himself, but if his magic hurt Harry…he’d clearly been through a lot.
- many, many bruises, that would use up most of his bruise salve - a few cuts, which would need dittany. Altogether, not too bad. Although he’d rather sort himself out in his room. He wasn’t too far when he’d been assaulted.
“If I have to.” Draco dismissed Harry’s glamours with a wave of his wand, before murmuring under his breath and waving his wand in elaborate actions, weaving glamours seamlessly into one another like thread.
“What the fuck is this?” Harry’s head suddenly spun and he sat down, resenting that he was on lower ground to the older men.
Harry jolted awake and immediately ran around the house. It was six in the morning, and no one appreciated being woken up, but they quickly straightened at Harry’s news.
They decided the shed they’d placed under the fidelius would be the place to store the documents, so no one outside of the Order could get to them, and left the fully–sized documents in several large, neatly stacked piles, before placing several charms to ensure they would sustain no weather damage. Percy apparated away as soon as he saw the rest of his siblings, mumbling something to Bill about “needing to cover absences in the auror department.”
“Well it's like the two most compatible people, isn’t it? And we have a stronger mind bond, and most of them are romantic…” Harry trailed off, blushing.
After seeing that her eyes had cleared, Remus listed the mental notes he’d made while watching them. “You were good at resisting her powers, but it still dimmed your focus slightly, which you’ll have to work on. Also, we need to have you learning some more advanced spells. Your technique is surprisingly good, especially for your age — very unorthodox, which means it will probably take your enemies by surprise—that’s what we want.”
He had a thought and looked into his mind, across the bond. Harry’s mind, rather than being wreathed in shadow, was quite visible. Dark shadows hung loosely in the air like clouds, but they looked...peaceful.
“Oh, but they are! Very rare for them to find each other - we haven’t had any here at Hogwarts for over twenty years - but very much real.” Flitwick was practically bouncing at this point.
They didn’t talk for the rest of the evening, simply communicating through various facial expressions, eyebrow twitches, sighs and eye rolls. They did eventually go to sleep, have a nightmare, go into the same bed and back to sleep - their old routine - but the atmosphere was tinged with something…
Harry waved his wand, doing the action completely wrong and mouthing the words of the charm. “Your wrist work is terrible, Potter.” Draco leaned back, demonstrating how to do it with his own wand.
“Harry!” Hermione threw her arms around his shoulders, obscuring his view with her bushy hair. “What are you doing down here?”
“I’ve asked you not to call me Master, Kreacher, and today is just a sad day and I don’t want to be around people. Could I have a bit of food? I don’t want to disrupt anything so I can sit for a bit if you need.”
“Thank god. I’m off to bed,” Ron yawned. Draco grumbled something like an agreement under his breath, following.
Draco opened his mouth to argue, but Potter raised a finger, then pointed at Draco, then his bed. Draco sighed and dragged himself back over to his now-cold bed.
“You made me lose my place!” Theo groaned, glaring daggers at Draco while quickly flicking through his book.
As Draco was considering the merits of ordering Potter to stop rocking back on his chair, because there are four legs for a reason (
Draco frantically stuffed clothes into a magically expanded bag, scooping them out of his wardrobe and stuffing them into the opening. He’d already added all of his books, shoes, and everything that he wanted, leaving his room disconcertingly bare. He cringed as he thought of the creases —
Conversation continued to flit around the table, but the mood didn’t improve, to Harry’s dismay. He found himself quickly becoming more and more tired, filled with warm food and surrounded by quiet, if tense, conversation. He excused himself, and Draco, who’d seemed even less at ease than Harry, had followed on his heels. Harry couldn’t even be bothered to tell Draco off when he held Harry’s arm as they went upstairs — even as he felt his face burn at the contact — especially when he tripped and Draco was the only reason he didn’t lose several teeth in the fall.
As far as he had seen, Draco wasn’t part of any couple. He spent a lot of time with Parkinson, Bulstrode, Nott and Zabini - but Zabini spent most of his time eyeing up Ravenclaws, Nott spent a lot of time eyeing up Bulstrode, Parkinson spent a lot of time eyeing up her mirror, and Bulstrode’s body language didn’t betray any hidden relationship; nor did Parkinson’s, although she was clearly close with Draco.
“Not that witty, really,” Ron muttered, and Hermione elbowed him, before smiling encouragingly at Draco.
It became apparent when, on the third attempt, a large stag appeared from the end of Potter’s wand. Draco’s jaw dropped - he couldn’t even do a patronus charm with words! Never mind the fact that Potter's patronus was so...
“Now we’re matching!” Harry had said, attempting to lighten the situation, but Draco had bit his lip and shook his head.
“Remy, my boy,” Mundungus started, and Remus sighed internally, “not that I don’t love you an’ all, but d’you know where Dumbledore is? I haven’t seen him in a while.”
Harry nodded shakily, and tried to stand, but his legs immediately gave way beneath him. He would have knocked his teeth out on the porcelain rim of the toilet if Draco hadn’t caught him. Draco vanished the mess in the toilet before pulling Harry’s arm around his shoulders and taking him to their room.
Draco didn’t reply for a moment, and Harry’s neck prickled as he could still feel Draco’s eyes on his scarred back.
Draco continued staring at the wall, replaying the scene outside of the room over and over in his head. He determinedly ignored his cock, begging for attention, and thought about how Harry had reacted - he hadn’t moved his hands, likely because he would have fallen on Draco if he had - but his lips had apparently had the same ideas as him. The noises he was making also brought a smile to Draco’s face.
“Yes, of course, right this way Professor.” Hermione shooed Ron out of the room. He sighed and reluctantly turned his back on Harry, standing just outside of the room. As soon as Snape and Malfoy left the room, however, Harry shifted and groaned. Ron felt fear spike in his chest and ran back into the room, briefly stopping to throw a dirty look at Malfoy as he passed.
Millie and Draco wandered through the shop in their separate directions, knowing they would be in the shop for at least an hour. Draco picked up an ice-blue scarf with a faint peacock-feather pattern for his mother - it would be nice to wrap up another present, especially if it’s delicate. He also picked up a sky-blue sweater - quite thin, but made of the softest material he’d ever felt.
After being released and three panic attacks in three hours after walking into the Manor, it had been sold within a day, and the Malfoy family had gone to France. But Draco had felt uncomfortable there - he missed England, with the shitty weather and rude people and
, Potter.” Draco found that he couldn’t stop the small smile playing at his lips at the sound of Harry talking normally, and hoped that the dark room would hide it.
The last thing Draco remembered before drifting off to sleep again was the feel of Harry’s fingers gently combing through his hair, and that
A flicker of hope went through the bond, as Harry made eye contact with Draco - and Draco shouted, screamed Harry’s name, hoping he could hear - but the green eyes just moved away, and after one final lash he collapsed, his back bleeding out onto the pavement.
Harry turned onto his back, and cried out in pain as a wound, or many wounds, split open from the movement. Harry sat up, whimpering at the pain, feeling blood trickle down his back, arms flying out in every direction.
Hermione peered at Harry. “Did you hit your head while fighting Voldemort? Brain damage sounds like a real possibility.”
“I’m most sorry, My Lord.” Draco bowed even lower. “I had planned to kill him three weeks ago, but he’d disappeared, and the death eaters didn’t infiltrate Hogwarts as planned. He hasn’t been present at the school since that night.” Draco gritted his teeth, tensing as he knew what would follow.
“Certainly, Miss — Master and his friends have been very kind to Kreacher, Miss.” His round eyes looked larger than ever at the sight of
Another good thing was that Kreacher had become more agreeable after the incident in Harry and Draco’s bedroom. They weren’t sure whether it was because of the presence of someone descended from the Black family, or Hermione and Ron helping with his Master Regulus’ dying wish, but he suddenly revealed excellent cooking and cleaning skills, allowing the residents of Grimmauld Place to indulge in two large meals a day in a spotless dining room.
he saw something emerge from the lake for a split second towards the back of the lake. Ron moved towards the bank, trying to see what had splashed in the eerily–still lake. However, the water didn’t move, so Ron went back to watching Harry and Dumbledore. He held out the chain to Harry, mumbling something about his hand. Harry took the chain without question, even as the pain he was feeling, likely from his episode, was written across his face. Ron figured that it was probably best for Harry to be doing the heavy lifting — Dumbledore’s hand
ANYWAY. It’s been half term for me which means I had time to bang out this chapter, which I have been dying to write for AGES. I hope it was worth the wait :)
“To be honest, Harry, she’s probably safer in the safehouse for the time being. It’s under the fidelius, and the area is surrounded by loads of
“From the looks of him, he just had a transformation,” Bill said, “he’ll probably sleep for twelve hours and wake up this evening,” He looked at Ginny and Fleur, “We were going to do the Fidelius around Shell Cottage today, but that can wait until tomorrow — and it will definitely be easier with a third person.”
. He’d heard the stories when they were younger, but that's all he’d thought they were - stories. And now he was living one. With his long-time crush, no less.
Draco loosed a breath of relief. “It’s one my mother taught me, although I’ve never seen it in any book. It doesn’t have a particular incantation — usually you just say the name of the scent, or flower, if it’s floral, in Latin. The spell is all in the wrist–work — it’s like a drawn out version of the flick at the end of
Once in their room, they stood around awkwardly for about twenty seconds. After dragging Harry back so eagerly, Draco wasn’t sure what he wanted to do.
The pain abruptly stopped, and Harry uncurled from the floor, his throat sore. Had he screamed? But it didn’t matter, nothing mattered, as he looked up into Draco’s grey eyes.
Draco loosed a shaky breath before continuing to Ancient Runes, stomach churning for the entire lesson as his mind was taken up by caramel skin and curved lips and electrifyingly green eyes.
After leaving a note for Ron saying he wanted to be left alone and would be back after dinner, he grabbed his invisibility cloak and walked out of the castle towards the Forbidden Forest. He hadn’t been near it since the Battle, but it was the last time he saw his parents, even if they were shades. It seemed...right.
“You need to stay close to Potter at all times, or he won’t heal. Or if he does, his progress will be extremely slow.”
“How can you come up with stuff like this, and yet be so terrible at chess?” Ron asked, earning him a kick in the shin from Hermione, and Ginny to snicker beside her.
Harry chuckled, gently extracting his arms from beneath Draco and kneeling between his legs. His eyes travelled greedily over Draco, who was sprawled out on the bed proper up on his elbows and decidedly not worrying about how he looked.
“So, Draco,” Hermione said, causing Draco to jump and spill some peas from his fork at the sound of his name, “what was that spell you used to make the room smell of lavender yesterday?”
, and gasped — he hadn’t put very much power into it, but the lumos had glowed brighter than he could have expected. So
Severus summoned a vial and a silver knife, offering them to Voldemort. He made quick work of half–filling the small vial, before healing the cut and returning the objects to Severus. “How quickly can you have it done?”
Kingsley and his most trusted aurors had gathered in one group, and the Hogwarts Professors had gathered in another, along with Snape. The Weasleys sat around Remus — Draco had once again stayed behind with Harry, who was improving considerably. He still hadn’t gone downstairs, but he often went outside onto a balcony, which had appeared after Harry had wandered down the corridor, and sat on a rickety chair for an hour while watching the busy London street.
Severus spent his free time — not that it was free, really — making potions. The Order was consuming healing potions as quickly as he could make them, and Harry was having whatever was left. Having gotten bored but still confined in the house until further notice, Harry had taken to
“Go. Unpack. I have a job for you tomorrow.” The Dark Lord dismissed Draco with a flick of his hand. Draco kept his steps even, refusing to give him the satisfaction of running out of the room.
Potter, Draco finally did a diagnosis spell to see Potter’s physical injuries. They were terrible — not only were there several broken ribs and fractures in his tibula, he had several very deep cuts that weren’t going to heal easily, and evidence of very old injuries. Sure, he knew that Potter hadn’t had the
“Well there are apprenticeships to become a master of herbology that I’ve been looking into. I’ve applied to a couple that go to the rainforest in South America.” Neville glowed at the idea.
Hermione sighed, muttering something about “irresponsible boys” and “going to get himself pregnant”.
The potion flew out of his hand, the cork slipping out as the flask hit Draco square in the chest, the potion splashing on his uniform.
“I brought chicken and sweetcorn soup, Potter. I know it’s your favourite.” Draco said, before shoving Potter again.
He fast walked up to the dorms, almost sprinting by the time he got there. Draco was sitting on his bed, knees bent with a book resting on them and a lumos floating above his head.
Away from the bustle of Hogwarts, Severus would have expected to feel alone, with long hours in the potions room in the basement, but somehow, he felt less alone than he had in years. Grimmauld was now a family, and Severus couldn’t fight the warm feeling when someone called him upstairs to lunch, as if they
Before Draco could respond, Harry spun on his heel and fled to his dorms, desperately trying not to hyperventilate.
Voldemort sat at the head of the table, gazing haughtily at his most trusted followers. Lucius shouldn’t really be here, but Voldemort couldn’t be bothered to tell him to leave.
Draco sighed and took a measured sip so they each had the same amount in their glasses, and held it up. “On three?”
“Give me that invisibility cloak of yours - I know you have it - and I’ll get you some food from the kitchen.” Potter rolled his eyes, but clearly knew when he was beat, and gestured towards his bag. Draco pulled out the silken material, wrapped it around himself, and said “I’ll be back soon. I can’t believe you’re making me do this. Git.”
Harry’s eyes widened at the realisation, and he quickly turned back to his charms assignment, trying not to betray his crisis to Draco. However, it was a bit difficult to explain the differences between
“Alright.” Draco raised an eyebrow at Potter’s compliant attitude, but levelled his wand with Potter’s forehead. Potter didn’t so much as flinch, just maintained a steady eye contact with Draco.
I feel like I had other stuff to say but I cannot remember lmao, I hope you’re all staying safe and have a lovely rest of 2020!
Three days in, when she was gritting her teeth as she scrubbed dishes, she decided to talk to Ron. Trusting her, he called a family meeting - Molly, Arthur, the twins, Ginny, Bill, and Fleur all gathered in the kitchen.
Remus frowned — what was this about? He’d recounted his story in the dining room — he’d seen Death, who’d informed him of things, and then he’d been essentially booted out of the afterlife and woken up in the forest.
Hence the Malfoy stalking. Well, nobody had called him out on it yet, but Harry was drawn to him in an odd way. Nothing bad - Harry was pretty sure Malfoy wasn’t up to something, and was usually right about these things - but Malfoy looked paler and more closed off than normal, despite four of his friends returning to Hogwarts.
She walked back to the common room, a soft smile on her face. She easily slotted herself back into Ron’s side, mind racing as she let the conversation wash over herself. Ron sent her a questioning look, but she nudged him in the side, a simple action that clearly said
Now it was Harry staring at him, defenceless, hands by his side, not a muscle tense. Draco reached into the bond and just felt...acceptance. Draco shook his head no - this was not happening. He would not kill Harry, his soulmate.
Even though he didn’t think he had anything left, his magic left his body, reaching out to Draco, and Harry doubled over in pain. He took deep breaths, and distantly, someone held his shoulders, tried to talk to him; but all he could feel was Draco’s pulse, still getting weaker, even as Harry’s magic drained to dregs, the bond asking for magic Harry couldn’t deliver.
Harry looked down at his own fingers, dutifully wrapped around the pestle and holding the mortar in place. His fingernails were blunt and bitten, although he couldn’t remember biting them. The skin was dark, with little scars all over, and his left hand was marred by the words
“You’ll be in for a grilling when you come downstairs,” Severus said, sweeping out of the room before Draco could reply.
“Yes, I’d have to agree. I’m going to get you some food and potions and stuff, and,” he paused to delicately sniff at the air, “run you a bath. You need to get out of this bloody bed.”
Draco insisted on checking Harry’s magical core, which Severus decreed was fully healed — but was also smaller than he was expecting. Harry frowned — the ball of magic was about the size of a basketball, which he thought was very respectable (and it’s about how you use it anyway, right?), though one thing was missing.
“Well have a go, at least - clear your mind and - what are you doing?” Harry was making a weird face, scrunching up his nose and eyebrows. He looked quite adorable, in Draco’s opinion.
“I might as well make some money - thirty-five minutes.” Draco, Millie and Pansy all turned to Theo, shocked that he’d spoken, as he smirked slightly.
Despite giving Bellatrix and Fenrir access to the door, only Lucius had been delivering his food. Likely a punishment by Voldemort.
After the footsteps of everyone had gone up the stairs, Narcissa sat at the table. Before she could say anything, Harry jumped in.
catastrophe. Hermione could bring him his work, and teach him - she’d probably jump at the chance to learn the work better anyway.
He felt intense pain shoot through his scar as Bellatrix pressed down on the mark, before a wave of joy from Voldemort shot through him. He didn’t have time to consider the implications before Bellatrix screeched
