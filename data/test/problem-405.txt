“Why does that physically hurt you?”
“Hey Hermione,” Harry answered the phone, having seen her name pop up on the screen. “What’s up?”
It was when Draco opened the book, already curled into Harry’s side that things changed. Draco had moved as far away from Harry as was possible to do so on the sofa and, when he looked to see what was wrong, Draco had replaced the contentment on his face with his old, sharp Malfoy mask, refusing to come out of it.
Deep down he knew he was being petty and that Draco being alive after saving his life was much more important to focus on than the fact that he wouldn’t bloody wake up on his own birthday. But Harry needed him to wake up. His own recovery from the ambush was over and he was being sent on another case, with Ron this time, and it sounded like a long one.
While Draco was in the bath, hopefully doing as he’d requested and relaxing, Harry went about lighting the candles in the bedroom and bringing Draco’s favourite chocolates up from the secret stash he kept behind the pan draw in the pantry.
Draco told himself that it wasn’t a lie, that Potter was right about his way of thinking when they bumped into each other just over a year ago. But he knew it wasn’t the reason for demanding that Robards send him wherever they are, and he was pretty sure that Robards knew it too. But Draco just stared him down until he got what he wanted. He had yet to relinquish all his pretentiousness.
“Um..well let me say this first, you weren’t my first choice,” she said drifting off and fidgeted nervously.
After Draco had finished talking to Hermione instead of going back to the Slytherin dungeons he found himself again walking through the halls. He tried to tell himself that it was so he could think about what just went down. But really, in the back of his mind he knew he was looking for Harry.
It was then that Draco stopped his pacing. Because to his right was a door that was not there before. Starting to think that the painting may have done a little more damage than he thought, he touched the door to make sure it was solid.
About half an hour later he had entered a section of Hogwarts he’d never been before. Draco knew he was on the seventh floor but other than what floor he was on he had no clue where he was or how to get back to the Slytherin dormitories.
Draco sputtered, “W-what! What are you talking about?!”
“Draco,” it said. It was faint. It was feminine. And it was most certainly behind him. Turning around he began to scowl when it automatically deflated. It was Hermione, and after a quick survey of the hall he had found that she was alone. It looked as if she had been crying recently. Her eyes red and puffy. It reminded him of Pansy and he couldn’t be a jerk when a crying girl comes to him in need of help. As cold hearted as he seemed to be, he just couldn’t do it.
Chapter two is finally here yaaay. Currently working on chapter 3 with my friend. Tell me if you all like where this is going :)
“You know exactly what I’m talking about.”
“You’ve told me shit.”
“You’re very welcome.
“What did I do, love?”
He waited, holding his breath for close to a minute before letting out a frustrated groan and marching back up to his own office. Not long after he’d found the focus to start working again, a violet memo floated through the gap underneath his closed door and up onto his desk.
thinks it is,” Draco had muttered back, flipping quickly through the pages of his book, smoothing down the corners of all the pages.
Harry smiled at the realisation, hope and love and excitement building in his chest. He had seen it in Draco, the touches, the smiles, the words he used. The way he’d curled his lithe frame around Harry the night Harry ran. The way he said Harry’s name, softly, murmured in peaceful sleep against Harry’s jaw.
“Yes, well, that’ll happen if you end things with a seemingly untouchable Quidditch star.”
“Yes! Please, Uncle Draco.” Teddy was using the cushions as a trampoline now, holding onto the back of the sofa.
Draco just chuckled deep in his chest. “You read my book.”
What he didn’t count on was the voice that spoke from the direction of another locker slightly to his right. His sure steps faltered but he couldn’t stop lest the git pay any particular attention to his chest.
“And Ron’s the sixth child, just so you know,” the git chuckled, and Draco scrambled off his knees to pull him into a hug.
He promptly crossed his little legs and landed on his backside, still grinning up at Draco expectantly.
He raised his wand into the air and, for the first time, in a long time, shouted the words
, Harry squeezed the long, pale fingers once and walked out of the room
. For letting me join you and Teddy.”
“Don’t,” he warned, face screwing up in pain. Potter’s face screwing up in confusion.
“I know, Teddy. I’m sorry. We were supposed to meet my mother for dinner.”
. He was lost.
The bright blue head of his Aunt’s grandson popped up above the back of the sofa next to Harry.
“You left?”
, before snatching it himself. A perfunctory nod at Potter and a quick turn on his heel and he was gone, wand back in hand.
“Don’t make me regret it, Malfoy,” she said sternly before moving to serve her other customers.
“Draco? Draco? I couldn’t figure out how to undo the damn spell to let me out. I wanted a hiding place and the damn thing gave me a bloody good place to hide but then I couldn’t un-hide.” Draco uncovered his face and stared up at the green eyes smiling down at him.
“Who wrote the songs?” Draco asked.
And then to something more. A bond forming from that understanding, pulling them closer, entwining themselves in each other as they had always done, but in healing rather than anger.
“Is everything okay, Draco?” Harry had asked, puzzled.
“Yes, Draco. I heard everything you said,” Potter smiled warmly and looked down at their hands which had, at some point, joined together.
Eventually though, the clouds and the storms and the swirling sea reminded Harry of other things.
Harry stared at the prone form in the hospital bed as he had been doing every day for the past week. “
“Hello, Draco.”
He heard a short huff from the man wrapped in his arms and they fell into comfortable silence for a minute before Draco spoke again.
And then Potter was leaning forwards, his eyes on Draco’s lips, his tongue darting out to wet his own. Draco took in a sharp breath and surged forwards, meeting Potter’s lips and sighing as they parted for him. His knees felt weak and for once, nothing felt like a lie. He wouldn’t have to lie about Potter, to himself, to others, to the man himself, ever again.
And then he fell into the arms of his childhood nemesis, the two of them struggling to cope with the surprising loneliness of a post-war wizarding Britain.
“Christ, Malfoy. How have you got like this after five glasses? Didn’t peg you as a lightweight,”
The portkey sent him straight to the initial safe house which Draco already knew would be empty because they wouldn’t have gone quiet ten days ago if they were still there. It wasn’t anything fabulous – a three room, bare brick building on a rather barren hillside. He quickly set about searching for the warded compartment that housed maps and photographs of all the other safe houses in the area.
of all things, if you want.”
“When I realised I love you.”
Draco pulled back and stared shocked into Harry’s face.
Harry’s life had always come down to that. First Lily’s, then Narcissa’s, and now, surprisingly, his own for Draco and Draco’s for him.
He found the No-Maj who owned a derelict building on a large piece of land and paid to take it off his hands there and then. The western boundary was made up of the edge of a cliff that fell away into the rolling waves of the Pacific Ocean. Spruce, pine and fir trees covered the rest of the land, sheltering his new lodgings from the wild, winter weather.
“You prat! You absolute wanker!”
It wasn’t until he fell into bed with him though, that Harry ran.
“Sure, love,” Harry had said, rolling onto his side to wrap around Draco’s slim frame.
Draco raised an eyebrow at Potter again and mouthed
But the waves also morphed as he watched them, twisting into the powerful muscle and dangerous stripes he had seen in the tiger that had prowled around his living room, ensuring he made it home from the club. He chuckled, remembering the scare he’d had the first time, so far gone on the drink and opening the door to see the massive silvery creature pacing the room. Malfoy’s voice from the tiger had shocked him enough into taking a sobering potion. He didn’t know when Malfoy had learnt the patronus charm, nor why his was a tiger, but Harry had seen it every night that he’d left Malfoy a bit worse for wear after their conversations over a bottle of firewhisky.
In the morning, despite Harry being the one who had an early meeting with Kingsley, Draco seemed to have already left the house. Although not without leaving a few notes.
Harry had fallen alright.
He told Draco,
don’t get to call me that. You left. Just went and bloody disappeared.”
is,” Draco said, stepping out of the floo and looking around the carpeted living room with large, comfortable sofas and unmoving family photographs on wallpapered walls.
“Granger is still waiting for
He walked out of the bathroom, smiling at the astonishment he could see on Draco’s face.
The parchment stayed blank for a long time after Potter had returned his wand. It had been there on his desk since the evening of his own birthday, a few hours after Potter had approached him in the Apothecary of all places and held his wand out; the wand that Potter had snatched from his grip in his own home – not that it had been any home to him at that moment in time. Draco had stared at it a moment, held comfortably between the calloused fingers of
“I know love,” he had sighed, placing a kiss on Draco’s temple and rolling over.
An older fellow called Kirk was on the service desk and disappeared into the dark rows of shelves to look for Draco when Harry had asked for him, only to return with a frown on his face.
still hasn’t replaced the milk.”
“Shh Uncle Draco.”
Sighing, he took another random location out of his pocket and disapparated, casting the spell again when he landed in the correct place. Still nothing.
Draco sighed. “He called me a…he said…” He had to close his eyes a second and take a deep breath before continuing in a rush. “Apparently nowhere will hire a good-for-nothing Death Eater.”
A tanned hand reached out to lay lightly over Draco’s left forearm, but he flinched back from the touch.
Draco stepped out of the shower, much needed after a long training session, and wrapped a towel around his waist before rolling the knots out of his shoulders that the hot water had missed. His wet hair was dripping down over his eyes as he rolled his neck, but he knew the way by now from the shower across the room to his locker.
“I heard that.”
Hannah had looked surprised to see him there in the middle of the afternoon, alone, and had initially tried to get him talking, but gave up when she realised that he was just going to stare into his drink until he could see the bottom of the glass. Every time he could, he just asked for another drink and repeated the process all over again. He couldn’t allow himself to stare at the wooden bar too long through the bottom of an empty glass without thinking about the hard eyes he’d had to put up with for the past three years, hard, brown eyes which he’d once thought were assertive and ridiculously sexy.
“You sent them into another war?” Draco blinked incredulously. “Their
Afterwards, as they lay stroking light fingertips over each other’s chests, pressing feather-light kisses to shoulders, jaws and closed eyelids, Harry sighed and asked what he needed to know.
“There’s lions and giraffes and monkeys and a bird and they all sing, Uncle Draco. Did you know lions could sing?”
“I wouldn’t mind, you know. Being yours. So Happy Birthday!” Draco laughed drily. “You get
true about Draco. It just wasn’t the most important reason why Harry would be pleased to work alongside him.
Harry caught the fists that were still pummelling his chest, holding them tightly in his own, staring into those icy eyes that held so much fire.
He didn’t hear anything from Draco all morning and, when he hadn’t turned up to see if Harry was free for lunch, Harry had given it half an hour before walking down to the archives to see where his boyfriend was.
Draco laughed the hardest yet at Zazu singing ‘
“Oh, for goodness sake,” Harry had thrown his hands up in exasperation, not caring that he looked like an idiot when he shouted into the gloom, “Draco, I’m sorry for whatever the bloody hell I did, alright. Please just talk to me.”
Draco had to look up at Potter because obviously the animals must have been singing on the film, but animals definitely could not actually sing.
Robards nodded at him with an impressed smirk on his face before handing him a red docket.
“Bloody hell,” he heard Potter mutter. Then, “give him the sixth, Hannah, my responsibility. I’ll have one, too.”
“He also said, Sir, that ‘
It had started out okay, despite spending the summer grieving for those he had lost. He held the Weasleys together and they did the same for him in turn. But, when Hermione and Ginny went back to Hogwarts, and Neville and Ron began their training with the Aurors, it was as if life went back to normal for them. Life carried on.
He could see Draco searching the depths of his eyes and whatever he sought, he must have found it because he visibly relaxed and Harry pulled him into a tight hug.
Potter was smirking at him, actually smirking. It was such a bizarre sight that Draco started laughing.
“I said don’t, please,” he whimpered as Potter grasped his hand and lifted his arm, unbuttoning the cuff of his shirt and rolling the sleeve back to reveal the bruise purpling over his redundant Dark Mark.
should already know what they did.”
“And leave you like this? I don’t think that’ll be good for anyone, Malfoy.”
Yeah, Harry kept berating himself. A pretty intense curse that was meant for me. And it was Draco’s bloody birthday. If he wasn’t going to wake up today, when else would he.

Harry told himself it wasn’t a lie as he smiled at Draco. Not really. Because all that

But Draco had scooted away from him with a grunt and refused to open his eyes, even though Harry knew Draco had felt the bed shift as he leant up on an elbow to look confusedly down at his boyfriend.
,” the healers kept telling him.
He’d ran thinking it was a mistake, but it was this that was the mistake. Running an ocean and a continent away from that comfort, that understanding. Being far from Malfoy, far from
The evergreen of the trees surrounding the house began to remind Harry of the green walls of the Manor’s study. Walls that had been witness to tales of the muggle world, of pureblood politics, of family who meant well and family who didn’t. Memories of friends who had been lost were spilled before those walls, as were the tears for them. Two boys, forced to grow up far too fast, their worlds brimming with fire and pain, rage and torment. An understanding forming between them.
“Teddy,” Draco warned, “please stop jumping on the sofa. It’s not good manners.”
but the link was clear.
He opened his eyes and looked directly into Potter’s which looked surprisingly angry. He knew his own must look pitiful. Potter blinked a few times, his suddenly tense shoulders moving with ragged breaths as the anger in his eyes dissipated.
After studying the photos and locations carefully, Draco held one in his hands along with his wand and shoved the rest in a pocket on his left side before spinning away to the first safe house he’d chosen at random.
“Well, so did yours that first time.”
“He had said it before, every time I mentioned getting a job. But this time it was something I really wanted to do, was really excited about. I’ve been a bit of a potions hobbyist and wanted to go for an opening at St Mungo’s. Prepared a portfolio and everything, full of what I’d been creating, all the healing potions. I made the mistake of showing him it, how proud I was of it, of wanting to do something good.” Draco stopped and took a long sip again, feeling Potter’s gaze on him. He turned to meet those piercing eyes.
“He did this?” Potter asked unnecessarily. Draco looked away from it, already knowing what Potter was seeing. A large, plum handprint curling around his forearm and squeezing tightly.
They watched Teddy dance around the room a moment before they spoke again.
“It’s alright, Potter. We’ll get used to bumping into one another, I’m sure,” he drawled, praising Merlin, Circe and Morgana when his voice sounded unaffected.
“Can we go and find Ron now? We had to split up and I have no idea where he went.”
After the war, Harry fell. He fell
“For you, love,” he said, kissing Draco’s temple before setting his feet down on the floor and handing him a glass of the wine. “Relax, please.”
After a successful apparition, he put the information of that safe house in a pocket on his right side and cast a useful spell to reveal any recent magical signatures. Nothing.
He carried on quickly towards his locker and his clothes, his skin feeling flusher than it had in the heat of the shower.
King, Potter. Seriously?” He crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow at the back of Potter’s messy head. “You’re tainting the child already. And it’s we
“You will have to read the briefing first, in here so I know you’ve done so. It has all the initial intelligence as well as the updates sent in by Aurors Potter and Weasley. Last contact was ten days ago.”
He kept his back to Potter while he buttoned up a crisp white shirt and pulled on a pair of black briefs, then turned around only to see Potter pulling on a polo shirt. His eyes grew wide and he shut them quickly, gaining a hold on himself. Since when did the man have abs!
“Potter?” He spoke quietly after a few deep breaths. “Potter, please. If you can hear me, let me in. Are you even in there? I don’t even know what house you own to be able to do this kind of magic. Some magical building must have let you in on this secret somehow. Or was it Weasley? Very possible with the way his place looks. Obviously, his parents know about it, but Weasley technically shouldn’t as the fifth, sixth, however many-eth child.
“Draco Malfoy,” she looked at him sternly. “I know for a fact you were raised better than that.” She stood behind the bar, a striped tea towel slung over her shoulder and her hands on the curve of her hips. He’d have preferred if those hands were already reaching for the bottle of Ogdens on the shelf behind her.
“We’s watching Lion King, Uncle Draco!” Teddy exclaimed with a massive grin on his face.
“Get me a portkey. Now.”
Draco groaned upon hearing the smooth, low voice that sounded from behind him.
should have pressed that shirt’.”
They did and, running down the drive towards him, barefoot of all things, was Draco. Draco, who flung his arms around Harrys neck before pulling back to check Harry over, throwing punches at his chest when he realised that Harry was fine.
“Do you need a hand here, Hannah?”
.” Harry grinned back, stressing the surname.
The first portkey pulled him from the lodge to New York, the second to the Ministry in London after an anxious seven-hour wait. Finally, he was twisting away to the Manor gates, willing them to open for him.
Potter nodded. “This,” he said, shaking Draco’s arm slightly, “is not who you are now. It’s not even who you were, not really. Don’t let it stop you from what you want to do. And never let anyone tell you that it will.”
He could only hope that it would be this easy.
,” he hissed, “are those of child soldiers in a fight that the responsible adults ignored until it was too late.”
The Magical Transport Department of MACUSA were extremely helpful in suggesting somewhere quiet for him to spend a few months, to recuperate from the war, handing him a two-way portkey to Washington – the State that is.
“Is she there?”
, Harry thought with a roll of his eyes as he jogged up to him.
“And what’s that supposed to mean?”
“Alright, so where are you in it?” Draco asks, relaxing back into the sofa.
He tried again, and again until the fifth time, the spell caught something. The remains of some household magic; the ancient kind of family magic that you can only learn by owning a magical house. He scanned again for the trace and held it in his mind, expanding the signature not just for the type of spell, but specifically what it had been used for.
“You mean it don’t you?” he realised.
“They didn’t know where you were.”
magical influences. Considering their experiences, the European Coalition agreed that Aurors Potter and Weasley were best suited to infiltrate the situation, lay low, identify the target and extract them.”
Harry let Draco out of his arms and began moving towards the imposing building ahead of him, turning to walk backwards when he was a few paces away from the other man, a grin on his face.
Draco felt a glass knock into his knuckles and raised his head to smile at Hannah.
thankful that Potter had saved them. Except, Draco knew there were other reasons that he was thankful for Potter’s individual survival, reasons that he refused to delve into. He was quite content with them bubbling away beneath the surface.
“All right then…” Harry had stared at his boyfriend a moment longer, unable to pick out any hints in his face, resolving to let Draco work through whatever it was and come back to him.
to rsvp.”
They had been perfectly fine at dinner last night. He’d cooked cottage pie, a throwback to their time at Hogwarts, and they had followed it up with a treacle tart that Draco had bought on his way back from Gringotts. It had been a wonderfully normal evening until they’d curled up together on the couch.
“You’re welcome, Draco. Now, why were you looking for me anyway?” He grinned.
Before Draco got back from the shops, Harry was going to draw his boyfriend a bath, light those candles he knew he liked, and bring a bottle of the Cotes du Rhone Narcissa had gifted them up from the cellar.
After running out of air, Draco sat in silence for a moment, listening for the slightest sound. When he didn’t hear anything, he carried on speaking because he knew that this had to be it. He refused to give up hope. Especially when it came to Potter.
The turbulent waves that rolled - horses, Malfoy had once called them as they sat in a lonely little café near Aberystwyth – reminded him of the patronus he hadn’t been able to cast since the Battle, since he died. The stag that had abandoned him, taking with it the last tangible connection to his parents.
“Well,” Draco drawled, smirking as he stalked towards Harry, stroking his cheek with his thumb. “I suppose this will do.”
“Ten days!” Draco practically exploded but closed his eyes and took five deep, steadying breaths. “Alright. Assuming intel is ten days out of date.”
“Nothing,
He used his words, first and foremost, to thank Potter for returning his wand, but then the thankfulness continued to spill onto the page. Thankful that he and his mother were not in Azkaban. Thankful that his father was. Thankful for coming back for him in the Room of Hidden Things. Thankful that Potter had lived so he was able to save them all, to save everything, from the Dark Lord.
Harry didn’t focus on the film. He’d seen it enough times with Teddy already. Instead, he watched the bright colours flicker across Draco’s face, the images reflecting in his eyes. His smile every time he looked at the excitement on Teddy’s face. The slight bob of his head during the songs and the barely audible laugh when Rafiki hit Simba on the head.
"Err. Because you'd hit me..." Harry said wincing as he rubbed his shoulder.
Ron rolled his eyes, “So where is Draco? Is he let me guess, at work? Doing his actual job?” Ron commented.
“Where is the nursery going to go exactly?” Scorpius questioned.
“Hey Potter! Heard your parents away this summer? Party at yours?” A tall handsome teen grinned.
“Good. I’m glad it hurts!” Draco said, shoulders heaving. “I have to give birth in five months.”
Harry pouted further.
“You didn’t tell me a thing. You just disappeared” Harry said shoving Draco. “You abandoned me.”
Harry almost chuckled but stopped. “Yes, pretty bad. I got checked into St Mungo’s. They thought I’d been hit by a Confundus charm” Harry admitted.
Harry sighed. “Go home” he said firmly.
“I know which means you’ll be even more sensitive" He leaned in close his fingers digging into the back of Harry's head. "I do love hearing you moan," Draco said as he licked Harry's neck before running his teeth over it.
“Has Dad agreed?” Albus asked.
"You quit being an Auror" Ron said with equal shock.
“Hello?” came the tired voice of Harry.
“Almost done, although I wanted to kill Draco after those IKEA cribs he picked out.”
Draco woke up in a chair and jerked forward in panic. "It's fine. Harrys Fine" Sirius said putting his hand on Draco's shoulder.
“Draco. Dinner!” Mum called, Draco butted out the cigarette, and looked back but the two teens were gone.
Ron shook his head. “Something is wrong here. I can feel it…”
“We have to help” Harry groaned, legs spread and pants around his ankles.
“He mentioned going for a run around the garden," Hermione said with a shrug.
“No!”
“It still scares me. Albus and Scorpius want to move out, but... I sort of forbade them. I’m just worried that if anything does happen to me, I want all my family here,” Draco admitted.
“Is that different from now?” Ron questioned.
“That’s not a normal wolf howl, is it?” Ron frowned.
“Home that bad?” She asked.
Lily sighed. “Papa, please stay off Tiktok.”
“Ah. How about Rubeus?” Harry asked, brightly.
“Are you going to kick us all out then?” James asked.
"Mother" Draco said tensely in the door. "I wasn't expecting you. Are you well?" He asked hesitantly.
“Or maybe. And hear me out. Draco actually broke up with you, and this was his way of going. I don’t want to date you anymore.”
"Speed dating night at the leaky. Draco and I started snogging after a couple of rounds" Harry explained.
"Yes. Probably be a boy. No girls in generations. So, it's likely a boy" Harry said taking Draco's hand and placing it on his belly. "He kicks like an expert."
“Gee. That’s making me feel better” Ron said reaching under his cloak for his wand.
Draco nodded. “Sure Potter, I look forward to being your next sexual conquest” He drawled.
“Because home is what is exhausting me,” Harry admitted, before taking his glasses off and rubbing his eyes. “Draco has been... sick,” admitted Harry, uncertain if he should admit Draco’s pregnancy given that Hermione was his Boss.
“You and Potter were the only real things in there. Your actions to each other were the only real things there” Snape commented. “I better get you to Madame Pomfrey Draco” Snape said leading Draco out.
“Someone who wants isolation” Hermione’s voice drifted from the tent.
“Biscuits and cream?” Ginny questioned squinting.
“Potter...Potter”
Harry woke up in bed with a start, shuddering as he felt his body. He was untouched, no cuts nothing. He lay back and sighed in relief as he stared at the ceiling. It was a vaulted stone roof and Harry suddenly realised he had absolutely no clue where he was. He felt his head and felt cloth tied around it awkwardly. Harry was laid out on a four-poster bed, varnished mahogany that had intricate carvings on its surface. He slid off the side and he couldn’t help but notice the wolf heads carved onto each post. The walls were draped in a tapestry rich greens of a forest in spring, with figures naked lithe bodies, plump and soft doing all sorts of things. Harry felt his cheeks blush, the stitching had more detail than Harry thought possible. He felt his erection stir becoming firm in his trousers. He loosened his trousers and took his member out, pleasuring himself it felt good. He came across his belly and smiled euphorically. He walked to the sturdy oak door and tried the handle; it was obviously locked. “Let me out!”  Harry said thumping his hands on the heavy door.
"I'll check with the house elf" Narcissa said firmly. "Perhaps you should finish getting dressed."
Harry handed Draco a vodka sunrise in a cocktail glass. The red and orange blending nicely. “Well. Alright...” Harry nodded.
“I got another letter from your father” Mum said as she stood in the doorway. She was still dressed in her uniform from the chip shop her dark hair with its blond streaks looking patchy. Her face lined with dark bags under her eyes. “He’s in Majorca apparently” she rolled her eyes dismissively. “Still he sent a child support check.”
“Shan’t. Especially when you still have abs and I jiggle”
Draco blushed, “Yes.”
By the end of the day Draco was close to pulling his hair out, no prank, nothing. Harry wasn’t one to sit back, and do nothing. There had to be something. By five there was nothing for it, Draco stormed to Harry's desk. “Well. Are you going to prank me Potter?”
Harry rolled his eyes. "Fuuuny..."
"Lay off him" Harry protested. "And Fine Yes, I'll see if they're free to come around for Dinner..."
“Well, how about Arthur Lucius Potter?”
Draco just nodded. Harry realised Draco was crying silently. Harry embraced him tightly, he felt Draco go a little limp and relax into Harry's tight hug. "I just didn't think they'd..."
"Don't apologise" Mrs Malone insisted. "Nerves are perfectly reasonable. Harry you'll need to start pushing soon. Make sure you breathe like you've been practicing."
"Huh," Harry said suddenly jolting forward, papers scattering as he was prevented from drifting off to sleep.
"I can handle it" Draco insisted.
Harry shot Ron an unimpressed glance. "See I can't even tell you if you're angry at me. Your face could be frozen."
Scorpius blinked, and realised they were waiting for an answer. “Oh. Yeah. Umm sure!” Scorpius nodded still a little reeling.
Harry looked at Draco confused and then beamed.
“Yes sir” Draco said embarrassed.
Caelum squinted at him. “So, we’re just ignoring Papa being angry at you?”
"I don't want to yell at him" Harry frowned. "I want him here. I don't care about his job. I need him here with me" Harry pouted. Sirius winced, Harry wasn't exactly the most stable person when he was hormonal and often went from wanting to cast a killing curse to Crying in moments.
Hermione did a double take. “Ha...him? Why him?” She said staring at Draco in disbelief.
Harry was pregnant almost a year later, although this time there was no speeding through it. Which both he and Draco were grateful for. Although as ever Draco spoiled Harry completely making sure he pampered every moment of it.
Harry nodded; he felt the weight pushing against his hole. Everything was moving. Panic started to rise,
Ron glowered. "Not funny."
"Harry's Pregnant. It's mine. Commence your shock and Adulations" Draco said firmly and simply. Hermione and Ron stared as their eyes lowered to Harry's stomach.
The bedroom door and Molly walked in, "Now we've all had a hold, but I think you to deserve some time together" She said approaching the bed and holding out the bundle. "He's a sweet little boy." Harry cuddled him against his chest. Draco put an arm around Harry. He pressed against his cheek and kissed it. Proud and tired and staring at their perfect son.
“Bloody hell, we don’t want trouble okay. We were just passing through anyway” Ron muttered. “We’re only in the area to track down Malfoy, his bloody boyfriend.”
"Are they organized?" Narcissa asked worried. "I heard some rumours about an incident at the ministry and I started to worry."
“Go ahead” Draco smiled wryly.
Harry blushed and tied his robe closed. Ignoring Draco growling under his breath. “What’s taken you both so long.”
Narcissa nodded and sipped her tea.
Draco laughed and smiled a little. “What’s for dinner?”
"Devon" Harry said as he caught a glimpse of his belly in the mirror and started to get self-conscious. "I'm not too big, am I?" he asked hesitant.
Draco pulled Harry onto the bed and curled his legs around him ensnaring him. “Potter your body is too desirable to hide. Especially with child inside you.”
“Can we at least get masks?" Albus asked, sneezing as he walked down the stairs.
“Me?”
"Neither of us will be going by Mom" Draco said with a smirk. "I'm sure we'll figure it out."
“Finally. There better be a pub” Ron muttered.
“Beautiful is debatable. They are half of Harry’s genetics!” Draco commented.
"Perfectly..." Lucius soured. "I think you better leave Draco."
"What did your parents say?" Ron asked curiously.
He sat down and looked up and down at Harry confused. “I’m Ron by the way. Ron Weasley” he said like it was obvious.
The faces of their five practically adult children were a picture: a combination of shock and horror.
Draco piled his pencil case onto his notebooks and shoved it all under his arm, walking out into the crowded melee. Students from first form to seventh form all barging and jamming against each other as they tried to make their way down the busy corridor to their lockers. Draco wrinkled his nose, as the smell of unwashed sweaty teenagers filled his nostrils. He made his way out into the courtyard where a group of first years were playing down ball on a square marked out on the Asphalt with a tennis ball. Against a red brick art building a series of metal lockers which jammed into a wire cage that ran along the courtyard. Draco walked in and moved over to his bottom locker, he squatted and turned the dial in his hand. It opened and Draco retrieved his lunch a thermos of tea and eight sandwiches’. He carried them over to a bench near the library, it was undercover and out of the way from the rest of the school. He ate in silence, ignoring the students as they passed. He screwed up the plastic wrap and dropped it in the bin. “There you are faggot” Matthew Curtis said grabbing Draco’s collar and tugging him back, as his off-sider Declan Booker cracked his knuckles.
“I’m supposed to be seeing a friend. If he doesn’t come soon. I’ll come home” Draco said.
Draco had also picked out an outfit for Harry, black and fitted around the curve that was obvious when he wore anything figure hugging. With a velvet jacket he didn't know he owned. Harry changed into them and caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror.
“You diet. That’s like saying you’ll play lacrosse!” Otto breaking into a fit of laughter.
Harry gasped, and Ron Howled coming charging toward the Reverend.
“Ron! What do you mean his parents are alive here?” Hermione said staring at Ron mutinously.
“I’m only twelve inches. It’s not very big” Harry shrugged.
Draco saw Harry walking back up to his private school friends. “Him” Draco said with a smirk.
Harry looked up, shutting the folder. “No, I don’t. You don’t usually drop into my office” Harry ventured leaning back comfortably.
"Yes" Draco insisted. Reaching over and rubbing Harry's belly. "I'm putting you though having a baby. I wouldn't be comfortable with anything else."
“Enough Talking the pair of you!” A gruff man said prodding them both with the end of the broom. “More kindling, we want the daemons to Burn.”
Sirius smirked. "Aren't you kept."
“I want to bloody hex that Reverend.”
"That's amazing" Harry groaned grinning.
Another round of fireworks went off, closer this time. Instinctively Draco was round the other side of the bar in seconds. “Sit” he instructed taking Harry’s shaking hands. “Relax” he encouraged firmly, “Go sit down, please?” Draco insisted, pouting a glass of water.
“Harry, I told you about mating Season” Hermione lectured.
“Oh. Wait, why doesn’t Arthur have a middle name?” Harry asked.
“Yes fine, fine. But killing a Vampire is low down on my lis...” Draco paused. “There is option B which is quicker...”
"Please he's only a vampire. Leave him to it, although if he goes anywhere near Harry, I will cast Incendio, and he'll go up like a Roman candle."
Harry smirked and rubbed his belly. "Well. You've only got yourself to blame."
Harry picked up the pot and pulled back the beer tap, there was a slight rumble and it regurgitated foamy golden coloured beer. He flipped it off and tapped it on the catch tray to settle it, before placing it on the bar. “There Ron” Harry smirked.
"Can you tell we've given up? The children are going to run rings around us,” Draco commented, rubbing his belly. “We’re not lucky enough to have four easy children.”
"Hmmm?" Narcissa said thoughtfully. "Draco seems…"
Harry looked up and smirked. “Hello Draco.”
“You're an orphan Harry, I’m not going to say no if that’s what you want” Draco reflected. “As long as our child is healthy.”
“Slytherin,” Harry prompted. “That’s why Scorpius and Albus are your favourites.”
“Err...” said Harry, hesitating. “I’ll tell you once your brothers and Lily come down.”
“Papa. We don’t,” Albus commented. “Isn’t that why we’re clearing the attic?”
Harry smiled and climbed off the bed. Then, as if they had all timed it together, four very loud cries came down the corridor. “I’ll go check on them and then get started on your bath. I don’t want you lifting a finger for at least two weeks.”
“Higher.”
Harry leant back in his chair considering, his eyes narrowed. “You know. If you had bothered to pay attention a little bit more. Friendship wasn’t what was on offer”
“I thought you were going to the toilet?”
Harry winced and tugged open the bathroom door as Albus and Scorpius poked their heads out of their respective bedrooms.
"A statement ma'am..." Harry tensed.
“I wear contacts...” Harry said holding eyes open enough to show Ron. Not that he was sure why he was showing him. He’d never met this kid before today.
Then a contraction hit, and he slapped Draco firmly.
Draco looked up and there was one of the private school boys, he was chubby in the sort he’d gotten fat over puberty and his body was undecided if it should slim down again. “I lied” Draco said simply, rolling his eyes, then pointed across the road. “It’s just there...”
Draco stalked the circle and leaped at Reverend Trask. Who moved across the room at speed, and yet seemed completely casual about it. Hermione cast the charm once more, bathing the remaining congregation in fire.
Draco sat bolt upright and almost fell out of bed. "What?" He said. "Now?"
His mother wasn’t pleased, Draco had mentioned the father went to all boy’s school. But that was it. It was his mess, his problem. But that dream, he shuddered he could never seem himself hating anyone but the people who called him faggots on a daily basis. He looked at the alarm clock on bedside table. Nine o clock, he got up rubbing his eyes and fished around until he found a scrunched-up piece of paper with Harrys number on it. It was about time he knew. He walked into the kitchen and grabbed the phone calling Harrys mobile.
“Harry James Potter, get down here right now!” bellowed the voice. “I am not above using unforgivable curses. Do not test me!”
“Come on. You’re a fan of dogs, aren't you?” Draco grinned.
“Bi if it matters. Not that this lot cares” Draco muttered.
“Postponed,” Harry smirked, stirring a pot of pasta sauce.
“Yeah. It’s not like Professor Lupin, he’s still him sort of. But more basic. Protecting me, keeping me safe, not hurting me” Harry explained.
“Harry. I don’t trust them” Draco said turning to Harry.
“The excursion. We’re going to Windsor Castle remember?”
“Nice try Papa. No,” Scorpius replied.
"I knew you would love it" Draco smiled as he rubbed Harry's belly fondly. "Let's find you somewhere to sit, I'm certain that your feet already ache" Draco offered as he led Harry to a leatherback chair seated near the fireplace.
Draco’s hands curled around his stomach. “No. I don’t believe you” Draco said tears welling up in his eyes.
Harry winced and instinctively cupped his genitals. “What?”
“No,” Harry shrugged.
"Its listed under Rose-Mourn cottage" Harry said smirking.
“None of your business Weasley. Although can you do a call out for last drinks, I think we need to close early” Draco considered looking at Harry.
Draco sighed, “Sit. Although you’ll receive insults from now until next summer for associating with the School Faggot” Draco said grimacing.
Hermione's body slumped against the Reverend and he licked at her neck, messily drinking the blood that spilled out.
"Hello, James," Harry called out. "How was practice?"
“Mum!” Draco said staring trying not to laugh.
"Exactly." Harry smiled, already eating enthusiastically. Ron raised an eyebrow at Harry. "I'm hungry" Harry replied wolfing down Carbonara.
“Pregnant yeah” Harry rubbed his belly. “Three months down, six to go” he grinned amused.
“Sure” Harry relented.
“You're not the one who has to birth them,” Draco commented.
“If you bring out crystals you can leave,” Draco muttered flatly. “Honestly, I still can’t believe Luna got you interested in those.”
“You came over a tapestry over my ancestors. Merlin Potter” Draco chuckled and smirked confidently. “On the bed.”
“They are not witches, they are vampires!” One of the villagers declared.
“We’ll have more children than the Weasleys.”
"Oh, Ron," Hermione said. "We need to break his thrall."
“Yes. Get to class they’ll be here after your sixth period” The Headmaster explained.
Hermione nodded considering. “You don’t seem like the public-school type?” She questioned.
“But how did you know you wanted children with Dad?” Scorpius asked.
“No, nothing like that. It’s just – he’s having Quadruplets,” Harry said uneasily.
"Why! Didn't! You! Tell Us!" Hermione said slapping Harrys shoulder.
“Your very weird mate. What class are you in?” Otto squinted
“I missed you.”
"Thursday..." Harry replied grumpily.
"Two weeks. Thirteen and a half long, long, long days,” Draco muttered. “And because it’s quads. I can’t even get Harry to fuck it out of me.”
“You did it. I’m never not going to be impressed by you,” Harry said. “Do you need another pillow or a blanket?”
Draco’s eyes widened, “Granger that is impressive deduction. That does explain feelings I've had of late.”
Ron was wriggling trying to lift his feet away from the flames. “Malfoy. Could you...”
Draco shook his head. “Anyway, the easiest way to explain it is like this: the midwife will essentially remove the quads without actually cutting me open.”
"You write?" Harry questioned.
"Blimey Mate..." Ron said uncertain. "I know there's a baby in there. But blimey it's weird. You two both of you being dads."
"When is the baby due?" He asked the slightly nervous couple.
Harry gulped down the warm mead, the warmth in his throat making a considerable difference. "Thank you."
"Father. Harry is my boyfriend" Draco insisted firmly. "But there is some more news, perhaps you both should sit down..."
“So, we’re having a baby?”
“Thank you, I think I will” Harry nodded gently.
“I will master” Ron nodded, jaw slackening.
Harry nodded. He hadn't been practicing, it felt stupid. Harry began the shallow breaths, steadily. He could already feel the baby moving down inside him, it was quicker than he thought. The baby had 'dropped' at least a day ago, but now he felt the pressure the baby pushing past what must have been his prostate slowly.
“I’m okay,” Draco smiled. “Have you settled on the final name?”
“Maybe. I’ll have to get the butler out of the house because he’ll snitch to Mum in seconds” Harry smirked.
got awkward.
"We still need to choose a name?" Harry said with a mouthful of roasted quail breast.
“Otherwise, you start looking like Rita Skeeter. She looks like a melted candle,” Ginny grinned.
“Draco. I’m fine. Please, I need to manage this” Harry said standing up and glaring firmly.
“That howl is so close” Ron hissed quietly.
"Alright" Draco gave in. "Harry was far too reasonable, said I should give you a chance."
“Great” Draco sighed.
"Ron and Hermione" Harry corrected.
"Oh, Merlin. Harry put some pants on" Ron grimaced covering his eyes. "Or at least do the robe up."
“Lily. It’s his first breakup” His father offered as he embraced Harry. “We all have to cope somehow...”
“You, you fertile git! You're the problem!” Draco said; he was seething angrily, face flushing with rage.
“Potter. Do you believe in Magic?” Snape asked firmly.
“I prefer Babe” Harry grinned as he started preparing a sauce.
“He asked. And his dick is about a foot long” Draco murmured. Which received a horrified look from Hermione.
Trapped in a French chateau with a Boyfriend whose personality had gone from moody and stubborn. With a healthy side of brooding.
Draco whacked him. “Git!” he snapped. “Your children are doing this to me. And your previous ones gave me love handles!”
“Yes, we do. Now, Lily, do you want to pack a bag? The Midwife will be here in an hour and I assume you kids will want to be out of the house? I spoke to Nanna Weasley and you're all welcome to stay there if you like?" Harry suggested. "You can go to a friend, but let me know where.”
The front door slammed open and Draco and Harry’s oldest son James grunted unimpressed. He had dark hair and was the spitting image of Draco if he decided to dress up as Harry. "Hi," he grunted.
“We’ll wish me luck,” Harry said, putting down the bottle of shaving cream. “I’ll be right back.”
Harry felt himself starting to sweat. "Yeah. I kind of did."
"Anyway!" Harry said firmly. "How are you both?"
"Yes, i know, he invited me" Narcissa replied.
“It’s quite simple. This is an old family property of yours, correct?" Hermione asked Draco.
“It’s not a fight you two!” Hermione commented.
"You're back so soon?" Remus said putting the copy of the daily prophet down. Then saw the expressions on both of their faces. "Ah! Well. Join the club, Draco, but you’re welcome to stay here" Remus said standing up and putting an arm around Draco. "I'll even let you scorch your face on the Black Family Tree yourself."
Draco rolled his eyes. "I think I preferred when we weren't on speaking terms."
“Ron!” Hermione said horrified.
Draco turned to Ron and pulled at his shirt exposing his shoulders. At the base of his neck was the healed over puncher marks. Draco swore.
“I’m not walking around naked” Harry muttered trying not to moan as Draco licked and sensually rubbed his body.
Harry woke up in his bed sweating, he cupped his face. It was his room, he was probably just overheating, he got up his belly jiggling as he walked over to the window opening it to get some cool air. “It was a dream, right? Right?” He muttered to himself, but he wasn’t convinced it was too real.
Ron leaped up onto the banister and yanked a candelabra from its place with his teeth. Waving the lit candles at a vampire to keep back. As he planted himself at the bottom of the stairs.
“Well, if you want more help, invite your friends around. Who are you dating nowadays?" Draco suggested casually. “They could help?”
"Hello Sweetie" Mrs Malone said pouring a cup of tea, she had a wild tangle of curly strawberry blonde hair. "I'd offer you a mimosa, but you're a bit too pregnant for that." She joked, "Now you must be Harry and Draco." As she welcomed them both. The house was quaint, white walls and exposed dark wood beams.
, Voldemort
Hermione jabbed Ron. "Ron!"
“You kidnapped Harry.”
“Hear who?” Ron huffed. “But if it’s warm then sure.”
“I’ll grab it,” Harry nodded, yawning. He got up and found the file buried under a couple of leather-bound tomes. “Actually, I was meaning to talk. I’ll have to take some err leave in five months-ish,” Harry said handing over the file.
Draco would eat those words, the next day he arrived into work. He’d slipped into the Auror office, and shoved a few fireworks into a couple of the drawers. The morning had otherwise gone splendidly. Harry had completely avoided him, which started to unsettle him. He kept waiting to open a draw and see some sort of prank or trick and yet nothing.
"Ron" Hermione chastised. While also not quite trusting Draco either. Harry flashed Draco an uneasy look. "Tell them" Draco said gently, reaching around and stroking Harry's stomach.
“Thanks” Harry said rolling his eyes.
“That’s normal.”
As Harry left the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Draco slipped an hexed MP3 player. That would heat up and literally burn a whole through your pocket when turned on. Moments later he heard Harry swear out in the corridor, “Draco!” Harry snapped.
Harry waddled on the landing. Moving was helping, it made him focus on his swollen feet. Helped him stop focusing on the contractions.
The Reverend grinned and deflected her jinx with Ron's wand. A silver dagger the same one they'd seen on their first night, sat in his leather-gloved hand. He appeared Infront of her and dragged the dagger across her neck, slicing it open.
“Oh yeah...” Harry said nodding pulling on his Pyjama shirt it clung tightly and a slither off belly could be seen out the bottom. “Maybe I should diet...”
"We could ask them not too" Hermione muttered. "We weren't responsible for Herman and Elaine's deaths."
“Shhh. Do not give those beasts their name” The woman said her eyes wide in horror. “They will get inside your head. They will come here" She insisted as she handed out heavy woollen blankets.
Perhaps if Draco were to be diagnosed by a psychiatrist, or a therapist. They would say “Your latest obsession with pulling pranks is a clear sign of your loneliness.” Draco would obviously proceeded to ignore them and hex them at his earliest opportunity.
Mrs Malone gently draped the sheet a little further. Harry felt his face go redder and sweatier than it was. Mrs Malone patted his knee gently. "You're doing well"
“So, you’ll be by yourself this summer. Of course, the servants will still be around of course...” His mother admitted. “And No parties while we’re gone.”
“Yeah, well as long as it doesn’t make his ego any bigger” Ron grinned. “So, a Baby? Is it going to be a little dog boy?”
“Have to go home soon anyway. Work night you know what Hermione is like” Ron said sighing. “I’m surprised Draco even approves of you bartending, he probably thinks it beneath him or something pretentious like that.”
Draco sighed. "He's almost due. He's Almost Due" Draco repeated to himself.
Hermione squinted. “We’re not vampires! Herman and Elaine were killed by a Werewolves”.
"I thought I should be early. Not keep everyone waiting" Harry said feeling unsure of himself, struggling to look into Draco's eyes.
Draco smiled and kissed Harrys cheek.
Draco's face blinked and frowned. "I'm going to hex him."
Harry smiled and nodded exhausted, “I’m really tired” he muttered.
Draco looked firm. “I hope not. They should be waiting until marriage.”
"Was that a statement or a question?" Narcissa pressed flatly.
“Mione, come off it. Even I stopped listening when you started describing werewolf mating cycles” Ron scoffed. “Staring at the road was more interesting.”
"Might have shit myself. It's normal apparently" Harry chuckled quietly seeing the funny side. "But I love you to Draco."
"Have you decided who's going to be Dad and well Dad."
Draco sighed his shoulders slumping. “It would have been easier, if we’d stayed there.”
“Evidently Potter” Draco said struggling to get up. “This is the last thing I need. I thought this would disappear once we came out of there...”
"Nothing nearly as exciting as you too. So, when are you due?"
“An hour? It’s that soon?” Draco sighed. “Help me to the toilet. I refuse to defecate again in front of Lucinda.” He waved an arm at Harry. Harry smiled and gave Draco a supportive arm as he heaved himself out of bed.
"But!" Ron protested.
“Oh great...”
Harry made a face. "Did not need that image."
Draco smiled and pressed his head against Harry’s, “I am an Alpha Wolf. You are my mate; we are intertwined through emotional and magical bonds. As a Wolf, I have a period over a full moon usually where I become filled with the desire to conceive with my mate. You Potter in this case” Draco said as he drummed his fingers across Harry’s belly. Which had a slight swell underneath it. “I had wanted to avoid this occurrence, which was why I left in the first place.”
Ron looked over at Draco uncertain. "It's a hungry baby" Draco shrugged.
“I refuse to degrade my larynx by using American-isms. Cookies, indeed.”
” The voice echoed clear as day in his head.
Draco smiled. “It depends. Labour is hard absolutely. But with pregnancy, it depends on your body. I had five children and four pregnancies. It hasn't been all terrible for me; others have certainly had other experiences.” Draco reflected. “Luna struggled to conceive for a long time before she had the twins.”
“Good evening Scorpius. I’ve got your dinner, if you’re hungry?” Harry asked.
"Oh, Merlin, has James not moved into the position he wanted?” Lily groaned, walking down the stairs. She was in her seventh year and was plump with red hair. If Harry was being honest plump was probably underselling it, but he also was completely supportive of his daughter and her body, which was something Draco had been quite insistent on.
“Funny Dad” Scorpius said confused. “Is Albus here?”
“Scorpius don’t gawp. It’s unbecoming” Draco commented. Scorpius mouth shut quickly. “But yes, Harry and I are...” he looked at Harry as he searched to describe what they were.
“Mister Potter” Headmaster Ryan frowned. He was a tall man, Italian with slick black hair. Wearing expensive tailored suits and a waxed moustache.
“Really, you do?”
Harry kissed Draco’s lips and pressed his head against him. “I’m proud of you. You know that.”
“Why you're in control of your lycanthropy, compared to others we’ve encountered.”
“Can I point out, as a Mind-Healer that dealing with this is my area of expertise, among many. And that having support from your family is helpful” Draco commented. “But as your husband. I’ll support you either way.”
"We're human I promise you," Hermione said holding up a silver crucifix. "Trust me. What's going on?"
Draco doted on every whim of Harry’s to a point. He refused to let Harry off the grounds, and he could only go to the gardens in Draco’s company.
Reverend Trask grinned and reached down, pulling the baby from Harry. “You will be dead before you realise” He gloated. “An innocent babe, already tainted by the sins of its parents.” He held the dagger to the baby.
"Yes, Papa," they groaned.
“No. Draco’s been wonderful, honestly. He’s been too sweet; he doesn’t like me going outside without him. The two times he’s gone through full moons, he transforms and stalks outside until he gets bored and then he’ll cuddle up beside me.”
"Veela-ness?" Draco offered sarcastically.
"At work..." Sirius called back.
“I thought you’d both left honestly” Draco shrugged.
Draco hesitated. But took the beer, "thanks."
"Here Harry got you a drink and no it's not alcoholic" Ron grinned handing him a silver goblet.
“Two boys and two girls,” said Lucinda, smiling gently as one started to cry; she lifted the bundle into her arms and began to rock the infant gently, cradling it.”
“I’m still going on a diet.”
Harry nodded uneasily. Draco pressed his head into Harrys neck and kissed it and mumbled "I'm sorry"
There was another knock on the door. “Let us in Wolf”.
Harry looked a little sheepish, "Well. It's a baby and I never expected it well like this."
“Night Harry, Night Draco” Ron said hugging them both individually, he lingered with his hug to Draco. “Thank you I’m glad you’ve been there for Harry. We should have been.”
Harry nodded. "I will."
“I’ll let you have a taste with the small one. See if it meets your lofty standards Malfoy.”
Ron Weasley ran along the gravel path between the hedges, The Squares of lawn with their overgrown flowers and bushes and crumbling stone statues. There was a high fence that bordered the property, even then the view of the mountains and the trees could be seen above it. He stopped as he got to the main driveway, catching his breath. Sweat dripping down his forehead.
“Don’t Mum me. You remember that woman who used to teach you in primary school Mrs... too many constants in her name and not enough vowels. She was from there and had more of a beard that your father could ever grow.”
"Oh fine. Fine. I'm not being nice to Draco. Even if he is Harry's baby Daddy." Ron insisted as they walked down the corridor.
“I want to do my job. And go home. That’s it. I don’t need you Harry. I don’t want your friendship” Draco said firmly.
Draco just sat back in the chair defeated. "I should be there. I got him pregnant, I didn't mean too" Draco sobbed breaking down. "I wasn't ready..."
The Road made a winding turn and Harry began to see a clear road. It looked old; a worn cobblestone road ran through it covered with a light layer of snow all of it illuminated by moonlight. The buildings were made of stone, with wooden second floors that loomed over the footpath, sturdy wooden beams of exposed timber holding them up. The windows all looked shut, and there was no flicker of light from the cracks in the doors. Ron hopped off the cart and ran a finger over a barrel.
Draco carried in a tray and smiled at Harry who sitting in bed pillows propped up behind him. "I can tell your having a Malfoy as there's no way you'd be having cravings for Quail otherwise."
“Briefly but it will fade away like a dream” Snape nodded. “If you stay here. You will die, time runs faster here. In a year you will have lived a lifetime...”
“After Ronald McDonald, obviously.”
Harry squinted. “Merlin’s sake. Alright fine. This is war.”
"No," Elaine said.
“Well, I’m hardly young, and I'm having quadruplets. So, dying from this is a real possibility,” Draco admitted the nerves in his voice clear. There was a sigh from Harry in the kitchen.
A baby.
“You and Malfoy are both Wizards. There was an accident. And” Snape began.
“We do. I want to wait until they’re in our arms. See what suits it...”
"Stay" Harry warned. "Please."
“James has a bet going one will be called Rubeus,” Lily commented.
“Yeah. Draco’s been hormonal and everything is a bit stressful. Especially with everyone home for the summer", Harry trailed off. "Anyway, I'm going to need parental leave. And then all my long service leave and annual leave...”
“The Werewolf?” Hermione said quietly.
“Regulus?” Harry asked, thinking.
On Wednesday evening Harry was shaving and staring at himself in the mirror. He noticed he wasn't getting as much stubble as he usually got. Draco suggested it could be a hormone thing, there were a lot of hormone things. The fact his chest hair had fallen out and his nipples were sore and puffy.
“Oh yes, I’m so pleased you can sympathise” Ron muttered. “But focusing on our imminent deaths. We didn’t even get a trial?”
"Devon really? And your fine" Draco dismissed without even looking at him.
Harry jabbed Draco's was ribs, "No it's bloody not."
“I said do you believe in Magic?” She asked squinting at him.
Hermione stared at him. “At the toilets? With whom?” She hissed.
"Are there any good ones or should I be worried?" Harry asked, kissing Draco's forehead.
“Harry, Your?” Hermione gasped.
“Look Harry, I just think maybe given Malfoy has never been the most emotionally available, maybe he was trying to make it easy.”
Draco smiled appreciatively. "While I appreciate the thought. Sirius is right, I do need to get a job."
Sirius prepared tea for everyone else, all the while. Draco, Narcissa and Mrs Malone were upstairs. Harry was leaning against pillows, in nothing but a baggy sweat drenched t-shirt. Draco was sitting next to him, still in his Pyjamas holding Harrys hand tightly.
"Draco! Your mothers here!" Sirius bellowed.
Draco sighed and sat down on a bar stool. “Busy. Otherwise the usual” Draco said simply, he didn’t like talking about his work. Simply because he needed barriers between work and his home life. And Harry already straddled both as it was.
“I knew it” Hermione nodded. “The aversion to fire, the wooden crucifix and the pale skin”
“What? Like wicked witches and fairy godmothers and all that bullshit. I’m not a kid” Draco said laughing.
"Oh, how come Red head and Smarty-pants haven't visited lately?" Sirius asked sitting down in a chair.
"For a mooch he's quite sensible." Sirius said pointing at Draco.
Draco smirked smiling for a moment before his world set back in. He nodded and looked at the trunks and charmed them and they disappeared with a pop.
Mrs Malone smiled. "I'm going to cast a quick diagnosis charm, just make sure the baby is growing healthily." She produced her wand, 12-inch oak wand polished with a slight curve. She waved it over Harry's stomach, a brief pale blue light emitting from the end. Almost like a ghost, a wavy image appeared above his stomach. Harry squinted in confusion.
"He loves you," Hermione said.
“No, she banned that. Your middle name was going to be Hermione, but she said no.”
"I agree. Sit drink your tea." Sirius encouraged.
"Can I help you?" Sirius said curiously. Noticing the leather bag on the ground next to her feet.
“Four?” Albus asked. “Seriously?”
“Your Mum and Dad are alive?” Ron said a little loudly.
"Urg. Gross" Ron commented as he sat down on a chair that had dirty clothes draped across it. "Mum, is already starting on knitting baby clothes. She's annoyed she only just found out."
Sirius sighed and stepped back. "Fine. But no one knows about you being pregnant. So, can you at least fire call him."
“Just school” Draco shrugged dumping his bag in his room. It was basic, a spice girls’ poster on the wall that he’d gotten from a magazine, a nirvana poster on the other wall from their fourth Album. Draco kind of thought Kurt Cobain was hot until he started looking fat recently.
"Your father is conveniently away on business, I thought I'd take the opportunity to come see you" Narcissa said honestly. "But I am Sorry, I do wish Lucius hadn't been so stubborn."
Draco felt his stomach churn. A bit of hope starting to appear.
Harry punched his shoulder.
“Excuse you?” Draco snapped eyes flaring, brushing Harry’s hands away. “It is the Quadruplets. Absolutely. I am not fat.”
Draco pressed Ron’s face against the tile with his other paw as he loomed down. Bearing his snarling teeth as he bit into Ron.
“Burn them!” Reverend Trask insisted as he stepped back as a flaming torch moved by him.
Sirius winced a little. "Harry. You should be in..."
"They do now" Draco replied uncertain. An answer that wasn't particularly helping Harrys nerves. They walked into the dining room, it like most of the manor had high wood labelled walls and a large white stone fireplace. A metal chandelier that looked at least a hundred years old, hung above the dining table.
"Well. It's a new job. I haven't been there for six months. Harry and I are trying to work around that. We'll figure it out, honestly it's fine" Draco said insisting. Mostly hoping he didn't get fired over this.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Draco glowered, narrowing his eyes at Ron.
"Malfoy you could have just not," Ron said covering his head with one arm as he became increasingly drenched. His other hand scratching at his neck.
“Do you want a foot rub?” Draco asked as he approached wiping his hands clean.
“Harry?” Hermione asked amusement tingeing her voice.
Harry felt sick to his stomach and Draco looked just as uncomfortable. “Why did I attack you?” He said looking at Draco, realising the dream, he’d had, wasn’t a dream.
“It’s not bad.”
“We don’t know it’s Draco.”
Draco scoffed, “A muggle? Oh sure. It’s not real none of this real it’s a simulation” He said rolling his eyes.
“His Dads In prison probably for life though” Ron commented.
There was a firm knocking on the door. Sirius raised an eyebrow curiously, they never really had visitors who used the front door. Anyone close floo'ed.
"What a handsome pureblood..." Sirius said with a smirk.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Not quite,” he admitted. “Did they not teach you at school? Actually, never mind, I certainly didn’t learn it, though the processes have similarities. It was the simplest way to explain it to your father. In reality, if they did that, my organs would be everywhere and you'd be down a parent."
“I’d do it, but I can’t reach my wand” Ron muttered.
"Merlin. It's gross how much you love each other" Ron commented.
“Not happening,” Draco waved it off. “If you're that fussy, you two could move up here and decorate it.”
Harry sighed wearily. “We’re not moving into the manor. Merlin knows what curses and ghosts haunt that place.”
“You and Draco raised five children together. I'm sure you'll manage another four," Hermione reassured.
Kingsley waved a hand dismissively. "Don't be silly."
“Do you ‘ave a couple of quid” a bedraggled man with ratty hair and blotchy stubble covered skin.
“Is it? Sorry. I just saw no one was sitting next to you” She said honestly.
Draco took a seat and leant forward. "Why should I let you be part of my child's life? Because frankly I'm withholding every urge to kick you out right now."
"Draco" Hermione said smiling in the doorway. Draco stared up at Hermione and the bundle in her arms. "Would you look like to meet your son?" Draco tried to control his emotions. And he stood up hands shaking. "I'll bring him over" she smiled.
"Yeah" Draco sighed. Placing in the tray on Harrys lap. "Don't remind me." Draco smirked. As he sat down on the other side of the bed.
"I've been ignoring them." Harry shifted. "Considering, I'm Pregnant from a Veela who happens to be Draco Malloy and I quit the job I've been obsessed with since I'd been in fourth year."
“Absolutely,” Harry grinned, not wanting to force the argument to go on any further. “Biscuits and cream?” Harry asked.
Draco smiled wryly. “That sounds utterly wonderful. Help me up? My legs are still a little numb.”
“We could just do it,” Albus pointed out. “We don’t need your approval.”
“Are you going to be like this for the next six months?” Harry groaned almost laughing.
"Fine, then our previously moochers then," Draco sighed, finally relenting, his shoulders dropping. "We can't do this again."
“Yes, the Beast. Or Draco who murdered two people” Ron mumbled.
“The Beast will come tonight” The older man pulled out a silver dagger. “My Grandfather forged this blade. I will slay him If he takes my daughter.”
“Alright, so, your father and I have talked. And I think that it's about time we moved into the Manor. James will inherit it all of course. But frankly, the place is big enough for all of you to raise children in.”
Harry nodded sheepishly, Draco smiled and planted an affectionate kiss on his lips. "Let's go to this midwife, you know where we're flooing too yes?"
Draco placed his arm around Harry and kissed his cheek. “Bedtime, I prescribe an early night” Draco suggested warmly.
"I meant here, now. Why" Draco said frustrating, he was in an open shirt it had frills along the collar and his pants were fitted to his waist. His blonde hair was pulled back and he had grown a beard in the time since Harry had seen him last.
Draco ignored him and headed into the tower. As usual the foyer smelt of urine, the lift wasn’t working did it ever. Which required him to walk the four flights of stairs. He opened the door to the small two-bedroom apartment he shared with his mum. “Mother are you home?” Draco called out.
Draco looked unsure. "I don't know"
"I needed you..."
“Interesting” Hemione wondered.
“Unfortunately,” Draco sighed.
"That's a terrifying thought" Harry grinned.
“Right. I want you all to read to the end of the act. I’m getting sick of forcing you to read through it in class” Mr Hubbard grumbled.
“I was thinking of seeing my cousin” Harry offered up un-enthusiastically.
“You are one in a million, sweetheart, but, yes, it’s a little unlikely.”
“Sure” Draco said waving his wand as four glasses poured themselves.
"Well. I think that your family's obsession with blood purity has a different origin. From what I can gather, your family has a strong history with Lycanthropy usually two or three a generation. At some point, you started to ‘Breed it out’ presumably as Wizarding society changed. It is built into this house, the architraves, the bedrooms with the silver door fittings. All of it is designed for a family home with Werewolves” Hermione grinned.
Harry winced. “Will we remember this? When we go back?” He asked.
“Absolutely,” Draco smiled.
“Water,” Albus cut in carrying a trio of glasses. “I have dropped at least half of one on the stairs, so careful going down,” Albus commented.
“Muggles? What will they do” The man laughed. Draco and Harry shared a concerned look.
Harry relented and sat down, Hermione and Ron drew up chairs nearby. All watching as Draco swept out of the room.
“You are obviously the first ones to know. Don’t start spreading it please,” ordered Harry.
“Great...” Draco muttered, bracing for the inevitable punches.
"They won't" Draco said sighing pulling away, "I've been cast adrift..." he said waving a wand and his clothes and belongings began to fly out the cupboards and neatly into the trunks.
“Oh!" said Harry, his eyes widening in realisation. “You're...? But we’re...”
“Now. Go change, we’re going out to dinner” His mother insisted cupping Harrys face affectionately. Harry pulled away face red and glad no one was there to see it.
“They aren’t. I don’t have favourites," Draco insisted. Harry rolled his eyes but jugged Draco reassuringly.
"We'll find him and bring him home, but we should be wary there are lots of reasons for Draco to isolate himself" Hermione said rubbing Harry's shoulder. "Mating season perhaps?"
“Because he doesn’t need to look even more like a nerd” Otto commented, Harry elbowed him in the ribs.
“Draco. I got you pregnant, it’s my child in there” Harry insisted.
Then they heard a loud howl, that echoed through the dark snowy night. Harry felt the hair on the back of his neck straightened.
“More than one,” Draco muttered.
“My Congregation. I Reverend Trask will guide you in purging this evil from our land” Reverend Trask declared waving the Crucifix around. “Fire will cleanse their corrupted bodies and punish them for their misdeeds.”
“Aw is the little mudblood about to confess. How cute.” Holy. Shit. Draco flinched. Did he just say that thought Draco. How on earth did that even slip out? Why did he say that? He knew that it was the wrong this to say even before she reacted.
“Same. Before I got on the train Mama told me that it was happening. This summer she’s making me take it,” a voice to his right murmured. Being pulled from his thoughts Draco turned towards her and almost choked at what he saw. She looked absolutely terrified. That much was obvious. Looking at seemingly nothing it seemed as if she was talking to herself. She gripped the polish brush as if it was her lifeline, knuckles white with tension. Her nails were a lurid red, glaring in the candlelight and looked as if they were painted on by a toddler. Her hands looked mangled and bloody. As is she just recently ripped someone's heart from their unforgiving chest.
“Yes Granger?” Draco replied in the softest tone that he could possibly perform. He didn’t want to seem threatening and he was tired, it was late, and he was curious on what she had to say.
“No, I’m not Blaise,” Draco replied as he took one of Blaise’s pawns. Then scowled when he realized he had then left himself open. “You saw Granger and the Weasel, they were more than just a little worried. Or, at least Granger was. Weasley probably is ecstatic. Next Hogsmeade weekend you can bet your galleons that he is going to be swarmed by the press asking questions. Tch. Congratulations Weasley, you’re finally going to get what you want.. Shit”
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Draco leaned forward and pried the blood red color from her hands just as Blaise began to rub circles into her back. Draco then pulled her onto his lap and began petting her hair. He heard her begin sniffling. He hugged her tighter as he held her for hours until she calmed down and the crying subsided. All while he had a glint in his eye. This would be over, he thought. This would soon be all over.
Draco just stood there, again at loss for words. He knew whatever he said would be dissected and analyzed by the young woman in front of him. Whenever Granger wanted to know something, she found out. She doesn’t just kick her feet up and let the answers be handed to her. She’s a trooper, she goes out there. And that was one of the things he secretly respected about her. True, she didn’t know his full story, not even close. But he could see the determination in her eyes. And he could see that she wanted something. “Okay what do you want,” he relented, letting his guard down.

Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter or any of the characters.
No. Draco wanted to say. He father wasn’t pushing him at all. In fact it was a bit strange how unforward his father was as of late. In fact he hardly talked of the Dark Lord anymore. During the summer he got called on frequently. Leaving during noon and always back before dinner. Always. His father for some reason always treasured supper. Everyone must be present. Everyone including him. Draco didn’t know how he pulled it off but he never missed one. And those quiet suppers were the moments he treasured. Because everything else was about work, school, the light and the dark. Supper was normal. Supper was an escape. And he loved it.
And it was always during this time when she was at her worst. Right after summer lets out she always came back more rattled then the previous year. He loved Pansy, he really did. Platonically, of course. In the middle of fourth year he had found her in one of the broom closets in the middle of a panic attack. Since then he has taken her under his wing and with Blaise the three of them have been inseparable since. They all knew each other's secrets. All equally as dark. And that’s what made them so close to each other.
Remember to tell me what you think. Thankssss
Hermione still not taking the hint kept talking. “I’ve noticed. The past few years you have backed off. I mean still the usual threats but less. Almost as if you didn’t want to be a git.. As if you actually didn’t want to hurt Harry,” she said, voice softening as she spoke.
Draco didn’t protest and nodded, “Of course love.”
“That’s an image that’s burned in my brain” Ron said grimacing. As Harry pulled away, Professor Snape pulled out a black sphere and waved his stick over it. Harry and Draco felt themselves pulled towards it, and the moment they touched it. It ripples and exploded into a cloud of thick black smoke and it engulfed them.
“Four beautiful children?” Hermione suggested as she sat on the bed.
“I’m not having you or any of your siblings moving out due to the babies. We have more than enough room,” Draco insisted.
“You have a sweet tooth. A big one,” Ginny pointed out.
The ear-splitting yell rang around the walls and corridors of The Potter home.
"Right. Should I be expecting your husband? If that's the case, I'll make sure to burn the breakfast" Sirius commented.
“Weasley don’t you have a wife?” Draco mused as he walked over to the bar. “My usual Potter, double shot of vodka in it”
“What? Are you sure they weren't saying concussed because a heavy wooden table was thrown at them?” Draco ventured.
"Oh?"
"Perhaps God is showing mercy," Reverend Trask said.
Harry frowned. “That’s the second time you’ve said that. What happened to my parents?”
“So far: Arthur, Neville Ronald, and Andromeda Narcissa.”
“Sure, yeah. What station is near you?” Draco said making a note on a post it.
“Of course, he is” Draco nodded condescendingly as he met Trask's eye. "Off you go now. You're welcome to visit the manor, you would love my garden it grows such rich garlic” Draco said as he walked over and cut Hermione and Ron’s ropes and helped them down off the smouldering pyre.
"Rosemurn?"
“I just wondered. Six pregnancies are a lot and I just wondered how much you wanted it. I suppose” Scorpius said, trying to explain himself.
Harry scoffed and rolled his eyes as he made his way to the floo. "See you later Uncle Sirius!" Harry called out loudly.
“You two are my boys. I want you both at home until you're married. With Hogwarts, you spend nine months of the year off at school. And you came back older and different. I missed a lot,” Draco admitted.
Harry shrugged, "Yeah well I need a hobby."
“Some water? Or is that Ash you're coughing up” Draco commented smirking at Ron. “I would advise this isn't the weather for it Reverend. I do believe it's going to rain” Draco said as he put up an umbrella. Then with magical timing, a heavy downpour began. "See" Draco smiled.
Harry groaned; he’d spent most of their marriage actively trying to avoid moving into Malfoy Manor, certain it was a terrible idea. “Anyway, we’ll figure it out,” Harry admitted honestly.
Draco stared at it, and muttered ‘snob’ under his breath. But nevertheless, added his number, before handing it back to Harry.
“Right. Sorry. Shit Sorry. We should meet. Maybe come stay? My parents are away?”
Harry groaned, as he lay on the bathroom floor. He felt his face, a scar on his forehead where it was meant to be. Glasses and not contacts, and he reached down and felt his stomach. Thin, “I’m not fat anymore” he sighed with relief.
"You mean if Harry was too" Draco trailed off with dread.
Draco's hand was around Ron's neck, "What the hell have you done Weasley" He snarled.
“Nothing. Nothing’s wrong with that all” He answered quickly. “How come don’t wear glasses?”
Panicked he ran down the street, there was a pub on the corner, as Harry saunted around the corner, casually. “Woah. Draco. Hey. Relax.” Harry said grabbing his wrists.
“Sir, tell me where he is,” Draco, a junior Auror of one year, demanded from Robards. He had kept his mouth shut the first week, then the second week, even the first month went by without Draco saying anything. But they had been gone far too long for everything to be going right, and Draco was worried, panicked even.
“Sorry, Sir. He said, ‘somebody else should take the initiative for once’”. Harry’s mouth gaped open as he comprehended that Draco was still pissed off at him. He turned slowly to go, still half expecting Draco to show himself, but Kirk cleared his throat before he could step towards the door.
“Am I not allowed to read your book?” Harry enquired, lifting his head to study Draco’s face, both of them quirking an eyebrow.
“That thing scared the living daylights out of me,” Draco muttered into Harry’s chest.
“He’s after his sixth.”
“Another,” he slurred loudly. “Another glass, Hannah.”
“Get lost, Potter,” he muttered without looking towards the saviour-turned-auror.
. Draco’s behaviour over the last 24 hours or so was proof enough of that. The problem was, he had no idea what it was that he had supposedly done to piss his boyfriend off.
He fell into the drink, the pounding, throbbing music of the clubs.
When he got home from work, later than he should have, Draco had already left another note in the kitchen but was nowhere to be found.
“Yes,” he began stroking his thumbs over Draco knuckles. “I meant it like that. I wouldn’t mind being yours either.”
“It’s alright, Harry. We’re fine, aren’t we Draco?” She said his name pointedly, but he ignored the question.
grinning wildly as a form took shape in front of him. Four thick, powerful legs. Paws the size of dinner plates, sleek fur shining, fur that he knew would be jet black if he could see it. A lonesome creature, powerful and unique. Different enough to Draco’s tiger to be his own, to be
for children?”
When he heard Draco start moving around on the other side of the bathroom door again, Harry knelt on the bed so that the first thing Draco laid eyes on when he opened the door was him, naked and apologetic, palms placed facing upwards on his thighs, green eyes pleading and sorrowful as they met silver.
He snorted at that, which made him cough and splutter. “Merlin, Abbott. Say what you mean why don’t you.”
“And did you?” he swallowed before continuing, nervous for the answer. “Did you mean it like that?”
“I ca... the eye... I...” Draco stumbled, only to rise into accusation. “I thought you of all people would be happy it was over!”
The former looked flushed and somewhat guilty, the clothing not quite in perfect order, a dark purplish mark decorating his clavicle.
Impatiently Severus interrupted. “You are stalling, Draco. Get to the point this instant.”
A small nod, then Draco's eyes burned with hidden passion, looking at everything he hated and despised, everything he now would not get to be, thank Merlin.
Albus shook his head discontently. “We cannot do that, Severus. The boy needs his peers. If he went dark...”
Draco straightened his posture, shook his head in defiance. “I just...” He threw Severus a weary look, but continued: “I just found you. I want to find out how it will be. I want...”
So he went back to his rooms to check the things he had left so abruptly and arrange his classes for the next days, then stopped by in the storage room to get Potter's things.
What can he do but comply? What would he want to do?
Now Potter's nod was quick, his hand squeezing Draco's in an attempt to give comfort Severus' godson did not need, because he did not understand yet. “I won't. One time was more than enough. What then? Basilisk poison?”
Severus shook his head, giving a sideways look towards Potter she could not misunderstand. “Nothing new but...” He raised one eyebrow in worry. “He's been in pain and there is something. In his eye.” It took a lot more of his restraint than usual to remain impassive.
When Draco slowly glides down, willing to have a first taste of Potter's very delicious cock, Theo keeping him distracted, until it actually happens, things finally come together. Potter screams out, clenches his fists into the sheets, fully lost, his face so close to pain, as pleasure can ever be, fighting to hold back, so he won't come just now.
Potter rubbed the wrist of his undamaged hand against his cheek and mused cryptically, glancing into the distance: “Reconciliation. Memories. A violent end.” He tried to move on but Severus held him back.
“Silence” he interrupted her, and though he spoke softly, it shut her up. “You have a decision to make, dear Petunia.” He neared but did not touch her. “I can kill your son like he probably deserves. The
He stepped back, pretending he had never been there, never heard anything, and went to his rooms, musing over everything he knew of Voldemort. About his first downfall and the way he came back. Long ago a friend, now long lost and dead sadly, had told him: “Beware of the Dark Lord's thirst for immortality. It consumes everything he touches. It may well consume us.” And it had. Regulus was dead, buried in an unknown grave, the casket in his own empty, and Severus... scarred inside and out, clearly unfit to ever again live a normal life.
Severus gave a small snort despite himself. Some things never changed.
“Shall we begin?” he asked, not sure, if he tried to relief or enhance the tension.
Poppy tried to safe the day, getting all busy and professional. In the most nonchalant voice at her disposal she asked Severus to bring her a number of potions from the closet, then pulled out her wand, uttering the first spells under her breath. It was a lengthy process because she did not really know what she was looking for.
Harry nods, knowing he shouldn't and not caring at all. “Yes...”
Draco understood, in probably all the wrong ways, which Severus had deliberately left open to interpretation. “And... what do you intend to do now?” His lips twitched, unsure if a smile or a sneer was in order.
Severus raised a brow. “What was it about?” This was safe territory and helped him to cool down some.
“Talk to you” Severus said although he had not intended to. “Our last conversation remained somewhat stunted.”
The guilt he had almost immediately felt on estranging Potter from his friends again died a fast merciless death on that. The boy was better off in the safe haven he provided than in the questionable care of his classmates.
Severus frowned, both at Draco's insufficient observation skill and the facts at hand. “The headmaster decided the storage room next to it is.”
Unfortunately no further hints showed up. Every specific test Poppy came up with came back negative. No directly physical influence, no mind magic, no cursed object. Even the kind of magic used remained inconclusive.
Severus followed, hurrying not to lose sight. It was not that hard, when the boy still went out of breath so easily. Up the stairs he had to pause, wheezing, breathlessly apologizing, he was not yet on his way again.
Draco laughs, quite obviously relieved. “It's not a chore, you do. It's supposed to be fun...” He can't help but capture Potter's mouth once more. Theo has to admit, it is tempting and joins enthusiastically, taking turns with both their lips and mouths and just watching the show. Soon, Potter has forgotten his initial fears and embarrassments and fits easily between them, a feast for their eyes and hands and, in all honesty ears, as he can beg and swear so sweetly.
Albus was not as oblivious as others would have been and made a questioning noise. “Why, Severus, is there something you would tell me?” There wasn't. And he realized there never again would be either. Albus had lost his grip on him. He had slipped from his fingers with the same ease (and disgust) as from the Dark Lord's. He was on his own now, with just Potter and Draco as his willing pawns, yet had not felt so alive in ages.
“Yours...” It was a squeak, boyish, pained. A sign that below his cold composure and his returning health the boy was still breaking down bit by bit.
Potter, and it always comes back to him, is friends with the house-elves, the rumors say. Theo wouldn't be surprised anymore, if it was true. He on the other hand is used to being obeyed. He does not threaten or disturb those busy workers, just states his needs, clarifying place and time, then leaves again. He can't wait to get back to their playroom, have a little sleep himself, maybe even have a cuddle with Potter too, he seems the type to make it worthwhile.
Potter closed his eyes and nodded. “Potion now?”
Severus stared. It was a devastating breakdown, a pitiable sight. And yet, lying bare in front of a man he perceived as enemy may bleed out all the poison of his wounds, may help him start to heal.
He knew it was cruel. Knew nothing could sabotage Potter's recovery more effective. Knew it was nigh impossible to comply. He still said it, the unreasonable urge to safe Draco too strong, although his godson would not appreciate the saving.
Firmly he declined. “Better not. We have enough problems as it is. Fortunately it wasn't Malfoy who was hit. Otherwise we would have his father already sit here with Albus, whetting his knife for Potter.”
Potter snorted. “Who, please? I have seen no one, nobody has seen me...”
to do. At all. The only reason, he did not intercept, did not stop his mate right there, was the fact, that Potter fell into it, so easily, so softly that dragging him out again, would have done more harm than good. Granted, it was a sight to behold too, arousing and tempting and impossibly good.
He then all but fled the room. He had not wanted it to end like this. Two oaths broken in all but the letter. He could not keep Potter safe any longer, could barely do it for Draco either, knowing at least his heart would be broken. And he... forced to live in a world that contained no more joy but the satisfaction of revenge fulfilled.
He wouldn't come back, unless someone made him, so Severus nodded slightly. “See you tomorrow.” He made sure to sound like he would not be refused. For the moment it only sped up Draco's departure, but he would abide by his godfather's wishes nonetheless.
Unsurprisingly it was Malfoy Manor, where the Dark Lord had taken quarter over the summer. Unsurprisingly, too, he was not in the best mood, or maybe he was, for it never seemed to get any better than that. One way or the other, it was going to be a wholly unpleasant evening, an impression he clearly shared with even the most fearsome attendees, Fenrir Greyback and Bellatrix Lestrange, though they weren't prone to show it. Rabastan Lestrange and most of all Pettigrew, this pathetic excuse for a human being, placed themselves in the background immediately to stay on the safe side. Severus chose the middle ground for himself, knowing that at times, Voldemort's greatest pleasure seemed to be to drag those out of the shadows, who thought they were hidden best. Since his rebirth and bodily reincarnation as part snake, it got even worse and Severus wasn't fond of being on the receiving end of the Dark Lord's curses.
Draco reached for the knots, wanting to do it by hand, just to extend the contact. “Perhaps... we could do that again?”
“And release me, when I ask for it” Potter confirmed. He seemed torn between his usual boldness and something else, something so foreign to their interaction that Draco could not place it. The tension in the air felt like a living thing.
Potter raises his hand to his eyes, rubbing over the bridge of his nose and huffs, slightly irritated. “I almost hoped, I just dreamed all of that.” The tiny, self-mocking smile and well-shagged appearance contradict the harsh statement easily, as does the fond tone of his voice.
Potter nodded without a word and went, quickly passing the main room of the infirmary to escape Weasley's bitter accusations.
The next wands, simple or ornate, strong or delicate, dark or light, fared no better, though Potter managed to keep hold of them, until he could hand them back. Neither wand seemed willing, and Potter's exhaustion was obvious. It was time to end this farce, though Severus feared, the absence of a wand would weaken the boy further. But just when he wanted to intervene, Draco appeared, making use of the password to his quarters. He studied the scenery for a moment, then the contents of Olivander's suitcase with unabashed interest.
Lucius had never been light on his son, but even Draco had no answer to that. “I got to go” he announced detachedly and fled the room, relieved to see his godfather waiting for him. “Good night, Severus.”
He looked at her in unpleasant surprise. She had never been the motherly type, her sympathy, although firmly at “her” Gryffindor's side, never encompassed more than vague encouragement and some leniency towards their escapades. But this lack of consideration was still disappointing.
Malfoy kisses his nape, softly strokes his arms. “So proud of you. You can do this... and it's nothing, a little spell can't heal, afterwards.”
“Does Albus know?”
“So...” Draco at last started, acknowledging how Potter's gaze dipped , just a little. “What did you expect, then? For me, to tie you up and have a little fun with you?”
Theo smirks. A little distraction might smooth things over, right there. His own hands slip down too, slowly passing over the stomach, dipping in the navel, just for a second... he brings them back up, licks them, makes them nice and wet, until slipping them down again, the trails of saliva making the descent slippery. Capturing Potter's gaze he licks his lips, bows down and breathes over the moist skin, until it starts showing goosebumps.
Then he carefully opened his occlumency shields. And pushed. The memory of how he found Potter, half dead. How the boy had suffered, screamed, flinched, whispered. All the little details of his recovery, he did not even know he remembered.
Draco finally looked up with a scowl. “I screwed up, Severus.”
Potter did not listen any more than Severus did, and eyed the wand, as if it would bite him, once he touched it.
Severus shook his head slowly. “Do you see me laughing?”
Minerva shrugged, obviously relieved not to take responsibility for the catastrophe bound to happen, Poppy seethed in silence, and he... started to plot. He had three days to arrange for an incident, rendering all these considerations useless in favor of a more sensible path.
Severus was not the most compassionate of persons, but no being deserved such a fate, if it was so easily avoidable. Shrugging, he stepped closer readying to open the door and let the poor creature escape. The motion, though, made his senses tingle alarmingly. He could not quite place the feeling, but knew, something was amiss. Maybe it was the smell, weak but revolting, so unfitting the almost clinically clean house. Or the strange, muffled sound from inside the small confinement, a sound he could not associate with any pet, he knew off.
“Potter was hurt on his way here, and in consideration of the circumstances of said incident, Dumbledore ruled the Infirmary unsafe for wizardingkind's great savior.” Severus made no attempt to conceal his blatant sarcasm. “He entrusted his care to a man he still deems trustworthy it seems.” There was no further indication necessary to imply, how fragile such trust could prove.
And Severus not been on the receiving end of this quite enough to know how it felt? How destructive it could be? Revisiting, what he knew of the past years he understood more and more, so had Potter.
One would see Potter fall victim to this ideology soon, as Albus cut off the discussion with an impatient: “I will hear no more of this. If Harry is back to health, we have no right to separate him from his friends or jeopardize his education. I expect him back in class by Monday.”
Severus shook his head in dismissal. “And what is the obvious?”
It was hours later, when he first returned to the Infirmary, both to check on the boy and hand over his first successes. Poppy wasn't present, but Minerva sat beside the bed, tight and stiff as a stick. When she saw him, she nodded, not bothering to hide the harsh lines of concern in her face.
“Who are you trying to fool here?” Potter. Sad but controlled. “He hates me. He hated my father, he hated my godfather, he sure as hell hates me. If he has seen us... if he even suspects... there is no way he'll let me see you.”
His hands roaming over Theo's than Draco's body, his lips, hungry and willing, and the wonder in his eyes... He is by far the best they had for a long, long time.
Theo looks him up and down thinking. “I check the grounds, you do the floo. You have a better connection to Snape, just in case.” And it is safer to run outside, anyways, in case any teachers are still around. Draco can rely on his father to be kept out of trouble. He... can't.
Severus heard the door open behind him, but did not let himself get distracted, administering the second and third potion in quick succession, assuming it was Poppy, here to do her own checkup. It wasn't, he saw, when he turned to get the prepared mug of water for Potter. It was Draco, standing at the entrance and staring in disbelief. Unwavering Severus finished his task, before facing his godson in calm determination.
The other boy fought for air, exposing his throat in the process, an offer, Draco gladly accepted, sucking deep red marks into the skin, while Potter's hips buckled, meeting his own in delicious friction.
Severus smirked as he obliviated the boy thoroughly. Someone would surely find him and take care of his needs. And in time he even may grow a personality worth mentioning.
So in short the problem was not to cause an issue but to scale it correctly. Too little might not sway the headmaster, too much would cause additional damage and throw Potter back by days, even weeks, right back to the start.
Severus gathered his courage and dropped a potion knife from his pocket as if it had slipped out when he fought with a recalcitrant door handle. The sound was none too loud, but the shuffling noises from within told him he had been heard. Huffing he entered, throwing an accusative look first at Potter, then at Draco.
And savor they do... cuddling together, as if there was no tomorrow, Potter between them, half lying on Draco, the expanse of his lean muscular back perfect for Theo. to snuggle against. Perfect to sleep in warm blanket of well-being, of unfiltered human contact, so rare for pure-blood kids like them. A few hours of not thinking, not hating, not plotting. A few hours of peaceful sleep.
The hissing grew louder, the seizures even more distinct, as the beast with its last remaining strength lunged at the present death eaters present. It crashed against Bellatrix who could just barely get away, then wound around Goyle, squeezing the very life out of him in its final act. As it fell to the ground, dissolving into rancid goo, the enormous body of the late death eater went with it.
