??!!" Hermione gasped in shock, mimicking Ron's exact reaction as she stepped out of the fireplace and onto the plush carpet—jaw hanging slack and eyes bulged at the sight in front of her.
“Haha, humble as ever, eh Potter?” The older wizard grinned and gave a final, brief look around before gesturing Harry to follow.
Kingsley sighed and nodded his head in agreement, gently patting Harry on his non-afflicted shoulder. "How much longer then should it take until the rest of the wound closes like that?"
Blaise nodded his head vehemently. “Yeah, mate! You can’t just get to the good part of the story and then stop! What happened next? Since you failed at saving your damsel in distress, did someone else come to your aid? Or were you all alone and abandoned in the woods for days—fighting off the wolves?!” he guessed dramatically, waving his arms around in the air excitedly.
..I think Florence came up with that one...Of course I think he took it off the contract before they actually swore on it, haha!”
“Alright then—hurry back!” Blaise sing-songed over his shoulder—just catching sight of the boxer-clad blonde making his way up the staircase with perhaps a bit more force in his steps than necessary.
The redhead gave her an astounded look, but complied with a huff when she turned her own pleading look on him.
. After the war was over, there were months and months of time where people were trying to clean up the damages left behind in the aftermath of the war. Even after the physical world was fixed though, many were still broken in spirit and heart.” He paused, frowning deeply.
Harry suppressed a chuckle and patted to the spot next to him. “Sit down and just try to relax, love. You’re gonna wear a hole in the floor with all of your pacing..”
Harry, thankfully suspecting that his lover was about to do something stupid and embarrassing, was able to tamp down the better part of his reaction—but he still couldn’t fight the slight blush rising to his cheeks. It was nothing though, compared to the full-on rush of blood that went straight to Ron’s face—coloring it a vivid a red.
Kingsley muttered a string of curses under his breath that had Florence gaping slightly. “What about Draco? How long have they been in here for?”
“Owww.” Draco meanwhile complained with a scowl, rubbing his shin discreetly as Hermione continued to ramble on about some theory or another that she had. “You didn’t have to kick me that hard!”
Davies snapped. "Nurse, please bring me all of the surgery notes for both Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy, as well as the results of the dark magic screening that we did on both of them.
“—And here we are—satisfied now Parkinson?” Draco drawled as he promptly returned to the table—a tall black haired boy and slender raven haired girl in tow.
Harry stared cooly back at the snatcher, wand raised and standing his ground. “Step away from the Hippogriff. Under article 13, section 6 of the bylaws set forth by the Ministry of Magic, Hippogriffs are declared as an endangered species. As such they are—,”
Kingsley sighed again and plucked the quill out of the air—turning his attention to the contract. “It seems like I’ll have to lay the foundation work down...”
“Because of Voldemort and the Death Eaters, many in the Wizarding World had to mourn the loss of their friends and loved ones- and that was something that no amount of magic could ever fix. When the aftermath was dealt with, and people started to finally move on, we soon realized that we were facing a new problem. Wizards everywhere had started being bigoted towards Purebloods. Not allowing them to find jobs, visit certain shops, or even eat in many restaurants.”
“Turn it around?” Harry furrowed his brows in thought before twisting his wand—prompting the blonde to do the same.
The two seemed completely incapable of uttering a single word, so Draco allowed himself to continue—walking around the couch to lean against the chair that Harry was occupying.
Once again, Harry ignored the question, and made for the staircase—thinking to change himself into actual clothes (he had forgotten that he'd been in nothing but his boxers this entire time), and then figure out a game plan of how he was going to explain the situation to Ron and Hermione.
Suddenly he felt himself being pushed and beckoned forwards, and he realized that he was supposed to step closer to the podium. Kingsley slowly descended from the stand and stopped between the two boys smiling gently.
“Yeah...same old-same old I s’pose...” The redhead muttered with a shrug, for some reason taking a fascination in the table cloth and not lifting his eyes.
"Alright......I'll...get to it then......" Harry hazarded, dragging his feet out of the kitchen and sinking glumly into the arm chair adjacent to the couch.
Florence bounded forwards and signed the bottom of the parchment with a grin. He handed both quill and parchment back to Kingsley before guiding the boys back down to their place in front of the podium as Kingsley took one final look over the paper in his hands.
enough, and a flick of his wand sent a well aimed throw pillow to effectively shut up the Slytherin with a firm blow to the face.
Draco shook his head again, a strange expression crossing his face. “Not really.....Right after that snatcher hit us, he disapparated....which I did think was strange, but I was too relieved he was gone to think much more of it....” He paused and absentmindedly rubbed his chest near his shoulder as he continued. “Shortly afterwards though, I started getting this horrible pain somewhere in my chest—but I couldn’t figure out where it was coming from since I didn’t have any wounds there. That was the last thing I remember before I must’ve passed out, and then woke up here.....”
“I knew you were always a coward Malfoy, but I had hoped that that was one thing that you really had changed about yourself,” Harry spat venomously, picking up his wand that had fallen carelessly nearby. With that he jumped out of his hiding spot in the bushes, holding his wand up as he prepared to confront the group of snatchers.
“Why didn’t you tell me before?!” Blaise exclaimed excitedly, jumping up off of the couch with renewed vigor.
“A-Alrighty Boss, if you’re sure....” The plump man turned back to the remaining group of snapped his fingers, motioning for them to follow. With a loud ‘
Blaise’s eyes glittered mischievously. “You both seem far too reluctant to share to all of your dear friends this story...Did something seriously so embarrassing happen that you’re this unwilling to tell us~?”
"This," Davies raised the clipboard and shook it a bit. "is some of Mr. Potter's data that we've taken while he was in surgery."
remember most of his dream - all he could remember was the hazy form of Pettigrew, Lucius Malfoy, and a boy with pale blond hair that he would recognize anywhere.
'What, Crouch disowning his house-elf like an elitist prick, or Malfoy behaving like a decent human being for once?' Hermione said, not looking up from the copy of the
It was now that Draco realized that his father had never said at what cost. And, looking at how eager the Dark Lord was to
Granger laughed fondly at him. 'As Ron was trying to say,' she said. 'You might be wondering why we called you here. Well except for...'
'Hello, Blaise,' Draco said smoothly, trying to keep his composure. The next thing he knew, he was being pulled up from the fireplace and facing the first person his age he saw this entire summer. It was depressing, to say the least.
'Well, approaching Potter would be a start,' Blaise's glance was wiry, almost challenging, and for the first time, Harry understood why Ron was attracted to the bloke so much.
'Not really, though,' Ron said hastily, no doubt also seeing the same gleam in her eyes. 'Didn't you hear? Mom doesn't allow us to use magic anyways. She says even the magic needs to rest once in a while so our core could develop.'
'We'll come with you,' Sathya said, scrambling from her place, leaving no room for argument as to who the
Harry guiltily took a peek at the time on their grandfather clock and was shocked to find out that it was already eleven. He, Ron, Hermione, Charlie, and the twins had all stayed up talking until Hermione and Ron had bid them goodnight at around ten, Harry too excited about the upcoming Quidditch match to even think much about sleeping.
Before Harry could think better of it, he said: 'There's a house in London. It's called No. 12, Grimmauld Place, and it's the Black ancestral house. If you ever feel like you need to hide, it'll always be there.'
As they descended down the spiral staircase, Harry couldn't help but notice the curious states they got from a lot of students at
The match had been surprising and unpredictable - and even Draco, who had gone to the Quidditch World Cup finals ever since he was ten, couldn't help but be amazed at the sheer skill and exuberance that Victor Krum and the entirety of the Irish team had exuded.
Draco was taking a walk on the Quidditch grounds when he caught sight of the owl heading his way. With the other schools arriving yesterday, everyone from the fourth year and up had gotten a break on the following day to help the foreign students to 'assimilate better to their environment.'
Draco opened his mouth to make a snide comment about their wealth that the Weasleys entirely deserved, when -
'What exactly are we going to do to the dragons, then?' Harry asked, crossing his arms, filling away thoughts of Sirius for later.
Ron nodded, his freckles standing out sharply against his pale face. 'I just wish we could do better, is all.'
underneath her less than ideal Muggle parentage, who could rival Hermione Granger if they were in the same year - well. That complicated matters.
Neither of them got to talk much further on what had happened since Neville, Dean, and Seamus dropped in on their compartment as they progressed towards the Hogsmead station, though Hermione and Ron were less than pleased if their looks were any indication.
'I need to tell them today, got it,' Harry acquiesced, unaware of Ron and Hermione exchanging a bewildered glance at his easy acceptance; they loved Harry, but he was stubborn as a mule when he wanted to be. However, that glance didn't go unnoticed by Blaise, who simply smiled, something knowing glinting in his eyes as he glanced between Harry and Draco.
'What happened?' Harry said, frowning slightly at missing everything interesting through his forced isolation from the magical world.
'Cat got your tongue, Malfoy?' Perera inquired, and Draco realized that he had been staring at the head table for a long time, not even answering Perera's question. He flushed angrily and opened his mouth to respond, just when a smattering of applause broke from the Slytherin table at the first Slytherin that got Sorted.
'Easy for you to say, when the person you've been pining after since third year admits they like you back,' Pansy said. Hermione choked on her laughter. Harry, beside her, resisted the urge to pinch himself.
' would have been attached next to them if Pansy didn't feel as if she was above swearing, sometimes.
glad to escape the Malfoy Manor after the tense week following his return from the Quidditch World Cup, the mad glint in his father's eyes more pronounced than usual, his mother's displeased glares adding the sharp nail to the coffin.
Currently, Harry hadn't had any luck in trying to see what Malfoy was up to or even confront him short of stalking him more than Harry was actually doing.
'My lord,' she said, almost reverently, though anyone who knew her well enough could see the flicker of disdain in her eyes, her madness at this
The Dark Lord appeared not to notice, gesturing imperiously with his short, chubby hand for his servant to lay him down on a high backed chair, though Draco couldn't help but wonder how he was going to sit upright in his… current state.
So, between Harry's tale and Ron and Hermione's interjections, they managed to retell what had happened last year as best as they could, ending with how Sirius had asked them to visit him in the Three Broomsticks and told them about Crouch.
'So Summon it!' Blaise said triumphantly, his excited expression making Ron look at him with surprised fondness, before noticing Harry's eyes on him, and flushing and glancing away, a look that said
'Babe...' Parkinson said before exhaling loudly. 'I want a safe place for my sister and her husband to stay, and possibly me too if my parents want to force me to join the Death Eaters.'
Ron looked over her to share a grin with Harry, but Harry couldn't meet it with one of his own. For once, this was something serious, something he couldn't say,
At least he knew what he had to do about Malfoy now. He trusted Pansy - but. It was always nice to do things himself, to help in any way he could
the reason Sirius didn't tell Professor Dumbledore he was near Hogwarts,' Hermione finally said after a long silence. 'And why he went to Professor - Remus's. I thought Sirius had a problem with authority figures or something, I didn't think…' she bit her fingernails. Sathya reached over and gently pulled her hand away.
i don't think I'll be able to update as consistently as usual because i got enrolled into uni, but I'll try to update biweekly, at least.
Pansy, for the first time, smiled a genuine smile at him: a smile that was too full of teeth, crooked and still the prettiest Harry's ever seen her. 'Not to sound cheesy, but if we all put our minds together, I'm
The two nodded awkwardly, apparently with nothing else left to say. Fucking idiots. Draco knew there was no love lost between them; the only reason they were even associating with him was because of their fathers' debts to Lucius, and he knew they much preferred to associate with each other than babysit Draco.
Draco heaved an audible breath. 'I should be going,' he said, sounding like he was anything but pleased. 'Crabbe and Goyle are looking for me… I've stayed too much as it is.'
a huge advantage to Harry, but considering how the other champions had no clue as to what the Task was, that seemed a bit like… cheating, to him.
Ron sighed. 'Harry,' he said. 'It's fine for you to ask for help. Pansy said she was taking care of it, and she even called in a favor from Blaise and told him to talk to Malfoy. You don't
'Thanks, Sathya,' Harry cut off her rambling, mustering up a small smile for her benefit. She smiled back, relieved that
At the Slytherin table, Harry could see Malfoy talking to Crabbe and Goyle, no doubt about the Triwizard Tournament, though it looked as if
Harry couldn't help but notice how the light danced the second oldest Weasley's eyes, though he resolutely put those thoughts away for future consideration.
Mrs. Weasley merely sniffed, her eyes looking suspiciously bright. 'Of course, dear,' she muttered. 'You're always welcome here, you know that.'
'Another thing,' Harry said suddenly, feeling inexplicably embarrassed as everyone automatically turned their eyes towards him. 'Why are you helping, really? Like… there's nothing that's going to serve as an advantage to you.'
'Thank you, Harry dear,' she replied, rubbing a hand through his hair fondly. Ginny smirked at him fro across the table.
'Yeah,' Charlie agreed. 'I might be seeing you all sooner than you think. Just don't tell Percy I told you that.'
we're supposed to do with the dragons, right?' Ron said. 'Harry maybe has to fight it, or, actually, that's all I can think about at the moment.'
With that, he strode determinedly forward, leaving the disbelieving glances of the Golden Trio and one Blaise Zabini in his wake.
'England was shameful, really. Absolutely shameful,' Charlie was saying gloomily towards Fred and George, apparently in a spirited debate with them about Quidditch.
Dobby's ears, which had been perked up before, started to droop for the first time. 'The other house-elves don't approve of Dobby's notions,' he whispered. 'They think house-elves should be there to help wixen, that's all.'
how it feels to be a victim of Voldemort and I'll be damned if anyone else gets hurt when I can prevent. Even you.'
Draco didn't have a doubt that his parents would have both agreed with the Dark Lord's agenda once upon a time. Times, when all Narcissa could think of, was her traitorous sister running away with a mudblood when Lucius was the only thing that was keeping her tethered. Times before she had 13 years of peace for the first time in her life, with family. With
'Isn't this the fourth year in a row the first one got sorted into Ravenclaw?' Draco wondered aloud. To his surprise, Sathya Perera, who was sitting next to Pansy, answered his question. 'Five years, actually. Fun fact - it used to be Ravenclaw that had the most students until Potter got sorted into Gryffindor.'
A chorus of angry whispers descended around the Great Hall, and Draco couldn't help feeling the urge to join them. He knew about the TriWizard Tournament,
hadn't been able to find a way to battle a dragon or whatever that they were about to do. Hermione didn't think he was
'I'm sure you don't,' he felt a smile light up his face. 'How are you doing, Dobby?' He could feel the startled glances that Potter and Weasley exchanged behind his back and the smug look that Blaise sported.
'I hate to say this, mate,' Ron said hesitantly. His fingers were closed tightly around Blaise's, his knuckles white. 'But I think Sathya's right. Putting you in your aunt's house would have seemed the best option for him.'
Harry slowly edged away, and not a moment too soon as he felt the door open with a bang. Blaise was just about to head in the direction of the Slytherin common room, when:
'Is there any way you can get Malfoy? Alone, if possible?' he said, trying desperately to ignore Ron and Hermione's expressions that read,
Ginny bore the same expression of outrage as her brother did at not getting any more information from them. They all clambered on to the train as the last whistle blew, Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie waving at them from the station as the train quickly gained speed.
Ron, surprisingly, had the most positive attitude of the three. 'I don't think Lupin would actually let him go if he didn't think he would be safe though… Sirius is probably the last friend he has left.'
Harry shuddered, refusing to accept the truth that no-one had laid upon his shoulders like a lead weight before. Suddenly he felt
Hermione opened her mouth in astonishment. 'Well, that-that's the first time you've ever said that,' she managed. The Slytherins, beside her, was studiously trying to ignore the byplay, though Harry was certain they were listening in, though he couldn't blame them.
Neville's suspicious glare didn't leave until he saw something in Harry's eyes and relaxed. 'If you say so,' he sighed.
Which was why he was filling them in the morning in the first place. The first thing Harry had done after breakfast was to drag them to their usual seats by the fireplace with a quick
'If you ever get lost, you know where to find us,' George finished, winking obviously at all the Durmstrang students. They laughed, relaxing at last.
Draco, who didn't appear to have been listening to them, hesitantly said: 'Dragons are notoriously known for being protective over their own.'
this was all set in the same place... maybe i AM improving in my writing, after all. i revised the outline for this
Draco, clearly seeing Blaise's expression, continued haltingly: 'I'm sorry about treating anyone who wasn't a pureblood like scum, Blaise.
'I just realized there are more detrimental ways to achieve equality than by outright boycotting, that's all,' she said.
of the participants enjoyed it. It was with surprise that he noticed that Blaise had abandoned his usual composure and was stabbing viciously at his food, aiming a glare at the Ravenclaw table. That just made Harry laugh harder.
Harry opened his mouth to protest, then once again realized the truth in her words. When had Dumbledore ever, truly said he cared for him rather than in relation to Lord Voldemort?
'It's fine, Hermione,' Harry said, cutting her off mid-sentence. Hermione, looking a bit put out, subsided. 'I was just thinking about something in Si- Padfoot's letter, that's all.'
think it is,' Sathya piped up, her face illuminated by the light of the fire, serious and worried. Harry belatedly realized that it was worry for
As they seated themselves on their tables, he saw the Durmstrang students were visibly struggling to choose a house table to sit at. The twins, saving them the trouble, waved them over to the Gryffindor table where they didn't hesitate to sit down.
change from the comfortable life he was living, where he had become sickeningly complacent to the fact that he was a mini-Death Eater in the making with no way out.
Draco exhaled sharply through his mouth as the carriages pulled up beside the castle, wishing that Blaise was with him. The wind rattled alarmingly through the doors as Draco opened the doors to his carriage, trying desperately to hold on to his cloak that seemed determined to get blown away by the wind.
walking with a pair of Slytherins. Harry, himself, would have been surprised if someone told him he would have a polite conversation with not one, but
But Harry, looking at Malfoy, couldn't help but feel that, this time, if he didn't accept, he would end up regretting it.
but yeah!! im back! with a bunch of edits on the previous chapters - you don't need to re-read it if you don't want to because i mostly just changed the writing style to make it more readable and didn't change the plot.
Potter and his friends were already outside the kitchens when he went, all of whom appeared to be arguing about something. They immediately fell silent once they caught sight of him, lapsing into an awkward silence that would have been amusing in any other situation.
'She owns part of the firm,' Blaise explained at their curious looks. 'She'd always had a knack for the law, and with all the… unsavoury things she's done, I don't think there was any other option. Though she
Harry chewed on his bottom lip as he tried to figure out what he should do next. Ron, beside him, was shoveling food into his mouth with no care in the world, Hermione too busy on her crusade to free house-elves to even
'And as for Black, leave it to me,' Pansy promised. 'My parents are solicitors - they'll be able to take care of it. Not to mention Blaise's mother is a force of nature herself.'
Harry nodded, feeling the events of the day crashing on him. Telling his friends this had been nice - he knew he knew he
'It was nothing, dears,' Mrs. Weasley said fondly. 'I would invite you all for Christmas, but I'm sure you would want to stay for the holidays for one thing or the other.'
He sank down into a chair and grinned at Blaise, who unashamedly grinned back. It was at that moment that they both heard the sounds of screaming from outside, and both, exchanging a startled look, drew their wands and waited for Blaise's mother to return from where she went to meet some of her friends.
'And as for you, Potter,' Draco said, expression thoughtful. 'Most families probably left you their possessions out of a misguided sense of gratefulness - you might want to look into that.'
'Well… that's a lot of information,' Pansy said, her tone bored, though Harry could see the anxiety lurking under her eyes. Sathya, apparently, noticed too; she took one of Pansy's hands and started rubbing soothing circles in the back of her palm, not making her calm, exactly, but better than she was before. 'When you told me I can use the Black Manor, I didn't think you actually
'Master Draco! Dobby has missed you, even though he doesn't miss Master Lucius much - ' Dobby's ears quivered and he raised a hand to involuntarily slap himself before resisting with a conscious effort. Looking at him, Draco wondered whether the house-elves, the existence of which he had taken for granted was to help wixen - deserved something more than the servile position they'd been reduced to all their lives.
Finally, she relented. 'Fine. Harry, I need you to send a letter to Pansy, Blaise, and Malfoy. Tell them to meet us near the kitchens in… 30 minutes.'
look on his face, Harry had a feeling that whatever he was about to retort with wasn't going to be pretty.
'Yes, yes,' Harry said, getting to his feet. 'I'm sure I can go to the Owlery in one piece,' he added when it looked as if they were about to follow him.
The day of the Quidditch World Cup dawned bright and full of possibilities for Draco. His parents had opted not to come, instead preferring to give their tickets to Mrs. Zabini and Blaise to go in their stead. Draco was just glad that he didn't have to deal with more awkward silences with his parents.
'The short answer? We're tired, Potter,' Zabini said. 'Tired of being vilified because of our house, tired of being vilified for being a half-blood… you get the drift.'
this is very late but happy hanukkah, merry christmas and happy holidays for anyone who doesn't celebrate either!! love y'all
That was all it took for Hermione to be wrapped up in a conversation with him, apparently forgetting her food in the process. Ron looked at them speculatively and exchanged a look with Harry.
Davies exhaled shakily, running a hand through his normally-impeccable hair. What the bloody hell is going on here? Where on earth did this wound come from? Draco came into the hospital with little to no physical wounds on his body—and there certainly wasn't a matching wound like the one on Harry's chest! The only major concern in young Draco's case was the internal injuries that he suffered from...also the fact that there was so much dark magic left in his body even after we took care of the stuff that was actually causing damage to his body...Unless...
but the action really starts from this chapter, and a lot of non-canon things are happening afterward, so you guys can look forward to that! and yes, i did, in fact, update the chapter count again sjsjsj
Hogwarts was buzzing with the news of the approaching schools for the Triwizard Tournament, but Harry still felt distant from it all, more concentrated in on what Dr-Malfoy was doing, determined to help him in any way he could.
'Stop laughing at us, Hermione,' Ron said, dragging his trunk with difficulty down the staircase. Harry was about to help him when he saw Charlie on top of the staircase, apparently awoken by the chaos, uttering a quiet
It was two hours later, with Harry and Ron both laughing and stumbling into Ron's room, that he noticed the letter lying on his bedside table, the owl nowhere in sight.
'I'm sorry -' Harry could hear the surprise in Malfoy's voice and edged closer, determined to not miss any moment of their conversation with each other. He had a feeling that this was important, and even the quick, short flash of guilt at deliberately eavesdropping on their conversation couldn't sate his curiosity.
'And you all actually mean it,' Parkinson said disbelievingly, standing up. 'I better be going, but…
Parkinson shrugged. 'You interrupted our date,' she said. 'I don't mind her knowing anything, I know I can trust her.' She smiled over at Sathya in an uncharacteristic display of softness. Or maybe it
Harry felt some amount of sympathy for him, yes - but the other half of his mind couldn't help a twisted sense of delight at the fact that Malfoy was finally getting some of his own medicine, that he had seen what he had taunted Harry about all these years in Hogwarts was tangible and
his parents, fearing that something would happen to their one and only heir, had only allowed him to interact with his peers when he went to Hogwarts, only realizing that Lucius had asked Crabbe and Goyle to keep an eye on him when he had entered the train.
Hermione rolled her eyes at him. 'So be it,' she muttered. 'Don't use Hedwig, he's too distinctive.'
A beat. Then: 'Hermione's not the one I'm into,' Ron said quietly, unthinkingly. His panicked face would have been comical in any other situation. Now, all Harry could think about was how painfully awkward this situation was.
'Yes, Potter,' Draco's voice startled them all; he had been sitting on a chair next to the fireplace the whole time, apparently lost in his thoughts. Harry had resisted the urge to comment on it more than once, though he really didn't know why he
Her smile as she beheld the forms of a short, stout man who looked as if he had seen better days, with a baby cradled in his arms, was nothing short of welcoming.
Sathya shrugged. 'Seemed pretty appropriate. The only thing we're missing is a cape - we could dress up as Batman or something.' Turning to Pansy, she said: 'You would make an
Sirius had mentioned this was how Slytherins operated; they would rather believe they were equal in their terms, and
And, for the second time that day, Harry found himself relaying the events that had happened in the aftermath of the Quidditch World Cup.
Harry, feeling sick, realized that the threat of Voldemort was at the forefront of their minds. At that moment, his lingering belief that his vision was just that - a
He was wedged in between two pillars, trying to not breathe too audibly as he spied on the figures of Zabini and Malfoy, apparently in intense conversation with each other. Harry was close to dozing off; it was nearly 11 pm, and Harry had stayed up doing the exact same thing yesterday, Ron having given up staying up for him a long time ago.
The thing was. Well. Draco had about one friend in total. It was an underestimation to say that he had grown up
Though Harry couldn't help but notice that the usual hustle and bustle were unusually devoid among those he recognized as Slytherins, and even some Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs.
about sleeping. Harry could hear the distant noise of something exploding in the twins' room and felt certain they were on the same boat.
thinking of when he was five and burned his hand from trying to cook for the first time. 'But there are people out there who want to
'Hermione…' Harry hesitated briefly before tearing off a piece of parchment from his unfinished essay and scribbling a quick note to Pansy, Blaise, and Malfoy. He looked up to find Hermione frowning over at the essay, along with someone akin to hurt in her eyes.
'Malfoy,' Harry started. Then he didn't know how to continue. Malfoy too appeared at a loss for words, opening and closing his mouth slowly.
more cheerful as the day progressed, unable to keep his excitement at bay for another year at Hogwarts. For a moment, he was eleven again, looking forward to leaving the Dursleys to somewhere they couldn't follow, somewhere they wouldn't
'I don't think any of us have anywhere else to be now, do we?' Draco asked, in a tone that clearly said he was tired of waiting.
i posted another chapter directly after this, so pls don't forget to read that too! i know from personal experience that ao3's emails get messed up sometimes haha
'He's literally doing the bare minimum, Hermione,' Harry rolled his eyes. 'You don't need to sound so impressed.'
(And Harry resisted saying that this was the first time anyone had ever told him that, unconditionally: their affection had always been conditional; the Dursleys, taking him in yet forcing him to do their work for him, Hogwarts, but fighting basilisks and werewolves in return, never staying for the summer.
'If we're going to do this - this whole vigilante thing we have going on - we're going to do it properly. And you have to
Ginny grimaced suddenly. 'Please don't tell me it's Malfoy,' she practically begged. 'You may be my brother, but I expect you to at least have
Hermione, apparently noticing Ron's confusion, sighed deeply through her nose. It was the deep sigh of someone who was simply
'Just.. get to the forest, and go straight or take the left, okay? And stay there until I come to look for you.'
because i apparently can't keep to a concrete plot lmao (i might change the chapter count again - it'll probably increase by a couple, we'll have to wait and see)
Draco growled to himself, his glare only worsening as he felt a letter land on his face, the owl only pausing to hoot at him before flying back to the Owlery. He opened the crumpled piece of parchment that looked as if it was written in a hurry, curious despite himself as to its contents.
Ron, seeing the all too familiar look on his face, groaned. ''Suppose there's no convincing you to leave it alone and
'I did promise I'd get you out of there, didn't I?' Harry said, trying to lighten the mood though he felt his smile was more forced that usual. He was surprised to feel a sense of concern for the blonde; he had always felt that he

'Go to the left, Potter,' he found himself saying wearily. 'There's a less likely chance of them following you, there.'
that his taunts about the Dark Lord to the Golden Trio weren't suddenly affected airs to make himself look better anymore. They were honest, terrifying, and far darker than he had imagined.
'At least you don't have Herbology with the Hufflepuffs, like us,' Harry volunteered, rising up from his chair himself. Hermione was hurriedly stuffing all her belongings into her bag and Harry shuddered to think how heavy that bag was going to be to carry, especially with her recent acquirement of ten more books on Wizarding history.
Draco was abruptly drawn back to the present by Crabbe's words. He forced a smile on his face and said, 'I was thinking of the Triwizard Tournament, that's all.'
'Don't believe me if you don't want to,' Parkinson continued, misinterpreting the shock on their faces as disbelief. 'But I
'FRED, GEORGE, GINNY, GET DOWN HERE!' she bellowed up the staircase. Various noises of grumbled assent followed, and Mrs. Weasley, apparently satisfied, turned towards them. 'Breakfast, dears?'
He sat back in his chair as the mascots for Bulgaria were announced, both Blaise and he no taking any notice of Mrs. Zabini's amused warning to 'close your eyes if you don't want to make an embarrassment of yourselves, dears.'
'What are we going to do now?' Ron said now, apparently voicing what they were all thinking. Harry shrugged. Then both, in unison, looked at Hermione, who had a thoughtful look on her face.
'Besides...' Harry said slowly. He was sure he wasn't imagining it when Ron had looked over the person standing next to Malfoy with interest. Ron, apparently noticing his train of thought, groaned softly.
Blaise rolled his eyes. 'And still, you only care about your own comfort,' he muttered, finally gesturing for Draco to sit down. Draco sat down, interested in what Blaise was about to say despite feeling as if he wasn't ready to hear it. 'Have you, for one moment, thought about someone other than yourself? That not everyone is as privileged as you and has the ministry in their daddy's pocket?'
'Miss. Granger, Mr. Potter, kindly refrain from arguing, please,' Professor Sprout's cheerful voice called out amidst sniggers from the entire class.
(Though he supposed he couldn't be called Tom Riddle anymore; this wasn't the charismatic Tom Riddle he knew from the diary, filled with ambition, this was someone, some
Bill and Charlie had both decided to see them off at King's Cross, though, Percy, apologizing profusely, said that Crouch needed him at the office.
Ron made an undignified sound as Victor Krum sat across from him. Harry would go so far as to say that he
Though he still felt suspicious of Malfoy - an innate response after being bullied by him for so long, Harry figured - the fact that Malfoy didn't automatically start sprouting pure-blood rhetoric after being confronted went a long way.
'Don't think Malfoy is in any position to refuse your help, though, Harry,' Ron said, screwing his face up in concentration as he looked at his cards. 'He sounded desperate enough from the conversation between him and Blaise you overheard.' Ron's tone was disapproving and eerily reminiscent of Hermione when Ron and Harry did something she didn't approve of.
Which was exactly when he was manhandled into an empty classroom by Pansy Parkinson. Everyone was too distracted by the arrival of the other schools to pay them much attention, which was the only reason why no one noticed a Slytherin abducting a
Harry thought, almost bursting into laughter as he realized that Ginny had shuddered exactly as he had from across him.
'I don't know Hermione,' Harry sighed. 'Professor Lupin says it's fine and Sirius did manage to not get captured while everyone was actively looking for him.'
' she said. They continued to stare at her, both their faces taking on a deadpan expression that said,
Draco wondered if Slytherin, if ever, had the most number of students that had been sorted into the first year. He was willing to bet that there
It had been barely a week and Draco was looking forward to escaping the Malfoy Manor to see the Quidditch World Cup with more than his usual amount of fervor. The Dark Lord usually stayed shut in his father's study, the only sound coming from Lucius or occasionally Pettigrew entering and exiting the study.
The Great Hall was unusually silent as the hat finished its singing, the Draco knowing that the Slytherins, at least, realized what the underlying meaning was.
Ron, bemused, returned to shoveling eggs into his mouth as he realized no-one was going to explain exactly
'Dobby's happy to help Draco Malfoy and his friends.' Dobby replied, before Disapperating with a harsh
It didn't take long for the food to disappear - everyone was tired and hungry from their journey to Hogwarts, and more than a few first and second years were practically drooping in their seats, uncaring of decorum.
A carriage which contained Ginny and another girl with blonde and the oddest glasses Harry had ever seen. 'Oh.' Ginny said flatly. 'Hi.'
Then Harry remembered Malfoy, Voldemort, and everything else and suddenly that illusion was shattered.
He needed to think. He needed to talk to someone who could understand him wanting to help Malfoy, or at least tolerate it - because apparently even
He looked up as someone nudged his shoulder, seeing Neville's assessing glance on him. 'You okay, Harry?' he said quietly, not interrupting the animated conversation that Seamus, Dean, and Ron were having, Hermione, having thoroughly lost herself in her book at that point.
'Malfoys bow for no-one, my Dragon,' Lucius had said when Draco was five, from what felt like a lifetime ago, when all he felt was love and reverence for his father.
had asked his father, faux-sweetly, if he could go to a friend's house for the rest of the summer, leaving no room for argument. Draco felt grateful for his mother for intervening - he was sure he couldn't stand a moment in this house otherwise - but.
the closest he'd come to that was when sirius had asked him, last may, if he's wanted to stay with him, but harry couldn't help but wonder whether taking care of him would be an annoyance for sirius, or anyone else, really.)
Sometimes Harry wondered how the Wizarding world could be equal parts progressive and regressive, all at once. He had been gratified to find that most wixen didn't see a problem with same-sex couples or non-binary genders and yet. There was still rampant distrust against muggle-borns, werewolves, mermaids - anyone that threatened their perfectly ordered world where wixen were superior above everyone and everything else.
Hermione rolled her eyes at them both, but Harry could see the soft gleam in her eyes that she couldn't hide.
The next day dawned bright and early without any incidents from either Fred or George, which Harry couldn't help but be surprised by. He could feel the thrum of excitement in his head, his heartbeat almost mimicking the words
'It's not as if any of them have tried to prove otherwise,' Hermione piped up for the first time, and Harry resisted the urge to groan and bury his face in his hands. 'And you didn't try to stop Malfoy from calling me a mudblood, either.'
He caught only a glimpse of what appeared to be expensive furniture before he came face to face with the dark-skinned teenager. 'Zabini Resi-
adult,' Hermione appeared appeased, for now. Then a smile, almost unbidden, rose to her face. 'You just want to help Malfoy now, don't you?'
'Couldn't help hearing the tail end of your conversation,' Weasley grinned at Blaise, who had the absolute audacity to grin back. 'Guess all Slytherins aren't bad after all.' He continued, with a pointed look at Draco. Potter and Granger were noticeably silent beside him. Granger, in particular, had a calculating look on her face that wouldn't have looked out of place in a Slytherin. And wasn't
'Right,' Granger said briskly, tickling the peach to open the trapdoor to the kitchens. 'We're still waiting for Pansy and Blaise, so if you could take a seat, Draco?'
'What did she say?' Ron said eagerly, once she was out of earshot. Harry, taking heed from Hermione's murderous glare, shook his head and mimed zipping his lips shut.
anyway, i've always wanted to explore blaise and pansy as their own characters than as an extension of draco so stay tuned for more pansy and blaise content!
He was shivering uncontrollably, clutching his cloak tightly to his chest as it fought against the rushing wind. He was in a thoroughly bad mood from having Crabbe and Goyle from following him around like the useless loons they were; the rain seemed almost as if it was mocking him.
It was unfortunate, Harry thought, that he couldn't use any magic during the holidays to hex both the twins into oblivion.
that had happened but he wasn't complaining. 'She's always been rooting for you and Ginny to get together somehow.'
'Oh,' she said, abruptly breaking away from her conversation when she saw them approach her. Harry raised an eyebrow amusedly, glad that she wasn't livid any longer. Ron, however, was looking at Zabini and Hermione with an accusing look in his eyes and Harry restrained the urge to smack his head against his palm. This did
'I wish the feast would start,' Parkinson complained, echoed by most of those surrounding her since, apparently, it
Thankfully, Harry was saved from overthinking - well, more than he already had - by the quite literally explosive arrival of the Weasleys at his uncle's house, Harry unable to help but feel the stress from the last few days melting away through Mrs. Weasley's motherly hug and Mr. Weasley ruffling his hair fondly.
Harry rolled his eyes impatiently. “Because. It’s the same expression that you wear whenever you’re about to insult somebody’s clothing at the Ministry—and it’s also the same expression that you make in bed when you’re about to tease me or do something that I don’t like.”
The blonde’s face screwed into a puzzled face as he tried desperately to think of what he could say to feed his best friend’s curiosity without revealing who he was actually dating.
"Aha! I shall explain momentarily!" Davies turned back to Kingsley. "Minister, I can only assume that the reason for your appearance here is due to Mr. Potter's injuries, yes?"
"Because we can't gauge any side affects of the potion as well if we apply it to an unconscious person," said Blackwell. "Besides—applying the potion when the patient is conscious will help it to work in tangent with their body to help speed up the healing process naturally."
A moment later, Ron's face suddenly took on the color of a tomato—and Harry knew that his prayer hadn't been answered.
The leader of the snatcher group looked over at Harry in surprise. “Well, well, well—what do we have here, boys?”
He did recognize her from Hogwarts though, he realized after seeing her face up close. Her hair had usually been pulled up into a ponytail, and she was always talking nonstop—she had a bit of a screechy voice, Harry remembered with a grimace.
Before Draco could even move, the spell hit Harry square in the chest—the raven haired boy’s unconscious form jolting at the impact of the spell. Draco wasn’t sure what the spell had done until he saw a bright stain of crimson beginning to seep through Harry’s clothing.
"Now—where were we..." Davies glanced around before striding over to a nearby cabinet. After rustling inside for a moment, he returned with two small jars of what appeared to be colored rocks. "Blackwell?" Davies passed one of the jars over to his comrade.
Florence had gone absolutely pale with fear when he saw the large gash decorating Harry’s chest. Though he and several of the other Aurors had tried to mend it, the wound appeared to be imbued with dark magic, and refused to close. All Florence could do was try to administer superficial first aid that would help ease Harry’s pain and try to minimize the bleeding. Draco, on the other hand, seemed relatively unharmed at first glance—there were no large wounds on his body aside from a few scratches here and there, and he wasn’t bleeding like Harry was. The only problem lay that he remained unconscious. Florence had tried rousing Draco, but nothing seemed to snap him out of his slumber. That was when the Auror then suspected that the boy must have been hit with dark magic as well—something that was keeping him from coming to.
Draco didn’t respond, knowing that doing so would lower his guard and give the man another opening for a quick attack.
“I wanna help too—but we can’t just run out there and fight them!” Draco protested, watching helplessly as three of the snatchers used their wands to levitate the Hippogriff into the air.
Blackwell strode to Harry's bedside, resting his fingers on the still-unconscious boy's neck to check his pulse. He nodded, then went to Draco's bed and repeated the same action. Both healers monitored the appearance of their patients carefully as they waited for a sign of either boy starting to stir.
“I see.....,” The blonde replied somewhat monotonously. He and Harry didn’t watch a ton of TV- they did indulge in movies quite a few nights of the week when they had the time though.
“Over there...” Draco whispered lowly, face inches beside Harry’s. Harry attempted to ignore the feeling of the blonde’s breath tickling his ear, and tried to look where Draco was gesturing. The pair peeked up above the bushes they were hiding behind just as a group of 4 men burst out of the trees and stood in the clearing—the exact place where Harry and Draco had just been seconds before.
Draco groaned in annoyance and threw a loathing glare at the door when he head Blaise yelling at the Telly from downstairs. Harry bore an equally put-out expression as he raised his head to look for the source of the commotion.
Draco suddenly felt a sharp jolt and gasped in pain—his wand falling from his hand. A deep stabbing pain had quickly begun to fill his chest, rendering him unable to remain upright. He fell to the ground, clutching his chest in agony as the unbearable pain seared into his skin like it was being carved by a knife.
He had immediately rounded up a team of Aurors to go find the two—and upon arrival, found Harry and Draco unconscious on the ground. As expected, none of the snatchers seemed to have stuck around—and so the Aurors wasted no time racing the two boys to St. Mungo’s.
The figure that lay in the bed looked pale and fragile—face gaunt with dark circles and pasty skin that seemed almost translucent against the crisp white sheets. The only thing that distinguished it from a corpse was the slight rise and fall of his chest.
“Ron...” Hermione chastised with a frown, but even she didn’t try to hide her apparent displeasure at seeing the blonde Slytherin again.
“I’m sorry Mr. Potter, you’ll have to understand that this isn’t personal—I just need to make sure that you won’t follow us....”
“Can I take it from your reaction that you’re the lucky man?” The Slytherin turned to Ron with a widening grin.
“Well, we still have an active bet between the three of us that has yet to decide a winner...” Theo interjected solemnly, and Blaise and Pansy immediately snapped to attention with a gasp.
The blonde punctuated the statement with a wink and a quick peck on his lover's cheek—and that was enough to cause the full grown male to blush completely red in the face.
Apparently something was said that he missed, for he soon realized that Harry and Kingsley were both staring straight at him— waiting for him to do something.
"That's quite alright. We have more pressing matters at hand. The formalities can wait," Kingsley said.
He cleared his throat discretely and nudged Blaise to get the Italian’s eyes off of the Telly screen. “Uh, Blaise....my.....roommate.....”
Polite clapping ensued, with some of the more friendly Aurors whistling enthusiastically as Harry emerged from an adjoining room behind the podium where Kingsley stood—moving until he was in the center of the room and stood facing Kingsley.
Kingsley nodded in satisfaction and turned to Draco, still moving his wand over the pair of connected arms. “And you, Draco Lucius Malfoy—do you swear to uphold to all of the terms written on your Auror contract—to do your best to keep yourself and your partner safe, and always do what is truly the right thing in any situation you may encounter while performing your duties as Auror?”
“I’ll buy you a new pair?” The dark haired wizard offered tentatively, doing his best to sound completely remorseful while trying to tug Draco’s neck back down so that they could continue their snogging.
Harry sighed and gave the couch another frown. “It doesn’t really make sense for the couch to be facing the kitchen though......”
." Harry's tone took on a teasing lilt as he called the blonde's surname—smirking a bit despite the petulant scowl the grey eyes were directing towards him.
“Alright, pay up Nott!” She crooned gleefully, suddenly stretching her hand out to the quiet male beside her.
"Excellent, I'll break out the fine China then...." Draco muttered dryly, earning a sharp glare from both Harry and Ron. The blonde raised his hands in defense and strode back ahead of them to the kitchen—leaving Harry to talk to the two.
Healer Davies peered at Harry briefly before nodding his head in self-satisfaction. "As you can see, young Mr. Potter is doing just fine now that he's out of surgery."
Pansy rubbed her hands together eagerly. “Alright, now I’m getting excited! C’mon, spare none of the juicy details!”
“It looks like you’ll have to get leaving in a few minutes. The Department hasn’t given many specifics of this mission, so there isn’t a required time which you need to be out or return by...” The older man stroked his mustache thoughtfully. “If It were me, I’d try to find any evidence of the group of snatchers in question and check the surrounding area—you two should probably only be out for a few hours at most. Once you’ve done that, return back here with a report on your findings.”
Harry cast a nervous glance at Draco, but the blonde simply stared at the floor—his gaze transfixed like he was deep in thought.
Knightly looked like he was about to faint from shock. "Healer Davies," he whispered. "What is going on? Are my two boys gonna be alright, or not?!"
“Well, as to your question about a new Auror partner...,” Kingsley stated the topic gingerly, and suddenly started to avoid Harry’s eyes.
Draco felt his heart hammering madly against his ribs and unintentionally tightened his grip around Harry’s arm. “..Y-Yes...I swear...”
“But since I’m not working with Mr. Knightly anymore...does that mean that I’m going to be assigned another Auror to work alongside?”
"Well fine then. As long as you swear that you've change for the better and aren't pretending—I guess I'll have to be fine with my best mate shacking up with a weasel." The redhead lamented with a sigh, standing up and pulling Hermione up with him.
The woman picked up her wand and flourished it a few times, muttering spells under her breath. Two clipboards with a hefty stack of paper on each suddenly came zooming from a hallway behind her—landing on the desk in front of her with a solid ‘
“Alright, then let’s do this,” Theo offered with a smirk of his own. “Have Potter and Malfoy tell us the story of how they started dating...then we’ll reveal the bet we made, and the winner of said bet...”
“So, I suppose proper introductions are in order then...” Draco raised his voice to get his fellow Slytherins to be quiet—just as Hermione and Ron returned to the table, the latter thankfully not looking on the verge of sickness anymore.
Knightly nodded quickly, grabbing Harry's hand closest to him and squeezing gently. "You and Draco were injured on your mission, but don't worry—you have a team of the best healers helping to fix you up, ma'boy!"
Harry threw a glare at the back off the blonde’s head before looking around and surveying their location. Minutes passed and Draco still hadn’t stopped pacing.
Blaise was still sacked out against the cushions of the sofa as he continued to hurl insults towards the television screen—waving a hand around violently for apparent increased emphasis. Draco sighed in defeat. There was no way that he was going to be able to convince Blaise to leave now that he had immersed himself in the middle of an episode of his favorite show.
The voice that came from the blonde wasn't the usually snarky, cool, confident Draco that he was used to. Instead he sounded so scared, so worried, so....vulnerable.
know by now?" He continued, glancing up with a smirk to see the slight blush stain the dark haired male's cheeks.
..nuh.......” Draco moaned in pleasure as Harry quickly took control of the kiss—snaking a hand around the back of his neck and holding him firmly in place. The blonde whimpered in pleasure as the inside of his mouth was throughly ravished by the Gryffindor—tongues tangling and caressing each other gently but firmly.
Ron glowered at the dark skinned male a raised a fist threateningly. “Y-you! Leave her alone you no good!—”
“With the recommendation of Auror Knightly, we will now proceed with the affirmation and oath by the candidates for initiation.”
“Alright, then I’ll go first,” Harry stated firmly, keen to get his own say on a rule before Draco decided on something ridiculous. “How about; ‘
Harry quickly covered the pale lips with his hand before Draco could get another word out, but clearly the message had gotten across to Ron—who looked on the verge of being sick again. He felt relief but also a bit of sorrow as he waved at the two in the fireplace before they tossed a pinch of powder and disappeared into a spark of flames.
He and Draco had arrived first at the quaint French cafe that they had agreed to set their luncheon at, (per Draco’s request), and sat at their table while they waited for their other guests to arrive. Blaise had been the next to arrive soon after, all smiles and not seeming nervous at all about the whole meeting. Seeing as he had been the most accepting of their relationship so far, his presence actually helped Harry to relax a little—lightening the atmosphere at the same time. A few minutes of talking with his best mate, and Draco’s anxiety seemed to lessen substantially as well.
“We should definitely test out the shagability of the couch in this position,” He stated with serious nod, earning an eye roll from the male underneath him.
“Harry, it’s so nice to see you,” Hermione greeted warmly, stepping forwards to give him her customary greeting hug.
“Well we wouldn’t have to be searching for it in the first place if you wouldn’t have let it escape, you tosser!”
“What a minute, so let me get this straight...” Ron’s booming voice suddenly cut through, and all eyes turned to him.
“Thanks...” Harry murmured quietly, hesitantly pulling the mug closest to him into his hands. Kingsley nodded and turned to glance at Draco, but the blonde remained frozen and made no move to reach for his mug—staring blankly at the wall somewhere behind Kingsley.
The crisp sound of a bell filled the cafe, and as the party looked toward the sound, the oak door of the cafe suddenly swung open wide as two figures walked in.
Harry grimaced at the mere mention of the vile bone replenishing potion that he had been forced to take in second year. Just the name brought back horrible flashbacks of that most unfortunate accident involving a bewitched bludger and Gildroy Lockhart.
Draco crossed his arms over his chest and stared Harry down. “Alright then savior of the Wizarding World—what’s your plan?”
Harry nodded tentatively, then, seeming to remember something, snapped his head around. "Wait—what about Malfoy?" he asked quickly.
"Everything is merely speculation, at this point," Davies responded slowly. "But we think...that the dark magic that we couldn't get rid of—the magic that we said we found in both their bodies in the same spot...There may be a chance that that magic was the result of a curse that was placed on them...A curse that may be inflicting damage on both of their bodies."
A sudden branch breaking stopped Draco’s line of thought, and he froze—pulling his wand out instinctively.
“Ah, well...it seems like he’s going to be here soon so......I guess you’ll have a chance to meet him...”
"Now, try not too tense up too much, alright?" Davies had slipped a mask over his grinning face and pulled gloves onto his hands. He hovered over Harry's wound with the potion bottle firmly in hand as he gave the wound another survey.
“And that was pretty much it for the beginning of the story,” Harry concluded, flushing slightly at all of the eager eyes fixated on him.
"To make a long story short—once I started working at the Ministry, around the same time that you guys started, Malfoy and I were almost immediately assigned to work together as partners on Auror cases. At first we were both against the idea, but.....well, things happened....and we decided to date." He finished somewhat awkwardly, finding no point in actually going into all of the details.
“Excellent. Now—you must both swear by the rules and ethos of the Department of Aurors, to uphold and protect the name with which you will soon be bestowed.” Kingsley shifted parchments and cleared his throat before reading.
“Fine, it’s not your fault....but just hurry up and get rid of him. I don’t want to waste our entire weekend together because Zabini keeps coming over here.”
“Put another chain around its wings so that it doesn’t fly off again,” The fourth wizard advised as he surveyed the other three wizards. He seemed to be the boss of the operation.
“Oh! I think they said that they were going to be coming together after work—I guess they picked up an extra shift today...so probably 10...15 minutes..?” The Italian replied after glancing down at his own wristwatch.
Kingsley frowned slightly. “I asked if you’re feeling alright. You look pale—do you feel nauseous or anything?”
"—We have enough time to fit it a quick round before they get here!" Draco interrupted smoothly, trailing his hands around Harry's backside to rest snuggly at his ass.
Harry gaped in disbelief as he struggled to keep his face from flushing a deeper color red. “How can you all discuss things like this so calmly?! This is our private life we’re talking about!”
The snatcher watched Draco tend to the unconscious Harry with a great deal of fascination and amusement.
“So...you talked to Pansy and Theo, then? About... Harry and I..?” Draco asked his fellow Slytherin hesitantly—almost forgotten anxiety slowly creeping back into his voice at the topic he wanted least to discuss.
Acting before his lover could deliver what would no doubt be a clever and witty remark to turn Hermione’s statement, Harry quickly kicked Draco in the shin—silencing any retort on the tip of his tongue.
Blaise grinned and rose from the couch, turning to meet the figure his friend was gesturing towards. “Pleasure to meet yo—” The Slytherin stopped and raised an interested eyebrow, an amused smirk slowly drawing its way into his lips.
The elder wizard shuddered at the memory of how unsettled and panicked Draco had sounded. The way that the boy’s voice trembled and his sentences broke as he gasped for air—Florence closed his eyes painfully and shook his head.
Blaise snickered and clapped Theo on the back. “I swear, you shoulda been placed in Ravenclaw you goodie goodie.”
“What in Merlin’s name are you doing?” Harry finally asked irritably, sighing in relief when at last the blonde came to a stop.
“Well then, is there any...advice...that your could...possibly give us...?” Draco bit the inside of his cheek awkwardly as Harry stared at him as if he had two heads, and Florence looked like he wanted gush over how cute he was acting.
” He stressed tiredly. “The terms listed on the contract only hold if they apply to both members of the contract—you can’t just list any silly whim you want the other to obey.”
Blaise rolled his eyes and shook his head dramatically. “Of course not. The only people who still care about those kind of things anymore are the old-timers; basically meaning our parents and anyone older.” He chuckled mischievously and continued. “I’ve even had the Muggle boyfriend or two over the last few years...”
Draco scowled and released his hold around his lover’s shoulders with a huff. “You’re too bloody defenseless...”
“But sir...!” Harry protested indignantly. “Past feelings aside—how can you just pair him up as my partner?! Does Malfoy even know anything about being an Auror?!”
“Weasley...and Granger, right? Blaise Zabini, at your service.” He offered his hand to Hermione, who took it with obvious tentativeness.
“Eh? So what—somebody saw us snogging on the couch. That’s nothing to get your knickers in a twist about.”
“Knightly only ever sings praises when he talks about you, so why would you have any reason to think that you weren’t doing well?”
“Since we never had an eyewitness, we’ve always argued about whose perception of what actually happened was the right one...,” Harry finally finished.
The reason for this lover's spat in the early afternoon of a perfectly nice Saturday, was concerning that of the matter of Harry wanting to finally come out with their relationship to their friends—starting, he suggested, with Ron and Hermione.
“Quite smashingly, if I do say so myself! Potter was excellent, as always Minister!” Florence beamed brightly, clapping Harry on the back proudly.
“I s’pose it’s ‘bout time we head on back to the Ministry—Minister Kingsley’s gonna wanna full report on this by the end of the day, so we best skedaddle!”
Hermione gaped at the blonde in clear confusion, while Ron settled for merely giving the Slytherin a dirty look—following his every movement as he pulled out a chair next to Harry and sat down.
Blaise returned the look with a snicker. “Ah, well you see...Theo and Pans made a bet about Granger and Wesley getting hitched. There was a rumor in Witch Weekly that those two had gotten engaged and held a secret wedding a while back, but I think there was still speculation about whether or not it was actually true,” He rambled with a shrug. “Pansy said that they did get married, and Theo said that they didn’t. They made the bet a while ago, that’s why Theo thought that Pansy had already forgotten.”
“Yep, Theo’s normally pretty quiet—but the younger kids take an especial liking to him for some reason!” Blaise commented somewhat enviously.
“I mean, sure—we already told Granger, Weaslebe, and Blaise about us- but that’s only half of the party that you’re inviting! Add in Theo, Pansy, and Weaslette and I’m pretty sure things are gonna go downhill real fast...”
“Forgive me if my sense of interior decorating is outdated, but why in Merlin’s name would have your couch facing the kitchen instead of the Telly?”
." He passed a beautiful emerald green jumper over to Harry with a smirk—who took it somewhat doubtfully.
"In the meantime, I think we should apply more of the healing potion onto both Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy's wounds while they're under anesthesia," Davies suggested, turning to Blackwell. "What do you think?"
Kingsley nodded slowly. “Yes. Aside from receiving excellent marks on all of his N.E.W.T.’s, Malfoy has been under the close watch and mentorship of one of our Aurors here from the time he arrived...He asked specifically for a job as an Auror, and began his training almost immediately...”
Florence gave a quick glance around. He had successfully apparated them directly outside the entrance to the Ministry of Magic—as close as you could get with the protective wards that were up. “Not bad, not bad! Alright then! Off to the Ministers office!”
"Yes, Potter is no longer in surgery," Davies confirmed. "We're still observing him though, as to why he isn't here with Mr. Malfoy."
“Hey mate—look, I hate to ruin your day, but something just came up suddenly so I’m gonna need you to scram,” He tried bluntly, not bothering to sound remorseful when he knew full well that his shag with Harry was on the line.
Again, thankfully Blaise’s eyes had taken to wandering around the room, so this exchange went unnoticed. “You don’t sound too enthused about it.....Did your roommate make you move the furniture?”
“Oh, and don’t worry. I’ll take the liberty of telling Pans and Theo about this, so expect an owl from them soon~!” The Italian called and sent one last wink before throwing his powder and disappearing into flames.
“You sure keep it together in front of the important people, but now that we’re alone your mask sure has fallen, Malfoy.”,” Harry goaded, strangely happy to see Draco exhibiting characteristics that he was actually familiar with from school.
Ron watched the pair banter with an increasingly sickening expression painting his face. “Bloody hell...you two must be together—or else you must just really like having lover’s spats...”
It was days like this that made him all the more grateful that he had defeated Voldemort and survived through the war. The war had come and gone like the passing of the wind—some days it felt as though it were just yesterday, yet others still felt as though it had all just been a bad dream.
"Does anything hurt? You have to tell us if it does, alright? Blimey Harry, you scared us to death!" Knightly wailed.
"Oh, Minister!" The wizard at the front of the group started in surprise. He evidently hadn't expected any one else to be in the room—much less the Minister of Magic. He walked further into the room, still flanked by a group of several other wizards and witches dressed in similar white robes. "What an absolute privilege."
"So, after testing Mr. Malfoy and realizing that he too had been exposed to the same dark magic that Mr. Potter had been, we realized that we had to work quickly to find a cure for both of them," said Davies. "Luckily for us here at St. Mungo's, we have several healers who are specialized in the research and healing of dark magic. After some trial and error, we ended up dispelling enough dark magic that we were able to start healing the large laceration on Mr. Potter's chest, in addition to expelling the dark magic that seemed to be sapping away Mr. Malfoy's vitals as well." Davies glanced around to make sure that everyone was still following along.
Harry heard a dry chuckle come behind Davies. As he and several nurses stepped to the side, Harry was finally able to see over to where Draco lay in his own hospital bed—lounging against the starched pillows with the air of prince resting in his bedroom—not of a patient in a stuffy hospital.
“Hey Hermione,” Harry murmured back— breathing a slight sigh of relief at her normal attitude before releasing her and turning to the redhead next to her.
“Shh!” Draco clamped a hand around Harry’s mouth and sunk down to a low squat, dragging Harry down with them. Harry glared at the blonde indignantly at the treatment, but Draco wouldn’t relent.
"I have the reports, sir!" The young nurse who Davies had instructed to leave had just returned through the doors of the ward—a small stack of parchment papers in her hand.
Draco looked doubtful. “Blaise, seriously. We’ve......actually been seeing each other for a while.....”
“Ah, not to worry Malfoy—I called you up here on purpose. I figured that the three of us should have a little meeting before we proceed with the initiation ceremony tomorrow,” Kingsley stated with a slight grimace, gesturing for the two to follow him over to a small sitting area further in the office.
“By that time it’ll be too late!” Harry hissed angrily. “By the time we send message to the other Aurors and get some back up here, the snatchers will already be gone and the Hippogriff with them!”
"I tried dating her, but I never truly fell in love with her. I love her as a sister, but nothing in the romantic sense. After that I took a break from dating—honestly I never really tried to find someone to date. But after a while, I realized it was just because I didn't find an attraction to women—I felt myself drawn to men....." Harry tried to explain himself logically, but he didn't know if he was making any sense.
“Oh stop being such a drama queen, Malfoy. Going out to lunch with friends is nowhere near death on the danger scale.”
“What do you guys think?” There was mischievous twinkle in Kingsley’s eyes as he turned the parchment around and read each word out loud.
“Oi, who do you think you are—” Ron started indignantly, but shut up when given a pointed look by Harry.
All eyes trained expectantly on Davies as the healer took his place in the center of their group. "Now," he started, flourishing his arms about as he spoke. "I can imagine the great deal of questions you all must have as to the unpleasant circumstances that have brought us all together on this day." He paused, clasping his hands behind his back and pacing. "When Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Potter were brought here, they were both in grave conditions. Mr. Potter was our priority, however, because he had sustained several large lacerations that were bleeding profusely. What we hadn't realized though, was that Mr. Malfoy had sustained just as grave of injuries—only his weren't visible to the eye."
Draco smirked evilly and reached for his lover’s hand. “What’s wrong Weaslebe? You upset because I snatched him first?” The blonde turned and kissed Harry’s hand gently before pulling on it to get him to sit down.
“You two work at the Ministry as well?” This time it was Draco’s voice that cut in, and he glanced at the pair with an expression akin to honest curiosity.
"Well, that could've gone a hell of a lot worse!" Draco replied brightly, laughing as he remembered the face that Ron was making again.
Either Blaise didn’t hear him, or merely chose to ignore him (the blonde bet the latter), for the dark skinned Italian paid no heed to the words directed towards him and chose to continue watching his show—throwing another few taunts at the screen happily.
“So...what exactly do we need to discuss...?” Harry asked dryly, clearly still not on board with the whole idea of getting along with Draco.
“You—I need the head of the dark magic medicinal ward down here, now! Explain the situation and tell him to meet us in the operating room!”
Draco opened his mouth to retort, but snapped shut it with a pout—deciding that he was probably just going to dig himself into a deeper hole.
Draco nodded. “I...knew we had to get backup, so I sent you that message....I jumped in to help Harry after, but all of the snatchers took off with the Hippogriff before we could stop them....Except for one guy.” He frowned and ran a trembling hand through his hair. “That guy, I think he was the leader. His magic was really strong and Harry got knocked by one of his spells before I could do anything.”
Knightly trained a wary expression on the healer, but complied when Kingsley tugged on his robes. The two backed a safe distance away until they were once again beside Draco's bed. Together, the three watched as the nurses prepped Harry—leaning his bed back and pulling the sheets down until the wound was fully visible and easily accessible.
Harry gently tugged Draco’s neck back down to connect their lips once more, and he resumed his earlier attempts at groping his lover’s firm ass.
“Yes, I as well...” Theo murmured with a somewhat confused frown and a nod of his head. “That seems like...somewhat
She peered over them, tracing a finger down the text before tapping on one particular spot. “It says here that Mr. Malfoy was sent to surgery earlier but is now resting in the critical ward, currently anesthetized. And, Mr. Potter is—...” She turned her gaze to the other clipboard and squinted, then sighed. “It says that Mr. Potter is still in surgery....”
"Oh, I dunno. Maybe being a sarcastic asshole and calling them wankers the moment they walked in the door." The dark haired male deadpanned, shooting his lover an unamused scowl.
“Splendid—we should be just in time to tune in for the show!” The dark skinned male exclaimed with a grin, strolling over to take a seat next to Draco on the couch. He stopped short, however, and gave the couch a once over before raising a questioning eyebrow.
Blaise clapped his hands happily and strolled past Draco into the kitchen. “So you’re having dinner here later, I assume? So what were you planning on cooking; French? Maybe, Italian? I am a bit of an expert in that particular area....”
The blonde ignored his lover’s concerned look and reached backwards to grope at his butt—looking down at Harry with a horrified expression as he did.
“We’ll go shopping tomorrow,” Harry promised, doing his best to try and soothe the put-out blonde. “I’m sure we can go back to whatever fancy-ass store it was that you got them from and order another pair.”
"....Change...my mind......?" Harry seemed confused at the wording, and repeated the question slowly.
“Um. Knightly, sir?” Draco’s quiet voice broke the heavy silence that had filled the room, and Florence looked happy that one of them had finally spoken up.
when upset, so Harry found it amusing to join in on the game as well—teasing the blonde despite his obviously pissed off attitude.
The four walked into the living room together and Ron begrudgingly stepped into the fireplace with Hermione—still giving Draco a shifty look.
“Now,” Kingsley raised his wand and slowly began drawing a figure-eight over top of their connected arms. “Do you, Harry James Potter, swear to uphold to all of the terms written on your Auror contract—to do your best to keep yourself and your partner safe, and always do what is truly the right thing in any situation you may encounter while performing your duties as Auror?”
—" Harry continued with a slight cough once Ron had stopped choking and no longer looked like he was going spill his guts on the floor.
"It's alright, I expected as much. If you would've asked me 5 years ago to try Muggle food I would've looked at you like you were crazy......but I'm different now." The blonde replied seriously, matching both Hermione and Ron's looks with a confident one of his own.
Harry remained frozen as well, scared of the reactions of his two friends. Before he could even bring himself to utter a single word however, he felt a pair of warm lips suddenly descend upon his own.
Draco took a careful gulp of the cool water before bringing the glass down and holding it with both hands. “Harry and I...we went on a mission together....” He made a face as he tried to recall what had happened. “We...started walking and we saw a Hippogriff....then a group of snatchers showed up....”
“Harry, you don’t have a scar from that wound now, do you?” Hermione piped up, her brows drawn down towards her eyes in deep concern.
Normally they were both above delivering lovey-dovey sticky sweet sentiments to each other—they both openly showed their affections, but usually in not so many words. The shock of having a full blown love confession delivered to Draco was enough for his heart to skip several beats, and he chose to respond by returning the hug—burying his face into his lover's neckline and breathing in his calming scent.
The leader sighed and shook his head. “Things can never be easy, can they?” He stared Draco down as he called back to his cronies, not taking his eyes off of the boy. “You lot take that creature back to headquarters—I’ll catch up with you.”
The waiter scowled slightly at the blonde before flashing Harry another smile. “No matter—I’d still love have a drink with you sometime~”
“Ah yes, now I have it...” He paused for dramatic affect to make sure he had captured everyone’s attention before continuing the story.
Florence felt a hand settle on his shoulder and he looked up in surprise to see none other the Minister of Magic himself—Kingsley Shacklebolt, standing in front of him.
finding this funny...." Harry grumbled back petulantly, ignoring the mischievous gleam in the blonde's grey eyes and staring hopelessly at the unconscious forms of his friends on the floor of their living room.
“Oi, back off,” Ron interjected menacingly, glaring down the Slytherin until he released his gaze with a chuckle.
“Knightly, you may be dismissed.” Kingsley turned to Harry. “Potter, you stay here. I’d like to have a word.”
It had been only hours earlier that he had been sitting in his office, anxious as can be as he wondered how Harry and Draco were doing. The mission that Florence had sent the two on was rated extremely low on the danger scale. In fact, Florence wasn’t even sure that the snatchers had been anywhere near the forest that he sent them to. The mission was meant more as a mock test of how well the two worked together. Even so, Florence had taken the precaution of specifically warning the two that they were not to engage if they spotted any trouble—and clearly that hadn’t happened. Who knew that, as fate might have it, the duo would happen to stumble across a band of those snatchers?
"Healer Davies," Kingsley's deep voice broke through Davies' silent pondering. "Do you have any idea what's going on that could have caused this?"
Draco turned around with another pout, stirring away at the pan on the stove in front of him—perhaps more vigorously than desired due to his put out mood.
Theo scowled and swatted Blaise’s hand before continuing. “Uh, Potter. Why don’t we start with you...”
“Well I wasn’t feeling as anxious earlier, but now...” His eyes swept back to the entrance of the cafe for the fourth time that minute as he strummed his fingers on the table restlessly. “I don’t know why I’m feeling this nervous now...”
After the initiation had finished and the formalities were over with, Kingsley had promptly ushered both Harry and Draco up to his office—where they now awkwardly sat while they waited for Kingsley to get on with their meeting.
“Because there are wards around Hogsmeade, Potter.” Draco explained impatiently. “It’s rare to not find a town protected by wards after the war now. At least it keeps people from apparating straight in.”
“Florence,” Kingsley’s deep voice called, and the Auror was by his side in a second—the pair following the nurse down a long, winding hallway.
Draco threw an incredulous look down at his lover—whom was sitting placidly on the couch- as he continued to pace and rant around their living room.
“Alright then—excellent job you two. I’ll expect an official report from the both of you, then we’ll file this down to the people in Intermagical Law to be taken care of once and for all,” He announced with a final nod, placing the parchment inside of a folder and sliding it into a drawer in his desk.
prat~” The Slytherin reminded haughtily. Harry gave a brief laugh and an assuring nod before said prat dipped his head down to join their lips.
The mischievous smirk playing on the Italian’s lips sent a jolt of unease through Harry’s spine, though he chose not to say anything.
This time Blaise lifted his head off of the back of the couch enough to turn his head and meet the blonde’s glare. “
” Kingsley stressed tiredly, shooting the boy a pleading look. Harry frowned and Draco quirked his lips.
Apparently that was the end of the conversation, so Draco heaved a begrudging sigh and exited the bathroom back into the living room. Blaise had a apparently figured out the basis of how to work the remote control, so he was back in his position on the couch watching the same Muggle cooking show that he had been preoccupied with before.
..." Harry scratched behind his ear uncomfortably. "I forgot to lower the wards before you guys came.....you were a bit earlier than I had expected...."
One of the nurses nodded and immediately swept through the doors, white robes billowing behind him in his haste.

It had been a week since Malfoy's conversation with Blaise and it didn't look as if he was on his way to approaching Harry, either.
He rushed into the Great Hall into his customary seat on the Slytherin table, narrowly missing the water balloon that Peeves had aimed his way. Blaise shot a smile at him from across him and Draco returned it begrudgingly.
Draco took one last look at the Gryffindors before he exited the Room of Requirement with the other Slytherins, making it a point to say,
, Harry mused. He didn't have to look at Ron to know that he was getting an entirely wrong idea about the relationship between Blaise and Hermione.
Neville, sitting on their table, was thoroughly absorbed in his favorite subject and didn't even look curious as to what they were talking about. Harry let the sound of Hermione answering his comment fade into the background, guiltily remembering Sirius's note that he got two days ago that was still in his pocket. It wasn't that he hadn't checked it - he'd checked it one time too many. Just the fact that someone cared about him, someone that felt like a

Draco -' Harry could hear the rawness in Blaise's voice and for the first time, considered fleeing and not looking back. This wasn't something he needed to hear.
The thing was, Draco, logically, knew that the Dark Lord's ideology was wrong. Blaise, more than anyone else, had made him open his eyes to the fact that the world wasn't as black and white, as pure-bloods vs. mud-muggle-borns, that his family had made it seem.
There was an almost feverish glint to his father's eyes that Draco had never seen before, the byproduct of years of zeal and elitism finally coming to light.
They were taking way too much fun at Harry's crush on Charlie - and wasn't that mortifying, even fucking Charlie had noticed, enough to say,
'If anyone can do it, it's you,' Ron broke in before Harry could put his foot in his mouth any further than he already had.
Breakfast was, unsurprisingly, chaotic, although Mrs. Weasley's meals were as great as usual, which Harry didn't fail to mention.

looking chipper today,' was the mirror's greeting as it looked at Harry's disgruntled face. Harry glowered. 'Fuck off,' he said, mouth full of toothpaste.
Harry was grateful for all the friends he's made, yes, but he sometimes couldn't help but think longingly of when he was a First-Year with stars in his eyes, only conscious of the new world that had welcomed him with open arms before he realized how conditional it was.
'Ooh does ickle Ronneikins have a crush on someone?' Ginny asked with a mischievous gleam in her eyes that reminded Harry of the twins for a moment. At that moment, he knew they were going to be friends for a
It took a while for them to clear their plates, Harry belatedly realizing that Mr. Weasley was missing from the table. Mrs. Weasley, noticing his unsubtle look at his customary chair, said, 'Oh, Arthur had to sort out some things for Mad-Eye - he probably won't be returning anytime soon.'
Mrs. Weasley had braved a muggle telephone to call for three Muggle taxis to take them to Kings Cross station, and Harry wasn't kidding when he said that it was the most uncomfortable taxi ride he'd had, with Crookshanks about to bite their legs any given moment, and Fred's trunk that shook every minute or so that the driver gave a wide birth to.
Hermione cleared her throat awkwardly. Pansy was the only one who looked genuinely unbothered. Harry
“Potter has a nasty wound on his chest and it’s not closing—we need to to bring him into the critical ward right now!”
” Hermione asked with a slightly puzzled look on her face before a flash of dawning crossed her face. “
“He’s....not,” The blonde replied somewhat defensively, though he wasn’t quite sure himself if he was lying or not.

Hermione said. 'It's far more likely that he'll only be allowed on the Task with just his wand - and I don't think he can manage a Disillusionment Charm, in, what...'
"Hate to break it to you Granger, but it really is me." The unmistakably cool and confident voice of Draco Malfoy quipped back—his lips curling into one of absolute delight as he finally turned around and faced his lover's two friends—though he stayed sitting on the floor between Harry's legs for emphasis.
“Sorry,” Harry muttered half-heartedly. “I saw that look in your eye though. You were either about to say something mean or dirty.”
"Oh, well why didn't ya say so!" Knightly rolled his eyes. "When Draco woke up before you came in he did tell us that he and Harry were both struck with a curse—but he said that it didn't seem to do anything."
Harry glanced down at himself with slight surprise. He hadn't even realized that the bandages were there until they were brought to attention. Harry gently felt the wound through the layers of carefully wrapped bandaging with his fingers. It didn't really hurt, surprisingly. He grimaced. "...It's fine...I think. But how did I get this?"
Kingsley nodded and continued. “With the verbal affirmation from the two candidates, I would now like to invite both Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy—as well as their mentor, Auror Florence Knightly, to come to the podium and sign the contracted Oath of the Aurors.”
Kingsley turned to Florence. “Senior Auror Knightly was tasked with the mentoring of both Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy. So to Auror Knightly I ask; do you recommend these individuals brought before me be initiated into the Department of Aurors?”
Kingsley moved around the side of Draco's bed to stand in front of the man, shaking his outstretched hand. "Likewise. And you are?"
"What the bloody hell, mate?? Tell us honestly! Why was Malfoy here, and what were you doing with him earlier?!" Ron roared angrily, his face matching the color of his hair.
—" Draco fastened a sleek silver watch around his wrist and walked back over to where Harry stood—still surveying his appearance in the mirror.
Harry gave an exasperated sigh and dropped his head forward onto the book that he had been reading in front of him. Though he knew he ought to feel some sort of remorse, Draco couldn’t help but take a moment to admire the way his lover’s ass looked when he laid in bed on his stomach like that. And combined with the fact that he’s still only wearing boxers......
"Alright, I'll start applying the wound—so let me know if anything changes," Davies said, glancing at each of three other members. With a nod from Blackwell, Davies slowly squeezed the dropper. Like before, several drops of the the high-strength healing topical splashed onto Harry's wound. Almost immediately, the wound seized up and began to cauterize where the liquid touched open skin. Davies applied several more drops when he heard a gasp from behind. He met Blackwell's astounded gaze.
As if on cue, the light tinkle of a bell was heard—and Harry gulped as he raised his eyes nervously to see who it was.
“Excellent job ma’boys. It’s well earned and deserved,” Florence congratulated, turning between the two and clapping them each on the back.
Hermione hesitated for a moment to see if Harry would bail her out, then opened her mouth with a nod. “Y-yes...Ronald and I are currently working in the Bureau of Intermagical Wizarding Law.”
Blaise chuckled and nodded in agreement. “I actually agreed with Theo on that one, but I didn’t bet any money on it.”
The jinx was uttered and Harry distantly recalled steeling himself for the jolt of pain as his eyes slipped closed and darkness consumed him—but not before he saw a flash of platinum blonde.
Kingsley chuckled. “The job of an Auror is often unpredictable—so even the best can quickly find themselves in an unfavorable position. This is one of the reasons why we always prefer Aurors to work in pairs...” He paused, as if mulling something over in his head, and Harry frowned slightly.
Draco smirked and took a long gulp of the strong alcohol, savoring in the searing heat that left in his throat as he swallowed it. “Well I can’t wait to see what it is~”
Harry shook his head and tried his best to keep with the capricious older man as Florence quickly strode through the bustling main floor of the Ministry, quickly navigating into the pristine gold elevators in the back.
Harry and Draco glanced at each other briefly before each placing a finger on the glowing object. Immediately their fingers were stuck to the object, and the room began to spin as the Portkey transported them.
"Custom-made? How'd you know my sizes? Why'd you buy me such an expensive jumper? And what made you pick green?" Harry called in question as he walked back over to his side of the closet and threw on an undershirt before slipping his arms into the soft, silky material of the green garment.
Once he reached a point where he could kiss no lower, he sunk down to the carpet—spreading Harry's legs apart and nestling securely between them—his body burning with lust.
"No, I know what you mean Ron. Harry, this is the first time that we've been to your apartment since you moved here—but I have the strange feeling like I've been here before......" Hermione added with a concerned gaze swept over the room.
The Minister glanced around the room, receiving nods of confirmation from those around him. “Now then—let us begin. As I call your name, please enter and stand before me.”
“Shh, Shh! Don’t move, Malfoy,” Harry suddenly hissed, squinting at something off to the side in the tree-line.
Harry nodded and passed the sheet of parchment back, frowning slightly. “That sounds brilliant...But no offense sir—what exactly does this have to do with
“You can let go of each other’s arms now,” Kingsley chuckled lowly as he turned back to Harry and Draco happily. “You two did well— I’m proud of you!”
Draco reached the top of the staircase with a fit of huffs—immediately turning into his and his lover’s bedroom.
there is to know about complex spells and such...” She trailed off seriously before continuing, and Harry saw Draco open his mouth with a gleeful smirk.
Draco grit his teeth in annoyance at letting them get away, but he knew full well that he wasn’t in any position to take on the full group of snatchers—especially with Harry unconscious on the ground. The fact that Harry hadn’t roused from his knock-out made Draco slightly more apprehensive of the power of the snatcher in front of him.
“What am I doing here? It’s Sunday, mate! I always come over and we watch the people in the muggle box on Sunday!” Blaise retorted indignantly, thankfully not catching on to anything strange yet as he perched himself on the arm of the nearest chair to the fireplace.
"I know this looks bad," Davies quickly interjected, seeing the appalled look on all of their faces, "but look here—this is part of the wound that's already been healed." He gestured to a thin silvery line that started in the middle of Harry's stomach where the wound was still bleeding. The silver mark continued down and disappeared underneath the sheets where the lower half of Harry's body remained covered.
“Do you both swear that Auror Knightly has trained you to the best of his potential, to become fully functioning members of the Department of Aurors?”
Kingsley nodded in understanding, quietly conjuring a quill and parchment to take notes as Draco continued.
“Mmmm, got it....,” The Gryffindor replied with a chuckle, reaching up to help the blonde out of his own T-shirt before their snogging resumed.
He flicked his wand and casted another non-verbal spell. Luckily, Draco had anticipated the movement and was able to deflect the spell with a quick
that happened over the course of the time we started working together at the Ministry, up until when we first started dating...”
Draco turned a slightly appalled look on his lover. “You invited them here without even telling them who was going to be here, and
Draco’s breathing stilled. He could feel Harry squirming against his reach, no doubt dying to run out and intervene—but they couldn’t risk it. They were complete newbies for one, and outnumbered two to one for another. Not to mention that there was no telling what that Hippogriff might do, or who it may attack if it regained consciousness.
“Wai—Hold on, Potter!” Draco hissed quickly when Harry took a daring step towards the Hippogriff. He reached out a hand to hold Harry back when he heard subsequent branches snapping. He snapped his head around anxiously towards the sounds before grabbing Harry roughly by the back of his robe.
Kingsley frowned. "While it's true that I am extremely worried for Mr. Potter's well being, Healer Davies, he is not the only reason that I am here." He paused and cast a meaningful glance towards Draco. "Mr. Malfoy was also injured, and I am concerned for both of them. I always visit St. Mungo's whenever any of my Aurors are injured."
but you really feel the same as me, is that it?” The blonde deadpanned with the quirk of an unimpressed brow—to which Harry sent his own pouting frown back.
“Ah, yes....I suppose we did,” Draco replied rather awkwardly, trying his best to restrain himself from grinding his throbbing hips downward. This was made even more difficult by Harry—who was quite aroused himself—moving his hands around to grip the blonde’s ass firmly and ever so slightly raising his hips up jut against the warm firmness of the Slytherin’s butt.
Theo scowled slightly, reaching into the pocket of his pants and fishing around before retrieving and pulling into view several golden disks—Galleons, Harry recognized after they came fully into view—and dropped them into the her hand. “I thought you had forgotten about that...”
That made Blaise’s jaw drop to the floor. He stood open-mouthed and gaped at the remorseless face of his best friend. “You......you.......YOU’VE BEEN DATING SOMEBODY AND YOU HAVEN’T TOLD ME?!?!?”
"That's just it Blackwell," Davies explained in exasperation. "He was doing fine—very well, in fact. Mr. Malfoy was as well. As soon as we tried to treat Mr. Potter's wounds though, the strangest thing happened."
“R-Ronald! That’s enough, alright?” Hermione cut in, placing a hand over his large fist and lowering it down as the color slowly faded from his face.
“As of now we don’t know where the snatchers’ route is, so part of your job today is to scope out this area and the ones adjacent to see if there are any signs of the snatchers, or evidence that they’ve been here,” Florence explained. “If you see the snatchers, do NOT engage. Send a Patronus message to the Auror office and we’ll meet you, got it?”
“I had come to bring you the paperwork you asked for Minister, but I didn’t realize you were busy...” Draco’s voice, though it had carried a slight teasing tone moments ago, now sounded oddly polite and subdued. Harry frowned. It wasn’t the tone of voice that he was used to hearing from the blonde.
The Slytherin flopped back onto the couch and gazed down at his friend still sprawled on the carpet. “Why are you only in your boxers?” He asked suddenly, raising a groomed eyebrow suspiciously.
"You can't keep it in, can you~?" Draco teased, kissing and nipping at the sensitive flesh of Harry's thighs as they quivered in arousal.
“Remind me again; why do we need to move the couch?” Draco asked in amusement—his lean body draped over a chair as he watched his lover survey their small living room with a critical eye.
“P-pleasure.” She responded nervously, and Blaise took that chance to bring her hand to his lips, gently kissing the back.
“When we got to the spot where they were at—Laimen forest—we found them both sprawled in the ground, unconscious....Harry had a pretty serious gash on his chest, and it wouldn’t close with any healing spells that we threw at it.”
The blonde ignored his dark haired lover beneath him and leaned onto the back of the couch, trying to make his sitting posture seem completely normal. Blaise was busy glancing around the room, and took no notice of his friend’s strange behavior.
“How about you just introduce yourself...tell us how long you’ve know either Harry or myself for...what your current occupation is..?” Draco offered with a dismissive wave of his hand.
“Ah, we sent them down to the Department of Muggle Artifacts to be checked over and restored to their former appearances. After that they should be able to be sent back to the Muggles that they were stolen from, right Potter?” Florence rattled off concisely, glancing at Harry for a nod of agreement.
Florence merely watched, knowing how hard Kingsley must be taking the fall of his two newest Aurors. He still blamed himself for the mission gone awry, and staring at Draco’s unconscious form now filled his stomach and chest with even more a sense of guilt and fear. He didn’t know what he was going to do if Draco and Harry weren’t alright. In his 20 some odd years of being an Auror, he himself had only been hospitalized twice—and his longtime partner Eddison once. The first time was actually due to a flub that his partner had made while they had been training together—a spell performed incorrectly which resulted in both of them being flung into walls. Concussed, they later found out when they awoke in St. Mungo’s some hours later. Thankfully there was little recovery time that resulted from that incident—though Florence swore his chronic headaches were a result of that experience. The second time he was sent to St. Mungo’s was after a rogue dark spell had hit him while he and his partner were rounding up a gang of snatchers. The recovery time for that particular incident had been a much longer and more painful process—as he suspected would be the case for Draco and Harry.
Harry smirked at his predictable boyfriend and retrieved his own wand off of the coffee table to assist in levitating and moving the couch.
"Just.....promise you'll tell us if he does anything bad to you." The redhead begged with a groan, scowling at the smirking face that Draco returned.
Draco, who has been watching the preparation for Harry's treatment with no small amount of smugness, had suddenly felt an indescribable pain in his chest, only seconds after Harry had started screaming. Kingsley immediately dropped to his knees and tried to calm Draco down as the boy screamed and writhed in pain on the bed. Kingsley glanced down at Draco to try and find the source of the pain when he saw something that made him freeze. Blood had started to dot through the thin fabric of Draco's hospital gown, staining the entire area of his chest a deep crimson red.
"We eat Chinese take out almost every Friday—it's kind of our thing to relax into the weekend with." Harry replied with a nonchalant shrug, while Hermione merely looked unsatisfied with the answer.
“Pansy and Theo.” Draco nodded, standing up from the table. “Shall I escort them in to our table of fun?”
“Huh? Oh, yeah...Ron and Hermione, and Ginny too...” The Gryffindor replied a bit tersely, and Draco nearly laughed at the irony.
After a moment, they separated—and Draco's face resumed it's normal cocky expression with smirking lips.
“I suppose, that makes sense...” Draco drifted off quietly, suddenly staring at the wall in deep thought.
“Aha, found it mate,” Draco announced quickly as Harry crept onto the first stair of the staircase and dashed up. “Like I said, between the cushions.”
Draco paled slightly and side-eyed Harry. The Gryffindor didn’t look any less nervous than Draco himself felt—but he wasn’t so sure if that was a consolation or not.
“Alright, I have some coffee here for you guys~ ” He stopped in front of the table with a smile. “So who do these go to~?”
Hey guys, hope you liked the first chapter! Here’s the second where a certain devilish Italian makes his appearance! Mwahaha~ If you like what you you read (or even if you don’t) feel free to leave a review~! :D
“Ah!—Oh....” The nurse’s expression went from star-struck to crestfallen in half a second. “Those poor boys....I believe they were sent directly to the critical ward....” She paused with troubled frown. “Hang on, I’ll check.”
Harry cringed at the similar phrasing to the words that he had been replaying in his head. “As much as I’d like to believe you...”
on the bottle's label. He willed his rapidly-increasing heart rate to slow down as memories of Hermione treating Ron's splinch wounds with a bottle of Dittany filtered into his mind. The sound of Ron's blood-curdling screams were filling his head and he could think of only one thing.
Harry's heart filled with emotion and he quickly strode over to his lover- embracing him and pouring all of his feelings into the hug.
is unexpected...,” The snatcher crooned as he deftly deflected the jinx aimed at him. Draco kept his wand raised, shifting closer until he was standing in front of Harry’s unconscious body—shielding him from the snatcher.
Blaise shrugged with an easy grin. “Why would I? He’s obviously happy—the happiest I’ve honestly ever seen him. I would give my blessing to him no matter who he chose to be with—so long as I’m sure that he’ll remain happy.”
"Ah there it is." Harry mumbled, finally spying his wand on the floor across the room and picking it up.
"It's custom made because I appreciate the finer things in life—like getting my clothes designed and fitted exactly as I like them. I picked one up for you and had it made sometime last week when I went to pick up an order." Draco responded as he threw on a black turtleneck and slipped a charcoal grey jumper of his own on top—hiking the sleeves up as he rummaged through his other shelves to find a suitable watch.
Draco scowled and pursed his lips in annoyance. “So I guess that means that you know we’re dating too?”
Hermione stared strangely at the bizarre behavior that the normally snarky and cruel blonde was displaying, but shook her head with a slight frown. People don't change that easily.
“Bloody hell, to think the day would come...” Harry mumbled under his breath with a disbelieving shake of his head.
is it, mate?” Ron questioned confusedly, staring his friend down with a suspicious expression. “Not that I particularly care about the entire story of how you and Malfoy...hooked up—but! This is the first time I’ve seen you try to be so secretive about something!”
Draco sighed and reached forward to take a sip of his coffee before drumming his fingers on the table thoughtfully. “Well, let’s see then—what did happen next? I suppose that after we finished our meeting with Kingsley...we each went our separate ways for the night—then we met up again at the Ministry the next morning. The ceremony was to take place in one of the hearing rooms in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement—with only a few people to serve as witnesses...”
Hermione actually quirked her head interestedly. “I’ll admit, even we haven’t heard this story yet Harry.”
The dark haired wizard felt his scowl start to cave at the pitiful look directed towards him— and he finally relented with a sigh.
"Well we've come a ways in our technology so now, while still difficult, it's not a death sentence if you're cursed with dark magic." Davies paused as he finished unwrapping the bandages, then carefully peeled away the dampened gauze to reveal an ugly red slash snaking from the top of Harry's shoulder, down to the middle of his stomach. The wound was weeping clear liquid with drops of scarlet blood glistening at the surface—it's was honestly kind of hard to look at.
Blaise couldn’t help the incredulous chuckle that escaped as he stared down the pair. “Yes, do enlighten us. What the bloody hell does that even mean?!”
“The first and last clause of every Auror contract is as I said before; vowing to protect your own life, as well as your partner’s life at any cost. Your lives are the most precious thing that you have—cherish them.”
Harry entered their bedroom and went straight to their enormous walk-in closet. Living with a Malfoy demanded closet space—and if it weren't for the undetectable extension charm that he had placed upon the closet after moving in, he had no doubt that Draco's clothes would take up the entire space on their own.
Harry stiffened beneath Draco and shot a glare up at the blonde—who ignored it in favor of keeping an eye on his friend.
“Either we move the couch, or there will be no shagging anywhere in this flat except for the bed.” Harry finally offered—shooting his blonde lover a look that would have made Voldemort shake in his boots.
At the boldly spoken declaration, Harry couldn't help the blush that stained his cheeks—both at the prospect of him going to Lucius Malfoy to ask for his son's hand in marriage, as well as at the notion of being called out on his threat. (Which was completely as Draco had stated.)
Draco grit his teeth together and tried to focus on what Kingsley was saying when he noticed the older man’s lips moving once again. He was finding it hard to concentrate and kept zoning out accidentally.
“Sit, Sit. There’s no need to be so nervous, Potter,” Kingsley’s deep, calming voice called out to the boy, and he sunk gingerly into the seat—still not daring to speak a word.
Hermione frowned slightly at hearing their conversation. “Harry, there are more people coming here?”
"Yes, indeed." Davies cast a glance over to Draco's bed and startled slightly in surprise. "Ah! Young Mr. Malfoy! Awake at last I see! That's good news—although I'm a bit surprised."
“And...” The dark skinned Slytherin drew out a long pause with an evil grin. “Theo laughed and said that he didn’t believe me, and Pansy said that she’d have to see it to believe it...”
“...We just thought it would be nice to...catch up,” He finally offered with another awkward brush of his fingers through his hair.
Draco huffed and shook his head. “There are some parts of our story that still to this day we don’t agree on.”
Harry shared a small smile with her at recalling their first encounter—while certainly not the best, it had definitely been impressionable.
“Ah, those three make bets with each other all the time—sometimes I join in...I have no clue what they were just betting on now though...” Draco replied with a quirked eyebrow in Blaise’s direction.
Davies pinched the dropper and the first few drops of the dittany splashed down onto the open wound. Though he had braced himself for it, nothing could have prepared Harry for the excruciating pain that the healing potion caused.
” Harry hissued angrily, barely able to restrain himself as Draco quickly put a hand over his mouth to silence him.
“Hurry up and go upstairs before he comes over here and sees you!” He whispered furiously to Harry, motioning to the staircase rapidly. Harry sent a loathing scowl to the blonde, but did as instructed—waiting until he was sure that Blaise’s gaze was occupied in a different direction, then crouching down and stealthily making his way to the staircase a few steps away.
Draco and Blaise continued to bicker back and forth, and soon Hermione began to converse quietly with Ron. Harry glanced around awkwardly at the lack of a conversational partner before he noticed a waiter walking towards their table, levitating several coffee cups in front of him.
“But telling them all would ruin the fun~” Blaise grinned evilly, sending a shiver down Harry’s spine.
look. Harry's glare cut through, and Draco relented with a sigh, turning back to the stove with a pout and a slight drop of his shoulders.
Harry relaxed into a smile at the sight of his lover looking much more relaxed than he had been earlier.
Harry reached for the closest object he could find—a harmless pair of socks—and hurled it at the smug blonde. He however, nimbly slunk out of the closet before real damage could ensue, and left the boy wonder to steam in the closet by himself.
“Don’t look so nervous, Potter,” Blaise consoled with a sympathetic grin. “Pans and Theo aren’t nearly as bad as you think they are.”
Harry knew he’d regret saying those words, and though they hadn’t yet been put to the test—he had the unnerving feeling that they were going to be.
Harry’s head spun at the rush of information, and he held a hand to his temple as he tried to process it all. “So basically...You and Mr. Knightly had us trained, and then conspired about making us partners...
“I won the wager on whether Draco was gay or not,” He reminded her with a devious smirk. “Didn’t you lose about 50 Galleons on that bet...?”
"Please do make yourself at home! If I'd have known you'd be dining with us tonight I'd have prepared something a bit simpler to suit your poor tastes." Draco quipped as Ron and Hermione took their seats at the table—both shooting Draco a glare to his back.
The appointed witch scrambled to the cupboard and retrieved two vials, running over to Harry as Davies ran to Draco. She quickly un-stoppered the vial and poured it down a still-thrashing Harry's mouth. She then grabbed the second vial and quickly went to Davies' side—passing it over to him.
Harry stared at the blonde with a frown. He realized that it was the first time he had actually been alone with Draco since their impromptu reunion the other day in Kingsley’s office.
As soon as he was sure they were alone, Draco released an agitated sigh and began pacing around, muttering angrily under his breath. “Bloody terrific...Hardly gave us any information, dumped us in the middle of a creepy forest, tells us to find evidence of a group of snatchers... “observe” the surroundings...”
Draco rolled his eyes and followed behind as Harry began walking through an opening of trees that seemed to have a decently tamped down walking trail.
Harry sighed and looked the garment over. As his lover had boasted, the jumper seemed to be of very high quality—the fabric felt soft against his fingers and it looked incredibly warm.
Draco obediently followed the command, wand at the ready as his grey eyes scanned the bushes rapidly.
Draco frowned deeply and opened his mouth to speak. However, Davies caught sight of the motion and immediately shushed him. "All in due time, Mr. Malfoy. Anyways, as I was saying—we had immediately started treating Mr. Potter's injuries because we were afraid of how much blood we were losing. His vital signs were also dropping quickly, so we knew that we had to seal up his wounds. Once we began working though, we realized that the wounds had been caused by dark magic—something that, while not impossible to heal, is extremely difficult."
“I was honestly hoping that that whole meeting was just a bad dream...” The redhead muttered sourly, throwing the smirking blonde a loathing look.
“Very good,” Kingsley nodded and pulled a new piece of parchment and laid it on top of the podium. “We will now begin the initiation of new Aurors into the Department. I would like to ask the mentor of each of these two to step forward. Auror Florence Knightly, if you please.”
“I can go first then, if you like,” Theo offered with a polite raise of his hand, earning a snicker from Blaise.
Harry, who had gone pale in shock, froze—eyes wide in disbelief as he met those of his closest friends. Draco, on the other hand, maintained his usual calm and cool exterior and made no move to remove himself from the extremely suggestive position he was in between the Gryffindor's legs—smirking gleefully at what he assumed were absolutely dumbstruck faces that the new visitors were pulling. Instead of turning around right away and revealing his identity, he remained facing the couch—shifting his gaze upwards to his lover.
Harry steeled himself again, but Blaise simply chuckled wryly. “I didn’t know that one for sure...but it’s what I guessed.” He turned and shot a slightly annoyed look to Draco. “I kept waiting for you to bring it up yourself, but you never did. So that’s why I’ve been trying to initiate it myself, but even then.....”
Blackwell's eyes widened slightly as a wave of understanding crossed over him. "If they were each hit with a dark curse, and that curse left dark magic in both of their bodies..."
“Because...,” The Gryffindor replied monotonously, tapping his finger on his lips in thought. “I will not accept another incident happening like last time....”
“Thank you, for the invitation...But you’re taken—isn’t that right, love?” Draco cut in suddenly, wrapping a possessive arm over Harry’s shoulders and staring the man down with a cool look in his piercing grey eyes. Hermione and Ron glanced up, and their eyes bulged once again at the Slytherin’s unabashed display of affection for their friend—while Blaise merely smirked in amusement.
Draco paused and his pale brows drew down toward his grey eyes in an uncertain frown. “Is there...anything else we should know before we go out on our mission...?”
Harry grimaced slightly. “Welll....that was kinda what I was saying earlier about some parts of our story....”
Harry finally stopped his tirade of questions and comebacks, and merely sat still—trying to take it all in. “So...when do we have to start working together...?” The question came out as a defeated mumble, and Kingsley merely chuckled lightly at the pouty attitude of the younger.
The voices stopped abruptly and the door was pushed open gently, revealing a menagerie of healers and nurses.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “You Gryffindorks...We don’t need to formulate a battle plan to decide how we should introduce ourselves...”
“Ah, Hey you guys...” He greeted awkwardly, walking up to the pair and running his fingers through his not-as-unkempt-as-usual hair (thanks to some intervention and hair products on his lover’s behalf).
Said Malfoy picked that exact moment to stalk into the closet behind the dark haired male, quirking an unamused brow at the cold shoulder that he was getting.
“Ah, you’re back. Took you long enough,” Blaise muttered petulantly before nodding his head enthusiastically in answer to the question. “Yeah, I think it’s a really funny show!”
“By all means, due enlighten everyone here Theo,” Blaise responded in a mock-serious voice, his amber eyes dancing in amusement. Draco jabbed him in the ribs to get him to stop, then nodded to Theo for him to start.
," Harry relented with a small huff—crossing his arms over his chest and finally giving the blonde a softer look. "But this whole thing will go a whole lot smoother if you just try to get along and not be such an arse."
Harry swallowed the lump in his throat and coughed discretely, catching the attention of the two Gryffindors.
"The analysis from the scan tells us for sure that the magic we're dealing with came from the same caster, and, most likely, came from the same spell. With that in mind, we can deduce that the magic inside each of them is one and the same."
“I don’t see any physical signs of injury, but Malfoy’s vitals are dropping—fast! We need to get him on that stabilizing potion and then send him to get a full-body scan to check for signs of internal injuries and traces of dark magic—immediately.”
Florence ignored Harry’s under the breath comment and turned to Draco with a gentle smile. “The best advice I can give you is to stick to your instincts. I know what both of you are capable of, and you’ll do just fine if you remember your training and work together!”
... Draco immediately quirked a brow. Though Harry didn’t look it, his forearms felt oddly firm and muscular.
'So, Harry,' Ron said. Harry turned around slowly towards him, not mistaking the teasing tone in his voice. 'How does it feel to have adopted a bunch of strays?'
a bad idea, actually,' Draco mused, causing Harry to look at him in astonishment at his very altruistic behaviour. It wasn't that Draco didn't want to help others, it was just that… when he had an advantage, he
Blaise, for once, appeared at a loss for words. A deep blush was edging up his face. Ron, realizing his mistake, paled, rose up from his chair, and practically fled the library as if a fearing for his life.
'It's the worst kept secret in Hogwarts,' Pansy dismissed. 'Oh, I know where Sathya is going with this - how about you bring it into the Task, and then take the egg and leave?'
Blaise smiled slightly at Draco as he sat down, and Draco inclined his head in return. Both Parkinson and Perera studiously ignored them, too wrapped up in their staring contest between Granger to pay any attention to him.

'My sister married a Muggle man and we refused to disown her,' Parkinson said flatly. The words hung in the air for a tense moment before Parkinson herself let go of her defensive position, sagging against her seat.
'Merlin helps me with Gryffindors and their foolish notions,' Draco muttered before sighing. He extended his hand. 'I accept.'
'That's not - not possible,' Harry licked his lips that had suddenly become very dry. 'Dumbledore - he wouldn't
you know,' Harry said, seeing Ron's face promptly go pink. Ever since that conversation in the library, Ron and Blaise had steadily grown closer with each other, but they were nothing more than friends. Yet. If Blaise and Ron's sickening looks at each other was any indication. 'You know nothing untoward is going to happen. Malfoy, though...'
'I don't think I'll be able to meet up much,' Draco said stiffly. He had stopped pacing, and was instead gazing miserably up at the ceiling, determinedly not making eye contact with any of them. 'Crabbe and Goyle's been suspicious of me ever since I told them to not follow me around
protective of everything they considered theirs. The Muggle myths about dragons and their treasure really weren't that far off.
'It's none of your business,' Harry muttered. They - Ron, Hermione, and Harry - had briefly explained what had happened at Hogsmeade to them; that Crouch was most definitely a Death Eater, but nothing else.
after all - but other than that, he wasn't even close to feeling the utter devotion that most of the male population and more than a few women were feeling.

Ron's shocked, surprised, and then embarrassed face was something they were all going to remember for a long time, Harry was sure.
'Oh I'm sorry,' Ginny rolled her eyes. Turning to Harry and Hermione, she said, sweetly: 'It's great to meet you! I've never met you guys in my life.'

that the Weasleys radiated every time it was time for them to get to the Hogwarts Express, but it always came as a surprise to him anyway.
He could feel the walls caving around him, realizing that the threat that the Dark Lord presented was
And try as he might, he couldn't stop thinking about Draco Malfoy - not the Draco Malfoy he saw in his third year, arrogant in his beliefs - the Malfoy he had seen in Voldemort's vision, if only for a moment; the face of someone who had thought what was right all their life had finally realized they were wrong all along.
'Meet up with me, Ron, Hermione, Pansy and Blaise,' Harry blurted before he could think better of it  'I don't ask you to be
Pansy rolled her eyes, tapped her wand against Hermione's bag, and whispered a quick spell. Hermione made a surprised noise in the back of her throat, making Harry and Zabini both look at her from where they were standing.
much money she had to give, and was just hoping for the best. The drivers, on the other hand, didn't even count their money before rushing away. It was at long last that Harry, Ron, and Hermione stepped into Platform Nine and Three Quarters, Harry feeling at peace for the first time in a long time as he looked at the steam engine that heralded his coming home.
'You mean about his brother?' Ron asked. 'But it isn't the same - ' Ron's eyes darted towards Parkinson before he sagged back, defeated. Hermione seemed to be facing the same dilemma, torn between hexing Parkinson and listening to what she had to say.

of questions, not to mention how the relationship between the two countries is shaky enough as it is.
Her words were drowned out by the abrupt opening of their carriage door to reveal one Pansy Parkinson, who wasn't flanked by Malfoy, for once. Her hair was bunched in a loose bun and, like Harry, she had chosen to forgo wearing her robes until the last moment. Harry couldn't help but think that Muggle clothing suited her, not managing to disguise his once over for what it was.
'What do you mean...' Harry started, then abruptly remembered a moment two days ago when Ginny had been about to say something about who she was interested in and then had broken off. 'Ah.'
'I can do a levitation spell too, you know,' Ron grumbled. 'It's not my fault Mom doesn't allow us to use magic here.'
Oh. Ron hadn't pressed Harry about Sirius's letter after he had seen Harry staring at it with a faint smile on his face for about ten minutes, and Harry had been incredibly grateful. But as a result, Harry had completely forgotten to actually
The creaking of someone rising from their chair was the only notice Harry got to slip away from pressing his face close to the door.
'When I said Dumbledore was incompetent...' Pansy started, halting her words as she saw the blood drain out of both Hermione and Harry's faces realizing someone they had both respected had let them down. Quite acutely, in fact. Ron didn't look much better.
'And I'm out, I get it,' Parkinson replied, rolling her eyes. 'Not that it matters since my family's considered blood-traitors anyway.'
' he whispered as they entered their tent, not surprised at the spaciousness and obvious wealth of everything in the tent, from the plush gray curtains to the comfortable yet expensive forest green furniture.

Blaise glared darkly over at Pansy. 'I thought you weren't ever going to tell anyone about this, Pans.'
'I'm in,' he said, surprised to hear it echoed by all the other Slytherins around him. And looking around their determined faces, for once, Draco felt as if things would be just fine.
from the entitled bastard he had been an year - hell, three months, ago. He just wished it was easier to believe. For others and himself.

' Granger said. 'Harry agreed to help both Pansy and Draco and - we need to figure out a plan that doesn't rely on dumb luck.'
Blaise was knocked abruptly backward by the Golden Trio, who apparently had the same idea as them and were running towards the forest. Because of
It was with renewed determination that Harry tried, in vain, to forget about Malfoy. The next day was filled with whispers about how the representatives from the other schools would arrive, and Harry, against his will, felt himself joining in on the excitement, sheepishly rearranging his uniform as they stood in line to wait for the delegations due to McGonagall's sharp look.
'Don't say I didn't warn you, though,' Draco muttered. 'You're supposed to have a meeting with the Headmaster of the school in your First year - he's supposed to explain it all.'
'Listen,' Ron hesitated. 'I know the Dursleys treated you horribly and expected you to do everything by yourself.'
'I don't know who you are talking about, Potter, but please. If they have a modicum of sense, listen to them. And listen to me too,' Parkinson added.
It was at long last that both Dumstrang and Beauxbatons arrived with cheer, apparently determined to outshine each other with their methods of transport. Harry, though awed at Beauxbatons' horse-drawn carriage and Durmstrang's ship, saw Hermione practically vibrating with excitement from the corner of his eye.
The tension in the air could be cut with a knife. Draco could only hear his own heavy, ragged breathing, feeling, with a sick sense of certainty, that his father was somehow behind this.
'Just… can we actually get Sirius freed this way?' Harry asked, hope making his throat almost clog with emotion.
someone about this?' Ron spoke up for the first time. 'I don't know about you, mate, but I really feel out of depth with this one.'
'We know that Voldemort's is living in the Malfoy Manor, and is planning to return at the end of June - we just need to figure out
'Moving away from Ron and Blaise being disgustingly cute,' Pansy could read minds, apparently. 'Care to tell us what's going on, Potter?'
Malfoy, to Harry's surprise, gave a bitter smile at that. 'Saint Potter,' he sneered. 'And I'm sure you wanting to help has a lot of conditions? Me spying for you? Risking my life-'
'It's not like there was anything else I could do,' Harry huffed, sinking back down into his chair in the Gryffindor common room. It was the day after the arrival of the other schools, and Harry hadn't had the heart to tell Hermione and Ron what had happened yesterday, with their obvious excitement over talking to Viktor and Blaise, respectively.
In the end, the awkward conversations were put to a halt as Draco made arrangements to stay at the Zabini Manor, uncaring of the fact that Blaise looked less than pleased as a result.
'That's great, Dobby!' Granger exclaimed. 'Haven't there been any other house-elves who want to do the same thing?'
as they heard the tell-tale sign of his father's aristocratic drawl and a thin, reedy voice he didn't recognize.
'Tell Mother I'll be there in five minutes,' Draco replied, trying to brace himself for the awkward silence that seemed to be a usual part of their dinner these days. His mother, still angry at his father for letting a madman into their house, though with nothing less than polite and subservient to the said madman.
'I hate you guys,' Ron grumbled, submitting himself to Mrs. Weasley's bone-crushing embrace, Harry and Hermione doing the same.
Harry quickly summarised what Sirius's letter had said, the weight that had descended on his shoulders lessening as he realized his friends were with him, no matter what. That he didn't have to face whatever was happening alone.
'He went to Malfoy Manor with Pettigrew and his pet snake… I think she was called Nagini? None of the Malfoys were expecting him, even

'Okay, that's it,' Blaise said abruptly from where he was seated next to Ron, who looked red-faced at the proximity. 'Care to explain what's going on, Potter? You've been twitchy as fuck ever since we left you at Hogsmeade.'
Harry felt a tired, hopeful smile, rise unbidden to his face along with a warmth in his chest that he, for once, embraced.
Perera was one of the only openly half-bloods in Slytherin - and for that alone, Draco would have considered her a simpleton.
wasn't sure what they would say about all this, but a small part of his mind whispered he should probably give them more credit - and joined in on the merriment, pulling himself back to earth with considerable effort. Everyone was too absorbed in their own conversations to notice his slip up - or were too polite to say anything about it - and Harry was grateful.
Harry,' Ron said absently, shoveling all his belongings into his suitcase as he always did. Harry, not having many belongings in the first place, only had the shirts and T-shirts he had worn while on his stay at the Weasleys' house to throw in, having done his homework in a fit of boredom in Privet Drive. 'Save the depressing thoughts for later.'
It was with a full stomach and a collection of new friends that Harry exited the Great Hall, even the prospect of the Age Line unable to put a damper on his mood. It wasn't as if he hadn't experienced danger before, though it would

'That's fine with us,' Granger, though from the looks of Potter and Weasley, they weren't as confident as her. Draco wondered absently where their Gryffindor bravado had disappeared. 'But first, I want you to sign this piece of parchment, just as a precaution.' She rummaged inside her bag and unearthed an obviously enchanted piece of parchment; most people couldn't recognize that it was a contract, but Draco saw the tell-tale gleam on its surface that normal parchments didn't contain.
Tired as he had felt two days ago when he had realized that the Dark Lord was in his house and there was nothing he could do about it.
Ginny, however, didn't appear offended. 'Might have been two months ago. Then I realized you were bent and I was more into Lu- someone else.' She plopped herself beside Hermione, apparently not in the mood to leave. Hermione, although surprised, just smiled awkwardly and made room for her.
But Draco was surprised to find that they didn't really affect him at all. He could see they were pretty - he had

making Harry want to sink through the floor and die - and the twins, the gits, had way too much time on their hands if the kissy faces they made at Harry every time Charlie was near was any indication.
Harry had always looked forward to September 1st, and this time it was no different. Hogwarts had always been his home, and the fact that he was returning to it at last always made him incredibly happy, more than anything else in the world.
Hermione got that determined glint in her eyes that Harry realized all too late that spelled trouble.
he thought unpleasantly, his mood only souring as he caught sight of the entirety of the Weasley family sitting on

'My lord,' his father said reverently, kneeling, seemingly uncaring of the fact that the Dark Lord looked a mere shadow of his old self, swathed in blankets, the still-red glint in his eyes the only reflection of his power. Narcissa wordlessly knelt down with him, subtly tugging a still frozen Draco down with her.
didn't go unnoticed by either of them. Harry had never, ever, regretted not accepting Malfoy's hand in their first year.
'I'm quite interested in your castle,' Krum commented, surveying the entirety of the Great Hall, Bulgarian accent thick in his voice.
Ron choked. Harry thumped him on the back sympathetically, even Hermione interrupting her conversation to glance at him. 'Oh, honestly,' she muttered, rolling her eyes, returning to her conversation in a flash.
Kingsley couldn't speak—he simply shook his head, unknowing. He strode to Harry's side. The nurses who had been previously restraining him had since retreated to entrance of the room—most likely to give them all privacy. The wound on Harry's chest still oozed and bled slightly. The end of the wound near his stomach appeared to have progressed another inch or so in healing—evident by the blood still dotted there but the lack of any open flesh. It appeared though that that was as far as Davies had gotten with applying the dittany potion.
, and expecting them to get along without trying to tear each other’s throats out...” He deadpanned with a dramatic wave of his hands for emphasis.
“Fine. But I swear, if I don’t get shagged tonight I’m gonna go crazy,” Draco complained as he flopped onto the couch with a huff.
As for Harry himself, things were going well. After his 20th birthday, he had soon found himself being trained, under Kingsley’s suggestion, to become an Auror. Kingsley had assigned a mentor to him, and ever since, Harry had been training hard underneath the supervision of Auror Florence Knightly—an older and slightly eccentric wizard, though Harry thought him quite charming (and found a great deal of likeness to Mr. Weasley in him).
