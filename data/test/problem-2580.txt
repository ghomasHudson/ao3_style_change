“Here comes Weasley.” Draco hissed and Hadrian looked up to see the youngest male Weasley headed their way.
After their hug, Dobby had removed the sheets from the chairs so they all could sit. Harry had nibbled on his bread, because his stomach was grumbling, now used to getting regular meals. Dobby began to tell him more about himself and his parents. He learned his mother had died in childbirth. He had been born here at the townhouse, but his father did not like staying in it for too long because of all the memories of his mother. He learned his father died in a hunter accident when he was four. Though he had finished most of his breakfast, he had lost his appetite when he learned the horrible truth: the Baroness was his aunt, charged with taking care of the estate and him.

“Well you can’t refuse because that would look suspicious so all I can say is don’t eat or drink anything he offers.” Draco said softly taking out their Potions textbook, “Until then help me with my homework because Professor Snape may be my godfather but that doesn’t mean he’ll lay off me.”
Hermione and Dr. Snape stood up quickly. They both were eager to see Harlan. Hermione knew her reasons, but she was curious as to the other man’s. It is one thing to abstractly be concerned about an acquaintance, but that is completely different from being concerned for someone with whom you share a deeper connection. She felt the later of the two, and from what she could see, that was the same for Dr. Snape. She would greatly want to know why.
A Special World

The merpeople in this fic are not the mermaids from
Vernon Dursley looked horrid. He was filthy, and his eyes, even from the distance, were vacant. Haunted. That could be because Petunia’s sentence was carried out the day before. Right in front of his cell. Duc Zabini calmly watched as two guards held her down, another forced her mouth open; the last held a knife in the flames of a torch mounted to the wall. Her husband kept shouting, pleading and sobbing, as the metal began to glow. Finally, when the blade was practically white, Petunia’s tongue was cut out of her mouth, the wound cauterizing instantly. Duc Zabini looked down at the writhing woman indifferently, holding the end of his cane into the flames. After a moment, he removed it and placed it against the woman’s neck, branding her with the Zabini crest. Vernon was a blubbering mess as Petunia’s unconscious form was carried away.
Your beautiful face,
Granger made a noise of sympathy and concern. “That’s horrible,” she said, “But everything will be fine. Felidae has highly advanced medical practices.”
Harry hummed, tilting his head slightly. Maybe some leniency was in order. His
Severus sighed, looking down. He seemed more uncomfortable, and very sad. “I did not have much standing there, and it kept me in the palace,” he finally answered. It looked like the man was trying to gather his thoughts, working on how to words something. “I was … with … Sirius, the Crown Prince.” He rubbed his hands across his face again. “As in, we were in a relationship. For twenty-nine years.”
“Hello Lucius.” He turned and saw the boy standing beside his once lover, “This must be Draco. It’s a pleasure to meet you, this is my son Hadrian.” Cas said smiling. The boy still looked nervously at him but when he looked at Hadrian the look changed to curiosity
The other man smiled back, but he looked off. Tired. Beaten down, more so than before. Draco could have sworn he saw the man wove a little bit as he walked, but passed that thought off as his overactive, protective imagination. He walked forward to embrace the servant. Comte, he corrected in his mind. That was going to be a fun conversation. But food first; that would hopefully soften the blow.

It took the rest of the year for Harry to come to terms with his sexuality. During his fifth year, he explored that sexuality. In that time, Harry also learned that he liked to wear women’s clothing. Originally, it was a dare late at night in the Slytherin common room for Harry to put on a girl’s uniform. From that moment on, Harry knew that he wanted to dress like a woman. So, before the start of his sixth year, Hermione and Pansy gave Harry a makeover.
Hadrian made his way to the gargoyle that marked the entrance to the headmaster’s office.
Harry slowly blinked his eyes open. He stared up at the ceiling. It was not familiar. It was way more extravagant and gilded than anything he had ever seen. He started to panic. Where was he?
Draco glanced at the gardens, situated right next to the manor. From the window, he could see the rose gardens. They were arranged by four sections in a square, each side a different color. In the center of the square was a fountain. A very beautiful fountain. It was of a mother unicorn with her foal, both of them drinking from the gurgling spring. Mother sat on the edge of the fountain, dripping her fingers in the water and staring blankly at the roses.
that pulled around her, her hair pulled into an elaborate hairstyle with her crown resting atop. She glanced over to Draco and smirked slightly; she was just as excited to justice served. Apparently, Baroness Dursley had been unbearable before she was married, being snide and rude, and his mother was eager to knock her off her high horse.
“I know, Hermione, I know. I’m sorry,” Draco answered. He only ever used his friend’s first name in serious and emotional situations; this one was both of those. “But I couldn’t not go. This was for Sirius, the only member of my family I actually liked.” Draco looked up to meet the Felidaen’s eyes.
While it was a shock, to realize someone had been murdered so close to campus, Harry did not feel that affected. Besides that one class, Harry never interacted with the man. He was not sadden by his death. Mostly, he was just unnerved that it happened and that the police did not have any solid leads. Oh well. Harry still lived on campus, as a Resident Director. He felt safe there.
Severus stood up as well, glancing between the two men. “There’s a secret passage,” he said as he layed his hand on a large knot in the bark of the tree. Behind the trunk, a section of wall slid away to reveal a set of stairs leading down. “Sirius found these passageways when he was a child. They’ve been forgotten, but they were built as siege tunnels when the Palace was rebuilt during Čarobnjačkom’s last large-scale war.”
Draco stood up and walked quickly to the other man. He lifted a hand up, fingers almost touching the purpled skin, but he held back. It angered him. Someone had dared to touch the man. To hurt him. To mar his perfect olive skin. He wanted justice.
Draco breathed deeply, concentrating on steering even though it was not necessary. The ship was on autopilot after all. But … he needed to do something. Anything. To keep his mind busy. To keep it away from thoughts of the man lying unconscious in the makeshift bed in the ships small cargo area.
Severus gave Draco a familiar look that said the man was questioning Draco’s intelligence. “The headscarf,” Severus answered, “It was covering the Prljavštine Osoba markings.” With that said, the man left for the cargo hold, leaving Draco alone with his thoughts and the stars.
Harry frowned. “No, they’ve lived here as long as I can remember,” he said, “And there is no staff, other than me.” He looked down at his lap, cheeks colored in embarrassment. “There used to be others, but with money being short, they had to let all the others go. I wasn’t, because they essentially own me.” He shrugged his shoulders. “I’m an orphan with nowhere else to go.”
There was silence, then the quick pattering of feet. The door suddenly opened and a little body slammed into him. “Draco,” his little sister crooned, “You’re back. I’d thought you had left. Left me here. Alone.”
And thus, they began. Swords swung, clanking and flashing in the sunlight. It was exhilarating. No one fought her like Draco did. The other nobles had these hang-ups about dueling with the royal heirs. Especially her, the princess. Draco faced the some of the problems, but not to the same extent. He was a man, while she was a lady. A
I know it's short, but it had to be that way. That's how it panned out in my outline. The next one should be longer.
Also, as a side note, apart from my two one-shots, this is the first fic that I've actually completed!! (which is actually rather sad since I've been writing for over 8 years, maybe longer)
Harry huffed, standing back up. “Well, that was embarrassing,” he said as he brushed the dust from his leather pants.
Draco was wary of love. All it did was hurt, leaving large, gaping holes in his heart. He loved his brother in all but blood, and he never really got over the pain of losing him. He loved his father, and the man’s death haunted him even if his spirit does not. He had felt like he was slowly and steadily falling for Lucas, but the man had been violently ripped from him before he could know for sure.
“Don’t worry Hadrian. I’m sure they will be fine.” Draco said softly, putting a hand on Hadrian’s shoulder.
He was sitting amongst the rocks, partially hidden from view, but he had a clear view of the ocean. Everything was calm. The waves softly broke near the opening, settling as the water continued inward. He closed his eyes and just listened. Breathed. A splash echoed across the empty cove, followed by the sound of something settling in on the rocks.
My love for you is still true
At the moment, the group reached the throne room, stopping before the ornately carved oak doors. The servant knocked twice, and the doors opened inward. Again, no announcement. Nothing at all. Holding her head high, Petunia took her husband’s arm and walked into the room full of courtiers, her son following just at her shoulder.
“Because most wizards are close minded. Don’t worry, I’m sure Toto will miss you as much as you will miss him.” Cas said leaving the bathroom, “Now go get ready. We’re going to London.”
Draco smiled, sitting up. “Yes, indeed, Harry,” he called. He frowned as the other man walked to them. The dappled light was playing kicks on his face, making a dark spot over his eye. As Harry walked closer to them, Draco saw the truth: there was a dark spot on the man’s eye. Harry had a black eye.
Sorry about the long wait, but here is the next chapter!!
Hadrian was sitting by the great lake reading a book on how to become an Animagus when a third year came up to him.
"Theo, um, Theodore Nott. A pleasure to meet you, Heir Mort." The boy said hesitantly but he didn't drop Hadrian's hand as they climbed into the boat.
Draco tilted his head as he studied the black haired beauty. “
There were a couple drivers on that side, away from Justin and his lackeys. It was mostly the older, senior drivers, like Crouch, Bagman, and Kingsley. Of the men, only Kingsley Shacklebolt was a threat to him in this race. The black man looked to be about Draco’s father’s age; he had been racing, and winning, for twelve years. His car was dark blue; his sponsor was Lowe’s. The man was tied in points with Draco, and as much as it pained him, Justin was tied with them as well.
He surfaced from his musing, realizing he had been lost in memories for a great deal of time. A quick
Fudge took that moment to take command of the conversation again. “Pleasure to meet you, my boy,” he said, shaking Haydrien’s hand, “I want to introduce you to someone. Maybe you can help me.”
” he said as the English students settled at the table next to theirs, “
~ My mother had open-heart surgery
Also, Harry had his parents all through his childhood. However, they were killed in a car crash the summer after Harry’s second year. They were on a trip as a family when a truck ran them off the road and into a tree filled ditch. Harry was the only survivor. As per Lily and James’ will, Sirius Black was appointed the boy’s guardian. So, Harry James Potter became Harry James Black, when Sirius adopted him and made him the heir to the Black family besides the heir to the Potter family. Thus, Harry never met the Dursleys, the family Lily wished she did not have.
Draco chuckled humorlessly. The man swiveled his chair to face Harry, propping his feet up against the console. “Then get comfortable, my Jedi friend,” he said, with a smirk, “because this will take a while.”

Well, that was … surprising. Draco knew of the jealousy between the sisters, but that had apparently grown into intense hatred. So intense, that she took it out on a defenseless child. Well, that cemented her fate. The Baron’s fate had been sealed as Draco looked after Harry while the man healed from his wounds. Now, it was the young Baron’s turn to face judgment.
The other man shrugged off the words, wiping at his eyes. “Draconis came to the funeral, regardless of the danger to him, with Harlan as his Jedi protector,” he said, “And after the funeral and coronation, there was an assassination attempt. We slipped through the siege tunnels, and Harlan held the attackers off as we prepped the ship for takeoff. We all got out of there, but Harlan had apparently been hit.”
As a forewarning, the next chapter will take me a while, because I haven't planned it out yet. This chapter was long and took forever, but I had already mostly planned it out while I was writing the first part. Sorry guys.
~ I was involved in a car accident. I wasn't injured, but my car was totaled (old car + wheel-well damage = totaled based on cost)
Remus chuckled, ruffling Harry’s shoulder length hair. “May the force be with you, Harry,” he said before heading off to the Records. Harry started walking towards the Council Chamber with a small smile of his face. Remus only rarely used his nickname, and Harry cherished every instance.
” he said, reigning in his urge to glare at his father, “I was just curious on the matter.”
Sorry about the wait ... don't hate me, please?
An hour later, they heard leaves scrunching as someone approached. “Back again?” a voice called out.
The other man’s eyes widened as he looked inside the pouch. If Draco would hazard a guess, he would say the man had never seen that much money before in his life. “But sir,” he started, looking at Draco with bright emerald eyes.
You are my dragon
Severus then stood up. “Speaking of the Knight, I should go check on his condition.”
was a jerk and an idiot, but that should not warrant a harsh punishment. Not like the Baron and Baroness. He nodded to Draco, waving his hand down to communicate to lessen Dudley’s sentence. The blond nodded, understanding.

Draco sighed dramatically, snapping his book closed and draping himself over Hadrian. “I’m so bored,” he whined, his eyes darting to the bookshelves and back, “Why don’t we go somewhere more comfortable?”
The only other person in the waiting room was a man. An unknown. Well, obviously, Draco knew the man, since he had come off the blond’s ship behind the medical team. He had walked with them to the hospital and up to the waiting room. He then sat in that chair, and had not moved. At all. The man just sat there, silently, holding a Jedi cloak and lightsaber. She assumed those were Harlan’s. Who was the man? And why was he there?
“So,” the Healer started, “Introductions first. My name is Cormac McLaggen. I am the assistant director of the Trauma unit.” He glanced at her.
That was the start of our tentative friendship … later relationship. Our first date was to a muggle movie: a silly, epic drama about pirates. For it being something muggle, the evening was quite enjoyable. Our first kiss was during a romantic picnic on the hills overlooking Loch Ness. Our first intimate endeavor was on a beach in Iceland. He proposed on the top of the Eiffel Tower (after insisting that we take the stairs to the top). We were married on the shores of the Black Lake on the Hogwarts' grounds, with our friends and family all gathered around. One year after the wedding, we adopted a beautiful baby girl and named her Laetitia Siria Potter-Malfoy. In total, we have been together for 5 years.

Draco brought the ship down gently. The ship jostled only slightly as the landing gear made contact with the pad. He turned to look at Severus, grinning smugly. “Perfect,” he declared.
And, I think I finally have the number of chapters left figured out! It's seven, though I don't know how long each of those will be. I'm not going to change the number of chapters in the story description just yet, because the number could be subject to change (I could add more, but I'm 89% sure I won't remove any). There will be some time jumps, but I will announce them at the beginning of the chapter when they happen.
had the audacity to run away. Her hands clenched, almost wrinkling the material of the hat. When they found him, his last whipping will be nothing compared to what he will get then.
“Come to my office after dinner. I like sherbet lemons.” With a sigh, he folded the piece of paper up and set it on fire. The old man wanted to drug him already. It wasn’t surprising, after all it would seem less suspicious if he broke off his friendship with Draco and became friends with the Weasley boy at the beginning of the school year rather than further in.
Draco nodded, becoming more impressed with the Knight Harry grew to be. He frowned after a moment. “Sev, why did you call him ‘Wolfe’?” Draco asked, “It’s Harry.”
“Come on,” he said, pulling gently on the other man’s hand, “There’s something you have to see.”

In regards to Petunia's punishment:
The man frowned. “No,” he stated, looking wary.
Bringing himself back to the present, Draco pulled out a set of clothes from his drawer, an older set that were a bit too tight on him, and brought them to the bed. He sat on the edge of it, gently running his fingers through Harry’s raven hair. “Come on, time to get out,” he said, “We’re going out.”
. That sealed Lily’s fate, and further testing sealed James’. James was executed immediately, and Lily was executed five months later after giving birth to a healthy baby boy. Sirius had tried to keep the baby, the last part of his best friend left, but he had been whisked away, already lost in the system.
She smiled at the man. “Did I wake you, Remus?”
Harry nodded, sitting down. Draco joined him. He reached into the basket and began to serve them. It was really nice, but what he needed to tell the other man was eating away at him. Draco distracted himself by looking at the other man.
Cas looked over the list of supplies that was required for young Hadrian’s first year at Hogwarts.
Dear Readers,
“Are you sure? Tell me everything.” He demanded and She took a deep breath before relaying everything she had heard.
He still had moments where he could not believe it. That he was a Comte. That all that land was his by birthright. He scowled. That the Baroness was his aunt. That she had treated her one flesh and blood like that. He took a deep breath to calm himself down. She, and the Baron, and the young Baron would get what was coming to them. Draco had promised that they would stand for their crimes, all of their crimes, and face the dire consequences.
Severus sighed, rubbing his hands over his face. “There is a blaster burn up the entire left side of his torso,” the man began explaining, “It probably happened during a spin. Jedis favor those in their fighting styles, since it gives their sabers more momentum and maneuverability. However, it also creates more vulnerability when facing advisories from multiple directions.” Severus shook his head. “I kept saying it was a stupid move.” Severus caught himself, getting back on topic. “The burn is deep. I’m very surprised Wolfe managed to get in the ship before collapsing.”
* ~ . X . ~ *
Draco snorted, picking up an apple. “No, Bumble-Bee, I was busy with my agent,” he replied nonchalantly, smirking at the vein that throbbed on Justin’s forehead at the nickname. How the man could still feel so superior when driving a car decorated with a large bee baffled him. “But don’t worry, I’ll still find time to beat you,” he said with a wink. He wandered to the other side of the pavilion before the man could come up with a retort.
“I want a foot on how intent falls into play with Transfiguration.” McGonagall said above the noise.
Trying not to panic, Draco laid the other man across his saddle. He untied the stallion and climbed up into the saddle, settling behind Harry to hold him in place. Taking the reins, he kneed his horse into motion. He would take the other man back to castle. There, he would get treatment and finally learn the truth about himself.
Dieu, that man was an idiot. “About the Comte Potter?” Draco prompted.
The pair walked to the bay door. Draco glanced to the side, to where the Knight was laid out. Severus had cleaned the blood away, his
The ritual also requires two necromancers; Hadrian will have to participate. Cas grimaced at that. He would rather his son not be involved, but there was no other option. The ritual would take place on Midsummer’s Night, which was just a couple weeks after his son would return from Hogwarts.
Was Draco … flirting with him? Harry could hardly believe it, but all signs pointed that way. He fought hard not to blush. He knew he failed when he saw the blond smirk in his direction. The ship touched down, leaving no time for Harry to respond.
When he was sixteen, right before he left for Coruscant to be Čarobnjačkom’s senator, Sirius told Draco about his best friend, James. James had fallen in love with a healer’s assistant. A Prljavštine Osoba named Lily. They had kept their relationship a secret, and everything was great. Until it wasn’t anymore. Though they had been careful, Lily was pregnant. She hid the pregnancy as long as she could, but it was discovered. The baby was tested and found to be
Draco nodded, bringing his mind back to the current conversation. “Time changes everything,” he replied, “Especially people.”
, Lord Malfoy,” he replied, amusement clear in his voice.
Haydrien breathed deeply as the portkey landed. His family had a private portkey, so it was just the four of them: Ui Luc, Uika Cissa, Uiets Draco, and himself. Of course, only amongst family would those names be used. They were elite Purebloods, after all. Certain levels of decorum were expected. Like not sprawling on the ground after a portkey. All around them, other portkeys were arriving, and most of the people ended up on the ground. Haydrien sneered down at them.
“We need to go,” he said, a fierce stubborn glint in his emerald eyes, “I just destroyed an assassin droid. There could be more. I need to get you back to Coruscant, where you’ll be safe.”
“You know we would have never worked out.” Lucius said softly so they would not be overheard.
Shining with an inner glow,
Lord Malfoy briefly wrinkled his nose in distaste before dismissing the news. “Come,” the man commanded as he turned his back to them, “The funeral will begin shortly.”
The next chapters will have time jumps in them =)
Draco’s anger boiled again. It was infuriating, how little the other man thought of himself. He had been so conditioned, by the Dursleys, that he accepted his horrible treatment like it was commonplace practice. The information he gained about the Dursleys came second to the insight to the man sitting there in front of him.
I’m sorry if any of the Russian terms is used incorrectly. I decided to use archaic Russian family terms, because I feel like that would be something Russian Purebloods would do: hold to the older versions of the language to expression their superiority.
Draco managed to get Harry sitting down on the blanket, and Lyra pulled the food out of the bag. The three ate in silence, relaxing in the shade of the trees. Once the food was gone, Lyra looked at Draco and nodded meaningfully at Harry. Draco sighed again.
As he walked through campus, slipping his coffee, he thought back to Draco. He had not seen the blond since that day in the coffee shop, but he was still optimistic. He had gone a long time without crossing paths with the man before. Four days was nothing compared to that.
Oops. This one is nearly five times the length ... *shrug* oh well, that's how it worked out according to my outline for this story.
“So, Harry,” he said, hating himself to dragging this all up, “You said you worked for the Dursleys? Said this was their land?”
On that day, the garden no longer contained white roses. On that day, Draco bewitched the white rose bushes to bloom black flowers. On that day, Draco decided to shield his heart from love because love hurt too much.

After dragging Lyra from her books, the pair made their way to the family dining room. They stood by their chairs and waited patiently for their parents to arrive. After only a couple of minutes, King Lucius and Queen Narcissa entered. Then, they all sat.
Severus sighed. “Of course that is not satisfactory for you, you curious Knight,” the man said fondly, “Give me a second to gather my thoughts, and I’ll start at the beginning.”

“Are you a necromancer too?” He said in a hushed voice and his father swatted his shoulder
“Oh, move over,” Lyra whined, bumping him out of the way with her hip. She pulls a couple of pins out of her hair and stuck them into the lock. A short while later, the lock clicked and Lyra pushed the door open the door. She smirked at Draco’s dumbfounded expression and entered the house. Draco was hot on her heals.
Harry blushed bright red. “Thank you,” he murmured as he hugged the man again. He pulled back after a few moments, a cheeky grin on his no longer blushing face. “Well, best not to keep the Council waiting.”

Remus’ breath caught as his eyes landed on the bed. Harry looked so broken. So still. So unnatural. The younger man was always in some form of motion. Even with all the training, he still retained some of his nerve ticks. More than a year of abuse would do that to a person.
There are different types of merpeople. There are merpeople with tails like those of tropical fish. They are peaceful and not prone to violent confrontations. The scales of their tales are bright and warm colors, like yellows, oranges, bright green, white, etc. There are merpeople with tails of carnivorous fish, like tuna, sharks, orca whales, etc. These merpeople are very warrior-like. If they have scales, they are dark, cool colors. There are also merpeople with magic. They either have jellyfish tails or octopus tentacles. These are solitary people; no more than three live together at any given time while pods generally consisted of twenty or thirty. Ones with jellyfish tails deal in Light Magic; ones with octopus tentacles deal in Dark Magic, and some dabble deeper into the Evil Arts.
The man kept surprising Hermione. That he could rattle off those herbs’ stats off the top of his head like that … Impressive. Extremely impressive. Especially since the man was not a medical professional. Doctorate in biology notwithstanding. Ovinnik, but she was flustered. Brains had always been attractive to her; she wanted someone who could keep up with her intellectually. And, Dr. Snape was not horrible looking, very distinguished. She mentally shook her head, unnerved with her own thoughts. Besides probably being twice her age, the man was grieving. And, her friend was unconscious due to injuries from a fire-fight.
Draco straightened, his grief reigned in behind a mask of indifference. The blond walked back over to Harry to stand shoulder to shoulder as they waited for the group to reach them.
Draco saw movement out of the corner of his eye and looked back at the people gathered on the pad. Granger had stepped forward. Well, given how her skirt still flowed around her legs, it seemed more likely that she tried to rush forward, and her bodyguard’s hand on her shoulder was the only thing that stopped her. The ginger leaned down to murmur something to her. Granger did not look happy, what with how her tail was flicking quickly and with her ears flat to her head. But she stayed put. Draco narrowed his eyes at their strange behaviors. He was distracted from those thoughts by the medical team reaching the ship.
Remus’ chuckle died in his throat at those words, and he immediately sobered. “What happened?”
Shacklebolt sighed, glancing at the other people in the room: the other senators pushing for the anti-slavery bill and a representative from the Jedi Council. “I cannot allow that, Senator Malfoy,” he said regretfully, “Because you are spearheading the anti-slavery bill, it is in your best interest to not go back to Čarobnjačkom. The political unrest of the panet makes you a target.”
“Potter? How am I supposed to know?” his father answered, leaning back in his chair, “There are too many courtiers to keep track.” The man waved his hand dismissively. “What does it matter, anyway? One courtier, either way. There are so many to choose from. Just pick a different one.”
“I see you still have Bartholomew. And I’m guessing the little black one is Hadrian’s.” His father’s voice drew him to see the two undead wolves that were laying on a pile of blankets in the corner. One looked older, it had thick silver fur, blind eyes, and just had a feeling of a well-loved toy. The other was a polar opposite. It seemed to be a young wolf pup with black fur and from the way it wiggled it had the energy of a puppy.
A special world for you and me
Glancing to his left, Draco could see Harry, who was scratching his neck. Draco bit his lip to stop from laughing at his love. While it was amusing how uncomfortable Harry was in the formal attire, now was not the proper time. Glancing to his right, Draco smirked at Lyra. She looked thoroughly annoyed as she cooled herself with an ornate fan. She was not happy to be out there. Firstly, she was required to be out there with him and Harry, in the awful heat. Secondly, their mother had forced Lyra into
“It is. Come by later, say after supper. Bring Draco, I’m sure Hadrian would love to show him Toto and the other undead animals we have.” At that moment Hadrian was called up to the little platform to be measured and Cas went to join him.
The Jedi stood there, robe billowing in the wind. Draco could barely see the other’s face with the hood up against the cold. Light and shadows played over the Knight’s features.
“You’re a menace,” he griped as he turned back to the stars out the front window, “And what did you mean by that? What you said …”
Remus lifted an eyebrow at the other man. That was very much over simplified. He wanted a more in-depth answer, because the man’s reason just lead to more questions.
Draco smiled and stood up. “I love coming here. Seeing you,” he said as he dug through his saddle bags for the records the old servant from the townhouse gave him, “There’s something I need to tell you.” He paused for a second, gathering his thoughts. “Remember what Lyra and I asked you about? About the Dursley’s? It has to do with that. Somewhat.”
Draco laughed maliciously. “Well, of course, he is family, after all,” he drawled. If possibly, the boy looked even more horrified. The twins laughed at their brothers’ distress, and even the little girl looked amused.
The intercom buzzed, breaking Draco’s musings. He answered, “Yes, Severus?”
Finally, he reached his throne and sunk into it with a bored air about him. He blankly stared at the Baron and Baroness, gleeful as they squirmed under his scrutiny. Then, he smirked evilly at them, which seemed to upset them all the more. This would be fun.
Harry nodded, settling down in his seat. He wrapped himself up in his robe, feeling chilled. Space was cold, but he was pretty sure it was memories from his childhood, of running around without a shirt all year, that made him cold at the moment. Memories he had repressed were resurfacing, proving to Harry just how not ready he was to go back to Čarobnjačkom.
Time seems to past slowly. Its 9:45 … 9:50 … 9:55 … With each passing minute, my heart painfully contracts and I start to panic.
Draco glanced to the side at Severus. “Everything ready?” he asked, “Is he secured?”
After a moment, he glanced up and saw the older man mirroring him. “I pozdrav za vas,” he said, “Jedi …” He trailed off, glancing up at Harry in question.
Without addressing them, Draco began. It was a power play, to accentuate how little the court thought of them. That had made Harry smile when Draco had told him about the plan. “You were summoned here to stand trial,” Draco announced. The Dursleys all pale.
Albus Dumbledore sat at an outside table at Fortescue's watching as the dark-haired boy said goodbye to Draco Malfoy. Beside him was the elusive Lord Mort, a tall, wiry man with wine red hair and, Dumbledore knew from the man’s time at Hogwarts, black eyes. So Lord Mort had adopted Harry Potter, effectively destroying all Dumbledore’s carefully made plans. The man had probably corrupted the boy so much, taught him dark magic. Magic that should have been banned a long time ago but was kept legal because of Lord Mort’s influence. The damned man had more influence than even Dumbledore and in more countries too. He even had Gringotts under his control, keeping the goblins placated with an undead dragon that guarded the oldest and most powerful families' vaults. The man was also a Death Eater but it could never be confirmed. He had no mark, no one could prove anything. It was infuriating. The boy smiled at Lord Mort like he hung the moon and it made Dumbledore's blood boil. Harry should look at him like that, He was supposed to teach the boy the way of the wizarding world, him and good magical families like the Weasleys. Not Dark families like the Malfoys and the Morts. Or even Black. There was too much darkness in those families. No, Dumbledore would have to bring the boy back to the light. Harry Potter was supposed to be the savior of the wizarding world and he would be.
Draco nodded. “That makes sense,” he said, “Very few outsiders are trusted with Temple knowledge. My friend, Hermione, is the only person I know that had been allowed unlimited access to the Jedi Archives.” Draco cleared his throat. “But that is beside the point.” He motioned at the older man. “Continue.”
“The charges,” Draco continued, “Theft of property of a noble of higher rank, abuse of a noble of higher rank, and attempted murder of a noble of higher rank.” Harry could tell the blond was really enjoying this. He would be too, if it was not so awful.
Draco smiled softly, shaking his head. He was glad she enjoyed reading more than other frivolous pursuits, like embroidery, but sometimes she got so absorbed that she ignored the real world. “I’ll come get you for dinner, then,” he said as he opened the door, “Father wants us all there. Some big announcement or something.” That said, Draco left and headed down to the archives, where, in large bound books, were a record of all the nobles of France and their holdings.
Friends. Harry could not help rolling his eyes at the thought. Dudley did not have friends; he had sycophants. Lowly nobles, ones with hardly any power or money, that attached themselves to horridness of Dudley, just for his perceived influence. They did not actually like the man. They talked, and Harry overheard. No one paid any attention to servants.
for his cousin’s funeral. His cousin, the Crown Prince. And, apparently, this man’s lover. Well … She focused back to the present as the Healer began speaking again.
“Zabini, Blaise Zabini. It’s a pleasure to meet you Heir Mort.” The dark-skinned boy said. Hadrian took his hand and shook it once
Hermione hated that her friend was essentially being forced into slumber, but she understood their reasons. “When can we see him?” She asked. Hearing all the injuries and treatments, she just wants to see Harlan. Be close to him. Possibly, hold his hand.
What followed was a whirlwind of a relationship. It had started as purely physical, resulting in many escapades of aggressive sex. About three months in, they both realized they wanted something more. Thus, they began to actually date. It was an amazing four months. Draco started to feel like he could spend the rest of his live with the other man. But, as his previous luck with love would show, it was not meant to be. He remembered clearly the day it all ended. …
{My car is being fixed. It wasn't as bad as I had feared, but I was still stranded at my old college campus where I was visiting a friend for two hours waiting for my father to come. We traded cars, and he managed to fix mine enough to get it back home with him to be fixed at our normal repair shop verses some possibly sketchy place out where I live. I'd had my laptop, and campus is really safe, even during the summer.}
Bonds like this are meant to last.
Kingsley clears his throat. "There is something else. We found this on the desk in Harry's hotel room". In his hand is a letter addressed to me. I opened it and read it and cry at the last words Harry ever wrote to me.
"What do they do?" Hadrian asked curiously.
Hermione nodded. “Thank you,” she replied. The hologram of the Knight disappeared, leaving emptiness with the occasional blip of static. After a minute, the call connected to an empty room. Well, not actually empty. She could hear someone moving around and grumbling that sounded like “Twice. Twice now.” Then, Remus appeared on the hologram. A very sleepy looking, rumpled Remus. Hermione arched an eyebrow; she had never seen the Knight look that disheveled. He blinked slowly a few times at her, then jumped, flailing around a bit. She could not hold in her laughter.
Harry bowed again. “As you command.”
Draco pouted at his best friend after taking another drag. “They won’t let me smoke down there,” he complained, “Something about it being a safety hazard.”
Harry tried to get out of bed again, going slowly this time. He pushed through the pain as silently as possible. Not as quietly as he hoped, though. At one of his gasps of pain, the blond jerked awake. The prince rubbed at his eyes as he sat up straight. He looked over at Harry on the bed and smiled soflty.
Draco sighed, but dutifully ‘translated’. Though Haydrien was not paying attention to either of them; his focus was on the Bulgarian Minister. The man’s eyes were following the conversation. Haydrien came to a realization: the wizard was pulling the same con as Haydrien.
He saved me. I have always had feelings for him, even before I met him. I mean, who wouldn't? He was the one who defeated the Dark Lord as an infant. When I first laid eyes on him, I did not even realize it was the Boy Who Lived. All I saw was an endearing, skinny boy my age with messy jet black hair and vivid emerald eyes. I fell for that boy with the innocent, wide-eyed expression. Later, I realized that my green-eyed boy was Harry Potter. I was hurt by his rejection; thus, that began our rivalry. Over the years at school, we tried to best each other at everything. I won when it came to potions; he won when it came to being seeker.
“Who are related to…” There was the second voice again. Now Hadrian was curious
Apparently, his mark had enough. “What do you want?” he demanded.
Harry left his room and headed out of the kitchen to collect eggs from the coop. After, he would make breakfast for the three Dursleys. Then, off to the orchard. Then, take the rye and extra eggs to market. He sighed. Another long day, just like every other day.
“Then it’s a good thing we’re about to land,” Draco murmured. He continued to slowly maneuvered the ship behind the air control ships. “What exactly are his injuries?”
Sorry about the long wait ... again ...
Draco nodded, checking the controls. “I know,” he said, “We’ll be there shortly. Severus is with him.”
Draco sighed, resisting the urge to pull at his collar. Why, today of all days, did the weather have to break and the sun beating down on everything? Normally, the heat would not bother him. He would just wear a loose shirt, but not today. He was wearing his ceremonial clothes, which were heavy, and thick, and itchy.
“He was no one’s first choice of heir, and neither am I,” Draco said, “but we were the only options. In Čarobnjačkom, only a male of the blood,
Hadrian wondered if he should tell his friends the last bit. There was something else Father stated in his letter. He thought he could use the stone in the ritual to bring the Dark Lord back. To give him a body back. Glancing around, he decided to hold that piece of information back. It would be safer, for everyone, if as few people knew as possible. He settled back onto the plush cushions, enjoying the company around him. He let the conversation wash over him, and his mind wandered.
The pair made their way down to the stables, where their horses were saddled quickly by the stablehands. They rode down the path that hugged the castle wall, towards the town.
Remus looked away from the man’s searching lavender eyes, focusing on the rise and fall of Harlan’s chest instead. “There’s not really anything exciting to tell,” he began, “I took my trials and passed. After that, I just did as assigned. That went on for about twenty years, and then I decided I wanted to take on a Padawan. I felt it was time. So, I stood there with the other knights waiting for the younglings that passed the Gathering to return from Ilum. They all filled in, and there he was, the last to enter. A small shy boy with a headscarf tied around his head. I knew he would be my Padawan; the Force drew me to him. The little boy from
Remus nodded. “The Blood Elves turned on the Night, Forest, and High elves. It was gruesome. Eventually, the other three managed to defeat the Blood Elves.”
Hadrian watched as the platform disappeared from sight and with it his father.
Draco shrugged in embarrassment, looking back out the window. “Just checking,” he murmured, “Landing in 3 … 2 … 1 …”
Tired of watching, Draco turned away from the window and looked at Alexei. “
The Knight nodded. “Alright, lead on,” he conceded, “I’ll guard our backs.” He turned to look at Draco. “Senator, stay between us so we can protect you better.”
Harry entered the kitchen, a basket of eggs balanced on top of a basket of apples at his hip. He had a lot of work before him. He just hoped he was able to finish it all to the standards the Dursleys expected.
Tell me how you think I did [be gentle, but honest, please!]
She hissed in frustration.
Fred shrugged uncomfortably. “We’re observant.”
“Have you seen a toad. A boy named Neville’s lost his.” A bushy haired girl said.
Draco shook his head as he walked towards her chambers. Such the flare for the dramatic. It must run in their genes, since there was lots of shouting and door slamming during the argument. Got to love that fiery royal blood.
It took him a few tries to find which room she was in, but eventually he did. They stood in what appeared to be a study; there was a desk, a couple of armchairs, and a magnificent fireplace. Lyra stood before the latter, a dust-stained linen in her hand. She was staring up at a painting on the mantel. Draco stepped beside her and looked up. His breath caught.
Lastly, Draco came before Dudley. The young man looked terrified, but resigned. Though he had flinched slightly as his parents’ sentences were read, he had not protested. He understood that they deserved that. Now it was his turn to face judgment.
Draco was standing next to his parents, with Harry by his side. Another formal ceremony. This time, it was Lyra’s wedding. The previous month, there had been a festival to celebrate the Princess’ seventeenth birthday, and that is when the announcement of her engagement occurred. She will be married to Prince Oliver, third son of King Godric of Belgium. Apparently, this union had been in negotiations for over a year, which explained why the King and Queen of Belgium had been at his and Harry’s union.
Lucius nuzzled against his ear. “What are you up to, Cas?” he murmured, hands roaming.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco was in the process of changing their destination to
“Now, I have to go let in the guests.” Pansy then gave Draco a knowing smirk. “Do not think you can change clothes the minute I am gone; I put a charm on them that prevents you from removing them yourself.”
“You’re Harry Potter, aren't you? My name’s Ron, Ron Weasley. I’m a first-year too. I plan on being in Gryffindor, like the rest of my family. I hope that we can be roommates.” The boy said. Hadrian blinked once slowly before responding
The man’s head snapped up, panicked emerald eyes meeting Draco’s silver ones. Draco could see the moment the man decided to flee, and Draco reacted.
Draco grumbled as he was slowly led to the landing pad by Felidae’s air control. Very, very slowly. Don’t they remember this was a medical emergency landing? He really wished his ship had a horn, like his speeder. He would definitely be laying on it if he had one. Why was this taking so long?
Beside him, Draco stood up. He walked over to stand before the thrones, immediate in front of the Durselys. Harry knew the man well enough to knew he was smirking, enjoying this. Harry’s enjoyment was tempered with anger and sadness, but this would be cathartic for him.
The man spoke. “Do you mind?” he asked with a faint British accent, nodding to the empty chair at Draco’s table, “Everywhere is full.” And it was true. The coffee shop had been getting progressively fuller as the afternoon wore on. “I promise not to be a disruption.”
Remus looked up abruptly, drawing in a sharp breath. “You knew him as a child?”
It must have been bad. Because, the previous times, he had not been given something to hide the blood stains. Maybe since he was going to the market this afternoon, they wanted to hide ... but why? A master was allowed to whip a servant if they did something wrong. Why would it matter if anyone saw or not?
The ride was short, and soon they were arriving at the palace. Petunia frowned. They were not announced, no fanfare to greet them. And there was no one in the courtyard to greet them. Well, no one of importance. A royal servant waited to lead them to the throne room. They were of the nobility. They deserved more than a measly servant as their reception.
… with me?” He stared at her intently.
The senator stood up, motioning for Harry to follow. “Let’s get this over with,” he said as the hatch began to open, “Just be my handsome shadow.”
“He’s on route to Felidae,” Hermione answered. She wiped at her eyes, careful of her claws that were still extended. “They’re coming from Čarobnjačkom.”
“Hey! That’s my godson!” Came a shout. Cas looked up to see both Hagrid and Sirius staring at him. Sirius took a step forwards and Cas mirrored the action with a step back.
Harry stumbled over a root, and Draco stood up. Something was wrong. The other man wavered again. He made it the man’s side just as emerald eyes rolled up. Draco caught him as he collapsed.
for the Crown Prince’s funeral and royal coronation. After the ceremonies, there was an assassination attempt in the palace gardens. The three of us snuck out of the palace to the ship. But there was an altercation on the pad. A fire fight broke out, and that was how Knight Wolfe got the blaster burn. Once on the ship, he collapsed from the burn. We assumed the fall caused his other injuries. We found him shortly after.”
Air control was taking them to the landing pad closest to the hospital. Each city has its own medical facilities, but Cadmus had the largest, being the capital and all. The planet’s university is right next to it, which is very convenient for their medical students. Ever the knowledge seeker, Hermione spent most of her time there when she was not needed in government.
“You’re not allowed to have books like that. Headmaster Dumbledore banned all books about necromancy from the library and if he thinks they're bad then they must be.” She said smartly.
McGonagall smiled at the young Knight. She had a soft spot for Harlan. He was exceptional and his control of the force was sampling astonishing for one so young, but his past still haunted him. She hoped this mission would help him face his demons. Quite literally. “Jedi Harlan Wolfe,” she began, “The Chancellor has requested a Jedi Knight to be a protector for a senator. His life is in danger because of his involvement in the anti-slavery legislation.”
To keep up the ruse, Haydrien looked to Draco to ‘translate’. Draco sighed minutely. “
The pair did not talk again for a long while.
It was a few moments before her call connected. It was one of the Knights that manned the Temple’s communication hub. She was not familiar with him, but she could tell he recognized her by how his demeanor changed a second after he appeared in her hologram. “Hello,” the Knight said, “Is there something I can help you with?”
Harry nodded. “Thank you, masters,” he replied before heading off to the Senate. He had a ship to catch.
I break down into sobs. There was no stopping it. I sink to my knees, keening as I clutch the wand to my chest. I am hysteric; I am screaming out my grief and my heartache. The noise must have woken Tia, because she comes stumbling down the hall to me.
Also, I can't remember if I stated how old Lyra was ... if I did, please remind me, because I can't find it (either I'm just struggling or I embedded it so well it's hiding or I did it in a note and thus it's not in my story document).
“Merde, he has a good arm,” he murmured under his breath. He raised his hands up in surrender, hoping another apple would not be coming his way. Wrong. There was another apple, this one coming at his head. He ducked behind a tree for safety. “Dieu, I surrender!” he shouted at the other man, “Please stop throwing apples at me!”
Lyra nodded, still clutching tight around his waist. Draco sighed and glanced at the guards. The men were staring unwaveringly forward, ignoring the pair. Draco then maneuvered them into the room and closed the door back. He led Lyra to a chaise, sitting down as well when she refused to let him go.
The woman nodded. “That’s good,” she said, looking slightly less upset, “But what happened then? You should have been completely fine.”
McLaggen cleared his throat. He seemed uncomfortable and a bit peeved, but Hermione could understand that, considering Dr. Snape had basically treated him like an child seeking approval. He cleared his throat before talking. “Right. At the moment, we have Knight Wolfe in an induced coma. We are hoping to get the burn mostly healed before he wakes up, and with the head injury healed, he could have woken up at any moment. This way, his body will have more time to heal before its attention is divided amongst conscious functions. We plan to change the bandages on the burn every couple of hours, with fresh paste.”
You may feel better.
Draco shook his head to clear away the thoughts. Recently, he seemed to get lost in memories far more frequently than normal. It was probably caused by coming back to Čarobnjačkom.
Healer McLaggen glanced from Hermione to the other man. Dr. Snape. “If we could know what happened …?” he asked hopefully.
The rest of the meal was spent chatting softly about nothing important. The sun beat down mercilessly on them, even with the partial shade of the leaves above. Draco plucked at neck of his tunic. It was heavy, thick, and it felt like it was suffocating him. He made a snap decision. They were in the middle of a basically abandoned orchard; it was just the two of them.
Always with love,
” the blond replied.
He led Harry to the bench. When the man was seated, Draco stood before him. He cleared his throat. Nervously, he shifted from foot to foot, his hand reaching into his pocket for the ring.
“I know.” Was all Lucius said before leaving the cottage; Cas looked down at his forgotten tea. He just hoped that those around him could forgive him for his mistakes.
Like silken thread it holds us fast
"Come on, Draco. Let's get this over with." Hadrian said before they headed over to the giant. Once all the first-years were gathered together they made their way to boats.
When the newly accepting Comte came to her for help to use a sword, Lyra had thought he was joking. But he had been serious. Harry had wanted to learn how to sword fight, because, apparently, that was on his list of things he needed to know now that he accepted his rightful place at court. She guessed she could see where he was coming from; every male of noble blood could wield a sword to some degree.
Harry. He had grown and changed since we last saw him fifteen years ago. Calling him Harry and not Harlan, as he introduced himself, shows that we only see the child from the past. That disregards the man of the present. That says everything he did to become Jedi Knight Harlan Wolfe is meaningless. I call him Wolfe because he is not the child I knew. He is a powerful warrior to be respected.”
for falling in love and creating a life? It was barbaric.
- I love your adorable pout
Yeah, that chapter estimate? I've added a few more to it. =) sorry, not sorry
The book had been enlightening. There is not much known to the greater public about alchemy. Alchemy was generally considered a Light art. Based on what the book said, it was actually dark. Very dark. There were detailed instructions for the process of making a Philosopher’s stone. Necromancy, Dark but mostly socially accepted, seemed tame in comparison; even with bringing back a person, there was no human sacrifices involved. If only everyone knew the truth. He had chuckled to himself at that thought.
“Do they always talk like that?” He asked, his mask slipping slightly
They made it about half the way to the ship when shouts sounded across the way. Draco looked over and saw several people running down the ground staircase to the landing pads. People with blasters. Draco could feel himself start to panic. In front of him was physical proof that his own people wanted him dead. He could no longer deny the Chancellor’s words, and that terrified him.
When he arrived at the office, Draco burst through the doors. He vaguely registered other people in the room, but his focus was on the man behind the desk. He strode forwards until he was standing in front of the man. “Chancellor Shacklebolt,” he said respectfully, nodding in difference, “I request brief leave from session to attend a funeral.”
Draco glanced at his sister as they rode slowly into the orchard. Lyra was looking around, a thoughtful and sad look on her face. As if she felt his eyes, she turned her head to look at him. He raised an eyebrow to encourage her to speak her thoughts.
Harry lifted his head to sleepily meet Draco’s gaze. “Alright,” he conceded after a few moments.
Draco was talking to someone, probably the planet’s air control, requesting permission to land. The blond stated a clearance code, and the permission was granted. They started their descent. Harry steeled himself. This would not be pleasant, but he could handle it for the brief time they are there.
She made a face, pulling something out of the bag. “Changing,” she answered, “I hate riding in skirts, but Mother visited me in my chambers while I was getting ready. Hence, the dress.”
The older man shifted in his seat uncomfortably. Draco knew how much the bigotry of this planet bothered Severus, almost as much as it upset Draco. That was why Severus ran away to Coruscant for college, not planning on ever coming back. The man only did because Sirius asked him. Severus did not know Sirius told Draco that, and he had no plans of ever telling the older man that he knew.
*peeking out shyly from behind my laptop*
** There is a description of a tongue being cut out, a person being branded, and an execution involving a beheading. I will denote the paragraphs with double asterisks so you can skip them if wanted **
“Why don’t you boys go explore, the wolf pack is by the lake if you wish to visit them. All I ask is that you take Bartholomew and Toto with you. They have been cooped up in the house for far too long.” Hadrian’s father said from where he sat at the table. Hadrian nodded and grinned happily at Draco causing Draco to smile back. They left the cottage and headed towards the stables with the two wolves following.
Draco cleared his throat and looked to the man that appeared to be the highest ranking of the bureaucrats. He would kill that man first, he decided, when he began his murderous rampage. “Senator Draconis Malfoy, Crown Prince of Čarobnjačkom,” he stated clearly, schooling away his grimace at the second title, “Requesting emergency medical assistance for Jedi Knight Harlan Wolfe.” He then watched the play of emotions on the faces of the gathered Felidaens.
The letters were signs of his love. Harry never wanted to leave, but his sense of duty to the Wizarding World forced him to. Whenever he was away, I received a letter in the early morning. How he managed to have them arrive at the same time every time was a mystery to me. However, I did not really care because I loved those letters. I had a small wooden chest that I kept them in. His job took him away so frequently that the chest was almost full. I would have probably needed to get a bigger one soon; not many more letters would have fit.
Lyra rolled her eyes at his antics. “It’s perfect, stop being dramatic,” she said. When Draco raised his eyebrow, she raised hers back at him. “What are you, scared?”
. Harry shook his head in disbelief.
Harry was looking pale. Paler than yesterday. There was an ashy hue to the normally gorgeous, rich olive skin. He mostly just nibbled at the food, though he did eat a decent amount. The man would shift slightly then wince, like he was stiff but moving to relieve that made something hurt. Merde, if those vile people hurt him again.
I fully believed all of that, until the trials came around. My trial was the last of my family's; my father tried to life in prison and my mother on house arrest for life. I never expected anyone to stand up for me; I was the hated child of Death Eater scum that in turn became Death Eater scum himself. Facing the Wizengamot, I was shaking behind my Malfoy mask. Then, the doors opened and in walked Harry. He requested to speak, and was granted that right. He told of everything I did: how I was horrified by Professor Babbling, how I only half-heartily attempted to fulfill my obligation to the Dark Lord, how he saw me lower my wand in surrender when facing Dumbledore, how I did not turn him over to my parent and in turn the Dark Lord, how I never wanted to be a Death Eater, how he saw me crack under the pressure to protect my family at the young age of sixteen. He pleaded that I be pardoned, and surprising enough, I was.
Draco blinked in shock. “That was centuries ago,” he murmured.
Draco sent for a page and Dudley was taken out. The courtiers are whispered excitedly and flittered around the room. The blond walked back to Harry, eyebrow quirked in question. Harry grinned back and nodded. Together, they made their way out of the throne room.
Cas snorted at the books. Hadrian was well beyond most of them and would more than likely find the classes to be easy. Hadrian had always shown remarkable skill in Transfiguration and Potions, the two hardest classes. The Trimble book would probably insult Hadrian as well which wouldn’t go over well.
The pair continued through the trees, looking for a good place for their picnic. They finally found a spot and dismounted. Draco took basket off his saddle while Lyra set up the blankets. With the horses tied off to a tree, they settled in: Draco with his head in Lyra’s lap and Lyra reading a book, occasionally running her fingers through his hair. And so, they waited.
Draco sighed. He had been returning to the cove every night for the last two weeks. He hoped to catch sight of the man from the other night. Nothing so far, just him and the empty waves. Thankfully, there had not been any more ear-piercing noises; his ears were ringing for two days.
“Well, Bill and Charlie are like us but they are off doing jobs elsewhere in the world.” Said Fred. Hadrian noticed that Fred’s voice was a bit deeper than George’s and he seemed a bit calmer.
Hey guys! So, kind of random, but there's this rp game my friends are running, called the Prefect Problem. It takes place during fifth year. Character applications close the 15th (so, in 6 days, sorry about the last minute notice). I hope you guys will check it out =) . Here's the link to it: http://the-prefect-problem.deviantart.com/
It was horrid, a literal nightmare. She had commandeered the ballroom in the East wing, and had, over the last two weeks, transformed it to a dance club. There was a long bar running along one side of the room, with an assortment of tables and chairs on the two sides adjacent to the bar. Across from the bar, a stage had been erected about five feet off the ground. The center of the room was cleared to be a dance floor. Three circular daises about a foot tall were dispersed out on the floor to add some flare and levels to the dancing. Lights of vibrant colors would shoot through the room like spells. The walls were transformed from their normal elegant paint job to mirrors. To Draco, everything was a bit over the top already, but Pansy went even further: each mirror was shattered into pieces no bigger than a galleon. That would give the ‘club’ a crazy, erratic feel, Pansy claimed, when the lights refracted on every piece to create a kaleidoscope effect.
Harry tried to sit up, but pain erupted across his back. He settled back down on the soft bed, his heart rate increasing. He quickly looked around and tried to gain more from his surroundings about where he was. More expensive and gilded décor. Everything was … too fancy to be true.
Clever man, Remus thought. He was sure Severus guessed the answer, but he was making Remus spill instead. “Yes, apparently the Padawan Harlan fought with had been bullying another Padawan. A Blood Elf. About being of a slave race. In front of Harlan.”
“Father is close to figuring out how to go about brewing the Elixir of Life,” Hadrian responded, “He tracked down a book, and now he is working on translating it.”
, with her hair in an
Haydrien smiled, nodding at the Minister. He waved his hand, gesturing for the older man to lead the way.
The hatched touched down on the pad with a muffled thud, and Draco got a first look at his welcoming party. A group of bureaucrats. Goodie. Granger and her bodyguard. Better. A medical team with a hover stretcher. Thank
Harry could almost see the sarcasm drip off the words. With what Master McGonagall said and his firsthand knowledge of Čarobnjačkom, that made sense; the Senator was a Krv Čista who was pushing to abolish slavery. Of course, relations with his family would be stranded.
markings a harsh black against the pale skin and bruises. Draco turned back to the door, waiting for it complete the unlock sequence and open. It was hard for Draco to reconcile his childhood friend with the powerful Jedi Knight he met with the bruised and battered man lying on a blanket spread over supply crates.
Harry blushed bright red. Draco chuckled softly as he straightened back up. With a wink and a smirk, the blond left the coffee shop. Harry collapsed into his chair with a sigh. That was intense. And a little bud inside his chest took root, encouraged by the man’s parting words. Hopefully, their paths would cross again.
Petunia scoffed. “Because you, Vernon, are vile, and everyone always compared me to Perfect Lilian,” she said, pointing a finger at Harry then, “
A new one forms in its wake
When no blaster fire was heard, Draco stuck his head out. He saw the Knight standing alone by Draco’s ship. The Knight nodded and waved them forward. Draco led the way, Severus just behind him.
“Everything will be okay,” he whispered, “I promise.”
Harry bowed his head and crossed his arm. “Pozdrav, cijenjen jaden,” he said to the man. Hopefully the shock of a random Jedi knowing Krv Čista customs would disrupt the man’s contemplations.
---.---.---.---.---.---.---.---.--.---.---.---.---.---.---.--.---.---.---.---.---.---.--.---.---.---.---.---.---.--.---.---.---.---.---.---.--
At the front were the royal family. The King looked regal, but his expression blank. While he accepted Draco’s decision, he would have preferred his son marry a woman, not tie himself to a man. Narcissa looked radiant in her
Draco let his mind wander back to his encounter with the other man. Harry. Such a bundle of contradictions. Obviously a servant, but proud like a noble. Loyal. And gorgeous: raven waves, golden tan, emerald eyes, muscular. But Draco kept going back to what the man said:
“Just all the things we’ve seen and overheard at home,” George stated, “Paints a picture, if you can think for yourself.”
She had not been the same since Father died. She had taken to stare at things for long periods of time, being oblivious to everything around her. Losing Lucius was taking its toll on her. Though they loved each other, they were not in love; it was more like the love between siblings than between lovers. Their families were very close so they basically grew up together. Their marriage was an arranged one, like most pureblood marriages. It was a good thing they never made an arrangement for Draco yet. That would have definitely lead to awkward complications due to his orientation.
Resting on the wood, a blood red stone sat. it eerily glowed, as if lit from within. Like it was the flame of life, given solid form. From what he had learned, that was essentially what the Philosopher’s Stone was. It had been very auspicious, that while he was younger and had traveled around the world, an old book at a market stall in Istanbul had interested him. It had just set on a bookshelf, untranslated except for the first few pages; alchemy had never held much appeal for Cas. Until now, the book had just been gathering dust.
were very protective of their young, and Remus thought of his former Padawan as his young.
"Hello, Hadrian. I think it's time to go, don't you?" He murmured rocking the toddler into a deeper sleep.
Harry pinched the skin of his wrist to anchor himself. “This is happening,” he whispered to himself, “I can do this. I can join with Draco. I can walk down that aisle and become his partner.” His breathing evened out, and he was able to stand back up. He straightened his clothing. It was even fancier than his normal Comte clothing, because he was being coming part of the ruling family. His family colors, red and black, prevail his attire: a blood red velvet duvet with the Potter crest embroidered on his breast over a black shirt, black leather pants into black riding boots,           black cap trimmed with fur, and finally, an ornamental sword attached to a jeweled belt. He felt a bit over the top, but it fit with the occasion.
” Draco said with a sneer, “
“Indeed,” Haydrien replied in the same fashion, “I will alert our Lord of this development.” Idly, he spun one of his rings around his finger. This dark-metaled ring bore a skull and snake for a signet, identical to the ones his fathers wore.
"That, my pet, is the bank. Gringotts. Now, remember, don't touch anything until we get to your vault." His father said as they entered the building. They strolled up to the large counter and before the goblin could ask anything his father was speaking
Draco felt his anger building at the man’s callousness about the members of his own court. His sister’s hand crept onto his leg, but it did nothing to calm him down. Mercifully, his mother spoke up before he verbally ripped his father to pieces.
And though at times a thread may break
You will survive this.
“They aren’t as important as concentration. In fact if one really wanted to they wouldn’t even have to use the movements, they would just have to concentrate on what they wanted to happen.” Hadrian said with a shrug.
Why was Draco, a trained killer and mercenary, dealing with the pervert professor? Dr. Piers had exploited the wrong students: a set of twins, Nika and Anton, in different section of his economics course. What was so special about these two students? They were the heir and heiress of a Russian mobster. And thus, Draco was hired to take care of the man.
?! The Russian seeker?!” he shouted, “Why is he would the likes of you,
“It’s Harlan,” Hermione answered, tears threatening to fall. She clenched her fists to try and gain control, but she was struggling. Her claws kept extending and retracting, their sharp points pricking her palms. “He’s hurt. I don’t know how exactly, just that he’s unconscious.”
“You knew the Dark Lord was going to die that night, didn’t you?” Lucius said, his voice cold and Cas shook his head desperately
A twig snapped at the tree line. Both men looked towards the sound. Draco cursed under his breath; of course, tonight was the night Blaise managed to find him at the cove. He turned back to the man, only for him to be gone. Again, there were ripples. For a second, he thought he saw something red and large move under the water, but it was gone too quick to be sure of anything. With a frustrated groan, he turned back to the trees. There stood Blaise Zabini, his personal guard and best friend.
“Now Ronnie…” Came a cheerful voice from outside the compartment
On that note, she turned back to the Healer, waiting for him to continue. Absently, she noticed Dr. Snape lean forward in his chair, also looking towards the Healer.
Dropping the basket, Harry knelt and picked up several apples off the ground. Straightening, Harry threw one with all his might at the nobleman. It connected solidly with the man’s shoulder. “Thief!” he shouted, getting ready to throw another.
“You have the most wonderful timing,” he drawled sarcastically, “What did you traipse through the forest for?”
And then the blond had another surprise for him. He had come back with an old man. An old man who tickled something buried deep in Harry’s mind. When the man had spoken, the memories had risen to the surface. Things Harry had long discounted as dreams: playing on the floor next to the man in the paintinf, running through the gardens with this older man right on his heels, Dobby as he called him. How could he had ever forgotten all of that?
Harry stood by the window, looking back over his shoulder at Draco. The man pulled nervously at the sleeves. Draco had been right; the clothes fit perfectly. The dark green velvet pants hugged his muscular thighs perfectly and tucked into the boots Draco had commissioned. The brown tunic was a little long but fit decently; the light green leaf embroidery around the neck and hems brought out the green in his eyes. He was waiting for the man to put on some more weight, to get to a healthy weight, before commissioning clothing. If Draco was being honest with himself, he was stalling partially because he liked seeing the man in his clothes.
Draco cursed as something small hit him, hard, in the shoulder blade. The pain shocked him and caused him to drop his saddle bag, apples rolling out onto the ground. A male’s voice shouted out from behind him, calling him a ‘thief’. He turned towards the voice, and then ducked to the ground. Because another apple was heading towards him. It soared over his head and hit the trunk of the tree, splattering on impact.
He shook his head in exasperation, before looking at Remus. “He probably got shot during one of those stupid twirls,” he said, laughing humorlessly, “I told you those were a stupid strategy. Remember? You turn your back to your attack just to harness some centrifugal force.”
Cas carefully entered Flourish and Blotts. He wasn’t used to being out alone. Usually he had Bartholomew with him or Hadrian. But Hadrian had gone off to school this morning leaving Cas in a particularly sour mood. It was late, late enough that Cas hoped that no one was really around. He had had a feeling of being watched since going to the train station. He headed over to the Defense against the Dark Arts section and began to browse, not paying any attention to when the bell over the door rang again. He had just picked up a rather interesting book about defending a home against dark curses when a hand grabbed his shoulder. Instinctively he spun around with a left hook, catching the other man square in the jaw. The other man, Sirius Black, stumbled backward.
Remus hurried through the corridors. He had just landed on Felidae. Finally. It had taken ages to get to the planet from Coruscant. It was times like these that he almost wished he owned a ship. It would have been so much faster than the public transport he took. He swore, the thing seemed to stop at every planet between the two planets. But then again, he hated piloting ships. He rarely went anywhere not on Council business anyways; he would just use a ship from the Jedi Temple on assignments.
Wolfe looked bewildered at those words, but thankfully not disgusted. Draco had seen enough bigots in his lifetime. He was glad the Jedi wasn’t one.
Molly Weasley rushed over to the Leaky Cauldron
Draco’s eyebrows rose in surprise. He had not been expecting that. “Power to you,” he replied, “I would not have the patience to deal with children. Or really, anything living.” He smirked and sent the man a wink, which caused Harry to blush.
Another chapter! And it's a really long one!!! I hope you enjoy it! <3
; she still hated wearing dressed, especially ones for formal occasions. Luna, for once, was dressed, normally, in a
just disarmed the Dauphin.
, full skirt and flowing sleeves, with yellow embroidery around the hems, necklace, and waist. Her hair, the Malfoy white blonde, was loose, falling to her waist in loose waves. It was scandalous to have it down like that at her age, but that was Luna. Draco smiled softly at the pair as they talked softly to one another. He was glad Harry had found a friend at court.
Harry smiled softly as he walked back. The day had been wonderful. It was nice to just relax, enjoying the sun, shade, and good food. The company had been great. Perfect.
Hi. Um, so I had most of this chapter written but didn't realize I hadn't finished it and published it in like, March. So sorry. If you are subscribed to my account you've probably seen that I've got into a new fandom and it's currently at war with this fandom for my time. Also, I've taken down a couple of my smaller stories. Having so many stories that are unfinished up was quite frankly overwhelming and I couldn't do it. If you look for a story and it's not there anymore, I'm sorry but please don't ask me to republish it. I will get around to them later but I'm not going to have half a dozen stories pulling me in every direction. Some good news is that I will hopefully be taking 'It's too Late to Say You're Sorry' off hiatus and have a new chapter some time in the somewhat near future. Thank you for not giving up on me and thank you for being awesome readers!
Draco was gorgeous. It had taken a lot of courage for Harry to just approach the table. But everywhere else was full. For the undergrads, midterms were just the next week, so everywhere was full of students last minute cramming. The only seat was with the standoffish-looking Greek god of a man. Draco, a fellow Englishman. The man did not seem to like to talk, but he did not sneer or ignore Harry and his rambling. And then the almost flirting. The wink.
Glancing down at Draco with a flirty smirk, Harry nonchalantly leaned his hip against the arm of the throne. The man then looked at the Dursleys and levered them with a  very unimpressed look. “Really?” he asked, the sarcasm dripping from his words, “I died, did I?”
for the occasion. His sister glared at him, and he winked back at her.
, him. What has happened in your life? How did you become a part of his?”
You will raise her right.
“And here is the best place to do that?” Draco asked incredulously. She just glared, twirling her finger at him.
That was the image that still sticks the most in Draco’s mind. The roses had an abhorrent beauty to them. The dark red of the blood stood out so piercingly against the perfect white of the petals. The roses had made the whole scene surreal. They had been everywhere; some had still been whole while others had been reduced to just petals, fluttering occasionally in the wind. Everything covered in blood.
“It’s an emergency, Dr Piers,” he said, changing the tone of his voice to pleading. It made him sound younger. He had also raised the volume of his words, so they would be easily heard within, as well as down the hallways. “Please, I need your help.”
The console beeped, alerting Draco that they were nearing Čarobnjačkom. “Looks like we’re almost there,” he said to Wolfe, “Ready to meet the family?” He glanced to the side as he adjusted their trajectory.
There, in oil, was a couple. A beautiful woman, with dark auburn hair and bright emerald eyes. Familiar emerald eyes. A handsome man, strong and proud, with raven waves pulled back at the nap of the neck. All so familiar.
The siblings watched as Harry just blinked, looking between the two. Then, he paled. “Dieu, you weren’t lying,” the man said faintly, “I’m going to die. I attacked the Dauphin.” He started to panic.
“What do you want?” Draco snapped at the two
Lyra chuckled between bites. “Oh no,” she cooed, “Someone doesn’t like the pompous Dauphin?” She reached out a finger to tap on Draco’s nose, which he promptly mimed biting.
At the moment, a thestral made its presence known by flying above the canopy of trees, circling for a minute before plunging back into the darkness beneath. Had Draco mentioned good old Taurus' obsession with magical beasts? That was the reason for the sprawling, magically-enhanced land surrounding the manor in the first place. So, over the years, each generation of Malfoy had brought new species to the grounds. Now, there were more species than Draco could count. Though, there was a record of all the animals every brought here; it was the beast tamer's cottage.
“Come stand in front of me Dray.”
Harry always sent me letters when he must leave for his job. Being the lover of an Auror was a hard life, but one I would never give up. Harry, the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, and the Savior, was the best Auror in the department. He always catches the Dark witches or wizards, always fighting crime, always saving the day. He was such a hero, and that's why I love him.
Here's the next part!
Draco finally reached Lyra’s door, the guard looking distressed. It seemed that even her guards had not been exempt from her temper. With a glance down to his bag at his side, he knocked on the door.
, antiseptic and anti-imflammatory. Stimulates production of outer skin cells. And finally, urn orchid.
Deciding she looked as good as she was going to get, Petunia left the entryway and walked down to where the carriage was waiting. With the boy gone, they had to rehire some of their former servants, the twins of that redheaded brood. The two were not her first choices, but the elder siblings had found employment on a different estate. Even through her gloves, her skin crawled from their commonness and hatred burning in their eyes as one of them helped her up.
Harry hummed softly to himself, carrying a basket at his side, as he walked to the orchard. His stomach growled, unhappy at being empty. He had not prepared himself something when he fixed the Dursleys’ meals, not that he would have been allowed anything in the kitchen. He would eat an apple or two off the trees. Those would not be missed, since the orchard was barely tended.
“Hadrian.” Draco’s voice snapped him out of his thoughts. He turned to see Draco along with Theo and a few other Slytherins.
Pushing away from the wall, Draco checked his crown to make sure it was still in place. He meandered through the crowd on his way to his throne. He paused briefly to give Harry’s shoulder a squeeze and Luna a soft kiss on the cheek. His eyes boar into Harry’s as he did. Soon, he could show the true depth of his affection for the man in public, but now was not the time.
Though most of all, I love you caring heart.
I pull myself together enough to pull my daughter into my arms, hugging her to me. "Sweatheart," I whisper, "Da-Da is not going to come home."
Draco hummed as he navigated the ship. “Well, if you weren’t a Jedi, they would believe you were my lover,” he said with a wink and an eyebrow wriggle, “But we’ll want to keep you in uniform, to intimidate and scare anyone with intensions to hurt me. Also, you look very dashing in that.” Another wink.
*the Mess Hall, in my mind:
with a trailing, heavy cape attached at the shoulders. Her hair, the platinum curls, was tamed into
Outside the courtroom, I found Harry waiting for me. He asked if I cared to get a drink with him, and I agreed. As we walked, Harry pulled something out of his pocket and held it out to me. It was my wand he stole when he was at the Manor. He said he wanted me to have it back, and to know that without it, he never would have succeeded in defeating the Dark Lord. I accepted and shared a companionable afternoon with the man I loved.
Behind them, completely ignored, stand Draco and Fudge. The older man sighed. “Well, at least they’ll each have someone to talk with.” Draco did roll his eyes that time.
They made good time, reaching the village shortly. Again, people moved aside as they recognized the royal crest on the saddles. The pair reached the townhouse and dismounted. Draco tied the horses off on the fence where they could reach some of plants in the front garden. Harry looked very uncomfortable; he was still wary of attention and the crowded village roads did not help.
Theo hummed, a curiously look on his face. “So, what is your father going to do with the stone?” he asked, “There are so many rumored abilities about it.”
Piers slipped into an apartment building, swiping his card to unlock the door. Draco waited about ten minutes before approaching the door. Earlier in the week, he had made a clone of the building’s card. He had stolen a youth mother’s card as he helped her get her shopping and infant out of the car and up to her apartment; he had returned it the next day, claiming he had found it on the ground outside by her car.
Draco’s eyebrows rose at the man’s state. It almost looked like … Draco rolled his eyes. A thud sounded from within the apartment. “You and I, Dr Piers, need to have a talk,” he said, his cold mercury eyes locking onto wide dull brown, “You should get rid of your company.” Draco was glad to have slipped on a beanie to cover his pale blond hair, since there would now be a witness that could possibly identify him.
Your beautiful face,
The man paused, glancing between the siblings before nodding.
“That’s why we told you.” George continued
Draco sat back, shocked. That was … odd. Really, really odd. He shook his head to clear away the whole occurrence and focused back on the controls. He did need to land the ship at some point, after all.
He slumped into the pilot’s seat, his mind conflicted. He wanted to go back to Čarobnjačkom to pay his respects to Sirius. The man was like a father to him. No, that was the wrong analogy. Sirius was like an older brother, playing with him after Harry was gone and then taking Draco under his wing when he was older. Sirius was the only family member Draco actually liked, and now he was dead.
Alexei leaned into Draco. “
Draco smirked, settling back against Hadrian. “Oh, this is too good. Dumbledore will have trouble explaining himself to the board when they hear about all this. I'll be sure to write to Father about rumors of a Cerberus in the castle so he can bring the Board to investigate, before the old man has time to cover his tracks.”
He frowned when two figures dressed in dark gold robes slowly opened the large doors. He had thought the Hogwarts’ uniform robe was black. The hoods of the robes were up, hiding the pairs’ faces and gender from the watching students. The two nodded to each other, and the one of the right drew its wand. With a silent wave, a badger made of colored gas appeared above the open doorway. A double line of students in black robes with yellow badges appeared under it. They walked to the left side of the hall and stopped. The badger followed them and paused above their heads, looking around curiously. Draco leaned close to Alexei’s ear. “
Draco waved away whatever protest the other man would have said. He attached the bag to the saddle and climbed up onto his horse. “Keep it,” he said, reigns in hand, “For the apples and your silence. Farewell …” He frowned. “I did not catch your name.”
Draco sighed. Of course, Wolfe would be smart enough to notice he never actually said why his family hated him. “When I was a child, I had this friend,” he explained, “He meant so much to me, but he was sold away. My parents got rid of him because Krv Čista and Nečista Stvorenje only supposed to be master and slave, not friends. I called him Harry, and I don’t even know what became of him. No one there cares about one lowly Nečista Stvorenje, and that sickens me.” Draco looked away from the other man, focusing on preparing for their landing.
Their attention was drawn back to the doors as the figure on the left conjured a raven, also made of gas. Again, two lines of students in black robes, with blue badges this time, entered the ball and moved down the right side. The raven flew above their heads, circling when they stopped. “
It is 9:30 am. There is no letter. This is not right. Currently, I am sitting in my squishy chair, staring out the window, looking for our black-capped screech owl. His recent letters sit on my lap. The anthology is also on my lap. It is actually really good. There are many different types of love poems in it: true love, addictive love, abusive love, unrequited love, and lost love. I read through the entire book, skipping the ones about lost love. I do not want to think about that because I have a feeling that something is terribly wrong.
Granger looked panicked and worried. She kept fiddling with the tear-drop emerald hanging from her waist chain. Her bodyguard, a ginger tabby Felidaen, stared stoically ahead, eyes zeroed in on the blaster in Draco’s holster. The bureaucrats’ reactions were most amusing. When Draco had announced himself, the head had looked faintly smug, like he couldn’t wait to make things difficult, and the rest wore similar looks. However, that changed when Draco stated Wolfe’s title. The group began to titter uneasily as the head paled. They knew they would face the wrath of the Jedi Council if they delayed in administering aid to one of their Knights. Draco bit back a smirk.
Most definitely a slut.
” he replied in disgust, “
*gasp* another chapter!! Enjoy!!! <3
Pansy leered. “Yeah, a leg up and over the Durmstrang boys’ hips.”
There are cultural aspects that are common among all merpeople: bonding and mating. Merpeople bond for life. All matings are acceptable: single sex and polygamous. The only restriction to bonding is from slaves; they are not allowed to bond to a free merman or mermaid, or to another slave. Due to their anatomy, Mermen are very similar to male seahorses, in the sense that they care carry a child. They are different from seahorses because they can produce eggs themselves if necessary.
! He pushed himself up quickly, and promptly fell to the floor. He felt hands on him, helping him up and back into the bed. He barely noticed as he struggled to get enough air. His hand was pressed against a firm chest.
Regarding that, Felidae was odd, at least in Draco’s opinion. Their senator actually has a role in how the plant runs. A small role, but a role nonetheless. He, the senator of Čarobnjačkom, had no power in his planet’s government. His planet was ruled by an absolute monarchy. Even as the Crown Prince, Draco had no power. That would change when his Grandfather, King Orion, died, may his soul burn in the fires of
“The only kind of necromancy that is illegal is the raising of human dead and or making Inferni. I myself only raise small things like owls and wolves but if you keep pushing me I might raise something like a basilisk to stop you from annoying me.” Hadrian said sharply. He didn’t really have the capabilities to raise any magical creatures but this buffoon didn’t know that. And from how pale he got the threat had worked.
Slowly, Harry was able to gain control of his lungs and actually take in air. He blinked rapidly as his vision focused; he had not even noticed the spots until they were gone. He stared up into worried silver eyes. “Sorry,” he whispered, feeling embarrassed.
“And you want my help resurrecting the Dark Lord. What about Hadrian? It still doesn’t explain why you took him.” Lucius snapped
Draco nodded his head, unable to meet her eyes.
Harry could see the panic growing in their eyes. He was morbidly curious about how they would try to talk themselves out of this. But there was nothing they said that could save them now. They would pay for what they did to him.
“Show off.” Hadrian smirked and promptly changed the needle back into a matchstick.
The ceremony, as it progressed, was dreadfully boring. Draco wondered if his own ceremony had been like this. He almost felt sorry for everyone that had attended. He glanced over to Harry, and then, almost rolled his eyes. His consort, the love of his life, was asleep. Standing there, at the front of the cathedral, at his sister-in-law's wedding, was asleep. He focused back to the front when the bishop started the final blessing. He would tease Harry about this later, in private, and never breath a word of it to Lyra or anywhere she could overhear. She would kill them both, even if it was not Draco’s fault at all. He was guilty by association.
I decided to have her branded for several reasons. Though she is technically a servant, she is a different type of servant than others. She is a criminal serving a punishment. In this universe, servants that were criminals are branded to denote their status. Even after they have served their punishment, they will bare the mark of their actions for the rest of their lives. There are still other servants, both paid and indentured.
“Destri.” he said in a commanding tone and the matchbox grew and morphed. When it was done it now was made of white gold with a stain glass cover depicting a red dragon in flight. When Draco opened it up it began to play a sad tune.
Draco chuckled. “
Draco stopped it, giving his sister a meaningful look. “A dress,” he said, “We will be out with the townspeople, and it is unbefitting of a princess to be seen in pants.”
Hermione paced the room anxiously, gripping hard to the teardrop emerald of her necklace. Waiting was … Horrible. Excruciating. Infuriating. She
After the second course was brought out, his father cleared his throat and looked determinedly at Draco. Great. “Son, about what we discussed,” he began, but Draco cut him off, not wanting to continue that rehash that conversation. He needed to distract and redirect.
“I... I lied. I couldn’t keep telling our Lord things and watch as things went differently. It was easier to say that I used a botched ritual and keep the things I Saw secret. Time isn’t like a straight line, Lucius. It’s like a tree with so many branches that even the littlest thing can change which path the world takes.” Cas said, desperation lacing his voice.
“So,” Blaise said, “Now that we’re alone without listening ears, what did you want to talk about Draco?” The Italian lifted a judgmental eyebrow. “That was what you were eluding to in the library, was it not?”
Cas stood watching the Potter house burn. A zombified wolf stood at his side. Nearby Sirius and Hagrid stood yelling at each other.
Severus arched an eyebrow at Draco, sitting back in his chair. “What I was saying before that little tangent,” he started, “Harlan Wolfe may be this powerful Jedi Knight on the outside, but he is probably still that timid little boy that we knew on the inside. Maybe.” The man shrugged. “We don’t actually know what happened to him in the intervening years. We know your father sold him when you both were six. We don’t know to which family you father sold him. There are many horrible, horrible people, much worse than the royal family.”
Severus nodded. “Yes, I did,” he said, “How could I not? I raised him. I loved him, like a son I would never have. As much as I love Draconis, he is Lucius’ and Narcissa’s, the next heir to the throne. But Harry, as we called him, was mine.” He smiled softly down at the man in the bed. “Sirius loved him at well.” He chuckled wetly, tears back in his eyes. “Siri had this crazy theory. That Harry was the son of his best friend. He swore up and down that Harry was the spitting image of James.”
Of course, not all of that was visible to Draco from the window. The grounds were vast, spreading out for many kilos around the manor. The grounds were not natural, enchanted into their current state. It was done centuries ago by Taurus Malfoy. This was the Malfoy line's ancestral home, so, of course, a Malfoy created the grounds. The window faced south, so the current visible piece of the ring was the forest.
He and Harry turn to look. Lyra was standing up by the blanket. She raised an eyebrow at Draco. He sighed.
” He spotted a redhead amongst the Gryffindors and his sneer deepened.
It was an interesting game. Though Viktor was flying circles around the Irish seeker, the other team’s chasers were dominating the Bulgarians. Viktor had abstained from catching the snitch in hopes that his team could close the gap, but it was just getting more and more embarrassing. He put an end to their suffering before it could get much worse. It was a brilliant display of talent, daring, and acrobatic flying as he grabbed the golden ball out of the air. Though as it stood, they still lost the match, even with the points gained from the snitch.
Draco chuckled. “But we must,” he cooed, scratching softly at the man’s scalp, “It’ll be good. You’ve been cooped up too long. We won’t be around the palace, if that’s your concern. We’ll be going into the village.”
Harry.
Draco sighed sadly, nodding. “Alright,” he answered. He tucked the papers behind his back. It was not important right then. Harry, and what happened, and what Draco was going to do about it that was. He watched the other man leave.
Draco gave him a faint smile. Harry counted that a victory. The blond had been, on and off, glaring out the window like he wanted to murder it. “We’ll see,” he said, leaning closer to whisper in Harry’s ear, “Can’t keep Hot Teacher waiting, now can I?”
“The good side…” Continued the one on the right
He stepped out from behind the tree, brushing off his clothing. “Who dares throw apples …” He trailed off, the other man’s words finally registering. “Hang on, ‘Dursley’?” he asked, incredulously, “These are not Dursley lands.”
Back to the present, Vernon was now up on the platform, on his knees before the block. It was time. Draco raised a hand, and the drums stopped. Silence reigned on the gather people in the courtyard.
“Forgive me. I am not used to human contact and you caught me off guard.” Cas said calmly bowing slightly. The other man glared at him
“Andromeda was disowned when she ran off and married a scavenger. She ‘sullied’ the bloodline by reproducing with a non- Krv Čista. Their daughter is a wonderful, bubbly klutz and is a Metamorphmagus, like her father,” Draco said with a smile, “We have lunch whenever she’s on Coruscant. She’s a blast.” Draco chuckled softly. “And I am Narcissa’s only child. Sirius decided to stay the Crown Prince for two reasons: one, it would piss off the King and two, I could do more good as a senator. That I had the chance and motivation to change the things that he couldn’t.”

Cas stared out the window, absently tapping his fingers on the tabletop. Snow fluttered to the ground outside. The countryside was blanketed in white. It was gorgeous, but Cas felt cold, both in mind and body. Hadrian was the one that loved winter. He felt his son’s absence like a gaping hole in his chest. The boy being away for so long was wearing on him. Add in all the nonsense with his guardianship and the hearing, Cas just wanted to have his son in his arms again.
Running his hand through his hair, Draco walked over towards the tent pavilion set up for the drivers. Though he did not like to socialize, he needed to at least appear to be civil with his fellow drivers. Blaise had heard that the racers found him standoffish. It was not like it was all his fault. They were not particularly warm to him either, especially a select few.
.  And he,
Draco looked up at the other man, horror and anger warring behind his eyes. “Harry … what?” he trailed off, not able to find the right words.
So, I tagged "Survivor's Guilt - minor". Harry struggles with Survivor's Guilt, but very mildly. There is no self-harm, no suicidal thoughts. Harry will loses the motivation to get up and live: not getting up out of bed, not leaving the bedroom, not putting effort into outfits and appearances. There will only be one instance of this in the fic, and it will not be from Harry's perspective, so it will be described too much in detail. That being said, I will put a warning of it in the notes for that chapter (it won't happen for a bit, at least four or five chapters).
for the funeral of the Crown Prince. How do you comfort an ex-lover over the death of their current partner? Remus was clueless, so he just settled for the simplest. “I’m so sorry,” he murmured.
“Albus Dumbledore. Headmaster’s office, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.” She said throwing the floo powder into the fireplace and sticking her head in.
Draco stormed through the halls, ignoring the stares and the whispers. He did not care; his only concern at the moment was the man in his arms. The very light man. More proof of his mistreatment at the hands of the Dursleys. More proof to use against them.
With one last glance at Harry, Draco nodded. The guards snapped to attention. The drummers, stationed that corners of the yard, began to beat an ominous rhythm which echoed against the stone walls. The crowd buzzed with anticipation. After a few moments later, the gate opened, and three people stepped out: two guards with the criminal between.

, and
Dudley nodded, bowing deeply. “Yes, my lord.”
Pulling a knife out of his boot, Draco began to work at removing the stained material. He sliced carefully. After a few minutes, it fell away. Draco cursed. It was worse than he thought. Harry must have been whipped at least twenty times, probably more. They were fresh, most still oozing blood, sluggishly. And the wounds were irritated, like something had been rubbed into them. Or … the whip had been coated in something beforehand. He frowned, looking closer. The skin not cut open, was covered in scars. As if from a previous lashing.
Harry raised his eyebrows as he read the email the college sent out. Apparently, Dr Piers had been found dead in his apartment a couple days ago. The police were investigating and want anyone with information to call the list hotline. Along with the body, there had been evidence of exploitation between the man and students. The college made an official statement about it, vilifying his actions. They also stated any student affected by the man’s actions should got to the police station to file a report.
Draco nodded as well. “How long have you worked for them?”
Theo smiled faintly, taking one of each of their hands. He kissed their knuckles and let their hands rest on his lap. Draco rolled his eyes at their couples’ behavior. “But that does not explain how Dumbledore got a hold of the Philosopher’s stone. The only alchemist who is known to have successfully made one is Nicholas Flammel. The man is extremely secretive. No one knows how he did it or where he keeps the stone. How did Dumbledore get it?”
Harry stood from the bed, his back creaking. The scabs across his shoulder blades twinged with the movement, but he ignored that. He was used to waking up with the pain of half healed wounds. Harry walked over to the window and opened the shutters. He leaned his elbows on the sill, closing his eyes and breathing deep.

“It would be nice to have more friends than just Dray.” He said softly and could practically feel the grins the twins sent his way.
Draco stood there for over an hour, waiting for the man to surface. He never did. Maybe he imagined it? Draco could have almost believed that, if not for the ringing in his ears. He turned to walk back to the castle. He did not see, near the mouth of the cove, the head that popped up and watched him leave.
I'm sorry it took forever for me to post. I overcame vast amounts of writer's block and lack of motivation to finish it. But, it's longer than the first part (by almost 3k words!!), so I hope that makes up for it. =)
There was a hiss of pressure being released, and the bay door slowly began to lower. Draco stood at attention, hands resting against the small of his back with thumbs interlocked and fingers extended. He wished he was a bit more formally dressed. Not to the extent of his Prince garb, but at least his Senator attire. Felidae was big on ceremony; he hoped they would excuse his informality based on the circumstances. Next to him, Severus mimicked the stance.
“We were given their property!” the Baron shouted.
To bind us closer and keep us strong
his younger sister had grown into a stunning woman. She was wearing a
He did not want to find Mr. Right there. This party was basically full of miserable men, desperate for a lay and willing to go anywhere to get it. Pansy did not know that he saw her pass out invitations to all men at three different gay Wizarding clubs; he had followed her. He was hurt that she thinks he would fall for someone here. He wanted to fall in love naturally, not through a set-up. He was not even sure he even wanted to even fall in love, actually.
'Til we meet again.
Draco winced. “How did he get those injuries?” he asked, a little confused.
Draco looked out further, passed the gardens, to the 'wild' grounds. That consisted of a variety of different landscapes, all flowing together perfectly. There was an expansive forest that melds into a marsh on one side and rolling fields on the other. There was a large lake in the fields, almost the size of a loch in size, and the bottom was fathoms below the surface. The far side of the fields was a dry terrain that then led into a rocky mountainside with many volleys and caves. The mountains slowly disintegrated with a magnificent waterfall. The river meandered through the gentling slope as trees appeared and became the swamp. It was all very magical and harmonious.

were just the same. And they saddled me with you. She had the audacity to die giving birth to you. Then her husband had to go and die as well. There you were, looking just like Comte Potter with Lilian’s unique eyes.” She smirked nastily. “And I saw my opportunity. To take everything that I deserved. Everything that Lily took from me. As the eldest, it all should have been mine. So, we took your property, your money. And I made you suffer just like I always wanted to make Lilian suffer.”
“We both know you would have caved to Dumbledore’s wishes. You would have left the boy in an abusive home and gone after Pettigrew for revenge. You would have ended up in Azkaban, then later you would die. Dumbledore has Pettigrew in his pocket and if you help me I’ll tell you where he hid the disgusting rat.” Cas said turning away from the other man to skim the numerous books again.
It was true. Draco had no patience for children. He loved his nephews, but he could only handle them in small doses. Like, twenty minutes at most. It was also true, that his patience was pushed by most of humanity. That was probably why he enjoyed being an assassin so much. He got paid to help cull the hoards.
A look of grief flashed across the man’s face, and he sighed. He walked over and leaned against the desk. “Yes, it was a shame, what happened to them,” he said, “They were too young.”
Draco stepped aside and motioned towards the Knight. He watched as they carefully maneuvered Wolfe off the crates and onto the hover stretcher. As the passed on the way off the ship, one stopped in front of Draco. The woman offered him Harlan’s cloak and lightsaber, which he tentatively took. He stared down at them, no sure what to do.
Draco caught movement out of the corner of his eye and turned back to watch the pair in gold. They had taken a step towards each other so their shoulders now brushed. They raised their wands out in front of their chests, and Draco realized they were opposite of each other: the one on the left right-handed, the one on the right left-handed. As one, they moved their wands in mirror images of the other, weaving intricate patterns. Above the students, the gas creatures began to spiral towards the center of the room, getting faster as they moved closer together. The creatures collided with a bright flash. When everyone regained their sight, they saw the crest of Hogwarts suspended in the air.
The rest of the break passed uneventfully for the group. They had finished their assignments within the first few days, so everyone was working on individual projects now. Well, some were projects. Hadrian rolled his eyes at Draco, who’s nose was buried, once again, in a romance novel. The twins were researching potion composition, specifically how to combine potions and sugar without altering the potions or the mix tasting awful. They wanted to make prank sweets. Hadrian shuddered at the thought if the pair succeeded; no one would be safe. Theo was settled between them, looking so content as he flipped through a book on druidic rituals. Blaise was diligently taking notes from a journal written by an Italian crusader, which outlined how he combined spellcasting and weaponry.
Draco watched the carriages land in front of the school, the black leads snorting and tromping the ground. He found it ironic that the school that snubbed all things dark would have what most consider dark creatures pulling their carriages. Then again, most of Hogwarts students were sheltered and have never witnessed death, unlike most of them at Durmstrang.
“Maybe something more one day.” Cas said, a hint of wistfulness in his.
“Yeah, we know.” Fred said
By the time Draco made it down to the track, wading through all his admirers, it was almost time to line up. He untied his jumpsuit and slipped his arms through the sleeves. He scrunched his nose as he zipped it up; while he was grateful for the sponsorship, he did not care much for Starbucks as a coffee shop. It could be because he is not a big fan of coffee. Or also, that his tea is never quite right. Oh well. Americans seemed to love it, and the company wanted him to be their racecar driver. He was not going to argue with having his entry fees and car maintenance paid.
Sorry for the long wait =/
The older man rolled his eyes at Draco and then stood up. “Let’s go greet the welcoming committee, shall we?” he asked in a bored tone.
The sound of clapping startled the pair; they had been the only ones in the training courtyard. Draco was leaning against the archway with a smile. His attendant nobles stood just behind his shoulder: Marquis Longbottom, Vicomte Thomas, the visiting Duc Zabini from Italy, and the Barons Crabbe and Goyle. Apparently, her brother had not been able to shake them. Draco pushed away from the wall and walked over to Harry. He reached out to fix the man’s hair; the ponytail had come loose and messy throughout the practice.
He rolled his eyes at her. “Why yes, Hermione. It is, after all, the middle of the night.” He scrunched up his nose. “Though, you are not the first to do so tonight.”

They dissolved into fits of laughter. The rest of the trip was spent like that. With laughter, with smiles, and hopes for the coming year. Little did they know of what fate had in store for them.
His best friend was Alexei Nikitin. He was the youngest son of a very dark Russian family with lots of power in the Russian Ministry. He was the same age as Draco. Both of them were of the similar builds: tall, broad chested, lithe muscles. However, that was where the similarities ended. Where Draco’s skin was pale as ivory, Alexei’s was a golden tan. Where Draco’s hair was pale blond and short, Alexei’s hair was a deep, blood red and fell to his waist. The man usually wore it in a bun. The two of them were the strongest and most terrifying pair at the school.

on a daily basis. In the senate, no one cared that he was royalty, and Draco loved that. He was just another senator, and he had managed to make a name for himself: the Dragon of the Senate. It had a nice ring to it, and it was completely accurate. Draco was ferocious, hot-tempered, stubborn, and focused to the point of obsession, just like a dragon. He remembered when his friend, Senator Blaise Zabini of Essos, took him to his home planet to see the magnificent creatures.
The young Baron, who had just looked stupidly confused throughout the proceedings, finally spoke up. “Who?” he asked. Draco barely refrained from rolling his eyes.
Slowly, Draco lifted a piece of ribbon off his leg and marked his place. He closed the book, leaving it lay on his lap. He clasped his hands on top of it, staring at the pale digits for several moments. With a sigh, he looked back up at Harry.
Severus sighed. “I’m not going to lie,” he answered, “It is bad. I did what I could to stabilize him. He needs more help than I can give with a basic med-kit.”
“Ravenclaw!!” The hat shouted and his once plain black tie changed until it was bronze and blue. The Ravenclaws were cheering and celebrating. They had gotten the Mort heir who was also technically Harry Potter. Hadrian glanced at the Slytherin table where Draco was sitting. Draco grinned at him and did a shooing motion. Hadrian grinned wickedly and went to join his new housemates.
, or from
, the home planet of his good friend and collaborator on the bill, Senator Granger, when the intercom buzzed again. Draco absently answered it.
The other man glared, walking forward. “Yes, they are,” he stated, “Baron Dursley owns this orchard. And the apples.” He nodded towards Draco’s forgotten saddle bag.
One man could hardly take perfect care of all the acres of apple trees. Harry could barely keep the trees healthy. He could not pick all the apples of the trees, and even if he did, what would he do with all the apples. He could not take them to the market with the rye and eyes. He could only take what he could pull in the estate’s old pull cart, and the apples were not worth their weight to haul to market.
The Baroness paled, but the Baron’s face grew red with anger at Draco’s words. Harry nearly sighed. He recognized that look. There would be shouting, and normally hitting, but the Baron would not dare to strike the Dauphin.
Dieu - "God" in French
Kind of a filler chapter, but I hope you all enjoy it (Yay medieval fashion!!!) <3
“by the way, there is something else I think you should know,” Severus drawled, “It seems our resident Jedi Knight is Nečista Stvorenje.”
Silence reigned, and no more apples came his way. Cautiously, Draco poked his head around the tree to see. A man stood between the trees, a basket resting on the ground near his feet. He struck an impressive figure against the foliage: proud and strong. The pose was at odds with his attire, which even from a distance, Draco could tell was haggard. Who was this man?
Draco rolled his eyes. “No, they’re not. I promise, just put them on,” he said, “And don’t call me that. I’m Draco to you.” He winked. “Be back in a few.”
“Do you really think I would lead us somewhere I could not navigate? Insolent brat,” the older man snapped. For the moment, Draco though he saw a sheepish look  on the Knight’s face, but it was gone too quickly for him to be sure. Severus continued, “I can get us to the other wall, very close to the landing pad.”
The prince smiled softly. “There’s nothing to be sorry for,” he replied, “It must be overwhelming. And unfortunately, there are a few more stocks in store for you.”
Remus pulled a face at that, rubbing circles with his thumb on the back of Harlan’s hand. “That does not seem,” he paused, rethinking, “You were passionate about biology and politics. Why archival work?”

Draco could already feel a headache coming on, and he still had to suffer through dinner with his father. Joy. Their argument that morning about his marital options was still fresh in his mind, and he really did not want to be in same room as the king.
. It barely covered anything. It stopped above Draco belly button, exposing a pale blond happy trail and a
This was his punishment for ignoring the planning of her wonderful party for him. Pansy was going to dress him. Great. Draco was sure he would end up looking like a man-whore.
about a noble family?
Draco stared at the man in disbelief. Really? Did he think he could get away with lying to the royal family? He was not the only person shocked. Amongst the crowded courtiers, there were many gasps as well as a long, sarcastic snort.
After apparently finishing his spiel, Kingsley clapped his shoulder one more time and then wandered back to the other older drivers. Satisfied with his social interaction, Draco left the tent. He wandered around: nodding at drivers and pit crew, waving to the stands, smiling at the fans out on the green. In his walking, he had picked up his helmet, resting it against his hip. He glanced up at the jumbotron. Almost time.
Hadrian hummed, putting a bookmark to hold his place. “How about the common room?” he asked as he looked around the group. Since no one else in the house had stayed over break, there was no one to complain about the two Gryffindors hanging out in the rooms. Also, their redheaded moronic stalker could not follow them inside. Total privacy.
The rest of the story will be from Draco's point of view.
“Be careful, Heir Mort.” Said Fred solemnly
When the Knight entered, Draco pointed to the copilot’s chair. “You can sit there,” he said, “You don’t have to do anything. I’ve already put in the destination; we’re going to the Royal Palace in the capital.” Draco frowned, something just occurred to him. “I don’t know your name.”
Draco designed was simplistic. Three metals braided together: bronze, gold, and silver. Intermitted in the design, several small emeralds were nestled in the braid. The stones matched the man’s eyes. Now, he just needed the right moment to give it to Harry, and ask the man to be his consort.
“What are you miscreants doing?!” A voice shouted, causing the siblings to nearly jump out of  their skins. They had thought they were alone, but apparently, they had been mistaken.

“In my possession? I don’t have a Horcrux of the Dark Lord. And what would you need it for?” Lucius asked startled
The Prince in question stood at the altar. He was handsome enough: sandy blond hair with hazel eyes, decent build, just a bit shorter than Draco. The man was closer in age to Draco and Harry than Lyra at nineteen, maybe twenty? That was not too much of an age difference; there were much older princes that she could be marrying. Hopefully, Oliver would learn quick when to pick his battles. The princess was a force of nature. The prince was also very lucky. Lyra seemed to like the man, given their interactions over the month since her birthday. If she had not, Oliver would have a problem in the form of an angry older brother. Harry shifted closer, their arms brushing.
When the hatch fully opened, there was a man waiting for them. He was a looming figure, with a large hooked nose. Lavender eyes stared blankly out of a haunted face. The man’s black hair hung limply to his shoulders, greasy like it hadn’t been washed in a long time. Something about him tickled Harry’s memory, but he couldn’t quite place why. And now was not the time.
As delightful as those hours had been, he knew it could not happen again. Would not happen. Dieu, it should not have happened in the first place. He was just a lowly servant. No, he was essentially a slave to the Dursleys. And Draco. Draco was the Dauphin. Destined to be King of France.
“Perfect Lillian,” the Baroness muttered, hatred dripping off the words, “with her perfect life.”
Draco smiled, picking up his satchel. “Let’s go, shall we?”
“Sev,” Draco croaked, grief coloring the word, “I’m so sorry.” The blond wrapped the man up in a bone-crushing hug. The older man returned it just as fiercely.
Looking out over the courtiers, Draco’s eyes narrowed in on Harry. Unlike before, when the man was been subtly hiding behind the others, Harry was standing tall, in all his noble, righteous anger. The others parted as the man made his way towards the front. Confidently, Harry walked through the gap between the courtiers and the thrones to stand next to Draco’s.
Draco barely stopped himself from rolling his eyes. Of course, the masters would be enigmatic and only give him the barest of details. “I am Senator Malfoy,” he answered, “And you are coming with me to Čarobnjačkom.” The Knight’s whole body tensed and his eyes widened in fear, much to Draco’s surprise. Interesting reaction for a Jedi. “Let’s go,” he said, turning back towards his ship, “We have a tight schedule to follow.” He glanced over his shoulder to make sure the Jedi was coming. After a moment of hesitation, the other man began walking. Draco turned back around and headed to the cockpit, checking everything one last time.
Who knew my name would be a warning
Draco nodded. “It looks like the property is understaffed,” he said, “We can ask Harry when we see him.”
Dudley rapidly shook his head. “No, sire, I did not know anything about them, or Harry,” he said, then blanched, “I mean, Comte Potter.” He ducked his head in a stunted bow. “I remember moving, but not why we moved. And I knew Mother hated the little boy who was with the other servants. She encouraged me to be awful to him, to get him in trouble.”
charm revealed that it was time for him to head down to Pansy’s torture, masquerading as a party. Draco did not want to go because the men he had loved and lost were not there.
Blaise rolled his eyes. “Maybe you should quit, then,” he replied, voice dripping with fake sincerity, “And you can’t smoke up here either.”
Harry looked up to the balcony and smiled. The crowd cheered.
I awake to pounding on the door. I must have fallen asleep. I look down to see Tia curled up on me, still sleeping. Around 10:15, she came into the sitting room, wanting to be held. So I emptied my lap and settled her in it. We both must have dozed off. I see the time is now 11:38. I look about hopefully, but there is no owl, no letter.
The way to get to Durmstrang explained here is born from my own mind. Lots of times, Durmstrang is thought to be on an island somewhere in the North Sea. However, going off descriptions of mountains and glaciers (and looking at maps of northern eastern Europe), I decided to put the school up a fjord on the northwest side of Norway. I decided the students get there via ships (general consensus and the fact that Durmstrang students arrived at Hogwarts via ship. And also, teleporting ships, because how else would the ship get into the land-locked lake at Hogwarts?). I chose three ports/ships because the size difference. Eastern Europe is vastly larger than the UK, and it would be completely impractical for, say, a student from Austria to travel all the way up and over to Saint Petersburg, and then go to Norway. Three locations spread out over Eastern Europe makes more sense. Once the ships were out to open sea (and away from land/muggles), they would descend below the surface. Underwater, each would teleport out to the Norwegian Sea and resurface together. From there, they would north up the coast until they reached the fjord, and then up to the fortress. I have decided the ships must be equipped with some teleporting capabilities, since in canon the Durmstrang ship in the books surfaced in the landlocked lake at Hogwarts.
A tense silence settled as the food was served. Draco glanced to the side at Lyra, seeing her try not to squirm in her chair. Thankfully, it was not a fancy meal, just the minimum courses. Hopefully, they could get through this meal quickly. Without conversation. But it was not to be.
“Go away!” a girl’s voice wailed throw the wood, “I said to leave me alone!”
Right before the war began, I came to terms with the fact that, while I loved Harry Potter, it would never be; we were on opposite sides of the soon-to-be battle. I never wanted to be on the dark side. My first act of rebellion was when I could not killed Dumbledore. My second came as I refused to identify a very swollen-faced Harry when the Snatchers dragged him and his friends into the Manor. When Harry pulled me from room of hidden things, from the cursed fire, I hoped against all odds that it meant he cared about me.
Draco slunk forward on his long legs to stand before her. Instantly, he was immobilized, and Pansy’s face stretched into an evil smirk.
“What happened?” he breathed, crouching down next to Harry. He reached out like he was going to touch his shoulder.
Harry mentally shook himself and started on his reading. While not the most interesting of topics, he did find it fascinating. How the mind worked, particularly as it was developing and changing through childhood and adolescence. Time flew past without his notice.
“Enthused,” Draco answered in a deadpan, offering her his arm. With a pinch to his side, she accepted it.
Hermione’s musings were interrupted by a Healer entering the waiting room. He glanced around at them all before speaking, “We contacted Knight Wolfe’s listed next of kin, Knight Noir. He is in transit to Felidae, but we cannot divulge medical information over hologram. He did give us permission to tell you, Senator Granger – ” The Healer motioned to Hermione “ – and whomever initially administered medical aid.” The Healer then turned to the other man with a questioning look.
