The wedding march began and Blaise led me down the sale. He handed me over to Draco and I drowned out the rest. All I could focus on was the Alpha I was going to marry. We said our I do's and the next thing I know his lips are on mine. I felt a smile on my face as he pulled away and I was announced as the future Lady Malfoy.
I started wandering around trying to find the kitchen. I felt weak from my lack of food lately and had to take a break a couple of times. While walking through the entrance hall I ran into a large body mass. I almost fell on impact put whoever I ran into steadied me. I looked up and saw it was the Alpha from the headmaster's office. Seeing him up close made me aware of how attractive he was. He had stormy grey eyes and neat blonde hair. It was clear that he was well-muscled. His complete hotness made me blush.
This time of the year is always the loneliest. My oldest brothers Jamie and Derek are moved out and my other two brothers, who are twins, Kaden and Jaden are in their seventh year at Hogwarts. I wasn't allowed to go to Hogwarts since I'm an Omega which isn't fair since all the other Omegas still get to go. Most of my time is spent alone since my dad works and my mum is either teaching me or subtly telling me all I'll ever be good at is being an Alpha's sex toy and carrying some rich man's heir.
I got out of bed and got dressed in a black suit. I did my hair before leaving the room. Thankfully it's Hogsmeade weekend so I will be able to meet my parents in town instead of having the headmaster set up a meeting. Avoiding everyone I went through the castle till I got to the entrance hall. I stopped when I saw Harry coming down the stairs with his parents. His head was down and he wore the same reveling dress as yesterday.
He lifted the veil and when he saw my face Draco pushed me to the floor. He yelled about how I wasn't Jamie and my heart shattered. I wasn't wanted my father had lied to me and deceived Draco.
Around 4:45 I heard Draco's garage door open so I quickly put the lasagna in the over knowing it would be ready in 45 minutes which was the amount of time draco took to shower and change. Soon Draco was walking into the house with all his grace kicking off his shoes.
Once dress I put on light makeup and some flats before leaving my room. Both my parents were dressed and looked impatient.
"Watch your mouth you snake," Lily snapped at my Father her face matching her ugly hair. It seemed impossible that such a beautiful Omega could come from such ugly people.
Lastly I cleaned Draco and I's bedroom. On a normal day I get up first then Draco who leaves his stuff everywhere. Somedays I want to complain, but I know I have no right considering he provides and takes care of the family. What he says goes.
"Whatever go wake up the Omega," my father said and I scrambled back into bed. I pretended to sleep scared of what she will do If I am out of bed already. When she came in I heard her shrilling voice telling me to wake up before she pulled me out of bed with my hair.
"Are you insane!" my mother screamed. "He clearly beat your brother, and you want to marry this man. Who knows what else he has done to my baby!"
My last pregnancy ended in a nasty infection which is why Draco had the surgery done. Ever since my immune system has been very weak. I keep getting sick and sometimes I wonder if maybe I'll die from a disease instead of Draco, although I'm not sure which I would prefer.
I felt disgusted with myself as I walked knowing people were staring at things they should not be. It made me feel unsafe knowing that if an Alpha attacked me my father could do nothing since he is a Beta and weaker. Even some Omegas are looking at me wrongly making me want to break down in tears.
When the Omega came in he had a smile on his face and a box in his hands. I  stared at him and he noticed my presence and froze. He lost all the color on his face and looked like he was about to break down in tears. Honestly, he is so emotional you would think he's on his period every day of the year. It's so easy to make him cry and although sometimes I find humor in it, it is also annoying.
I went into labor when I was eight and a half months pregnant. I had been laying in bed rubbing my big belly and talking to the little baby resting within me. I remember being so excited to have someone who would love me. My water broke and I was rushed to the hospital wing in Malfoy Manor.
"It's a symbol of my promise," he explained. "It's not a real flower so it will never wither. I am giving it to you so you have something to remind you of my promise to earn your trust. I know you have been through some stuff and it will be hard. But I like you and want you to trust me so I can help you."
When I woke up I was in my room again. I was still covered in birthing fluids and blood. When I looked to see where my baby was I didn't find him, I just found Draco sitting while reading.
"Of course I will," Harry answered and kissed him on the cheek before he also went to the train. As soon as it pulled out of the station tears began to form in my beautiful Omega's green eyes. Flora seeing this wrapped his arms around Harry's neck and gave him a wet kiss on his cheek making him giggle.
I went through the day like normal and finally, it was time to go meet Draco I changed into comfy clothes and went on my way. I went to the room of requirements and like the night before the door was already there. I walked in and instantly snuggled into Draco's chest.
I also wrote a letter to the ministry to set up a date to deal with Harry's parents. I plan to pull some strings to get it done as soon as possible. I want Harry to be happy and this needs to happen. He deserves everything in the world.
By the end of the night, I was dead on my feet. Draco took me home and helped me change out of my dress and into one of his shirts for bed. I laid down and closed my eyes feeling comforted when Draco crawled into bed and wrapped me tightly in his arms.
"He is not," I said to treasure him. "They abuse him though. They make him wear clothes he hates, and the amount of skin they show gets him inappropriate attention from rotten Alphas. They also starve him thinking he is fat, which he is not he is perfect."
I woke up at midnight from James' loud snoring and crawled out of bed. I went to go check on the Omega bitch only to see he wasn't in bed. I screamed in anger before composing myself. Normally when I wake up in the middle of the night I go find someone who knows how to fuck, unlike James, but today I will wait and punish the little whore.
"I love you too," he responded and kissed my forehead. We continued to dance with each other and other people. Since my parents are not welcomed Lucius filled in for the dance I should have had with my father.
Once I was ready I exited the room and met Blaise. Since my father is not coming Blaise will walk me down the aisle. Over the past few months, we have become close and he became the older brother I wished I had. He just smiled and led me to the garden that we are getting married in.
"I think we will take our leave," my Father said walking out followed by my mother than me. Once I bid them goodbye I went to my private dorm as head boy to get ready for the afternoon classes.
"That's okay baby," he said and sat up pulling me up as well to cuddle intl his side. "We will go at your pace. I just have one question."
"Albus," James butted in, "Usually I would agree but Hadrian is coming close to marriage age. He needs to learn how to be silent when he is below everyone else in the room." I felt my inner Alpha rage at the disrespect a father could show his Omega son. Omegas should be treasured by their parents. I know if I ever have an Omega child they will only ever be second to their mother.
It was one in the afternoon by the time I was done the housework. Feeling a bit tired today I decided to take a nap on the couch knowing better than to mess up the bed. Somehow Draco always seems to know if I've made the bed more than once that day. I ended up sleeping for an hour before my alarm woke me up.
"Harry it's dinner time," I heard my mother yell up to me. With a groan, I made my way downstairs and into the dining room. I sat in my usual chair in-between my parents and waited for them to be seated. "Tuck in," my mother said as she sat down.
Omega always cleans and cooks and tolerates the brats. Lately the idea of a baby with Omega doesn't seem as bad. At least Omega unlike Astoria wont beg mr to take time off and will do all the gross stuff. I'll just have to do the fun stuff. My only current concern is that he will let himself go after a baby. Omega is very pretty and has a beautifully curvaceous body although he's gained a bit of weight.
"I was to marry Jamie why was this hideous creature under the veil," Draco yelled as I tried to cover myself from the eyes of my father, the court, and Jamie the one who was supposed to get married.
"Shhh baby breath," he said and began kissing my neck. "It'll be okay just tell me when I can move."
"Of course," said Dumbledore with a twinkle in his eye, "It seems that your boys were messing around with Mr. Malfoy, and his Alpha magic overpowered your boys."
"I feel all Omega should leave the room before continuing," Dumbledore stated rudely while sending the little beauty a look of dislike.
"Well I have one month to prove I am worthy of your trust and I will not waste it," he said then hugged me gently. I hugged back and instinctually sniggled into his muscled chest with a content smile. "I have something for you."
"Not necessarily," he said slightly fearful. It was clear that he was afraid to lie and thought if I did I would hurt him. Although lying should not be tolerated I would never hurt him.
"Lucius, Narcissa, and Draco Malfoy meet Lily and James Potter," Dumbledore introduced completely ignoring the little Omega who hid behind the Devils' parents.
We arrived at the train station and people were everywhere. The kids were still not fully behaving but it was better than before. Harry held Flora in his arms as we made our way through the barrier.
"Should have thought about that before you snuck out," he yelled tightening his grip on the bitch as he dragged him.
"You wouldn't be happy to if you were put in dresses two sizes too small and forced not to eat because your mother thinks your fat. You wouldn't be happy if you were told all you'll ever be good for is being a sex toy since you you were six years old. You wouldn't be happy if you weren't allowed to go to an actual school. And you wouldn't be happy if your parents refused to get you everything you needed to make sure you safely go through heat." Sorry, he said after his little rant and a blush covered his cheeks.
I was signing a few papers when I heard a light knock on my door. The perks of being the head boy have my own space. I got up and opened the door to see Harry with tears on his face and a forming bruise on his cheek. I quickly pulled him into my arms and he broke down in tears.
I led him to my bed and cuddled him. When he finally calmed down I examined the large hand-shaped bruise on his face.
"That is impossible," James shouted in rage, "No Alpha is stronger than my boys. It is simply impossible."
"I guess that would be okay," I said hesitantly. I really want to get to know him, but I'm also afraid of being hurt. I know that I'm far from being the perfect Omega. He might not like me if he gets to know me. I'm honestly a loser with poor education and no self-esteem.
When my parents were in bed I changed back into my Onesie and snuck out. I went to the entrance hall as Draco said and he was already there.  He was still in his clothes from the day and had a rectangle box in his hand.
"I seem to have fallen for the youngest Potter," I said looking at them both to make sure they knew I was serious.
We stepped into view and I saw Draco at the end of the alter waiting for me. He looked perfect in his neat suit and slicked-back hair. He looked like the perfect Alpha.
"Finally, took you long enough," my mother snapped before walking towards the portrait door. We ended up walking to the great hall in silence and when we entered all eyes were on us. I felt extremely uncomfortable with all the stares. Many Alphas and male Betas stared at my butt specifically as we walked. I tried to pull the dress down as much as I could before sitting but it was no use.  We were sitting at the Gryffindor table and none of them hide their lust.
When dinner was finally over I went straight to my bedroom to change. I quickly put on a pair of black and white tye dye pajamas. Pajamas are one of the only types of clothing I'm allowed to pick for myself. Everything else except a few pairs of leggings and t-shirts is all of my mother's choosing.
From that night i ended up pregnant once again. I tried so hard not to bond with my baby, but it didn't work and my second sweet baby was taken from me before I could even touch her. It seemed my life went on a constant repeat from there. I've given birth to eight children and all of them thin Jamie is there mother. I'd probably be pregnant now if it weren't for the fact Draco had surgery done on me so I could no longer have kids.
"I can't it most likely won't end well," he stuttered making me irritated. I quickly pinned the bitch on his back and wrapped my hands around his delicate throat.
"Considering Draco has been proven the most powerful of his age and your boys are almost squibs I think it is possible," my Father told the man harshly while using his cane to add dramatics.
The next morning I was awoken by the yelling of my parents. It was odd since they never fight. I snuck up to my door and leaned against it so I could easily eavesdrop.
"Of course," I answered and flung myself at him. He smiled and took the ring out of the box and slipped it on my finger. I looked at it and smiled. He really does spoil me that is for sure.
"You should go get me some candy and vanilla candle," I told him and in seconds he was up and asking the room for the things I wanted.
I finished the letters and sent them to the right people. I was finally able to sleep when I finished. And it wasn't long before I had very hot dreams about my little Omega.
At 3:02 I heard Ida and Adaline's garage door open informing me that they are home from school. Both girls came in as well as an Alpha boy, two Omega boys, three Omega girls, and one male Beta.
I tried fighting unconsciousness as I began crying as I heard Draco say Jamie did a good job. He was treating Jamie like I should have been and acting like he gave birth not me. Eventually I lost the fight and fell asleep with tears running down my face.
"I love you too my beautiful Omega," I said and quickly kissing him before he went upstairs to relax.  I finished getting the kids ready having to use my Alpha voice once in a while. Once they were ready I went to my and Harry's room and found him fast asleep in our big bed. I went over to him and gently woke him up.
I woke up the next morning happy that Harry was willing to give me a chance. With a little help from my parents I know I can get him to trust me and fall for me in the next month.  My parents will most likely understand and help me without a doubt. For a while now they have been wondering when an Omega will catch my interest and one finally has.
"Sure," I responded before getting up. We walked towards the exit and silently made it to the portrait which leads to my family's rooms.
Even on tough days, I love my family more than anything else. And even after thirteen years see Harry as the most gorgeous person in the world and would still pluck out the eyes of anyone who looks at him the wrong way.
"Yeah," I whispered as he walked away. I rushed into my room and flopped on my bed. I had a smile glued to my face. An Alpha actually wanted to get to know me. Other than my brothers I have never been so close to an Alpha and it was nerve-wracking and exciting all in one.
"Are you even paying attention," my father snapped. "Clearly that's what's going on. I however refused to break the law and no one was gonna marry Harry."
When he finished using my body he left me bloody, bruised, and in tears. He locked me in the bedroom with no one to help stop the bleeding as I laid there terrified and confused. That night was the first time I fell asleep crying.
When he sat down it was clear just how uncomfortable it was. His mother is probably an uneducated swine and picked the dress thinking it would give him positive attention. In reality, most Alphas are possessive and only want themselves to see an Omega in such a short dress. An Alpha wouldn't feel comfortable with it unless they had a mating bite. After mated, we can tear apart anyone who wrongly looks at our Omega.
When I looked at Harry his eyes were glossy. He submissively kept his head down not saying a word. His response made it clear that this wasn't the first time he was publicly shamed because of his weight. He wasn't fat or anything just not a stick like most. He had curves and meat on his bones making him even more beautiful than an average stick.
The wedding for Jamie and Draco was planned for a week later. Every night that week Draco would come into my room and rape me and Jamie would watch as I screamed from the pain. During the day I would be locked in my room alone and sometimes a doctor would come in and make sure I wouldn't die from the injuries and that my ability to have children wasn't broken.
"Hey Beautiful," he said making me blush as I sat down beside him. He wrapped an arm around me and put a bookmark in his book to give me all of his attention. "How are you?"
"And who is the Omega hiding," my Mother thankfully asked so I didn't have to. In honesty, it would be disrespectful as an unmated Alpha to ask about an unmated Omega who has not made his presence known.
I reached for some steak that my mother had made but she smacked my hand away hard enough to leave a red mark. I next reached for some mashed potatoes but my mother smacked my hand away. In one last attempt to get anything to eat I reached for a roll and this time my father smacked my hand away.
I woke up with intense cramps in my stomach and a craving for sugar. I groaned at the situation knowing my period decided to grace me with her presence. Knowing if I didn't get dressed soon I would be punished if I didn't get ready. I just want to get back in bed with comfy PJs on than snuggle with Draco later, but no I have to do as I am told. I can't wait for Draco to set me free from this hell.
"Is there something you are looking for?" he asked kindly in a deep voice making me blush even more.
After breakfast, I locked myself in my room and changed into a fluffy onesie. I crawled into bed and cried. I cried because I felt like an object. I cried because I felt used. I cried because I felt sick from not eating. I cried because of the insults. I cried because of the stares. I cried and cried until I finally fell into a dreamless sleep because of emotion and because of how weak my body is
"Because maybe she can tell us if he was involved in sexual activity," he explained like he was some sort of genius.
"We should have gotten rid of him the day he presented," I heard my mother say in her banshee-like voice.
"Nowhere you need to be looking," I said confusing him more. He just stared at me for a minute before it clicked.
I was about to say something but couldn't get words out when I felt lips against mine. They were rough and gentle at the same time and it took me a minute to realize that I was having my first kiss. I then slowly started to participate as he continued to kiss me slowly. He pulled away for a second to take a breath before kissing me again with a little more force.
"Like hell," my mother yelled, "We are talking about an attack on my son and I refuse to leave. Just because I'm an Omega does not mean I am below a useless Beta like you"
When I saw the parents of the Potter twins walk in I didn't expect to see a beautiful Omega following them. He looked perfect with his curvy body that wasn't stick thin like most Omegas. His beautiful hair was pulled into a tight bun and by the size of it, he had a lot of hair. Out of everything though were his big bright green eyes that flashed with emotion. He is perfect and will be mine.
It has been three months since Draco has become dedicated to getting me pregnant and I don't think I've ever been so tired. I was currently laying on the couch even though I have so much to do. I just need a bit of sleep.
"Yes," I heard the healer say before she was in my sight. She had her wand and cast a spell over me, "Tu Virginem!"
After the wedding night Draco began coming into my room again. Jamie would also come in and watch sometimes participate. That changed three months later. I began getting extremely sick. Draco called a doctor and it turned out that I was pregnant.
"Shush bitch," Ida said as they headed towards the door. "You just close your pretty little mouth until Daddy comes home and wants you to sick him off." Already used to there treatment I just kept my mouth shut while they went upstairs. It took me almost a half hour before the mess was fully picked up again.
"At least it will give us a chance to find an Alpha for him," my mother bit out. "Harry, go to bed you will be up early to make you presentable before going to a place where so many respectable Alpha heirs are."
This year Abraxas will be a third-year and Scorpius will be the first year. We were currently getting ready to go to the station but Flora was throwing a tantrum. Delilah who is six was fighting with Bree who was seven none stop. And both Abraxas and Scorpius couldn't find all their stuff. The day was just getting worse and Harry was feeling awful since he started his period yesterday.
"Trust me it was deserved," the man said with a smirk. I wanted to protest, but I knew it would give him a reason to repeat what he did the night before.
"You look lovely as well Cissa," Harry said returning the taller Omega's hug. Harry and my mother began to talk and he clung to her as we began walking and they talked in a whisper. My father and I just followed out Omegas as we made our way to the courtroom. When we arrived Harry clung to me again instead of my mother who held my father's elbow.
It's been a month since Draco proposed and we are now getting married. Thanks to Draco's parents we were able to get a wedding planner quickly. I was in my and Draco's room as Narcissa helped me get dressed in my wedding dress. Only Draco's family and a few friends were invited keeping the wedding small. We didn't want anything big and wanted to get married as soon as possible.
My pregnancy wasn't an easy one. My morning sickness was horrible, but no one helped me as I constantly emptied my stomach. My cravings were super intense but never fulfilled. My body swelled and because my body is small I couldn't walk after month seven.
"You better not be whoring yourself out," I yelled realizing how bad it would be if he was. "A pureblood family pays a lot more for a virgin than a dirty used Omega. You better not have ruined my money."
My wake-up call the next morning was my mother dragging me out of bed at four in the fucking morning. It was easy for her to manhandle me since she was 5'7 and I'm only 4'10. She dragged me into the bathroom and washed my waist-length thick black hair. When she was done she dried it and pulled it into a tight bun before adding a crystal pin. She next caked my face in makeup that would later cause me acne.
"The little Bitch snuck out," I explained and looked over to Hadrian. He was shaking and hugging himself and clearly crying. Honestly, he is so weak. He can't take the truth.
I then moved onto the upstairs and began cleaning bedrooms, bathrooms, the library, and closets. While I was cleaning Adaline's bedroom I found some very inappropriate pictures of naked Omegas. Feeling a little disgusted I just left then where they were. I would talk to Draco about it later and he would decide what to do.
Draco pulled me off the floor and wrapped his large hands around my neck. I tried to pry his hands off me but he wouldn't loosen his grip. My vision became blurry and I couldn't breathe. If he hadn't dropped me I probably would have died on the day that was supposed to be the happiest day of my life, although maybe that would have been better. I tried to catch my breath, but he didn't give me a chance before he picked me up by the waist. He threw me on the bed and brutally assaulted me.
I just sat in the living room of the set of rooms we were given and read a muggle murder mystery novel. Most people think the only thing Omegas likes reading is cheesy romance, but that is far from the truth. It's the stereotypes that make me hate being an Omega, that and periods which are followed by heats. Alphas really don't know how good they have it because periods hurt and so do heats since I'm unmated. Being an Omega sucks.
"You have no baby," Draco said as he straddled me causing me to cry out in pain. "My son will be raised to think Jamie is his mother. You will only be the house whore. If he asks who you are I will tell him that your just his mother's slutty brother."
The next morning Draco stormed into the room startling me from my sleep. He didn't even let me get dressed he just wrapped a thin sheet around me. My body was in extreme pain as he threw me over his shoulder and carried me to the court room. Unlucky for me the entire court was assembled as he threw me on the floor causing the sheet to fall off my body.
"Maybe you should see a healer?" he suggested to which I agreed by nodding my head weakly. "Alright let's get you in bed and I'll call the healer."
"Kay," I answered as he picked me up bridal style. He carried me to our bed and set me down lightly. It didn't take long for me to fall back asleep even though I just woke up.
"Sure," I said and we started walking. We left the castle and started walking in silence till we reached the lake. There we sat by a tree not saying much.
"Why do you need a candle?" he asked once I had my candy. The candle was on the coffee table and he was lighting it when he asked.
It took me three months to healthily heal, and those were great months. No one defiled me or beat me, but as soon as my doctor said I was healed Draco raped me again along with many of the servants and other noble men. I fell asleep from the pain before they finished using me.
When I woke up the morning after our wedding I felt sick to my stomach. Draco was still asleep so I carefully slipped out of bed and went to the bathroom. Just when I thought nausea passed I threw up in the sink since I wasn't close enough to the toilet. After throwing up I crawled over to the toilet just in time to throw up again. I heard footsteps and saw Draco in the doorway.
By this point, it was clear they were talking about me. They have a habit of insulting me and treating me like an object so I shouldn't be surprised.
When the Potter Omega walked in I felt a waterfall of emotions. At first, I thought he looked sexy in the dress he was wearing. Then when I saw everyone staring at his ass I felt jealousy. Even though I have nearly met him I feel protective over him and want to dig out the eyes of every person looking at him with lust.
"I'm your Alpha and if I say your gonna get pregnant, you will," I growled and he nodded rabidly. I then choked him, not hard enough to kill him, but hard enough to make him pass out. Once unconscious I got to work making a baby not caring about his concerns or the fact he was unconscious.
"Shh baby," I said trying to calm him and soon he did calm down. "You can stay here tonight. Tomorrow is the trial. Why did he hit you beautiful?"
"How do I know I can trust you?" I questioned since I had been hurt too many times. I didn't want to trust him than have him stab me in the back and treat me like trash. No matter what my parents say I know I am more than just an Alpha's sex toy but if he walks all over me it means I'm weak. I already doubt my judgment and I don't want to make a mistake.
When he looked up I smiled at him before continuing my journey. When I got to town I went to the Three Broomsticks and went to my family's private room. Once inside I took out my two-way mirror so I could contact my parents and tell them to come and meet me. I tapped the screen and soon my mother's face appeared.
"Get me some whiskey," Draco commanded and I went to the cabinet of alchohol. I grabbed a bottle of his favorite whiskey and a crystal cup. I poured hima glass before giving it to him and waiting to see if he wanted me to do anything else.
As you know I have had feelings for Harry, the Potter Omega. Well, tonight he agreed to become my Omega and asked me to help him with something important. I have mentioned the abuse he has been suffering and he has agreed to let me help. I plan to get him emancipated since he is over the age of fifteen. I would like to know if it is okay for him to stay with you while I finish the last few months of my education. As soon as I finish you can follow your dreams and move to France. I will take my responsibilities and I plan to marry my Omega soon after.
My thoughts were distracted by Omega stepping out of the bathroom and going around to his side of the bed. He crawled into bed and curled up on his side of the bed knowing I wouldn't want to cuddle, he is so well trained. I mentally sighed before going over to him and wrapping my arms around his tiny body.
I sat in bed looking through my Instagram while the Omega got ready for bed. This Omega is way better than the first. The first Omega never made sure the house was clean or submitted properly. If it weren't for her sabotaging the condoms I wouldn't have the two demon spawn who are probably in there rooms having sex with the Omegas they brought into the house. When Omega originally asked for a baby I was scared he would find a way to get pregnant, but he didn't instead he behaved.
"I love you so much," he said and kissed me softly on the lips. I kissed back and soon was on my back with him over me. His hands began to wander under the hoodie I was wearing. His fingers danced over my skin as we kissed. I wrapped my arms around his shoulders as he pinched my nipples making me moan softly. When I felt him get hard I didn't panic like I did last time just continued to kiss the man I love.
We arrived at the Ministry where we would meet my parents then go down to the courtroom. Harry looked beautiful with his hair pulled back nicely thanks to me. He was dressed in a blue satin dress that unlike every other dress he ever wore was his choice. He stood close to me and clung to my arm. Everything about him was perfect except the bruise on his face.
My parents started talking about their own thing when a barn owl came flying through our owl door (don't question it). A letter with the Hogwarts seal dropped in front of my dad and he opened it. He was quickly out of his seat and scribbling a reply to whatever had come.
"He got the letter about the trial and blew up. He then hit me and I ran to you," he explained still very upset.
I got back to the castle with a box and went straight to my room. In the box was a gift that I want to give Harry as I symbol of the promise I made to myself and him to get him to trust me. I know that I can't just get him gifts and expect him to like me, but this was something simple and beautiful that I wanted to get him.
After the dishes I whipped down the counters, swept the floor, mopped the floor than moved on to the living room, and so on. It took me three hours to finish cleaning the downstairs. It was eleven when I finished so I grabbed an orange for lunch. As much as I was tempted to eat more Draco said I need to start watching how much I eat.
"You look adorable," he said with a smile as I approached him. When I reached him he leaned down and kissed my cheek making me blush.
"Alright enough," I said loudly stopping everything going on in the room. "Abraxas and Scorpius go get your stuff together without yelling at your mother. It is your stuff he should not need to keep track of it. Delilah and Bree go get ready to go and stay away from each other or both of you will be grounded. Now, what is Flora having a fit about?" The last question was directed towards my gorgeous Omega.
"Get away from him," Draco snapped and she backed away. "Your husband gave him to me. I will do as I please with the ugly slut." With every venomous word I wanted to cry more, but was running out of tears.
It has been a week since we arrived at Hogwarts, and I think my death is soon approaching. Half the time I have a headache because most Alphas don't seem to know how to suppress their sent.  Also, my mother keeps trying to show me off to high-class Alphas which is super uncomfortable. I have also been feeling nauseous. because all I am allowed to eat is leaves. When I say I might die I'm not over exaggerating.
"I hope to see you tomorrow," he said before kissing my cheek making my face become the ripest tomato ever seen.
I finished drinking my tea and went back into the large home we live in. I went into the kitchen to begin washing the dishes. Adaline and Ida couldn't decide what they wanted for breakfast causing more dishes  than necessary being made. It annoyed a little considering I'm the only one who does any house work, and I considered bringing the issue up with Draco, but he is already extremely busy with work.
When we got to the kitchen portrait I tickled the pear and we were let in. He had a look of wonder on his face as he looked around the room.
"Your welcome beautiful," he said and hugged me again letting me cry into his chest as I broke down. When I calmed down he carried me back to the castle then to my room before kissing my cheek and going to his room. With a blissful smile, I went back into the rooms only to come face to face with my mother who looked very unhappy.
Unlike most Alpha's I don't want my marriage to be only about sex and having someone else clean up after me. A lot of Alpha Omega marriages are like this. Thankfully my parents married for love and I wasn't raised in a toxic home. Pansy has two beta parents and is an Alpha so has never had an issue with Toxic parents. Sadly Blaise has had several step-dads but thanks to my parents he has similar views on marriage and bonding.
"Sit," Draco said patting his lap. I went over and lightly sat myself on one broad thigh so I could easily see hime and reach the table. "Feed us both," Draco said so I did.
"I think if we play our cards right we can marry him off to one of the Zabini boys," my father said calmly in contrast to my mother's rage.
"Yeah, I will," I answered with a smile. "Can you help me get out of my parents' custody? I know I said a month, but I want to be with you and they won't allow it."
"Oh this disgrace is Hadrian," Lily said with a sneer, "He needs to lose some weight before we can find him a proper Alpha." The way she spoke of him was sickening. They acted like he was an object, not a beautiful being.
"Well to put it simply," Dumbledore said, "no one is to blame. You Potters and even the Malfoys have permission to stay until Jaden makes a full recovery."
I and Harry have been married for 13 years now and have three Alpha sons, Abraxas Draco Malfoy and Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy. We have an Alpha daughter named Bree Narcissa Malfoy. And we finally have two omega daughters named Delilah Hadrian Malfoy and Flora Pansy Malfoy. After Harry gave birth to our youngest Flora who is two the healer said he would not be able to have another safe pregnancy. Harry was upset because he wanted more children but knew he could not risk the chance of him dying and leaving his kids.
"It's getting late would you like me to walk you back to your room?" Draco asked making me blush a little for no reason at all.
Without a word I got up and went to my room. I stripped to my panties before throwing in a clean t-shirt and climbing into bed.
I crawled into bed and got as comfortable as possible I was barely allowed to eat anything and my stomach feels like it's gonna shrivel up and die. It felt like a million kittens sinking their claws into your bare skin except inside my body. I should really find the kitchen in this place before I die. With determination, I crawled out of bed and slipped on some slippers. As quietly as possible I snuck out of the rooms and into the hall. From there I had no clue where I was going. Our rooms were on the fifth floor and I assumed that the kitchens would be closer to the great hall.
"Give me a month to earn your trust," he explained, "During this time I'll protect you and get to know you. In the end, if you trust me we will get you out of your parents' clutches and you can come stay with me."
aphrodisiac.” At Hermione’s gasp of horror Draco once again felt vindicated that she was the only one in the supposed Golden Trio to have a brain. “Mungo’s can’t do anything for him, who is he seeing? Girl Weasel still? Have whomever it is meet me at his place, I’ll drop him off.” Draco grunted as he strained to hold Harry upright, who was valiantly struggling to move to his knees so he could pay proper respect to the angel holding him in his arms. “Potter! Stop squirming! Stay still I need to apparate us to your flat.” Draco clenched his teeth as Harry managed to grab a hold of his belt and let out a guttural moan as his fingers slipped beneath his trousers, brushing clumsily against Draco’s warm skin.
“May I eat you open Harry?” Draco’s voice was rough and ragged from the deep throat fucking and both men shuddered in appreciation. Harry was squirming in combination of anticipation and nerves.
“If you wish to be commanded Potter you’re in luck. I insist you fuck me immediately and don’t you dare stop until you’re soft.” Draco gasps as the head of Harry’s cock buts up against his hole. Momentarily concerned about his choice of wording, Draco groans as his thoughts scatter as Harry slips his cock in and then keeps going, slowly but confidently, all the way to the hilt. Draco’s legs shake as he tries to remember how to breath while it feels like Harry’s cock has taken over his entire body. His lungs can’t seem to get enough air because Harry’s thrusting into them. He’s never felt this full in his entire life. Harry tilts Draco’s hips up to meet his thrusts and Draco’s suddenly aware of a very disconcerting noise, it’s a shrill scream of some kind that stops abruptly when Harry kisses him. Draco realizes it’s him making that dreadful noise. It’s embarrassing but he can’t seem to stop as Harry hammers into his prostate again and again and again. His nails scratch down Harry’s back trying to gain purchase as his head hits the arm of the sofa. That delightfully familiar tingle at the base of his spine lets him know he’s close, oh Merlin, he’s so close. He pushes up into Harry’s thrusts harder and begs Harry to fill him, to cum with him, to never stop fucking him.
Fenrir stood directly in front of him now, Draco could smell his fetid breath and swallowed hard, forcing the bile back down his throat. Greyback chuckled darkly at Draco’s obvious discomfort and with a punch, sent him spinning, and snapped the spell holding him to the ceiling. He crashed to the ground below and sprawled inelegantly on the grimy floor. His father’s shouts registered but the blow was so forceful Draco heard a persistent ringing in his ears. Propping himself up on his forearm he realized the ringing was incredibly loud, and all of the Deatheaters were silent as they looked around for the source of the noise.
Draco shook his head at his wet-behind the ears partner, he had faith that with more on the job experience Ernie would overcome his timidity and become more bold. As far as partners go it could be much worse. He could have gotten paired up with Senior Auror Sheckkleweed, the rotund lay-about that always reeked of boiled cabbage and for some mysterious reason shoe polish; the man’s shoes were always beyond scuffed so Draco had no idea how or why the man could smell like a product he very clearly never used.
, work done he was going to scream. Potter had to know all the answers to these questions, he literally
was drugged, not Potter; or perhaps he’d gotten mind-numbingly shit-faced at the Theo’s and this was just a drunken dream his pickled brain had cooked up for him.
“Please don’t cry, just let me love you.” As if it was the simplest thing in the world Draco mentally scoffs, then gasps as he feels Harry’s hard length nudging him. Draco opens his arms and spreads his legs for Harry.
“I’m very sure Draco. I’m in love you. Of course I want to be with you. Can we keep kissing? I’ve discovered I’m even more fond of it than I thought I’d be, and I assure you, I knew I’d love kissing you.”
“That’s one way of putting it.” smiling broadly he glanced up at Draco and kissed the man’s closed eyelids while rocking his erection into his hip. “Feel like ‘assisting’ me again?” Harry asked cheekily.
“You’re sure?” Draco asked suddenly, breaking the kiss, needing to know that his dreams were coming true and that he wasn’t about to wake up, alone and empty.
“Please Draco? Please, I’m so sorry! Please don’t be upset, I’m not. God I’m so grateful it was you. You’re so perfect. You have no idea.” Harry pressed open mouthed kisses on every available patch of skin as he crawled down Draco’s body. Forcing his eyes open, he had to check on Draco and make sure he was okay with this. Harry would rather die an excruciating death than hurt Draco.
Draco was speechless, barely breathing, desperate for Harry to keep talking, he felt like they were on the precipice of something life changing.
“Hermione said you want me, wanted me before you got doused with a lethal amount of sex stimulant. Is that true?? Potter,
He could feel Harry’s legs tense and back pull forward as Draco needed to lean backwards over him to evade a spell. Harry dropped to the ground and spun around to unleash Hell on the handful of Deatheaters that had been facing Draco, Draco in turn hurled three spells at the Deatheaters that had been up against Harry, that Draco now faced. More cracks sounded and just as suddenly as the skirmish began it was over. The conscious Deatheaters were bound and silenced by the Aurors that had just arrived, discussions were now taking place about trying to locate the few that managed to escape.
There was no way in muggle Hell that Granger meant what she just said. Draco must be hallucinating. Maybe
really what you want, then yes. I want you too.” Draco worried his lower lip between his teeth feeling horribly self-conscious and very aware of the fact that he was still naked.
60’s that somehow always smelled like boiled cabbage and shoe polish. No, Harry very much liked his partnership with Malfoy, they got along splendidly.
was were I belonged. Everything I had ever secretly hoped for, wished for, prayed for was real and by Merlin, it was amazing and incredible and beautiful and terrifying.
“please?” Draco whispers, not totally sure what he’s asking for, likely something completely unattainable, Harry leans down and takes his mouth, Draco gives it willingly. Harry’s hands smooth down Draco’s sides and tickle his hips lightly, he breaks the kiss to pay special attention to Draco’s neck again, laving it and nibbling it, then biting it while moaning, Draco wasn’t aware he’d been humping into Harry until that moment. Harry becomes more aggressive then and pulls Draco’s thighs up until his ankles are resting on Harry’s shoulders. Draco feels the hot head of Harry’s cock against his hole once more and this time, the look on Harry’s face says he’s done with teasing, thank Merlin.
Draco added a finger alongside his tongue, and continued to suck at Harry’s rim, working him open slowly but diligently. His own cock was hard enough to pound nails and the thought of finally sliding in to Harry’s warm, welcoming heat nearly did him in. Soon he was three fingers deep and Harry was honest to Salazar sobbing as he begged Draco to fuck him.
All too soon he felt the tell-tale tingle at the base of his cock, the unfurling heat tingling throughout his body, signaling that he was close. Taking Harry’s wet cock in his hand he was surprised to note that Harry had cum again, more than once while getting eaten out and fucked. Seeing the puddles of cum pooling on Harry’s chest and stomach made Draco’s orgasm hit him harder than a freight train, he gave a few tugs on Harry’s cock and pleaded with the man to cum with him, exultant when Harry screamed his climax right along with Draco.
“First things first, we have new equipment coming in from the Muggle Liaison Department. I’ve been informed these devices will aide in communication between partners and departments better and more efficiently than owls and memos. There will be a MANDATORY meeting after this to show you how to use these devices.
Pressing in with his index fingertip, he groaned as he felt Harry relax at the intrusion. He made it in to the second knuckle when Harry suddenly went completely tense and gave a great shudder, his mouth open on a silent scream as he came, literal loads down Draco’s throat. Moaning around Harry’s pulsating cock, Draco sucked every drop out of him, pulling back enough so that some could splash on his tongue so that he might be better able to enjoy the flavor.
?!” Draco was sure his teeth were going to crack from how hard he was grinding them. Hermione’s deep sigh, sent a twinge of foreboding up Draco’s spine and he shivered, chest heaving as he waited for the brightest witch of their age to come up with a suitable solution that didn’t involve Draco being arrested for molestation of his partner and Savior of the Wizarding World.
“Draco,” Harry says a little firmer, Draco lowers his hands and looks unflinchingly into Harry’s eyes, praying he can’t see the truth written all over his face.
“Fuck Potter! I love it when you do wandless magic, it’s so fucking hot.” Draco throws himself at Harry and they fall backwards onto the bed.
Regular inquiries and case reviews were done to ensure that Aurors were matched up with the best partner possible, so it was a common occurrence for new partnerships to be announced monthly, sometimes even on a case-by-case basis.
Draco felt the same exhilaration he did when astride a broom, chasing a snitch, his smile was feral as he dodged a vicious hex and returned two of his own in rapid secession. His back was to Harry and together they were so in snyc it looked like a choreographed ballet routine. All around them was complete chaos, but between them was a warmth to rival Fiendfyre. The smell of dark magic and hexes hung in the air, but Draco could still make out the subtle smell of Harry, his laundry soap, sweat, chocolate and broom polish that always made him breath a little bit deeper in the hopes of taking more of that scent into himself. It never failed to make his shoulders unclench and made his fingers itch to wrap themselves in Harry’s messy mop of hopeless curls. Draco realized with a start and a gasp that that smell was exactly what Amortentia smelled like to him. It was Harry. Of course it was.
Draco felt his eyes roll back in his head as the tip of his cock breeched Harry’s rim. By the God’s he was perfect. Merlin he was so tight and wet and hot, clenching around him like Draco’s cock belonged there. He wanted to go slow, make sure as not to hurt Harry, but the way Harry’s sweet hole was fluttering and Harry’s very insistent urgings, Draco couldn’t help the hip roll that caused him to thrust nearly all the way in at once.
“I’m not upset about this, honestly! I really meant what I said, about wanting you for ages and – bugger all Draco, you’re bloody perfect aren’t you?! Of course you’d be an amazing shag and,” Harry’s heart was beating a mile a minute, he was sure it was going to leap out of his chest and try to crawl it’s way into Draco’s so it could beat alongside his heart and feel at peace. At home. Inside of Draco. Harry moaned as the raging heat that had been banked since his last orgasm began to roar again. The thought of being inside of Draco was killing him. He needed that. Needed Draco still, again, he needed –
Head Auror Robards stormed into the briefing room after everyone else had already arrived. He threw a handful of papers at the board and they attached themselves under the appropriate space.
Harry really didn’t mind being partnered up with Malfoy, despite what everyone else thought. Harry liked to think he had matured since Hogwarts, that old school rivalries had no place following the now adults into their chosen profession. Being partners with Malfoy was great! He was wickedly smart and ridiculously anal about paperwork; he knew the handbooks and guides forwards and back and could recite seemingly every potion and the needed ingredients off the top of his head. He really was quite brilliant. Sometimes Harry liked asking questions he already knew the answer to because Draco would go on a long rant about it and include bits of anecdotal information that never failed to impress and make Harry smile.
“I guess we did this.” Draco said thoughtfully. Harry looked at him, waiting for him to explain further, as the golden light danced over and between their bodies.
, please, tell me it’s true.” Draco’s voice turned into whimpered pleas as Harry fastened his mouth onto Draco’s neck and began sucking hungrily at his sensitive skin.
“Of course I’m not going anywhere. I’m right here, where I want to be. Where I need to be.” Draco murmurs as he peppers tiny kisses across Harry's cheeks, Harry was unaware he’d voiced his concerns aloud. He grunts his acceptance of the words and kisses his way down the column of Draco’s neck, he stops when he can feel Draco’s pulse wildly thrumming and sucks the spot to further reassure himself that Draco is there, alive and safe in his arms.
Draco was vaguely aware of Harry pleading and begging Draco for more, for less, for everything and he smirked against Harry’s sternum as he kissed and nibbled his way down towards the impressive tent in Harry’s trousers. Unbuckling his belt and vanishing his shoes, Draco hurriedly removed the rest of Harry’s clothes and sucked in a ragged breath at the sight before him. Harry’s erection was beautiful, if angry looking, the head was nearly purple in his need to cum, copious amounts of pre-cum oozing from the slit made Draco’s parched mouth water. It was honestly the most perfect looking cock he had ever seen, which of course Perfect Potter would have a Perfect Penis. Unable to stop himself he licked a strip from the base to the leaking tip, moaning in ecstasy at the salty-sweet taste of Harry’s cum, he opened his mouth and devoured Harry’s thick cock. Harry’s whimpered and breathless pleas turned into incomprehensible screams of tortured pleasure. Draco gathered the gist of them as Harry’s thighs tightened around his head and Harry’s hands tugged Draco’s hair, urging his aching cock deeper into Draco’s welcoming throat. Draco focused his breathing and swallowed around the thick, perfect cock in his mouth, loving the feeling of Harry fucking his throat, his hips pistoning up roughly, slamming into Draco’s face. Draco was drooling so much that his fingers slipped from the base of Harry’s cock and slide down below his full sack, to the tight furl behind them. Massaging over Harry’s hole, Draco needed to rut against the sofa cushions to get some much needed friction against his own aching cock. He could feel his pre-cum soaking into the couch, making the glide a little smoother. What he really wanted though was at his literal fingertips so brought his mental focus back to the task at hand.
The heat engulfs him and for a moment he’s sure that dingy basement had in fact caught on fire and he is currently burning alive, his hips arch off the bed as Harry swallows him whole, all the way to the base. He has no words or thoughts as the wet, warm slide of Harry’s tongue and mouth work Draco to the edge of oblivion. He can’t possibly not cum. It’s too much, too perfect, too “HARRY!!!!!!” he screams as the orgasm rips through his body, he cries out as he shudders helpless against the onslaught of sensations. Harry is still sucking every drop out of Draco, like he wants to take his very soul out though the tip of his dick, well so be it, Draco thinks, he would gladly give everything he has, is or was to Harry if it would make him happy.
Harry had felt out of sorts and feverish before, now that his lips were touching Draco’s he felt steadier, but when their tongues came together in a silken slide, hungry and sure, the mild fever became a raging inferno the likes of which Harry had never experienced. He pushed himself into Draco, desperate to get as close as he physically could, their legs parting instinctively for the other until both could rut against each other in a poor attempt at reducing the pressure on their aching cocks.
, make Draco weak in the knees to see Potter coming back from a boxing spar, disheveled hair looking like he’d been properly shagged,
Fenrir Greyback, the monstrous werewolf prowled towards Draco, nose in the air, inhaling deeply, a cruel smiling showing his lethal incisors, he could smell Draco’s fear and judging by the bulge in his trousers, he was enjoying it. Draco tried the calming techniques his therapist had suggested to him when he felt a panic attack coming on, but the crude laughter of the Deatheaters surrounding him was making it difficult for him to find his center.
Draco sprang up from where he’d landed and was immediately at Harry’s side, Harry took a fraction of a moment to caress Draco’s bruised cheek, his eyes showing concern and longing, before anger claimed them, Draco shivered as he felt Harry pulling his magic to the front, in the next instant spells were being fired off all around them, his father had managed to snag a wand from someone and was holding his own on the other side of the room.
This was everything he had ever wanted, right here, in his arms and he would be damned before he let it go. Clutching Harry tightly Draco put everything he was feeling into the kiss and prayed Harry would understand what Draco was wordlessly saying.
” Draco was about to pull his hair out, when a clutch of flowers in the corner of the room caught his eye. He suddenly felt like he’d been dunked in ice water. The flowers in question were wilted and hadn’t been dried properly before being used in a potion and these imbeciles were going to get someone, likely Potter, killed!
“Up the arse Harry, where else would you put it??” Draco replied snarkily, rolling his eyes at the receiver.
Draco murmured a lubrication spell as he sat up on his knees. Harry’s pupils had taken over his eyes, only a faint line of green was visible and his reddened face was completely flushed, sweat pouring off of him to mix with his tears. Draco thought he had never looked more beautiful and leaned down to kiss him. Harry opened to his kiss and their tongues worshipped each other, Harry sucked on Draco’s tongue as he whined high in his throat, his hips canting upwards, trying to find some kind of release.
“…………...” Harry was absolutely positive, without a shadow of a doubt, that the fires of Hell were cooler than his currently flaming cheeks.
Ron’s new partner Olivia Havvers was quite competent, Draco had worked with her on a case and could find no fault with her work ethic, but there was something about the two of them, they had an ease between them, it was an effortless kind of communication that Draco was, well, not jealous exactly, but being in the same briefing room as them made him feel slightly wistful at how well they not only got along, but interacted with one another, small smiles and jokes, easy banter, doing little things to make the day easier for the other, remembering how the other took their tea, their favorite treat from the cafeteria. It seemed like they had a true partnership and friendship.
“Damned right it is.” Harry couldn’t stop the ridiculous grin from spreading across his face as he pictured Malfoy’s absolutely perfect peach of an arse. The tailored trousers he wears should be illegal, but then Harry would be deprived of getting to see that spectacular bum. His thoughts dissolved completely as the mental image of getting to arrest Malfoy and then frisk his impossibly delicious rear end take up all his mental faculties.
The gentleness fades then, replaced with hunger. Harry bites Draco’s lip making him gasp, Harry slips his tongue into Draco’s mouth and begins to duel him for dominance even as he pulls out and thrusts deeply into Draco’s ass. All Draco can do is hold on, he gives Harry everything he is, to take, to have, it’s his, it’s all for Harry, beautiful, perfect Harry, who loves him.
Still, Draco was rather surprised how often Potter got a new partner, he had assumed it would be him and the— Ron for life, but they only worked together on one case before the were separated.
“Merlin’s sake Potter, you haven’t got more sense than a first year! No self preservation skills at all!! How you haven’t died by now is a literal mystery to me.” Draco huffed and scowled at Harry, but he was genuinely concerned, the effects of the aphrodisiac weren’t usually this fast acting, he could be allergic to something the counterfeiters had added to the mix. Wouldn’t that just be his luck.
“If you’re lying,” Draco’s voice was thick with an emotion he didn’t much feel like exploring right then, so he cleared his throat and tried again, talking over whatever assurances Hermione was trying to give. “If you’re lying, and he wants revenge in the morning, I’m telling him this was your idea.” with that declaration, he ended the call, slipped the phone into his cloak and clutched Potter –
Harry had not been looking at the laxative tincture. He had found an odd bottle of a viscous fluid that shimmered golden in the light. Harry had thought it rather pretty and had absentmindedly picked it up, not noticing that the bottle wasn’t sealed properly and was leaking. Getting the strange potion on his hands he asked Draco what it was, hoping it wasn’t anything serious. Draco’s response caused Harry’s hand to shake and he spilt a bit of the unidentified liquid onto himself.
“Oh yes, I got rather tied up I’m afraid,” was Draco’s very cheeky response, his father smothered a chuckle and rolled his eyes.
Draco felt like he was drowning. He had taken Harry’s virginity, after he had been drugged! What kind of monster does such a thing to their partner!? Someone who trusts them! Someone they lo –
Grabbing pillows Harry urges Draco’s hips up higher and reaches under him to hold onto his shoulders as he forcefully thrusts into Draco, pistoning in and out of him. He keeps hitting Draco’s prostate and Draco keeps screaming, he can see stars bursting behind his closed eyes and he couldn’t have given a single solitary shit if the world had ended then and there as long as Harry didn’t stop fucking him. He’s going to cum and he wants to, desperately, but Harry hasn’t told him he could and more than he wants air in his lungs, he wants to make Harry happy.
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and nuzzled into the man’s neck, nibbling on the rapid pulse point, smiling when Draco whimpered softly.
“Has no one every sampled Harry Potter’s Perfect Pucker? I’m shocked and outranged on your behalf. Please allow me to correct this egregious oversight?” Draco raised a perfectly arched eyebrow and seemed to be waiting for Harry’s permission?
Harry reluctantly releases Draco’s softening member, but gives it a long lick from base to tip as he sets his sights to something a little lower. Draco’s only warning is the overly satisfied groan before he feels Harry’s lips and tongue on his puckered hole. He gasps nonsense words as Harry’s tongue drills into him over and over again, it’s soon replaced by a finger that curves just so and immediately finds the spot that makes Draco scream. His cock is back to being fully awake, he feels that Harry has cast more wandless and wordless spells, a cleansing, a stretching and lubrication spell all hit as Harry keeps hitting Draco’s prostate. Draco feels the telltale tingle and begs Harry to fuck him, please, please, please. He’s whining and writhing on the bed like a bitch in heat and he doesn’t care, not at all, not if it means he’ll get to have Harry’s cock in him, please Salazar!
“Now for the next order of business. We have a few high profile cases on the docket and I’ve decided to put our best on these. Malfoy!” Draco snapped to attention at the bark of his name.
“their souls form a bond. This is a soul bond....You were telling the truth when you said you loved me, and I realized that I, ---“ Draco stumbled over his words and looked at Harry. Harry turned and looked at Draco and waited for him to continue. Harry was his soulmate. There was no need for worries or insecurities or doubts of him not being good enough, Harry’s magic, his very essence had determined he was good enough, worthy enough. It was as humbling as it was thrilling.
“The potion wore off awhile ago.” Harry confirms what Draco had been dreading. All of this was because of that damned potion. How was he supposed to go on from this? How was he supposed to live his life knowing,
Harry wiped his wet hand on his sweaty brow, then grimacing, rubbed his hand on his trousers, unthinkingly, readjusting his growing interest in mental-Malfoy’s make believe moans.
; it’s honestly so fucking hot. And you’re so bloody brilliant! Godric, I could listen to you rant about policies and procedures forever. Your voice,” a groan and a shudder escape Harry as he ruts his weeping cock against Draco’s semi hard length. “Your voice sounds like how liquid luck tastes; smooth as silk, warm like molten gold,” Harry couldn’t stop thrusting against Draco as he sang his praises, desperate for release and for Draco to understand him. “Filling me with the absolute certainty that I’m all powerful, indestructible, invincible, as long as that is what you will allow. Draco, I’m yours. Absolutely yours. Yours to order at will, to command, use me as you like, however you see fit, but for the love of Merlin
Both his parents and himself had been pardoned by the testimony of one Saint Potter, Conquering Hero, Savior of the Wizarding World, Destroyer of Voldemort, Order of Merlin First Class, Titled up the Arse Lord of All, really the titles were excessive, Draco did his best not to acknowledge the heat that curled in his belly as he thought of the immense power those titles inferred. Harry had always been a powerful wizard, but since defeating The Dark Lord; Draco couldn’t suppress the shiver of excitement that always ran through him when he thought of Potter now, just standing in the same room as him made him lightheaded, the power radiated off of Harry even just standing, simply *being*. It was the strongest aphrodisiac there was, the smell of Harry, the feel of his magic. Draco nearly moaned aloud thinking about the time Harry had cast a series of wandless, wordless spells in front of him, Draco had very nearly cum right there.
He was too hot, was he actually on fire? He might be on actual fire, that would explain the heat coursing through him, pouring over him in waves. He felt so dizzy and as though there wasn’t enough air in the world to properly fill his lungs. He could vaguely hear someone yelling, but his hearing was distorted, the person sounded too far away.
“Ohhhh but I did die once, came back though, still too much to do. You for insistence. Mmmmmm I’d really love to do you.” Harry slurred and gave what he was sure was a very enticing wink while he tried to lean toward the glorious angel seductively, but apparently his legs forgot how they worked and he fell gracelessly onto the beautiful creature in front of him.
Potter keeps thrusting until he gradually slows to a near stop. I stare at him in confusion and he grips the leg around his waist and moves it to match the other over his shoulder, bending me in half and pressing in deep. I moan loudly, “
Part of me, shocked to hear such a tone come from him, wants to pull him close, but the rest of me is seething. Tough luck. “Get out of the way.”
, Potter,” he chides as he pulls my Auror robes off yet again, before hanging them up in the closet by the front door. He crosses back to me and holds out his hand before meeting my gaze with expectant eyes. “Well?” I take his hand and we Apparate into an alley outside the Muggle restaurant we’d chosen for our date night. We walk hand-in-hand to the place and I simply can’t help all my sidelong glances at the beautiful idiot. He really is a daft prat, but he’s a daft prat who’s finally willing to admit he loves me. He’s
Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived Twice, the Savior, the Golden Boy, the Chosen One, the fittest bloke in the whole of Britain. The boy whose attention I’d craved since I’d first laid my eyes on him. And he was kissing
Almost as soon as I’ve jerkily pulled the robes back on and crossed back to the Floo, Draco scrambles to stand in front of the flames, barring me from leaving. “Harry,” he croaks.
have those blasted N.E.W.T.s to sit. My passage is tight and I can actually see Potter’s eyes darken at the feeling of my body clenched tightly around him. “You’re so tight,” he says, almost in wonder, staring at his finger, which is now moving further inside, dragging another moan from my lips. His first finger bottoms out and after a few more slides in and out (“fuck,
The last thing I see is his stupid happy grin before he continues his vicious pounding rhythm and my vision whites out, and it only takes another few strokes before I’m coming, completely untouched (which has
“No!” His hand darts out, long fingers wrapping tightly around my wrist before it can reach the bowl on the mantle of the fireplace. “Stay! Please.” I stare at him, taken aback by the full-on panic corrupting his handsome features. “I’m sorry. Please stay. I love you, Harry,” he blurts out, eyes widening seemingly in surprise at his own words, and I can’t fight the smile that breaks across my face. My reaction seems to soothe some of his anxiety and he loosens his grip on my wrist to entangle his fingers in mine. His eyes still betray the worry he must be feeling, however. “Stay,” he repeats again.
If I’m honest, I wasn’t really paying attention to the game. I was sitting, like a stupid sentimental fool, happily thinking about how far I’d come, my family had come, since the end of the war. Things weren’t always so nice; early on the Malfoy name was synonymous with dirt. But with Lucius (I stopped calling him Father after he begged me to take the Mark, to right his mistake, to appease our Master… you can understand why) Kissed by a Dementor, soulless in Azkaban, Mother and I were free to partner up and strike the field with well-timed donations, apologies, and genuine sorrow and remorse. The remorse was hell.
to sneak to my quarters. We’d been friendly throughout the year and had even had moments suggestive of something more, but nothing had developed. It didn’t mean I didn’t
He kneels up and I cringe again at the whimper I make at the loss of his weight, but then watch in wonder as he inches down my body, settling between my legs with a wicked grin on his face.
“Oh, you mean now you’ve finally decided you’re ready to give your life outside that miserable office the luxury of your attention?” he snaps.
“P-Pott-” I choke out, but he just grabs me up as if I’m weightless and deposits me on the bed. I go limp in his grip. I know I am completely under his control, at his mercy, and if the twitch in my cock is anything to go by, I love it. “Potter... please.”
Soon he begins to snore quietly and I settle into a comfortable position in his arms. “It’s only ever been you, too, you know,” I whisper.
All too soon, a gentle push on my chest broke me from the fantasy and I opened my eyes to see his mischievous darkened ones gazing into mine. Whooping sounds could be heard around us but it seemed I was stuck in a bubble, a perfect bubble of time with Harry James Potter, the most gorgeous, perfect creature to ever fucking grace the planet. Who was staring at me like I was something he wanted to
“What, Draco? What do you want?” He presses my back down on the mattress and straddles my hips, settling himself on his hands and leaning down to whisper the words in my ear.
He gazes at me in what honestly looks like adoration before inching back up and kissing me gently. I grunt in frustration for a second until he abruptly grabs my leg, hiking it over his shoulder, and pressing his slicked cock to my rim. His dark eyes burn into mine as he pushes past the muscle, sliding inside, way made easier by the slick. It’s still so tight, and it burns, but I love it. I know I’ll feel this for
tells me they landed in their destination: the hamper. Private quarters for the Eighth-year students was definitely an appreciated privilege. My mind swims through the day, maybe in an attempt to discover how I could’ve possibly gotten myself into my current situation.
“Prick,” he snaps, but frees my hand to wrap his arms around my waist and pull me to him. I lean automatically to press my mouth to his, kissing him tenderly. The rest of the tension pours out of him (and I’m feeling pretty content at this point, too, honestly) and I smile against his lips as he melts into me.
. I moan into his mouth and eventually he lets up for air. “Want you so bad,” he says, his voice strained. He rolls his hips against mine in a slow, punishing rhythm.
happened before, might I mention), from Potter’s brilliant prick. I gasp and moan and cry out intelligibly, feeling myself clench around him until he stills, groaning loudly into my ear as I feel him coming deep inside of my body.
”) before prodding even lower. A magic-slicked finger circles my rim and my back arches off the bed, thrusting my cock into the back of his throat. He relaxes his throat immediately and pulls off to look up at me, grinning stupidly. “You’re so pretty when you beg, Draco,” he says, before pressing the tip of his finger inside the ring of muscle. I gasp. It’s been a few weeks since I’d used anything more than fingers inside or a hand on my cock for a wank; toys take time, and I
This was the point at which all the blood in my head must have evacuated and headed south, leaving my brain defenseless against something of this caliber. I barely remember scraping out the affirmative reply.
The public outcry was becoming more and more vocal until a word from their beloved Hero swayed them. The testimony from their trial hadn’t been made public, until Potter had issued a statement imploring the Wizarding community to stop the undue hatred and respect his wishes to leave Voldemort’s legacy of hate and racist fear mongering in the grave where in belonged. He had gone on to express his approval of the Malfoy family and how difficult it had been living with that madman, doing everything they could to appear as if they were on his side while helping the Light and the Order; that if it hadn’t been for Draco and Narcissa lying to the Dark Lord’s face Harry and consequently everyone else would be dead. With the support of Harry Potter himself and the rest of the Golden Trio, the Malfoy’s were grudgingly being accepted again. At least enough so that mother could go shopping without being hexed and he could get accepted into the Auror training program. He was sure his acceptance there was once again due to Harry’s benevolence. But that didn’t stop Draco’s desperate need to prove his worth, either to others or to himself. He immersed himself in Muggle culture, with some help from Granger, he incorporated bits of Muggle magic into everyday life, one such item being a cell phone, every Auror now had one and everyone had everybody else’s number. It was much more convenient then sending owls or notes, especially while on missions.
“I say we kill them and move on. We need to get out of England.” One of the weaker Deatheaters whined.
“I thought we were going to meet at the restaurant at 7?” Poor Harry sounded so worried, it made Draco’s heart melt, if he got out of this alive he was going to do everything and anything in his power to reassure Harry the validity of his feelings for him, in absolutely filthy ways.
“He’s been trying to work up the courage to tell you, but he’s terribly self-conscious and worried that you’d think he was having a laugh…He wants you Draco. He’s – you’re all he talks about, thinks you’re brilliant,
Draco felt the floor give out beneath him, he actually had to look down to make sure he was still standing on the ugly green tile of the locker room floor and not floating in the ether. He had heard that a witness had testified on his and his mother’s behalf, but he hadn’t been told who that witness was, just told they had wanted to remain anonymous. Of course it would be St Potter, Hero of the Downtrodden, coming to his rescue on a white bloody charger.
His phone! Sweet Circe he’d forgotten all about it!! He reached into his pocket and pulled it out, relief so swift and pure poured into his veins as he saw *Daddy* ;D flash across the screen. The Deatheater closest to Draco saw the name and looked questioningly at Lucius and then turned back to Fenrir with a baffled look on his face.
He comes to sometime later in a bed, with a human octopus attached to him. He smiles fondly as he runs his fingers through Harry’s curls. Harry nudges his head up a bit, following Draco’s fingers, sighing in contentment.
Draco surged forward, wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck and pressing them tightly together as their tongues dipped and danced with one another.
“And where does this go Malfoy?” Harry asked, innocently enough, looking at the various potion bottles.
He couldn’t ponder that any longer as Fenrir grabbed him by the throat and started squeezing. Just then an inordinately loud boom of apparition was heard and there in the middle of the room stood a thunderous Harry Potter. Much softer cracks of the smarter Deatheaters apparating out of the room could be heard above the screaming of the slower Deatheaters. Fenrir had tossed Draco to the side and charged like an enraged bull at Potter, while falling Draco had whipped out his wand and fired an Incarcerous at Greyback’s legs, tangled he tripped and slid the rest of the way towards Harry, who looked down at him like a bug to be crushed under his heel, with a heartless sneer and a careless flick of his wrist Greyback was simply gone.
