Oh, if his father could see him now. His only son and heir, dressed in black shorts, a white tank, Ray-Ban sunglasses perched on top of his head, and white trainers with tennis socks, he’d positively AK himself. Which was exactly the reason why Draco was currently on his own personal little vendetta in the middle of an open-air rave in Kreuzberg.
“Ooh, someone from Harry’s dark and mysterious past,” a guy with sandy hair and tattoos all over his arms and legs quipped. Someone groaned, “Please, don’t start guys.”
Potter started hacking. Draco smirked. Score.
“Calm your hissy fit, Malfoy,” Potter guided him forward. Draco was about to give him a piece of his mind when his hands trailed down to Draco’s wet shoulder blades, his thumb stroking the small space between his shoulders. Draco shivered. Oh Circe’s tits. He was in trouble.
“Yes?”
“Ehr, yes, because, I may have … forgot to take… it… off…?”
Draco withdrew his fingers and Potter’s nostrils flared.
Draco gulped. Now, that wasn’t fair. When had Potter become so
“Are you actually insane?!” Draco whirled around, this close to shoving Potter into the crowd. Water was running over his eyes, getting into his ears and dripping down his neck. A few catcalls and filthy whistles resounded around him. Potter laughed, his eyes flashing.
“Tanja, stop it,” Potter told her, ruffling through his hair and messing it up even more. “Malfoy, let’s go before you bond with my friends and I’ll never hear the end of it.”
“Malfoy!” Potter yelped, “you utter lunatic.”
Potter had never directed this laugh at him before. His laughter was a bright, clear sound that unspooled an old, tightly strung thread in Draco’s chest. Oh, great. What brilliant timing for his old Potter obsession to kick back into full force.
“Oh, yeah,” Potter rubbed his nose with his thumb, as he steadied his bike and grinned. „This is Draco, he’s someone I know from back home.” Potter made it sound as if their shared history could be encapsulated in “I know him from back home”. Draco snorted.
Potter kissed him. Hard. He smelled wonderful, salty with sweat and musk. His naked chest pressed against Draco. Draco slid his arms around Potter’s neck and pulled him closer. Potter’s mouth was brilliant, soft, hot, wet and, oh yes, greedy. He nibbled on Draco’s lower lip before he tugged it with his teeth. Draco grabbed his shoulders. Potter’s finger slipped under his shirt. Draco groaned, which Potter took as an invitation to lazily slide his tongue into his mouth. Not that he was complaining. Potter and tongues were an incredibly good idea. Oh, and that hand ghosting down his stomach as well.
“Don’t mind them,” he said, mouth close to Draco’s ear. ,Let’s go, I need another beer.”
“Nice meeting you, Draco,” she smiled, shaking his hand while holding a joint between two tattooed fingers.
“Today Potter? I’m waiting.” He palmed him softly. Potter breathed hard through his nose.
“And why would someone who is not in the Aurors anymore forget to take off a trace on a good-standing,” here Potter snorted, “member of society?” Draco pressed, annoyance already futile at the sight of Harry submitting so beautifully under him.
Draco sniffed. “I’ll have you know, I look absolutely dashing in glitter.”
This meant various trucks ahead blasting ear-splitting techno music. Ahmed, gorgeous, tousled black locks, glitter on his chest dusted with inky hair, danced next to him. He was the son of a Turkish-German ambassador, whom Draco had met on a Ministry function in London. Ahmed had invited him to Berlin,
„Ehr, it, well,” Potter licked his lips. “It might’ve gone off when you came to Berlin?”
“Ehr, it’s a small world?” Potter offered.
“Well, you see, no one’s ever told me there’s a city full of men gagging for cock right outside England,” Potter shouted back. He raked his eyes over Draco’s face. Shit. Potter’s eyes narrowed.
“Kidnapping?” Potter threw his head back and laughed. “You’re mad as a hatter, Malfoy.”
“May I?” Draco said and felt Potter’s gaze heavy on him as he took a deep drag. Draco locked gazes with him as he exhaled the smoke into his direction.
Draco bristled, fingers itching to pinch the idiot right into the soft skin of his balls.
, sparkled mischievously and he rolled his hips against Draco’s.
“Who’s your friend?” A darkly tanned guy with a Spanish accent, long curly brown hair, an enormous beard, in shorts and
“I mean,” Potter said, “who else has your poncey voice and blond hair? Seriously, if you don’t want to be found, you should have just glamoured yourself, Malfoy.”
Draco stared at him. It took him a few seconds before he got over his outrage.
“What the hell?” Ready to give whoever had grabbed him a good dressing down, Draco whirled around.
Potter looked mulish all of a sudden. Yeah, that was more like the Potter he knew from school: angst and broodiness engulfing him like a maelstrom. It messed with Draco’s head quite a bit. Broody Potter had always been sexy, he’d come to know that the first time in fourth year during the first task with the bloody dragons. Potter’s tournament uniform and scowling face had haunted him for a while. Which meant, they had been the most efficient wank material.
“You keep him, Hazza, I like him!” The girl named Tanja called after them. Draco winked at her.
A hand yanked him back between the writhing bodies. Ahmed was instantly swallowed up by the crowd. Great. There went his delicious shag.
“Besides, even without the trace, honestly, it’s not like it’s hard to recognize you,” Potter added defiantly. Draco raised his eyebrows.
Fuck Lucius and his fucking pureblood shite. Four years after the war, Draco had no bone in his body left not disillusioned with wizarding Britain in general and the social circles his family fraternized with specifically. No. No more lunches with Lucius simpering with doddering politicians, afternoon teas with the lovely Lady Greengrass or nightly gatherings with the leftover riff-raff of Voldemort’s cronies, crying into their scotch over the unjust treatment (read: prosecution), by the Ministry. As if something else had whiplashed them into following the megalomanic other than their humongous sense of entitlement. No. This was much better.
No way. The stream of half-naked, beer-swigging, slow-dancing people pushed past as he stared into Potter’s brilliant green eyes. Potter, who was grinning cheekily at him. Potter, who had thrown a magnificent ten consecutive Daily Prophet issues strop a year ago and turned reclusive. Potter, who had apparently fucked off to fucking Berlin, lost his glasses and, oh hello, even his shirt. Oh no. Draco swallowed and wet his lip as he took in the broad tanned chest and shoulders. Potter’s delicious muscled legs clad in red running shorts and, oh god, were those abominations on his feet sandals? Draco peeled his eyes off Potter’s glistening sweaty chest and damp hair curling at the nape of his neck.
They sat to rest on the pavement after extracting themselves out of the dancing crowd, both cradling another beer bought at a kiosk behind them.
“Well, let’s shelve that for later,” Potter evaded, the devil, and rocked his cock against Draco’s palm impatiently.
“It’s tolerable,” he sniffed as an empty beer bottle rolled by, leaking booze all over the place. The streets .
Potter looked thoroughly embarrassed now, though his cock was very much enjoying Draco’s fondling.
“Harry, calm down,” Draco says, gesturing to the space beside him, “you would’ve asked anyway and you probably understood it more by watching it.”
Draco hesitates for a moment before his own familiar smirk grows on his face, “brilliant,” he says in a voice to match Harry’s.
Harry gives in and moves his body with Draco, letting the smile that wanted to come onto his face grow and actually enjoy the moment that they were sharing.
And with that, Draco begins to work, an almost silent hum filling the empty air around him.
Harry steps out of the fireplace, to see a warm living room, filled to the brim with comfortable furniture and a familiar feel.
“Harry Potter, 37.” Draco looks between the hospital paramedic and the man in the bed, finally seeing the lightning scar on the famous man’s forehead. The famous Harry Potter could either live or die according to him, and is that a pressure he wanted?
Before long, a voice announces that the elevator has reached the Auror offices, and he quickly walks off, glad to be less cramped. He goes down many hallways, looking at each door, trying to decide which one would be the most appropriate to go through. He comes across Kingsley Shacklebolt’s office. Tapping lightly three times on the door, he hears a quiet ‘come in’ and he opens the door to see Kingslley sitting at his desk in a contemplative position.
“I don’t know Albus, I-I don’t know what to do. I mean, we could move in with Mum, or maybe Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron, or-”
“I’ll be back, just stay here,” Draco says, dashing around the corner in a rush, but his face reappears around the wall for a moment, “and wipe the drool off your chin.”
“Yes, Mrs Potter, if that is in fact your name now,” he says cautiously, shoving his hands into his pockets.
“Dad!” Lily yells, running at her father with pure joy and leaping onto his bed in the same fashion as Albus. Ginny smiles and walks forward, while Draco stands further away.
“Yeah, yeah I’m good,” he responds as he straightens up, regaining his balance. They continue to walk, until Harry feels a hard surface brush against his arm, almost like a doorway.
“Really?” Scorpious shouts, before jumping into his Dad’s arms, “thank you so much!” Draco chuckles and they go back over to Albus to give him the good news.
Maybe he has changed.
“Amazing. There was flying food, and there were things called Nifflers.”
“Draco. He was helping me look for Albus and was trying to calm me down but-” Harry trails off.
“Well, Harry. A lot has happened while you’ve been on leave, such as the fact that I am replacing the current Minister of Magic and we need a new Head Auror,” the older man says, “and I’ve decided to give you that job.”
“-but I said he was like his father and that he was torturing him in his basement.
“You’ll try,” Draco said, watching her walk away before he turned to his son.
Draco feels a tear almost slip out of his eye, but he quickly wipes it away. Harry does something he never thought he would after that. He leans and wraps an arm around Draco’s shoulders, squeezing slightly, as a way of comfort he was sure Draco had never felt. He feels Draco’s body release tension the longer they stay where they are. No words are spoken amongst the pair, but to them there was no need for words.
Harry watched Draco walk down an alley after he’d seen his two sons off to Hogwarts, feeling Ginny’s eyes on him.
Draco chuckles and dismisses Keeni, leaving her to do whatever she wanted. Carefully placing the plates onto the set table, he hears footsteps thundering down the stairs along with a young boy yelling, “I smell food,” Scorpious yells.
“Like the fact that they’re in love with each other and literally can’t stop looking at the other?” Scorpious says, still focused on the drawing he was doing on the ground.”
“It’s fine, it’s not like anyone cares,” she says, “so I’m guessing you’re here to ask about Christmas. It should be at Malfoy’s house, it’s big and you don’t have a house anymore.”
“Ginny, s-she got hurt overseas and it isn’t good. She’ll live, but I can’t help but feel it’s my fault. And Lily, she’s there too-”
Hermione turns with a grin on her face, “very funny.” The two hug and Harry rubs her back.
Harry turns to look at his son, only to find an empty space. A pit grows in the bottom of his stomach, “Albus?” he shouts.
Draco waves his wands in front of him in a desperate attempt to calm Harry down, “relax Harry, you don’t have to get me anything. It’s more of an ‘I’m sorry for being a dick to you’ gift.”
“Well that’s promising,” James says in a mocking voice.
“What?” Harry replies, a surge of relief running through his veins, “h-he’s there with you?”
As Harry makes his way down the stairs, he hears the echo fill the almost silent space. It’s coming from the kitchen, Harry thinks to himself as he moves quietly to stand outside the doorway.
“Alright, I just wanted to make sure everything was okay with you being here.”
Draco can’t help but feel a strange pang in his chest when he hears the Weasley girl’s name.
Draco shakes his head with a deep chuckle before heading towards the kitchen, “Keeni!”
“Scorpious asked if Albus could stay with us whilst you were in recovery and I said he could, so he’s been with us for the past two weeks,” Draco says, looking at Albus fondly.
“Are you ready to leave boys?” Draco yells, pulling his coat on and picking up his case. The pair appear around the corner and nod, but then Albus comes up to Draco.
“I shouldn't have said what I said. It’s wrong and none of it was true.”
Albus nods and disappears, probably off to hang out with his cousins.
For what seems like hours, Draco sits there by himself, letting tears soak his sleeve, so much so that he doesn’t hear Scorpiuos enter the room.
“Hello Scorpious,” he chuckles with a grin wide across his face, “how was it while I was gone?”
“Harry? You two are on a first name basis now,” she says in a humored tone.
“Albus has a pretty big effect on people,” Harry replies, wrapping his arms around Lily, who is curled in his chest.
“Will my Dad be alright by himself?”
Draco lets a small grin rise on his face and mumbles, “I know, but it just happens.”
Scorpious looks contemplative for a moment, his eyes carefully inspecting the precious creature in his arms, “how about…Delpha?”
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Draco says sincerely, standing and grabbing his shirt, looking at him for permission.
Draco rolls his eyes, “come on Potter. Dance, spin, padebure for all I care. You danced with her when she was sad, and even though I’m sure Granger is a better dancer than me, you’re sad so it’s my turn.”
Both Albus and Scorpious chuckle at his words, and Draco holds out his hand for Albus to take. He takes it nervously and Scorpious stands on Albus’s left, before making their way to the infirmary.
“Oh no, Harry.”
Scorpious stands on his toes and wraps his arms tightly around Draco once again, resting his head against his torso. Draco immediately returns the hug and smiles, appreciating his mother’s wise words, “well Mother was right wasn’t she?”
The two once again vanish into the fireplace and reappear back in the shop. They rush into the street and yell for Albus. Moving in every direction possible, they search for him, continuing to yell.
Draco scoffs and speaks under his breath, “bullshit…”
“Dad! Wake up, it's Christmas!” Draco groans and rolls onto his stomach, turning his face to his pillow.
“Yes, something did happen actually,” Draco says with a grin and turns to Albus, “your father woke up.”
“Here are the boys sir,” Keeni says, and Draco bows his head in a thank you, watching her vanish into the air once again.
Hey Harry,
The two talk for a few minutes longer in the hall, as Kingsley points out where Harry’s new office would reside, but then part ways. Harry heads towards the elevators once again, but finds them less crowded than before. Pressing the button for the main floor, he lets a smile grow on his face. I’ve got a good feeling about this.
“Ah yes, I forget that the tiny Potter’s were coming. Scorpious will be less lonely than usual. Are they coming the first day of the Christmas break?”
“Come one Harry. Even I’m not that stupid. It’s obvious.”
He looks down to see his son grinning at Albus, but his eyes quickly focus back up at him, “Dad, can I talk to you for a second?”
“Dad, hurry up it’s 10:30,” Scorpious yells from the bottom of the stairs, eager to leave with his trunk and his cat.
“James is still at school and Mum and Lily are coming tomorrow to see you, before they leave for America.”
“It’s quite alright Mis- Draco,” she says, climbing onto the island bench, before moving closer and whispering in his ear, “I’m not a fan of beef.”
“Ginny, are you sure? I don’t want to have our whole lives change just because of me,” Harry said, as he fidgeted with his hands.
“Hello? Anybody home?” Harry yells, moving through the lounge room. He hears a thunder of footsteps and sees two children rush into the room.
“There,” he mumbles, standing up and pulls a small, white, cotton blanket over the still body, “don’t die on me now.”
“Did you have fun?” Harry asks, shifting his weight on his feet, suddenly filled with nerves.
“Yes, I know. I’m just making sure,”  Harry looks up at Hermione for a moment, then back down to Albus, “could you give us a second buddy? I need to talk to your Aunt for a second.”
After their ice-cream, they go into a specific business containing the Floo Network, each grabbing a hand-full of the charcoal dust. One after the other, they step through the fireplace, repeating the address of Draco’s house, with Harry and Albus the last to step through.
“Draco,” he yells, his voice being drowned out by the rain, “please.”
“Dad, you’ve been living with this Draco guy for a month now and his last name has a massive reputation and it isn’t exactly a good one.”
Harry chuckles, “yes, yes it was. What do you think Albus?”
“Draco, you don’t have to do that,” Harry says, his hands rubbing his neck as if he wants to say no, but his eyes glow as if they want to say yes.
“Hey,” Harry says quietly, carrying two cups of steaming tea. Hermione looks up from the fire and smiles gently, gratefully taking the cup.
“That’s alright, you can borrow Scorpious’s. I’m sure you’re the same size. How I just have to finish Harry’s report and then we can leave” Draco says with a smile, watching the friends look at each other grinning. Draco goes back to his medical chart to finish his work-up, so they can leave. I might regret this, he thinks to himself, this could end really badly.
“I screwed up Hermione,” he says and rubs his head with his hand.
Lucius pulled out his wand and pointed it at his son, “you’re right. It won’t.” He raised his wand and Draco closed his eyes, waiting for what he had learned to expect.
I wish I could have been like that.
“Fine, we’ll agree to disagree, Malfoy,” he says, smirking at his humorous but harsh tone.
Harry can’t help but laugh once again, and this time Albus and Scorpious join in. Draco joins in after he finishes his childish wine.
“Really?” Scorpious squeals, jumping up and down on the spot. Draco mods, before gesturing towards the trunk sitting on the bed. He begins cleaning up his bedroom much quicker than before, and Draco chuckles at the sight.
He watches as the pair walk away, disappearing into the hoards of men and women trying to desperately find their train before it’s too late. He turns in the opposite direction, deciding to walk towards his little flat in the centre of London rather than Apparate, giving his mind a chance to wander to when everything began to change in his life.
Draco can feel eyes on him and he turns to see the Golden Trio from 19 years ago, as well as Ginny Weasley. He nods at them, knowing that he isn’t their friend, but he doesn’t want to be their enemy. God, I’ve gone soft, he thinks to himself, focusing his attention on his son who is tugging at his sleeve.
“Dad, why’d you get Keeni to bring us here. Did something happen?” Scorpious asks, straightening his jumper.
“Well it’s certainly better than what I used to call you. Sorry about that,” he says with his voice full of honesty.
He slowly looks over the wall, making sure that everything was right the way he fixed it. His Aunt Andromeda’s face is now no longer burnt out with a spell, and neither was his cousin’s, Sirius Black. His eyes focus back on Andromeda and follow the south line, to see Nymphadora Tonks, as well as Remus Lupin and their son, Edward Tonks.
“You’ll never be good enough boy,” Lucius yelled, backhanding Draco across the face. He flinched, avoiding eye-contact as much as he could.
Harry chuckles, “hey guys. Where’s your parents huh, we need to talk about Christmas?”
Harry smiles and leans down to hug her close, “I’ll miss you too my little flower.”
Carefully unbuttoning Harry’s shirt, he can’t help but notice the toned stomach that was hidden beneath the large gashes that were once familiar to himself. He opens the tube of cream and gently uses a cotton swab to smear on the antiseptic. As he does this, he takes a moment to look at his patient’s face, so peaceful it looks as if he’s sleeping. Harry’s face had grown sharper of the years he hadn’t seen him. Even though he saw Harry not two months ago at the London King’s Cross Station, he can now see every detail on his enemies ghostly pale face; the small freckles spread lightly across his nose and a little scar on his chin from god knows where. He’s...he’s hot, Draco couldn’t help but think, but he quickly focuses his attention back to the wounds. I can’t think that. He’s-he’s Potter...he’s not your friend. He quickly occupies himself by pulling his wand and whispering ‘Vulnera Sanentur’, watching the deep gashes slowly close up.
“Yes, Teddy told me. What is it you wanted to speak to me about?”
He pulls out a black button-up and black jeans, hurridley pulling them onto his body before looking in the mirror. He combs his fingers through his hair, trying to make himself somewhat presentable for his guests.
“Auror raid went wrong. Few dead, rest injured. You should probably take this one, he’s been cursed with something pretty heavy.
Draco can feel a bubbling anger in his chest, but he tries to contain it when he responds, “what is that supposed to mean?”
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Uhh,” his son responds, looking down at his hands that are clutching the cool metal at the end of the bed.
Albus’s face lights up and he jumps at Draco, hugging him tightly around the waist, “thank you so much Draco. You saved his life.” The boy looks up at Draco with the biggest smile he could muster and he can’t help but grin just as wide.
Now I really want to go skating. Damn covid.
Prompt #12
“The lake is through here!” He called back to Harry, who had been watching him with apprehension.
“Excuse me?”
It took Harry a moment to realize she was done talking and was now waiting for a response. “Sorry, am I interested in doing what?” He asked, confused.
Harry gaped. “Malfoy!”
Prompt #19
After a few hours of driving, the bus rattled to a stop on the edge of a quaint village, the sign announcing that it was indeed Painswick. Thanking the driver, Harry stumbled out into the cold air, legs slightly numb from sitting for so long.
, I brought you here— well, really, I didn’t particularly want to bring you here, but it was the only way that I got to come here— That is to say that, I like coming here every so often to— Well, every so often is perhaps the wrong way to put it, every Hogsmeade weekend is more accurate, because, well—”
“That’s your fault,” Draco said quickly, biting back another shiver. “Like I said, flying in January.”
The Quidditch game was one of the most ruthless ones Harry had ever played, and that was including the match when dementors had shown up and tried to suck out his soul.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Because we’re supposed to be a couple!”
Stonily silent, the two boys walked out of the castle and across the grounds to the Quidditch pitch, where the stands were already filled with a roiling mass of students and teachers alike. Yellow and blue pennants snapped merrily in the fierce November gusts of wind and coordinated cheers rang up to the dark, cloud-strewn sky that looked as though flurries of snow could burst from it at any moment.
Draco was vaguely aware that the rest of the hall had gone quiet as his and Harry’s shouts echoed across the large space, but his blood was boiling too hot to pay much attention. This was too far.
“Poker?” Malfoy raised a questioning eyebrow as he stirred a steady stream of cream into his coffee.
I am exhausted, because I have been awake for thirty hours straight, so I'll be brief:
“Thanks, Harry,” Ron said, turning towards him with a wide smile, only to freeze, staring at Harry’s chest with a confused look on his face.
I don't usually write Harry and Draco out of Hogwarts and in their early twenties, so this is a fun experience for me, imagining them a bit more grown-up with some time between their last interaction! Hope it reads okay!
“Roses,” Potter said faintly when he finally managed to shut his mouth. He nodded, saying it again, more firmly: “Roses.”
God, this man was confusing, Harry thought in annoyance, struggling to keep up with him again.
Within seconds, every perfect cut-out star was reduced to mush, as Malfoy tried to extract them with increasing frustration, finally throwing his hands up in the air and declaring, “It’s impossible.”
“You should go on holiday!”
Malfoy smirked, delightedly taking in their obvious reactions to the insinuation. “Sweet Salazar, you mean you two aren’t together?” He said innocently.
The afternoon passed quickly, Harry kept abreast of every mishap, romantic or otherwise, that the characters in Malfoy’s book came across, thoroughly entertained by the Slytherin’s unconscious commentary.
“So you’ve finally seen sense and decided to let me win? Well done, Potter.” Malfoy’s eyes burned with victory.
Kudos and comments are always appreciated. :)
Malfoy looked startled. “What?”
Harry sighed. “No, Draco, you have far too much Slytherin in you for me to even contemplate such a thought. You’re cold though, so just put the bloody scarf on.”
“Thank you,” the lady said, obviously pleased. “I made them myself, just like I do for my grandkids. Keep your head nice and cozy.”
For an instant, Potter’s eyes filled with something that looked an awful lot like panic. He gulped. “Just rumours.”
“Every time,” he admitted sheepishly, running a hand through his hair.
“So, are you two ready to go?”
“Where is it?” Scorpious asks, looking up at his father. Draco smiles and pulls his wand from the inside of his coat. He waves it in a small circular motion and a small box appears, specifically, a cat carrier box. Scorpious’s eyes grow wide and he runs towards the box, sliding down to his knees to see inside.
“If it wasn’t true then why did you say it Potter?” Draco yells, anger fueling his body.
The pair walk off slowly into the night, a feeling apart of them that they had never felt and could not understand.
TW: Ab*se
The two say their goodbyes and Harry rushes back to the Floo shop for the fourth time today. Within moments, he is in the Weasley’s living room and Hermione and Albus are standing in front of him. Harry quickly scoops Albus up in his arms and holds him tight.
In no time, there are 3 plates covered in pasta, beef, tomato sauce and cheese.
“Well I hate him less than I used to.”
“Thank you Draco,” Albus says, smiling kindly at him and Draco can’t help but feel a warm fuzzy feeling in his chest. It’s nice to have someone who doesn’t look at me like I’m going to kill them.
Draco steps through his front door, and instead of hearing the silence he expected, he heard a muffled noise all too familiar to himself mixed with the sound of music; crying. He quietly moves towards the kitchen and places his grocery bags on the floor, before following the sound. Following the loud sobs up the stairs and towards one of the spare rooms, he pushes open the slightly ajar door and hears the pained sobs with the radio playing. Draco sees Harry on the bed, his back hunched over with his hands over his eyes.
He has a stronger jaw and is more built than he was 19 years ago. He looks good. Wait, what!?
“Well I’d say that’s pretty good for a Potter,” Draco says with a chuckle, before turning to look at Harry and his other son.
Both Harry and Albus turn to look at him, an expression of surprise present on their faces. Scorpious grins up at his father and looks back at Albus, who seems to be only just registering what Draco just said.
Harry raises an eyebrow, “how’d you know about that?”
Both of them grimace at the thought of the Ground Floor of St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, which is where they treated artefact accidents. Draco and Rowan usually worked on the Fourth floor, where the hexes and jinxes victime would go, but the under-staffed hospital changed that.
Harry feels his mouth fall open in shock, but he closes it in no time, “I’m sorry?”
Scorpious and Albus head towards the fireplace that had a Floo Network directly arranged for Professor McGonagoll’s office. They wave one last goodbye at their father’s and step into the fire, vanishing to Hogwarts.
“You know, we should invite Hermione and Ron for Christmas?”
Draco thinks for a moment and stands, wondering what in God’s name his mother could have said to Scorpious, “oh yeah, and what was that?”
“Well yes,” James says with a careful laugh and with that, the group of five leave the train station, making their way to the Malfoy Manor.
“Clothes, clothes, clothes,” Draco mumbles, rushing over to his closet.
Draco hastily sits up in his bed and pulls his hair back, “any minute?” he shouts in a panic.
Harry chuckles and squeezes Albus one last time. Out of the corner of Harry’s eye, he can see Draco hugging his son with his eyes squeezed close. Draco rests his hand on Scorpious’s face, and lightly taps it, before turning him around.
Anyways, I'm also writing a Slytherin/Hufflepuff fanfiction that includes multiple same-sex relationships, including the main relationship. So if you're interested you can read that too, but it's really slow updated because school is stupid.
“Hang on,” Hermione says, before her voice becomes more muffled than before, “Albus, come here.”
“My name’s Lily, Lily Potter,” she says, sticking her hand out in a very mature way. Draco grasps her hand softly and shakes it.
They nod and run off, before Draco turns to Harry, “we can get your stuff tomorrow if you like. That way you can make sure Albus is seen off to school.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry says, raising an eyebrow with confusion.
“Here you are,” Kreacher says out of nowhere and Draco jumps with slight fear. Kreacher holds out a small frame and Draco takes it into his palm. Turning his focus back to the wall, he holds up the frame and begins to work on the final piece of the tapestry.
“Hey Scorpious, how was school?”
Harry gasps as he lifts his head from the bowl. He leans over the silver liquid and breathes deeply, trying to think about what he just saw.
“Okay, step.”
“They had to leave, because their flight changed.”
Harry slams the fridge closed and sighs deeply, “why the hell is there no food in this fridge.”
Draco can’t help but notice how Harry’s face slightly fell with Albus’s answer, and he finds himself wanting to ask why. He sees that Scorpious and Albus are looking at Harry and clears his throat.
They all grab hands and Disapparte, reappearing again in front of a Muggle apartment building. Draco looks around to make sure no Muggles saw, and then looks at Harry, “this is where you live?”
“I’m your guest, I have rights.”
“Why are you here Astoria?” Draco said, a deep frown and harsh glare set on his face.
“Draco please,” he yells, speeding up to be closer to him, “I’m sorry.”
Harry doesn’t look convinced, but nods weakly anyway. Draco does something even he doesn’t expect next and grabs Harry’s shoulders to make him stand. Before Harry can react, he wraps his arms tightly around his torso, resting his head on Harry’s shoulders, just like the way he wished someone would have hugged him when he needed it most.
Hermione sits beside him and wraps an arm around his quivering shoulders, “Harry, you were upset. I’m sure he can understand.”
Astoria snared, “Just because I want to raise our son the right way, doesn’t mean you have the right to take him away.”
“Pizza is good,” Harry says awkwardly, doing a small smile.
Harry looks at Draco in shock, and smiles slightly at Draco seemingly being more mature, than his younger years.
“Wow,” Harry chuckles, his breathing still heavy from the lack of air, “that was-”
“Enough of what?” Harry asks, slowing his pace to match the children.
“How long have you liked him?”
“Geez Hermione, always the fun one,” Harry says with a chuckle, and moves closer to her.
Harry looks down at his fingers, watching the glide across the mug, “but how do I know that I do? What if it’s too fast and my head is just being, well stupid.”
Another set of panicked footsteps enters the room, and Draco sees what appears to be a younger Harry, “did you find- Dad!” The dark-haired boy rushes up to the opposite side of Draco and looks up at Draco, his eyes looking slightly watery and in a voice of desperation, “is he going to be okay?”
Harry rips it off and reads aloud, “Due to maintenance throughout the building, all residents have to be evicted due to possible health concerns. We apologise for any inconveniences, and wish our residents the best of luck. Please have everything packed and have taken leave by the 15th of October at the latest.”
The group of three talk and laugh for what seems like hours, and to Harry, it feels like no time at all.
Harry nods, “they’ll be coming too.”
“Didn’t something happen to him, with his wife?” Ron asked, still staring at Malfoy's family, “something about Scorpius?”
“Long enough,” he responds, smirking and walking into the kitchen. He leans around Draco and snatches bacon from the plate.
Draco sniffs, and looks up at his son, “nothing Scorpious, I was just thinking about your grandfather.”
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Malfoy Manor,” he speaks softly, before stepping into the fireplace, engulfing himself in the warm fire.
Harry looks up at Draco and slowly relaxes, but his body stays tense. Draco slowly removes his hands from Harry’s shoulders and grabs his board, before sitting down in his chair, “good.”
“It’s probably better to just show you.”
“Yeah, and Ginny. She does have Lily with her as well. That’s how we’ve been doing Christmas for years.”
“Yeah, it’s kinda obvious.”
“Obviously.”
Harry nods, “sounds like a plan.” Draco smiles and walks off, and Harry can’t help but watch vanish around the corner.
“Same, but we have to enjoy it while it lasts I guess.”
Albus smiles when they tell him, but a worried look replaces his smile, “but, I haven’t got any clothes.”
Harry hears a patter of footsteps and a phone being handed over to another person, “Dad?”
“Dad!”
FLASHBACK
“And I still feel bad, because I don’t have anything for you, but fine.”
“Scorpious, Scorpious, relax,” Draco says, grabbing Scorpious’s shoulder and looking him in the eye, “of course he can stay with us.”
“Everybody knows, it’s basically pure knowledge at the Ministry.”
“Alright, alright, I’m coming,” Draco sighes, pulling his arm through the sleeve of his coat, “grab your stuff and we’ll get going.”
“I know, I know. It’s just-”
Draco feels a sharp stab in his chest, but keeps his head calm, “Harry, you need to-”
Harry’s grin falters and his eyes fill with fear, “wait, was I supposed to get you a gift. I should, I mean you’ve let me live here so it's only fair.”
“Now, relax you two. Dinner’s on the table.”
He hesitates for a moment before answering Draco’s question, “this song...it played when Hermione and I were hunting Horcruxes. She cut my hair, terribly, and then we danced because she was sad.”
“Need to what huh? What are you gonna do? This is your fault!” Harry yells, jabbing hsi finger directly in Draco’s face.
Harry and Albus are standing with Scorpious, and they nod.
“Wow,” Albus says, moving further into the room in awe, “you guy’s house is amazing.”
“Because I hate shopping,” Draco says with a humorous tone, poking his head around the corner.
They both chuckle and quickly hug, before Scorpous disappears onto the train. Draco watches as the trains puffs a cloud of smoke and vanishes down the track, out of sight. As Draco stands alone, he catches another glimpse of Harry Potter out of the corner of his eye and notices how he’s changed.
Once he finishes his healing, he grabs a vial from the shelf above his head and looks at it’s light blue contents. Carefully removing the lid, Draco drips 2 drops of the liquid into Harry’s slightly open mouth and watches colour grow back into his complexion.
A small house-elf appears in front of Draco, dressed in a small robe with her hands crossed in front of her, “yes, Mr. Malfoy?”
“No, you’ve let me stay in your house, you have to be a part of Christmas.”
“To everyone but them,” James finishes for Albus, “they’re acting like whimsical teenagers.”
“What truth?”
He storms off and Harry feels a different pit in his stomach, a pit of guilt, but he ignores it and instead reaches for his phone in his pocket. Scrolling as fast as he can, he finds Hermione and calls her.
“Hello there Albus. How have you been?”
“Alright then. Well what’s your name?”
“Who? Scorpious? Draco, he's your son. He loves you and he’s happy here, even I know that and I’ve only been here for a month or two,” Harry says reassuringly. He grabs Draco arms and moves his body to face his. Harry places a hand on Draco’s shoulder and rubs gently.
“Don’t thank me. It was bound to happen in due time anyway.”
Ginny gently placed her hand on his face and he leaned into the warmth, “Harry, it’s fine, okay. We don’t have to be together to be a family. I’ll always love you, but we both know it’s the right thing to do...for everyone.”
“I tried to fit it all in, but it didn’t work. I’m sorry,” he apologises, looking down at his feet.
“Come on boys,” Draco yells, looking behind him to make sure there are three juniors following, “if we lose Harry, we lose any hope of living through this.”
“The tapestry,” he barely mumbles, tracing his fingers along the careful work.
Draco lightly grabs Harry's shoulder and squeezes it, “it’s no problem, Harry.” For a moment, the pair watch each other’s eyes, not moving. Draco blinks and shifts his gaze towards his son.
Harry sits up straighter and a grin appears, “really?”
He looks so happy.
“Right,” Draco says, drawing out the word. Draco walks off and James and Harry look at each with another chuckle.
“How’ve you been, Hermione.”
END FLASHBACK
“Harry, he cares about you. He’ll forgive you.”
Harry chokes on his tea and wipes his hand over his mouth, taking away any drips that escaped his lips, “what? What do you mean?”
“Of course Master Malfoy,” Kreacher says, before his voice turns to a whisper, “afterall, I could prefer to serve a Malfoy over filthy half-blood Potter-”
“Fine. Working at the hospital, looking after my son-” Draco jumps up and his board falls to the floor, “I have to do something.”
Harry falters for a moment, before wiping the back of his hand across his chin. He sits there, patiently waiting for Draco to return from his rushed journey.
Harry follows Draco’s instructions, and in moments they’re walking down what feels like  a narrow hall, the floorboards creaking beneath. Harry’s foot collides with a lifted piece of wood and he falls forward slightly. He squeezes his eyes shut and waits for hard impact, but instead is greeted with a figure wrapping their arms around his torso.
Draco feels this and grins at the small emotion, “what are you smiling at?”
“Hello S- Draco. I was wondering, only if it’s alright with you Master of course, if I could attend to another matter regarding an old friend of mine for a few days. Your father would obviously never give such a gift to Keeni, but since he is no longer here and you are a much kinder man since your father left, I thought I would have the ability to ask.”
“I’ll leave you alone now, but i’ll be back in 30 minutes for Harry’s check-up.” He disappears from the room and Ginny turns with a smirk on her face.
“Oh uh…” Harry says, desperately trying to think of an answer for Draco.
Draco turns, this time not turning back, but keeping his body tense as if a barrier is between him and Harry.
“Dad?”
“Yeah, it’s been amazing,” Albus says, his voice dripping his joy, “Scorpious and I played in his room, and Draco makes the best spaghetti ever.”
“Dad, you know that makes you sad,” Scorpious says, poking his father’s face in a joking manner in hopes of making him smile.
“Uncle Harry,” they both shout, as the children and Harry collide.
“My father no longer lives here and will never be returning, so it is all alright,” Draco says with a smile, hoping it would convince Keeni to listen. Her eyes widen and a small smile grows on her face, before she disappears from sight. Draco sorts through the kitchen cupboards, grabbing a pot and a pan ready to make spaghetti bolognese, and then Keeni appears holstering two bags over her shoulders. The pair begin working on dinner, cooking the beef and stirring the pasta.
“Shh. You don’t have to explain. Just remember that he loves you.” Draco smiles weakly at Harry and looks into his eyes, seemingly lost in them. Harry does the same, neither of them threatening to move the still air around them.
Harry steps inside of his apartment, and flicks the switch to flood the empty apartment with light. Collapsing onto his couch, he closes his eyes to rest for a moment, but instead is interrupted by an owl screeching outside his window with a letter tied to it’s foot. He sits up, and makes his way to the window, opening it to grab the letter. Carefully untying the parchment, the owl flies away into the cloudy London sky and he latches the window closed, knowing that rain is coming. He tears the wax seal open and pulls out the parchment inside, seeing the familiar handwriting of his godson Teddy.
“Of course. What task do you require of me?” She asks, bowing her head.
“James, if he hasn’t killed me yet, then I’ll doubt he’ll try it when there are children here,” Harry whispers, moving his hand in soft motions on James’s shoulder.
“Kreacher,” Draco states calmly, as this had happened before.
I wonder what happened to them? Harry knows that Draco and Narcissa avoided Azkaban because of their trial, including his statement and he presumed Lucius went to Azkaban but what happened? Maybe I’ll ask him later. A memory also comes to his mind in that moment, from years ago, when Harry saw Draco at the station for the first time after his trial.
“Thanks a lot Potter, you’re causing my life a pretty damn amount of difficulty,” he says, as he pulls out his chart to record Harry’s current stats. Suddenly, a loud yell fills the room and Draco quickly raises his head to see Harry sitting up in the bed and frantically panicking. Draco stands and drops his board on his chair, grabbing his shoulders in an attempt to calm him down.
Draco crosses his arms and glares at Harry in a joking manner, “are you insane? You do not put fruit on pizza!”
“Hello?”
“Just a woman Scorpious,” Draco said, “just a woman.”
“Ah, Harry Potter. I’ve been wanting to speak to you,” he says, standing and sticking his hand out. Harry grabs it to shake it firmly, and takes a seat Kingsley gestures to.
Harry woke up one morning to the sun glaring through the paned glass. He squints, making his way over to pull the deep green curtains, concealing the light into a pale glow. Harry reaches over to the bedside table and slips his glasses onto his face, finally being able to see everything as clear as day. Bending down, he grabs a shirt that had been discarded to the floor the previous evening, Harry pulls it over his head, feeling his cold fingers brush against his torso. A yawn escapes his mouth when he pulls open the door to his temporary bedroom, and he steps out into the hallway shrouded in light.
Grabbing Harry’s face in his hands, Draco cuts Harry off by bringing their lips together in the cold rain. Harry freezes for a brief moment, before grasping at the back of Draco's neck nad pulling him even closer. They stay like that for as long as their lungs can last, not wanting to let go of each other as if the other is going to disappear.
“Yes, I’m sure. My friend Rowan is working tonight so she’ll keep me updated on everything that happens.”
“Well, I tried to pack my trunk for Hogwarts, but it didn’t exactly work,” Scorpious mumbles, his voice trailing off at the end. Draco raises an eyebrow and kneels down so he’s at eye-level with his son, “what did you do?” he aska with his hands on his shoulders.
“Good,” Draco says and moves the pair of them into the fire. The heat surrounds them and before a breath can escape Harry’s mouth, the pair step out and are met by cool air. Harry breathes in a musty smell and even though it’s familiar, he can’t quite pinpoint it.
“Of course. There are more than enough rooms in our house, and Albus and Scorpious have to go back to school tomorrow since you’re okay. And since you're still technically a patient, it’ll let me check up on you easier.”
She smiles and nods, so Draco stands, watching the young girl look around.
“Yes of course. I will be back momentarily.” She disappears with the snap of her fingers, and before Draco can blink, she returns holding the hands of two boys.
“Albus, Albus Potter,” he says with a smile, sticking out his hand, “and you are?”
“He’s so happy,” Draco chokes out, before looking back at Harry, “maybe he’d be better off with another family. A family like the Weasley’s.”
“You’re the best Hermione.”
Harry chuckles and rests the phone on his shoulder, while searching the almost empty fridge for some form of food, “yes, well I can’t deny that. But I can say that he isn’t as much of an egotistical, narcissistic, arrogant guy that he used to be.”
With the boy’s luggage packed and ready, even though most of their belongings were already at Hogwarts. Albus gives Harry one last hug and whispers something quietly in his ear, “don’t go almost dying, because then James and I will have to go on the girls trips. Yuck!”
“I must have screwed up my words because I ended up in this tunnel on the outside of London. I didn't know where I was, so I just walked and soon Uncle Ron found me and brought me back to his house.”
From, Teddy.
“Good. Make sure he doesn’t die, afterall, you are a Malfoy.” Madam Fria stalks off, on what seems to be a mission of destruction and torture. Draco glares at her until she disappears out of sight.
Harry smiles and walks towards the fireplace, but briefly turns, “can you?”
The raven-haired boy sits up quickly and wipes away the salty liquid slowly running down from his eyes, “oh, hey Draco.”
“I saw you two in school. Sure, you two fought every hour of every day, but there was always something there. Maybe even just a tiny spark. And even here, you two are almost like magnets. He’s not the wrong person.”
“Bye Dad, I’ll miss you,” she says, hugging him tightly around his torso.
“Harry, what’s wrong?” the blonde says, stepping further into the room and towards Harry.
“Astoria, I don’t want him to live the life that I was forced to live and deal with the Pure-Bloods only can marry Pure-Bloods bullshit,” Draco almost yelled, his fists clenched.
“Alright Harry Potter, now I have to make your face.”
“So,” Harry hears a voice say behind him and he turns to see Draco sitting calmly on his bed, “how was it?”
Harry chuckles, “same with Draco. I think he drank way too much.”
“Yeah you’re right,” she chuckles, tucking the file folder under her arm, “I’ve gotta hand this in, but then I’m gonna clock out. Wanna get a drink?”
“Alright then, but I’m still right,” Draco says with a smirk as he walks off chuckling.
“That he does,” Ginny says, “he seems different; better, nicer, I mean.”
“Sir, it would be improper of me to call you by your first name. Your father commanded me-”
“Dad!” Albus yells, running across the room and jumping onto the bed. The two collide in a storm of happiness and family, and Draco can’t help feel happy for the two. Harry holds his son’s head close to his chest, not wanting to let go. His eyes meet Draco’s for a moment, and he can see a glimmer of joy slip through.
“Why did I say that Hermione? I know he cares about Albus almost like a son and he’s nothing like his father,” Harry says, collapsing onto the couch with tears stinging in his eyes, “what have I done?”
“Excuse me, Malfoy. Your ego is showing.”
Draco speaks gently to Harry, “listen to me, none of it is your fault. It’s just a horrible accident, and I’m sure both Lily and Rose are fine. Okay?”
After placing Scorpious’s packed and overflowing bags by the front door, Scorpious looks expectantly up at his father. His eyes are wide, almost as if they are pleading. Draco smiles at his son, before gesturing for him to follow. They make their way towards the drawing room, glowing in the luminescent light from the moon shining through the windows. Scorpious looks around curiously, trying to spot the gift his father promised, but there was nothing else in the room, except a few lounges surrounded by burning candles.
“You sound so surprised,” Harry replies before making his way into the building.
Maybe I’ll ask him that too, Harry thinks as he shuts the door to continue to the other end of the hall. He knows there is one last door he has yet to open, yet he doesn’t know if he really should, afterall it is his bedroom. With each step towards the door, Harry’s heart pounds harder inside of his chest. By the time his hand touches the door knob, he feels as if his heart is about to explode in his chest and yet he turns the brass. Pushing open the door, the first thing he sees is a large bookcase covering the entire back wall, filled with thousands of books; both old and new.
“Fine, just go,” Draco says, waving his hand fleetingly at Harry.
Little do either of them know, is that a certain witch stood around the corner, watching them with a grin.
“AVADA KEDAVRA!” Harry hears someone scream, and he sees Anderson collapse to the ground, his eyes void of all life. He feels his heart drop in his chest and he runs over to him, even though he knows that he is long gone. He crouches down and closes his friends eyes, but he doesn’t notice the man cloaked in black approach his back, pointing his wand.
Draco immediately places his hand on Harry’s shoulder, “Harry-”
The Potter’s turn to Draco, who spoke and smile at the blonde, “oh no one,” Harry says.
“Yeah, but I have to go into town afterwards. I’ll probably be gone until late, so you’ll have to fend for yourself, since I’ve been babying you.”
“Okay, are you ready?” Draco says softly, his almost whisper full of shakiness and nervousness.
“Yes Kreacher I am. Could you also fetch me the photo from last time, if it isn’t any trouble,” Draco questions, shrugging off his jacket.
They end up back at the Floo store once again, and Harry hits his palm agains the wall, “dammit.”
“Draco, what the hell are we doing?” Harry asks, trying to distract his focus from the fact that Draco’s hands are on his face, covering his eyes.
How are you? I need to come visit you again, but Victorie and I are currently in America. It’s so different here, they all sound so strange. Anyway, the Ministry keeps contacting me for some reason and they want to talk to you, so you should probably go into work instead of laying on your couch all day. I hope you’re well and I will see you as soon as possible. Aunt Andromeda says hello by the way.
“Dad, what do we do now?” Scorpious questions, looking around for a train to Hogwarts.
Draco is standing on the ground-floor in the Trauma room, recording down his last patient when the doors swing open to reveal a swarm of people, some hospital workers, some wizards who appear to be Aurors, and most of them are bleeding. He yells for extra hands and races up to the people, throwing his board at the front desk.
“Harry, it isn’t my fault. He just vanished and we’ll find him.”
The three laugh at what James just said, and continue their activities with the occasional input from James.
“Yeah, I know. It’s just-”
“It isn’t bullshit, it’s right. Those mud-bloods and half-blooded morons have no place in our world!”
Draco’s face grows to one full of pain more than anger, “I trusted you not to be like everyone else, but turns out you are.”
“I know I was like that in school, but I’ve changed now and I wanted my son to have a different life. A free life, as I’d call it. So when I disagreed with her, she left without a word. She sends letters occasionally, mainly for Scopious, but I know I’ll never talk to her the way I used to again.”
The pair runs upstairs, going through the many hallways, until they reach Scorpious’s bedroom. Draco opens the door, only to be confronted by various magical possessions strewn across every inch of the room. Draco looks down at Scorpious, who had an innocent smile on his face, “Scorpious,” he draws out.
“No it’s all your fault! What did you do to him, Draco? You’re probably torturing him in the basement just like your father.”
He reaches the bottom of the stairs and heads towards the living room, seeing a group of people grinning and laughing. A woman turns at the sound of Draco’s footsteps and has a look of both hope and concern.
“Come on boys, we have to get back, so you can get back to Hogwarts.” The father’s pull their sons along, and Disapparate from the empty hallway.
“Harry, I haven’t had a proper Christmas in years and plus, I really don’t think Granger and Weasley would appreciate me invading family Christmas,” Draco says, occasionally using a more sarcastic tone.
Rowan smiles and waves, “see ya, Malfoy.” Draco returns the wave and the door swings shut behind her. Draco stands still for a moment, his eyes wistfully looking out at the single window in his office at the full moon that gleams amongst the midnight sky. He’s worried. Worried for Scorpious, and worried for himself; he hated being alone. It’ll be fine, he thinks to himself, picking up his dark trenchcoat and his briefcase, before leaving the small room and locking it behind him. His feet were tapping loudly against the white-tiled hospital floors, echoing throughout the hallway as if no one else was on the Fourth floor.
“He will be alright, I promise. I’m giving him the best care I can,” Draco says calmly, “what’s your name?”
Draco sits up quickly, wiping his tears from his cheeks and avoiding his son’s eyes, “H-hello Scorpious.”
With his arms holding what feels like hundreds of grocery bags, Draco makes his way down an almost silent London street as the sun begins to sink behind Big Ben. He makes his way through the street, until he stops between the two of the tightly packed buildings. Turning to check if any Muggles are watching, Draco pulls out his wand and whispers an almost silent enchantment.
“I want to see my son, Draco,” Astoria said, her arms crossed, “He’s mine.”
Harry nods and sits down on top of the kitchen bench, his legs swinging like a little kid, “yep we have to pick them up from the station.”
“So, that’s what happened? With your wife?” Harry asks cautiously, still unsure if Draco is okay with answering questions.
“Name,” Draco asks shortly, grabbing the chart from his hands.
The concern of Draco’s face disappears to be replaced by a scowl, “thanks for the truth Potter.”
“What?” Scorpious responds, lifting a large pile of books off from the ground.
Harry looks over to the now empty space where Draco once stood before smiling, “yea, yeah I think he is.”
“Oh god, I don’t even know these people. Why am I even here?” Draco sighs and before he can do anything else, a large group of voices echoes from downstairs. He takes a deep breath and makes his way towards downstairs, hopefully prepared for the people.
For the rest of the evening, the two laid in Scorpious’s bed until his eyes closed and his breaths became deep. Draco slides out, making sure not to wake his son, and carefully pulls the blanket over him. He leans down and whispers goodnight to Scorpious, before heading to his own bedroom, preparing for the day ahead.
Draco smiles, and walks up to his son, wrapping a single arm around his shoulder, “she’s all yours. Now, what are you going to name her?”
“Uhh,” Harry says, as he looks at his son. Albus looks up with him, a grin all over his face, “sure, why not?”
“Albus,” he says, moving to get up but feeling a painful strain on his stomach.
James chokes on his silence, “you see it too?”
Harry can’t help but blurt out the next words in his mouth, “is that what happened to your mother?”
“Shut up Potter, we’re just walking into the fireplace and we’ll be where we need to be.”
“Draco please. People have ruined you. They’ve broken you and made you feel like you don’t know deserve anything but that’s because they don’t know you, but I do,” Harry says, moving closer while Draco stands almost motionless, “you’re grumpy in the morning without your coffee. You act all tough in front of other people, but you’re kind when it’s just you and Scorpious. Hell, you still have nightmares about your father, but they don’t bother you as much anymore.”
A slight grin is present on her lips, “well then it’s only fair that you call me Hermione now isn’t it.”
The group travel down the elevator and head towards the familiar Floo Network. Climbing in and disappearing into the green flames one after the other, they appear in Malfoy Manor.
The man opposite him smiles gently, before taking the hand on his cheek to enclose it in his own, “yeah...yeah we should.”
Hermione also chuckles and shifts in her seat to face him, “speaking of Draco, how long?”
“Brackium Emendo,” he says, carefully tracing his wand over Harry’s arm, watching as it re-aligns itself to its proper shape.
Harry laughs briefly, “I’ll see you a few minutes, okay?”
Draco chuckles lightly at his statement, “well I’m Draco Malfoy, but you already knew that, I suppose.”
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Well I thought since you were the Chosen One, it would be more...well more Chosen One,” Draco says, quickly following after him.
God dammit Malfoy, now I feel guilty.
Draco nods, turning in his chair to reach for his filing cabinet, “you really should be careful Rowan be careful when you say that,”he smirks, while making his way towards her, “she’ll send you to the Ground Floor.”
Harry waves off the visitors the next morning, watching them disappear into the warm green flames. He glances to his left to see Draco grinning at the fireplace, seemingly happy. Not to see them go, but to see them not hate him.
“Nothing, nothing at all,” Draco says hastily, “now let’s go.”
Draco hesitates for a moment before wrapping his arms back around Harry, because he isn’t used to this kind of emotion “you’re welcome Harry...you’re welcome.”
Who knows, maybe I won’t regret this.
“Well you should just use my house. I can just leave.”
Harry’s eyes see the faces previously burnt off in shame and smiles; Andromeda, Sirius. There are also extra faces, like his own and Remus’s, even Teddy’s. Before he can stop himself, Harry walks over to Draco and envelopes him within his arms, holding him tightly.
“Draco,” he basically screams at the top of his lungs. Draco raises his head and turns back towards Harry, yet turning back to his path.
His other son had lighter hair compared to Albus, but the essence of Harry was still obviously there. The boy moves towards him cautiously but confidently and sticks out his hand, “I’m James Potter-well that last part is obvious.”
Draco smiles at the house-elf, “of course you can go Keeni,” he says, but then has what he calls a ‘lightbulb moment’, “but could do a single job for me before you leave?”
The eldest Potter sighs with relief, “oh Albus. Where did you go?”
Harry can’t help but sympathise with Draco, who has a downcast look on his face, “I’m sorry Draco. We don’t have to talk about it.”
“Draco...Draco are you okay?” he hears Harry say gently. Draco feels a hand rest against his back, and slightly relaxes into it, but still breathing as if his life depended on it.
“It’s alright, we’ll just pack it together,” the older man says, ruffling his son’s hair.
“Send you mail whenever I can and keep you updated, and if anyone annoys me-”
With a short chuckle, Harry stands and hugs Hermione, “you’re right. I have to find him.”
Draco dashes into an empty hallway and leans against the plain wall, “what do I do? How in Merlin’s name do I get the boys here in the amount of time Potter will sit in that bed for?” He closes his eyes and rests his head on the wall, breathing deeply. He hears a loud pop and opens his eyes to see Keeni standing nervously in front of him.
“Yeah, well my ego kept you entertained for years, why let it stop now?” Draco says with a familiar smirk, before placing a stack of pancakes and a few pieces of bacon on a china plate.
“Woah,” Albus says, “that’s sick.”
“Oh, okay then,” Harry says, but he still feels guilty of not thinking of getting Draco something for Christmas. He faintly hears Draco say that he’s going out to get the grocery’s, since some people are incapable of shopping for themselves, and Harry knows that’s probably referring to him.
“Look Astoria, my family may hate me, but they would do anything to attempt to save the pure ‘Malfoy’ bloodline and if that means sending you very far away, they will happily do so,” Draco snarled, his eyes seemingly piercing hers. A wave of fear passed over Astoria’s face, clear as day and she stepped back, knowing that Draco spoke the truth.
Harry nods as Draco pulls his shirt away to check on the gashes, “it’s fine. Ginny wants to take Lily to America; Ginny’s going to trial for the Quidditch World Cup.”
“Yes, in fact I can bring Albus here tomorrow and you two can go home for a few days, before the boys have to get back to Hogwarts.”
A look of awe fills his features, and he looks between Draco and Scorpious, “wait, are you?” Scorpious nods enthusiastically and smiles at his father, who returns the gesture.
“Well everything is completely okay,” Albus says, drawing out the ‘y’ at the end. Draco smiles, and feels a tug on his sleeve.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Draco smirks slightly, before quickly replacing it with a familiar frown, “yeah, yeah whatever Potter.” He sits down and observes Harry for a moment, but quickly looks down at his board to pretend to look over his sheets. He can feel Harry’s eyes on him, as he turns the page, but he ignores it.
Draco immediately feels sympathy for the younger boy even though his mind is full of confusion, knowing, or more likely hoping, that if he got hurt, Scorpious would care this much.
“How long for what?”
He opens his charts and before he can fill them out, the main doors for the floor swing open, hitting the walls beside them, “Kai, we’ve talked about you and the-”
Looking up at her face, his mind runs wild with hope that Draco will forgive him, “are you sure?”
“Can we wait for my Mum first? She went to the bathroom.”
FLASHBACK
END TW
She stops a little further away from Draco than her daughter, “Malfoy?”
Harry smiles.
The group enter Diagon Alley full of smiles and make their way down, stopping at almost every shop to look at what’s inside. Their day is full of laughter and sore feet, stopping only for ice-cream at the end of the day. The five sat down, some with ice-cream dripping down their chins and others rolling their tired eyes at the behaviour.
Silence responds to him and he grasps at his hair in his hands, “has anyone seen Albus!” he yells. The others shake their heads, and Draco walks over to him, “Harry relax, he may just still be at Diagon Alley. Let’s go and check.”
“No it’s alright. It’s interesting to have someone to talk to who isn’t on Astoria’s side,” Draco says, as if that had in fact happened to him.
Finally, after what seems like forever, which Harry isn’t complaining about, Draco turns around with a piece of bacon hanging out of his mouth, and his eyes widen. His cheeks glow a crimson red while he quickly shoves the rest of the bacon in his mouth. He speaks in a muffled tone, “how long have you been there?”
“Are you sure? James, I could just meet you in London and we could just stay in a apartment,” Harry says through the phone, a sense of both fear and joy within him.
“Don’t mock me. If you die, it will cost me a lot of money,” Draco says, and points at Albus, “and your father will kill me if you die.”
The boys shove each other as they enter the room, and Draco smiles to see his son being able to have friends, despite his family’s past.
“Ministry of Magic,” he speaks clearly, before stepping into the fire and disappearing from the apartment.
He turns his head back towards Draco with a grin as wide as it could possibly be, “can I open it, please?” he pleads in a voice that Draco couldn’t say no to. He nods, and Scorpious rushes to open the door of the cage. A yelp of joy fills the room, and Draco watches as Scorpious carefully stands and turns towards him, his arms held tightly against his chest. Sitting in his arms is a tiny black kitten, it’s piercing green eyes scanning the room.
Harry finds himself wandering the empty halls of Malfoy Manor, looking into every room he hasn’t seen. He can’t help but notice how one room in particular was miles dustier and darker than the rest, as the rest of the house looks full of life amongst the shadows. Harry presumes it’s his parents room, and he can clearly see the two different people who lived in the room. One side is clean, with everything in a very specific place for a very specific reason. The other side however, is a mess, with paper everywhere and cloaks of black shrouding the dark-oak floors. Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy.
Draco chuckles and before he can say two words, a hard force collides with him. He looks down to see a familiar head of jet-black hair. He chuckles once again, with both confusion and joy.
“As best as can be. How’s it living with Malfoy?”
Draco’s leaning over the front receptionist desk handing in his chart, when he feels a tug on his coat. He turns to see a young girl with red hair, holding a brown teddy bear close to her chest.
