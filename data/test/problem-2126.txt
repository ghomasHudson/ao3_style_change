A dot appeared behind the front gate and Draco melted away from the doors. Even from that great distance, it was easy to tell that someone was arriving— someone he didn’t want to see. It would be far safer for him to retreat to the upper floors of the manor, but this didn’t prevent him from hiding in a nearby room, waiting as his father’s guests arrived. When they had settled, he stood outside the door, listening.
“Me, for example,” Potter said, smirking.
Mild warning: there's some semi-hard-to-read bigotry in this chapter. It's not really worse than what's in canon, but I figured I'd warn y'all anyway. It was really difficult for me to put on the page, but Lucius Malfoy is a monster, so here we are.
Potter turned in his chair to face Draco. “So could this one,” he said, his grey eyes sparking with delight. “I wonder what the Slytherins would think if Draco Malfoy suddenly fancied Harry Potter?”
sort of rugged. Potter's shoulder-length hair, the dark stubble covering his jaw, and the way his tan skin had smoothed again were definitely doing things for Draco…
“You’ve been me for weeks now, you tell me— in your experience, how much do you think I’ve exaggerated there, exactly?”
“Where were you?” Pansy asked, the moment he stepped inside.
Draco did his best to remain silent during the spine shrinkage, but it was difficult. Potter’s whimpers and yelps were fairly loud too, despite being muffled by his pillow— Draco wondered if it was perhaps worse to feel yourself be stretched than shrunk. It certainly sounded that way.
“Why were you thinking about your detention in the Forbidden Forest?” Professor Snape asked, folding his hands.
“Are you saying that, for my mind to be fully protected, I have to drop all my instincts to protect them?”
“Father didn’t tell us more than he thought we should know.”
“I knew it! Mother asked him the same question and he never answered it. What else?”
, I learned something about what’s happening this year…” and he told Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle about his father’s plan, keeping the story as objective as he could manage. He wanted to see how his friends would react.
Draco toed off his damp slippers and cast a Cleaning Charm on them. Tomorrow, when he went back to Potter’s, he would bring different shoes.
“I have all summer to study,” said Draco as he started to take a bite of tomato.
“Hm. Maybe you’ve got some Slytherin in you, after all. Manipulation won’t work on me, though. Guess you’ll have to suffer.” She patted his cheek. “We have to fix your Draco voice. You still don’t really sound like him.”
happened that made Professor Snape retreat from Draco’s mind, leaving Draco a sweaty mess in his chair. He was breathing very fast.
“Kill them too, probably,” said Crabbe. “Impure, aren’t they?”
“It's the same all over,” said Mr Borgin, “Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere—”
“Don’t.” That wound was too fresh.
“Here, Ron, let me help,” said Longbottom, who seemed worried about the way Weasley was approaching the Venomous Tentacula. He got off his stool and came to their side of the table.
save the picture after all, if only to remind himself exactly how much he despised the Gryffindor git.
“Rest up, now,” she said with a nod. Then she ducked out of the curtains and left them alone.
Potter froze with his hand outstretched. “Sorry?”
*******
Draco’s heart stopped for a moment. “Not everything I do involves Potter, Pansy.”
*******
Goyle slapped his knees. “Okay. We can do that.” He glanced between Draco and Pansy. “How do we do that?”
“Hmm. Well, I suppose you aren’t
Crabbe blinked back at him, then did something completely unexpected: he pulled out his wand, cleared his throat, and said, “
way, I can't believe Granger and Weasley didn't tell him off for it. I mean, I was trying to eat!’”
After dinner, Harry followed Pansy down to the Slytherin dorms. Or rather, she dragged him there by the arm. Someone up ahead of them said the password, and they entered into a surprisingly cozy room. The windows backed against the lake, which gave the space a warm, greenish glow; the floor was covered in black and silver rugs that Harry could tell would be quite pleasant to sit on; and there were plenty of dark green chairs and couches scattered about that reminded Harry of the ones in Gryffindor Tower. There was even a fireplace in the far corner.
“We should go to the hospital wing, right?” said Draco.
“All right, so what if I talk about him often? It doesn’t mean I fancy him!”
“Good lord,” Draco breathed. “You weren’t kidding.” He couldn’t bring himself to look anywhere else but the window, not even when the wetness of the grass began to seep into his slippers. If he had thought the Dursleys bad before…
“‘Just girly things’?” he asked her.
“I would never dream of it!” But something about the way her mouth was twitching made Draco think she was hiding something.
“Leave him alone, he didn’t want all that!” said Ginny.
hadn’t been a part of the rumours going around during end of term, only that Potter had ended up in the Hospital Wing after his adventure in the third-floor corridor. Draco hoped Potter had fainted, or tripped, or done something equally as embarrassing.
“Blast it.” Draco ran a hand over his forehead, pushing back hair of unfamiliar thickness and colour. It sprang back into his eyes for the millionth time that night.
She had never once, as far as Draco could remember, woken him up. His parents had always expected him to do that himself.
Potter pursed his lips. “Oh, so I take it you wouldn’t want, say, a kiss from me, then?”
Tonight was not one of those nights. Tonight, Draco took no comfort in the painted constellations. Tonight, he only saw them as a reminder of the pressures of his future. Someday, he would have to marry a pureblooded woman— a match determined (or approved) by their parents. He could change this no more than he could the path of the stars or turn of the earth. Already, the Malfoys were looking at candidates. A current favourite was Astoria Greengrass, who was about a year younger than Draco and starting Hogwarts in September— something Mr Malfoy had brought up to him. He had encouraged Draco to “Get to know her. Well.” At the time, it had seemed less like a threat. Now, after his latest dream, Draco was sure it had been one.

“How much did you see?” Draco whispered.

tool; it takes a highly skilled Occlumens to be able to achieve this. And as you have demonstrated a great deal of natural skill in distractions, I have no doubt you can find success in this new area as well.”
Weasley’s house was exactly what Draco thought it would be. It looked as if it had started as a pigsty, and then was turned into a house by the mere addition of several unbalanced stories. Then, to top it all off, there was a crooked sign by the drive that read:
“It would make me feel good,” said Draco.
But Draco wasn’t done. “You think I’m not upset that he didn’t give me more information about how he’s going to kill the other students? You think I wouldn’t have demanded a list if I thought he knew how to control the monster? You think I
“You don’t
When Draco returned to his room, Blaise sleepily called out, “You weren’t sick, were you?”
“Very good, Draco!” Professor Snape said after Draco had produced his twelfth flawless stream of distractions.
“I am asking you to do so anyway,” Professor Snape said firmly.
As always, thanks for reading! :)
Pansy shrugged, then leaned back in her armchair, turning to toss her legs carelessly over one side. Her dark nightgown fluttered through the air. “It’s the fastest way to turn back.”
“Hang on,”  Draco objected, “I’m more honest than you think I am.”
Mr Malfoy reached for his walking cane, which he had propped against the wall. “Where is your pride?”
It was Draco’s turn to laugh. “Good lord,
“What, am I not allowed to?”
“Narcissa, really,” Mr Malfoy chastened.
“Why? Are you scared, Malfoy?” Potter’s words were mocking, but his voice was thinner than usual. Higher.
Pansy nodded soberly. “Because he’d win. Don’t you want Slytherin to beat Gryffindor?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dobby pulled him back. “Sir, you mustn’t!” he warned, shaking his head so much that his big ears flopped against it.
“My lord,” Draco said simply. The Dark Lord acknowledged him with a vague hand gesture, and Draco tried not to scamper out of the room.
“Yeah!” said Goyle, bringing a large fist down on the seat next to him.
There was an unfamiliar name printed on the first page — T. M. Riddle — but there was nothing else written inside. Not one tiny scribble. Draco flipped through page after page, with each turn growing more reckless, hoping for some sign that someone had at some point used the diary, but the parchment was blank.
“Sure,” Potter allowed, “but everyone’ll suspect something’s wrong when they see me like that.” He nodded at Draco’s reflection, whose hair had been styled into an ‘artfully messy’ look rather than a plain ‘messy’ one. Draco had been rather pleased with it up until that point.
Malfoy raised a dark eyebrow. “Is that what you think I’m doing?”
They glared at each other.
“Oi! Potter!” Harry called. Malfoy stopped and turned to look at him. “How do you like my hair?” Harry ran a careful hand through his bangs, putting more focus on the act of touching it than messing up the style. He was pleased to see Malfoy’s lips purse in distaste.
*******
Draco reached for a peculiar glass eye, whose iris was orange, but before he could palm it, his father spoke. “Touch nothing, Draco.”
As always, I don’t own any of these characters, nor the world they inhabit. Unfortunately, that right belongs to J.K. Rowling. I'll do some direct quoting of dialogue from the books in this fic, so if it’s important to you, see the end notes for my improper citations.
“To coexist,” Draco answered simply.
Draco started a little at that. He hadn’t thought about it before, but surely it was exhausting to poke around in someone else’s mind… It looked like it had taken a lot out of Professor Snape: his eyes were drooping slightly, his wrinkles seemed deeper somehow, and he looked extraordinarily pale.
“Yes, sir,” said the elf solemnly.
Pansy was gone— she had bent over so far that she had finally fallen off the counter.
?” he said, louder than he should have. Goyle snorted in his sleep, but didn’t wake.
“I… What do you want to know?”
“Who is it?” he whispered.
Harry faced the opposite direction and started unbuttoning his shirt. Out of politeness, he did not look down at Malfoy’s —
“Why do you think I didn’t—” Draco ripped a large piece from his breadstick and started dunking it violently into his soup. A few droplets landed on the tablecloth, vanishing as soon as they touched the fabric. “You should know better than to bring Blaise up to me, Father. We are no longer friends.”
“No, I don’t think I am.”
Leaning forward in excitement, Draco said, “How do we start?”
“Yes, ladies and gentlemen,” Lockhart continued, “I have the great pleasure and pride in announcing that this September, I will be taking up the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!”
“Your Slytherin cloak, where is that?”
“Draco,” came a voice from over his shoulder. It was his mother, standing tall in fashionable teal robes. Her white-blonde hair was the same shade as Draco’s, but hers was much longer. Today, it was arranged in a loose bun right above her neck. “Are you ready?”
There was someone else there in the memory now, Draco could feel it. But it wasn’t like they had appeared from out of nowhere, more like they had always been there, and Draco was only now able to detect them…
His father couldn’t possibly know that—
“It is,” said Potter. “I brought it with me when I brought my toothbrush.” He unfolded the wispy fabric and gestured for Draco to step closer, then wrapped it round Draco’s shoulders, which instantly disappeared.
“We should—” Draco said, before Potter kissed him again.
WEASLEY!” he yelled, hurling the parchment at the floor. “
Potter sniggered. “You think my name is
WARNING: we talk, briefly, about the canonical abuse of Harry in this chapter.
“And get rid of these flowers, will you? I’m tired of looking at them.”
He reached out, confident he would open the cabinet to find Harry Potter—
Draco slammed the drawer shut. “Nothing.”
Potter leaned forward. “Don’t pretend you’re thick all of a sudden, I know Hermione and Ron must’ve told you.”
The house-elf Apparated with a loud
Self-care managed
More nods from Goyle. “Yeah!” he said in his gruff, loud voice.
Draco lowered his wand hand, releasing the grasshopper. It vaulted away— large, brown, and conspicuous against the green of the grass. “Why all the sudden interest in my thoughts?”
didn’t hear any conversation,” Draco conspiratorially told his salad. When his father huffed, Draco smirked at the white tablecloth.
“You tried to keep Miss Parkinson from speaking, but it was an incomplete action— I could see her mouth moving. I didn’t catch what she said, but I can surmise that based on the context.” Professor Snape considered Draco. “You risked detention to give Potter a message about your—?”
Granger’s fine, neat handwriting greeted him from a thick envelope, and curiosity compelled Draco to immediately rip into it. Potter was never going to read these letters, why not have a look himself?
close my eyes to this. He’s gone, Lucius! There’s no reason for such an attack.”
Draco’s eyes fell shut. He relaxed his wrists as he slowed the tempo. Some ascending octave fingering brought the piece to a warmer, higher place as he transitioned from G minor to A major.
“You’ll probably have to crouch a little while you’re walking, Malfoy,” said Potter.
He was cut off by Draco pulling him into the classroom.
“Lemon blossoms,” Pansy murmured. “They…symbolise discretion. But why…?” She glanced between the photograph and Draco, and her eyes widened as she came to a conclusion. From her expression, she had either discovered the truth or was very close to it. Pointing her wand at him again, she said, “
you control your friends, Potter?” Malfoy interjected. “They’re bickering like they've been married for years.”
“Look, Pansy—”
Draco swallowed around what felt like a giant bat in the back of his throat. “There’s been a change of plan,” he said, surprised when his voice came out sounding steady and strong. “I want Potter to be able to make the decision whether or not to go back to Hogwarts. I want him to be informed. Merlin, I must be out of my mind, I know what he’s going to choose… Has Father told you about the Chamber of Secrets yet?”
*******
you pull yourself together?” Draco said. “It wasn’t that funny.”
The next time they met, a week later, Professor Snape told Draco he would not be quite as easy on him. He guided Draco through clearing his mind, and then Draco was immersed in his memories once more…
Enjoy!
“No, sir. But Dobby can find out, sir,” Dobby said hurriedly.
“All Dobby knows is that horrible, terrible things are going to happen at Hogwarts next year, and if Dobby gets an opinion, sir, he doesn’t think…some students — important students — should go there, not if the Chamber of Secrets is going to reopen…”
“I haven’t—” Draco grabbed her shoulders when she tried to push past him— “I haven’t gotten you anything, okay? Why won’t you believe me?”
The Ministry of Magic definitely, Definitely know about Harry's mistreatment. If they know which bedroom he sleeps in, they know more about his situation, yet they do nothing to help him. Probably because Dumbledore warned them off doing so, but still. This is nothing super new; we all know the Ministry is incompetent. Draco doesn't, though; he has no reason to mistrust them.
Draco sighed. “I think I know where to go.”
“Thank you,” Draco whispered. Pansy said nothing in response, but when Draco reached for her hand, she gave it a reassuring squeeze.
“Of course, dear,” said Mrs Malfoy, who was doing the same on her own plate. “How early were you thinking?”
think Harry’s going to turn into you?” said Weasley, who didn’t seem to have heard what Madam Pomfrey said.
Draco left the flowers where they were. He gathered the pile of books he had finished reading and placed them on his desk. He had to figure out what he was going to wear today.
Draco smirked up at him. “I’ll tell you right now, sir, that’s impossible.”
Perhaps he was enjoying this more than he should have been.
Professor Snape’s black eyes flashed with amusement. “I’m sure. Close your eyes, Draco, and humour me. I want to see what your baseline skills are.”
But like every other change, the pain down his back eventually stopped. When it did, Draco sat up and said, “This is ridiculous. We’re obviously not going to be able to sleep, might as well suffer together.”
“Not really.” Pansy scooted toward him and lowered her voice even further. She turned to look at the boy, who was seated in front of the windows, seemingly staring at nothing. “Between you and me, I don’t think he’s got that much going on inside that brain of his.”
“Perfect,” he said, accepting them with a frown and delicate hand.
that,” he said.
*******
Draco was glad to be so early. It gave him the opportunity to steady himself, which he did by watching students and their parents come through the stone barrier in small groups, and keeping an eye out for Potter. He didn’t look away once— not when Crabbe and Goyle ambled in and sat across from him, nor when Pansy arrived and started comparing the colour of all their arms, declaring it a good thing that Draco was by the window: “That way,” she said, “you’ll get some sun. You need to get out more, darling, you haven’t tanned at all over the summer.”
“Who do you mean by ‘yourself’?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco clutched the arms of his chair, breathing heavily. His pale hair clung to his paler forehead with sweat. “Why…do you keep going after my worst memories?”
After a time, Draco let out a final shaky sob and wiped his eyes. He was being ridiculous. Potter wasn’t his to protect. Potter wasn’t
“The Ministry wouldn't dare set foot in my house,” said a third, very gravelly voice. “Nor, I’d think, would they in yours.”
“Yeah? What have you done? Let’s list it out, shall we?” Pansy counted off on her fingers. “You’ve had Dobby steal his letters, you’ve
ignored me!’ ‘Did you see Potter at dinner? He was licking his spoon in the most
Draco scowled at the short letter and slapped it on top of Granger’s, which he'd left on the far corner of his desk. Forget what he had thought before, if he was going to learn anything useful about Potter, he needed to go directly to the source. He could easily make Dobby do it, since the elf was already Apparating back and forth to steal Potter’s post…so why not also have him also report what Potter was up to? What harm could possibly come of that?
The back lawn of Number 4, Privet Drive was covered in dew and spare materials. A man stood on the highest rungs of a ladder, which was propped against the side of the house. The only noise was the loud roar of a drill as the man secured bars onto a window.
“I suppose,” said Draco thoughtfully. He admired his — Potter’s — long, callused fingers and decided he didn’t want to risk either outcome. He and Potter both had nice hands.

“Forgive me for showing affection for my son,” she snapped. “My
Professor Snape nodded as if he had been expecting the question. “It is the memories we are most anxious to protect that are easiest to find. That anxiety draws the attention of the seeker more than mundane memories ever would.”
“Is there a reason you're doing this?” Malfoy said, then pushed his glasses up by the bridge. “We
“Give him some space, will you, Blaise?” Draco ordered, before admiring his reflection, or lack thereof, in the mirror. The only parts of himself he could see were his head and neck, which floated strangely above the floor.
“You have something of mine; I’d like it back!”
“We will start with a simple exercise. Close your eyes and try to empty your mind.”
Draco cursed, and Dobby got a strange expression on his face.
As if they knew they were being mentioned, Harry’s squirmed. He hadn’t thought about his heart, or lungs, or blood type, or anything like that. All he knew was that he and Malfoy now looked like each other— he’d assumed last night that everything else had righted themselves. Or rather,
Draco propped open the lid of the piano and threw
tell the difference between this—” he tapped Potter’s head—  “and what I normally do, right?”
“I…” Draco grimaced, then trailed off, not really wanting to start there.
Pansy motioned for him to be quiet, and went to poke her head out of the bathroom. “Crabbe and Goyle,” she said to Harry, who relaxed instantly.
And that’s what convinced him. Draco slid the metal frames off his face and everything came into focus. He tried very hard to control his breathing. Potter stood before him, looking more real as he put on his glasses than he had in the past three weeks. Every time Draco had looked into the mirror to see Harry Potter staring back, it had felt
“Close your eyes and picture several of those memories now…" said Professor Snape. "Live in each of them, briefly, and then move on. Tell me when you are ready.”
*******
After he’d showered and changed, Draco waited for Potter outside the Gryffindor changing rooms. “Congratulations, Potter,” he said when he saw the boy. He stretched out a hand. “Another great save; you deserve the win.”
“Shh,” she said, looking very amused. “Don’t you ever listen? Get up, Potter.”
The news hit Draco like a bright purple, triple decker bus. He choked on a bite of treacle tart.
“But I didn’t think you’d
until you have been released. Okay?”
Narrowing his eyes, Draco said, “Yes, well, forget about Pansy.”
“Talk about
“Nothing,” said Potter, eyes ticking between Draco and the wide mirror. “It’s— Nothing.”
Something soft brushed against Draco’s hand. He leapt backward, and his fear quickly turned to awe as he watched dust-pink gillyflowers pop up all along the top of his desk. His pale eyes widened further. He hadn’t performed wandless magic since last summer, though even that had been unusual. Most wizards had control over their powers by the time they were seven, and in any case, the piano had been an accident…
Draco stole one final look at Potter before he left, clutching his arm where a particularly heavy tome had struck him. Hagrid moved, unknowingly, in front of Potter and Draco caught Granger’s eye instead; he scowled to cover for his lingering gaze.
“Why do you give a toss about Potter’s family?” Pansy asked. “Not so long ago, you might have said he deserved what he’s got.”
Reaching up, Draco pulled a string of yellow flowers toward himself, marvelling at their beauty in spite of the reason they were there. The flowers were incredibly soft and spherical, and their petals gave way to his fingers, bowing when he squeezed them. He let the string go and it slid across his palm; it swung back into place amongst the others, knocking them briefly out of place. Silently, Draco watched them until they came to rest.
“Draco—”
“Though if his grades don't pick up, that may indeed be all he is fit for—”
“Agreed,” said Malfoy.
“Then it gets worse,” said Madam Pomfrey. “But if there’s a chance we can fix all this, why not take it? I have yet to find a spell that did the job, but this is an unusual problem— perhaps it requires an unusual solution. Now,” she added, readying her wand, “if you’ll stand?”
Professor Snape spoke in his familiar monotone: “Conjure an image of a very tall, very mature tree…”
“Don’t panic! Give me two seconds,” said Potter, and he brushed past Draco to go into the dormitory, leaving Draco alone with his thoughts. He had been stupid not to consider how long their conversation might take. Yes, it had been very early when he left Gryffindor Tower, but it was rapidly becoming not-early, and there could be any number of people downstairs.
want her to know we just made out?”
“Has Father told you what that is?”
“You will be successful eventually. With more practice, you can use more substantial protections; there’s no reason to be ashamed—”
Right as the clock struck eleven, the train lurched forward. Draco shook his head, hardly daring to blink as the station slid away. A flurry of movement outside the window made Draco press himself against it, then turn his neck so far it was almost backward on his shoulders. The adult Weasleys had started bolting for the gateway, looking very like they had misplaced something…
“Sir?”
“Selling?” Mr Borgin asked, looking rather put out. Draco wanted to laugh. It was the same exchange every time his father came to the shop. Mr Borgin had to be really dim to imagine they were there to buy anything, or maybe he was simply too optimistic.
Pansy furrowed her eyebrows. “Why do you ask?”
“Actually,” said Potter, “I’ve been meaning to talk to you about that… When we go back to classes, you can't call people by their last names. I almost never do.”
The noise Draco let out was somewhere between a whimper and a sob. His father had ruined everything! How could Draco give Potter his letters now, when so much had changed? Potter would only be
“Not much,” Draco admitted, “Everything I’ve found is mostly speculation. No one seems to agree on what the creature is, if the chamber exists, where it might be, how to open it— the only thing most writers can agree on is that we know too little about the Chamber itself.”
Draco stuck a hand out to push Potter’s arm, but at the last second decided against it. “Er, actually… Blaise? I think you’d better do this.”
“Surely some arrangement could be made for those of us in a hurry,” said Mr Malfoy genially.
Potter sighed. “Okay, but only if you let me—”
oppose me on this? And in front of our son?”
Draco couldn’t explain his fascination with Potter. And it was, he decided, a fascination, and nothing else. “Fascination” had none of the romance that “interest” or “appeal” or “obsession” did. “Fascination” simply was. As in, it was fascinating that Potter had so quickly grown attached to Weasley on this very train; that Potter could be so bad at Potions when his mother’s talent had been equal to Snape’s; that he was so skilled at flying when he couldn’t have had any practice. As in, it was fascinating how much time Draco could waste thinking about how fascinating Potter was.
He huffed. “You know, I can’t decide what’s worse about this: getting your woefully shameful vision, your complete disaster for hair, or the sheer agony of turning very slowly into you. And not just the physical pain. The

His father smirked. “You don’t need to be shy, Draco, it’s all right to be excited. Finally, you’ll be getting the education you deserve, after that
Potter was exciting to look at— there was so much contrast between his brown skin and black hair. In pictures of Draco, it always looked like he had already begun to fade— ghostly, indistinct. Potter’s features were bold and well defined. Pleasant. Attractive, even. His unruly hair, under a certain lens, wasn’t
“Oh, I didn’t.” Blaise glanced up again, touching the tip of his quill to his lips. “But ‘you’ came back from the hospital wing as a different person, and ‘Potter’ was acting suspiciously a lot like you; it wasn’t terribly difficult to figure out.”
They weren’t alone…
“You don’t have it,” said Mrs Malfoy cooly. As she leaned forward, some of her blonde hair fell over one shoulder. “Eliminating Muggle-borns will not make your blood any purer.”
“Didn't think you liked veal, Harry,” said Longbottom, after Draco had served himself a large helping of it.
Draco was humming when he entered the dining room that night, and bounced minutely as he plopped into his chair.
“Let’s try again,” he said, pushing his black hair out of his eyes, “but first, go back through the memories you prepared. Do not use the one with you, Crabbe, and Goyle flying— that wasn’t long enough, nor did it keep you focussed. Find something completely separate from Potter.”
“Get the door,” Draco said, scanning the room to make sure it was truly as empty as it seemed. The morning light was growing stronger with each second, streaming in through the latticed windows and stretching to illuminate the first row of unoccupied desks.
“To call a git by any other name…”
“Oh?” Pansy said, sounding unconvinced. “How so?”
Harry snorted, and Pansy swiped a silencing hand back at him. Even from behind, it was easy to tell she was smiling.
As his mother breezed over to scan the bookcase, Draco wandered about the rest of the room, peering into and behind his father’s possessions, growing more and more frantic the longer they went without finding anything. The large pots were only home to the plants that grew in them; the end tables contained much of the same rubbish as the desk; the filing cabinets had only boring paperwork in them; the floorboards seemed very well secured; the curtains expelled only dust when Draco shook them; the walls looked undisturbed; the pictures on the walls did not swing to the side to reveal extra storage. It seemed he and his mother would never find the diary, until—
“I’m coming through.”
“I don’t want to argue right now,” said Mr Malfoy.
“Yeah, the goal is usually to make them see the world from a different perspective, but, you know. Literally.”
think you’re all anyone cares about in this awful place.”
“Oh,” said Harry. He had always thought Malfoy badmouthed him when he wasn’t around.
“Blast it!” Draco yelled, and kicked his bed. “Blast it all! You saw the door, how many times d’you suspect they fed him, huh? Or let him out to use the toilet? Those disgusting harpies kept Potter in there like a caged animal!” He kicked the bed again.
“I don’t have to answer that,” Draco snapped.
“I think,” Mr Malfoy said quietly, “that may very well be the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Not selling books until a certain time — and they aren’t new, either — utter tosh. I’ll have another word with that shopkeeper, then, after I’ve found—” he looked more closely at the parchment— “
Mr Malfoy sighed. “I am only trying to keep you all apprised. I am not personally responsible for the creation of this Act, you understand, and there’s only so much influence I can use to prevent it.” He hesitated. “Does that satisfy you, McNair?”
“For the time being,” Draco replied warily, “yes. Why?”
Hey y'all! Finished this more quickly than I thought I would. Will continue to update sporadically, so apologies for that.
The strange sensation was back, but this time Draco recognised it for what it truly was. This wasn’t nerves about being exposed as an eavesdropper. This was hatred. Intense, blinding hatred. Maybe he
Auxerre’s cobbled streets were overrun by Muggles as well, with their swerving “cars” “honking,” their wildly unfashionable clothing choices, and their immobile shop displays. While Draco was not completely unfamiliar with their lifestyle, he couldn’t help wondering if Potter had felt this out of place when he had stepped into Diagon Alley, or if he felt that way every day, sharing a house with three Muggles who despised anything magical. In any case, Draco was glad when they left the city three days later.
Oops, this fic ended up being longer than I planned. This whole thing was supposed to be one chapter, maybe 4,000 words, tops. Next chapter will probably be long too, double oops. I can’t write short stuff to save my life; hopefully y’all are into that

Early the next morning, Draco went down to the Slytherin common room, alone. When he arrived in front of the entrance, he nearly spoke the password, forgetting for a moment that he didn’t have it. Feeling rather foolish, Draco knocked on the bare wall. A slot appeared between two stones, and Draco said, “Fetch me Pansy Parkinson. Tell her it’s urgent.”
The entire room held its breath, waiting for something magical to happen. A light, maybe, or a sound, if not a complete reversion back into the proper bodies. Something to signify that what had happened last night, and what they were trying now, had a purpose.
But in the meantime, it was quite fun, pretending to be Malfoy. Pansy had assured Harry that he wouldn’t have to go round insulting everyone all the time, which he had been dreading. No, the only person he had to focus on was Malfoy, and it was all too easy to get him angry.
“I DON’T WANT TO FOCUS!” Draco said, standing. He swayed on his feet, then bent over, taking in one great, shuddering breath.
“You told him? Goodness, when did you find the—?” Granger nodded slowly. “This morning.
“Yes,” Draco said, grey gaze dropping to the desktop in front of him. He couldn’t bear to look at Professor Snape anymore.
“You two shouldn’t be in here,” Madam Pomfrey scolded, and tried to shoo the pair out. “The privacy of my patients—”
Mr Potter, pictured above with friends Hermione Granger (middle) and Ronald Weasley (right), started Hogwarts little better than any of us (barring, of course, defeating He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named). How was he to know that within his first few weeks he would become the youngest Seeker Hogwarts has seen (in an entire century)? Yes, you read that right, Harry Potter was Seeker for the Gryffindor Quidditch team last year! If his skill is truly as exceptional as described, he will likely snare the same position for many years to come.
Draco sniffled. “Why is it so easy for you to find everything I don’t want you to see?”
“Draco,” Professor Snape said calmly.
Breakfast lasted a fair bit longer than Draco wanted it to. He knew Potter was hardly going to make his decision in such a short amount of time — it was a big thing Draco was asking of him — and he was even
The look of surprise, and then embarrassment, on Potter’s face was worth it. Draco gave him an exaggerated simper before walking the correct way again. He spotted the door to an unused classroom and sped up.

“If you’re not back to normal when you’re discharged,” Hermione said cautiously, “that could come in handy. Unless we want to confuse the whole school, it would be smart to figure out how to act like each other.”
idea to send Potter any acknowledgement of the occasion, however anonymous he was able to make the card.
“Busy time at the Ministry, I hear. All those raids…I hope they’re paying you overtime?” He thrust the bag of books he had just purchased into Draco’s arms, stepped forward, and took a very old one from Ginny’s cauldron, tutting as he inspected it. “Obviously not. Dear me, what’s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don’t even pay you well for it?”
Despite his words, Pansy started across the room and opened his closet— “Does that mean there’s more than one?” —and slid his clothes aside, peering into the shadows beneath them.
“So…” Draco said. “In essence, you want me to lie?”
“So did you,” said Harry as he climbed back into bed.
“I know that,” said Potter, leaning his elbows on the mattress. “But this isn’t Polyjuice, is it? We’ve established that. There’s so much we don’t know about what’s happening. Aren’t you the least bit curious?”
. After a long train ride, the back was even worse than usual; it looked like Potter had spent the entire train ride doing headstands or Merlin knew what else. Sometimes, Draco swore Potter messed his hair up on purpose, that he somehow knew just how much it riled Draco up to see it like that.
“True. The risk is great,” Professor Snape said solemnly. “It’s up to you, I can’t force you. Though perhaps…” He straightened. Started pacing back and forth in front of his desk. “Instead of my choosing something at random, what if you described something to me beforehand— something you yourself chose? You would have more control over what I see, and the memory would surface on its own, having been pulled forward by your explaining it…
“Who else knows?”
Obviously. Potter wasn’t a complete nitwit, however good his impression of one was. Why Weasley had even bothered to keep those useless words in his letter escaped Draco.

Instead of retiring to his bedroom — Draco knew he was hardly going to sleep
“No,” Pansy agreed with a grin. “But it was fun. And anyway, the most important thing for you to get right is how often you talk about yourself.”
Pansy shrugged. “It was the quickest way to get them to leave.”
“Yeah, why is that?” Harry crossed back to the doorway. “He’s hardly ever alone. If he’s not with Crabbe and Goyle, he's with you, or all three of you.”
She stamped on his foot. “Do It,” she said, then smiled thinly at Theodore Nott, who had glanced over.
Harry snickered at the thought of Malfoy testing out different walks in front of the same mirror. “Were you coaching him, too?”
, after all. This was special.
Draco inhaled angrily through his nose. Tears pricked his eyes.

“I’ll let him tell you, then,” said Draco, “and save myself the trouble.”
The corners of Professor Snape’s mouth slid upward again. “Patience, Draco,” he said, “there are several things I want to cover before we begin. Now. When I enter your mind, are you aware, then, that you’re not experiencing reality?”
, Malfoy?”
“Dobby,” Draco whispered.
“I suppose so. I’m finished with them for now,” said Madam Pomfrey, glancing at Harry and Malfoy, “
Draco’s heart stopped. Was it possible Pansy knew something of what happened? She had a strange expression on her face… But how could she possibly know anything? They hadn’t spoken in weeks.
“You realise that only gives us four days?” said Weasley.
. You know, I think all your ideas of fame have finally caught up with you.”
“Is it really.” Draco peered at him. “Very well. Though I really shouldn't be seen calling you Harry or Potter, since we've switched.”
“I have no doubt. But that is my precise point. Those feelings hold great power over you, and your intense desire to keep them to yourself might be enough to find success at this stage. I have been very generous with your privacy — I have not pried into that which you clearly want to protect — but I’m afraid I can think of no other alternatives.”
But… If he couldn’t prevent Potter from going back to Hogwarts, Draco would have to learn everything he could about the Chamber of Secrets. (
“Pansy,” Draco complained as she closed the closet doors and sorted through his dresser. He stood by, watching as she held up a pair of his underpants with a smirk, not inclined to interfere yet. When she went for his desk, however, he threw himself in front of her. “Stop, I haven’t got anything for you!”
Draco stared at the stone floor. He opened his mouth, but found the words had dissolved before they reached his tongue.
“Fine.” Draco took a breath, trying to calm himself. “Hermione,” he said, pleased when it came out cordially, “what are you saying for the second part of our Transfiguration homework? Since you’ve already finished.”
This time, when Potter laughed, the awkwardness had vanished entirely from his voice. “You won’t hear me say it again.”
Neither boy got much sleep that night. As Madam Pomfrey had discerned, the transformations were oddly staggered. One moment Draco would be perfectly fine, and the next, one of his feet would start to feel like it was being shoved into a very small bottle. As Draco was somewhat taller than Potter, he had plenty of time to figure out the correct analogy for the sensation. The worst was arguably when his spine, and only his spine, constricted so violently he thought that every single vertebrae had been broken.
“Right,” said Draco, feeling a lot better now that things seemed more normal between them. “We have to find the diary — someone at school will have it, I’m sure — and then we’ve got to destroy it.”
“Okay,” Draco said softly. He was crying freely now.
But then the optic nerve found its tether. The pain vanished. Draco could open his eye. The sight he was met with in the mirror made him dizzily grab the sink. His left iris was now a brilliant green, and half of his vision was incredibly poor.
“It seems the switching process has finished,” Madam Pomfrey announced after several long minutes. “Frankly, I’m not sure if that’s good or bad news.”
“Not,” said Mr Malfoy, “when it serves to be a distraction and general annoyance to those of us trying to hold a conversation.”
“Hi,” Potter said back, in a similar tone. He pressed his fingers to Draco’s chin, much the same way he had done weeks before— like he was testing a knife’s edge. Then he ran his fingers along Draco’s jawline, green eyes flashing with clear delight.
Dobby looked away, perhaps wondering if he had said too much.
. She must have been talking to Blaise.
“Not when you is expelled for it,” said Dobby.
“Then we will use that for future practice. You’ve done well. As we move forward, keep this…shadow in mind. Try to look for it, and recognise it for what it represents— someone that does not belong.”
“Malfoy?” Potter asked. He leapt out of his bed and bent over Draco’s.

“You tried very hard to protect that memory,” Professor Snape said, bringing Draco back to the present.
“I suppose you’re right.”
“Flowers mostly, different ones, but last night there was a tree—”
“I haven’t been
“I think not,” said Draco, opening the door further.
Potter beamed. “Oh, brilliant! What is it? What have we got to do?”
At 6:48 am, Draco Malfoy sat bolt upright in bed. He slapped a hand to his eye, where a deep, stabbing pain had begun out of nowhere. It felt as if his brain was trying to escape through the eye socket, armed with a sharp sabre.
want to do it, and not because Potter’s in my body.”
Draco jerked his head up and down in an angry nod. “You…” He nodded some more, mind reeling with a million questions and accusations. He wanted to hit her, or shake her, or something, but he settled for the one question that had been bothering him this whole time: “Why did you choose a curse that would make switching so painful?”
Mrs Malfoy’s dressing gown stirred around her ankles when he joined her. With a tap of her wand and a murmured “

“Ah, the Hand of Glory!” said Mr Borgin as he hobbled over. “Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine taste, sir.”
Weasley dropped his stack into his sister’s cauldron, turning as red as she still was. He lunged toward Draco, but Potter and Granger held him back.
On the surface, Potter seemed as plain and uninteresting as his friends. A Gryffindor in every possible way, and certainly not worth Draco’s time. Or friendship. And yet…there was undoubtedly something compelling about Potter, aside from his famed defeat of the Dark Lord. Potter was more than that. He was more than just a boy. He was more than just a Gryffindor. He was…indescribable.
Obviously. Draco sneered. It was easy to turn on her, to find the words that would deepen her scowl: “Potter, you’ve got yourself a
Someone pushed their chair back in.
But Potter didn’t come through the barrier, Draco was sure of it. When the Weasleys arrived, Potter was missing. Draco stared at the stone wall, feeling the impact of each second as it passed, but no one else came.
“I thought you were going to buy me a present,” said Draco.
“Done,” said Mr Malfoy.
Ginny scoffed. “You could ask
“Okay,” Draco breathed. He turned toward Potter, who had an almost fond expression on his face. “Thank you.”
“So…” Pansy nudged Draco’s shoulder with her own. The devilish smile she gave him made him worry what she was going to say next. “Does that mean you’re hoping to…
“We did

“I found the solution to our problem.”
“More threats!” McNair cried, which was accompanied by the screech of a chair being thrust back.
“It’d be Harry, wouldn’t it?” said Longbottom. He had already filled his container with snapping leaves. “It’s his body, right?”
“Pity,” Blaise deadpanned.
The way Weasley looked back and forth between him and Potter confirmed it.
Draco sat up even straighter, so much so he nearly lifted himself out of the chair entirely. “I am not

“I think so,” Harry said.
Draco pushed the book into Potter’s palm. “Page ninety-four.”
So Potter suddenly didn’t want the attention, did he? Showed what Granger knew. Potter practically begged people to stare at him, what with the way he hunched his shoulders to appear humble, or how he hardly ever made eye contact so that people talking to him would want to find his eyes, or how he made a show of dragging his hair over his forehead to hide his lightning bolt scar, or—

“Yes, sir,” Dobby said, and Disapparated.
Dobby nodded, then snapped his fingers.
“Busy year?” Mrs Weasley asked.
The mystery they posed had to be forgotten. He couldn’t afford any more diversions from his plan. But even as he thought this, Draco knew his drive to keep Potter from Hogwarts was waning. Since reading Potter’s letters, Draco had begun to find life at Malfoy Manor to be somewhat of a burden, rather than the privilege he had been taught to appreciate. And in the following weeks, he became even more sure.

Draco was ushered into the drawing room. His mother scanned the entryway before closing the door and pulling him to the far corner.
Draco went silent as he did as Professor Snape had asked. His heart was thumping erratically. He understood why this was necessary, but he wished it wasn’t. Really, he wished he could suddenly perform this small bit of magic without having to practice at all— that would make the whole process a lot less distressing. Because Draco
I know that Snape has a conversation with Draco in book six, where Snape thinks Bellatrix taught Draco Occlumency, but honestly I think it’s more likely Narcissa did it in canon. I believe she’s an exceptional Occlumens (she really has to be), and this fic sorta builds on that a bit; she’s very skilled, but Snape is too. I have it where she thinks Snape’d be a better teacher than she might be (he regularly teaches other things, though of course she’d have no idea he was teaching Harry Occlumency) and thus trusts him to do a good job, which is why she sends Draco to learn from him in this fic. That’s all, thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

When Pansy shook her head, Crabbe said, “Millicent? Er…Daphne. No, Professor Sprout. Celestina Warbeck!”
“I have been wondering about this too…” said Professor Snape. He brought a long, sallow hand up to his face and started absentmindedly rubbing his cheek, like he was feeling nonexistent stubble. “Perhaps if you prepare, in advance, several memories to use in defense — safe memories, that is — they might be enough to ground you, giving you more control. That is what’s currently missing from your attempts, which are, again, very good…”

They Disapparated.
“Fantasy?” Draco said, grasping onto any part of that sentence that he thought would keep them from talking more about Potter.
“Is that how you intend to go out today, Draco?” he asked, fastening the last button of his forest-green coat.
There, Draco spent the rest of the night looking for all the information he could find on the Chamber of Secrets, on Salazar Slytherin, on dangerous creatures, on anything that even remotely related to the upcoming school year. Up and down the curling wooden staircases he went, and back and forth across the walkways, arms full of possibilities that he piled on one of the tables. He rifled through old newspapers, eyes moving quicker than they ever had, scanning for keywords; choice newspapers joined his steadily growing pile, opened to the most relevant articles. He couldn’t afford to rest until he had a better idea of what he and everyone else would be walking into.
“That attitude is the reason you are second in your class.”
“Yes.”
“I understand, sir,” said Mr Borgin, who was turning like he wanted to go into the back room, “of course, let me see…”
“Draco,” Professor Snape said, sounding both disappointed and angry.
Mrs Malfoy scoffed. “Like that matters. Accidents happen all the time.”

to look forward to. The Weasleys must have treated Potter much better than the Dursleys had, and he was sure to look healthier… If he did, that would mean Draco’s efforts over the summer hadn’t been a complete disaster.
“Yes, my birthday!” Pansy’s arms uncrossed so quickly that they made a slapping sound as they connected with her knees. “How lovely that you finally remembered. An entire day late.”
“Yes,” he said forcefully, “to everyone I am currently friends with.”
“Students like Harry Potter, you mean?” said Draco flatly.
Draco closed it. “None of your business.”

Pansy nodded, humour plain in her brown eyes. “I see,” she said, turning her head away dramatically. “Then I’ll be on my way.”

Pansy crossed her arms. “Are you just going to repeat my questions, or are you going to answer them?”
“Don’t,” Draco warned. “You’ll ruin it.”
He brought a hand to his mouth. All flowers had meanings attached, and his mother had taught him every single one when he was younger, as part of his studies. Up until that point, he had shrugged off the meanings of the flowers he grew accidentally, but now… Now it was impossible to ignore the significance of the tree standing before him.
But if Draco did that, he would be just as bad as his father— and that was it, wasn’t it? His father
“That’s okay,” said Pansy. She laid down beside him. “You don’t have to tell me. We can just lie here if you like, we don’t have to talk.”
The greasy-haired shopkeeper had appeared behind the counter. Draco took the opportunity to regain some control over himself.
“But you were able to see into my mind, right, sir?” Draco said.
“Madam Pomfrey,” Draco said, nodding to her. He went to stand on the other side of the bed and was unruffled to see Potter there, looking up at him with cold, grey eyes. His nose bore the pinkish marks of the nibs on his glasses, which he had in his fist.
“I’m merely trying to understand how to keep the pretense going,

A long moment passed as Draco tried to figure out the best way to answer. He hadn’t said anything about how the Chamber of Secrets connected to Potter, and could feel Pansy’s eyes on him, expectant. Under different circumstances, Draco might have admired her shrewdness. “I’m not sure,” he said finally, directing the statement at his folded hands.
“No,” said Harry and Malfoy.
likely to just up and kiss Draco in the middle of the Great Hall, so that was definitely out. But knowing those things didn’t make the wait any easier.
A month ago, Draco would have loved to see the back of Potter. Now, it seemed that Draco could think of nothing and no one else. It certainly wasn’t what he intended when he started his own plan. Had he known he would end up like this, curled up on his bed like a paltry child, he never would have read those damned letters.

Professor Snape closed and locked the door. “There will be no need to take notes.”
Draco’s eyes bulged. “WHAT?” He threw off the covers and leapt to his feet. He spun into his dressing gown, skated into his slippers. “Take me there. Now.”
She raced to the desk and Draco chased her, reaching from behind to close every drawer she opened, hoping against hope she wouldn’t find the—

Mr Malfoy’s mouth was small. “I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin.”
Mrs Malfoy was reading when he entered the room. Despite being propped up in bed by several pillows, her posture was impeccable. Her eyes tightened in the corners when she saw he was alone. “Thank you, dear. This was unexpected,” she said and set her novel aside.

“No, I didn’t. Everything was the same.”
He swiped his fingers into the clear blue liquid, rubbed them against his opposite hand in a circular motion, and pulled the product a couple times through Potter’s blonde hair, making sure to spread it evenly. “See? It’s already starting to look better. All that’s left is to comb it out, and that part’s easy. The potion and my haircut will do most of the work, so luckily for you, you don’t have to be very creative.”
After that first truly successful attempt at ejecting Professor Snape from his mind, Draco found the results much easier to replicate. Soon, he was ready to move on to other things…
“Draco fancies someone!” Pansy said, clasping her hands together over her heart.

In Diagon Alley, Draco and his father stopped in many of the shops to get Draco’s school supplies. All the while, Draco kept an eye on the windows for signs of Potter, who was not in Madam Malkin's when Draco was fitted for new, longer robes; he wasn’t in Eeylops Owl Emporium when Draco bought some food and treats for Talos; he wasn’t in Slug and Jigger’s Apothecary when Draco scoured the drawers and shelves for Potions ingredients; nor was he in Quality Quidditch Supplies, where Mr Malfoy not only paid for a new broom for Draco, but for the entire existing Slytherin team.
“What do you think?” Draco asked.
The photographer hastened to the front of the crowd, pushing people out of the way to get another shot of Lockhart. He aimed his camera at the man, but before he could snap another picture, Lockhart stood abruptly, shouting, “It
On a more positive note, we've got more dramatic irony here too!! :D
with the person in that picture you saved?”
Her mouth dropped progressively as she read. “Oh,” she said finally. “Yes, here it is.” She turned the book so Draco could read it, and pointed to a small section at the very bottom of the page. “That second footnote, just there. I guess I got so excited by the whole idea, I must have missed it. The author really should have made that bigger.
“Malfoys do not hum,” Mr Malfoy scolded as a plate of salad appeared in front of each of them.
When he realised, Draco drew on past moments of boredom: he never thought he’d be glad to revisit the time when his mother spent six long hours at a garden centre, nor learning Muggle American history in primary school, but if they protected him from the Dark Lord, they were worth reliving.
There was nothing for it— Mr Malfoy’s plan was in motion.
“Cheers,” Draco said, handing over his assignment. Maybe Granger wasn’t so bad. “What else do you do for him?”
“Actually, I think he’s been doing a great job. As have you,” said Granger, nodding at Draco. “You even talk about ‘Malfoy’ all the time, that’s what really sells it.”
Someone called his name.
This, finally, was enough to end Draco’s shock. “I need air,” he mumbled, and without sparing a glance at either of his parents, fled the room. The door slammed behind him, cutting off the remainder of his parents’ argument.
“Not bad, eh?” said Pansy, who had been watching him look around.
nauseating
“I never fake anything.” Draco dragged the desk chair in front of their floor-length mirror. “Sit,” he said, pushing Potter onto it and standing behind him. “Look at yourself.”
“There’s no picture,” Draco said, too quickly. Heat started to rise up his neck.
“Malfoy,” he heard, and it wasn’t his own voice coming from the other boy anymore. It was Potter’s: gentle and steady and slightly reedy. He withdrew, but Draco could still feel the heat of his body, inches away. “I’d like my glasses back, if you don't mind.”
“I can’t stand him, Pansy,” said Draco, hoping his face wasn’t flushed, “it’s perfectly reasonable if I think of him.”
Harry leaned forward. “Everything.”
“You should have seen her, Father. She couldn’t have been more obvious. Practically leaping at him the whole time he was talking with her mother. It’s absurd. I don’t know

appeared on the parchment.) Draco was furious. His father had forced him into a decision he wasn’t prepared to make. Because of his father, lives would be at risk.
“Three guesses who it is,” Pansy sang.
“Largely, you did: you managed to produce two good distractions at the end there before they led back to Potter. That might have been the most I could ask of you tonight, considering our conversations have, as you said, revolved around him quite a bit. Regardless, I would say that was a decent effort on your part,” said Professor Snape.
Draco chuckled. “As if I could ever grow tired of you, Pansy,” he said, hugging her briefly before reaching for her trunk.
So he showed promise, then. “Yes,” Draco said,
“Right.” Madam Pomfrey made a sweeping motion with her wand and curtains closed around their beds, isolating them from the rest of the hospital. “You two have been here enough times to know where my office is. If you need anything, don’t hesitate to come get me, or to shout.
Panting angrily, Draco stepped away from Potter. If he had been wearing robes, he would have clutched them tighter around himself. “You ingrate!” he said, pulling the wrinkles from his pyjama shirt.
“This is ridiculous,” said Malfoy, separating himself from Harry and pushing his sleeves back down.
“Don’t say that. It makes me think you’ve stopped listening again.” Pansy nudged Draco with a brown sandal. “If you keep ignoring me like this, I’m going to start taking it personally. I’ll be forced towards the conclusion that you’d rather be friends with, imagine the horror,

him?”
Granger and Weasley’s smiles were tight as they waved him off. They were probably sad they couldn’t see him every day over the break, like they had at Hogwarts. So needy.
“Dobby,” said Draco to the warm, mid-evening air of his bedroom. He had spent the last several hours locked inside, mentally writing and tweaking his instructions so they would be clear.
Thanks to everyone who's read this, and those who have left kudos!
So Gilderoy Lockhart was drawing the crowds. That meant Potter might be drawn there too.
“Oh… O- only when Harry Potter burns food, sir. Or misbehaves, or…” Dobby winced. “Actually, sir, Harry Potter does not eat very much, from what Dobby sees.”
“Well come on, then.” Pansy seized his arm and dragged him through the manor. Outside, they navigated the maze of low hedges separating the back gardens, passing the large peafowl aviary, which was empty. Dobby had released them all earlier that morning and they now roamed the gardens, the white of their feathers brilliant against the colourful blooms.
“I’ll do as I like,
“Why should I care?” Malfoy shouted back.
“What,” Draco wheezed around a perceivable lump in his voice box, “were you thinking?” He pushed Potter off of him.

like a git,” he said, “but physically, I suppose I could be worse.”
Harry gave a surprised laugh. “You’d betray his trust that fast?”
He hadn’t been outside yet, but already Draco could feel the heat rolling toward him from where he stood behind the front doors. In the distance, the sky was dark, threatening rain. His father was anticipating guests. His mother had announced a splitting headache and had retired upstairs.
“But I can’t—” Draco dragged the sleeves of his school robes down over his hands. “Who knows how he’d react?”
Enjoy! :)
“Yes,” Draco said thinly, “the transformations were excruciating. And slow.”
“No, you listen to me,” Pansy interrupted. “When you told me about your plan, I thought, ‘Okay, here’s something I think Draco can manage. Sure, he’s a little overly determined to get Potter out of Hogwarts, but I can understand that. He thinks Potter’s annoying. Fine.’ But now…” She frowned. “Now, you’ve either changed your plan completely or Potter’s distracted you from it, and I can’t help thinking it’s that second thing.”
“Aren’t we, though?” said Pansy.
Mr Malfoy looked over at him. “Anxious to start the year, are we?”
“Don’t worry about it, Crabbe,” said Pansy, when the boy frowned at his wand. “We’re only in our second year, I’d have been shocked if that had done something.”
Malfoy sneered, and Harry found it very unpleasant to see that expression on his own face.
why you agreed so quickly to help me, isn’t it?” Draco asked. “Not because I ordered you to, but because you knew that if my original plan worked, Potter wouldn’t—  Well, he wouldn’t be in danger. You care about him too.”
“Well, anyhow,” said Pansy, “it must have been important, seeing as it somehow distracted you from my” she posed comically, crooking an arm carelessly over a bent knee, “charming conversation skills. What were you thinking about?”
A mustachioed man, joined by a tall woman and a blonde boy, appeared next to Potter. The man was frowning so fiercely it seemed to have turned his face purple from the effort. Gruffly, he asked, “Ready, are you?”
Only two more weeks, and then this section is finished!
“Yeah?” asked Weasley. “Prove it.”
“See you over the summer, then,” Weasley said, awkwardly adjusting his grip on his trunk.
Draco took one last look at Potter before closing the photograph in a drawer on his desk. Then he reached for the newest letter for Potter.
Marriage isn’t always for love. It’s normal, it’s all perfectly normal…
He made it down the stairs in time to see Potter tip the stack into Ginny Weasley’s cauldron. Enraged that she would, yet again, make it impossible to talk to Potter alone, Draco almost didn’t notice how both of them were covered in a fine layer of soot, or that Potter looked both taller and skinnier than he had done last June.
It must have had something to do with this latest fixation on Potter.
“Mr Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,” said Mr Borgin, whose tone implied anything but. “Delighted — and young Master Malfoy, too — charmed. How may I be of assistance?” He started to reach below the counter. “I must show you, just in today, very reasonably priced—”
, Weasley?” Malfoy snapped from the next bed, adjusting Harry’s round glasses angrily on his own face.
Professor Snape was frowning. “You wanted to be a part of Potter’s club?” he asked.

Draco touched the ruffled petals of the closest bundle. He knew strong emotion could sometimes bring out incredible magic, but why now? And why flowers of all things? Why
“Potter, I've seen myself
“I have not been visited yet. The name Malfoy still commands a certain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome. There are rumours about a new Muggle Protection Act— no doubt that flea-bitten, Mudblood-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind it, and as you see, some of these potions might make it
Mrs Malfoy shook her head. “That’s the thing. The compartment in your father’s desk was empty when I looked. And I asked Dobby, he said Lucius took it with him today.”
“No!” Draco interrupted, feeling his face and neck grow hotter. He didn’t need to see the next part of her scenario. “No, I- I- I can’t do that!”
Draco whirled around to examine his reflection. His dark hair was messy, but no more so than usual, and his glasses weren’t crooked on the bridge of his nose. He couldn’t see anything out of place with his robes or tie, either. “Why are you laughing?” he demanded.
“Yes, sir.”
This chapter's got Victorian flower language, babyyyy! :D Link in the endnotes for my resource, but I'll also tell you what each flower symbolises there too. Don't want to leave y'all guessing what they mean. And if you don't want to know, feel free to ignore this and the endnotes.
Draco pursed his lips and tried not to get defensive. Pansy was sure to comment on that, too, and he didn’t want to get into it. Not with her, not after Blaise… “It’s possible to hate your enemy and pity them at the same time, you know,” he said, as calmly as he could manage.
“And here I was thinking that we might move past all that,” Draco said, leaning forward to playfully pinch the other boy’s chin.
Thankfully, Granger intervened. She reached for Draco’s plate and held it toward Weasley. “Will you finish this? I don’t know where Harry’s mind is tonight, but he certainly won't be eating it.”
“No. It was merely curiosity on my part. But it’s late,” Professor Snape announced, “and you are tired. As am I.”
“Should I be flattered you call me Malfoy, then?”
“Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,” Draco replied nastily. “I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for that lot.”
He faced Dobby, who looked equal parts worried and horrified. “Take me to Weasley’s house,” Draco said, “I need to know if Potter’s really there.”
“So… You…” Draco managed.
“Of course not! I thought maybe Potter’s family were angry with him or something that day, or…well, maybe in a rush?” Exasperated, Draco’s hands flew up. “But they weren’t— they always treat him like that. Can you imagine treating
The morning of the thirty-first of July, Draco woke with the knowledge that it was Harry Potter’s birthday. He lay in bed a good long while, staring at the constellations on his ceiling, trying to convince himself it was an absolutely
Draco didn’t want to open his eyes, despite the logical part of his brain telling him it wouldn’t be like that first time— that the reversal had worked. He rested his forehead against Potter’s, and noticed the sore spot where Potter’s scar used to be had vanished. He remembered the first night all too well, when the scar had seared itself onto his skin like a metal brand… How it had burned sometimes, randomly, often at night— a deep, pulsing ache that had woken him up suddenly, without explanation.
Mrs Malfoy’s blue eyes were calm. “I think the Dark Lord is very hard to please, and Harry Potter is a stubborn boy. It will be very difficult to get what He wants from Potter.”
“I’ll do it then,” said Pansy. “I’m an excellent liar. And Draco… Here.” She gave him the book she’d shown him downstairs. “Good luck.”
“That’s going to be difficult, sir. Potter and I hate each other,” Draco said, “so it’ll be very hard to think of something like that. We both spend a lot of time thinking about each other.”
Draco allowed the fantasy for a few blissful moments before the tension came back with full force. D sharp minor. Draco slammed his hands down, the music swelling in time with the pain in his heart. This was a fantasy for a reason, he could never tell Potter any of that. Potter could never know how Draco felt, or what he’d done, or why.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” Lockhart said, gesturing for the crowd to be silent, “what an extraordinary moment this is! The perfect time for me to make a little announcement I’ve been sitting on for some time!
“Perceptive of you, Potter,” said Malfoy, smiling maliciously. He swung his legs theatrically over the side of his bed. “Maybe you’ll learn something from this whole mess.”
Draco sighed shakily. Perhaps it was no mere eyelash, but a scratch to the cornea. That might better explain why exposing his eye to the air made it worse.
Draco threw the napkin from his lap and tore from the room. He heard his parents tittering behind him, but he didn’t care. He had been begging for snapdragons for ages, and every time he asked he had been told
“I suppose,” he said, somewhat put out. He watched Potter grow smaller and less distinct as he walked away. If that ginger-haired she-devil hadn’t interfered…
“Why don't you try it out? Tell me something,” said Pansy.
“Bye, Harry!”
Draco sniffed loftily. “Malfoys don’t make mistakes. Now focus. Watch what I do.”
The curtains twitched. Draco moved to get a better glimpse, but the man with the drill shifted, as if to block him. Draco’s shock evaporated. “Oi!” he shouted into the noise of the drill. “You TWISTED BASTARD! HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHO’S IN THAT ROOM?”
“I’m offended you’d think otherwise,” said Blaise. “Don’t forget, I was here when you first started changing into Potter.”
Draco snuck one last look at Granger and Weasley, who glanced back at Potter as they talked with their own families. They clearly cared for him a great deal. Were he anyone else, the scene might have made Draco wonder if he was missing out on Potter’s friendship. But he was Draco Malfoy, thus above such ideas. He took his mother’s hand and they left the station.
“Of course it was,” Draco said, “you’ve seen how he’s treated at school. It’s the same everywhere he goes— everywhere but at home.”
“Yeah. It was slow going for a while, but when Malfoy and I brushed arms, everything sped up.”
“It was Potter’s fault,” said Malfoy, and at the same time Harry said, “It was an accident.”
“No?” She looked excited. “Then why are you trying to stop me getting to your desk? Seems my present is in there. If this,” she gestured to his position, “is because you haven’t wrapped it, I don’t mind.”
Then, behind fluttering eyelids, the last few moments of his dream reappeared. Draco blushed even though there was no one to see him. He could still feel Potter’s breath on his lips, as real as anything. Draco touched his mouth, unable to stop the rapt smile that pulled its corners upward.
“Yessir,” he said, sleepily opening his eyes. They widened as he started to slip off one of the fractured strips of flooring. He turned back to Draco, who winced.
a million times. This is nothing.”
Draco gasped. “Your birthday!”
“Your arse isn’t half bad either, Potter.”
Dobby held out quelling hands. “You must exercise greater caution. In order for your plan to continue—”
“Ron! What are you doing?” Mr Weasley said, having fought his own way through the crowd. He was followed closely by the Weasley twins. “It’s mad in here, let’s go outside.”
“Hm?” He opened his eyes against the brightness of the compartment. Pansy was staring at him. “What is it, Pansy?”
“Give me your pyjamas,” said Harry, who was now blushing furiously.
Draco’s head whipped around. His mother had on a vague sort of smirk.
Someone was shaking Draco, muttering something he couldn’t make out for his sleepiness. Slowly, he opened his eyes, and was puzzled to see his mother, framed by darkness, sitting on the edge of his bed.
“Are you both comfortable? At least, for the moment?” she said.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re a real ray of sunshine today, aren’t you?” Malfoy asked.
*******
“Subconscious choices are still choices,” Professor Snape said, sitting his wand on the desk behind himself. “You must remember that when your mind is under attack. What you have already shown me glimpses of, and tried to direct me away from— these are things the Dark Lord would want to investigate, if He had seen them. He would infiltrate even further into your mind, with even more purpose, and find whatever you are trying hardest to conceal from Him.”
“Mm,” Pansy agreed from her massive wing chair. Her cat, Raziel, leapt off the back of it and slunk over toward Draco, looking very much like a black lion. He was large for a cat — around three feet long — and the grey fur on his neck was longer than the rest, giving the impression he had a mane.
them in.
Potter didn’t let go of Draco’s hand until they reached the doors, which Draco didn’t mind at all. He was glad the invisibility cloak hid the expression on his face, because if it hadn’t, Blaise and Pansy
“Bet you loved that, didn’t you, Potter?” said Draco, hoping his affected drawl sounded normal to the pair. He tried not to look hurt when Potter frowned at him. “
Harry did a little mock bow, circling his wrist as he bent forward. He put on a very high voice as he said, “I should hope so,
will be signing copies of his autobiography
Draco started to cross the room under the guise of examining the cluttered shelves and cases. Really, he was hoping to get a peek into that big cabinet in the corner. Because Draco could have sworn that he had seen a Potter-shaped shadow leap into it before the door closed. No doubt it was wishful thinking — what reason would Potter have to be in a place like this? — but if Potter really was here…
“Okay, but Draco, you bullied him nonstop all last year. Do you really think you’re any better? If so, you really do have a warped impression of him, and of what you think he deserves.” She set down her tea. “Why do you care, anyway? I thought you hated him.”
*******
plan would work, he was certain of it.
Before Harry could respond, Madam Pomfrey opened her door. “Oh, good, you’re awake,” she said, bustling over. “How are you feeling?”
“Must it?”
“Books by Mr Lockhart won’t be available until 12:30,” the shopkeeper announced as he stocked the two-to-three-book-deep shelves.
Draco gasped dramatically. “What’s that?”
Potter threw him a look. “Don’t get cheeky.”
There was little progress to be had during that meeting, but that was okay. As Professor Snape said, before Draco left for the night, “There is every hope that using a different sense, like sound, might cause you to notice something you haven’t before. It does not matter that, for me, my signal for invaders is a cold hand on my neck. We will discover what your particular signal is; give it time.”
“No, and I’d argue I don’t ‘deserve’ anything. I won, fair and square. Unless,” Potter said, “there’s something you’d like to tell me?”
Professor Snape put more pressure into the spell, steering back toward the original memory:
Professor Snape squared his shoulders. “Yes, let’s try it. Build an arsenal of mundane memories you can use, and we’ll see if that helps.”
Draco stopped himself there. He wasn’t thick enough to pretend, even within his own mind, that his explanations weren’t thin. Potter couldn’t possibly like attention if he tried so hard to be invisible. Or maybe Draco’s problem was that, in the act of trying to be invisible, Potter stood out. Or more generally, that Potter just stood out to Draco in a different way than he did to most people…
“Well, I could hardly do it myself.” Draco sniffed, then scowled at how pathetic it made him sound. “How d’you suppose that would go? He hates me, thinks I hate him. He wouldn’t take me seriously, he’d go back to spite me… The Dursleys are by no means a fair trade-off, but if it’s to avoid being killed?”
“Absurd,” said Pansy, hiding a giggle behind her hand. “It’s perfect.”
“Yes?” Draco blinked. “Sir.”
Sensing that the rabbit hole was not very far ahead of him, Draco tried to push thoughts of Potter deep, deep down. He had a whole metaphorical tree set aside for Potter, and it was tremendous; it took a great deal more energy to imagine forcing
“Don’t give me that. Look, can’t you make me invisible or something?”
Draco quite agreed. Especially now that it was even clearer he had no hope of talking to Potter whatsoever. Not with so many Weasleys there to block him. But Draco held his ground, waiting for the Weasleys to make the first move toward the door. They should be the ones to leave, no matter how much he wanted to.
“I need you to do something for me, but first, do you know where Harry Potter lives?”
“Didn’t you notice?” said Draco, reclaiming his seat by the window. The train shuddered as it went around a bend. “Potter isn’t here.”
“There’s Quidditch tryouts coming up. You know how obvious it would be if Draco Malfoy suddenly started flying like Harry Potter?”
This lack of control was terrifying. What if he grew flowers that told his parents exactly how he felt about Potter? Or what if Potter saw them? What if there was another tree? Flowers he could hide, but a tree?
“Yes, but how? He didn’t rip the bars away on his own, he must’ve gotten help from someone…” If the Ministry had taken him, they wouldn’t have been so careless with the house and the Statute of Secrecy. So if not them, who could have possibly…? “Oh!”
“There he is, Mum, there he is, look! Harry Potter!”
“I’m sorry, sir,” Draco said, breathing heavily again. He felt very close to tears; he hadn’t had time to get over that last memory. “I thought I’d found a couple good ones then.”
“I never asked him to do that,” Draco said forcefully. “I never wanted anyone to- to die, and certainly not because of me.”
“Why on earth would we have done that?” Malfoy said, narrowing his eyes at her.
“Mhm,” said Potter. “In fact, I—”
As always, I claim no ownership of these characters. If y’all want to translate this, you’re welcome to it! I just ask that you let me know and credit me as the original writer. Fanart is also appreciated if anyone's feeling creative.

“Pansy,” Draco said, snapping in front of her face. “Tell me, please. You know
“Draco,” came his father’s voice, echoing off the buildings. He was standing about halfway to Borgin and Burkes, a pinched expression on his face.
All the things Draco wanted to do — grab Potter’s thin hands, ask if he was okay, take him somewhere for a proper meal, take him home for the rest of the summer — were dismissed the second Draco thought of them. And any concern he might have been able to slip into his tone of voice, or his wording, was out of the question with Ginny there. She glared up at him with eyes full of privilege, like she knew Potter better than Draco ever would.
“It’s your boyfriend,” said Blaise. He smirked when Draco hit him for the comment.
, he found the experience a lot less alien than he’d been expecting. He’d assumed Malfoy slept on sheets so expensive they were uncomfortable, but Harry had been pleasantly surprised to discover Malfoy used the ones Hogwarts provided, too. And in the darkness, it was impossible to tell whether the curtains round Malfoy’s four-poster were red or green, or whether the snores he heard came from Crabbe or Ron.
“I guess,” he said finally, even though he didn’t like this any more now than he had in the past. There was a difference between what Professor Snape had already seen and that which Draco hadn’t allowed him to. A very big, very troubling difference.
“This has gone on for his whole life,” Draco said. “Before he had even a

for them to reach the safety of the Gryffindor common room before talking about it; it would have been nice for one of them to commiserate with him. “What are you insinuating, Ron?”
Draco made to pick it up, but his mother threw out a hand to stop him. “Wait,” she said, “let me check for curses.” She pointed her wand into the box and made a twisting motion with it. Then, looking satisfied, she spoke again: “It seems safe to handle. Go ahead.”
The mattress shook as Potter nodded. “When I touched you, everything else that hadn’t transformed began to. That must mean we’re done, right?”
“Good,” Professor Snape said, and they began practicing once more.
“Pitiful,” one of the twins commented, saying exactly what Draco had been thinking. There were far more reliable tactics for de-gnoming a garden. “I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.”
,” Draco said, spitting the word, “I’m very much on track.”
And if Potter had gotten this letter, would he have used “Love” in his reply?
The instant their lips touched, something incredible started to happen. It was like a breeze blowing over Draco’s body, disturbing not only his hair, but his skin and bones. Draco felt himself begin to grow taller; Potter shrank before him, and Draco tilted his head down to accommodate the change. He found the back of Potter’s neck, putting more pressure into the kiss because he didn’t dare separate now, not when the transformations were happening all at once and without the pain of the first time…no, he needed Potter to be closer, much closer, and Potter must have thought the same thing because he brought a hand up to Draco’s cheek, which was
Draco had heard enough. He didn’t much care for politics, and his mother was in need of a strong cup of tea.
“Merlin, Blaise! No! Why do you want to?”
“No, sir, not really,” Draco said, “but that’ll be important, right?”
The crowd below started whispering and looking around. Their movements created a clear view to Potter; he was near Lockhart’s table. Lockhart leapt forward and seized Potter’s arm, dragging him to the front. He murmured something to Potter and then, shaking his hand, posed for the photographer. So many pictures were taken in succession that Draco had to blink against the spots that appeared behind his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
Slumping to the ground, Draco looked out onto the colourful grounds of Malfoy Manor, feeling more useless than he ever had before. Usually, when he wasn’t sure of what to do, he would follow his father’s advice. He couldn’t do that now.
“My—?” Potter sat up and started rubbing his eyes. Even in the dim light of Blaise’s wand, Draco could see distinct red lines crisscrossing the right side of Potter’s face, left over from where his pillow had creased. It stretched up to his forehead, mimicking Potter’s lightning bolt scar.
The flashes stopped, and Potter clearly thought that would be the end of it, starting back toward the Weasleys, but Lockhart reeled Potter back in, throwing an arm around his shoulders and trapping him in place. Draco angrily gripped the balcony railing.
*******
“Malfoy,” she said, “you’re not going to want to hear this, but—”
From the presentation — hard-boiled eggs, tuna, tomatoes, olives, and baby potatoes, all resting on a bed of lettuce — the dish’s name was clear: salade niçoise, a salad distinctive to the French city of Nice. This particular salad had always been a favourite of Draco’s, as the ingredients were arranged separately rather than mixed together like typical salads. Pretentious, yet artful and delicious.
Lockhart waved jovially, winking at the camera. Draco shook his head. He didn’t believe a word of the stories Lockhart told about himself. The man below him did not seem capable of fending off a gust of air, let alone a pack of hungry griffins, among the other things he claimed to have done. And besides, he wasn’t even very good-looking. Those people were fawning over a mediocre man and substandard wizard. Draco couldn’t believe that imbecile was going to be their Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher come September.
in this body and I would prefer it if you turned around. And if you were modest with my body.”
Draco sank backward into the couch. “He talks about me too?”
Thank you for reading, giving kudos, and leaving comments!! <3
No. That wouldn’t do at all.
Draco could have sworn the snow outside fell a bit heavier then. The room certainly felt cooler against the blush that flared over his cheeks. “I don’t know what you mean.”
“Quiet!” said Malfoy. “Or do you want Pomfrey to see us like this?”
Both boys shook their heads.
Draco felt like all the air had been pushed out of his lungs. “Am I so easy to read?” he squeaked.
Draco was completely flummoxed. How could anyone starve someone who smiled like that?
Weasley child. He wondered how many there were now.
The other boy obliged, nudging Harry’s back with the neatly folded garments. Harry handed his over in a loose ball.
Dobby looked to the floor as if hoping it would inspire the correct phrasing. He fiddled with the sponge. “Dobby had not thought about it, sir.”
Once they had swapped pyjamas, Malfoy gave Harry an appraising look, nodding. “That’s much better. You looked ridiculous before.”
Petunias mean "resentment, anger, your presence soothes me" and we chose black for the Vibes; bulrushes mean docility and indiscretion.
“No,” said Draco, closing his book. “Today you’re going to learn how to do my hair yourself.” He pulled Potter into a standing position and marched him across the room. “I won’t be there to fix it when we leave the hospital wing, and who knows if Pansy would offer to do it for you? She’s the only other person who knows how to do it right; she helped me for weeks after that hippogriff broke my arm.”
My favourite flower language resource: http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31591/31591-h/31591-h.htm. If you’d rather I just told you what to look up, search “The Project Gutenberg eBook, Language of Flowers, by Kate Greenaway PDF” and it should come up. It’s got FANTASTIC illustrations and it’s cross-listed, which— *squeals* we love organisation!! And stay tuned for more Victorian flower language in a different fic I’m working on ;)
Dobby’s only response was a bow before he left.
It took a moment, but Potter was soon right behind Draco again, shouting, “What’s the point? You never pay attention anyway, I doubt your marks could suffer any more if you skipped a lesson.”
“Later,” he repeated to himself, before setting off to find Granger and Weasley.
“Yeah, whatever,” was Potter’s response.
like that? Muggles are foul, stupid creatures, but surely they must have some appreciation for what he did. Why else would the Dursleys have taken him in?”
“All I know,” said Draco slowly, “is that I’d rather
“No, but—”
“No, sir,” said Dobby, and with a loud snap, all traces of flora were gone. The floorboards had righted themselves, too. “Dobby will tell no one, if that is what you wish.”
“Excellent. Listen very carefully. You are to Apparate to his home every day when the post is delivered. Collect anything he might get, whether they’re parcels or letters, and give them to
“See? He’s fine. Now leave,” Pansy ordered. She didn’t face Harry until the door had been closed, and then Harry erupted into laughter.
“Oh, it’s you,” said Weasley, ruining the moment when he appeared suddenly from the throng with Granger, their arms laden with Lockhart’s books. “Bet you’re surprised to see Harry here, eh?”
TLDR: abuse is never okay, in any form. Unfortunately, if we're trying to keep this relatively canon-compliant, Draco needs to have this nonreaction to Dobby's abuse, and even his own part in that. Doesn't mean that he can't change in the future, but this is how I think he'd behave at this time.
“You were one slight away from getting a full bingo card, there. You forgot to mention my family.”
By the time Draco had given his father several old tomes to buy, the shop had filled almost to bursting. He was glad of his position on the balcony above everyone until he realised the exit would soon be completely blocked. Wizards were pushing each other and clamouring to enter the full shop; a harried-looking wizard was trying his best to control them, saying, “Yes, yes, form a queue… Calmly, please, gentlemen… Don’t push there…mind the books, now…”
Draco turned so his back was against the hedge and closed his eyes, listening. Despite it all, Potter actually seemed to be having a good time. This was far from ideal, but maybe it was for the best…
It was early enough in the morning that it was unlikely for anyone to be awake, but still they were careful. The air felt thick as Draco and Pansy pushed their way upstairs and then into the dark, but empty, corridor leading to the boys’ dormitories. Their luck expired soon enough, though: when Pansy swung open the door to Draco’s dorm, there was a wand light coming from deep within the room, tinged green by the curtains drawn around the person’s bed. At the sound of the door creaking open, the curtains were thrust aside, revealing a worried, then nonplussed, Blaise.
Draco pulled the chain on the bedside lamp and blinked, both in the bright light and at the blurry sight of Potter squinting dramatically. No—
“Good,” said Professor Snape. “During our session today, pay attention to signals that someone else is there with you. These signals may present themselves in any number of ways. In my case, I most often feel what is akin to a cold hand on the back of my neck. Sometimes it is a more subtle feeling, and other times it feels like frostbite setting in. Have you noticed anything like that?”
Narcissa Malfoy is a woman who’s accustomed to her every word being obeyed at once and without question.
Harry glanced over to the table where his friends waited, watching Harry tensely. Ron’s fist made a lump in his pocket where Harry knew he kept his wand. Harry gave him a look that he hoped conveyed,
His arse is right in front of Harry’s face, and Harry bites him on one perfect, pale cheek, hard enough to make Draco yelp. “I’m not going to eat your arse in a coat closet.”
Instead, Ron stood up with a groan. “I’m going to go upstairs and rest,” he said. “We can talk about this later when you’re feeling ready to be reasonable about it. But we’re just going round in circles here and… I can’t again, not right now.”
Harry gathered up the ingredients he’d need to make a raspberry swirl cheesecake, and collected the mixing bowl and measuring spoons from where they’d been drying by the sink. Then he got to work, burning off some of his restlessness by using a rolling pin to whack a pile of graham crackers into fine crumbs.
Harry shuddered despite himself and took a deep breath. He was here, he was safe, and it was all over.
And then he turns and goes into the kitchen. Draco can hear him clattering about with the kettle. And he’s tired, he’s so tired and he doesn’t want to argue. Truthfully, bundling himself up in the afghan on the sofa sounds rather nice, a small and tempting comfort. So Draco does as Potter says.
Harry looked puzzled. “What?”
“Any plans for today?” Potter asks, reaching up into the cupboard for a couple of bowls, which he takes over to the cutting board where Draco’s left him a knife and several pieces of fruit.
Harper’s groan this time was distinctly grateful. “Give it here,” he said, reaching out.
Draco scooted over to give him more space. His stomach gave another grumble, and he folded his arms tightly over his middle.
“Really?” Weasley said, surprised. “It’s not even midnight.”
“There isn’t a lot I can help you with off the books,” Potter says, scratching down a few notes. “There’s quite a bit that I’d have to go through official channels for in order to be of any assistance. But why don’t you give me some more details and we’ll work out how best to handle it from there, yeah? So. How do you know you’ve been cursed?”
The protective cocoon of spellwork Potter had cast over Draco back at his house that evening has faded, and Potter recasts. His magic is a comforting sort of warmth as it curls around Draco, like sinking into a warm bath after spending too long outside in the cold. His fingertips and toes prickle pleasantly, and he shivers.
“And, you know, I rather enjoy being able to see properly.”
Teddy ignores it entirely and flings his arms around Draco.
Someone’s leaning over Malfoy, giving him mouth to mouth and chest compressions to keep oxygen in his bloodstream between shocks. “Clear!” the doctor yells again.
“I don’t,” Draco said.
He waits on the stoop while Potter grabs his jacket and follows him outside and locks up after them. The cab hasn’t arrived yet.
“I’m not sure I’d go that far,” Draco said, reaching over. He plucked the mostly-empty glass from Harry’s hand and pushed his own full glass across the table, and Harry smiled at him. Draco propped his elbow on the table and leaned in, all suave confidence as he went on, “But I’d be more than happy to help continue your education. Say, on Thursday, eight o’clock, at Le Coq Bleu? I can make us reservations.”
“I noticed you didn’t have one so I took the worst one for myself. Molly knit it for me but Rose picked out the colours. Surely this one’s not so bad.”
“Hm,” Robards said, shuffling through the stack of parchment that Harry had brought, then slapped it face-down on the desk in front of him. “Why don’t you save me some time and tell me if there’s any new information in here worth reporting.”
“We’re expendable,” Harry agrees, and Malfoy’s eyes narrow, “but you can’t just kill the overnight janitorial crew and the intern reading
“What?” Draco blinks.
“Yet you think they’ll believe we’re dating?”
“But Malfoy’s involved in all this, and I know you. I know what sorts of unnecessary risks you’ll take just to get at him. You’ve never thought straight where he’s involved—”
“You’re trying to keep me distracted,” he said.
“Two more paragraphs in this section, then Section Nine is all about inappropriate workplace conduct. There’s six paragraphs on kissing alone.” Draco winked at him, then looked down at the book. “Paragraph Thirty-three…”
He closed his eyes and put his hand on Draco’s, listening to the sound of their breath slowing back to normal. Downstairs, the furnace kicked on, humming faintly through the quiet house.
Another soft bang told him that Hermione had gone again, and then Ron was crowding him out of the doorway and down the stairs to the kitchen.
Potter scrubs a hand through his unruly black curls. “Yeah.”
He really,
Harry spins away from the cooker and stalks from the kitchen. “Really,” he tosses over his shoulder as he passes through the door. He can feel Malfoy’s eyes on his back the whole goddamned way.
Potter’s hand pokes out from around the doorway and he makes a rude gesture at Draco.
“Did Harry trip over the mat again?” Ron calls from the kitchen.
They leave the room, Potter easing the door shut behind them so it doesn’t slam.
He’s been putting off hiring an assistant for a while now, reluctant to let someone else come into what he thinks of as
Draco looked pained, then turned to the waiter and rattled off something that sounded like French to Harry. “For our second date,” he said after the waiter vanished, “I’m going to arrange for us to attend a wine tasting.”
His heart is pounding, his nightshirt cold and damp with sweat. He exhales slowly, breathes in, breathes out, and tries to calm his nerves. It was just a dream, and not even a very bad one on the scale of it. He’s certainly had worse.
The second time it happened, Harry didn’t take the bait. Draco never left himself open like that. It must be a trap. It had to be a trap.
It droops, wilting, and something drops back into the beaker. A single drop of blood, bright red against the glass bottom. Another, and another, and a small burst of triumph detonating deep in his chest in her chest in his—
That fondness lasted all of five seconds, until Malfoy shifted around again so he could tuck his cold feet under Harry’s calf. Harry sucked in a hissing breath and went rigid, gritting his teeth through the shock of it. Groping under his pillow, he curled his fingers around his wand and aimed a Warming Charm downward to counteract Malfoy’s toes. Malfoy turned his head to press a kiss against Harry’s shoulder as warmth bloomed around them.
As he’s waiting for it to boil, he stretches his arms up again, then bends over from the waist. His back still hurts. If anything, the ache has grown worse. For a moment, Draco worries that he’d botched that pain potion and worries about whether he ought to go pull the rest of the vials from that batch from the shelves. But his arm feels fine, not even a hint of pain there anymore. He twists an arm up behind himself and presses where it aches most, and feels hard knots of muscle.
Draco looks down at his wrist where it’d slipped his mind entirely that he’d put the charmed bracelet. It’s gone, but the skin around his wrist is blistered. Exactly as it was when the cuff he’d charmed with Diagnostic Spells went bad.
Harry sighed. Apparently everyone had a death wish today.
Draco sounded so resentful that Harry couldn’t help but laugh, and then laugh harder when Draco’s scowl darkened.
“I’ll just be a minute,” Draco said, tucking his things under his arm and going back out into the hall.
Draco would certainly
“Shut up,” he whispers back, and pinches Draco’s bum.
When the witch running the class finished talking about the last wine, she invited everyone to stay and mingle and enjoy the rest of the bottles left over from the tasting. The trio of witches who’d shared their table wandered off to speak more in depth with the instructor about grape-growing regions in Germany, and Harry and Draco were soon left alone. Harry cleaned out his glass with a quick spell and snagged a nearly-empty bottle of the wine he’d liked best with a lazy
Harry grinned and adjusted himself. “Wanna find out? Put down your wand and maybe I’ll let you hold mine.” Harry heard Draco’s snort from across the room, and okay, yeah, maybe that one was pretty horrible. He stood up, then immediately dropped back down as a Blasting Curse blew up the pillow with a loud
“Anytime. And speaking of Harry…” says Katie slyly, and Draco’s absolutely certain he’s not going to like whatever she says next. “He’s much more handsome in person than the pictures in the paper.”
They’d gone after a late night at the Ministry, that very first time, and Draco had very nearly turned around and walked right back out. It’d been within the first year he and Harry had been partnered, and Draco’s previous partner had been a pureblood. So while he’d decided by that time that Muggles were all right
“Nowhere we’re gonna be for very long,” Potter tells him, heading across the garden.
Oh fuck, oh fuck, she was dead. Fuck,
“It’s rude to start a conversation and then trail off in the middle of it,” Draco said.
“Don’t you dare,” Harry said, grabbing his arm and pulling it away. “You’re going to fuck me now.”
Before he could finish his sentence, Hermione picked up her glass and downed the rest of her vodka tonic in one smooth gulp.
Unless… Oh, god. Is Malfoy a ghost? But if he was, he ought to be stuck in the mansion. There’s no way he could be haunting Harry specifically. Can a ghost haunt a person? What if Malfoy’s unfinished business is Harry? Did Harry let him die? Was it all Harry’s fault?
“Oh, no. I mean, I can,” she says, still a bit off-balance. Clearly she wasn’t expecting him to hire her outright, which is fair enough since Draco wasn’t expecting to do it, either. She sucks in a breath and sticks out her hand. “I’ll be here. Thank you very much, Mr Malfoy.”
Harry’s mind blanked out at that point, everything else falling away until his world narrowed down to the feel of Draco’s hand on his cock and Draco’s cock sliding against his arse. He gasped, crying out as Draco suddenly took over, thrusting against him faster and faster until his hips stuttered and he said, just once, “
Harry slid inside him slowly, carefully, with some part buried deep in the back of his brain balking at the idea of pushing into Draco after only putting a single finger in him, even though the rest of Harry knew perfectly well that Draco had taken care of himself earlier, and had felt for himself how relaxed Draco was, how wet he’d made himself.
“Oh,” said Harry. “That’s, erm. Thanks. Thank you.”
“That night we watched Campbell & Collins. That last person who left, the wind caught their cloak,” Draco says. “They were wearing yellow robes.”
Granger eyes him speculatively. “Have you figured out a way to make him stop?”
It was Friday night after a very long and trying week, and Harry was enormously exhausted and a little drunk. “I guess I’m not,” he admitted before he could think better of it.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Yeah, sure. That’s it exactly.”
“Room 327,” Celestine said without looking up from her filing as he approached her desk.
,” he whispers desperately, and yanks Draco backwards through the door that pops into existence on the wall behind him. “
“—and why in the bloody hell are you—”
“The way you’re shoving at the back of your hair.”
“Ugh,” he says, and turns his hair sickly green. “You’re awful and I can’t believe we’re related.” He watches Potter suspiciously, like he’s expecting to be grabbed again and forced to bear the ignominy of a second kiss. “When’s dinner? I’m starving.”
“Ow!” Ron yelped, shaking out his stinging fingers
His anger carried him through polishing the rest of the silver, and Harry snapped the box shut and set it aside. The door to the back room was still firmly shut, and of course Harry couldn’t hear anything from the other side thanks to Malfoy’s charm. A glance at one of the many antique clocks that were displayed around the shop showed that they’d only been in there for about ten minutes, and Harry assumed they’d be in there a while longer. Malfoy had always liked the sound of his own voice, after all.
“Waiting for what?”
“Really,” Harry said, smiling. “All the flirting didn’t give it away?”
They sit in silence for a minute or two.
“Because I’ve got an exam tomorrow on the departmental codes of conduct, and it’s
“And you’re a
“We’ve been waiting for an hour,” Ron complained, waving his wand to release the charms keeping breakfast hot and fresh.
“And then I’d be forced to arrest you,” Draco points out. “I’m an Auror, you are aware.”
Draco lets himself be pushed along, through the living room, past the long dining room table set for nearly a dozen, and into the kitchen where the chaos is more controlled: pots bubbling and steaming, a knife chopping vegetables, a stiff brush scouring a pan in the sink, a stack of potatoes peeling themselves on the counter, and the middle of it all, Molly Weasley with her wand in hand, orchestrating it all every bit as skillfully as a conductor leading a symphony.
“There’s no reason why we shouldn’t,” Harry said. He felt as though he were floating. “Is there?”
Harry Potter spent the morning of his 18th birthday lying on his back in bed and staring listlessly up at the ceiling.
Harry saved Mrs Calloway from getting an eyeful of Draco’s lily-white arse by mere seconds. She came bustling back out onto her balcony, broom in hand, and began sweeping. On the street below them, someone called out, someone else answered, and a wireless switched on to the evening news. They were practically surrounded by people, all going about their evening routines just like everything was perfectly normal.
“Come on back,” he calls out to her, then, when she steps into his potions lab, he adds, “Good morning.”
“I know,” Harry says. These words are harder to say. “They’ll just send someone else,” he adds again, because saying it feels like it offsets the horror of what he’s about to do a little bit. Not even close to enough. “You won’t even feel it. Close your eyes, I’ll make it easy for you.”
Weasley just gives him a nod. “Of course. I assume Robards briefed you on what you’ll be doing here?”
,” he tells himself again. Start at the beginning. What had be been doing before this happened?
“But no one’s willing to say that to the Chosen One’s face,” Weasley adds.
or whatever it is you think will happen if you so much as touch me.”
give it a chance.”
It’s always disorienting as fuck to step into something that’s bigger on the inside, even worse when he’s not expecting it. On the outside, it’s just a shed, maybe a little larger than he might expect a shed to be, but still common as newts’ eyes. But on the inside it’s one of the nicest garages Draco’s had the pleasure to step foot in.
“If you were a customer, you’d have sent in your order by owl,” he points out. “Or purchased them from Zelda, who is perfectly capable of doing so, you know. After all, it’s what she’s here for.”
They don’t pass anyone except a pair of hags whispering together in a dim doorway. Iron Alley is broader and the streetlamps shine a little brighter, and Draco leads Potter around the corner and up to a narrow building where he raps briskly on the door with the tarnished brass knocker.
Draco shrugs and doesn’t meet his eye. Instead, he takes out the feather and hands it over to Katie. “Someone is casting curses that force people to grow wings with each full moon. This is from one of the victims. I’ve tested others to the best of my ability, but…”
“Yeah, okay,” Potter says. “You’re funny, I’ll give you that.” A pause. “Sometimes it’s even on purpose.”
Malfoy was already in bed when Harry stepped back into the bedroom, curled up on the right side and facing the wall, leaving the left side of the bed empty for Harry. He stared at Malfoy—the shape his his shoulder made under the covers and the way his hair looked almost gold against the crisp white of the pillowcase—and forced down a fresh wave of panic. He’d been nervous enough about this when the bed was empty; facing the bed with Malfoy in it, with the corner of the sheets on Harry’s side turned invitingly down, ready and waiting for him to get in, well. Harry wasn’t at all prepared for this.
Draco banged the drawer shut. “Is there an echo in here?”
“Fine,” Draco says, even though he’s tempted to argue that he’s perfectly well enough for them to take Potter’s motorcycle. And he certainly doesn’t need to be escorted to his shop because he’s not
“Thank Merlin,” Malfoy breathed before he kissed him again. “I thought you didn't want...”
what Seamus assumed would happen next, especially not after all the terrible comments he’d just finished making about poor saucy Doris.
“I’m afraid so,” Draco says. They’d gone out with Pansy earlier in the week and Potter had fed Draco a rather large number of martinis just to get the little plastic swords that came skewered through the olives. Draco had ended up far drunker than he’d intended to, but didn’t mind so much because then they’d gone home and Potter had thanked his ‘commitment to the cause’ with a truly glorious amount of sloppy drunken sex.
The other exciting news was the Healers at St Mungo’s contacting Harry to let him know the timeline for the antidote. Unfortunately, they’d run into a bit of a problem, in that after further analysis, the formula Harry had been dosed with didn’t match up with the recipe they’d recovered. The good news was they’d figured it out. In addition to trace amounts of the other potions that had spattered into it, it turned out that it had also been contaminated by an as-yet-unidentified form of growth magic. They were still working on figuring out the details before they proceeded with the antidote.
“Right, right,” Draco said. “I suppose I got a bit carried away with it. Still, there must be
The stairs creaked but Harry couldn’t quite bring himself to stop kissing Draco. The footsteps paused in the doorway, and then Harry heard a distinctly Hermione-ish huff from behind him.
Draco is edging dangerously close to empathy now. He frowns again and does his best to put Potter from his mind.
Indeed, the day is clear and bright, the sky a perfect blue stretched above, and Draco takes a deep breath of fresh air as he walks down the pavement. He’ll Apparate from the gazebo again, the thinks. That will be the easiest way for him to get to Diagon.
as Lucius took ages to interrogate Tielman’s uncle regarding every last detail of his purchase. “Yes, I remember. My father was an occasional patron of your uncle’s shop.” He racks his brain for details, comes up with a few more. “He was well-known for the quality of his Hands of Glory, if I’m not mistaken.”
“So, do you have a preference about which one of these we’re using?” Malfoy asks, and Harry lifts his head and looks over to see him holding up a few of the condoms.
“I’m not,” Harry said. “It’s just that. Well. We’ve never spent the night together before.”
“Oh,” said Harry, freezing halfway back across the kitchen with his handful of eggs and cream cheese, and the canister of sugar tucked precariously under his elbow. “Oh no.”
He’s moved on to contemplating his basket of dragon’s claws—the last batch he got in looks especially nice, perhaps he could make some sort of display with them—when there’s a light tap on the door.
“Isn’t that a bit paranoid?” Malfoy asks when Harry sets the third ward.
“Buttered parsnips!” he announces, throwing his handful into the fireplace.
Because they don’t. It doesn’t matter, and Draco doesn’t care. All that matters is they accept the ruse of him dating Potter. Which they have. And if they never like him? Well, what does he care? As soon as he and Potter work out how to break this curse, Draco will never have to set foot in this house again.
“It’s fine,” Draco says. “My injuries have mostly healed and the wine won’t have any adverse interactions with any of the potions I’ve taken.” Potter still looks dubious, and Draco huffs. “I’m an apothecarist, you do realise. It’s my job to know this sort of thing.”
“Sir. Sir, if you’ll— Sir,” Emma, the witch who worked the reception desk at the front of the Auror Office, was saying, trying futilely to cram a word in edgewise to the tirade that the wizard in front of her desk was currently off on at full volume.
“Huh,” Harry said. “I’m not sure how I got the wrong impression, then. I think it might’ve been something about us living together, or the three long and happy years I’ve been your boyfriend, or all the sex—”
“Well,” Ron said, and seemed to be working up to something. “It’s just that you never seem to be alone with him.”
Harry flashed him a little smile, and how strange that Draco smirking and making smart comments at his expense had become a comforting routine. “Shut up,” he said, and all right, that wasn’t the best come-back Harry had ever made.
And then after this was all over and his life was his own again, he needed to go out and go home with someone he’d never see again and get himself spectacularly fucked. Because if all Harper had to do was lick his lips and Draco was
He’s heard the stories. So Draco’s prepared for some amount of chaos. However, he’s not prepared for Potter to grab onto the bristles of his broomstick not five seconds into the match and then go into a steep dive, jerking Draco down with him.
Draco smiled and patted his cheek, and Harry rolled his eyes at how obviously pleased Draco was to have won the disagreement, even though Harry had very obviously let him win and that
At nine, Draco flips the sign to
“I’ll look forward to it,” Harper said, then sighed and gave Draco’s fingers another squeeze before letting go. “I guess I should let you go, now.”
Draco hesitates, unsure whether he’s supposed to laugh.
And indeed they don’t. They go just across the street to Gringotts where Lucius is waiting before the counter of a Goblin teller.
“Probably,” Potter admits, jamming his hands into his pockets.
“We are not getting anyone else involved,” Draco interrupts. He stares at Potter for a moment, and then turns away because this conversation is over. He feels a touch to his back and it’s hard to tell because of the Numbing Charms, but he thinks it’s over his wounds. “What are you—” he starts, turning back, and then catches sight of Potter’s hand.
Without further spells, he couldn’t tell what exactly the curse did, just that it was very old and very, very powerful. But he closed his eyes and reached out with his senses anyhow. As expected, didn’t get anything more than that. He was just debating whether it’d be worth the risk to get out his own wand and cast a few detection spells to get more information about the curse when a sudden touch on his shoulder startled him. Harry fumbled the little silver spoon he held, and Desmond’s hand shot out Seeker-quick and plucked it out of the air.
“Wait, wait,” Weasley says, pushing Potter off him as Potter makes exaggerated kissy noises at him. “Can we trade? You can have Harry and I’ll take Draco.”
This morning’s paper had run a front-page spread of photographs of the two of them tucked away at a tiny table in the corner, accompanied by an elaborate story all about how they were engaged in a salacious affair and poor Ron Weasley had no idea. The tone of it was snidely smug, as if the writer were letting the reader in on a very juicy secret, and it was that blatant disrespect to Ron that had pushed Harry over the edge. How thick did they think Ron was that he’d somehow miss a whole article published on the front page of the bloody paper?
“Toujours saoûls,” Potter adds with a grin. “Always sozzled. Because that’s what happens when we play.”
“Mr Stuart, this is Auror Potter. Would you please tell him what you told me?” Draco snapped his fingers and a Quick-Quotes Quill leapt from his desk drawer and began to copy down everything.
“Fuck off,” he interrupts, dipping her wand into the cauldron and stirring in slow clockwise rotations. “I’m counting.”
At least he gave Harry an opening to press Desmond for more information.
He can’t hold it in any longer. “Couldn’t you have found something better than this?” Draco bursts out. Money’s not exactly a concern for either of them, he honestly doesn’t understand why Potter couldn’t have driven to a nicer hotel. Or—and Draco never thought he’d say this—
“And I’d like this one as well,” she says.
Draco sits stiffly, spine perfectly straight, hands folded neatly in his lap.
Draco’s stomach gave a sharp jolt at that. But his cover was solid, his flat deliberately set up so that anyone who came inside it wouldn’t see anything that he didn’t want them to see. Was that what Harper was asking for? Draco had never in his life been so tempted to say yes, but alarm bells were ringing in the back of his mind what a tremendously stupid idea that would be to go through with.
the shit out of it, and then washes it again with soap and sets it aside, grumbling all the while.
Draco would have let it go at that. He would have clamped down on the sharp yearning that lances through him at finally, finally touching him again. He would have done his best to put it from his mind and kept his hands to himself from now on, if it weren’t for the way Potter kept sneaking looks at him.
“God, no,” Harry said. “It wouldn’t be worth the teasing I’d have to put up with.
Draco indulges in a quiet sigh but doesn’t say anything because where he’s staying probably involves a bed, and he’s more than ready to be unconscious for a while. He feels like a clock that’s wound down, all the coiled-up tension of earlier gone. He hauls the straps of his bags over his shoulder and trudges after Potter.
Right. Focus. Harry made himself frown. “The fact that you could very well afford it would only have added to the thrill, would it not?”
Malfoy scowls at him but doesn’t say anything. Probably because he knows Harry’s right and would rather die than admit it. That’s fine. Harry knows that Malfoy knows that Harry’s right, and that’s enough for him. Harry gives him a smile, and Malfoy scowls harder.
“The Ministry was eager for me to begin setting up my subdepartment,” Draco says, and pulls a face. “Beaurocracy. It takes them forever to get anything sorted, and then once they do, they want it all done
“You’re not fine,” Harry said, turning to glare across the kitchen, because he
“I can keep quiet,” Draco says insistently.
Clearly, Draco needed to figure out a way to get him alone and out of the shop, but he wasn’t sure how to do that without offering more than he was willing to give. Could a date just be a date, or would Harper expect more than Draco was willing to give? Merlin, he wished he weren’t quite so out of his depth here.
They eat in silence, and after they finish, Potter calls for a cab on one of the curious little rectangles that Muggles use to speak to each other, and then insists on doing the washing up by himself. Draco lingers at the table, browsing through a potions supply catalogue while Potter cleans up. When he finishes placing the last plate back into its cupboard, Draco gives his wand an idle flick, and there’s the gentle rattle of porcelain as everything resettles itself neatly.
He tries his best to sound casual and uninterested, but Potter sees right through him. One corner of his mouth ticks up into that endearingly crooked smile. “Ever.” He reaches for the hand that Draco’s still got draped over his knee, laces their fingers together and gives them a squeeze. “But I think being around you would be difficult even if we hadn’t had sex.”
Harry snickered. “Yeah, yeah.”
He’s been digging into the mystery of Potter’s disappearance for so long, first alone and then with Megan and then alone again, that it had taken on something of a fantastical air to it. Like an old familiar daydream suddenly turned reality, and Draco doesn’t quite know what to do with it.
The bacon in the pan ended up burning, but Draco’s wand was in his back pocket with Harry’s hand, so he used it to Vanish the mess and the smoke and turn off the flame. He tucked the wand back into Draco’s pocket, followed it up with his hand so he could give Draco’s arse a squeeze, and then devoted his full attention to thoroughly reacquainting himself with Draco’s mouth.
“My father wasn’t perfect,” Harry says as they cross the lawn, then heaves a gusty sigh and shoves a hand through his hair, briefly exposing that famous scar before his tangled fringe flops back into place. “Look, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said that. Your father and I are never going to like each other, but this is going to be hard enough without me throwing my opinions of him in your face.”
“Malfoy?” he calls, looking wildly around. He scrambles to his feet, heart racing faster than it had when he hit the ground. Malfoy had said that they were tied together, so where the fuck has he gone?
“Because he’s a giant wanker?” Ron asked, a little hesitant, a little hopeful, like he was afraid of the answer he might get but still couldn’t stop himself from asking.
“You’re easy, more like,” Draco said.
Instead, he’d got to enjoy it for all of five minutes—just long enough for him to know exactly what he’d be missing out on—before Robards’ head had popped through the flames in his fireplace and informed him that a case had come in that needed his urgent attention.
“It’s worth a try, I suppose,” Draco says slowly. He spreads his arms a little. “Well, go on, then.”
“Erm, sorry, yes?”
“Yeah,” Weasley says, patting the bag he’s got slung over one shoulder. “You ready?”
For a moment Draco stands in the middle of his living room, helpless.
“Greyback was a monster,” Potter says. He seems to draw in on himself. “I’m not—”
“Good,” Harry said. He fiddled with the Chocolate Frog wrapper in his hands, then tossed it onto the table with the others. He picked up Draco’s wand and Vanished the lot of them. “It’s about time she got in on an interrogation. This case is going to be open-and-shut, so I was going to offer to let her step in for me, so I guess it worked out all right.”
approach to it.”
“My pronunciation is not fussy,” Draco sniffed. “It’s correct.” He slid a look at Harry as he took a sip from his glass. “I do speak French, you know.”
“That’s an interesting bit of magic,” he says. He Conjures a bookmark and slips it between the pages of the book before sliding it onto the coffee table.
Harry snorted, and Draco gave his bottom a light smack.
s the paperbound journal Potter had been making notes about mythology in as well as the pen he’d been using to do so.
And Draco can’t help but laugh. “Of course it’s fucking cold, it’s the middle of November!”
He opens the door and and finds Weasley sitting at one of the room’s two desks, an array of folders spread out over the top. He’s scribbling something into a small notebook. Draco steps inside and shuts the door behind him, has a look around while he waits for Weasley to acknowledge his presence. Weasley keeps his office neat enough. A little cluttered, but not unbearably so. Lots of pictures on his side of the room, mostly of Granger and small ginger children Draco assumes are his, but also of his parents and many siblings. He spots a few of Potter mixed in there, too. One in particular catches his eye, of Potter in that black leather jacket and boots, straddling a gleaming black motorcycle and grinning at the camera. Draco hastily looks away.
he looked. It made his heart squeeze tight. “What?”
There’s a loud crash and people shouting, and Draco’s magic crackles beneath his skin, rasping like sandpaper, sparking like flint. It lashes out and a window shatters, lashes out again and a chair overturns, and a small, distant part of him knows that he’s safe, knows that he’s in St Mungo’s, knows that he needs to
, if it could keep you complacent, it could have fed off for days.”
“You don’t know
“The merlot, if you don’t mind,” Draco says before Potter can ask. That will go nicely with the veal chops and mushrooms he’d made for dinner.
But he knew his luck, and had been disappointed but not the least bit surprised when he’d walked in just as Hyacinth left on her afternoon break. Which left Patrick watching the front desk.
“My magic?” Potter echoes.
Draco is well aware. He kept it deliberately, and sort of wonders what Potter would say if he knew that Draco smells it sometimes. He feels a bit creepy when he does it, but Potter smells really good and Draco’s already admitted to himself that he’s rather hopeless where Potter’s concerned. “I know exactly where it is. Remind me later.”
“There’s more to life than just the shop, Draco.” She sighs again. “I had tea with Mrs Parkinson recently and she mentioned that you haven’t seen Pansy in a while.”
Draco wakes up naked and cold and alone.
“You were annoying!”
“Potter,” Malfoy said sharply.
“Still,” Harry said, sliding into bed in a soft rustle of sheets. “Thanks.”
“Of course, thanks for having us,” Harry says.
Breathing a little hard as he straightened his robes, Draco paused and looked around. The kitchen was cramped, and mostly bare. There were a handful of dirty dishes stacked beside the sink, with far more forks than their meagre number ought to warrant. But that mystery was solved when Draco opened up the ice box and found several boxes of takeaway. A pair of bowls painted with cartoonish fish skeletons sat on the floor, one filled with water, the other with a few crumbs in the bottom, and Draco figured that most likely explained why Harper had the window left open.
He had both hands tucked into the front pocket of his hoodie and the loose garment made him look smaller, younger, and somehow more vulnerable here in the dim light of Diagon than he’d appeared in the bright lights of the Auror office. It made Draco think of long evenings working late, with Harry curled up on the end of Draco’s sofa, as comfortable and casual as if he belonged there. Draco’s imagination swapped out Harry’s trousers for a comfortable pair of plaid pajama bottoms, replaced this dimly-lit street for Draco’s dimly-lit bedroom, and Draco wanted so badly to touch, to be allowed to touch—
“Sorry,” he said, replacing it on the display rack. “Didn’t mean to frighten you.”
Fine lot of good it did; Malfoy gave Harry a single disdainful glance and then very pointedly snapped a strong Silencing Spell around the back room before shutting himself and Desmond inside.
Harry shrugged. “Aside from that,” he allowed, twirling Draco’s wand around his fingers, and Draco was hit with a strange gutpunch of memory, of the end of the war, the Battle of Hogwarts, seeing his own wand in Harry’s hand and how he wielded it as easily as he did his own. How Draco’s wand had clearly taken to his magic like a duck to water, casting for Harry without the slightest hesitation, without the even the smallest stutter showing in his spellwork.
Draco stood and smoothed the wrinkles from his robes with a quick flick of his wand. “Wonderful. Thank you,” he said, and mentally added
Sighing, she hands over the jar. Draco takes it, and if his fingers tremble as he measures out a spoonful, she’s kind enough to refrain from commenting. He stirs it in and watches as his potion lightens from a deep beige to a delicate eggshell white. Perfect.
“Fine,” Harry said, and was pleased by how totally and completely normal his voice sounded. “I’m fine.”
,” he ground himself into Harry’s front, “that I excite you. So the question becomes…” He trailed his hands up Harry’s neck and tangled them in the thick curls. His mouth curled into a smile and he gently grazed Harry’s lips with his own. “Are you coming back next Friday?”
Harry felt his anger rise anew. “You know nothing of the situation.” He struggled to keep his magic in check. “You know vague facts and you’re putting together a puzzle that you don’t even have all the pieces for.”
The first time Luna brought Ginny to his flat for their Sunday baking day, he thought the floor would open and swallow him whole. He stood in his kitchen, the oven beeping at him incessantly, as he stuttered out a hello, his face red as the strawberry jam he had simmering on the stove. Luna may have forgiven him, but he wasn’t so sure about any of the other witches and wizards he used to know. Ginny had surprised him, though - she gave him a tentative smile and held out her hand to shake, and when he took it, her face showed nothing unpleasant - no repulsion, no disdain, just curiosity and something Draco couldn’t quite put his finger on at the time. She had sat at the kitchen island with Luna, chatting animatedly about her summer training with the Holyhead Harpies, while Draco canned the jam and made more and more scones. The girls tried one from every batch he made, and praised him and his skills at baking. He had felt something that day he hadn’t felt in a long time - pride.
With his last mouthful gone, he cast a Tempus charm and saw that an hour had passed, and Draco was still nowhere to be seen. He set his plate in the sink and rested his hands on the cool stainless steel, preparing himself for what he was about to do. Draco had told him very little about Blaise, only that they were friends and sometimes had dinner together. In the month that they were dating before Draco got cursed, he had seen Blaise once for a formal dinner that Draco had returned home early from, slamming around the kitchen and refusing to talk to Harry about why he was upset.
That was the last time I talked to Ron, and the day I quit being an Auror.
Red string of fate, perhaps?
“I don’t see why not,” he said thoughtfully, “I could do a split-Sunday, you could come in the afternoon after the others have left?”
I raised my eyebrows and made eye contact as I used the toilet. Asserting my dominance? I don’t know. His cheeks flushed but he didn’t look away.
“Some of these grounds are really stuck on,” he remarked, rubbing at the metal. “But I’m almost done. Do you have to do anything to the machine before we put the drawer back?”
Hermione coughed, and Harry could tell that she was uncomfortable. “Yes, well, that was about conception, not about curses.”
“Three times, and you know the recipe by heart?” Harry seemed impressed. “I bet you’re amazing to watch when you’re making the scones for the cafe.” The oven went off again, and Draco slipped the crust out again and poured the treacle mixture into the pan, smoothing it down with a rubber spatula to get to all the edges. Tapping it on the counter a few times, he put it back into the over and set the timer again before turning to the dishes that had accumulated.
It was barely a question, but it held so much emotion. I knew he knew about the other murders; The Prophet had already begun referring to me as The Veiled Vigilante. He was smart; top of our year behind Hermione. He had obviously put it together. The edges of my vision were going black, and the hand I was using to put pressure on my wound dropped. I was fading fast, but I had to say it - he had to know.
Draco stalked forward, and crowded Harry back against the counter. “Let you go?” He teased, running his nose up Harry’s jaw and ghosting a kiss on his lips. “Never.”
“I am simply saying that it is no one’s business but their own, Ronald!”
“But it’s so early,” a grumpy Harry complained the next morning as Draco unlocked the front door of the cafe. “Why couldn’t you have Luna come in?”
Draco’s nerves were alive with focused energy. While this whole situation started as a joke, he couldn’t hide his feelings anymore. He
The look on Hermione’s face was doubtful, but thankfully, she dropped the questioning. “Can we expect you tonight? Neville and Luna said they’d be there too.”
“And I’m sure it will,” Harry banished his own mug back to the kitchens and pushed his chair away from the table. “Now that we’ve gossiped about my amnesiac boyfriend, I need to grab his discharge papers.” He was feeling irritated and didn’t quite know why. He knew that Ron and Hermione were being realistic, and hadn’t told him anything he didn’t already know, but still...
The door clicks shut, and then he hears Potter on the other side of it, gathering up his things. Draco waits until he hears Potter’s footsteps retreating down the hall before he sighs, and stands up, and turns on the water. It rushes over his feet and ankles, stingingly cold, and Draco waits for it to warm.
“Are you feeling all right, Draco?” Narcissa asks as they stroll leisurely around the gardens.
Potter shakes his head. “Ron’s an Auror, too. He knows what cases I’m working, and if I make up a fake case he’ll be even more suspicious.”
,” said Malfoy, and this time his voice was no longer swaddled in the sort-of Lincolnshire accent he’d affected as Desmond.
It didn’t take much longer for Draco to reach his climax. His breathing hitched and he pressed closer to Harry, and then he was coming, hips jerking, cock throbbing as he spilled slick and warm over Harry’s fist.
him. Ultimately he was only here as bait, and to handle any Time-Turners that might find their way into his shop, should the ruse prove successful.
“Harr—” Malfoy begins, reaching for him.
Harry laughed and shoved lightly at him. “Yeah, okay. Clearly that’s what it is.”
He props the journal on his knees, flips past the pages filled with Potter’s scrawling handwriting, clicks the pen, and begins to work through some arithmancy for a couple of new formulas he’s been developing, and it’s a wonderful distraction. Draco’s always liked working with numbers. They’re predictable. Constant. Following the same steps will always yield the same results, and applying principles of Arithmancy to other subjects feels like bringing a little more order to a small bit of the world.
It takes entirely too long to get back home for Draco’s liking, and walking into the entryway feels like a weight lifting off his shoulders. Potter drops his bag with a loud
“Your sock has a hole in it,” Draco says, following Potter down.
feeling like he could
all that?”
While he’d never showed any sort of exceptional talent for Herbology, Draco has always enjoyed it. There’s something satisfying about watching a plant grow, because it’s so simple. Press a seed into the soil, give it a little water, a little sunshine, and a little time, and it becomes something else. There’s a kind of magic in that, he thinks, in that slow transformation. There’s something beautiful in how mundane it is.
Well. Harry had been worried about coming home to dried-out chicken and Draco in a snit, so he supposed he should be grateful today was one of the days Draco got caught up in brewing and lost track of time.
He crawled up onto the bed, pushing his way between Harry’s legs so he was settled between them, his own thighs holding Harry’s spread wide, and then leaned in because Draco was quickly learning that he couldn’t resist kissing Harry when he smiled like that. He kept it slow and sweet, just the warm pressure of his lips against Harry’s, and then slipped his hand down and wrapped it tightly around Harry’s cock.
And then it’s too late to take it back. He holds his breath and watches Potters eyes move back and forth over the lines of text.
“No,” Lucius says, glancing down at the book in Draco’s hand. “Is this for your experiments?”
Harry resisted the urge to throw the compact right at Malfoy’s head. Instead, he snapped it shut and dropped it in the evidence box. He very deliberately ignored Malfoy and reached down into the trunk for a length of braided silk cord that he saw sticking out of the rest of the junk, preparing to pull it loose, and didn’t realize that Malfoy had grabbed the other end of it until a sudden crackle of magic flared to life between them, and the cords glowed gold and wrapped themselves around Harry’s and Malfoy’s wrists.
He runs his hands up the warm, smooth expanse of Harry’s back, down over his sides, the fingers of his left hand bumping over the scarred ridges running over Potter’s ribs. Potter pushes up against him, rising to his knees, and Draco takes him by the hips and quickens his thrusts. Potter keeps his face pressed into the pillow, and the idea that he can’t see a thing, that all around him is darkness and the sound of Draco’s words and the feel of Draco behind him and inside him, it’s intensely arousing.
“And I suppose the geese weren’t your fault either,” Pansy says archly.
“Harry,” Ron called for the second time, and this time he leaned around the doorway of Harry’s cubicle so that Harry wasn’t able to keep ignoring him.
“How about ‘fuck you’?” Draco shoots back. Then he turns in a swish of dark robes and strides across the street.
Tonight’s dream had been almost tame in comparison. He’d been walking through the Forbidden Forest and had somehow got turned around. In the dream he hadn’t crossed paths with a helpful pair of Death Eaters to follow back to Voldemort. Everything had been quiet and peaceful and dark, and Harry had just kept wandering and wandering.
—and smells tobacco, they’re dancing together at the Ministry Christmas party, and Malfoy pulls Harry in closer, curls one hand around the back of Harry’s head to press Harry’s face into his shoulder.
Some browsed without buying anything, some tried to haggle for lower prices, some were clearly hunting for anything Dark Arts-related, and one had attempted to shoplift a pair of antique silver candlesticks and was very much made to regret his poor decision. Hexing that arsehole out of his shop had been the high point of Draco’s day.
“Hello, Snow,” says V. The voice is the same as always.
“Yeah, no, this is sort of important,” Potter says, removing his hand altogether which is the exact opposite of what Draco wants him to do. “How did you not know France hasn’t got a queen?”
“Erm, do you think you could…?” he asked, gesturing at his neck. He could feel himself blushing again.
“Right, if that’s what you’re calling it,” Weasley sighs. “I’ll make this fast so you can get back to…” He flaps one hand. “Whatever.  I don’t want to know. Look, you know how Pierson went into Campbell & Collins last night?”
Draco pinches him. Potter kicks his ankle.
Potter’s collected all their things and is waiting for him at the base of the driveway. Draco grudgingly gets out and lets him take the wheel. They get on the motorway and head for London. The current plan is to ditch the car somewhere in the city before Draco’s
“Please,” Draco says and takes a seat at the kitchen table. He can feel Potter’s eyes on him as he fiddles with his cuff. He wonders what Potter’s thinking.
“Because we are in public,” Harry said. “And anyone could see us!”
Draco looks up from his cauldron and frowns at her, frowns pointedly at the clock, and then frowns at Zelda again. “You have ten minutes until your lunch.”
Malfoy hesitated, and for a moment Harry thought he wasn’t going to turn. That the lift would arrive and Malfoy would step inside and Harry would be left here, standing in the corridor like a fool.
“I know,” Ron says, and his arm around Harry’s shoulders squeezes in an almost-hug for a moment, and Harry almost relaxes, but how can he when he can’t even trust his own mind?
The size and shape of the wounds is disturbingly familiar. There’s a puncture wound on the man’s chest, and another in his stomach, and one more in his thigh. There are two more wounds, deep slashes to his other thigh and his upper arm. Glancing blows, Draco realises with a start. That’s what those cuts he wakes up with are. Someone’s been shooting at him this whole time.
“Yeah, well,” Potter grumbles, and Draco raises his eyebrows, waiting to see what Potter can possibly say to that. “You’re not allowed to complain about it when I’m using it to haul your arse to work.”
the ledger copies. The one he was currently digging through had been written by someone with appallingly messy handwriting, and their 9s and 4s looked almost identical, which made checking their arithmetic far more of a challenge than it really should have been.
He takes the mug and curls his hands around the warm ceramic, and feels something coiled tight inside him loosen incrementally before he realises, a second later, that he never saw Ron make the tea.
“Not really my type, to be honest,” Harry said. His fingers slipped beneath the restraints crisscrossing Draco’s thighs. “You on the other hand…”
They stare at each other, wands in hand. Potter has shifted his feet into a duelling stance. And abruptly, Draco is so, so tired of all of this.
She seems more than a little harried, and Draco can’t blame her with the massive dinner she’s preparing. He leaves the bottle where he’s told and escapes into the living room, lets Granger lead him over to an unoccupied sofa and sits down with her. There’s a stack of books on the coffee table. Draco scans the titles.
“Wonderful. I have a potion to brew that needs to be sent out this afternoon. I’ll be just in the back if you have any questions.” He doubts that will be the case. This Tuesday’s been slower than most, and Zelda’s done exceedingly well for her first day. She’ll be fine. She looks a little uncertain, so he tells her exactly that, “You’ll be fine. And if you need me, all you’ve got to do is shout. But I doubt you’ll face anything worse than Dorothea.”
“Wings,” Potter repeats, then sceptically adds, “On a full moon.”
After dozens of attempts, he finally manages to produce a feeble Warming Charm, and Draco nearly sobs with relief as it seeps into his skin in a wave of pins-and-needles prickling. It’s not enough to chase away the chill entirely, but Draco hopes it’ll at least be enough to keep him from developing hypothermia.
“And if he can’t?” Harry asked. The Malfoys had lost quite a bit of their standing post-War, so Harry didn’t think it likely. Malfoy was probably lucky he’d even been allowed into the Auror program to begin with.
Draco’s stomach turns over and he yanks his hand away, blood gleaming wet and red from fingertips to wrist. He leaps from the sofa and tears his shirt off, and takes a deep breath and it takes him several long heart-pounding moments before he can force himself to put his hand back there again. Because, Merlin, that’s impossible, surely he’d imagined it. But no, he feels it again, the gaping wound, the blood, and
“No, I’ve got hobbies outside of work. Oh, thank you,” Potter says, pausing as a house-elf clears his empty plate and replaces it with a cup of beet bisque. “Mostly I’ve been occupied with fixing up my house. I bought an older place in pretty rough shape and have been working to restore it. But I suppose I’ll have to find something else to do rather soon.” He takes up his spoon and rests it idly on the rim of his soup bowl.
Inwardly he winces. She sounds hesitant in a way that she hasn’t since her first month at the shop. Back when they’d been strangers to each other. He takes a deep breath.
“Food’s here!” Ron said cheerfully, then stuck his head into the hallway and bellowed up the stairs, “OI! FOOD’S HERE!”
“Hey,” Potter says, hooking a finger through the handle of his mug and tugging it across the counter to sit beside him. “Hufflepuffs are hardworking and loyal and some of the very best people there are.”
Draco stares at him for a long moment. Then he reaches out an arm, shuffles Potter gently to the side, and lifts the tent flap to look inside himself.
“Sorry, am I interrupting something? I guess I’m a bit early,” Potter says, coming over to him. “What’re you doing?”
“Ron,” Harry says. A cold wash of fear sweeps through him. “What happened to Malfoy? Is he all right?”
“Next time,” Draco said, feeling giddy with the thought that there very well would be a next time. “Next time, I’m going to suck your cock.”
he would have. They probably would have had sex again. Harry usually wakes up horny, and Malfoy hasn’t turned him down yet.
and then he rocks his hips, grinding down against Draco’s thigh and he’s just as hard.
He unbuttons his robes and slips them from his shoulders. He deliberately selected a set of robes with long slits up the side from hem to hips, a style which requires a set of close-fitting trousers worn beneath, which he very much intends to keep on. He folds up the robes and sets them aside, then starts on his shirt. Draco’s fingers shake as he slips the buttons from their buttonholes one by one. He shrugs his shoulders, letting the shirt slide down his arms, right cuff catching on the Portkey tied around his wrist, then begins to fold it up.
“My apologies,” he says briskly, reaching to shake Robards’ hand. “I was unavoidably detained trying to straighten out an issue with my Floo. It won’t happen again, sir.”
“Michael doesn’t deserve our Harry,” Hermione said right away. “And Seamus is no longer allowed to pick Harry’s dates.”
Malfoy slants his eyes at him, lips wrapped indecently around the spoon. He pulls it out and then stands to retrieve his things and drop the spoon in the sink. When Malfoy returns to his bed, he upends the entire shoebox on it, papers, files, photographs, evidence bags, all tumbling to the duvet.
,” Malfoy added.
“I’m just saying,” Ron said, popping another chocolate into his mouth. “You’ve got a good thing going if he’s bringing you chocolate. Hermione never buys me chocolate.”
“I’m aware, thanks,” Draco mumbled, heading straight for the kettle.
“I’m not leaving my shop,” Draco snaps.
A few moments slip by in silence. Then Potter takes a deep breath.
be a next time. Harry anticipated needing a great deal of help studying for his next exam, and he didn’t think it’d be all that difficult to talk Draco into it.
And this is when Malfoy stops and sits down next to his pile of things. He stares at Harry with these weird eyes, like they’re making connections even now, and those connections have to do with Harry. He shifts uncomfortably on the bed, and frowns at Malfoy. “Like what?”
Hands are shaken all around, and then the players begin to Disapparate. Draco’s looking forward to a hot shower and a hot cup of tea, and he’s trudging across the pitch to retrieve his broom when Potter catches up with him.
There’s a feather-light brush against Harry’s mind, but Malfoy doesn’t push in right away. Instead, he maps out the shape of Harry’s mental protections, familiarising himself with the shape of Harry’s mind, the formation of the defences Harry’s built up. Harry rather enjoys this part of it; the brush of Malfoy’s consciousness against the edges of his own is smooth and gentle, and makes a pleasant sort of tingling break out down the back of Harry’s skull to the nape of his neck. It’s nice.
“Our parents would be horrified,” he says.
It doesn’t take long to fall into a new pattern. And though Draco still longs to have his version of Potter back, this one isn’t so bad now that they’re getting used to each other. It’s still tremendously frustrating, though. It feels a bit like reaching the exciting part of a story and then having to start back at the beginning. Now that he knows where it leads, he’s eager to pick up where he left off.
on the Weasley household. Draco very nearly dives straight back out the door. The only thing that stops him is he’s got no idea how to operate the motorcycle so he can’t make a full escape.
“Sold,” says Potter, looking more cheerful than he has all evening.
Harry’s mind comes to a rushed stop. He looks at the Muggle monitors, watches Malfoy’s heart beating almost imperceptibly, but it’s still there, somehow. He’s going to live.
“Forget it,” Draco grumbles, turning for the door. “What time are we meant to be meeting your friends?”
“Me, Pans, Ron, maybe Hermione if Molly can watch the kids tonight. Probably Luna. Ginny and Dean for sure, and Neville might, if he can get away from work. I think Blaise is out of the country again. He travels a lot.”
Between one blink and the next, they’re standing in the kitchen. Ron’s at the cooker, poking a spatula at a cast iron pan full of sizzling potatoes.
One week passes, and then another. Potter throws himself into his investigation with renewed dedication. He’s doing everything in his power to keep his promise that they’ll figure it out in time. He brings home more and more work, large stacks of files that he spends long hours poring over each evening. Draco has to chase him up to his bed nearly every night.
had been worth seeing a Healer about. Here, a Healer won’t be able to do anything for Draco that he can’t do himself. “If you want to make yourself useful, go get me a jar of Coagulating Paste from the front. And a pain potion, please.”
“A compliment like that, I can see where you’d need to clarify,” Draco grumbles, but inwardly he’s pleased. Apparently all it takes to win Weasley over is illicit baked goods. Not that they’re anything like friends, but in the middle of poking a bit of fun at Draco, Weasley appears to have forgotten to watch him like he expects the next word out of Draco’s mouth to be
“Yes,
fuck,” Draco said as Harry’s finger rubbed over his prostate. His head dropped down, exposing the vulnerable stretch of his neck, and Harry leaned down to press a kiss to the bump of the lowest vertebrae there, right at the top of his shoulders. “Fuck, that’s good.”
Harry looks back at the remainder of the cake on the table as Molly sinks the big knife in to cut another slice. The fluffy lemon frosting dimples around the knife as it slices through, in that way that promises the cake beneath it will be melt-in-your-mouth tender.
“And that’s all?” Harry prompted when Malfoy didn’t seem inclined to continue. “How much time do we have to spend together?”
She takes up her own handful, then gestures to him. “After you.”
“Yeah, well, enjoy it while you can,” Draco says. “I’ll run out of tricks sooner or later, I’m sure. Magically, I’m nowhere near as powerful as you are.” He’s pleased to note that only the slightest trace of bitterness colours his voice. He’s supposed to be cheering Potter up.
And of course, he went straight for the spoon. He took his time, and a somewhat roundabout way to get to it, but Draco knew exactly what was in his shop, and kept a closer eye on the four cursed objects than anything else—especially the three that weren’t locked up securely in the case. The ring was the most dangerous, enchanted with a variant of the Jilted Lover Curse, but the spoon was a close second in sheer malevolence. Somewhere over the decades, some witch or wizard with a nasty sense of humour had enchanted it with a powerful Immolation Curse that would only respond to Muggles. It’d taken the IUMC Curse-Breakers several weeks to disarm it, leaving the curse intact but twisting a few subtle strands of spellwork so that in the unlikely event the spoon made its way out of the shop and into the hands of a Muggle, the curse would harmlessly self-destruct the moment it tried to activate.
“But we have classes together, and—”
There was really only one way to fix this.
“‘Course,” Weasley responded, spearing the veal with his fork. Draco was disappointed to see it go.
Professor Snape inhaled sharply. “Everything,” he said.
“Stop that,” Draco said, feigning annoyance. “What were you thinking out there? You realise there could have been subtler ways to get my attention?”
make out,” said Potter, blushing again. It was a lot more adorable on him in that body.
Flinging the door open, Draco began his search of the greenhouse. It was the one place on the grounds allowed to be disorganised. The rooms of the manor were kept distinctly dust free, the blankets neatly folded, the floors swept and waxed. Even outside, the gardens surrounding the house were expertly maintained— not a stem or flower petal out of place. Here though, plants erupted from every possible roost— some dangled from the ceiling, some sat idly on the sills and tabletops, and others clung to the walls, raced along the floor, or spilled out through the tall, gridded windows.
“About a month.”
“I think so,” Potter said.
Draco skimmed the paragraph, then coloured. “No. No, Potter would never agree to that.”
“What- what threads do you want to pull, sir?” Draco said quietly.
“Make sure to grab it before we leave. You and I will be stopping by Borgin and Burkes today. I have some items I should like to be rid of,” said Mr Malfoy with a pointed look toward the drawing room, “and we have not given Borgin our business in several months.”
He sticks the bagel back into his mouth and reaches for the window, and that’s when Lucy launches herself off the windowsill and nearly knocks him over as she flies in. Draco stumbles back and accidentally bites all the way through his bagel.
And three strokes later he comes so hard he honestly can’t remember the particulars of it after it’s over. Just being overwhelmed by a sweet piercing rush so intense his skin’s still tingling from it. It’s probably the most intense orgasm he’s had in recent memory, can’t really say for sure because his brain doesn’t feel like it’s working properly after that. He’s breathing hard and faintly dizzy. His knees have gone wobbly. Potter pulls out, and Draco turns to blink at him.
because if Malfoy was adding rules to their arrangement then he felt he ought to add something too. Then they shook on it to seal the deal.
They were nearly halfway through this trunk, and that hadn’t taken long at all. There were two more trunks so they could be done in about another hour. Then all they had to do was take the boxes and empty trunks down to Evidence, submit their inventory lists to the Patrolmen who were investigating where these magical items had come from, and then they’d be done. Harry could put up with Malfoy for that much longer. They’d be finished before he knew it.
“Full moon,” Potter manages, his breath coming in soft gasps. “Always gets me like this for a few days, leading up to it. Might as well take advantage, I’m going to feel like shit tomorrow.”
“Oh? Why not?”
; for all that his studies were involuntary, they were certainly effective. Gaining the ability to keep his Aunt Bellatrix out of his head worked extremely well so far as motivation went. She had a habit of waiting until he was distracted—the dinner table was a favourite of hers, because then there was an audience—and then slipping into his mind and casually announcing whatever of his thoughts she’d gleaned.
“Fuck you, Malfoy,” he grunts. “This was my favourite black t-shirt.”
“Oh,” Harry said, frowning. Because he’d half-expected to be kicked out as soon as Malfoy had had his fill of him. But this sounded an awful lot like Malfoy had just invited him to spend the night. And he didn’t know what to make of that.
“However?” Harry echoed.
Harry gave Ron a small smile and shrugged. “Well. I’m trying.”
knew. Unicorns were a Class Four Protected Species, and for the hairs to be this pure gold, they must have been harvested from a foal. One not more than a couple of weeks old, young enough that it hadn’t yet begun to lighten to the silvery-white colour it’d become as an adult. Unicorn hairs were incredibly valuable both as potion ingredients and as wand cores, but they were also incredibly rare as the beasts they were attached to were notoriously difficult to catch—as well as extremely illegal to interfere with. Someone like Hagrid would harvest hairs that’d been shed naturally, snagged on shrubbery or caught on a low-hanging tree branch. But if MacCrae had enough of a supply to come here proposing to do business with Draco, he was going to guess that MacCrae hadn’t merely been stamping about the Forbidden Forest, plucking them from foliage.
He’d caught glimpses of them when they’d showered and changed clothes in the locker room at the Ministry after Physical Training Days, of course—the delicate garlands of flowers that swept in gentle curves beneath Harry’s collarbones were particularly difficult to miss, as colorful as they were, although he’d never been close enough before now to see that they were twined not around branches, as he’d assumed, but a pair of antlers—and even as curious as he was, Draco forced himself to avert his eyes from the rest. It seemed rude to stare at them like this, when Harry hadn’t chosen to reveal them to him. The
He’d assumed he’d pushed his magic to its limits with three imprecise Apparitions over long distances. But if that’s not what’s left him feeling so weakened, he has no idea why he’s feeling like this. He stands up, washes his hands, and leaves the loo.
“Oh,” Harry sighed, clumsily petting Draco’s hair. “That was really good.”
Potter sets it in front of him on the table, and Draco picks it up and says, “Hm,” small and pleased as he takes a sip. And it’s not until after he swallows that he realises that Potter never asked him how he took his tea.
Harry pulled Desmond in closer, sweeping his hands over the long line of Desmond’s back, and gasped when Desmond grabbed at his arse to pull their hips together. This wasn’t the first time he’d snogged someone while Polyjuiced into a different body, but there was always something a little strange about it; the unfamiliarity of doing something so intimate in someone else’s form didn’t quite let him lose himself in this the way he wanted to, and gave him just enough space to think.
They appeared in his bedroom, and it only took him a few seconds to wave his wand and clear away everything that might give away his identity. There wasn’t much, only a handful of photographs, an old Slytherin jumper that he still sometimes wore around his flat, and a heavy leather journal embossed with his initials. He did a last visual sweep, but Draco kept things neat; anything else incriminating was put away, and as Harper had been the one to suggest the delay in revealing their identities to each other, Draco didn’t think he’d go snooping.
, because god knows Harry doesn’t have one of his own. There’d been Ginny, and then they broke up and that was pretty much that until that one beautiful, drunken night that he and Malfoy had first tumbled into bed together. Harry had been too afraid to hook up with anyone magical lest it end up in the papers the next morning, and the idea of having to lie about that much of himself to a Muggle hadn’t appealed at all. But Malfoy evidently hadn’t had that same issue, and in Harry’s fantasy it’d be something of a thrill to hear all about it, because Harry would know that those days are firmly behind Malfoy and Harry’s the one who gets every day from here on out.
