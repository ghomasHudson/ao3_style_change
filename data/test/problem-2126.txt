“Dammit,” He continued, suddenly remembering the daze he was in this morning. “What happened in class? I remember getting pretty much yelled at by McGonagall, but not much else.”
need to be working on maintaining control of your Allure. You must have noticed the boys going crazy over you today.”
“Well, it’s been pretty eventful, sir.” Harry’s friend looked at him pointedly, and the boy understood he was supposed to take off his outer robe. He did so, and watched as the headmaster’s bushy eyebrows rose marginally in surprise.
“It is like this for many beautiful women. But for you, it will be worse. Because you are veela.” With a light squeeze, she told him he’d done a good job controlling his Allure for the duration of lunch.
Halfway to the Weasley’s tent, Harry had forgotten his arm was still linked with Draco’s. They’d had to keep up appearances for his father, and had just never let go of each other. It was comfortable, and could he be blamed for wanting to pretend to be on what could be called his first date? The newly blonde boy was shocked out of his thoughts at the sound himself giggling. Did he just giggle? Was he legitimately enjoying time with his biggest rival?
Before they could continue their inquisition, Mr. Weasley’s voice called out from the closed tent flap. “Harry! Girls! You alright in there? We’re going to go explore the campgrounds for awhile. If you leave, make sure to be back by 6!”
“Sir, are you thinking Harry somehow messed up the process?” Hermione piped up, interested in the goings on.
On Saturday evening, Harry was packed and ready to head to the park a few blocks away, Hedwig was winging her way toward the Burrow, and uncle Vernon was standing in front of his nephew, looking down on him with what was a comparatively softer expression than his normal glare.
The healer looked at him with an eyebrow raised. “Yes, but you are the first wizard… ever… I think, to have a humanoid form, let alone of the opposite gender. Which process did you use?”
"It seats a hundred thousand," Mr. Weasley said conspiratorially, leaning in to Harry’s ear so the boy could actually hear him. Spotting the awestruck look on Harry's face Arther continued. "A very large ministry task force has been working on it all year. There are Muggle Repelling Charms all over, along with wide-scale disillusionment and silencing wards.” The Weasley patriarch continued on for a while about the security measures while leading the way toward the nearest entrance, which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizards.
It was at this point Harry opened the door to the Burrow, and was immediately swept into a gentle whirlwind of activity that (regardless of its lack of force) left the only black haired resident of the house dizzy and very suddenly sitting in a chair at the dinner table next to Ron and Hermione. To Harry’s mortification and all his friends’ amusement, he was also sat across from the ginger man that must be Bill.
Thusly interrupted, the topic was dropped. The three teenagers unloaded their bags, and already putting the conversation out of their minds, went to enjoy the festival.
When the two arrived in the Great Hall, only a few people had already made it down to the tables. Those here were likely the ones who had free periods before lunch. They made their way to the Gryffindor table and sat down next to Fleur, who had apparently been waiting for them.
Harry’s face fell introspectively. He’d very much enjoyed Malfoy’s company, and would remember this night for a long time, but it was time to face the music. That music being the absolutely terrible inquisition that was likely facing him in the girl’s tent tonight.
he thought. Harry trudged quietly down the stairs, then into the living room, dreading the coming conversation.
After she followed him back in, Hermione engulfed Harry into a hug, then pulled back to look at his state. The first thing she noticed when looking at his face was that he looked completely exhausted. Then she took stock of his facial features. Blinking a couple times, she tilted her head then raked her eyes over the rest of Harry’s form. She pursed her lips and sighed, tousling her already bushy hair into absolute madness.
Harry smiled widely. Ron’s writing style was very distinctive and entertaining to read.. He wasn’t all that angry at his friend spilling the beans about his sexuality, he was actually grateful he wouldn't have to bunk somewhere near Ron, having had more than enough of that during the school year. It would certainly be awkward sleeping in the same tent as Hermione and Ginny, though.
“So, we must help you control your Allure by tomorrow morning.” The born veela said, as if lecturing. “The control does not take much effort, though it may take a few tries. It will be a task of concentration to reign it in, and you will never completely succeed, but it should keep you from having to fend off boys all the time.”
Harry signed off on the letter and blew it dry as he made his way back through and out of the common room.
With an approving nod, the overweight man nodded toward the door, grunting out “Don’t want to be late now.”
On the other hand, Winky had a lot to say about Dobby, and how he seemed to be a disgraceful anomaly among house-elves.
Arthur piped up to answer her question. “National teams always bring creatures from their native lands. You know, to put on a bit of a show. It’s usually quite the spectacle.”
The Dursleys, however, had various and in one case extreme reactions. Dudley squeaked and ran out of the room. Petunia’s lips almost seemed to quirk up into a smile at the look on her husband’s face. And Vernon. Vernon seemed entirely too intrigued for Harry’s liking.
“Well, first,” Harry started, a small grin on his face. “I think it’s still ‘Mr’. Not like having tits makes me an actual girl.”
“Ugh, Ginny. Why can’t you ever actually be dressed when I come in?” Harry complained, dropping on to her bed next to Hermione and helping his best friend with her hair.
The resident medi-witch shook her head, knowing he was lying, but he didn’t seem to be exhibiting any terrible side effects of the transformation, so it wasn’t her business. He knew what he was getting himself into, he just needed to be given the paperwork to register. “I would go speak to the headmaster about this, Potter. But first,” Madam Pomfrey twirled her wand, conjuring something Harry wished he would never have to see in the context of him having to wear it.
Stately and impeccably dressed in muted colors, platinum blonde hair (not unlike Harry’s own new coloring) in perfect order, Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy swept into the top box like they owned it (which, if Harry had heard correctly at Hogwarts, they probably could if they wanted to). They quickly inserted themselves into the conversation between ministers, and ignored the rest of the group of people. Unfortunately, this course of action only served to reveal the third and final member of their family; nearly white hair, silver eyes, and smug grin on prominent display; the bane of Harry’s existence.
“You go wash up, young man.” she ordered, brandishing her spoon. “I’ll not have you at my table with grass stained hands and sweat dripping down your face.”
Never one to turn down a challenge, especially from Malfoy, Harry blushed deeply and  threaded his arm with the other boy’s and let the Slytherin lead him to two empty seats, leaving behind a confused and slightly mortified Hermione trying desperately not to laugh.
The next few minutes were a whirl of green and literal gold as the Irish national team’s mascots (leprechauns), mischievously made their way through the stadium making extravagant formations and raining coins down on the spectators. Harry made to cover his head with his jersey, but Malfoy covered them both with his cloak instead. When the effeminate boy turned to Draco to find out why, the boy in question motioned lightly with his head toward his father, who indeed seemed to still be watching them with interest.
“Y’know, Harrykins,” one of them piped up, “Our older brother Bill is in residence this month. Your friend Hermione seems smitten.”
Then, with short updates from the two on how the two girls’ day had gone, Harry got changed into his Bulgaria jersey and the trio went to go find the rest of Ginny’s family.
When Harry reached the park, lugging his trunk behind him, the Weasley boys were already there. Ron, the twins, and Arthur had all showed up.
“Oh look Harry!” the boy heard Hermione exclaim from his other side. “The program says ‘A display from the team mascots will precede the match’. I wonder what they’re going to do?”
The blonde boy-turned-girl sighed and relayed the whole story, including his time in Fleur’s tent last night. The headmaster knew about Sirius and Moony, and it shouldn’t hurt him to know about the altered animagus process.
Hermione punched him on the arm and berated him about his language, but the medi-witch had a wry grin and was shaking her head. “Indeed not, Mr. Potter. I must say though, you’re taking this remarkably well.”
Harry thought that was pretty cool. He was interested to see what kind of creatures the teams had brought. The raven haired boy was suddenly knocked from his reverie when he heard a commotion from the entrance to the viewing area. His next few minutes were taken up with minister for magic Cornelius Fudge treating Harry like his own beloved child while introducing the boy to the Bulgarian minister.
Harry let out a whoop of joy, while Albus smiled gently at him. Hermione was happy as a clam as well. “Well, Harry. It seems that is that done and sor-”
The remaining two weeks actually kind of concerned Harry, because he’d reached a point where his hair was almost completely blonde, and Hermione was starting to ask questions.
“Now boys,” Arthur looked at the twins with a sharp expression. “Make sure to keep a tight grip on that trunk.”
The next morning, everyone woke up late and took what money Mr. Weasley had portioned out for them to get breakfast at a food stand. As an aside, wizarding food stands were very cool. Most had samples of their menu items floating around under stasis charms so you could get an idea of the options available. Harry had a fry-up for his morning meal because he knew he was unlike to have a proper lunch.
As he sucked on the chocolate, the boy looked at the book again. Apparently the next step was to make sure to sleep no more than 4 hours each night for the next month. Wondering at this, Harry flipped backward to the section detailing the instructions.
Putting the letter aside, Harry picked up the book and sat down on his bed absently. Hedwig took insult to this, having almost been squished, and flew over to her perch. She tucked her head under her wing, and unceremoniously fell asleep.
Today, Harry was sitting on his bed doing some Transfiguration homework when the love of his life, the beautiful and regal Hedwig, unexpectedly swept into his room through his window, startling him so badly he fell off his bed.
As the two teens made their way back to the Gryffindor tower, Harry decided there was no time like the present to work on staying in his ‘Harry’ form. He’d decided to name his veela form Lauren, in homage to Draco’s made up name for him at the World Cup. The boy switched back to ‘Harry’, and found -to his surprise- that the feeling of his transformation had changed. It went from feeling like he was trying to pull apart an impossibly thick spring, to feeling like he was pulling against one of those really, really thick rubber bands. The ones used for bungee jumping. So, hard, but still doable.
“Some… some of them are going to have to stay at St. Mungo’s.” Ron continues, eventually. “And there are some we still have to sort out bond wise.”
Narcissa, as an omega, was allowed to stay in her home and with Lucius, as she had been his mate a long time prior to his conviction and there was no evidence to suggest that she needed to be removed for her safety, but as an omega she was no more able to take custody of her son then her son was to take custody of himself.
He set the letter on his bedside table and got up, stretching his aching muscles. Partying all night and sleeping all day really wasn’t having the greatest effect on his body. He was really bored, and tired of thinking endlessly about how odd the situation between him and the man next door was, so he decided to go pay Draco a visit.
There was some Firewhisky with the main course – that had been spelled so it could only be touched by people of age – and Harry was already feeling a bit buzzed, and apparently so did Hermione considering her red cheeks and the fact that she was overly touchy with Ron. It was sweet.
“I don’t know if you’re aware, Potter, but there’s this thing called a grocery store. That’s where most people buy their food.”
“Please, Hermione… Don’t. I can’t go back for now. I can’t. I’m sorry. I miss you too, but I can’t.”
“Stop calling me that, arsehole! And no, I’m not defending him. I don’t want to talk about him. He was a hypocrite and a liar.” Harry asked the bartender for another shot as he said that.
Harry nodded, agreeing, and turned his eyes back towards Draco. The blonde man had taken a seat with his Slytherin friends and they were all talking in hushed voices, ignoring the glares and glances some people were sending his way.
Harry smiled at her as she let go of him and invited her inside his room. It was big, bigger than the Gryffindor common room and his old dorm combined. It felt too big for him, but he guessed the Saviour-Of-The-Entire-World would have to get used to it. Even though he really didn’t want to. He hated seeing the looks of admiration he was getting all the time by Ministry employees and volunteers at Hogwarts, he hated the attention, and he hated being treated like some incredible being. He didn’t deserve it. He felt like an impostor.
Draco was so lost in his thoughts he didn't notice Harry coming towards him, and bumped so hard into him he almost fell down. He blushed and looked up at him.
“WHAT?” Draco practically screamed, stopping suddenly. “Are you fucking kidding me? We could’ve had the goddamn Chosen One in our house if it wasn’t for all of the prejudice your Gryffindor friends had against us? No. I refuse to believe it.”
Draco had tried. He had tried very very hard, not to hope. But so many of the others had come back to the room they had them waiting in crying about how such and such relative was out there, in the room where they were holding the trials, waiting for them.
As a heads up I may not post any new chapters for the next two weeks. I meant to warn last chapter but I forgot, sorry. I'm getting married and while I should have internet access, and I might update, it's definitely not going to be a priority for me. I'll be back to my regular schedule in June though so, hope to see you all then.
“Well Ron, you can talk about the available omegas with the alphas in the program can’t you? Harry hasn’t officially been approved yet but we all know he will be its just a matter of having to fill out a bit of parchment really. He far exceeds the program’s minimum requirements for housing, finances, and good standing. So maybe you could just tell him?” Hermione says, she frames it like this is all to make things go smoother and easier for the two of them, but they can both see her barely contained curiosity.
This is the end of the fic, I hope you enjoyed it. If you're interested in more please feel free to let me know in comments or on twitter. I'm not sure when I'll feel up for it but I wouldn't be opposed to adding more scenes if theres anything you wanted to see, and I'm also always open to new fic ideas.
Thanks for reading, I hope you liked it. As a reminder I'm not going to be posting next week (aug 2nd) but should resume the following week.
Weasley stops abruptly in front of a door and takes a step closer to Draco. It is only a great deal of practice that keeps Draco from flinching when the alpha reaches towards him.
It’s Weasley. He’s an auror now, which is weird to try and wrap his head around, and he had been there during the raid. Draco’s mind briefly remembers the shameful state he’d been found in, before skittering away from the painful thought. Weasley is standing in the doorway, and looking to Malfoy expectantly.
“You know I’m not supposed to name names in cases like these even with you guys but mate you can’t just agree to that sort of thing without even knowing who we’re talking about.” Ron says.
Omegas being bought and sold isn’t technically illegal, so long as it is under the pretense of bonding and dowries paid to the omega’s families. After all, an omega belongs to the head of their family until such a time as they are bonded, then they belong to the person they are bonded to.
They’re both so busy with their respective jobs, so there’s always something that’s not quite working right even in their small starter home, and Harry had found, after throwing himself into renovating Grimmauld Place after the war, that this sort of work relaxes him.
Ron arrives late, still in his auror robes and looking taxed. Harry is hosting this week, and when Ron arrives he is finishing up dinner and Hermione is reviewing some case files of hers.
“If he doesn’t get any decent offers, I’ll take him.” Harry says. He hasn’t even consciously had the thought before it's already out of his mouth.
So I vaguely recall something about how when something comes in contact with fiendfyre it is immediately consumed by it but I dont remember if that was a canon thing or just something I read in a fic but for the sake of this fic that isn't the case.
“He’s… he’s in bad shape. Tons of marks. The healers were shocked he was still alive.” Ron says, adding as an afterthought “Must have been there for years.”
So i know that generally the black family tree shows birth and death dates but for the sake of this au and to further angst it doesnt, just to clarify how Draco didn't know his parents were alive till Harry said he'd been writing to them.
Which is just ridiculous really, because even if Malfoy had been found and even if he had presented as an omega and even if he wasn’t already bonded to someone, and that was an awful lot of if’s, it will have at least made the papers before the party. Probably.
On the one hand, he’s happy that she at least seems to be okay with his decision, on the other... their discussions on what Malfoy may or may not have been through do nothing to settle his fraying nerves.
When Harry finally gets news that Malfoy has been found it comes not from the Daily Prophet, or the Quibbler, or even from any of the high society gossips Harry is forced to socialize with at the presentation parties, but instead, surprisingly, from Ron.
I have a lot of settings changed for when I view AO3 to make it more comfortable for me when im reading fic, but because of that I have actually no idea how things look when those settings aren't changed. xD so if anything looks odd or is difficult to read please let me know.
At some point, it seems the trials are over, and aurors start appearing to lead them off individually. The others mostly follow the aurors with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.
His platinum blonde hair hangs limply around his face, and it looks as though it had been cut clumsily by hand. His eyes, when he briefly scans the room upon entering, look dull and whatever brief flicker of hope may have been there is gone by the time he drops his head again to stare at the floor.
Ron and Hermione had lived with Harry for a while after the war, but they had eventually moved on to a place of their own. The three of them still get together once a week for dinner though, and it is at one of these dinners that the subject comes up.
“We have a program in place to find places for people in your position.” Weasley begins as they walk, all business. “Since you don’t have anyone who can claim you, the ministry has paired you up with a suitable alpha volunteer.”
“Fine. Fine, I know if I try to push this right now, you’re just going to dig your heels in and become more stubborn about this so fine.” Ron says, sounding exasperated. “Just- just promise me you won't officially agree to anything without finding out who it is first.”
Malfoy is bonded to some low level john. This man’s arrest isn’t exactly a big win for the department, but Harry still hopes he gets punished as much as possible.
Hermione gasps. Ron keeps talking, but to Harry everything sounds far more distant than it did a moment ago.
Tags have been updated, I forgot some pretty important ones so might want to check (I don’t recall if I added them before or after last update).
Ron, who had entered the auror academy shortly after the war, had taken to being an auror like a fish to water, but there are still some things he has to see and deal with in the course of his job that make him question if he wants to keep doing it, and it seems that today has been one of those days.
“But there’s one, even… even if his trial goes the way it should and his previous bond is deemed invalid, we’ve got nowhere to send him.” Ron says. “He only has one alpha relative, and he’s a known criminal so the ministry can’t release custody of an omega to him.”
It’s been like… almost two years (I think?) since I’ve written anything for this fic so I felt kinda rusty, hopefully it's not too different from the rest.
There are rumors of course, about what had happened to him, that he’d presented as an omega some time during the final battle and been spirited away by dark wizards or witches unknown, to be sold off to the highest bidder. Or that his parents had sent him away to the U.S. to avoid trial. There are also rumors that he’d presented as an alpha, and that he and Harry had fought to the death during the final battle, with Harry, obviously, being the victor.
Harry would be lying if he said he personally has made it a priority to look for him, he’s pretty sure only Malfoy’s parents can count themselves among that group.
I didn't find a chance to fit much of Cyrus into this chapter but I imagined that Delilah got Harry’s hair and Draco’s eyes and that Cyrus is the opposite and got Draco’s hair and Harry’s eyes.
Harry feels like he is intruding on a personal moment watching them, so he turns his attention back to his food, even though his appetite is gone.
Weasley smells bonded. But alphas can have multiple bonds, and anyway it wouldn’t be the first time Draco has met an alpha just looking for a little bit on the side.
On the one hand, they want to be free of this, free to seek out proper bonds, but by their nature their bonds make them, at least to some extent, want to stay bonded to whoever they are bonded to currently.
He is wearing a button up shirt, a jacket, and trousers, same as the others, but Harry can still see some of the marks. They crawl up his neck, and he even seems to have some on his hands.
Sorry for the delay on this, some personal things came up and i ended up not being able to post as planned. Thanks for sticking with it though,
(also if you have name suggestions for baby #2 that'd be cool, otherwise i might just go back and choose another from the ones people already gave.)
Ron thinks about it a moment. He’s certainly not opposed to bending or even breaking the rules on occasion, but maintaining the confidentiality of the people he helps in cases like these is more than just a rule to him, it’s something he considers very important.
Malfoy, who had always been such a proud git, looks so small and so broken, alone in a rickety looking chair before a crowd of strangers.
He had planned to try to stay calm. He had hoped that, if Malfoy did see him, that he could be some sort of comfort to him by remaining calm. But having to watch omega after omega being brought into the room to face whatever scumbag they are currently bonded to, the smell of their fear heavy in the room, has him practically clawing at the armrest on his chair before they even get to Malfoy’s case. He can hardly hear Hermione sitting next to him, trying to tell him to calm down.
It’s not like he and Malfoy had ever been together, it’s not like prior to Malfoy’s disappearance he had ever even wanted to be with Malfoy, but still… he wonders.
He tries to occupy his time with Teddy and home repairs, but Teddy’s a growing kid and only has so much time to spend with his godfather and Harry has already fixed up pretty much everything in Grimmauld Place over the last few years.
That night, Harry received a letter from Hermione. She had bought herself an owl, apparently. It was white, and it looked a lot like Hedwig, which made his heart hurt a little. But it was beautiful.
However, all of the doubts and embarrassment vanished when they entered the room. It didn’t even look like a hotel room – it was more like a decent-sized apartment. Harry looked around him, amazed. They had a beautiful suite in a beautiful city. Forget the sharing a room problem – this was going to be awesome. What could go wrong?
“What are you doing here?” He asked. He hadn’t even expected Draco to write to him so quickly, so he was very surprised to see him there. “And how did you know where I live?”
Draco smiled at him and unpacked his new clothes, folding them carefully, and putting them in the dresser next to his own bed. They had only spent two weeks in Paris and yet he had had the time to buy a whole new wardrobe, mostly made of black, brown, white and emerald green, the only colours he ever really wore. But Harry couldn’t criticize him on this considering his own questionable fashion choices.
Ever since he had left Hogwarts after the final battle, Harry felt like nothing had meaning anymore. He had been raised – no, used – for the past seven years as a toy. An object. A weapon. He had been raised to be a weapon of war and now that it was over, what was he supposed to do? He didn’t know anything else. Destroying the horcruxes, killing Voldemort. That’s all he had been thinking about for a year and a half. And now it was done. What was he supposed to do with himself? Who even was he?
“Only one minute left.” Harry responded, smiling widely. Draco was looking at him in the eyes intensely, his pupils dilated, his breath smelling a mixture of mint, weed and alcohol. It wasn’t bad. He quite liked it actually. Wait, why was he thinking about Malfoy’s breath? That was weird. And a little creepy.
“I know, she asked me to come back during Fred’s funeral…” He had to swallow the lump that had formed in his throat as he had said Fred’s name. “I’m not ready to go back to the Burrow. And it’s nice staying at Hogwarts. I feel… Useful. I’m helping, it’s good enough for me.”
She grabbed his hand and led him to a table in the back of the Three Broomsticks, where Ron, George, Luna and Ginny (who had both managed to sneak out) already were. Harry greeted everyone, smiling. He was glad to see them again, even though it hadn’t been that long. He sat at the table while George got up to go get them a pint, and quite a few people came over to say hi, eighth year students, older ones who had graduated, and even some that hadn’t come back to school for the year, just like him.
“Could be better. I’m… Trying to keep it together. It’s hard at home, I don’t blame you for not coming with us. It used to be so cheery all the time and now not a day goes by without someone pronouncing his name and bursting into tears. But it’s going to be alright, we just have to – put on a brave face and… Go on with our lives. For him.” Ginny’s voice cracked at these words but she quickly regained her composure, as she always did. She never let anyone see her cry. Ever.
“Yeah. Kreacher will kill me if he comes back here, it was his dream to have his head displayed there once he died. Completely nuts, that one.”
Just like this morning, he was right on time and took his usual seat at the first row. A few minutes passes and Draco was brought in by two Aurors, like his father. His was so pale and thin his skin looked grey, almost transparent. He sat in the chair and the chains didn’t surround him. This was a good sign. It meant they knew he wasn’t dangerous. Harry listened attentively as the charges of torture and working for the Dark Lord were announced, and as Draco defended himself. He was then called to the stand. His green eyes locked with Draco’s grey ones and he felt his throat dry up.
“Don’t care.” Harry shrugged. “I don’t see anything wrong with it, so if they do, well. It’s not exactly my problem, is it?”
Part of the reason why they didn’t really do anything about it was because this whole trip didn’t even feel like real life. They were spending time together, two old enemies, in beautiful cities, away from all of the drama, the rumours, the attention, the hatred, the hurt. It all felt so surreal, but so natural. Like it was all meant to be, and everything they had been through had led them to this for a reason.
“I wanted to see if you would follow me. I didn’t want to go up to you in the Great Hall and have your little guard hex me and I didn’t think you’d want to speak with me after… what happened.” Draco said, his tone cold. The usual facade he’d began to let go of when he was with Harry was back.
“That’s my speciality.” Harry gave him an over-exaggerated wink before turning back to check up on what his friends were doing.
He had left most of the things in Regulus’s room as they were. He had just cleaned up everything and put most of his personal belongings in a box he’d stored in the attic. He didn’t want to throw away his things like he’d done with their parents’s. He hadn’t hesitated to destroy nearly everything he had found in their quarters. They had been awful and abusive, even worse than the Dursleys, and Harry didn’t think they deserved any kind of respect.
The two men had spent the best day since they had left together. After unpacking all of their stuff, they had left the hotel and visited the city. It was absolutely beautiful, they had eaten at a small pizza place, and Harry had managed to eat a full meal for the first time in months. They had made some small talk, and were getting much closer. They actually had a lot in common, and liked a lot of the same stuff. They were both fans of wizard rock bands and had the same favourite wizard authors, though Draco had made fun of Harry’s lack of knowledge on the subject. A bond was forming between them, and though they couldn’t fully understand it, they didn’t do anything to stop it.
“Friends?” Draco snorted. “The Saviour-Of-The-Entire-World, friends with a Malfoy? I don’t think Dumbledore’s fanclub would appreciate that.”
“And you like dudes who won’t hesitate to have sex in club bathrooms. Honestly, Malfoy, that’s just unsanitary.”
Since it was Harry’s first time alone at Andromeda’s house, he had been a bit nervous. He didn’t really know what they were going to talk about, and he was afraid things would be awkward, but the night went by so fast. After spending some time with Teddy and getting him to sleep, they ate dinner and Harry had a really great time. Andromeda was such an interesting woman, she had so many fascinating stories about her years at Hogwarts, her insane family, Sirius, Tonks. They talked for hours, and the conversations they had were sometimes hard, but she never once gave Harry the time to get sad. Andromeda was one of the strongest, most interesting and funniest people Harry had ever met. And it was clear she had been raised with Draco’s mother – she had the same posh ways to talk and carry herself as he did.
“It feels weird to see you in my mother’s family’s home.” Draco said as he took a sip of his drink, looking around. Harry hadn’t even thought about that.
thank you for reading and happy new years! this chapter is a bit shorter but i had to cut it there. sorry for the slow updates, it's exam season and i'm super busy, but after jan 12th i'll be able to update more regularly<3
“I’m sorry but we only have one room left, it’s the middle of summer and we’re packed. It has two separate beds though, do you want it?”
“Thank you.” Professor McGonagall said, and everyone slowly quieted down again. “Those we loved and lost would want us to be strong, and to live. And this is what tonight is about. Taking back what was taken from us – our joy, our happiness, our lives. I want tonight to be a new beginning for us, and for our school. I want your laughters to be so loud they will chase away all of the demons and hatred haunting these walls. I want us to live for all of those who don’t have that privilege anymore. Let the festivities begin.” The new headmistress announced, smiling, and suddenly a ton of food appeared on each of the table.
“The stares, the people asking for autographs, wanting to talk to me… I know they mean no harm, and I don't blame them, but it gets too much sometimes, you know? I just want to be unknown, normal.
“My dear students, present and past, welcome to Hogwarts.” She looked around the room, offering one of her rare smiles. “It brings me an immense amount of joy to see all of you finally back in the castle. Firstly, I would like to thank each and every one of you for coming. I know how hard it must be for a lot of you to come back to this place, but I hope tonight’s event marks the day we can begin to form new and happy memories together, in this great place that was a home to you for years. Thank you to Professor Flitwick, Hagrid, Miss Turpin, Mr Goldstein, Mr McMillan and Mr Potter for their efforts in the reconstructions of the castle, and everyone else who participated in any way.” She made a brief pause as everyone applauded, and then her expression turned much more grave and serious.
The Malfoy nodded and followed Harry to a table next to the big windows. They had a nice view on the gigantic streets of London. Draco loved the city, he lived nearby and spent most of his free-time in the muggle streets and places of London. He wasn't fond of Hogsmead, the Diagon Alley or even the Leaky Cauldron. He hated the whispers about his father. He had nothing to do with him, he was completely different, he was never a Death Eater, never did anything wrong, never acted for the Dark Lord. He thought it was pretty unfair how wizards treated him just because of his name.
So when he felt the familiar rush of anxiety, he would quietly go to Ron’s room upstairs and tell the owl everything that was bothering him. Most of it had to do with Fred, or with how he wished he could go back to London without telling anyone, but didn’t want to cause the Weasleys and Hermione any more worry. He missed going out dancing, he missed kissing strangers, he missed the feeling of light-headedness that came with drinking, he missed smoking with Draco, and he missed feeling like he didn’t have a care in the world. He missed feeling alive.
He was open to the possibility, and it would imply a lot of renovations so it would keep him busy, but he still wasn’t really sure if it was a good idea. Part of him told him that this place was full of painful memories, it was the house where Sirius had suffered during his childhood, and everything about it made him think of his deceased godfather, but another part of him wanted to give the place a second chance. Maybe it could be like a rebirth. Erase all of the negativity it held to make it a home, a safe space. It was big, so he could even turn one of the rooms into a bedroom for Teddy for when he came to visit.
It was Harry’s turn to get quiet now. He didn’t have any idea that all of this was happening to him. He knew Draco didn’t believe in the “old ways” anymore but he didn’t know his father used to bloody torture him. But he didn’t show him any pity, he knew how awful it felt to have people look at you like you were a helpless puppy.
Had Harry missed something? Of course Ginny and Luna were just friends, why did she feel the need to defend herself?
“W- I went to London for a night, and then I spent two weeks in Paris, and I spent a day in Florence.”
Harry gave him a small smile, waved and then went back to the Great Hall to find his friends. Hermione tapped Ron’s shoulder when she saw him and gave a nod in his direction. Harry sat down at their table.
If Harry hadn’t been on their little trip with Malfoy, he would’ve never defended the Slytherins, but spending time with him had made him realize why they’d behaved the way they did in Hogwarts. Yes, Pansy was a bitch and she’d tried to sell him to Voldemort, and Harry didn’t like her, but he’d realized she’d only reacted like this to protect her friends. And Harry probably would’ve done the same if it meant protecting the people he loved.
hi,, i'm really sorry but i'm putting this story on hiatus for now. i just haven't had the inspiration for it and i don't know how to continue it. i don't know if i will continue it one day but i will try my hardest to find the right way to put all of my ideas on paper. sorry
The trial for the Carrows will take place on May 27th at 9am, followed by Rookwood’s at 2pm, and Avery’s at 5pm.
of July, after one final shopping spree at the Galeries Lafayette – which had mostly been for Draco since Harry only wore jeans and graphic tees he found in thrift shops, to the blonde’s disgust – they went back to the hotel to pack their stuff and check out. Harry had bought a few clothes as well during their stay, so his backpack really wasn’t big enough anymore, and Draco had insulted his magical skills before casting an undetectable extension charm on said bag.
The next morning, Harry woke up with a raging headache. He tried to grab his glasses from his nightstand, and as he was about to put them on his nose, he was startled by the sound of cars driving by. What the fuck?
“Thanks. Um, just don’t tell her you heard it from me. Make it seem casual. If Pansy hears I’ve talked about this to a Gryffindor, she’ll have my head.” Draco said, chuckling.
Harry had been delighted to find out the Healer’s at St Mungo’s had nearly fully healed the Grangers, and even though their memories were still a bit fuzzy, they remembered Hermione. He had also received a long letter from Ginny telling him they should officially break up, even though they weren’t really in a relationship anymore anyway, and they should go back to being good friends instead, which should’ve probably made him feel sad, but he was mostly relieved. He didn’t even see her as anything more than a close friend anymore, and the letter was mostly to clear things up. Draco had found that absolutely hilarious, “Oh Potter, being broken up with by letter after making out with dudes almost every night, you must be devastated”. He did feel a bit guilty about that but it wasn’t like they had acted like a couple the few times they had seen each other before Harry left, so it wasn’t really that big of a deal.
Harry nodded and got up as well, and they went back to the Great Hall together. Harry suddenly felt much lighter, as if a huge weight had been lifted from his shoulders. He hadn’t realized until now how much he had needed George’s forgiveness. He went back to sit at his table and put his empty glass down. His sight was getting blurry and he didn’t want to be wasted in front of everybody or else the Prophet would have a field day.
It was midnight in a few minutes. Draco and Harry were dancing together in a club, their bodies nearly touching, only a few small centimetres separating them. They had smoked a bit with some guys they didn’t know in front of the club before going in and had had a bit too many shots, so they were completely wasted, as always. The music was loud, the club was packed, it was hot. But as with everything these days, they didn’t care, too caught up in their spiral of denial of their feelings, trauma and self-destruction.
The younger girl’s eyes were closed, a gentle smile on her face. Her hair, blonde as the elder’s, was tied back into a very loose braid. Her face was delicate, with moderately high cheekbones, a soft curve of the jaw, and a cute, slightly turned up nose. With long eyelashes and full lips, she cut an adorable and classically feminine figure. Her body was well formed, with a generous bust, narrow waist, and moderately wide hips.
on it. And then I have to keep it pulled. And if I let go, I go back to… well…” the fourth year motioned down his body. “
All attention turned to Molly Weasley, who deftly slipped by the question by letting them know it was no subject of breakfast, and not for children either. It seemed like the matter was closed.
Harry, giddy with excitement, fell out of his meditation, not able to keep it up anymore. He’d finally be able to begin the process of actually changing. Harry was so happy, he decided to do his physical workout as well, just to blow off some steam.
Harry was shifting from foot to foot outside the headmaster’s door; so much so, that Hermione backhanded his arm and hissed at him to quit fidgeting. The two teens waited for a couple minutes, then heard Dumbledore call out “Enter!” Harry opened the door, then let Hermione in after him.
Ron looked a little closer, which caused Harry to redden a bit. A lightbulb apparently went off in his head, because he did next what he often did best; put his foot in his mouth.
Draco Malfoy. The git. The insufferable, maddening smirk on his face made Harry want to kick the prat in the shin just to hear him yelp in pain. Harry did have to stop to appreciate the figure the Slytherin boy cut though. His upper-class breeding had resulted in fairly aristocratic, fine boned, and graceful body structure. His childhood fat was coming off, leaving toned arms and legs, and Harry blushed lightly as he thought
Pomfrey made a derisive sound, and Harry looked back at her unrepentantly. “What? I’m not the first person to learn how to be an animagus in school, and I bet I won’t be the last.”
Harry leant into Fleur’s embrace, confused and not understanding what the situation was, but experiencing a lightheaded warm feeling. As far as he knew, the transformation had gone swimmingly, and he could now work on going back to his normal body.
“I see!” he exclaimed, after a good twenty minutes. “I will need to run some more diagnostics to be sure, but let me ask a couple of clarifying questions first..” Harry looked at Albus expectantly.
“You seem comfortable enough in your uniform and on the stick, I wager you aren’t lying about being on your sports team.” Harry took minor offence to the backhanded compliment, but realized afterward that it was a
With a predatory smile, the redhead put a finger to her lip as if thinking. “What was it you said to me this summer, Harry? Oh yes!” Ginny clasped her hands underneath her chin and continued in a high-pitched, mocking tone “‘I’m gay, not an effing girl. Merlin, Ginny.’” She then flopped on Harry’s bed and across his lap, giggling madly.
She figured that when she returned the boy to his castle, she would put her name in the Goblet of Fire. Y’know, since she was gonna be there anyway. No need to make too much of a fuss since the opportunity was there to be subtler.
“Well, it’s my job to be the fastest and most agile on the team to catch a tiny little ball that ends the game.” Harry explained. “It’s actually to my advantage to be small and light-weight.”
"No problem. Just know I'm always here when you want me." With the same infuriating, shit-eating grin, he turned on his heel and left.
I blinked up at the Gryffindor's frustrated expression. So McGonagall put him up to this? Wait, I "have a heart?" I couldn't wrap my head around it all. Harry sighed and stood.
"I once inflated my aunt at fifteen because she talked shit to my face. Got an earful from the ministry."
"Well…" He cleared his throat. "One day, it was raining, so we couldn't go out, and we were ransacking my father's liquor cabinet, and he… Just…" He fidgeted uncomfortably, but I'd never hung on someone's words like his in this moment. "Pushed me to the floor, and…" His Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed. "Sucked me off."
Seeing him positioned between my legs was both thrilling and nerve-wracking, but I'd already braced myself.
He had immediately dropped his gaze and slowed his pace, but I knew what I saw. Maybe he was jealous of the fact I had friends that respected me, since that used to be him. A pang of pity shocked me. No one had said a word to him yet, so my role McGonagall had assigned me hadn't yet come to use, but
His words faded before my wide eyes as my cheeks warmed. My heart swelled so large it nearly choked me, and I sat frozen for a solid several minutes.
" The guilt in his expression didn't vanish as I'd hoped it would've, so I continued. "Fuck it, it's even okay if you actually do still have feelings for him.
"This is weird. I know you're still sixteen because that's the last time I saw you, but can we… Not do this?" I begged as I forced myself to my feet.
"Well… Patronuses are summoned from good memories, so I… Can't say I'm surprised, but… Maybe we can make some good memories together? Ones that would be strong enough to produce a Patronus?"
Another glance at Harry's encouraging expression, and I was uncomfortably stepping over the bench to sit next to him. I'd say I'd never felt so hated by the people around me, but it wouldn't have been true. This was a familiar discomfort.
but at that moment we arrived at the astronomy tower and I paused. Luna's sixth sense must've kicked in because she took my hand firmly. I smiled at her.
Finally, we were next. I stifled a groan as we made our way to the front of the class. Expressions ranging from intrigue, to embarrassment, to disgust, to bewilderment littered the faces before us, but I only rolled my eyes as I introduced our topic.
He seemed distressed, and deep in thought, as we went, and I clutched his hand in mine. The smile he turned to me was obviously forced, but I didn’t comment on it. As we slid into the bench at the Gryffindor table, I audibly hissed again, despite my best efforts. It was a few moments into our meal that Ron and Hermione finally joined us.
After dinner, Draco nearly had to run to keep up with me as I rushed back to the dorms. As dumb as I probably looked, I was excited to hang out in his room. I'd gotten a glimpse this morning, but I wanted a full tour.
Slughorn was calling me to the front of the classroom to speak to me. With a glance toward Harry's retreating (engaged) figure, I reluctantly met Slughorn at his podium.
"You…" I couldn't find the words to express how insecure this made me feel, so I decided to roughly jostle him with my elbow in his rib.
Draco hummed in assent, and I clumsily offered my empty glass back to his wand. After refilling it, I swallowed as much of it as I could. Seeing I'd drunk all I could, he took the glass from my hand and set both of ours down on the bedside table.
My amusement splintered, though, when I pictured everyone else following my lead and being facetiously nice to him like some running joke. It'd still be a kind of bullying…
My right arm snaked under Harry's torso and hoisted him up further on the bed, once again briefly disconnecting our mouths. Once he'd realized what I was trying to do, he assisted, pulling himself fully onto the bed. I heard his shoes hit the floor, and I hastily shed my own as I climbed on top of him. He'd propped himself up on his elbows, and I took a moment to sit back on his lap and appraise him.
My hand released his, and it fell to his side. I hadn't meant to act so negatively when I didn't feel that way, so all I could think to do to make up for this perceived dismissal was to tilt his dejected face up to mine and kiss him again. I couldn't get enough of his lips, if I was honest with myself. And the resulting flush in his cheeks was well worth it. I smiled.
"Leave it alone, Hermione," I tried to sound threatening, but I wasn't truly worried she'd do anything to jeopordize the situation. She was just taking the mickey, but if anyone else caught on at this stage…
the day the whole school found out I was shacking up with Draco would be the day we’d have to stand before our peers and give a presentation. My mouth went dry as we slid into our seats.
We snickered quietly as the presentations continued. It was all very mind-numbing, and my thoughts began straying toward this morning, when suddenly an idea interrupted them. Frowning, I quietly withdrew my Basic Charms and Spells textbook from my bag, flipping it open to M. Draco eyed me curiously as I looked up a certain Latin suffix used in some offensive spells. Once I’d found it, a glimmer of hope lit within me. Grey eyes were still trained on my book, and I vigorously circled the following definition:
Several professors were hastily approaching the scene from the end of the room, but I’d immediately ripped my hand out of Draco’s and sprinted to the scene.
“Merlin forbid,” he teased as I pulled him into me, resting his head on my shoulder with my arm around him. “So you’re…
"It's… Better than the first, I'll say." Taking another swig, I fought against the contortions my face threatened at the taste. The mouthful slid uneasily down my throat as he followed suit, much more casually than I. A cough forced its way out of my mouth as I continued. "Sorry, I just pictured…"
With a scowl, he set to work unpacking his luggage which was waiting for him at the foot of his bed. Luckily, he would be reusing all the textbooks he'd previously bought, and was already somewhat familiar with the contents. The classes wouldn't be the hard part of this semester, but he still intended to focus on passing his NEWTs. Getting out of here was the ultimate goal.
We both turned toward the Room of Requirement, only to realize we'd be walking together if we both went now. I laughed awkwardly.
push me away, I subtly nestled my hips against his a bit more firmly. His knee lifted as a reaction, pushing me forward slightly. The friction this caused between our blossoming erections drew another gasp from his lips, and his eyes fully closed.
Both our mouths were very dry, so when our kiss ended, I reached behind me to grab our glasses again.
"Hm. Well, we'll just start without him." Sinistra launched into her lesson, but my ears could only hone in on the whispers around me.
‘That’s me you’re talking about. And I happen to be fully enamoured with YOU’ He thrust the page, and this message, back at me pointedly.
"Has no one and nothing. He survived the same war as you and I. My job here is to nurture the next generation of witches and wizards, and that job doesn't end with problematic individuals, but that's rather where it begins."
We sat like that a few moments more as Draco caught his breath, but I could've held him for hours. Eventually, though, he sniffed and pulled away to wipe his eyes on his sleeves. A hiccupping kind of laugh choked out between his lips as he gave me a wavering smile.
"M-morning, I was just… Er…" I vaguely gestured toward my door and brushed past her without another word.
After class, I decided I'd go talk to Malfoy. Whether or not anyone saw me didn't matter, I wasn't doing it to make a point. There were just some things I had to know.
"I… Really can't understand what you see in me, but… For what it's worth, you've… Completely destroyed my expectations for this year."
"Of you? Never." I took another valiant gulp of my drink, but stopped short of finishing it. My throat threatened a gag, but I breathed evenly to keep pace with it.
"Lay against my pillows," he instructed, and I complied, shifting to lay back on his bed as intended. He passed a hand over his mouth before joining me, kneeling between my legs. "Are you…
But beyond this simple interaction, Draco's posture spoke volumes. He wasn't curled in on himself, or hunched to make himself smaller, he was sitting forward with his elbows on the table, talking calmly with the fascinated Scot.
“Git,” he uttered as he withdrew his textbook and notes. I followed suit as Slughorn began class, but my heart was still in knots several minutes into his lecture, so I gestured for our note-passing Horcrux journal page. Once it was placed on my desk, my quill was immediately on its surface.
a prick," I smiled, recalling all the times he'd teased me. "But now… You're different. You're my silver lining." Both our cheeks flamed as I reiterated Hermione's prior assessment.
I didn't go back to the dorms. Instead, I went to the infirmary. It was past time my bandages were changed.
I forced my mouthful down my throat as I reluctantly played the hero card. My bravado sounded false even to my own ears, so I glanced at Draco to see if he believed me.
When I paused my stride to rejoin them, she jumped up from the table and approached me, still grinning playfully.
Withdrawing my own robes, I returned to the side of the bed. Draco blinked up at me, a bleary smile spreading across his face.
"Before I was really allowed to know what my father was involved in," Draco continued, seeing me listening so intently. "He would have these guests over, and… One of them had a son around my age, must've been like, fifteen… And we were mostly left to our own devices when our fathers would have their clandestine meetings, so…"
as much as I wanted to drown myself in it. After a long, intense silence, he seemed to brace himself. Expecting words like
This time, when my mouth returned, I took his head into my mouth. He inhaled deeply as I ventured to swallow as much as I could. Draco let out a stuttering breath as I tested my oral limits. The taste of him flooded my senses, and I was suddenly sucking off as much of him as I could handle.
"Cheers," I set my bag of crisps and notes back on the desk, took one and had a sip. "So, will you be… Dreaming tonight?"
"Hm. Time works weird in dreams." I angled my face up to blink up at his. "Without a doubt, the best night's rest I've had in years, though."
Each step felt like I was wading through quicksand, but as humiliating as it was having Harry follow my progress, I felt a small sense of security having him there. I knew he'd let me run if it came down to it, so there wasn't any pressure from him.
I wasn't complaining, honestly. This particular school year was about to be the worst yet for me, if she hadn't nudged Harry in my direction. I wanted to thank her.
My next period was a free period, so I decided to go to the library, where I expected Hermione to join (maybe Ron if she insisted). Once slumped in a seat, I half-heartedly took out some notes I meant to clean up, but my mind was stuck.
Don't pretend like you didn't skip ahead to this chapter when you read my summary, just to see if my "explicit" rating was accurate. I said what I said, alright?
"That wasn't a threat, you greasy, disgusting pile of shit." Harry stepped up dangerously close to my father. "It was a
We both arrived early to Potions. This time, we chose side-by-side seats near the back of the class.
"What do you want from me?" I interrupted his asinine question. A long silence stretched after my question, during which I looked up to find a startled expression on his face. This shock eased into discomfort, though, which I thought only fair, since he was encroaching on my comfort zone.
took over his features. His hands were still on my cheeks as I leaned forward to kiss that damnably snoggable face. The hands on my face pressed our lips together more tightly, and I thought I’d pass out so fast was my heart thudding in my ribs.
"Well, I just thought we were horny teenagers that needed a release! And we were bored, and we only had each other at the time, and everyone experimented in their youth, right?" I defended, but suddenly, it clicked. "Hang on… How did you know I didn't think I was gay?"
Harry finally rejoined us, and the worry that had been creasing his brow had lifted. We smiled at each other as he finally started eating, and I shot a grateful smile at the Granger girl -
Harry, however, only grinned and leaned forward to plant a kiss square on my lips. I lingered as he sat back, and my reopening eyes perceived the
"Just start with one," he cautioned me, and I nodded. Slowly pushing my finger inside him was the strangest sensation. He was tight toward the outside, but the inside was so very warm. I found myself fascinated with limited vision, and maximum sensation. Experimentally, I pressed the spot I guessed to be where he'd done so to me, and was rewarded with his breathy, "
Harry’s emotions flooded into me, along with familiar sensations that intertwined with my own body’s.
I swallowed. Harry's confession was terrifying, and his expression even more so. Even then, he shook his head and smiled up at me.
"Alright. The only thing that could make up for my… Transgressions… Would be…" My eyes widened as I watched him strip his shirt off, turn away from me, and withdraw his wand. With it pointed at his own back, I barely heard him utter, "Finite incantatem."
Malfoy looked absolutely stunned, like he had just received a Pertificus Totalus but without the whole falling to the ground part.
“Merlin, Hermione, calm down, will you? I was just getting some air and smoked one cigarette, it’s not a big deal.” Harry sighed. He knew his friends just wanted the best for him but it was suffocating sometimes.
“You’re just saying that because you can’t dance and don’t have any dress robes, Ronald.” Ginny retorted, smirking, as Hermione laughed beside her.
Harry pushed through the sweaty bodies, trying to make his way to the bathroom so he could apparate back to the hotel without bringing any attention from the muggles. After shoving a few people out of his way, he entered into a stall and quickly apparated directly in front of the hotel, not even caring that apparating into a muggle area was illegal. He just had to find Malfoy. This was bad. Something felt wrong.
Harry laughed, picturing a small Draco – which just looked like him now but much smaller – coming face to face with this horrifying sight.
Once they had finished packing and checking out of the hotel, they went to the nearest International Apparition Point, which was much safer than regular apparition on long distances, and apparated to Florence, hand in hand.
“No, I swear!” Draco exclaimed as Harry was laughing like crazy. “I was looking for Pansy, my freaking Yule Ball date, and found her making out with Daphne outside in the bushes! I was so mad!”
Draco drops his gaze but stands and goes to Weasley obediently. Weasley leads him out of the room and down a hallway.
A singular master would grow frustrated with him quickly he is sure, and then where would he be sent?
“Doesn’t the ministry have a program to help find suitable mates for omegas in cases like this?” Hermione asks.
He spends the rest of the trial with his head down, and he doesn’t really hear anything that is said. The trials are really just a formality, the aurors had explained to them. Officially they have to happen, and the people on trial are entitled to face them. But the bonds are going to be deemed invalid, the evidence the aurors found in the raid too strong for anyone to squirrel their way out of a conviction.
Harry doesn’t work, he doesn’t really need to between his investments and savings, and the seemingly endless hours between being approved and Malfoy’s trial are the first time he really regrets that decision.
He wonders what will become of him now. What will become of him, an omega not legally able to care for himself, with the bond he is currently in deemed invalid, his masters all in prison, and his parents either unwilling or unable to come for him.
Hermione is a beta, and she’s more than capable of holding her own in a fight if needed. But Harry can understand Ron, who is an alpha same as Harry, needing the reassurance that his mate is okay either way.
When Weasley opens the door for him and he steps through to meet the alpha who has apparently volunteered to claim him though, suddenly Weasley doesn’t seem like all that bad of a prospect.
