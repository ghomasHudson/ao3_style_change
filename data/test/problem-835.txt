Granger shook her head with a small smile. “No, but thank you for the offer.” She sat down primly in the same armchair she’d sat in the last time she’d visited.
“The curse breaker that came along that day offered to check the other books while she was here. She said that she’s cleared everything she can, which leaves only the Familial spells to deal with.”
“I see,” Draco deliberated slowly, beginning to realise the purpose of Potter’s visit. “And I suppose you want me to help you handle the rooms?”
“I complain about you mooning about the Manor, not because I think you need to be out working somewhere. I complain because it breaks my heart to see you wasting away here with me. I’ve already lived my life to its fullest, but you… you are so young. You still have so much to do with your life and knowing that you live like this because of my and your father’s foolishness, is almost too much for me to bear.”
Potter scratched his ear. “Is tomorrow alright for you? I have training all weekdays but I finish at four. Drop by at around five?”
Harry looked even less convinced now. “Draco, something is very wrong here.” He took a step closer and Draco took two steps back. “Why won’t you let me touch you?”
Potter was dozing off by the window, snuggled up in a cushy armchair that someone must have brought up from the sitting room. He was pale and his face was thinner than Draco remembered, but most of all, he looked astonishingly
“I’m fine. Really.” Draco replied quickly, alarmed by the look in the woman’s eyes. It was the same look he’d seen in his mother’s eyes just before she became an overly concerned parent, fussing and coddling as if he were still five years old.
Draco sniffed. “Just because you won the last two games doesn’t mean you’re on some sort of a streak. Must I remind you that I won the first two games?”
come over anyways. Honestly, Draco shouldn’t have been surprised. Gryffindors and Weasleys never could read the mood.
When he entered the kitchen, he found the small kitchen table already set with their meal. Both he and his mother refused to ever eat in the dining room again unless extremely important guests came over and even Aunt Dromeda joined them in the kitchen when she happened to visit. She’d suggested that remodelling the room might help them to get over their aversion towards it, but as they still hadn’t gotten down to doing it, mealtimes took place in the comely Manor kitchens.
Only the Golden Trio remained, the others having left earlier with the excuse that they all had work the next day and therefore had to rise early. Weasley approached him with Granger now, but Potter seemed to have disappeared.
Draco found himself smiling in response. “I was contemplating how to punish you for your little laughing fit back in the shop but I see the answer is more laughter. How deliciously ironic.”
Potter’s pleased excitement abruptly left him and all of a sudden he was giving Draco an unexpected shove, sending him toppling over with a startled yelp.
Draco ignored him as best he could and took hold of his mother’s arm, ready to lead her away from them. If they didn’t get away soon, he had no idea what he might do.
Thin Lips tutted disapprovingly. “My, my, such vulgar language. Didn’t your mother teach you any better?”
Draco smirked. “Ginny and I make a pretty good team if I do say so myself. She’d have done well in Slytherin, something you couldn’t possibly understand.”
“He’ll get over it,” Ginny replied flippantly. “Now let’s get this game started! Dad will play referee.”
Instead, he pulled out the oak wand that he couldn’t quite bring himself to call ‘his’ yet. It had belonged to his Grandmother Druella and didn’t fully feel
Ginny stood up abruptly, startling Draco and almost making him fall over. He glared at her as he caught himself just in time and she grinned back, stepping out from under the porch roof. Her hair almost looked like it was on fire from the way the sunlight set it ablaze.
Seemingly satisfied that Draco wasn’t going to speak, Harry nodded. “Come here.” he ordered and Draco obediently came to stand in front of him. Harry started babbling at once.
The veela sniffed in disdain as she looked down at him but then her eyes fell on the pretty buns he’d made from her daughters’ hair and a delighted smile came to her face. Draco’s face heated up. He may have been gay as they came but even he felt his heart stutter at the utter radiance of the woman before him.
“It’s not that,” Weasley indignantly called after him. “We’re celebrating Malfoy finishing the job.”
Draco stepped forward as well, and now they were so close he could feel the warmth radiating from the man in front of him. “When I first agreed to help you, I asked you what I’d gain from it all. In all truth, I gained a lot of things. I got my wand back, I made new acquaintances–”
the two of them looked together. Certainly they made a handsome couple but it was more than just that. They shared an easy connection that few ever did; a sort of emotional bond that spoke of the trust and understanding between them.
“Let’s fix this then,” Potter pressed, a twinkle in his eye now. “Let’s take turns picking a random topic and then the other person has to give their opinion about it.”
As Draco proceeded slowly, Potter leaned back on his hands and watched him. “Whose turn is it again?” he asked in deference to the conversation game they still played.
Ginevra’s face broke into a brilliant smile as she too stared around the room. “The room looks amazing! Draco, gosh did you do all this?”
Draco would have turned over to go to sleep then, but the letter on top looked to be from Ginny. Call him a glutton for punishment, but he decided to read it.
“Oh.” Draco knew that he probably sounded like a dunce but he didn’t know what else to say. He couldn’t help staring at the man in front of him, feeling faint as he took in the deep scars. He knew exactly how Bill had got them and a lump formed in his throat as he recalled the horrible feeling he’d had when he saw Greyback come through the Vanishing cabinet.
Before any more could be said, Potter returned, breathing heavily as if he’d run back. He regarded them both suspiciously but Weasley was busily blowing up a balloon and looking convincingly as if he’d been doing that the whole time. Draco had to admit, he was craftier than he’d given him credit for.
“Just because you’re clean and look after your hair and skin doesn’t make you gay,” Ginny said with one shouldered shrug. “I mean, take Charlie for instance. He’s probably the roughest out of all the Weasley men but he’s also as queer as a magenta hippogriff.”
“Now,” she gave a sad smile. “I fear that for once you’re ready to give someone your heart and I just don’t want to see you get hurt.”
“Careful there Potter.” Draco said, reaching out to steady the other wizard. “Wouldn’t want to hurt yourself.”
Draco was sure a wicked look had come onto his face. “Well…” he began but Potter suddenly intervened.
“You bet you lily white arse it is!” she replied hotly, poking him hard in the chest. “As you’re friend – and yes, we are friends now, so it’s no use putting up a fuss – I have every right to tell you when you’re doing something that could potentially ruin something beautiful!”
“That’s still boring.” Fred declared and then turned to Louis and James. “Come on, let’s go play in the garden.”
“Really?” Al asked with wide eyes. “Were you friends?” Now it was Draco’s turn to not know how to respond. He looked up from Al and when his eyes met Potter’s, he finally understood why he’d found Al’s eyes, and James’ stare, so familiar. They were all Potter.
“Stop calling it action!” Potter sputtered, red in the face and eyes wide behind his glasses. “It makes it seem like more
In a panic Draco turned to Luna but the witch seemed to have disappeared. In fact, now that he thought about it, the ‘pop’ he’d heard just as the door opened had sounded suspiciously like the sound of
,” Potter replied with a frustrated sigh. “The Familial spells seem to bring the curses back no matter how much I break them.”
What Pansy had said resonated with him, but was he really willing to take a chance like that? Yes, he fancied Potter, but at the same time, he
“Potter, you will keep your hands to yourself!” Draco felt like he would spontaneously combust right then and there.
“Bye Draco.” The boys chirruped together and Draco waved as the children followed their father into the crowd. Soon the family was out of sight and Draco wondered for a moment if he had bitten off more than he could chew.
“Thank you.” Potter squeezed his shoulder once and stepped closer, a solid length of heat against Draco’s side. “You didn’t have to but you still said you’d help and you have.”
“Well…” Draco considered the suggestion for a moment. It did sound inviting and he found himself eager to meet his aunt. “Alright.” he finally said and Teddy gave a whoop and sprang to hug him.
He stumbled out of bed and made his way to the Floo. He couldn’t do this anymore; he needed a way out. The clock read half past eleven and he scowled. Blaise and Pansy were probably in some state of undress at this hour but he
“There isn’t that much left to tell really.” Potter admitted. “Ginny and I got a divorce, and the weird thing was no one made a big fuss about it. Except for the Prophet of course, but they don’t count. The Weasleys were wonderful about it all. Ginny moved out and got herself an apartment. We share custody of the children but they stay with me since Ginny’s work takes her out of the country often. She’s a sports reporter and a bloody good one at that. I quit the Aurors and never looked back. It gave me more time to spend with the kids and I find that not fighting for once is a rather nice way to live.”
“Fear not my prudish friend, we gave them the boot,” Blaise answered. “I was quite enjoying that one actually but for some reason Pansy said that you were more important than a random fuck.”
In typical Draco fashion, he’d thrown an enormous hissy fit and had only been somewhat placated when Harry offered to keep back his own wand as well – another decision he greatly regrets now. Harry has a feeling that the cartload of pumpkins is part of a passive-aggressive revenge plan on Draco’s part, but one never
Ginny went back inside for a moment and returned with a large wall clock in her hands. She placed it on Draco’s lap and he stared at in awe, tracing a finger delicately along its surface. “It’s brilliant,” he whispered as a pleasant thrum of magic emanated from it, and he took in the many hands. Ginny’s and her parents’ pointed at ‘Home’ and her brothers were at ‘Work’ or ‘Travelling’. Except not all of them, he suddenly realized with a sick lurch, his eyes landing on the hand that pointed to ‘Lost’. Fred Weasley’s picture was darkened and unmoving, his face frozen in a roguish smile. While the other hands seemed to quiver with spirit, this one was still.
Draco had been to the Black estate only a few times and only as a very young child but he could still remember the gloom and foreboding that seemed to perpetually hang over the grimy house. He could see why his aunt had decided to relinquish any more dealings with the place.
The near-kiss debacle of a week ago hadn’t really changed anything at first, and he’d chalked it off as one of those spur-of-the-moment things Potter had been talking about. The problem however, was that if that were truly so, it wouldn’t have almost happened again… and again…
“Not as much as yours would say if I told her about that night in Liverpool,” Draco returned with a vicious smirk.
“Is that why you asked me if I was gay?” Draco asked, their conversation in the attic coming to mind. Potter nodded hesitatingly.
Potter cleared his throat awkwardly, Weasley looked just about ready to laugh, and Draco wondered if he could survive jumping out the window. The moment of truth, however, was interrupted as the door swung open to admit Granger, face set in a mulish expression. They all stared at her and she crossed her arms tightly, lifting her chin and setting her jaw.
“I…” Potter’s voice was still thick with desire and he paused for a moment to clear his throat. “I’d better see what that was.” he said in a more normal voice. “Maybe you could…” he nodded hopefully towards the still open door and Draco was tempted to accept his blatant invitation.
They’d reached the shop now and even inside, Harry stuck to Ginevra’s side. Lily had wanted to be with her father too so she was now seated on his shoulders. The boys after realizing that Draco wasn’t in a conversational mood, had also drifted to their parents and as Draco watched the family interact, he felt an ache inside him. Harry and Ginevra were laughing over something while Lily played with her mother’s long hair, tickling Harry’s face with it. James and Al were trying to be helpful by bringing over perfumes to smell and they’d tug on both their parents’ sleeves to get their attention. Draco watched from the other side of the shop as one would watch a film.
Potter’s jaw clenched and he jabbed a finger at Draco. “I did not make her cry, nor did I forcibly kiss her. If anything, she kissed
“So you’re buying an owl?” Potter inquired genially, nodding at the cage Draco had placed on the counter.
When the two finally arrived, they looked anything but pleased. They were wearing matching sleep robes, haphazardly pulled on, and Blaise hadn’t even bothered to close his. He sported a pair of black pants and his lean, dark torso was on full display. Pansy’s hair was a right mess, her lipstick smudged and some impressive hickeys littered her neck. There was no question as to what they’d been up to when he’d called.
Unable to resist the urge to ruffle Potter’s feathers even more, Draco put an arm around Ginny and allowed her to snuggle up even closer. She smiled blearily up at him before yawning again and closing her eyes. Potter’s face was a veritable thundercloud and Draco hid a satisfied smile behind his glass. It might do Potter some good to fret about for a bit and Draco had always jumped at a chance to get on his nerves. The saying ‘
“I told you, Pomfrey healed me so I don’t have a scar or anything but if she hadn’t…” He shuddered before leaning forward. “I could have lost my whole arm.” he said in a stage whisper. The children recoiled, though Fred, James and Louis did say “Cool!”
“It belonged to you in the first place and it’d already served its purpose.” Potter replied with a shrug, taking a seat in one of the armchairs and beginning to set up the board on a small table he pulled in front of him.
“Well, I’ll admit he is rather small,” she allowed, stroking its head gently. “If not a post owl, he can at least serve as a companion.”
“You came after me which makes you late.” Draco had no idea what he was saying anymore. His mouth seemed to be doing a Longbottom impression.
“Darling,” Pansy sighed. “You know we worry about you. Why can’t you just accept Blaise’s invitation and join us here in Italy? There’s plenty of room and so much to do! It’ll be like old times again.”
“So you’re telling me that Potter wasn’t dating Ginny after all, he returns your feelings wholeheartedly, Weasley and Granger seem to approve as well, and you
“I can’t believe it,” he said in a trembling voice. “You’re actually buying him. You’re buying the Little Owl!”
Draco wondered if the man knew the definition of miserable in the first place. Face-splitting grins surely weren’t the default expression of unhappy people as far as he knew.
“Oh, I will. A proper splurge, in fact,” she declared gleefully. “I worked at George’s shop for a while before school began and I’ve saved up quite a lot. I’m going all out with everyone’s birthday presents this year. You know, I used to think that presents were a superficial way of showing love and so I didn’t put so much effort before. The family never minded but I’ve had boyfriends who thought it meant I didn’t care for them. Hoping to change that this year and get him something to show just how much he means to me.”
“I said… you need to calm down,” Potter panted and Draco twisted as the hot puffs of air fell on his face. “Stop squirming, you little shite.”
Ginny shrugged. “I had a feeling you were going to find more things to apologize about and frankly I couldn’t be arsed to listen to it all. I forgive you, Drakes. Water under the bridge.”
“Smart lad.” He finally smiled and Draco relaxed in response to the easy-going grin that now graced Bill’s face. He looked so different from the serious, foreboding man of a few seconds ago and even his scars seemed to be less noticeable. He was pretty attractive actually, and Draco felt his face heat up at this realization. To make matters worse, he suddenly felt a finger stroke the back of his neck and jerked away with a shriek, stumbling straight into Bill’s firm chest.
Narcissa pauses for a long moment. Harry's Auror training begins to prickle at his skin like a long-forgotten high summer heat. She knows something.
," Harry says with frustration. "He said the memories were real, that they weren't dreams, and I needed to find him — "
"Remember what they said in Auror training? You can't spend all your time thinking about the case or you're going to burn out, and then you won't be able to help anyone."
Harry half-listens to Astoria and Matthew bicker. From Matthew's words about messing with people's heads, his thoughts flow like a river until he's recalling his earlier conversation with Hermione. He'd been able to forget it for an hour or so, while he was driving, but now it sits in his head like a heavy rock.
"That a mother's love brought about the first downfall of the Dark Lord, and a mother's love ensured his defeat again seventeen years later."
He leaves the manor soon after, retracing the same route. The vial is heavy in his pocket, and it's a long drive back to Ron and Hermione's house. Hermione answers the door, a mug of tea in one hand.
Astoria opens her mouth, but then looks across at Matthew and seems to catch an unspoken reassurance. She moves closer to him and he puts an arm around her shoulders. Narcissa gazes unseeingly at the fire.
It's the first time he's stepped into his office since Draco came back. It's strange how everything's exactly how he left it five days ago, last Thursday. Draco's file is still in his drawer. The pensieve, filled with memories, sits undisturbed in its cabinet. Harry takes off his cloak and hang it on a peg before sitting behind his desk. The owls flutter around him, eventually settling into a neat line. One particular owl — a large hawk owl — pecks the other owls until they've shuffled aside.
Draco’s eyes went wide, and, ignoring the brief flash of pain the hasty motion brought on, tore his right arm out from under the blankets. Only to see the sleeve and leather band having previously hidden the mark from view unmistakably gone.
Draco scowled, confused, and he was about to snap at the man to please at least try to keep up, the utter imbecile, invisible stomach wounds notwithstanding. However, before he could, Jennings’ words sunk in, as did his own.
“But then,” Harry said—or rather, croaked, because suddenly his throat felt awfully constricted, “why did you lose it when I told you I was going on a date with Nic?”
“Salazar, Potter,” he huffed, dragging his heels. After all, he couldn’t have Harry thinking he’d gone soft or anything so demeaning. “You may have been discharged a full ten minutes ago, but I highly doubt Healer Hodkinson would appreciate you sprinting down the hallways like a maniac.”
?” Blaise hissed. For someone known for their unrufflable calm, he looked downright furious. “You never told me that.”
The truth was, Yaxley had been right about one thing—the one question that bothered Draco the most was not who Yaxley’s accomplice was. It wasn’t even why Yaxley had done it, why he’d decided to throw his life away for a psychopath, how he could look at the people around him, at muggleborns and muggles and people like Harry, and deem them unworthy of life.
Immediately, Harry’s mind started racing. That made no sense; why would the Order of the Phoenix have anything to do with the maniac currently hell-bent on murdering Harry?
“Ginny,” Harry began carefully. “Ginny, I’ve always loved you and I always will. But…not in the way you want me to. Look, you’re like the little sister I never had—”
can manage to entertain himself for three whole days, then I’m sure you’ll manage for an hour, Pans.”
"I still don’t understand how anyone would want to become a professor," said Seamus from where he was half-splayed across Dean's lap, one hand clasped tightly around his jug of beer, the other around Dean's left hand. "I for one couldn't get out of Hogwarts fast enough. You lot are barmy for wanting to stay."
Draco swallowed an exasperated sigh. “Because getting doused in freezing cold rainwater is part of my pre-bedtime routine. No, Potter, as I already mentioned multiple times, there are
Draco had not reacted fast enough, and it didn’t matter that he hadn’t anticipated the attack, for that particular fact hadn’t mattered in the slightest, not when he’d lain there sprawled across the bathroom floor in a pool of his own blood, able to form only a single coherent thought: He was going to die.
Harry laughed, and then he’d wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck again and they were kissing. And Harry’s wrist still tingled slightly as the black ink of his soulmark settled into his skin forever, forming the one name it had always been meant to form.
Granger huffed a laugh as well, one that was just as grim as Draco’s but still so full of confidence. “The crazy thing is, Draco, I genuinely don’t think he does.”
Pain exploded as his skin was ripped open, and Draco cried out as blood poured through his left shirtsleeve, visible even through the dark fabric. His nerves felt as though on fire, and he had to clamp down on his tongue to keep from whimpering like some pathetic animal. But the agony was horrific, more so than he’d expected, and his eyes promptly started to burn.
But before he could, Nic, smiling at Draco as though they were lifelong friends, said merrily, “No problem. We already finished up.”
He took one look at Draco, who looked utterly miserable, and he knew what he had to do. He needed to talk to the Slytherin, alone, talk and make sure he was okay, that something (inordinately) horrible hadn’t happened in the past few hours.
, and just like that, Harry was frozen to the spot, a simple touch more effective than any Petrificus Totalus known to wizardkind.
. Unchecked recklessness and zero impulse-control were practically in the job description. Yet, now that he’d heard Harry’s reasoning, it made complete and utter sense, and Draco found himself marvelling not for the first nor the last time over how complex Harry Potter’s nature was. He’d realized a long, long time ago the Boy Who Lived was far more than simply a pretty face and shallow representation of his title, yet Draco found himself discovering time and time again how
He hated himself for those words even before he’d finished speaking. But they were already out there, and there was no way to take them back, and it’d felt
“I know we’ve only really been on friendly terms for a week now,” he continued. “But, to be perfectly honest, it seems a lot longer to me. I’m…very thankful we are where we are right now. Not that Yaxley’s actively trying to murder you, of course. But…that we can be friends. I cherish that a lot.”
“Little sister,” Ginny repeated, and the fact that he couldn’t read her expression worried Harry more than her previous harshness or unrepressed anger ever could.
“I doubt that blundering fool knows the difference between Foxglove and Belladonna. Plus, remember, I have orders from Head Auror Robards not to leave Potter’s side—who, I think it’s safe to say after yesterday’s fiasco, obviously needs a capable hand to keep him from flinging himself through death’s door. So, send Healer Hodkinson my sincerest apologies, but duty calls.”
He braced himself for impact, for the Killing Curse and the swift—he hoped it would at least be swift—death it brought with it. But instead, a loud bang sounded as green light crashed into the shop window behind them, resulting in an explosion of glass and noise, the former of which rained down on Draco and Harry like rain in a thunderstorm. Or rather, mostly on Draco. He’d landed on top of Harry, having meant to at least shield the Gryffindor from the curse if all else failed.
“Yes?” Potter asked, and Draco gritted his teeth. The man could be the most oblivious little git on the planet, but of course the instant Draco faltered even for a second, he immediately took notice.
But then Draco made a muffled sound at his side, and Harry focused his attention back on the blond, who was…bloody hell, was he
But Philomena only narrowed her eyes further and snapped before the mountain of a man could finish, “No. Out. I may have received the letter your Head Auror sent, but I never once implied I had agreed to his requests. My customers enjoy unconditional anonymity, and I will not sacrifice that just because a bunch of self-important Aurors wish for me to lighten their workload.”
When the room had quieted down again to some degree, it was Weasley’s incensed voice that thundered through the room. “You can’t
“But I didn’t. Whoever did this, they didn’t succeed.” His gaze flitted to Malfoy, who still stood by the door, as still and as tense as a statue, grey eyes fixed on Harry. “Malfoy found me, and Apparated me here before anything bad could happen. So, really, there’s no need to get worked up about it, Mione.”
living with Draco and holding his hand and kissing him—it didn’t sit well with Harry, to put it mildly.
Harry sat up, too, his own wand in hand, and they both went very still, waiting. But then there was another knock, accompanied by a voice, muffled through the wood but still very much familiar.
But there was no need, for Draco simply sighed and said, “Okay, yes, Weasley, you made your point. I was awful to you—there, I admit it. Granted, you were equally awful to me and
the idea of someone else being there for Draco throughout it all, throughout life, watching their children grow up and then ultimately growing old together.
He’d known this would come up eventually. It was the responsible, healthy thing to do, to let it all hang out and put the truth first, always.
But neither Hermione nor Ron asked for any further details, bless them, instead simply looking sympathetic. “To be honest, I wasn’t sold on the idea of Malfoy watching over you at first,” Ron said, and had it not been for the sombre atmosphere, Harry would have snorted aloud at that slight little understatement. Ron looked over at where Draco still slept peacefully, a thoughtful look on his face. “But if he hadn’t been there… You’re lucky, Harry. Really damn lucky.”
Instead, Harry was rather certain that was warmth in the Slytherin’s gaze. And a gentleness he’d only gotten to see a handful of times, when Draco was laughing and smiling and at his most vulnerable.
. That’s something I would have never said about the smarmy little git I met back in First Year.” He shrugged. “Sure, you’ve made mistakes in the past, but who hasn’t? The point is, you’ve long since recognised them as such and have made damn sure to atone for them. You asked me earlier whether I think you’ve changed. The answer is, yes, of course you have. And now that I know you—the
“—you’d be home by six. Yes, yes, I heard you the first time,” Pansy quipped, smoothing out her black bob as she studied her reflection in the mirror, eyes narrowed critically.
Well, not any longer. There would be no more missing out, and no more ‘supposed to’s, because now Harry was determined, he was focused, he was
Draco’s forehead furrowed, and he set down his cup of Darjeeling. “You know exactly why, Potter. Because you’re their Saviour. They adore you.” He’d meant for it to sound derogatory, but the words came out with no real harshness to them at all.
“I don’t know how you sidestepped rotting in Azkaban for the rest of your life,” the man spat, “but that doesn’t make you innocent, not by a long shot. You’re just as much a pureblood fanatic as the rest of them, and equally to blame.”
And so, when said figure suddenly came to an abrupt stop, paused for a second and then whirled around to face Harry, wand drawn and pointed directly at his face—well, at least Harry didn’t miss the moment his wand was wrenched out of his hand and flung across the alleyway.
Except as the seconds stretched longer and longer, as the silence expanded and strained, Harry found his gaze inching back downwards, found his eyes practically drawn to Draco’s, like a magnet. Two silver, irritatingly captivating magnets.
Draco awoke smiling, and he got up and out of bed without missing a beat, and he pulled on his clothes humming a French lullaby his mother had always sung to him as a child.
All the while, Malfoy had stood a few steps behind Harry, arms crossed, an amused little twinkle in his grey eyes as he’d silently watched Harry be bombarded. Harry had glared at him in response. However, said glare held strong for the totality of about two seconds, before it dissolved at the grin Malfoy shot back.
She didn’t reply for a few seconds. Then, however, she gave a little huff and said, “Enough. More than enough.”
be. Sprinting down a St. Mungo’s hallway, hand-in-hand, all the while grinning like loons…well, it was completely unsophisticated, wasn’t it? A pureblood such as himself shouldn’t be caught dead doing something so unrefined. He had no doubt his ancestors were rolling in their graves.
Plenty of people—who had far less business knowing Potter’s birthday than Draco did, mind you—knew tomorrow was the day the Saviour turned twenty. Every media outlet in wizarding Britain had been endlessly gushing about it for weeks now, how tomorrow the first letter of Harry Potter’s soulmate would appear on his wrist. If Draco cared at all about the git, which he
Harry nodded along to her words. “Sounds brill. And I’m sure you’ll get Molly to agree eventually. It’s your wedding, after all.”
! But since you so clearly don’t have any intention of hearing me out, since you obviously care more about
The other man’s eyes narrowed ever so slightly, but all he said was, tone deceptively even, “Of course,
For the millionth time since he’d taken a seat in the less-than-comfortable chair by the door of the hospital room, his gaze drifted towards the bed, where the silver blond head of Draco Malfoy peeked out of the covers. Harry knew he likely should have taken Healer Hodkinson up on his offer to get some sleep in a hospital bed of his own. Merlin knew he was exhausted enough. But then he’d taken one look at Draco, paler than he’d ever seen him, left arm covered in thick bandages, eyes closed and looking so peaceful Harry felt a pang of dread every time he looked at the blond—and instead of climbing into a soft, comfortable bed of his own, he’d plopped down on the rock-hard chair by the door, blinked back his fatigue, and waited for Draco to wake.
Both his and Nic’s eyes shifted to where Draco still sat, straight-backed and glaring. A glare that only intensified under the combined weight of their stares. But at least he didn’t say anything cruel, instead simply narrowing his eyes and tapering his lips and huffing contemptuously.
“Then all the better,” answered Blaise staunchly, his determination not wavering in the slightest under Draco’s incredulous glare. “No, I’m serious, Draco, this is getting ridiculous. You could not be more obviously in love with him, to the point that, were this not Harry Potter we’re talking about, I’d call it impossible he hasn’t noticed anything yet.”
But Harry only shrugged again. “So you’ll have an easier time beating me. All you have to do is use that Slytherin cunning of yours, and voila, you win. Imagine having bragging rights that you beat Harry Potter in a duel.”
They were the first words Nic spoke to him, and the other man’s voice sounded incredibly different all of a sudden, so much so Harry stopped speaking immediately, stunned into silence. Nic’s voice was as hard and cold as his eyes, and it was such a stark change from his usual warmth that Harry was left gaping.
the work was without Harry’s added help. But Harry hardly listened. He felt someone’s gaze on him and turned, only to find Hermione watching him, apparently not listening to her fiancé either, that same thoughtful look back in her eyes.
Jennings shifted awkwardly. “I just thought I should come over to say good job. You did us all a service today, going after Yaxley like that. Truth is, Malfoy, I may have misjudged you. When Robards gave you of all people the task to monitor Potter, I’ll admit I didn’t think you’d be the best fit for the job. Lots of us did. But after today, you proved you’re not, well…”
Hermione made a sound halfway between a buff of laughter and a grunt, but the rest of them knew better than to comment on it. Another long tirade about how inept Professor Trelawney was as an educator was not something Harry wanted for his twentieth birthday.
Draco had already opened his mouth to interrupt, but all words evaporated into thin air at that last sentence, and instead he felt himself flush crimson red. He shut his mouth and did his best to regain some semblance of composure, but judging by Blaise’s humongous grin, the effectiveness of his attempt still left much to be desired.
Mind you, Harry loved his friends. Harry had missed his friends. Harry had been looking forward to seeing them again for ages now. But Harry also
.” Draco looked both extraordinarily exasperated and uncomfortable at the same time. “Once both parties accept the soulmate-bond and enter into courtship, it’s more or less a no-going-back type of situation. Not that many soulmates would actually
to be at one of said tea parties; not only were Yanmei Parkinson’s soirees never dull, Draco also strongly doubted his insides would feel like a bundle of writhing flobberworms right now if sat across Pansy’s mum instead of a certain green-eyed Gryffindor.)
Both Jennings and his partner were frowning at their surroundings, and while they admittedly—and commendably—did not let much of their unease show, neither quite managed to hide it completely. Potter, however, seemed downright giddy as he glanced around the shop, as though too eager to possibly even entertain the notion of being intimidated for once in his sodding life. And Draco wasn’t even exasperated anymore; the whole thing was just so very
Draco sat in what he’d come to think of as his armchair, watching the Gryffindors chat, Harry nodding and gesticulating enthusiastically with his hands while Granger in turn looked at him, dubious, Brown and Patil all the while laughing, and Weasley snorting into what Draco was rather certain must be the redhead’s fifth or sixth piece of cake. Oddly, Draco didn’t mind. At least his baking was being appreciated for once; at home, his mother would always smile at Draco’s newest, stress-borne creation, congratulate him on a job well don, and then covertly have some house elf Apparate it to a family friend of sorts. Draco didn’t take offense—he usually didn’t bake to eat anyway. Plus, although he liked claiming otherwise whenever Pansy was around, one didn’t maintain a figure like his by eating cake all day every day.
For the first time, Harry saw plain shock flash across Draco’s ivory features, accompanied by a pang of panic that made Harry’s gut twist.
“It’s different,” Draco found himself snapping, suddenly all too aware of the fact that his soulmark was
Secondly, with his gaze still solely focused on Draco, that automatic step backwards turned into an automatic
The redhead blinked, and Harry could tell there would be a lot of explaining and recapping in his imminent future—but now, now he had to get to Ministry first.
Nic chuckled and batted a dismissive hand. “Oh, I don’t mind. A bit of excitement now and then keeps us all young. Honestly, I’m just glad everything ended well. For a moment there, we were all really worried.” He cleared his throat and his grin widened, something Draco hadn’t thought possible. “So, what are you doing here?”
However, first and foremost, Draco had ruined his date, so he shoved all thoughts that weren’t how much he wanted to wring the blond’s skinny, maddeningly long neck out and away.
Pansy pouted, splaying her bloodred-lacquered fingers across her heart. “Why, Draco, you wound me. And here I thought we were friends.” She glanced at Blaise. “Clearly, we’ve been replaced. And by a
And when the conversation started up again, Draco let himself partake in it, let himself laugh and joke and grin with his friends, let himself enjoy just being with them, being with
“Yeah, well it did take nearly two weeks of badgering,” Harry muttered. He had also spent a good part of the last fortnight leaving pamphlets on the importance of nesting omegas outside the door to her office. “Besides, no one’s going to bother him. He’ll take the Morgana Suite and be able to have some privacy. Plus, this way I can siphon off my magic for the baby without having to keep traipsing up to the Hospital Wing every Thursday.”
“Shit, yes Draco,” Harry groaned, “you’re the best omega, look how good you are, letting your alpha milk your tits for you. I’m so prou-“
“Okay,” Harry nodded slowly, his heart starting to slow down again. “So have you broken up with Dean then?”
Harry knew he would be welcome to keep staying at Padfoot’s, especially as it was empty for so much of the year whilst his godfathers travelled, but he also felt like he wanted to branch out on his own.
Draco wondered if his mother was still alive whether she would have taught him? He tried to imagine the kinds of opulent nests that Narcissa Malfoy would have deemed worthy for her own pregnancy with him. He really hoped there had been turrets, maybe a duvet drawbridge.
“Bit harsh Hermione,” Harry sighed before reaching out to squeeze Draco’s shoulder. “She’s right though, you do need to eat something. I’m really fucking sorry about the soup, I didn’t realise I’d done that.”
“And someone who understands and appreciates my purity,” Damien concluded. “I think omegas who jump into bed with every alpha they see are just the worst aren’t they?”
“Did you fight a lot?” Draco asked, still trying to paint a better informed picture of the men he was soon to meet.
“Okay,” Draco smiled happily as he watched Harry hurry out from the hall, jogging after Seamus. Draco vanished his plate before gathering his bag and heading for the main staircase.
“I think I m-might like to be called Papa,” Draco told them shyly. He fixed Harry with an earnest expression. ‘You could be Daddy?”
After finding out Draco was pregnant, Olive had excitedly started showing them her maternity line which was just as delightful as the rest of her designs. Draco had always imagined maternity wear would be rather frumpy and utilitarian.
“You’re not angry at us are you?” Remus asked as Harry helped him fold away laundry. Draco was taking an afternoon nap whilst Sirius had popped out for takeaway.
A wide set, brunet man appeared as Harry quickly stepped in front of Draco and found himself letting out a warning growl.
Harry might have actually bought it if Damien’s scent wasn’t still broadcasting complete satisfied confidence.
“Nettlebed’s,” Draco swallowed tightly, “It’s on Tadpole Lane, a few streets over from Diagon Alley.”
Eventually, Harry seated fully inside Draco, his wiry hair pressing against the sensitive skin of Draco’s buttocks.
“Draco,” Harry repeated, a little louder this time as the younger boy fell silent. “You’re misunderstanding me. I don’t want to bring home a mate because I’d like to mate with
“I – I love it,” Draco sniffed loudly as Harry summoned a handkerchief and passed it to the still weeping omega. Draco blew his nose before tilting his tear stained face up at Harry.
“What’s the last thing you remember?” Harry asked kindly. Draco noticed that the alpha was looking rather haggard, with dark purple bruises under his eyes and his skin somewhat washed out.
Harry sat on the stone bench by the herb gardens, watching as May-bugs flocked to a nearby patch of wild cow parsley. The white frothy heads of the weeds were bowing under the collective weight of the surge of spring insects.
“Draco,” Harry said calmly, walking over and crouching down in front of the omega. “Talk to me, what about it is making you unhappy?”
“Mm hm,” Draco nodded, not trusting himself to speak as he tried to process what Harry had been saying right before Seamus interrupted.
Draco’s mouth fell open as he began to moan loudly, Harry cock slipping past his sticky lips and batting against his chin.
Of course, it was irresponsible to try out a new spell on himself, but Draco had had enough. After years of being touch starved and excluded, Draco couldn’t bear it anymore. If a spell was what it took to suddenly bring him friends, then so be it.
Strong hands gripped Draco’s shoulders as Ronald Weasley hoisted him up. Draco whimpered in pain as he clutched at Ron’s chest, pressing his face into the older man’s robes, which still carried faint traces of Harry’s scent.
Wow, thank you so much for all your kind encouragement and support, now watch as I instinctively respond with self-sabotage and drive this fic into the ground.
About five minutes later, Olive joined them again, rolling her eyes and muttering about Mothers of the Bride wanting last minute alterations.
Harry carefully ran his hand down Draco’s front, cleaning up the come splatters wandlessly. His wand was too far away on the bedside table and Harry hadn’t wanted to risk moving for it whilst still tied to the omega.
Harry was quite excited about that feature himself actually. The shared Gaedere kitchen was more often than not left in a pretty poor state, so whilst Harry enjoyed cooking he didn’t really have anywhere to do it.
Harry took the opportunity to mouth at Draco’s dominant scent gland, scraping the skin with blunt teeth.
and spoke at length on what a shame it was,” Bellatrix eyes went slightly misty as she probably envisioned the grand plans she had had for Draco’s future. “Apparently though, he could be persuaded to overlook your little slipup. Turns out he really was quite taken with you that Beltane – you remind him of his first wife.”
“Would you like a wet wipe Mr. Potter?” Madam Pomfrey asked without looking at him. “Or maybe a cleaning charm? I can assure you you’ll become quite adept at them once the baby comes.”
“Um,” Harry glanced down the gangway. He really didn’t want to leave Draco alone for too long and Damien was an unmated omega. Then again, other than Draco, most people didn’t hold
Other omegas would constantly touch each other for comfort and security. Friends would cuddle together and gossip about alphas whilst Draco was left, ostracised on the outskirts looking in. Severus had never quite appreciated the level of the other students’ apathy towards Draco or perhaps he simply didn’t know how to help. In the first few years the distain had been acted out physically with stuck out legs to trip Draco up or sharp elbows to his ribs in the quidditch changing rooms.
“Oh Harry this was lovely!” Luna declared, coming to sit beside them and collapsing into a free deck chair. She fanned herself as she beamed over at them, “Happy Birthday Draco, I do like that dress you’re wearing, it’s such a shame it’s spoiled now.”
“Why don’t you come in Draco?” Hermione asked kindly. “We’ll arrange for the house elves to bring you some food here seeing as you missed lunch.”
“Alpha,” Draco whispered as Harry snapped into action, striding across to the bed, his pupils large and inky.
“I had no idea there were that many omegas in Slytherin house,” Harry shot Hermione a questioning look as she shrugged back, evidently not having known either.
“Sour, pickled ginger caramel?” the lady grinned, throwing a wink at Harry. “I’m not sure those would sell all that well on a confectionary trolley love, I reckon you’re having a craving aren’t you?”
“Can I c-call you the other thing as well?” Draco asked tentatively, his blossom pink tongue darting out to wet his stretched lips.
“So if I remember correctly,” Harry said, turning them off of the main alley and onto a pleasant tree lined avenue, “Percy Weasley’s sister-in-law runs a shop that should be ah!” Harry drew them to a stop outside of a wooden painted store front, “Right here!”
“You were at a nightclub?” Draco asked curiously, he had heard some of Harry’s peers talking about where they were going and laughing about the sort of hijinks that would probably occur.
Dean shrugged as he quickly trotted after the Weasleys, leaving Hermione, Harry and Draco to make their way down the path. They eventually came out to a small, circular grove with a small fountain. The fountain itself was a stone sculpture in the shape of a Christmas stocking with water bubbling out from the top of it. Sure enough, small clove-studded oranges were floating in the pool, along with paper sailing boats.
“You look nice,” Harry said, giving Draco a questioning smile and hoping they could put the moment behind them.
Harry hadn’t even considered this, it hadn’t even crossed his mind as he had put the quill to paper. Whilst another omega might have used the pregnancy to get something out of Harry, it had become quickly evident that that was not Draco’s intent. So Harry hadn’t for one moment contemplated that Draco might actually
“T-Thank you for having me in your home,” Draco spoke up, trying to make his voice as stable as possible as he drew out the two bottles of wine and proffered them to Remus.
Draco flushed and hid his grin in his bouquet, which was composed of delicate summer flowers such as sweetpeas, lisianthus and freesias. Snape still managed to send a piercing glare as Harry heard Ron gulp from somewhere behind him.
At first, Draco thought it wasn’t working, but then the trees seemed to bow, their frosted tips sprinkling him with snow before they slid apart from each other and revealed a wide, open gap to a new path.
Draco folded in on himself slightly as the group’s eyes widened upon seeing Harry’s hand, still resting on the back of Draco’s neck.
“Oh,” Draco’s eyes widened and his mouth formed a circle of surprise as he wiggled his hips and realised that Harry was still inside him.
“Potions Master?” Snape raised his eyebrows, “I don’t think an omega has ever held that official title before.”
“Shit,” Harry swore as the omega’s eyes fluttered closed again. Harry was bent over the side of the bath at an awkward angle, trying to make sure Draco didn’t slide down. At the same time he managed to shuck off his shirt and jeans, sniffing himself to see if any of the scent causing Draco distress was still lingering on his skin. There was, unfortunately, the very faint but present hint of almonds. Harry huffed frustratedly - he hadn’t even
“I’m so excited for Christmas,” Damien told Harry excitedly, “our family friends the Bachmanns are coming to stay. Do you know the Bachmann family?” Damien asked, looking a little hopeful.
“No, no! Mr. Caulfield, I said not up there - I’ve got an omega in the changing rooms, goodness gracious!” Olive materialized at the top of the stairs looking flustered.
“Why are you both bickering when you should be working?” Weasley interjected loudly. “If you can’t resist squabbling, then do it
When he voiced this to Potter, the other wizard turned away, his shoulders tense. “Since Andromeda was cut off, any of her descendants never appeared on the family tree either.”
It was Hugo who snapped her out of her stupor when he gave a delighted squeal from his place atop Draco’s head. Teddy was seated right behind him and he’d known the toddler had no danger of falling off and getting hurt so he’d allowed him to remain where he was.
“Hey!” Potter sounded affronted for some reason. “I think she just wanted you to carry her. She seems to be rather…fond of you.” he ground out as if he was in pain.
His new companion sniffed again and rubbed a small hand across his eyes. “Lily fell in a hole.” he announced gravely.
Potter smiled and leant back in his armchair. “I love a good story, and we can both admit that I’m going to lose this game anyways. Might as well stop now.”
The rest of the players were quickly split up. Ginny was playing Chaser for her team alongside George, and she’d put Charlie as Keeper. On the other side, Bill and Granger were Chasers and Weasley (Draco really could not call him Ron) was Keeper.
He found himself smiling now at the earnestness with which the children went about their work. They seemed to sincerely believe that they were doing this to cheer Draco up. Lily and Hugo had toddled over to Teddy and he was pointing out the pictures in the book that Draco had gifted him. As Draco had predicted, Teddy loved the book and now it kept the little ones distracted and out of the way of the others.
“Actually, he’s not busy,” Draco interjected, making a quick decision and rising from his seat. “I’m leaving anyways.”
“I know I was pairing you up with him before,” his mother admitted with an unashamed shrug. “But it was more of a half-hearted attempt then. I didn’t
“Well, he was more a man, really,” Draco offered up hesitantly, deliberating over just how much he was willing to divulge. Potter’s eyes were wide and he watched Draco with rapt attention, the carousel momentarily forgotten. “It was the summer after Fifth year. I was in a snit with Lucius off in prison so Blaise decided to kidnap me and take me for an impromptu trip to the Mediterranean.”
They were level now; arms outstretched, sides pressed firmly against each other, shoulder to hip. The Snitch was so close now and Draco knew that success or failure lay in the next crucial few minutes. He desperately flattened himself against his broom, his back screaming in protest as he managed to stretch himself out even more, but to no avail. He watched, as if the world had slowed down, as Potter’s hand began to edge ahead of his own, and in a last-ditch attempt, Draco decided he was done playing it safe.
“How kind of you, Weasley,” Draco replied dryly. “But actually, I do have something to do afterwards.”
“What’s wrong with Malfoy?” Weasley joined them and placed a steady hand on Draco’s arm. “You look like you’re about to pass out.”
Draco eyed the hand for a moment and then lifted his gaze to Potter’s face with a raised brow. Potter withdrew almost immediately, snatching his hand back with mortification colouring his face. Draco slowly smoothed out the wrinkles Potter had left and wondered what the fuck he was playing at.
Potter sighed. “Come to Dada, Lily. Draco has to go home now.” It was odd hearing Potter use his given name. Odd, but not necessarily bad.
“It’s at least preferable to James’ thankfully short-term use of ‘pops’.” Draco said with a shudder at the memory.
When they reached the foyer Draco suddenly wondered where his mother was. He couldn’t seem to hear her about and was considering summoning a house elf to fetch her when Luna spoke up.
Mirage-Pansy stalked up to Draco and whipped out her wand, flicking it at him with a sharp smile. “Perhaps this will reassure you of our authenticity.”
“I hope you like beef stew.” He emerged with some bowls and cutlery and placed these on the table. “I have firewhisky too if you want, or I think I may have some red wine stashed away somewhere.”
He supposed that all things considered, he could have done far worse in the way of owls. He wouldn’t have intentionally selected such a small one, but at least it appeared to be smart and hadn’t cost him a Knut. And if it got his mother off his back for a while, well then, all the better.
Draco exited the bathroom and headed towards Lily’s room, remembering it to be at the end of the hall. Potter had given him a quick tour of the house just before dinner. Draco had been there once as a child but he’d hardly recognized it to be the dank, gloomy Grimmauld Place he known before. Potter had done a wonderful job remodelling and Draco was hoping he could get an invitation for his mother to come see it too.
They smiled back and shared a look that spoke of things that Draco could only wish for. He swallowed, throat suddenly tight and eyes smarting. He truly was happy for them but he couldn’t help feeling a little disheartened. They’d been of equal standing before, the three of them against all odds, but now Draco was the one on the outside. He was on his own and the person who made him less lonely couldn’t be his.
As Potter began to play with the toy, jubilantly exclaiming over it, Draco listened with half an ear, his heart racing.
Draco contemplated his next topic for a second and when it came to him, he almost gave a maniacal laugh. “Cho Chang.”
To Draco’s surprise, he’d inadvertently started walking back to the Leaky as they talked, and here was Potter, complacently strolling beside him without a care in the world. Draco almost opened his mouth to remind him that cosy little chats weren’t something they did, but he stopped himself as he realised that he was actually
“We could tell them to fuck off and then run away to Romania until they find something better to report about.”
“Oh, I like that!” Potter shot to his feet, wiping pie off his face with an impatient swipe of his hand. “Who was the one kissing me back, huh? Clinging to me so hard I probably have the finger marks to prove it. Moaning and whimpering and practically
A loud, excited hoot rang through the room as he got into bed, and he couldn’t help a smile when Mercury dove in through the open window and crashed spectacularly onto his coverlet.
Narcissa was waiting for him near the stairs and she smiled as he approached, holding up her new book.
Draco wasn’t sure how to respond to this. He’d never heard someone accept the title as if it were something to be proud of. Although… the Weasleys probably
After that, the tension dissipated. It was as if a dam had burst free and there were no more restrictions to what they could speak about. Draco was rapidly getting to know Potter in a way he’d never dreamed of before, and he willingly offered parts of himself in return.
Draco grimaced. “I’d rather have my wand shoved up my nose than read her dribble. I honestly don’t see why Mother finds her books so appealing. Load of rubbish with too many adjectives and an unhealthy amount of fit chimney sweeps if you ask me.”
Draco considered this. It was hard to imagine simple, wholesome Molly Weasley getting along with sophisticated Narcissa Malfoy, but he supposed stranger things had happened. And if it meant his mother had a new friend who would stick by her – for he knew Molly Weasley to be as loyal as they came – well all the better then.
“Merlin’s saggy left tit, I can just see you pelting those peacocks with this righteous expression on your pointy little face!”
He left the room and Draco rubbed his hands over his face with a sigh. He needed to get a grip, for heaven’s sake! As his mother liked to say, there was nothing to be gained by unravelling like a badly knitted shawl at the slightest pull.
not ten seconds after having first appeared. Six months later, on his own twentieth birthday, Ron had acquired a matching
So, he’d made a decision. After all, it was high time he took matters into his own hands. Even though Draco had fought against Voldemort in that final battle, it still did not accost for everything that had been done. That
When a few more seconds passed and still no answer came, no sound or response of any kind, Harry chanced a glance up into the other man’s face.
But, as he’d said oftentimes before, someone up there really did have it out for him. And so, while he followed Potter into the kitchen, watching under a furrowed brow as the Gryffindor started loading their dirty dishes into some ghastly muggle contraption he’d called a ‘dishwasher’, Draco’s luck shrivelled up.
There may not have been any need, but that didn’t stop Draco from worrying, not at all. And, it seemed, neither did it Potter’s friends. Yet, by some miracle, none of them said anything further, and even Weasley merely pulled a face before plopping down on the chair beside Granger’s, her hand clasped tightly in his own. Draco caught a glimpse of the name stamped on Weasley’s freckled wrist, and, with some disgust but absolutely zero surprise, found said name to be
Harry was too excited to be annoyed by the Slytherin’s haughty tone. “Who sleeps at one in the afternoon, Malfoy? Besides, you obviously weren’t. And this is important.
Harry raised an eyebrow, delighted to finally see their roles reversed, with Draco the embarrassed one while Harry watched, arms crossed and amused. “We’d lived in the same castle for six years, Draco, you can’t honestly claim you ‘hardly knew me’. Are you sure that’s why you didn’t want any? Not because, oh, I don’t know, you were a snobbish, stuck-up, self-important twat who refused muggle food on principle?”
“Yes, yes, alright, you win, Potter. My sincerest apologies for being a snobbish, stuck-up, self-important twat.” He shot Harry a half-hearted glare. “Happy now?”
When he strolled back into the living room, silently munching on his beignet, his gaze instinctively drifted to Draco. Draco, who was already staring at him, grey eyes unreadable as they drilled into the half-eaten beignet lifted midway to Harry’s mouth.
And in his hesitation, he could only stand there, startled, as the seemingly unconscious man leapt up and lunged at Draco. And as he collided with the cobbled stone below, the air knocked out of his lungs, his head roaring in protest as pain exploded at the back of his skull, all Draco could think was that he had, once again, reacted too slowly.
But even though silence once again descended upon the two friends, the awkwardness from before was gone, vanished in a puff of smoke as though it had never existed in the first place.
Much like Blaise, Pansy appeared to be of the opinion she had every right to stick that pert little nose of hers into Draco’s personal business. Her disgusting grin said it all.
He needn’t have worried however, because at that moment Draco himself seemed to realise what exactly he was doing—staring at Harry Potter with
“Salazar,” the blond said, and gave a mirthless little laugh, all the while still staring down at Harry as though he might disappear if he so much as blinked.
“You can’t tell me what to do,” replied Ginny coolly. “I don’t know what you did to make Harry tolerate you, but it’s not going to fool me,
, with his usually-so-messy head of curls flattened against his head, retaining not a hint of their usual bounciness, and his green eyes especially radiant under the ghostly silver light of the moon. He had absolutely no
The poisoning on his birthday; Draco being assigned as his protection; the attack in Diagon after their visit to Renaults and Co; Yaxley’s capture and subsequent escape; him openly admitting his accomplice had orchestrated the Azkaban breakout almost five months ago; Yaxley breaking into Robards’ office and injuring the Head Auror; Draco going after him; Yaxley’s accomplice murdering him in cold blood, only to slice up Harry as well.
. Harry couldn’t claim he knew Pansy Parkinson well, but on the various occasions he had interacted with her in the past, he’d gotten the distinct impression Pansy just generally did whatever the fuck Pansy wanted to do, and fuck you. Plus, it was barely eleven, so either Draco had been grossly misinformed, or it was someone else entirely.
Pansy grinned mischievously. “What can I say? I’m just too good at this.” But then her eyes found Draco’s through the mirror, and that grin turned into a concerned frown. “How are you holding up, by the way? You know, what with tomorrow being you-know-who’s birthday.”
the ones made for each other. Pen and I are great as friends, but nothing more. And we’re both fine with that. You see, a soulmark isn’t destiny—it’s a possibility, a choice. Sure, usually it works out. But sometimes it doesn’t, and that’s okay, too. It’s only as big a deal as you make it.”
First of all, I'd like to say I'm sorry. Both to you my lovely readers, and to my baby Draco, because.
Another moment of tense silence ticked by, and Draco stayed completely motionless under Yaxley’s grip. Yet his eyes, his eyes he allowed stray towards Harry. And when he found one pair of emerald eyes staring back, filled with so many contrasting emotions, from hatred to anger to actual fear, so natural and raw it made Draco’s chest tighten, he actually forgot for a moment the deathly fear gripping his heart at the still dangerously high prospects of being murdered by his former colleague.
Vindictive was not an adjective Harry ever wanted ascribed to his name. So, he forgave and, most of the time, he forgot.
Plus, ever since he'd moved out of Privet Drive, birthdays equaled parties which equaled get-togethers, and Harry hadn't seen everyone in so long that that something worth celebrating all in itself.
Harry’s heart actually missed a beat as a wave of such immense dread crashed over him that his head began to spin.
How? How could she possibly know, when so far only Hermione, Ron, Pansy, Blaise and Narcissa had been told? And Nic, but Harry doubted Ginny and he were friends. Ron and Hermione wouldn’t have told her, not without asking Harry for permission first, not without
He could have asked Robards to send him an owl or, if the situation truly necessitated face-to-face communication, Floo him. But instead Draco had gone to the Ministry and left Harry alone.
to find out what this mysterious reason was was decidedly worse—for there was no doubt in Draco’s mind he’d be stressing over it the whole entire day, stressing and wondering whether this would be the last day before he was kicked off the case and reassigned, the last day spent in this chaotic, atrociously red apartment he’d only just started calling home, the last day he’d have with the idiotic, foolish, ridiculous, perfect man who it seemed was now his boyfriend.
“He’s a muggle, right?” Harry said, silently proud of himself he’d remembered that much. Honestly, Hermione was right; his memory was almost as terrible as his eyesight.
Harry quickly blinked and looked away, his olive skin doing little to hide his blush. “Nothing. You didn’t have to order that, you know. I just personally don’t like not having complete control over myself. But if you wanted something stronger, you really should have gotten it—”
Until Ron, from where he still stood at Harry’s bedside, one arm wrapped protectively around the hunched form of his girlfriend, said, eyes steely, “I’ll do it. Harry, you’re my best mate, but Robards is right. Someone needs to be there to make sure what happened yesterday never happens again.” His gaze lifted to Robards and he repeated, determination hardening his usually so playful features, “I’ll do it.”
Again, Harry could sympathize with that. There’d been a time after Sirius’ death, a few weeks, maybe a few months, when the mere mention of his godfather’s name had triggered such an intense, white-hot surge of
He immediately wanted to kick himself, especially when Draco asked, “I beg your pardon?” He sounded affronted, too, and Harry briefly feared he’d just completely ruined their moment. Except there was still that little dazed smile playing across Draco’s vividly pink lips, and he chuckled slightly as he said, “What about
He wanted to relish in the feeling of being like this. Being together, being happy. Almoat carefree.
When hit with Sectumsempra in Sixth Year, Draco had reacted too slowly. Sometimes, when the nights were particularly bad and sleep proved especially impossible, he’d lay awake thinking about that day in the bathroom. The white flash speeding towards him; the indescribable agony ripping through his very core, worse than any pain he’d ever experienced before or since the incident, Voldemort’s occasional Crucio sessions included; and the sight of Harry Potter before Draco’s vision went black, standing there, wide-eyed and white as Draco’s shirt had been before it soaked crimson, his wand still raised in dazed horror.
“Oh, sod right off,” Harry grumbled petulantly. Only he still hadn’t made any efforts to shake free of Draco’s loose embrace, so the latter didn’t fret much. “You’re evil, you know that?
But before he could finish, Hermione shot him a warning look over her shoulder. He stopped midsentence and frowned but, in a rare moment of wisdom, immediately closed his mouth again with nothing but a small, petulant huff.
Draco scoffed. “This coming from Harry sodding Potter. If I’m a menace, you’re a bloody pest.” But the next time Harry looked up again—furtively and through the corner of his eye, so Draco wouldn’t notice—there was a soft grin playing across the Slytherin’s face as he looked down into his mug.
“Are you nearly done?” he called. “I promised Mother I’d be back by six, and it’s almost seven already.”
Ginny’s sobs stopped for a moment, and she looked up at him. But instead of the desperation Harry had glimpsed in those first few seconds before she’d bodily thrown herself at him, there was something much harder there now, something borderline…angry.
Only they had. And the healers had already told Harry in no uncertain terms that, had he Apparated Draco to St. Mungo’s even a few minutes later, the Slytherin likely would not have survived until morning.
“‘Corban Yaxley: The complete story behind his escape from Azkaban, attempted assassination of War-Hero and Saviour Harry Potter, and eventual murder’,” Pansy read aloud, then looked back up immediately, smirk gone.
,” Pansy cooed into her coffee with a snort, smirk positively Cheshire, but both Draco and Harry ignored her.
Draco, too, blinked, and just like that his shock morphed into blatant mortification, only to vanish again a second later as he schooled his features back into composure. “Yes, I…of course.” He scrambled off Harry so fast one might think Harry had some contagious disease. The way the blond very determinedly would not look anywhere near him when Harry stood as well only served to further underline that theory.
Ginny looked up, brown eyes wide and rimmed with red, and one moment they were standing a few feet apart, Ginny in front of the door, Harry in the doorway, and the next she’d flung herself into his arms, sobbing as she buried her face into his chest.
The fact that, even when angry at Draco, Harry would still offer to listen, to give comfort should Draco need it…it made the twisting in his chest worse, somehow, and it was all he could do to keep from crumbling to the floor then and there.
Draco was silent for a few long seconds, and Harry’s heart raced and pounded and stumbled over its own beat, and he wondered dimly when he’d become so absolutely
Draco’s gaze travelled around the room. From his vantage point behind the desk, he could only see half of the office, with the door located on the exact opposite side of the room. And with Yaxley currently situated in the middle, that was one exit eliminated.
Harry crossed his arms and leaned against the fridge, eyeing the blond sitting across the kitchen counter with unconcealed amusement. “Hate to be the one to break it to you, Malfoy, but it’s a fact. You see, I have an
“Alright. Fine. I understand, and I won’t pester you any further. You need to do what’s best for you, and only you know what that is. If you think now’s not the time to tell him, then don’t, easy as that. But—Draco.” Blaise’s eyes shined like polished onyx. “Please please
He’d done very well indeed the past few years avoiding Potter, even though they both worked as Aurors in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and their paths were bound to cross every once in a while. He’d done so, so well to keep his head down and only ever give a stiff nod if their eyes met across the hallway.
When addressed again by Harry, the man’s humongous grin returned again, which he promptly fixed on Harry and said, “Oh, that’s a hard one. I think I like Hufflepuff a lot. They seem like a nice bunch. Plus, their common rooms are down near the kitchen, which means you can always get a midnight snack should the desire arise. Other than that, though, I think Gryffindor would be cool, too. Don’t think I’m smart enough for Ravenclaw, though.”
He glanced around the room, as did Healer Hodkinson. To Blaise, who still stood leaning against the doorframe, arms folded, looking completely calm and in no hurry to leave; to Pansy, legs crossed and shoulders back, who simply watched the Healer under raised brows, nose wrinkled in obvious distaste; to Draco, who may not be clutching Harry’s hand anymore but hadn’t moved an inch from his chair at the side of Harry’s bed, now fixing Healer Hodkinson with the type of glare that promised a slow and painful death.
But Harry didn’t relent, and soon Draco was kissing back, even before his brain could process the sheer ridiculousness of the whole situation—them, snogging, in some random corridor in St. Mungo’s, where anyone could walk by at any second.
him, he’d made that abundantly clear. Harry should’ve known the pureblood part of him would be weirded out, should’ve kept a better grip on himself, on his face, on his emotions, before he went and ruined everything, ruined it like he always did.
His mind went blank, his back went rigid, his breath caught at the back of his throat. No. There was no way Yaxley knew. None at all. No, he was bluffing, had to be, just toying with Draco because he could, because he was a sadist and a bastard and this was, as he’d said, his last hurrah.
Ron looked back up, blue eyes a mixture of scared, sad, apologetic and nervous. Harry could barely process them all at once, especially with all the other hundred questions currently zipping through his head.
Draco’s chest tightened. “He could be bluffing. Maybe there is no accomplice, and Yaxley just said that to create further panic. His last hurrah, as he said.”
Draco inhaled deep in an effort to hold on to his rapidly dwindling composure. “I don’t need nor do I want your congratulations.”
complaining about your décor is bad? Pansy’s set on becoming an actual fashion designer. Forget the murderer, she’d kill you herself for this atrocious array of eyesores.”
For a moment, no one spoke. No one moved, no one so much as breathed, and suddenly all Draco could think was that Harry would still be in the flat if Weasley hadn’t dragged him along into Diagon, if he’d paid closer attention and watched Draco’s boyfriend as he was meant to. Harry would have never encountered Yaxley’s accomplice, and he’d never gotten hurt, and Draco wouldn’t have to worry right now whether he’d even still have a boyfriend by the end of the day.
Finally, Yaxley said, “You really have no idea, do you? You’re done for already.” The man sounded a mixture between amused and hate-filled, and Draco clenched his jaw tighter.
“Just…don’t. Please. You don’t have to tell me, you don’t have to say anything.” He folded both his hands over Draco’s. “It doesn’t matter to me, okay? It
He found his mood instantly brightened, however, by the adorable little smile that now spread its way across Draco’s face, soft and lopsided and clearly not voluntary. It was accompanied by the gentlest of blushes, the sort Harry’s skin hid well, while Draco’s, on the other hand, did not.
In said thorough and all-consuming bewilderment, he said stupidly, “Sorry mate, but you’re definitely still a proper twat at times. And
Except then Harry’s crooked grin widened, and all of a sudden he took a large step forwards. Draco stepped back instinctively, and immediately cursed himself for it. Salazar, they were
"So I can't even see him?" Astoria looks like someone's hit her with a hex. "What absolute rubbish! I'm practically family, if I want to see Draco then they can't stop me."
And yes, Ron was right. In an empty classroom, Draco wanted to seethe, to lash out, be angry, but it had all faded away to be replaced by this everlasting sadness, this guilt and misery.
Malfoy doesn't reply to his mother. He keeps staring at the family portrait. It consists of a far younger Narcissa and Lucius, Harry sees, standing each side of their son. Malfoy looks about ten or eleven and when Malfoy speaks next, he confirms Harry's estimate.
“He kind of was,” George added unhelpfully and Charlie did not look amused. If looks could kill, there’d have been one less Weasley in the world.
“Harry, no, we’ll be late,” Draco laughed breathlessly as Harry ignored his whines and continued to shower his neck with kisses. “Salazar, what is with you and my neck?”
“From what I saw before, you do seem a tad whiter,” Pansy said thoughtfully. “Must be because you insist on living like a Muggle depiction of a vampire.”
Draco scowled at the mess that was still the attic. They were trying to do some cleaning before they began sorting through the items, but it was as if the more dust and cobwebs they cleared away, the more still remained. He glanced over at where Potter was poking around a pile of candlesticks and saw that his denim-clad backside had a patch of dust on it. Draco wanted to laugh but as he was probably in a similar state, decided not to. He’d need a long bath when he got home to wash all the grime away.
Draco was almost tempted to rebuff it, but he was tired from their scuffle and simply fed up in general, so he grudgingly clasped the proffered hand and Potter easily pulled him to stand. He placed Draco’s wand gently back in his hand and then, cautiously eyeing Mercury the whole time, he moved to pick up the blanket and novel too.
“What the hell is wrong with you?” Potter demanded with an irritated scowl, following close behind as Draco stalked into the library.
Draco nodded and followed her down to the ground. He dismounted his broom and winced as his sore muscles made themselves known. He’d need a long hot bath when he got home.
Draco shut his mouth with an audible click. Harry looked like a man possessed and would likely go through with any threats he made now.
Their mouths separated for a moment to gasp in much needed air before crashing together again even more fiercely than before. Draco nibbled on Potter’s lower lip before taking his tongue back into his mouth once more and sucking on it hard. Potter moaned in earnest now and pressed his hips hard against Draco’s. This brought the evidence of his arousal in contact with Draco’s, and the feel of that hard length pressing against his own had Draco breaking away from the kiss to give a ragged moan, his head falling back against the wall with a dull thud.
Draco swept out of the room and returned to the sitting room where everyone had apparently left except for Ginny, Granger, and Weasley. They tried to say something but Draco ignored them and entered the Floo. As he was whisked away, he caught one final glimpse of Potter coming into the room, face ashen.
his mother. It wasn’t right or fair and it reminded Draco that for them, compassion was rare and not to be expected.
There was a beat of silence and when his mother still hadn’t said anything, he finally looked up. He was momentarily rendered dumb when he found her eyes wet with unshed tears.
“So, how have you been?” Draco enquired politely and then wanted to kick himself. Any fool with eyes could tell that Potter wasn’t doing well.
Draco ignored the interruption. “Well, I’d finished my education at Hogwarts and was aimlessly wasting my talents by taking on the life of a recluse. Or at least, that’s what my Mother had said.” He laughed. “Not to say that she was thrilled when I suddenly announced that I’d be moving to France to complete a Potions Mastery. That was a bit of a spur of the moment decision but I’d always loved potions and thought that a career in it wouldn’t be so terrible.”
Draco’s heart hammered in his chest, and he didn’t care he must look like a fool, that he was giving the Death Eater all the confirmation he could possibly need. All he could think was that
Ginny frowned, looking between Ron and Blaise suspiciously, arms still folded tightly. “But we need to know if—”
Draco pulled a face, but, surprisingly, none of the insults Harry had come to expect came flying. Instead, the blond simply sighed. “Nothing. Nothing at all.”
However, eventually (still far too soon, in Harry’s opinion) Draco pulled back again. Harry had expected at least a hint of a smile on his boyfriend’s face—he knew he must certainly be grinning like an idiot.
Once in the building, Draco didn’t slow down, instead pulling Harry up the two flights of stairs separating the ground-floor from the flat with renewed determination, only coming to a stop once the door had fallen shut behind them and they were both safely back in the flat.
Confused, he set the butterknife back on the kitchen counter, absentmindedly wiping the remaining butter off on his piece of bread, and strained his neck to get a glimpse into the living room. What with Hermione, Ron and the rest of his friends having already stopped by on Thursday, plus Pansy Parkinson, he couldn’t think of anyone else who might want to visit him. Draco had grumbled something about how Parkinson might show up again around four to pick them up for what Harry had nicknamed Saturday’s Slytherin Shopping Spree (Draco was, needless to say, not impressed), but, for one, to Harry’s ears that had sounded like a big
Harry could only gape, mind suddenly a racing, reeling storm of thoughts, each more fleeting than the last. “I…
“So, wait, let me get this straight. Not only did you just stand there, watching me very nearly throw out my back, you also purposefully withheld the fact that I could do it all magically?”
Blaise pulled a face. “Yeaaahhh, maybe don’t whack him over the head? That doesn’t exactly scream ‘I’m in love with you’, tell you the truth.”
He remembered his disastrous date with Nic; he remembered Yaxley escaping; he remembered Draco coming to get him; he remembered them kissing for what’d felt like hours; he remembered when he’d accidently called Draco his boyfriend and he remembered when they’d officially started dating; he remembered Hermione and Ron coming over and he remembered how supportive they’d been. And then the next day, Draco had gone to the Ministry to talk to Robards, and then…
The waitress nodded curtly and left to go attend to the next table of customers. Silence fell at their table, and it was only then that Draco realized Harry was staring at him oddly. Or rather, gaping.
to live, the sort that had always seemed so unreachable before but had in the last few days become a real, genuine possibility.
perfectly fine. We don’t need Lucius. We’ll figure it out without him, just like we have everything else.”
Draco shook his head, as though that might rid him of the depressing thoughts that had begun to cloud in. “Anyway, what was that you said yesterday about letting bygones be bygones? Let’s not talk about all that anymore.” He gave a smirk and picked up the newspaper again. “Says here your smile ‘melts a witch’s heart faster than the breath of a Chinese Fireball’. So, a little more of that and a little less of those ridiculous puppy eyes, yeah?”
He didn’t hear Harry enter, likely due to the fact that the rushing of his blood and the drumming of his heart still drowned out all other sound. Were it not for the tell-tale smell of sandalwood and cinnamon and citrus that hadn’t left Draco in peace since their almost-moment in the empty interrogation room the day before, he wouldn’t have noticed the Gryffindor’s arrival at all.
his friends, and some of them (read: most of them) could be a bunch of little shits when they wanted to be.
But he gave himself no time to lament his injuries. Instead, he sprung up, wand already gripped tight and lifted, and bellowed “
His gaze darted to Draco as he uttered that last sentence, and although he was smiling ever so slightly, something in Hayes’ eyes made the Slytherin tense up. Without meaning to, Draco’s right hand gripped Harry’s, who in turn squeezed back immediately.
He shook his head and although his words were still spiked with undeniable dislike, there was no contempt there, no disgust, and the action made a loose strand of silver-blond fall into his eye. And there it was, wasn’t it, the image Harry had envisaged less than half an hour ago. It was just as dazzling, just as flawless…and yet.
“Nothing at all,” said Draco, voice just as delightfully lacklustre as his smile. “I simply said I’m sorry for your loss. That must have been terrible, having to go through that. The death of a family member is unbearable, especially if you were as close as you and your sister undoubtedly were. Anyway, there are no hard feelings, of course. Know that I don’t blame you for acting like a petty, smallminded buffoon, not under the circumstances. It’s all in the past now. Water under the bridge.”
Except now it was obvious, and it made him so happy it was almost impossible not to break out into a colossal grin right then and there. Because Harry—oblivious, quick-tempered, fierce, brilliant, wonderful Harry—truly, genuinely
have to die. It’s nothing personal, of course. I actually quite like you, to be honest. You’re refreshingly straightforward in most everything you do, and trust me when I say, that is not a trait you see very often in figureheads such as yourself. But I’m afraid it’s all part of the plan, so”—he shrugged—“tough luck, I guess.”
mirrored in Draco’s eyes as he studied Harry, sort of like apprehension and fear mixed all up in one.
Nic’s eyes swivelled to Draco and narrowed, and it would have been impossible for anyone, even Potter, to not feel the sudden change in the air, the coldness in the American’s gaze as they took in Draco. But Draco refused to avert his eyes, to back off and admit defeat. If he hadn’t cowered for Philomena Craigs, he certainly would not now.
There was stunned silence for a moment, and Harry only realized then that all his friends were still there, watching their little exchange with wide-open mouths and incredulous eyes.
The notion of being kicked off the case sent a surge of pure dread racing through Draco’s entire body, from his head to his stomach all the way to his toes. He couldn’t get kicked off, not now, not when Harry still
Thankfully, Draco was already continuing, “Does Granger do all the baking, or do you have any idea how to do this?” He shot a sullen look at the cake batter, which, now that Harry had gotten over his initial shock, he realized was for the most part located
“I’m not sure what incredible secret you think you’ve unearthed,” Draco said, keeping his tone fixedly in a bored drawl, refusing to let any unease or panic show, “but if I were you, I’d concentrate on my own problems and keep my nose out of other people’s business. I can hardly make assumptions for your family, but in mine, we have a specific way of dealing with busybodies, and trust me when I say it’s not pretty.”
“What a ponce,” he muttered under his breath as he flicked his book back open, quiet enough it was possible Harry wasn’t meant to hear it, but also loud enough he probably was.
Hermione sunk into the chair beside his, and Ron went to stand by her side, a hand already subconsciously reaching out for hers, which she took without even glancing up. “Yaxley,” she said, but by the pensive gleam in her eyes and the tight press of her lips, Harry assumed she was thinking aloud. “
Draco’s hand closed around a fistful of the powder, and he threw himself into the fireplace, throwing the powder into the hearth. Instantaneously, green flames sprung into existence, and Draco pictured his destination in his mind, could already smell the musty reek of it, feel the dust and cobwebs as though they clung to his very skin.
“Hiya Harry,” said Parvati cheerily, and Harry realized he’d been staring rather mystified at where Ginny still stood awkwardly, half-hidden behind Lavender and Parvati.
Draco immediately relaxed again, and he rolled his eyes. “Oh yes, har har, call the Slytherin a bad influence. How very original. You know what I think? I think
He was already halfway across the kitchen when he glanced over his shoulder and called out to a still dumbfounded-looking Ron, “You coming?”
He didn’t need to know that every single of Draco’s sarcastic replies and irritated eye-rolls served the sole purpose of hiding his true thoughts and feelings, what happened inside his chest every time Harry directed that dazzling smile his way.
Plus, with a smile like that, the type that could light up even the darkest of rooms, soften even the hardest of hearts, bring warmth to even the coldest of days—with a smile like that, who cared about the rest.
A flash of light ripped through the dark alleyway. Except it wasn’t green, but scarlet. Nor did it origin from Yaxley’s wand, a wand that, at that moment, was wrenched right out of the Death Eater’s grasp and thrown by some invisible hand across the street to join Draco’s across the cobbled pavement.
And before Draco could so much as form another thought, Harry’s lips had crashed against his. At the force of the impact, the blond staggered back another step, and was met with a very hard, very solid wall.
Right now, all Draco wanted to do was kiss his soulmate—and if, in the process, he managed to forget the rest of the world existed, then all the better.
“Yes, Mother?” he said, straightening his spine and smoothing down his hair before he, too, stood. “Is something the matter?”
Another crash sounded, and as Draco whirled around, grey eyes wide, hand mixer raised in front of him like a handgun, Harry only belatedly realized he had knocked over the flower vase on the table beside him.
The way the Girl-Weasley’s face flushed, so dark it very nearly matched the red of her hair, made it impossibly hard not to grin. Ooh, Draco knew he should stop. Provoking his soulmate’s ex-girlfriend was only going to end in one great big mess, one he’d likely regret later.
Draco snorted, finally having shaken his momentary daze. “Whatever is the matter? Are the near-death experiences deterring you? Late-night duels with Death Eaters? Nights spent at St. Mungo’s?”
Blaise looked once at Harry, once at Pansy, expression all the while appalled, and then proceeded to let out the most colossal and weary sigh known to humankind. “Bloody
Only they did. They had so, so many reasons to care, to worry, to be as sad and silent as Draco now was. And Harry hated it.
Weasley obliged, but he only drew back a step, eyes all the while never straying from his best mate’s face for even a second, as though afraid he might vanish in a puff of smoke if he did—and before Harry could so much as inhale, one particularly frizzy-haired Hermione had already flung herself into his recently-vacated arms.
Secondly, Harry knew for certain Draco was not made of wood, for the git, in his apparent surprise to see Harry in front of his door, had evidently forgotten how to correctly put on a jumper. That was the only explanation Harry could come up with, because there Draco was, silver-blond hair still damp and curling at the ends, grey eyes wide and…currently semi-shirtless.
The corners of her mouth twitched upwards into a smile, but before Harry’s jaw could hit the floor, Narcissa cleared her throat and stood. “Anyway, I really should be heading back to the Manor now. I just felt I should inform you personally of the news.” Her gaze darted back to Harry, and, yes, that was genuine warmth in her eyes. “Harry, I’m so glad you and Draco finally found each other. You two suit each other well, if I do say so myself. Just…take good care of him, will you? He likes to act tough but, sometimes, oftentimes, he needs protecting as well.”
“I’ll ask again,” a sharp voice cut through the silence—Yaxley’s interrogator, Ren Takeuchi. “Who are you working with? We know you purchased Acturin from a Philomena Craigs in Knockturn Alley. Were you two in contact? Did she supply you with any other poisons or assist you in any other way?”
“So,” Lavender said, glancing at Parvati mischievously, who was once again blushing furiously. Yup, Harry thought sympathetically, dimples alright. “Are you two…?”
Draco very much wanted to snap at the man to not call him mate, thank you very much, but another wave of pain got ahead of him, effectively cutting the Slytherin short as he gulped up another sharp intake of air through gritted teeth.
Malfoy nodded, unease gone for a moment. “Me too. It’s something I wanted to do since I was a child, to be honest. A bit of a childhood dream of mine, if you will. Not that I actually thought I’d get to do it. Not with my…circumstances.” Harry strongly suspected those circumstances had a name, one that began with Lucius and ended with Malfoy. But he stayed quiet and let his former rival talk. “Anyway, after the war, I wanted to do something I liked. Something that would…help. So, I did.” Suddenly, the Slytherin froze, and when his eyes found Harry’s his familiar sneer had returned—as though he’d realized just who it was he’d started to open up to, if only for an instant. “Of course, compared to the Boy Who Lived, I’m nothing, but I like to think I’m good at what I do, nonetheless.”
“I don’t really see why it matters what Mr. Sourboll thinks of me,” Draco stated. “Considering I’ll probably never see him again.”
Draco shuffled nervously as he and Harry stood outside a wide metal door, having rung the bell a minute ago. The building was a sandy coloured brick and looked like a warehouse, large and industrial with a few big arched windows. The smells of the nearby Thames were funnelled down the quiet side street which, due to the tall buildings, was relatively sheltered from the December wind.
“Think I’ll pass,” Harry replied with a shrug. It was one thing to have a few sweaty nights with various attractive betas but another to start entertaining an omega who simply wanted to get their claws in before anyone else did.
the last thing he remembered? Everything felt like a bit of a congealed blur. “We were revising financial sector reforms…I f-felt a bit weird…I remember being really thirsty.”
“He barely stutters at all now when he’s with me and the girls,” Hermione said proudly. “I think it must just be nerves.”
“Draco fainted last night,” Madam Pomfrey explained, “he was brought up to the hospital wing unconscious. We did a scan and found he was with child.”
Draco looked a little sad at this thought before he sighed and gave Harry a small shrug. “Bellatrix hasn’t sent m-my allowance this month. But I can still get the blouse!” Draco added happily, gesturing to the pink garment hanging up in the changing room.
“Harry!” Draco stood up excitedly as Sirius left them. “Did you really invite Sev?” It was true, Draco had been rather concerned about his godfather being at Hogwarts all alone.
“Good,” Harry replied, his face stretching into a wide grin. Draco was still undressed and Harry brought up his hand to rub gently down the omega’s back, his fingers dipping into the notches of his spine.
“Did it go alright with the thestrals?” Draco questioned as Harry began shedding his outermost layers and leaving them on the exposed flagstones by the door, away from the very expensive looking rugs.
Draco’s moans and whines became louder in volume, causing Harry to cast a muffling spell before allowing himself to make the same level of noise, grunting animalistically every time his throbbing length ploughed back into his pliant and welcoming mate.
Harry blinked in surprise at the trolley lady who had just slid open the door, a box of seasonal charity chocolate frogs in her hand.
“So, what happens now?” Harry asked, shifting on his seat. Despite being twenty-one he still felt like he was a nervous eleven year old whenever he was in the headmistress’ office.
“It’s perfectly normal,” Madam Pomfrey noted, tilting her head towards Draco, “he just needs rest and your magical energy.” At some point, Pomfrey had lost her hat and her brown hair now stood in erratic frizzy curls, some of it plastered against her damp cheeks. Harry thanked both of the women, he felt exhausted himself and couldn’t even begin to fathom how Draco’s small body had gone through such strain.
Harry fidgeted with the buttons of the burgundy shirt he had bought from Olive’s. The club was densely packed and sweaty and Neville had returned with a teetering tray of their fifth load of shots. The lights were neon and strobing in flickering pulses across the dance floor and charmed decorative bubbles bobbed in the air. If you reached out to burst them you would be showered in a temporary spray of artificial scent enhancer.
“Yes,” Draco hissed, arching his long neck and exposing the pale column of his throat as Harry felt a particularly tight knot start to loosen and dissipate.
Harry guessed this was the type of person everybody expected him to end up dating. Judging by Ron’s suggestive looks it was at least the type of person they figured he might go home with for the night.
The door to the common room opened and a flux of tenth years filtered in. Harry waved lazily over to Ginny who returned the gesture with a rude one of her own. Harry laughed, evidently the red headed beta was still pissed off at Harry for making a mean spirited joke about the size of Dean’s dick after a locker room dispute.
“I want,” Draco gasped as Harry went even deeper with his thrust, rubbing mercilessly at Draco’s contracting walls. “I want your cock!” Draco half screamed before whining, turning his face into the pillow. Harry quickly slid his other hand under Draco’s cheek, tugging him out of his hiding place and kissing him hotly.
Draco let Harry lift him up off the seat before walking back over to the bed. He felt hot now after having moved so many things about and shed himself of his lavender cardigan. He jumped in surprise as Harry let out a loud wolf whistle. He turned around to see the older man laughing.
Surely Draco must know that Harry was aroused by him? It wasn’t like Harry was even attempting to hide it any more.
“Yeah,” Harry grinned, walking over to the omega and frowning at a reddened, sore looking section of Draco’s lower lip. The boy had evidently been chewing on it as he tended to do when he felt anxious.
Eventually, both Ron and Hermione went to bed, bidding Harry and Draco a good night and that they would see them in the morning before everybody began their journeys home.
“Right,” Harry nodded, “sorry. I didn’t see anything.” Harry rolled his eyes at himself, there was no way Draco was going to believe that.
Draco looked surprised but allowed Harry to lead him up the stairs and around the rest of the house. They ended up in what was presumably the master bedroom with a stone balcony looking out onto the gardens and mingling guests below. Harry could hear the low trills of music and the clinking of champagne glasses. He snorted as he caught sight of Ginny Weasley tugging her girlfriend Angharad behind a particularly dense bush.
The omega was wearing a dusky pink satin blouse that was artfully loose and showed just a hint of his delicate collarbone. The blouse was tucked into high waisted, light grey trousers with a sharp crease down the centre. To top it off, Draco was donning cream coloured ballet shoes with mother of pearl rose motifs on the top. The whole effect was incredibly elegant and far softer on Draco’s pale skin than his usual black robes.
After Harry had established that only the icicles hanging from the roof contained alcohol, he bought them a purple one and a sunshine coloured one.
“Harry did not ask for such things and it could have turned out dreadfully,” Remus told the other man. “We are all fortunate that Draco is such a sweet boy and Harry is such a kind man,” Remus finished his sentence looking back at Harry. There was a fierce pride and love in the beta’s brown eyes as Harry looked back at him through his own tear filled ones.
“Oh the hot one!” Ron clicked his fingers in recognition before cringing over at Harry. Hermione exhaled slowly through her nose before rising up and storming towards the loos.
He had read that omega mothers who didn’t normally sport breasts would often grow, potentially even up to an A cup.
“You won’t feel trapped?” Harry asked as Draco clambered into the bed and shuffled over towards the wall. His sheets were white and soft, specially designed to be scentless for nesting use.
“Sirius is a five year old perpetually either crashing or surfing on a sugar high, whilst Remus here has a sense of humour drier than the Sahara,” Harry explained. Remus nodded in agreement with an apologetic grin at Draco.
“Y-Yes Daddy,” Draco mumbled, wrapping his mouth around Harry’s cock and moving his head slowly down. Draco still struggled to take all of the alpha into his mouth but Harry loved every earnest attempt. Hollowed cheeks massaged his dick as Draco’s tongue pulsed and moved as if still unsure what to do with itself.
After a hearty meal of different dishes from various stalls, everyone decided on tackling the Christmas Tree Maze. Seamus informed them that if you managed to reach the centre of the maze you would be able to pick a mystery box present from underneath the central tree, which was also the only one that would be decorated with ornaments and lights.
“Don’t worry, I’ve got a t-shirt on under here,” Harry explained, tugging the hoodie free and checking it was infused enough with his scent. He passed Draco the article of clothing, his inner alpha preening as the omega hugged it close to his chest.
“I’m sorry, can you repeat that?” Ron was staring at him aghast, the liquorice wand that had fallen out of his mouth twenty minutes ago was still stuck to the carpet.
“Oh, can you bring some of your fudge brownies over on Boxing Day?” Ron perked up, listening in on the conversation. “Only, don’t tell mum but they’re my favourite.”
“Careful,” Harry warned as Draco drew away with cheeks reddened from stubble rash, “I’m not as soft as you.”
Harry had tried to explain to Draco that probably wasn’t the case as Ginny had never even officially been Harry’s girlfriend. Plus, Molly had always somewhat adopted Harry as an extra member of the family, much to the suffering eye rolls of Sirius who found the entire household a little too loud.
“They are about the size of one of Hagrid’s turnips,” Madam Pomfrey explained cheerily as Harry pulled a face and mouthed ‘
want to know is why you didn’t tell me this poor omega was pregnant? I’ve had him on his feet rushing about for the last forty five minutes. Good lord Draco, please sit in the chair, you must be absolutely exhausted!”
“She’s here,” Draco breathed reverently, reaching out as Harry gently manoeuvred Lyra from his arms and into Draco’s cradled hold.
“Good, and what about the baby?” Dean asked, earning an ugly snort from Ginny. Harry glared at them as Hermione sent Dean a withering look.
“Please tell me,” Draco begged, he didn’t think he could bear all the horrendous hypothetical images that his imagination was currently conjuring. Harry turned to regard him closely for a moment before giving a brief, tight nod.
Harry nodded, starting to walk away before pausing and looking back. “There’s nothing wrong with being opportunistic Damien, you’re a Slytherin and that’s one of your strengths. But you should never resort to tearing other people down to try and build yourself up.”
woken up at four in the morning and wanted something like a ham and fudge sundae and I’m not there to get it for him?”
“What about him?” Harry narrowed his eyes as Remus rose up and started straightening the rug that Harry’s pacing had set askew.
“Ron’s just grumpy that he’s started needing reading glasses,” Harry whispered loudly, winking at Draco.
The group plunged into the mass of trees, laughing and whooping as they heard other maze goers calling back to them and shouting clearly erroneous instructions in a bid to get to the centre first.
“What?” Harry grimaced, he had naively hoped that he would just be able to walk away now that his role, or lack thereof, had been established. Although of course Harry had realised the spell would be ended, he hadn’t anticipated actually having to be involved so directly. No omega would consider having a child whilst they were unmated, despite it being old fashioned bullshit, that was the way it worked. There was an element of biological sensibility to it as well, for omegas were ill designed to carry a child to term without an alpha’s support.
Draco glared daggers at Harry whilst the older man attempted to make himself look suitably contrite.
The argument between the alphas was growing louder, with other people getting involved as Draco let himself be tucked up against Hermione’s chest and ferried out of the Great Hall. The beta woman smelled like shortbread and crystallised ginger and Draco noticed that she was leading him towards the castle’s stone annexe that housed the older students.
“You’ll be a part of the Weasley family soon I reckon,” Felicity snickered as Hermione coloured and rolled her eyes.
“I’d like to do it,” Draco replied before they paid for their tickets and walked through a small round door into the globe. It was rather frightening at first, like being stuck in the middle of a blizzard. Draco couldn’t even see the exit anymore. He leaned into Harry who wrapped an arm around his shoulders comfortingly.
“I c-can’t reach!” Draco let out a frustrated whine, his jerking arm stuttering and slipping. “My bump!”
“Makes sense that Narcissa was so happy during exams,” Sirius muttered, “Her, Remus and Snivellus always got top marks.”
Harry kissed him softly, the tenderness a juxtaposition to the reckless abandon of his previous fucking. “I just thought you might want to change position after coming.”
“Like the one in the photo with your mother,” Harry concluded in understanding. “I’m sure we can find somewhere like that. People must rent out country wizarding homes for weddings all the time.”
century goblin economic reforms. Draco had been wearing silk black pyjamas which had served to make him look perhaps even paler than usual and Harry had been a little worried about the omega’s refusal to eat dinner that evening. Draco had assured him, however, that it was just a bout of pregnancy nausea.
Draco moaned again, half covered by a choked gasp as he shut his eyes tightly, his knuckles were now white as he held onto the mattress.
“What?” Draco heard Harry’s panicked voice as the man himself appeared by the changing room, looking Draco up and down.
Harry thrust in one last time before pulling out his fingers and pushing Draco down onto the sheets, gasping and whining. Harry straddled the omega’s face, reaching down to take himself in hand and barrelling towards orgasm with hard, angry strokes. Harry snarled as he felt himself begin to come, spurting ropes and ropes of thick, white come across Draco’s face. Draco coughed as a substantial amount landed in his mouth, the slender column of his throat convulsing as he tried to swallow it all.
Draco gasped as he recognised the descriptors of his own scent. Before he could back away however, the door was jerked open.
Harry’s mind conjured up Draco again, the blond boy sat on his bed, hugging his knees as Professor McGonagall had lectured him and Harry about what the next nine months would look like. Draco hadn’t said a word, chewing his lower pink lip until it turned red and sore. Harry had half wanted to reach out and stop him before it bled. Draco’s hair was so pale, whilst most of Fleur’s family were blonde too there was something almost unnatural about Draco’s complexion. His eyes as well were such a light shade of grey to be unusual. Draco’s skin made him look like he never saw the sun albeit apart from the odd freckle or mark.
“It’s fine,” Draco shrugged, trying not think of how his heat suppressants had left him shivering and cold in his dorm bed whilst the other omegas played exploding snap and swapped stories of courting alphas.
Draco laughed, a little louder than he had meant to as he clapped a hand over his mouth a second later and glanced sheepishly at Harry. The other man was grinning and looking pleased.
“Imagine,” Draco told him, pointing a slender finger at the page, “these stockings with this dress and oh!” Draco turned the page quickly, “
Snape jerked his head up in surprise and Harry loved that he had finally unbalanced the normally stiff professor.
He and some of the others were seated in the Gaedere common room for their weekly joint study session. Neville had even lit the fire, despite it not even being that cold outside yet.
“I’m just asking! Although I guess as an alpha you can always change your mind, Draco’s the one getting bitten.”
Draco gasped, clutching at Harry fearfully, his nerves not settled at all even when Harry and Remus began snorting with muffled laughter.
Draco laughed and Harry was pleased he had managed to share a joke with the omega. In fact, the younger boy seemed to be almost leaning in to Harry now.
“We took a bit longer,” she explained, looking at the others accusingly, “I think Philip’s sprained his ankle.”
Harry tried not to wince as he heard the headmistress let out a resigned sigh, coupled with Snape’s strangled groan.
“A mother’s love,” Snape spoke woodenly, “they say a mother’s love saved him, but would that not be an insult to every other mother who has lost their child – that
Draco waited patiently, glancing with interest at the various parchments and tomes that were spread across the desk. Finally, Severus looked up, a thin, black eyebrow arched.
that he hadn’t been here when Draco fell ill. His inner alpha was in a terrible strop with Harry for the mistake and now was desperate to try and comfort the suffering omega in any way.
Gingerly, Draco turned round and looked up. Harry had clearly washed and changed from his quidditch practice, now wearing heavy black robes, his hair shiny and tousled off his face. He looked huge compared to Bellatrix and he towered domineeringly over the table before laying a gentle hand on Draco’s shoulder.
“Oh we are,” Remus said brightly, “We’re staying with a lovely family called the Prices, did you know there’s a sizeable Welsh community in Patagonia?”
Draco scrunched his nose up in confusion and cocked his head, Hermione had always told him to be patient with Harry’s long winded explanations but this one was particularly hard to decipher.
Harry slid off the bed before tugging his pyjama trousers down, revealing his own semi hard cock. He heard Draco make a strangled noise before joining the younger boy back on the mattress.
“Draco’s scent turns to apple pie when he’s happy,” Harry told them. Draco blinked in surprise, he hadn’t realised that Harry had become so in tune with his emotional scents.
It was a relatively clear day and Harry found himself watching the familiar landscape go by rather nostalgically. By the second hour, however, Draco had started to fidget a lot more, letting out small huffs of breath as he shifted about on the seat next to Harry.
Draco pulled a confused expression before realisation dawned across his features, along with a cherry red blush. “O-Oh, you…” Draco cleared his throat, glancing down at the soiled bed sheets.
He nodded goodbye to the two men before strolling back up towards the castle. Harry paused when he realised he had forgotten to ask Snape which vial contained the stabilisation potion and which the feverfew elixir. He knew Draco would probably be able to figure it out but it didn’t hurt to be certain. He jogged back down towards the walled herb garden, pausing by a topiary box shrub of a phoenix as he heard Snape and Remus still conversing.
“But it’s true!” Ron protested. “I’m not saying I agree with it Mione but it’s a pretty permanent decision for a kid to make.”
Draco laughed as Harry gently helped the omega to his feet, leading him through a side door and into a grand looking marble bathroom. “One thing I did do, is get the water hooked up already,” Harry announced, gesturing to a massive bathtub that was nestled up against the window, looking out over the gardens. Fairy lights were twinkling in the trees and the eco friendly paper lanterns that Luna had brought were evidently being set off, dancing across the night sky in hues of gold and orange.
Draco pouted at Harry who seemed rather amused by the reaction. “Did you want something from me sweetheart?” Harry asked, running his hands up Draco’s sides and tugging the nightgown with him, exposing the omega completely.
your parents were alphas?” Draco questioned in surprise. He had never heard of that before, although Bellatrix appeared to have sheltered him from a lot of the less ‘favourable’ dynamics.
“I suppose one of the benefits about bonding with Draco whilst he’s still under your legal alphaship is that you won’t have to get permission from the Lestranges,” Hermione said thoughtfully, sucking on the end of her straw.
“Thank you Harry,” Draco replied, his throat felt swollen. Tentatively, and ever so slowly, Draco raised his own hand, moving it towards Harry where his fingertips pressed up against the alpha’s muscled chest. Harry’s body always gave off such a comforting wave of warmth and his scent was soaking into the sheets that Draco was wrapped in.
Harry and Remus exchanged self satisfied glances as Sirius and Draco began chattering about the carousel.  Despite Sirius being a relatively unknown alpha, Draco seemed to have relaxed and looked to be enjoying himself as the pyramid’s different levels came together.
Harry’s dreams that night were colourful and vivid. In them, he watched as Draco methodically pulled silk stockings on and off, scandalously revealing the lower part of his leg like some sort of saucy Victorian. Harry really hoped that no one he ever met would be a powerful enough legilimens to find out that once, at two am, Harry had found himself jerking off in bed to the thoughts of a slender, pale ankle.
Draco chewed on his lip and settled the rest of his persimmon on his plate. His stomach was finally feeling a little queasy at all the different types of food. “I don’t….anymore,” Draco added as Harry raised a thick eyebrow with a disbelieving smile. “I never r-really talked to any alphas before, apart from my aunt.”
“Their head certainly is,” Harry whispered to Draco with a wink as Madam Pomfrey let out a despairing noise and began casting another set of spells.
Draco snorted a laugh, “No, Harry is going on to the advanced auror programme. He says we can both work and it will be okay, besides I told you – my role would only be part time.”
Harry winced, he knew Draco’s pregnancy was going to be revealed within the next week or so. Omega scents changed quickly to reflect their fertile status.
Harry managed to find them a comfortable, empty apartment on the Hogwarts Express, letting out a threatening growl whenever another student tried to slide open the door and join them. Every time Harry sent some eighteen year old alpha scuttling, he noticed that Draco would hide a small smile in his sleeve.
Draco shuffled awkwardly, he had grown even closer to the curly haired woman over the last month of living in Gaedere House and whilst he still felt horribly shy around Harry at times, he was pretty confident about talking to Hermione.
Draco’s face fell, had he misread this completely? Did Harry think the nightgown was horribly vulgar?
“Her love was more than enough to choose to sacrifice herself,” Snape continued with a sigh, “as was his father’s. They died that day to save their son, it’s true. However, it was the spell that cemented the emotion into a shield, rebounding a killing curse from the most powerful dark wizard of our time.”
“A-Ah,” Draco panted as Harry grabbed his shoulders, lifting him back up and onto Harry’s lap. Draco’s cock was hard again, bobbing underneath his belly, the tip connected to his bump by a sticky trail of precome. Harry could feel his own erection become covered in Draco’s slick, his needy hole so tantalisingly close.
“You need to be careful, little one,” Harry murmured, his lips ruffled Draco’s hair as he spoke, the other man’s head bowed down towards him. Draco squeezed his eyes tightly shut as he felt his thighs start to tremble, instinctively he pushed back ever so slightly, eliciting a muted intake of breath from the older man. There was something huge and hard nudging Draco’s right buttock and the hand on his belly was diffusing his skin with heat like a brand.
“Maybe Greece,” Katie hummed thoughtfully, “Nick’s got an aunt in Thessaloniki. Then again, I quite like the U.K. during the summer, it’s the winters I can’t stand, so perhaps we should postpone it for when we can both get time off work.”
Harry grabbed Smith’s collar and jerked him forwards, Smith yelping as his injured nose banged against Harry’s.
Draco cringed as the silence finally burst, most of the room dissipating into frenzied conversations and conjecture. Draco could hear the odd words and phrases;
“Leave it Smith,” Harry growled. The rumbling sound made Draco tense, he had never been this close to an alpha before. Even Bellatrix had always kept Draco at arm’s length and she more shrieked than growled.
He glanced at Hermione again to check if they were mocking him but she was merely regarding him as if curious for the answer.
“I have potions that can dissolve such a bond,” Snape replied quickly, his voice hard again. “And if I ever get so much of a whiff that Draco is unhappy –“
Thankfully, over the next few seconds the snow began to settle and soon a completely sparse space was revealed, the snow clad ground glistening in bright sunshine.
Draco let out a small huff, stroking his slender fingers through Harry’s mop of black hair. Harry smiled and pressed a loving kiss right in the middle of the bump. He could smell Draco’s scent projecting happiness and contentment as the room filled with apple pie. Wanting even more, Harry began to pepper Draco’s belly with kisses, even as the omega started to giggle and try to push him away.
The warmth of the alcohol was starting to burn off and Harry couldn’t help but notice the room was a little chilly.
“Madam Pomfrey told me,” Harry lied, hoping Ron didn’t notice the books stuffed under Harry’s bed, “that omegas bond with the fetus immediately…like, from conception.”
“Gonna have so many more babies with you,” Harry grunted, angling his cock upwards and hitting Draco’s insides in a way that sent fireworks off inside of him. “Make you always like this, swollen with my seed.”
“I need the loo,” Draco said quickly, putting down the mobile with a faint jingle of glass and lifting himself up. He felt Remus quickly come to his aid as the beta helped Draco get to his feet. Draco nodded at him in thanks before hurrying over to the nearest bathroom and locking the door.
we’ve been trying to find a pureblood alpha for you Draco. Can you imagine if it got out that you’d already been knocked up? The Sourbolls would laugh in our faces!”
“Fuck, Draco is that –“ Harry began to ask, sounding shocked when suddenly there was a loud rapping knock on the outside of the snow globe.
Draco made a noise of distressed protest as Harry laughed and resigned himself to a very sticky sleep, perhaps the bubble bath could wait until morning after all.
“I see,” Professor McGonagall visibly relaxed. “I was worried how you might react, given some of the incidents that have happened over the years.”
An inexplicable ache tightened around Draco’s heart, but he swallowed down the hurt that enveloped him whole when Harry, who’d been laughing and smiling and calling him
Draco clenched his jaw. Salazar, they were going about this all wrong. Philomena Craigs was an extremist when it came to blood purity, sure, but she’d stayed well away from Voldemort and his Death Eaters during both of the two wars—why the hell would she go out of her way to willingly assist Yaxley now? She was all bark, no bite. Anyone in their right mind could see that!
Harry glanced at the man in question, and immediately felt his own expression soften. The steely glint in the Slytherin’s eyes, the determined angle of his jaw, the sharp edges of his face—but then also the way Draco curled up against him, the way their hands rested between them, interlocked, the way his silvery hair framed his face like a halo.
Draco only nodded. “It was, in a way. Naturally, my grandparents were absolutely thrilled when it turned out my parents were each other’s soulmates. But if they hadn’t been, it wouldn’t have made a difference either.” He shrugged. “It was just an added bonus.”
Hermione was grinning now, the triumphant sort Draco had seen more than enough times back at Hogwarts, when a teacher praised her for knowing the answer or she got full marks on an exam. Back then, he’d hated her, and he’d hated her grin.
And before Draco could even fully process those words, process what Yaxley had done to the woman he’d loved, to his soulmate, the Death Eater spoke again.
“Plus, we should head over to see Mum and the others anyway,” added Ron. “She must be going sparse, what with the baby coming and Harry here and Fred’s incessant crying. Didn’t you say anyway you wanted to be there when Roxanne’s born?”
That’s the one and only thing he could say with absolute certainty as he stood there in front of the cherry wood door leading to Robards’ office, fist lifted and ready to knock—just as it had been for the last thirty seconds.
Harry had expected himself to feel smug, or victorious, or at least a tiny bit triumphant. After all, he’d been fantasizing about punching the git in the face just minutes before. Yet all he felt then was that same vague pain in his chest area.
Pansy caught the newspaper and skimmed the front page, dark eyebrows immediately lifting sky-high. Blaise peeked over her shoulder, and his mouth almost instantly formed a grim line.
“What?” Harry asked, one eyebrow lifted in amused suspicion as he watched Draco gently set down his cup of tea and stand from where he’d indeed been sitting the last few minutes, deep in thought, staring at Harry because…
“The Dark Lord perceived Carlota as a danger, both to the cause and my loyalty to him. I never would have betrayed him for her, of course, not ever, but he was right to be concerned. Carlota was…a distraction.” Yaxley leaned back again, and when Draco looked back up into his eyes, they were like two empty, hollow shells of obsidian. “So, I did away with her.”
His arms, his legs, his head, his chest—everything. It ached, and Harry was absolutely certain his whole body must be covered in a plethora of bruises right about now, red, blue, green, purple, yellow, all the colours of the rainbow.
But he swallowed his discomfort. It was better this way; if anyone save for Pansy, Blaise, Hermione and Ron were to find out about them, they’d be in trouble, to say the least. And neither he nor Draco needed that on top of everything else that was going on right now.
“I’m so sorry,” he said, rather pathetically. “I can’t even imagine. What about your father? Can he do anything to help her?”
Even he could admit begrudgingly that Harry wasn’t to blame for Draco’s near-heart attack. It wasn’t Harry’s fault he’d been gone when Weasley and several other colleagues (whom Draco really ought to know the names of by now, but alas) had burst into the flat all frenzied and hectic, making Draco nearly spill the contents of his errands all over the kitchen floor. Harry’d simply left at the wrong time, left without ever saying where, left with that absolute
“Harry,” Robards said, and something in his voice yanked Harry from his deliberations, making him look up again. He was startled to find concern gleaming behind the Head Auror’s dark eyes. “I know you’ve been through your fair share of assassination attempts. But this is serious. There’s a high chance whoever did this may be a Death Eater, or at the very least a sympathizer. Someone who goes out of their way to procure Acturin for you, when a simple Avada Kedavra would suffice…I think it’s safe to say this won’t be their last attempt.” His words hung heavily in the air of the hospital room. “Therefore, I’ve decided, to ensure your protection, a fellow Auror will be assigned to your person. They will remain at your side around-the-clock.”
He could have refused, could have told his mother she was being silly, that she’d met Harry plenty times. Except Draco couldn’t bring himself to feign any annoyance, not when he couldn’t even tear his gaze away from the man in question.
Ron blinked and although his gaze still remained on Draco for a split-second longer, he then turned his attention back to Harry, and nodded. “Sure do. They caught him somewhere on the outskirts of London, in this hovel of an apartment. Apparently the owner died back in the war, and Yaxley knew this and decided he’d set up camp there. Too bad Robards’s had Aurors scoring every inch of the city for days now. He put up a fight, he did, but we outnumbered him twenty-to-one.” Ron looked proud, but Draco didn’t seem in the least impressed.
A few moments passed, but then the door to the guest room opened and out shuffled a scowling, grumbling Malfoy. He immediately glared at Harry, ignoring the letter still gripped tightly in his hands. “I am not a
They were out in Muggle London, at some fancy-looking restaurant Nic had sworn had the best French cuisine in the area, the name of which Harry likely wouldn’t be able to pronounce even if held at wandpoint.
—the man who’d tried to murder Harry on multiple occasions, who’d like nothing more than to hurt him, kill him if he could, who would find a way to use this against him, and Harry—
Potter watched him, mouth slightly agape, but then nodded, and the look of sheer bewilderment still etched into his features made Draco want to shout a someone, preferably Potter. “Alright,” Potter said. “Agreed. Do you, err, need my address?”
Malfoy’s grey eyes darkened, as did his scowl. “Why, you're recovering from attempted murder, of course. What did you think you were doing here, Potter? Enjoying the five-star accommodations? Perhaps the gourmet food?”
