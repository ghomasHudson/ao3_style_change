“Yeah, I need help with my potions homework.”
“What letter?”
“Leave. Now. Unless you want to face Azkaban again for breaking and entering.” Harry growled, “I doubt they’d be so lenient this time. And just so you know, Draco is not going to your wedding.”
Harry sighed; he knew the answer was right there in front him.
‘All your fault. All your fault. All your fault. All your fault. All your fault. All your fault.’
“Okay… umm, thank you.”
Before Dean went to grab more rocks Harry had to ask him about something that had been on his mind for a while: “Was it hard, to come out? Was it scary?”
The flesh was raw, but the Dark Mark was still there. As if it was imprinted into his very bones. But he cared about that.
Molly gave him a small smile and Draco knew he had been forgiven. He also knew he had to apologize to Arthur as well.
“Your dad handed the book to Ginny right before second year. Is there any place he could have kept it?”
The summer after the battle of Hogwarts, the Malfoys were caught by Aurors and sent to Azkaban for five months. Those five months gave Draco a lot of time to think about a lot of things. Not good ones at that.
“We would like to put up special Ministry wards along with the ones the Manor already has.”
“But-”
“An’ I’ve already told ya, I don’ have anything.”
“Nobody else is going to die. Not for me.”
“I’m not trying to get ‘cozy’ with Malfoy. I’m just saying we should put the war behind us.”
I stare at her in shock as Quinn says, “We all placed bets! And I won. I got it right to the day! All of you pay up.”
“A lot.”
“I just heard him call you a faggot. And then I saw red.”
But as Malfoy swung onto the back of his broom a flaming Griffin fastened it’s claws around the blonde and pulled him back into the raging flames. The last thing Harry saw was his petrified face as the flames swallowed him whole.
Kreacher stared at him, “A cake? Master wants a cake?”
“Where is Crabbe now?”
“What’s going on?” Came a voice.
Harry slammed his hands on the sink. ‘Your such a fucking idiot!’ He thought, angrily. ‘You tactless shit! Why would you say that! Is that how you treat people you love?”
Draco collapsed panting. Harry hurried over. “Are you alright?” He asked anxiously.
“It’s not my fault you're so terrible at school work.”
TW: none actually, I just wanted to write a sort of chill one before the angsty stuff.
Harry sighed and stood up, trying to wipe the mud off of his face. He looked at the rest of the carriages they were almost to Hogwarts. And here he was, almost two miles away.
Draco had to think about it for a moment. Going on the date would mean that the wedding would be off. If he thought long and hard he knew that he would never be able to go through with the wedding regardless. All he really wanted was to be with Harry and he had only agreed to the wedding because of his mother and father. He had wanted to keep the Malfoy honor. And it wasn’t as if he had had much choice in the matter.
Draco glanced over at him, “It’s been fine.”
“Yes. I am. Cosmo came and told me that you had remodeled the house, and suddenly I had the energy to get up.”
The charm was getting too intense now and Draco collapsed on the ground. Harry took this opportunity to pin him down with strong arms. He leaned down to say, “Don’t ever call me a coward!”
Forced onto the ‘Dark Side’ as I was the ‘Light’. Not having any choice in the matter. Forced to keep face in public just as I was.
Harry yawned, “Well, not usually to the crack of dawn!”
Harry sighed, maybe things would be okay.
Luna glanced at him, “Well, thank you Harry.”
A nameless child curled in a heap as a Death Eater performed the Killing Curse on them.
“It’s more than that. I wasn’t talking to anyone, at all!”
Harry sighed recognizing defeat. “No. I don't want you to go.”
I step through the door, and immediately do a double take. Malfoy is sitting at Hagrid’s table with a giant mug in his hands.
“Care to elaborate?”
Harry found both of his friends by the 8th year fire.
Ron was flipping through the latest addition of the Quibbler.
Draco sighed and picked himself up off of the tile.
He walked up and down the corridors, peering into rooms that they had yet to paint. When he passed Draco’s room he heard a small whimper. He froze and listened harder.
Was she trying to get into his head?
They appeared right outside of the Manor doors. Harry looked around in confusion. “I thought there were Anti-Apparition spells.” He said.
“I’m sorry.” Harry said, “Hopefully we can get her out bed.”
I splutter. I don’t know how to respond to that. So instead I study his eyes closely. Because like they say: The eyes are the window to the soul.
“It’s irrelevant. He did terrible things to many people back then.”
There was a small circular tent next to the giant wheel. It had animals stuck to poles inside it. Some of them even looked like creatures from the wizarding world. Except the mermaids were very different. They actually looked pretty.
Parvati laughed and then kissed Lavender hard. When they broke apart the room seemed a little shell shocked, but the two were both beaming with happiness and hugging each other.
“So, Draco. How was your day? I heard that you and Harry are still working on that case.”
“I’m pansexual and I have a crush on Blaise Zabini.” He said, opening his eyes to see Harry’s reaction.
“Dead.”
Harry seemed to know exactly where Draco kept his wand and snagged it from his belt loop before he could reach it. Draco tried to cast the counter curse wandlessly but he was laughing too hard.
After hearing Harry sigh for the fifteenth time Ron was fed up. “Mate, why don’t you just ask Hermione?”
Harry looked horrified, “I’m sorry! I didn’t know that you would be hurt that bad! And you didn’t have a wand to protect you! Because I took it. I’m so sorry.”
Everyone in the common room looked like they would much rather live in a trash can. But they agreed grudgingly, cause everyone knew: when Hermione put her mind to something, there’s nothing you can do to stop her.
“I am too.” Ron said.
Harry sighed, it was true. Draco’s hair was always bloody perfect. It didn’t look like it had when he was back in school. No. It looked a lot softer. So Harry being the complete idiot he is, reached over to brush a stray lock off of Draco’s forehead.
“Master Sadder wants to see you in his office.”
She whipped around, “Harry.”
Harry nodded and cast a quick Tempus, “It is time to go anyway… Can Draco come?”
“Hermione, I’m sorry I insulted your teaching skills, I know you were just looking out for me. I know I’ve been distant and you were trying to help me on my way to become an Auror.”
“You wish.”
“But I do. I’m still afraid of what he’ll do to me. He’s done some nasty things that even the Ministry hasn't caught. He would beat my mom if she didn’t agree with him.”
“Which one?” Ginny piped up, “They’re all messed up!”
I can’t tell him what I know; that would put him in danger. I wish there was something to say that could ease the pain, but there isn't. So I say instead, “No. I need to do this. There’s no other way.”
Ginny poked him. “Admit it. You guys were overly obsessed with each other. You both went out of your way to notice each other across the Great Hall. The Slytherin and Gryffindor tables are on opposite sides!”
Harry nodded his approval. “Alright. Expecto Patronum.” They both expected a silver stag to burst forth, but, to both of their surprises, a small twisting dragon flowed from the tip of his wand.
“I love you too Harry.”
Harry pulled him over to where Hermione and Ron were sitting.
“Okay!” Dean said, the first to speak up. “Congratulations!” Everyone joined him in a hasty applause and the game continued. Although Lavender and Parvati seemed to disappear.
I’m walking down to lunch when it hits me. I stop dead in my tracks. Ron and Dean look back at me.
“Oh right. How silly of me to think that I would be any different? I’m only your /girlfriend/!”
That thought finally seemed to register in his head; he pulled back his eyes wide. The same expression was mirrored on Harry's face. Something in his chest broke.
“Well, sometimes the Muggle way is best.” He said, a slight blush dusting his cheeks.
“I was waiting for the cashier to get my ordered books from the back.”
He gave Harry's shoulder a playful shove but Harry could see that his eyes were glistening.
“I’ll come with you then.” Harry said, without hesitation.
‘Don’t be stupid!’ Draco spat back. ‘I can handle my father!’
Sadder smiled, stood up and started clapping. “You deserve a round of applause for that!”
Malfoy seems unfazed as he looks down his nose at me. (I absolutely hate that I’m several inches shorter.) “On the contrary, I would argue that you’ve been stalking me.”
“Bisexual yeah. I was just wondering.”
Harry smiled into the fabric of Draco's shirt, “You're too cute.”
Without waiting for Ron’s response he got up and stalked over to the Slytherin side of the room.
Harry was left on his own most of the day, but he didn’t mind. He was very introverted and a day of rest was just what he needed. To many people’s surprise he wasn’t opposed to reading. He enjoyed a good muggle romance novel once in a while. In fact he had packed several of them, thinking the Mrs. Malfoy might like them.
Harry’s feet slammed the ground, as he ran from the horde of angry owls surging his way.
It opens up just enough for me to crawl in. It's a lot smaller than the last time I used it, or maybe I’m just bigger. I slide in and my feet hit, hard, stone floor. The passage snaps shut behind leaving me in pitch black.
“No. Just trying to give a toddler a chance to catch the snitch.” Draco said, not taking his eye off the fluttering gold ball in front of him.
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose, how was this going to help. He cast a quick Tempus and saw that it was 7:11. He should probably go, Merlin forbid he be late for a meeting with Harry Potter.
“I’m good, I was sent over here to ask if you two wanted to come to Hogsmead soon, some of the oldest members of the D.A. are coming.”
“Well then! Let's clean it!”
“Hermione, Ron, I’m really, really sorry. I’ve been an absolute dick for the past two years. I know that there’s nothing I can say to make up for it. Nothing I can say to excuse it. I push people away, people that are trying to help. Like you two. I know that you care about me so much, and it took me so long to realize that. It took me two fucking years!”
Draco was too tired to resist, so he just sat down and began to eat. He tried not to think about what the night would bring, but it was hard not to be afraid. He also tried desperately not to think about the night before. Not thinking about anything at all seemed to be the best option.
Harry gripped his leg, and that sent tingles up his spine. “Was it Nevil?”
“'Cause I'm not giving' up,
Sorry guys, this chapter is a little shorter than usual, just because I wrote it when my mental health was not at all stable. So yeah, its short.
“If you’ll excuse me, Potter.” Malfoy turns to leave before adding, “And if I were you, I’d stop sticking my nose where it doesn’t belong. You might end up going the same way as your parents.”
It’s only Malfoy’s shout of, “Oi, Potter! Are you going to help or not?” That pulls me from my stupor.
Ron sighed, “Harry you’ve been really down the past couple of days, is there something going on?”
“Whatever.” Draco could feel his heart start to flutter, knowing that the moment was drawing closer.
Draco and Harry spent the remainder of the day cleaning and repainting the walls of the ballroom.
“Please Granger. I know what I did. And I don’t regret it.” Draco glared back at Harry, just as intensely, “I suggest that you leave before Potter’s magic blows.”
Ron looked uneasy, but just shrugged and said, “Sure.”
“I don’t know, it just felt like the right thing to do.”
“That’s horrible! The Mark doesn’t hold dark magic! Not since you killed Voldemort. The Healers hold a grudge against all former Death Eaters. Quite frankly, refusing service to someone in this condition is illegal. We ought to press charges.”
“What do you think I would do if I was found with your dead corpse?”
But Draco wasn't done yet. “The teacher fucked the preacher, but then he had to leave her. Had to wash away the sins of a male cheerleader. ‘Hi nice to meet you!’ Got nothing to believe in. So let me know when my breathing stops. ‘Cause my high hopes are getting low, because these people are so old. The way they think about it all, if I tried I would never know. My high hopes are getting low but I know I’ll never be alone.”
“You better!” I say, pointing a finger at his chest. “Explain why you know so much about my personal life! Have you been stalking me?”
“It is, but only the Department of Mysteries have enough information to track this person.”
“Crucio!”
“Sure?” Harry handed his boyfriend the snitch, looking dumbfounded.
Draco glanced around tentatively, his mum could be quite a fright when she was angry.
So he decided to have a little fun. He snapped open both eyes and said, “Can I help you? Or are you just going to stare at me all day?”
Draco nodded numbly, grabbed the folders, and left the office. How was he supposed to work with the Great Harry Potter? This was going to be a disaster.
“You could have died.” Though his magic was whipping, and his face was twisted, he spoke softly. “What were you thinking?”
“Would it help if I said that I’m bisexual?” Ginny asked, wiping her eyes.
Draco reached a hand up to gently stroke the dark curls on Harry’s head. “It’s okay.” he whispered. “You're safe.”
Draco didn’t say anything. He just sighed, pulled Harry up on the bed and kissed him as if his life depended on it.
Thinking it would be rather rude to Harry if he didn’t stay, (at least for a little bit) he walked into the kitchen.
Draco had Harry, and Harry had Draco. They had been through a lot, but that had made them strong.
It was silent as they started to make the wards, it took all day as the Manor was so big. At one point Draco saw one of the peacocks and remembered that fateful day as a child:
“Oh no. I just like walking to school. People think it’s quite odd, but I find it relaxing to have time by myself in the middle of the woods, before the bustle of the Great Hall.”
“I suppose we should wait here to see if the wards have been broken.” Harry said.
Harry turned his face away; his cheeks were rapidly reddening.
Harry watched Draco chew his bottom lip, “But I’ve done nothing to fix them.”
Harry’s smirk vanished and his eyes welled.
As it turned out Ron was very clingy when drunk and Hermione had to Apperate them home. It was quite funny to watch Ron stager around the bar talking to random people about who would win the next Quidditch match: Gryffindor or Slytherin? The poor people he attacked were just minding their own business.
Harry looked up. Malfoy was staring at him.
Hermione looked taken aback by his angry outburst. “Alright fine.” She snapped, and turned back to Slughorn.
“Tick, tock. Stop the clock, because I got the feeling that I’m gonna get shot.”
Draco, Harry, Coco and Cosmo worked all day putting together furniture in the newly painted rooms. Harry and Draco left the two House Elves to do some of it on their own because they still had to paint the ballroom.
Even when they say there's nothing' left,
‘Potter, I know that this must seem like a very bad decision indeed. I did choose carefully. I know that you and Mr. Malfoy don’t exactly have a good relationship, but you were the only one that I thought I could trust not to bully him. You of all people should know how much a war can damage someone.’
Harry’s expression changed instantly, “Oh. My partner forgot to grab me before he Appearated out of the warehouse.” He said bitterly, “A Death Eater hit me with a curse to the hip. So now I’m off the force for a while. Good thing is, Johnson is off of it for the rest of his life.”
Both Harry and Draco reached out their hands at the same time, but Harry put on a burst of speed, snatching the snitch out of the air before Draco even had a chance.
It was a while before either of them spoke, but it was Gra-Hermione who broke the silence:
Draco, of course, couldn’t back down from a challenge. So he grabbed the lowest branch and hoisted himself up. It wasn’t hard getting up to the top, but the tree was swaying dangerously. Then he had to remind himself yet again that he was a wizard. He whispered a spell that made the tree extra sturdy and finally joined Harry on the same branch.
Harry’s eyes flew open, he was breathing hard and clutching the sheets on his bed. He took several deep breaths in order to calm his racing heart.
The first thing Harry saw when he slid through the partially opened doors was the fact that there were now five tables instead of four. He gave Luna a questioning look, but she was already flouncing off to the Ravenclaw table, not caring that she just appeared in mid air.
“Yeah Harry, you’ve done many horrible things to him in the past and you've never apologized for any of those.”
“Fine! I’ll tell you!”
“Did you send him an enchanted note?”
I'll wait for you.”
Harry blinked; he never expected Hermione to suggest anything like this at all.
Ron inhaled sharply, “You know what Harry? Fine. I’ll leave,” his tone had gained an edge, “I’ll leave and not bother you. Because that seems to be all that I do. Here me and Hermione are, your /best friends/, willing to talk to you, and be there for you. And all you do is push us away. Wow. Five stars from me in the friend category. So I guess I’ll leave because apparently I’m disturbing the Saviour’s slumber. And while I’m at it maybe I’ll find some better people to hang out with.”
This got even more laughs and Seamus’ cheeks turned tomato red.
The blonde wanted to beg him not to leave. But he knew exactly when Harry was doing it. He had seen Draco’s boggart after all.
Quinn sits down and grabs a piece of bacon, “Sure you're not. And I’m Merlin himself!”
‘Did you hear what I was saying?” He asks.
“What?” He asked, maybe a little bit too aggressively.
“Crucio.”
“There’s something here, but it kind of feels like your magical signature.”
She was looking at Ron the entire time she said this. Harry smiled knowingly.
“Yes.”
“Imperio.”
“Have Ron and Hermione visited yet?”
“Another Truth or Dare game.”
“Remodeled it?”
Harry glanced at the paper in front of him and ran his fingers through his hair nervously.
“Same thing.” He reported, and noted that Harry looked alarmed.
I don’t even bother fighting back. What’s the point. Malfoy’s always purposely taking jabs at me. This year is the year that I've finally chosen to ignore his snide comments. I thought it would help, but turns out it just builds the tension between us. And oddly enough, I like the adrenaline rush I get when I’m arguing with him.
“Hey yeah!” Ron exclaimed, “And this year you’ve been so nice to him. Harry! You have a crush on Malfoy!”
Draco bit his lip. Was he really about to spill his heart out? Yes.
“It’s Harry! But fine, let’s just try the curses.”
Both Ron and Hermione looked at him, surprised.
“Because I told them to say that. I wanted it to be a surprise. It was a bonus that you actually admitted you had feelings.”
Draco never got a chance to reply because at that moment, Weasley Apparated into the office. Not just anywhere in the office; he Apperated right on top of Draco.
“What’s wrong?” He asked.
Harry barely noticed Arthur slip back inside as he flung himself at the blonde. His weight was too much, and they were both sent tumbling to the ground. “You're back!”
“What are you doing here!” The blonde demanded.
Draco’s eyes flew open. He was lying on a couch in what he assumed was Number 12 Grimmauld place. (Harry now lived there alone.) He saw Harry and Hermione standing over him.
Hermione looked stung, “Well I’m sorry I want you to be successful and independent.” She snapped.
Both Hermione and Ron turned to him, confused.
“Alright! Who’s going to start?”
“Yes?”
“I’m not going.” Draco responded firmly. His confidence growing.
Draco raised his eyebrows, but continued.
“Ron,” Potter got up and shook Weasly’s shoulders, “Listen to me! Fluer is strong! She is one of the strongest people I know! She will make it through this, she made it through the Triwizard Tournament for Merlin’s sake.”
“What did he do to you?”
“Oh! Hi Luna, how are you?”
I throw my Invisibility Cloak back over my shoulders and walk away from Nevil. He is picking up Colin Creevey and taking him to the castle. Colin was too young to die.
“What?” I say.
“I suppose you would want to know.” He sighed, “It’s complicated really. When the Ministry officials came the day of the battle, the only Death Eaters still there were us. The others had fled. The Aurors took us into custody, Azkaban, and we were promised a trial. But it didn’t come for months. The few Dementors that stayed loyal to the Ministry were enough to make us miserable in that awful prison.
Draco didn't say anything. He didn't need to. Harry was going to have to get this off his chest at some point.
The ebony haired man took out his wand and waved it. “But how is that possible?” He whispered.
“DRACO!” The door to his room banged open. “Draco! Get your lazy arse out here! You will not be holed up there all day! Please come down for dinner!”
“Oh sod off! We both know you're way worse.”
He sat back up and scratched the back of his head. *Fuck it.* he thought again. “Umm, well actually. If we’re being completely honest I wanted to snog you senseless. But since you're…”
Harry’s brow furrowed, “Draco, that wasn’t small.”
The they were in the bathroom:
Harry chuckled again, “You’re right, maybe beating Ron /will/ cheer me up.”
Harry stood back up, “We’re going soon, so get ready!” The Gryffindor walked off to their shared room. (The two had bought a house two years back.)
“Merde! C'est mauvais! Qu'avez-vous fait?” He mumbled while running his wand over Harry’s body, closing the gashes in his skin.
Draco shook his head, trying to rid the memories of that night. He was so used to nightmares by now, he didn’t bother to go back to sleep. He glanced at his Grandfather Clock. It was 5:51. He needed to be at the Ministry by 7 am. He could get there a little early.
“But how’d you get out?”
“Wait!” Harry said, “I actually need help with my Transfiguration.”
‘No!’ He thought. ‘I could have saved him!’
“Oooh, said with the confidence of a man who has his hands stuck in the cookie jar... in a cookie factory... and his pants are down... and they're on fire-”
No, not yet,
“Great.” Harry slugged his friend in the shoulder and together they walked out of the library.
Draco was trembling now. Too afraid to even twitch a finger.
Malfoy nods.
“Lumos.” I whisper. The cupboard light up and I grab a large broom from the back.
“Merlin Potter! Just do it!”
“Of course I am, Potter.”
He sat down next to her, trying to calm his nerves. “Uhh, what’s this about.”
Draco was also gripping Harry's shirt tightly as if scared he might be ripped away. Harry wrapped his arms around the Slytherin’s shoulder, and kissed back, hard.
They all went quiet, each in their own thoughts, until Hermione asked: “Is it Malfoy?”
Draco’s head was pushed up, and he was forced to look into snake-like slits of eyes. He could barely start to block his mind before Voldemort was inside his thoughts.
He was shocked when Ginny started asking Mr. Weasley about the newspaper. When he tried to warn her off, Mr. Weasley just chuckled and answered all of her questions.
Draco pushed himself off of the ground. “I was just standing there and you decided to Apparate. And you happened to appear right on top of me.” He snapped coolly, brushing invisible dust off of his robes, “And Potter you can stop laughing.”
“We forgive you.” He said, and Hermione nodded. Harry could tell that she was getting emotional as well.
“Where are you going for Christmas?” Ron asked.
Harry interrupted her with wide eyes, “What! He’s getting married?”
“You’re always the one doing nice stuff for me, so I wanted to change it up a little.” Harry said.
Harry’s anxiety was kicking in. But he did his best to push it away. Right now he had bigger things to worry about.
“I recently had a conversation with a third year girl.”
I stay silent, but it hurts.
“Sorry about that,” Harry responded, “I was just working on my potions essay with Malfoy.”
The two of them kicked off into the air. Knowing it would definitely be hard to see the snitch in the dark, Draco had attached a super, super tiny light to one of the wings that lit up whenever one of them was within ten feet of one of it.
“My task is to kill Dumbledore!”
“What do you mean?”
“Wh-What? No!” He stuttered. “Hermione’s just, umm, joking around?”
“Alright.”
He took a deep breath, bracing himself and walked over to her.
“In here!” He hisses.
“And why are you wearing clothes?”
“This is me and my husband Payton Sadder.”
“Then die.”
Hermione hesitated before speaking. “Wow Draco. I do not envy your position right now. Here's my advice: See how this case goes. I know what it’s like to lose connection with parents. My family was in Australia for a year before I found them again. That’s a story for another time. I think if you really think about it, you’ll find a way around this. And about Harry, if you really wanted to ‘shoot your shot,’ the best time to do it would be during this case.”
“Here you are dear.”
“Alright, I’ll go get them now.” Harry got up and walked toward the bar. And Hermione wasn’t wasting any time.
Harry fumbled for words.
Draco rolled his eyes trying to cover up the fact that he was shaking. “Glad you got a kick out of that.”
“Yeah.”
Memories whizzed by until Voldemort found the one he wanted.
“Hello Draco, Harry.” Hermione said smiling. She looked down at Draco’s hands then gave him a pointed look. He was suddenly aware that he was still holding Harry’s hand. He quickly snatched it back. He’s going to have to be more careful in the future.
Harry shot up, breathing hard, sweat making his clothes stick to him, his eyes wide open. He was gripping the sheets in his fists so hard that he could feel his knuckles start to get sore.
They appeared in a dark forbidding forest. Everything was silent. Not like a peaceful quiet, but more of a dark, creepy, you'll-all-be-dead-by-morning silent.
And Harry was idly twirling his wand, looking out the window, and lost in thought.
I take a step closer to him, “Why?”
Ron groaned and flopped down on the bed muttering, “Merlin’s tits help me.”
He kissed Harry Potter.
Draco dropped his book in surprise, “What?”
“Your so idiotic sometimes Harry. Remember that time you came over to the Manor after the war, and it just sort of happened? Well I counted you as my best friend at that point.”
Harry looked stunned, his eyes wide as he tried to process all the information.
Just then Hermione flounces into the hall. A new book in her hand. She looks very excited.
“Do you have a crush on me? Because Granger wouldn’t say that unless she had a real reason to. So do you have a crush on me?”
When Draco stepped into the dark room, he couldn’t see anything or hear anything.
“This is a public space! I have every right to be here.” Harry retorted.
“I’m sorry!” Harry said, “I need to help him with something.”
“Oh, I was just asking because you and Ginny broke up. It might be awkward for you.”
“Not… fair…” he spluttered.
“But are we really dating?” Harry murmured.
For the first time Harry looked up at his teacher. He was wearing dark purple billowing robes to match his magenta hair. He had glasses and a blue necktie, which was probably supposed to be hidden.
“Hey! You hypocrite.” Draco shouted, as Harry ran to get his broom.
“I’m so sorry.” I whisper. That’s all I can say. There’s nothing I can do to ease the pain.
Harry looked baffled, “Everyone has a patronus! Maybe you just haven't found yours yet. C’mon. Think of a happy memory and-”
“Wait,”
‘But what about what Quinn said.’ Says a voice in the back of my brain.
“Okay! I get it! I’ll answer your question!” Harry paused, it was now or never. He was about to lay his heart on the line, either it would be stabbed or… well Harry expected it to be stabbed; he didn’t expect Draco Malfoy to like him at all.
“Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, okay. But why did you? I never asked.”
Draco took a deep breath and focused with all his might on his memory: “Expecto Patronum!”
All the Weasleys turned to look at Harry. “I have a big announcement!” He proclaimed, “I am now dating Draco Malfoy.”
Draco shook himself out of his shocked state once again, and took charge. “Alright, send your patronus for backup. I’ll locate where the criminal is. Then we should go secure my mother.”
Draco tried not to visibly flinch.
I'll hold onto you,
I stare at him, mouth open.
He pulled up his sleeve to reveal the rest of the bandages. “I got them in the forest on the way here.”
Harry had had enough of this. He banged on the door, “Will you please let me in?”
With that he Apperated right into his dining room.
‘Is the school rebuilt enough? Would they have to do the rebuilding themselves? How many people were going back?’
Potter had come to his hearing as well as his mother’s. Potter had told the Wizengamot about how Narcissa had saved his life in the Forbidden Forest. Potter said that Draco was forced into being a Death Eater, and didn’t deserve the same punishment as his father.
“Did he hang out with us?”
Hermione nodded. Ron glared at him, “What’s this about?”
Harry rolled his eyes, stood up and said, ”Oh, get a room.” Before huffing and walking out the door.
I grin, “I distinctly remember saying: ‘I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.’ Well turns out I can't.”
I raise my head. My breathing is still quick.
Harry, Hermione and Ginny all burst out laughing at the same time. Ron was fuming with his arms crossed.
And there was someone there already. Not just anyone. A certain blonde Slytherin.
Narcissa nodded, “It seems alright to me.”
“Draco…”
This only seemed to make the redhead angrier. “You lost the motivation to /talk to me/?”
“You will be sitting with your own houses at meals though. Now if you all please follow me I will show you to your rooms.”
Harry sighed, “I know they will. But I’ve kind of gone and messed everything up anyway. So I’m not sure they’re even my friends anymore.”
Five minutes later, the tapestry opened. He heard two voices that he hadn’t in a while.
Harry rolled his eyes, “We didn’t ever really get back together anyway, so it wasn’t /really/ a breakup. I think it just all fell apart.”
“Thanks.” Harry bit his lip, unsure of how to ask, “Umm, how’s your mum?”
Why had Voldemort even let him live?
I do a double take, did he just make a reference from a muggle movie? Merlin’s tits he did!
Harry was so shocked he stopped walking, “What?!”
“But,” Harry continued, “I don’t want you to feel forced to stay here.”
He saw Crabbe fall.
What? Harry looked up. Draco Malfoy was sitting up and staring down at Harry with a look of amusement lit in his eyes.
“Okay, so last time, we played Never Have I Ever. This time we’re going to play Truth Or Dare-”
Harry whipped around, Draco was standing there with a smirk on his face.
“I’m not in love!” I insist.
They walked around the shop, looking at the different jokes and pranks. Harry found a fake scar and glasses resembling his signature look. Smirking he took the scar, walked over to Draco and stuck it smack in the middle of his forehead.
Both of them look at Harry, “Yeah?”
Harry held it out to him, “I don’t know why, but after the war I still wanted to use your wand, even though I fixed my old one. I just figured you wanted it back.”
“Draco, dear?”
It was all his fault. Malfoy had died and it was all his fault.
The third one snorted, “Fucking tranny. Just a boy pretending to be a girl.”
TW: panic attack and angst, mostly because I am incapable of writing a chapter that's free of angst, but you know...
I walk out of class still fuming. Quinn catches up to us. “Hey, Harry, Ron, did you see the new post on the bulletin this morning.”
It takes a lot of courage to continue a story that someone has already written. You have to read the books (or watch the movies) first, to gather information. And you have to think up a new plot line that hasn't been done yet. Or if your writing in cannon, you have to make up new scenes or improvise old ones. It takes a lot of skill, and ambition to do what you all are doing! Never let anyone tell you otherwise.
Yesterday, my neighbor walked in on me when I was writing. He asked what I was doing and I told him I was writing a Harry Potter fan-fiction. He gave me a weird look and asked, "Why would you want to write a story that was already written?" I tried to explain that is was a continuation of the story from different points of views. But he still thought I was crazy for writing such a thing.
Harry groaned. But Ron just shrugged and said, “Why not?”
Where did that come from?
Thanks for reading!
“Dare.” He finally said.
Then he tried desperately to reach for his wand but Harry was laughing and holding it behind his back.
I pat him on the back, “No big deal! Just know I’m here if you want to talk.”
“I swam. And I almost drowned.”
“Who's boyfriend?” Came a voice from the doorway.
Harry scratched the back of his head. “I don’t know. I didn’t really feel like it.”
Harry cut a slice for each of them. He was almost smiling too much to eat it. He finally had his best friends back.
“So this is why I have entrusted you with this special task.”
“POTTER LOOK AT ME! PLEASE STOP!”
It took him a minute but he was eventually able to breath. Draco got to his feet and brushed himself off: “I’ll get you back for that one. I have a couple of spells up my sleeve. Just wait, it’ll be you squirming on the floor next time.”
“How could I not realize? The moon represents time changing! So the Time-Turners are the most powerful under the full moon's light! And the next one is July 24th!”
Harry smacked him on the arm, and even that was enough to send shivers up the blonde’s spine. “No! I’ve dealt with plenty! This house to creatures is like raw meat to thestrals!”
“How’s that?” The second one mocked.
I'm not goin' down that easily,
Draco looked at him perplexed, but dropped it, “So, I didn’t know what to do when I realized I was gay. So I just started being extra mean to him. In hopes that he would notice me.”
“Why would Pansy send /me/ something? And why didn’t she send it to our house?” Harry asked, as the waiter walked away.
So Draco pretended to not see it as Harry shot forward. He slowly reacted, spinning around and watching Harry speed toward it. At the last possible moment the snitch farted away, causing Harry to give chase. Draco joined him, knowing that if he waited too long it would look suspicious.
“I don’t know what came over me.” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck, “I knew better than to bring up his dad, but I did it anyway.” Harry told them what had happened that morning on the Astronomy tower.
He was pulled back to the present as Pansy picked up her shot glass and downed it in shaking hands. When she put it back on the table she said, “I wasn’t planning on coming out like this, but what’s done is done.”
Ginny shrugged, “Sure. Do you want to go somewhere else?”
“Mother…” Draco said weakly, “I have a case…”
Harry shrugged, looking crestfallen. “It is what it is.”
Her eyes seemed to stare right into his very soul, and her tone turned serious.
Harry blinked in confusion. Then it slowly dawned on him and he started laughing. He even saw Malfoy crack a small smile.
“Merlin, Potter. Going so soon?”
Harry stopped his train of thought. ‘I did drag myself to go see her, didn't I? And I guess I do treat her like a chore. Fuck! Do I even love her?’
Hermione's eyes had a look of pity in them, so Draco decided to tell her the full story.
Draco sighed, he was getting more and more annoyed by the second, “I don’t need your schooling Potter. Can we please just get back to the wards?”
He smirks, “If I was, why would I admit it?” He takes a step closer. Into my personal space.
“Merlin Harry! You had us fooled. Everyone thought you were as straight as a board!”
What was stopping him from just going?
“Sorry about him.” Potter said nervously, “He’s just concerned. When he found out Fluer was pregnant he kind of got protective over everyone. He thinks that if he lets anyone down he’ll fuck up the whole family. But what he doesn't get is that everyone is already fucked up. I guess he’s just nervous. He really cares about his family. Oh shit, I shouldn’t have told you that.”
“He trusts me! I was chosen!”
“Now two things you can smell.”
“Or else what?”
“Wait, what?”
‘I wassss in a boxxx mossssst of the day.’
After a year of that, he had had enough. Draco had gotten a job out of pure boredom. It had been hard enough at home with all of the hate mail, but the glares at the Ministry were hard for him to bear. Even in his own Department hated him!
As he looked at the man standing across from him, he felt a thrill of terror.
Ron was staring at his girlfriend in awe. “‘Mione! When did you come up with this?”
I'll wait for you,
The person’s wand flares. Standing behind the small light of the wand, looking directly at me is Draco Malfoy.
Draco grabbed the collar of Harry's shirt, pulled him closer and slammed their lips together. Harry gasped as their lips connected. Draco kissed him with a passion that took his breath away. He tasted of cinnamon and coffee, and smelled of lemon and citrus.
Harry shifted his trunk uncomfortably. “Yeah, well. She and I aren't really dating.”
Harry raised his wand, and pointed it at the wreckage. “Wingardium Leviosa.”
Okay! This is the end! Wow, it's really ending. I've been writing this for months and I'm just surprised to see it ending. Anyway I hope you've liked the story thus far! I might add an epilogue just to wrap things up, but I think this is it.
I reach up and knock. Hagrid swings open the door so fast that I almost fall.
Draco blinked. What just happened? Why was Molly being so nice? Even after everything he had done to them?
I glare at them and they smirk. But Quinn is wrong. There is no way that I like Malfoy. He’s a bigoted jerk!
“Did you just say that you liked being my partner?”
Feeling very sleepy he buried his nose in Harry’s ebony hair. It smelled of the forest and pumpkin spice. A very good scent. He lifted his head and stared at the smaller boy before running a hand through his hair. It was soft and velvety and perfect. Just as Draco imagined it would be.
“Yeah, but imagine. We could have sneaked up to the Room of Requirement, and just shagged all day.”
“Are you sure?”
Harry heaved himself off of his mattress. Sighing, he walked over to the door, and pulled it open. Ron and Hermione were standing there looking anxious.
“Harry, listen to me! It is not your fault! The Dark Lord would have gotten you there one way or another.”
Nevil is running up to the Gryffindor table with a huge grin on his face.
Suddenly Draco’s wand started to vibrate violently. He froze. No. This couldn’t be happening. His breathing started to increase and his hands clutched the fabric of the couch.
“Are you sure about that? You faggot.”
He collapsed on the kitchen floor. Harry saw him return and smirked.
Draco could feel himself start to lose his temper.
He appeared in his dining room. His mother was probably already asleep, but Draco didn’t care. He stumbled blindly to his room, knocking over almost everything in his haste.
The time his handshake was rejected:
Harry’s eyebrows creased, “But… I thought… Blaise…”
“Yes.”
“Yeah…”
His voice was muffled when he asked, “You alright?”
He lets out a watery laugh and pulls me up into a hug. And then we’re laughing and crying and kissing all at the same time. The empty corridor, once devoid of any life, is now bursting with magic and emotion.
Draco nodded. “They did… unspeakable things.” He shuddered, “Not just to me, to every underage person there.”
Draco forced his face to remain like it was and mentally counted down.
“Can’t you tell by the look on his face?” Quinn says, throwing their bag down with a thud.
“Thanks Kreacher!” He called.
“My high hopes are getting low. ‘Cause these people are so old. The way they think about it all. If i tried I would never know. My high hopes are getting low. But I know I'll never be alone.”
“WHAT!?” Lucius bellowed. He looked outraged. A crazed look in his eyes. He obviously wasn't in his right mind.
If I'm being honest, I’m quite sick of his friends’ cat and mouse chase. I wish they could be more like Quinn and Pansy, they had straight up told each other. All that Ron and Lavender do is snog.
Harry hesitated, “No. No there’s not.”
They keep following me, so I hurry down the stairs to the third floor corridor. I’m almost running by now. My chaser is running too. This is odd and scary at the same time. Whoever it is seems smart enough to stay out of sight.
“Remember that time in the tree?”
“Yeah, but I didn’t think your mum was going to let you off so easy.”
“Is it okay if I call you Draco?”
“Umm okay?”
Even when they say there's nothing' left,
“If you feel that strongly, why don’t you take him to St. Mungo’s?”
“Is it Cho?”
“No! I don’t think he ever even was one!”
Harry turned, Malfoy was standing there bare-chested and looking furious.
Draco stops crying and wipes his eyes. “My bloody heroic, secret boyfriend. Imagine the books.” He lets out a hesitant laugh and stands up. “I know I can’t stop you, but I can at least do this…”
“I had the House Elves prepare some food for you. It would be rude if you didn’t eat it!”
He reached the third floor and spotted the one-eyed, humpbacked witch. Somehow still intact. He let out a small chuckle at the times when his worries were whether or not Snape had caught him in Hogsmeade.
“I’m glad.” Draco said, “We can show you around.”
“Mate, I know that you think he’s changed, but come on. He’s *Malfoy* for fuck’s sake!”
Harry shot his friend a grateful look, but then she smirked. “Let him spend some time with his boyfriend okay?”
Draco shakes as the tears flow freely, “I suppose I should have expected this. I think I knew all along.”
“Will you play this with me and mommy?” She asked. Draco looked down at the game she was holding up and smiled. It was a Harry Potter adventure game.
“It doesn’t start till 7 o-clock! You have time to eat. You need your strength if you're going to deal with criminals all day. Now sit your skinny arse down and eat.”
He smiled awkwardly and Draco felt his chest seize again. “Yeah, anytime.”
“Just tell me where he is!”
By the time Harry was finished, Draco was shaking with rage. How dare they do something like that! How dare they treat Harry like that! Not giving him food for a week! Harry was being abused and he didn't even know it! Dudley deserves the Curses set on him!
Silence.
“Three things you can hear.”
“What? What is it?” Harry sounded anxious.
Harry groaned, “Another fucking game?!”
The sentence they came up with was: ‘Are you ready to make an unbreakable vow?’
Harry could see the tears in the Slytherin’s eyes as he got up and quietly thanked Mrs. Weasley.
Draco had said way more that he meant to, so he turned his head away in embarrassment.
Malfoy shook his head, “I’m not the one to tell a secret Potter.”
“I suppose.”
Alright that's it.
They kissed as if their lives depended upon it. They only pulled away when Harry’s magic started to swirl around both of them. Deciding that he was not in a fit state to get laid, Draco rolled off of Harry and back onto the mattress.
Joey laughed a cruel laugh, “Yo Death Eater! Show us your mark!”
‘All your fault. All your fault. All your fault. All your fault. All your fault. All your fault.’
“Stop being so dramatic! It could be worse, it could be a dung beetle. Honestly it’s kind of funny. Hold on, I'm going to tell Ron!”
“Stalking Malfoy.”
Harry chewed on his lip, “You guys actually think I shouldn’t apologize?”
Malfoy gets up and walks back into the store cupboard.
Draco just sat there, trying to sort out what just happened. The confused look on his face just made Harry laugh harder.
“We show them what our fist can do!” Joey snarled. Then he spat right in Malfoy's face.
“Hey!”
“You have that love struck look about you again, Draco.” Lucius continued. He was slowly advancing, and Draco was suddenly aware that his back was against the wall.
“I'm not giving' up,
Ron walked up to them both and pulled them into a giant bear hug.
“Now name four things you can feel.” Malfoy instructs.
This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This-
“Have you ever wondered what it would be like to jump?”
They were standing in an eri looking field that was covered in headstones. A graveyard.
Voldemort pulled out of his mind. Draco’s whole body was aching. Although it was only Draco’s mind that Voldemort penetrated.
He walked over to the shack and ran his wand over the rotting wood. He picked up the same signatures as the hole in the tracks. He shook his head trying to comprehend what it meant.
He stepped cautiously into the dinning room. He looked around, but he saw no sign of movement. Letting out a breath he walked over to the corner.
Nobody volunteered.
“No.”
Draco looked down at the hand on his thigh, ‘How can it be okay?’ He thought. ‘My mother is in danger. Even with the wards.’
At about six o’clock another house elf named Ivy came by and told him it was time for dinner.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, “Honestly, you're so extra sometimes! It’s just a game!”
“Are you sure?”
“Nothing.” Harry said indignitaly. “We were just playing wizard chess.”
I can barely hear what Malfoy is saying. Because I’m panicking. We’re going to be trapped in here. In a tiny closet. And it’s all my fault. Memories come flashing back.
And I don’t know why. But I break down into tears.
Draco pointedly turned away and started working on the wards again. Harry didn’t bother him after that.
“Unless what?”
Harry looked up from his mashed potatoes.
Draco’s eyes did not leave Harry’s for one second. Harry’s magic was reaching its peak, and Draco was starting to feel faint. But he still didn’t break his stare.
As it disappeared out the window Hermione threw her arms around him, “Oh Harry!”
“So he’s still a Death Eater!”
“Well, the only reason I wasn’t was because of a stupid stuck up blonde git at a robe shop.”
He sat up and noticed that his left arm was wrapped up. He tried to get up off the couch but the world spun and he flopped back down feeling very undignified.
“Oh…”
Ginny came over looking mischievous, “So are you two together now or…?”
“Ahh, come to see the show?”
Draco had decided to go over to Grimmauld Place and prepare for the full moon, but to keep it professional.
Harry sighed, this was enough to convince him. “I probably should get this off my chest.”
Harry’s reaction was priceless. He jumped up and spilled the coffee all down the front of his shirt.
Hermione and Harry stared at Ron. “What? You two have never noticed?”
When Harry came back down, he looked uneasy. “There’s something banging around in the attic.” He said, “It could just be Kreture, but I think he’s back at Hogwarts. I have to send an owl to Ron. Do you mind having a look?”
Draco threw the Time-Turner around his neck. Harry pointed his wand at it.
He reappeared a second later. “It worked!” Draco croaked. Harry just gulped.
This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good.
“I was a Horcrux. I think it felt like my signature because at the time a little bit of Voldemort was trapped inside of me.”
Draco pretended not to hear him, “I have several ideas on how to remodel this place. I was wondering if you had any ideas.”
“Well, I’m glad you do. I don’t want to be the only one.”
But Luna seemed not to hear him and was already going on ahead, “Are you coming?”
I smile grimly, “It comes with being who I am.”
“Phrasing mate.” Quinn says, smirking and looking between the two of us.
Harry hesitated, he didn’t really know the answer to that question. “I haven’t really met anyone who wasn’t uncomfortable around the LGBTQ+ community.” He finally mumbled.
But Draco’s eyes hardened, having already made his decision, “No. No. I will get married to Astoria in two weeks, because that’s what is expected of me. I am a Malfoy. I can push away whatever feelings I have. If I don’t I will only end up getting hurt.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco sat up and took the package. He flipped open the top.
“Can you tell me 5 things you can see?” He asks.
Harry kept Hermione’s words in his brain as he walked up the long staircases of St. Mungo’s. It was almost too much to bare.
(See the end of the chapter for
In this next part you will see why Gryffindors have a reputation for being stupid and impulsive. Being a Gryffindor myself, I know I would probably do the exact same thing in this situation.
Harry turned, Slughorn was standing by the door, a smile on his face. “Why are you so late to class?”
Everyone was staring at her open mouthed, and Harry suspected that he was the only one that caught a flash of orange from another glass, but it was probably just a trick of the light.
“Did I ever tell you about the time I tried to become an animagus?”
As they hit the ground Malfoy whipped around. He spotted Harry and rolled his eyes.
He was just able to jump away when it exploded.
Snape gives me a nasty smile, “Potter. So nice of you to join us. As I'm sure you've heard, Mr. Malfoy here will be joining you.”
Draco was breathing heavily, and he felt faint.
Ron frowned, “But he still has the Mark.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, “Granger doesn’t seem like the one to ‘joke around’.”
Percy turned beet red, but Hermione continued. “Today is a day of friendship. Of happiness. But most of all, family.”
It was almost the end of the day when Mrs. Weasley brought out one final present, which she handed to Draco.
Harry looked rather uncomfortable as he said, “I don’t really know how these things work. But in an arranged marriage… isn’t it only to produce an heir?”
Draco expected his father to immediately curse him. Except Lucius wasn’t Lucius anymore, but a dementor.
“Well you don’t scare us.”
“I said I didn’t know!” Harry yelled, spinning around, “Let’s get back to class.”
Okay umm, this chapter isn't my best, the pacing is kinda weird. So is the dialogue. But you know, I don't have too much time to write anymore due to this thing called school. I wrote a completely unnecessary character in, mostly cause I'm kind of in a toxic friendship with a Lauren that I have no idea how to get out of! Yay!
“Yes.” Lucius looked down at the chain on his neck. Harry took it off and handed it to Draco who put it in his pocket.
Then Charlie asked a question that really got Draco’s attention.
Draco knew what he was about to say would wipe the grin right off his face.
During their dinner, the waiter returned several more times, bringing more and more letters. Harry was getting annoyed at the fifth, seemingly nonsensical word. That is, until Draco suggested that he put the words together in order, to form a sentence.
“Where are we?” He asked, turning to Harry, “This isn't anywhere I've been.”
“And it might help my mother get out of her bed.”
Inside was a Weasley Jumper.
Draco could feel his face turning red. “Whatever.” He mumbled.
He sighed as he felt Harry go limp in his arms. His green eyes were closed and he looked content. Just looking at him gave Draco a sense of security.
“Great. Amazing. Spectacular. Severus, you know me well enough by now. Since when have I given two fucks about my parents. I have a father who rapes and abuses me and a mother who doesn't care that he does it. They deserve to meet a sticky end.”
Draco leans back and looks at me. The desperation is clear in his gaze, “Please! There has to be another way.”
Harry saw where this was going. “Alright! Alright! I’m going! I'm going!”
Harry let out a sigh. Then he pointed his wand at the Time-Turner around Draco’s neck.
“What is that?!” Came Draco’s voice from behind him.
When they finally broke apart, Draco asked, “So are you going to bring your boyfriend?”
“So?”
Cosmo and Coco got ladders from the attic so they could reach up all the way. Cosmo ended up with his head stuck in one of the paint tins. It took Coco and Draco several minutes to get him unstuck. (Harry would have helped but he was too busy laughing.)
Ron turned to Hermione for help, but she was looking thoughtful. “You know… that day Ron and I went shopping… When Ron was in Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, I was in Florish and Blotts. And I saw him buying a first year all their books because they were muggleborn. He even gave their parents some extra wizard money.”
Draco shrugged, “I had a small nightmare.”
It’s all my fault.
“Here. I thought you might need it.”
All three of them burst out laughing at the same time.
“I would never have expected you to say that.”
“Okay, this should be all we need for now.” Draco said to Cosmo and Coco, taking two tins of paint. “Do you two want to help? I know Ivy doesn’t, she’ll hate getting dirty.”
Quinn is a fellow 6th year. They transferred to Hogwarts last year. They're from France, but something happened at Beauxbatons. They still won’t talk about it.
Harry gave him a reproachful look. “I’ve told you to stop saying that. We’ve been dating for what? Five years now? Potter just seems too juvenile for you.”
Draco sighed and looked up for his book. “What now Potter.”
I turn. Pansy Parkinson was standing there looking down her nose at me.
He felt drained and empty. He kept crying until he thought there were no tears left. But there were more. There were always more.
“Draco… I’m so sorry.” He said weakly, “I didn’t know I was capable of that.”
Harry looked at him for a second, then burst out laughing. But then he paused. “Wait, seriously?”
Potter was snapped out of his trance, “No. It’s just Ron has never shown any interest in being nice to you.”
Draco reached into his bag and pulled out a tiny guitar. Harry looked at it and smirked, “You carry that everywhere?”
“Stop calling me that. I wanted to ask you something.”
It’s a closet. I do *not* want to go in. But there's nothing else to do.
“Cosmo!” Draco yelled. A tiny house elf appeared in front of him.
“... Then I just leaned over and kissed him! I kissed him, mother! I’m getting married soon! I can’t go around kissing other people!” He was acting like a baby, but it didn't matter now because his mother was the most understanding person in the world.
Hermione seemed overjoyed. “Harry this is amazing! Did you finally realize what was going on in school!”
“Potter! Look at me.”
Harry saw Draco go ridged, then relax, “That’s right, I’m a Death Eater.” He scoffed, “So you’d better back off before I curse you. I’ve survived Azkaban once I can do it again. I’m not scared of the Dementors, I actually have some friends there.”
Harry grabbed the small cardboard box lying next to the pile and put it in his pajama pocket. He had noticed a couple of days ago that Hermione had a fancier velvet one next to her bed. He could only imagine what would happen on Christmas. Harry smiled knowingly, he had been waiting a long time for this day. Ron was in for a surprise.
Voldemort's voice no longer held wispy tones. It was harsh and it sent chills up Draco’s spine.
The other person drops down and I hold my breath, cursing myself for not having my invisibility cloak.
“Harry no!”
Harry smirked, “I’m going to tell her you said that!”
Harry slouched back in his chair, “You’re no fun.”
Harry froze, and just stared. Draco just raised an eyebrow, “You did remember that I was coming today did you not?”
Everyone gasped.
“Anytime.” Harry hesitated, wondering whether or not to ask, “What was that about?”
Ginny leaned over, apparently hearing their conversation, “Harry’s part of the family anyway. Mum'll be fine. She’ll just have to accept the fact that Harry and I broke up.”
Their attention was pulled back to the center of the room where Hermione was clearing her throat. “Today is a very special day.” She began.
Draco handed Harry the lily he had picked earlier. It was still dancing elegantly in his hand. The smaller man smiled softly. “I love you.” He whispered.
“Uhh, can we talk?” He asked.
Harry chuckled, and nodded. She dug around her bag and pulled out a trans flag bandana. “Can you sign this please?”
Draco lost it, “No, no. Your right. If I had left my mother in that situation, I would never forgive myself.” But he wasn’t crying about that. He was crying because Harry had just said that he really cared. He was crying because he had just realized how deep this was going to get.
It was Harry’s final move when he heard the compartment door open. Ron was standing there with a look of shock on his face.
Draco raised a slender eyebrow. “Yeah, suuuuure. Admit it. I’m not bad at all.”
“Well, why don’ you come in?”
Draco nodded, “Ivy and Dobby were my only friends as a small child, besides Greg and Vincent.” His eyes clouded as he remembered his lost friend, “When my father was sentenced with the kiss, we were told to let them go. But Ivy didn’t want to leave, turns out she was hiding her children here. Cosmo and Coco. So we let them say, I offered freedom again when I left for Hogwarts but Ivy refused yet again.”
“A lot. Trust me, I have mum magic.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened with horror, but he had to do it. His hand slowly moved off of his mouth as if pulled by an invisible hand. Then words were forced out of him.
Hermione gave her boyfriend a reproachful look.
“Draco Malfoy!”
“Thought I might find you out here.” She said.
“What?”
Ron let out a breath, “I suppose. And we can still enjoy this train ride right?”
Harry shook his head violently, “No! Never forget that she’s your mum. How do you think I got through all those nights on the hunt for the Horcruxes? I just thought about the people I was worried about! Being worried makes you braver. Trust me. I worried about nearly everyone. I even worried about you for Merlin’s sake!”
“When I was 7, my uncle and aunt brought me and my cousin to an amusement park. I was really excited to go. I had never been to one before. My cousin Dudley was really excited to go on one ride in particular. The ride was the one we’re sitting on. It’s called a Ferris Wheel.
Draco gave Harry an ‘are-you-stupid?’ look. “We could, but it wouldn’t be the best quality. And it would fall apart quickly, as it is magic and not real fabric.”
Harry winced, realizing what he had said, “You're right, I’m sorry that was very sexist of me.”
Draco snapped his head up and grabbed his files. “Yes?” He replied stiffly.
I freeze; I can’t take it anymore. There’s too much pain. I put my face in my hands. Tears fall from my eyes, and the Cloak falls off of my shoulders.
Harry wasn’t the only one coming for Christmas. Luna and her father were coming over midday. It was due to Ginny’s newfound homosexuality. Harry was proud of her, and he still loved her. But like a big brother. He still hadn’t really forgiven Xenophilius for ratting them out yet. But he managed to hold a civil conversation. Which is more than what Ron could say, he had started yelling at the man the first time they came over.
“Even the part when I said…”
“Oh Merlin!”
“Nothing can excuse what I’ve done, and I won’t try to defend it. But… I can try to explain.”
“Don't you dare!” Draco snarled. But he was too late. Harry’s silver dragon was already bursting from the tip of his wand.
Draco nodded, “My father used to hold huge balls and gatherings in here. Although it isn’t what it once was, it’s dusty and dreary.”
“Hey!” Ron shouted, throwing a hunk of cake at him, “That’s my girlfriend!”
Harry gave him a grateful look, “Thanks.”
He finally made it and collapsed on his bed.
A loud crack sounded behind him. Harry whipped around. Kreacher was standing there in his new clothes.
“Mate, I think you need to apologize to Hermione. You’ve been avoiding her for the past day, she’s worried about you.”
“What? Slower this time.”
Sure they all got in trouble from time to time, but the punishment was nowhere near what Harry endured in his childhood.
“I said you have to stop the Dark Lord.”
“Wow!” Harry said, obviously impressed. “Only your happiest memory can produce a full patronus on the first try!”
Harry was silent for a second, but there was something that had been eating at him for a while.
Draco cast him an unamused look. “What happened.”
“Harry dear,” Molly said, “So glad you could join us! Oh, and you too Draco!”
A couple of minutes later he heard Malfoy walk in. Harry was already in his bed and staring at Ginny’s dot on the Marauders Map. He sighed, turned out his wand light, rolled over, and tried to get some rest. Although it was doubtful that he would get any. He never got sleep anymore, not after the battle.
Harry’s face fell, “I have, actually.” His voice was soft and full of pain. Draco instantly wanted to curl up and hug him. “That time at the Ministry… I um, I wanted to save Sirius. But I ended up getting him killed.”
Draco looked up at him, “Hello.” He looked like he hadn’t slept in ages.
“Not you too!”
He wasn’t surprised when a few minutes later, Ron opened the door.
Harry sighs in relief, knowing that someone will support him in whatever decision he makes, is helpful.
Hermione’s eyes widened, “I should just let you two talk then…” she muttered. Then hurried out of the living room.
“Didn’t your mummy tell you it was rude to eavesdrop, Pottah? Petrificus Totalus!”
Draco thought Harry looked proud when he said, “Draco did you bring the Veritaserum?”
“Seem’s the Golden Boy had to save your pitiful arse again. Pathetic.”
He heard the dorm door creak open. He peaked out of the bathroom and saw Malfoy coming in with a tray of breakfast food. When he saw Harry in the bathroom he stopped dead.
Sure Harry and Draco might always be a little broken inside. They might always have broken eyes. But at least they had each other, and that was enough for now.
Once Draco was looking presentable again, he walked down the stairs and into the kitchen. Harry was standing by the window bent over the muggle machine. Sunlight streamed down making him stand out more than usual, and Draco found himself pausing just to look.
Silence.
