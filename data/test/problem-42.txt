"I do love riding things, Potter, but Merlin, not, a plastic horse mounted on an endless loop."
Harry squeezes Draco's hand. "I don't know. Just something for you, I guess. Because you're my happy ending, Draco."
"It's a Muggle theme park," Harry grins. "I've always, always wanted to go but the Dursleys always left me with Mrs. Figg when they'd fly away on holiday."
Draco pauses then leans into Harry.
"No, no, no. It's not."
"Alright, love?"
He perks up as if suddenly remembering something, and smiles.
"Hm. What is this for?"
The last line he says in a rush as Harry quickly pulls him out of the earshot of horrified parents putting their hands over the ears of their children.
"Oh Draco. Ever the pureblood snob."
"Ugh. Fine, Potter. Be that as it may, you still waylaid my plans. Thanks ever so."
As they are buckled into the ride, Draco is flippant, scoffing at the safety harness and Harry's persistent warnings. Over the next three minutes, Draco goes from disbelieving to terrified, clutching Harry's hand tightly. He fixes Harry with a look not unlike his reaction to Dumbledore's announcement of a troll in the dungeons.
"This enchanted castle can hardly compare to Hogwarts- and sleeping beauty being awakened by true love's kiss? What a disgustingly morbid idea and I once lived with the Dark Lord."
"Wherever would we find the time in our stateside vacation to go to this... Disneyland?"
"Potter," Draco drawls. "If I wanted to run around in an uncomfortably hot place filled to the brim with children, I'd have visited the Weasleys. This is our honeymoon, for crying out loud." He fails to mention that it is their seventh one.
"Never better, darling."
Silence reigns in their well-appointed suite.
"My mother would be incensed at the adulteration of perfectly good tea service! Hmph."
"Wait here, love."
"Love, we're still going to all of those you planned to visit. Just, erm, more museums in less days."
"Fine, Draco, if you're so bored, let's go ride Space Mountain."
They are in their luxurious suite, booked through Draco's good taste and connections, of course, when Draco espies a suspiciously colorful envelope.
All is well in the world.
Draco stills. "You. What?"
"Don't let Granger in here. She'll mistake those little green... aliens as house elves and convince herself she has to free them."
"Our tickets to what."
On the day of their Disney visit, Harry and Draco walk hand in hand to the theme park, Harry gently rubbing the platinum band on Draco's ring finger. It is a hot day and as it is very close to the 4th of July, the park is packed with visitors.
Draco raises an eyebrow superciliously. "
"Something for you to wear."
Despite the tension in the air, Harry graces Draco with his easy grin. "You do like doing things more efficiently, love."
"Don't be ridiculous, Draco, Harry teases. "This place is not just the happiest. It's magical."
A small smile escapes Draco's lips. "You better."
"You say that now, Draco," Harry warns.
"Potter. What is this?" Draco intones, rifling through the envelope and holding out two shimmery, brightly-colored pieces of paper.
Draco and Harry are on their seventh honeymoon in as many years. It is never just a vacation. They always call their yearly outings a honeymoon, to the peril of any of their friends who say otherwise.
"Disneyland! The happiest place on earth of course."
He leans his head on Harry's shoulder as they wait for the sunset Disney parade to come their way.
Sighing, Harry pulled out a fresh sheet of parchment and a quill just as Ron and Hermione walked in and sat down next to him. There was an awkward silence between the three of them before Professor Binns began speaking in his usual dull voice, and they began taking notes. Harry wasn't sure what was going on with him and his friends, there was no familiarity like there was last year, in Harry's opinion anyway. Hermione tried, a little too hard maybe, but things were just different. Harry was different.
"Yeah, it's me. Now either help me find my glasses or get lost."
"You alright, Harry?"
He quickly fixed his chair and got out his Defense Against the Dark Arts textbook, as well as a fresh sheet of parchment. He pulled out his quill and examined the nub that was already looking sketchy. He hadn't bothered to buy a new one for the year, seeing as he already had a few unused ones in his trunk. Deeming it alright, for the time being, Harry inserted the dull tip of his quill into the ink well and started on his homework.
"Just curious," Harry replied with a shrug.
"Oh look, you've spotted the problem. Don't
"Isn't there? While you were standing around, I was getting beaten to a bloody pulp! What happened to you, Draco; you're different this year! You don't pick fights with Potter, you don't even speak to him, and I'm starting to think you're actually avoiding him!"
Already exhausted, Harry slipped into unconsciousness, being graced with a few hours of peace before the nightmares corrupted his sleep.
"I quite like the class actually, it's interesting if you pay enough attention. Although, Professor Binns's voice does tend to make me quite sleepy sometimes." Harry was shocked, to say the least. No one he'd ever met, not even Hermione, enjoyed History of Magic.
Madame Pomfrey left after checking over his injuries, deeming him fit to leave in the next few days. Great, just what he needed. He always struggled more with homework when he had to learn everything himself instead of in class, not that he paid much attention most of the time.
Apologies for how short this chapter is but I've been stuck for a while and I wanted to get what I had out there! Hope you guys enjoy :)
And he thinks that he maybe wants a new pet. What with all the kitten genocide and squashed toad imagery floating about in his semi conscious state lately.
Draco was curled into himself on the floor. Muttering. Tears streaming without any apparent acknowledgement, but he didn't come here for acknowledgment. He came here to be scolded. Harry was sick of seeing it. Sick of applying the fucking salve, of rescuing him from a thousand little ruthless fires with no clear way out in sight. Just smoke after the storm, and it kept filling up the spaces between them until Harry had started to wonder if Draco could even see him choking anymore.
She looked equal parts offended and confused.
So he took a deep breath (it tasted musty and as old as he felt) and pushed open the heavy double doors to the gallery.
He slung his arm back over his eyes and sighed - deciding that woeful maiden was rather fitting for the occasion actually.
And wasn't this all Malfoy's fault to begin with, now Harry was thinking about it?
Hermione did not, in fact, murder him in the middle of dinner. It was much worse than that. She

He sighed around his mashed potato "Yes Proffessor."
Perfect fucking timing.
"Tuesday, February 2nd, 1978." But it sounded like she wasn't sure. Almost a question. Draco hoped to the gods he didn't rely on that she was, in fact, quite mad.
"No! Stop guessing Luna! It's still not Luna! In fact, please stop guessing entirely." Harry flopped back on the sofa, arm flung over his face like some woeful maiden in an old painting.
"Go on then, tell me." Harry said, a little annoyed at how easily he'd given in.
Covered in orange slime and smelling of old carrots.
Maybe it's time he stopped letting Hermione fight everyone else's battles alone. He wished he'd noticed properly. That in the background to her own war, Hermione fought for people less fortunate than even she had been made under Voldemort's reign. Because it was

of Malfoy's confession. He thought it was very impressive of him indeed, as he didn't have the best track record of ignoring any sort of implications about his school rival.
"Am I? Really Potter? You have the gall? I know I said do what you will, but there's no need to rub it in! especially with collateral. You had no right to bring Theo into this, he didn't even fight on our side." He was so venomous. Harry knew it was coming from a place of pain, of protectiveness this time so he couldn't even bring himself to bite back. How could he? This was so fucking unfair, and he'd already been made to feel like an ignorant child today and he was really really-

The blonde was pacing like a mad genius on the brink of a solution.
Harry greeted the stupid over-the-top shoe rack with his shin, as he stormed through the hallway; half out of breath and run ragged. It still felt ridiculously out of place if you asked him, like something out of a garish pureblood version of IKEA. It would make a lot more sense, and far less bruising, to just get rid entirely if you ask him - which Narcissa Malfoy definitely would

He vaguely wondered if they all actually knew about each other's silent conversations, and just gave one another the illusion of privacy.
work on that. Hermione will know how to fix it though.
"Malfoy have you been sleeping? Like at all? You sound mental. And I don't want anything from you, it's fine."
"No!" But he'd managed to poke himself quite nastily in the eye in his mad rush to appear stable. It did not help with the leaking it turns out.
He'd just sort of, maybe, kind of, a bit outed Draco Malfoy hadn't he? Almost?
And Draco always asked him, didn't he? Expected him to know the answers.
He really was doing very well.
Turning around very cautiously, but not at all like a scared thing. Like in a 'don't set the mental growling bloke off' sort of way. He couldn't blame him, not really. But he bloody well wanted to anyway.
He really liked being just Harry to him, and that was always going to be enough really wasn't it?
Nott really did look in a bad way. And he felt like he was imposing on a very private moment. So he nodded briskly.
Draco blinked.
Well, family didn't tell each other

Harry stopped dead halfway to the tower.
"Well...yes of course." This seemed to appease her.

"Potter?" He made his exasperation all too clear.
"Harry...I'm sorry. You just never know with things like this."
The pompous tosspot shrieked about 4 octaves higher than Harry thought possible for human recognition, and he thought that a little fire now and then was perfectly fine actually, if you asked him.
Especially not the Headmistress, who had chosen that exact time to return from the staff rooms to collect last week's assignments.
She looked ashamed, and was doing the quiet sad thing again. Harry considered briefly that he was being a bit over the top, blowing it out of proportion, but he didn't care right now. Didn't want to anyway.
out of his mouth. Like an idiot.
And then everything disappeared.
Needless to say, he did not exactly fix things with Malfoy.
It was all over the school that Harry Potter; saviour of the wizarding world, vanquisher of dark lords, had almost died.
"Potter." Malfoy gave a tense upwards nod of acknowledgment, and gracefully manoevered around the ragged mess that was posing as Harry today.

"It's quite all right, I assure you, I've had worse." He tried for a kind smile, but he was worried and confused and not sure what in Salazar's balls was going on here.
"So, yes. And don't argue, I'm looking for absolutely nothing from this, I expect nothing at all will change for me. I'm well aware that for you it won't repay all that much, but I think you can appreciate Potter how absolutely damning and horrifying this admittance is for my already shattered reputation."
Harry was mortified. He hadn't even noticed. It can't be that much, he wasn't that out of it was he?
He shook it off and kept walking,
"I always come back."  He tried for softly but it came off condescending, as soothing attempts are wont to when hindered by exhaustion.
"Alright mate?" Ron rested his hands on his now pajama-ed  knees as if ready to spring into action whenever.
She looked altogether uncomfortable, turning her bushy head towards the fire, letting out a soft hum.

at another breakdown. He didn't fancy another night like that anytime soon.
Malfoy had looked stunned though, it was almost worth pretending it was intentional before running off with his tail between his legs.
"Miss Granger." She boomed, echoing around the room. Picking up on the humourless tone, and doing a great job of joining the party by rising to the challenge. "What is the meaning of this?"
This had to be a joke, didn't it?
had he forgotten how this felt? How could he ever feel tired with

"Right, yeah. It's fine. Don't be cruel, got it." He rose from the sofa, trying to keep his anger in.
"Potter? I don't know Malfoy, I suppose he's in Herbology...with the rest of the Gryffindors. Are you quite well in the head?" The boy spoke as if talking to a troll, and Draco instantly wanted to dunk his head in the cauldron beside them.
He tried not to cling to the handkerchief, but instead ended up shoving it in his pocket and clinging to it there instead.
He should
He thinks he might have won their exchange though. Left with a token and everything. He rubs his thumb over the (silk?) Handkerchief hidden away in his pocket.

"Are you okay?" He said as sincerely as he could, and finding that oddly, it wasn't actually that hard to pull off.

"Yes well. It's your information to do with as you wish. Feel free to get promptly obliviated Potter by all means, I encourage it, but I
But he pulled out what looked like a very fancy handkerchief. An embroided handkerchief at that. Because of course Malfoy had an embroided handkerchief.
His eyes were silver when he cried,
He couldn't breathe. The walls were spinning and he was
"Malfoy! Malfoy, wake up!"
Okay, it was a bit annoying.
Harry's jaw dropped open, stunned
He couldn't seem to help it that, when he did eventually fall asleep in the early hours of the morning, he did so blaming Draco Malfoy.
Harry thought back to when it was.
"Ah." He said "-And who am I?" He had an inkling of course, given the date. Yet he held onto some flimsy idea that he had at least carried through a fragment of his own reality into this glimpse of the past. He had remembered catching sight of his orange speckled reflection in the girl's cauldron, and he seemed to be himself. Until-
Harry felt like such a wimp, but it meant the world to him that they were always there when he fell. Always came back.
"I know." He said. Even though sometimes he really didn't.
He daren't even look at Ron he was so ashamed.
"I'm a what Potter?" Malfoy had that look he always had when he was challenging him, when he thought he was going to win, that Harry would back down. It only struck him now that maybe...Malfoy never wanted him to back down at all.
Hermione almost-whispered "

it, and in the wrong direction. It twisted Harry's heart.
"Don't worry about it, I'm just tired. Just going to bed. Night Hermione." And he headed up the stairs, feeling both attacked and guilty all at once.
She tucked a stray curl behind her ear "You don't have to tell me."
Ron had put a comforting hand on her shoulder that she seemed to relax into, halting her flow. "Give him a chance to breathe yeah?" But he squeezed her hand and smiled so fondly at her.
The blonde Ravenclaw girl vanished the pus. The brunette looked like he'd been made to eat it. Draco was used to this, he'd dealt with it all eighth year, and on a much larger scale. Until Harry...
"That you fancy me." And Harry somehow managed to make a mockery of a casual shrug.
If this
he cursed at himself.
But Draco was. Again.
Draco let out a derisive snort, but was trailing his fingers along the dusty floorboard by his knee, not meeting Harry's eyes.
Instead Hermione had taken both of his hands in hers and climbed onto the bed with him. Which was normal. Fine. Good. Apparently.
Hermione snapped her fingers in front of his face "Harry you're not even listening to me are you? Harry?"
And tweaking, probably.
"Harry, mate,

"Potter?" But it wasn't as tense, just a bit concerned - not friendly concerned, more '
"Right. Yes. Well, good."  Malfoy attempted to bolster himself, to no avail. He'd looked shocked Harry hadn't attempted to argue more, disappointed even.
As if on cue, Malfoy sauntered into the great hall, Theodore Nott trailing along beside him. That was a new development as well. Nott and Malfoy, being all chummy. Most of the Slytherin 7th years hadn't returned this year - but apparently Malfoy's attendance, and completion, was a mandatory part of his sentance. He'd narrowly escaped Azkaban because of his age, and Harry's testimony. That was probably what Draco meant when he was talking about

Harry was starting to get impatient.
How had this turned inside out so quickly?
, he thought dreamily,
He'd never felt so grateful and so foolish all at once.
"That's why I've got you." He smiled. A dark little in-joke they'd started falling back on a while ago. The script remained the same, but the tone rarely did. It was all thin lines from here whilst Harry tried to bridge the gap with whatever was at hand.
that couldn't he? He wasn't in school anymore. Except...he seemed to be wearing a Slytherin tie.
There was only so long that could last.
Ron looked at him with an expression so fiercely grateful that it tugged at his heart in an almost overwhelming way.
Well he wasn't about to start now.
"That's a despicable thing to say out loud boy! Wash your mouth out at once you wretched thing!"
Harry thought the 'Mr' might have been overkill, but he'd never been good with authority.
"I'm sorry, what are we discussing?" Maybe Draco was the slow one, he thought, but concussion can do that can't it?

have been in any other circumstance. But no-one was laughing.
, Harry hoped, staring blankly at where Malfoy had been standing.
"Yes, yes alright then."
He went towards the direction of the horrid old Gallery full of horrid old Malfoys, following the tell-tale trail of destruction. He was so damn tired. What time even was it? He didn't suppose that it mattered. He was supposed to have clocked out at 2am. Was it 2am? Or much later? He would just like to know whether he was late or early once in a while, feel a little less like there was something he was missing.
"Lavender?" Hermione smirked without looking up at Ron.
"I, um-"
"Sorry, no. Nevermind." He rubbed his hands over his very tired face and sighed.

It was worth it for the look on Malfoy's face, he looked like he'd swallowed a toad.
This actually wasn't really his fault was it?
"Aren't you?" Harry held his breath and tried to pretend he wasn't. There were so many ways it could go with questions like that, and he wasn't sure how many of the bad ones he had the energy for anymore.
"Luna?" Said Ron, for the

_________________________________________
It turned out that the girl's name was Eponine Litz, 7th year Ravenclaw and frequent apologiser.
Hermione went quiet in that gut wrenching way and Harry felt like a monster.
Harry was starting to feel a lot like a broken toy if he was being quite honest with himself.
Just when Harry thought he couldn't get more dramatic shit buried away in his head.
He needed to get a grip. Or some sleep. Whichever came first, he thought as he dashed out of the room, apparently not fast enough as he felt another, less friendly, grip on his arm.
Harry wondered, mortified, for a second that Hermione may have somehow guessed correctly who the person was without letting on in front of Ron. Why else would she warn him not to be cruel?
She still looked determined, and was talking in hushed tones with Nott - who Harry had now noticed was shaking. Malfoy was standing just off to the left, seemingly giving the two some space. Now glaring not-so-subtle daggers in Harry's direction.

"Yes."
Wait, weren't tokens the thing that ladies gave to the knights or something? He must be remembering that wrong. Ugh. Either way he needed sleep.
"Harry?" Hermione looked up from her Potions essay in alarm.
"I-have-been-attracted-to-you-since-4th-year."
"Of course, I'll see you at lunch?" He made sure to sound cheerful, to convey that he didn't want to fight anymore and hopefully that he was sorry too.
Harry hardly slept a wink that night.
"I promise Malfoy, please just believe me? I haven't slept in days and I'm just exhausted. And I'm not a shitty person okay? I don't care that you're...you're." Oh no, why now? Why couldn't he just say it? Was he actually a bit of a shitty person after all?
Malfoy seemed very amused by the newly blushing Harry, and Harry very much did not approve.

Malfoy, however, appeared not to notice the side effects.
Harry thought she ought to know. She knew him better than anyone, and this stung.

afraid.
Of course he was going to tell her. She was
things.
It wasn't kind, or warm, it was just a plain matter-of-fact admission, but it meant the entire weight of words in moods like this. Harry knew that, and as he breathed out he found that he still cared just as much.
He responded with a little disappointment in his heart, “I will not murder Rita Skeeter without your permission.” He took a deep breath and asked, “you ever read the article she wrote on me after my family was killed?”
Draco and his partner came by. He told them, “congratulations. I didn’t think anyone was that brave.” His partner made a smile but it was obvious it was fake. She didn’t say anything mean though.
Arlene Pov.
Arlene asked, “so, are you in the mood for some of your own dances?”
He was still confused. “Lily, I don’t understand. Please talk normally. Please tell me you love me.”
Arlene smiled, this was too easy. “Yesterday, today, and tomorrow. You’re off your game raven.”
Luna suggested, “maybe you’re going for more than one day? It is a long way away. Maybe he thinks you’ll need more than one day of looking.”
He pulled Harry’s invisibility cloak from his robes and put it over himself. He moved closer to the dragon. She didn’t seem confused. Her eyes roughly followed his location. Hermione had predicted this. Dragons could smell well and with the crowd silent like this she might be able to hear his feet kicking rocks around. Which led to the second part of his plan.
The crowds were smaller than normal. People were walking fast in groups. They made their way to Gringotts to get their money. Wizard guards flanked the entrance to the bank. The goblins hadn’t changed much. They still loved Arlene and treated her with respect. Over the summer she had learned some Gobbleygook but was only able to say some sentences to them. They were still more than happy to hear their native language.
Yeah,” was all she could say. “That was incredible.”
Not wanting her to be upset, Ginny put a reassuring hand on her shoulder and told her, “It’s okay, we’ll have a good time no matter what happens.” She didn’t know how. “I’ll make sure of it.” She wasn’t sure if she could actually make that happen.
Still some of the magic remained. Just knowing that someone was there who wanted to be with him. Someone who accepted and cared for him. It was nice. More than nice but that was the best word he could think of to describe it. After all this time he had finally confessed to Harry. A great weight had left his shoulders. A constant warmth filled him.
She glared at him and asked, “now?”
He didn’t hesitate. He began working to stop the bleeding with magic. Joan slipped in next to him and began working to dull the pain. His screaming subsided to moans as the pain dulled. For what had just happened he seemed to be holding up well but they had to keep him calm. He stopped the bleeding and conjured a stretcher.
Adrian kept the conversation moving, “since we don’t know all the details and we’re all convinced that he’s returning anyway, we decided to make it on our terms. Resurrect, trap, interrogate. Beating him in a duel, even for me, is not the best approach. We’ll trap him and get the answers we need from him.”
Arlene didn’t respond. She didn’t like just how devoted to the glory the girl behind her was. The headmaster and the two men from the ministry finished talking and Dumbledore announced, “there has been a major change in the rules after much deliberation. A review of the schools’ curriculums have found that some age groups may be more appropriate now than before.” He took a breath then let drop, “the minimum age to participate is now thirteen.”
Luna nodded and went around saying bye to the Weasleys. Arlene did the same. Saying bye to Ginny was the hardest. They hugged for nearly a full minute before breaking apart with Ginny saying, “I’ll see you on the train platform. Don’t do anything dangerous while I’m not around to save you either.”
She sat up and stretched. Luna shifted beside her but did not wake. She had the most dream-like expression on her face. Arlene stared at her for a minute then realized what she was doing. Her face got warm and she got up to get dressed.
The paper crumpled in her iron grip. She threw it at the desk and stormed out. There was no point talking to the ghost about it. He probably didn’t even know that his notes had been altered.
The two ladies glanced at each other and they both understood that Hagrid fancied Madame Maxine. The two of them left Hagrid to his date and went back to the castle.
“It was a pain just getting out of here and even worse coming back. Unbelievable, wizards think they own everything. I mean peacocks! In the middle of the path!”
He asked, “you know a spell that can stop a bullet?” Then he began walking in the direction of the bangs. More screams followed as he walked off to investigate.
Adrian walked in and answered, “the Triwizard tournament is a nightmare. Arlene was supposed to fail because she didn’t want to be in it. Then she goes and gets first place.” He waved to Remus who was wearing clothing similar to Sirius. “Harry is healthy and fine. He’s moving on to the second trial. Not bad in his studies but I do wish he had taken alchemy. Great art, not sure why he didn’t want to study it.” He pulled out the vial of his blood and put it on the table. “How are you two doing? Is the relationship good?” They looked panicked before he said, “I don’t care if you’re gay. Just don’t try to convert me. It is obvious though.”
"I wasn't trying to humiliate you or whatever you expect of me Malfoy." Because he just didn't have the energy to stay angry very long anymore. Right now all he felt was sad, and a little bit lonely.
Is this really what people thought of him? Some hot headed arbiter of justice or some nonsense like that? Or worse, someone who judged people based on ... things like that? Hadn't he just won a war over that sort of shit? What more did he have to prove?
Malfoy had eyes likes Sirius. Why hadn't he noticed that before?
"Fucking always, you melodramatic prick. Now can we go home please?"
Hermione had stayed up after Ron went to bed to talk to him privately. It was just as uncomfortable as he'd known it would be when her and Ron silently decided it was going to happen half an hour ago.
"Oh?" Malfoy looked bemused, but seemed to be trying his best not to quirk his lips.
He always sounded bored when he asked that, always like he didn't care what the answer was. As though they'd been playing a childish game of emotional chicken, waiting for the other to cave.
___________________________________________
"You're...you're Lucius Malfoy." She said, with no hint of irony.
"Marcus just needed to wash his mouth out is all, he said some particularly inexcusable things to his fellow classmates, didn't you Marcus?" Marcus was in no position to argue. Harry wouldn't have if he was him. Hermione could be terrifying.
He laid back on the bed and told her, “the water is safe and there’s soap and shampoo in the bathroom. I’ll let you go first.” He pulled his suitcase from his pocket and made it full size. She put hers on the floor and he made it full size too. She went to the bathroom and got cleaned up. She came out in different clothes.
She only then realized that most of her body had an aura around it. An orange energy had surrounded her. Faint except to anyone who was close. She relaxed and the aura faded. Her breathing settled and she felt better. She hadn’t realized how angry she had been at seeing her history hidden. “Professor Binns’ notes have been altered. When I learned the small amount I did from my book I learned how involved in creature affairs my family was. My family would’ve played a major role in the war we learned about.”
Meanwhile Arlene had a free period. She was ahead on her homework so she went to the library. She went to the history section and looked for books specific on enemies of her family.
She told her, “Arlene, if you’re in danger and the only way out is to use your magic, then use it. You have every right to live and fight for your life. Don’t worry about anything else. No matter what you do I’ll be by your side.” Her voice held up a little. Then she fought passed it to say, “cause you’re the daughter that I never knew I wanted.” Her eyes went wide. Joan had let it out. There was no going back. They were a family and that was that. “No matter what you do I’ll be by your side. So do whatever you have to do to survive.” She gave a weak smile. “If you can, do try to avoid using your magic. Or at least hide it. Hold your wand and try to make it look like you’re casting normal spells.”
He killed two. One popped out from behind a grave behind him. Adrian grabbed his hand and broke his arm at the elbow with a heavy strike. Adrian snatched the wand from his hand and used it to Reducto the death eater’s head.
The doors were closed but unlocked. None of the beds had curtains around them. Some of the patients were awake and talking to each other. She walked up to Bastion’s bed first. He lay fast asleep. It made sense if what Madam Pomfrey said had been true. After being awake most of the night then he would need rest.
In that moment he was truly impressed by her intelligence. He had known she was book smart and talented. Being able to deduce something that he had found out by accident was quite the feat. He smiled at her and pulled a jar from his pocket. Inside of it was Rita Skeeter in her beetle form. He commented, “I think this will suffice as evidence. You really are one of the brightest students here to figure out something I found out by accident.”
He turned to her with a surprised look on his face. Luna had a similar look on hers. It was rare when Luna was that surprised. He turned red in the face and asked in a soft voice, “r-really?”
The relief of years of pent up stress finally being freed was too much for him. Tears flowed openly from his eyes. He held himself as he wept. Years of repressing his true self. Every hour of every day pretending to be something he wasn’t. Living with a family who would hate him if they knew who he really was. It had been so hard living this way. To finally be able to express himself. Even in this small moment. It was such a relief to his mind.
An explosion of noise entered the clearing as six massive cages and dozens of wizards entered the clearing at the same time. Charlie charged forward to help the others wrangle the dragons. Roars of anger and rage shook the forest.
He didn’t answer for a minute. The only sound was the crunch of the snow. He told her, “the things I want can’t be found in a book.” He was silent for a few moments before saying, “I just want to protect my kids and my students. I want my life to be relaxed. Eventually, I want to retire and sit on my beach all day without a care. Just happy that I’ve done everything I can to make the people I love and care about happy and safe.” He looked at her and apologized, “sorry, the wants and fears of adults are usually more concepts than physical things. The result of things getting more complicated.” She stopped in her tracks. He stopped almost immediately and asked, “what’s wrong?”
Hagrid came over. He walked over to Luna first and asked, “are you alright?”
He didn’t summon an extra log for the fire. He didn’t go get another from the pile in the corner. He did nothing to stave off the coming cold.
He knocked on the door to their house. Sirius answered the door in an open shirt and surf shorts. He opened the door and said, “come in. How’s the school?”
Joan peeked her head out of the tent and asked, “Was that a firework?”
Ginny instantly shot back, “why? Are you going to go find one for us?” They all laughed as he went red in the face.
She told him, “I apologize, only those living locally can check out books. For a price you can receive a copy of the books you would like. Unless they are on the banned list.”
Ginny went along with his plan. He had a solid point. She did ask, “what about Skeeter?”
Nothing had stopped her yet. That was until she peeked around a corner and saw several lobster looking creatures scuttling around. She pulled back until she heard a snap. Her foot had broken a branch.
Luna asked, “are you expecting someone, Hagrid?”
Bets went all around the camp. Fred and George were all over the place trying to make ridiculous bets with anyone who would listen. Some were even for specific events or scores. Arlene found the whole idea ridiculous. She had no interest in bets.
He found and killed the werewolf. He could not go back truly empty handed though. He would live but only to be beaten and tormented in the name of making him stronger. Adrian came up with a terrible idea. Michael believed in Death as an entity. Adrian was a talented alchemist even now. So he did the unthinkable. In an alchemic circle he put the head of the wolf, an egg, and a dying flower. Life in its full cycle. Then he activated the circle with the idea of summoning death itself.
He looked several years older as he explained, “this tournament isn’t the joke they’re making it out to be. It’s dangerous. People have died in it before. I can’t sit by and watch any of you die over a,” he spat the next words, “fucking game.”
“Hagrid you can’t spend your whole life hiding from the world. You have to get out and live life. Trust me I know that.” He let out an exasperated breath. “The people who matter to you have actively tried to reach out to you. They want to be your friends and still care about you. Please open up to them.”
Hagrid shook his head. After another drink he said, “I know too many things happened at the end of last year. Things that didn’t need to happen. I think I did hear about someone taking a student off grounds and Professor Barnes going after them. I didn’t know that it was you Arlene. I’m sorry.” He took another drink from his mug.
In the end none of it mattered. Lily died and James’s son survived.
They had the fence line to themselves. Luna had led them to the least popular spot to look at it from. It didn’t have a great view but they were guaranteed to be alone for a while. The sky was partly cloudy. Just enough to keep the sun from blinding you but not too much to make it gloomy. There was a constant gentle breeze. They had thin jackets on to keep them comfortable. A supply of wonderful smells was being supplied by the village. It was a wonderful day.
Author gave a fake smile and responded, “Lucius, always a joy to see you. No need to sell my house since I don’t spend all my money on hair products.”
The obstacle course was a massive pit of rocks and dirt. There was a climbing section all the way across the middle that stretched about twenty feet high. There were several gaps and mud pits. The formations were so high that she couldn’t see what was at the other end. Although, she had a feeling it was something to do with the troll.
Luna reassured him, “you at least had the courage to ask her Neville. Not many would have that.”
Two minutes later Professor Dumbledore approached them and said, “I have full faith in you three.” His eyes were firmly on Harry. “Good luck. Make us all proud.” He walked away. Mr. Bagman came up and let Harry in first. Ron was next. A minute after Ron went in Arlene was allowed to enter the maze.
A week later Arlene still hated this tournament. No matter where she went she received sneers and glares. Some people even made badges that read, “Weasley is our king,” or, “Potter you rotter.” There were less of them but Arlene saw some about her. “Connery the dummy,” was a popular one. She hated it of course. It didn’t even rhyme like it wanted to.
Fred reminded him, “that’s a bit dangerous. Might want to tickle someone else.”
She looked at him and asked, “when did you go to Giza?”
Adrian’s heart rate was still coming down and he told her, “I think good is an understatement.” She laughed and nodded against his chest. “I might pass out for an hour or so.”
She shrugged and walked in. She sat on the bed as she told her, “I passed all my exams. I knew I was going to but it was nice to take them.” Luna took her hand. “How do you feel about the last trial?”
“Are you okay?” Joan asked with concern written in her eyes.
He led her out of the ballroom, through the Great Hall and into the entrance hall. From there they went outside. They found themselves surrounded on all sides by hedges with a fountain in the middle. The fountain was ten feet of unicorn with a continuous jet of water coming from the horn.
Arlene grabbed an apple and left the tent. It was still early enough for there to be a chill in the air but now the smell of smoke from wood fires was filling the camp. She took a bite from her apple and reached into her pocket for some warmth. Her hand met something unexpected. It was the wand she had gotten from Ollivander’s years ago.
Draco recoiled and raised his wand instinctively. Snape flashed his out and disarmed Draco in the same motion. He fell to the ground and raised his arms to protect his face.
She smiled at him and said, “a girl has her ways.”
He actually blushed and answered, “o-oh, I just did a lot of practicing in my spare time. I’ve always had a rhythm for music. It helps plants grow.” His blush went away as his voice grew in confidence at the idea of plants. Everyone knew that Herbology was Neville’s favorite subject. It was also his best subject.
McGonagall’s eyes widened but she didn’t have to answer. Skeeter entered the room yelling, “Dumbledore, I thought the champions would be safe. What happened in the arena? Perhaps you’ve lost your edge?”
He gave her a nervous smile and said, “I don’t like the sight of blood. I wanted to help despite that.”
He swooped towards her then backed off. She shot a jet of flame at him. He moved to the side but was still covered in a sheen of sweat from it. It was so hot.
Draco stopped walking and realized he could no longer hold off what he had to say. He turned around but his eyes look to the ground. Several times he opened his mouth to speak and nothing came out. After what seemed like an eternity words were forced out.
Everyone except Dumbledore nodded in agreement. Then Dumbledore said, “this might be the right time to mention that this year will rather exciting but no one should get harmed.” He said this calmly but Adrian felt phantom pain from all his previous injuries. “This year we will be hosting the Triwizard tournament. A testament to our heritage.”
Mr. Weasley’s eyes shifted away. He muttered out, “St. Mungo’s wizard hospital.” Before she could ask he chugged his coffee and stood up. “I have to go to work.” He pinched some Floo powder. He threw it in the fire, stepped in, and said, “Ministry of Magic,” all in one smooth motion.
Ginny stepped out of her family’s tent and grumbled, “Must be nice.”
His smile dropped into a dumbfounded expression. Then he put his smile back on and announced, “we have our winners of the first trial!”
Joan asked, “can Snape make a sleeping potion strong enough to put down a dragon for a few minutes?”
Joan nodded and knocked on the door to the hut. She ignored Grubbly-Plank’s complaints and yelled, “Hagrid, McGonagall said help us or I’m allowed to break down the door and make you help us.”
Along the way up they ran into Lucius Malfoy and his son. “Author! A little family outing. I hope you didn’t have to sell your house for the money.” He remarked to the Weasley family from a level above them.
McGonagall leaned in and told him, “yes, it was awful. She called you many horrible things. Blamed you for it.”
Arlene clapped her hands together and said, “it was bound to happen sooner or later. I knew that the school would find out eventually. I guess this is the best time for it. Everyone is distracted by the tournament and still feeling good from the ball last night.”
He threw down his copy of the Daily Prophet and answered, “I have not. I would certainly like to know where they are as well.” He took a swig from his personal flask. That was when Ginny noticed the article he had been reading.
No needles involved.
He didn’t know what else to say. So he told her the truth. All of it, from what Sirius told him to what he did. All the planning. He hid no details. She didn’t interrupt him, she just let him explain himself. Eventually he stopped talking.
She found Luna waiting for her in their dormitories. Arlene told her first, “I’m sorry. Are you okay?”
She reached the room and tried to open the door. It was locked she waved her wand at it and opened it. She opened it to find Arlene and the rest of the champions standing in an unused classroom. An odd looking man with a camera walked up to her and began to raise his camera. She set her wand on it and gave him a deadly glare.
Sirius and Remus were fighting back against the death eaters while they advanced to Harry. They called out to him several times but he was tool involved in his attack on Voldemort.
Remus leaned forward in his chair. “He’s right. We need eyes off of us and we need to be prepared.”
The thing was that it would be strange to confront her over it. They both had done something illegal. He gained enough focus to stand up. He grumbled and decided that it wasn’t worth it. Even if Rita got out and tried to press charges he could just tell everyone that she was an illegal animagus. All he had done was turn her into a beetle and put her in the jar. She had enraged a dragon to tear someone’s leg off. He wouldn’t go to Azkaban for one reason: they still didn’t know where his house was. The ministry is terrible at finding people who go on the run most of the time too.
“Stink bomb?”
Arlene hid her fear and said, “we are.”
The only solace he had was that none of his kids would be signing up for that. He left after he finished his lunch.
Behind them stretched a massive city. Most of the buildings were short but they never seemed to end. It was a sea of stone buildings. Adrian said, “whenever you’re ready, I’ll make us invisible and we’ll start flying towards the library.”
All the students arrived at this time. They arrived cheering and yelling. Professor McGonagall tried to keep them in order but they were too filled with excitement. They picked up Ron and Harry to carry them back to the Gryffindor common room. The Ravenclaws were better behaved. They only formed a circle of jumping and cheering around her.
They waved bye to each other and Draco began the long walk back to the Slytherin common room. The magical torches had gone out so he only had his wand light to rely on. His pace was brisk. Not from a rush but from excitement. His plan had worked and now he could be openly gay with Harry. They had to hide it from the rest of the school but being in a relationship with him made even that worry fade.
He told her, “I decided to sleep in for one day. It’s good for the mental health.” He ate his lunch. He was in a good mood until he saw the Goblet of Fire. He knew that something was unnatural about it. It wasn’t just a goblet with some spells cast on it. There was something wrong about it. He had a suspicion on what it was.
She shook her head in a no. She said, “I’m happy for you two. I hope he looks good for you too.” Arlene realized that getting ready seemed like a good idea. The trio told her bye and headed back to the Great Hall to hang out for a few more hours.
The journey was much shorter than that. Their destination was about 193 kilometers away. The max speed of his broom was 241 kilometers per hour. He didn’t push it at full speed the whole way but he was close to it.
When they arrived back there were two people standing on the path outside. Arlene recognized Adrian and Joan instantly and rushed out to see them. Joan saw her first and elbowed Adrian to get him to look. “Ow.” Then he saw her. They met her in the middle and hugged.
Adrian Pov.
He smirked as he said, “well, none of Slytherin house arrived crashing into a tree which is monumental to the school’s history.”
Arlene moved out of the way as she and her husband went to their dead son.
The night of the third task arrived. First they had to do their finals. Arlene was exempt from them. She was waiting for Luna and Ginny to get out so they could talk before the last trial.
All his life he had been the brunt of bullying and jokes. The only light that he had left was her. Then that snake faced bastard killed her. He had begged him not to. Begged Dumbledore to protect her. Of course James Potter was incompetent enough to let her die. In the end none of it changed anything. Lily Evans was dead. Died protecting the spawn of James who now tormented him every day with the memory of what he did.
She shook her head. “exploding desserts.” Before he could respond she said, “Professor, promise me you won’t murder that Skeeter woman.”
Adrian stood up. “Yes, I do.” Severus grumbled something but he didn’t care. “If anyone has any knowledge of anything that might lead to me or anyone at this school getting stabbed or bitten or having their ribcage crushed again please let us know now. I am really looking forward to a normal, boring school year. Can we please focus on education this time?”
He thought he had gotten away. Then he felt intense heat. As fast as his Firebolt was it just couldn’t outrun her flames. He only caught the last of it but it was still enough to hurt. He looked back to see the back of his broom was on fire. Then he noticed that his robes were on fire.
Ollivander was there and went through an inspection of every wand. Even Arlene’s and luckily for his health and Joan’s job security he didn’t say anything about her not being able to use it. The process finished and after some pictures they prepared to leave.
Harry’s eyes widened and he asked, “how did you know?”
Professor Dumbledore reached his hand out to her and said, “Miss Connery, I look forward to seeing you in the tournament.” She tried to shake it lightly but he gripped her hard and shook it roughly. She got a glimpse of those mad eyes. She looked for too long and saw something she didn’t like. It looked like desire but combined with the madness in them it made something horrifying.
He pushed at it with two fingers. It wiggled just like a normal flower. He felt the stem and leaves. When satisfied he pulled at a petal. It popped off just like with a normal flower.
“Fuckin’,” he breathed. In a bundle of blankets sat a wrinkly baby. Except baby wasn’t a good way to describe the horror of what he was looking at. It had snakelike features and seemed even more feeble than a human infant.
She glared at it. “You win, now can I go get something out?”
McGonagall stood up straight and said, “I see your point.”
Luna suggested, “maybe you should lay low until you can talk to them.” Arlene liked that idea. She nodded in agreement as Luna told her, “if the ministry wants to get involved then you’ll have to play by their rules for a while.”
Adrian was wearing a cheap suit so when the muggle clerk saw him he instantly trusted him. Not so rich as to be an aristocratic asshole and not some poor crazy person. He acted tired and asked, “hi, I’m sorry to disturb you but can you help me find the grave of a friend of my father’s?”
Voldemort patted at his mouth and shook his head. Adrian pieced it together and said, “you can’t speak right now. Fine, I will restore you.” He kept glancing at the snake to make sure it wasn’t getting any ideas. “I will ask and you will answer. One question before we go any further: Did you kill James and Lily Potter?” Voldemort shook his head in a ‘no’. Adrian lowered his wand. “You will have much explaining to do when you can speak. Your answers will decide if you live or die.”
The reality was that Neville was great at dancing. Somehow, whenever he began to dance his balance and foot placement became extraordinary. He had incredible rhythm. He lead Ginny across the floor effortlessly. The normally awkward boy took control and ruled the dance floor.
Dumbledore glared back at him and said, “the goblet has spoken. There is no going back.”
That got him out. He opened the door and walked out. He had his crossbow and his pink umbrella. “Dragons?” He seemed ready but he asked them anyway.
The way that Hermione had asked gave the impression that she didn’t respect the Quibbler. As if she was looking down on it while begging for help. Luna either didn’t notice or didn’t care. “I’ll help you Hermione but I’ll have to ask my dad. We can set up the article then send it to him.”
She understood why no one was supporting her. In case you haven’t noticed, Arlene and Luna aren’t popular at Hogwarts. It didn’t help that she had tried to deny the championship. What she didn’t understand was why they were hating on her. She had wanted to give the championship to someone else. The rules were screwing her over. Did they understand that?
Hope everyone is enjoying the holidays.
Someone coughed at the doorway. They looked to see Adrian standing there with a guilty look on his face. He gave a weak wave then said, “Professors, I let my emotions get the better of me and I acted unprofessionally. I do apologize and hope we can move forward from this.”
He waved her away and said, “never mind.” He got up and went to his cupboard. Arlene left his office still in good mood. She was planning something that would put down a dragon for sure. They would wake up just fine. After she had accomplished her goal.
The Ravenclaw boy who had pushed Ginny into the bicorns water trough at the beginning of the year rudely walked up and said, “hey, any of you girls need a real man to take you to the Yule ball?”
Harry lay draped across Ron’s body crying loudly. It was then that an even worse sound ripped through the ears and hearts of everyone present, Molly Weasley’s scream at the sight of Ron’s body.
Ron walked over to Arlene and whispered to her, “you sure you’re ready?” She nodded even though she wasn’t sure she was ready. Ron only nodded back then walked away to do some pacing.
Remus shook his head. He looked to Sirius and asked, “Are you sure about what you saw?”
George said, “no one else can boast that.”
Fleur was nearby but heading away from Arlene. She was moving away from a large spider in the maze. Harry was letting Ron get ahead of him. Ron was following his wand as he used it like a compass. He figured he was South of the center so he was heading North. Krum was moving towards Fleur but something seemed off about his mind. It was as if he had two trains of thought at once. She pulled away from him and decided to move closer to Ron.
Arlene Pov.
Dobby announced, “we will prepare a boar for her!” All the other house elves ran off to continue their work. Dobby stayed and told her, “we are happy at the return of the Connery family. Ever since Sarah Connery passed we house elves have had more and more harshness and restrictions put on us. Your family was the only one that stood up for us.”
A jolt of exactment shot through her and she said, “I would love that. Please Hagrid, I’ll pay for them.”
Arlene pressed her head against Joan and held her close. She loved her adoptive parents but in that moment she wanted to know her blood family.
Dumbledore resumed speaking as the room became quiet, “the winner of the tournament will receive ten thousand Galleons and the Triwizard cup.” Behind him a crystal trophy had been set on the staff table. It seemed to glow from within. It had a handle on either side with a “W” on the cup part.
As soon as he was gone she heard someone coming down the stairs. She looked around to see Mrs. Weasley coming down the stairs. She also had bags under her eyes. Almost in a daze she went to the stove and began conjuring food into pans. She didn’t even notice Arlene was there until she turned around.
Not only did he show off this incredible talent of his but he was humble about it as well. Almost every dance at the ball ended with him asking her if he did well. She always told him that he did. Always in an amazed voice. Neville Longbottom was the last person anyone expected to be great at dancing.
Mrs. Weasley told them, “I’ll take you all to Diagon alley so we can get your school supplies. As soon as everyone’s finished their breakfast we’ll head out.” By that time most of them were finished so they headed towards the fireplace. Within minutes they were all in Diagon alley and began shopping for their supplies. The effects of the attack on the World Cup were obvious.
Arlene asked him, “how did you expect them to get past the trolls?”
They broke apart and headed for the house. Everyone in the house gathered around the table. Mrs. Weasley, for the first time ever, had to get more chairs from around the house and even conjure a few. The massive amount of guests in the house pushed the capabilities of the burrow.
“That hasn’t even happened yet!”
They arrived and Joan said, “Good morning. How did you sleep?”
Regulus Black was waiting for him in his sitting room. They were in Grimmauld place, the former home of the family Black. Regulus asked, “what’s the news?”
They made small talk with Hagrid before having to leave due to his work. They walked back to the castle. Arlene decided she wanted to try out what Draco had told her. Ginny headed off to dinner while Luna and she went to the seventh floor.
McGonagall led them right to the dance floor and left them there. Luna and Arlene faced each other, then the music started. There was a second where neither of them moved before Luna took the lead. The music was something operatic but there seemed to be no source for it.
Arlene could tell he meant the hedges. “Hagrid what’s with the hedges? Why are they growing all over the field?” As soon as the question left her lips she figured it out.
His blood ran cold. The thinking and logical part of his brain knew instantly they had been set up and duped. The emotional part of his brain became worried about the students and his daughter being here. He swiped his arm at them and ordered, “get out of here! Go now!” He knew the cup was a portkey but it was supposed to take them back to the entrance of the maze. Not to a graveyard. Someone had tampered with it. Someone who must’ve know what was going to happen here.
Hagrid’s eyes filled with tears but he wiped them away before they fell. He nodded and said, “I’m scared. I’ve been scared they might hate me. The howlers haven’t helped. Angry parents keep sending me howlers telling me horrible things.”
He had to wait a second for that to settle in. Then he told her, “okay, I want to date you too.” He felt like he had made it awkward but he hadn’t seriously talked to woman like this in years. He was so out of practice with flirting that it was really embarrassing.
Luna blushed. She actually stammered before speaking. Luna was never this flustered. “I thought you meant…uh…you know…”
He listened to the paranoid side.
She made a face and asked, “Legi-what?”
Ron Pov.
He checked his wristwatch and saw he had a few more hours. He had to find the grave of Tom Riddle sr. that was somewhere in the entire world. He should’ve pushed his luck and asked for a city.
George, “random screaming and frequently waking up.”
He was giving gentle applause for the champions but he didn’t feel any true joy for them. Only a hope they would get to go back to their normal lives after this. The fire flared again as another name shot out. This one was read out as, “the first champion from Hogwarts is Harry Potter.” Loud cheers came up from the Hogwarts students as he stood up and moved up to give his handshake.
Someone popped into the clearing and warned them, “get back. They’re bringing the cages in soon.” The red haired man jogged over to Hagrid and Adrian. The three of them retreated away from the center of the clearing.
They led her to the same empty classroom that the weighing of the wands had taken place in. This time Harry, Ron, and Hermione were waiting for them. Six chairs were already set up with three of them taken up by the aforementioned people. Fred and George announced, “Arlene Connery as requested!”
He left to go to his office. Along the way his thoughts ran something along the lines of what the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck.
They went to the nearest classroom. Adrian locked the door and set up a muffling spell on it. He turned to find the two of them waiting for him. He drew his wand and sent a stunning spell at the photographer. He crumpled to the ground.
Arlene Pov.
Harry, handsome as ever, sat in his chair. His eyes lifted to him when Draco arrived. “Hey,” Harry told him, “how was your day?”
Arlene told him the truth, “we don’t know. We’re just making it up as we go.” Luna nodded in agreement.
She opened her eyes and sat up. Adrian was standing up already while holding out a hand for her. She grabbed it and pulled herself up. They got the three, thick books. Their guide led them back to the front desk and Adrian asked in Arabic to get them copied. He said something to him that made Adrian’s eyes widen up.
Arlene woke up from an odd dream with a stiff back. In her dream she had been on a boat in the ocean. She had reached out over the water and touched an island that appeared from nothing. The only detail about the island she remembered was the dragons circling it in the sky.
Arlene pulled a check from her pocket and carelessly wrote a check for a thousand galleons. She knew she needed a way to make money so she wouldn’t waste her fortune away but for now she could afford it. She slid it to him.
She wouldn’t tell him. Since he was so smart then he could figure it out on his own. Her family didn’t need to know yet either. They could piece it together like she had. She wouldn’t be forced to marry someone she didn’t want to. She could pursue her own love, her own dreams. She didn’t even have to get married if she didn’t want to. Ginny could do whatever the fuck she wanted to.
For the rest of the day she was occupied with what Bastion had told her. The next day her mind was clear enough for her to start on the books she had gotten from the Library of Alexandria.
Then she dismissed it. To murder a family and leave a child alone to be abused over politics was madness.
Skeeter got up with a bloody lip. She ran from the room. Adrian began following her out. McGonagall, not holding Joan back anymore, asked him in a whisper, “where are you going?”
She smiled but shook her head. “No, I meant just the two of us. As in just us being with each other.”
It was sweet, smooth and fizzy all at the same time. She didn’t know how something like that could even exist but it did and she had it in her hands. She couldn’t help but drink it fast. Her bottle was empty far too fast. She set it down with a loud sigh of satisfaction.
Ron Weasley was lifted into the air. His arms rose up as his wand left his hand. His mouth went agape and slack. His eyes widened from shock that he didn’t feel. Ron’s feet swung out from under him. His whole body gave the impression of being thrown by a massive force. At the peak of his arc Ron leveled out with his head going down first. In a difference scenario this scene might be rather beautiful. As if he had made a graceful leap backwards. This was not the case. His body fell to the ground, the stars reflected in his eyes as they stared at Adrian. They stared at him as if accusing him of letting this happen.
She was distracted by the beauty of the room. The ceiling was as tall as the one in the Great Hall with snowflakes falling from it. The tree that had been in the Great Hall now presided over the center of the room. Garland strings ran from it to the walls and wound downward towards the floor. A grand stage had been set up on her left. Two buffet tales loaded with food sat on her right and in the middle was the dance floor.
“No, I don’t mind looking around. It’ll be good to stretch my legs.” The old man left him with a wave. Adrian returned the wave and began walking towards the house. As he approached it he noticed the paint peeling and the wild foliage around the house. It appeared as if no one had tended to the house in months.
He caught up with Skeeter and called out to her, “Skeeter, I want an interview.”
Ginny lay awake for a while. She kept thinking about how Neville had looked in his dress robes. He had definitely lost weight since last year, in a good way. When he went on the dance floor he had become so confident and happy. It was odd seeing him in this light. He was so different from his usual timid self. Ginny didn’t mind either. She liked both versions of Neville. Eventually, she did fall asleep.
He sighed and said, “I don’t know. I can’t think right now.” His voice wavered. “Joan, a student died when I was supposed to protect them. Ron Weasley died right in front of me.” He shook his head. “All because I thought I was good enough to save the world.”
He had seen that look in her eyes a few times since then but neither of them had talked about it.
“Yes,” Remus nodded. “Watching that man turn on his followers and fight them was what convinced me.” He leaned back in his chair. “I can’t believe it. We’ve been lied to for years.”
Ten minutes later it was her turn. Mr. Crouch came up and told her, “time for you to head out.” He walked out. He didn’t even wish her good luck.
Him and Joan exchanged a fearful glance. The one dragon they had fought in the past had been a nesting mother. Them and two others had been forced to fight one during their time in the camp. Adrian and Joan had been the only survivors and that was because they were smart enough to know when they had lost and to run away.
He squeezed on the beetle until Skeeter burst out by turning back into human. She fell to the ground. Adrian pointed his wand at her and said, “that’ll be really interesting for the ministry to find out. That explains so much.” He smirked.
The student walking beside her sulked and told her, “it’s not fair Professor. He’s already famous. What about those of us who aren’t? He doesn’t need the money either. Why’d he join?”
In the last few weeks before Christmas break officially started Arlene was called to Professor Flitwick’s office. Confused, she knocked on his door. He opened it and gestured her inside. She walked into the office and he said, “you’re not in trouble, just a little news for you.” He waved a hand at the chair and said, “sit down, please.”
In the distance she heard Adrian yelling, “that’s my daughter!” she heard Joan join in and smiled as she walked back into the tent.
Harry had to stand there for a minute with an angry dragon staring at him. Then he heard a swooshing. He glanced in the direction of it and saw his Firebolt coming towards him. He smiled, glad his spell had worked. It flew right into his hand and he took off instantly.
She had to keep moving, the rest of the champions were close on her heel. Light flashed in her eyes and she fell back blinded. A sweat covered her and she realized a jet of fire had almost hit her. Her vision returned and she got up.
So it was settled. The next day after working for hours on their homework they ate lunch and gave blood. The line was shorter than expected. They all had to fill out questionnaires before donating. Chairs were brought out and several of the staff were drawing blood. They put their wands to a vein, whispered a spell, blood flowed into a tube that led to a bag. No actual incision was necessary and the process was clean.
No one knew what to say. It was a harsh truth that if the two of them danced at the ball then rumors would spread. Rumors that could get back to Mr. Malfoy. They didn’t want to know how the ex-Death Eater would react to his own son being gay. For sure he wouldn’t be happy about it.
A squib for champion!
She was so frustrated she couldn’t think. This was the fifth hard riddle the knocker had given her that day. She rubbed at her head trying to think through her headache.
He lowered his hand and said, “you really don’t want us to be a part of this, do you?”
The smile sprung to her face without control. She was free. There was no way to fulfill her end of the contract that her family had made with Dumbledore. The contract that she had no part in. She was free from it now. Harry was gay and nothing she did could change that. The idea of rubbing that in the old fucker’s face made her even happier.
Professor Snape took it and his face went pale. “T-this is far more than is needed. How can you afford this?” He put the check in his desk. Arlene only smiled in a smug manner. As someone who had never had a thing in life before she now loved being obscenely rich. Professor Snape said, “I’ll return what isn’t used. I’ll get the ingredients set aside for you. When they are ready I will send for you.”
Everyone nodded and said some words, “I didn’t want to be a part of this.”
They had to change into their robes then. Arlene was just finishing when the train screeched to a halt. Grabbing their luggage they headed to the carriages. They ran through the rain to find one. The three of them clambered in one and it drove them towards the castle. The rain was so thick it was hard to tell but she thought she saw something in front of the carriage. She had been in such a rush to get in it she didn’t acknowledge it.
Luna had wanted to see it last night so she had dug it out from deep within her trunk. Luckily it was still in there. Just for fun she began to tap it against the pile of wood for the fire. Nothing happened with it of course. She was still a squib as far as the rest of the world was concerned. No one except her closest friends knew she was any different.
Then another stretcher went by. This one had a ministry worker on it. The right side of his body was covered in second and third degree burns. Most of his face had been saved but a little of his cheek was red. He wasn’t moving but they could hear his breathing. One of the ministry workers levitating him was saying, “I thought they stunned that thing! It got up and got Jeff.” Then they were gone.
She heard Adrian say, “Ma’am, can we check these books out?”
It had been late in the day when Joan had grabbed him. The sun was beginning to set as they walked. They passed over the tracks from centaurs and somehow found tire tracks in the forest. Soon enough they reached a massive clearing. The tree stumps to the side showed that it had been recently made.
She looked at her and told her, “I hope you’re right. I can’t see anything there.” A furrow formed in her brow and she asked, “you’re not mad about our first year here are you? When I couldn’t see anything that would happen with the chamber?”
Professor McGonagall told her, “you get to bed and we’ll let you know anything we find out.” She gave a caring smile.
The words he had said to him. The words Draco had said to him had stung deep. The idea that anyone could love like him. The idea that others had emotions like him. It was shocking to say the least.
He led the way to the shed and opened the door. They went in to find an old fashioned, golden elevator. Arlene hadn’t expected this but they went into it and the doors closed. There was only one button. Adrian pushed it and the elevator started down slowly.
The sorting finished and the feast began. Instantly the plates in front of them filled withs mounds of foods. The wide range included roast chicken, mashed potatoes, scones, roast beef, and all sorts of foods that you can imagine. Having eaten little that day knowing the feast was to come, they dug in and ate to their fill.
She took her place next to the other champions. Harry and Ron were there. Fleur and Victor Krum stood spaced from them. Ludo Bagman walked in front of them. With his voice amplified, he thundered, “GOOD EVENING EVERYONE! WELCOME TO THE FINAL CHALLENGE FOR OUR CHAMPIONS! TONIGHT THEY WILL ENTER A MAZE AND RACE TO THE CENTER! WE WILL GET TO WATCH THEIR PROGESS AND WATCH THEM FACE ANY OBSTACLES THEY ENCOUNTER! GIVE THEM A CHEER AND LET THE GAME BEGIN!”
He walked over to the cage and went in a door to the cauldron. The liquid inside was at a boil. All the other ingredients had been added. He dropped Voldemort in. The next two seconds were a rush. He left the cage, locked it with a bolt, used his magic to melt the lock so it could not be reopened manually. The door was sealed to the cage magically and physically. The cauldron’s contents began to glow as he backed away.
Ginny shook her head and told her, “you didn’t know those things would happen. That’s like asking if I’m mad at you for how the second tournament turned out.”
At that point in his life he felt hopeless. So he went and joined the Death Eaters.
He didn’t bother asking anymore. Ron leaned over and asked, “are you ready?”
Hagrid escorted the wining boy back to the castle as he called back, “get to your next class and don’t be late.”
He smiled at her and drank both. He responded, “you are a good person. Thank you.”
They ate then went back. As they walked Luna explained, “when you said couple stuff I thought you meant something very different.”
Both Cairo and Alexandria were near the Nile river so the land below them was sprawling farmland that took advantage of the nearby water. Off to her left she could see the desert proper but mostly it was farmland. The city of Alexandria is right on the coast of the Mediterranean sea. A little under an hour after they set off it appeared on the horizon.
Adrian laughed and got serious, “there’s my blood. As of right now I’m an enemy of Voldemort and I will remain so until he convinces me to not be one.”
Dumbledore actually smiled and responded, “well, then, I guess I shouldn’t let anyone die then.” He actually chuckled and then added, “our new Defense against the dark arts teacher will be Alastor Moody, former auror. He’s not here right now because he is still in the process of separating from the ministry. He says there’s more paperwork then a dragon could burn.”
All three of them recoiled from the ferocity of her statement. Not even Fred and George made a joke from that. The rest of the family came down one or two at a time. Harry and Hermione came down with them. Luna was the last to come down and she sat next to Arlene. Breakfast of bacon and eggs was served as they came down. Conversation was light and halfhearted.
Adrian’s heart beat rapidly. Not out of fear for himself but out of fear for the students who had to face those monsters. Especially his daughter. “Adrian,” Joan breathed next to him. They looked at each other. He knew she was thinking the same thing as him.
Joan input, “When dragons are angry they act dumb. You can use that to your advantage. They’re easily distracted. A loud, annoying object will distract it easily.” She crossed her arms and said, “Adrian that might give her time to do alchemy.”
Arlene did have things to add. She nodded. Luna prepped another sheet of parchment and readied her quill. Arlene told her, “my adoptive dad takes in house elves and pays them. He also provides food, comfortable living spaces, and clothing for them. They are technically free but choose to work for him because he is good to them. His wealth is not much compared to the wealth of most families that have house elves. This shows that the abuse of house elves is a choice and not something they have to resort to.
He didn’t do anything though. He didn’t cast the curse. He didn’t tell Voldemort and Dumbledore where she was hiding. Pettigrew did, of course it would’ve been better if Sirius had been the one to do it. Sirius had been more involved in his bullying. More involved in his pain. He wished Sirius had remained the betrayer, he hated him more than Pettigrew.
Rita begged, “I’m sorry. Please don’t hurt me.” She looked truly pathetic now. Her fingers took on a black shell like quality before returning to human quickly. That made him hesitate but not for long. He began to suspect something.
“Good job,” Luna commented. They walked in to find most of the house still up. As soon as she walked in they got up and began moving towards her. Luna got in front of her and announced, “any questions for Arlene come with a free copy of the Quibbler!” The entire house backed off. She smirked and whispered, “I am aware of the effect I have on the closed minded.” They went to bed without any further complications.
The glow faded. She felt almost the same as she did before she performed the magic. Last year she wouldn’t even be able to perform that. Now she had done it easy with little preparation. She clenched her hands into fists with satisfaction. She was getting stronger with magic.
He fought to pull his hand away but pitch black tendrils were coming off of Dumbledore and into his skin. He screamed, “NO, NO, NO! PLEASE!”
The sound of snapping branches caught her attention. She looked up and her heart froze in her chest.
Her smile faltered. She told him, “I’m not supposed to give out records unless necessary.”
She told him, “I’d be delighted to.” Her green quick-quotes-quill peeked over her shoulder.
Her father followed her out and in a much cheerier voice greeted them, “Good morning everyone! Exciting day isn’t it! Smoke on the air, birds in the sky, sun on the rise.” He pulled a box of genuine matches from his pocket. He struck one against the side of the box and it snapped. “Oh.” He bemoaned. He didn’t give up, Author persisted right through four more matches.
Her and Luna hugged and said bye to each other. Then Adrian and her began walking towards the gates. She asked him, “how are we getting to Egypt?”
“Thank you professor,” Arlene told him. She stood up to leave.
Luna told Ginny, “I think Arlene has been hanging with moon frogs.”
She put them on and the sunlight was far less intense on her eyes. The sight that greeted her was spectacular. They had apparated not far from the pyramids. She spent several minutes while Adrian cast charms on them to protect their skin from the sand and sun. He also cast spells to protect them during the flight to Alexandria.
The goblet flared one last time and Dumbledore grabbed it with ease and read out, “last but not least is the third champion from Hogwarts. Arlene Connery.”
Many expected the Yule Ball to take place in the Great Hall. What most at Hogwarts didn’t know was that there was a proper ballroom hidden away. It almost never got used. There was not much of a real purpose to it. The last time it had been used was back in 1939. Hogwarts hadn’t had a dance since.
Her voice popped from it, “I’m on my way. Ten minutes.”
Of course he could always be persuaded to do another with a well written article about the wrong person.
The trolls loomed over the contestants. Unchained but with no clubs they stood between them and the scepters. Champions kept moving forward only to be pushed back by a charging troll. The troll stopped charging once the champion backed off. They were intent on keeping them from the scepters.
Help us save some lives!
Joan growled, “for fuck’s sake. How much does she hate men?”
Barty walked out and moved in front of the desk. He clasped his hands in front of him as he waited for Dumbledore’s orders. The old man told him, “Lucius has been loyal as the dog he is for years. His reliability isn’t what it used to be. As of late his fear seems to be getting the better of him.” He focused his eyes on Barty. “I need you to reassure me that Tom Riddle will be found. I must put him back under my control. If not then all my plans will go to waste. All our work will have been for nothing.”
Mrs. Weasley spun and waved a spoon at him, “whatever I make and you’ll like it.”
If Hogwarts didn't think Harry had gone mad before, they sure did now.
Sighing, Harry closed his eyes, finally allowing himself some sleep. Of course, he woke a few hours later from the nightmares of that night in the graveyard. This wasn't unusual, however, so you'd think he'd grow used to watching the Hufflepuff die over and over again. He wasn't. He had grown used to a few hours of sleep a night though. At this point, sleep just seemed pointless.
The next morning, Harry was in a mood all through breakfast. He'd snapped at Hermione when she bugged him about eating more, ignored poor Neville who asked him if he'd completed all the work they were given over the summer, and left the table when Ron and Hermione started their usual bickering. Today was one of his bad days, that was fairly obvious.
Shaking his head, Harry stood up straight once more, and began the walk to the Gryffindor common room, fiddling with his bag full of books as he did. The journey was filled with silence, the once sound being his own footsteps and breathing. Harry hated silence. Silence gave him nothing to focus on, nothing to distract him. That was when his thoughts liked to pay a visit, the ones from the part of his mind that was undoubtedly fucked up.
"Save it; I won't tell anyone. Just leave me alone, and we won't have any problems." Harry turned away and opened his trunk. He grabbed some pajamas and walked into the bathroom, locking the door behind him.
"The horses, Ron. Stop playing tricks on me, they're right there!"
"Language, Miss Parkinson. I'll see you later today for our first session, and if you're even a minute late, there will be consequences. We've already lost enough house points because of your blatant stupidity." The greasy-haired professor spun around in the most dramatic way Harry had ever seen, exiting the room with a distasteful superiority.
Harry nodded, and together the two were able to get Harry's things into the trunk. "Thanks, Dudley." The boy nodded and hopped into the car, Harry following.
Harry tugged on the collar of his shirt then undid the top button. It was much too tight, constantly choking Harry, reminding him of things he'd rather not be reminded of. He loosened his tie, finally feeling like he could breathe fully. It was torture, wearing that thing all day.
"We have to leave for the prefect's compartment now, mate. See you later," Ron said, the two standing up.
"A MONTH OF DETENTION!!! NO WAY IN HELL AM I DOING THAT!!!"
Despite what the two Gryffindors might think, Harry wouldn't out them. He wasn't evil, just angry.
"Oh, that's nice. I don't have many of those." Harry frowned.
. And the pink, Merlin, Harry hated pink.
"What, no snarky comeback? You're not going to pull out your wand and try to hex me? Punch me, maybe? Has Malfoy gone soft?" Harry smirked, watching as the ferret's head whipped up.
"It's all right, you're not going mad or anything. I can see them too," the strange girl replied. Harry wouldn't say it out loud, but he wasn't very reassured. The girl didn't seem like she was all there, from what Harry could say. Though, he couldn't say much, as this was his first time speaking to her.
"Nothing, I just figured since she's your girlfriend, I could make you worry about her worrying or something. It made sense in my head, alright?"
"WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?"
"Sorry..." Just as Ginny was opening her mouth to say something, Madame Pomfrey came up to Harry and closed the curtain behind her.
"Give me a minute, that was exhausting." Harry sighed, before letting out a yawn, his eyelids growing heavy.
"Oh I'd love to, really, but I'm chasing down the wrackspurts right now." Harry didn't even try to hide his confusion, and Luna gave a small laugh at the expression on his face.
"So you aren't worried then? What makes Luna different from you or Hermione?" Harry questioned, ignoring the second half of what he'd said.
, mate?" If Ron wasn't alarmed before, he was now. Great, now everyone probably thought he was going mad.
"That the best you got, or are you waiting for your girlfriend to come and save the day? Word on the street is, she's just as mad as you!" The Slytherin smirked, knowing exactly how to get a reaction out of him.
"Don't you think Lovegood'll be worried; you barely had a bite yesterday night as well. Come to think of it, I haven't seen you eat much at all since we've gotten here," Ron said, though it seemed like the last bit was more to himself than Harry.
Things at Hogwarts seemed to be changing. Fast; too fast. Umbridge, Malfoy, Ginny, Luna, Ron, Hermione, even he was, he supposed. Harry didn't like change.
"Well, aren't you coming?" Without hesitation, Harry jogged up to the Ravenclaw, and she resumed her skipping, Harry trailing after her at a faster pace than usual, trying to keep up with the lighthearted fourth year. They talked and laughed along the way, but Harry's smile dropped when they ran into a certain greasy-haired teacher.
"That might have worked, except for one tiny detail...LUNA AND I AREN'T TOGETHER!" Ron stepped back, hands held up in surrender, while Harry glared daggers at him.
"I'm fine! Let's just get in," he replied, bewildered and angry. And there was the thought that he might be going insane, that was always comforting. They got into the carriage that was to take them to Hogwarts, along with Ginny and a girl with dirty-blonde hair.
"She is, isn't she? Well, I best be off; schoolwork won't finish itself."
Letting his glamour fall, Harry faced away from the mirror. He shrugged his robes off and let them drop to the ground before removing his tie and untucking his shirt from his trousers. He bent down to pick up an old shirt of Dudley's that he was sleeping in that was on the ground.
Ron and Hermione were having a hushed conversation of their own when Harry walked up to them, stopping when they noticed him, making Harry suspicious and uncomfortable.
"Harry, oh my god, are you alright?" a voice asked, though the Gryffindor was too distracted to recognize who it was, if he even knew at all. He did flush though, embarrassed at being caught in such a vulnerable state.
anything, just ask me and I'll tell you!" Harry was well aware the other boys in the dorm had woken up by now, watching the scene play out, but he really didn't care. The more who knew Harry and the Ravenclaw weren't dating, the better.
"What were you doing out here?"
"Is it? That's lovely to hear, almost as if it's coming from a friend."
"Sorry, sorry! I'll just...sorry!" Harry frantically apologized before standing up and walking out as fast as he could in his condition.
"Oh, umm...I had a tad bit of a crush on you. But over the summer, whoosh, the feelings just washed away, so no need to worry about that anymore. Why do you ask?" she replied, blushing slightly from the embarrassment of it all. Who'd have thought Ginny Weasley could get embarrassed?
"Wait, Ginny? Oh Merlin, am I in the girl's bathroom?" Harry groaned, putting his head in his hands, his damp cheeks stinging slightly under the touch.
"Harry, nothing's pulling the carriages," Hermione stated, looking over to him, concern written on her face.
Harry stiffened. How did rumors get so out of hand? Shagging, honestly; the thought repulsed Harry. It had nothing to do with Luna, she was wonderful. Sex had never appealed to Harry, for many reasons. Shivering, Harry shifted awkwardly in his seat, well aware the entire school was watching him.
"Alright." Ginny turned to leave, but Harry stopped her. "Hey, Gin? Keep Luna company for me, will you?" he asked, smiling. The ginger rolled her eyes at his not-so-subtle attempts to get the two to spend some time together but smiled nonetheless.
"I suppose." They began their walk to the Great Hall, which didn't take long since it was on the same floor as the library. With a final goodbye, both parted ways to their own tables, whispers erupting in the Great Hall as they became noticed.
"Mr. Potter, I insist you quit that nonsense this instant. You could lean too far back and crack your head open, and I will not have blood splattered all over my books!" Madame Pince stated, coming up to him.
"Then don't. And for future reference, her name's Luna, Hermione." And with that, Harry stood up, forgetting his dinner entirely, not that he'd been in the mood for food anyway. He left the Great Hall, furious and annoyed.
"Thanks for...saving me," Harry said while trying not to relive the memory, unsuccessfully, he might add. A shudder went down his spine, and Ginny eyed him carefully.
Harry was mentally exhausted by the time he left Defense Against the Dark Arts. He was sure he hated Umbridge almost as much as he did Voldemort, who
"No, I didn't. Is there a way to get rid of them?" She giggled, and shook her head slightly, while a rare smile graced Harry's face.
"Mate, you gonna come down for breakfast?" Ron asked as he slipped on a pair of shoes, then standing up and facing his friend's bed.
"Hermione did ask, and you stormed off without giving an answer," Ron pointed out, and Harry resisted the urge to strangle him. His hotheaded temper was really getting the best of him, but in his defense, it was far too early to be dealing with this.
"Isn't she? Come to think of it, you've never had a girlfriend, have you? I can't understand why with all the girls you've had chasing after you. Forgive me if this leads me to believe that our very own Harry Potter is...a faggot," she sneered, taking a step forward. Malfoy tensed, going unnoticed by the other Slytherins, and Harry's eyes darted towards him before looking back at the bitch that was now a few inches from his face.
Ginny had been cleared to leave, but she stopped by his bed before she left.
Harry's uncle was standing near the door with his arms crossed, tapping his large foot impatiently. "Well, get a move on now! You should be grateful we're taking you, you freak!"
"Hello, Harry. Did you need something?" Her voice was dreamy, a truly pleasant sound. She had turnips hanging below her ears, and her wavy hair framed her face. She had a necklace made of old bottle caps and a magazine in her hand.
Harry looked down and realized he was, in fact, still in his pajamas. He'd never changed.
, Potter. You're delusional."
"Just go away. I'm not in the mood to deal with this."
There was the small matter of the entire school hating Dumbledore and him. People whispered about him as he passed in the halls, though they usually did that. It was different now, they all thought he was going mad, and lying about Voldemort's return. Just hours ago Seamus had confronted him about it, and accused him for not wanting to talk about traumatizing events. Who would though, why should it be any different for him? Maybe the ministry should stop acting like children, and believe Harry when he says that the Dark Lord was back.
Finally, Harry reached the portrait of the Fat Lady, saying the password and stepping into the familiar red and yellow room. He'd always felt the colors were a bit bright for his taste, but it's not like they have this entire room redone just because he asked. Well, they probably would have, actually, since he was the boy who lived. Harry rolled his eyes and shut the portrait door.
"Well, I just assumed-"
He made his way up the familiar set of stairs and opened the door to his dormitory, only to find Dean and Seamus in a passionate make-out session. He rolled his eyes once again and slammed the door shut, making his presence known to the other two. The boys jumped, Dean biting down on Seamus's lip in surprise. Seamus groaned, pulling away and putting a thumb to his lip, then bringing it back down to check for blood. The gleaming red was a clear enough answer, and he looked up and scowled at Harry, who returned the expression.
"Yes sir," Harry said, walking outside and attempting to lift his items into the trunk of the car. It was difficult, especially with Harry as weak as he was. Dudley came up behind him, and Harry flinched, expecting a punch to the face or something of the sort.
After a few hours, Harry fell asleep, and stayed asleep until he was shaken awake by Hermione, who was already changed into her robes.
"Close, but my voice is nowhere near as high as his. All those voice cracks, so bloody annoying."
Shaking his head slightly, he began strolling over towards the fourth years but stopped abruptly. What if they didn't want him interrupting? They probably didn't; he should just leave. He had just turned around when he heard someone call out his name. Panic shot through him as he faced the direction of the voice, though he tried to shove it down.
"Are you alright, Harry? You look a bit pale."
"So that's a yes then?"
The two Gryffindors  made their way back to their beds, while Madame Pomfrey continued to scold Harry for walking on his ankle.
Climbing into his bed, Harry adjusted his pillow, fluffing it up to make it more comfortable. He didn't care what time it was, he was going to sleep. Resting his head onto the pillow, Harry sighed in content, letting his eyes flutter shut. He kept the curtains open, as he always did. Closing them made him feel confined, taking him back to his cupboard.
"Ron?" he croaked, blinking some more tears out of his eyes.
Professor Umbridge was yet another problem to deal with this year. Only a day, and it already seemed like she was trying to change everything. And the pink, the horrendous pink and lace that she wore make Harry want to puke. She'd been at his trial over the summer, which meant the ministry was now interfering with Hogwarts.
"How's your eye?" Draco asked the girl, who was still having a bratty fit about before. Harry hadn't even noticed Pansy's black eye until now, and he wanted to congratulate whoever had made it such lovely shades of purple and blue.
"For your information, Pansy, I'm no different this year than you are. I simply grew up, and it's time you did the same."
"No kidding," he replied, handing Harry his glasses. The Gryffindor put them back on and blinked repeatedly as his eyes adjusted. His eyesight really was horrible. He winced as the constant pain from his ribs worsened as he stood up.
It was a long drive to King's Cross Station, for Harry at least. He spent the entire time looking out the window, looking at all the different cars and buildings as they passed. Finally, they made it just ten minutes before the Hogwarts Express was due to leave.
"I wasn't yelling, sir. I was simply talking and spending time with Luna." It was only then that Snape noticed the unusual girl standing just a ways from Potter, smiling up at the man. He'd never seen the two together before, and he can't say he wasn't surprised. He'd have thought the boy would think he was above the girl; it was a typical James thing to do. After all, Harry was just like his father, not an ounce of Lily in him.
"Including you, one. How'd I do?" She said, letting out a breath of air.
"They're creatures that make your head fuzzy. Your head is almost always full of them, did you know?"
"You didn't tell me your ankle hurt, Harry. You said you were fine," Ginny sighed as she got back in her bed, Harry doing the same. He looked over and saw a look of genuine hurt on the girl's face, making him feel a twinge of guilt.
It was the people who weren't so nice that made Luna sad. She felt bad for them, for surely there was a reason they acted the way they did. So when they stole her things or teased her, Luna only smiled at them. Of course, what they did still wasn't okay, but she could hardly care. She had a friend now, just like her mother once said she would, a true friend.
"Mr. Potter, you cannot leave this bed until I say so, you hear me? You have far greater injuries than the rest, somehow, and you will leave when I see fit!"
"But everyone else only got two weeks, except for the fucking Gryffindorks, who only got one week," she snapped hotly, her ugly face red and scrunched up.
"Malfoy, why are you hiding behind a wall?" Knowing he'd been spotted, the Slytherin revealed himself fully, head down and staring at the ground. He mumbled something Harry couldn't make out, and the raven-haired boy rolled his eyes.
"Well, seeing as I am the Queen of Bisexual, I'm going to have to say Luna," she replied with a wave of her hand, as though it were a regular thing to be discussing. Harry wondered how she'd come out so effortlessly to him, seemingly thinking nothing of it.
"It most definitely is not! And what about you, then? Now that you've moved on from me, who are you so helplessly infatuated with?"
Sighing, Harry leaned against a nearby wall, leaning his head back and shutting his eyes. Taking a few deep breaths, he felt his anger retreating, only mild annoyance remaining. Though the pain lingered, the pain he got every time he took a fucking breath.
"Watch where you're going, you...Potter?" Shit, it was Malfoy. Of course, it was just his luck.
"Ignore them," Luna whispered, grabbing his hand loosely, sending a buzz throughout the Great Hall. Harry felt sick, the bile rising up in his throat.
Ron and Hermione were whispering furiously, until Hermione slapped his arm, shutting him up, and turned to him. Harry stopped chewing, looking at her expectantly, wondering why she was holding her tongue. Hermione always spoke her mind, so her behavior was unusual and mildly unsettling.
Sirius sighed. “Alright. How do we bring this monster back?”
Arlene had little time to be amazed by her transformation. Professor McGonagall rushed over and asked, “oh, where is your date?” Arlene pointed to Luna. After a few seconds of confusion an understanding look crossed her face. “Oh, how very bold of you two.” She smiled. “I’m proud to see you two ladies leading the charge in change.”
She didn’t fuss over them anymore but Krum came over and asked, “are you two in a relationship?” Victor Krum was an imposingly tall, buff man. Not to mention a professional athlete. His accent only added to this.
They went to her room, locked the door and had sex. Minutes later she lay her head on his chest feeling much more relaxed. She had begun drinking a potion to prevent pregnancy daily so she could get as much dick as she needed. She always felt much better after her and Adrian spent some time alone.
She crossed her arms and responded, “you’re Fred and George. If you don’t know then you should figure it out.”
Rita Skeeter had been a low level journalist that no one knew about back when Joan and the others escaped the camp. Somehow she was one of the first to interview them. That was how the public came to distrust them and hate them for the first few years. Why they had to be assassins. Skeeter portrayed them as monstrous killers without conscious or honor. Not as children who had been robbed of their childhood and forced into a life they didn’t want.
She leaned forward in her chair. “Your average adult with a job in the wizarding world is given a uniform, pay, and benefits for a job. House elves can’t even wear clothes. Wizards and witches riot if their pay per hour goes slightly below what they like. House elves have to work longer hours with no pay at all. It is common and expected for house elves to be beaten for inadequate work. They are treated as inferiors while they work harder than the rest of us.”
Hagrid didn’t respond but Luna spoke up, “I think it’ll be fascinating, professor.”
He looked down at them and gestured at the empty seats. “Of course I don’t mind. Come on and pull up a chair. There’s plenty of room.” They sat down and he asked, “what are you two have planned for the day?”
Dumbledore shook his head and said, “This is exactly what we need. Last year we had a dark year. This year we will bring up everyone’s spirits and bring the light back onto Hogwarts.”
The dragon immediately grabbed the gold egg in her jaws and flung it at Arlene. It landed in front of her. She picked it up. The dragon told her, “your blood smells like Sarah’s. I never met her but Gathron, our king, did. He showed us her scent to know a human ally. My name is Thera. Gathron is hidden from the world. He is in the safe place. I do not know how to describe how to get there to a human. Only dragons know it naturally.”
Luna gave her a sweet look as the girl from Durmstrang behind her huffed and said, “the tournament isn’t about treasure or money. It’s about eternal glory. That is worth dying for.”
He was returned to the surface. Severus looked up to see Dumbledore standing over him. He held a hand out to help him up. He gladly took the hand, hoping the nightmare was over. As he was pulled up the area around them came into focus. He realized the nightmare had just started.
"We were, we are," Harry pleaded, trying to reason with the redhead.
Harry snapped awake at the screaming, nearly falling out of his bed in alarm. His eyes darted around for the source of the noise, landing on two individuals in the far corner of the hospital wing.
"Shut up, Parkinson," he growled, glaring at the girl in front of him. She cackled, along with Crabbe and Goyle, while Zabini rolled his eyes at his friends. Harry's eyes drifted to the blond, who was avoiding eye contact, lips pressed in a thin line.
Slytherins.
"Oh, it's you," the girl said with a breath, lowering the wand, oblivious to Harry's uneasiness. After taking a few seconds to recover, Harry offered his hand, which she gratefully took, and he hoisted her up from the ground.
Without thinking, he called out her name, and the girl turned around with a bright smile on her face.
Madame Pince returned the hello, and Luna smiled, turning around and walking towards a shelf, scanning the spines before pulling out something on Goblin Wars.
Harry slumped back into bed, closing his eyes and listening to the grumbling of Parkinson on the other side of the room. When the doors to the wing opened, Harry didn't even bother seeing who it was, his eyes much too tired and relaxed to open. That is, until he recognized the voice that spoke less than a moment later.
