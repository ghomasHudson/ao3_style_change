He felt Draco’s hand rubbing his back.  “Thanks, Teddy.  I love it.”
“That was brilliant!  The look on Seamus’s face was priceless!”  Dean kept laughing, clapping Harry and Draco on the shoulder, and then turned back to find Seamus.
Harry woke with a start, and instantly regretted it.
There was a wave of laughter as the group looked around at the people around them.
~*~*~*~*~
Now that he had Harry’s undivided attention, Seamus seemed at a loss for words.  However, after silently conferring with the others, he took a deep breath and said, “We don’t buy this truce thing.  How could you possibly be daft enough to go along with it?!”
As soon as he was out of earshot, Blaise leaned across the table and spat at Draco, “What the fuck are you doing here with him?”
“Yes, I am.”
Draco nodded, but Harry felt him stiffen beside him.  He squeezed his slackened hand, and received a quick squeeze in response.
“Draco, I pledge my heart to you.  I take you now as my husband, from here on, during good times and bad.  I vow to protect you and keep you, for all eternity.  I am yours and you are mine, as long as we both live.”  As he finished, the rope around their wrists tightened, and grew brighter.
Draco looked at the photo, which showed a picturesque sitting room.  Underneath the coffee table sat a large rug with splashes of black, white, grey, purple, blue, maroon, and turquoise all through it, with a large black border.
“That was before, though,” Hermione said.  “Everything has changed; every
“I know nothing,” he said, a little too innocently.
He didn’t have to wait long for Mr Chumes to come through a side door into the room.
The wallpaper had been taken off, with new crown molding and base boards around the walls.  The carpet had been ripped up, too, and the beautiful, polished hard wood shined bright.  The fire place seemed different, but the last time Draco was in here, he hadn’t really taken a hard look at it.
“Like I said, I’ve thought a lot about it, and… And while I understand why you didn’t tell me all that was going on, I still wish you had.  I want to know you—all of you.  The good and the bad.  I know how much your family means to you, though, and I don’t want to get in the way of what is expected of you and your future.”
“Can I go home with you?”
, and, using my magic, via his own, cast an accio charm on himself.  Ollivander couldn’t explain the bright light, though.  He did say that Malfoy would have been brought into the house, but we did such a great job on the wards, the house basically wouldn’t allow him entry.  His wand cast a charm to make the doorbell ring, instead.”
They turned towards each other, taking each other’s hands, crossing their wrists.  She pulled her wand and tapped their hands, one at a time, causing a magical rope to wrap around their wrists, turning a brilliant silver and emitting a blinding light.
Harry gave a mock salute, and Draco held out his hand for Teddy.  “You ready?”
Draco lay his hand on Harry’s knee, turning to kiss him.  “I love you.”
The five of them were enjoying their meal, when an owl swooped in through the open window and landed on the table next to Harry’s plate.  Harry took the letter from its leg, and flicked it a couple of sausages, and then the bird was back out flying through the air.
“Oh, this was Sirius’ room, was it not?  It already seems so different.  Would—would it be possible to take a tour?  I haven’t been in here since I was very small.”
“Yeah.”
Draco sighed as he gripped Harry’s shirt.  “No stress.  This is for us.  I’ve missed us.”
“Very funny, Potter.  He just thinks he’s so funny, doesn’t he?”  Draco looked down at Teddy, who he was still holding in the harness.  Teddy giggled as Draco lightly pinched his cheeks.
Wood just grumbled something under his breath, and swiftly turned away from them.
He switched Teddy to his other hip as he and Harry discussed what they needed to get.
Ron chuckled as he said, “We’ve got food! Hope you don’t mind, Ginny overheard us talking to mum about supper, and she invited herself and Neville.”
They finally made it to the Hospital Wing, and Madam Pomfrey cast a spell that carefully placed Draco in a bed.  It had been less than three minutes since he had opened the door to find Draco on the ground, but to Harry, it felt like a lifetime.
“Ron! What's going on in here?” Hermione appeared at Harry’s elbow.  The two men sitting on the beds glanced at each other and then at the two standing in the doorway.
Harry just shook his head at his lover.
Draco squirmed again, letting his right leg fall wide, still spread open.
“What are you implying, Potter?”
“Harry! Please! Oh, please!”  Draco was shuddering above Harry, now.  Harry figured he was doing something right, if this was what Draco’s response was.
year.  Draco had come in seething at something some 6
Draco’s brows grew closer together, as he said, “Explain, please.”
“Draco and I were just talking about going to the library to get started on this Charms essay.  What are you doing?”
“Just proves that the
“Come here,” Draco said, widening his legs.  Harry turned and snuggled up between his legs, feeling something long and hard butt up to the small of his back.
Walking out of the gates, he continued on his way down to the village, and the nearest apparition point.  Harry still could not believe the freedom that they were to have this year at Hogwarts.  He promised himself that this year he was going to behave himself, so as not to lose his privileges.  Now that he was getting on with Draco, he thought it very well may be possible to hold himself to that.
“We are two weeks away from Christmas, I haven’t finished my shopping, we’re piled up at work.  And then, to top it off, my mother is taking over
Glancing down at his watch, he saw that it was nearly 11.  Everyone would be on the train, preparing to head to Hogwarts.  Harry was tempted to join them, for one last voyage, but decided that speaking with Mr Ollivander was more important.
They opened more gifts, drank more mead, and then Harry and Draco headed home.
She smiled at him, giving him a wink.  “You’re very welcome.  Trust me, I completely understand how you are feeling.”
Draco smiled and wrapped his other hand around Harry’s bicep.  “I love you, too, you silly man.  Come on, let’s go home.”
Both men were giggling as Harry placed Draco back on the ground.  He slipped the ring onto Draco’s finger, kissing his hand.
“Draco?” Harry questioned with a wide yawn.
Draco sighed deeply, clutching onto Harry a bit tighter, and then said, “6th year, I had already taken the Mark before term began. I hope I put on a brave and pompous face, but was actually terrified on the inside. You got a tiny glimpse of that in the bathroom that day.”
Harry opened the window, letting the bird inside.  They all received a blast of freezing cold air, and Harry noticed that it looked like it would start snowing again at any moment.
Draco again rolled his eyes, but smiled and turned toward the table.
“It’s your favourite!”
“Where’s your house elf?  Why isn’t he cooking?” Draco inquired as he made himself comfortable.
Draco woke with a start when the curtains in his room were flung open, emitting the bright light of the early morning sun.
“But, not even six months ago, I hated him with every fibre of my being.  How is it possible that we have gotten to this point so fast??”  Harry started pacing again.  “No, really.  How is it possible to go from hating someone so much that you literally nearly kill them, to saving each other’s lives on multiple occasions during the next year, then suddenly become friends and then start to fall—”  He stopped himself when he realised what he was about to say.
Minerva cast another spell, causing their rings to glow bright silver as well.  She smiled as she said, “By the laws of wizarding kind, and upon the completion of the bonding ritual, I now proudly pronounce you married. May your love grow for the rest of time.  You may now kiss your husband.”
“Okay.  I’ll make it easier on you, though.  Here, put on your coat, and then hold him on your front.”
“I’ve been collecting things over the past few months.  Whenever I saw something that reminded me of you, I picked it up.”
“A Shark Bite.  Tom knows what it is.”
“‘Course.  Why wouldn’t I be?”
Draco gives Harry some special ornaments.
“Love you.”
and work on electricity.  Here, I’ll show you.”  He stood up, taking the pile of lights and taking them back to the shed.
He pulled his foreskin back, touching the head.  His stuttered as he did that, and then continued to stroke himself.  It only took a few more times before he was shooting his load all over his hand and stomach, quietly moaning Draco’s name.  He continued to stroke himself through the pleasure.
“We totally didn’t this this keeping-a-kid-on-Christmas-Eve thing completely through, did we?”  Harry mumbled as Draco groaned and rubbed his eyes.
Aftermath of the wedding, and then Christmas morning.
They walked down the alley, stopping at the many different stalls, picking up bits and bobs along the way.  As they neared Gringott’s, they saw a Christmas Tree stall.  Harry gripped Draco’s hand as they walked through the trees, looking for the perfect one.
Harry wasn't sure what Draco was working on.  He had seen him talk with McGonagall the morning she had talked about the projects, and had only been seen at meals during the daylight hours, since.
“I’m sorry.  For everything I’ve done.  I know you will never forgive me, but I have to say it.  I've done some horrible things to you over the years, and while nothing I say or do can erase that, I need to apologize.  I’m sorry for making your life a living hell.”
“It is.  Reminds me of winters at Hogwarts,” Draco replied, wrapping his other hand around Harry’s bicep.
McGonagall had told them that they had to wait to leave until the following day when the rest of the students left, but that didn’t bother them; they were planning on having their last Thursday evening party of the term that night.
His conversation with Ginny, while awkward, went really well.  He was absolutely petrified to tell her that the reason he didn’t want to get back together with her was because he realized that he preferred men to women.  He figured he would get his bits hexed off, but when Ginny just laughed a little and said she was planning on breaking it off with him, too, he relaxed.  She giggled a bit and informed him that while he was off doing whatever it was he did last year, she and Neville had gotten really close.  She didn’t know if it would lead to anything, but she wanted to try.  Harry was absolutely thrilled for his friends, and told Ginny as such.
Ron didn’t say anything for a few seconds, causing Harry to finally look up at him.
They watched the beautiful scenery pass them by, occasionally stopping the sleigh to watch animals along the path.  After a while, they came upon a real road, which led to a muggle made tunnel; the caribou turned and started toward it.
“What’s wrong?”
“fork me.”
“Hello, Mr Ollivander.  Er, that’s what I was coming to talk to you about.”
She nodded.  “32 years, now.  My mother decided that, as the only daughter, she would make my wedding the celebration of the century.  We just wanted something quiet, though.  ‘Big’ wasn’t really our thing, so we told our best friends, snuck off to Yorkshire, and got married in a country garden on the side of a hill.  It was beautiful.”
Harry chuckled.  “Alright, I’m going.  I have a therapy session before I go in, as we won’t be here for my normal time slot for the next few days.”
Harry flicked his wand once more, sending a package towards Molly and Arthur.
“Thank you, sir.  Thank you for everything.”  Lucius nodded at him, and then walked back to where Narcissa stood.
McGonagall nodded her head and said her farewell’s again.
“Whenever I wrote the lines on the parchment, it would cut into my hand, and the ink would be my blood.” He practically whispered the last bit, looking down at the ground.  There were gasps from around the circle.
I am sore beyond belief (It's incredible how heavy everything is!) but it was so much fun.
She looked up from her own stack of files, and gave him a smile.  “Have a good evening, sir.”  He rolled his eyes; she was always the first person in in the morning, and the last one out in the evening.
“Close your eyes.  I am going to apparate us to the location of our dessert, but it’s a surprise.  Close your eyes.”
“Okay, great, I’ll have supper ready.”
Draco wracked his brain, and suddenly said, “Actually, that’s not true.”  Harry quickly turned to Draco, who was giving him a knowing look.
“What did you do?”
Day 4 Prompt:
as Harry did with just one touch.
Draco gave him a confused look.
“Just a few more minutes,” Harry said, sifting his fingers through Draco’s hair.
“You shouldn’t have any problems with him today,” Harry whispered to Molly.  “We have an understanding,” he added with a smile.
They all agreed, and once the carriage stopped, they clambered off.  Walking towards the end of the platform, they said their goodbye’s.  Hermione grasped Ron’s arm, and they disappeared with a pop.  Harry turned to Draco, who clasped his hand in Harry’s; Harry thought of the ‘three D’s’ and twisted away towards London.
“You needed to talk to me?”
Harry could hear scrambling, and then the door was wrenched open.
“Think what?” he responded.
“Are you in any pain, Mr Malfoy?”  Madam Pomfrey said as she cast a diagnostic charm over him.
Stepping back into the room, he looked over at Draco, who was perched on the edge of his bed, looking down at his hands.  “Ready?”
Harry woke with a start.  He turned over and looked at the clock on the night stand.  8:22, it read.  He really didn’t feel like getting out of bed, but he knew Ginny was going to be coming over at 9:00, so he had best get himself up and ready to go; he was going to have a busy morning.
“I just can't believe my eyes.  What happened to your three-sizes-too-big clothes, Potter? Finally realize you could have some semblance of style?”
“I know, and that’s how I want it to be; just you and me.  That’s why I agreed to this, but at the same time…”  Toss.
“This is a new world we live in.  This is a new government we are creating.  As such, hate crimes such as this will not be tolerated.  Let this sentence set a precedent to any others that wish to pursue such acts.
“I’m all for that.  Godric, that was amazing.  I love you.”
“He then shook my hand.  It was completely bizarre, if I’m being honest.  But, yeah, the diamond was your grandfather’s.  I thought our birthstones made a nice touch.  I wanted it to be perfect.  To show you how much I love you.”
They both looked back at the photo, which was of the 8th years sitting at their table at the feast. Perfectly normal, except for the fact that you could clearly see Draco and Harry, backs to the camera, holding hands under the table. Just before the loop restarted, they could see Harry scoot a bit closer to Draco’s side, elbows brushing and hands gripping a bit tighter.
“BLOOD TRAITOR!  HALF-BREED MONSTROSITY!  HOW DARE YOU LIVE IN THE MOST NOBLE AND ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK!  GET OUT! GET OUT AND TAKE YOUR FILTH WITH YOU!”
“Merry Christmas,” Andromeda said as Harry gave her a kiss on the cheek, as well.
Intrigued, he opened the door for Bev, and stepped in quickly behind her.  He removed the glamours from their faces, and turned to take in the shop.  Part of the area had racks of clothing, with stacks of beautiful scarves, cloaks, hats, and other accessories.
Draco clutched at his shoulders, running his fingers through Harry’s hair, trying to calm him down.
Draco perked up at that, and so the two of them got off the bed, pulling on their shoes, and going back down to the kitchen.
“I don’t think so.”
“Muggle law.  A person can sue another for money if they feel they have been wronged in one way or another.  Never mind.”
When Harry pulled back from Draco’s lips, Draco tried to follow him.  However, when Harry grabbed the hem of the sweater that Draco had on, the man understood what he was trying to do, and leaned up so that the clothing could be taken off.  Once Draco was relieved of the shirt, he grabbed Harry’s, and ripped it off, too, tossing it over the back of the couch.
“I had some motivation to get it perfect, is all.”
Harry tuned them out, instead turning and walking towards the gate.  He didn't feel like trying to convince Ron that Draco and he were on good terms.  Truce was not a concept Ron would be willing to accept, Harry knew.  As they stepped up to the double winged boars, they all pulled out their wands.  At the same time, they moved their wands in a circle.  The gate, while seemingly still shut, emitted a quick white glow.  They walked through the spires of the gate, and once on the other side, again the gate glowed white.
“Yeah, yes, of course.  I’ll, uh, see you at home?”
Harry took it slow, guiding Draco up and down.  They would pause every few pumps to kiss each other.
Draco woke to sun blazing through the open curtains, which was a new experience for him.  It took him a few moments of to realise where he was, and then he was suddenly wide awake and sitting up in the bed, looking for Harry.
Harry looked into the steel grey eyes, not knowing what to say.  He looked at the floor, trying to wrap his mind around what he’d just been told.  After several long minutes, Harry looked up at Draco, took a step away from the wall and said, “Why could you not have told me all of this that morning, instead of just running away?”
“Exactly!  My brother is dead!  Because of that git’s boss!  He doesn’t deserve to be here!
“How much you want to bet that it’s Hermione and Ron?” Harry asked.
Harry carried Teddy upstairs.  They had definitely worn the baby out; Harry figured he would sleep until Andromeda came to pick him up in a few hours.  Harry smiled as he thought about how adorable Draco looked while holding Teddy.  The way he cooed at the baby made Harry’s stomach twist pleasantly.
“So, Blaise, how’s the new job?”
get married.  In October.”  He gave a slight shudder as he said the word.
“I just can’t believe you know what Indian food is,” Hermione said.
“Not even close,” Draco said with a smirk.
encounter with another man.  Sure, he had snogged some muggles during the summer, just to test the waters, but he certainly didn’t invite them back to his and complete the snogging sessions with an orgasm.  No, that had just been with Draco.
The next week flew by in a blur of amazing food, wonderful sights, and great shopping.  Before they knew it, it was their last full day at the resort; they would be leaving shortly after breakfast the next day.
“So, what’s the special occasion?  We haven’t seen you since before your Birthday,” Andromeda asked whilst pouring the tea.
He stepped out onto the landing, calling out for Draco.
Harry moved off to the side, and pulled Draco into his arms, sighing.  He pulled the sheets up and over them.  He could feel his limbs soften into contentment, and felt his eyes starting to droop.
“Glad to hear it.  You should definitely pop over and see her, though; ease her mind.”
Harry pulled back slowly and said, “You think?  Maybe I will.”  They stood there another couple of seconds, just staring at each other, before Harry said, “While I would rather just stay here and continue kissing you, I figure we’d better get down there.”  He leaned forward again, giving Draco a quick peck.
He looked over to where Draco was seated on a large navy blue couch.  Draco moved over so that Harry could sit down beside him.
“What the…?”
As they sat in the dining room, eating their breakfast, Harry gently nudged his toe into Draco’s ankle.  “What do you want to do, today?”
Yet again, Draco could feel tears forming behind his eyes.  This was normal.  This was his Harry.  He stepped into the room and said a quiet, “I’m home.”
“You know I’m just happy for you, mate,” Harry said with a smile.
.  It’s just like I remembered.”  He turned back and, waving his wand, their bags unpacked themselves, clothes settling in the drawers of the armoire, toiletries floating towards the en-suite.
“It started on my birthday, actually, when we went to Hogwarts; when we were sailing across the lake, just like back in first year.”
He didn’t get too far into the room before Seamus came up and handed him a glass of Firewhiskey.  Harry gratefully took it, and took a deep gulp of it.  It burned all the way down, but once it settled, he reveled at the warmth in the pit of his stomach.  He noticed Neville, Ginny, Luna, and Millicent sitting on the floor in front of the fire, and decided to join them.
“Your tea and papers will be waiting for you when you return,” she replied with a curt nod.
“Okay, long story, short?  You know how I gave Malfoy back his wand before we went back to Hogwarts?  Well, before-hand, I asked Ollivander about how to properly do it.  He told me about a ritual that we should do, and we thought we did it right, but apparently something happened, because we both suddenly felt as if our arms were being licked by Fiendfyre.”
Draco looked down at Harry as he was washing Draco.  “Oh my gods.  That was a—amazing.”  He was still shaking with aftershocks.
~*~*~
Draco reached over to the bedside table, picking up Harry’s glasses.  He pulled open the arms and handed them to Harry, who slipped them on.  “It’s about 9:00. I’m sorry to wake you, but my mother and Professor McGonagall are down in your sitting room.”
Looking around at his friends eating their breakfast and making plans for their weekend, Harry looked at his watch.  Seeing it was nearing 10:00, he decided he'd better hurry and go to the library to finish his Charms essay that was due on Monday.  He was going to head to Grimmauld as soon as Potions was over, and he seriously doubted he would even think of picking up a book on the weekend.
“I beg to differ, you know,” Harry said quietly, as he pulled Draco’s face towards him.  “I love you so much more,” he said before pressing their lips together in a sweet, sweaty kiss.
Until next time!!  ~B.
“I can.  He is far more perceptive than we ever were, isn’t he?”
“I love you, more,” Draco said, sliding his hand into Harry’s hair and bringing him back down into another kiss.
? Well, then, let’s make him miserable.  I truly wish I could take everything back.  Truly.  If I knew then, what I know now…”
“Oh, Godric, it’s been too long.  I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.  fork!  fork fork fork fork!  I—”
“I asked Tom to make you a Shark Bite, since I know you don’t drink wine anymore.  It’s a muggle drink; I saw the recipe on the internet, and thought you’d like it,” he said to Draco, before putting his arm around his shoulder.
Draco and Harry smiled at each other as Narcissa got up and gave Molly a hug.  “Thank you.”  Molly just nodded her head and presented Andromeda her gift.
“I swear Potter, you need all of this for the kitchen.  It will be perfect.”
“Like what, Ron?” Harry actually thought this was a brilliant idea.
“It’s okay, Ted.  Shhh, it’s okay.”  Harry started bouncing Teddy, trying to calm the boy and himself down at the same time.
“Well.”
“Would you make up your mind?” He asked, turning in just his pants, arms akimbo on his hips.
“Get some sleep, won’t you?”  He gave Harry a pointed look.  “I love you, and will see you in the morning.”
“Stop it, or you won’t be going back to work!”
“Show off,” Draco said as he stepped fully into the room.
Harry laughed, pecking a kiss on Draco’s cheek.
“Good or bad things?”
He needed to figure out what in the hell he wanted to do about this thing with Draco.  They definitely were going to need to talk some more, and he needed to know how Draco felt about their relationship.  He sighed loudly as he sat up in bed; he knew trying to get back to sleep was moot.
“See? Make yourself at home; food and music is downstairs, muggle television across the hall, etcetera. I'll go get the door and be right back!”
“Do you have any idea as to what happened?  I know you said that it was possible for me to still be able to use his wand, but this seemed a bit more intense than just that.”
“Give me a couple of hours of schmoozing the Minister, and I'll make sure it happens,” Harry said as he closed the distance between the two men.
“No, wait.  What were you going to say?”
“Used to what?  Holding an attractive man in your arms as you take a nap?”
They turned back to Hermione, who placed a ring in each of their upturned hands.
“Draco.  Oh, babe! I’m—I’m—AHHHH!”
Draco lifted the powder once again, but Harry again said, “Wait!  Where is your ring?”
“I'll be here.” He pecked Harry on the cheek with a chuckle when Harry reached in front of him to open the door, before stepping out onto the front stoop.  “Bye.”
Today's Prompt:
“I think it will be fun, no matter who comes.  I invited George and Angelina, and I think Angelina was going to contact Alicia and Katie.  I have a feeling others will just show up, too.  We will just have to wait and see how many come, I guess.”
Harry smiled as he asked, “Thank you.  While I’m here, though, I—”
“Oh my god, what happened?”
~*~*~*~*~
Harry grinned as he saw his best mate interacting with the customers.  Harry nudged Hermione, whispering in her ear, “He’s so great at this.”
Harry spoke to Kreacher, and then they made their way to the entry way.  Draco accio’d his coat, which he had left upstairs, and once Harry put on his, they went out the front door, turning right.
Today's prompt:
He shrugged.  “For being you.  For being here.  For it all.”
“Thank you,” Draco whispered, moving forward to kiss Harry.  “Now, hurry up, we have to meet McGonagall in 20 minutes.”
Draco kicked him under the table, causing Harry to grin even wider.
"How long?"
Beverly McGovern had been Harry’s secretary since he had taken this position, the year before.  She had been the previous head’s secretary, so she basically came with the promotion, but that didn’t stop Harry from making her his confidante.
Harry cocked his head.  “Huh?”
Everyone was nodding and talking excitedly to their neighbors as the Headmistress walked back up to the head table and sat down.  As soon as she sat, food appeared on the tables, and Harry forgot about all of the problems facing him as he caught sight of all of his favorite foods.
,” Harry said with a smirk.  Draco turned and gave him a look, but Harry just grinned and said, “Oh, come on!  You opened the opportunity right up for me!  I had to take it!”
“No, no, she didn’t say anything.  I just saw the anger in her eyes when she looked at me.  But, she… She told me where you were, so…”
Harry smiled, saying, “I know.”
Harry stepped out of the fireplace into a lush living room with sky blue walls, deep navy carpet, and beautiful purple plush chairs and a grey couch.  Lying in the center of a white blanket in the middle of the floor was Teddy.  Harry walked over to the child and picked him up.  It had taken a few months not to be absolutely terrified of holding the baby, and while Harry still didn’t know what he was doing, the child in his arms made him feel more confident and comfortable.  It was almost as if Teddy exuded trust onto Harry.
“I can see that.  What about a couple of nice chairs over in the corner, with maybe a small table?”  He grabbed the pad out of Harry’s hands, reaching around Harry’s back and taking out the muggle pencil that he knew was in Harry’s back pocket.  Harry had picked it up on their last trip to the lumber store, and Draco knew he carried it around with him whenever they were working on the house.
“What kind of game?”
“Eloquent as always, love,” Draco said as he walked into the kitchen the next morning.
Harry had taken Draco’s ring from him a couple days before, and had gone and gotten it engraved.  He slipped it onto Draco’s finger, who then took Harry’s hand, slipping a beautiful while gold ring with a simple line of yellow gold through the middle onto Harry’s finger.  He stretched his fingers, loving the feeling of it on his finger.
“So, what does all that mean?”
“Harry, please,” he whispered.  “I didn’t know how to get rid of him.  I’m sorry.  I—”
I can now be found Tumblr-- https://hedwig4evr.tumblr.com/
Harry couldn’t help but smile, and he noticed one growing on the face in front of him, as well.  Maybe this year really would be great.
“That won’t be necessary,” Harry said harshly, arms crossed against his chest.  “I’ll figure out a way to make sure you get it back, and that you are filled in on what is learned, today.  There’s no reason for you to come here.”
“I don’t know where to start!  Come on, let’s go take a look.”
Harry winked before he moved to crawl up the bed to straddle Draco’s waist, but was stopped by Draco’s elegant foot being pressed into his chest.
Harry awoke sometime later.  The room was still pitch black, and his arms were still wrapped around Draco, but Harry was now laying on his back, and the Slytherin was now laying half-way on top of Harry.
Harry gripped his hand, pulling them both forward.  They walked down the aisle, looking at both sides to see their old classmates, all of the Weasley’s, friends from the ministry, including Beverly, Kingsley, and Robards, and people they hadn’t seen in what felt like years.
He turned his head and caught the eye of a tall Barn owl.  He walked towards it, and it rustled its feathers.  As he came up to its perch, the owl lifted its right leg, almost as if to shake his hand.
“Ferret wanted to show me something.  You two were talking, so it gave us the opportunity.”
“Well, Hermione and I were talking.  You two aren’t ‘out’ to the public, yet…  His name has been in the papers all week leading up to this…”
“Hmmm… Want to share a shower,” Harry whispered against Draco’s ear.  They held hands as they walked into the en suite.
They thanked him, and Draco said ‘ga’, which caused them to start moving down the snow-covered trail.
“How long do you think we have?”
Exactly 33 minutes later, they joined Teddy down in the sitting room.  Luckily, he had listened, and was (im)patiently waiting on everyone else to come down.  As Harry walked in the room, he jumped up from his seat at the table, which was covered in a large Christmas breakfast, and ran over to jump up and down in front of Harry.
Harry looked sheepishly up at her.  “Sorry, Professor.  It’s just…”  He knew he would have to speak to the press at some point, and while it would be better that it be sooner rather than later, he still wasn’t too keen on the idea.  “What do I say?” he asked the room in general.
“Yeah, until it wasn’t.”  Harry sighed, running his hand through his hair.  Sitting there, he thought back on the past couple of weeks.  “We really had only been ‘a couple’ for two weeks,” he said, using air quotes.  “We had a great day, Saturday, finishing the kitchen, taking care of Teddy.  It was…yeah.  It was great.”  Harry could feel his cheeks heating up, trying to avoid looking at Ron.
I still don't know where I'm going with this, but I kind of figure there will be about 3 or 4 more chapters...maybe.  And hopefully it won't be another 2 years before the next chapter goes up... Fingers crossed.
“You’ve done absolutely nothing wrong,” he repeated.  “Let’s just go to sleep, alright? We can talk in the morning.”
Teddy nodded his head, still looking at the table.  “Yeah.  Usually, I’d see him at least a couple of days a week, but, I’ve only seen him like, twice, since his birthday, and he barely spoke to me then.”
Harry looked up at Draco, who bent Harry in half to kiss him.  “Touch yourself for me.”
Harry took the silk and threw it on the couch.  Holding the Hawthorne by the tip in his left hand, he pulled his wand out of his holster, swished it around the Hawthorne, and said the spell Ollivander had taught him.  “I surrender the powers that be.”  He looked up at Malfoy, who was looking at Harry.  As their eyes latched onto each other, he could feel the wand in his left hand getting warmer.
“I know for a fact she wouldn’t.  She told me just a few weeks ago how long it had been since she’d seen her.  Alright.  Let the fun begin!”  He smiled as he tugged Draco up to their room.
“For… for this.  For this trip.  For coming back to me.”
With a still confused look, Draco numbly nodded his head, and followed Harry as he made his way to the restaurant.  Draco stood quietly next to Harry as the man ordered their food, and then followed as Harry started walking back to Grimmauld.
Harry and Draco grinned at them, wiping their own eyes.  “Brilliant.”
“What are we doing here? The sooner we find out, the sooner you can get back to bed,” Blaise said with a wink.
“Truth or Dare.”
“Anyone sitting here?” he asked, sitting across from Draco.
“Oh, Harry, it’s beautiful.”
“Language, Mr Potter,” McGonagall said.
Harry had felt overwhelmed just glancing at it, and while they hadn’t really discussed it, he knew Draco felt the same way.  He was hoping that they could actually talk to the women, tonight.
He sat down on the couch, and pulled Harry down next to him. They sat staring at each other, before Draco took a deep breath and leaned in to kiss Harry. Harry hummed as he leant into the kiss.
“Mr Malfoy, I’m sorry to barge into your home so early on a Saturday, but I just received information from the ministry.  The Aurors originally wanted to be the ones to speak to you, but as you are still at Hogwarts, you are still under by jurisdiction, and I felt I should be the one to come.  You will still probably receive an owl at some point this morning, though.”
He pulled back, looking into Harry’s eyes.  “For everything.  We still need to talk about a lot of things, but I am so happy that I am still allowed to do this,” he said pecking a kiss on Harry’s lips.  “I will see you in a few hours.  Get some sleep—you won’t be getting any tomorrow if I have my way.”
“Hello, Minister,” Harry said, shaking his hand.  “How have you been?”
Harry smirked, pushing in further.  “Nah, you won’t.”
Draco felt Harry’s finger slide over his perineum, and his breath caught in his throat as a finger flicked over his hole.  That was all it took for him to start coming down Harry’s throat.  Harry drank it all, keeping him in his mouth until Draco moaned again.
They grinned at each other as Teddy told them about school, and his teachers.  Harry loved spending time with his godson, and he knew that Draco felt the same way.
“He’s in there,” he said, nodding towards the dining room.  “I think he is talking with Wood and Zabini.”
“Oh, I’m so happy to see you!  To see you both!  Come, sit down.  How about some hot chocolate?”
Draco sighed, and Harry could hear shuffling as the phone was passed off.
“Blaise is right; just being there for him is plenty enough.  Just, make sure you’re both prepared for today.”
“It’s just like I said.  We can’t be together.  I—I don’t like you.”
There was a moment of silence before Harry took a step toward Draco.
Draco shrugged his shoulders.  “Bill and Fleur, too.  Well, that’s the majority of them, anyway, so might as well just go for the whole family.”  He scribbled names onto the letters.  Harry typed up messages to those that he knew had mobiles.  “Aunt Andromeda and Teddy, of course.  Pansy, Blaise, Theo.  Luna.  Neville and Susan?  Haven’t seen them in a while.”
Just as he walked through the doorway, they floo flared up, Ron and Hermione stepping through, each carrying an overnight bag.
“You don’t have to make me breakfast,” Draco said, quietly.
“Me, too! Almost…th—“
Draco pulled back, again saying, “I should go.”
“What happened with your families, though?”
“Potter, Weasley, Longbottom, Malfoy, and Zibini: you all are in dorm one.  Corner, Thomas, Finnigan, Finch-Fletchley, and Macmillan: dorm two.  I will leave you gentlemen to get settled in.”
“You said you found the recipe on the Internet?” Draco asked, pulling back just enough that he could look Harry in the eyes, but that Harry’s hand stayed in his hair.
Draco tried to believe the earnestness coming from her, but he was still worried.  “Thank you, Hermione,” he said meekly.  “I just don’t know what I’ll do if…”
~*~*~*~*~
“I got you your favourite,” Harry said as he pushed a container with Shrimp Scampi across the table.  “I put a warming charm on it, so it should stay the perfect temperature until the last bite.”
“Those were some mighty fine beards.  I was slightly disappointed when Poppy removed them,” George said, with a smile and a sigh.  “Thanks, Harry.  This is brilliant.”  He looked up at Harry, his eyes watery, too.  “Seriously.  Brilliant.”  He looked back down as he took Angelina’s hand.
It wasn’t meant to be, though.  No sooner had Harry linked his hands together, then Draco gave a mild grunt and shifted his weight again.  Harry, knowing Draco was waking up, couldn’t restrain himself any longer and carefully leaned down and kissed the top of Draco’s head.  Draco stiffened, and slowly pulling back, turned his head to look at Harry.
With his other hand, he skimmed down Draco’s chest, circling his nipples, but not touching.  He thrust deep into Draco’s channel, causing him to scream in pleasure and frustration.
Pulling back, he said, “Indeed.”
As they entered Harry’s room, Draco latched his lips back onto Harry’s.  Harry kicked the door shut, moving their bodies toward the bed.  They released each other as they kicked off their shoes and fell onto the bed.  They moved so that their heads were on the pillows.  Harry leaned in again, giving Draco a chaste kiss.
Harry turned towards Draco.  “I love you, Draco.  That ring around your neck is a sign of my love for you.  And I know you love me.  Very much.”
The flames flared up, and in walked Mrs Malfoy, followed seconds later by Draco.
He paused another moment before jerking his hips up slightly, letting Draco know he could move when he was ready.
“Are you all okay?”
“That’s a brilliant idea!  We haven’t seen in him in such a long time.”
Draco shook his head as he watched the witch walk away, and then followed the trio out of the room and back out into the corridor.
Draco wrapped his legs around Harry’s torso, which gave Harry the space to reach around and sneak his hand between the man’s crack, rubbing his finger against the puckered hole.  This caused Draco to begin frotting in a frenzy.
As he neared the door, he heard what sounded like humming.  He quietly pushed open the door and smiled at the sight before him.
Harry silenced him with a kiss.  He pulled back with a shake of his head.  “There’s nothing to thank me for.  Come on, let’s go to sleep.”
Harry glanced over at Draco, slight blush on his cheeks and busily stuffing his mouth with food.  Glancing back up at the owl sitting in front of him, he said, “Orion, huh?  Does that sound okay to you?  Orion?”  He pet the bird’s head, and received a peck on his finger.  “Okay, Orion it is.”
Ron stared down at it as Mr Jewell explained what he had done and the extra things he had added.
“Well, I’m alive, and not much worse off than when I left, thankfully.  There wasn’t much ‘mortal peril’-esque drama this time around.  Mainly it was just hiding out in abandoned warehouses and dwellings that had the possibility of falling in around our ears at any moment, to be honest.  There were quite a few nights that we wondered if we would survive until dawn, as the building creaked and groaned every time the wind blew.  That’s one way to get your adrenaline pumping, for sure.”
He pulled his wand from the holster, and quietly made his way down to the kitchen.
“Thank you, Professor,” Draco said.
“Yes, I believe they would have called you in, which causes me to suspect that it wasn't just your magic at play in this.”
Getting to the Apparition point, he swiftly pulled out his wand and twisted, hurtling himself through space and landed in front of the brick wall that led to the Leaky Cauldron.  He grinned at the sight of the people that meandered their way down the alley; it had been so sparse of people for far too long.
“Fine.  Kiss me first, though,” Draco said with smirk.
Harry gave him a puzzled look, but Draco just shooed him out of the room.
Blaise gave him another fuming look, clearing his gaze as the other man came back to the table with drinks for himself and Draco.  Harry noticed that he had gotten Draco a glass of Chardonnay, which Harry knew Draco no longer drank; after having a very bad night of getting far too drunk, and proceeding to projectile vomit across his bedroom, Draco gave up wine.
Harry smiled back.  “Me, either.  I'll see you in a few hours.”
He was interrupted at a quick knock on the door, and Clarice sticking her head in.
“Then, the Battle happened.  The Room of Requirement happened.  Yes, you were still a bastard, but looking back, I understand a bit more why you did what you did.  I wish I could change what transpired that night, but I suppose if things were different, we wouldn’t be here, now.”
Draco broke his wrists from Harry loose grip, wrapping them around Harry’s neck and tugging him back down into a languid kiss. Harry broke it momentarily to carefully extricate himself from inside Draco, but quickly slipped his tongue back into the warm mouth as he turned them so that they were lying on their sides, facing each other, letting each other catch their breath.
Harry was pleased with all of the “ooh’s” and “aah’s” that were emitted at the right times.
“How are we going to get this stuff back to Grimmauld?  I don’t have a car.  It’s under a Fidelius, so I can’t have it delivered.  Shite, I thought it was going to be easier to go to a muggle place.  I didn’t even think of the getting it home part.”
“If we don’t stop now, I won’t be able to stop later.”
Shaking hands with Mr Chumes, Harry walked back down the hall and into the reception area.  Saying goodbye to the receptionist, he made his way back out into the street.
“Wow, Harry.  This place looks amazing!”
“Thanks.”
“Absolutely.”  Harry sighed as he turned and leant back into Draco’s chest, watching Teddy pick up two boxes and bring them back to the sofa.  He turned his head, letting Draco lean in and give him a kiss.
Today's Prompt:
“Circe, this is going to be a huge bash, isn’t it?”
Harry pulled him down for a kiss.  “Yes, I do.  I love you.”
“Good morning, Darling!  Here’s your coffee, and the memos that were waiting for me this morning,” she said brightly.
Harry noted that there was a new fountain, and ducked his head even further as he realized that it was a statue of himself, wand pointed up, as if casting a spell, where the water was pouring out of.  He could feel his cheeks getting redder, and upon glancing over at Draco, saw that he too realised what he was looking at, and smirked over at Harry.
“Free period, but I figured I’d just go to the library and maybe kick this Charms essay out before lunch.”
Harry showed Narcissa and Draco the different rooms on each floor, telling them his plans for each, making their way downstairs.  On the first floor, Harry walked over to the drawing room.  “This is the drawing room, which has the Black family tree in it.  Both of your names are on here, of course.”  Seeing the looks on both Malfoy faces, Harry showed them into the room.  “I can’t bring myself to take it down, for some reason, even though the people that mean the most to me have been burned off,” beckoning to the names of Sirius and Andromeda.  Narcissa walked over to the tapestry, and lightly touched the spot where Andromeda’s name had once been.
Pulling on clean pants and pajama bottoms on, he found a plain white shirt, and put that on.  He shivered before casting another warming charm on the room.  Now that he had figured out the electricity charm, he needed to figure out a way to install a muggle air conditioning/heater unit into the house.
Harry held out Draco’s seat, helping him take off his coat, and then brushing his hands over Draco’s back as he moved to sit across from him.  The girl gave them their menus, informing them their waiter would be with them shortly.
Harry smiled as he leant in for a kiss.  “I love you.  Together, I think we could conquer the world.  I can’t wait to spend the rest of my days with you by my side.”
He was brought out of his reverie by Teddy poking his cheek.  He laughed as Draco yelped in surprise, and then started laughing when Draco countered by tickling him.
Harry opened his eyes to find a flushed Draco, bruised lips and all, standing before him, breathing just as hard as Harry was.
“So I’ve been told.”
“Yes, love.  I’ve got everything in my bag, which is downstairs and ready to go when we get home this evening.  Portkey leaves at 6:45, so I will be home no later than 6:15.”
“Good luck, mate!” Neville called after the trio as they went to the floo.
Sudden recognition bloomed bright on Harry’s face, as his cheeks reddened.  Draco smirked.  “Oh.  Yeah.  I remember, now.”
Draco sighed as he nodded, and then stepped back over to the table.  Harry set his cloak on the edge of the sofa, and followed him.
Teddy pulled both of their arms down the street, stopping to look at nearly everything.  He oohed and ahhed at the toy brooms, which Harry popped in and purchased while Draco kept Teddy occupied at the booth with the roasting chestnuts.  They wandered down to Twilfitt and Tatting’s where Draco told Teddy to pick something out for his nana.  He chose a gorgeous teal-coloured robe, which Harry was sure Andromeda would love.
to befriend Malfoy.  She had been getting to know Draco, studying together, working on projects together, etc., and knew that they would get along if they would just get over themselves.
After a moment of awkward silence, Ron said, “Well, this will definitely be an experience, won’t it?”
Harry sat at his desk, doing more paperwork.  Bev had brought in another pile of things that needed his signature.  He glanced at the clock, and realized that he would need to hurry, or he would be late.
Taking a deep breath, Harry said, “Well, I still have your wand.  I thought you might want it back.”
Harry wrapped his arm around Draco’s shoulders and said, “This looks amazing!”
Harry smiled.  “They won’t work around the house, but maybe we can decorate the outside of the shed!”
“Again, that was my plan.  I’ve never been one who can do interior design, but I am trying.  I am just finding things that make me happy, and seeing if I can work them in somehow.”
“Yes, sir.”
He trudged downstairs to the bathroom and washed his face.
He put his cloak on the hook, and then slumped onto the couch, pulling out his mobile to text Draco.
“Again, no more apologies!  Oh, I can already picture the front of the resort with snow on the ground, and a Christmas tree all lit up!  When are we going?”  His face grew serious as he started imagining all of the things he would need to pack, and what he would need to get done before they left.
“No, it is not.  You may have been the only one to stop it, but this is not on you.  Voldemort was the cause of all this, and you stopped him from making it far worse than it is.  Because of you, more people are
“Are you completely packed?”
Draco huffed, whispering back, “Oh, not you, too.”
“Indeed.  I don’t remember that fountain over there,” he said, motioning to a beautiful water fountain that was in the far corner.  The water gave the room a calming feel.  Light music played in the background.
“Well, yes.  It belongs to you, after all.  So, it that a yes?”
“That’s great!  So, why are you just now getting back?  If it was that easy, you should have been back before lunch.”
“Draco said something about him disappearing, and that was how he got to my stoop?”
“Yes, it was.”
“Wait, really?”
Harry stood up and walked toward the door, but realized immediately that a silence and a locking spell had been put in place.  He walked back to sit by Hermione, who had a worried look on her face.
“I’m glad you all like them.  There are tons more, too.  I asked Dennis if I could have more, and he told me to take as many as I wanted.  He is going to bring them by next week, so if any of you want to, I’ll let you know when he comes over.”
When the woke up on Saturday, though, they both were in preparation mode; their surprise engagement party was that evening.
Harry was finishing wiping down his clothes and checking his pockets, when he heard a quiet, “Hey,” behind him.  Turning, he saw Draco standing in the doorway of his bedroom.  He was wearing black fitted trousers and a dark grey button-up shirt.  Harry felt his own trousers tighten as blood fled south.
Teddy giggled, while Draco laughed and said, “Oh, I’m definitely going to tell him that.”
Walking outside, they saw that the carriages were lined up awaiting the students, so they decided to take one to the train station, and then apparate from there, instead of walking through the snow.
They smiled at each other, leaning in for another kiss, when they heard a small cough behind them.  They turned around to see Professor McGonagall standing in front of the doors to the Great Hall.
“Morning.”
“I missed you,” Draco whispered against his lips, panting, smile lighting up his face.
A few minutes later, Narcissa and Lucius arrived, followed by Molly and Arthur, George and Angelina, Bill, and Victoire.  Pansy arrived a little bit later, Blaise and Greg in tow, and then Ginny, Seamus, Dean, Neville, and Hannah fell out of the floo one right after the other.
Draco whined louder, but dutifully gripped the headboard with both hands.
“I’m not laughing at you, mate.  I’m laughing at the excited faces on these two,” Ron said as he gestured to Hermione and Ginny.  The two did in fact have identical thrilled faces.
Harry woke with a start.   Breathing hard, he tried to calm his heart beat down.
Harry startled.  “For what?”
“I had been out all day with Pansy and Blaise, so when I got home and she told me, I was absolutely furious.  The first place I could think of was here.  I’m sorry about that, just crawling into your bed.  I just…  I just needed to be near you,” he whispered.
He was nearly to the other corner on the same end wall when he was startled by a laugh behind him.  Turning, he saw that Draco was standing in the doorway of the room.  “Of course you would have Gryffindor banners in your room.  However, after the revelation you told me earlier, I can’t believe you have
of his fellow 8
“No, my appointments are on Tuesday and Friday evenings.  And my classes are on Monday and Thursday.  I… er… when I need to get out of my head on the other nights, I take my cloak and just walk around.  A couple of times, I apparated to the coast, and just stared at the ocean for hours at a time.  One time I went to Shell Cottage, under my cloak, and sat at Dobby’s grave.”
“I love you more.  Now, go get some of that pudding.  And, take some to Bev, too!  She deserves it for me so brilliant.  And also, so I don’t eat it all.”
“Good morning, sir.  Is there something I can help you with?”
“They did not like magic.  Because of this, I lived in the cupboard under the stairs.  That was my room.  I—”
“My crying woke him up, and when he stumbled over to find out what was wrong, I yelled at him to leave me alone. He ignored me, though, and sat next to me, trying to console me. He’s actually really quiet and kind. Think in another life, he would have been placed in Hufflepuff.” Draco smiled to himself.
Draco gripped the railing.  “Excuse me?”
“Thanks, Pot—um, Harry.  Am I the first to arrive?”
Harry stepped through the floo.  He dusted himself off, shaking his head to try and get the dust out of it.  He had used one of the Auror floo’s, and they were exceptionally dirty.
He was afraid of lifting his legs, no matter how many times Harry told him to try it, so they just pulled him around, his legs firmly locked at the knees.
.  Working with Dragons gave him muscles in places Harry didn’t even know had muscles.  Harry caught himself once or twice staring at the man, but it seemed no one else noticed, thankfully.
“It is, believe me.  I’ve been working with George on the weekends since term started, though, so I have it.  And besides, she’s worth it, you know?”
Suddenly, Draco stopped, looked at Harry, and then quickly looked down at the ground.  Harry stopped as well, with a questioning look on his face.
“Well… come here, let’s sit down.”  He pulled Draco toward their bed, the bottom drawer still wide open, and things spread around it.
Harry could see Ron’s shoulders sag with relief, before he, too, leant into Hermione.  They pulled apart, Ron taking the box out of her hand.  He undid the chain from the packaging, holding it up in order to clasp it around Hermione’s neck.  She pulled her hair up, and as soon as Ron had fastened it, Hermione clutched it with the fingers of her right hand, grabbing Ron’s hand with her left.
Harry’s grip on him tightened as he pulled him closer against his chest.  “Oh, Draco.”  He kissed his shoulder.  “It wasn’t real.  Nothing bad is going to happen to you, I promise.”
“Love…you…more!  AH!” He punctuated each word with a thrust before he was overcome in ecstasy.  He came, gasping, continuing to drive into Draco.
“I grew up with Muggles.  No such thing as a House Elf.”
“Come on, Harry.  This is Malfoy we are talking about.  How do you know you can trust him?” Dean asked.
“So, What shall we do today?”
Harry went to sit on his old cot, which still sat against the wall across from Ron’s bed.  “Sorry to barge in, but I just received the most bizarre letter from Pansy, and had to tell someone.”
“Don’t,” Harry said, raising his hand to cup Draco’s face.
Pansy gave Hermione a conspiratorial smirk, and patted Draco on the cheek.  “Nothing for you to worry your pretty, little head about, Darling.  Have a good weekend, you lot.” Smiling once again at Hermione, Pansy turned and walked over to their room.
Harry got another wash of warmth as he thought of Draco and Hermione, walking down the hall, talking about their tests.  It was incredible how much everything had changed in the past seven months, since the war ended.
Standing up, he awaited his guests.  He found himself extremely nervous of coming face to face with Narcissa Malfoy again, but the prospect of getting rid of the furniture that creeped him out made him giddy, too.  However, how did he greet her?  Did he shake her hand? Kiss it? Did he bow?  He didn’t know too much about pureblood decorum.
“Good afternoon, Headmistress.”
so you'll leave this house?” Harry chuckled, rolling his eyes.
Harry nodded, adding, “Just call for me if you need anything.”
“I do, forever and always,” he grinned, tears streaming down his face as he stared deep into Draco’s eyes.
Grinning, he said, “So, Neville, when did you fall in love with my ex-girlfriend?”
Harry grinned predatorily, pulling Draco flush against him.  “Now
He took the brochure from her hands, looking at the pictures of a picturesque villa, with a gazebo beside a large pond, with the sun setting in the background.  He had to admit it was beautiful, but one look at Draco’s face and he knew he shouldn’t say so.
“That… was… incredible,” Draco gasped out.  “
“Like you said, we can do it whenever and wherever we want to.  Just need someone to do the ceremony and a couple of witnesses.  And actually, I think I have the perfect place and the perfect person to do it.”
Harry just shrugged his shoulders, and heard as the rest of the group moved into the hall and sat down.  He moved down a spot, so Zabini—Blaise—could sit down across from Draco.  Parkinson—
Draco played with his fingers a moment, flexing them back, before looking up into Harry’s eyes and saying, “Do you still hate me?”
Harry turned around and gaped.  The trousers were now a deep charcoal grey, and hung perfectly on his hips, fitted to his thighs and glaring out just slightly around the calves.
“Good afternoon, everyone.  Thank you all for coming a few days before the rest of the student body.  I wanted to get you acquainted with the way things are going to go for you all this year, as well as get you to help with the last few finishing touches of the castle’s renovations.
Ron laugher as he clapped him on the back.  “Well, glad I could help with that! I guess I’ll leave you to your work.  Maybe we’ll see you this weekend?”
, he thought to himself.
“As you can see, there aren’t that many of you attending this year.  Because of this, I have mixed up the living arrangements.  Since there are just the five of you ladies, you all will be together in one room.  The door on the right will lead you to your room.”
Draco scowled.  “I ran into him outside the ministry, and he kind of just followed me.  I tried to lose him, but he’s persistent, as you know.  I didn’t know what else to do.”
“Okay, do we want to split up, or just go as a group?” Hermione asked.
“I know you mean well.  I really do.  But, the only person I
“Merry Christmas” Teddy grinned, hugging Draco, and then gripping both of their hands and practically pulling them towards the doors.
“Well, that’ what we kind of figure,” Draco said, looking to Harry.
Draco sighed in defeat, pulling back and chuckling at the look on Harry’s face.  “Perfect timing, as always.”
“Wait, really?”
“Oh, love, you’ve got it all!  And if not, guess what?”
“Get married.  The question that they kept asking was when the big day was.  I think, once you’re married, they will have to find something else to gossip about.”
After breakfast, they bundled Teddy up and went out into the back garden, which had a fresh coating of fluffy white snow.  They spent the better part of two hours building a snow man, occasionally taking a break to throw snowballs at each other.
“He came! Father Christmas came!  Come on, come on! Uncle Draco! Uncle Harry!  Let’s go!”
Draco, having just been wished good-night by Madam Pomfrey, lay on his cot, looking at the white ceiling.  It had been a long day of doses of Skele-gro , trying to intermediately find sleep, and visits from Aurors, all of his fellow 8
Harry, who was skirting around the edge of the table to place another plate, nearly tripped over the feet of the end chair at Ron’s voice.
“Huh.  Who would have guessed?”
“She gave me a clean bill of health, though, so there’s that.”  He looked again around the common room.  “Where is everyone?  I figured they would all be here, studying.”
“Now, apparently, I can use his wand completely, and he, mine.  We haven’t tried it, though.  Neither of us have had any problems with our wand, though, either, so we’re not quite sure what it all means.”
Harry turned, so he was the little spoon, and Draco wrapped his arm around Harry’s waist.
“Uncle Harry?  Uncle Draco?”
“Okay.  You know where to find me if you change your mind.”  Harry looked at the worry lines on his best mate’s face, and wondered when they had gotten so old at such a tender age.
“Professor!  No, excuse me, Head Mistress,” Harry said with a smile.
“Andy, we’ll be fine, I promise.  You just go and have a bit of a break, yeah?”
Harry landed in the dark Leaky Cauldron, and waved over to Hannah who stood behind the bar.
Harry grabbed the lube again, coating his fingers.  Draco was still breathing hard, but pulled his legs back up to his chest when Harry settled down between them.  Harry gently pushed one finger against the puckering hole, and pushed until it slid in.  Draco gasped as Harry pumped it in and out.  He then gently inserted a second, scissoring them until Draco was squirming on the bed.
“Why not? You know this is your ho—” He was cut off as Draco pulled him in for a deep kiss.
“Hey, buddy.  Did you sleep well?  Huh?”  He cooed at his godson as he lifted the boy out of the cot and placed him on the changing bureau.  “Such a good baby.  Let’s get you cleaned up and then see about some breakfast, yeah?”
“You’re welcome, but, that’s not what I’m talking about.”  Seeing the serious look in the grey eyes, Harry placed his silverware on his plate and crossed his arms on the table.
“Well! I was just informed I'm supposed to give a speech of good tidings or something, so here goes! Thank you all so much for coming over tonight. It's been wonderful to get to speak with you all and find out what everyone's been up to.
“You have been helping me renovate this house, so I would think you’d know som—.”
The elf bowed, disapparating with a pop.
Draco gasped softly before quickly nodding his head, pulse picking up.  Harry pulled him closer, releasing his arm to cup his cheek.  “I’m glad you’re here,” Harry said before leaning in and pressing a kiss to his lips.
“Enough apologising.  I understand why you did what you did.”  They were quiet for a few moments, just holding each other.  “Just… just promise me you’ll talk to me if something like this happens again?  You don’t have to do this alone.”
Hermione stepped out of the sitting room onto the landing and looked down at him.  “Oh, Harry!  This is amazing!”
Thank you, again, for reading!
As they walked into the bright white building, Harry could swear he kept hearing muttered “thieves” as they walked down the row of Goblins.  He didn’t think they would ever truly be forgiven for their past discretions.
Harry stepped into his closet and summoned the wrapped gifts that were on the top shelf.
Draco just shook his head with a small smile. He looked over at Weasley, who was staring at him with a slight glare, before he turned and looked at Dean.  “I'm looking for Harry.  Do you know where he is?”
“Right-o, mate!”
“I’m glad you came tonight, Draco.  I have—we need to talk more about what this is.  What we are.”
Harry’s crying eventually subsided, and he pulled back from Draco, who just gently wiped his eyes.
Harry went into the pantry and saw that Kreacher had bought some walnuts and chestnuts, so he pulled them out and handed the back to Teddy.  He took them and arranged them around the candles.  Harry flicked his wrist, and the candles were lit.
Harry felt guilty, once again, as he thought of how much he had ignored Colin during their years at Hogwarts.  The boy had been everywhere, though, and now Harry was finding himself appreciative of that.
“So. Now, what? We only have the rest of today and tomorrow before we have to go back to Hogwarts, and I’d like to take my boyfriend on an actual date! What do you say?”
“Handsome owl.”
“It’s not important.  I just—”
“My wand.”
“No!”  The way Draco said it, startled Harry.
They sat around the tree, Draco distributing the gifts to everyone.  They each took turns opening their gifts from everyone, letting the rest of the group ‘ooh’ and ‘aah’ over everything.
“Well, I don’t guess that is too bad.  I was afraid it was going to mean we were going to have to kill each other or something.”
“Ah! There it is!”  Harry grinned at him.  “I appreciate the effort, though, no matter the reason.”  He kissed him quickly before turning to grab his cloak and a piece of parchment, quill, and ink.
“Why not?  I’ve always been curious about how the famous Harry Potter grew up.  You mentioned a couple weeks ago that you did most of the cooking, and that really piqued my interest.”
“Not entirely, but I figure it's an apology for whatever the hell he did to you.”
If you’ve stuck around, and commented on this, I APPRECIATE YOU!  I suck at responding, and honestly don’t know what to say in response, but know that I read them, and die of happiness with each positive comment!
This night had definitely not gone the way he thought it would have, but somehow, he’d still ended up in bed with Draco.  I’ll take whatever I can get, he thought to himself as he closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep.
“It’s us, love.  After all the shite that we’ve been through over the years, before and after we were married, we can get through anything.  Sweetheart, please, stop.  I’m here.  I’ll always be here.  I just need you to come back to me.”
Ron seemed to calm down a bit, nodding and smiling at Harry.  “Thanks, Harry.”
After a bit, he gently said, “Hey.  Hey, it’s okay.  You’ve already started making amends.  You’ve apologized to everyone.  You’re making friends with
The two men were still walking down the corridor towards the stairs.  Harry didn’t know what came over him, but he suddenly turned his head and said, “Want to come with?”
“I would think not,” Draco said, removing his shoes and curling up on the bed with Harry, who grabbed the remote and turned on the television.
“Harry?  What’s wrong?  What happened?”
Harry sat down on the couch beside him, kissing him on the cheek.  “I really do appreciate the effort.”
Draco was to arrive any minute, so he had gathered everyone together into the formal dining room.
“Oh, my. What did that monster do?” Hermione gasped.
Teddy peeked through his fringe at his grandmother.  “But I’ve asked Father Christmas for a broom.”
“Don’t blame me!  I tried to tell you it was too much.”
It was Harry’s turn to give Draco a look.
He waited a beat, and then did it again. This time, the door was opened, and as he walked inside the room, he saw that Draco was sitting at the foot of Harry’s bed, with Ron at the foot of his own, facing each other.
She blinked at him a couple of times before her face cleared and her grin lit up her face once again.  “It will be in the evening edition of The Prophet.”
“I’ve thought a lot about what you told me the other day.  I—I told Ron and Hermione.  I’m sorry, but I needed to talk to someone about this, and you know there are no secrets between the three of us.  I’m sure you would rather I—“
Harry broke out his million galleon smile, leaning in for a kiss.  Draco turned back to look at the closet as Harry stepped up behind him, wrapping his arms around his waist.
“Yeah,” Draco whispered.
Harry stopped mid brush and sighed, closing his eyes.
He didn't understand why it was taking so long. Draco didn't wear makeup, so that wasn't the problem. He had sat out his finest suit the night before, so that couldn't be it, either. As he walked into the room, he noticed something that made him want to punch something.
“Where on earth did you hear that?”
Harry smiled into the tuffs of blonde hair as he said, “I love you, too.”
After what felt like hours, but was probably only around three minutes, Harry finally started talking.
With a great sigh, he said, “Gryffindors are exhausting.”
“That would be amazing, Harry!  It could be, I don’t know, Happy 18
Draco couldn’t believe what he was seeing, let alone what he had just heard.  “What is all this?”
Harry lay his hand on top of Draco’s sliding it farther up, stopping just at where his leg and hip met.  “I love you, too.  So damned much.”
“But, Uncle Harry!  I want to be able to get bigger so I can ride my broom that Santa is bringing me!”
Draco moaned as Harry pushed his hips into Draco’s, grinding slowly against him.  Harry could feel himself stiffening already.  Before he could do much more, though, Draco released Harry’s lips, looking dazed.  Harry leant back in, but Draco pushed against his shoulder, stopping him.
“That explains this,” he said, glancing down at his partially naked chest, except for the white gauze that encircled his ribs, “but why is my arm bandaged?” He tried to weakly pick it up, but Harry was right there to make sure he didn't strain himself.
“When you’re being a tease, yes!”
“Why don’t I believe you,” Draco cried out.
Had someone told him a year ago that he would be dating Harry Potter, and spending a pleasant evening with the Golden Trio, he would have laughed in their face and jinxed them. Now, though? He wouldn’t trade this for anything in the world.
“Draco, baby, no!”
Harry sighed as he replaced the bowl and trudged up to his room.
“Sounds good,” Harry said, sliding his hand into Draco’s.
Harry walked up behind Draco, wrapping his arms around Draco’s stomach and leaning up on his toes in order to put his chin on Draco’s shoulder.
“Mate, that is beyond brilliant!  And may I say, I’m really proud of you for thinking about this for so long!”  He nudged Ron’s shoulder.
Draco, seeming to be deep in thought, came to when Harry nudged him.  “Hmm?  Oh, nothing.  What do you have now?”
After a while, they said their goodbyes and stopped at a little café, as Teddy was starting to complain he was hungry.  As they ate, sitting by the window and watching witches and wizards rush up and down the alley, Harry and Draco started talking more about the wedding.
“K!”  He flew off the bed, going down the stairs.
Harry didn't know what came over him, but he suddenly heard himself calling her back.   “Professor, I’m sure you’ll have to be here for the dinner with the students that stay, but if not, would you like to join us for Christmas dinner?  It'll be the Weasley’s, Andromeda and Teddy, Hermione and her parents.  I'd love to show you how your transfiguration lessons have been put to use,” Harry smiled.
Draco turned to look at the handsome owl.  He heard the owl hoot softly as he stuck out his leg for Harry to attach the letter.  Harry fastened on, and then scratched the bird’s head.  Once the bird had gotten enough affection, he lightly nipped Harry’s finger, and flew away.
“Okay, Ted.  We’re getting up.  Go down to the sitting room, but do not touch anything until we get there, alright?”
Harry was pleased to see Draco’s eyes widen and a smile grow wide on his face.  Marcella’s was a muggle Italian restaurant that they had had their first proper date at.  It quickly became their place to go to celebrate big events.  They went there when Draco was promoted to Bill Weasley’s second-in-command curse breaker.  They went there when Harry was promoted to Head of his Auror department.  They went there when Lucius finally accepted that Harry and Draco were together, and no matter what he did, he couldn’t change that fact.  It was ‘their place.’
Hermione glanced up and caught Harry’s eye.
He had apologized to everyone, except for Harry.  Sure, they had talked a bit when Harry had given him his wand back, but he had never received an official apology like everyone else.  He didn’t know how he felt about that.
They both stood there staring at one another until, after several long moments of silence, Harry couldn’t take it anymore.  He cleared his throat, hesitantly asking, “What are you doing here?”
“Fuck, you taste amazing,” he said licking his lips.
Receiving nods of agreement from the students in front of her, she beckoned for them to follow her.  “Alright, let me show you the 8
“Ready?” Ron was standing by the door, waiting on the other men in the room.
Draco rolled his eyes and walked to stand beside Harry at the counter.  “Is there anything I can do to help, then?”
He released his breath and turned to Draco, who gave him a wink.
Harry reached up, grasping the elastic of the boxers, carefully pulling them down.  Just seeing Draco moving underneath him like that was making his own cock throb even more, if it were even possible.
Harry smirked and said, “Well, you never know.  That might just happen anyway.”
“But Nana!”
“Merlin, how have we not been doing this for years?”
“We have about 15 minutes until everyone will be back to drop off their bags before supper.  Must make the most of it.”  With that, he pulled Draco on top of him, kissing his breath away.
Harry was in awe of this revelation; he wanted to tell everyone he knew what had happened!  He chided himself;
“Mr Malfoy then spoke of a link between you two?  What did he mean by that?”
As they all took their seats, chatter started around the table.
“I hate you, Potter.”
Without even thinking, Harry jumped quietly out of his bed and rushed over to Ron’s, pulling the curtains wide.  The sight that accosted him made him grimace.  Ron was twisted up in his bedding, and thrashing about.  He was having a horrific nightmare.
“That’s the point of a surprise, mate,” Ron smiled at him.
“What?”
“I knew what was coming for me and my family if and when the war happened.  Everything was…”
He stepped out into the hall, turning to go up to his room.  He made it to the next landing before he was pulled into a hug by Draco.
“I love you more,
"It's a suit! It looks fine! Let's go!”
Harry smiled as he looked over Draco’s shoulder, eyes growing wide.  “Draco, look,” he whispered.
Harry recounted the story of giving Draco his wand back, and the extreme heat that emitted from the wand, into their hands and arms.  As he gave every detail that he could, Ollivander’s face went from concern to intrigue, to understanding.
Draco turned to face Teddy, who was sat across the table from him.  “Yes, Teddy?”
“Blimey, that’s a mess.”
Molly just hummed as she turned back and pulled open the oven.
“Yeah,” Harry grinned.  “I am.”
“Yes.  Yes.  You know what I realized yesterday?  We haven't even been out on a proper date.”
Just as he was about to turn the corner, he heard a crash.  Whipping around, he saw Malfoy sprawled across the floor, and saw in horror as the hangings covering Walburga Black’s portrait zoomed open and she started screaming.
“I'm just glad he’s okay.”  He smiled at Narcissa, and then looked over at Draco.  “I'm going to go and let everyone know you're awake, so maybe they will go to sleep,” he said with a grin.  “I know Pansy has been frantic, so expect her to be coming in as soon as I let her know you're up.”  With a small nod, Harry stood up and began walking away, but only got as far as the foot of the bed before Draco spoke.
“Oi! I only have so much! What makes you think I'll just give you an entire bottle?!” Seamus had begun walking their way whilst talking.
“You are beginning to understand that this has affected everyone, right?”
“Okay, I think that should be fine.”  Draco cast a gemino charm onto the parchment, making several copies.  “Who all are we inviting?  My parents, The Weasley’s—all of them?”  He looked up at Harry.
Draco was perched on the edge of the tub, testing the water.  He had already stripped out of his clothes, as well.  He looked up at Harry when he heard the door open, and conjured a small table to sit the food and wine on, placing it beside the tub.
“I’m sure you do.  You made a list, and have checked it over about half a dozen times.”
“Potter,” Malfoy nodded at him as he walked past.
Harry gave a loud sigh, throwing himself on his bed with a bounce, preparing himself mentally for the barrage of questions that were soon to follow.
“You okay?”  Harry cupped his palm around Draco’s cheek.  Draco leaned into the touch.
“UNCLE HARRY!”
“Come on.”
Pansy was never the touchy-feely type, so he was startled as he was suddenly pulled into a hug.  He stiffened for a moment before melting into her embrace for a brief moment,  quickly pulling back and straightening his robes.  She gave him a look that he couldn’t quite decipher, but quickly pushed it aside as he turned and started walking back toward his office.
“Liar.  Honey, what’s wrong?”  Harry cupped his face.
Something jabbed Harry in the side.  Harry realized Hermione was trying to get his attention.  She tried to take the letter out of his hand.  Harry looked over at Draco, questioningly, who just nodded, still wide-eyed.  Harry handed the letter over, and waited for the gasp that he was sure to come.  He wasn’t denied the satisfaction of knowing her so well.  Draco handed over Harry’s letter without a word, too, and she read over that one quickly, as well.
Harry watched her face as tears streamed down Andromeda’s face.  She looked up at him, smiling, as she mouthed a “thank you,” at him.  He nodded, eyes filling with tears again.
Harry stopped and turned to look at the woman.  “Er, yeah.  Right here.”  He waved his hand at the curtain that was covering the portrait.
Draco looked from his best friend to Harry and smirked.  “Oh, yeah?”
“Yes.  I believe mother discussed breakfast with her, so she should have it started.”
“Agreed.  Why did we think getting a dessert was such a great idea?”
“No! It’s okay,” Harry said, grabbing Draco’s left wrist.  He looked at it, and then looked up at Draco.  “It’s okay. Er, still willing to help?  Great.”  Releasing his arm, Harry explained to Draco what they needed to do to get the carpet up, and soon they had a roll of old, dusty carpet.  With a swish of his wrist, Harry vanished it, leaving the room empty.
After taking a sip, Kingsley looked back up at him.  “I wanted to talk with you some more about what you told Robards and I yesterday.  We both thi—”
“Lookin’ sharp, mate,” he said in between bites.
Everyone else sat and looked at each other, stunned beyond comprehension.  Before Harry could stand and go to talk to Malfoy, Ron stood and walked into their dorm.  That stunned everyone even more, but quiet conversations were forming throughout the room, trying to figure out what had just occurred.
Thank you so much for reading!  Hope 2020 has started off great for you!
“What did you say?”
“What’s with all the questions, this morning?”
“I will.  I promise.”
Inside were three beautiful Snitches. Each were snuggly sat in velvet, and had gold writing curved around the hole giving details about what each one did.
“Right here,” Andromeda said, walking into the room with her hands full of coats, hats, and gloves.  “Thank you for taking him.  I’ve got some shopping to do, and little eyes can’t see what I’m getting,” she said glancing down at Teddy, who had a wide grin on his face.
Harry made sure no one was walking past the alley, and then apparated to the ministry.
Draco groaned, but moved to sit on the side of the bed.  He sat there for a moment, giving Harry the opportunity to slide up behind him and place several kisses along the back of his neck.  Draco tilted his head, giving Harry better access.
“Well, it’s about time that
When he finally released him, Harry said, “Well, hello to you, too.”  He chuckled as he sat down on the edge of the bed, saying, “I’m sorry I didn’t come back earlier.  I got a bit of sleep, but was woken by McGonagall to go and speak to Auror Pye, to give my statement.  Is that who you spoke to?”  Receiving a nod, Harry continued.  “I then decided to go back to Grimmauld and clean up a bit of the mess, and worked a couple more hours in the kitchen.  I came back, deciding to take a nap, but got sidetracked.  I’ve spent the past few hours up in Gryffindor tower, talking with an old friend, figuring out Christmas gifts for everyone.  I, er, really hope you’ll like yours.”  Harry looked down at the floor, and Draco could see the faint blush touching the tops of his cheeks.
“Today.  The green one is the official memo,” she said, nodding down at the stack of papers in his hand.
Standing on the landing, he perked his ear, listening for any noises in the house.  He heard a light shuffle upstairs, so he cast a Muffliato on his feet, and slowly made his way up the staircase.
in his head.
Harry smiled as her comment penetrated his mind.  He sat up, seeing that he was the last to wake up.  “Where’s Ron?”
Sighing, he gestured for Ron to follow him to the common room.  They walked back out into the main room, and saw that it was empty.
Draco smiled as he followed Harry from the room.
He showed them into the dining room, and told them his plans for in there, and then walked back out and down the stairs to the kitchen.  As soon as they walked in, they all noticed a full tea set out on the table, with biscuits and little sandwiches.  Harry smiled and then realized exactly how hungry he was.  He could see Kreacher lurking in the corner, so he said, “Thank you, Kreacher.”  The elf bowed slightly, but when he saw who was coming through the door behind Harry, he squeaked and bowed all the way to ground, his nose touching the floor.  “Mistress Narcissa.  Master Draco.”
Harry looked around the room at the people he loved the most.  He caught Draco’s eye from across the room and smiled.  Draco raised his eyebrows, and Harry shrugged one shoulder.
“What do you mean you don’t want to go?  This is your family!  You have to be there!”
“Harry, why would you not tell me this?!  Why would you do this alone?  What is going on?”
Draco looked crushed as Harry spoke to him.  Harry couldn’t understand the emotions that were flicking across Draco’s face as the blond walked solemnly over to the side table, where their breakfast was still sitting, completely forgotten.  “Here’s my wand for your meeting with Ollivander.  I will come by later to pick it up.”
“Well, just make sure he still has all his appendages and teeth when you bring him back.  Actually, maybe not all his teeth: I think he has a couple of loose ones.”
This chapter is about Harry's birthday, and then the next is more shopping and a quick conversation with our dear Draco!  Chapter four will finally be at Hogwarts, and then we'll go from there!  Hope you like this!
Draco woke the next morning with Harry’s arm wrapped around his middle.  Merlin, that felt amazing.
Draco smiled, lifting his hand to stare at the ring on his finger.  “Fiancé,” he whispered.  He turned back to Harry with a huge grin on his face. He leant in for another kiss, before sliding down the bed and laying his head on Harry’s chest.
“What do want to know?”
“I can think of a few ways,” Harry smiled, pushing Draco’s face back towards his and taking his swollen bottom lip between his teeth.  Draco moaned, and smashed his lips against Harry’s.
After spending several more hours shopping, eating lunch, and admiring more of the beautiful sights, they made their way back to their room.
“Yeah, not bad.  Haven’t had a nightmare in a few days, so I’ll take it.”  Harry quickly grabbed his things and went to shower.
Harry gave Draco a look, as if asking ‘Well?  Should we just tell them?’
Harry kissed the inside of Draco’s calf, and thrust home.  Draco gasped as he once again gripped the headboard, fingers turning white.  Harry hiked up Draco’s legs, and pulled out before quickly thrusting back in.  He continued at a quick tempo for several thrusts before suddenly, Draco screamed and dug his heels into Harry’s back.
Harry hummed as he leant further into the kiss, before pulling back and pushing their foreheads together. “You’re welcome.”
“Me, too.”
They ordered food, and once it arrived, they watched a movie and ate their food.  Setting their plates aside, Draco curled himself into Harry’s arms, relishing in the feeling of love and contentment.
Deciding not to invest any more attention into that thought, he quickly cleaned himself up, and washed his hair.
“Good morning.  We are gathered here to celebrate the marriage of Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter, two young men that I have had the privilege of knowing since they were eleven years old.  I have been witness to their many years of fighting, but I was also witness to the start of their relationship, whether they knew it or not.”
Draco whined as Harry released him and moved back to settle between his legs.  “Okay, I’m going to slowly open you up, now.  Damn, I can't wait to be inside of you.  I've wanted this for so long.”
Kingsley once again quietly said, “Fascinating.”
Draco laughed, pulling Harry towards him.  “Want to remind me why you’re my favorite, too?”
“I think we’re going to head out, as well,” he said to Molly as he stepped off the last stair.
“Do you remember how I said I had been taking a glass blowing class?  Well, this was my first project that actually looked good.”
Draco glanced at Harry before turning and looking at Blaise.  “I’m sure neither of us have any idea what you’re talking about.”  He smirked and leant back against Harry’s chest.
“We?”
Harry smiled, kissing Draco again.  “Well, I’m home now.  You really have no idea how much I missed you.  We will un-deprive ourselves later.  Right now, we dine.  I’m famished; let’s go.”
“I gave him his wand this morning, remember? And then I apparated us here.  No big deal.”
It absolutely amazed him how comfortable Draco was around him, and he with Draco, too.  Like Draco had just said, there was over seven years of the fighting mentality ingrained in their heads.  After all these years, the names Potter and Malfoy side-by-side created a sense of foreboding in the minds of the wizarding community.  Everyone knew about their rivalry.  How would the public take the news that they were now a couple?  Hell, what would they think about the fact that Harry was gay?
Harry once again looked up at Draco’s face, relishing in the fact that he was home, and that Draco was with him.  Draco noticed Harry’s eyes on him, saying, “Potter, quit staring at me!”
“Bloody hell, mate.  What're you going to do?”
“I was thinking the same thing!”  Harry took Draco’s hand, and they took another turn.  As they neared the exit, they slowed down and stopped to lean up against the ledge.  Draco crowded Harry against the wall, and gave him a long, slow kiss.
Draco carefully moved forward into the room.  He walked over to Narcissa, giving her a peck on the cheek.
“Hello, there,” Harry said to the bird, touching its foot. Its deep brown eyes were staring deep into Harry’s.  He noticed the specks of black on the white chest of the bird, and its gorgeous brown and gold feathers on its wings.
“Well, hello to you, too,” he said, before quickly searching for a place to set the gifts down so he could pick up his goddaughter.  Hermione came to his rescue, taking the boxes from him.  He bent to pick up Rose, setting her on his hip and giving her a loud kiss on the cheek.  “And how’s my favorite girl on her birthday?”
“Well, that’s easy.”
“Yes, I want to be able to go into the muggle areas, too.”
“What?”
Anywho, I PROMISE, I have not, and will not, abandon this fic! It will be completed (at some point)!
Thanking Kreacher, who popped back out of the room, Harry began to pull the blanket back to get out when his bedroom door was opened.  Looking up, he saw Draco standing in the doorway.
“The sooner we get these invitations written, the sooner we can go to
Harry’s breath caught in his throat as Draco slid off the bench of the sleigh and knelt down between Harry’s legs.  He nodded quickly, as Draco tossed the blanket over his hand and Harry’s lap.  Harry slid down, spreading his legs, and gasped as he felt Draco take him into his mouth.
“Ugh! Okay, too much emotion for one day, and it’s not even 7:00am. Be gone with you!”
“I’m going to set up the table,” he said, as he realized Ron was following closely behind him.
This wasn’t the first time he had a dream starring Draco, but this one definitely went farther than any of the others had.  Since spending time with the man, Harry had realized just how attractive Draco was.  They had become good friends as of late, and Draco was helping him renovate his house; they made a really great team.  It was strange to think that just a few months ago, Harry had absolutely despised the man, and now was having wet dreams of him.  He didn’t know quite what to make of it.  There was a lot of history between the two of them, and not very much of it was good.
“Wake up!”  He wiggled so he was laying between them, kicking his legs.  “Uncle Draco, it’s snowing again!  Can we go make a snowman?”
“You keep saying that, but you don’t have to deal with a crazed mother who thinks she knows what’s best.”
“Wait, McGonagall and your mother are downstairs, right now?”
was going to take some getting used to, but Harry was so happy that they were happy.  He glanced over at Ginny, who looked adoringly at her brother and friend.  He knew they were going to have to have a conversation soon, and started feeling a little sick at the prospect.
But, not until…
Instead of flying over to Draco, though, Orion fluttered his wings as he landed on Harry’s desk, lifting his foot.  Harry took the letter, pulling some owl treats out of his desk.
They hugged briefly before Ron left and Harry sat back behind his desk.  He sighed loudly before pulling the pile of paperwork towards him.
Before they could even get out the doors of the Great Hall, Harry was stopped by Teddy hugging his legs.
Narcissa began walking through the furniture, saying things like, “Oh, that is beautiful,” or “I remember that from my great-grandfather’s house!”  She was about half way across the room when she turned and said, “May I mark the items that I want and get them a few at a time?  I will need to find places for them, you see.”
He hadn’t really paid attention to what Hermione was wearing when she had woken him up, but now he saw that she was in a beautiful emerald dress.  Ron sat at the table, eating some eggs and toast, all in black, except for the emerald tie that matched Harry’s.
Did he always have to be such an arse?  Harry considered just turning around and walking away, but then he remembered the conversation from the morning of his birthday; he didn’t want to fight anymore.
He leaned in and gave Draco a kiss as he thrust deep.  Draco screamed as he started coming, streaks of white painting Harry’s chest and hand.  Harry thrust once more, feeling Draco’s channel clench around him, and he came, too, slamming into Draco as he filled him.
Draco sighed, taking Harry’s hand.  “I know, but it’s only one night.  Not one hundred ninety.”
Harry looked down at him.  “I couldn’t have, though.  I wasn’t ready for anyone else to know.  The only person that had any idea was the healer.”
“Ah! That must be Draco!”  Harry bounded down the steps to go answer the door.
Draco stared at the ground at the mention of the trials.  If he was being honest, he had been absolutely flabbergasted that Harry had spoken for him and his mother.  He believed that the man in front of him was the only reason he wasn’t currently being held in a cell in Azkaban.
Draco was trying not to laugh, but once he caught Harry’s eyes, he couldn’t help the grin that graced his face.  Harry mouthed to his neighbor, “You?!”  Receiving a slight nod, Harry couldn’t help the giggle-snort that emitted from him.
Wide eyes and big smiles were what looked back up at him.
Harry gulped as he bowed slightly.  “Mrs Malfoy.”
Looking around, Harry wondered what kind of things they would be doing in Potions this year.  He didn’t know why he was still going to be taking the class, as he had decided not to go into Auror training; after writing to Professor McGonagall, it was decided that he should stay the course.  Keeping his schedule meant that he could pursue quite an array of career options.
“So?  It’s still early.  We could go get something to eat, maybe walk around?  Or, what about going to the Market?  I want to see what you’ve been working on the past few months.”
The trio walked down the steps and into the carriage that was waiting for them.  When they reached the entrance, they got out and walked through the iron gate.
“He was acquitted, Ronald.”
“Thanks.”  He smiled at him.  “So, that’s the bedroom.”  He walked out onto the landing, and showed them the paint he had done on the walls and doors.  “Since I took the second room up here and made it into the en-suite, I had to take out the door and put up a wall, instead.  Can you figure out where it used to be?”  He smiled as his friends went and tried to remember where the door used to be.  If Harry was honest, he was quite enjoying seeing his friends impressed with what he had done.
“I came in to sit with you, but after awhile, Professor McGonagall asked if I would like some tea.  Harry said he would stay until you woke, so I’ve been talking with her, waiting for word.  She will allow me to use her floo to go back to the Manor, when I leave.
“There she is!  How’s my favourite girl?”
“I found that there weren’t just pictures of me, though.  Colin was truly an artist.  He apparently snuck around a lot, taking pictures of random people doing random things.”  Harry’s smile widened as he thought about some of the photos he had seen.
Suddenly, a bright flash slashed through the air.  They swiveled their heads over to see a man lower a camera, wide toothy grin on his face.  He tipped his hat at them, and disapparated away.
Draco flinched as Pansy launched herself at him, gripping him tightly in a hug.  He whimpered in pain, causing her to jump back, but then she quickly launched into a lecture of how he needed to pay more attention to his environment and who he was near, and soon his conversation with his mother was completely forgotten.
With that in mind, he slid off the bed, pulling Draco closer to him.  Making himself comfortable in between Draco’s legs, he opened the button and slowly unzipped the two halves of Draco’s trousers, pulling the flaps apart.  He pulled Draco’s trousers off of his hips; Draco lifted up, giving him an easier time of it.  Once they were pooled around his knees, Harry’s smoothly removed them completely.  Now, Draco was just in a pair of black, silk boxers.
Draco had gone even more red as he too tried to clear his throat.
“Are you kidding?”  Harry wrapped his left arm around Draco, pulling him close.  “I definitely like the new look.”
Draco’s eyes widened, and a huge grin lit up his face as he leaned forward and kissed him.  “I cannot wait.”
The Gryffindors stood staring at the burly man for a few moments, before Harry snapped to and stepped forward, extending his hand.
“Well, when you get it completed, you should have a house-warming party!”
“Happy New Years, mate!” Ron came over and gave him a clap on the back.  “George will be here in a couple of minutes with the drinks and music.”
“Are you okay, mate?” Blaise asked, looking at Draco.
to get better.”
“Why couldn’t you just tell me this?  I would have understood.  I would have tried to help in anyway I could.  Harry, I thought you were cheating on me.  I was considering divorce!  Why would you—”
“Hey, mate! Where’s Har— Wait. Really?”
“Well, the offer stands.  But, please finish your lunches.  And tell me, what kind of renovations have you been doing to that old, dank, dark house?”
“Fuck.”  He sighed, thinking over all that Draco had told him.  He was interrupted from his thoughts, though, when Teddy started crying.
“Missed you more, my gorgeous fiancé.”
“Ha—Harry!”
2.  I'm sorry it's so short!  Like I said, I haven't been able to write, so trying to get everything I wanted in this chapter didn't happen because I wanted to give you guys something, and not too late!  So, here it is.  Hopefully the next one will make up for it!
“I couldn’t even speak I was so angry.  How dare he think he can still choose my future when he is locked in a cell in Azkaban for the rest of his?  Despite that fact, I’m only eighteen!  And gay!  I don't… I just… I lost it, which is the only explanation I have as to why I jumped you upon coming back upstairs.”
Draco cried out, thrusting up onto Harry’s cock as he wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck to keep him kissing him.  Harry wrapped his own hands onto the headboard, gripping tight as his thrusting stuttered a bit.  He was
Crawling into bed, he put his wand on the table beside the bed, and waving his hand, turned off all the lights.  He curled up under the duvet, and with more thoughts of Draco floating through his head, he fell asleep.
“Love, this is
He turned to the fireplace and locked the floo.
Harry swallowed as he realised she was probably right, as they headed towards to lifts.
“I'll apparate you, if you want. That still might cause a bit of a stomach issue, but not nearly as bad as the Bus.  My floo is still connected to the Manor, because I am lazy, so we can apparate to mine, and then you can floo there.”
“Do you have the rings?”
“Hello.”
Draco jumped and a squeak emitted from his mouth before he slumped in Harry’s arms.
“H—hi.”  He cleared his throat, eyes wide, staring at the man in front of him.  “What are you doing here?”
“Wicked!”
Once Teddy was put to bed, it wasn’t long before Narcissa and Andromeda both made their leave, and Harry and Draco moved to their suite, lighting the fire.
“Harry! It’s been a while,” Kingsley boomed, walking over to them.  “Mrs Malfoy, Mr Malfoy, Professor,” he nodded to each of them.
“How depressing is it that we aren’t going to be able to play, this year,” Ron whinged loudly.
My only excuse it that our boys are being difficult.
“Now we just need to go get the ornaments out of the attic.”
“Bloody hell, mate! Don’t sneak up on a bloke like that!” Ron said, clutching his chest. “Wait—did we wake you up?”
“Come in!”
Harry rubbed his thumb over the head of his penis a few times, and then grabbed his balls with his left hand.  Feeling adventurous, he moved his left hand back farther, and touched his sensitive pucker.  He didn’t think he was ready for penetration, but he lightly rubbed his finger around the hole, envisioning the long finger of a certain person, all the while tugging erratically on his prick.  He could feel the pleasure rising up, and then suddenly, he came, shuddering as his spunk spurt all over the opposite wall and floor of the tub.  Coming down from his high, he suddenly realized that he had just wanked to the mental image of Draco Malfoy.
“Wait! Before we go over there, I want to know something.  Is it true that you attended every Sunday dinner at the Burrow while I was gone?”
“Ah, it’s good to be home”, Draco said, toeing off his shoes and placing them next to the hall closet, before coming back in and curling up on the couch.  “Now all we have to worry about is New Year’s next week, and we will have survived another holiday season.”
“Teddy!  There’s my guy!”  Harry wrapped his arms around his godson, who clung to Harry’s neck.
Harry and Draco, hands gripped tightly together, wandered around the Great Hall, talking with their family and friends.
“Merlin, I love that kid.”
Draco chuckled as he swept a few locks of Harry’s hair off his face.  “I would give you more details, but you’ll find out soon enough.  I should go.”
years were standing and grabbing their bags.  He quickly strode to the front, grabbing a few bacon sandwiches, and then walked beside Ron as they headed toward Charms.
Luna was chatting with Ginny, and both women were laughing and glancing at him.  Harry didn’t think he wanted to know what their conversation was about.
“No, it’s okay.  Please.  Not right now.  Let’s go celebrate my godchildren, instead.”
“Thank you again for the photos. I’m sure mother will be pleased to see them hanging in my rooms.”
“What was that?” Ron asked.
“Oh?  How?”
“It is of my concern, actually, because it occurred in my home.  I don’t want you to sue me or something.”
They looked at each other, smiling, and Harry couldn’t help but lean over and give him a quick kiss.  He saw the blush appear before he had leaned back.
Draco smiled at him, before taking a sip.  His grin grew as he tasted it.  “That’s delicious! Thanks.”  He then leant back against Harry’s side.
Leaning back against the couch, again, Harry was waiting for the sputtering answer from Neville, when he suddenly felt a brush against his hair.  For a second, he thought maybe it had caught on a fiber, but then he felt it again.
“Not my fault you like being the bottom so much.”
Draco hummed as Harry nipped his bottom lip. He thought he had completely ruined this. How could he have been so stupid? This was what he wanted—had wanted for years, if he was being honest with himself.
Draco smiled tiredly, rubbing the spot where the welt was.  “The public didn’t react this bad when we started dating
“Do you like it?  I wasn’t sure if…”  Draco couldn’t take his eyes off of the white gold band.  There was a diamond in-laid into the gold, with an Alexandrite gemstone on one side, and a Ruby on the other.
After a few moments, he looked back up at his friends and said, “Thanks for listening to me.  I don’t know what I would do without you two.”
