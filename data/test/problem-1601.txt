“It’s weird, when I see him, I’m just reminded of how he was when he was during Hogwarts, the slimy git, but then he opens his mouth and it’s different,” Ron said. “Like he’s still rude, but not in certain-people-should-die way. ‘S weird.”
But Harry was obviously fine with being seen with Draco, and that helped Draco be less anxious about it.
“Yes you do. I can see it,” Harry said proudly. “You get this look in your eye for a second as you decide what borderline rude thing you’re going to say.”
Draco spent the rest of the day wondering what he could have done to upset Potter so much, which might have been fine if actual lives weren’t depending on him. Even as he looked at other patients and consulted with Leo and Betty, some part of him was going mad trying to think what he might’ve done to wrong Potter.
“Yeah, well, this was easiest.” Potter sounded annoyed. Draco hadn’t heard Potter sound this irritated in years.
Draco nodded as he draped his coat over the back of the unoccupied chair. He glanced hesitantly over at Potter, who looked…fine. Still much too skinny and with heavy bags under his eyes, but he didn’t look so close to death. Draco breathed a silent sigh of relief and told them that he was going to go get some food.
“I didn’t know you cared about your appearance,” said Draco, but his grey eyes ran up and down Harry appreciatively. Harry shifted uncomfortably, tugging at the sleeve of his dark emerald sweater. “You look more than alright, Harry. I could fuck you senseless right now.”
He was there ten minutes before Harry showed up. Harry might have shown up earlier, truthfully, as Draco didn’t even notice his presence until he sat down next to him. Draco looked over in surprise, but didn’t say anything. It wasn’t often that he saw Harry so upset.
“Well,” Harry said, and cleared his throat. “I’m still sorry for what I did…in sixth year. I swear to God I didn’t know what that curse did.”
Draco stared down at Potter’s hand, and felt Leonel’s eyes on it too. After a few more moments, there was a twitch of movement in Potter’s index finger. Leonel glanced at Draco with wide eyes.
"Oh. Yes, I apologize. I didn't even realize," Draco said slowly, feeling his face heat up slightly.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Harry Potter look up at Pansy’s words. Draco rolled his eyes, shooting a momentary glare at Potter before turning a bit so his back would be to Potter.
For a moment, Draco thought Harry was going to fight him right there at breakfast, but then he looked away and Draco breathed a sigh of relief.
He’d write back about his studies, Pansy, and the weather. He didn’t feel the need to write about how useless it all seemed. About how even if he did graduate from Hogwarts, he’d only be seen for what he was. Is. A dirty Death Eater who only sided with the right side when it was convenient.
“I’ll be returning to Wales at the end of the month,” Blaise put in. His hooded eyes studied his girlfriend. “I’m assuming you won’t be back in New Zealand by then.”
He tossed Draco’s at his face and pulled his own on. In any other situation, Draco would have retaliated, but Ron bloody Weasley was about to walk in on him naked, so Draco pulled his pants on as well.
"Ron, Hermione, I have to tell you something," Harry began, and he already felt his heartbeat thudding in his temples. He exhaled, though it didn’t help much. "It's about Dr. Wolff, sort of."
Normally, his frustration would have risen considerably, but he was drained after the events of the past few days.
Harry finally stopped pacing and rubbed at his eyes with a single hand. Draco realized that he wasn’t wearing his glasses. Did he want them?
Draco’s resistance to him was unnerving to Harry. Sure, he’d said he was interested in Harry, but words only meant so much. What Harry wanted was
A few weeks ago, he stumbled across the email she had sent him that day. He visited all the websites she had supplied him with, figuring he had nothing better to do with his time.
“I’m certain you’re not referring to a perfectly innocent dream by the way your face has changed shades in just a minute’s time,” Ira said, slipping into the chair across from Draco’s with their tea, making Draco’s face even hotter. They bobbed their tea bag up and down, their pale eyes trained on it. “So my answer is no. You know I don’t see many patients anyway.”
If Potter could cross his arms any tighter, Draco would have been concerned for his blood circulation.
“Not a lot…well, sometimes. She’s always been independent,” Potter reasoned more with himself than with Draco. “I never said I didn’t want to listen. I just didn’t want to talk.”
he was. Their kiss deepened, and once again it was open-mouthed but somewhat calmer – less desperate and more appreciative. They moved in unison, neither too fast nor too slow.
“Wow,” Harry said for lack of a better word. He closed his eyes, trying to focus on the conversation and not his intense heartbeat. He opened them again and regarded Estrada. “How old are you?”
Once he’d completed his make-up year at Hogwarts, Draco had lived alone for the first time in his life. He got a small flat in the outskirts of Wizarding London and went to medical school to learn how to become a Healer. He’d since upgraded flats, but he still woke alone every morning and went to bed alone every night. There was that lovely moment of time when he’d sometimes be accompanied by Leonel, but ever since their break-up, Draco had to get used to sleeping by himself all over again.
“And I desperately want to move on,” Malfoy continued, his gaze dropping to his cup of coffee. “Holding onto the past and ruminating over it does me no favors, so I
Harry’s expression darkened instantly. “Nothing will. I’m doing good, and I have been for a while now. You wouldn’t know, of course, but it’s true. Now stop being melodramatic and just fucking say yes, Draco. I know you want to.”
He savored the disconnect he felt between the world and him after purging. Like he was truly untouchable. Above it all. It was his second favorite thing about the activity, after the emptying itself.
Harry nearly let out a startled laugh but kept his mouth shut, not wanting to scare Draco off. He was dazed, his already hazy mind spinning with this unexpected turn of events. What did this mean? Why wasn’t Draco pushing him away? Had they ever touched like this before? Was the last time they’d touched in the Room of Requirement, surrounded by cursed flames and Draco’s panicked breathing on his neck and his hands gripping Harry so tightly it hurt?
"I know," he bit his lip, remembering Mrs. Weasley's disappointment when he and Ginny broke up. He'd only just started getting bad then. "But it's not the same. Like, proper family."
Samuel’s dark eyes were glittering with something mixed between fascination and awe. They were standing in an isolated corner of the room during break, speaking where no one could hear them. Malfoy sat with Kathy, who was listening interestedly. Everyone else was trying to be polite and not stare
“All right, you lot, settle down,” Kathy said, her voice carrying over the conversations that were being held. Harry directed his attention to her. “Thanks for coming today; it’s good to see your faces.
Leonel looked at him knowingly and sighed. “You’ve thought about it, haven’t you? I’m guessing it’s a no.”
Draco stuck his head into the green flames, and he was met with Wolff's sensible heels. She stooped gracefully to his level somehow, and smiled at him.
Relaxed, he laid back down and thought. He remembered now how Harry had insisted he just sleep there, even though Draco’s room was just a minute walk away. He’d offered Draco his bed and wouldn’t take no for an answer.
Many people were nodding solemnly. Harry tentatively reached out and placed a hand on Samuel’s shoulder. He turned, and seeing Harry, smiled slightly.
"I've picked up on quite a bit, I think," Draco answered quietly, reading Harry's changed body language. "I've listened to you, Harry, and I understand - to an extent, at least. I'm not saying this to hurt you, or be a prat, but because…I don’t like seeing you like this."
“No, I.” Draco took a deep breath, trying to work up the nerves. His tongue was already looser than usual, but it was still difficult to voice his thoughts. But Potter had to know; Draco owed him that much. “I understand. It feels wrong to me too.”
"Don't make that face," said Draco. "The mistakes I made are mine and mine alone. I'm the one who made a mess of my life."
“That mysterious bloke, Draco,” she said, grinning as she nodded at Malfoy, who was across the room. “It’d be fun, wouldn’t it?”
“You, I can’t believe I’m,” Draco answered, unable to stop himself, “With you, finally with you, finally -
Draco closed his eyes. Of course he was. Fucking Harry Potter has to be in the middle of everything. He rubbed at his forehead, feeling a headache coming on.
Encouraged, Draco began moving up and down Harry’s cock, working his tongue in different ways. His hands found Harry’s thighs and he rubbed and squeezed them, wanting to feel more of him, wanting to get more out of him. He slid his tongue across the length of the cock, focused on the head, and went all around, trying to find what Harry
“Good luck, mate,” Ron said, clapping Harry on the back. He glanced over at Malfoy, then back at Harry. “And don’t kill him.”
“No, you don’t understand, Draco, that was – was unlike anything I’ve ever felt,” Harry said breathlessly, a wide smile on his face.
“Whatever,” said Draco, sliding his shoes off and going to lie back against his pillows and headboard. He folded his hands together in his lap. “Say what you’ve come here to say. Make your case.”
She stuck her head back in, and Draco heard her talk briefly with Potter. Ginevra reemerged and opened the door wide, allowing Draco access and her to leave.
Harry nodded and drank down the glass of water Malfoy had handed to him. Once he gave it back to Malfoy, he said, “Sorry, did you say Healer?”
Draco hugged back, his arms wrapping around Harry’s body comfortingly. Harry sighed happily, gripping Draco tighter and feeling like he could stay that way forever.
Potter chuckled shortly, the noise sounding all wrong to Draco’s ears. He was looking away again, his eyes unseeing.
“Stop,” said Harry, moving to sit next to Draco on his bed. He put a hand on Draco’s own. “You’re being dramatic. We’re both allowed to whinge; it’s not a competition of whose life is worse. And…we’re in a relationship. Two people, yeah?”
into a glass he’d found on his bedside table and gulped the water down, relishing how it felt against his dry, scratchy throat. The taste of vomit and whiskey still lingered, but it was marginally better.
“All right?” he said to Harry as he approached. He noticed Malfoy, and nodded apprehensively. “Draco, yeah?”
"No, no, Ira, I'm sorry," said Draco, scrubbing a hand over his face. "I’m just massively exhausted, not that it's any excuse. Thank you, Ira. Really. You don't need to listen to my rubbish, but you always do anyway."
Draco shifted against him and let out a sleepy moan, drawing Harry’s attention to him being half-hard. He bit down a smile as he studied Draco’s face, his back, and his marked arm. God, he was beautiful. It still astounded Harry that someone so gorgeous could be interested in
Hermione stood and rushed away, no doubt to write a long letter of congratulations. Ron watched her walk away, a fond smile on his face. He drifted away, his gaze still on the spot where Hermione had disappeared into their bedroom. He seemed to remember that Harry was there, and turned, his ears turning red.
“Yeah,” Potter said. He stepped closer, green eyes bright. “I realized how ridiculous it was to run away like I did. I think I was just confused – and overwhelmed. To know that someone, that you, feel like I do. Ron and Hermione and the others…they get it, of course, but it doesn’t feel the same. I don’t really understand it, Malfoy, but I feel…connected to you.”
Potter…fancied him? Harry Potter? Fallen hero-turned-addict? The one person he was enamored by during Hogwarts, and the last person he should be fancying now?
“I think you’re confusing me with yourself,” Draco said wryly. “You deserve the best, Leo, and I’m not it.”
“We gave him a Nourishing Potion since he’s been vomiting so much,” added Leonel seriously. “He’s dehydrated and isn’t maintaining nutrients.”
Potter lifted his hand to his forehead absentmindedly. His eyes were unfocused as he stared out over Draco’s shoulder.
And then she broke. “Fine. Just – keep asking him, alright? If you keep pushing he’ll tell you. He’s never been able to control his temper; he’s bound to break eventually.”
Finally, and with significant effort, Draco relaxed his shoulders and said in his best professional voice, “I think we’re set for now. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?”
Harry's hand slipped down to his own cock and he began rubbing it vigorously. Draco was still pounding into him and it only took a few moments before Harry came with a shout, his entire body tensing as he spilled all over himself.
Draco’s mind wandered to the inevitable: what was this? They were friends, yes, but that was their label before they began all
Johnny was waving a baggie in Harry's face. The white powder inside was tantalizing, and Harry smiled.
Harry seemed to be enjoying the snow less. He looked cold even underneath the thick Gryffindor scarf and beanie pulled over his messy curls. His arms were crossed over his chest as they navigated the snow-covered path together.
to Malfoy,” Harry said, carefully emphasizing the most important word, glancing over at Ginny to see if she was convinced.
Granted, it was almost only when Draco had skipped a meal or had gone to the loo to throw one up, but Potter was speaking to him. He continued to corner Draco, sometimes coming into the bathroom like he had the first night, which Draco
When Draco had finally written Blaise and asked about Ginevra and Potter, Blaise had simply written back, ‘why do you care, you berk.’
Harry gave an uncomfortable laugh. Merlin, he was a rubbish friend, having sex in the loo when he was supposed to be celebrating his friend’s birthday. Wasn’t it Harry who said that the night was about Samuel, not him or Draco?
Draco’s mind was still racing – what was he supposed to do? When in all his studies had he learned what to do if your patient fancied you? Pushing away all the personal thoughts that were flying around in his head, he focused on the professional.
“What are you doing?” Draco hissed, hoping his face wasn’t bright pink. He tried to shake Potter off, but Potter had a steel grip on his arm. Draco watched as the other students filed out of the classroom, glancing at them curiously before turning and whispering to their friends. Draco looked Potter in the eye, certain he was blushing now. “Let go of me.”
Harry gave up and followed Draco to the bathroom, where they showered quickly (though thoroughly). When they’d finished and dried off, they hurried back to Harry’s bedroom and
Draco’s words brought back flashes of memory. Draco’s – then Malfoy’s – pointy little face sneering at him, just begging to be punched. The adrenaline from the game leading him to sink his fist into Draco’s stomach. He smiled despite himself – fifth year was fucking rough, but there was still innocence and so much
Draco had no future. He knew this. Who’d want to hire a mental ex-Death Eater? Still, his mother had pleaded with him, and when he declined, she’d forced him. He didn’t know if she was in complete denial, or if she truly believed that Draco would have a life after
He was covered in a cold sweat and his heart was thudding loudly in his chest. Draco rubbed at his eyes a touch too aggressively, trying to make sense of his dream. They were hardly ever as vivid as that, and when they were, they veered more into nightmare territory.
Ginny and Luna were glowing, it seemed, and it made Harry happy to watch them be so happy, so in love. They must’ve been – even if they hadn’t said it around him, Harry could tell.
They eventually pulled away from each other but still sat close, Draco’s skin burning where it touched Harry’s. He was lightheaded as he took Harry in, feeling a flutter of pride knowing
“And we know what happened the last time we invited Patterson out for drinks,” Draco mused. “Just us four then?”
“He’s not my boy,” Malfoy said firmly, but Cait was already walking away, disappearing into the crowd.
“I don’t know.” Potter sounded frustrated now. His speech was a bit slurred, and Merlin help him, Draco found it endearing. His drunk brain needed to fuck off. “It’s just, the way everyone is acting, it’s as if nothing’s changed. But everything did. I don’t see how they’ve all just moved on with their lives but I’m still thinking about that body I stepped over on the third floor during the battle and how I have to walk past that spot every day on my way to class. Or how they’re all just getting pissed where horrible things happened just a few months ago but none of them seem to remember or care.
had a good week,” Cait said, kindly obliging to Draco’s request. “I haven’t had any coke since last Tuesday, which I think is a new record.”
“Potter, I’ve got quite enough going on in my life,” Draco announced, somehow managing to look down at Harry even though he was only a few inches taller than him, “So I’m certain you’ll understand my asking this: what is this to you?”
He glanced at Draco, who was still sitting there, unsure. Harry walked over, putting his palm over Draco’s cheek, smiling as Draco looked up.
"You must first understand that confidentiality is absolutely essential for this individual," Draco began, a slight frown on his face. He paused as the kettle poured tea into the teacup in front of him. He spooned a few cubes of sugar and stirred. "Thank you. As I was saying, he’s just very recently accepted help, so he’s still quite skittish. I believe his greatest concern is his privacy."
Harry and Malfoy exchanged glances. Cait was obviously thinking about the row they had in the middle of group.
Harry nodded, and Malfoy cast the Disillusionment charm once more. The walk back to Harry’s room was quick and soon they were inside. Malfoy undid the charm.
“So how long will you be staying in London, Ginevra?” asked Draco, refusing to fall down that rabbit hole during dinner.
be. The prat had no fashion sense whatsoever, but even he did, it wouldn’t make an ounce of difference since all his clothes (sans school robes) were much too big for him. His hair was just as unruly as ever, disobedient and out-of-place in a way that made Draco’s skin itch. His glasses were still ugly and circular, and Draco had a theory that they were the exact same ones Potter had been wearing when they’d first met – just
Draco fucked Harry harder now, merciless and beautiful and greedy. Harry felt dizzy with glee and the best kind of hurt there was – he clutched at Draco’s skin and tried to drag him down, wanting to kiss him with too much tongue and teeth. Physics didn’t work in his favor, however, and Harry had to live with Draco panting unevenly and thrusting deep in Harry – which wasn’t that bad.
“Ira,” Draco was saying before he had even fully opened the door to their office. “You’re attractive and charming, right?”
“I will,” said Draco, and went to change into his clothes, his heart still pounding loudly in his chest.
Malfoy led the way out of the room, Harry walking hesitantly behind him. He’d been forced to stay in this hospital room for a week now, and now that the time had finally come to leave, he wasn’t particularly feeling at ease. He stopped at the door, peering out into the hallway apprehensively. A few people were walking hurriedly down them, one of them being Malfoy. Inhaling shakily, he stepped out into the hallway, out of the safe confines of the room.
“Well, as fun as this has been,” Draco managed to say, his voice wavering only slightly, “I think I’m going to go back to my room.”
"Take these off," Harry muttered once they'd parted, hurriedly pushing Draco's clothes off. Draco kicked them away, and finally he was just as naked as Harry was. Then Harry said, "I'm a bottom."
“I count on my friends to do nice things for me,” Potter said. “Like you, and Hermione. You remind me of her, actually. You’re tall and white and a man, but still.”
“What happened?” Draco asked, trying his very best to keep his voice even. He was working – this was his job; he fixed the people who came in regardless of who they were.
“I just know him, Mr. Potter,” he said softly. “He’s changed in the nearly two years I’ve known him. He cares about his patients, about his friends, his family. He’s become so much more compassionate; Draco’s always been an amazing Healer, but now he’s even better because he puts everything into helping his patients. Including you.”
Selina stopped in her tracks, and Draco paused too. She resumed her pace straight-away, though her face was white.
Draco tried not to look too pleased with himself. “Well get used to it, Potter. I carry the unique burden of having enough common sense for the two of us.”
“Sort of. It was kind of bad yesterday, but not so bad it interfered with everything. Today, though, I can’t focus on anything…” Potter trailed off.
Draco hated the eighth-year dormitory. The tower had been newly built during the reconstruction of Hogwarts and couldn’t be more different than the dungeons. It was disorienting enough being back at Hogwarts without having to room somewhere new.
“Well, as enjoyable as this was, Potter, I've got to finish my paperwork. And you should really try to get some sleep.”
He opened his eyes and took a deep breath. Just thinking of it – envisioning cutting careful lines and putting his nose to the table – made him yearn for it.
“Do you need anything, Potter?” came Malfoy’s voice, soft and gentle. Harry looked up, startled – he couldn’t believe that that tone of voice was coming from Malfoy. “I can firecall Weasley and Granger over if you’d like to talk to someone. Or, of course, you could spend some time alone before I come back to check your vitals.”
“I know,” Harry sighed. He hesitated and looked over his shoulder to where Draco was standing, invisible. “Look, can we talk about this later? I’m knackered, and I just want to sleep.”
Ignoring this, Harry found his clean clothes folded neatly in the corner of an otherwise bare closet and grabbed them before heading to the shower.
"Don't change the subject," Harry said, too focused on his own hurt feelings to feel too bad about it. "What do you think I've been doing?"
Draco left Potter’s room, his mind now focused on finding a Mind Healer for Potter. They weren't in short supply after the war, what with the trauma and all, but Draco still wanted to provide Potter with the best treatment possible. Draco had gone to a Mind Healer himself, mostly at his mother's and Pansy's insistence.
“Hey mate,” Harry was greeting Weasley with a one-armed hug. He did the same to Hermione and patted Rose’s head. “Sorry I’m all – like this. We were making the bed.”
Draco knocked back the last of his drink, and decided that he wanted some fresh air. There were too many people here and he was sure too many of them hated him. He wondered if the Room of Hidden Things could produce windows or balconies or anything of the like, and then he saw a door appear across the room.
“My uncle put them up after I messed up a meeting with his client,” Harry explained, sighing. “Though it wasn’t really my fault; Dobby dropped a cake on the woman.”
Harry sighed. He didn't want Draco to get upset just because he didn't feel like talking about his feelings (for once, might he add).
“No, it’s fine,” Draco said. He thought a moment, wondering how he would answer. “It didn’t take that long for me to figure out I was gay. I feel like I had an inkling for ages, but I was around twelve when I really figured it out. I wrote to my mother in a panic, asking her if it was alright and all that.” Draco scoffed, remembering how foolish it all seemed now. “She wrote back straight away, telling me that of course it was fine, but was I sure? But really, I’ve never been surer of anything in my life.”
"Yeah, Ron mentioned it to me," she said, and at Harry's frown she said, "I'm his sister, Harry. And though it can be hard to tell, he really does have genuine feelings."
“But then you wouldn’t do it for me,” Potter grinned cheekily. Draco bit his lip to keep from smiling.
“What, you don’t call him ‘Draco,’ too?” Harry scowled, the thought of Malfoy just making his mood worse. “God, what a prat, still strutting about like he’s the best thing on earth, that ponce.”
Draco almost smiled to himself, belatedly realizing just how abnormal his mindset had become. He looked up with the intention of pretending to pay attention to McGonagall, but his gaze caught on Potter, who was sat two rows up and to the left of Draco and was staring at him intently.
if Harry wanted him there, he would stay in a heartbeat. As it was, he didn’t know Harry’s plans yet, so Draco couldn’t make his own.
“Er, yeah, I am,” Harry nodded, a little unnerved by how chirpy her voice was. “I sent an email. I’m Harry.”
He looked up into Ginny Weasley’s shocked brown eyes and took in her pale face, her fiery hair, and her trembling body. He realized that he was trembling, too.
This time, Draco didn’t react quickly enough and he became trapped in Potter’s strong arms. Draco froze, having no idea what to do. Potter was
“It’s alright,” Estrada replied. “I know it’s a part of healing, and I shouldn’t have argued with you-“
“No, I’m sorry,” Draco said, turning toward her fully. “I was too harsh, and you know how much of an arse I can be. And I know you worry, and it means a lot to me, to know how much you care, but I know I’m right about this.”
“Take it off,” Harry growled, and Draco obeyed, unzippering his trousers and pushing them down low enough to reveal his high-quality silk pants. Harry gave a short laugh. “You ponce.”
Draco nodded and followed Harry to the closest fireplace. They Flooed over to Ron and Hermione’s flat, Harry stepping out of the fire, buzzing with excitement.
It wasn’t their fault. Harry had been the one who shut himself in and pushed everyone away. Ron and Hermione had invited him out countless times, he’d just been too fucked up to actually go – either mentally or physically. Or both.
“Breathe, Draco,” Harry reminded him, squeezing Draco’s hand with his own. It was clammy. “It’ll be fine.”
Malfoy nodded to himself again, not revealing any of the numbers’ meanings to the others, and began to scribble away.
And there was how he felt when he restricted. Airy, weightless. Disconnected – and in a good way. It was like he floated above it all; nothing mattered, not really. Just the distant emptiness within him.
“I want you too. But not here,” Draco said, hearing the shakiness in his own voice. “Somewhere with a bed, preferably.”
Draco wondered if he was making it a bigger deal than it was and decided it was likely. Plenty of people had seen Harry Potter keep company with Draco Malfoy, though they couldn’t seem to decide why he did so. Was he taking pity on the subdued ex-Death Eater? Was he being forced to hang around him? Or was he being corrupted by Draco and his evil ways?
“I mean, I figure we’ll all have to sit down and talk about it at some point or another, so we might as well get it over with, right?
That day after Hermione had set off for work, leaving Ron and Harry to clear up, Harry tried again to explain what support groups were.
Harry spilled all over himself and Draco’s hand, feeling his vision black out for a moment, feeling outside of his body and dizzy with ecstasy as he cried out and released. He watched as Draco finished just a couple seconds later; Harry felt it spread inside him and watched as the aftershocks carried Draco for a few more thrusts before he pulled himself out, his chest rising and falling unevenly.
“I can’t believe I almost called them Muggles. I wonder what they think I was going to say,” Harry said, turning again to stare at the door. “Fuck.”
“You don’t know that,” he said just as softly. “You’re still adjusting to – to everything and the feelings you have might not be real. And I know I’m not your Healer anymore, but it was only a few weeks ago that I had power and authority over you, and the power balance is still…”
“That’s alright,” Kathy said, relaxing slightly in her chair though she was still gripping her clipboard a bit too tightly. “If you’d like to step outside to work out your differences, you’re free to do so.” At the unwilling looks of both Harry and Malfoy, she added, “I’m afraid I’ll have to insist.”
Though he was awake (well, not going back to sleep right this second), Draco was still burrowed underneath the covers, his legs tangled with Harry’s. His heart fluttered at the sight. God, he hadn’t had anyone else in this bed since Ginny, and that had been years ago. He knew he didn’t want Draco to leave, and speaking of that, why hadn’t he?
The two Hufflepuffs nodded and left to go upstairs; Harry and Draco waited for the footsteps to disappear before speaking.
He turned and opened his door, taking a few steps inside before swiveling to look at Potter, who was standing hesitantly just outside.
“Harry,” said Hermione softly, placing a hand on his own. He tensed slightly at the touch but relaxed a moment later. “Do you want us with you when you leave? Or will Ginny be enough?”
“Then why do you look like you’re telling me that you’ve accidentally killed someone? As long as the both of you had fully consented, then that’s great news! You’ve only been fawning over him for ages.”
Finally, Potter stopped and took hold of Draco’s arm, tugging him closer. Draco looked up at the faces of Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.
He felt foolish, like an irresponsible baby who couldn’t handle himself in the real world. Harry sat up for a while longer, waiting for someone else to come in.
Potter looked at him, eyebrows furrowed. “I’m worried, Malfoy. That’s the easiest way to put it. But I can tell that anything I say is just going to bounce off you right now, so I’m going to leave.”
They lingered on the unpleasant memory. Potter, strangely enough, looked just as shaken as Draco felt.
,” Draco said, looking away because Potter was still giving him that horrible smile, “You’re a grown adult. You should be able to do these things yourself.”
“Hello, I’m Draco Malfoy, heir to the Malfoy name, one that’s been associated with death and torture and prejudice and being Death Eaters for ages. Nice to meet you. Did I mention we personally had the Dark Lord as a house guest, and that I’ve also almost murdered several people?”
“Oh. Ginny,” Potter sighed. “I still don’t know how to tell her. And it’s even worse cos…well, do you talk to Parkinson about…things?”
Draco waited as Harry retrieved the Invisibility Cloak from his trunk, and made an apologetic face as he passed it to Draco.
,” Potter said, stepping just a tiny bit closer. Draco stiffened. Potter picked up on it, Draco thought, and sighed. “So…then, what about our conversations? It didn’t feel like we hated each other then. I didn’t hate you.”
Exactly one year to the day Harry had stopped speaking (Not that he knew this, Malfoy was keeping track, Harry didn't see the point. he stopped counting after six months) Malfoy made Harry speak.
Malfoy looked at him pityingly, not having the heart to tell him what he knew to be growing under his skin. Not now at least. So he simply said.
So Harry went through the house, noting all the changes made to the once dreary place. His children’s things were scattered everywhere. Pieces of themselves could be found littered throughout the home.
‘Get some rest Draco. Your in for a rough night.’ He ordered, spelling the area clean, and squgiffing the bloody sheets.
Then turning his attention to the grandfather clock in the corner lounge that had just ticked 4:30pm.
“Kindness! He is nothing more than a....” He never got to finish his sentence, as his face was smashed into the cold unyielding stone. He could feel his nose crack! Upon contact. Blood dripping from his mouth.
‘To Teddy’s. I think you and mum need to be alone for this.’ Popping on his gloves and beanie. Opening the door, he hesitated in the entrance way. ‘You’ll still be here when i get back wont you?’ He worried.
Harry sat there gobsmacked. How did Draco know all this. Why did Malfoy know all this. And one does not dump all that in between pass the salt.
“You do the same thing!” He argued. Pushing himself of the ground, and heading to the toilet/sink, where he began to wash himself with the less than desirable drinking water.
The one with the scar laughed. “Oh your Harry Potter are you. Then whose that standing with the war hero’s.” He goaded.
‘I don’t care.’ She grinned back. Grabbing his dick and guiding it to her entrance. ‘It’s been so long Harry.’
The sound grew stronger till the form of Rick filled the doorway. He had no need to look up from those blood stained shoes, to know who it was. His always had blood on them.
‘Of course. I was their witness. The pregnancy I only found out about this morning.’ Draco explained. Spitting out his toast and flicking it over to the bins. As Greenwitch grew ever changing shades of red.
The memory gain came unbidden to his mind. “Run away with me.” He took Ginnys arms and warped them more firmly around him.
‘I SAID IM NOT TALKING ABOUT IT!’ Harry screamed, a flock of birds abandoning their perch in a nearby tree.
The sound of the forest filtering in as the charm fell on the clearing. Neither knowing what to say. What does one say in a moment like this.
No! No! No! Not her. Bile filled his throat, and he heaved all over the dusty floor. One hand on his stomach, the other on the peeling door, for support. The taste of apple and slop, making its way up and out. He couldn't breath. Chocking on vomit, as he hyperventilated.
"What. The. Fuck!" he splutters. His mind racing back to, that night. "GET OFF ME! GET OFF ME! DON'T TOUCH ME! NOT AGAIN! NOT AGAIN!" His screamed, struggling to push her off.
‘I know what we would be putting them through. But what’s the alternative. Have them grow up believing they need to enlist in this war. I put an end to the first war so they would be free of this. I’m doing this for them.’ Harry sated passionately.
Draco remains silent for all of two minutes, placing both hands in the middle of the mountain range, that rested to the left of the battle grounds.
‘We become what they think we are.’ Summoning a twig, with a flick of wand the twig transfigured into a carbon copy of himself. ‘We become dead.’
‘I hope you both know that you are idiotic and foolish and I wont be at either of your funerals.’ Draco scowled.
Entering the Mess tent a sea of wizards and witch’s huddled around tables and lining up at the buffet tables for their food.
As Harry cast protection charms around the tent he was glad he had placed in his pouch. Malfoy trailing behind Harry, placing a ring of potions around the protection charms for added measure, before the two retreated inside.
‘Fuck yes!’ Draco groaned. Pulling down his pants as Harry did the same, jumping into Draco’s arms one he had rid himself of the offending garment. Draco spinning him onto the the tree.
Malfoy tried to peer through the bars, at the source of the voice but was unable. Harry though had an actual view of the man, from over his shoulder.
The gift had treated him well in his first war, so Harry had no reason to believe that it wouldn’t serve him well in his second.
"How, do you know?" Harry shot back. As he tried to get comfortable on his rickety bed. With a piss poor excuse for a mattress and blanket.
Harry lent back on auto pilot resting his head against Draco’s chest, as Draco began to pour the water over Harrys hair and body, washing and rinsing and ridding him of the sweat and blood that still clung to him, the dirt that stained his beard.
He stared at his double bed, that was illuminated by the blue Flame that sat in jars beside his bed, resting on a pile of suitcases that served as a nightstand. He had no idea how long he stood there for but it wasn’t long until he felt draco come up beside him.
Harrys hands digging into the mess of Draco’s hair as he guided him back and forth. Not that Draco needed much guidance, in the half a year since they became A.K, Draco knew how to make Harry come undone with only his pure blooded tongue.
He looks on with a smile. He and Draco once went to a fair like this. They couldn’t enjoy it though, as they were on the hunt. But he remembers Draco commenting on the fact, he’d never been on a Ferris wheel. Harry hadn’t either, growing up with the Dursley’s only Dudley was taken to fairs.
But this Time Harry wouldn’t let it consume him like before, He knew what Draco was doing, He knew what he had to do.
He tried to push her off, but she was stronger, He could feel his heart start to race, and a wave of terror overcome his body as he began to shake.
He found him around the remaining tents, with the ranks who worked the morning cooking rotation, who were also tasked with the clean up of camp. They having been debriefed earlier, and thus exempt from the mandatory meeting. Harry status meant so was he.
“Only squirrels? Were the woods inactive today? I was sure they would be full of life.” Luna hummed. She grabbed the bow and arrow from Draco. Harry watched as she shrunk the weapons with her wand and tucked them into a pouch on the side of the prince’s saddle. He shifted his weight and grabbed one of the squirrels Draco had set next to the rekindled fire. He sat on the log he’d sat on the night before and grabbed a knife.
“Malfoy, are you okay? Can I help you in any way?” Harry reached out to touch Draco’s shoulder, but his hand was slapped away, and he was shoved to the ground. Fear spiked in his chest as he glanced up at the blonde boy.
Luna pressed the back of her hand to his forehead, and Harry stilled. He glanced over at Hermione who hid a smile, and cleared her throat. He glared at her, and she went back to thumbing through her book. He knew what she assumed, she assumed wrong.
Hermione unstrapped her wand and pointed it at the door. “Aloho-” The door swung open, cutting Hermione off. Harry at first didn’t see the blonde, only a shadow in the doorway, but as Hermione walked into his room Draco came into view.
“What do you mean, why am I here?” She asked, a hand held to her chest. “I have a spell on him Harry. It alerts me to noticeable changes in his sleep. I didn’t expect to find you in his bed, Harry. What were you doing next to him? What did you do to him?” So she knew Draco had bad dreams, or something similar.
Hermione chuckled, but pushed past him. She knocked at Draco’s door. When she received no answer she stood close to the door, her hands on her waist.
He walked briskly out of the building and trotted up the hill to find Draco eyeing him suspiciously by the horse stables. Draco’s white steed seemed to also be eyeing him. He smiled and tucked his hands behind his back.
“Enough,” Harry replied, fastening the last tie on the green shirt he’d dressed Draco in. Draco had Harry turn around so that he could change into the dark brown pants Harry had picked out for him.
Harry laid in his cot and stared at the ceiling. He had the blankets pulled up to his chin. Draco’s soft breath filled the room, otherwise the room was silent. The thoughts in Harry’s mind, however, were loud. Had Draco heard him, there was no way the Prince hadn’t heard him as he’d been sitting right next to him. Harry pressed the heels of his palms into his eyes and sighed in frustration.
“Um, Malfoy, I have a question,” Harry asked hesitantly. Draco looked over at him, as if previously lost in thought. He hummed in response. “Do the servants make money by serving your family?”
“Uh, you mean, Luna and I packed, while you did whatever you did,” Harry corrected. Draco shot him a glare. Luna laughed at the both of them, and jumped on her horse.
Hey guys. I figured I'd post this chapter a bit earlier than I'd planned, it was supposed to be longer but I decided to post half of it since I've already kept you waiting long enough as it is.
Disclaimer: I don't own the characters, they belong to J.K. Rowling, but the story is mine so please don't copy it without my permission, thanks.
He carefully began to unpack Draco’s things and hang them in the old wardrobe against the wall in the back of the room. He folded the trousers and placed them in the drawers of the wardrobe. He hung the shirts and placed all of Draco’s boots at the side of the wardrobe so nobody would trip over them if they walked past.
“I’m sorry you had to witness that mate,” Ron muttered. He brushed down his clothes as they turned into the kitchen doors. Harry shook his head. He didn’t want to think about it, Ron talked about it as if it were a normal occurrence.
“Malfoy, you've missed breakfast. I brought you a plate, you should get up for the day.” Harry spoke softly. He had no real idea why he was doing this for Draco but it seemed right.
“Y-yes Master Draco?” Dobby answered, looking up at him slightly from where his head faced the floor. Harry looked from Dobby to Draco and back again. He never knew royals used elves, he thought elves were only for servants.
“Why are all the servants so young?” He asked, before thinking about the question if he was being honest.
“What about their ward, Luna Lovegood?” Harry asked them. Harry furrowed his brows in confusion at Ron’s response, he’d begun snickering to himself, trying to keep his laughter in. Hermione glared at him.
“I just hope you’ll look appropriate, Potter. Let’s buy you some casual wear then, so you don’t have to wear rags,” Draco started walking down the row of tents and small forts. It looked like a small festival had set up along the inside of the inner town streets.
“I forgot. It’s alright, I don’t need anything.” Harry chuckled and scratched the back of his head. Draco gave him a once over and frowned.
“Harry, you mustn’t walk so quietly, it is quite dangerous to spook a horse, they are rather hard to control. Thankfully, she noticed you before I did and didn’t startle quite as badly. Um, I’m guessing Hermione sent you? Did you bring the supplies?” Luna asked, and brushed a loose strand of blonde hair behind her ear.
He decided to go looking for Luna, and figured she’d help him decide what’s best for him to buy and wear, or what not to buy. He figured she could also help him find some casual clothes so he could get rid of the ragged clothes he’d been wearing for half his life. Perhaps he’d actually attract some attention as he’d be wearing something fit for a normal person, let alone a common servant.
“Set it on the table.” Draco spoke, his voice was tired, strained. Harry did as he was told, and turned back around to see Draco raise from the bed, and immediately stumble over. Harry ran to him, and reached out to steady him but the look in Draco's eyes reminded him of what he'd said the day before. He removed his hands from Draco's proximity.
Before he knew it he was done, he opened his eyes slowly and looked in the mirror. His jaw fell open slightly, as his hair was shorter but curly on the top with short almost shaved sides. It was more masculine than what he’d had before, when his curls hung down past his ears. He could see his jawline, and his ears perfectly now. He looked clean, he looked good.
Merlin knows Harry didn’t want Hermione alone in a room with Draco. After what he’d witnessed the other day, he really didn’t want her anywhere near the Prince. Hermione didn’t look affected by Draco’s presence but perhaps it was a front she was putting up, Harry didn’t want to think she was simply used to it.
Harry looked and saw a table, with different satchel’s and other riding equipment. She took a swig of her water, before she turned around and walked deeper inside the barn. Harry walked after her, curious to see the inside. He felt something soft beneath his feet and looked down to see muddy gravel.
He couldn’t imagine anyone else in the room besides them and possibly Luna, but he wasn’t sure if he wanted to imagine any other girl in the room.
Sorry this chapter is a little bit late. I had a busy week. As always the characters are not mine they belong to J.K. Rowling.
Sorry this is out so late, I got set back by finals and then got swamped at work. Hopefully the next chapter won't take so long to get out. A thousand apologies, I hope you enjoy this chapter!
Hermione nodded her head in response against his shoulder. Harry rushed to grab a shirt, and a blanket from Hermione’s bed. He ran over to Ron and handed him what he’d asked for. Ron gave the blanket to Hermione, and she sniffled as she removed her shirt, and crawled further into Ron’s lap to hide. Harry noticed Ron’s cheeks tint slightly, as Hermione pressed into him. She brought the blanket up to cover her front and held it there tightly with her arms.
“You making new little friends, Potter?” Draco sneered, once he was down the hill. He nodded to Luna who simply smiled at him. Harry watched the interaction, and grew curious. How well did Luna know Draco? Were they a thing? He’d have to ask Hermione about it later.
“That's horrible!” Harry gasped. Hermione nodded. She yawned, and glanced not-so-subtly at her bed. Harry chuckled to himself.
“Ron, hey. Sorry to wake you, but could you help me with dinner tonight maybe? I don’t know how to do it myself.” Harry whispered when Ron opened his eyes. The redhead groaned loudly, and clutched his head in pain. He nodded and sighed. Harry stared at Ron, who stared at the ground, before using Harry’s outstretched arm to pull himself to his feet. Harry steadied him, and they made their way slowly to the kitchen, to retrieve the food for serving.
“Harry! You could’ve at least checked a map! Why’d you come here?” Hermione whacked him on the arm. Harry grunted. Ron just stared at him.
The small patched hut she stopped in front of was a barber shop, and Harry stood agape at it. He glanced at her because he’d just been thinking about it back at the castle. She tied both their horses to a post out front. Wondering if she’d read his mind or simply had the same idea as he did, Harry followed her into the hut.
“Thank you.” Harry muttered, leaning his head against Draco’s shoulder. Draco no longer felt cold, his love for Harry warming his entire body as they stood there, watched over by Harry’s parents from wherever they were.
The amount of times he had joked, had jabbed at Harry for not having his parents. For being an orphan. He had made fun of him relentlessly, behind his back but also in front of his face. Poor eleven-year-old Harry Potter, who just wanted a home and a place he belonged, was thrown into a place he didn’t know existed, where he didn’t know anyone but everyone knew him and all Draco had done was making it even more awful.
“One of the reasons why I came here, as well, was to ask permission to ask for Harry’s hand in marriage. I know—I know we are young, and I’m not going to propose just yet, but I just—I wanted you to have a say in this. In all of it.” A gush of oddly warm wind tickled Draco’s neck and then his nose, making the blonde cry just a tad bit harder. He felt his chest warm up with joy, tears falling even faster now.
“I love you.” He whispered, letting the cold wind carry it into the world. He hoped it would reach Harry in the fog that was his brain. Harry had made significant progress due to the help of a team of mindhealers but there were still things that overtook Harry entirely. Draco couldn’t blame him.
“And merlin, does he need the protection. He’s so driven, which makes him incredibly reckless. Just last week I found him in the tree in the back garden, trying to get a kitten out of it. I had to remind him that he was, in fact, a wizard, but he wouldn’t listen and almost fell out of the tree.” Draco smiled at the memory, his chest tightening. He would’ve rushed Harry to St. Mungo’s within a split second if Harry had really fallen out, but Draco was glad his stupid boyfriend had managed to get back on the ground in one piece and with the kitten unharmed.
“My sincere apologies that it took so long for me to come and see you. I felt like I had no right to, with my history. My Father would probably tear out the bricks in his cell if he knew I was here. But I came to the realization that the people I have hurt in the past have forgiven me. Even Hermione did, and Ron. And Harry. He managed to forgive me after everything I did to him. It gave me the courage to finally come and meet you.” Draco took a deep breath, his voice having gone the slightest bit shaky, and he bit his lip.
Draco caressed Harry’s back, pet his hair and placed kisses against Harry’s unruly locks. They didn’t say anything, but Draco knew that this was what Harry needed right now. It had taken a while before Draco had figured it out, but physical affection was something that helped Harry more than anything.
Draco shook his head, ridding himself of such thoughts. He had grown to like—maybe even love—the Weasleys and their antics, not having a problem with their nearly weekly family Sunday lunches. It was always an afternoon filled with laughter and chatter, much different from what Draco was used to.
Draco smiled, his tears still flowing. He squeezed Harry tighter but didn’t say anything, letting the quiet of the room blanket them for the night.
Draco sighed as he halted his step in front of the grave, eyes on the stone and what had been engraved in them.
And Draco felt helpless, really. Because he had no way of helping Harry. This was something Harry had to figure out on his own, so Draco let him. And he was there when it fell apart again. Draco himself had managed to land a job at an apothecary just out of Diagon Alley where he brewed potions, and while he enjoyed it, he wasn’t sure whether it was his end game.
, but Draco couldn’t find it in himself to fight. Instead, he walked over and draped his scarf around Harry, placing a kiss on his forehead.
Draco eyed the iron gates, the trees beyond it looking like everything straight out of nightmares. Perhaps ten-year-old Draco would’ve cowered, would’ve walked away from it. Twenty-one-year-old Draco, however, pushed the gate open and stepped onto the graveyard grounds, digging his nose deeper into the scarf Molly Weasley had knitted for him as a gift.
“He doesn’t know I’m here. I told him I had a dinner date with Pansy Parkinson, my best friend, but I wanted to talk to you. To really meet you and express the love I have for your son.” Draco swallowed roughly, wiping at his cheek with one gloved hand. He was freezing, the wind picking up once more, but he stood his ground. There was no one else around, Godrics Hallow seemingly empty, and it was nice.
Harry’s breath hitched. Draco’s first reaction was to snort, but he held it in. He wanted to snort because there was a side of him that thought the question was utterly ridiculous. Why else would Draco be in Godric’s Hollow? The other side withheld Draco from snorting, because while he knew his boyfriend was incredibly wonderful, he didn’t dare hope for something like this to happen.
Before Harry could say anything, Draco Apparated into their bedroom, laying Harry down in between the sheets and numerous of pillows, gently and careful. Harry’s tiny smile made Draco’s heart rate calm down, his worry easing out of his system. He leaned over Harry, undressing him slowly until he was in his boxers. Draco then did the same to himself, much faster, before he climbed into bed with Harry.
“It may also be the reason why I am so glad that he didn’t decide to become an Auror. I’m ridiculously proud of him for not succumbing to the wishes of others and choosing whatever he wanted to do for himself. I don’t know what I would’ve done with myself if Harry got injured on the field.” The wind around Draco picked up a little bit, ruffling the hair that wasn’t tucked under his hat. Draco smiled to himself, taking it as a laugh from either one of Harry’s parents.
“We should get you home.” Draco said, cutting off whatever Harry was going to say. Harry pouted, looking very much like the puppy Mrs Butterworth –one of Draco’s Mother’s neighbours—had. Draco reached out to cup Harry’s cheeks, caressing the soft skin. Harry nuzzled into the touch, ever the responsive one, and Draco smiled.
Harry scoffed and Draco felt a blush creep up on his cheeks, just realizing what he had said. “What are you—what are you even doing here?”
Draco was taken out of his thoughts by Harry taking a seat on the counter, the kettle already on the fire.
The memory of Harry fighting a dragon was something Draco would never forget. The worry that had come with it was a feeling he still felt. Less for Harry’s life, sure, but still there.
They kept quiet as they walked, Draco holding onto Harry’s hand tightly. It was cold in Draco’s larger hand, but he kept quiet. Harry’s mind was most likely elsewhere. Draco could scold Harry about his lack of care for his own well-being another day.
Draco waited for Harry’s breath to even out before he allowed his own tears to slip past the barrier he had created. Harry didn’t have to see him cry, not in moments like these, so Draco had waited. He let the tears slip, wetting his cheeks. His heart ached at the way Harry’s hands were still tightly clasped into Draco’s sleep shirt, as if he was worried Draco would suddenly disappear.
Harry shrugged at Draco’s question. He was only wearing a hoodie—a muggle garment Draco used to really hate until he started wearing Harry’s—and jeans, dragon leather boots on his feet. “Ron told me you might be here when I floo’d him to ask.”
It was red, hinting at the Gryffindor colours of his boyfriend. And while Draco had laughed and blushed furiously after receiving it, he had nearly cried after Harry and him had gone back to Grimmauld Place. It was the Weasley family, after all, a family the Malfoy’s had tormented for decades.
Draco cast one more glance toward the gravestone and he could feel Harry doing the same, before he pulled Harry away and out of the graveyard and toward the closest Apparation point.
They had been working on it, for the past couple years, for Harry to allow to wish and hope for a future. He had confessed to Draco about how he had no idea for what he wanted in the future, because while everyone else at Hogwarts was trying to figure that out, Harry was trying to figure out a way to not get murdered and to save the entire Wizarding World.
He could hear footsteps somewhere behind him but paid them no mind. Instead, he crouched down and took out his wand, refreshing the flowers that were laid out on the ground, the reef regaining its beautiful white flowers.
Without a word, Draco offered Harry his arm when they got to the warded off point, ready to side-along Harry. Harry smiled at him and took Draco’s arm, making Draco’s heart do a flip. The amount of trust that Harry carried for him, for someone like Draco, overwhelmed him some days. A dark corner somewhere in Draco’s mind told him that he didn’t deserve such trust, that he wasn’t worthy to have Harry to call his own.
“They’re your parents, babe. I needed to see them.” Draco whispered, knowing that Harry needed the quiet right now but also feeling the need to assure Harry that he was here to stay.
But then Harry would smile at him, would kiss him or take his hand and clutch it tightly in a room filled with wizards and witches that
Draco snorted, shaking his head. He felt a bit silly, talking to a gravestone, but he had also deemed it necessary. Harry had sat down with his mother for hours the first time Draco had brought Harry home, their bond now stronger than Draco could have ever hoped for. It only felt right to do the same for Harry, despite the fact that his parents were no longer around. Draco knew they weren’t ghosts, but he hoped they could still hear him.
Draco knew full well that Harry knew those didn’t hold up well if not casted on a thick piece of garment, such as a
“He’s become a great man. Although I’m sure you know this, but I just—I wanted to tell you. He’s kind, loyal, generous and so much more. He gives everything his all and loves without hesitation despite his dark past. He volunteers at a Wizarding orphanage just down Diagon Alley and he can’t wait to have a family of his own. Something he’s always wanted for himself.” Draco felt his heart break, remembering the nights where he was woken up by Harry screaming or crying, wishing for his parents back or for his uncle not to hurt him.
So Draco stood there, allowing Harry to cling to him like that one muggle animal Harry had told him about, saying nothing. He turned the fire off with a wave of his hand before holding onto Harry tightly, lifting him off of the counter.
Draco wondered how that was possible. He was the one who didn’t deserve Harry, and yet Harry was the one who worried that Draco was going to leave him.
“Mr and Mrs. Potter,” Draco started. “I realize it’s quite odd to see me here. Although, I’m sure you must have been watching Harry from wherever you are right now. I hope you are, actually, because I can’t protect that boy twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.”
His voice was shaky, the hurt he felt for Harry overwhelming. He clutched Harry tighter, allowing the pain to settle into his bones instead of his heart. Draco closed his eyes, hoping darkness would take him away.
’. Draco bit his lip and closed his eyes, discovering tears starting to well in his eyes. He let out a shaky breath, hoping to calm his erratic beating heart. It felt odd, to be here, like he was stepping on grounds he wasn’t allowed to enter. Like he was overstepping a boundary. With every second that he stood there; Draco could feel the guilt taking over his body.
doing here, then?” Harry asked, taking Draco’s hand in his. Immediately, Draco started caressing the skin with his thumb.
. He had tried helping the Weasleys, had tried the ministry. Three years after their graduation, though, Harry still wasn’t settled. Was still guessing, not sure what he was supposed to do with his life now that the threat of Voldemort was gone. All he had now was his volunteer work at the orphanage.
Draco could guess as to why that was, but he kept his mouth shut. A reminder of the fact that Harry still hadn’t found a job that he loved wasn’t something Draco wanted to talk about now.
“I also want to apologize for everything I have done, to you. To your son. Everything my father has done, everything Voldemort—Harry taught me to use his name—has done. I know that I wasn’t there, but you didn’t deserve to die. Harry didn’t deserve to grow up the way he did, and if I had the power I would go back and do what I could to save you. I realize these are just meaningless words now, but I needed you to know.” Somewhere in the distance Draco could hear metal scraping against stone, but he didn’t turn away from the gravestone.
“Thank you, Mr and Mrs. Potter. I love your son so much and it pains me to know you won’t be at the wedding in person. However, I do know that you will be with us in Harry’s heart, and I suppose that is enough for us.” Draco didn’t know what else to say. He had told the Potters everything he wanted to say, and it was like a weight had lifted from his shoulders.
It had taken a couple months but Draco got Harry to confess that Harry didn’t deem himself worthy enough for a good future, and that had sent Draco into such a rage he had casted an Incendio so powerful he had burned one of the older carpets in Grimmauld Place. It wasn’t a loss, Harry thought the carpet was abysmal, but it had sent Harry into a crying fit because Draco
“The truth is, I don’t think I deserve your son. I don’t deserve to wake up to his smile every morning. I don’t deserve his love nor his affections, and yet I receive them. I receive them every single day and—I know I don’t deserve it, but I love him so much. More than anyone I’ve ever loved, truly. He’s very special to me, you know.” He could feel warm tears dripping down his cheeks, the cold wind wiping them away and leaving Draco’s cheeks to become cold and slightly frozen.
“I’m Draco, Draco Black, by the way. I completely forgot to introduce myself. Rather stupid of me, I suppose. Then again, if you are watching Harry, you must already know who I am. I used to be Draco Malfoy, but that surname belongs to a life that I no longer wish to be a part of. I’m sure Harry must have told you, or you have seen it yourself.” Draco wasn’t sure where he was going with this at all, but it felt nice to talk without someone interrupting him. It felt like Lily and James were really listening to him.
Draco, that wanted to see him dead or locked up in Azkaban for good, and Draco’s heart would change the dark voice. Even for just an evening.
The truth was, there was only one person he wanted to talk to. One person who knew exactly what he needed.
After his 'episode' as he liked to call it. Harry's days turned rather dull, maddeningly so, all that changed though, The day a guard opened his cell.
The guards stopped in front of what appeared to be an empty cell. Opining the door, and nudging him in. He was having trouble figuring how to walk again. Not wanting to let go of the last vestiges of freedom.
Harry stared up at her even more confused then last time. all he caught was Azkaban. He was guessing the jist of what she said was he was going to go mad. He didn't doubt that.
"I KNOW! I know.. its just. What if they grant me bail. What then?" His Worry evident. He needn't have.
‘Potter. Take my hand!’ He yelled down the side of the cliff face, where the boy who lived clung onto the rocks for dear life.
While leaving him to dress she went an spoke to the guards, as Harry sat back on the bed noticing the guards eyeing him with disdain.
Harry, not wanting to deal with the backlash, of not complying, did as he was told. The guard, placed the cuffs on him before leading him out his cramped, madding cell for the first time, in Seven months. Harry would have cried, if not for the fact he knew he would most likely be heading back in there later.
‘That was a different hex. George was hit with a dark curse. I recognised this one. It will grow back Draco. It will!’ He tried to reassure him.
‘S’not your fault. The target was trained in the specialist dark arts squadron. You had no choice.’ He said, snuggling closer into Harrys warm skin.
‘You two are lucky I had the presence of mind to place a silencing charm.’ Draco drawled making his way out from behind a large moss covered boulder, leaning against it with a cocky air.
Harry sooshing him with a soothing voice, coaxing him into his arms, lying him back down across his chest, and snugging his head under his chin.
Steam rising off of it and Harry, as he once again found himself staring off blankly. He felt like he should be doing something, but he just couldn’t grasp what that was.
"Then you will be free. And out of this hollow. You are more use to me on the outside. And you know that." Harry Prompted, looking away from the paper in his hand, to one of the few people he would actually kill for.
Harry hands were back on her throat. Unfortunately though, this time she saw it coming, and flipped their positions. Knocking the breath out of him.
‘You almost missed mail.’ Greenwitch announced enthusiastically. He was a young boy of 20 who despite being in a war, hadn’t lost his appreciation for life. Harry quite liked him, he hoped once the war was over they wouldn’t loose touch.
"Ha, Ha. Potter. Very funny." He rolled his eyes sarcastically. Harry almost laughed. Almost. Draco's face fell. "What did she do?" He asked hesitantly.
"Why does she do this?" Draco exploded. "I knew the girl. We were best friends. I don't understand it."
He looked at the little squishy red baby. A tiny human. She was covered in goo and blood, black curls on top of her head, and a powerful set of lungs, that didn't stop till he laid her on his naked chest, halfway through pushing he'd had enough of the shift and threw it off.  The little girl rooted around as clasped onto his tit.
Draco was actually stumped at Potters wit. More and more he had these moments of unfounded brains. These moments though seemed to be over shadowed by his equal lack of brains
With a sigh Harry rose stepping into the waiting fabric as Draco warped it around him. The soft fabric tenting as much as Malfoy was.
And it wasn’t long now until it would be set in motion. His felt his tongue settle over the roof of his mouth, where the Mandrake leaf rested.
What with Balthazar long dead, He found his mind starting to slip back to that dark place, The place Draco had dreaded he would return to as soon as he left.
"The little slut!" one of them mumbled. harry thought that was a bit uncalled for, as he fiddled with the stripped garb.
Each day they picked someone new. The moans and screams bouncing of the walls, in the silence. Everyone feeling sorry for the days victim. But all secretly grateful it wasn't them. None of them ever bothered Harry though. For which he was both equally thankful and frighted of.
"Well. Can you distract me with actual, helpful facts." He groaned. Gripping the tattered linen, "instead of anecdotes from ancient Greece."
‘How did you survive?’ James asked. Some time later. They two sitting across from each other in the kitchen, two cups of tea making themselves as they spoke.
‘I know.’ He replied with a wet kiss and well placed thrust into her warm heat. ‘Uhhh.’ She moaned in pleasure.
‘Potter.’ Came the annoyed reply. ‘You’ve not come to talk me out of my orders again.’ Harry attempted to reply. But a hand full of scars halted him. ‘I’ve already had words with your lackey...’
Malfoy looked on at Potters hunched form, in concern and confusion. He was taking this rather badly. So, Pansy had neglected to mention to Potter that she was a slut, who got herself pregnant. It was going to hurt he had no doubt about that, but it was like this was the nail in Potter coffin.
But it did. And here he was wallowing in he back yard in the very tent he’d first cheated on his wife. The woman who was meant to be his other half, the second part of his soul.
The pounding on the borrow’s bathroom door, was not helping the throbbing of his head, nor the nauseous feeling in his stomach one bit.
Their target Farmon. Had been the one to push Harry off the cliff in an attempt to escape. But Harry needing to be the hero that he is, had taken Farmon over with him. And the man was now dangling from Harry’s legs.
Ginny rose on her knees behind him. Pressing her naked body against his back, wrapping her arms around his neck.
‘He said I’m overreacting and overestimating my importance. That even if I was head Auror in the real world, this is a War. I must listen to my superiors, and that we aren’t facing Voldemort this time.’ He snarled.
His throat hurt, and tears clung to the sides of his eyes, his mouth also tasted awful, once it had stoped spewing up his lunch.
Which meant, Pansy would be distracted, with Draco free that meant her sights were on the one she couldn’t control, and that suited Harry perfectly.
With a grunt. It seamed like the witch was done. She pressed the head of dead bird, and with a pop! Two Azkaban guards showed up. One giving the witch a toothy grin "Rosie." he said then kissed her on cheek.
"No!" Harry cut him off. She's mine." Harry reiterated." The look in his eyes, told Malfoy all he needed to know.
He had owned Ron when the man had sent a patroness asking where he was, telling the man he needed just one more day to himself before dealing with the weight of returning from the dead. Booking a muggle hotel for the night with a well placed confoundess on the administrative staff.
With a chuckle Ginny went over to the stove, as Harry closed the back door, and picked up the discarded letter.
"Why. would you give me this?" He hissed. Through clenched teeth. Clutching the parchment so hard, he'd feard it ripped.
“Next time I cut it off. Malfoy!” Rick, spat through the bars. Harry didn’t deny, that Rick would follow through with his words. He can still hear the screams from the last time Rick, had payed Draco a visit.
Since his arrest, that constant sate of nausea had been relentless. Waiting in his holding cell, never knowing when they would whisk him off to Azkaban, or even give him a fair trial. Well.. A trial in any case. Harry highly doubted it would be fair.
Classic Mind healer move, letting them waste time till they are ready to speak, so they can rack up the gallons, simply by sitting in silence, before saying their time is up and what a productive session they had, and please do come by next week, that will be a hundred gallons, please see the receptionist on your way out.
"What is it?" Malfoy demanded as he shot off his mattress like A WWW firework. "Potter if your scar is hurting..."
Harry held him closer. Because he knew if his father had come back from the dead. He knew he’d never let him go.
"Yes. Potter! That's exactly what happened. One night in fifth year, Pansy made me swear off woman. because she was such a dismal lover." Each word dripping with Sarcasm. "Seriously, Potter! I realized i was  a flaming shirt-lifter, when I had my first wet dream! How you manged to stay alive long enough to defeat a dark lord. Is beyond me." He rolled his eyes in exasperation. Before again, realizing what he had unwittingly let slip.
"Oh please, as if the saviour of the wizarding world would hurt his precious daughter. No. Not to worry, your little half blood is safe."
“What? Nothing to say. He continued, through the cold damp hallways. Walls oozing an unknown substance. Harry clenching his fists, nails creating crescent moons on the soft flesh of his palms.
Harry grinned. ‘Luna! Wow, now there’s a name I haven’t heard since before the war. How’s she doing?’
‘Yes. Actually that’s why I’ve come. Hermione is ready to take over as minister once Bone’s is down. She’s I still cant believe the girl we went to school with is behind it all. Are you positive its her.’
The old crone looked down at him for a minute. Smudged glasses slipping down her pointy nose. Then let out a maniacal cackle. The auror joining in, shocking Harry when he spoke.
Harry was about to call out to her when another beat him to it. His own. He stilled at the sight of Hermione smiling at the impostor weakly. Don’t be fooled Hermione his mind screamed but she continued conversing with Pansy, none the wiser to the snake she was.
Morning brought with it more dismal weather, as Harry made his way outside to the greeting of more rain, sliding down the weather repealing charms.
I couldn’t have planned it better myself. You could almost call it dramatic irony. Though you are to..what was it Draco used to say? Filled with fire. I believe I have to take measures to assure your compliance.” She smirked.
"Oh darling. My life was always a lie." Grabbing his cheeks she forced his face to look at hers. Lent down, and kissed him.
James fiddled with his sandwich for a second, before jumping up and grabbing his jacket from the hallway hooks, near the front door.
Harry let out another scream. The shaking of the bars, could be heard down ether end of the cell block, to the annoyance of the other inmates. Who make their displeasure known, using words Harry didn't even know existed.
Both of them divesting the other of their cloths. Ravenous hands reaching out for each other on the kitchen floor. ‘This is kind of gross’ Harry laughed as he flung a crumb out of her hair.
Harry quickly pulled something out of his pillow case. Throwing it through the bars. Draco caught it with a smile.
So now there he stood. On the steps of 12 Grimuald place. He’d had the home refurbished and insisted they move there when the second Great War started. Needing a home that was safe from those who would seek to harm his family.
"What, are you talking about?" He grumbled rubbing his lower back. It was in a constant state of agony lately.
"Yes, well Potter that is generally what happens when one cant sleep." He scoffed, at Harry as if he was an idiot.
Harry got of the lounge, taking the objects off him, and placing them on the table behind him. ‘He’s off to resurrect us. We have till morning.’
Harry stopped his pacing, and got on the bed. Leaning on the wall for support. A cry escaping him as he leaned there.
Draco smiled up at him sadly. ‘I know you do potter. But another draw back to it is...its why we are in this war. The reason the war started.
"Oh, for Salazars sake." Harry heard Pansy groan in annoyance, harry's voice coming out of her. It was disconcerting and did nothing to help his current state. Leaning on the wall for support now.
So after learning it back to front, Harry moved on to muggle and Wizarding maps of the British isles, it only grew from there. Hermione often told him he should study geography at uni but he found when forced to do anything he quite lost interest in it.
Why did they need to but into his private life. You didn’t see him asking George why he and Angelina where no longer married. Or when Percy sorry Pula had transitioned. Harry let them be because it was their lives he needn’t interfere. They didn’t seem to get the message though where he and Gin were concerned.
Both Harry and Draco were stunned and relieved at the. A 3 year war had ended somewhat anticlimactically.
"Your in prison, love. You got no rights here. So, I suggest that you hurry this along, before I come over and rip those lovely little school girl robes off you." Tristyn threatened. "I Aint got all day." he warned raising his wand.
“Hey, Hermione?” Harry asked. She looked over at him from where she was standing by Cedric. “Would it be possible for us to go into town together sometime?”
“Your arm Malfoy?” He asked politely grabbing the blondes wrist. Draco let him guide his arm into the sleeve of the jacket, followed by the other. He pulls the jacket tight over his shoulders and smoothed it down his front.
Hedwig was alarmed by his change in appearance and he laughed and kissed her nose to calm her down. Perhaps they should stop by a sweets shop to pick up some sugar for the horses.
It was perfect, the steak was hot, and the inside was a beautiful red, warm not cold. He stuck the piece in his mouth and it practically melted on his tongue. He ate the rest of it hungrily, before moving onto the vegetables. Smoked broccoli, grilled carrots. He practically inhaled the rest of the food, licking his fingers when he was finished. He panted, and smiled. Best meal he’d ever eaten.
