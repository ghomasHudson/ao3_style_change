“You know me so well.”
“Harry?”
century warlock, and not a functioning bookstore. Draco climbs an old rickety ladder with secret delight, and feels Harry's eyes on him as his fingers are brushing over the spines of a pretty hardback set.
“Oh.” It clicked. Harry rubbed his hand over his stubble a little bashfully. “Yeah, I’m just lazy. I’ll shave it soon.”
“Well,” she said, once she’d stopped laughing. “He always was a bit, underneath, wasn’t he?”
Harry rubbed his lips together. Then he glanced down.
“That was once,” Malfoy growled whilst Harry raised his brows at him. He was scowling down at the fire.
Harry closed his eyes. Then he looked over at Luna, where she was busy with her own shovel. Her long, wavy white hair was tied back, stick in places to the back of her neck where she was sweating. Her top was surprisingly simple, just a short-sleeved cotton turquoise piece – the fabric pulled over her shoulder a bit with her movements. Her face was clear, easy, focused – her fingers fumbled over the leaves of a weed and gently pushed it aside.
“Oh,” said Harry. “Oh no, you really don’t need to –”
Malfoy leaned back in mock astonishment. “Could such a thing exist?”
He didn’t know if Harry heard. Draco was very good at noticing, but when his feelings were as big as this, it was difficult to see past them.
If you couldn’t get out, sometimes you just had to keep going in.
The flight was delayed.
Inside the room, Harry took off his jacket and put it on the bed. He was acutely aware of the sweat drying on his neck.
“How do you feel?” said Oceania as she got up and turned off the CD player. Harry shrugged.
“It was an awful thing, you know.” says Potter. “He killed them.”
“I should probably go and check on the rest of the circus,” said Malfoy, a little out of breath. Harry rolled his head back on his shoulders and made a noise of agreement.
Back in Scotland, it hadn’t been like that. In Scotland, Harry always knew what other people wanted.
“I thought you were a dominatrix,” he said, mostly to distract Malfoy. He pressed his eye to the viewfinder.
“I can’t –” he said, and immediately ran out of vocabulary. He shook his head again.
“Ah.” Oceania’s voice was light. “That’ll be why.” She leaned back and appraised him for a long moment. “Are you still thinking that?”
“How long have you been doing yoga?” asked Harry.
They kiss and kiss, Malfoy angling Harry’s chin with one hand, her tongue delving into Harry’s open mouth, tasting her, taking her, mouths clashing against each other that their lips are both bruised. Malfoy grabs Harry’s hips and shoves her further into the wall.
“He was a Deatheater, you know,” Harry says conversationally. “Killed his wife and children when he gave them up to Voldemort – it’s very sad.”
Harry tilted his head, considering her. “Why?” he asked, after a moment.
The next day, Harry climbed up the mountain himself. The walk was hard in the heat, sweat dripping down his forehead and gathering under his arms, but the view was beautiful.
It shouldn’t have mattered as much as it did. Harry pressed down his face into Draco’s jumper and breathed in. It shouldn’t have mattered; it did.
Tom considered the question. Outside, the birds were calling to each other, their high-pitched songs darting through the open space.
“I’m not depressed,” said Harry. Hermione reached for his hand. He looked at it, at her dark skin resting atop his.
“That’s what you said the last time when you sprinkled blue cheese over the fire-walk,” said Charlie, “I feel like you’re just making these up. I don’t even know where you got the blue cheese.”
“It’s happy.”
Harry did not. Why Oceania expected him have any sort of general knowledge on types of princesses was beyond his grasp. But he loved her deeply, and so he just said, “Thanks, Osh,” in a relatively unstrained tone.
He didn’t have to knock once he was outside Oceania’s door. She tugged the door open as soon he was there, smiling brightly and dressed entirely in a large fluffy item of clothing that appeared to be consuming her. Her small eyes blinked animatedly at him over the edge of it.
“Did you spend the night exchanging secrets? I’m surprised your hair isn’t braided.”
He knew he was mixed – his body shared evenly between India and England – but his heart was Scottish. He thought sometimes that maybe everybody here could see it.
There was a longer pause. And then Draco finally moved, the sound of the turning duvet was incredibly loud in the small room.
Malfoy blinked quickly at Harry. He parted his mouth. “Are you…asking me what it feels like to…be attracted to men?”
Now he was facing the loch. Malfoy had dropped his hands, and Harry could see him looking out of the corner of his eyes. He blinked, and the skin of his eyes was enflamed enough to ache.
Malfoy froze. “I’m sorry?”
– but for once, the phrase didn’t make something close up inside of Harry.
“Topping doesn’t just refer to gay men, you know,” Harry’s saying, leaning her head back against Draco’s bare shoulder and putting the book down. “Can you really call yourself a lesbian when you don’t know the terminology?”
“It’ll do.”
This must be the earliest I've ever uploaded a new chapter. You can thank quarantine for that, I suppose. This chapter's song is The Love We Almost Had by Rhiannon Giddens.
“Mm,” said Luna.
This was not a lot, Draco reasoned. This was a quite acceptable request. Draco was used to being spoilt, no denying that, but hey? He’d grown up?
Okay. Maybe a little like how she imagined.
This is…running.”
He was leaving.
“Well put.” Malfoy raised a grape to Harry, before popping it in his own mouth.
Harry took a deep breath through his nose. “Okay,” he said. “Fine. Thank you.” He took the tank and disappeared into the bathroom.
Harry stood on the other end of the room for a beat, just watching him. His hands were still closed around that soft, soft material.
“Is he always this rude?”
Six. Six steps. The air between them
The walk down from the temple wasn’t long. When he turned the final corner, Jane was sitting down, her turquoise wings folded up under her. When she saw Harry she stopped licking at the corner of one and did the dragon equivalent of raising a brow.
he said.
“Right,” said Ron, and abruptly turned on the spot and walked in the bedroom. “I’m lying down.”
“You too,” he said to Charlie. Together they passed under the archway and up the steps to the main building of the monastery. Charlie and Hayden both seemed to know where they were going.
“I…” Harry’s throat cracked.
“So glad to have your approval,” sneered Pansy. “I’ll let my therapist know that we can continue after all, since Harry Potter’s given me the thumbs up.”
Harry shrugged again. “Sure.”
“Do I?” Draco arched his brow. He was definitely smiling, under all that honeyed drawl. Harry wriggled again, just a little.
“They’re a tribute to Vincent,” said Oceania shyly, stroking the bristled end of her brush. “I’ve always liked him. I feel like we would’ve got along.”
“Maybe you’re thinking about it wrong.” Harry didn’t say it unkindly. When Harry spoke like this, it was with an almost child-like innocence.
Draco crossed his arms, keeping his face carefully blank. He didn’t trust himself with this, not even a little bit. He had waited far too long. He had wanted far too much.
Malfoy raised a brow. His hand twitched from where it hung inside his sleeve, brushing against Harry’s knuckles like a trapped butterfly.
“Change behind the hill. I’m not going to hex you in your panties, Potter.”
“Cheer up,” said Harry, and clicked the shutter. Malfoy glared daggers at him.
“Fuck, Malfoy,” moans Harry, and in some deep recess of her mind she is surprised by how much she sounds like pure pornography. “Fuck, please, give it to me.”
“Oh wow,” said Ron.
said Malfoy, once he could talk. “Stop, I’m going to – I’m going to –”
Malfoy lifted his head enough to blink blearily at Harry. “Hmm?” he managed.
Draco was already looking at him. His lashes fluttered, and then he leaned in, and was right there. His mouth captured Harry’s.
Falling back to the grass, Harry let his arms slump out around him, one of them thudding against Malfoy’s chest. He was breathing hard, still gulping down laughter, tears forming at the edges of his eyes.
How long had it been now? A few weeks? A month? It was still sitting there, in the middle of his floor, amidst all the clutter. Every morning, Harry had to make sure he rolled over on the right side in order to avoid stepping on it.
“Am I not normal?” He asked.
“I didn’t think you weren’t straight.” says Harry. “In school.”
“Good thing we’re going to a gay bar,” she said, “There, everyone is beautiful.”
Harry was standing up and putting his coat on. “You know what? Let me know if you’re ever interested in taking my job seriously.”
Harry let her go.
The wind was not so readily admitting defeat. It seemed intent on revealing Malfoy’s pointy hip-bones and belly-button to the entire world, despite his fluttering hands. Harry said, “I didn’t know you had a dragon.”
“Maybe,” said Hayden, a touch of acid in their voice, “this would be easier for you if you thought of people as people first and as men and women second.”
It’s not exactly a momentous occasion as such – it’s not that one day she wakes up wanting to kiss them and hold their hands and adorn herself in rainbow robes. It’s just that, over the course of a couple months in that year, the line of thought draws closer and closer to the front of her mind.
“Don’t you?” he prompted after a few moments when it seemed like she wasn’t going to continue.
“But you didn’t do yoga, did you? Your body hasn’t given way yet, I could see in your first class.”
“You do,” he murmured, and Malfoy’s eyes were so grey, all the time. “You do know me.”
“Short for Polfoy.” Harry nodded. “We don’t want him to get bullied at school.”
“Who’s Rihanna again?” asks Ron.
“We’ve got something better than sushi,” she said, eyes bright and mischievous.
The path had crossed over the threshold of the forest some time ago, and now they were inside it, surrounded on all sides by elegantly limbed trees and ripe green florae and golden sunlight, pouring in generously through the gaps in the trees above. The fertile scent of ungoverned nature wrapped itself around them, enclosing them in their own little slice of paradise.
“I’m looking for someone,” he found himself saying to the smiling monk in front of him, who seemed to be having some trouble understanding him. “Urm – orange hair?” He gestured vaguely to his head and the monk nodded happily, apparently completely unbothered by the one-sided element of the exchange.
“I suppose.” says Harry.
Malfoy had could also be rather reserved. He hadn’t been reserved in Hogwarts. He hadn’t been reserved until he’d learnt he could lose, Harry supposed.
When he got home he kicked his shoes off and then righted them against the wall. Then he set about making tea. He didn’t even like tea in and of itself that much, but he liked the process. It asserted his presence in the house.
Harry took a deep breath. “I said that I thought I should leave.”
Harry felt a tugging in his face as he looked down at the book, and realised he was smiling.
“Well,” said Malfoy, “She’s mixed. That’ll be why.”
Harry woke up.
“Not much to say,” said Harry. “It’s been going on for a few years. Sometimes it’s manageable. Sometimes it’s not.”
“Never?” was all he managed.
“I’m essentially queer,” said Zambini.
“Oh god,” Malfoy managed, straightening up just enough to catch the edge of Harry’s sleeve and tug Harry back down. He was still winded, his face bright red from all the laughing. “Don’t, dear god. You really are the light in my life.”
Harry felt his eyebrows go up. Malfoy laughed and then, tugging on Hayden’s arm, said, “Come on golden boy. You won’t lose your Gryffindor badge of honour in one night.”
The trolley had somehow filled rather suddenly with five sets of packaged persimmons. They watched sombrely as Oceania threw in the sixth.
“Don’t ask me to stay,” Draco whispered.
Blaise came back with the much needed whiskey to a significantly more tense table.
Malfoy pushes back against Harry, trying to free her wrists, expression murderous. But although they’re roughly the same size, Harry is broader, and besides, she still has her magic. Malfoy brings her closer with her legs when Harry starts licking at her cleavage, scraping her teeth over the thin material of her bra, and she groans like an animal in pain.
Harry left Malfoy leaning against the tree and crossed over. Once he was there, Oceania took his hand, pulling him down with her. He fell into a crouch.
“Stop it,” said Harry. “Just shut up. Shut up.”
“Well,” said Charlie. “You know some people get, like, diseases in their brain? It’s a bit like that. Even with dragons. People sometimes forget that they get sad too.”
Draco blinks and sucks some more ice cream into his mouth. “Their dicks are also small.” He says after a moment, his voice mournful. Harry snorts beside him, and is then leaning in, capturing Draco’s vanilla-raspberry mouth his chocolate one.
“And there’s the gay thing,” said Oceania.
“Isn’t there anything that makes it smaller?” she asked.
When Harry next went to see Tom, he was surprised to see Oceania sitting down on a mat next to him.
There’s a pause where Draco just swallows.
Charlie met Harry’s eye. “I didn’t buy them,” he clarified, apparently having seen something in Harry’s expression. “Draco bought them for me. One for each birthday so far.”
“Erm.” Harry side-eyed the shopkeeper, who’d been unabashedly watching their every exchange. “Is that okay?”
It was not a physical sort of pain. Pain was almost not the right word for it. It was a hurt that was in his soul. Soul was the only word deep enough to represent it.
“I will not,” Draco protested in a rather higher pitch that was ideal, and wrapped his legs around Harry. Harry hoisted him higher. Merlin, he could really feel
“Oh,” said Harry. He felt a little dizzy. “Well.”
Then he went to the kitchen, and filled a glass of water. He left it on the coffee table.
Draco smiled a little, in the corner of his mouth. Harry watched as the shadow of the overhead caressed the slant of his cheekbone, combed through his hair.
“Terribly,” Harry whispered back. Draco grinned.
“Could we?” His tone was dry.
“Can I be real with you?” asked Harry, “I don’t really, like, know what I’m doing. Like, at all.”
“Oh.” Harry swallowed, and was a bit relieved when she looked back down. A slice of sunlight cut over her side-profile. She had spoken about all of this very easily, a simple recounting of facts, like telling a fairy-tale, but it must have been strange. Very strange, to only figure something so essential out once you were already practically adult.
“What?” Malfoy ran a hand through his pale hair restlessly. “Oh. Merlin, Harry. Metaphors are like condoms. Best used once, twice if you’re desperate.”
Luna looked curiously towards the bar, and then, turning back to him, said, “Just a cider, please.”
Harry held up a box of crotchless butterfly panties.
When he came back out, changed, Draco wasn’t looking at him.  He was looking at the suitcase in front of the bed. From this angle, you couldn’t really tell it was unpacked.
“There’s a connection,” said Oceania. “Like a buzzing. A humming. You have to feel it.”
In the end, Draco looked up one night that was so like that night before it all and saw the constellation he was named after. He pointed it out to Harry.
It wasn’t anything particularly special about the dancing. Malfoy danced the way most good people danced, freed and instinctively rhythmic, a simple desire to honour the pleasure of music. But what Harry liked was the way that he fit in, almost immediately, with the rest of the crowd. Malfoy like this, with his painted face and neon shirt, was a local, knitting in perfectly with smells and the sounds and the colours, all around him. The feelings, too. The feelings of a nightclub – ecstasy, lust, and liberation. A kaleidoscope of an evening, where the only goal was pleasure, pleasure alone. He was in his environment. Harry liked it. He liked to see other people’s environments. He felt that they were physical expressions of something inside.
“Harry,” he said warmly. “Great to see you.”
“Oh, no,” said Harry as he came around the corner, “Oh bloody fucking hell no.”
“You’re a vegetarian?”
“Actually,” he said, his heart thudding quietly in his chest. “Would you like to go grab a coffee sometime? Just to catch up?”
Tom’s gaze was very level. “Tracy,” he said.
Ron was sitting on the opposite couch. Upon seeing Harry, he had simply just stared at him, as if he was seeing an apparition. Then he had slowly raised his hand, fist-bumped Harry, and then said, in a dazed sort of voice, “Come on in, mate.”
“It’s not…I know that sounds stupid. But it’s hard for me to explain. I’ve never had to before.”
They all looked at him. He gave them a shaky smile.
“I think I like you better like this,” he said conversationally.
“Yes,” said Malfoy, “But –” He sucked in a breath, seeming entirely too pleased with how the entire situation was turning out. “He was the youngest seeker in a century!
“I don’t understand you sometimes,” he said. “But it’s not because you’re stupid.”
Draco likes to sit on one of the sofas, and drink her tea there. There are too many sofas for one person, but that’s okay. There’s also too many tea cups, so Draco only uses one.
Harry bit his bottom lip. Then he nodded.
This room was a room made for guests. He was a guest. Here, in this place. In Gay Dragon Village. In everywhere he went.
“I know a nice deli spot.”
Before Harry had come to Gay Dragon Village he had occasionally wondered what had happened to Draco Malfoy. Maybe he hadn’t vanished, but to Harry he might as well have. There had been so much happening in the forefront of his life for so long that the curiosity was little more than a flicker in his peripheral vision. There wasn’t room for it to grow.
There was the sudden sound of bells. It rang through them, loud and echoing. They both broke away to look down towards the village below.
“It’s a cultural thing,” Hermione had said. “Dragons have always been a significant part of Asian folklore. In fact, many Chinese communities used to worship dragon gods. It’s really very interesting. If only our education hadn’t been so Western-centric, we would have been exposed to a lot more magical diversity. Really, when you think about it, Hogwarts has lots of areas for improvement…”
Ginny and Harry haven’t exactly ended it, per say. They still love each other. There just isn’t…too much…sexual energy.
and the novelty of everything that he’d rarely actually taken anything in.
Luna smiled at him. “Thank you,” she said. “I still love daddy dearly of course, but it felt like time to be on my own.”
Malfoy wanted Harry to do a leather striptease.
Hayden raised an eyebrow.
Draco laughed again. He was taller than Harry had remembered. “You’ve already done that part.”
“I suppose,” he said, managing to keep his voice even. Oceania didn’t notice.
She looks over. On the edge of the kitchen counter is a new kettle.
The world went very still. Harry blinked, his damp lashes brushing his fingers.
“Hayden,” said Tom. His tone was soft, but somehow reproving. Harry was surprised when Hayden met his eyes and only twitched a brow before shutting up.
Potter straightens up. “Kumbukani Laska? You heard of him? At all?”
“Okay,” said Malfoy. He was smirking at Harry slightly now. “Got it. Harry Potter is a mere amateur in spirituality.”
“You don’t have to,” said Malfoy.
“I’m going to a show after this,” he said, lowering his voice and his gaze. His lashes were very light, fanning against the blush of his cheeks. He looked like a porcelain doll under the white lights in that moment, a delicate lacey doll to be dressed and undressed. “At Toxic. Benjamin is performing. You remember Benjamin.”
“You could,” she enthused.
,” said Malfoy, from around his paper straw.
The concept of meditation wasn’t really anything that Harry got worked up over, but for the sake of an uncomfortable Malfoy who still resolutely studying the feet of a goddess, he nodded and stepped forward.
“Right,” said Malfoy. He breathed in again. Harry watched, and realised, with a shock, that the strange expression was anger.
Harry clenched his jaw. He tried to think it through.
The last place they visit is Notre Dame. The white walls rise out of the ground is geometric grandeur, and they wander through the hushed silence and glowing multi-colour patterns that float down onto the cold stone.
had become
“Oh. Sure. I’ll just –” He stood up and followed Charlie down the track, next to the forest that sprung up off to the side of the cafeteria.
Harry leaned in and took a breath, before taking a careful drag. It filled his lungs. He looked over at Malfoy, who was leaning by the door and watching him, his eyes dark, and slowly released it. The white smoke clouded between them, curling at the edges.
“The dragons?” Harry also threw up his hands. Oceania raised a fist for him to bump without looking in his direction.
It wasn’t even Draco Malfoy as an actual person, but rather the concept of him. All that he encompassed. All the other stories of suffering that Harry hadn’t been privy to. During that time of his life, Harry had often felt desperate to hear a version of post-war that wasn’t familiar. The story of Draco Malfoy – and all the others – would have been a sort of escape he hadn’t been able to access.
Draco hesitated, just a little, and then walked over and started throwing chunks of raw meat at Jane. He glanced over at Harry when he realised Harry was staring.
“That’s why – he had a lover. Some boy he kept safe in an abandoned house.” Draco rushes on, blinking back the stinging in her eyes. “I’m not saying it’s excusable, what he did. I’m just saying – he wasn’t… made of stone. That’s how you made it sound.”
Harry laughed. “You don’t have to lie, Luna.”
“Sure you are.” Delia spun back to face her computer, bored now. “You’re the most average man I’ve ever met. You’re, like, a caricature of normality. No offense.”
His head snapped back up. “I’m not wearing these.”
“Urm,” he said, and sort of shuffled closer. He tried to look up at her from under his lashes. She was just standing there, staring at him. Jesus. Why had no one ever taught him how to flirt?”
“Making conversation?” Malfoy suggested, politely.
Eventually, Malfoy said, “Open your eyes.”
They both stare at Harry.
Harry laughed, a little breathlessly. He kept tracing along the white line of the pinkie. Then he dropped his hand and tipped his head back. God, the blue was so vivid.
“Am not,” Oceania half-sang, “Just happy. Glad t’be alive.”
“Can I get you anything else?” asked the waiter. “Extra parmesan?”
Malfoy stares into the plate like it’s the face of a long-lost lover.
“No.” Malfoy’s voice was very close. “You can stay quiet, like a good muse.”
did you know?” Harry rasped, pulling his gaze away from the birds and back to Malfoy. He cleared his throat hastily.
Luna smiled easily. “Thanks for apologising, Draco. It wasn’t really your fault. I know it was you who left me the extra food.”
She goes into the bedroom and pulls out the clothes she is going to wear. And then she falls back into the duvet and holds the sheets to her face, clutches them between her fingertips. Breathes in, beathes out. Closes her eyes.
“If I was going to lie about my job,” said Pansy neatly. “I would not declare myself a fucking journalist.”
“I,” said Harry, and stuttered to a brief halt, aware he was blushing, “It’s not – I didn’t – look, Malfoy said it. The other day.”
Harry choked on the peppermint. It got lodged at the back of his throat, and he gasped and wheezed for another moment until Delia threw a tissue at him and hit his back with a touch too much relish.
“Uh huh,” said Gao. “Why don’t you tell me about that?”
Oceania and Hayden were too busy smoking more and talking to notice. He looked into Harry’s eyes. They weren’t seeing him anymore.
When he opened his eyes, he saw Malfoy on the other mat, his torso curved and pressing into the mat, his long leg stretching out behind him, his bare foot exposed. Harry looked at the pattern of pink and purple flowers on the other man’s leggings, climbing over his ankle and calf muscle, wrapped around his slim thigh. As they came back to downward dog, the bare foot curled in under itself, bracing against the mat. Harry released his leg and moved back, his view returning to his own knees.
“I could suck on your clit right here,” says Harry. “I could go down on my knees and roll it between my teeth until you forget what a dish even is.”
“Draco’s always had trouble with meditating,” said Tom, startling Harry out of his thoughts. He had a contemplative expression, his geometric brows drawn in slightly. “But I think you’ll be good at helping him. You’re very honest.”
Harry sighed and Charlie sighed and then produced a can of beer for Harry and one for himself and Harry accepted, and then they got appropriately pissed as they watched the bloody awesome fucking sunset, and it was all very lovely, and Malfoy didn’t want to teach Harry anymore.
he said, drawing out the sound like a Cheshire cat. “Did he not mention?”
Malfoy did meet him in the cafeteria. Harry was sitting there, wondering, not for the first time, where it even was that Malfoy lived, when Malfoy appeared walking towards him.
“I don’t want to be an inconvenience.” He felt uncomfortable.
“Potter,” she says. “You are disgustingly predictable. And cheap.”
They were up, and for a wondrous, heart-rendering moment, Harry was surrounded in the blue. He was overcome by it. It wasn’t the blue of the Loch, of his heart, of Jane’s – it was the blue of breathing, the blue of life. It was wide, and full, and almost jarringly vivid. He had to close his eyes to it.
Draco moaned softly into his mouth and his head rolled back further. Harry had to catch his skull in his other hand.
“Is that a line?” he asked, softer than Harry had expected.
Pansy narrowed her eyes. They flitted from Harry’s face to his hands, which were holding one of the photos in place on the wall.
“Me neither,” he tossed back into the taming area as he walked away, mostly just to finish his own conversation.
Harry raised his brows as he chewed a bite of bao zi. It didn’t taste like anything today, but Harry hadn’t expected it to.
“Have you ever taken tea in bed?”
Draco had said he was going back – he hadn’t said when. After a few days, Harry said, “I should introduce you to Hermione and Ron.”
“Fucking nice Harry,” said Hayden, and when Harry looked up they were grinning appreciatively. He met Oceania’s eye and she winked at him, raising her glass. The sudden rush of love filled up his lungs on his next inhale, and he was suddenly so grateful, so immensely grateful for these people and this village and this truth, and he thought maybe he was going to cry, which was awfully embarrassing and cliché.
“Oh, Tom,” said Oceania, and beamed at him. They all had some champagne.
There was a TV opposite the island, and the sofas at either end. A raw birch coffee table sat on its legs between them. The legs were real branches.
Harry shook his head. He wondered whether his dark skin was also reddened like a rose, or whether it hid it.
“No,” said Harry, startled. Yoga was probably the least strange thing about Oceania.
“Sometimes,” he said, and these were shameful words. He pushed them out. “Sometimes, it’s just that I feel that you don’t – that you still see me like, you know. The way you did. You understand, you’re not the first – you’re not the only one. I’m not saying that to make you feel guilty. But it’s just…the way you sometimes comment on it. Like it’s still a novelty to you. It makes me feel like you keep me around just becau–”
“Alright,” said Malfoy, and sat back on his heels. He capped the black stick and rummaged around in the bag again. When he remerged, it was with his long fingers curled around a red tube.
Malfoy rolls her eyes.
“Oh,” said Hermione, after a moment. “I wasn’t sure if you would. I know the owl service is probably somewhat non-existent there, so I put on a stamp just in case. It probably took longer than expected, but that’s why I wasn’t sure, so…” she trailed off. Harry lifted his head.
“Hey,” he said. “You can stay. It’s not you.”
Draco's cheeks get warm, and he squeezes down further into the narrow aisle as Harry chuckles behind him.
Draco laughed again. “Right.”
Harry rolled his eyes and shoved Malfoy’s arm, reaching for the next mat as he cackled.
“If I didn’t know better, I’d almost think you sounded disappointed.” Malfoy smirked around the edge of his white Russian, one arm pressed against the counter and the rest of his body slinking back. He took a sip, licking the white moisture off of his upper lip in one elegant movement.
Malfoy rolled his eyes.
Harry took a seat. He wasn’t sure what he had expected. A room filled with stuffed toys maybe, or lots of plants and educational posters. Instead, it looked mostly just like a regular office. There was one house plant in a corner, although it looked like it was dying.
Malfoy was painfully quiet. Then – “You never answered my question.”
you? Well, forgive my foolish inclinations, I simply cannot conceive how I construed
That was how Harry Potter found himself bouncing on his heels in the arrivals lounge of Glasgow airport with a popcorn Frappuccino in his hands. Half the cream had already melted.
“Jane,” he said casually, as if he was asking her to pass the salt. “Could you sit down for a moment love? It’d piss Mr. Bad Hair Day here off so bad.”
“No,” said Draco. “But they are all broken hearted.”
“Just curious.”
a sunflower. This was…not.
I’m in love with a crazy person, Draco realises suddenly, her heart catching desperately in her throat. I’m in love with someone clinically unstable.
“Sometimes I visit him,” Pansy continued. “Sometimes he visits me.”
“Oceania,” he said. “I wanted to apologise for the other day. I was...rude.”
It wasn’t that Harry hadn’t felt exposed sitting here at the table already in the previous conversation, but now it felt an awful lot like he was getting his skin peeled off. He said: “I think he’s quite a character.”
Malfoy’s eyes were very wide. His pulse was playing a little staccato in the thin soft skin just beneath his chin, and his cheeks looked like someone had crushed raspberries on them.
“So what’s the job?” he asked, after a few moments of silence. Pansy reached for her sake, swallowing it around her mouthful.
Charlie looked back up, froth somehow now on his forehead. “Right,” he said, “Yes, sorry. Excuse me, ma’am…” He turned to the girl behind the counter, who had totally been listening in on the entire conversation.
Then he smirked, that playful arrogance completely refreshing his features. Draco dropped his eyes to the hem of his t-shirt, just visible above the clasp of work robes. His pulse pushed forward in his throat. He was truly so done for.
“Why is there a ladybird on it? With eyelashes? How is that even related?”
“Draco. Yes.”
“It’ll be the same, but now there’ll be actual homeless people pissing.” Draco says, but let’s Harry pull him down to the riverside.
“Maybe.”
“Draco!” squealed Oceania. Her entire face had flushed an alarming shade of red, the kind that instinctively inspired warning bells in any warm-blooded mammal. Malfoy used this opportunity to get up and order another round.
“You’re doing that thing,” Harry murmured, standing up and going to check on the syrup.
“Nothing,” said Harry, giddy. “You’re just – funny.”
The shock of being understood hit him hard. He stared down at his tea cup, mute.
“Yes,” said Harry. “Just.”
“I hate having to reduce this to fucking oppression points,” spat Pansy. “But seeing as I’ve been depressed since I can remember and have commit two suicide attempts in recent history: yes, I do think I am.”
Harry looked up and raised an eyebrow at him. Malfoy’s eyes were doing that smirking thing. They seemed to always be doing that around Harry lately.
“Of course I have.”
Draco still sounded confused. “All dragons can be tamed.”
The phone rang.
1 more chapter!! Lemme know how you think it's going to end lol.
“I just got here.” He grinned at her. “You’ve done a fantastic job.”
Malfoy handed him the jacket. Soft material filled his hands. He stepped closer –
And then this sort of became his life. Without quite deciding to or realising it, Harry settled back down into a routine – and between yoga and lunches and people and gardening and afternoon walks and sleeping – Harry found himself endlessly distracted. He wasn’t sure if it was a good thing or not. Maybe this was what life was. Maybe this was the point of it.
Draco looked down at him. He was entirely rosy, fully dressed. The damp spot on his trousers had long stiffened, and the thought of that made Harry want to throw him back onto the sofa and have his way with him.
“Do you have sleeping leggings?’
“I’m sorry,” said Harry, “You’re right. I haven’t been looking at you like a full person. I haven’t respected you. I’m sorry for that.”
Oceania side-eyed him. “Unless you still want it?” she offered.
“Right,” Harry repeated. He stood up, deliberately trying to make his movements non-threatening. “Well. Thanks for everything. I’ve got everything I need now.”
“I love you Draco,” said Oceania.
Malfoy exhaled. He sounded close. “Harry,” he said, and it was strange, that
Draco just kept smiling at him. “Okay,” he said softly.
idea, it’s not like the sound of astringent laughter isn’t perfectly soothing to the defenceless soul –”
Everyone wanted to be known. Everyone wanted to be forgiven.
Potter doesn’t notice. When Draco looks up, she sees that her cheeks are slightly flushed, and her eyes are very bright.
His flat was one of those English-style ones that opened from the communal hallway straight down a set of unnecessarily but delightfully grandiose steps with the curly black railings into the pavement. People with Tesco shopping bags and children and dogs walked past him. There were white spots of gum pressed like dried flowers into the black tarmac. Weeds bloomed on either side. Cars roared past him, dragging behind them the noxious perfume of petrol.
He thought back to Scotland.
Draco feels her breath hitch and fall like a child’s – and she feels like a child, like the whole world is so much bigger than she is, and it’s all absurd and out of control – and then Potter presses her lips to Draco’s forehead and puckers them.
“I need you,” said Harry, and then he reached up and took Draco’s hand. Like it was the easiest thing, for him. To just – reach out, like that – and take Draco’s hand. Draco looked down at where their fingers overlapped, a paradox of shape and tone and sense, and knew why.
“Or,” he said a few moments later. “It won’t go away. Regardless. Unless I feel it now.”
“But, you know.” Oceania tipped her head to the side as one loop of wool proved to be especially stubborn. “I just thought it wasn’t an option. That, because I was a girl, and I’d only really seen girls with boys, that it didn’t count.”
By the time Harry had finished his third bao zi, the cafeteria had begun to fill out. Harry went to put his and Hayden’s dishes away, and when he came back, Charlie was there chatting to Hayden.
Harry took him to the Green Hotel. He was tired, and didn’t know where else to do it. Besides, Malfoy had asked him.
“Malfoy,” says Harry. “Are you gay?”
Draco’s hands squeezed around his waist, his fingertips pressing into the soft of Harry’s stomach. “For god’s sake,” he gasped. “Get some control, golden boy.”
For a moment, it was like the whole world was silent. All he could feel was the blue, but it wasn’t just his blue – it was the world’s blue, it was
Once he’d stolen some jeans as well, he walked the few metres over to the bathroom and dry-heaved over the toilet. Then he wiped his mouth, splashed his face, and headed back to his house. He couldn’t go back to sleep. He just sat there with his books, a cup of tea, Harry Potter’s clothes and smell and ghost all over him.
She taught crafts at a local college and had arranged for the students to do a takeover at an indie studio near where Harry lived. Harry walked there, the November night nipping at his nose and where his scarf didn’t quite cover the top of his throat. He had let his beard grow out further, mostly out of laziness, but he was grateful for it now as he walked.
“Mm.” Malfoy hummed mildly.
Harry looks at them.
Harry wanted to ask him if he was alright but couldn’t think of a way to that wouldn’t offend him. He settled for, “I don’t have to use all of the photos.”
Potter nods. “I like having tea with you.” she breathes. Her head almost seems to be swinging back and forth, slowly, a flag in the wind. “I like it lots.”
“What do you mean?” asked Malfoy.
He turned on his heel and began to walk purposefully away from the pen.
“It’s been alright,” he settled on, after a while. “I – I did some traveling.”
in front of us. One hand on the pole. The other hand on the elbow pad. Oh,
“Were truer words ever spoken?” agreed Oceania, and, satisfied with this, reached for the pink wool.
“Sorry, I – I didn’t realise.”
Malfoy curled his hand into a fist and rubbed it furiously against his forehead. When he brought it away, it left behind a red mark, slanted across his face.
Harry just smiles a little, despite herself, and leans against the doorframe. Malfoy is so small, she realises suddenly. Her presence is normally so vast, so liquid – filling up the container of their setting. Without her makeup, her dangerously straight hair, her fucking thongs – she becomes more real. Most touchable. More honest. Until now, Harry has only been fucking an idea.
“Historical how?” Hayden asked.
“Alright,” he said finally.
, thought Draco,
“Malfoy.”
“Do it because I want you to.”
The next morning, Draco gets out of bed, and goes straight to the kitchen. The tap is there. The pot is there. The kettle that hasn’t worked for a year is there.
“Dunno.” Harry’s hips were a heroic force. “Guess I’m just a light in the dark.” The words were offhand but Draco wasn’t quite so far gone that he missed the reference. He closed his eyes.
“This.” Harry gestured with a careless hand towards the room. “Don’t you…”
“No,” said Harry, “Maybe.”
Harry tries not to grin.
“Maybe that’s because, deep down,” Draco says after a moment, pulling on a pair of black tights, rolling them over her calf and thigh. “Deep, deep, down, you don’t think women are people as fully as men are.” She moves on to the other foot, flexing her ankle as she dips it into the filmy material.
“Do I need to change?” he asked.
This was even quieter. But when Draco looked up it felt very deliberate.
“Ronald,” said Hermione, but it was pretty soft, as far as reprimandings go. She had her chin in one hand, her work robe transfigured into a sleek blazer that was resting over the back of her chair. Harry liked to see her relax.
Malfoy grunts, burying her face into Harry’s neck.
Somehow this, of all the things Draco could have said, hit Harry the most directly. “You did?”
A visitor lured Luna away after that, asking questions about a tapestry woven into a branch on the other side of the room. Harry gave Malfoy a look.
Draco Malfoy kneeled down beside the bed, his hand still in Harry’s. The back of his hand was against his chest, and through his bones Draco could feel his heartbeat, like this:
This room was too small. It was going to close around him, and then nobody would ever find him.
“Hey,” he said when he was within hearing distance. Oceania offered a bowl of porridge to him. “No, I’m good thanks. Harry, can I talk to you for a second?”
“Oh Harry,” she said, and it came out fond. “It was always a bit inevitable, wasn’t it?”
“I’ve never been to church.” Harry admits quietly as they stand under the famous rose window, and Draco glances over at him.
“But why do you need to believe in anything,” says Harry. “When you already have so much control?”
Malfoy didn’t look away, but he looked like he wanted to. “It’s a stylistic choice.”
As if reading his mind, Malfoy said, “You do this a lot then.”
The journey wasn’t long. The international portkey department arranged him his own private portkey in the form of a fallen ice-cream cone behind a wizarding pub near the London Eye at four in the afternoon, and five minutes of stomach-bending magic, half an hour of paperwork, and a two-hour long coach journey later, he found himself outside Tengboche monastery.
“Listen,” he said a bit later to Charlie, as they were having lunch, “I feel like I need to confess something.”
“I know you love your friends,” he said to the carpet, “I also know that you can’t stand them.”
This was becoming a habit. Harry shouldn’t let it become a habit.
“Potter,” gasps Malfoy, digging her nails into her back and throwing her head back onto the mattress. She squeezes her eyes shut, her mouth stretched open. “Potter, Potter, Harry, fuck, Harry – ”
“How are Weasley and – Granger?”
Across him, Malfoy made a sound like he was getting stabbed. Harry stood up.
“I wanted to know if you wanted another lesson,” he clarified, keeping his voice light.
And did it matter, when he was leaving? It was true what he had said to Draco – that none of this had been real, not really. Here, he had been avoiding life. Time was a thing that passed him by, experience was something that happened to him. He had been trying to escape his life – not live it, not really.
Harry thought about the silence he’d felt. About how the blue had expanded, and how when it had retreated, it had left behind a bridge between the two of them.
“I’m sorry,” said Malfoy after a moment. He sounded slightly more sober. A hand pressed onto Harry’s forearm, the thumb beginning to draw circles over the fabric.
The field was actually quite pretty. And the cows were too far away to be shifty and generally anxious. Far away, the sun was brazen, a brilliant thing.
“Hermione got me them a couple birthdays ago. I went through a space phase.”
“Would you like some more?” she asked, when they’d finished that pot.
Malfoy squinted at him. “Do you think he’s too sober?” he stage-whispered to Oceania.
“Harry,” he said, after a long moment, “Draco’s real.”
“Harry,” said Tom, when Harry came into the temple. “It’s nice to see you.”
“Oh, right.” said Harry, “That makes sense.”
She shuffles closer to Draco and cups her cheek, drawing her in for a kiss. Draco opens her mouth obligingly – obliging it all. Harry’s tongue is sour and there is a white film on the inside of her lips. Draco opens her mouth more.
“That’s right.” Bolson was already strolling back down the hallway in the manner of someone who actually had meaningful obligations to undertake. “He’s expecting us at ten.”
It was sickening.
“Great,” said Harry, thinking of the spectacularly amiable mermaids in the Great Lake at Hogwarts. He looked up and down the dragon and it practically glared at him.
“I think that you don’t quite know me either,” said Malfoy, the light overhead shifting from blue into red, and then he got up and ordered another milkshake.
Draco tucked his chin into Harry’s shoulder again. For some reason, Harry hadn’t quite recognised how intimate the action was the first time. “Yes,” he said. “I just wanted to hear you say it.”
He let his legs fall into a basket and straightened his back. Rested his hands on his knees and closed his eyes. Meditation posture.
“I’ve never seen your house before,” Harry said, almost cheerfully. “I don’t even know where you live.”
“We’re just looking.” Malfoy put the other foot over the threshold and turned around, so that Harry almost walked into him. It was fortunate that he didn’t, since Malfoy’s bra was entirely adorned with one-inch spikes.
“Thanks,” said Oceania, and then nodded at him, “You should put that away. Normally Draco does it, but he’s annoyed with you.”
“I’m not sure,” said Harry, equally carefully. He didn’t look away. Malfoy almost seemed to sway, closer. He gaze was meeting Harry’s, eye for eye.
“That’s all he said?”
“Ah,” said Oceania, and turned to her drawer only to take out another mesh shirt. This one was neon purple.
He imagined them kissing. It was strange, stranger than anything else he had encountered since coming to this place.
“Some risks must be taken,” Malfoy said, sighing, and then moved towards the door. When Harry looked up, his smirk was only half a smirk, but at least it was there. One hand was clutched around the handle.
People started to come out of the automatic doors twenty minutes later. Having already had three existential crises’, Harry had calmed down enough to take a seat, but now he jumped back up. All the cream had melted. The first three people were not Draco Malfoy. The next five weren’t either. Then another two came out, and then it was Draco Malfoy.
“Why,” he said, and his voice was low. “Harry, you
There. From his peripheral vision, he watched a finger on Malfoy’s right hand jump.  One was seated on his knee, and the other was steadied on the ground. Harry wondered why it was people were only allowed to touch when they hurt.
“That’s the Mani Rilwu,” Draco said into Harry’s ear as a Monk pressed something into his hand. “The sacred pill. And that’s the Tshereel. The pill for a long life. Are you alright?”
“I thought you’d forgotten,” Draco said eventually. He said it softly, and if Harry closed his eyes now, it would feel like the words were coming from inside his own mind.
(See the end of the chapter for
“To think,” Harry echoed. “Tell me, how do you know that word again?”
“I…” said Harry, and then cleared his throat. “That was a long time ago.”
He swallowed again, and closed his eyes. In the darkness, he felt the pain under his hip, and tried to let go. There was something else there, under the stretching sensation, but he couldn’t surface it. He inhaled.
Oceania produced a spoon from her hair and reached for Hayden’s tray. They scowled and moved the tray a few inches away. There was a brief but fearsome spoon fight, apple sauce flying through the air like splatters of blood, which ended with Oceania apparently earning victorious access to the tray.
“What are
“I just –“ she tries to say, and then it comes tumbling out. “Don’t go.”
“Harry?” Harry turned to find Hayden resting their chin in the folded basket of their hands, watching him.
He went to open the door. He felt Draco’s eyes on him as he fingers fumbled over the keys.
“What are you doing about it?” she asked, matter-of-fact.
“I thought you were already a father to all the dragons,” said Harry, grinning. “And a tamer to them.”
“Harry,” said Oceania. “Why have you put the butter on its side?”
“Draco,” Harry began again, feeling in his tone. Draco looked at the wall. It was coming. He was going to let it come. “I…”
And again. Harry was sick of carefulness.
Harry drops his hand and Draco frowns.
Then he took a shower. By the time he was done, his tea was the perfect temperature. Maybe a bit cold. Nothing was perfect. He liked to read now.
“Don’t look like that. I’m serious. We could even go out, if you like.”
“Good morning,” said Malfoy, “Did you want something?”
He could feel Malfoy’s eyes venturing from his shoulder back to his face.
“It’s okay if you get distracted,” said Tom, and his mind lurched back into the temple. “It’s normal. Let your thoughts pass over you, like clouds. Don’t fight them. Just observe them, and let them move on. You don’t have to get involved.”
Malfoy raises a brow as she smokes a cigarette, looking over at Harry. She looks like she’s about to make a cutting comment, then decides against it for once. She exhales a greyed breath slowly.
Charlie rested his hand over Harry’s. “You’re going to be okay.” His voice had dropped to a soothing bass. “Just dandy.”
ham.” Draco sighs, and ties off the bagful of apples before plopping it in the trolley.
And sometimes he thought that perhaps love was just more than anything anyone had ever prepared him for.
Harry didn’t trust himself to answer. “Do you take card?”
Harry’s heart thudded. “What are the rest of you doing?”
Harry breathed in quickly. “In my head,” he said, and felt his voice begin to crack again, humiliatingly. How many times was he going to have to cry about this?
Harry had never heard anyone who sounded so entirely tired of life.
“I won’t, I won’t,” Oceania promised, wiping at the corners of her eyes. “But oh my god. Wow.
He turned around and froze when he caught sight of Harry.
“Just tell me, Malfoy.”
“I just wanted to say,” he began, and then closed his eyes briefly as if wrestling with himself. Then, eyes still closed, he turned around and stood up on the chair.
“Well,” Draco said after a moment, clearing his throat. “Since you’re here, we might as well do some research.”
Harry looked at him. He heard the rain, and he smelt the sweetness of melting.
“Welcome to the Green Hotel, how may I help you?”
Malfoy barked out a surprised laugh. “Ever seen Yuri on Ice?”
“Malfoy,” says Harry, frowning over at her ex-enemy. They’re in a pub – the Elf’s Ears – and Malfoy draws her body across the bar to sip her cocktail. She curves her slender back with the clear intent of showing off her figure in that way she does, and when she makes eye contact with Harry, her face is carefully blank.
“A bit,” Harry admitted. “But it didn’t seem that weird.” He paused. “Nothing in comparison to how it felt to see you in your leggings for the first time.”
He didn’t feel tired anymore. The silence was in the room was huge, in a way that it usually wasn’t to Harry. He could feel pinkness pricking in his cheeks. He opened his mouth and closed it, then stood up.
The sound of Oceania groaning torturously broke through. Malfoy stepped back, and his face cleared. “Ah,” he said, looking in the direction of the bathroom. “There she is.” Then he looked in Harry’s general direction and stepped back again. He frowned, a little helplessly.
“You shouldn’t,” said Luna, and she sounded genuinely regretful. “I’m in the middle of gardening.”
After visiting another museum with Monet paintings and stuffing themselves with Tarte Flambée, Coq au Vin, and Kouign-amann, all washed down with red wine, Draco is in high spirits.
Harry hadn’t realised he was still holding onto Malfoy’s elbow. He let go of it and then stepped back, taking in all of him.
Harry smirked. He met Malfoy’s dark eyes and looked away again. “I suppose you can always spell your way out.”
Harry nodded. After a moment, he said, “I can help you with the central heating, if you like.”
In the middle of the square of soil, a long pink rose was growing. Harry turned and walked into the bedroom, where he woke up.
“Draco.”
expression closing and him standing up was almost non-existent.
? Just like that?”
“Everyone has problems,” Malfoy spat. “Doesn’t mean you just run away, like some kind of
“Right here?” he looked around. “With Malfoy watching?”
She pushes Draco back onto the ground, gently, like she’s handling a doll, and Draco is all loose, and melted, and liquid in Harry’s hands. Harry lays her down, and kisses her cheeks, her stupidly angular brows, her cupid’s bow, her chin, her nose. She kisses her neck – light, fluttery, the kind of kiss a mother feathers over her baby’s chubby arms as she rocks it to sleep – she kisses her sternum, her breasts, her shoulders, and her stomach. She runs a hand again through all that icy hair, and kisses her eyelids, and down, and down, and down, until Draco’s legs curl around Harry’s head and her body lifts and she gasps a little, and makes these soft littles mewls, these desperate little “oh, oh, oh” s, and until her voice goes dry as she buries her fingers into Harry’s hair and taps them against the nape of her neck, and climaxes with a fragmented moan that seems to keep on going, keep on stretching out, until her body goes slump again, and Harry is back to kissing her thighs and the tips of her hipbones.
The Mona Lisa isn’t all it’s cut out to be. Harry wraps a comforting arm around Draco as they both watch on over the crowd of Chinese tourists, all donned in yellow hats and posing for photos.
“You know.” Malfoy seemed to realise this and took his hand back. “The…meditating.”
“Miss this,” muttered Harry, and stuck up his middle finger.
Malfoy dipped his head, dropping his face lower. His mouth hesitated above the curve of Harry’s neck, hot air flooding his senses, and then slowly, went down to mouth at it. Harry felt the warmth pulsating in his chest. His hand found Malfoy’s on his stomach, and held on.
Harry moans as Malfoy’s fingers find their way into her jeans, shoving roughly past the crotch of her pants, kneading the pad of her thumb into her clit, curling those long, cold fingertips so deep inside her she can barely breathe. She can barely breathe, and Malfoy crowds her back against the wall this time, a hand on her hip, smirking down at Harry. She leans in, as if for a kiss, and then bites Harry’s lip, tearing the skin, causing Harry to cry out and arch her back and for blood to drip down her chin and onto her chest. Malfoy moans, as if eating something delicious, and hikes Harry up so that her legs wrap around her waist, ankles crossed at her back. She kneads Harry’s ass with that hand, and Harry can tell she’s using the hand that’s working her as leverage too, because she’s pressing against the roof of her so hard that her manicured nails are digging in, digging right in and still curling and uncurling, and fuck, it’s uncomfortable, it
He felt Malfoy look to the floor. Felt his eyes rummage through the dirty laundry and dusty carpet and ambiguous litter, until he found it. Harry felt the exact moment he found it. He felt it in his bones.
Before, the stillness had only contributed to the sensation of suffocation. It didn’t seem to bother him the same way anymore. He just noticed.
Malfoy pressed his lips together. “Yes, well. How was I supposed to know of your perverted tendencies?”
“Oh,” he said, as his neck was engulfed in pink ringlets. “Thank you.”
Oceania smiled, then patted his leg the way most people patted the heads of particularly cute toddlers. “I know,” she said, “But I’m glad you do too, Harry.”
“No.” Harry tilted his head to the side. “Not today.”
“Oh,” said Harry, “…kay.”
Ron nodded. They all drank their beer for a bit.
“And, uh…” Bolson gnawed on the toothpick in thought. “Ask him why he has to dress up as a woman.”
There was nothing to argue there. Bowling had always sounded pretty dull to him as a child, but he had seen this lot turn eating lunch into a sport, so he was prepared for quite a few outcomes, all of which were weird and magical and mildly uncomfortable.
“Yes,” said Harry, feeling a bit giddy about it. “But I hadn’t realised until just now.”
“You look beautiful,” Oceania continued, as on course as ever. “I might kiss you.”
“Or whenever we remember,” Hayden had interjected.
Malfoy’s eyes glinted. “My dragon isn’t going to get its arm torn off in my absence.”
Harry made the mistake of looking up then, and accidentally locked eyes with Tom, who raised his eyebrows at him. Harry felt the flush run all down his face and under his shirt too. It was a disaster.
Malfoy laughed, a freeing sound, and turned his attention to where Oceania was busy unpacking the bags. He frowned.
“What do you think of it?” asked Draco, a little too precisely.
“It’s afternoon, Blaise,” Luna reminded him politely.
“That’s okay, Harry,” he said, as patient as ever.
“Hello, Harry.” She blinked warmly at him and then led him through to the kitchen without a further word.
“Okay –”
“Which one?” Oceania was busy rummaging through her drawers, presumably for a top, although you never knew with her.
Draco doesn’t expect Potter to come back the next day, but come back she does, with a different set of robes. These ones have red piping all down the sides.
“I tried. To do what you said to do. To be like what you said to be.”
When he was done, he leaned back against the edge of the counter the way he had when he first arrived, the cup of coffee sitting beside him. He stared down at the wood panels.
“What are you thinking?” asked Harry.
He blinked, his hand falling back to his face. He hadn’t shaved this morning.
“Will you teach me?”
Malfoy, Harry realised, was finally taking the opportunity to kill him. He sighed, and began to walk over.
They took a taxi back instead of apparating, partly because it was so busy and partly because Oceania insisted on doing things the muggle way.
“I don’t know,” said Harry, quite honestly. “I don’t even know why he was so mad.”
He stepped out into the black street, a cream dot in the middle of it all, and Harry followed.
“Pansy, darling,” he said smoothly as he passed her a drink and slid back into his seat in one graceful move. “Tell me how’ve you been, why don’t you? How’s the job, how’s the reading?”
Get into the body. It didn’t make sense, but it seemed to interact with something instinctual inside of Harry. He almost didn’t want it to.
“It isn’t. Maybe I mis-phrased. I suppose I meant that –” Malfoy searched for the word, licking his lips. “That I wasn’t very good at being…honest, with myself. When I was younger.”
“Mm,” said Luna. “Well, I’ll give you her address. Just in case.”
was naked.
Malfoy looked up from the fishnets he’d been pretending to study and gave him a long, heated look that travelled from his toes to the tips of his hair.
“I don’t
Harry squinted. If he hadn’t been otherwise informed, he wouldn’t have thought there was a dolphin present at all. A long elephant leg, maybe. But not a dolphin.
Harry paused, his finger trailing along the surface of the nearest table. “Malfoy?” he said.
Harry bit his lip. He wished that he hadn’t woken up uncomfortable this morning.
“I’ve never heard you say that word before.” Harry sat down in his letter-reading corner, breathless.
but sadness doesn’t have a colour, or even a texture. Sadness just has a space inside you – a reserved table, a booked hotel room – and you can tidy things up as much as possible, but it is coming, it is coming down, picking its way amongst the stone slabs – and it will make you a guest in your own home.
“Who decided to make them pink?” Hayden asked through a mouthful of cookie. Kitchen staff had unceremoniously decided to take a day off, and so they had all resorted to eating cookies for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Even Charlie, who had essentially fathered them at this point, did not know how to cook.
He looked up. Pansy was looking straight at him with her dark eyes. He said, “yes?”
“Harry, the last gay bar I went to had a larger than life papier-mâché Jesus. We’ll be fine.”
The blue was a vivid, tangible thing inside of him. It rose and swelled, expanding to push past his ribcage, climbing the hollow of his throat. It was water-logging him. It wasn’t real, but he could still see it, as if with another sense inside of him – see the deepening, bleeding blue.
Draco Malfoy stepped out of the woods.
“Surely,” said Harry, as they got out the taxi and stepped back into the bustling grey noise of the West End at night, “there is nothing wrong with pen-paling.”
Oh, Lord. At least, Draco supposed dully, he had given him time to put down his coffee. It was more than he could have suspected.
“As long as you can imagine,” Draco whispered, and Harry came.
said the busty woman, gripping the handle of the whip. She had short hair gelled back and tall, aristocratic features.
“I don’t think I love him,” said Harry, and he had to say the words very carefully, because otherwise they might destroy him. “But I was talking to…my counsellor about it. And I realised…he made me feel free.”
“It’s not in a bad way.”
Harry nodded. He took in a breath, and stopped running. Jane was right there. The blue rose, crashing into him, and it was the biggest thing he’d ever felt.
Harry made himself take a few steps back. He picked up the camera and fiddled with the settings until he’d had a moment to collect himself. He aimed.
“I’m sorry,” said Harry. It didn’t take a psychotherapist to realise that Hayden was a pretty private person. “You and Oceania, you’re close?”
Malfoy pursed his lips. “No. No I do.”
For a moment he couldn’t remember the conversation, or the voice that had said the words. Then it came back, but the words themselves reformed again in Harry’s mind, this time with more meaning than before.
“Nothing,” said Harry. He dropped his eyes, only to find that although he could avoid the disapproving gaze of Charlie, he could not avoid the disapproving gaze of the many, many fluffy bathrobe dragons.
When he opened them, the girl with the black hair was back and she was unrolling a third yoga mat.
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“Hello,” she said to him, and the way she said it somehow managed to make it sound both lascivious and chastising.
“Urm,” said Harry. “Alright.” He then abruptly remembered that this was the place where he was supposed to actually open up about his feelings. “Urm…”
It was Luna’s exhibition on Friday.
Ron blinked. He opened his mouth, and then he closed it. After a few moments of this, all he said was: “Well, how was it mate?”
The bartender was coming over. He had a long beard and an intimidating walk. When he got to their table he sat a beer down and looked up at Malfoy, one hand on his hip.
Hayden raised their brows. They were sitting on the opposite wall, next to Oceania, who was practising her splits.
Malfoy blinked, and then pressed his lips together. His hand was very still under Harry’s. “I’m trying,” he whispered.
“Look at her,” said Oceania. Her voice was quite soft. “She’s right here.”
Harry blinked. “I don’t know how to,” he told him.
“I guessed it was because of the war,” they said, and then Harry looked down. A flower in his tea slowly bobbed over.
But they were beautiful. They were so beautiful. Even up close – especially up close. Harry hadn’t realised it would be like this, but he felt the relief of it so deeply it was like something was unlatched. He leaned back again.
Malfoy was never going to let him live it down.
Harry reached for his shirt and tugged it off, then handed it to Malfoy.
The world stopped with him. The was how it was, with Harry. Draco had gotten used to that a long time ago, too.
Malfoy was looking at Mayo with a complicated expression.
Harry stared at him. He blinked hard, several times. “I’m not getting drinks with you,” he managed after several moments, successfully keeping most of the astoundment out of his voice.
son of a bitch.”.”
“No.” she says.
She was just a dragon. But she was right here, under his palm, and she was looking at him.
“Urm,” says Harry. “Not really?”
As it happened, Charlie was standing underneath the impressive archway. He came over and took some of the coloured sand bags out of Harry and Hayden’s arms, smiling brightly at Harry.
“Is it?” Harry wondered aloud. “Is it a bad thing?”
Harry slid off the stool and crouched over to pick up as Malfoy and Oceania came jogging over. They were both pink and flushed happy, like school children in a playground.
“Christ.”
Pansy continued to level him a very even look. She replied, equally deliberate, “And have you ever tried listening?”
“Harry,” said Draco, giving him a level look over his morning tea. “Don’t be so fucking ignorant.”
“Just let how you feel decide,” said Tom. “Now, close your eyes.”
He wasn’t sure what it was exactly, or where it had come from. He just knew that it had been there, inside of him, and he supposed that it could still very well be there under the surface.
It goes on and on and on, the hot run down of saltwater drying on her face, the endless twisting of her body, the struggle to open her eyes and close them – and it goes on, like some kind of unspoken crucio, that grabs her by the neck and whispers into her ear that this
“Why,” he said, layering a very thin sheer of indignation on top. “But I only have sweet things to say.”
, during broad daylight – it’s only when she’s with Malfoy that all that fight comes out, that all that want suffocates her most deliciously. There is nothing else like it. Sometime, she’ll still think about men, about broad shoulders and that V above the waistband, about Adam’s apples and stubble – and it’s all nice, it’s all very nice, but it doesn’t get her crazy with it. It’s not the same as it is with women. It’s like the breadsticks before the meal. Like the appetiser instead of desert.
“Harry,” she said. “Come here.”
“Urm,” said Harry, “It’s…going?”
“You are?” He couldn’t keep the surprise out of his voice.
Harry frowned. “You don’t even know anything yet.”
“Malfoy.”
Someone inhaled sharply behind them. They both turned to look.
Potter laughs, and it’s a round, rich sound. “Tell me why.” she demands.
“Gerard the Fourth,” Charlie supplied.
“So, Harry,” said Gao, leaning comfortably into the side of her wheelie chair. “How are you doing?”
Harry Potter breathed in and out. He was with himself. And he was beginning to understand what he needed now.
Draco blinked the sunlight out of his eyes. Then he looked around at the green, at the vastness of it, like it would never end here, even though he knew it must.
“Malfoy,” says Harry. “You don’t call me Harry.”
“I saved you,” he said, and yes, this had happened before, it had happened before, it was happening.
It was approaching ten o’clock. Harry blew air out of his nose and got up.
Did Malfoy notice? It was hard to say, with the room so dark and the space so crowed. Everything was hot, lurid, willing. Harry didn’t so much as do things as much as think about them. He wished he hadn’t had that last drink. He wished he’d had more drinks.
“Mate, we kind of know.”
Hayden was filling the cups up with water. Then they untucked their wand from their trousers and pointed it at the cups. Sparks flew and steam began to slowly swirl up towards the ceiling.
Harry leaned towards him. “Do you want to clean my glasses?” he asked in what he hoped what was a semi-endearing tone. Even without his vision, he could tell that Draco had gone all pointy.
“What?” said Malfoy. “Are you pregnant with Satan himself?”
When he came back out, he stood there with the plate and contemplated his options. Then he spotted Draco in the distance.
“Hmm, I don’t know.” He didn’t look up from where he was dragging a stock photo of a man eating a burger around on an empty word document. “You can check my bag if you want.”
When he opened his eyes, it was like waking up. It wasn’t dark anymore. The world was transformed. Morning was inevitable.
He could feel Malfoy’s breath on the shell of his ear. Heard him swallow. He asked, “Do you want to be?”
Blue. Draco can close her eyes and recall the exact shade of it that is supposed to be sadness – she remembers all sorts of colours – but she’d forgotten about blue, and how she’d stepped around it, all these years, dancing around puddles of navy in her tiptoes, always thinking that this was some sort of survival – to stay on your feet, soles to the ground, never letting yourself drown –
“Rules make things work,” he said, “They make things…make sense.”
“Get in some good shots. I want to see frilly knickers, whips, that sort of thing. We want to dig into the dirt.”
Oceania wriggled her eyebrows. Harry was impressed. “No,” she said eventually. “Most people are drawn to similarity, as far as I can see.”
, to tame
“I’m sorry,” he muttered. Why did he have so little control?
“You don’t have to bloody answer if you don’t want to, Merlin.”
“You probably know,” Draco was saying. His mouth was so pink against the pale of his skin. His lashes fluttered as he spoke. “You probably know. But just in case, I wanted to tell you…I’m quite in love with you.”
“Just so that I can brag to Draco about it,” she explained once they were in the taxi. The city rushed by, scattered light darting through the black tinted windows. “Because of his no-magic diet, of course.”
He didn’t understand what was wrong with him. The war was over – and even so, it didn’t feel like anything had felt like during the war. He had felt bad things, of course he had – but nothing he had ever felt before had gotten into his bones like this. This went beyond feeling. He hadn’t known that there were so many parts of him available to hurt.
Draco looked up. His eyes were very serious. “No,” he said. “I don’t.”
“Jesus fuck,” muttered Harry. He felt Draco sway again, still laughing, and swore again. He shifted to try and catch him as he toppled down.
“No.”
Draco Malfoy has lived in a cottage for the past seven years.
“Charlie is the token straight.”
“Yes,” he said softly. “It was nice that you did.”
“What are these?”
Harry looked back up, startled. “What?” he asked. “Why?”
Oceania sent them a quick glare. “That’s the white gaze talking,” she said sternly, and then got back to the whispering.
All that skin was so pale. Harry looked, and then looked away when Malfoy bent over to reach for the mesh. Oceania met his eyes and wriggled her brows.
He leaned across the table and cut the crust down the middle, letting the steam billow out. Malfoy didn’t stop him. His eyes were big and bright through the cloud of steam.
“Who wants to go first?” he asked when he came back with the drinks.
When he stepped back into the bedroom, Malfoy took one look at him and collapsed into a pillow. He was giggling so hard the mattress shook.
“K,” he said. “Urm. Buh-bye.”
“If you want, you can bring your attention to your third eye chakra,” said Tom. “The space between your brows.”
“I don’t blame you,” said Malfoy. When he smirked, dainty half-moon lines appeared at the left side of his face. “Dragons are pretty scary.”
“No,” said Harry, nonsensically. He felt very aware that he was topless. He tried to cover his torso with his arms without making it look like he was trying to. “Did you need something?”
Yeahh, so this is like, three weeks late or something? Who's surprised
“It sounds like a fun time, is what it sounds,” said Oceania. She rubbed her hand against Malfoy’s shoulder. “You in?”
“I’m not taking your job seriously?” Malfoy was still sitting down, nearly gutting himself with incredulousness. “Do you actually hear yourself when you talk?”
self.” says Harry, and lifts a brow.  Draco looks up and licks his lips.
“No,” said Draco crossly. Harry had to bite back a laugh.
“I know,” said Harry, “I – I know.”
“I know that. I just – I’ve been busy.”
Harry and Draco sat on separate sofas.
The lasagnes arrived.
“Alllright,” said Charlie, his eyes darting between the two of them as he interrupted their glaring. “Maybe we should, uhh, go over, you know. What actually has been a-happening.”
“How’ve you been?” she asked, the words sounding significantly more voluptuousness than they would in virtually any other scenario.
She’s rounder than Malfoy, and shorter – but Malfoy doesn’t seem to ever mind. Harry knows she’s reasonably attractive – she has a good body, and if killing the Dark Lord isn’t a turn on for most she doesn’t know what is – but Malfoy looks like a supermodel, and holds herself like one too. Also, A-class tits.
