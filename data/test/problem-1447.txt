Harry was struck with a moment of, well, he wasn’t sure what to call it, sadness? Pain? Empathy? He really didn’t know what to call it, he just knew that something in his gut had told him that whatever Malfoy was going through, he needed to help. “Drink?” Harry said lightly, still watching Malfoy as he massaged his head.
“Ted?” Draco looked at him curiously. He didn’t think Harry was into blokes before. “Is that why you said I had to be gone by 5? Your boyfriend coming home Potter?” Draco felt his cheeks flush, a bit embarrassed now, he knew he was intruding on Harry’s life, but he didn’t realize how much.
“Yes, but I get called many things. My Gran calls me Edward when I’m in trouble, daddy calls me Ted, kiddo, buddy, and a buncha other stuff.” He was twisting his fingers in his hands as he looked up and moved from side to side as if he was trying to think of all the names in his head. “But you can call me Teddy or Ted. I really don’t like Edward. And only daddy calls me kiddo and buddy.” He looked back at Draco and smiled brightly.
Draco looked up at Potter for help but all he got was a shrug from the man across the table and he sighed as he looked back at the very curious Teddy next to him. “Well, your father and I weren’t very good friends back in school, so we didn’t call each other by our first names.” Draco said, hoping this would appease the child.
The person next to Harry had been waiting for a few minutes without the bartender, whose name Harry learned was Bert, serving them. Harry made eye contact with Bert and nodded behind him. Bert looked around Harry and saw them sitting there without a drink. Bert walked over and Harry had turned, about to ask for another round for himself and Eric, when the person next to him had jumped out of their seat and took off out of the bar. Bert was calling after them and Harry turned around to get a look at the person.
Harry nodded and made his way over to the kitchen and poured a glass of whiskey, he looked at the glass and then over to Malfoy and then poured a little more. He walked back into the sitting room and held the glass out to Malfoy. Malfoy glanced up, took the glass from Harry and drank half of it in one gulp. Harry sat back on the couch and looked at Malfoy once more. He noticed that the platinum blonde hair that was always so neat and tidy now looked disheveled, and it had grown out significantly that reflected what harry remembered of Lucius Malfoy. His eyes had dark circles underneath them as if he hadn’t slept in days, maybe weeks. His sharp features looked gaunter than Harry believed were possible for a Malfoy and his whole demeanor just seemed… sad.
Harry walked back into the sitting room and handed the cup to Malfoy. They sat in silence for a moment before words were finally spoken, and to Harry’s surprise, it was Malfoy.
“That’s a good one.” Weasley smiled. “Nah, she kept Granger, it's what she’s been known as at the Ministry for years and we didn’t want to have to change it all up when we got married. Mum wasn’t all too comfortable with it when we told her but she respected it enough when Dad came in and told her that it would be easier for her career if she just kept her name.” He smiled at Granger and gave her a light kiss on the cheek, which made her blush the same shade as Mrs. Weasley earlier.
It was seven in the morning. Last night, after the initial rush of euphoria had faded, Harry and Draco agreed that it was time to speak to McGonagall about the flowers. They planned to report the broom failure, as well as share everything they had discovered. And so, despite their
Weasley coughed loudly, shattering the heated moment. If Draco had his wand, he might have hexed the bastard.
There was an awkward silence, and Harry could sense the divide between them widening once more. They’d been building bridges these last few weeks, but their past had dug that chasm deep, and some days Harry wasn’t sure they could make it across without falling. There was unfinished business between them, and so many things left unsaid.
At some point in the conversation, Harry heard swift footsteps and turned to find that Draco had abruptly left the room. Harry’s chest tightened, as if all the air in the vicinity had trailed after Draco. Shifting from foot to foot, Harry tugged at his collar and somehow managed to kept his eyes on Tahlyn.
“But I will promise you,” Harry went on solemnly, “that if we ever grow apart, it won’t be because of the past. It won’t be because of who we were or what we did during the war.”
Harry blushed and stepped back, dropping his hand from Draco’s shoulder. Draco felt a flash of guilt for worrying him.
“No, Harry,” Draco said firmly, even as he threaded their fingers together. “I know what you’re going to say. You are not entirely wrong, but you’re not right either. The Malfoys earned the reputation we hold, and I refuse to exploit children to fix that.”
“You were talking to Luna?” Harry asked, feeling slightly dazed. He was having a hard time keeping up with the conversation. Craning his neck up at Malfoy felt awkward, and he longed to take Malfoy’s hand, to soothe and reassure him.
They filled the clearing with whispers and slick skin and love, and by the time they left it behind, meandering hand in hand through the forest, Harry no longer thought of it as the place where he had died, but rather as the place where he had come back to life.
“Well, the dessert could use some adjustments,” Draco said, frowning slightly, “but I’m glad you enjoyed it.”
he said haltingly. He was thinking it through as he spoke. “Your blood gave them enough to save you. The blood tie in the potion gave them enough to shield our magic… to destroy the hooks, they must need something more from us.”
Growing up at the Dursleys, the kitchen had been a place of taunts and reprimands, of hunger and hate-filled stares. He was tolerated there, but never welcome, treated like a servant when he wasn’t simply banished from sight.
Harry released Draco’s lips, mouthing messy kisses along his jawline. “Did you cushion the ground for me?” he panted.
Eyes squeezed shut, muscles clenched, mouth a firm, uninviting line, Draco steeled himself as if Harry’s kiss were a blade, one so thin and so sharp that you didn’t feel it at first, not until it twisted inside you, promising death.
And perhaps it had been that pride that spurred Draco on, a benign Hinkypunk luring Draco into experimenting further, its lantern the glowing thought of pleasing Maeve with a biscuit recipe of his own invention.
Undeterred, Malfoy continued. “It’s getting worse. It’s always small things, but they’re worrisome. Blaise and Pansy have been – forgetful, distracted. And spells have been going wrong. Have you noticed anything like that?”
Draco was sprawled on his back, wearing tight green boxers and a long-sleeved white t-shirt. His head was propped on pillows so he could read, but he had dropped the book ages ago. He seemed to be studying the glass flower, which still rested at the center of the windowsill and appeared to be moving independently of the breeze.
It should have been overwhelming, yet somehow wasn’t. The slats of the trellis were spaced widely enough to reveal swathes of the open sky, dappled shadows shifted merrily across the ground, vines swayed in a perpetual breeze. It all gave the garden an airy feel, providing a sense of motion that brought the decadent space to life.
“Sometimes,” Harry admitted, looking out across the clearing. “Not as often as I used to. Not when I remind myself I don’t have to be an auror.” He turned his head then and met Draco’s gaze. “Not when I’m with you.”
) thirst for information, exhaustion weighed on him again at the prospect of trying to explain it all. He scrubbed a hand over his tired eyes and tried to focus.
By the time he reached his own flat, Draco was soaked through and shivering. He stood in the entryway, wet hair dripping into his eyes, and fastidiously removed his shoes.
“Yeah, you tried to tell me that when you left. I didn’t understand then, but I get it now.” Harry scrubbed a hand through his hair, resisting the urge to apologize again. “And Blaise?” he asked instead. “Is he, er – what you were looking for?”
Harry’s lips quivered as he fought to tamp down his grin. He sidled over to Draco and took his hand. “Why would I want to murder you?” he murmured, trailing his lips lightly over Draco’s neck.
Not deigning that with a response, Draco pointed over his shoulder at a slightly crooked shelf that hung above the table. He wrestled the plastic coating off the bread and began to dip slices of it into the egg mixture.
When he finished, Harry tucked Draco’s hair behind his ear and asked, “Will you come to lunch with me?”
He stepped cautiously into the room, closing the door behind him. Malfoy had retreated to the far corner. He scrawled a few lines onto a stray bit of parchment and then waved his hand over it. The note folded itself up and disappeared noiselessly. Malfoy turned his attention back to several bubbling cauldrons.
Draco glanced sideways at Harry, something between startlement and amusement in the slant of his mouth. Shoving his hands into his pockets, Harry scuffed a trainer over the doormat sheepishly. He hadn’t expected Molly to embarrass him quite so early in the day, but still, it wasn’t a terrible feeling.
For the first time, Draco did not flush with pleasure at Harry complimenting his cooking. He just watched Harry with an unreadable expression in his eyes. When Harry finished eating, Draco tried to hand him his own untouched portion.
Harry swallowed hard and opened his eyes. He tenderly stroked a hand through Draco’s hair and waited.
An expression of hurt crossed Malfoy’s face, as if Harry had betrayed him. “That’s not true! There’s something strange about them. I know you’ve felt that too.” Malfoy’s tone was desperate now, begging Harry to understand.
They were walking along a stone corridor near the Potions classroom. When Harry had bypassed the Great Hall a few minutes earlier, mind still reeling with the implications of McGonagall’s parting words, Draco had followed him without complaint.
“Fuck,” he whispered, teeth chattering as he hopped out of the shower, determined to fetch a new shampoo and get this over with as quickly as humanly possible.
“Do you think it’s because I didn’t go into Auror training?” Harry tugged at the collar of his t-shirt, then dropped his hand back to his lap. “Or – or because I didn’t sit for my NEWTs?”
It was past time she got out of Harry Potter’s bed, and maybe, with a little of the right kind of luck, she could get flesh and blood Draco Malfoy into it.
The pub was filling up now, as the afternoon waned, the bar crowded with people grabbing a pint before heading home from work. Shouts of greeting and raucous laughter bounced from wall to wall. The chaos warmed Harry; it seemed to whirl around them without intruding, insulating rather than puncturing the cozy glow of being ensconced in a corner with Draco.
“Yeah?” Harry brightened. “Maybe you could stay then? Hermione’s had a work meeting cancelled, so she’s going to stop in. I figured I’d ask her about –” he gestured vaguely between them – “all this.”
Was spontaneous, accidental apparition a thing? Harry had been working up the courage to ask Hermione.
With a growl of frustration, Harry rolled onto his stomach and buried his head in the pillows to block the light. He rutted against the mattress, but it was so far from what he really wanted that all he could feel was an odd hollowness in the pit of his stomach. He whined pathetically and flopped over again, returning to lying on his back.
“I thought so, too,” Harry said. He rubbed a socked foot against Draco’s. “You didn’t want to help run it?”
The words tripped Harry up, quite literally – he stumbled on the stairs, overcome by the rush of raw hurt he felt. Draco reached out a hand to steady him mid-tirade, without even pausing for breath.
“Nice to meet you, Andie.” She didn’t respond, and Harry added, “Aren’t you cold out here?” The wind was mild today, but it was almost December, and the air held a frigid chill.
Still, attraction (even blatant attraction) was one thing, and asserting bisexuality (aloud) (to Draco, of all people) was quite another.
“I – well, that is –” Draco’s throat bobbed as he swallowed. His eyes darted away from Harry. “I would not want to intrude. I doubt Granger would find me a –
. I was willing to work for that, and I still am, if you decide that Hogwarts isn’t the right place for you. But I’d be so, so glad if you were here too.”
She rubbed his back, muttering soothing words until his tears ran out. He took a few gasping breaths, then straightened.
“No,” Draco allowed, “I wouldn’t be.” He kissed Harry’s knuckles and added, “But it still would have felt wrong. Like a political move, not an authentic one.”
It is managing not to wake him on your mission to take a piss quietly, even though you are quite, quite clumsy; because his sleep is enough of a motivation to make you careful.
It is him continuing the argument with you as tears stream down your face because he knows you, he believes you, he respects you, and so when you say you are capable of fighting anyone, even him, with tears streaming down your face, he takes you at your word.
It is arguing with him that you have every right to be proud of your history, no matter how twisted and rotten it became because of blind faith and superstition; because of megalomania and tribalism.
“A Muggle concoction, darling – well, well, you certainly have moved on from your school years. Who exactly are these new friends, Pansy? I don’t remember you mentioning them, and you have been looking especially lively lately. Anything interesting to share?” Draco quirked his eyebrow at Pansy, taking the glass and sniffing it tentatively before taking a sip. “This is surprisingly good” he added somewhat grudgingly.
It is waking up a few hours later, knowing with absolute certainty that he’s up, he’s dressed and he’s walking around the house as he does every morning.
And while he was acknowledging things, Draco could also acknowledge, in the safety and comfort of his own bed, that his feelings for Potter went deeper than just gratitude. You couldn’t be arch-enemies with a boy for 7 years, you couldn’t fight with him and try to outsmart him and be generally obsessed with him throughout your school life, without developing more complicated feelings for that boy especially when he (at an abnormally young age) defeated the evilest wizard of their time and was your personal salvation in more ways than one.
Several drinks later, Draco could see that his many eloquent arguments had failed to move Pansy from her frankly ridiculous defense of the Humboldt novel. A sneaky voice whispered in Draco’s conscience that he too had been positively impacted by the book when he had first read it, but he firmly ignored that voice and resolutely kept arguing.
Draco resented the implication that he was not ‘over himself’ and proceeded to tell Pansy so in his most no-nonsense tone. Predictably, it had no effect on her. Unless smirking at him counted as an effect, and if it did, it certainly wasn’t the desired effect.
Several hours later, Draco emerged from the daze he had fallen into while reading the book. He was, quite frankly, shocked at how absorbed he had been, he couldn’t remember the last time he had finished a book in a single sitting. While the book was fresh in his mind, Draco started on his first draft:
Out-maneouvered by Pansy’s Slytherin strategems, Draco resigned himself to a complete disrupted evening schedule and decided to complete his evening tasks in advance to prepare for Pansy.
“Pansy, dear, you’re not making any sense. Can I offer you a drink so we can sit down and discuss this like reasonable adults? I can’t imagine why my review of this book has you up in arms. It is hardly the masterpiece of the century. A more hackneyed and poorly expressed book, I have not had the misfortune to encounter!” Draco exclaimed, hoping to move Pansy from her current stance, standing with her arms folded at her chest, with a strict look on her face.
Well, Pansy seemed to have come determined on a fight, so a fight she would have. Draco gave her his most arrogant smirk – “Why, Pansy darling, you talk as if you’ve actually read the book and we both know you don’t read. So why don’t you stick to what you do best – shopping, gossiping, occasionally working, and let me focus on the reading and reviewing?” By the time he finished his sentence, Pansy’s eyes were narrowed with anger.
Busy as she was pouring out their fifth (sixth? Seventh? Merlin!) drink, Draco missed the smirk on Pansy’s face before she adjusted her expression to be appropriately severe. “Draco, are we talking about me or you? I’m not the one who was obsessed with Potter in school, I’m not the one who had to tutor Potter for Advanced Potions in our Eighth Year on Slughorn’s request so that he would consider your application for the Mastery and talked incessantly about how bad at Potions he was all fucking year, and I am
“Pansy, darling, you look amazing as always. To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure?” Draco asked, moving towards Pansy with a smile. Pansy gave him a haughty look from under her lashes, which he took to mean he had displeased her in some way; he did not yet know what, but undoubtedly he was about to find out.
“Draco, it’s late and my shoes, although beautiful, are hell to stand around in, so I’m just going to cut to the chase: for the last five years, I have been waiting – patiently and then less patiently – for you to move on from the trauma of the War. At first, I understood that you needed time. Of all of us, you were the most affected and you had to deal with your Trials and those of your parents. After that, it was getting our NEWTs and finding work, so that also I understood – but Draco it has been three years that you’ve been working as a columnist and you’re almost done with your Potions Mastery. You have made something good from the ashes of our childhood but you are still stuck at 17, shell-shocked and unable to process anything and I am no longer capable of waiting patiently or otherwise!” Pansy ended on a huff, breathless from her monologue.
It is the exchanged ‘how was your day’s and ‘I love you’ which you never forget to say to each other at night. The ‘thank yous’ after your (invariably mind-blowing) orgasms.
On Monday morning, the noted exception to the 7.30 rule, Draco found himself blinking awake when the sun was much higher in the sky than expected. Casting a Tempus, Draco found to his shock that it was close to 11. Although Draco had built-in Monday as the day he had a lie-in, he never woke later than 9, so he quickly got washed and dressed, ready to take on the rest of Monday. He may not have an alarm for Monday but that didn’t mean he had no schedule for the day. On Mondays, his Editor would usually owl back with comments on Draco’s latest column, which Draco would work on all day and send the final version by evening for publication the coming Sunday.
Well, Draco thought to himself with a grimace, he could acknowledge his feelings if he really wanted to. He could acknowledge the fact that at 16 he had realized that his life had been a sham, he could acknowledge the utter betrayal and pain he felt after Voldemort’s return when it sunk in that his father, whom he had idolized for most of his childhood and adolescence, was nothing but a power-hungry bigot. Draco could even acknowledge that he was truly, truly grateful to Potter every single day. Not only for saving his life, not only for speaking for him and his mother at the trials but for just existing and defeating Voldemort and being so good that Draco had been forced to acknowledge that goodness existed.
“Draco, for fuck’s sake. It’s late and I am all out of patience with you. This book could be good for you. Maybe you will finally be able to acknowledge that you also suffered and you also survived. And having survived, you need to actually live! Oh Salazar I need a drink for this! Your hard head is too much for me to handle sober.” With that, Pansy marched over to his drinks cabinet and started pulling out bottles as Draco watched with a bemused expression. Pansy then bustled over into his kitchen and finally came back out followed by floating glasses and bottles. As she sat down on the couch next to Draco, she started pouring out the drinks from the bottles which were now hovering nearby.
It is knowing that when you sit up and call his name, he’ll come to you and when you ask what he’s doing, he will say he is figuring out breakfast and ask you what you want.
Love is having an intimate idea of what he smells like. It’s a bit gross actually, if you think about it too long. You know how his sweat smells, his musk smells.
Sighing happily to have his scheduled social interaction fixed, Draco sent off the letter to Pansy as proof that he had followed through on his promise, and informed her that he was meeting Teddy which ought to count towards one of the outings that Pansy wanted him to have and should be additional evidence of his perfectly functional and fulfilled life. With a flourish, Draco tied his note to Pansy along with the letter and sent them off with Pharoah, feeling as if his morning, despite the shaky start, had ended up being quite productive.
Unfortunately, it was possible that the several drinks had impacted his persuasive ability somewhat, because he was sure he had made his point before – “s-s-so Pansy darling, it just cannot stand, you see. This book epi-epimot-epitomises everything goody-two-shoes and soft and everything I don’t condone. If this Alexandra witch is to be believed, you can just apologise for your mistakes and everyone will forgive you! You know that’s not true Pans! First of all, if I started apologizing to everyone I hurt, that would have to become my only task for years to accomplish, and also!” Draco hiccupped and took another good swallow of his drink, “these are really quite potent for drinks that Muggles came up with. Anyway, as I was sh-sh-shaying – imagine if I went up to Granger or Weasley or even Potter and apologized to them about my mistakes! They would be more likely to curse me than forgive me, and I say this knowing their painful Gryffindor dislike of Dark curses. So there!” Draco felt that his ending probably needed some work, but he was sure this argument would have convinced Pansy.
As the memories kept rushing, Draco felt his chest getting tighter, every breath harder to take than the last. His head was pounding. He could feel the blood rushing in his veins. He could feel the memories swirling in his head, unable to pause them, unable to leave the suffocating feeling of realizing that his life was built on lies and hatred. Draco could feel Pansy standing next to him as he grabbed her arm, trying desperately to breathe in her comforting scent, that unmistakable combination of ylang-ylang and lavender which was her signature perfume.
” he imitated her tone (rather poorly in Pansy’s opinion but she wisely kept quiet, Draco was far from done.) “You seem to have forgotten, Pansy, that we were not part of the War as the good guys. Certainly I was not. We were the bad guys; do you understand that? We were the people who were defeated. I don’t know in what godforsaken world I am expected to ‘move on’ from this! I’m not like the precious Gryffindor war heroes who deserve to have Mind Healers and happy endings with their red-headed wives. I am the villain. I deserved to be in Azkaban. I got away with my wrongdoing on a technicality, Pansy! As if being underage meant that I was not fully aware of what I did, as if I don’t have to live with the fact that my whole life was based on bigotry. You think I should move on from that? I should move on from the fact that I have caused the death of so many people. That I was part of the side who were murdering and torturing and dismembering – and – and…”
Love is not the big things that you have done for each other, you pretending not to recognise him, him saving your life, your mother saving his. Love is the everyday, the simplicity, the familiarity, the security of having someone to whom you come first.
For a minute he thought Pansy looked shifty-eyed, but then she looked straight at him and he thought he must have imagined the look. “Draco, we are not here to talk about me and any new friends I may be making – and for your information, shagging a new bloke every week is not the only thing that makes me happy. Unlike you, I actually enjoy spending time with people and going out. Not all of us choose to be recluses and behave as if going out twice a week would be the heights of hedonism. We are here to talk about this excuse of a review you wrote on Alexandra Humboldt’s book and why you need to change it.”
Pansy was stroking an arm down his back when he came back to his senses, making shushing noises that sounded so maternal and comforting that they should have felt out of place from Pansy, but somehow soothed him nevertheless. “Sshh, my darling, you’re okay. You’re safe. You’re with me in your house. Nothing bad is going to happen to you.” Pansy was whispering to him, and despite his recent panic attack, Draco let out a tired chuckle at her last sentence. “M-my sweet,
As the sun’s rays hit the window of Draco’s bedroom, his Tempus Charm chimed to wake him up at 7.30, as it did every morning except Monday mornings. One of the best parts of his ordered existence was the fact that Draco had complete control over how his day would go. No longer was he the unwilling resident of a house that had been the domain of a crazed maniac; no longer did he have to wake up every morning with complete terror thinking about what fresh horror the day would bring. Instead, he awoke to peace and quiet in his home on the outskirts of London, no maniacs to worry about. He knew that Lucius had never forgiven him for ‘abandoning his legacy’ by leaving the Manor and moving to his own house, but after the War and his house arrest, Draco only had bad memories of that house remaining, so when he finally reached the age of 21 and his house arrest ended and he came in possession of his vault at Gringotts, Draco’s first action was to move out and start looking for his own place.
So absorbed was Draco in his study of Potter’s photo and thinking about the identity of his companion, purely as a matter of journalistic interest of course; that Draco’s tea had gone completely cold; a fact of which he became aware when he took an absentminded sip that he spat out in disgust. Sighing, Draco used a quick Heating Charm on his tea, even though he knew it would taste off after being heated magically. He chided himself for reading the trash that the Prophet printed and studiously avoided looking at Potter’s photo for the remainder of his breakfast, immersing himself at his own column.
It is knowing that he will always look askance at for using a heating charm on the water for your coffee instead of heating it the ‘proper’ way, using a saucepan.
Draco looked at her blankly, and with experience borne from knowing him from the age of 4 and being more than familiar with his expressions, Pansy knew that he was not far from losing his temper. In the next moment, Draco’s face was red with fury, and he exploded.
Draco wasn’t sorted into Slytherin just so he could accept the first offer on the table. “No deal, you bloody bint. Two outings with you,
Draco straightened up as if zapped – this would never do. What he had written so far would simply not do! It was far too… saccharine. His entire brand was built around his tongue-in-cheek reviews. He was famous (for a given value of the term) for his biting wit and sarcasm, his Editor was always forwarding letters written about his column and most people writing in – fans and detractors alike – reacted to that wit and that cutting prose. To now write a review that was sincere and appreciative, Draco feared, would never be well-received when the readers were accustomed to a very different type of content.
He wouldn’t fool himself into thinking anything of it, but since that first and most awkward greeting, whenever Granger had run into him at the library or occasionally at the Ministry or in Diagon Alley, she always greeted him, and in the last few years they had even chatted for a few minutes over a cup of tea in the café of the British Library. She was, predictably, the youngest member of the Wizengamot, and worked on drafting and pushing through anti-discrimination laws. Since Draco’s own specialisation for his Potions Mastery was in the creation of different calibrations of Wolfsbane, he and Granger often found themselves in the same parts of the British Library trying to unpack the history of lycanthropy.
I’ll be in touch about our first outing. Do restock on the ingredients for our drink! Ta!” With a wave that was too cheeky for how late it was, Pansy closed her eyes and Apparated away, leaving Draco with all the clean-up.
So, with a glass of merlot in his hand and good old John on his lap (the book, naughty), Draco looked towards his weekend with reasonable anticipation. Five years after the War, capitalized as it would always be in his mind, Draco’s low-drama, low-excitement life was a hard-won thing and something he had not expected to be able to achieve. With the anticipation of a new book to read, Draco took a large sip from his drink and got to it.
She had always been striking, but over the last few weeks, Draco had noticed that she seemed more settled as a person, somehow more relaxed. Knowing Pansy as he did, Draco would have assumed it was her new love interest, but she had not mentioned anyone lately, and Pansy could not keep a secret to save her life. Sometimes almost literally, as blurting out her terrible idea that Harry Potter should be handed over to the Dark Lord had been one of those times she had said something with the distinct possibility of being injurious to her health, if not downright fatal.
As always, thinking about his work reminded Draco of the inspiration behind it, which was his nephew Teddy Lupin. Realising that he had not met Teddy for a few weeks, Draco drafted a quick owl to Andromeda asking if he could visit the next day. (Coincidentally, or not so coincidentally, Wednesday was the day Draco usually set aside for his limited social interactions anyway, so Teddy would fit right into the schedule).
It is all the different types of kisses you have – the small, gentle touches of your mouths which are a reminder of love, the loud smacking kisses you like to place on his wonderfully soft cheeks, the soft almost-kisses you rain on his face and body as symbols of your devotion.
Draco was displeased. Not only had his tactic not worked and Pansy had seen right through it, her insistence on returning tonight would completely mess up his routine. His face must have given away his objections, she added “And don’t give me that look Draco Malfoy, your routine could use some changing once in a while and if you even try to bar the Floo, I swear I will tell Narcissa how you’re avoiding all your friends and how worried we all are about you and you’ll have her and Lucius over in a moment, ready to hover all around you!” With that final word, she turned and Flooed away.
Love is knowing each other’s bodies so intimately, so deeply, that even if you lost your sense of sight, your mind has a perfect map of his body. He is so deep within you, so imprinted on your soul, that you will never, ever forget.
So, as he did every day but Monday, Draco rose from bed and set to making breakfast. Today was a Sunday, so he would make a proper fry-up, and a steaming mug of tea, enjoying a luxurious breakfast reading his own column (this week’s column had a scathing review of Marcus Flint’s new pub, which served the absolute worst house red Draco had ever had the misfortune to taste); and reading the columns in other publications which were knock-offs of his own – trying and failing to recapture the essence of his reviews.
Draco himself was quite happy with his job – as an anonymous critic of all things high society and all things popular. His impossibly high standards meant that he was never pleased, and his acerbic tongue ensured that his displeasure was expressed in a pithy and very entertaining manner for anyone who chose to subscribe to the Daily Prophet’s sister magazine ‘Weekend Oracle’. Draco’s column, ‘Fancy That’ was a weekly column reviewing – albeit usually criticizing – whichever fad had lately overtaken the Wizarding world. From the Saviour’s Savories, a café with black-haired waiters (“…a pathetic attempt to capitalize on the victory of the Twice-Lived Saviour over the His Noselessness”) to the latest offering from Ogden’s firewhiskeys (“…a word would suffice - swill”) – Draco reviewed them all.
“Believe it or not, when we first met Hermione, the two of them didn’t like each other and she was a bit annoying.” Harry shrugged after he said this, and he raised his wand. “Tea?” He looked at Draco, eyebrow raised questioningly. Draco nodded and noticed a teapot and cups were floating over to the two of them.
“Of course. You’ll get them tomorrow at our 10pm meeting.” He smiled and Harry nodded. Draco turned and flooed into his sitting room, a dark and gloomy contrast to the Potter household. He sighed and slipped off to bed, the scent of vanilla and lavender surrounding him.
“I’m in here kiddo! Come here for a second, I’d like you to meet someone.” He nodded to Malfoy and gestured for him to come into the room.
Draco smiled, adjusting Teddy on his lap, and looked up at Harry, “Nothing Harry, just having a nice conversation with Ron and Hermione here.”
Thank you to anyone that is reading this! If you have any input on what should be in the story, or a way that I can improve, or just want to say something about this chapter, please do! I greatly appreciate feedback.
“Do I look silly Teddy?” Draco was smiling brightly now. Teddy could only nod at this point, for words were unable to form through his fit of laughter. “Well if that’s the case, then I surely can’t be the only one to look silly.” His grin stretched as he saw Teddy’s eyes widen slowly as the words processed through his mind. Teddy went to speak and raise his hands to his face but was a second too late. Draco had taken a handful of flour and tossed it at the boy, who now mirrored him with the mess. Teddy just stared at Draco, surprise crossing his face, and then a smile. The kitchen was silent as the two looked at the mess that had been created. The silence was finally broken when Harry broke out in laughter again.
Draco didn’t exactly know where he and Potter stood outside of former school rivals. But he looked back at Teddy and shrugged, “Sure.” And he looked back up at Potter, who seemed to be trying to hold in a laugh at the interrogation he was receiving from Potter’s godson.
“I promise. Molly just wants to get to know you. Ron and Hermione told her that we’ve become friends recently and when it comes to Molly, if her children, birth or “adoptive”, say that someone’s changed, she believes them and wants to get to know them for who they are now instead of who they were.” Harry smiled at Draco and put his other hand on Draco’s other shoulder. “I promise you Draco, they just want to get to know you, the
“Believe it or not, yeah.” Harry smiled. “When you let go and just have fun with it all, get flour and sugar all over the place, and yourself, you forget why you were sad or upset in the first place.” His smile softened as he said this, and he turned to look at Teddy, who was now pulling ingredients from the fridge and pantry. “It also helps that Ted here gets so into it, that you can’t help but be happy. Hence why we bake when we’re sad in this house.”
“Yeah, sorry about just being in your kitchen when you woke up, but I got an invitation to come over and make breakfast and I just couldn’t say no.” Draco laughed and looked down at Teddy, who was now burying his head in Harry’s leg, hair suddenly turning a pink-ish red, almost blush like.
“Sorry about that mate. Forgot that you’re probably not used to that.” Weasley let Draco go and took a step back, making room for Granger in the space. Draco simply nodded, not saying a word, terrified that he might say something that would upset either one of them and would make Harry run to the rescue, which he didn’t want to happen.
“None of my spells ever went wrong,” Draco breathed out. He sounded like he was cradling a miracle in his palms. “Everyone else’s did, before McGonagall took our wands. And you –” Draco’s eyes widened as he looked at Harry. “Only a few of yours were affected. Much less than everyone else –”
Luna, Neville, and Hannah had been discharged just a few days after Draco’s potion was administered. None were strong enough to use their magic yet, but Tahlyn had cleared them to resume all other activities. Blaise though, was still bedridden. The hooks had managed to burrow fully through his core before he’d been put into stasis, which made his case significantly more serious than the others. He’d been in the hospital wing for a week now, and Tahlyn expected it would be a week more before he fully recovered.
In the ensuing silence, McGonagall’s voice washed over them, brittle as old parchment. “Stand aside please, Poppy. Let them in.”
“It’ll keep.” Maeve tossed her head unconcernedly. The Pygmy Puffs ricocheted back and forth, as if they were laughing at Draco. “You have me intrigued. And you know I’ve always wanted to see you brew.”
Harry shifted his weight, preparing for a tight turn, but his broom shuddered again and sped up, careening in the opposite direction Harry was steering it.
The cries echoing through the thin walls had been a torment, but Harry refused to move, some part of him believing that Draco would feel his presence and come back to him. Harry wanted to be facing him, poised and ready, when he finally opened the door.
It was mid-morning on a Tuesday, late enough that they had missed the traffic of harried businesspeople off to work, and the train was nearly empty. Why Harry had sat directly next to Draco, instead of opposite him, was something he was choosing not to think about. Instead, he slipped gently into the memory of the quiet upturn of Draco’s lips as he had admired Harry’s back garden.
The silence in the common room that evening, no one even lifting a head as they picked at the dinner of sandwiches and pumpkin juice the house elves had delivered.
Draco was working in the tiny kitchen of their bespelled cottage, while Harry lounged in the lofted bedroom. Relaxing his muscles into the plush mattress, Harry released his magic in tiny pulses, tossing it away from him only to snap it back into his waiting hands, as if he were playing with an invisible ball.
Neville’s eyes snapped open. He groaned as his body began to thrash more violently. At the same moment, Hannah shuddered, then fell entirely still.
“Tonight, actually,” Draco said, unable to stop the butterflies that fluttered happily to life in his stomach. His worries slunk back into the shadows, temporarily defeated by the joy of an evening with Harry. “He asked me to come over after work.”
Frozen with longing, Harry couldn’t tear his eyes away, even as a larger part of him ached with echoes of Draco’s pain. Harry desperately wanted to comfort him, but he didn’t know how.
Maeve moved her wrist in a circular motion, and the orange light spilled from her wand. She spoke an incantation Draco did not recognize, and the color lightened, becoming more of a peach tone.
“I wouldn’t have it any other way, Potter,” Draco said primly. He slid into a seat as Harry set the plates on the table.
“Right. Er, sorry Malfoy. Could I sit down?” Harry felt the back of his neck growing hot, and reached his hand up to grip onto the hair there. He twisted the strands anxiously between his fingers.
A rush of triumph surged through Harry, settling low in his belly. He bit down gently at the crook of Draco’s neck, then worked his way upward in a series of wet, open-mouthed kisses. Draco shuddered and again tried to slot their lips together. Harry lingered just long enough for Draco to feel the ghost of his breath, then darted his head away. He kissed Draco’s knuckles, before dropping his hand and ambling back toward the gate.
on Harry’s part, one that Draco should not allow himself to succumb to. Draco had almost snogged Harry on the street just now, for Merlin’s sake! Thank fuck for Weasley, honestly, as loathe as Draco was to admit it. He could not afford to lose himself like this, not when he was already losing Maeve.
Harry paused, gathering himself. He didn’t particularly want to tell this story, but he was acting on instinct. Offering Malfoy something beyond
Then he clapped Draco on the shoulder, grinned at Harry, and offered his hand to Hermione. The two said goodnight and wandered off to bed.
“You did not often find allies among the staff, not in the ways you needed, and not when you needed help the most. Upon reflection, it is no surprise that you chose to investigate alone.”
Draco frowned like he wanted to argue, but quickly relented and glanced curiously around the room. “What happened?” he asked, just as his eyes caught on the overturned ladder. He snorted and raised an eyebrow at Harry.
If it hadn’t been for his Sentiomancy, Harry might have thought they were dealing with nothing more than a rather boring haunting, carried out by a mischievous (if uninspired) ghost.
They both went very still, united in their misery, and silence descended over the room, as if even the sounds of nature shied away from intruding upon them. Draco looked out the window, seeking starlight, but the comforting lights of the heavens were hidden by clouds. Draco sighed, fighting off the irrational desire to slump forward and rest his head in Harry’s lap.
With a few mumbled words, Harry shut off the lights and wrapped them in a warming charm. The window was open, and the room smelled of snow and starlight. It was quiet for a time, their breaths growing steady and even.
Maeve snorted. “Abigail and Festus are making beautiful progress,” she said, referring to two of the new shop assistants she had recently hired, “as you know quite well, Draco. They have everything well in hand.” She raised her eyebrows then, and directed a haughty sniff toward George. “Which is more than I can say for any of you. Now sit down, all of you,” she ordered. “I can’t have you hovering over me as I work.”
“Anyone can use floo powder, Draco,” she said at last, moving to stand beside him. “Even a Muggle. The spell is self-contained, and of no danger to anyone.”
Weasley’s mouth quirked, but before he could reply, Harry walked out onto the mat with his trainer, a muscular man with golden brown skin and black curls spilling around the edges of his helmet.
Back at Hogwarts now, Harry’s heart seemed still to be dancing, though they had left the music behind long ago.
“Yes,” Draco replied. “After the trial, I legally inherited the Malfoy estate, and it – sickened me. I was not privy to all of my father’s business dealings, but I knew enough. Terrible things amassed that fortune, and I wanted no part of it. When Maeve offered me the job, it felt like a way out.”
Malfoy didn’t seem to share his qualms, finishing the sentence matter-of-factly. “After we fought. And?” he prompted.
“I wrote apology letters, after the war,” Draco explained. “I didn’t get many replies. Not that I was expecting any,” he added hastily. “That’s not why I sent them. But Luna, she wrote back.”
Glowing blue symbols appeared in the air between them. McGonagall took her time looking through them. While she swiped some aside carelessly, most were regarded with serious intent. Finally, she waved her hand and they disappeared.
Harry was just starting to worry about what he’d tell Ron and Hermione, who weren’t conveniently tucked away in class right now and who would almost certainly object to him racing through the castle with Draco Malfoy, when he suddenly crashed into Malfoy’s back.
“Obviously.” Draco gestured to himself and rolled his eyes. “Took you long enough to find me though.”
Having not yet gotten his breath back, Harry was unable to retort. He made a strangled sounding noise instead. To make himself feel better about it, he pretended it was more indignant than pained.
Harry grinned and nodded. “I think she felt bad for me. I was so confused.” He pointed his wand toward the door.
They stood there for just a minute longer, staring at the shop. Even closed for the night, dark and empty, there was something beautiful about it.
“Well, first of all, I think you should throw those letters straight in the bin.” Draco’s hands clenched on the arms of his chair, and he leaned forward fiercely. “Fuck the Aurors,” he growled, “and the Ministry, and anyone else who wants to get their hands on you.”
Draco nodded, expression fierce, his own unease over the Manor apparently forgotten. He turned his glare on the door to the cupboard for one long moment before seizing Harry’s hand. Goosebumps erupted up Harry’s entire arm.
They stared at each other for a long moment, Potter shuffling his feet awkwardly and Draco taking in his disheveled appearance (
Harry passed obligingly through the door and found himself in a meticulously organized storeroom. High shelves ran along the walls, each stacked with labeled wooden crates. Light spilled through another open door in the back corner, and Harry could hear the sound of a running faucet. He made his way toward it, grimacing slightly as his bare feet scraped against the cement floor.
Draco turned away from Harry. He retreated further into the corner of the sofa, pulling his knees into his chest and burying his head in his arms.
“It –” Draco faltered, thinking frantically. “It improves blood circulation while lowering the heartrate and inducing a carefree feeling. It is ideal for smoothing over –” he brushed the hair out of his face – “awkwardness.”
But now, Draco himself had been dumped unceremoniously at Potter’s feet, and he could no longer doubt that something strange was afoot. He and Potter were tangled up in a magic that would take time and patience to unravel, and Draco was not certain he had the stomach for it.
They stayed that way for a long while, kissing slow and deep. Every so often, Draco would break away, tip his head back to look at his conjured lights. Harry did not rush him, just massaged Draco’s shoulders and let him spiral back into kissing all on his own.
“Never for an entire duel,” Lavender said. “But yes, he uses wandless spells whenever he wants to catch me off guard.”
It was only one o’clock, and Harry had nothing to do with the rest of his day. The cottage was clean, the fridge was packed with Molly’s Sunday leftovers, he’d already plowed through his new mystery novels, and he couldn’t think of anything else to build. The spice rack, mug shelf, and a series of intricate wooden picture frames had rather exhausted his creative wells, at least for now.
the flowers were good. They’re fighting something, Potter. Whatever the nasty thing you felt is, Hogwarts is using the flowers to fight against it.”
Tears pricked at Harry’s eyes as he reached blindly for Draco. Clutching each other tightly, they stared at the smoke already blanketing the night sky. Those billowing grey clouds drifted sensually upward, draping tendrils over the Quidditch goal posts and blocking out the stars.
He breathed Draco in, burying his nose in his pubic hair, before kissing his way up his shaft. When he reached the head, Harry wrapped his lips around it, tonguing at Draco’s slit as he sucked.
“Headmistress, that is really not necessary –” Draco began to protest, but McGonagall neatly interrupted him.
Harry reached for Draco’s hand, but found only empty air. Draco was standing a yard away from Harry, hovering in the middle of the small dirt lane they were on. He was watching the gate the way a mouse might eye a large cat, afraid to make any sudden moves.
Draco burrowed his head into Harry’s chest with a deep inhale. Then he sat up and kissed Harry softly. He got out of bed and began to re-tie his hair while he checked on his cauldrons. After a moment, he started slightly and his eyes darted toward the windowsill. Seeing that Harry had replaced the glass flower, he immediately relaxed and sank down against his lab table.
They were quiet for a time, then Harry sat up and rested his head against Hermione’s shoulder. “Thanks, Hermione,” he whispered.
Still, Draco was soaked in sweat by the time the teapots were empty and the conversation lulled. George stood, ushering Harry and Draco into chairs facing each other as he explained that they should not move or touch each other for any reason while he performed the spell. Draco let the words wash over him, struggling to absorb the instructions. Letting go of Harry’s hand had felt like a physical blow.
“Her parents died when she was young, so Maeve raised her,” Draco continued. “Maeve just found out that Madelyn is pregnant. They’re both thrilled, but the pregnancy was unexpected, and it seems the baby’s father has run off on Madelyn.”
They sat quietly for a time, McGonagall watching Harry with a glimmer of pride in her eyes. The fire crackled merrily beside them, and in that moment, Harry felt so safe in this little bubble of warmth, so supported by McGonagall’s steady presence, that he could no longer hold in the words.
Harry groaned in frustration. He put the untouched tea back on the table and twisted his fingers into his hair. “It’s just – yesterday morning –” Unable to finish, he dropped his head, sure his face was bright red.
The week after their meeting with McGonagall passed in a blur of words and crumbling parchment. Between deciphering spiky ancient handwriting, frequent (not-officially-sanctioned-but-not-forbidden) trips to the restricted section of the library, and coughing their way through countless musty old tomes, Harry and Draco barely had time to eat, let alone engage in other, more pleasurable… activities.
Maeve winked at him. “The point is, I was bustling about, rattling things around, making all sorts of noise, and you didn’t look up once.” She seemed mildly exasperated by this. “What on earth were you doing?”
Harry looked around, more carefully this time, but he still didn’t recognize it. His memories from the night with the Snatchers were hazy at best.
Harry looked up, and Draco hesitated before setting the book down on the table next to him. He ran anxious fingers over the shaved side of his head, then folded his hands into his lap as if to stop himself from fidgeting.
And in that moment, looking at the unhappy line of Malfoy’s back, Harry realized that the inverse was also true. How was Malfoy ever supposed to overcome
“Thank you for your help today, love,” Maeve said, seeming as always to know exactly what Draco needed. “You were wonderful.”
Harry fled the table, neck burning. He felt Draco’s eyes on him right up until he rounded the corner and hurried out of sight.
Harry groaned, panting softly as Draco took him deeper with every rock of his hips. They were still for a moment, once Harry was fully inside, resting their foreheads together and kissing wetly as Draco adjusted. And then they began to move.
“Now this,” Maeve continued with a sly smile, wiggling her fingers toward the lilac light, “has been around much, much longer. Since you were about twelve, I’d say.”
Harry had shifted subtly into a dueling stance, letting Malfoy draw a few steps ahead. Just as he was deciding what to cast – something harmless, but provocative enough to earn retaliation – Malfoy spun to face him. Harry didn’t know if his rival’s quick mind had guessed his intent or if there was just something in the night air, but when Malfoy flashed a devilish grin and knocked Harry off his feet with a wordless Impediment Jinx, it ceased to matter. The game was on, and it felt
it behave?” Harry asked, when the silence had stretched on for several minutes and Malfoy gave no sign that he meant to continue.
With a bit of effort, Harry managed to shake off his unease. He knew he had done as much as he’d been able in the aftermath of the war, and Hogwarts had not suffered for his absence during the reparations. And if he was going to convince Draco to forgive himself, then Harry needed to work on overcoming his own lingering guilts as well.
“Oh Harry, you couldn’t have known.” Luna reached out and grasped his hands in hers. "You had to stop Voldemort.”
“We don’t have to talk about it, Harry” Hermione rushed to reassure him. “We just wanted to see you.”
“Could it be some kind of life debt?” Harry suggested hesitantly. He wasn’t sure it was a good idea to bring up the past, even vaguely. It was not an easy thing, to sort out what Harry and Draco owed each other. The majority of their relationship had been a tangle of barbs and razorblades, and even their moments of saving each other had held a sharp edge.
“I know that. I do,” Draco said into Harry’s chest. “I just – it’s hard, to believe it sometimes.” He took a shuddering breath, then lifted his head to meet Harry’s eyes. “I shouldn’t have assumed. I know you wouldn’t intentionally hurt me. I know you l–” Draco cut himself off, suddenly looking very uncomfortable. His eyes flicked toward the fire and he started to shuffle toward it, mumbling about more wood.
This week’s professor, Brogan Driffield, was a retired auror from America who was tasked with teaching the eighth years the art of Aperiomancy. He was a tall, spindly man, but his lean muscles and precise balance belied his advanced age. He was obviously still practiced in dueling. He also had a funny little white mustache, so small and tidy that it reminded Harry of a toothbrush.
When the two had arrived back at the dorms a few minutes ago, Malfoy had cried, “The price of victory is steep! I think you’ve killed me, Potter!” before collapsing with a dramatic groan.
“More than anything,” Draco whispered. He squeezed his eyes shut and balled a fist against his chest. “But I’m afraid that without her, it will have no heart.”
“I remember you mentioning kickboxing,” Draco replied, eyes once again smooth grey pools. “You said it was like dueling?”
Hermione’s eyes filled with pity, and Harry suddenly felt so drained that he couldn’t even be angry about it. Ron tensed when Hermione nudged him, but then stood and busied himself clearing the table. Spoons clinked metallically against the sink as he started the washing up.
“Not yet,” she barked. But then her tone softened. “I’m sorry, loves. Just another minute and I’ll have you right as rain.”
Quite satisfied with himself, Harry cast around for something else to do, but came up empty. The cottage was as home-like as he could possibly imagine. He sighed dreamily and relaxed back against Draco.
“That’s how you met Maeve, right?” Harry asked, wanting to know anything else Draco was willing to tell. “Wandering London while staying with Blaise?”
Draco hissed and bucked against him, but Harry hesitated. He breathed in shakily, suddenly nervous, inexplicably shy.
Draco laughed, and some of the tension bled from the air. So Harry told him all about it – the energy of the kids, grumpy Declan, the fake Quaffle and the chaos, the tiny brooms. It was hard to be sure, since Harry couldn’t see his face, but Draco seemed to be hanging on every word. Draco may not have wanted to be involved in the organization, but Harry suspected that Draco was far more emotionally invested than he would be willing to admit, even to himself.
have a seeker game sometime,” Malfoy continued, glancing at Harry slyly. “You did offer, Potter. Don’t think you can get out of it now, just because you lost our duel.”
In time, their eyes adjusted, enough that Harry could see the tiny shifts in Malfoy’s expression as the music played on. Malfoy’s tongue darted out to wet his lips and then he slowly turned his head to Harry.
But Harry’s goodbye wave was so dispirited that Draco froze, trapped in place by the depth of disappointment in Harry’s eyes. It was like a sudden cloud cover had stolen all of Harry’s light.
“You can go on back, dear,” she said, rising and holding out a handful of bandages. “Take him these, would you?”
The numbness that had descended, flooding his veins like a tributary of the miserable river he was still staring at, retreated now, fleeing the renewed rage that burned ever outward from Draco’s wronged and withered heart.
Harry was heading toward the house when he spotted a young girl sitting on the grass reading a book, partially hidden by shrubbery. She was dressed in pink sweatpants and had jet black hair, but something about her reminded Harry strongly of Draco.
Potter’s heavy sobs trailed after Draco as he slipped quietly from the room. He hesitated again on the landing, finding it nearly impossible to turn his back on Potter’s pain. But Potter’s nightmares were likely products of the war, born from a darkness that Draco had helped create.
“Wooing?” Draco repeated, voice faint. His hands were clenched on his knees and he was frowning deeply. “Headmistress, I am afraid I don’t understand –”
“Yes, Potter,” Draco drawled, expertly flipping golden-brown slices of French toast out of the frying pan and onto plates. “As it so happens, I am an incredibly powerful seer. I foresaw your visit here today and spent hours writing fake Potions books, just to trick you into eating breakfast with me.” He drizzled each portion with something red and syrupy from the small pot, followed by a dusting of powdered sugar.
He shivered and uncurled from himself, gazing at Harry with wide, desperate eyes. He let himself fall backward, pulling Harry down with him into the soft grass. Harry lay beside him, propped on an elbow, his face hovering over Draco’s.
His smile went soft and crooked, and Draco had to steel himself against it. “I have a better idea,” he said, stepping slowly away from the temptation of Harry’s strong arms. “Wait for me?”
“No,” Draco assured her, almost staggering under the force of her alarm. “No, nothing like that. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to worry you.” Granger’s posture relaxed enough that Draco felt able to continue. “I wanted to apologize for my behavior the other day.”
And there was that flicker of hope again, far more dangerous in Potter’s voice than when it had ghosted across his eyes.
“Harry,” Draco breathed, voice suffused with reverence. “I want you. I wanted you the first night we kissed. I wanted you before that, for so long.”
The stammered plea immediately shattered Harry’s tenuous grip on control. He moaned shamelessly and scrambled upright, straddling Draco’s hips and bringing their lips together in a filthy kiss. He plunged his tongue over and over into Draco’s mouth as they rutted against each other.
That Draco would be drawn to beauty that shone through damage was not a revelation. It fit, considering everything Draco himself had been through. But the observation still scoured through Harry, knocking him breathless. It was like the sun rising inside his chest, gathering all his feelings for Draco into one blinding point, a fiery sharpness that blotted out everything else.
Hermione hurried over to help with the table, dragging Ron behind her and muttering something about a Quidditch disagreement. Draco caught Harry’s eye, skepticism plain on his face, and Harry nodded subtly in agreement.
Malfoy’s hand caught in his hair and he brushed it impatiently aside. Harry watched, mouth dry, eyes fixed on that pale expanse of skin, so soft and tantalizing under the pressure of Malfoy’s massaging fingers.
Harry blanched, horrified at the implication. “No! Professor, no, not like that,” he rushed to correct her. “It’s not his soul, just an echo of his magic. Like his own residue.”
He sounded deeply sad, as if even contemplating the two of them not speaking was like suffering a loss.
It had been discomfiting – though, oddly, all the things that went wrong were minor nuisances. Neville’s dying plants had been the worst of it.
Draco lifted his hand and let his fingers slowly drift through the light. He let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding. Warmth rushed into him, his muscles unclenching one by one.
Soft music filled the room. Harry didn’t recognize it, but the melody twined with the sounds of the night, lyrical piano chords swirling through the rustling of leaves, punctuated with the chirps of crickets and the occasional croak of a frog.
Breathing slowly through his nose to calm himself, Draco had embarked on a silent search of the cottage, testing every door and window with the same result. Finally, he had admitted defeat and ensconced himself on the sofa.
Harry shook his head. The only trials he had attended were Malfoy’s and his mother’s, so he could speak on their behalf. Hermione had wanted Harry to go to the others, claiming it would help provide closure, but Harry had refused.
Outside, an owl hooted, and the hum of crickets was interrupted only by leaves rustling in the occasional gusts of wind. Closing his eyes, Harry let the evening chorus wash pleasantly over him.
His worries had fled with the last dregs of the night. When he had seen Malfoy waiting for him in the courtyard, framed against the pinkish sunrise, Harry couldn’t help but smile.
still reeling from the fact that Ron wasn’t all that bothered about Harry spending time with Malfoy. But aside from that, everything Luna and Hermione had said felt like a natural extension of the Malfoy Harry had been getting to know for weeks.
Harry nodded at this and looked at Malfoy once more. “Well, now that this has been settled,” He stood at this, Malfoy’s eyes following him as he did, “Hungry? I’m starving.” And he proceeded to the kitchen.
“Just as long as it’s before 5. I have,” Harry paused, he didn’t need to tell Malfoy about Teddy. “I have somewhere I need to be by then.” Malfoy nodded and headed through the green flames.
“It’s, uh,” Harry looked at his feet and run his fingers through his messy hair. He hadn’t tried to even take care of it that morning. “It’s fine Andromeda. Tea?”
“Of course.” Harry nodded, and turned and left in the floo. When he arrived at home, he went to the kitchen and made a cup of tea. He heard the flames of the fireplace roar and looked over to notice that they were emerald green. He wondered if Hermione or Ron had decided to stop by to visit, or maybe Neville or Luna. He peered over the kitchen counter to look at the fireplace and to disbelief, he saw Malfoy looking out from it.
Draco walked his usual route home, thinking about how many potions he had to make today, all those children that had been hit with the Dragon Pox. It just wasn’t fair. Thinking abut work had suddenly put Draco in a sour mood and his thoughts had turned to everything else, and the daily downward spiral had started again. He hurried home to try and get out of this headspace he was in and relax, but once in the door, he realized that all his home was going to do was make this feeling he had worse. He went to his kitchen, grabbed a bottle of Whiskey and put in an order for Chinese takeaway. He sat down in his armchair as he waited for his food and watched the fire blaze again.
Teddy looked once more at Harry and the man gave him a slight nod as the boy’s eyes widened with realization. He turned and walked over to Draco and once he was right in front of him, he looked up with curiousness.
“Good morning Sorting Hat. I was just wondering if you remember my sorting all those years ago?” Harry said happily, a giddy grin on his face.
I am that stupid and ignorant that I tried to save him.” Harry scoffed and sat back on the couch, looking over at Draco, the rage still in his eyes, but, Draco noticed, that were at himself, not at Draco.
“I didn’t do anything to him! I promise Daddy.” Teddy spun around to Harry and looked at him intently. “I was playing with him in my room, and I was showing him a picture of Mom and Dad and my heart hurt again when I was telling him the story you tell me, and then out of nowhere he started to get warm, but not so warm that it hurt, but I hugged him and…” Teddy trailed off, looking at the floor.
These thoughts ran through Draco’s head repeatedly until the cigarette had burned the edge of his fingers.
“I was just making a cup of coffee in my kitchen when I heard my floo go off, and when I checked it, there he was, smiling like he is now. He told me he needed help making you breakfast but wasn’t allowed to do it on his own but he didn’t want to wake you. So, naturally, here I am.” Draco shrugged like it wasn’t that big of a deal to just be in Harry’s house without his knowledge, cooking with his godson.
“Well, I guess it’s because when we went to school together, that’s what we did, we called each other by our last names.”
“Actually, yes. It started out that way, until I realized how much I actually liked getting them. And now, here I am, almost covered both of my arms.” Harry shrugged and smiled.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Um, yeah. Just had a moment. Nothing to worry about Harry.” Draco feigned his best smile and turned to look at Teddy, ignoring the questionable look on Harry’s face. “So, why aren’t you using magic? Aren’t you worried that he’s going to make a huge mess?”
“Draco?” Harry’s voice caught slightly in his throat from the shock of seeing the man in his kitchen with his son, laughing, smiling and cooking.
Harry laughed and got up from the couch and picked up Teddy, “It’s ready now if you would like to eat?” Teddy nodded hastily and looked down at the wolf then back up at Harry with questioning eyes, “Yes you can bring the wolf to dinner as long as you don’t get food on it.” Teddy smiled and then looked over at Malfoy and then back to Harry with the same questioning look. “Would you like Malfoy to stay for dinner?” Teddy nodded again. “Well, if he would like to stay for dinner, then he is more than welcome to.” Harry looked over at Malfoy who simply nodded and raised from the armchair.
ME!” Draco was breathing heavy now. He hadn’t realized how much anger from their childhood he had kept inside him all these years.
“Yeah Uncle Draco! You’ll have fun! Pleeeeeeeeeeease?” Teddy was now at Draco’s feet, pulling on his pants leg and giving him sad eyes.
He woke the next morning with the sunrise, as he always did, and made his way to the kitchen. He went about his usual morning routine as if nothing had changed in his life. Coffee, toast, Prophet. He finally made his way to work feeling somewhat better than he has in a long time.
Harry walked out of the fireplace first and Teddy and Draco followed, and he realized where he was and where the voice was coming from.
“Erroll?” Harry questioned. He took the parchment from the bird and gave him a few treats before turning back to the sitting room to read it.
The day was long, and Draco really didn’t notice the time flying by until Mr. Elowite had walked over to his cauldron and placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder. Draco flinched at the touch, forgetting where he was in the moment. Mr. Elowite removed his hand quickly and gave an apologetic look. Draco adjusted his face as best as he could to show that it was nothing Elowite did but brushed the situation off. “That time already?” He asked quietly, this was always the worst part of the day, going home. Elowite nodded and Draco packed up his things and headed home.
Draco looked up at Potter with a worried look but was reassured with a nod from Potter and finally bent down to meet Teddy’s gaze.
“Aunt Molly’s invited us over for dinner tonight, would you like to go?” He smiled down at the now silver haired child, who nodded eagerly.
“Don’t forget to bring young Teddy with you next time you visit?” She asked, still smiling. “I do love seeing that boy, even though I know how much of a handful I will have on my hand in a few short years.”
“Just milk.” He heard a small response from the kitchen, and then heard the man sitting down in his usual spot of the armchair next to the couch.
“Might as well get a move on then.” Draco pushed himself up out of his chair and moved over to his cauldron and started working on the dragon pox remedy. Outside of thinking about why he was making these potions, Draco always enjoyed his job. He had been working for Mr. Elowite for 5 years now as his Assistant Potions Master and it was truly one of the few joys he had left in his life, hoping to one day own his own Potions Brewery. Potions was always his easiest subject at Hogwarts and after the war and the trials, Draco had set out to get his Potions Mastery.
“Erm, well I guess if you don’t mind.” Draco twisted his fingers together. “But are you sure your clothes will fit? You’re like, twice my size now.” Draco questioned, looking over Harry’s frame, noticing the obvious size difference from the boy he remembered in school.
Teddy groaned on the floor and grudgingly got up. He looked over at Draco and gave him sad eyes again, obviously looking for a way out.
“I wouldn’t miss this day for anything my darling boy.” She smiled down at him, squeezing his hand as she said it.
Draco stood up and walked over to the fireplace. He knew he would regret this decision as soon as he made it, but he was at a point of no return. He grabbed a handful of floo powder from the cup on the mantle, threw it into the fire, when the fire blazed a brilliant emerald green, he said the address and suddenly, Potter’s face appeared before him.
and was walking around in just his socks. He felt completely overdressed at this moment and hated the fact that he made such a fuss over his appearance.
Hermione shook her head as if Harry wasn’t understanding, a look he was all too familiar with. “No Harry,” She huffed as she sat down, “I mean with the whole Malfoy thing.” He turned to her and saw the worry placed across her face.
that covered his forearms completely. He stared at the man’s arms as he followed them as they moved up to his hair. Harry had pulled out his wand from the bun that kept it in place and Draco was mesmerized as it cascaded down to his shoulders.
Draco took his face in and instantly noticed that it was Weasley, Ron Weasley standing in front of him. But this Ron Weasley wasn’t the same that he knew in school. He was strong looking, more freckles than Draco remembered, and he looked a lot more confident than the boy all those years ago, making Draco remember that it was more than just him and Harry that had changed from the war.
Harry sat looking at the fire that Draco Malfoy had just walked back into and disappeared. He had no idea what had just happened, and he didn’t know if it would happen again, but all he did know was that Malfoy had just spent almost 2 hours sitting in silence in his house and walked out. Harry shook his head and tried to put it to the back of his mind as he walked to bed.
“Of course, Ted. Let’s go. Thanks again Meda.” Harry waved behind him as he and Teddy disappeared into the floo.
Draco watched the boy with a pang in his heart as his mind thought of Scorpius when he had brought home different toys for him. He looked up at Potter and noticed the man was looking back at him, a look of gratefulness playing on his face. Potter had mouthed,
“Thank you, McGonagall. That means a lot, especially coming from you.” He hung his head as he smiled, slightly embarrassed. “But Malfoy? I mean, we hate each other.”
