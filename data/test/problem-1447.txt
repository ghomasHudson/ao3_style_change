The tears that Harry had been holding in since the outcome of the trial has come to be, came flowing out, followed be a sob.
He walked into the doors leading to the school, making his way through the destroyed corridors. The further away from the scene of the aftermath of the battle, the better. He found himself near the dungeons, subconsciously leading him to the old potions classroom that once occupied the grumpy old professor he once believed had it out for him.
Harry only nodded his head, allowing Draco to lead him into the kitchen. Dinner was quickly started and while they waited for it to be finished in the oven, they sat in each other’s arms.
There on the ground, laying in the water that filled the room from broken pipes, was Draco. The was crying out in pain as red stained the white shirt he was wearing and the blood stained the water. He was staring straight at Harry.
Over the last few months, having Harry’s life in more danger than usual, but Draco in edge. There was someone out to kill the boy who was beginning to mean everything to him, and he was completely powerless to stop it. The thought of losing Harry was unbearable to him.
He continued being dragged off, until they got to a dark space that eventually Harry could place together as a forest. Voldemort was there. And next to him stood Draco. The look on Dracos face paralyzed him in place. Draco shouldn't look like that. Something was wrong. Why did Draco look like he hated him?
“At least you weren’t a death eater, Potter. At least you were on a right side. I wish I could have been strong enough to do the right thing.”
It was a good time because there on his skin lay an imperfection that in a little less than a month would make him a murderer. He had over the year, pushed his friends away, grew distant with the world and given up hope that he would survive this. He already had one near death experience in the abandoned girls bathroom when the famous Boy-who-lived slashed him open with an unknown spell.
On June 30th, 1997, Draco let in the death eaters into Hogwarts through the vanishing cabinet.
Harry never would have believed that the moment he thought would be his end would actually be the moment he was comforted by the most unlikely boy. Draco looked at the crying boy, Harry looked back, and nothing was spoken aloud, but each knew that they needed someone in this moment. Someone who knew that the war had broken them, and to really comfort them. Which is what lead to the two once school rivals in each other’s arms, sobbing into each other’s shoulders as if this was a normal thing and they were closer than they actually were.
Not for Draco Malfoy.
“I think that I can arrange for that. But we need to make a deal.” Harry nodded his head. “Anything. Whatever you would like.” Harry answered immediately.
“It’s okay Harry. Just relax okay? I’m going to make this amazing for you. I promise you, I know how to make you feel good.” Harry nodded and Draco moved up to kiss Harry, distracting him as he placed one finger in softly. Harry’s gasped at the intrusion and Draco waited for Harry to adjust to the finger before he began moving it in and out of Harry.
Harry was used to the muggle world, being that he was from the muggle world. He got along with the teacher perfectly as they both talked happily about the things that were planned for the trip. Draco, along with Pansy and Blaise sat there, nearly drowning in the confusion that they felt.
“Wait... why are you telling me this, Potter?” Harry didn’t answer right away as he was fin bushing off his second drink very quickly. Draco took note in this and followed along, feeling himself get more and more drunk with every passing moment.
“Harry, it’s fake. This is all fake. And if we don’t get you out of here now, you will die.” Harry didn’t move. He still didn’t look away from the boy sitting in the corner. He didn’t think he could look away.
The great hall was the next place he entered. The entire room boomed with noise and excitement in such a lively atmosphere, most wouldn’t believe that two months prior, the dead bodies of people he cared about had laid on the floors in a lifeless heap. If someone hadn’t known about the war, they wouldn’t have guessed it had happened here in the room. Every brick was so out together, erasing all signs of anything happening there. Harry knew though. Harry knew that soon, he was going to be with the ones who died in this room. And that thought was oddly relaxing.
Before he had a chance to say no, his head moved as if it wasn’t his own, nodding in agreement. That smile on Harry’s face grew as the boy looked quite excited and relieved.
Draco knew that. He also knew that Harry wasn’t the heir of slytherin. After almost a year and half of knowing the boy, he knew enough to understand that Harry could never petrify someone. It wasn’t in his nature.
"Please, dont do this," he begged as he was pulled from view. "Please..." he said, but they were gone.
During breakfast that day, Draco made eye contact with Harry, and they both used their signal. It wasn’t long before Harry was standing in the abandoned classroom waiting for Draco.
Draco was taking Pansy Parkinson.
That night they lost their virginity to each other, finally after years of talking about it. For just a moment, they both forgot that Draco was going to be leaving the next day. For just a moment, they loved each other.
The dorm was mostly quiet when they entered it. Blaise and Draco didn’t say a word and Harry followed in their silent converse. Ron and Neville were both talking to each other happily, as if they were the only ones in the room. That feeling of the world moving around him as if he were in a movie appeared again, but he ignored it for the most part. This was what he wanted to experience, one last time before he left this world.
“I have missed you, my love.” He states, and Harry leans into Draco.
If it mattered, the wizarding world would have seen that Draco Malfoy had not been true to the death eaters. Draco Malfoy, was true to anything that involved Harry. As it had been for years now.
“I wouldn’t say that. I might understand more than you know.” Which was true. If anyone understand awful family, it was Harry.
“Hermione?” He answered back wanted the same thing she did. But they seemed to answer her question. She pulled him forward with a sob.
“So I went home that night, and I didn’t even get completely drunk. No, my mind was replaying the images of watching these men eat each other’s faces off. I didn’t dare go back the next night. I stayed inside for an entire week, until I couldn’t stand it any more and I had to go back. Something about it made me want to go back. And so I did. I never did anything with a bloke. But I can tell you that after the second night, I went home and fantasized about this man who I had seen there. And I got off from it. Not only once... multiple times.
"After careful consideration, we find the defendant Draco Lucius Malfoy guilty of the crimes he has committed during his time as a death eater. We sentence him to life in Azkaban. Case dismissed."
“Harry, do you understand what this means? It means that the whole school now has confirmation that you are the Heir of Slytherin.”
Harry woke up to a now lit room. For a moment he believed that maybe he had been brought to the hospital wing, but there was something off. The ceiling above him didn’t look like that of hospital wing. And he was on the ground. The hard ground. But he couldn’t still couldn’t be in the potions room. That room never got light.
“No problem mate. I don’t know what I would have done without you. Your my best friend. Like hermione said. It’ll get better.” Ron didn’t say anything after that. Harry watched him walk away, the last person he had wanted to give his final farewell too, gone.
Harry watched in amusement the entire time as the three slytherins sat there, on the edge of puking, staring out the window in Curiosity at the things around them. They were in a world they didn’t understand and this amused Harry.
“Are you going to tell me or not, Potter?” Draco was getting impatient. Harry looked at Draco, this time obviously drunk. He grinned and moved in closer to Draco.
"If I run off, they will kill my family. I need to protect my family. I can help you escape. But I need to stay here and I need you to go to the Dungeons with that Luna chick, her father and the goblin man. I'm not letting you lose. I've been hoping for you to win for sometime now." Harry understood this and without another word, nodded his head, continuing to walk the way to the Dungeons.
The voice didn’t speak for a long moment. He was sure that maybe the voice had went away. It wasn’t to long before he found it hadn’t.
Harry looked at Draco and the words just kind of clicked. His body lost all form of happiness or hope and say there almost lifeless. The look in his eyes were void of all emotion as he sat there, ready to spend the rest of his day alone in a room with the boy he wanted but could never get too.
Ron and Hermione both got angry at each other, and stormed out of the room, leaving Harry alone. Most of the people in room had left.
Knowing that it will never be that same, that you had lost the one thing that you loved the most, more than anything in the entire world.
Harry laughed and shook his head. “Nope. In fact, it was the opposite.”
"We have all been talking and we came up with a decision. You being death everywhere you go. No one is happy when your around. All you do is bring drama and unhappiness. And I never forgave you for killing my son." Harry stared at them all with his mouth open wide, trying to think of something to say. The beg then to stay with him.
He walked into the giant hole in the wall of the great hall and looked around at everyone. He saw the bodies of Lupin and Tonks. His mind went to their tiny little baby Teddy. Teddy would never have the chance to know his parents. He would never have the chance to grownup with a loving mother and a loving father.

The last book wasn’t published until way after the twins were born. They were born shortly after the second book had been released to the world.
Harry stared at Draco as he readied himself to say the words. He knew what Draco was going to say. He had to be right. If not, the worst that could happen is they dont talk for a while. Harry told himself he could handle that.
He got really worried about Harry, which was normal, but the hugs seemed to linger longer, the touches seemed to be never ending, and when Harry and Draco’s eyes met, it was as if the world had froze around them. They would stare at each other for a long period of time and Draco would look like he was contemplating something, and then when he realized how awkward it had gotten, he would stand up and leave.
“Merlin, how many times I stared at you across the hall, so fixated on you and your blonde hair that falls so perfectly in place and your grey eyes that hold so much more emotion than your willing to express. Your stupid smirk and your stupid arrogant attitude... all of it had been pulling me in for so long. And now with this realization, you were the only person I could think of... and your still the only person I can think of.
XxXxXxX
Neither of them sad a word, as they walked through the crowded corridor that held the Floo fireplaces in them. They both knew that the words they wanted to say at this moment, were not ones that they could express.
They both loved each other greatly.
“Do you want to dance, Harry? I didn’t spend all those months with teaching you to dance for nothing, you know.” Harry breath hitched in his throat as he nodded, and took a step towards Draco, who had his arms out waiting for Harry to come forward.
“Hermione?” He said, standing up, looking at the girl who seemed shocked to even hear Harry’s voice. He hadn’t spoken to her since she asked him if he had everything for their year at Hogwarts earlier that morning.
“Harry.” She answered in a small hesitant voice. Harry stood there for a long moment, the tension high in the air. Harry couldn’t stand the tension and so he walked forward, pulling her into a long lasting, tight hug. His next words he said carefully, since these would be his last.
The minister gave Harry a sad look, knowing that the last part was a favor to him for saving the wizarding world.
“Mr. Malfoy, you do understand that when Harry said they use them to travel everywhere in these things, and this is a non-magic trip, it means that you will be riding in one again, correct?” Draco looked up at this and tried to hide the hated for this trip and that statement but he didn’t say anything back.
“Because I am? After the battle I stepped away to collect myself and then Malfoy came and we were talking and then this guy... he shot some spell at us making us both pass out. Then we woke up here... where is here exactly?”
After the Room of requirement, he walked out of the school halls to the small little hut that had smoke coming from even smaller chimney. Harry still remembered the look on Hagrids face when Harry had walked out into the cleaning deep in the forest, ready for death. He remembered how upset he had been. Hagrid, had been the first person to show Harry kindness. These were moments that Harry would cherish now, even as he set out to end his life.
“Well, I’ve been okay. It’s hard to be good when everyone is talking shit about your boyfriend. Or that your trying to find out the ‘sneaky thing’ he’s doing. Honestly, I wish I could be on your side. I hate being away from you or fighting against you.”
“Good. I’m happy your enjoyed it.” Draco said with a sense of satisfaction that he made Harry Potter scream his name.
“Potter, I am not that bad. If you want to see bad, you should meet my father. He’s the worst.” Draco’s voice had gotten a little quiet with that last statement and for the first time since Harry had met him in Madam Malkins, he heard emotion. True raw emotion, and not a snark or arrogance.
Even after Harry awoke, and defeated Voldemort, he still couldn’t find Harry. And when the Aurors came and took the remaining death eaters away, he hoped that Harry would keep his promise, and fight for him.
"Potter... stop trying to be hopefully. I get that it's hard for Harry Potter to give up hope and stop fighting. It's your best quality. But Potter, dont you see? There's nothing to be hopeful about anymore... all our friends abandoned us, the world hates us both and now we're stuck in here together and there is no way out. And we can't even touch each other... we are forever going to be alone... so stop being hopeful.. just stop!"
Their signal was a simple hand gesture that they made each other when they needed comfort. They both made sure they were looking at each other, and then they made the move. Whatever that were doing, they immediately found some way to sneak off to be alone. Harry was grateful for it.
“I didn’t stop talking to you because your name was pulled out of the Goblet. Not like Weasley did. I didn’t make the buttons to humiliate you either. I did them because...” Draco paused and stop moving.
The words came out of his mouth like silk. For Harry, at this moment, they were just words. For Draco, the person whose soul wasn’t being slowly ripped from his body, it meant the world to him. His heart hammered in his chest and he tended up, not believing he had just actually heard that.
He couldn't tell anyone how long he had been there hugging the body. Only that when he looked up once more, he was wiping his tearful eyes with his now blood stained sleeve. They were in the Wizengamot court room. Draco wasn't dead anymore. He was sitting him a chair in the center of the room. Everyone they knew was watching Draco as he sat there.
“ it wasn’t just those. You were also a death eater who wanted me dead... I knew I had feelings for you, but I had never know how strong they were. I hadn’t realized my sadness had gotten so bad... I just dealt with it. You were with me everyday when we caught the dark creatures and I ignored the signs because no matter how much I fell for you, nothing could stop it. But I couldn’t say anything because... if I did there was a chance you would run away. And I couldn’t have you run away from me.”
He placed his wand on the ground, he didn’t need it where he was going. He would never need it again. He stood up, his mind completely content with what was about to happen, and he took his small walk to the edge, more than ready to give into death. He wasn’t scared. In fact, he was perfect fine. He had died before. Death wasn’t scary. It was peaceful. It was as if the world was no longer on his shoulders. And that was what he longer for. It was what he craved more than anything in the world. It was what he was ready to face. He closed his eyes, ready to take his last step of the edge.
“I am not going anywhere. I survived Voldemort three times now, a giant spider who wanted to eat me, and a basilisk. I’m okay. See? I’m still here, and I’m still alive. You can stop worrying. I’m alright.”
That lead them back to the Dueling Club, and how Draco Malfoy, in attempts to make it better for Harry, shot a snake out of his wand. The snake was going to attack Justin Flinch-Fletchley, a hufflepuff.
“See something you like Harry?” He had asked and Harry had blushed crimson red at the remark.
Exactly one month after Draco had been sent to Azkaban, Harry found out he was pregnant and with twins.
Five years after Draco had been sent to Azkaban, he was released, told that he was a brave man for what he did.
“Can we... can we do this again? Like not tonight... but in the future? Like on a regular basis?” Deaco looked over at the nervous Harry, and nodded.
Draco wasn’t sure who had dominance over who as they both seemed to fight over it. Harry had pushed his tongue into Dracos mouth, immediately meeting Dracos in this very suddenly hungry fight for the dominance. Which didn’t surprise Draco one bit. They were both strong, stubborn boys who wanted to be in charge. And as much as Draco wanted to give into Harry’s dominance, he wanted Harry to really experience this. This was his first gay moment and Draco knew what to do.
“Bloody hell... your Harry Potter!” She said with an disbelief. The girl ran forward and grabbed hold of Harrys arm. She looked over Malfoy, realizing who he was and grabbing his arm as well. “We need to find my mother!” She said and began dragging them through the corridors, up staircases, in a school that was completely rebuilt as if nothing happened.
There was so much anger and emotion in Dracos voice, that Harry hadn’t actually noticed that Draco was on the brink of tears. He couldn’t see that Dracos eyes held tears in them, threatening the burst out.
No one said a word.
“Mom.” The girl said loudly and every head in the room turned to look at the girl and the two boys. The teacher at the front of the room was the one that Harry was looking at though.
Finally his legs moved and he feel to the ground next to the lifeless body, hugging the boy to his chest, not caring that he clothes were being stained by the dead boys body. Tears feel from his eyes as he sobbed, letting out pleads for Draco to stay with him.
“You don’t see how awful you are to listen to? You sound exactly like a spoiled Prat. And yes, I know what one sounds like. I had to live with a muggle spoiled pear for 11 years of my life. He got whatever he wanted by complaining about it. And he was rude. Especially to me. And honestly, your almost an exact image of the boy except for looks. Now, can we go and find this unicorn so we can get out of here?” Draco rolled his eyes and nodded.
They made it to their abandoned classroom, either one not saying a word as they enter. Draco looked at Harry up and down, and Harry did the same. Then their eyes met.
Having this in mind, he felt like the rest of the day going to be a blur. But it wasn’t. But it wasn’t. Instead, it felt more lively than anything that he had ever experienced.
“Malfoy, it was a war for Merlins sake. A war that no one wanted to fight in. A war, that he were both forced into. Hermione? She was there because she wanted to be. Ron? He was there because he wanted to be. You and me, we were forced into it. And it’s not right that the two people that know exactly what it was like shouldn’t be close. Am I wrong?”
There was always more to the story than what the two had allowed others to see. Much more than the world ever would know. Even their closest friends would never know about it all.
He continues to trust until he felt the walls of Harry’s arse tighten around his cock, and he looked down to see Harry exploding white ropes of come all over there stomach. It was the hottest thing he had ever scene. It didn’t compare though to the sight of Harry’s face as he screamed Dracos name, his whole body tense under Dracos as he orgasmed.
"Potter... I don't know what to tell you... if I don't do this, they will kill me. I don't have another option." Harry stared and Draco not saying anything. An annoyed sound come from the Weasley who was standing to the side of Draco.
Draco heard the sob, and immediately moved to comfort the crying man.
It’s said that one of the worst moments in your life would feel like someone was ripping out a part of your soul, leaving you forever change by that event.
Harry made a soft noise against their lips as Draco began returning the kiss. The noise drove right through Draco like tone of weight. He went right down to his pelvic region and he knew he was done for. All rational thinking was down the drain. He needed this boy kissing him back. He needed those rough, chapped lips on his. And he needed to stay this way for as long as possible.
He loved Harry Potter.
Draco didn’t speak as their drinks got to them. He knew Harry was right. He had come out here with Harry in hopes to actually make something from this.
It should have been a celebration. To most it was. Harry couldn’t the same reaction to the end though. Not when he looked around at all aftermath of what had really gone down. Hogwarts, the place he had called home for so long, was destroyed. Rubble and debris of the once strong standing castle, covered almost every inch of the courtyard in which he stood.
They walked in, finding a table towards the back, and ordered their drinks. Harry ordered a pint of ale, while Draco ordered a Strawberry Margarita. Harry chuckled when the drinks were ordered and they were waiting for them to get them.
“Why am I not surprised that Draco Malfoy is a fan of fruity drinks?” Harry said, laughing at Draco’s eye rolling. “Hey, I’m only joking with you. Lighten up a little, Malfoy. We have been around each other all year so far. And we’re only three months in. Don’t you think that maybe, we should maybe try to make the most of it?”
Against ever fiber of him that coursed with fear, he told them that Harry wasn't who they thought he was and was instructed to bring Harry and the Weasley down to the dungeons.
That night he didn't become a murderer.
“You know what you are Potter? Selfish.” He spat out in a tone one would think was disgust, but Harry knew better. Draco always sounded this way. “You think life is so bad that you could just end it all, leaving all the people who fought to keep you alive? What are you even thinking? That life for Harry Potter is so bad now that the war is over and he can finally live a normal life?” Harry watch as Draco moved over Harry, hovering over him.
That's not what happened when he found his soulmate.
This time is was Draco’s turn to stop.
“I wouldn’t expect you to understand.” He snapped and Harry stopped again. He stared at Draco with a sad smile.
“Maybe I do. But right now, we both need to get to potions. You know how much Snape hates me being late. I would rather not be late anymore.”
“Yes?”
Harry smiled that smile that made the tipsy Dracos heart race in his chest.
The boy was trembling as he held his wand up. Harry knew he didn’t want to kill him. He wished that something would come up, and Draco wouldn’t have to do it.
“Harry,” he grabbed the mans chin, and pulled it up to look at him. Their eyes meet, both glazed over from the tears. “My love, we still have one week together before I have to leave. We were granted this small little moment to say our goodbyes, so how about we enjoy it. We can start by eating dinner, and then we can go get ready for bed. Okay?”
That’s how the train ride was. He remained silent as he left the train compartment behind his friends, who all looked at him with doleful looks in their eyes. They felt sorry for him. No one stayed long enough to stop and talk to him though. He was sure that everyone had given up by now. Maybe in the beginning they had tried, but at some point everyone had come to terms that, Harry, was a lost cause, and they stopped.
They made their way to the muggle hotel, their small suitcases for the weekend put into the respective rooms. Pansy and the professor being the only two females shared a room, Blaise in a room alone and Harry and Draco sharing a room.
With that, he leaned forward, meeting Draco’s lips in a soft kiss. Draco was completely taken aback, but once he realized what was happening, he kissed Harry back. And they didn’t pull away from each other until they both were out of breath.
“Harry, look at me please. Please, look at me.” Harry still didn’t budge. He spoke though. His words filled the air as he did.
That wasn’t even close to the start of their crazy year though. Not when people were being petrified.
The look of hate that painted the blondes face was more terrifying than Voldemort trying to kill him once again. Yet, Draco raised his wand, and a green light surrounded him while the words echoed in Harry's mind until they vanished entirely.
“I just lost my virginity to Draco Malfoy. How do you think it was?” He said with a laugh. He could tell Draco was annoyed with his little eye roll but the just smiled. “Of course, Draco. It was bloody fucking amazing... it was everything I had imagined it to be in my head.” This made Draco smile.
Draco noticed Harry wasn’t kissing back and he opened his eyes, moving back, looking completely embarrassed. He stared at Harry, who was staring right back in shock, both of them staying like this for a long moment.
He made it to his final destination, the astronomy tower. Albus Dumbledore had died in here. It was only fitting that the man who had used Harry, built him up to be nothing but a human weapon, would die in the same place Harry Potter did. Harry walked over to the railing, looking down at the ground below. He hoped that his fall wouldn’t be that bad. Maybe he would look like Albus had on that day. Maybe he would be found and everyone would raise their wands to the fallen hero, giving their respect for the boy who gave it his all.
Inside Draco a small spark of hope lit its way into his heart.
Ronald Weasley had also declined. He had been one of the few wizards who had been offered into the Auror training program. And he took it while Harry told the boy that he was done fighting the bad guys.
That seemed to break Harry out of his trance. Harry looked at the real Draco and then back at the boy in the corner and back again.
He stared across the room to where Draco was sitting next to Pansy. He had been avoiding eye contact until this moment. He had avoiding all glances in his direction. Looking at him, and knowing he couldn’t have him, made him sad.
Even though their relationship from the beginning was one they kept private, Harry always felt like he could talk to Draco more than he could the other two. Where Ron and Hermione were the ones who would go with him on his daring adventures, Draco was the one who talked about all the emotional things. The things the other two would never actually understand.
Luckily, a centaur that lived in the forest came and rescued them.
“Malfoy, I don’t expect you to understand this, but muggles are actually a lot like wizards. Someone are extremely awful. For example, in the muggle world my relatives were awful. In the wizarding world, your awful. But there are nice ones. Like some of my teachers back there and there are more than enough nice wizards here. The only difference is that we can do magic and they cannot. It doesn’t make us better, and it definitely doesn’t make them useless.”
"Potter, kindly shut up before I make you shut up." Harry felt like there was a hole burning through his chest. He didn't even like Draco... did he? Why was the appearance of Draco hurting him?
Living in the Manor had become a thing of survival to Draco. He couldn't count the amount of times he had taken the Cruciatus curse because the dark lord was just in one of his moods. He learned that the more time he spent in his room the better. During the day he couldn't put up his silencing charm, but he found that his little melody was able to calm him enough to stay strong until night time.
Harry didn’t actually believed the words he was hearing come from Draco. Draco actually didn’t hate him all these years? His mind was still processing this when Draco continued.
Something in Harry seemed to stick with those words. They dug deep into him, making him realize how stupid it was to want to end it all when there were people who had it worse, like Draco. Suddenly, he didn’t want to die. And he felt rather silly for planning this out to actually end it all. But realizing he didn’t want death, brought all the tidal waves of emotions he had been ignoring for so long, to come out like a tsunami. Instantly, he to was sobbing.
“Malfoy, do you ever stop talking and listen to yourself?” Harry sais after he had enough listening to the boy ramble on and on. He just couldn’t take it anymore.
XxXxXxX
"Your right... there's no point." He said quietly and moved back towards the wall away from Draco. The room grew quiet as he sat there, staring emotionless out the small little window.
His normal, was trying to convince himself that the next day would be better. His normal, was waking up every morning, trying to find reason to be getting up again, just to fake a smile and force a laugh. His normal, was trying to figure out what his purpose was. Because day after day the last two months, he had come to a realization that his life is nothing but normal. His life is an agonizing pain that never ends.
“Harry, I love you so much. I have for years now. I wish I would have known. Nothing in the universe will ever make you run grind me, got it?” Harry smiled at the reassuring Draco.
A trip to the Great hall confirmed that either his soulmate wasn't at this school or they weren't 17 yet. With that knowledge, he began to take comfort in his own little personal song that only played for him.
Harry immediately decided that the best course of action was to lay down on the bed that was his and because there was literally nothing to do, he spent about ten minutes trying to decide if he wanted to talk to Draco. Every minute he would turn, look at Draco for a long moment, looking like he was trying to figure something out, and then look away.
“Thank you, Draco. It means a lot you say that.” They sat in the room and talked for about another hour, which was as long as they were usually allowed to without someone getting suspicious.
Draco let go of Harry’s hand, and brought him into a tight hug. Even the warm embrace of the boys body next to his could make this moment better. It did help though that they got this moment. And that they had a week before Draco was to be dropped off to Azkaban and not seen again for 15 years.
It wasn’t until after he came back from the dead for a second time, that he believed the world to actually be a cruel, unjust place for not letting it end. It wasn’t until a week or so after the end of the war, that he sat up one night, telling himself that the end was near for him. He thought a lot about death at that point. To the point that he knew how he wanted to die.
Harry as to laugh at the last part of the statement. “Oh really, Malfoy? Then how did I get into detention?” He asked with a raised eyebrow. The boy seemed to back down when he realized Harry was right.
“Malfoy,” he started with a laugh, “this is how muggles get around. And some of us have been riding in muggle vehicles since before I was walking. Cars, aren’t that bad once you get used to them.” Draco looks at the ‘car’ and groans.
The train was a rather quiet one, as Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger sat in their compartment, making their way to their eighth and final year of Hogwarts. If you asked Harry, he didn’t want to be here. After the war, Harry feel into a deep depression that unfortunately, he still wasn’t out of. But there was only so long that he could sit in the Grimmauld Place, getting drunk on some cheap muggle brand whiskey, and drink his pain and sorrows away, day after day.
They ended up at a bar in the middle of muggle London, one that was busy, it being a Friday night and all.
“We find that Draco Malfoy is guilt for his crimes against the ministry of magic. He will be sentenced to 15 years in Azkaban. We do grant the notion, that Harry James Potter keep him until the end of the death eater trials in one week.”
After the trip ended, they came back and for a few months, no one but the people in the muggle studies class knew why Harry and Draco had suddenly become so close. Only they knew that when Harry and Draco had suddenly disappeared, it was because they were hidden away from the world.
Harry realized that their relationship meant a lot more than Ron’s and Hermione’s the following summer. Draco had been sending letters to Harry for weeks and finally, he couldn’t take the worry anymore. Draco had heard all about how those rotten muggles had treated Harry, and now he was worried.
They quickly made their way to their hotel room, locking the door firmly behind them. Draco took no time at all to push Harry against the door and begin snogging him senseless. Now, being in a room alone with Harry Potter as they both couldn’t keep their hands off each other, Draco wasn’t afraid to make noise. In fact, he groaned loudly when Harry bucked his hips forward, meeting Draco restricted member.
Draco wanted to see him.
At this, his want was to great. He needed Harry in more ways than just kissing. He pushed Harry down onto the bed, crawling onto of the boy. He moved his lips down from Harry’s lip to the soft spot next to Harry’s ear, nibbling on his ear lobe, earning a moan in response.
"Please what?" Harry was startled. He looked around the darkness around him in this new setting. There was a small window providing almost no light at all but after a moment he noticed a set of blonde hair sticking up.
XxXxXxX
“Potter.” Harry waved off Hermione and Neville, who walked away cautiously, leaving Draco and Harry alone.
They got that much correct. It sounded beautiful as a child. Intricate fantasy's fueled by innocent imaginations was a normal occurrence. Boys and girls dreaming about a day when their one and only will come and make their life complete. The imaginations grow past childhood as perception of reality was discovered and still, their expectations for what it will be like never fade, never tarnishing.
Draco realized that he was wrong before. He did deserved a soulmate and as of today, he was going to fight for that soulmate.
“How was that? You know for your first time?” Draco asked after minutes of calming down and pulling out, spelling them both clean wandlessly. Harry looked over and Draco, still in a daze.
It turns out that it's true.
Draco Malfoy, the once arrogant, annoying Prat, looked not so arrogant and not so annoying. He knew that the boy had not done well with the end results of the war. His hair was no longer in a gelled, combed back do. His skin was paler than usual and this eyes were so black from the lake of sleep. He looked like the walking dead, which Harry didn’t doubt he himself looked like.
They walked in silence for a little before Draco spoke up again.
"Finally going to finish off the job?" He asked the one that had long blonde hair poking out. He knew who it was. The Malfoy took of the mask and Harry's heart stopped. It wasn't Lucius. It was Draco.
“I might not remember much after I come out, Harry. The dementors, they are said to make one go crazy. I just hope I’ll be sane enough to read about what we once had.”
“Remember, relax okay? It’s going to be painful right away, but remember to relax and it will go away.” He waited for Harry’s nods of acknowledgment before he allowed himself to push pass the entrance into Harry’s tight arse.
The walk into the castle was also one he had expected. This one though, holding not so fond feelings. The last time he had walked through these halls, he had been fighting for his death. And nothing in the world could vanish the sorrow and emptiness that came as they walked in. This was also why he had chosen to do this here. This was a reminder that what he was doing, what he was going to do later that night, was destined to happen.
Everyone else eventually left the room, leaving the boy sobbing into him arms, alone.
Draco glared at Harry. “Did you just compare me to a muggle?” He crossed his arms and Harry laughed at this.
XxXxXxX
“I think that we should do that again. Like all the time.” Harry said with a small laugh. Draco grinned and chuckled along side Harry’s laugh.
And yet, nothing could stop it.
"Harry, you don't understand any of this. Just because you make the song inside me complete, it doesn't mean that I can run off with you. I want to. Believe me I do. Anything to get me out of here. Anything to save me from this place... Merlin, I would do anything for that." He paused as actual tears were filling his eyes.
Harry spent more time focusing on Draco’s nearly naked body and the look of his hair when it was wet. He could barely keep his eyes off him. Draco even teased him about it.
"Draco, you have become a death eater?" The long haired death eater snares at him. Harry can't understand why this is bothering him so badly.
"What? Thought that the world revolves around you? Thought that your name meant that we all actually liked you? Don't you get it? We only pretended to like you because of your name." Harry looked at Ron, the boy who was his best friend.
The next to go was Ron. He just stood up and looked at Harry. He scratched his head awkwardly. “I’m”going to bed. Do you... are you going to bed now?”
Harry turned around, not wanting to continue this conversation. He began walking again, and Draco followed, only he wasn’t done with this.
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
They also said that the melody is not just a melody. That the melody is in fact one piece to a song that is waiting to be finished. It can't be finished alone though. Somewhere out there is someone else hearing a different version of the same Melody and when they meet, the melodies will collide into one beautifully, heart-warming, composed symphony that they will hear for the rest of their life.
“Draco.” He said, right before Draco attacked Harry with a bone-crushing hug.
Harry gasped in pain at the intrusion and Dracos breath came out heavy and ragged as he tried to keep himself together as he pushed further in slowly. He didn’t stop until he was seated all the way into Harry, stopping there as he gave Harry time to adjust to him.
It all started when Hermione decided that it would be a good idea to bring them all to the Dueling Club. It was supposed to teach them how to defend themselves, considering people were people petrified. Of course, there were rumors that it was Harry, though Harry didn’t understand why.
It was clear that Draco didn’t talk about this often. There was a war going on inside the boys head, and it was obvious to Harry that maybe this was a touchy subject. He didn’t want to press forward into a conversation that Draco didn’t want to talk about. So he went to say so, but as his mouth opened to speak, Draco spoke.
Before he knew it, dinner was over and they were all walking back to the eighth year dorms. Everyone in the eighth year had been put into one dorm, all adults, all exceptions that were able to come back. Boys were in one room, girls in the other. Harry’s bed was placed in the middle of Ron’s and Nevilles bed. Draco and Blaise Zabini were on the others sides of Ron and Neville.
A Somniatus was one of the most dangerous creatures there was. Not many had heard of them because anyone who had, usually died before they could tell the story. They are small little creatures that find their way into the house of a sad, lonely depressed person, and they begin becoming one with the house. They grow and grow and grow, feeding off the negative energy, no one knowing they are there, until it's to late.
“How on earth can you stand being in there... Merlin, that was bloody awful.” He said after he was done retching his insides out. Harry and the Professor shrugged. To them it was nothing.
“Potter, why did you live with muggles? Aren’t they awful?” Harry spun around so fast and walked closer to Draco with a fiery of emotions.
Not that it mattered.
“In fourth year, I was extremely awful to you because I was jealous. And so I made all the buttons that said you suck because you were getting all this attention. I knew deep down you wouldn’t actually do it, put your name in the goblet. But it was so easy to make you angry and so easy to pick on you. It came like second nature at this point. But then, I watched you nearly die after dragon chased you to what I thought was going to be your death. And I realized something.
Draco never said a word. He listened in horror to the stories and questioned why on earth he was here in the first place. Most days he hoped that Harry Potter would come and defeat the vile man and save the wizarding world so that Draco could be free from this hell. Even if he knew that he would spend the rest of his sad life in Azkaban, but anything was better than this.
They had made a good distance away from the commotion of the dinning room when Harry stopped walking.
The best part of it all, was his eyes though. The boys grey eyes glimmered perfectly in the light that shone around them. And those eyes were staring straight back at him. He couldn’t look away. He couldn’t find the strength to look anywhere but those eyes.
“I would do anything to be you. Or to be your friend. And thats the saddest realization of my life. You rejected me. Everyone in the wizarding world used to play the little game were they were Harry Potter defeating the bad guy. It was normal for kids especially when we were growing up since you were our age. And then I messed up being being awful to you, and I knew I had, but instead of just saying I was sorry, I pushed you further away by being a wild to literally everyone. Yet the entire time, I hated myself for losing the opportunity to be your friend.”
The ride to the castle, was exactly how he would want his last trip to be. The glow of the castle off in the distance, slowly get closer and closer was why he had done this. Hogwarts has always been his home. No matter how crazy his life was there, he always come back to the school with the sense of calmness. He could picture that first night his first year, when the lights had Illuminated off the lake in dancing, shimmering beauty. He remembered the feeling and even now, in the final hours of his life, he looked back at how excited and nervous he had been. He was envious of the innocence of that younger boy.
The war was over.
They still had their hands firmly grasping  the others, and they both were still processing the reality of what had just happened.
What did he do with his time afterwards?
They made it to the dinning room and the doors were thrown open in front of him with a flick of a wand. Time seemed to freeze the moment it did.
Draco raised his brow in confusion. “What do you mean, Potter?” A server came around replacing Dracos and Harrys now empty glasses.
“So that’s it Potter? Your just going to jump off the side of the astronomy tower and end it all? Is life so bad being the bloody savior, getting all the attention one could ask for, that he has to end it all like this?”
“Harry, why didn’t you ever say that you were lonely and depressed? And why didn’t you ever tell me how much I meant to you? Not just anyone’s biggest fear is seeing me in Azkaban. Or apparently seeing me die.” He patiently waited for Harry to answer him.
The next place he went to, was the room of requirement. He paced in front of the door until it opened, walking into the all to familiar room that he had once held the DA meetings at. He had loved this room. This small little sanctuary that hide him from the god awful lady in Pink, Dolores Umbridge. Everyone had loved Harry teaching them all. And this was was the room Harry had gotten his first kiss, even if he didn’t like the girl to much in the end.
Malfoy stepped into the classroom, nodding his head in agreement to what Harry said.
“Wait, so you like me?” Draco asked with a pleased, relieved smile.
Harry took no time to stand up. He watched from the corner of his eye as Draco stood up, and walked away from Pansy who was having an intense conversation with Blaise and his date.
He had made a complete fool of himself in front of everyone. The four Triwizard champions had to go out in the floor in front of everyone and dance. Even after hours of Draco dancing with him in the abandoned classroom, way passed the time they were supposed to be out, he still managed to completely mess up. He felt bad for Parvati Patil, as he stepped on her feet multiple times.
Draco took the hand and shook it.
“Harry?” Draco asked before he left. Harry looked at the boy and nodded.
“Really? That’s what you took from that? That I compared you to a muggle? Not the fact that your on of the worst wizards I’ve met so far. Your actually before Professor Snape and that’s saying something.”
“Harry, are you okay? I heard what happened yesterday. He didn’t hurt you, did he?” Draco bombarded Harry with questions, none that were answered, since Draco wouldn’t let him speak.
"No one will ever love you Harry Potter. Don't you see that? Your unloveable." He looked towards the voice and saw the red haired Weasley staring down at him with such hate it broke his heart.
“Why did you stop Potter?” Draco asked the boy and Harry just shook his head and continued on.
But the end of the day and the end of dinner, Draco was more than ready to go out and see what it was like to drink at a muggle bar. He wanted to talk to Harry, ask him more questions about muggle technology and if he was lucky, he could talk to Harry as if they weren’t enemies before. As if they didn’t just come out of a war in opposing sides.
Harry was at a complete lose of words, but Draco wasn’t done yet. And Harry, no matter what he was feeling, which was confused, couldn’t find the courage to say anything. Not when he had been caught on the verge of death. Draco walked up to Harry, grabbed his shirt and threw him away from the edge where Harry had been standing, not caring that Harry feel to the floor in a heap.
Draco, knew more about Harry than anyone else in the school. That included Ron and Hermione.
The both of them couldn’t stop thinking about the other. They both wanted to spend all the time they could with each other, yet given the opportunity, it was awkward and they barely said a word to each other.
Draco Malfoy stood at the door looking at Harry with a curious look.
He confronted Draco and Draco just shrugged it off. He felt like Draco was get distant and with all his very new confused feelings for Draco, he was hurt.
That’s was the deal. And even after Draco got the dark mark, Draco still told Harry everything.
“I don’t remember much anymore. But this boy... if I look away... he will disappear. I-I saw him. He was in... in a bathroom. And he was almost dead. And... I couldn’t save him from the room with all the people. They took him here. And then I got put here because... I killed all the people I cared about. And now... all that matters is this boy. If I look away, he might die. Or maybe I will die. He told me to give up. That it didn’t matter anymore. I should give up. But this boy needs me.”
Draco realized what it was after he had started blocking out Harry, in hopes the feeling would go away, that it wasn’t going away. And the first task creeped up on them, and Draco was in the stands watching Harry face off a living, fire-breathing dragon who wanted Harry dead. His heart was racing the entire time, and afterwards, he found a moment where Harry was alone, and nearly scared Harry to death when he pulled him into a little hidden alcove. He hugged Harry tightly and cried, apologizing over and over and over again.
From the back side, her brown hair was one the was so familiar he could tell it from a mile away. Only, the body didn’t seem to match the hair.
There's something they didn't explain about soulmates.
Harry shook his head. “No.” He said shortly, the red head, his first ever friend, only looked away as if this didn’t surprise him. “Ron?” Harry said stopped him from walking away.
Keeping face around Draco in public though, was getting harder, since the boy was now the seeker for the slytherin quidditch team. Draco would always ignore Harry for about two or three days afterwards, until he was ready talk. Which usually resulted in Draco bringing him chocolate his mother made for him.
His luck couldn’t be worse.
He hated it all.
“I missed you too. How have you been? How is in the Inquisitorial squad going?” He asked him softly as they cuddle.
“Harry, I hope that you don’t hit me for this.” He leaned into Harry, took the boys face into his arms and pulled the boy into a kiss. It wasn’t nearly the kiss he would have wanted for a first kiss, but saving Harry for a demon monster was worth it.
“Your house. It’s been invaded by a Somniatus.” Harry stared at Draco with wide eyes.
They call it soulmates.
After the trail for Draco had ended, Harry and Draco were allowed to walk off. They were allowed to go to Harry’s home, Grimmauld Place, where Harry would ‘keep watch’ of the man until it was time for him to be locked away in Azkaban.
Maybe, that was what he needed. Maybe, it wasn’t why he needed. Maybe, it was really that he needed to get out of that dark, dreary home that once joked that once housed his godfather, Sirius Black, the man who had been one of the closest people to a father figure he would ever come to have. Maybe, just maybe, he didn’t need time, because there was nothing that could truly fix what had happened.
That was the night that Draco Malfoy realized that a soulmate was a blessing to those who deserved them. And he, Draco Malfoy did not deserve one.
Everyone has a soulmate.
Then Draco went and made buttons that said Potter stinks and completely humiliated Harry.
Harry was more than ready to go to bed after the crazy day he had.
Harry frowned. “I know this. But remember, we’ll get through this, and when we do, you and me won’t be a secret anymore. I am going to shout it out to the world that your mine. We’re going to do all the things we have talked about. Get married, have children. They’re going to have your hair and my eyes, and I’m going to love them to death. We will get through this, okay?”
Who would want to be denied their soulmate? Especially when the thought of being loved endlessly was something any sane person would hope for in their lives.
“Why do you say that? What makes him so bad?” He asked, not stopping as he talked. He didn’t want Draco to actually see that he was curious.
Finally, it was over.
Even Draco had told Harry how he didn’t understand it.
But Draco did. Draco understood what Harry felt and not only that, he was able to comfort Harry like no one had been able to before.
Draco continue to stare at Harry in shock as he took his all in. Harry was good looking. He had known this for a very long time. Would it be okay to lean forward and press his lips to those appetizing ones? Would it be okay to get so lost in snogging this boy that his finger got tangled in that absolutely hot mess of hair on his head? Or to have Harrys body pressed to his as they got lost in the moment?
“Thank you. For being my friend.” He said in quiet tone, so much feeling seeping through the words.
Draco listened to Harry and he felt weird listening to Harry pour out his heart to him when the boy didn’t even trust his friends to understand. It made him feel like for once, maybe the boys had something in common. Draco opened his mouth to say something, but Harry wasn’t done talking yet.
“I can try.” He said quietly, looking like he was contemplating something important. And when he made his decision he looked nervous. “I want to try something. Do you trust me?” Harry stared for a moment before nodding. “Okay. Close your eyes.”
"Draco! It's you! Thank Merlin it's you!" He rushed o we to the boy only to be held back inched away from him by the chains. Harry looked at Draco hopelessly.
“Yes... but there’s more.” He went quiet for a moment before requesting another drink, this time something strong. Draco watched as the boy took multiple shots of some kind of yellowish drink.
“Merlin, your so tight...” he whispered at the boy who had closed his eyes to rid the pain. Harry stayed this way for a moment. “Your so... big... Merlin your so fucking big Draco.” Draco wanted to start moving at these words, fuck him hard and fast, but he waited. Until Harry opened his eyes. “Move Draco... please move...” he urged him. Draco didn’t need to be told twice.
To his relief, it was Snape that killed Dumbledore. Draco and Snape ran off, but not before Harry noticed a gold band in his wrist. The band that was going to keep him and Harry in contact after this.
In front of him, on his knees was no doubt Harry Potter with a lump on his head that made him appear disfigured. He couldn't focus on Harry's appearance. Someone could come in and Crucio him over and over again until he was just a breathing, mindless body that they would float over the table like some kind of constellation prize and Draco could care less.
Draco didn’t look Harry in the eyes, but nodded. “I just don’t understand it, I guess. In a way I do, a little. Wars are said to have lasting side effects, usually meaning that most involved in the war, suffer from depression and - well, suicidal thoughts. Feeling like you didn’t do enough to save the people you fought with. Not doing enough to end things. Or sometimes it’s just because you didn’t make the right choices, like me. But Potter, That’s not the reason I don’t understand.”
He always imagined the ending of the war being one of happiness and relief. But instead, all he was filled with anger and grief.
“I tried to start multiple conversations with you to talk about all this. I mean, we share a room together, we have every class together, and we’re partners in almost every single one of them. But when I try to talk to you, you are quiet and moody that I’m even talking to you.”
Time passed slowly Inside this room. It was a never ending nightmare as he stared at the boy on the other side. He couldn’t stop staring. This was all his fault. Harry could have stopped it. He could have saved him. He blamed himself for all of this and nothing anyone could say could change his mind.
Before they went out for their first planned event of the day, they were given thirty minutes to relax. Draco didn’t understand why they needed to ‘relax’. He didn’t want to be stuck with Harry alone in an enclosed space for any long period of time that wasn’t absolutely necessary.
Without another thought, Harry put a finger on Draco’s mouth as he was opening it to speak. “Say no more, Draco. I feel the same.”
“I realized that I didn’t actually want to see you dead. Or see you hurt. And I didn’t really want to torment you. I found myself wanting to see you and I found myself thinking about you a lot. I found myself staring at you more than I had before. And because of this stupid little crush I had developed for you, I realized that I was gay. And I’m only telling you this because I have to marry someone to carry on the family line. That and,” Draco paused and not his lip. Harry’s heart raced, his mind spinning at the knowledge of Dracos feelings.
And not just in a friends way. He loved him as in, he wanted to kiss him and hold him. The realization hit him hard and he spent the following weeks accepting the fact that he was gay.
The news surprised everyone, but everyone was happy. Even when they found out whose it was. Harry had explained to everyone that Harry and Draco never hated each other. That they had been together for a while now.
“You know, I think that I know that aim going to ask you to do for me while I’m in Azkaban,” He stated and Harry looked at him curiously.
Malfoy seemed touched by this. He more into the room, closing a distance between Harry and him. “I don’t deserve that Potter. I don’t deserve your forgiveness.”
Harry looked at him confused, but Draco answered his question. “I have always been envious of you, you know. Though I wouldn’t show that to a living souls and if you ever tell anyone I will deny it to the day I die. But you had everything I ever wanted. People were proud of you for things you did, and all you had to do was be yourself. You didn’t have to try to show up, you didn’t need to get the best grades, you didn’t even need to save people. You were always looked up to by so many people and everyone wanted to be around Harry Potter.
“Merlin, Potter... need you so bad...” he said in between kissing as he rutted back against the boy, again they both groaned from the friction it caused. Harry smiled against Dracos lips. “Then take me Draco... fucking take me...”
“Potter... please tell me I’m dreaming...” Malfoy said next to him. Harry shook his head. “Your not dreaming Malfoy.”
The moment that something happened in the all but exciting life of Harry Potter, some how the wizarding world knew about it. Harry was always confused how people got a hold of this information at times, but in a world full of magic, nothing ever surprised him anymore.
Because that's not what it was like.
Then he saw it. The signal.
"Why are you doing this?" He asked in a low voice that sounded almost hurt. Draco stopped and looked at Harry and their eyes met.
Draco pulled Harry in again for another kiss. This one last a lot longer than the first and Harry was able to focus on how it felt to have the warm soft lips against his.
“I was alone most of the summer, most of it because I was in self loathing drunkenness. I didn’t want to leave the house at all. But being alone, made things a lot worse at times. So I decided to go to a bar. There had to be some kind of bar that would allow me to drink and be alone, but not really alone. So, I found the closest bar, and I went in. Turns out, it was a gay bar. Meaning that every man was making out with another man. It blew my mind honestly. I left rather quickly when I realized that watching them kiss... Merlin, I didn’t know that it could looks so appealing.
This was the moment he had waited for his entire life. It was supposed to be magical. He was supposed to run into his soulmates arms and life would make sense because they had each other.
“I realized something, Harry. And I don’t think I can keep it in any longer. Not after how you looked tonight. Not after watching you dance with some girl. I need to tell you this, and if you never want to speak to me again, I accept my fate.”

Entering his eighth year at Hogwarts, Draco Malfoy had come back knowing that he was required to take the muggle studies class as part of his punishment given at the postwar trails. Continue going to Hogwarts for his last year and take muggle studies. It had seemed pretty simple to him back then. That was before he got back to Hogwarts.
Draco smiled at him. “You’ve got this. Remember that.” And with that, he left the room.
“I always expected Harry Potter, savior of the wizarding world, to be the center of the celebration when it all ended. Expected for you to be eager for the attention.” Harry rolled his eyes at the remark and opened his mouth to say something only to find Malfoy wasn’t done.
“Potter, windless magic... is fucking hot as fuck...” he said against Harry’s lips.
It sounded like English to him.
XxXxXxX
Harry followed and pulled back enough to look at Draco’s face. He looked completely nervous. More nervous than Harry was.
He thought about this a moment, the name of Draco still fresh in his mind when he a loud whisper.
"In about 10 minutes Wormtail will come down to check on you. Whatever you do, take his wand from him. I'll take care of the rest." He turned and face away, ready to leave when Harry voice called him and he froze in place.
Time passed by Draco after that and the melody that ran in his head was the only thing that kept him strong through every single awful thing that was happening around him. The dark lord had moved into the Malfoy Manor and made it his home base. The walls became tainted with the dark magic that filled it. Days and nights passed but he didn't know which one was worse.
It had been over 10 years when Draco and Harry encountered their first one. Harry wasn't exactly present for it though. Not completely.
The last place he wanted to go to, before he went to place he would die, was the quidditch pitch. This was the one place, he had always felt the most free. But even quidditch had been tarnished. A few times in third year when the dementors were sucking out his soul, and then again when Harry had been banned from quidditch because of Umbridge. It was yet another reminder that all good things had to end.
“Rose, you better have a good reason to be interrupting my class.” Even the voice sounded like her. She turned and face the girl who was now known as Rose. Harry’s heart stopped.
“I saw you dance. I would say it’s better than it was when I first began teaching you?” Draco was getting closer to him, moving in perfect poise strides, and Harry’s heart was beating uncontrollably.
On June 5th 1997, Draco Malfoy woke up in the Slytherin common room to the sound of a violin mixed with a piano and cello, filling the what would usually be a dead room, with life. He listened to it all the way through until it looped into an endless song and that's were he sat for a long time, not getting enough of it. Somewhere out there, he had a soulmate. Somewhere out there, there was someone capable of loving Draco. His heart soared as he thought of who it might be.
He didn’t have time to answer any of his questions, because before he could think more about it and make a decision, Harry had moved forward, put a hand on Dracos cheek and met his lips with a soft, drunken kiss. It seemed very hesitant at first, since Draco was stunned at the sudden contact, but once Draco had realized what was happening, he kissed the boy back feverishly, all his questions left behind, no longer mattering.
Draco and Harry had both tripped over a tree root and the creature was coming closer and closer to them. There wasn’t a doubt in his mind that Draco wasn’t scared. He suddenly clung to Harry for dear life, while Harry grabbed his wand, not knowing a decent spell to protect them.
The next morning, Harry and Draco hadn’t shown up to the meeting spot the class was supposed to meet. The three decided to go and wake up the two only to find that they two were entangled into each other’s arms, sleeping peacefully. No one had the heart to wake the two up, so they threw continued their day without them.
“What did you say to me, Potter? Have a problem with the way I talk?” Harry stopped and stared at the boy as if he was really asking the obvious.
He wish he had known. Known that Snape we on his side. All these years, he had accused the man of being the bad guy, when really, he had always been there for him.
Everyone eventually did find out. It shocked everyone who hadn’t already known. Years passed and they got married and eventually had children together. And no one would have ever guessed that the rivals, would have ever become more than that.
The red headed girl let go of their arms and walked into the classroom, not caring that there was a class happening.
The first thing they did, was get back into those sickening muggle ‘cars’, and drove to this place called a ‘movie theater’. Draco didn’t exactly know what to expect, but they all decided to watch this comedy movie that ended up being quite funny, even for Draco. And the entire experience seemed to be an eye opener for Draco.
And that wasn’t even the worst of it! When they came back for their eighth year, they all got put in the eighth year dormitories, all being paired with one other student. Draco had been paired with the boy. And it was an absolutely nightmare. The boy had no boundaries when it came to dressing in front of the very gay, Draco. It was absolutely torture.
Harry never thought that when he decided to get away from everything that had just happened, that it would mean that Draco Malfoy of all people would be the one to come and comfort him. Oddly enough, he enjoyed someone who wasn’t crying over a death or celebrating. In fact, it felt as if he could actually relate to the blonde.
Draco and Harry told each other everything.
Draco didn’t answer right away. He stayed quiet for a long moment and even when he did speak, his voice sounded sad. Harry couldn’t stop himself from looking. The look on his face matched the boys voice. He looked lost in sorrow.
"Thank you Draco." Draco didn't have to turn around to see that Harry's green eyes were glowing with emotion. He didn't turn around immediately but smiled to himself, glad no one could see it for the moment.
Voldemort was gone.
“Also, after my parents died, I went to live with my mothers sister. I didn’t even know magic existed until my 11th birthday, when Hagrid had to come and get me from my aunt and uncle. I always thought I was a freak for being able to make strange things happen around me. Turns out that I was just a wizard, and thats why they treated me like they did. Everything I did was never right, and they made it known.”
Draco smiled. “I love you too, Harry.”
Harry was just about to say something when yet another voice entered the room. But this time, it wasn’t from his old school rival. This time it was from a figure with features he wouldn’t make out.
They needed Draco to confirm an identity for them. Only one word came to mind as he realized exactly whose identity they would need him to confirm.
They got all the way to a very familiar classroom. It was the defense against the dark arts classroom. And the door was open to a class that was being taught. Full of children they had never met.
And still, to this day, it’s said that they can be found together in their little abandoned classroom. Only this time, not in secret.
They both knew that Draco was being a spy to Voldemort, and they couldn’t risk him being found out. Draco’s mother and father would both die as well as Draco. And so Harry just dealt with it.
“I would like that Harry. I would like that a lot.” They both feel asleep on the bed together, Harry cuddling into Dracos chest, his body draped over Dracos. Both had the best nights sleep they had in a very long time.
“I want - I want the pain to go away. I want to learn to live my life. I want to learn things about myself that I didn’t know. Discover myself. I want to fall in love and laugh and go on spontaneous adventures that don’t end up in near death experiences. I want to learn to live.” He looked away for a moment before turning and to Draco. “Could you help me find those things? Could you teach me how to live my life to the fullest. To actually wake up wanting to be alive? Is that even possible?”
They got to Kings Cross station and they all made their way into the crowded muggle streets. Wands were not required the entirety of the trip so all their wands lay in a leather bag that the teacher kept from the students. No magic. And Draco was already scratching to be able to apparate to their hotel location.
“It’s hard to be down there isn’t? Hard to look at all of what happened and not... not feel...” He looked like he was lost for words, so Harry nodded, already understanding what was being said.
He had to pretend to not know his soulmate in hopes that he makes it out of this alive.
“I can’t get rid of it Potter. The mark. It won’t go away.” He moved his arms out to Harry, holding in front of him as he lifted the sleeve of his shirt up, revealing the tattoo. “I tried everything. I tried burned it off, I tried cutting it off. Nothing works. I will forever be a death eater. It will always be a reminder of the wrong side I was on and the awful decisions I made. And you over here wanting to die because of all the death that happened in a war you didn’t create.”
When Harry was called up to demonstrate, he wanted to die at that moment. Everyone was staring at him, and he hated the attention more than anything in the world.
He hated how everyone believed Voldemort wasn’t back.
The quiet of the room was to much for Draco, and he knew that Harry didn’t do well in silence.
Dracos body felt frozen. Time itself felt frozen. Was Harry Potter actually asking to go out in public and do something together? It didn’t seem very believable. How could it? Harry Potter wouldn’t want to go out with someone like Draco Malfoy. No even in the muggle world. And Draco was sure that Harry wasn’t gay so it wasn’t going in that direction either.
That was one thing he convinced himself of. The people who he cared about most, the ones that he knew would take his death the hardest, would move on. They could only be sad for the loss of Harry for so long before they had to quit grieving and move on. Hermione and Ron had each other and one day they would get married and they would have children. Ginny would most likely end up back with Dean Thomas and he knew they would both be happy together, no matter how often they fought. The rest of the Weasleys, they all had each other. Teddy, he had his grandmother Andromeda, besides, the boy didn’t even know Harry. He wouldn’t remember him after Harry was gone.
They began dancing like they normally would, except this time, they were both tense. Harry could feel Draco’s breath hitting his neck, causing Harry’s body to tense up even more.
"Mate, why are you talking to him? I would rather be locked up than look at this low life wizard." Draco ignored the comment and so did Harry. Harry shook his head.
Everything was perfect.
Even Harry spent a good 15 minutes lecturing Draco in how even in public, that word was not acceptable. Draco once again apologized.
“And what is that?” Harry asked breathlessly. He was surprised he was able to talk at all.
“That can’t be possible. A Somniatus would have had been in my house for at least a decade...” The realization of the situation hit him hard. He had been so lonely and depressed that he had attracted an actually monster.
Draco sighed and once again brought Harry into a hug. “I don’t think I’ll ever stop worrying about you, Harry. It seemed you have a thing for danger.” Harry laughed softly and hugged Draco back tightly.
In the front of the room stood the one and only Hermione Granger. And she looked like she was 20 years older than she had been before they had been hit by the spell.
