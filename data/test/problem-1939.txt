Malfoy sighed. "Look, don't get all… I was going to say that I had never kissed a male. That's all."
"Fuck you. You are so," Malfoy said, glaring, but there wasn't as much pith to it as there could have been.
"I didn't know I was signing myself up for a lifetime of paperwork," Harry snapped. At Lupin's expression, he instantly regretted the loss of temper, but he was angry enough not to take it back. Besides, his inner voice said, it's too late now, anyway. He pushed his glasses up and tiredly pinched the bridge of his nose.
With Malfoy disguised as a woman in public, there was no pressure in terms of having to come out or behaving exactly as he wanted in public: they could pass off all of the small touches and looks and exchanges of any straight couple and no one was the wiser. It became almost a joke between them, Malfoy shaking back his long hair to wink at Harry before ghosting a kiss over one cheek. It wasn't outwardly all that different from the way it had been before, when it was nothing but an assignment to Harry, but the way he felt about it had changed. The assignment now became a shield between what was happening and what Harry would eventually have to decide about it, a smoke screen of sorts.
It was as though he hadn't spoken. Malfoy, already striding furiously toward the door, didn't even pause. Harry threw the strongest locking charm he knew of at it, and was satisfied when Malfoy couldn't get past it. "Have a seat," he repeated. "We're not through."
While they were buying groceries that afternoon (for Harry this time), Pig came fluttering by (in broad daylight, as usual) and dropped a short scrawl in front of Harry before taking off again. Muttering to himself, Harry retrieved it and broke the seal to read it.
Potter looked at him properly for the first time, eyes nearly unveiled. "Actually, I'm still using magic - just carefully. But I did grow up with electricity, yes." He pushed a chair out with one foot. "Have a seat, if you like."
She rolled her eyes in disgust. "That's a ridiculous analogy. And most people hate beans, for the record."
Potter's seeming good mood had vanished. "There was nothing nice about it." He stood abruptly. "Thanks for the drink. I'll see you later."
"Don't call me that!" Potter snapped. "I can understand friends, Malfoy, but why would you do this to me?"
Malfoy refused to answer, turning his back on Harry to undress. In his briefs, he stalked over to the bathroom, but when he reached the bedroom doorway, he suddenly stopped and looked back, catching Harry's guilty eyes. He went still. "What?" he said, the word laced with something like venom.
Harry's fingers closed around it, but he didn't do anything with it immediately. It was beginning to hit him, just how strong his feelings for Malfoy actually were. Malfoy had said that he hadn't had a blow job before Harry's, which Harry sort of figured meant that Malfoy was a virgin, at least in the technical sense. He was talking about it as carelessly as though it was something he gave out everyday, to anyone, but Harry was beginning to guess the truth behind the carelessness.
Malfoy shifted slightly, but didn't look at him. "I didn't know how to tell you. And I didn't think you'd want to know."
Harry turned to watch Albus on the swings. He was propelling himself but not going too high. Always a little cautious. "Albus Severus," he expanded.
Dudley's eyebrows moved up his thick forehead. "Oh yeah? What kind of thing are we talking about here? I can't rob the bank for you, uh, Harry."
Malfoy looked down at his son, who had appeared silently beside him. "You looked a mess, Potter," he said, refuting the point.
He stayed for nearly the entire night, making good on some of his promises then and there, and while he knew that a host of complications lay ahead, at that moment, he could not believe that it would not work out somehow. Finally, close to four in the morning, Harry slipped through the front door of his house and crawled under the blankets on the sofa, sated, very sleepy, and very happy.
Malfoy made a contemptuous sound. "No one said you had to do anything. No one invited you to get hard over me. That's not my issue. And if you hated it, you could have stopped whenever you wanted to. But you didn't. Don't take your issues out on me, Potter."
Harry sat at the other end of the sofa, stiff. "I… I don't even know where to start. I just had a terrible dream, one I've had before. I just wanted to see someone and feel normal again. Get it out of my head."
After showering, he felt much better physically, though he was still ready to pass out on his feet. Malfoy had shown him where the bedroom was, the musty-smelling bedrolls scattered about the floor. Harry picked up his shorts from the floor of the bathroom. Even through his outer clothes, someone else's blood was on them, as well as his own from a cut on his thigh. They smelled sweaty and he was loath to put them back on. He couldn't hear Malfoy moving around and didn't want to ask if he thought it would be all right to use a charm on them, so Harry wrapped the towel Malfoy had silently handed him from a hall closet around his waist and went to the bedroom.
It was less than a minute to two o'clock, and Harry felt like he was on his way to a first date. He was ridiculously nervous and hoping Malfoy wouldn't notice. He could not stop himself from wondering obsessively how Malfoy was going to act today. Would he be cool and detached? Would everything be different? Would it be strained? Harry felt the silver pen in his hand attach to his palm the instant before the portkey activated, propelling him directly into Malfoy's front hall, where he had so recently been.
Potter didn't owl the next day, nor the next. Finally on Friday a short note arrived. All it said was something along the lines of his Saturday evening being open if Draco wanted to do something with him and to owl back if that were the case. Bugger put the ball in my court, Draco thought, staring at the parchment. He turned the scroll over, flattened it, and thought some more. He wanted to see Potter. He found it difficult to believe, but he wanted to see Potter very much. He was twenty-seven years old. Surely he could control his hormones. He picked up his quill and wrote back, instructing Potter to meet him at a café just outside Diagon Alley at eight.
"Hippogriff?" Ginny sounded disinterested, but came to inspect the picture anyway. "Very nice," she said. "Al, you've left paper peelings all over the table. Put those in the trash when you're done that picture and then come upstairs and change your shirt."
She said nothing for a long time, flinging garments onto the bed without folding them. Then eventually she said, "I can't believe you just didn't know. How can you possibly not know something like that?"
Annoyance and desire warred in Harry's brain, as well as other places. Desire won out. "If you say so," he said. He got up and Malfoy dragged himself onto the bed properly, propping himself up on his elbows to watch him. Harry finished unbuttoning his half-open shirt and dropped it on the floor, then went back to the bed. He resumed his position straddling Malfoy's hips and said, "You're far too dressed for this. Can't have that." He began to unbutton Malfoy's shirt, very slowly.
Malfoy had taken him into the very heart of the souq, past it to the edges of the mosque's outer courtyard. He'd spotted, to his obvious delight, a small vendor selling pomegranate juice from a small cart. Harry watched in fascination as two pomegranates were crushed, their juice squeezed out into a plastic cup. It was given to Harry. He went to pay, but Malfoy reached him first. "My treat," he said.
"Yes," Harry said, secretly surprised that Malfoy did know about it. He didn't seem a pub-going sort.
"Sure. Of course. You know, I am actually fairly good at what I do, too," Harry said mildly. "I haven't had a thoughtless exclamation in years. I usually make sure they're exceedingly thoughtful, in fact."
At that moment, Harry wouldn't have cared if Malfoy was three inches long and no thicker than a ten pence coin, but before the thought had finished forming itself, Malfoy had drawn himself out. Saliva seemed to fill Harry's mouth. It was definitely of decent size. Very decent, even. Long, and not thin, but not thick enough to choke him, either. It was perfect. He couldn't speak. He took an unsteady step toward Malfoy and let himself be gently pushed down, Malfoy smirking above him. First and foremost was getting that cock in his mouth, but getting the smirk off Malfoy's face ranked pretty highly, too.
Malfoy's shoulders were hunched. He looked miserable, Harry thought, looking at him across the bed. He supposed that if he had agreed to stay in order to keep Malfoy company, there wasn't much point in adhering only to the letter of the law. Malfoy had done something he usually didn't do: admitted weakness and asked for help, in whatever strange form that had been. Could it hurt to get over himself and just let Malfoy sleep near him, the way he had in the office? Harry moved over and hesitantly put a hand on Malfoy's side, the way he sometimes did with Ginny when she was angry with him and he was trying to placate her.
The clearance didn't come. In fact, nothing came, no word from any of the Order's higher-ups. Harry was getting increasingly frustrated, stuck where he was at Spinner's End. There was no news from the war front, no owls to be seen. They had no owl and no way of communicating with anyone outside. The rule during war was that if you scattered to a safehouse following a battle, you were to stay put and wait until official word came before leaving. If no word came, then after two weeks you were allowed to exercise your own judgement. As it was, Harry had no idea if anyone had traced them to Spinner's End yet. The Order had aura samples from everyone, which made tracing relatively simple - which had proven grimly convenient in the few (but painful) instances of betrayal from within the ranks.
He stopped again, and Harry could hear his own heart thumping in his ears. He'd been imagining Malfoy as a war criminal, not a victim. But he'd been as much a victim as Voldemort's captives, if not more so, having to live through it over and over again. He cleared his throat, cleared it again. "How long?"
"Malfoy, I…" Potter stopped, arms still circling Draco's middle. He sounded serious. "I have to tell you, I was hoping all along that this might happen if I stayed."
Harry shifted in his seat and re-crossed his legs. To his left, Ron was elbowing Hermione, who was flipping through a small notepad and muttering to herself. Whatever Ron said got him a glare and some sort of pointed question about his own seeming lack of preparation. Harry didn't altogether blame her; it was a big day. But he failed to see how any of their notes could be of any help now. On Hermione's other side, Ginny caught Ron's eye and shook her head.
Malfoy's arms came around his back then. He didn't say anything, but clung to Harry like a drowning person catching hold of a life preserver. Harry held him and tried to ignore the natural response from his own body, reminding him that it had been a long time since he'd touched or been touched by another male like this. A very long time.
Ginny rolled her eyes. "Right, an extremely vague text after ten at night. No explanation, nothing. You could have called."
"You excluded me from the entire Horcrux search," Ginny went on, as though he hadn't said anything. "Which is something I will never understand. I don't see why you couldn't have included me."
Harry matched his pace and cast about for conversational matter. One of his own strictest rules was, in layman's terms, Watch your mouth. Don't talk shop in public. Or anywhere outside strictly regimented safe zones. "How far is it?"
He had to know how intense that green gaze was. "Yes," Draco said again, and while feared stirred in his belly, he felt remarkably calm about it. He was certain, and it felt good to feel certain about this.
Harry summed up the situation: he was alone in a foreign country with only his wand, dressed in pyjama pants and a robe. He had nothing else. No money, no identification, no underwear. The situation Kingsley had always told them to be constantly prepared for, only he'd never actually been in such a ridiculous position before. It was obvious that he was entirely at Malfoy's mercy.
"Not with the recent quittings," Harry agreed. "Well. I don't know what to say. Does he talk to anyone?"
"That's my vote, too," Shacklebolt said. "Congratulations, Malfoy." He held out a hand. "You've progressed to the final stage of training."
Malfoy got to his feet and came over. "You wouldn't be you if it was any other way," he said quietly. "Let me stay with you. Just that. Tomorrow, we can make plans and all that, but for now, I don't want to leave you here, alone."
Malfoy looked up at the pop of Harry's Apparition. "Morning." He was seated at the desk and holding a sheaf of papers, a pair of reading glasses perched on the end of his pointed nose. They made him look rather like an accountant, Harry thought with amusement.
"I'm not the one who doesn't talk about it!" Potter set down his wine with a bang. "I didn't realise there was a need. I thought it was obvious."
"Pomegranates are in season and it's not as hot," Malfoy said simply. "In here." He gestured toward the gate and led them in. "This street, just for information's sake, is called Straight Street. Bab Sharqi, in Arabic."
Snape finally looked him in the eye, and it seemed to Draco that he looked almost sad. "I?" he said, dropping the banter. "Malfoy, I… perhaps you should speak to one of the other former Headmasters."
"That word, halla, has to be more guttural," Malfoy said, and demonstrated. "Halla. Further back in your throat."
"Well, I'm pretty sure I can figure out what happens next," Harry said. Malfoy's legs were dangling over the end of the bed; Harry was straddling his thighs.
Eventually, Harry moved, crawling forward to fling himself onto the sofa, twisting to turn himself over first. Draco joined him, feeling utterly boneless, unable to move or speak. Harry's hands came to rest on his back, holding him loosely, but so close.
Harry went over, sat on the edge of the chair and bent to kiss her forehead. She allowed it, smiling slightly. Having distracted her, Harry found the remote on her knee and hit the mute button. "Hello." He was not about to compete with the television.
The wards shimmered at the voice-print identification and allowed the person on the other side to open the door. "Owl for you, sir." Charlotte, one of the admins, entered with a familiar owl on her arm.
There was a moment in which it seemed nothing was going to happen. Harry's heart was in his throat. What would he do tomorrow when he saw Malfoy if he ignored Harry now? But then footsteps padded softly across the room. The knob turned and Malfoy appeared in the doorway. He saw Harry and smiled slightly and stood back to allow Harry entrance.
Harry sat, watching him warily, still unsure of how things stood between them. "So, what have we got?"
For a moment, Malfoy appeared to be struggling to keep his composure. "I… didn't discuss this decision with my mother," he said, the fingers of his right hand fiddling with the zip fastener on his bag. "But she knows that I'm here today and didn't say anything. I'm in this for the duration."
"I thought you were… well, actually, I thought you were one of the cool kids," Harry said, forcing a laugh. "When we first met. I thought I would never fit in if all the other kids were like you."
Harry looked deliberately over at Ginny. And knew even then that this was the reason they could not stay together. She didn't understand it. Her experience of the war had not been what he had lived through, what he apparently still could not deal with. There was more, of course, but even without Malfoy, Harry would have known from this alone. Quietly, he sat up. Just as quietly, he got dressed and slipped out of the bedroom.
In his dream, Harry broke out in a cold sweat, something that had not happened since the war. He scrambled for clothing and cursed his fingers for having slowed over the years. He had not had an alert like this since… he didn't want to think about it. Somehow, he got dressed. There was no time. The bedroom dissolved around him, and he was back in Little Whinging, and he was fifteen again. He saw the smoke even in the dark, and it was not at Number Ten, as the fragment of his mind that was still conscious that it was just a dream was suggesting. It was Number Four.
The storm was moving off toward Lebanon. "Good night," Malfoy said abruptly, rolled over and appeared to go to sleep.
"I… that was strange," Malfoy said, uncomfortable. He looked at something just over Harry's right shoulder for a second, then bit his lip and stood straighter. "Or maybe it has something to do with the fact that you saved my life," he said with surprising directness, looking Harry in the eye. "Maybe something in both of us knows that."
"Who are you here with?" Harry asked, letting his shoulders hunch forward, cradling his beer with both hands.
As for Malfoy, he was different after the conversation, too. True, he cornered Harry in the kitchen while they were setting things up for supper and, without once looking him in the eye, asked if they could not meet after all. Malfoy said he was tired and wanted an early night and Harry, not wanting to push their newfound peace, agreed unquestioningly. Malfoy sat across from him at the long, oak table in the basement kitchen and Harry's eyes accidentally met his several times. Once Malfoy held it for a long second, not smiling or frowning or looking away, but just looked probingly at Harry. Harry returned the gaze and wondered what Malfoy was thinking. And then, because he felt compelled to say or do something, offered Malfoy the butter. Malfoy's brows lifted slightly and he shook his head in refusal, and kept his eyes more or less to himself after that.
Fire burned in Draco's belly. He had never known that Snape had realised that. Somewhere behind him, Phineas Nigellus snickered. "Can we please focus on the essential issue here?" he snapped. "The school may be in danger. I need to know that you will be prepared to fight if you encounter any Death Eaters in any of the Hogwarts paintings."
"A bit late for that," Harry retorted. "Everyone knows about our existence now." He mentally declined to include Malfoy in the "our" and hoped that his tone had conveyed that. He knew he was being unfriendly. That was just how they did things. And frankly, regardless of the size of the house, it was awkward living in the same space as Malfoy, especially now that the war was over. Harry had no idea how else he was supposed to interact with him.
Ginny told him that night that he was off his game, and went to sleep frustrated. Harry was frustrated, too. He'd never before been unable to come with her. Though it had happened in the past with other women. He was embarrassed and angry and could not sleep. And she didn't kiss like Malfoy, either.
His voice sounding more alien and unrecognisable by the moment, the goblin said, "I have no further information on this matter."
"We don't actually know them. Williamson set this up. They're Muggles, and they think we all went to college together for a year before you and I dropped out and moved to Scotland."
He'd said it. All the cards were on the table now. But Harry shook his head. "I didn't leave three of them at all," he said. "And people can adjust, adults as well as kids. This is our life. I'm not going to apologise for it or hide it any more. I mean, I don't think we've exactly hidden anything, but what we did today - there was something wrong with that. My kids are used to getting media attention regardless. When everyone sees that we're a perfectly normal family, they'll leave us alone. Besides, three of the four kids are already off at school for the majority of the year. I think it's time to get on with our life."
"Of course," Daley said impatiently. "But what are we supposed to do? Are we safe if we come to the Order's headquarters? We fear there may be spies even there."
Draco's mouth twitched. "Nice," he said, as dryly as he could manage when what he really wanted to do was, horror of horrors, snuggle. He never snuggled, but there was something about the moment that felt strangely as though curling up against Potter's chest might be just the ticket.
Harry lay awake for hours that night, tossing and turning and thinking it over dozens of times, as though it were a case he was trying to find holes in, reasons to testify against, criminal evidence. His instinctive reaction was to distrust Malfoy on principle, but then, he had not been given a reason to trust, either. He had not been asked to trust, nor offered anything to suspect. What could Malfoy gain over him by that little episode in his front hallway? Exposure? Such an event would be unpleasant, but Harry was no stranger to upsetting headlines by now. Knowledge was power. From Harry's unfortunate memories of Lucius Malfoy's various statements, this motto had been hammered home as though it were either a specifically Malfoy or Slytherin concept. Would it just give Malfoy a sense of triumphant, trump-card knowledge to hold over Harry's head that he did indeed, as Malfoy had suspected, get it up for the likes of him? Harry thought not. Their interactions throughout the assignment thus far had been markedly absent of petty rivalry once the initial stiffness had worn off. In fact, he had been quite good to work with, as close to having a professional partner as Harry had ever had, someone who matched him closely in skill level, but complemented his abilities with a set that fit rather nicely with his own.
Harry glanced at his list. "Allison Daley. She, along with about fifteen others, just does not respond to my messages."
"Come on, at least think about it," Ginny had said coolly, sitting up in bed with the blankets tucked defensively around her hips. "You have issues with physical contact. How could you not?"
"I find that rather unlikely." Lucius looked singularly unconcerned. "However, his ardour will likely increase shortly."
"You certainly may," Harry said. He walked over and accepted a heavy cut-glass tumbler of firewhiskey and waited for Malfoy to give the next cue. Malfoy replaced the cap on the bottle and carried his own glass over to the island separating the kitchen from the living room. Harry followed and pulled out a stool at the corner. Malfoy chose to sit opposite him. "Thanks," Harry said, gesturing with his glass.
He took a large step down onto the floor, blinking as though he'd just woken from a long and very strange dream. "Was that real?" he asked, letting Potter steady him.
"Good night." Where was the door handle? Oh, there - Draco got himself out of the car, closed the door hastily and hurried inside, cursing himself mightily. God, how awkward! He couldn't have done anything differently, though. If he'd stayed any longer, he would have lost his ability to suppress his urge to kiss Potter, touch him, tangle his fingers in that impossible hair. How ridiculous! But the urge was there nonetheless. Furious with himself, he gave himself a talking to about the qualification, his assignment, and crawled into bed to sleep off his humiliation, his cock hard, the blanket sliding over it like a whisper. He wrapped one hand around it and tried not to think of Potter, but it was far too late for that. He came mouthing Potter's name into his pillow, rutting against his mattress as though he was a teenager again. After, he lay still and pulled the blanket tight around himself and knew that if it had been that close this last time, it would only get worse from here on in.
Harry stood back wordlessly and closed the door after Malfoy. Malfoy was dressed exactly as he had been the previous night and was already untying the belt of his dressing gown, pulling it off. Harry went to him, suppressing questions of every sort in favour of pursuing the thing he wanted. Malfoy turned to face him and they looked at each other for another long minute. Harry broke the spell and put his hand on Malfoy's arm to pull him closer, and Malfoy came unresistingly. The kiss was long and passionate, as though everything neither of them were saying had to be said through it, had to be communicated immediately. Malfoy's fingers dug into his back, his shoulders, the back of his neck, and Harry was dizzy.
He saw Malfoy later, though; in the common area where the food was being served. He was with Pansy and looking annoyed. Pansy saw Harry before Malfoy did, her eyes narrowing in the same old contemptuous, overly familiar way. Harry looked away, steering Ron toward the opposite corner where Hermione was waving them over.
Harry was quiet for a minute, thinking about this. He didn't know what he'd expected Hermione to say, but it wasn't this. Eventually, he said, "I thought that this was exactly what I wanted. Having Ginny and being part of the family and having kids. Having my own house - that wasn't Grimmauld Place - and teaching the kids about Muggles and magic and Quidditch."
This was surprising and yet not at the same time. Harry pressed himself forward, felt the tight ring of muscle grip at the head of his cock. Malfoy hissed a breath, sucking it in, his fingernails white where they clutched the undersides of his thighs. Harry pushed in another inch or so, and it felt so good, so good. Malfoy's eyes closed tightly, teeth clenched in a grimace and he turned his head to the side. Half-buried in Malfoy, Harry made himself stop. Speech at this point was difficult. "Uh - are you - "
Above the noise of the shouting spectators, Potter called, "Sorry, Malfoy - I forgot myself, there. Thought I was with Ron or something."
Malfoy was didn't say anything for a long moment. Then he rolled off Harry, away from the wet patch. "What about Weasley?" His voice was quiet.
Hermione was silent for a few minutes, thinking. Harry drank his tea and watched her carefully. She looked up. "This thing with Malfoy," she said, turning her spoon over her hands. "It's serious? It's not just a thing you're doing because you've realised your orientation and he was… convenient?"
Shacklebolt leaned back and drew the binder back, almost as though for protection. As though he knew that what he was going to say would not be met with a favourable result. "We want you to become Potter's friend," he said. "Genuinely. Not just friendly terms, but a true friendship. Get to know him. Find out what he's like one-on-one. What he likes to do in his spare time. How he likes his current assignment. Whatever. You don't need to like all of his friends and acquaintances, though it would obviously make it easier. I'll let you in on something. When Potter went through this training, we made him enrol in anger management classes. He learned a lot about emotional control and processing things slowly, and it's done him well. Before that, we didn't think he necessarily had the emotional fortitude it would take. He could learn more of that from you, we think. It would be a beneficial friendship as far as the Ministry and particularly the Auror Department is concerned."
"Some people I know from the apothecary in Hogsmeade," Malfoy said, shrugging. "Nothing special, and they all just left."
"Here?" Malfoy cocked an eyebrow. "Now what? Are we attempting some sort of quasi-Olympic wall-sex?"
"I'm sorry about before," Potter said, moving his hands to the bottom of the wheel again, his fingers holding it loosely.
"I know," Harry said between gritted teeth. "I didn't exactly plan it, okay? Let's get out of here."
Harry looked down at himself in surprise. "Is it? I've had this forever." It was just an old, long-sleeved black shirt that he often wore on the weekend. It was a little too small, though, and fit rather tightly. He wasn't sure what the appeal was. "Uh, thanks. I like your ensemble, too. Much classier."
"What do you want?" Draco was curious despite himself. He leaned over and took the bottle from Potter's hand. "Give that here."
"Do you want to talk again yet?" Harry asked, trying very much not to press the issue. It wasn't that he was remotely unhappy with how things were. He just wanted it to be official. Said and known and acknowledged for what it was. He wanted it to be safe to say things like how he felt and how happy he was. But only if Draco was ready to believe him.
After a few moments of uncomfortable silence, Malfoy shifted at his end of the sofa. "Sorry," he muttered. "I didn't mean to be so - you're injured. I'd ask if you needed something, but I haven't got anything."
"Why not?" Malfoy sounded like he was clenching his teeth, just a bit of anger underlining his words.
The coffee shop was in a dingy corner of London. It was late and dark and the clientele looked rough around the edges. Malfoy shifted next to Harry in the booth. "You're sure he'll show?" he said, yet again.
Malfoy looked at him for a long minute, no judgement showing behind that smooth front. "And you'll never let yourself have what you actually wanted now because you're still punishing yourself for having made a poor choice? Or is it more about wallowing in Gryffindor-like guilt because you haven't single-handedly solved the case of her death? That's self-sacrificial to the point of absurdity, Potter."
"I'd say." Malfoy offered a rare smile. "I'd say that that merits being invited back. What would you say to tomorrow around two? I should have the info read-out from today's vault activities by then. I should have something else that will let me know if any of the magical signature traces down there have been identified with any of those I have in my own files."
Harry experienced an unpleasant sensation low in his gut, recalling the last time he was in the underworld of Gringotts unauthorised. "Are you… are you sure about this? Not that I doubt that you know what you're doing," he added hastily, seeing Malfoy's face, "but I was in there one other time, and they have incredible amounts of preventative measures for detecting intrusion."
Seeing Malfoy that aroused and that needy, so desperate and helpless was something of a turn-on. Though he didn't know what he was doing, it hardly seemed to matter to Malfoy, who was arching gratefully into his curled fingers, gasping thanks and profanities, fingers digging into the bedspread. Once again, his breasts had remained intact and Harry reached up to squeeze one, Malfoy's hand over his other hand, guiding Harry's rhythm. At this, Malfoy cried out and came hard, not even breathing for a few seconds as his body shuddered. It was intensely arousing, watching him like this, and Harry's own cock was leaking fluid, stiff and heavy.
Draco didn't have to tell him that this ended the argument, ridiculous and unfounded as it was. If Potter's gut believed it, he could believe it. So far it had never been wrong, apparently. "When do you want me to go?" he asked quietly.
Harry stared at him for a moment, wondering what Malfoy's particular game was today. "Oh, that one. Uh, I think it might be at home. I'll check around my desk and such, but if it's at home, I'll try to bring it tomorrow."
"And respect the Headmistress," Scorpius intoned, rolling his eyes, but he was smiling. "I know, Dad. You've told me a thousand times. I will."
Saliva filled Harry's mouth again and he swallowed, unable to take his eyes off it. Questions rose in his throat and were strangled by the lump of desire there, of naked want. His hand was moving again before he could stop himself, while the one holding his jeans half in place over himself falling limply to his side. Malfoy's eyes were on him, watching his fist, the head of his cock winking out between strokes. He was watching Harry and rubbing himself, leaning back against the opposite wall, his legs spreading a little, his breath slipping out between his teeth. Just the fact that Malfoy was watching him do this and seemed to find it arousing did something to him that made the humiliation dissolve, forgotten. Ginny thought that wanking was disgusting. He could not think of Ginny now. Not here, locked in a bathroom stall with Draco Malfoy of all people, jerking his fist over his steadily leaking cock. He could feel his hips trying to buck off the wall to thrust harder into his fist, and knew from the look Malfoy gave him that it had not gone unnoticed.
Encouraged, Harry remembered that if Malfoy took longer to get off than he did, then he would have to be sure to prepare him very thoroughly, so that by the time Harry fucked him, he was begging for it. He added a third finger without warning Malfoy and switched to his other nipple, scraping his teeth over it. Malfoy shuddered, his cock knocking into Harry's belly.
"Why's that?" Harry paused at a street corner to check where he was, then turned toward the nearest tube station.
Malfoy opened his mouth, but the doorknob turned and he started, jerking away from Harry. Arthur Weasley brought in a string of onions and hung them on the inside of the door. "So this is where the party is," he quipped cheerfully.
Malfoy crossed the small kitchen and put the kettle on the range to boil. For a moment he just stood there, not far behind Harry. "I'm going to make tea," was all he said.
Malfoy put his spoon down. "There, that should do it. I just have to watch it now to see how the colour settles." He came over and looked into Harry's cauldron. Harry thought he was unnecessarily close, but didn't say so. "That looks good. Was it sticking at all?"
Harry searched for the sting, the maliciousness, then had to remind himself that Malfoy had been civil since about the start of the war already. He couldn't help it; he just expected it. "No," he said shortly, not wanting to discuss it. "I, erm, have to get…" he gestured toward the cubicles, trailing off.
Harry shook his head, confused. "I thought you still hated me. I mean, you never acted like you wanted to talk to me or become friends. I don't know. I was just busy and preoccupied and if you were sending hints, I missed them."
Harry was quiet for a long moment. Then he took a deep breath and said, "Look. Ginny's married. She's married to someone who isn't me, and she isn't married to me because I didn't want to marry her. As you may recall, I didn't even want to date her. I broke up with her, and then I was the one who didn't want to get back together once everything was over. With the war, I mean. Also, in case it's escaped your attention, I'm gay. How can you still be jealous about Ginny? I was sixteen. I don't go on about Pansy Parkinson all the time, do I? And you still see her; I hardly ever even see Ginny now that they live here."
"I rather thought we were… business partners," the same voice returned coldly. "However, I wish no offense. The plans will proceed as soon as there is an opportunity."
Back in the room, Draco went directly to his own bed and began undressing with his back to Harry. "I don't think we should…" he began, trailing off.
There was something in her voice. "What is it?" Harry asked tightly, thinking simultaneously of Surrey and Malfoy.
"And you're still insisting that you're straight? How deluded are you, Potter?" He couldn't help it; the scorn crept in on its own. "Did you just 'not know'?"
Harry frowned and bit his lip. Had Malfoy really been offended? More likely he was just going out to buy some more water or something, Harry decided. The monastery provided one bottle per day, no more and no less, but of course it wasn't enough, as it and the small cups of intense, Arabic coffee were all that they drank. Another thing which Harry had been entirely new to, but he liked it. He turned back to his book. He was determined to learn how to bargain as quickly and convincingly as possible. To, if nothing else, keep up his share of the weight on this little venture. Malfoy had said nothing about when they might return so far, but Harry was finding that he was in no particular rush.
"Stop staring at my arse, Potter." Malfoy's voice floated back and Harry realised belatedly that he'd been doing just that as Malfoy had moved ahead.
There were footsteps on the stairs and then Neville appeared. "Morning," he said sleepily, dishevelled and half-awake.
"Thanks to Voldemort," Potter said firmly. "I didn't start the war. And I didn't choose your parents' choices. Or yours."
Harry cleared his throat. "You won't need to. So, about this working together. Where do you propose we start?"
Next to him, almost forgotten, Lisette sighed, too. "He'll be fine," she said, echoing Draco's own words to Harry that morning.
"None of those counter the gay part." Malfoy unlocked the stall door. "I'll see you around, Potter."
Harry established that he had regained his balance, relaxed, smiled uncertainly and held out the pen. "Hello."
Harry stole a look at him. The blood on Malfoy's cheek seemed to have increased. "Are you bleeding?"
He was infuriating. Draco bent forward over the table. "Listen, Potter, what is this?" he hissed. "What do you really want?"
A Gryffindor sixth year was going the wrong way, away from the Great Hall. She was, in fact, walking toward him with a sense of hesitant purpose. "Headmaster," she began uncertainly. "May I have a word?"
"Oh, but he just adores me," Harry said. "We're probably the last people he'd confide in. Maybe he could be forced to see the Ministry counsellor or something."
"You were never one to ask for or take advice in the past," Snape said boredly, examining long fingernails.
"No." Malfoy agreed. "We don't actually have to travel like Muggles, I just thought it would be worthwhile for me to get used to. Tonight, I just want to Apparate, if that's okay with you."
"I don't think so." Ginny folded her arms defiantly. The circle drew in closer. Unseen in the shadows, Malfoy dropped to a crouch, his wand withdrawn. His lips were moving silently and Harry did not know what he was casting, or trying to cast.
"Ex-exactly like that," Malfoy said, his voice taut with need. Harry looked down between them to see himself disappearing into Malfoy's body and he saw Malfoy's cock, rigid against his belly and the sight was almost too much. "Slowly," Malfoy warned, panting, "or - "
Harry snapped back into focus, not even sure where his thoughts had gone for a moment. The swing bumped against his hands and he reacted at once, giving a mighty push. He could have done it magically, but there were a few things in life that he firmly believed should not be done by magic, and pushing his young son on the swings was one of them.
Harry's strength gave way and he collapsed onto Malfoy, still buried inside him, and tried to catch his breath, his cock still twitching aftershocks. Malfoy gradually let his legs fall, hands still holding Harry's back. "Well, that was - interesting," he said after a bit, still breathing hard.
Malfoy still didn't look at him. "Isn't there someone who sleeps in your bed that you could have seen with less hassle?"
Harry was surrounded by an absolute horde. Red hair, frizzy hair, and red, frizzy hair was everywhere. Weasleys abounded. Harry's own kids were near him. Ginny was there, though the husband was absent, strengthening the illusion of herself and Harry as they would have been by this time, as though nothing had ever changed. Weasley and Granger were there, Granger calling out various things to various children, and Weasley made his way over to Harry as James ran off with one of the Weasley children. Whatever Weasley said, it came with a jerk of his chin in Draco's direction, or perhaps Scorpius'. Draco's gut clenched, but not nearly to the extent that it used to. Weasley had actually been somewhat decent about the whole thing once he'd had a chance to cool down. It also helped, Draco thought very dryly, that Granger had told him about his sister's own infidelities. Both Granger and Harry had made it clear that there was not going to be any trouble on account of the homosexual bit, and Weasley had accepted that fairly meekly. It had taken him longer to accept that Draco himself, but that was hardly unexpected. Consequently, while Harry's kids fraternised with their frizzy-haired cousins regularly, Draco had not subjected Scorpius to them. Things were civil on the whole, but Draco preferred to keep his distance, or at least his son's.
Harry heard a larger drop from one of the trees land resoundingly on his umbrella. "Why do you do it at all?"
Malfoy floundered for a second, then came up with something. "There's a place a couple of blocks away that has really good brunch. I was there with… someone once."
"He'll be fine wherever he is," Draco said positively. He was curious, himself, however. "You know he will."
He woke up disoriented and not sure where he was. A face full of blond hair helped explain rather more quickly than his brain could deal with first thing in the morning, forcing Harry to take rapid stock of his situation. He was in bed with Malfoy. He had his arm around Malfoy, decidedly more tightly than it had been when he'd fallen asleep. In fact, he was glued to the length of Malfoy's back, right down to his… Oh, God, Harry thought. Too far. He jerked himself away from Malfoy in horror and turned over, hoping desperately that Malfoy was asleep and hadn't noticed.
"God, I'm going to have to take you to the Intelligence branch museum or something," Malfoy said, rolling his eyes. "You'd wet your pants. You can't see your own aura, no. That's because it's a one-way spell and doesn't affect the person it's cast on. Look." He reached for Harry's wrist and turned his palm facing up. He caught Harry's glance. "It's not going to be permanent or painful or bind you to me for life, so stop looking like that, you infant."
He got a cool look and Malfoy dropped the sarcastic banter. "It never came up in conversation before."
"You're early," Malfoy drawled, albeit at a slightly higher pitch than what he usually used. With only a tiny bit of imagination, it could easily pass for a pleasantly low, smoky woman's voice.
Draco nodded absently and stabbed the little plastic sword through his olive. He couldn't have cared less about Weasley, but Potter… "Are you upset about her?" he asked, unable to look at Potter as he did so. He watched Potter's fingers instead.
"Thanks," Malfoy said in Harry's ear. "I didn't realise how much more vulnerable I would appear to be like this. Or actually be, especially in these shoes that I could never run in. Thanks for coming to my rescue."
Draco knew this, and didn't say anything. James was (apparently) his paternal grandfather all over again, full of pranks and a certain disregard for authority that Draco found amusingly similar to his father, though Harry had never been quite that rambunctious. Despite Draco's school-years impressions of him always getting away with things that anyone else should have been suspended for doing, at least. Perhaps it would have been different if Harry hadn't grown up with the Dursleys. But he had grown up with the Dursleys, and was as bemused by James' behaviour as Draco was at times. Albus was Harry's special son. As dear as James was to him, Albus was different. It was true. He possessed all of Harry's vulnerability, his lack of self-assurance. He was sensitive to a fault, worried about public opinion and fitting in. He was everything that Harry had learned to hide or transform as an adult, and in him Draco could see Harry as he truly must have been, particularly in his first year. Granted, Albus was also stubborn (not unlike his father) and reasoning with him was like reasoning with a brick wall. He also possessed a streak of intensely independent opinion, also like his father.
By the fourth day, Harry was almost used to seeing Malfoy as a woman. It was a strange concept, but he didn't have trouble fitting the beautiful woman sitting across from him at the dinner table with his friend on the interior of the disguise. The disguise was working well, and Harry was finding that he wasn't minding the time away from the rest of the group all that much at all. Malfoy could be a lot more fun than Harry had known, always coming up with new ideas, always with something interesting or witty or observant to say, and snarky enough to keep Harry on his guard. Just that afternoon, he had complimented Harry on being a good boyfriend, a compliment which had made Harry roll his eyes at hearing. Malfoy, in his current state, got hit on rather a lot, and Harry was surprised to find himself feeling slightly jealous. "Come on, gents, move along," he'd said gruffly to the group of construction workers on what must have been a lunch break and followed them down half a block. They'd been about to protest, but something in Harry's expression had evidently convinced them not to argue. Malfoy had pretended to swoon, kissing Harry on the cheek in demure gratitude. Harry, face burning, had said nothing to this, pulling Malfoy back into the pedestrian traffic.
They were both breathing hard, trying to collect themselves and figure out what the hell to say now. "I guess I'd call that adequate payback for the interruption," Potter finally said, panting. "God, Malfoy. I had no idea."
"Look, Potter… I know you saved my life. I owe you a debt. I'm sorry this is so late in coming, but I thought the least I could do was say thank you, since I didn't at the time," he said.
"Sometimes you really get on a person's nerves," Harry said, eyeing the clear plastic icicle ornaments Molly had hung around the doorway by way of attempting to decorate for Christmas and briefly pondered impaling Lupin with one of them.
"Heart-warming, Potter," Malfoy said dryly, but it came with another real smile. And then he was pushing himself to his feet. "Let me know if you need anything else." He moved quickly and was at the doors almost before Harry could react.
"Maybe I'm only allowed to use Muggle disguises," Malfoy said. "Wigs and cosmetics and such. Different clothes. But glamours for the rest of myself, at least if I'm interpreting this correctly."
Precisely on schedule, Harry waited for the dizziness of the Portkey to wear off as he blinked in the dim interior of Malfoy's hallway. As usual, Malfoy was waiting, hand extended for the silver pen. Harry, still dizzy, held it out and felt his legs buckle as Malfoy backed him into the nearest wall. Harry could feel the smile against his mouth before he opened it, their teeth clicking for a second before it all gave way to tongues and lips and roving hands. After a good several minutes of this, Malfoy released him. "Hello."
Harry rolled over and put his mouth over Draco's right nipple. "A'ight," he said against Draco's chest.
The cup was hot against Draco's palm despite the cardboard sleeve. He didn't know what to say and couldn't remember when he'd been more embarrassed, though that wasn't the right word to describe the burning in his belly. "I'm sorry, too," he mumbled, face growing hot. It sounded rather lame.
As it turned out, Ginny's complaint had proven irrelevant: the hospital to which the three of them had been assigned was in Edinburgh, and as Harry was stationed in London with Malfoy, hanging out was not going to be an option. Hermione wasn't sure what their hours would be, or couldn't discuss it (which was the more likely case), so Harry left it. If Ginny seemed annoyed that Harry wasn't more broken up about not seeing each other for a month, Hermione and Ron paid it no mind. Cheery goodbyes were said, and that was that.
Harry went down the stairs one morning to find Seamus arguing amiably with Malfoy over the proper way to boil an egg and wondered when they'd started eating breakfast together. Probably just a coincidence, he told himself, though it didn't bother him any less that Malfoy was so patently uninterested in him. He'd been berating himself over that one, stupid drunken whatever-it-had-been, and his apparent lack of self-control since it had happened, but doubly - trebly - so since his conversation with Pansy. If only he hadn't screwed up his one chance with Malfoy.
They whirled in shock and anger. "Malfoy!" one of them spat, and Draco did not know if they were addressing him or appealing to his father.
He saw only the two forms, and thought that Dudley must have moved out some time ago. Where would he be? Would someone notify him? Harry had no information on him, had never looked for it or cared to know. He drew a deep breath and noticed that it came with difficulty. Shock was beginning to seep in past the numbness. "Did anyone see anything?" he asked the nearest person to him.
Tonks bristled next to Harry, immediately angry. At the far end of the table, Lupin shifted, a rare look of annoyance coming over his tired face. Arthur glanced at Molly, who nodded vigorously at him. "I'd be happy to," he said calmly, and began. He spoke concisely and kept the spare details to a minimum, which Harry appreciated. He concluded by speaking about the current Ministry and its dim view of the Order as it currently existed. "In the end," he said, "it all comes down to whether or not we see a purpose for a continued existence. As history has proven, there certainly has been a purpose and a need in the past."
Malfoy considered him for a long moment, eyes narrowed thoughtfully. "I heard you were in the closet," he said, without venom.
Harry balked. He understood, though; they were standing too close together for it to be anything but that. A large group of Muggles were now walking across the entrance to the alley, a dinner party of perhaps eighteen or twenty people. He took a breath and made himself do it. If he just thought about Malfoy's long hair, those damnable breasts… their mouths touched a little more firmly than he'd had in mind. Malfoy's lips were soft and he made a sound of startled surprise when Harry's mouth landed on his. Some of the Muggles, still just around the corner, had stopped to chat in a group of three or four, and some of the others were calling back to them. Malfoy, maybe realising the need to prolong this, opened his mouth under Harry's.
He wiped his forehead on the edge of the blanket and tried to calm himself down. It was the same dream, a recurring nightmare that he'd had on and off since the war had ended. The Death Eaters going after his aunt and uncle in their sleep, with no warning and no chance to escape. There was nothing real to base it on, but Harry supposed that the recent scare in Surrey had brought the dream on again. He could explain it away with perfect logic, but it didn't change how he felt - panicked, guilty, shocked. Over a dream, but the dream evoked other, equally unpleasant memories. He craved something - someone - warm and real to touch and talk to and make him feel human again. And to understand it, so that he wouldn't have to explain it. He did not want to talk about the dream, the war, his relatives, any of it.
The next day, Harry didn't visit the same lavatory until much later in the day. The custodial staff had probably scrubbed the wall clean, if they'd noticed the writing, but, before stopping by the urinals, Harry had to go and see. Both lines were still there, and there was a new line now. It read:
"I never said it was. But as you may have realised, I run things around here now. What do you want?" Draco was smug, relishing Potter's irritation.
Several voices spoke at once. "Severus, there's no need for - " Lupin, sharply, but Ron's voice was overlapping angrily, Tonks' joining in as well.
Harry stretched his hands out across the table but didn't take Draco's hands. "You're better this way. A better person."
Susan Bones' office door was closed when he finally made his way down to the fourth floor of the Ministry, but she answered his knock. The sign on her desk proclaimed her the Director of Human Resources, a position she had held for the past three or four years now; Harry had lost track. She smiled when she saw him. "Hi, Harry. Have a seat."
"Since when I do matter so much to you?" Malfoy made an impatient gesture. "That still confuses me."
And then the nights were glorious. Usually Malfoy dropped the glamours as soon as they were alone, but not always. He was rather insistent that Harry go down on him properly as a women, wanting to experience that. Fortunately (in Harry's opinion), Malfoy could rarely keep up the glamour long in this particular activity, and it usually ended with his cock halfway down Harry's throat. Malfoy seemed to get some sort of perverse glee out of the glamours now that Harry didn't need or want them any more. "Bend me over the kitchen counter and fuck me," he would order, or "here, on your washing machine, like in porn," and he would lift his skirt or dress and make Harry take whatever ridiculously girlish undergarments he was wearing that day - once with his teeth, which Harry had proven rather terrible at doing. On the other hand, Harry quickly figured out the best ways to make Malfoy lose control of the glamours and how to keep them up. If he was slow and gentle, Malfoy could often maintain the glamours; if he was hard and brutal, the glamours faded almost instantly. Or, he realised, the last night of the assignment, if it stopped feeling like a silly sex game to Malfoy and felt like something real. Then Malfoy's body would shift into his own as though unable to keep up the deception in the face of what was apparently real emotion for him. Harry knew better than to let on that he'd noticed this or realised the depth of his feelings for Harry, but he knew. And he liked it. If he thought about nothing beyond this, he was ridiculously happy.
He seemed happy just to be out of Diagon Alley, Draco thought, glancing at his profile. He realised that he had no idea what he was in for. But there was only one way to find out. He named a restaurant, took a breath, and plunged ahead into the unknown.
Harry shook his head. "Not tonight. I want to get home for once." Then, seeing his friend's face, he added, "Sorry. Sometime soon, maybe."
"Yeah, fine," Harry said. He inadvertently let his gaze flick south, only to see that Malfoy, too, was sporting some morning wood. He hastily looked away. "Um, I borrowed a towel and used your shower. Obviously. Hope that's okay?"
"Off we go, then," he said briskly. He picked up the pull handle of Albus' trunk and gestured for the boy to go ahead of him. "Straight across the platform."
Harry crouched beside Malfoy and put one of his arms over his own shoulders, helping him up. "Hold on," he said. "You want to Apparate or Floo?"
He'd stopped talking, already frotting uncontrollably against Harry's thigh. Some of the embarrassment turned to confusion, which in turn gave way to some sort of feeble grasp on the situation. Later, Draco had made occasional reference to the incident and forced various re-enactments on Harry at the least expected times, always to Harry's protest and dismay. Albeit, initial.
Malfoy was there in an instant, his wand out, and the boy landed softly, sand flying out from beneath him as the charm scattered it. Harry ran, arriving a second later. Malfoy was crouching, helping him up, his son craning to see what had happened. "Are you all right?" Malfoy was asking. His voice was exactly the same, but the sneering drawl was missing.
"And you'd be the first to point out that we're not most people," Potter said. "You, the son of a famous Death Eater."
Malfoy laughed again. "Good try, Potter. Thanks for confirming it. You know the one. Goes to the tune of you and him behind the kitchen at Grimmauld Place and somebody - or two twin somebodies, rather - walking in on someone going down on someone else."
"It's a highly sophisticated pattern," Malfoy said, not addressing Harry specifically but directing his words to the table between them. "I've been monitoring Treasury loss for years, but even so, it took me quite awhile to notice that there was a pattern to it. It's difficult to even say how long it's been going on, but my estimate is three or four years. A colleague of mine had already been researching the various leaks, and it seems now that some of them must be connected. The manner of the pattern suggests that numerology has to be involved, because we're talking about very complex magic, if it can override the Department of Treasury's wards as well as Gringotts wards and Goblin magic."
Malfoy pulled him up by the arms and Harry kissed him, the last of the restraint dissolving between them. Harry lay bonelessly sprawled over Malfoy, felt his cock touching Malfoy's and Malfoy's stomach rising and falling against his, his hands on Harry's back. After a bit, Harry finally felt like he could sleep. He wanted to tell Malfoy to stay, not to disappear in the middle of the night again, but he also didn't want to wreck anything. They settled into comfortable positions, Malfoy's head on his shoulder, that same arm lying warmly across Harry's chest. Harry was nearly asleep when Malfoy spoke. "This is how I wanted it to be, before."
Soaked and lost somewhere between anger, humiliation, and arousal, Harry didn't even know what to say, so he gave a bark of laughter. "You are the sickest, most twisted person I know."
"Makes it a bit difficult to watch them, don't you think?" Malfoy's gaze was trained on the window, not on Harry. "They can't see in. They wouldn't even know where to look."
The breathing changed and Malfoy turned his head to the other side. "This," he said evasively. "That I wanted this."
"Sure. Yes. I am." Harry smiled in an offhand sort of way, but knew that Malfoy was fully aware that it was the first time that Harry had initiated this.
"I have no idea," Malfoy said, squinting into his glass. "But she's gone, evidently. It also sounded to me like they're not quite clear on the overall plan."
He couldn't tell Ginny. That was all there was to it. She wouldn't understand. His phone was off. She had probably already called it several times. Perhaps he should call and leave a message, but she would answer if he called. A text message to her mobile, then. He could claim the line had been busy. Harry caught his own train of thoughts and stopped short. Was he actually contemplating it? "What do you mean, stay with you?" Harry asked, endeavouring to keep the suspicion from his voice.
Moody flexed his claw-like fingers. "It could be much worse," he volunteered. "Sometimes - often - we've had candidates get up and walk out of the room before the explanation of the assignment was even finished. People don't like this part. I personally think you've got one of the easiest assignments we've ever given."
"But that's just how it goes," Harry said. "All we can do is deal with it as it comes. That's life, from here on in."
She waited for him to expand, and when he didn't, turned over to face the opposite wall. He hoped she wasn't crying. He could handle her anger, though it frustrated him, but this… remorse ate at his stomach lining. He could just hold her, maybe, but he didn't want to. The memory of the moment after his last encounter with Malfoy was still vivid. He did not want to touch her. He looked at her, and the angle of her shoulder said that she was angry, not weeping. "Maybe some other time, then," she said acidly.
Malfoy gave him an interesting smile, one full of some manner of deviousness and layers that Harry would never comprehend and just said, "Sure thing, Potter. Hey, and bring back that book of mine, would you?"
Malfoy reached back and found Harry's hand, now on his back, and moved it down to his arse. Harry opened his eyes and found Malfoy's on him, sober. "Do it," he said, his voice roughened by lust and possibly a touch of emotion.
The panic almost drowned out his ability to think clearly, to speak. "What? I don't know what you're talking about," Draco said, trying to sound cool at the accusations, but his mind was whirling uncontrollably. He should have known it was too good to last. The little voice in his head was mocking him for his sentimentality, for thinking he was in love and that it could really work. "Harry, what are you - "
Every one of his disguises went just a little bit wrong somewhere. It wasn't that Malfoy's guises were too complex (a common failing of many novices in Stealth) or too simple, or that he wasn't prepared enough, but while each disguise worked successfully for a time, Harry was never fully convinced by any of them. It wasn't just that he had known Malfoy for so long that he could see past them. They discussed this one evening toward the end of the first week in Malfoy's apartment over butterbeers, winding down from the day. Malfoy had dropped the disguise, since only Harry was there. "I don't know what I keep doing wrong," Malfoy said with frustration, raking his fingers through his hair. "In theory, they all work so well, but every time I drop the ball somewhere. I hate that I can't just get this."
Harry took a deep breath. "Look," he said. "Have you thought about maybe seeing a counsellor, or maybe someone about the drinking?"
Malfoy pressed his cheek into Harry's. "I wish this had happened sooner," he said, finally finishing the sentence.
"I promise to go down on you," Harry said. He touched his mouth to Malfoy's jaw line. "I promise to touch you any way you want me to. I promise to let you fuck me. I promise to get over my issues with being gay. I promise not to deny it, or you." His mouth was moving, snagging Malfoy's ear lobe in his teeth, kissing his neck, and finally running his tongue over Malfoy's lips. Malfoy made a choked sound and closed his mouth over Harry's tongue and they kissed for a long time. A very long time. Harry was dizzy, breathless with joy and relief and desire. He had never realised just how tightly Malfoy was emotionally capable of holding another person, but some reserve had fallen away, the aloof façade dissolving.
After breakfast, Harry got up to do the dishes. Malfoy had remained steadfastly silent except when spoken to throughout, but had equally silently made toast and put things like jam and butter and milk out on the table for them, so Harry thought he would do the dishes. Malfoy was standing at the sink, already running the water. Neville said something about showering and disappeared upstairs. Seamus took the month-old Prophet to the next room to erase Malfoy's answers to the crossword.
Potter was there, appearing every time they got into a new frame, sometimes speaking, usually not. Once, he said, "You look like a photograph instead of a painting."
He couldn't repeat it. Except he had to. Draco raised his face, eyes blazing. "Fuck me," he said, very clearly.
It seemed that Malfoy was having similar feelings. "In the morning," he said, "I want to do everything either of us can think of doing. Right now, I'm too tired. I don't want to be tired the first time we really do anything for real."
They moved off just as Potter emerged from a nearby staircase leading up from the guest quarters. He took one look at Draco's face and said, "Problem?"
"Let's go for sushi and talk about it," Draco said. It was the best he could do. He couldn't even handle what Potter was asking, exactly, but he was hungry and this would prolong the decision-making. And Potter was not about to let him go without an answer. That much was abundantly clear.
Harry nodded fractionally. "I've been looking for you," he said to James. His voice was cool and he glanced at Dawson. "What's going on?"
Malfoy took him by the shoulders and steered him to the sofa, as though Harry was going to need to be seated to hear it - or restrained. "Dolohov has been sighted and successfully traced. We're tracking him."
Harry looked up, startled and angry at himself for having been caught off guard. "Nothing. Unless you know a lot about internet connections and so forth."
Potter had not avoided him per se, but he had retreated behind some wall, always polite but wholly untouchable, unreachable, and any secret thoughts Draco might have had regarding anything that might have happened between them died with the sober realisation that Potter would never look at him that way again. That stung, too. Now, more than ever, Draco missed his mother. It felt like a shameful thing to be missing his mother at his age, but he missed her detached consideration of a problem, her rock-solid advice. Would she have counselled him to do this? He would never know; she had died years ago.
"I see no point in continuing," Snape said, as though no one had spoken, and for the third time, repeated: "The war is over. The new age has begun. It is time we all moved on."
Somehow, Harry's hands got from Malfoy's neck to his arse, and that got Malfoy's arms around him. Harry was alternately rubbing or squeezing; he couldn't help himself. Malfoy pulled his face away, panting, but gave in and pressed himself against Harry's body. He was hard. Harry could feel it. He broke away. "So you do want this," he said, confirming, breathing hard. He knew it, but he wanted to hear Malfoy say it.
At the table, Harry watched Malfoy drag a plastic spoon through the foam on his drink and tried to think of something to say.
Harry kept at it, rubbing his tongue along that smooth, hardening nub. Malfoy was gasping and moaning and lifting himself to meet Harry's tongue when out of nowhere, something changed. The nub was growing - growing quickly, Harry realised, the thought happening so fast that he barely registered it. Malfoy's body was changing, and Harry's mouth was suddenly full. In shocked realisation, he pulled his mouth off Malfoy's cock - Malfoy's hard, jutting, reddened cock, bobbing just in front of his face. Harry couldn't quite believe what he was seeing. The glamour had faded entirely; he was looking down at naked Draco Malfoy in all his glory. The breasts remained, but below the belt, his body had resumed a strictly masculine form.
Harry felt a touch of heat rise to his cheeks. It wasn't that he hadn't been able to deduce that Malfoy was obviously the Unspeakable to whom Kingsley had been referring, but he'd been shooting for a little information. Always the detective, Ginny had frequently accused, sometimes with real affection. "Right," he said stiffly.
Potter's eyes glinted. He leaned forward, lacing his fingers together. "Get right to the point, don't you."
Harry took a deep breath and turned to face the water, his own hands in his pockets. "Why do you ask?"
Never might be too soon, at this rate. "Tomorrow would be great," Draco managed, sounding strangled.
Silence fell between them like a curtain, turmoil frothing in Harry's gut, every emotion he knew warring within him. He stared at Malfoy, not knowing what to say or how to say it, not knowing how to defend Ginny or if he even could, but above all knowing that this was the end of whatever had been going on with Malfoy. Only now did he realise that it had been a lot more to him than he had known. A pang of regret added itself to the mass of seething bad feeling in his belly and he knew that he could not see Malfoy again. Not with this between them. Malfoy, who had known Harry's endless search for the truth about Ginny's death, and who had known about this, whatever this even was. And he had just gone along with it, the investigation with Malfoy slowly leading him to the truth he had never known, all the while seducing him and hiding the facts from him until it became impossible for Harry not to find out.
Draco felt his impatience growing. He wasn't nervous. Surely he wasn't nervous. "So," he said, "what did you want to talk about?"
They were both breathless, sated and tangled together and eventually they fell asleep there on the floor. It was only later, in the small hours that Malfoy woke and dragged Harry to the new, unslept-in bed, where he curled himself around Harry from behind before falling asleep again. In the morning, Harry woke with Malfoy still wrapped around him and thought that if he could begin every morning like this, there couldn't be all that much wrong with the world.
He pulled up his knees and reached around, two fingers disappearing into himself, and Harry's cock grew harder than as he stroked lube over it. "God, Malfoy," he breathed.
Harry stood up, face-to-face with him, and didn't know what to say. Malfoy's expression gave him a sensation of vertigo, and if he wasn't careful, he was going to fall. But it might just be too late now, anyway. He could not deny to himself that he wanted to kiss Malfoy, but that could not happen. He took a deep breath. "Shall we?"
That was over the line. His headache grew to new proportions. He needed her to leave so that he could think properly, have a few minutes alone. He should have known better than to have answered the phone. He felt his eyebrows rise, his mouth tighten. "Believe it or not," he said icily, "being gay does not render a person entirely unattractive to the opposite gender. Just the contrary in some cases. In fact, I seem to recall an occasion about two years ago - "
"We haven't even talked about the war," Harry said. "But what about the gay part? I mean, do you think it's some sort of war trauma or something? Ginny says the reason I'm, er, sexually defective, as she put it, is because I grew up in a closet and have war trauma."
Malfoy ignored this, too. "Then why not form a new order?" he proposed, his voice still low. He glanced at the door to the dining room in unspoken caution. "Something smaller than this. And secret."
He went in to work late. His unfinished work from the previous afternoon lay piled where he had left it, and there were four notes from people asking if they could have meetings as soon as possible. Harry groaned and pushed all four of them aside, looking for the file he'd been working on the day before. He found his place and began to work again, glad to have the task to distract himself. The day passed without incident. He was tired from lack of sleep, and left when most other people left - hoping to avoid Malfoy leaving late, as seemed to be his habit.
Harry sagged with disappointment and went to sit on his own bed. Flopping backwards onto it, he went over what had just happened. All right. So, he'd felt whatever that had been with Malfoy back at the mosque. They'd kissed. He'd been very happy about that. They'd come back to talk and had ended up kissing again. They'd both gotten hard during it, and Malfoy had freaked out.
"Upstairs," Harry said again, relieved to change the subject and irked by the strange look on Ron's face. "I'll show you."
"We will decide when the appropriate time comes," a cold voice hissed menacingly. "Do not presume to command us yet, little empress."
Harry's temporary satisfaction with having shut Malfoy up faded. Fatigue swamped him; his muscles were protesting every move and the gash on his forehead was throbbing gently, though the salve had taken the heat away. He moved the bedroll he had slept in the previous time further from Malfoy's and wondered why no one else had thought of coming to Spinner's End from the battle. He didn't have much time to think before sleep swam over his vision, filling his mind with war images that he'd spent over three years trying to block out.
Harry sat down heavily in the dark, trying to process it all. Ginny had been involved in something that certainly sounded like a coup to take over the Ministry. As Minister for Magic? She had been working with Death Eaters to become Minister for Magic? She couldn't have waited until he retired and run for the office then? The treasury had started losing money when, three or four years earlier? Had Ginny always been involved? Was the scam of the Death Eaters' theft already in place when their paths and ambitions crossed, or had she had a hand in planning it? Worse, had she always been that ambitious? How had Harry not seen this in her complaints about his fame, his influence? He was known for his powers of observation as an Auror; here he had failed to observe his own wife's restive unhappiness that eventually led to this. It was almost impossible to grasp.
Malfoy's fingers gripped the flesh of Harry's back so hard he knew it would leave bruises and his breath came sharply. "Harry - " It was short, almost agonised, and Harry stopped.
The war had aged him prematurely, though he was still agile and fit. His eyes were hard and his smile less ready, and he had become quite controlling around the office since Voldemort's defeat. Particularly with Harry, or so Harry felt. It had also occurred to Harry more than once that, had they managed to extinguish all of the Death Eaters during the war, Harry would have personally made the Auror Department obsolete. It was a natural tension that existed in his relationships around the office.
Malfoy didn't say anything for a long time. Harry was about to prompt again, when it occurred to him that Malfoy was crying. He wasn't sobbing or anything like that, but his breathing was congested and his back heaving silently. Harry felt more awkward than ever. He'd dealt with people's emotional breakdowns during the war often enough, but they weren't Malfoy. It was just different. "Hey," he said, trying to sound soothing, but it just came out sounding rough. "It's okay. We can fix your office."
Potter shot him an irritated look. "I know you just love to help, but listen for one minute. Every student in this castle is in danger, including my son, who was attacked in some way Pomfrey still has not identified - my son who is your namesake. I've decided, therefore, to let you help a little more than the others. We're going to use your portrait as the entrance."
Pansy smirked. "Not personal experience, if that's what you're trying to ask, Potter. God, you have no subtlety whatsoever." She eyed him, the smirk lingering along with the smoke. "I've heard stories, that's all."
Draco pushed a little further in, waited, then experimentally pulled out a bit and began to thrust, very gently, with just the first two inches or so. He shifted, searching for something that was really much easier to find with one's fingers, and -
"The look on your face said as much, when you walked in," Malfoy said, cracking a smile. They were in front of the small restaurant and he pushed open the door. They found a table and Malfoy surreptitiously removed the crumbs and rings of wet left by pint glasses. "Why?" he resumed, sitting down across from Harry. "Do you just think I would make a terrible spy?"
Harry took a sip of water and set it down on the table beside the bed. "Well," he said carefully, "I was wondering what you're thinking about, uh, this. Us."
The Ministry was mostly dark. Few people worked on the weekends, though some jobs went round the clock. Harry was no fan of the Department of Mysteries, but he knew that those lights were on at the same time as all the other departments'. He took the lift to the seventh floor and went down to Malfoy's office.
"No. It would just complicate things." Draco didn't elaborate, and Potter didn't press it. He decided to steer the conversation in another direction. "And is your wife going to divorce you over a single kiss, Potter?"
Draco looked around and found another crate and kicked it over to where Potter was sitting. "I just wanted some air," he said. "You?" It was cool.
Malfoy moved over and put his head on Harry's shoulder, his arms circling Harry loosely. He didn't say anything. Harry put his arm around Malfoy and for a long time, they just sat where they were.
At first, like always, the streets were deserted. The fire was already dying down, the house more or less demolished. In the distance, Harry could hear the sirens approaching, but it was far too late. He pushed past the Muggle neighbours, none of whom seemed to remember him. Mrs. Figg was dead now, of course, had been for years. She hadn't stayed long after Harry had moved out, anyway. Someone touched his arm.
They reached the gates to the St. Elias Monastery, and Malfoy gave Harry a scrutinising look. "Maybe I'll take you to hear the prayer calls at the mosque tomorrow."
Draco felt a knot of worry coil into a knot in the base of his stomach. There was a But coming. He couldn't speak, so he just waited.
Malfoy still said nothing, and Harry had the feeling he'd said the wrong thing. He racked his brain to think of something better. "Do you want to talk about whatever it was?"
"It's for your kids' sake," Draco reminded him. "You wanted to spare them the media circus of having everyone come to see their 'two fathers' send them off, remember? So you'll stand by Ginny and I'll stand by Lisette and we'll all just pretend for a little while. And the people who don't know about us don't need to find out then and there. Once the boys are on the train, Ginny will take Lily somewhere and you and I will come home."
They were leaving the tube station now, Malfoy subtly guiding him through the crowd toward the exit they wanted. "It's not exactly my scene," Malfoy said. "But not a hard one to fake."
Scorpius knew how rare his apologies were, and accepted this one for what it was, nodding. "Okay," he said, subdued. "I'll do my best."
An hour later, Harry stood and stretched, his back cracking audibly. Malfoy, who had relaxed marginally as the meeting had progressed, looked over in amusement, but didn't say anything.
"It always has to be so complicated, doesn't it?" Malfoy leaned back and sighed. "I should have known better. Let's say we leave the issue of why your marriage has anything to do with your current choices. Given that it's you, I actually kind of get that. But back up a little. A complete failure? Really? That seems a bit hard to swallow, O saviour of the wizarding world, gazillion-time vanquisher of the Dark Lord and a good number of his henchmen, et cetera."
The floor outside his door creaked. Harry's heart appeared to leap into his throat. There was a long pause, as though whoever was on the other side was pondering whether or not he should knock. Was he hoping Harry was asleep? Hoping he was still awake? Harry didn't know. When the pause got too long, he got up, half wondering if he'd only imagined the sound, padded across the bare wooden floor and opened the door.
Draco waited, watching Shacklebolt look groggily around his magical cage. He chuckled. "Very impressive, Malfoy."
Harry looked at him. Malfoy turned on his side, facing away from Harry, and appeared to get comfortable - though Harry suspected he wasn't altogether easy with what had just happened, either. The temptation to stay and just sleep some more was terribly alluring. At the same time, he was terrified to face his own mind, very much afraid to think about any of this. A steady monologue of self-flagellation had already started chanting in his brain, and Harry was fairly certain that it was not about to go away.
Harry considered. Malfoy would kill him for saying anything, but he wasn't there. Besides which, Dudley was hardly much of a talker. "There's… well, there's something big going on, crime-wise. I'm trying to solve it."
Another exchange of looks. "We do admire your overall equanimity," Shacklebolt said. "But sometimes an outward calm can hide turmoil beneath the surface. In fact, quite often when people are that good at keeping up the impassive look, it's a cover. We've spent a good deal of time in the past three years trying to uncover your turmoil. Your turmoil is your weakness, the factor that will undo you. We have to drag it out into the look and examine it, find out why it's there and what it's doing to you, your life, your work."
"Rather," Harry said dryly. "Why?" He'd met the bloke in a different club - which one, he couldn't remember now - and, having drunk a little too much and lost a bit too much inhibition, allowed the bloke to give him a blow job in a darkened alley.
"Good point. I'll have to ask," Malfoy said again. "I'd also like to know if I have to keep the same disguise up for a full month, or if I'm allowed to switch it around now and then."
"I don't care." Ginny snatched the paper out of his hands and stuffed it into the wastepaper basket in the corner.
"Not usually," Draco said, glancing unwittingly across the station at where Harry stood, grouped so securely with his gaggle of people and looked back at his son. "Sometimes they make exceptions. Just play it by ear. And remember, it's not unusual for first years not to get onto the Quidditch teams. Sometimes there isn't space, that's all. Just do your work and do your best at everything."
Malfoy propped himself up on one elbow and looked down at him. "So did I," he said. "I admit, I was harbouring a secret hope that you might try it before my assignment ended and maybe find out that you liked it."
Harry realised his faux pas. "Would you like to come over?" he asked awkwardly, trying to take it back.
Williamson surveyed the room, which was filled with an uneasy murmuring, but no hands were raised. "Very well, then. Twitterbog?"
"Probably," Potter agreed amiably, and neither of them mentioned that the concept of the wizard who'd beaten Voldemort splinching himself was utterly ridiculous. Then again, Potter hadn't been drunk and humming under his breath at the time, either. He stumbled again and reached for Draco's arm, and it was possible that neither of them knew exactly what had happened next. All Draco knew was that Potter's breath was suddenly in his face and that his hands seemed to be pushing Potter's shoulders back against the brick and he was inches away from smothering that humming with his mouth. He couldn't help it; Potter was so rumpled and disarmingly attractive like this, all careless and dishevelled and Draco's trousers were decidedly too tight all of a sudden. It didn't cross his mind that he was in no way worthy of Potter, that Potter was in no fit state to be played with like this, but it wasn't just him playing, not when Potter was going for it with almost alarming enthusiasm. Their mouths came together hotly, Potter tasting of Guinness and something that just seemed uniquely Potter, and he probably tasted like gin and what if he did. Potter's mouth was like a drug, instantly addictive. It was like kissing a virgin, but as a father of three, Potter was no virgin.
Harry didn't answer this; he was pulling a light jumper on over his t-shirt. "Be back in awhile," he said after.
Potter smiled dreamily. "Good night." He was utterly pissed, tripping over the front stoop as he let himself into the shop.
He looked at Malfoy over the top of the parchment. "Interesting," Malfoy said. "So she does have information."
"One thing," Draco said, attempting to regain some measure of dignity, brushing himself off and avoiding Potter's eye.
"I have to fix some things up in London, but then if you want, I could stay in the castle," Potter offered. "I don't know. Become temporary assistant Muggle Studies professor or something. Flying instructor. Extra Quidditch referee. Gardener. Whatever you want."
The leader returned to the cart and resumed his position behind the goblin, including the wand to his head. "I don't suppose you want to say anything at this point."
"Yeah, fine," Harry said. "Uh, Dudley, this is my partner, like I said. Um, this is my cousin Dudley, like I told you."
Harry reached up and pushed his glasses up his nose. Still speaking into the sink, he said, "I saw Lupin not too long before I… and Moody. Moody was somewhere nearby. I don't know about everyone else. I - George - " He stopped, unable to go on.
He got a roomful of sorrowful headshakes and murmured negations. "They haven't been up here," Phineas Nigellus informed him. "Surely even you believe that we would have notified you or the Headmaster if they had."
"Dare I ask what's first? Do I want to know? You're not - " a horrid thought struck Harry - "making me go lingerie shopping with you, are you?" He had momentary visions of Malfoy dragging Harry through an Agent Provocateur, laughing himself sick at Harry's awkward pawings at various bits of silk and lace.
It was the first time either of them had said the word conspiracy. "Do you really think that's what it is?" Harry asked.
Malfoy's hand slipped down to touch it, fingers just grazing him, but Harry groaned so loudly that it startled him. Malfoy snickered softly then, his breath hot on Harry's chest, and his long middle finger pressed into the seam of Harry's crotch. "You like that?"
"Potter." Malfoy's voice was quiet but firm and something in it dragged Harry's eyes to his. "Where you put your cock doesn't affect your children. It only affects you. And me."
Potter shook his head. "I… I don't know how much you know about, well, the finer points of my work over the past ten years or so, but I've sort of invented a fair bit of magic along the way."
"Who said that?" It was clearly a rhetorical question. "All right. My plan for today should answer some of your questions. We're going to attempt - this is going to be tricky, Potter, and it may not work at all - but we are going to attempt to magically monitor a transfer. If my theories and information are right, one of the four accounts that does three transfers per year is due to make a transfer this evening. We're going to spend the afternoon figuring out if we can witness it. I'll get a read-out of the transfer itself tomorrow, but I'd like to see if I can get a magical trace from observing the actual shift of gold. And I want to see where the recipient vault is."
Harry smiled. "I did, too." He kept his arm around Albus and fell into silence. It hadn't actually occurred to him that Malfoy's son might essentially become his step-son and his kids' step-brother. What a thought.
There was a long silence that seemed anything but silent; it hammered against Harry's ears and compelled him to think of something to say. Fear was drowning everything else out, fear as he had never felt it before. The very dark seemed an insurmountable threat, but to cast a lumos seemed worse, if possible.
Potter glanced around the nearby portraits. "Can you check the ones on the east wall here? I'll look over here."
"No!" Harry said quickly. "No one sent me. I don't know why else, then. I just… I guess I have a lot of respect for you. I know I've probably never said."
Malfoy looked at him and raised his eyebrows. "No obligation," he said, his tone dropping several degrees. "I just thought, since we're going to be working together - "
On the third night after Palmyra, which was beginning to be Harry's way of counting the days, they talked again. They were leaning against a high bit of wall, looking down on the houses below in their convoluted courtyards. Somewhere beneath them, a fountain was trickling. There were wild roses and the ubiquitous jasmine blooming everywhere and the air was heavy with their scent.
The question was out, right there between them. Harry's face grew hot. "No," he mumbled. "Have you?"
"No, I do," Harry said, rather more forcibly than Draco was expecting. "I'm ready. I already - you know - prepared, in the bedroom."
Malfoy released him, breathing hard. "I wanted to," he said, as though there had been no break. "I wanted to tell you."
Harry couldn't make words happen, so he gave a stiff shrug instead and walked away from the door. Malfoy came in and carefully closed the door behind himself. He surveyed the living room, Harry's shoes and robes littering the floor. He didn't say anything, clearly waiting for Harry to start.
"I want you to give a fuck," Malfoy said, through clenched teeth. "I thought that maybe the so-called saviour of the world could actually spare a passing bit of compassion for someone who made a mistake - made a lot of mistakes - but apparently I was wrong."
"Sure." Harry cleared his throat. "That's the boyfriend's job, right?" he said, making an extremely light joke.
"There's a lot more out there that you've probably never tried at all, because you're too busy with your Auror career, your girlfriend, and your self-pity complex about how you had to fight a war. News flash, Potter. The rest of us had a war, too." Malfoy delivered this all quite evenly, enough so that Harry wondered if the fresh air alone had sobered him up.
Draco shook his head. "Too complicated," he reiterated. "I don't need to get into your issues, Potter." Why were his hands shaking? "And besides which, I only asked you for a drink because I thought you might be having a difficult time. That's all it was."
"I don't know. Try something." They were passing through a hall of mirrors, but Dumbledore knew the way through. Draco waited until they were in another small room where Elizabethans were drinking tea, and cast the spell to tell the time. It was the same as what his watch still told. Only ten minutes had passed, but it felt as though hours had already gone by. He cast an orientating spell and that did not work. Interesting.
Dumbledore chuckled. "It may be. That was quick and creative thinking, my boy. Or should I say, Professor Malfoy." He twinkled at Draco from over his half-moon glasses and Draco had to smile back.
"Not really," Harry said, sighing. "Hermione knows better. I tend to take people's heads off when they push. Ron doesn't like talking about any of it any more than I do."
Malfoy waved this away, still smirking. "I would say that I never would have thought I would see you startled, if I wasn't rather acutely aware that there's something else you're afraid of, too."
Beside him, Malfoy shifted. "Is it just me, or is it darker in this wing?" he muttered, leaning closer to be heard. "It's a little creepy."
The match lasted three and a half hours and was very close, an exciting game that brought Draco back to his own Quidditch days, the sense of speeding through the air on your own power alone, coupled with the Levitation Charm on the broom. The thrill of the hunt for the Snitch, the rush of wind against his face as he spiralled into a dive. He'd nearly always caught the Snitch. Only Potter beat him every time they had ever played against one another. The adrenaline sang in his ears all over again. He didn't even have team loyalties any more, but he cast his lot with Potter's and hoped for the Cannons. They won, and it was exhilarating. Potter relaxed entirely once the match began, talking excitedly about the flying moves, the strategies, the Snitch. He even referred to moves Draco had made, back in their Hogwarts days, and Draco understood that Potter had dropped the cool front. When the Cannons won, the crowd on their side of the stadium roared their approval and, on their feet with everyone else, Potter spontaneously flung his arms around Draco.
Harry was surprised. "No one but him? I thought that usually the younger Death Eaters were given assignments and whatever else by other - "
Harry agreed readily. Later, they got dressed and Malfoy went downstairs with him to find his shirt and glasses. They went to the front door and kissed again. Malfoy unlocked the door and took down the wards.
Potter wasn't fooled by his assumed disinterest for a moment and it showed. He narrowed his eyes. "I need to know if there are Death Eater portraits in Hogwarts," he said quietly. "Any at all."
Right, not oblivious, then. "I need to talk to you," Harry said, drumming his fingers against his thigh.
Harry could feel his eyes on himself without looking. "I don't know. I'm so confused and… all of this is a bit hard to take in. I don't know what I want."
He woke hours later, midday sun streaming in through a crack in the curtains and onto his bare chest. There was something heavy and warm beside him and his thoughts were a jumbled mass, confused. He turned and saw blond hair on the other pillow. Malfoy. The memories rushed back. Ginny. The coup. The Death Eaters. Dolohov. He woke fully, remembering everything. And Malfoy. Here beside him, when Harry had thought it could never work again, given that Malfoy had known what he had known. But he was there, and Harry couldn't bring himself to resent it. He was quiet, looking at Malfoy, thinking about Dolohov, thinking about Malfoy. Malfoy turned in his sleep and draped a heavy arm over Harry's torso, breathing heavily. The weight of it was comfortable, not exactly familiar, but it could so easily become familiar and Harry wanted it to. Ginny had never been one to stay close during the night, always complaining of being hot. It was rather nice.
"Nail on the head, Potter. It takes a bit of concentration, I must say." Malfoy was full of smug confidence, though his gaze wandered to one of the larger cauldrons not far from Harry's chair.
She did, and her white cheeks flushed with anger. "You're actually doing this. Trying to change the topic about where the hell you were last night to that time when I didn't feel like indulging you."
Draco shrugged. He wasn't about to go into it in detail, not with Potter. "It seemed like a good idea at the time."
"We're going to die here, you know," Malfoy said quietly, shattering the silence, echoing Harry's unspoken thoughts.
He was both hurt and embarrassed by it, as well as a little angry. What the hell was Malfoy's problem? Were Harry's feelings that obvious? They must have been, given what Pansy had said. If Malfoy was trying to make the point that he wasn't interested and never had been, that their drunken encounter had been a ridiculous mistake - confirmed by Harry's lousy performance - then he'd made it. Harry saw no need for him to go on making it every time they happened to be in a room together. He also didn't understand why he would sometimes find Malfoy watching him resentfully, something hateful smouldering in those unfathomable eyes.
"Are you saying I was a negligent father?" Harry was angrier than ever, mostly because it was true. "All right, so I was. Are you happy? I wasn't home enough, and I apparently didn't even know the person I was married to and knew for most of my life at all! Are you happy? Is that what you want me to say?"
Hermione stirred half a teaspoon of sugar into her tea. Calmly, she said, "I know there are physical issues between you. I think that's probably what started all this."
Malfoy was getting it on both ends and his hips were moving steadily, alternately pushing his cock into Harry's fist or himself back onto Harry's fingers. He was breathing even harder. "Yeah." He was almost hoarse, his voice ragged.
It was hard to believe that domesticity had actually come so easily to them. They had their issues, certainly, but living together had not been one of the main ones. Draco supposed that they'd each learned how to live with another person and put up with their flaws already. And once you had children, many a meticulously-laid plan or system was ruined. Scorpius had always been a fairly self-contained, well-behaved child. Neither he nor Lisette would have permitted anything else, but small children are laws unto themselves. And now he was eleven and going away. Draco shut away the unwelcome thought, despite the fact that the day had arrived, and far too soon at that. There was still so much to say, to teach, and now those days were nearly over. Only summers and Christmas break, and those he would share with Lisette. Never mind. Draco, riding the Underground with Harry and Albus, thought of the subdued breakfast they'd had. Harry had washed the dishes as Draco cleaned up the detritus from the table before tactfully leaving the two of them on their own. He could hear from the other room that they weren't talking, but he knew Harry, knew that he would want it that way.
Harry put his mouth near Malfoy's ear, lips brushing it. "Take off the glamours. I want to try this… you know. With you as you."
He heard the rustle of clothing and then she appeared in the doorway. "Honey, don't be like that." The faux-sweetness was back, but she sounded tired. "I'll go if you need a date. I'd love to go to that ball. You know that."
"I suppose," Ginny said with great sarcasm, "that he was just so hot as a girl that you couldn't wait to get your hands on him. And then - oh, God."
Nothing. His eyes met Malfoy's, and neither of them said anything. Malfoy took the wand back and looked at it. His chest rose and fell heavily. Obviously struggling to keep his voice level, he said, "I guess it doesn't work any more."
Malfoy came to stand in the doorway. He was breathing hard, his hair tangled and dirty, and there was a smear of blood on his cheek. "I have some, so stop grousing." He reached under his cloak to unbuckle a flat pouch strapped to his torso. Reaching into it, he pulled out a tiny vial of clear liquid. "Here. Just a drop or two. It stops the pain now and the itching later, which I consider a bonus, personally."
Harry couldn't bring himself to meet Malfoy's eyes. "Did it?" he muttered. "I didn't see you getting… you know, like this."
"Tell me," he insisted. "You know it's true. I know it's true. I know you didn't like me; we never liked each other. But the whole world has changed since all that."
Or. Or he could dive into this thing and take everything that came with it. He looked up, his eyes meeting Malfoy's. "I'm tired of deception."
Snape harrumphed and said, "Good. Now why don't you go and talk to Dumbledore's portrait. I was in the middle of a nap."
Harry watched her and wondered how he could have deceived himself for as long as he had, too. "Will you stay in touch?" he asked softly.
Williamson acknowledged this with the smallest of nods. "Precisely," he said, and left it at that. "Good luck, gentleman. We'll speak in a month. Meanwhile, may I just say that we decided to pair you two together, despite sundry past differences, because we think you'll do admirably together. I myself have noticed that you seem to have become friends, or at least friendly acquaintances. I'm glad. See if you can keep it up, will you?"
Harry stared at him and found he couldn't put any of the things he wanted to say into words. He seized Malfoy by the back of his neck and kissed him, hard. Malfoy made a small sound of some sort, and then his mouth moved against Harry's, kissing back furiously. He was tense, his arms were straight at his sides, but he wasn't objecting to the kiss in the slightest, his mouth opening under the prompting of Harry's, their tongues mashing wetly together. Harry's glasses grew steamy with breath condensation, but he didn't take them off until they began to cut into Malfoy's cheekbone, at which point Malfoy reached up and clawed them off, not even pausing for breath.
"Interesting?" Ron said, squinting at the parchment. "It doesn't sound like he has to do anything at all!"
He was leading Harry toward the lifts. Harry followed him, and felt slightly better, though he didn't ask about Malfoy.
Apparently satisfied with this, Malfoy stuck one hand out to the side. "Accio blanket," he said. The blanket in the middle of the floor didn't budge. "You try it."
Scorpius looked at Draco again. "Come back," was all he said, but Draco heard the tightness in his voice.
Potter heaved a sigh. "I need to stay for a little while. It's related to an investigation. I can't say more, but I technically need your permission, as you are the Headmaster, though I still don't know how or why that happened, but as you said, the castle is now your jurisdiction and even I can't override that."
Malfoy gave him a curious look, but didn't say anything. They were held up by a slow restaurant and got to the pub about fifteen minutes past nine. Harry strode into the murky dark, scanning for his three closest friends. Malfoy was still holding his hand. He'd changed before dinner, wearing a Slytherin green summer dress with little straps and a plunging neckline. Harry was having trouble keeping his eyes away from the last, and knew that Malfoy had caught him at it at least once. Harry spotted them, crammed around a corner table and went across to join them, Malfoy in tow.
Only it was more than that. They would know if it was just put on. He would know. It did have to be genuine if it was going to accomplish the task they had set him: to get past his own personal weakness of character. He knew in his heart of hearts that it was more than just Potter. It was about turning tail when the going got tough. And while joining the Ministry's side of the war instead of waiting it out in Italy like Blaise or Switzerland like Pansy, he'd stuck it out in England and fought. Surely that had to speak well of his strength of character. Draco thought of Dumbledore, saw his wand wavering as his resolve crumbled before his eyes and clenched his jaw in remembered humiliation. They were right. It was a weakness, and a weakness that could betray him if he didn't take care of it. Potter was certainly the trigger he'd possessed the longest: the instant path to his own insecurity and consequent anger.
Draco hesitated. Was it too friendly? What was he doing, anyway? A small, mean voice in the back of his head suggested that he was attempting to take advantage of Potter while he was down. Possibly so. On the other hand, who else would understand what Potter was going through? Not that he was about to play therapist to anyone, least of all Potter. But somehow, it seemed that the extended Weasley family could hardly be thrilled with him at the moment. Why not extend the invitation? It was unlikely that Potter would accept, anyway. He hit "send".
They'd eaten breakfast at the monastery, under the beaming smile of the house chef, but a few hours had passed since then. "Sure," Harry said.
Draco knew an uncomfortable stirring, these very words having been uttered by Potter that morning. Nevertheless. "I owe Potter senior a life debt," he said stiffly. "Furthermore, they have more cause to suspect us than we have them. We are ex-Death Eaters."
"Your skills?" Harry repeated, just for something to say. It had been too long since he'd responded to something Malfoy said, at least verbally. He was responding physically quite adequately, it seemed.
He grabbed Draco's hand and tried to pry it off, but Draco snatched his hand away and slapped his. "You stop it," he said intensely. "Just let me do this."
He stopped again, maybe thinking that it was still quite possible that Harry would do exactly that. Harry didn't move to confirm or deny it. "I was married," he said quietly, addressing Malfoy's fingertips where they rested warmly against his skin. "I have children. I didn't… I'm not the kind of person who would - "
"Anything that isn't metal," Malfoy said. "On the bench here, there's a wooden spoon you could use."
The door closed and Harry forgot her immediately, pulling the scrolls from the legs of his children's owl one at a time. "All right, Percival, let's see what you've got." The owl nipped his finger and Harry absently reached into a desk drawer to find a couple of owl treats to keep the bird quiet.
Harry looked at him, simultaneously reluctant and relieved to have the opportunity to have a free invitation to do so. Malfoy looked better than he had in days. His hair was clean and rather shiny, and the clothes he was wearing beneath the work robes were obviously designer and fit rather well. Rather too well. Harry's eyes travelled down over Malfoy's body before he could prevent himself, and Malfoy caught him at it. Harry cleared his throat again and came up with the right answer. "You're sober," he said.
He could not face Malfoy, not like this, with his mind still whirling in confusion and anger. The first time, it had taken Harry by surprise. But the second time, he should have known better than to have let it happen. Malfoy should have known better, too. Hadn't he said he didn't want it, in the park? But then, he had allowed it in the office. He had. Harry could not escape that fact. And - though he hated the thought, he could not bring himself to believe that it was not true - he had liked it, at least until it had become too intense. Or something. Too frightening. Too real. Harry shook his head, trying to clear it, and stepped into the Floo when he came to the front of the queue. He made it home without seeing Malfoy.
Ron shook himself and took another gulp of beer. "Sorry, mate. From here, she - he - whatever - doesn't even look like Malfoy. Just really hot. I don't know how you aren't distracted by it all the time."
"Right, you're not a big beer drinker," Harry said, choosing to ignore the other obvious issue and recalling instead the night that Malfoy had finally broken through Ron's defences - namely by having (reluctantly) accepted Ron's challenge to a beer drinking contest. Ron being Ron, the contest was to end when the first person vomited or passed out. Malfoy had exceeded everyone's expectations by beating Ron soundly, though after Ron finally excused himself to the men's, a sickly shade of green, Malfoy slid right off his bench and passed out under the table.
James jumped off the monkey bars, discovered the cushioning charm and began to jump on it as though it were a trampoline. Malfoy watched him for a second, then jerked a chin in his direction. "You might want to stop him doing that."
Harry couldn't look at her, staring at what had been the bed, the ruins of the house. "I can't believe they would do this," he heard himself mumble.
"I'm quite happily single, as a matter of fact," Draco said. He drained his glass and nodded at Potter's. "What are you drinking? Can I get you something? I need a refill."
"I actually don't think the you part has anything to do with it, actually. Unless it's just that we were friends already. I mean, the rest is all past," Harry said. There was a pause and Malfoy didn't say anything. "So you do think I'm unredeemably gay."
"Of course you're not." He was abrupt, dismissive. "You're Harry Potter. Case in point. But now… I mean, your wife - "
Draco pulled out Susan Bones' letter and scanned it again, though he didn't need to. "It started with smaller pranks about three months ago, then progressed into nastier pranks, and recently it seems to have culminated into one of them leaving the other strung up to a Quidditch goal hoop for several hours before his housemates were tipped off anonymously. That's already far enough."
"And you have a godson, I believe?" Malfoy was being carefully polite, switching into lighter, safer territory. Harry realised that he had been speaking openly before, and some shutter had dropped back into place. Harry had snapped at him and Malfoy had retreated.
"You used it once, when we talked about Ginny before. The thing that means that you only like someone because they're always around."
"I thought you didn't want to do this, since it turned into something you weren't expecting." Malfoy set Ron's file aside and scanned Hermione's.
"I know that." Harry moved to him and deliberately put a hand on Malfoy's crotch, his palm pressing into the hard length. He had never touched Malfoy's cock before. He had never touched anyone's cock before. His eyes on Malfoy's, Harry carefully took off the rest of his clothes. "I want you," he said.
"It wasn't your fault, either!" Now Malfoy was angry, too. "Damn it, Potter, not everything is within your control! You weren't responsible for her decisions; she was. She made her own choices, and she chose to keep it from you. She was - "
Harry discovered simultaneously that he was angry and that it wasn't directed fully at Malfoy. "I'd rather not." It came out sounding angry.
It felt… magical, for lack of a better word. Harry looked around himself in wonder, moved by something somehow deeper and more profound than what he normally felt. He could not have said what it was that he was feeling, but it felt like a strange combination of this place, this sense of ancient history, and Malfoy. All of it together. They walked around the mosque together, careful to avoid the rows of those praying along the Eastern wall.
Harry swung around, startled, heart pounding in his ribcage. She was sitting in the armchair, but was so low down in it that he hadn't seen her. "You scared me," he said, trying to sound like it was just a case a minor start, not the guilty shock it had been.
Draco shifted slightly, his balls wedged up against the soft interior of Harry's upper thigh. "A bit."
By one-thirty, Harry admitted to himself that Malfoy was not looking for him and that he was tired of pretending he wasn't hoping that he was, and went to bed.
He knew that he would know. Know, and feel terrible. But would he feel badly enough not to pursue Malfoy? He couldn't answer this. The thought of finding some other bloke to hook up with had not occurred to Harry. It was Malfoy in particular that he wanted. He had acknowledged this quietly to himself but didn't know what to make of it.
"Oh. Er, sure. Thanks." Harry glanced at Seamus, who shrugged, and pulled out the chair across from him. Malfoy's barely-civil attempt at civility didn't fool him. It was obvious that Malfoy was pissed off about something, though whether it was Harry's apparently poor performance or the fact that the entire thing had happened in the first place, Harry didn't know. The dynamics in the kitchen were strained; Malfoy's silence seemed to fill the room. Seamus let the topic of proper boiling length go and Malfoy stood by the range, glowering at the eggs as they bumped gently against the side of the pot.
There was a long silence. Malfoy appeared to be contemplating the palms of his hands or possibly the faded oriental carpet. After a little while, he said, very quietly, "This will probably make you feel sick, Potter."
Malfoy did not attend the trial. Harry heard a rumour that he had not been at any of the trials other than those at which he was required to give testimony. As for his own, Harry had been there. Malfoy had been tried along with his parents, and in light of his father's sins, both his and Narcissa's had faded utterly into the background. Both had been released without sentence. Harry had provided the details of Malfoy's refusal to identify himself, Ron, and Hermione to the Wizengamot before the trial had begun, and knew that it would factor into the sentencing. Lucius had died in Azkaban years later. Harry had never known the precise reasons why, had never asked.
"That was as good as I thought it would be," Malfoy said, sounding immensely satisfied and rather drowsy.
A sound made Harry turn. It seemed to come from near Malfoy's desk, so he went back the way he had come. With growing wariness, he saw the bottle first, then the hand and the arm. It was attached to Malfoy, who was lying on the floor beneath his desk, curled into fetal position. Harry forgot his personal confusions and crouched down. "Malfoy?"
The room had disappeared. They were standing outside, in what looked like the city limits of a large city. Manchester, Harry guessed; they'd once had a base near there. "Come on!" he said. "We need to get away before they follow us. Not Base 22. Grimmauld Place. Can you manage that far?"
Bastard always had liked taking credit for other people's work. Still, though, he'd turned out to be okay, once he'd joined the Order and all that. Not that Harry went out of his way to talk to him, but Malfoy was a good asset to have in an army. He was certainly devious enough to help with the espionage teams, and braver than people gave him credit for. It still didn't mean they had to be friends, and they weren't. Cautiously civil acquaintances at best.
She exhaled. "Better late than never. Maybe this will make it easier to move on, if I'm not waiting for something that's never going to happen any more."
Neville coughed. "Uh, we got our clearance, Harry," he said, into the brief moment of ensuing silence. "We can go back to St. Mungo's today."
"You all know why we are here," Arthur continued. He had a single piece of parchment on the table before him, but he did not consult it. "We must decide whether or not to continue the existence of the Order of the Phoenix."
Harry took a long drink of his beer, wiped the corner of his mouth and studied Malfoy for a moment. "So, if you don't want to talk about your divorce, that's fine, but… "
The Prophet seems to think you're moving out. Is that correct? If so, you may be busy, but if you'd care to meet me for a drink, it's on me. I could have done with the same when I moved out. If you like, meet me at the LC around 7pm if it's convenient.
Potter made him wait a full five more minutes, then appeared in the doorway, located Draco almost at once, and walked casually over. He pulled out a chair and sat down. "Sorry I'm late," he said.
Draco waved back, smiling wryly, and turned to Dumbledore. "Now we go down," Dumbledore said. Draco saw Potter watching through the frame and nodded at him, silently trying to reassure him, despite not having anything to base any sort of reassurance upon.
"Of course," Potter said. "I didn't think they'd been up here. Somehow I don't think they could get in here. I meant in other parts of the castle."
Potter looked taken aback but recovered swiftly, his cheeks colouring again. Or perhaps they were still flushed from before. "This is just water," he said. "I wasn't planning to drink tonight, but I suppose one can't hurt."
Malfoy's tone was cool, but somehow it wasn't convincing. "I have no intention of forcing my presence on you."
She sounded tired. It was Friday and it had been a long week. The boys went to nursery school, but they were home by three every afternoon and Ginny had them to herself until Harry was home around seven or eight, depending on the day. And much as they both loved the kids, it was very tiring.
Potter shoved a bunch of fingers through his tangled hair. "Malfoy, I'm a little busy," he said shortly. "I spoke to Albus and told him the pranks were to stop. I didn't know he put your son's broom up there. He won't do it again." He thought about this, chewing on his lip for a second. "Well, he might," he admitted. "I can't control that. But he knows that he'll be in deep trouble if he does."
Potter's eyes skated down over his front and it looked like he was going to say something, but changed his mind. "All right. I'll be right back." He bolted, leaving Draco standing by the table.
Draco didn't know what to say. He turned around to face Potter instead. "Does that mean I get a goodbye blow job before you turn me into oil on canvas forever? I'd hate to have to ask Snape, as I'll be sharing his frame, apparently."
"And what about with you?" Harry asked, probing Malfoy's face. Malfoy wasn't looking back at him, though.
"Whatever makes you happy," Harry said, still amused. "But yeah, I thought it worked really well. And you're very convincingly feminine, so kudos, I guess."
"About two blocks from you," Malfoy said, eyeing stirring his latte as though suspicious of its contents.
The meeting was held in the dining room strictly because it was the warmest place in the house, and they could not afford to heat the entire monolith that was Grimmauld Place. Harry, wearing someone else's cardigan (whose, he didn't know), pulled it tightly around himself but didn't button it. The dining room was directly above the kitchen and shared the same heating duct. Molly had brought the rather temperamental kettle up from the basement and left it on the sideboard. The kettle had boiled recently; it was spluttering to itself and occasionally releasing a hiss of steam that could take the unwary by surprise. From a safe distance, Harry poured himself a cup of tea from the covered pot and shuffled to the table. He hated morning meetings.
"That's a pattern. A descending pattern with a complication about the four accounts, or does that not matter for numerology?"
"The court case reviews," Harry said. "Same as everyone else. What day do you want us to go? Any special instructions?"
"I can't believe you," Potter said, obviously trying to keep his voice down, but struggling. "I thought you were completely genuine. I thought you were actually as happy as I was about what was happening. I can't believe you deceived me that convincingly - and for so long! How long would you have let it go, Malfoy? Were you planning to out me publicly? Did someone pay you? What? I don't understand. Even you. How you could do this?"
This was news. Then again, so was the fact that Draco Malfoy worked for the Ministry in the first place. "Okay," he said again. "So where do I come in? You think it's going to Death Eaters? How would they have gained access?"
Harry groaned, not knowing whether Malfoy meant Ron or Ginny, but either of their reactions could lead to trouble. "Oh my - " He changed directions suddenly, remembering his assignment and reserving his judgement. "Fine. Good. That should be interesting."
Lupin gave him a concerned look and drained the sink, wringing out the dishcloth. "Have you started thinking about what you want to do when this is over and we're all out of here?"
"No!" Malfoy was glaring right back at him. "Of course not! I'm trying to tell you that nobody's marriages are perfect, and this wasn't your fault!"
Potter shook his head rapidly, but there was no embarrassment. "No. Never. I haven't even kissed anyone quite like that. A bloke, I mean. I've obviously…" he trailed off, perhaps feeling that mentioning Ginny at this point would be tactless.
The next day, Harry was in the chilled sunroom in the fourth gable on the east side of the house, reading the Prophet. The entire household shared only two subscriptions, and to keep people from wandering off with the paper to their rooms or other parts of the house, they had agreed to keep both copies in the (unheated) gable where they could be read but not removed. Malfoy came in while Harry was looking longingly at flat rentals. He looked up, saw Malfoy and dropped the page he'd been holding. "Hi," he said, too fast.
"That's ultimately what I'm trying to find out," Malfoy said. "The money is traceable, but no one but the goblins have access to the tracing, and even then, it's very limited and they would never let that kind of info slip or be left lying around or speak about it in a way that we could overhear. I'm trying to backtrack it to the source. If we can figure out who's behind it, I think that will tell us exactly what we need to know to crack this thing. I suspect that Egypt comes into this somehow; after all, all of our money originates there, and so do the goblins who handle it. But that's just a hunch, I don't have any of the finer details."
Harry nodded. "I wonder where they're going. Or do the carts only go one way?" He performed the spell and held out his own palm.
"It's not fair that the war has already taken over our entire lives, essentially. I kept going thinking that there might be another side someday. That it might end and we'd get our lives back."
She flapped off with a decided air of relief. "Messy thing," sniffed Phineus Nigellus over his right shoulder.
Harry nodded slowly, thinking. He had to tell her, and soon. "Look, Gin," he blurted, not terribly gracefully, "can we get together and talk sometime soon?"
"Look, Harry. My hand is on your cock, which is at half-mast at least, I might add, and obviously I get off on it, too. I don't know why you're so hung-up about it."
Draco was fondly reminded of himself for a moment, and his fondness made him all the more harsh. "May I remind you that we are no longer at war," he said sharply. "To provoke the son of Harry Potter this way risks my reputation and our family's. You know how much of your own lifetime it has taken for us to gain the respect of the magical community again. I understand how obnoxious Potter and his offspring are, but you must treat them with respect. Potter is still Head Auror. He could make our lives difficult."
"Oh, and not telling me you were in training - finished your training, whatever - wasn't a lie of omission?" Potter returned, colour staining his cheeks darkly.
Harry tried to make himself absorb this. It was difficult. "Are you trying to tell me that you really were interested all along?"
It might have worked if it had not started to become more and more apparent that he was not, perhaps, what Ginny had wanted, either. He disappointed her constantly. A small altercation would take place, and Harry would find her eyes upon him as though seeing him properly for the first time, an unmistakeable stain of disappointment or even disgust on her face. Because he had forgotten to replace the liner in the rubbish bin under the sink. Because he had forgotten to use the complex Muggle lock on the broom shed along with the usual wards. Because he had taken the call from Hermione and forgotten to pass it along. Because Hermione had called for Harry and not Ginny in the first place. Because he often seemed more animated with Ron and Hermione than he did with her. He couldn't help it, Harry had thought resentfully, too often aware that when Ron and Hermione were around, she had fallen into sulky silence again, either feeling excluded or having excluded herself. They squabbled. The squabbles turned into arguments. The arguments turned into real fights, dangerous fights. Besides Ginny's issues with the Golden Trio, as she insisted on calling them, the other repeat topic was Harry's fame and influence. He had expostulated that it was hardly his fault, that he didn't like it, either. That he could protect the kids from the media only so far. That he had neither the power to restrain the media from its love affair with him, nor censorship over the things they said about Ginny. Which, judging from her complaints, had more to do with not enough being said than what was actually being said. Harry had gone so far as to have accused her of being jealous of the media attention, and she'd gone flame-red and hexed him, slamming the bedroom door and locking him out for the night. Normally they made a large effort to hide the fighting from the kids, but Albus' questions had been hard to sidestep that particular time.
"That's why you love me." Draco gave him a rare, sweet smile, then pulled out his wand and began to cast cleaning charms all over the car and themselves. "Besides, now you don't have to go any more. Think of all the time we saved now that we don't have to stop."
"I should have known. I should have seen it. I should have stopped it. I should have figured it out - "
"Meet us in the conference room in the Auror Department," Shacklebolt said. "We'll spend the morning reviewing your personal information and so forth. It will work like an interview, at least at first. Let's say two o'clock."
Potter laughed, both looking and sounding guilty. "How did you know? That's your seat belt there - put it on - and if you want to know about anything, just say the word. So, where are we going?"
Harry nodded, thinking about this. Imagining Malfoy - no, full stop there. Not a good mental image. "I bet you top with Muggles," he said, narrowing his eyes.
Malfoy's eyes were intent upon his fingers, then his face. "Christ, Potter, I would think you didn't know how buttons operated if I hadn't just seen you take your own shirt off. Hurry up!"
Clutching his broom, Harry looked down again at his Disillusioned feet shuffling along as they stuck out from under the invisibility cloak. Beside him in the cloak's tent-like stuffiness, Malfoy was breathing reminders, and Harry needed them, even if he didn't need Malfoy's unwelcome proximity. It was distracting. He was listening and nodding, though Malfoy wasn't looking, absorbing everything and subconsciously double-checking Malfoy's Disillusionment on his feet. He'd been incredulous at the thought of only Disillusioning his feet, but Harry pointed out that, as Malfoy's plan required his cloak, they were both tall and would need to take more precautions than simply hoping that the goblins didn't notice their feet wandering about Gringotts unattended.
"Fine. I'd rather let the subtext do the talking, anyway," Malfoy said breezily. His hand, as they went around the stacks of apples, brushed Harry's arse. Harry flinched, immediately cursing himself for his jumpiness. Malfoy chuckled under his breath. "I see you're not arguing for once," he murmured.
"She wanted it to be me. You know. Buying baby things with her and decorating a nursery and stuff. She said that, last Christmas."
After what seemed like a short eternity, Malfoy broke away and said, "If you're just fucking with me, I'll never forgive you. Just so you know."
The tomb of Salah al-Din was reverently quiet. No hawkers followed them there, though Harry had just recently been persuaded to purchase a thyme-filled, horseshoe-shaped flatbread pastry of sorts for the equivalent of about eight Knuts, from an eight-year-old boy. "Shukran," he'd said, and the boy had beamed. Thank you.
Harry hadn't finished his tea, but it seemed rude to say so, so he didn't. "Sure," he said. "My cubicle isn't nearly as fun as this, but maybe sometime I'll call and see if you want to come for a coffee break somewhere outside the offices or something."
Right. Harry nodded. "Sure," he said, trying to keep his voice light. "Er - just so you know, Malfoy's here."
Harry swallowed the last bit of his late breakfast or early lunch and used the serviettes to mop up his hands. "What is that supposed to mean?"
Potter's email etiquette was dreadful. Quelle surprise. Draco sighed and wondered if Potter would be as belligerent as the time before.
Harry shook his head. "I thought maybe we should name someone after Fred, or maybe her father, but she didn't want that. Our daughter is Lily Ginevra, after her and my mother."
The bedrolls weren't exactly in a row, but scattered randomly across the floor. Neville's was closest to the window with Malfoy's the nearest to his. Then it was Harry's and Ron's, but at a completely different angle, and Seamus was somewhere near the door. Seamus switched off the light and everyone got quiet.
Harry was just leaving the kitchen after he'd eaten lunch, about to leave for the Ministry, when he saw Malfoy for the first time that day. He was just about to start up the stairs when Malfoy appeared at the top. They both stopped. Then Harry smiled. Malfoy smiled back and came down the stairs.
"She said he was wearing a black, hooded cloak that partially hid his face," Draco said flatly. "And she was instinctively afraid of him. And no, she didn't see where he went. When she looked again, he was gone, although he had apparently been on the point of speaking to her when her classmates approached."
"Would you spit it out?" Malfoy looked disgusted. "I know what you're trying to say. Or what you don't want to say because you can't even acknowledge that it's true. You know it's true and I know it's true, so there's no point in us standing here for half an hour while you try to muster the balls to get it out of your mouth."
Harry almost said, "How would you know?" and bit it back, forgetting that that particular mean joke was one that Malfoy had probably not been in on, back when people still made jokes like that. No one even knew if it was true, but in the earlier days of the war, making jokes about Malfoy's virginity had once been quite popular amongst his friends. Harry caught himself just in time and was profoundly grateful that he hadn't actually said it. And suddenly rather curious to know the truth. "More crowded with two," Harry said instead.
Draco hit him on the knee. "I'd better be. The only living creature who could possibly be better than me would be a giraffe or something, and that's just wrong."
Ron met Harry's eyes across the table and was still looking shell-shocked. "Holy shit," he said weakly.
Harry laughed and Malfoy smiled reluctantly. "You're not half bad, yourself," Harry said. "Look. I like this. And I think I want it to keep going. I don't really care what we call it."
"No, I'm really - I'm sorry," Harry repeated, unable to look Malfoy in the eye. "I - there's no excuse. I've been horrible."
"I guess I do suppose," Harry said, reading the first few lines of his. "Looks like we're partners, mate."
Harry laughed, though he was thinking of the Vanishing Cabinet. Malfoy was creative enough when he had reason to be. "Fair enough. Well, first things first. Breakfast?"
Harry stowed his wand away and felt the tension leave his shoulders. "Okay, listen to this and tell me if I'm saying it right: wahid, itnein, talata, arba'a - " he struggled with that one and tried it again - "arba'a, khamsa, sitta, saba'a, tamanyi, tisa, ashara."
"If that's your way of telling me I need to experiment, then we can consider that the experiment. It failed. The end."
He had stayed at Malfoy's and got showered and dressed there, wearing robes over his clothes for the first time in a month, as they were Apparating. Malfoy was fussing with his tie in the mirror as Harry attempted to do something with his hair. Scowling at his reflection, Malfoy was the first to say something about it. "So. You want me to wait until you've been there a few minutes before I come?"
"Since about three months ago," Susan said with a sigh. "It just wasn't as common before. I don't know what's going on with him. Apparently he doesn't really talk to anyone, and his moods have been getting worse and worse."
Malfoy's eyes bored into his. "Pay attention, Potter. Weasley. I'm asking why you broke up with her. Everyone thought that was going to be sort of permanent."
Draco followed them, withdrawing the Portkey with a handkerchief. "It's set to go whenever we want," he said. "We'd better Disillusion once we get there."
"I thought so." Malfoy beamed at her. "I tried a bunch of things and this disguise just ended up working the best."
He smelled like vanilla. How did he know what to smell like to smell so attractive? "Uh… I don't know," Harry said lamely.
The wall dissolved, and in its place stood a tall, darkly-hooded figure. Malfoy's breath caught beside him.
"That's right. A girl has to get her shopping done sometime. Seriously, Potter, I need groceries. That's last, though."
"My sort of thing?" Harry frowned, too. "You're meeting with me and someone from the Department of Mysteries… is it someone from one of those weird departments?"
Harry bundled himself into his own and closed his eyes. He was asleep almost instantly, a deep, sticky, confused sleep that swam over his brain for hours as his exhausted limbs sagged in relief.
"Whatever you want," Malfoy replied, also carefully. "I can put the glamour back on, if you'd rather. I'm not sure if it will stay, but I can try."
This came with a twist of smirk that deepened the sensation. Damn it, he was not going to blush under Malfoy's scrutiny. Harry cleared his throat. "Er, thanks," he said gruffly.
Harry sighed and took Malfoy's hand in a loose grip, wincing as Malfoy favoured him with a syrupy smile and laced their fingers together, leaning against his arm as the other couple got closer. "Is this what you wanted, Sugarpie?" Harry asked irritably, gritting his teeth.
Draco didn't look at him, but Harry was standing closer to him than a stranger should have been. He felt Harry stiffen as he perceived Draco's tension. He was as transparent as glass and far too perceptive. Draco moved to the end of the counter to wait for his drink, and Harry followed.
Malfoy regarded him for a moment, his casual air still rather forced, Harry thought. "What would you say?"
Potter shook his head. "Maybe we needed this much time for it to work. It's all going to be good now. Come on, let's go and pry our sons apart long enough to tell them."
"I think we make too many distinctions between the physical, the magical, and the emotional," Hermione said. "If working at St. Mungo's has taught me anything, it's that. It's not always that easy to separate."
Malfoy got up. They walked to the door together. Harry put his shoes on and turned to face Malfoy. Malfoy looked at his mouth, but all he said was, "I'm glad you came over."
That entire day was a little strange, but Malfoy was carefully his usual self, making no reference to the previous night. As he wasn't talking about it, Harry didn't bring it up, either. Considering how uncertain he still felt about it, he didn't know what he would even say when it came up, as it likely would eventually.
For a long minute, Malfoy was silent. Then he closed the fridge and crossed behind Harry to leave. "Then cut the mixed messages," he said tensely, from the doorway. It was quick and low and full of some sort of anger that Harry didn't understand at all, and before he could respond or ask what the hell Malfoy meant by that, he was gone.
"Would you please calm down? The kids will be home after dinner. It was just lunch." Harry wondered why he was defending it, but all he really wanted was for Ginny to stop harping at him. He got up and went to fish the Prophet out of the trash, shook it back open to the Quidditch page and did his best to ignore his glowering wife. He had sighed with relief at the sound of her retreating footsteps and put it from his mind, at least until now.
"That is your reputation," Malfoy said, a touch of smirk coming into his voice. "I never thought I would see the famous Harry Potter, Man-Who-Lived, Vanquisher of the Dark Lord, Head Auror, blah blah blah, jump because somebody shouted. Or that I, of all people, would be the one to save him from a potentially ugly demise."
"Oh. Uh, sure," Harry said. He got up and went upstairs. Malfoy followed at a safe distance, closing the bedroom door behind himself. They faced each other over the rumpled bedrolls strewn over the floor.
"Of course not." Harry smirked at him. "I was just taking in the… view." He touched it. He had touched it before but never deliberately, and it was different. It was hard and flushed and Harry knew then that he wanted to taste it. He hesitated very briefly, then got down on his knees.
He looked at the three of them: Potters senior and junior and Draco and stopped, face wary. "Dad, I didn't have anything to do with this," he began.
Malfoy looked a bit unsure of himself, returning the smile awkwardly and then closeting himself in the bathroom once Harry had shaved and taken himself out of the way.
They straightened and faced him at once, their respect giving him a touch of pride both in himself and them. "Marianne thought she saw something," one of the girls volunteered. Inez, third year, Draco thought.
Draco put the key in the deepest pocket of his trousers and turned again and saw what looked like a window into his own office, Potter's face inches from the portrait. He went to it. "Hi," he said.
Potter finally looked at him, his face mottled as the blood finally began to drain back to where it belonged. "I heard," he said. "I heard you got divorced, too."
Malfoy looked, too, though reluctantly. "I have to stir it once more," he said. "But then it can simmer. Come with me."
"'There's someone I have to see, be back later on'?" she quoted, sounding incredulous. "Who the hell could you have had to see in the middle of the night, Harry? How am I supposed to take that? Is this your version of telling me that you're leaving me, or what is it?"
"You didn't see him leave the portrait? Walk out of it or away from it?" Draco wanted to grab her by the shoulder and shake, but restrained himself.
He got his own hands on Malfoy, dragging him closer by one arse cheek, which tightened in a way that make his gut clench as he did so, to wrap his fist around Malfoy's cock again, and hadn't his palm memorised the feel of it already, hard against his skin and pulsing with need. Malfoy gasped, then grinned evilly back. "This is where the fun starts, Potter."
"Yes, in your Floo," Potter said. "Albus is still asleep, but she's going to tell me when he wakes up and I'll be able to talk to him then. I was going to go up and have a look in on him, though. I just want to take a shower first. I can go back to my place, or - "
"Why not, exactly?" Malfoy was leaning forward again, his proximity close enough that Harry could feel the heat of his face on his own. "Don't give me the work crap, Potter. We both know that this is a temporary assignment, and after this we go our separate ways. That particular line doesn't cut it."
Malfoy must have been close already, because his fists tightened and he allowed himself to thrust just once into Harry's throat before regaining control of himself. "Potter - I'm - " he panted, and that was all there was time for. Harry got the message and pulled back, leaving just the tip of Malfoy's cock in his mouth and sucked hard, rubbing his tongue against the flooding slit, and then his mouth was filled as Malfoy came, gasping. Harry swallowed the bitter fluid hungrily, reflecting that it wasn't all that bad at all. He waited, prodding out the last of it with his tongue, and when Malfoy grew too sensitive, his cock twitched and Harry let it go.
A movement near Albus caught his eye. Another child and his parent were approaching the painted horses, a rather well-dressed man helping a boy about Albus' age onto the one furthest from his son's. The father had his back to the swing set and his voice could just be distinguished, though not the words. The tone was sharply cautionary. The man backed away, surveying the child with hands on hips. He glanced at Albus, looked away, then looked again. Albus stared back at him, forgetting to rock. The man turned, looking around the play park.
"I told you I did." Harry moved past him, down the hall to the living room and looked around. "Have you got a DVD player?"
Harry exhaled shakily and nodded. He got his other arm around Malfoy's middle to unscrew the little tube behind Malfoy's back. He squeezed a bit onto his fingers and kissed Malfoy again, once, more for reassurance than anything else. He closed his hand around Malfoy's cock first, slicking the warm lube over it, and Malfoy moaned softly. He shifted his weight, spreading his legs a little. Harry moved his hand lower, cupping Malfoy's balls and probing with his longest finger. Finding the hole, he pressed at it in warning, distracting Malfoy by dragging his tongue over a firm nipple. The finger slipped inside easily enough, and Malfoy clutched his hair. "Okay?" Harry detached his mouth from Malfoy's nipple long enough to ask.
Lucius smiled and it was unpleasant. "Only he can stop it now. And what of his friends, his housemates? The would-be heroes of Gryffindor? The would-be magical theorists of Ravenclaw? No heroes among the Slytherins, but even the work-happy drones of Hufflepuff? Who among them wouldn't join young Potter in a heartbeat?"
Harry walked a full circle around both Dolohov and Malfoy, whose wand was now trained on the back of Dolohov's head. Finally he knew what he was going to do. "You are under arrest," he said, "for the murder of Ginevra Weasley Potter and sedition against the Ministry of Magic. I, Harry James Potter, have the right as Head Auror to suspend your right to a trial. You are hereby sentenced to spend the rest of your natural life in Azkaban. Your memories of your crimes will be removed, thus ensuring your silence. Case closed."
Harry found that he was, and said so. "There's a restaurant just inside the East gate that I want to show you," Malfoy said. "It's really nice, despite its name - The Casablanca - and it has real, sit-down meals and good service. I thought maybe you were getting tired of shwarma and falafel."
Harry flushed under Malfoy's scorn, but did his best to let the same expression form on his own face. "Is there more than one bed?"
"A pint of Guinness," the speaker said, sounding exhausted. He got another inaudible response and the server shuffled away, revealing Potter as he sagged against the wall behind himself.
"What about it?" Harry said. "We don't have to live together. People here are already starting to talk about leaving. I'd like to leave, personally. We can keep this place for headquarters and live somewhere else."
Harry, despite the unbelievable circumstances, could not help but snicker at this. "A monastery, Malfoy? I didn't think you were the religious type."
Why couldn't Malfoy have a file that looked like that? Harry shifted through the other nearly-complete reports and read another at random, though he knew them nearly by heart.
"Have to. You have no idea how snubbed people get when I don't show up for whatever charity ball they're throwing. Especially if I come without a date." He rolled his eyes.
His words had a strange effect on Harry. It was as though Malfoy had stripped through his entire exterior and cut to the quick. And it wasn't as though Harry had been out to become the world's nicest person or the whole world's best mate, which was evidently the impression the media had tried to create of him since the war had ended. But surely he owed Malfoy something, some measure of the standard civility which any person was expected to accord another. In a matter of seconds, he recalled all of his snubs to Malfoy since the time the Order had moved entirely into Grimmauld Place. It had been January of War Year VI, in fact, and now it was closing in on Christmas of War Year VII. Had he ever given Malfoy the time of day? Voiced a concern for his well-being in any respect whatsoever? Harry felt his face redden and knew for a fact that he had not. He was embarrassed by his own bad behaviour. "God, I'm sorry, Malfoy," he said, humbled by his own failure to even treat Malfoy like a fellow human being. Although he was pretty sure he knew why that was, but that was his own, private, semi-acknowledged problem.
"Are you sure?" Draco pulled back, coated two fingers in the lube he'd brought and left beside the sofa, and slid them slowly into Harry. Maybe it had just been too fast, the other times. Maybe Harry just needed to get used to the idea. Or perhaps it was that final bit of mental resistance to the idea that men should not be sexually submissive or some such thing. He enjoyed finger-play and had no issue with giving blow jobs, even rimming - but being fucked was not something he had particularly taken to.
The fire made the room warm, and Draco liked it that way. Harry frequently complained that it was too hot, but he was not complaining now. They had only moved in together six months prior, and the convenience of being able to shag wherever they wanted, as loudly as they wanted, was still something of a novelty. It was a rented house, true - buying a house together had seemed a little precipitous - but after going back and forth between two flats, one with particularly noise-sensitive neighbours, it seemed nothing short of perfection.
Harry coughed and put a hand to his hot face. "I'm - I'm feeling all right," he said. "I'm just going to use the bathroom. Talk to you later!" He pushed past Ron, not waiting for an answer and closeted himself in the bathroom.
"There's something else, too," Harry said. "We seem to have some sort of strange connection going on. Something magical, I mean."
"I know. I know that's probably why," Harry said. "I'm just upset. It always seems so real. And on top of that, I need to break up with Ginny and I feel like I don't know who I am or what I want any more, and I don't know what to do."
Harry Summoned his wand silently and cleaned both the wet area and himself, shifting away to pull his thoughts together. "Ron or Ginny?"
"You're not usually this quiet," Malfoy commented eventually, gazing off into the covered alleyways of the souq.
"Er - I wasn't worried," Harry said, and, feeling awkward, added, "I'm glad you're all right, then." He waited a beat. "And I don't hate you, either."
Malfoy stopped crying and pushed himself up onto one elbow, his back to Harry, and said, "I'm going to be sick."
"No - please don't go!" Draco found the "door open" button and held it down with one hand. "Just hear me out. Ten minutes, no more. Then if you're not convinced, you can go wherever you're going."
Harry put his quill down and hid a smile at the slight edge in Malfoy's tone, knowing something that he didn't. "I did. Thought it was about time I finished those."
Harry took in the pale expanse of Malfoy's back and tried not to think about it. "We all have our scars from the war," he said heavily, not willing to open the doors on his own. "I guess we all have our own ways of trying to live with them."
She carried the teapot over with a cup for Harry and sat down near him. "So," she said, fixing her eyes on him. "Is this about Ginny?"
"You daft git," Harry said, slightly exasperated. "No, she wasn't. Ron was. That was always Ron. Ginny was just… there. I don't know what that was. It just seemed like the obvious thing, plus I knew her so well and stuff. What's that word?"
He was being turned around on the stool and then he caught a glimpse of Malfoy's face, too serious like always, a flash of grey eyes full of intense purpose and then Malfoy's mouth was on his, open and biting at his, soft yet demanding, and Harry did not resist it. His hands were on Malfoy's rib cage, pulling him down, closer. He had never kissed a man before, and it was nothing and everything like kissing a woman had been, even given that there had only ever been two of those. Malfoy kissed exactly the way he did everything else: it was entirely on his terms, but it was as though he was instructing Harry to take the lead, pushing it on him. Their tongues touched and Harry felt a bolt of something hotter than firewhiskey go through him. He was on his feet, being pressed into the edge of the counter by Malfoy's pushy hips, fingers scrabbling at the buttons on Harry's shirt. Something electric clicked in Harry's head then and he knew then that he wanted this more than anything.
"Yes," Draco said soberly. "But we teach it by being the better people, Scorpius. That is the only way there is to show the world what the Malfoy line is now."
Harry stopped and looked back, not comprehending for a moment. Then he got it, his brow furrowing for a second. "Oh," he said. "Right." He bit his lip. "I'll see you back at home, then?"
Musing over this, he turned the corner at the end and discovered Malfoy turning a small gold cauldron over in his hands. He stopped. Malfoy hadn't seen him yet, but -
Hermione gave him an interesting look, opened and then closed her mouth, apparently changing her mind. "Yes," she said instead. "That's probably true. I mean, this is important stuff."
Draco felt his face turn to stone, his mind numbing in outraged denial. Potter. No. Fucking. Way. Trying to speak over his fury, mustering all the cold politeness he could, he asked, "What about Potter?"
Malfoy waited until they were seated to turn to Harry. "I got it," he said, smug and sounding rather pleased with himself. He was grinning evilly, looking much younger than he was. This could have been a prank they were playing, albeit a prank that relied a little too close to dark magic for Harry's liking. A Slytherin prank, then.
Draco took a deep breath without realising it and went to find his son and ex-wife. The performance was about to begin.
He pointed and Harry saw the glass on the floor where he had left it. It seemed pointless to say thank you twice, so he went and drank in silence.
Ginny was home. The flat was silent, the television off for a change. Ginny was sitting on the edge of the sofa, twisting the edge of the blanket in her fingers. Harry walked in, saw her, and stopped. She lifted her face, saw him, and said nothing. Accusation was written all over her face, plain as day. Harry cleared his throat. "Hi," he said quietly.
"If I can find a way, you will allow me to send you into the portraits' universe, on my best promise that I will do everything in my power to return you to your normal life and state after the Death Eaters are gone?" Potter confirmed, his eyes boring into Draco's again.
Potter grinned and obediently drained the bottle. "Good stuff," he said appraisingly. "My favourite champagne."
He ground himself into Malfoy's body, his cock jutting into Malfoy's and it felt so good, so right, even through two sets of robes and trousers. It didn't matter that anyone could come by, that anyone could see - he needed this, needed it so badly he might have died if someone had come and forced him to get off Malfoy. Malfoy let go of his arms and dug all ten fingers into Harry's arse. They were rutting together like animals, not two grown men - well, twenty-nine was still borderline, in Harry's opinion, but still - and Harry was seconds away from coming in his pants like a fourteen-year-old. A strangled sound told him that Malfoy had just done exactly that, the pressure between them easing into a warm pool of release. Harry was almost there, almost - Malfoy forced his hand under Harry's robes and down his trousers, jerking frantically at his cock, and it was exactly what Harry wanted, feeling so good that he could - Harry felt himself shooting into those long, slim fingers, panting into Malfoy's flushed face.
Harry found himself distracted. He was interested. The rumble of the car's motor caused the seat to vibrate very gently, and after five hours, it was causing interesting reactions. He'd always felt that way about long distance driving, including on the Hogwarts Express, though he'd never said a word about it. Draco's hand felt nice, and normally he would have been pleased to have Draco's hand where it was headed, the fact that he was driving aside. However, there was another urge taking priority. He squirmed again. "Don't," he said.
Lupin regarded him with the same patience he usually employed, but he looked tired. Tired, Harry realised, of not only keeping the tense household headquarters running, but also of keeping most of the individuals in it running. Lupin said nothing, but went to the desk, peering at the woefully short stack of completed reports. "You still haven't done Malfoy's," Lupin commented, his tone carefully neutral.
Both Disillusionments faded. Potter let go quickly enough, but not so quickly that Draco hadn't had time to register Potter's closeness, his heat, his magic sparking in his veins with excitement, his hips colliding with Draco's in a way that was anything but painful. It was as exhilarating as the victory, little though Draco cared to admit it to himself. His body memorised the feel of it instantly and he knew that he was aroused by it. He let go awkwardly and Potter looked apologetic.
Malfoy glared fiercely back. "You are the most hopeless loser I have ever known," he said, sneering.
"Good night," Malfoy said. He closed the door after Harry and Harry, looking back, saw the light in the hall turn out a few moments later. The sight caused a pang of agony. He wished he were still inside, with Malfoy. Nonsense, he told himself sternly. He had to go home to the kids. It had to be past eight by now; to stay away any longer would require explanations that he didn't have or wasn't ready to give.
Aware that he was still holding the paper too close, that the story should be far less interesting (but then, who wouldn't be curious about Potter's scandal? It was only natural), Draco scanned the article, noting the author's jubilant tone almost more than the text itself. The facts were slipped in between fragments of speculation and faux-shock, carelessly dropped: the names of Potter's three small children, the length of his employment with the Auror Department, the duration of his marriage to the youngest Weasley, who was credited with speculation about divorce settlements. Potter's Gringotts vault was mentioned, naturally, with the usual estimates (which varied wildly, particularly when it was Skeeter writing) as to amounts and specifics of content.
He looked up over the parchment in time to see Malfoy's face drain of colour. "You don't know anything?" he asked, sounding hollow.
Harry pushed his glasses up his nose and didn't quite look at her. "I can't really talk about it," he said, looking down at his notes on the parchment. "You're right, though, something's definitely not right here."
Malfoy glared at him. "Well, you obviously wanted some time away from me. Small doses, remember? So I gave you some space."
Tonks was suddenly there, talking to people all around him. "A terrible accident," she kept saying, all the while patting Harry on the arm. When she could get away from the questions and interjections, she turned to Harry and said in a low voice, "You should leave."
Potter interrupted him before he was able to think of a decent exit line, mid-sip. "No - I didn't mean now, Malfoy. I just meant in general." He lowered the bottle and looked at Draco. "Come on. Sit down. It's kind of nice having the company."
Malfoy made a sound that might have been a chuckle; it was hard to tell without seeing his face. "Come on, let's move." He turned and went to the entrance of the alley, and Harry noticed that as soon as he was in sunlight, the outline faded considerably. He would have no trouble spotting it in a crowd, however, unless Malfoy suddenly made a getaway. He followed him into the Leaky, slipping between people and was hurrying down Diagon Alley with Malfoy across the way. When they reached Gringotts, Malfoy came over and took Harry by the wrist. "Shh," he said warningly. "Remember, we are observing. That's all. This is what I do for a living. I'm not just a spy, I spy here. If you blow my cover, you will destroy everything I've built up in the last… few years. So do me a favour and hold off on any Gryffindor thoughtless exclamations or uncalled-for actions, all right?"
Malfoy came to his rescue. "I couldn't risk having a cock flopping about in a dress like this," he drawled. "No one wants to see that bulge on a girl, now do they?"
He didn't know whether he had turned over or if Malfoy had wrestled him around, but suddenly he was on top of Malfoy and two pairs of hands were pushing the shorts down. Harry couldn't even be bothered to get his all the way out of the way - his cock was poking through the front pocket, thick and hard and he felt Malfoy's against his palm before he ever saw it. It felt strangely satisfying to hold, not that hold was the word for the frantic rubbing. He was half thrusting himself into Malfoy's hand and half being jerked off by him, his own fist flying along Malfoy's cock. Malfoy was panting beneath him, eyes boring into Harry's, burning, and Harry thought that the look alone would force him to come. He wasn't fighting it now. He was fighting for it, every movement an inevitable, unpreventable, grasping demand for it, and Malfoy was going to give it to him. Had to, at this point. It was going to happen. It was upon him. It was -
It was a lie, but it seemed to strike a nerve. Malfoy's face reddened with anger. Without a word, he turned and went into the bathroom, closing the door with a bang.
"Calm down," Potter said, his eyebrows lifting. "I just wanted to tell you, in my own time, but I see we're not going to do that, that I was glad yesterday happened. I don't know what you're thinking about it, but I didn't want things to be strange after. I know I was drunk, and maybe I wasn't thinking clearly, but I thought about it today and I'm glad it happened. I'd like to see you again, if you'd be up for it."
"I hate repeating myself, Potter. Yes. And get this: the money, at least this deposit, has been moved to a non-magical bank."
Malfoy looked at him. "Here you are," he said. He was carrying the bottle of firewhisky and two tumblers. He came over and sat down on a bedroll, placing one glass in front of Harry and the other in front of himself, the bottle between them.
Left in the corridor, Harry debated about what to do with himself. He couldn't go home yet, and little as he felt like working, he was expected to put in an appearance at some point, anyway. He went upstairs and buried himself in pointless paperwork and tried not to think about Malfoy.
Harry was taken aback. He felt rather chagrined. "Sorry," he muttered. "Let's just get this over as quickly as possible, and then I won't have to ask you any more questions that neither of us wants to talk about."
"The same as the Order's always had," Malfoy said. "Nothing. We'd have to fend for ourselves. Work day jobs to pay the bills."
He blinked in surprise; they were in the foyer of a wholly unfamiliar flat. Reeling from the Apparition and breathing hard from their escape, he was still trying to get his bearings when Malfoy gave him an unreadable look, let go his wrist and pulled off the jacket of his suit and hung it in the closet. He gave Harry a scrutinising look and held out a hand.
Harry made himself breathe. "No one thing, no. I remember admitting to myself now and then that I thought someone was attractive, but I would always rationalise it away. You know, tell myself that I was just noticing that he was fit and that I wanted my own arms or whatever to look like that. There was a day when I was in Muggle London for awhile and it was late and I saw two blokes kissing outside a pub. I guess I was in a queer area or something. I was on a field assignment and didn't really have time to think about it, but I kept thinking back to it. Maybe that was when I really knew, but I still never really did admit it to myself."
Potter looked surprised. "I love it," he said. "Ginny hates it, so we never went much. But I - " He stopped, watching Draco. "Why do you ask?"
"Of course," Harry said, "except I still seem to find myself at a loss." He shifted his gaze to Malfoy, who was balancing a cup of tea in a saucer on one knee and gazing with apparent indifference back at him. "You're an Unspeakable?"
Malfoy smiled sardonically and turned toward his small stack of clothing. "I need to buy more clothes. The problem isn't you. I don't know how slowly I can make myself go, not you."
The irony of hearing this from someone who had just come from being pissed on was too great to even comment on. "You're so modest, too."
Malfoy heaved a sigh. "Is this really necessary, Potter? You've done your good deed. Now leave me alone."
Harry ignored the smile, not sure what to make of the message. Why hadn't Malfoy been more specific? How was he meant to interpret that? "Oh," he said. "Okay. Uh, thanks."
The other cloaked figure sneered at him and produced his own wand, raising it to the goblin's neck. "Not a word, like he said," he said, the voice light and rather soft. Beside Harry, Malfoy twitched. Recognition? Now was not the time to ask.
"Sorry," Harry said, meaning it this time and offering a sheepish smile. "It's been a long day. I could use a drink, too."
December had started at some point; Draco hadn't noticed. He did notice the holly that dropped into his face from above when something had jarred it, presumably when he'd closed the office door. He batted the spiky leaves away from his face and irritably stalked down the moving staircase. Potter had got him jumpy about this. Never before had he paid so much attention to the portraits in the castle; every movement out of the corner of his eye had him turning in suspicion. The irony had not missed him: he, the sole person responsible for having let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts, oh, twenty-six years earlier, was now solely responsible for ensuring the safety of the castle against the same now. Well, that was also Potter's responsibility, but Potter was not Headmaster. He was. Two days had passed since Potter had divulged what he was looking for, and he hadn't said a word since. Potter hadn't said, but it seemed to Draco that he was quite sure that the Death Eaters would begin turning up in the portraits at any moment. Every hour that passed seem to increase his air of expectation and apprehension, and Draco's private dread.
"You're not that quiet, Malfoy," Moody said, with a gruff chuckle. "In fact, you can be quite vocal, especially when provoked. No, there's turmoil. Unresolved issues. We have no doubt of this. In fact, we've even made a list of your trigger points. Listen."
"It was a risky situation and a, well, creepy atmosphere," Malfoy said, offering him an out. "I was feeling a little edgy myself." He took another drink of whiskey and tilted his head to one side, studying Harry. "Funny, though, Potter. I never would have thought there was anything that could scare you."
Draco got himself out of the conference room and the Ministry and Apparated back to the safe confines of his flat, the invitation burning his fingertips.
He was as casual as though they did this every Sunday. Harry fell into step beside him. "It is," he said. "I had forgotten how much I like getting out in the rain when it's not a mad dash between work and home, or something I have to look presentable for."
He cast a Shield just in time to send Potter's hex back at himself, where it melted in the air before touching him. "Malfoy," Potter said through clenched teeth, "I am going to give you five seconds to get out of my suite. Five, four, three - "
"Of all the luck!" Ginny exclaimed. Ron, Harry noted, looked slightly less enthusiastic about this, but was clearly pleased enough to be partnered with Hermione. Just then, his own scroll arrived, as did Malfoy's.
His mouth left the vicinity of Harry's neck and skipped directly down past the t-shirt to Harry's bare cock. Harry only had a second to register what was coming next, but he still jerked with pleasant shock when Malfoy's hot mouth enveloped him, half his cock swallowed on the first go. He gasped and clutched at Malfoy's hair. It was hard and fast and Malfoy's mouth was far too strong; it was like he was sucking Harry's core out through his cock and it felt far too good. The truth was that Harry had never had a blow job before, never had a mouth on his cock before at all, in fact, which was none of Malfoy's business at all. He hadn't answered the question about Bill; somehow, he had a feeling that telling Malfoy that Bill hadn't returned the favour, thanks to the twins' untimely interruption would only provide him with more ammunition. But the sensation was overwhelming, and if he wasn't careful, he was going to come perhaps thirty seconds into it, and he wanted it to last much, much longer than that. He bit into his bottom lip hard and made himself push at Malfoy's head. "Stop!" he gasped.
Harry nodded gratefully and followed Malfoy inside. "It's really early. Or really late. I'm sorry," he said.
Malfoy shrugged, still smiling. "It's not all that special. I just add a personalised aura detecting charm, so that I'm only slightly visible to you, and you're only slightly visible to me. Well, your aura, that is."
"No!" Malfoy wrenched the arm away, and his face was furious, his eyes wet. "That's the exact opposite of what I want. But I don't know if I - "
Across the way, Harry met Draco's eyes. Neither of them said anything. "Just wait and see," Draco said carefully. "You never know what could happen. Just do your best. Try to get to know some people, and respect your professors."
Harry mentally resolved to kill Lupin on sight at their next encounter and glanced at the clock to see if he could possibly justify going to find Malfoy yet.
"No, I'm sure you wouldn't," Ginny snapped. "What, then? You only just figured it out now? I have a hard time believing that, Harry."
Twitterbog let loose a stream of Latin that Harry didn't quite catch, and scrolls zoomed neatly all over the room, elegantly finding their recipients with surprisingly little chaos or jostling in the air.
"Not Dumbledore," Potter said. "There are some who seem to have gone missing. Have you ever heard of a portrait finding the ability to leave its frame?"
"No, that doesn't fit," Hermione said positively. "Lots of people have had their lives saved by other people, especially during the war. We'd have heard if there was something like that."
"It's not something to be ashamed of," Hermione said firmly. "If this is what you really want, then maybe you should think of yourself first, for once."
Malfoy's hands were on him, exploring his back, his belly, his arse. Harry grabbed for Malfoy's shirt, unbuttoning it in record speed. He got his mouth onto Malfoy's neck and collarbone, pressing his tongue against Malfoy's pulse point, tasting his skin. Malfoy undid his cuffs behind Harry's back and let the shirt fall to the floor. He went for Harry's t-shirt, hauling it over his head. His thumbs pressed into Harry's nipples, which were hard, and the touch made Harry shudder appreciatively. Malfoy didn't smile at this, but his eyes blazed in a way that Harry had never seen them do before. He put a hand on the back of Malfoy's neck and kissed him again, not holding back at all. Malfoy made a small sound and clenched his arms around Harry's back. Harry was harder than ever, and Malfoy was so close that Harry barely had to move to feel how hard he was, feel the friction collecting between them. Malfoy released his mouth and separated himself a little, bending to place his mouth on Harry's left nipple. His tongue stroked over it, playing with it, and Harry thought that every hair on his body was standing on end. His fingers were gripping Malfoy's hair and shoulder and his cock was doing its best to burst the seam of his jeans.
Malfoy's laughter was wicked. Before he could say anything, though, someone upstairs got up, creaked across the floor and went to the bathroom. They waited, listening. The water ran, first in the pipes, then into the sink. The door opened, and footsteps padded back into the bedroom, leaving the door ajar. "Fuck," Malfoy said softly. "Well. You'll just have to try not to scream when you come, Potter."
"Really," Harry said, considering this. "So whoever moved it has to be familiar enough with the Muggle world to know about their bank accounts and such. Although that wouldn't be hard to learn. What bank?"
Harry did as he was told. It had grown warm in his hands, but it still burned on the way down, smoke rising from the empty glass when he set it down.
Tonks paused. "You won't use this against him if I tell you, will you?" She glanced at him, though not quite sure where to look. "Sorry. That was uncalled for. You're not like that."
Susan shot him a glare, and Harry remembered then that she had carried a bit of a torch for Malfoy all those years ago. "No! It's something else altogether. I'm really not at liberty to discuss it. It's been a bit of a headache lately, though, so I'm a little stressed out. We've lost two potions experts in the past two weeks, and they aren't exactly common."
Harry sighed deeply. Malfoy's fingers felt good, and so did his proximity, close enough that Harry could feel his body heat thrumming into his back. He wanted to lean back into it. He could ignore the temptation for now, but the silence between them was far too loaded.
It was a very good way. Potter looked around and asked where the bedroom was. Draco pointed it out with a jerk of his chin as his mouth was full of Potter's fingers at the moment, and then they were stumbling there. His lube was in Potter's hand before they got to the doorway and then he was being gently pushed down onto the bed. Potter was climbing onto him, legs warring with Draco's in their mutual need to get their cocks touching again, to get closer still. The lube was between their hands, fingers touching and fumbling together with the cap. Potter spilled a generous amount of it into his palm, and Draco had a hazy moment of thinking that generous was the perfect word for Potter right now. Every stroke, every press of his mouth, even the way he kissed was like a small, individually wrapped gift from Potter and while it might have bothered his pride normally, at the moment Draco wanted nothing so much as to open all of them at once. He could take this from Potter. He could accept this generosity. He gasped as Potter's fingers entered him, tongue flattening against his right nipple at the same time. Potter's tongue worked down his torso, swiped over a ball and then sucked Draco's cock halfway down his throat. Draco was moaning without shame, without trying to prevent himself. He was normally very reserved in sex, all about maintaining façade, but Potter wasn't fooled by façade, and it felt far too good to just let go and revel in it for once. His hips tried to buck upward, craving still more depth in Potter's wonderfully hot mouth, but Potter held him in place, mouth sliding over Draco, tongue pressing. Potter still had fingers in his arse and they were moving in and out in time with his mouth. For a man who had spent roughly twenty years married to a woman, he sure knew how to give a blow job, Draco thought, though the thought was barely coherent in the blinding wave of pleasure swelling, about to overtake him. His back arched, the pleasure spiking through him so roughly that he couldn't breathe, his cry catching in his throat. It was the only warning his could give before he was coming and coming down Potter's throat, nearing losing consciousness as white bloomed like fire behind his eyes. Then breath rushed back and the cry tore from his throat, fingers clenched in Potter's hair, Potter's nose buried in the blond curls at the base of his cock.
