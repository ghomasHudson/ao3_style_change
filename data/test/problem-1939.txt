“I believe that as an individual, her abilities and lengths to achieve her means don’t span as far as they would have than if she were backed by someone - or something.”
As the quill scraped over the paper, the same seemed to happen to his hand as the letters, one by one, were cut into his skin before his eyes. His hand seared with pain but within a moment, the wounds on his hand healed over as if nothing were ever there. He glanced at the words on the parchment, their glossy sheen reflecting off the light coming from the window next to him. It took a moment before he realised that Umbridge really did expect him to supply his own ink, not with saliva but with his own blood.
"Champions! Your time starts in three…two…one!"
“That’s brilliant.” Harry smiled. “You’ll be great.”
just cut it.”
Harry snorted, reaching over and taking a sip of some Pumpkin juice. "Good luck with that." He said. "Hermione would've found a way to do the Vow without the threat of instant death."
Draco threw a hand over his heart, "Is that how you thank your
"Fine. I guess it's time to tell them." Harry said defeatedly.
. It was always that moment, when Cedric's face went slack and his eyes looked so terribly non-living that Harry questioned if he'd ever been alive at all.
Harry's brain seemed to short circuit, and it took all of Draco's willpower to keep a straight face.
Harry couldn’t help the scowl that crossed his face, irritation rearing its head inside of him. The emotion was almost a complete physical sensation to him now, as his stomach churned and his head began to feel light with anger. Why did people care so much about it? Why couldn’t they just leave him alone?
Umbridge’s eyes left him to stare down at the desk. Harry could tell she was wracking her brain for the memory of having told him about Lucius, but he knew she wouldn’t find any.
After a couple of seconds of prodding Draco's arm and his wand, his father murmured, "Cast something."
"Oh, Draco, what did you two
"You…know the sound of my footsteps?"
He dug his hands in to the dirt and squeezed. It felt familiar in a way he didn't know how. He used it to ground himself and the bubbling of anxiety inside him. The sky was a terrible overcast, and he ached for it to be sunny again.
Harry sputtered for a moment. "What?"
not to look at him.
"Please don't tell anyone what I said…about my Mother and Father I mean." Malfoy said.
Umbridge said nothing and he continued, “I mean, think of it this way, Professor. It would be truly worrying if there were certain individuals within the Ministry, say for example like Lucius Malfoy, that heard the so-called lies I’d been spreading around - no, that Albus Dumbledore
"Thank you. For what you said today." Harry said, fiddling with a loose string on the blanket covering his lap, "I'm glad you're…making amends, and stuff now. I know your families have had some animosity for a long time."
"You sure?" Draco sputtered. The fabric felt cool and silky, as if letting water run through his hands. "But it was your fathers." He said, ready for Harry to realise and rip back from him.
Harry's eyes widened, "Oh shit! I completely forgot. That's so…"
“But why?” Neville gasped.
Both Remus and Sirius smiled sadly, and it made Harry want to look away. His friends around him watched on with looks in their eyes that just made him angry, as if he were some sort of injured animal.
“How dare you openly say that against a-” Harry’s voice was getting louder, Merlin. Ronald and Hermione didn’t even look calm enough to reel him in.
in this house-"
“I’m assuming you don’t want any -?” McGonagall started drawing away the tartan.
Harry sighed loudly, going to take the quill and beginning to write on the parchment once again.
"Nothing we can do." Remus admitted tiredly. "Draco has his meetings, then we have the general ones for all members of the Order. You lot clean the house, then you'll get your letters soon-"
"I- what? They won't care?" Draco spluttered. Harry only nodded again, nonplussed, and Draco continued to stumble over his words. "So-if they ask what you did the whole year? What do they think you've been doing for nine months?"
"But you don't even know if it will work. It's just a theory, nothing's guaranteed-"
Then Draco heard it. Screams coming from outside. The crowds were rumbling with screams and shouts.
"Oh-" A shiny object, green and silver, fell out of Draco's envelope as well. "Me too." He said, pleased.
"And what did he say?" Draco gritted out.
Speaking of said company, the tosser was trudging across the grass after Harry, lifting his robes up at the hems. Harry whipped off his robes, grateful as the cool winter chill hit him. Heaving a deep sigh of contentment, he tossed his robes to the side and plopped on the ground. He closed his eyes for a few moments, waiting for Malfoy to catch up.
Malfoy scoffed and Harry tried to reassure Hermione poorly with nothing but his eyes. Hermione, however, whom although looked very pretty that night, seemed close to beating both him and Malfoy with her purse. The angry glint in her eyes as she stared at Malfoy was emboldened by the shimmery stuff she had put on her face.
"Exactly! They just don't understand that. It's easy for them to tell me what to do, but they never think about what it'd actually be like for
Draco raised an eyebrow suspiciously, “And how do you plan to do that?”
", and felt the buzz that it'd worked all throughout his arm. He remembered the adrenalin rush in his veins from seeing the Hungarian Horntail so close, and the way his mind narrowed in to the spell so acutely because he absolutely
." Ron spat. "I was able to tolerate you and Harry being friends because it wasn't my problem, but now you're here, and you want to think you can be good, but you were
Draco shifted in his seat. "Your point?"
"Draco, darling." Mrs. Weasley came up behind him and started shoveling copious amounts of food on to his plate. "Have as much as you want, dear. You're looking right peaky."
Draco stood up challengingly and Harry mirrored him, his wand in his hand before he knew it. His eyes flicked to Draco's hands which were still wandless, but his face told Harry that he wasn't making an empty threat. A shiver went down Harry's spine at the pure ice he saw in Draco's grey eyes, and it made his stomach drop uncomfortably.
right, that's for sure." Sirius snorted in to his hand.
"Was not." Harry snapped, taking back his hand and rubbing it with the other. "Was you."
Harry paused, not knowing how to respond. "I didn't, I suppose."
There was a cough behind him, and he turned to see his friend, Blaise.
"What will? What do I need to say, or do?" Draco shot back, fists clenched in his lap.
His father gestured to the two chairs facing each other where they often sat at as his father taught him some boring theory or the other. "Come sit."
Draco looked at him in disbelief. "What is it to you?"
. I don't want thing to bloody change! I don't want a Dark Lord, or a war over something as trivial as Blood Purity for the sake of murder!"
After what felt like years, the meal was over and students were being taken to the Hogwarts Express. Ron and his other dorm mates had helped Harry pack his things before he returned to their dormitory, and he smiled gratefully at all of them. It helped that he didn't really have many belongings to begin with, having only acquired a few more chocolate frogs and the miniature Hungarian Horntail from the tournament over the course of the year. It blew a billow of angry flames when he picked it up off his bedside table, finally settling when he pet it on the head with a huff of smoke out of it's nostrils. Harry almost smiled at it when it did, then put it in to his trunk at the very bottom and hoped nothing crushed it. He wasn't quite sure if it was really alive or not.
“I find I quite agree with you.” she said, propping her chin up on a hand and leaning on her desk. Her tone was less sickly and fake now and more serious. Cautious, even. “These ideas...of yours…” she trailed off, waving a hand through the air in circles.
Draco uncrossed his arms, looking down to inspect at the nails of one of his hands. In his peripheral vision, he saw Bill's hand clamp over his mouth. The room was silent still, except for the
“Why are you asking about what I meant? About what I said?”
“No, I’m here for tea.” Draco rubbed his arms up and down to create some friction. The Owlery tower always had a strong draft, so despite the fluid sunlight flowing in there was still a chill that caught up with him even if he was wearing a wooly sweater. He had no idea how Harry was walking around with a short sleeved t-shirt. “You sending something?”
"The door?" Ron reminded him, as it was still left wide open to the hallway.
Draco sighed and picked up his books again, beginning to scratch over his parchment in dark green ink.
"My stake, dear Blaise? I do all this now, and I get put on the right side of history! The Malfoy name,
Draco shook his head at the thought. "Well, regardless, you better not make it any more difficult than it has to be for me, Harry. I'm dead serious on that." Draco warned him.
"But you have the Mark, do you not." Draco lowered his voice to a dangerous pitch just above a whisper. "You fought for him in the first war."
"Is there a problem, boys?" Snape asked scathingly. Malfoy scoffed and pushed past Harry and out the class with his bag hastily thrown over his shoulder. Harry quickly moved to pack his things up, seeing the class was now empty and rushed out the room. Cursing Malfoy the whole way, he just made it to charms and sat down with a huff. His mood was suddenly even more sour, and he pointedly ignored Ron and Hermione's nudges of concern, waving them off with curt replies.
“I’m serious, Ron. They’ll only get worried, and after what happened at Grimmauld Place, Hermione would surely go to Dumbledore. Just do it for me, okay?”
Draco crossed his arms over his chest, glaring at Harry. "I like you better when you've had more sleep."
"You want to put that to test? I can tell him to say hello during the Task tomorrow!" Malfoy yelled. At the mention of the task, Harry felt his face crumple in to his hands. He tried to push down the broiling emotions that steeped all the way to his gut, but for some reason his mind didn't allow such things by the Lake. It would have been easier if he was in the Great Hall, around other people, or while talking to Ron and Hermione when it was so easy to push down his feelings for them. Now, he felt awfully bare and it made him draw up his knees and bow his head between them and his chest. The small ensconced space was dark, but it felt safe. There was silence for a long time after that. Neither boy said anything.
. And
"Don't lose your temper. Just stick to the facts." Sirius added, and Remus beside his nodded agreeingly.
, this year. I’m not just going to let you get into trouble, especially for my sake. That wasn’t what we discussed back at Grimmauld.”
The room lulled from the frenzied pre-weekend buzz to a more relaxed atmosphere as most of the younger years headed to bed. The three of them sank into their chairs languidly until Harry had to jostle Ron and Hermione awake to force them back to their dorms for the night.
"And being mean to your friends. Calling them names-"
"It's fine, Harry. You can tell us at the end." Hermione said. "I eventually made the connection that something was going on and you two were involved. It was all circumstantial, of course." And Harry and Ron shared a look that Hermione glared at the two of them for and continued.
"You'll be back." Draco said slowly, getting up as well and trying his best to fold the Cloak as best one folding invisible material could.
"Right. You know all that then. Well…" He braced himself, fiddling with a loose thread on the edge of his shirt that Draco itched to fix. "Sirius was framed by Peter Pettigrew and never actually sold out my parents. He was in Azkaban unlawfully for twelve years and escaped before Third Year to get his revenge on Pettigrew, not me." The boy said so quickly Draco would have thought he'd imagined it.
"It just helps me think." Malfoy added.
in Second Year that was opening the Chamber of Secrets. Can you imagine?" He exclaimed, throwing his hands up in the air. "I wonder what other think about me! I could use this, Blaise! Do you think if I start hissing at snakes the other Slytherins will start bowing to me? Think of the threats I could make!"
"Jealous?" Harry asked, surprised.
, Blaise. I don't want anyone killed from my beliefs." Draco stared down at his tightened fists on his lap. "As much as I hated it, he made a lot of sense. And he made me realise that thing are a lot bigger than calling people mudbloods and being an arse about what I thought."
"Here where?" He asked, trying his best to keep his voice level so as to not break the spell they were in. He needed to know what Malfoy was thinking. Was it just him, or did he feel it too? The moment of crushing realisation of something. He prayed to anything that would listen, prayed that Malfoy would give him any indication of what he knew, what he was thinking. Harry felt like Malfoy knew something, but he didn't know what.
"Sorry." He said, but he looked more amused than actually apologetic. Imbecile.
“That’s what I said, though! Naomi!” Draco hissed, making sure not to be too loud as people around them began to stare at Blaise, starting to lose it. Draco’s face grew hot, and he crossed his arms with a huff.
Was the first thing he thought, unfortunately, and as much as he hated it he knew it was his best bet in hopefully making it make sense. Why had Barty Crouch been in Snape's office? Harry would have thought he had hallucinated it from seeing Snape after hours if Moody hadn't taken his map.
"It's basically this map that let's me see everyone at Hogwarts and where they are - I'll show you later when I get it back. But for some reason that night, I saw the name Barty Crouch on the map down in Snape's office. It shouldn't have been possible. Why would he be here?"
“It is not about right or wrong or truth or non-truth.” McGonagall said sternly. “It is about keeping yourself in control!”
Draco glared at Harry as the boy smirked at him, before it disappeared when Mrs. Weasley started spooning food on to his own plate. It was Draco's turn to smirk then, watching Harry's weak protests against the woman.
His man, Lancaster, was in charge of the first part: Organisation.
"Now," His father said, "Imagine we are dueling." He stepped to the left of Draco farther away from his wand arm. "I am about to cast. React."
“Lancaster...something Lancaster.”
"Potter, are you sure you're not sick? You're talking nonsense-"
"Fidelius." Harry repeated, clearly not knowing what it was.
"I just wanted to talk." Granger said, crossing her arms over her chest. The tap of her foot on the floor radiated insistence, so Draco conceded.
, we'll have you know-" but Harry stopped him with a hand on his arm,
"Yes, and a prick. Anything else?"
"So then I observed." She continued, "Its suspicious to say the least that he's become so…mild all of a sudden. Namely towards you. He's made it his mission to spite you since the first day you both met. That's why I was surprised that you of all people seemed…unaffected at his sudden change in behaviour."
"Oh, I wouldn't say close, Professor," Malfoy said looping his arm through Harry's, "This is merely a political alliance. Inter-House Unity and the sort." Harry
"Blaise." Draco said in an even tone that didn't hide the underlying anger behind them, "If there is one thing I know about Harry Potter now, it's that he is
"Yeah. Guess so."
Potter nudged him back in to reality. He shook himself a little, and they walked out of the Great Hall together in silence.
"Is that all?" Harry asked urgently.
"Off you go, lad." She prompted sweetly, and with another attempt at a smile he climbed up the stairs feeling her gaze on his back. He didn't know what it was he did, but the woman had a intense focus on him he didn't understand.
"She was adamant that none of it was fake. Hell, don't tell Ron I told you, but even
"Potter." He said softly, tapping him on the back slightly. Harry drew back immediately, thrown back in to reality like a cold splash of water.
“Like most people, I like to think about the task at hand. Not...twice at once - I don’t bloody know. It’s just weird, you prat.” Harry shot back, vaguely aware of his stomach and the many openings on his reclining body that Draco could attack if he willed. “And if this Weatherby fellow’s one of them, then wouldn’t Umbridge just smell him out?”
agenda is. Either we choose one or the other, Draco. We can’t do both.”
"Tch." Hermione tutted at him, and Harry drew another chair to sit around the coffee table with them.
Sirius paused, then thought for a moment. "No, but now that you mention it, why those few people? We all know about you."
"Worried?" Harry suggested. Draco looked at him, the darkness outlining the slight glint in the boy's round glasses.
"Shut up." Draco said quickly, sliding past him. "Now come on. I need to find Pansy to do my rounds."
Draco rubbed his face, not wanting to look up out of pure embarrassment.
"-on our arses, so if you feel bad about something, you
"Merlin, you're depressing." Draco muttered.
"What? When did you say that?" Harry ran his fingers through his hair self-consciously.
"Harry." Lupin greeted, reaching out to ruffle his hair affectionately when he'd run up to them. "How are you, boy? You've grown so much!" Though still quite young, Lupin looked tired and rather ill; he had more grey hair than when Harry had said good-bye to him, and his robes were more patched and shabbier than ever. Nevertheless, he was smiling broadly at Harry, who tried to smile back through his shock.
"What happened?" Harry asked, ignoring him.
Draco nodded without hesitating, staring head-on in to the man's eyes to convey his seriousness. It was hard, though, because there was something difficult to look at with the way the man's eyes crinkled with knowledge and ghosts of things he had probably picked up in Azkaban. Twelve years were bound to have their effect on a person. Holding back a shiver, Draco held his same coloured gaze for just a moment longer before a small voice croaked out.
“Fuck Malfoy.” Harry growled. “My scar’s the one that’s connected to
“Could it have something to do with that thing that Remus and Sirius talked about, then? The weapon?”
Draco felt himself frown. “Aren’t you going to tell me what I need to pay you back with?”
"Okay?" He asked after the glass was empty, taking it from Harry's hands and setting it aside. Harry nodded slightly, and Draco patted him on the back. "Good. You need the energy. Something to eat?" He asked hopefully, knowing Harry could be a bit fussy about food.
What felt like moments after his strange dream ended did he startle awake. His eyes popped open to the familiar green water outside his windows. Knowing that looking out any of the windows in the Slytherin dorms gave no indication of the time of day, he turned over to his watch and saw that it was too outrageously early to be up on a Wednesday. It seemed that nap he took the day before as well as the early night was catching up to him, and he had hours before class and was totally bloody awake. He was awake at around the same time he and Potter left the Lake the previous day, and Draco decided to get up in hopes he might see the sun rise again.
"Here and there. Couldn't stay away too long because of this old dog." Remus elbowed Sirius and the man elbowed him back playfully with a laugh.
It was outrageous, as only a few people really knew Sirius was an animagus, let alone his exact form. The only way the information could have been passed on was through Pettigrew, who had undoubtedly spilt the beans to the other side, but as far as anyone knew, he wasn’t there that day. The harrowing thought that it had been Draco’s own father, being the only other known Death Eater by the Order at the station that day, to recognise Sirius settled uncomfortably into the forefront of his mind the rest of his breakfast, rendering him unable to finish his plate of food and gain a few odd looks from his friends.
“That’s right,” Blaise replied coolly.
-o-o-
"Get rid of Dumbledore, then what?"
“Ow- What are you- Draco, stop!” Harry tried to bat him away, and succeeded after a few seconds, but only because Draco retracted the hand himself. “What was that for?” Harry cried, cupping his throbbing ear with a hand.
He set the croissants down in the space between them on top of the napkin, spreading them around with the apple in the centre like some sort of weird platter.
Malfoy leant in the tiniest inch, "
“And not on her own?”
Umbridge’s nostrils flared at the quill on the ground, but she curtly replied, “Of course.”
. In fact, majority of the times, Blaise never got physical in a fight. He'd instead tear you down and defile you to your smallest form with sheer
"What about your parents?"
Harry saw Hermione scrunch her face up at the sight, choosing a seat at a nearby chair which looked considerably less grimy than the sofas. Ron, however, just threw himself down on top of one of them, wheezing and coughing as dust was sent flying in to the air.
“Maybe the Prophet was right.” He heard Draco drawl as he drew nearer. “Laughing to yourself, Potter? Really?”
Before he knew it, he'd peeled the sweaty clothes off his skin and showered once he'd gotten back to his room. Wincing the whole way, he changed in to his night clothes and limped in to bed. His body buzzed with fatigue, and he knew he'd be in much more pain tomorrow.
Unfortunately, what should have been a carefree, sunny day was dampened by that day’s issue of the Daily Prophet. Draco could tell it weighed down on all four of them, as the mention of Sirius being spotted at King’s Cross floated through their minds as blots of ink from the front page.
"Er…What are you guys…" Harry trailed off.
Draco tapped his finger to his lips again, a habit Harry'd noticed when the boy would sometimes think about how to phrase or do something before he did it.
“No I can't.” McGonagall said flatly. Draco held in a snicker.
Sighing at what his life had become, Draco took out his Transfigurations textbook out of his bag and settled in to read, setting a timer until five minutes before their first period with a modified Tempus charm.
"Urgh, no. I mean during classes and stuff, you and me. And what about my friends? Ron and Hermione are bound to realise something's up."
“It’s nothing, Harry. What happened?”
"I…" Draco started, but couldn't finish.
"Shit." Draco muttered, going up to the door and trying to unlock it with his wand to no avail. It must have been a dark arts spell. He was locked in.
He finally saw Harry and Weasley sling their bags over their shoulders, and luckily they had to walk out the class by turning their bodies towards Draco's direction first. Harry was focused on laughing at something the weasel said. Good. Hopefully the paper hit him in the face.
Slowly, he turned his eyes to the table next to him where his wand was laying.
“You think?” The child tilted their head innocently, but there was something in their eyes Draco didn’t like at all.
First off, Draco thought, what the fuck . Draco didn't show it, but he was completely and irrevocably confused as to what Potter was playing at. Asking him to the Yule Ball? He was still struggling to process it, and his immediate reaction would have been to reject the boy outright with generous disgust. Of course, he had sort of walked in to the situation all on his own, if he thought about the conversation over again. Potter had hinted at it and he took the bait- but why even ask in the first place?
Sirius stiffened, eyes wide, but said nothing. Something like understanding passed over him, but he hid it quickly. He stood and walked up to Harry, placing both hands on his shoulders.
Draco had to move. He had get out of the way, but his body was paralyzed and he didn't even have a wand. It's like he was frozen place from anticipation and fear.
one of them. He never tells me about it, though. He never talks about it, and I never asked. I can tell something's happening again, though. He looks worried all the time and my mother keeps looking at me like she's scared of something. If I could do anything to stop it, I would. You must understand I want nothing to do with what my father was involved with in the war. I believe in blood purity, but I don't believe in murder, so don't you
Ron turned his body around in surprise, "What? Really?"
Harry leant in, glancing around even though they were assuredly alone. “Sirius. That’s what we call him.”
"Draco, what's wrong." Pansy said worriedly. Draco just groaned and threw his arm over his eyes.
“Feels good to be back, huh?” Blaise sidled up next to him, rubbing his arms against the evident chill. Draco took out his wand and quickly spelled a warming charm over the two of them, to which Blaise smiled gratefully.
to Harry. Did that night at the Ball really have that much of an effect on him? Harry decided to keep his guard up regardless, however. Merlin knew what motives he had.
“I never said that.” Draco scowled, crossing his arms. “He’s just… extremely consistent in most things I do.”
Harry collapsed into bed late into the night after the evening of his first detention, fully clothed and with a pile of undone homework still sitting in his book bag.
. You can't really be that
Draco sighed, turning on his heel and starting to walk away. “See you, Harry.”
Walking up the stairs, he did indeed pass the curtain-draped painting and heeded Molly's advice by tip toeing past it. Once he reached the top of the first flight, he saw the long, dark hallway and after moment, paused. He hadn't heard it earlier because of the sound of his step on the old wooden floorboards, but now he could make out a loud, raised voice.
Harry stomped on Draco’s foot. Hard.
"And last but not least, Our second Hogwarts Champion! Harry Potter!" Harry quickly adjusted his robes while Malfoy did what Harry could only describe as
But Draco was already barely conscious, and didn't deign a reply. Sleep swept him away, and he dreamt of strange omens of death in the shapes of black shadows.
friends, weren’t they?
"D…Dad." Dudley said weakly, garnering the attention of his father once more. "It's true…I saw the light…"
"Bloody weirdo." Harry thought aloud. The willow tree above him rustled in agreement.
"Amelia Bones?" Draco asked. He'd heard the name before from his father, along with a few added comments that had Draco's own mother tutting disapprovingly. Then again, it wasn't a surprise that his father hated the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
“Erm, yeah.”
"How?" Harry asked urgently.
“That’s right,” Harry said, nodding. Subconsciously, Umbridge seemed to start nodding with him as she hung on his every word. “I said something...and wasn’t it you who mentioned Lucius Malfoy?”
"Well then
"Why don't you just ask?" Draco said thoughtfully. Potter's head whipped up to look at him.
Now he didn't have the appetite at all. In fact, the food looked quite revolting. Nausea coiled in his gut threateningly, and he quickly got up.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh. Granger." He said, relaxing slightly. "Harry isn't here."
-o-o-
Draco took an uneasy gulp, feeling discomfort from it because of how dry his mouth felt. "I know that. That's just another part of the plan."
Draco looked down at his feet, nodding reluctantly.
"Who was in the room again? Dumbledore, Snape, Draco, Bill, Mr. Weasley and…"
"I'm not on his side." He mumbled.
“Hm, what?”
He smiled even though she couldn’t see, getting up and shouldering his bag. Without a second glance, he turned and walked out the class, hand still bleeding.
. Merlin help them all.
Adrenalin immediately flooded through his body. There was nothing outside his window that should have been able to cast shadows in to his room, yet on the walls he could see dark tendrils of blocked light approaching.
." Draco swore. He scanned the maze as if it might tell him where the man was.  "This task. Something's about to happen. Nothing about this feels right-"
"Speaking of Potter." He said bitterly.
“Just one more day.” Harry told him as they walked back to the tower, his right hand feeling very heavy. “You ready for tryouts?”
. She shook her head and he looked back at Ron.
anyways, I hope you enjoyed this chapter! thank you for reading <3
“And Level One?” Blaise asked.
Draco knocked on Snape's door twice, a permitting "Come in." letting him push it open. He walked in to see Snape busy over a bubbling cauldron. The air smelt like Sulphur and strangely of  something sweet he couldn't place.
called out to you and the rest of his followers! Did you answer the call? Because you sure as hell weren't with me while I was being
"Every word that comes out of your mouth is your father's, Malfoy. Keep that in mind." Harry spat, and sat down in the same spot as he did earlier, catching his breath. Malfoy stood rigidly, clutching the sides of his robes in his fists at his sides. His head was bowed, he seemed to be lost in thought. Harry felt his anger subside greatly, having said what he needed to quelling all his repressed anger for the boy for the time being. He looked up, seeing now the moon was at it's midpoint. It looked to be the night after a full moon, making Harry wonder about Professor Lupin. Was he with Sirius? Did they still see each other? Harry got caught up in thoughts about Remus and Sirius before he heard Malfoy speak,
"He definitely tried. I'm not sure if it's a red-herring it not. He just gave me some obscure request." His eyes looked full of fire and determination despite the defeat in his voice. Draco wondered if it was one of those things that would never go out.
." Draco hissed, but Harry just stared shook his head and stared at him determinedly.
"I know that, Ron!" Harry replied defensively, all the while running through ways he would have to break it to Parvati. Oh, God. She's going to hate him. Harry cursed the day the killing curse hadn't worked. Stupid scar, stupid Ball, stupid
He repressed a shudder. His father, whom had been at the graveyard that night. Who had watched Voldemort's resurrection, and answered the call for his followers. All at once, the fact that his father was a Death Eater hit him like a bludger to the head. He was a
"And you told them? Everything?" Harry asked.
Ronald went satisfyingly red, and Draco just held back a smirk.
“So you’re implying that Cedric Diggory died of his own accord, did he?” Harry asked, his voice shaking.
"Fidelius charm."
"You would know about that, wouldn't you Harry." Ron said, clearly establishing whose side he was on.
“Shut it.” Draco slapped his hand away irritably. “Back to what I was saying earlier before you so
"Granger."
"Even your mother?"
, Harry? For real?"
"They do?" Harry said, slightly horrified. "And who is Blaise?"
"Oi, Harry's here." he murmured. Sirius snorted, not unlike the manner in which Harry tried to wake up, and slowly opened his eyes, his head coming off Remus's shoulder. Yawning, he rubbed his eyes and Remus watched on in silence as if nothing could be more important.
Without looking back at Dumbledore, he turned and descended the staircase, leaving the room behind him with a whole new mountain of worries on his shoulders.
"I know." Harry said. "It'll be fine. If they really want to attack me, they'll do it tomorrow if anything."
"…in the light of Voldemort's return, we are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided. Lord Voldemort's gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust. Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open."
They both started and ran inside, leaving the crowd behind them. The roars and cheers became muffled, but still audible. They came to a clearing that split two ways. Harry looked at Cedric and saw decision in the boys eyes. He knew what they would do. Nodding at each other, they turned opposite each other and went their separate ways.
“It’s just…?” Draco prompted gently.
"Draco?" Hermione held back to glance at him in concern.
“You…” Umbridge whispered, horrified. “You...Cedric….”
Draco scanned the room, seeing that a small group of third years, the only other occupants of the room, were far enough that they wouldn’t overhear their conversation.
Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows. “And your name is- ?”
Harry swirled around his tea, staring in to the cup. "No." He mumbled. "Bad dreams."
Looking slightly abashed, Harry shrugged. “It’s a lot of sweets.”
"It's not your fault. Harry. You couldn't have known. You did the best you could."
"You're joking, Weasley?" said Draco Malfoy behind them, "You're not telling me someone's asked
So the house was under a Fidelius Charm. He'd never seen one in real life before - but then again that was kind of the point. Over the summer he couldn't help but look in to the charm a bit more while he'd been meant to be learning Latin. The spell was never actually specified to be cast to hide a house or location, but it was the most common and sensical choice so the two became synonymous over time. The only actual parameters of the spell were to hide a secret within one's soul, which worked out just fine for Draco. If only that idiot Harry would agree to do the spell…
"Just fine, Draco. Now, Ron and the other's are all upstairs so take the first flight and not any higher, understand?"
"I'm sure, Draco. I promise. He's real. It's just Moody. The Auror."
"Too damn hot." Ron gasped, fanning himself.
He buried it deep down, where memories of a long corridor and cold skin lay unbeknownst. They settled together, waiting, biding time. Coiling like a snake ready to strike…
"I've fucked up." He said bluntly. Ron snorted and Harry laughed nervously, the mood feeling a little lighter than before.

, to eat and, what, suffocate? Asphyxiate? Whatever that even means."
, Draco. I told him because he wanted to know about my life, and he looks so lonely, you see, so I ended up telling him about it. And he doesn’t speak to anyone - ever. I promise you can trust him." He slowly took his hand off Draco's mouth as if expecting his head to be bit off. Draco had the right bloody
“Looks like a bitch.” Pansy muttered gravely. “No sane woman wears that much pink without things to hide.”
Harry looked down at his lap. “No, miss.”
, of course. He just didn't want to think about the dance for the time being, or maybe for the rest of his life. He considered going back to Potter and his lackeys to entertain himself a bit more, before spotting Pansy and Blaise waving at him from a corner. Blaise, the git, was smirking too infuriatingly smug to be allowed, and Pansy was suggestively waggling her eyebrows as she mock fainted in to Blaise's arms. Draco sighed. Potter's crew it was then. Giving them a bored look, he turned and traipsed away to where Potter and the Weasel were arguing with Granger.
“I do.” They said, nodding firmly.
. You're the best, Uncle Severus!"
As much as he'd have liked to shower and collapse in to bed, his father dutifully let him go just before seven in the evening, and so he went for tea with his mother. They'd dueled for hours, Draco having gone in to that ballroom at nine that morning and never leaving except for a quick lunch. Even when he was tired, told his father he was too exhausted to even cast properly, he was just answered with another spell in his face. Damn idiot.
Draco turned his head to give Blaise a dull look, to which the smile on the boy’s face dropped.
"Psst!" A voice hissed. Harry quickly pocketed it his wand, scrambling around to the source of the voice. "You! Potter!"
last line is the image of Harry smiling at himself in the mirror despite having been sick and looking like shit on old shit. Cruelly, and unforgivingly.
! It's not like
. Draco bloody knew he shouldn’t have invited her along, but Blaise was busy and Pansy whined about her Divination homework until he finally agreed to let her tag along to have him help her. Reluctantly.
"Don't think I haven't watched you and Potter." The man said, his magical eye now fixed on Draco. "I know what you think of me, and I can't have you intervene after tonight." The man drew out his wand, instantly spurring Draco in to pulling out his own.
A blue light bathed the room, and Harry turned to see it was just coming from the tip of Draco's wand. He was in Draco's room again. He turned back around, but the corridor before was no where to be seen. It was as if he'd been looking at the world through his mind's eye, similar to a waking dream.
He heard Draco scoff above him, “And this Blane Witherby bloke?” the sound of crinkling parchment sounded as if Draco had shaken it pointedly. Knowing the dramatic bastard, he definitely had. “Ever thought he could be one of
"I just have…a lot of stuff going on." Potter said with difficulty. Draco was about to retort that at least he was let off end of year exams until he realised just how much Potter really had on his plate. He had the not-dying in the Triwizard Tournament, the not-dying from the possible Death Eater affiliations with said Tournament, and to top it all the not-dying because of the strongest Dark Wizard coming back to power in the near - or not near - future. Draco bit his tongue ashamedly at what he might have said. As much as he hated to admit it, Potter did have a lot to deal with at the moment. No wonder he was being such a wound-arse all of a sudden. Wasn't the next Task almost a month's away?
The man appeared again, now in the square center. He stood there for a few moments, and Draco held his breath. Moody cast a few spells, but his actions were relaxed. Not necessarily careless, but trivial and unurgent. Draco knew Moody was ever suspicious and attentive, so if there was really a threat he wouldn't be standing in place like that.
Unable to stop himself, he glanced back to the Phoenix, which inexplicably looked more developed. It was looking at Draco for some reason, chirping happily. He couldn’t stop the small smile forming on his own face at the sight, which he found he couldn’t maintain for very long before it fell.
Their Hogwarts letters and booklists arrived a day before Draco was to leave Grimmauld Place.
Harry almost jumped up from shock. "What?" He said, bewildered.
." Draco said on instinct. The tip of his wand begun to glow a cold white colour. It lit up underneath his father's face, sending unflattering shadows across it.
"It was a Dementor." Harry explained, "I used a spell to-"
Hermione shook her head absentmindedly, clicking her tongue, "Did you two read the introduction at all?" She asked disapprovingly.
"Not Cedric." Harry bit out. "Everything else, maybe. But not him. I can't stop blaming myself otherwise."
Pansy paused mid-bite of a piece of toast to narrow her eyes at the both of them, but said nothing.
"Mm. Yes." Snape said, obviously not listening, then swished away towards the house. Draco crushed the paper in his palm and pocketed it, rushing to catch up with the man.
" Draco finished for him. "That means that would have been…Irma Black?"
promise things will pick up pace in the next chapter. thank you if you're still reading!
“She will continue being a puppet, controlled by the Ministry and acting as its pair of eyes.”
"I do! I just do it very close to the deadline. There's a difference." Harry said indignantly, crossing his arms like he was bloody proud of the fact.
"He likes to get to know his meals first." Draco said without missing a beat, and Harry laughed, throwing his head back. Draco noticed how he looked much better rested than before the task. He'd even seen him eating properly in the Hall the last few days. He definitely looked less corpse-ish than before.
“For being stupid in Defense!” Draco retorted, “I know McGonagall gave you the battering already, but I haven’t yet!”
"Again! Does that blasted school not teach you anything?"
"You're ambidextrous?"
in charge?" Ron accused, casually going along with the noticeable segue between topics.
"Uh, no. You said loop or half-circle."
"No. I'm glad I know. He might have just kept lying to me until the Dark Lord showed up on our doorstep one day as the guest of honour." He saw Malfoy shudder, and Harry shuddered too. "I'm sorry I said those things about
Luckily Pansy was still in the Common Room, chatting to Bulstrode and Blaise. Without stopping, Draco called out, "Parkinson, Zabini. With me." And he disappeared in to his dorm room. He knew they would follow.
"It sounded incredibly incriminating!" Pansy finished for him. "You two need to talk things through! We can't have the Slytherin's thinking you've softened up to him or something, Draco."
Draco smirked. "Of course, Molly. Lovely to have finally met you."
“Don’t you have a go at my mother-”
"Don't even start." He bit out, but was only met with a chuckle. Did anyone take him seriously anymore? He was reconsidering his decision to go ahead and build himself a new reputation out of mutual respect rather than fear. It was Blaise's idea, of course, but now he had to
Draco scoffed. "Hermione I can tolerate. It's Weasley that grates on my nerves."
“I’m serious. I really can’t.”
He set it on the floor, not bothering to get to the table and poised his inked quill over the parchment. It hovered there as he hesitated, the black ink collecting on the nub.
Draco felt his knees go weak. At the threat of them collapsing under him, he walked back to the chair he’d been sitting in earlier and sat on it.
, Merlin's sake.
"Alright, then." Hermione surmised, "Let's start small. Where were you just now?"
But Draco still looked slightly worried, "No. You don't
"Uh, Dumbledore said I could. For Harry's, uh…
"I know." Draco walked forward, putting a hand on Harry's stiff shoulder. "I don't know why either. I wouldn't be pleased about it if it were me."
Malfoy muttered to himself for a moment, counting something on his fingers. "I'd say we have around two to three years before he's back full-swing. But it could be more, could be less" Harry didn't bother to ask what he could possibly be so quantitative about the revival of Voldemort that allowed the boy to calculate the figure.
And then, Merlin help them all, Harry had escaped. He took the Portkey back with Cedric's body straight on to the Quidditch Pitch, which was what led to Moody's imposter taking him to where Draco was held. How Moody wasn't Moody at all, but Barty Crouch's presumed dead son, polyjuicing as him.
Ron swore.
It was Draco's turn to scoff, "I am most certainly not looking at you. Anybody with a pair of eyes can see it plain as day." And to change the subject quickly he said, "Why Cho Chang, anyways." Trying to come off as nonchalant.
The wind died, and he was left in stagnancy.
So Harry wrote a short apology on a square a parchment, which he folded carefully in to a tight triangle, edges sharp pointy. He kept it with him for the next few days, waiting for his chance when Draco would be alone or he'd have the best odds of getting it to him without anyone noticing.
Hesitantly, Harry nodded silently and let Ron bring out the first-aid to wrap his hand up. Luckily, the detention had only gone on for two hours, meaning the wounds weren’t as deep or messed up as they should have been.
“...and looking back on Dumbledore’s speech from last year-
“So what, you want her to
"And the next time you expect me to do what you say like some sort of
"How can you say no? Have you lost the plot?" Draco shot back.
Umbridge stared at him for a few moments, arms coiled around herself. She was looking at him as if she really did believe he was crazy and Harry was starting to wonder the same thing.
"What colour was your potion, Harry?" She asked curiously, glancing between his and Ron's parchment.
"He'll know not to speak without my permission." Pansy shot back.
"Right." Sirius's eyes were glazed over quite a bit, "Let's start shall we?" He readjusted his coat and walked to them so he stood to their side. He pulled out his wand, and cleared his throat. "And you're quite sure you want to do this?"
It took all of him not to look as incredibly pleased as he felt, and he and his friends filed out the stands as Harry was swallowed by the adoring crowds.
“Weren’t
"She called the Order, and they brought me here." He could hear Harry speaking through gritted teeth. "That's all it took. They had eyes on me the whole time-"
"Problem, Weasley?"
because I was like that. Merlin knows if someone had joined back then who was a muggleborn.”
, he thought.
What on earth was wrong with him? Did he think Draco was going to poison him or something? No, that couldn't have been right when Draco demonstrated against it earlier.
hah! it's been less than two weeks and i'm updating, which is absurd for my shitty posting schedule.
“Oh, er. No, sorry.” Draco said, “Is this the bullshit you have to do for Divination? Silly dream shit? How on earth does she grade you?”
“Erm...same thing, innit?”
"Yes. You need to get me out of here, Severus. I'm going
“I believe you, Harry.” Ron reassured him, prying his grip off of his sleeves gently. “What about now? Is it alright now?”
"Oh yeah," Sirius said sarcastically, "Listening to Snape's reports, having to take all his snide hints that he's out there risking his life while I'm sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time."
“Yeah.” He mumbled, thinking deeply. Even if he never acted like that again, he was still in Slytherin, where things like bullying muggle-borns and calling people 'dirty blood' were commonplace. Would people start to become suspicious if he stopped being like that completely? He’d just have to try his hardest not to ever let it come up...He’d have to make sure no one started to suspect his character in any way. Almost half his year had parents with Death Eater affiliations for Merlin’s sake-
"Fine." He said, and Harry exhaled a breath of relief.
“Finite. Finite. Finite.” He muttered under his breath, over and over again with his eyes squeezed shut so hard that it almost hurt. In the back of his mind he knew the spell was already gone, but he needed the image gone. His stomach heaved again and in between bouts of convulsions, between the times his guts emptied into the sink, he muttered it over and over and over again, just for himself. So his mind would know that it really wasn’t there anymore.
Spotting Ron and Hermione, he veered around the table to go sit across from the pair. He briefly caught sight of Seamus, who quickly looked away when he saw Harry looking, Harry just shook his head again, wondering what exactly it was that Ron had said to the boy.
" He wanted to cringe at the desperation in his voice, especially if it was for someone like Draco Malfoy, but somewhere deep down he wanted his Godfather's approval because he was all he had. Even deeper down, he also knew what he said was the truth, and he believed that Malfoy wasn't bad or plotting against him.
"Like…all the Death Eater stuff. He doesn't involve Draco. Even what he did in Second Year? With the diary? Draco never knew until that night when I told him."
“I did?” he raised an eyebrow, looking slightly inconvenienced.
"What-"
, so it's just been me and now Hermione actually making this place livable."
"Upstairs in the room at the far end." Hermione said.
"It'll be fine. Maybe I can win, too, huh?" Harry nudged him playfully, but Draco didn't react.
"My hand, Potter." He said, gesturing to it with his eyes. Harry quickly complied, grabbing Draco's right arm with his own with a tight grip. Sirius touched the tip of his wand to the point where their hands met, and he felt a thrum of magic he was too distracted to think about because of Draco grimacing in front of him.
And Wilbert Slinkhard was quite a boring writer, bugger him.
"I said nothing about motives. You put that there yourself-"
"Draco Malfoy." Hermione said for him. "You should have been informed why beforehand…"
." Draco smacked his forehead. "I'm so bloody obtuse. I'm sorry, Harry."
smiles.
"Stop calling Voldemort the Dark Lord." Harry said bluntly. Malfoy's eyes widened a bit, his grey eyes completely black.
pile. He rubbed one of his eyes, the weight of them feeling more than normal from his lack of sleep the night before.
please comment if you need anything specified! i'd be glad to fill you in)
He started to sweat beneath his sickly coloured dark robes, wondering if maybe fake-Moody left a mark on him somewhere that didn't get healed. Was there a scar on him he didn't catch before leaving Hogwarts? He knew his mother's aversion to marks and scars on his body for some strange reason. It never really seemed odd to him until he started Hogwarts. If she saw something now, she'd surely know something was wrong. He started to pull his arm away, but her hold didn't relent.
"I am sorry." He bit out, his head bowed.
Remus reached up to brace both of Draco's arms, and it wasn't anything aggressive or threatening more than it was insistent, keeping his focus rooted on him. "Protect Harry at school, Draco. I know how he gets in to trouble, one way or another."
"I need to talk to you." Draco said, not talking to Snape, but eyes locked on Dumbledore. Snape was in front of Draco in an instant, holding him back with one arm and his shoulder.
Or, at least he hoped.
"Me and Ron will be with you if you need anything, Harry. And no more…walks." She said apologetically, but with an air of there being no room for argument.
"I ask myself the same question about you everyday." Draco hissed, ripping his arm away and chucking the book in to the
"No one can guarantee that he won't." Harry said firmly. "But like he said earlier, we move on and work around it. With the Vow, the likelihood is even less."
"You were attacked." Harry's face suddenly changed. From blank and wide eyed to lined, heavy and burdened. His eyes became weighed down as if all the events of the past night came back to him. "Cruciatus." His voice cracked, and Draco was shocked to see his eyes lining with tears.
Within a second, Mrs. Weasley rounded the bed to his side and pulled him in to a crushing hug of his own. He glared at Harry over her shoulder, whom was smiling brightly. Draco sighed. He guessed he'd bear with the circus a little longer if it made Harry happy.
He lay there awake for a long time, staring blankly at the ceiling as his mind caught up with everything.
the real world!” Umbridge finally seemed to be reaching the end of her calm.
He felt sick. Like his stomach would empty itself at any moment. He was terrible, a terrible friend and a terrible person…
“You’re really not.” Blaise held up a hand as if bothered by the very thought. “I’m aware of what you’re involved with, but as you said, it’s a big ask. I don’t necessarily want to be involved - on either side.”
"-because now that I've accepted, he
Draco said again without looking back. Harry didn't reply, and ended up standing there and looking out to the lake until a grey cloud obscured the sun from it’s direct glare. He looked back, having been deep in thought, and found the other boy curled up in the same spot, sleeping. Still barely thinking about anything at all, he watched Draco until the cloud over them passed through, and the sun began to shine down on them again. Harry's shadow no longer cast over Draco, so he was suddenly bathed in an ethereal light that had Harry looking away quickly, as if being caught looking at something he shouldn't have.
"What is it to you, Ronald?" Granger all but hissed at the boy. Draco sumrised the boy in question, whom was a shade of red he found extremely rare to be on a human being. It's like his freckles were a mere
"Yeah, sure. Tell me Malfoy, as you so graciously always remind me, my parents are dead, are they not?"
Draco held back a retort about the school’s shitty curfew rules, silently getting up (without bowing this time, thank Merlin) and walking up to the door once again.
Harry said nothing throughout, just nodding blankly as if he was barely listening. Mrs. Weasley made a futile attempt to tame his hair with a wet comb, which of course had no effect. After a moment, she sighed irritably, stepping back before sweeping Harry up in to a hug.
“Whatever it is you’re not telling me,” Ron said intensely to him as they walked back quietly, “I hope it’s not hurting you, Harry.”
"Always nice to see family, isn't it?" Sirius said with a rueful smile at Draco, then glanced at Harry. "That's why we always stay quiet around the staircase, Harry."
"Alright, alright." Harry laughed, shaking his head and looking at Draco with the biggest smile on his face it almost made Draco turn red.
"Oh! Severus. Albus mentioned you were arriving today. Please come in." She said, immediately stepping to the side to let the pass with a smile. She nodded at Snape as he passed through, although he barely returned the gesture except with a curt nod. As soon has her eyes landed on Draco, however, her face lit up. "Oh, Draco darling!"
"Uh…" Draco was surprisingly eloquent this morning. "Okay. Can I-"
In the middle, sat Dumbledore. The man's eyes didn't quite reveal any sort of frustration, but Draco had seen him shift slightly on his seat twice in the last minute. He knew the geezer wouldn't break so easily, but one could only wait so long, especially for the old.
Harry sputtered, looking away. "It's the name of the brand, I think." He said, eyes wide and looking around the room as if forbidden to do so. Draco screwed his eyes in confusion. The Muggles branded women? Barbaric, if you asked him. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Harry fidgeting in place.
Umbridge quirked her head to the side, “Pardon me?”
, gentlemen. Just met an amazing girl last night. Really hit it off, we did." He sighed dreamily, whisked up by whatever memory was of the girl as he leaned on his bedpost.
said you could be trusted. Said you and Harry had patched things up over the year. I couldn't believe it, but if Ron was bloody saying you were alright, then it had to be true. Once it'd sunk in that you must have really saved Harry's life, everyone sort of accepted it. Seeing you now, even, it just makes me surer."
"Nothing…It's just, you know. You obviously seem to have my best interest in mind, for some reason, so I…I'm fine if you speak for me."
Draco pretended to consider it for a moment before shrugging. “Nothing to explain.”
Draco looked at him uneasily, then stood from his chair, saying goodbye to Bill.
He felt a stab of anger when he saw a group of Ravenclaws hurry to form a tighter group when they saw him, as though frightened he might attack stragglers. Shrugging it off with an irritated sigh, he made his way to the Gryffindor table, turning his head to look at the Slytherins. He still hadn’t had a chance to speak to Draco yet, but it seemed the boy wasn’t sitting with his friends like usual. Harry frowned at the empty seat between Parkinson and Blase, but looked away quickly when he spotted the latter smirking at him, as if he knew something Harry didn’t. Creep.
The next morning, Ron acted as if nothing had changed and Harry dutifully followed. In fact, it almost felt slightly smoother between them during breakfast, which in turn put Hermione into a brighter mood.
"I can sympathise." Harry said, glancing quickly at Hermione warily. "But look, it's not that bad, right? He was willing, and it solves the issue of him snitching on all of this."
He shut the compartment door, nearly bumping in to Blaise behind him as he'd forgotten the boy was still there.
His quill hovered over the page, and he tapped his finger on it impatiently. What could he say? It seemed Harry assumed he needed the obscurity for Draco's sake, but it wasn't really necessary since he had his own window where he got his post. Draco momentarily shuddered at the thought of his father opening up this indecipherable monstrosity.
"Draco." Snape started. "Don't be so insolent. A few weeks around this Potter boy and now-"
(i also noticed that i'd used gender-neutral pronouns for the child on the train. I just never bothered to assign it a gender while writing, so sorry if you got thrown off a bit! (if it was also referred to as 'it', pay no mind. that was just draco's apathy for children))
Ron stopped abruptly, causing Harry to almost run into him. A hand shot out to grab Harry’s arm and he was steered onto the bench, sandwiched between Fred and George. Ron let go of him and walked around the table with Hermione to come and sit across from him.
"What was really happening?"
"How did you escape?" Moody snarled. "Has he returned?"
Draco thought. Harry was way too much work than he was worth.
come with me."
“Hm?”
"I guess it's the opposite." Hermione said. "He could potentially be very useful."
Draco grit his teeth so hard he wondered how they hadn’t chipped by now. He was glad he hadn't had time to have breakfast after all, as if he had he might have been sick all over the woman’s fluffy pink mistake of a cardigan.
They both turned to Lancaster in the bidding of an answer. Draco almost wanted to be told he was completely wrong for once. He knew the Ministry was bad, but only thought it had been like that for the past decade or so - only ever since the first war happened. This was...systemic. It was an archaic bloody system they were talking about…
"Dunno. It was dark outside, though."
Sirius snorted. "Moony, you should ta-" but was stopped by the look on Remus's face. "Right. Language."
Draco obeyed, and barely jumped out of skin as his father grabbed the arm that was suspended in front of him and positioned it forward.
Harry shook his head regretfully at Malfoy, and the boy begun to reiterate, "Well I can't exactly tell anyone else my father might be becoming a death eater. Especially not the Slytherins." Malfoy added, as if reading Harry's mind, "Who better than someone who already knows? And I need
'We started fighting about his friends - Granger? The mud- muggleborn. He went on about there being no reason to treat purebloods and muggleborns differently and such. Preaching righteously like the Saint he is."
"Really?" Harry gaped, "I thought you would both hate me actually. Maybe even check me for Imperius."
Draco looked at Harry like he was crazy, and fine, besides that he hadn't slept much in a while and possibly looked the same, he probably was. It also possibly had something to do with the maniacal grin broken across Harry's face that he couldn't seem to suppress.
Draco swatted him with a hand and begun to saunter past him as if the prick hadn't just been hugging him like Hufflepuff. He slid the compartment open and stopped just before leaving, looking back. "See you soon, okay?"
"Sit down, Potter." She said when he entered the kitchen without turning around. "I have much to tell you."
“I see,” Draco said thoughtfully, “So it’s for the safety of the archives themselves?”
“Oh,” said Ron, comprehension dawning across his freckled face. He looked quickly back at Harry, holding out an arm apprehensively. “Harry, you don’t need to have a go at him-”
“Hm, maybe. Pansy?”
“No, I just like the ambiance.” Harry replied, which he amended after Draco’s blank expression with, “Sending something to Snuffles.”
He stood for a few moments, reveling in his projected greatness. Blaise was looking up at him, unamused, but Draco ignored that and rode his few moments of elation.
"Here. Have some." Draco said simply. He didn't look at Potter directly, but saw the boy's head whip to his in the corner of his eye. Draco sat back on his hands with a sigh of contentment and let himself soak in the soft hues of the sun.
He made a round once around the Common Room before going to bed, greeting students he was familiar with and introducing himself to others. Many looked surprised or even scared when he did, but he had made a point to remember that he was trying to play nice to his House because of what Blaise had said a few months prior.
"Harry!"
, Granger. He asked
"Bingo." Sirius said with a crooked grin.
“Not at all,” Draco answered automatically, not bothering to really think about if it was true or not. He wasn’t going to tell Dumbledore the truth either way. “He’s been...Harry.”
Draco's eyes flicked to his father's disgusting aubergine-coloured robes. "Your torso."
“Y- Yeah.” Harry bit out. There were tears forming in his eyes from suppressing his body’s reactions to the pain. He didn’t need Draco to be worrying about his scar as well as the other things he had to do. The boy already looked almost crushed under the weight of all his responsibilities, and Harry did not need to be one of them as well.
"It could still be there to give him the advantage. One he didn't have last time." Sirius said. "But regardless, Dumbledore's been tight-lipped about it all."
Ron snorted, "You told him that? To his face?"
“Oh,” Hermione’s eyes widened curiously, “What did he say?”
"And focus on school, not the Order."
"I defected to Dumbledore's side before the end."
. He was alive, and he came back, although a little more bruised and scarred.
“Erm, yeah?” Harry asked, fidgeting with impatience. Merlin, he was so
"Ow! What the hell?" Harry yelped, but caught the apple before it reached the ground.
"Harry, come and eat first." Draco said to him at some point as he was checking on the second batch of eggs he was cooking up.
"This is how we treat mudbloods. This is what you devote yourself to, you foolish, stupid boy." Moody was kneeling next to him now, whispering harshly as Draco twitched on the floor.
Harry nodded, his shoulders relaxing slightly. "What do we do now, though."
"Do feel free to use my cloak." He offered amusedly, crossing his arms and looking in the direction Draco had just disappeared in. He was met with silence, and he rolled his eyes. "You're going to leave me like this?" He asked innocently, before he felt a poke in his side which he greeted with an embarrassing yelp.
"Right." The boy said boredly, but something in his eyes said something else.
"He is a good man, by all means." Remus continued, looking at Draco, "I don't know how we'd have survived the first war without him. There's no doubt that his intentions are anything but for the right reasons, but he has a tendency to do whatever it takes to achieves that. That includes moving people like chess pieces."
“Hey, is Slytherin scheduled for the pitch today?” Harry asked suddenly, breaking the spell of quiet.
“I know.” Ron said, his hand still reassuring on Harry’s back. “It’s shit.”
“How was detention, Harry?” she asked, snapping him out of his longing gaze at the food.
"That worked out well then." Harry remarked, and Draco snorted. His eyes flicked to Harry quickly and something glinted in his eyes for a second that Harry didn't understand.
"Went well." He muttered to himself.
"The task? Stop the task?" A hand came to his forehead but he batted it away quickly.
“Yes.” Harry said, almost too easily. Draco almost rolled his eyes. No shame, that one.
"Yeah." He thought of all the times he and Draco were down by the Lake together. Each time he found Draco there studying, or when he'd find him scribbling random lines on his parchment as Harry spoke, under the pretense that he too busy studying to even listen. He thought of Draco's veiled warnings about the tasks, the subtle helpings he gave when Harry had been frustrated out of his mind.
"There's another war coming." Draco said, ignoring Blaise's question. Blaise didn't seem to notice, "What? A war?" He gasped. Draco nodded gravely.
"Oh, we already ate." Hermione said bluntly.
"Fuck you." Harry grumbled, and Draco laughed again. Bloody prat.
"Will you, Draco?" He repeated, maybe even a bit louder than before. The red wires danced between them, and he knew he must have looked a sight as their red light sent daunting shadows over his face.
"Sirius was framed by Pettigrew, and he came back to Hogwarts to find him but everyone thought he was after me."
i caved.
It was nice though, he thought again. Being stood there with his perpetual rival, but not feeling the usual animosity he usually would for once. It made him think that he maybe things weren't how he thought they were, and for that he felt relief for once.
. They were immediately bathed in darkness again and silence permeated the air, the lapping of the lake and a distant owl hooting the only sounds between them.
a reason to be in the Hospital Wing, and complaining of mental distress just had a Calming Draught stuffed in his hands on the way out while Harry was still passed out on his bed with a black dog guarding him.
Remus was quiet for a moment before his hand on Draco's shoulder squeezed him briefly. "Then shall I only send you one in case he doesn't? Before school? Just in case, of course."
With that, he left the tower with the vague, deep-seated feeling that Harry was lying to him about something, but he didn’t know why.
"The it's like Remus and Sirius said," Draco replied coolly, "Watch my back, alright?"
Dumbledore, however, did not find it funny. "Indeed, Draco. I will not say much except that Voldemort and Harry's paths have been intertwined for a long time, and a long time coming. Now you and Harry's have merged, and so has the path to Voldemort as well."
Draco's eyes narrowed. "What about you and Sirius?"
“Sh’ve woken me.” Harry chastised sleeplily, sitting up quickly and putting on his glasses.
"What did you just say?" Ronald asked incredulously beside him.
"As I said before, Potter, I don't care. I don't care if you can't seem to realise that you're not invincible. It's too dangerous to be careless, and you should have known better - especially with me. Stay away from the bloody Lake, or so help me I will hex you until you can't walk straight."
“Oh, Merlin, don’t fall asleep.” Draco sat up, prodding his back. “Come on, get up. Time for bed.”
Draco stopped at the Owlery entrance, looking over his shoulder where Harry’s back was facing him. “Don’t be a stranger, alright?”
Harry woke up in the same position he'd fallen asleep in hours later, and the sun was just beginning to disappear in to the Lake horizon. He looked over and saw Draco still on his side facing away from him, hushed, even breaths marked by the steady rise and fall of his shoulders.
"Morning." Draco said amusedly.
So that Friday morning, Draco and Blaise stood inside Snape’s office, eyes glued to their respective wristwatches while their other hands held a chipped teacup Portkey between them.
Once inside, he almost had to rub his eyes to ensure his sight was sane. The room was
The morning of his final detention, Harry unwrapped the bandage Ron had applied for him to see that, just like the day before, the wounds shaped in the blasted line he had to keep writing were now completely healed. It seemed that while not efficiently, the residual healing magic instilled in the quill still lingered and worked to close up the cuts overnight.
“Of course he hasn’t,” said Harry firmly, although he wasn’t sure it was very convincing. Looking more at the table, his blood ran cold from the sight of Dolores Umbridge seated next to Dumbledore looking like somebody’s maiden aunt: squat, with short, curly, mouse-brown hair in which she had placed a horrible pink Alice band that matched the fluffy pink cardigan she wore over her robes.
"I was not crying!" He said in a voice two octaves higher than his usual. At Blaise's raised eyebrow he huffed and stared at the ceiling as if begging it to fall down on top of him.
“Mr. Malfoy.” Mrs. Pince called out sternly, tapping her watch. “It’s about time to pack up, please.”
“Maybe you could even actively go against me somehow,” Harry continued, “That’d really cement your position.”
Lancaster looked up, blotchy and red. “Of course they wouldn’t bloody tell me!”
Five days before the Second Task, the three had agreed to sneak books from the Restricted Section, much to Hermione's chagrin. They were all becoming more and more desperate, and Harry couldn't help but feel incredibly bad that Ron and Hermione were putting their own studies aside for him. He felt so wound up he barely slept at all, and never had any energy to spare to go down to the Lake either morning or night.
He'd surmised that his father's guests probably weren't on the good side of neither the Ministry nor the law, telling by their shabby appearances that just screamed 'criminal'. When they finally did leave, however, Draco managed to catch a hint of their conversation as the door opened and their voices filtered out.
Sometimes, he didn't know if Harry still thought he was the same terrible person he was before, but he wouldn't blame him if he did. Draco wasn't a nice person, and he didn't have a heart of gold like Harry did hidden down somewhere inside him. He just hoped that if he did as much as he could for this coming war, regardless of his horrible personality, maybe he'd finally extract himself from his father's shadow of ideologies and end the cycle with him.
As for a posting schedule, we have no posting schedule. I am a creature of spontaneity and sporadic bouts of writers block.
Draco raised an eyebrow, trying not to let his amusement show. This Hufflepuff hugging bullshit was going to have to stop very soon, but he couldn't help but match the boy's joy at their plan having not only worked, but allowing Harry to win the task.
The tea tray sat between them again, and his mother made no move to start. With a sigh, he winced and pushed himself up. He poured his mother a cup, adding one spoon of sugar, then poured himself some with three spoons. She took it and sipped it contently, and he leaned back again in the chair with the warm cup on his hands.
-o-o-
At Harry's wince, Draco almost slapped himself. "Sorry." He said apologetically. He decided to make himself useful and turned around to start the kettle on the stove.
He let Harry become uncomfortable under his gaze for a few moments, then waved a hand at him noncommittally, "If you must."
on the ground. Real outside ground, in fact. Opening his eyes slightly had an onslaught of sunlight violating them. He groaned out loud, turning over and grimacing at his stiff back. Another paper rustled next to him and he wondered if he'd left his books out. He could imagine it clearly, all his essays and notes tumbling away in the wind. He almost didn't want to open his eyes. Maybe for a while longer…
Then Harry's scar seared with severe pain, almost as if his head might split open. He cried out, conscious just long enough to see Draco scrambling towards him before the world went black.
you really like then, Harry?" She had asked a few days before when he voiced this. But Harry couldn't answer her, so he just shrugged and grabbed his own food, putting it on top of what Hermione had picked and taking a few bites.
"I am not one of them." Snape said sullenly.
Draco leant forward to the edge of his seat. “What exactly is it that he does?”
"Sorry." He said immediately, stepping away and shoving his hands in his pockets.
"It's Remus now, you lot." Remus said, smiling at the three of them. "Merlin, look how big you all are."
“To some extent, yes.” Draco said quickly, “But look, it’s not from Umbridge.” He gestured to the unfamiliar print of handwriting that differed to the flowery print the Defense Teacher used in class that day. At the bottom of the letter, there was no signature for who might have sent it.  “I don’t think it’s hers.”
“Now, I’m sure I don’t need to explain just what was wrong with any of your behaviour, Mr. Potter?”
Draco snorted, and everyone looked at him. "He is infuriatingly thorough." He remarked. "What was done in a two hour meeting could have easily been said in five minutes."
"No! I want to know what he was thinking!"
“Cedric was killed.” Harry leant back away to a more comfortable distance, oozing confidence.
"More than we need to know?"
“Good evening, Mr. Potter.” Umbridge spoke, reminding Harry that although the pinkishness of the room was bad,
"M'fine." Draco mumbled, straining to get a clutch on to the split-second thought he had that made everything make sense. "You should get some sleep."
"Severus left a few minutes ago. Said he'd be back soon." Sirius said to him, letting go of Harry with a ruffle of his hair. Harry was beaming at the man, and the tension in Draco's body melted away slightly at the sight.
" at the spell he'd been memorising the movement to for days now.
“Language, Hermione.” Ron chirped, but shrunk away when she glared at him.
"And medical attention he will receive." Dumbledore said in a tone that left no argument. McGonagall stared at him incredulously. "Harry, if you will come with me, please."
"You absolute
"I'm aware." His mother said. "You will still have time for tea at seven, however."
"Draco isn't so elf-y, though, is he?" George remarked to everyone else.
Unfortunately, he didn't have much time to think about Potter and his amazing mood wings, because as soon as dinner ended, he found himself falling in to bed the earliest he's ever gone since he was a child. Within almost moments he was already falling asleep, although a glance at his watch on his bedside table before he fell told him it was far too early to do so. He dreamt vaguely of seeing the moon outside his dormitory window - despite being underneath the lake - and the green windows of the Common Room casting shadows of a sinister shape all over his bed covers, filling his head with lead sleep.
Blaise patted him on the back lightly, wiping away tears from his face. “Man, that was good, mate. Thanks for that.”
"Me too. Just...be patient." Draco assured him, but even he didn't sound convinced.
, is wrong with you? It's a clip! A fucking clip! Get the fuck over it!"
, Blaise."
“Nice day, innit?” Harry was suddenly beside him, gazing out the window as well.
"Shut it for a moment, Draco. You have to admit he's changed things. It's just a fact. One of those things is you, it seems. I can't explain it, but you're different now and people are noticing."
"Alright." Draco muttered, thoughts flashing through his mind of seeing an owl in the next week arriving at his room to tell him there was something wrong with Harry. He knew maybe he was overreacting, but  leaving Harry there just like that felt wrong.
"We've never tried to hide it, but in general we try to be low key about it."
“Wow!” Draco gasped, looking at Blaise to share amazed looks. “It’s much more complex than the Archives are given the reputation for.”
"What?" Draco protested. "Why?"
"It's quite alright, Severus. We should be wrapping up soon, anyway." Dumbledore said.
"Remember the Dark Mark in the sky? At the World Cup? Like that, but on your arm. It's black but it makes the skin around it look ugly and green." Draco said disdainfully.
Draco looked around his friends, hoping they werent' there and somehow died on the Great Staircase or something. He knew, just
“And class we will have!” She tittered, wrapping her cardigan more tightly around herself and smiling up at him.
"Ron." Hermione said dully.
"Bend over." He said.
“How many times?” Harry asked, trying his best not to scowl at her.
-o-o-
Harry couldn't help the frown that settled on his face. "Yeah, eventually."
. I figured you went to bed and Potter weaseled off to his lackeys." Blaise said thoughtfully. "So you two agreed to talk, and then…"
"That isn't necessary right now. Just be ready when I summon you. Don't worry about your father, I will handle him."
such spells.”
Harry looked out the window to see the sun had already gone down and the room had been doused in a cold, white flame that managed to light up the entire room. He hadn't even realised how much time had passed. It still, however, seemed  too early to go to sleep based on what his watch was telling him.
"Blimey." Ron said, "So he really was a git for nothing, eh?"
Draco shook his head roughly, “No, because I can’t observe someone when they’re already observing me, Harry. The point was to watch her as she watched Dumbledore. It’d only be a hindrance if she were focused on me in hopes I might give her something to work with.”
"And you'll understand how important this is." Draco prompted.
“What on earth are you two bickering about outside of my office for?” she snapped.
, Draco thought to himself as he stared at the man across him. He had the feeling that was also what Dumbledore was trying to get at, which was unnerving. What was he trying to tell Draco? That he was also not untouchable? That his own pedestal was also a mere illusion?
"And not only that, but your magic's been entangled not just for life, but until death. I'm sure you can infer the difference?"
. “It’s never a good sign when you’re quiet.”
"Christ." Harry muttered, and Draco smirked at the irritation in his voice. "I didn’t say that. Besides, I don't particularly see the lines of Hogwarts's best outside your dorms."
Draco gritted his teeth and ran through basic arithmancy formulas in his head. "You've got your hand on my
Harry looked over his Uncle's shoulder, where Aunt Petunia was stood with tears streaking down her face and looking worse for wear. She stared at Harry with wide, fearful eyes for a moment, then turned away to presumably where Dudley's room was.
"It's him…" Harry sobbed in to Draco's shoulder, "He's back…"
"How come you're here, then?" Ronald piped up skeptically beside Granger.
"Mother-" He said, trying to take his arm away but not wanting to use so much force as to hurt her.
Pansy snorted, “It’s Potter, Draco. The kid, by fair logic, should have been long dead by now.”
“I need a copy of this.” Draco said resolutely. “I can’t read it all now.”
“So you’re saying there’s nothing out there? We’ll be completely safe, all willy-nilly just walking around the streets-” Harry looked as if he were reaching a tipping point.
Remus laughed again, bringing a hand to wipe a tear from his eyes. "I guess we aren't. I blame Sirius for that."
Malfoy smiled, if only for a little bit, and that was enough to convince Harry that this night wasn't a complete failure. He got up, dusting off his trousers, then held a hand down to Malfoy.
"I'm fine." He murmured in to her hair. "Honest."
“Even after you were quite the same at that age?”
"I was the one that got her out." Harry said simply, but he didn't want to talk about himself at the moment. He looked at his watch and saw they had been gone for an hour and nobody seemed to have noticed. All the better for him, he thought. The Ball was a drag.
"Potter!" He heard Snape call out. Wincing, he turned around to face the man now towering over him. "Are you finding it difficult to comprehend picking up simple ingredients for this Potion." He said, a gleefully sadistic look in his eyes.
"Evergreen with some Essence of Belladonna." Snape confirmed, stirring the potion gently until it was a brighter green and the mixture was now almost completely shimmering in the candlelight.
" then got jabbed in the ribs by the Slytherin's pointy fucking elbows. He hissed and stomped on Malfoy's foot.
"Well, we don't really know what will happen, but that's why Bonds while underage are unadvisable. Your magic now has to be able to develop around the Bond, and there's no telling how it will affect the Bond itself."
"Shh. Now, lunch will be ready soon, but until then don't come downstairs as there are Order meetings happening."
"You had a meeting?" Harry turned back to him, and Draco noticed how close they were standing while others definitely weren't.
It was a large atrium, not unlike the one on the main floor of the Ministry. They seemed to be on some sort of balcony, and reaching the railings they both gasped at the large expanse of magically moving shelves and sections throughout the hall below them. There were rows and rows of the shelves, some moving and shifting around as new items were sectioned in and others were levitated out. It seemed that the Ministry had foregone as much physical manpower for these floors particularly, as he saw almost no one else in the room.
, he thought, eyes flicking down to the parchment, fully lined with his scrawl in wine red blood.
"Well, the Ministry's not too happy with Albus. Especially Minister Fudge - thinks Dumbledore's out for his job and now that he's gone senile."
"-into the family! With human beings!"
“W...what?” Draco coughed some more but was listening curiously.
Finally, he made it to the mouth of the forest, and he could see that it was far darker inside than the open field in between it and the Manor. He looked back at it now, a tall, dark spot in the otherwise green surroundings, and turned back to the forest. Deciding the forest was far less imposing, he started inside and fell in line with the hushed, tranquil atmosphere in the wood.
"Oh." Harry said, thinking for a moment. "Was she like…looking at you weird up and down and stuff?"
The Great Feast went as normal, and the child from the train had indeed been sorted into Slytherin. Hoorah! It could now annoy him for the rest of the year, too.
"Right…" Sirius said, looking between them. He sighed deeply, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Always something with you, Harry." he said resignedly, turning away and leaving to guard again and leaving them alone again.
Draco barely held back a scowl. This woman was getting creepier by the minute.
crying, Draco. Malfoys
"He said it?" Ron asked, not even glancing at Harry. Hermione nodded and Ron rubbed his face. "Blimey."
Draco quickly left to retrieve Madam Pomfrey and let her know Harry was awake and needed something to eat.
"I…I don't want to sit near him." He whispered. The hand on his shoulder squeezed and let go.
“Why do I have to carry the bag?” Blaise hissed disgruntledly beside him as they walked, irritably adjusting the strap over his shoulder.
Malfoy snapped the book shut and held it to his chest, "I thought about it the whole day, Harry. The more I looked at these notes…maybe it's not such a good idea. What I said was completely theoretical.
this!" Draco felt a stab of pity for Nott. Blaise never usually raised his voice, but right then he knew things were only going to go downhill for Nott. He kept his eyes closed and surreptitiously tried to reach for his wand on his desk, but…
Draco, smartly, said nothing. His stomach burned in the place he’d been jabbed, but seeing as the conversation had been dropped, it had been worth it.
Harry knocked on the door of Draco's room later that night, his stomach full to the brim from the celebratory dinner they'd thrown for him. There were whispers throughout that Dumbledore would be there for it, but of course he wasn't. He couldn't even spare Harry a glance when the trial ended, let alone show up for some light socialising with the people working with him.
"Harry began to write, starting up the cycle of pain again," -------> "He dropped it again." ----> Chapter Spoilers: [from this point, Harry runs to the bathroom again, meeting Ron on the way and starts to be sick again. Ron follows him and bandages Harry's hand, finding out about the use of the blood quill during detentions. Harry urges him not to say anything and finds out Ron is trying out for Quidditch Keeper.]
Harry feels sick from turning his eyes red, comparing himself to the only other red-eyed motherfucker in his life. He runs to the bathroom, disgusted with himself but also gleeful at having his plan work. Umbridge had looked near about to shit her granny underwear.
Seeing Draco peering at him curiously, Sirius smirked at him, saying nothing. Draco quickly looked away, focusing on watching Harry and Molly cook alongside each other. He didn't know who Moony was, but the person seemed to awaken something in Sirius to an ecstatic degree. There was a light in his eyes that wasn't there before that Draco thought wouldn't ever change from his years in Azkaban. Draco wondered if it was the man's girlfriend, but then again when would a fugitive of the law have the time to acquire one? It could have been someone from before he'd gone to Azkaban, but who would really wait that long for someone else in prison indefinitely?
"Cursed object, my arse. Cursed four times in two hours?" He muttered, and Draco turned to Harry again and winked behind Ron's back. His eyes focused somewhere behind Harry and his face turned in that of horror.
Both Harry and Ron ushered her upstairs quickly, leaving to their own dorms in an embarrassed silence. Even before blowing out the candles next to their beds, Harry could still spot the flush on his best friend’s face as he climbed into bed.
"Ron too, Draco. He does exist, you know."
"Ever since you and Potter had that ruddy truce, you haven't been the same-"
"Well, get on with it. I can tell you're bursting to tell me what it was."
Second of all, half the work was up to Draco himself. Harry just hoped the boy had practiced some Quidditch over the summer. For once, Harry needed the boys Seeker reflexes to be as good as possible.
"Erm, right." Harry said hesitantly. "We'd already established-"
Draco smiled despite himself at the memory, quickly glancing at Bill in case he'd offended him. Luckily when he looked up, there was a humorous glitter in the man's eyes. Draco looked back down at his lap, his smile fading with another deep gulp.
"Some people actually study, Potter." Malfoy said, making a note on his parchment and looking back at his textbook. Harry wondered for a moment if Hermione might ever get along with the boy based on how much they valued their studies so bloody much. He swiped the thought away quickly. When pigs flew, maybe.
"Bloody hell." Ron sighed next to him.
"Really?" Harry spun away, back turned to the sizzling eggs he was in charge over "What time?"
"Whoever's there, show yourself before I bite you on the ass." The man said, wand held out with a lethally serious look on his face.
Grumbling, he packed up his materials and exited in the Library in a flurry of irritation.  It was still around five in the evening, meaning Harry was already in the midst of his detention for the second day.
me!" She said, glaring at him.
"That's barbaric." Draco said in and exclaimed whisper, "We don't even do that to
there myself!"
Draco’s eyes widened. “Wow. You think he’s alright?”
Harry almost scoffed, but realised that would have been rude so he just smiled tightly over his shoulder. “M’ fine. You guys?”
"Nothing good will come about if you die before you kill You-know-who." He muttered after a pause, resting his chin on his arms.
Malfoy hummed noncommittally at that, "For once, I think I agree with you." He said thoughtfully.
Harry laughed again. “Fine. Well, I should get going  - oh, but before I do.” He glanced at Draco  smugly, “Hermione says you’ve been asking about me.”
His mother said nothing after that, but he still felt the shame creeping over him. His father would have a fit if he knew Granger beat him out of the whole year. He took the last sip of his tea and set it down on the tray.
"Weasley, by Merlin himself, have you never heard of
"Don't say anything." Draco said, eyes shut and pinching the bridge of his nose. "He was right. All of it."
"What business is it theirs?" Draco asked.
"Guess that's not the case anymore." Ron chuckled, and he high-fived Harry. Draco wasn't impressed by that.
"Now, look, Moony, you're embarrassing him!" Sirius exclaimed. "If you really think about it, after all the hell he gave these three-"
Dean seemed to be dressed ready as he sat idly on his bed, but was unfortunately waiting for Seamus, resulting in all three as late as Ron and Harry were.
the bloody offer!" Ron winced and rested his forehead into his arm.
But the rest of her words were drowned by a horrible, ear-splitting, blood-curdling screech. The sudden sound, now next to Harry through the draped curtains he'd eyed the day before, caused him to trip and fall over one his feet.
"Someone needs a nap." Draco muttered, just loud enough for Harry to hear. Without waiting for a reaction, he threw the napkin on his lap on to the table and took their empty plates to the sink. Making sure not to spare a backwards glance, he left the room. After waiting a moment, he popped his head back in to the kitchen with a frown.
"Grimmauld Place." Snape said next to him, looking at the house with the same amount of repulsion Draco felt.
Draco honed in on the mass of Hogwarts teachers seated together, not far off the podium where the champion will inevitably stand.
Draco felt his cheeks heat. "That's why I did it. I figured if I do the complete opposite of what my father wants, I won't end up like him." He said, not realising how sad it sounded until he said it out loud. "And the Weasley's aren't bad people, actually. I think I was rather just a bit…jealous, to say, of them."
to understand."
." He said back cockily. She directed her glare at Harry and he unashamedly cowered a bit under it. Sodding Malfoy.
" He jumped up from his chair to tower over Harry, "And you already had a date!'
Draco snorted to himself, taking out the folded letter from the back pocket of his trousers. He opened it up, then cast a
Draco grabbed Blaise's arm and pulled him close, whispering harshly, "Then whose is it, Blaise? It's my responsibility. I'm the only one who
"Oh, Harry. He has a point." Hermione said, reading over his shoulder.
He hesitated as she immediately turned around and marched inside, before shrugging to himself and following. Hedwig hooted warningly behind him, where he'd hidden his stuff behind a bush, but he dutifully ignored her.
"Now get up." His father said, getting up to stand as well. Draco did so, and his father came to stand closer in front of him. "Lift your wand with your right."
"You're taking my being here quite well." Draco remarked with a raised eyebrow.
, Blaise, that I am the embodiment of Slytherin. Some may have even mistaken me for the Heir of Slytherin himself!" Draco said proudly, crossing his arms defiantly.
"Well, dear Potty, besides your little event earlier, you really don't notice you're looking at him all the time?"
get his revenge on them. Like he talks about the war, but it's in future tense. I just never thought about it enough."
“Well, many people believe that those levels are restricted because they’re often dangerous or harmful to the common public eye, but that really isn’t the case! Level three is for items we receive that we can neither deem safe nor appropriate for public consumption due to the state we received them in. You see, often we’ll receive things that may be too fragile to be handled by just anyone.”
, somehow. Draco shuddered again, feeling goosebumps appear on his arms. If the Slytherin's found out, he'd be cast out of the Slytherin circle altogether. He couldn't have that just yet if he was going to be of any use to Potter in the future.
"You really think so?" Harry was focused on his face as if he didn't even notice Draco adjusting his clothes.
He left the room, and Harry busied himself with nothing important at all in his trunk, if only it would give him something to focus on other than those horrible feelings. He did that silently, Draco and Hermione also silent behind him.
“Wh- This isn’t the way to McGonagall’s-” Harry started.
He thought of his bleeding hand, the pain searing over and over as he wrote and wrote and wrote…
Draco braced himself, but his mind was too scrambled to even think. Was Harry in the same position he was? Was Harry already dead? Would they both die that night?
"I made sure he knew you weren't like that. Don't worry."
"French toast." She explained. "And Harry there's making the sunny side's."
A lot of children weren’t talking to him as much as they were with Pansy, as a result. That was, besides one.
But not letting Harry go back was absurd. They couldn't legally expel him, especially if it was a first time offence.
"Always thought the Malfoy's looked a little…pointy-eared." Draco heard George whisper to Fred.
Harry woke up the next morning to Ron shaking his shoulder, seeing that the others in their dorm were probably already dressed and at breakfast.
benefit of taking it! Did you hit your fucking head falling for the girl?" Blaise's honeyed drawl shot back.
“Thank you,” Blaise said, promptly turning on his heel to walk into the elevator again as Draco followed.
Applause rang out for what felt like the longest song in existence, but Draco was too busy staring in to the emerald eyes of Harry Potter, who's firm grip on his waist only seemed to falter every time the boy panted an exhale of breath above him. They looked at each other for a few moments as the applause seemed to go on, the charmed ceiling making stars glitter around Potter's head like a halo. The boy was smiling, and Draco seemed to be smiling back.
Harry's eyebrows rose. "Why were they talking about me?"
“Contrary to popular belief, Professor, I’m not actually a liar.” Harry intoned, voice solid despite the crumbling of the other person inside him. Cedric….he was truly sorry…
"Don't get hurt, Harry." Hermione whispered in his ear, muffled through her bushy hair.
"Sirius." Remus said, now looking at the man. "You did this?"
Pansy stopped with her mouth open in shock, and Draco felt the same as she looked. Umbridge shot Pansy a tight smile, which turned sweeter and much more sickly as she turned to Draco.
"Enough of your stuttering, boy. You may stay but
“Blaise,
"Sod off." Harry waved him off. "Now you're just begging for compliments."
“Well,” Harry said cautiously, “I’m… I’m on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. And I was supposed to be at the tryouts for the new Keeper at five o’clock on Friday and I was - was wondering whether I could skip detention that night and do it — do it another night…. instead...”  His voice felt barely above a rough whisper. For some reason, the woman had placed a deep seated fear inside of him that he couldn’t shake, and it took all of his willpower to maintain eye contact. He’d felt true fear before, but standing in front of Umbridge, he wondered why it almost felt the same.
going to get along with her.” Pansy complained with a huff.
"I think you should try it." He said.
“If you mean Professor Lupin,” piped up Dean Thomas angrily, “he was the best we ever —”
"You're taking
He walked down to breakfast with his mind already centred around how he could get Umbridge’s attention off Draco for the time being. Ron chattered the whole way, something about Hermione and her knitting, and he nodded and mumbled replies at the appropriate moments.
"Bugger." Harry muttered, seemingly unaware that he was still grasping Draco's hand with his own. "I'd managed to forget my hearing for a bit."
"Eat some first, though." He gestured to the food and Harry wrinkled his nose.
“Risk free?” Burst out Harry’s voice, hand already up, to Draco’s amusement. The three had taken to just keeping them up constantly, which looked remarkably stupid but stupidly clever. “How can you teach Defense in a risk-free way? Dark Arts is never going to be in a risk-free enviro-”
Malfoy reluctantly sat back down as well, mirroring Harry's outstretched legs.
Blaise suddenly looked very serious, staring off thoughtfully, "And…what did you say?" He asked, his voice quiet, almost cautious.
Draco spat out his pumpkin juice and started coughing violently, Blaise patting his back sympathetically although smiling devilishly.
The corner of Harry's mouth twitched. "Very descriptive." He murmured back.
“Hermione.” Ron cut her off, “Maybe not here, yeah?” He gestured around them and Hermione pursed her lips.
"I'm not discussing
"Bye, Draco." Harry heard Sirius call out.
"You, Draco?"
and people who don't bother with your pureblood bigotry
, if you would have shut up for a moment." He said in a tone that made Harry wonder if the same person was even there with him earlier. Harry was glad he wasn't treating him any differently than before, even if was still a prick.
"Could I have, though? It bizarre enough for me. Imagine me telling Ron that I was with Malfoy the whole night."
“None of my family’s been Slytherin for generations.” They grumbled. Alright, at least they were pure-blooded.
"What do you mean?" Ron asked.
i lived, bitch
Draco smiled. He heard the footsteps of Arthur, Sirius and Remus coming down the hall, so he reached out and squeezed Harry's shoulder. Looking in to his eyes, he nodded at him.
!" Draco swore loudly, making everyone look at him. He looked up back at the three of them, looking extremely irritated. "I'm a bloody prefect!" He said it in a way that indicated he'd come to a grave conclusion.
-o-o-
The boy whipped his head to Harry in confusion, and Harry didn't wait. He raised his hand as quick as he could and flicked the note to Draco, whom thankfully caught it in his chest within a second with reflexes Harry had played against in Quidditch games for years.
. Was he an
“I assume that’s all reserved for Unspeakables,” Blaise suggested absent-mindedly, his eyes searching the area before catching on to something. “There.” He pointed to the left side of the room where the balcony branches off along the walls. A door, noticeably grander than the rest, was at the very end.
, you cow.”
"Lolligo." Harry said that the same time.
"I'm good." He said without looking at Harry. "Tired."
"See? I said-"
Draco nodded, not really caring what Harry's friends did but listening anyway.
"You didn't tell your friends? I'm surprised since you're all conjoined at the hip." Draco said admonishingly. Seeing Harry's expression, he continued, "Right, well. It's best we keep this a secret for now. Pansy and Blaise won't tell anyone, but from now on it stays between us, yeah?"
"Joke's on
Harry set down the parchment slowly. The sounds of singing birds outside finally registered in his mind, having been absorbed completely in the letter.
"Lover's spat?" Blaise said from beside him.
"I know what you are." Draco said when the laughing subsided.
“Bloody hell.” Draco muttered, astounded. “And his name?”
"Yes, like that. That and how I don't believe in the traditional pureblood ideologies, and how I don't support the Dark Lord- sorry, Voldemort."
"Let's hope so." Draco said, trying to sound as hateful as he could. He squeezed his hands together in his lap. He was fine. He had sworn an Unbreakable Vow. He couldn't say anything even if he wanted to.
"So you want to share
Harry felt Hermione lean over their shoulders to check their notes, a habit she had developed over the years. Harry attributed the act alone to how Ron and Harry made it all the way to Fourth Year.
The buzz from the Great Hall grew more eminent as they approached, and Harry begun to observe the slow trickle of Yule decorations leading to the hall. Small charmed snowflakes began to fall elegantly around them as they neared, and Harry saw the champion lining up at the entrance.
"Harry…" Hermione said numbly, still staring at him in shock.
-o-o-
As he put the excess Essence of Belladonna back on the shelf, a pale hand came up behind him and did the same. He knew it was Malfoy even before the boy muttered in his ear so quietly it could have just been an exhale of breath.
“Well, that’s comforting to hear, at least. Of course, I’m only sharing this with you because you can be particularly perceptive, especially when it comes to Mr Potter.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"One."
"It's okay…You're safe now…it's all over…" Draco repeated in a low tone over and over, hoping Harry bloody
“This course was revised by certified adults much older and cleverer than you. You will be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way —”
They stood in the manor's shadow for a while in silence, both just looking at the entrance. Draco started to the steps before he felt a tight tug on his arm.
, Draco."
They both glanced at the Head Table, where Professor Grubbly-Plank was sitting in Hagrid’s seat. Harry wondered where Hagrid had really gone and whether he was alright. Hogwarts somehow didn’t feel quite as complete without his presence.
"I hate you." He told the egg.
Draco cleared his throat, turning to leave. “Evening, Headmaster-”

“Anything is legal if the Board deems it necessary.” Dumbledore sighed, the first sign of frustration at the situation being shown. “But of course, those are just my thoughts. Best not to let them burden you too much, Mr Malfoy.”
"Sirius had a brother?" Ron asked.
Remus smirked down at him, "Hermione. Clever girl that one."
Harry sighed, rubbing a hand over his face and displacing his glasses in the process. "I…yeah, I think. I'm done yelling."
"Thanks." Ronald said, taking a sip. Immediately, he recoiled and set the cup down with a clutter. "Thoo' hot!" He cried, tongue out.
“He was
, Professor.”
"Then it was a mistake." Draco said firmly. "We move on and work around it. Forget about the Vow for just a moment and just think about how it'll help. I didn't do this for no reason or dumb little joke. It
"No way." Draco said beside him. "You?"
“The part about my mum’s new husband’s postal address.” Blaise said dully, as if it were obvious.
. Draco couldn't hide his grimace, much to Blaise's delight.
Draco gasped, "That horrid thing? I was wondering where it'd gone!" He cried.
bed! Who else would have taken it?"
Draco's ears perked up. That blasted bird? Was that where it'd gone?
"And I get what you said earlier, about the blood purity. It's the most eloquent I've ever heard you speak actually. I always thought you and Weasel communicated in grunts and hand gestures to be quire honest-"
It was Professor Snape. The vein between the dark and the light. He needed to get ahold of him somehow.
Harry nodded.
"Quite a few people -"
Potter eyed him suspiciously, "None of you business, ferret."
"What? Of course I am!" Draco protested. He quickly turned to some Third Year's nearby hovering over their books.
"Better be bloody worth the trouble." Harry heard him mutter, although he wasn't sure if Ron was talking about Hermione's situation or Harry's.
“Well...of course it is!” Lancaster sputtered, not looking too convinced himself. “It’s for safety reasons!”
"We will." Harry said quietly. "Thank you, Remus."
-" He started, but was interrupted by Harry who was feeling very proud of himself, "Only the biggest fool would go with me to the Ball, so how about it, Malfoy-"
“These are only my suspicions, but I fear there may be a connection between Harry and Lord Voldemort. Either emotional or magical. I’m not sure.”
"Fuck you, Draco! Fucking tell me next time!" Harry cried. Draco had his had grasping his stomach and was cackling in glee.
“Then distract her.” Harry suggested, “Give her reason to trust you. A good one.”
Harry shuddered, feeling unnerved. Malfoy was being especially…not prattish. He saw the boy only that one time during breakfast the morning after the Ball, so he hadn't really thought about the implications of their truce. Merlin, what was Harry thinking? He didn't think he could handle Malfoy being so…not Malfoy. The idea of Malfoy actually taking it seriously was almost absurd. He didn't think the boy knew how to tie his shoelaces without daddy's approval. It was something else entirely that he was being civil, let alone
, if you're so curi -"
"What about my father?" Draco asked, the thought only just occurring to him. "You can't possibly trust me when my father…" He looked at Snape questioningly, dread filling his chest with a whole new type of weight.
"Oh." Draco said. He looked back down at his hands, expecting to feel different at the revelation but feeling nothing but the same thrum of energy in the hand that held his wand.
"I saw around twenty already." Ronald interrupted, shooting a glare at Draco, "But there must obviously be more."
“Hand, Mr. Potter!”
"Come on, Potter." He said, a mischievous smile spreading over his face, "Let's give them a show. Dip me." Potter looked as if he was about to refuse, but seeing Draco's smile, sighed in defeat and spun him once. Throwing his arms around the Gryffindor's neck, Draco felt gravity shift as Potter dipped him backwards with a strong grip on his waist.
Harry snorted when he realised, looking up at Ron with a smile.
"Make yourself at home." Ron muttered, earning a glare from Hermione.
, and his father would realise it if wasn't so blinded by his own beliefs. The belief that magic was better, that they were better because of it. Even that those born from those without were something to be scorned rather than welcomed. Had Draco really wanted to be like him for most of his life? No, Draco
Ron, bless him, acted as if nothing was amiss and instantly uncoiled some of the tension in the air. He blew out a long breath, slumping down in his seat and saying, "Bloody nothing - and I meant that, Harry. Mum's been driving us mad, trying to get us to clean parts of the house to keep us busy."
After Draco had disappeared in to a different room of the ground floor of Grimmauld Place along with Dumbledore, the three eldest Weasley's and Snape, Harry drowned himself in some of Mrs. Weasley's homemade Treacle Tart.
It was like the feeling of rejection he'd had in First Year never really left him, and every time he saw the scar-headed idiot he'd felt the need to lash out in order to control the horrible feelings inside his chest. It didn't matter what, even if it was insulting his muggleborn friend, Granger, or his ginger side-kick from a disgraced Pureblood family, Weasley, he just needed to provoke Potter in any way. He'd resented Granger and Weasley especially, because they were nothing, and Potter had still chosen them over him. Draco had everything, yet Potter looked at him like he was nothing himself.
“I’m sure she’ll warm up to you at some point.” Draco reasoned.
“Mr. Potter…” Umbridge wrapped her pink cardigan over herself, excitement just barely peeking in the edge of her tone. “I’m not quite...sure of what you may be referring to…”
. "Er…Right. He just needs a friend-"
Harry pointed the wand at Seamus, seeing red. His hand was trembling in front of him for some reason. “If you’re so scared that I’m crazy, then I'll be crazy! Better go and ask McGonagall now to change dorms so you won’t have to sleep with one eye open because who knows what I’ll do-”
"Oh my god! My hair!" Flashbacks of Aunt Petunia giving him the worst haircut of his life as a child sent Harry in to an even more panicked state than usual. He instinctively went to grab his wand from his pockets, aiming to hex the living daylights out the Slytherin, before whirling around to see Malfoy already holding a conjured mirror out for him.
"No. I'm done for the day." He said, his voice just slightly shaky. "Where will I be staying for the next few nights?" He asked curtly. Harry's heart sunk, but he decided to leave it for now since Draco seemed inconsolable.
pretend that students must legally travel en route to the ministry in order to go on personal business, which is why snape wasn't sus ab their portkey destination.
He looked at himself in the mirror once again, and realised he was crying in the same place as First Year. It was ironic that that was where Blaise found him again, but this time Draco couldn't stop crying when he was there. He'd felt
"Like I can remember that far." Harry waved him off, but Draco could tell he knew what he was talking about. "Go have your shoddy meeting, then." He said, but his approving tone made Draco relax.
. You're a
"It wasn't until Ron saw you and Malfoy communicating in a…civilised manner that I really believed it."
, Potter, for at least three more minutes. I'm just trying to get through it alive - no thanks to you - without dying of boredom. Forgive me if I'm actually making the effort." He hissed. Potter's cheeks coloured but he considered Draco for a moment before sighing.
"Wow." Draco said deadpan, "Leaving me to the dogs, hm?"
out of a whim. It was either that, or
“Then I’d suggest you ask at the end of class if it’s not relevant-”
thank you for reading!
Harry smiled privately, looking off somewhere in deep thought about something. He looked back at Draco after a moment, "That's her 'this kid needs to eat more' face. You're on her shitlist now." And with that, he walked to the kitchen door leaving Draco where he was standing.
Harry wondered, with a sick sense of curiosity that his mind clung to, wrapping itself in the thread of thought like it were a lifeline, if Voldemort scared her. Did she fear him like everyone else? Could she ever even utter his name out loud? Could such a monstrous woman like herself be that pathetic?
he'd cast. "Fine."
He veered into the bathroom and just like the day before, threw his bag down and bent over a sink.
"Draco." His father said, tone indiscernible. He was sat behind his desk, and held out a hand to gesture permission for Draco to leave the bow and sit in the seat on the other side of his desk. It was somewhere Draco had sat his entire life, every time his father had something to lecture him about or teach. Looking back, he bitterly remembered all of their talks being some sort of anti-muggle indoctrination or some utterly boring lesson in politics and finance.
They were silent as the elevator travelled down. The speakers played a generic tune that Draco could swear he’d heard Ronald humming to himself once over the summer. Blaise cleared his throat awkwardly, and for some reason that Draco blamed as nerves, he found the urge to laugh.
"Mind if I ask why you can't sleep?" Draco said, leaning back to lounge on one elbow and pretty much facing Potter completely. Potter finished his piece of the croissant and Draco pushed another towards him. Glaring at Draco, he took it anyway.
“What?” Blaise frowned, setting his book aside. “But-”
"Me and Potter? We barely see each other. I don't see how he's affecting the Slytherins."
"After all that there's more?" Harry said, somehow dreading what Malfoy might be about to say in case it dampened whatever comfortable mood they'd created.
Malfoy scoffed, "You practically
, Draco.”
He almost betrayed his shock through his face, but managed to keep a hold on his expression. “Good morning, Professor Umbridge.” He said back.
Anger coiled in his gut at Umbridge’s words, and he could only imagine how Harry was feeling. But Draco had to keep a low cover, so he kept his expression void of emotion and kept his head down, begging Harry inside his head to just
, he thought. His heart was steady, and he curled his fingers slightly. A jolt shot through his fingers, and he immediately felt a slap in his palm of something solid. His fingers closed around it reflexively.
"Like what," said Ron, "A weapon?"
“Morning, Harry- Merlin, you look-”
“Are you angry about something?” Draco asked after a moment, “Am I being unreasonable?”
"Now I'm definitely going to be Umbridge's pet! Damn you, Dumbledore!"
The door opened a long mane of red hair appeared. "Watch out if Mum hears you say that" Said whom Draco assumed was the last Weasley, Ginevra. Draco shivered when he thought about what his father had done to her. "Oh, hello Harry!" She said, before her eyes landed on Draco. "Malfoy, as well." She said with a polite nod. Draco nodded back, reminding himself to talk to her later.  Ginevra looked back at the twins, "The Ears are a no-go."
Harry picked up one of Draco's spare parchments laying around and chucked it at him. The effect was dampened as the paper just wafted through the air and glided around Draco.
"Alright! Look. I asked him to the Ball to make himself look like a fool. I never even fathomed he would have agreed, Ron, I swear. I'm sorry about Parvati, I really am." And to hopefully calm Ron down a bit, he added, "And I'm sorry we aren't going to go with the twins together."
"Oh, definitely. It's been ages." Draco threw a glance back at Blaise's Mum, the man at her side still…sniffing her, it seemed like. He leant in to Blaise surreptitiously, eyes never leaving the scene. "Erm…Which number is this one? Sixth?"
The boy quirked his head slightly, "Did you bring these for me?"
But first, he had to get that fucking letter from Witherby.
"About a week."
“Oi.” Ron nudged him, snapping Harry back into reality where he was sitting in the Common Room nursing a cold butterbeer in his bandaged hand. Around the room, Fred and George were off to no good around a group of poor first-years and Hermione was dozing on the armchair next to him. Her unfinished bottle of Butterbeer was slipping from her loosened grasp, so he gently took it away from her and set it on the table.
Draco placed his hand over his stomach, urging it to settle. “Fine,” he breathed, taking a deep gulp. He checked his watch; it was exactly ten ‘o'clock on the dot. “We only have a few hours. What time exactly was the return Portkey?”
"Ah, that's right." Remus said, it dawning on him. "Well, what about Harry, then? Have a good summer?"
"Yeah, and my aunt's Celestina Warbeck." Ron muttered to himself, and Harry rolled his eyes. He left the potion to cool and started on his notes, trying to avoid the presence of the Slytherin behind him or the stares he felt digging in to the back of his head.
Moody walked around the square some more, almost assessing it. Measuring it. What on earth for? Draco concluded Moody wasn't supposed to be there at all, so he watched closely with his heart racing.
The table went silent at that, Ginevra looking at him skeptically. He grit his teeth.
"Yes, but it doesn't matter." Harry continued to tell him about Barty Crouch emerging out of the forest, his obscure ramblings and finally retrieving Dumbledore to find Krum stunned and Crouch gone.
" She howled, eyes popping at the sight of both Draco and Sirius. "
Harry snorted lightly. "Funny."
Hermione frowned at him, but continued, “He said that Umbridge could be on to him - through his father’s suspicious activities. I think he could be right, but is it really a priority right now?”
"I don't think I'll ever understand
"Harry, you're shivering." Malfoy's voice was like silk compared to his relative's, but it only made Harry want to cry even more.
Barely buttoning up his shirt entirely, he threw on his robes and left for the Hall, the feeling of an extra wand in his pocket seeming to burn through to his skin. His eyes felt heavy and he may have been a little less than coordinated, but at least he was bloody awake. As for keeping that up for the rest of the day, Harry didn't mind bothering to take some snacks next time he and Malfoy met.
"No, it's been lousy." said Harry.
Harry kept his head down as he tried to blend in to the crowd, although he still managed to hear the harsh whispers and looks sent his way. He glanced up as he neared the Gryffindor Table, seeing a few people duck their heads and whisper some more. Sighing, he pressed closer into Ron’s back in front of him, letting the boy’s height shield him and lead them to their seats.
"Noticing how?" Draco asked carefully.
Blaise did roughly the same thing - some lark about their families having tea -  and they were off. Being Slytherin’s, they did get a bit of leeway to come and go between the school. The general rule had always been that if Snape agreed, then all was well.
to the bloody Ministry.
"Malfoy." Harry finally said, tone flat and tight.
"Hello, Severus." Draco didn't know why he was so excited, except for seeing another face after weeks that wasn't either of his parent's.
And for the first time in months, Harry fell asleep without the thought of the Triwizard Tournament on his mind. The last thought he had before dropping off was to give Malfoy his wand back somehow before first period, which must have been around three hours away.
"Right. Sorry, Harry. We'll start from the beginning, shall we?" Hermione smiled and Ron nodded his head next to her, surprisingly calm.
"Yeah." Harry got up, stretching his tired limbs. "Talk tomorrow."
“I said the right mind!” She snapped. She then closed her eyes, taking a deep breath as if to collect herself. “Nevertheless,” she continued, her tone now softer, “You will behave from now on, and you will go to these detentions as stated. It says here she’s given you detention every evening this week, starting tomorrow.”
Harry blew out a tired exhale, slumping back against the headboard of the bed. "I do know that." He said resignedly.
Granted, Draco was fully healed as far as physical injuries went. His muscles didn't ache as much anymore and his voice had been fully healed from a sharp tasting potion Madam Pomfrey had to threaten him to take. Technically, he didn't
He passed through until he saw Parkinson and another boy - Blasé, he remembered proudly - sat alone. Harry slowed down, but couldn't stop completely in front of the window. From his passing glance, he didn't see any sign Draco was there. Bugger. He continued until the amount of students started to trickle and until he reached the empty compartments, but there was still no sign of the git.
." He repeated, voice as cold as ice.
"Right." Draco said, half-listening as he focused on a difficult point on his essay. He thought about it more for a moment before looking up at Harry quickly.
“Erm — Harry — could I borrow Hedwig so I can tell Mum and Dad? They’ll be really pleased — I mean, prefect is something they can understand —”
"Stop it!" Harry shouted, shooting out of his chair. "Ron-"
Ron did not answer. He was standing very still with his mouth slightly open, gaping at his letter from Hogwarts. Slowly, he turned it upside down and out came something gold and scarlet.
"I must go. I'll be back." He said levelly, and was marching out the door before Draco could say anything. "Stay here." He said before he left, and slammed the door shut with the telltale sound of a locking charm to follow.
years without running around the school-"
Slightly relieved at the drop in uncomfortable conversation and Umbridge’s frankly scrutinising stare, Harry settled into writing.
"Second year? Diary?" Harry prompted as if it was obvious. Malfoy just continued to stare at him curiously.
"Where in
He had a feeling this was going to be a very painful visit.
Remus glanced between the both of them, then said to Tonks, “What were you saying about Scrimgeour?”
Draco smiled tightly, glancing at Pansy who was borderline scowling at the woman. He surreptitiously tapped her with his foot to put her in check, in which she reluctantly schooled her expression into that of something more neutral.
Before Sirius's letter had arrived, Harry had never felt the need to
"Weird?"
"Are you here for the Order?" Hermione asked.
"So are we all in agreement?" Remus addressed everyone, ignoring Sirius.
"Harry?" Draco's voice came from the other side of the door.
Harry's eyes widened, and he dropped Draco's hand immediately. "Don't be an idiot." He grumbled, pushing past Draco to go in to the kitchen. Draco let him go, standing still in the hall alone for a few moments as his heart beat against his rib cage for some unknown reason.
"Draco, darling, subtlety never was your strong suit." Pansy said, sipping her tea. "Do stop staring a hole in to dear Potty's head. I'm afraid you'll find there's nothing of worth inside."
“You’ll be brilliant. Just watch out for Alicia Spinnet’s right side. She’s stronger at tossing from there.”
Hedwig seemed to narrow her eyes at his indecision, but luckily took off and swooped through the street and up in to the sky. He watched her go, the sun setting down in purple hues across the sky and hoping to Merlin he didn't just get Draco in trouble.
Blaise was grinning now, "You and the Chosen One in a truce? That's going to last around three days maximum. Did you forget that you were…well,
They sipped without conversation for a while, the lull of the sleeping house providing a comfortable silence. The bitter edge to Draco's sugarless tea pulled him to full wakefulness, and he glanced at Harry to see him with a bit more colour in his face.
Draco leaned back, nodding firmly. "I will, but I don't think he needs more people to watch him more than to just listen to what he was to say when he needs to say it. But still, I'll do my best."
"What if I told your mother you
“Was too busy getting past the blinding pink, if I’m being honest.” Draco answered solemnly. “Why do you ask?”
“Oh, yes! Quite excited to educate the minds of the youth. Especially with so much...
"Hush. It's alright. Dumbledore told me everything. You don't need to think about it right now." Draco said as gentle as he could, heart wrenching as Harry clenched his clothing and cried.
"Took an age to get him up." Draco said conversationally, noticing he was exuding far too much energy for a group of groggy people at almost six in the morning. "Were you dreaming, Harry?"
"You have to at some point." Draco said gently.
"You like it too." Harry said, the moonlight making the darkness beneath his closed eyes a dull grey colour.
Ron scowled and Harry hardened his glare back at him. For a moment they were at a standoff before Ron deflated with a sharp exhale.
-o-o-
“That you shouted at Professor Umbridge?”
A moment later, Fleur Delacour was levitated out the maze. The tightness in his chest didn't let up.
“We’re going to contact that Blane bloke ourselves, and we are going to acquire exactly what my father’s looking for. If he’s getting it, then so are we.”
-o-o-
After a moment, Harry flicked his head to the door, gesturing for them to leave. His face was darkened by shadows from the weak light on the ceiling that didn't reach where he was. Draco glanced at the other two and saw them busy arguing amongst each other, so he looked back at Harry and nodded.
"Is he going to stay?" Harry was almost bouncing up and down.
"Alright. Sorry." And after a few moments, "I had asked Cho to the Ball before…well you, I suppose."
“I’m fine.” Harry waved him off irritably.
"Answer me!" Vernon's spittle rained on Harry's face again.
Letting his knees buckle, he reached the ground and sat back until he faced the sun again on his haunches. He looked up still, but the sun had already moved place and he didn't have to avert his eyes from the sky. It was a pale blue, and a bird soared across even higher than where the trees stopped growing. He closed his eyes and let the wind cool the moisture through the thin cotton shirt he was wearing. A sense of calm settled inside of him, like the silent waters before a storm. He felt it in his chest, where there was no longer any pain anymore. Something had replaced it along the way, burning over the wound, closing it shut. It felt full. He reached a hand up to clutch his chest over the spot, and felt a heartbeat beneath his palm. His hand squeezed the fabric, initiating a long exhale from deep in his lungs. The rise and fall of his chest grounded him, proof that he was alive. Proof that he had a heart. He was alive, he had a heart, he was Draco. Not his father, and not Malfoy.
"Why would he say those things? Why attack Viktor?" Harry ran his hands roughly through his short hair.
He hadn’t really thought this through. What on earth would he say? Would it even work? A blot of ink dropped on to the page as he thought. It bled in to the parchment, and he decided sending Draco a letter really couldn't hurt him.
Summary:
, Potter." Draco hissed, suddenly reminding Harry of the bitter, spoilt boy he'd known from the years before. "You're in
Just then, Snape cried out and clutched his left arm to his chest. Draco stepped forward but Snape turned his body away from him. The man hissed through his teeth, pulling up his left sleeve but obscuring his arm from view just before Draco could see. He stood there with his back to him, breathing heavily. Slowly, Snape's head looked up from his arm.
Oh. Malfoy was there too. Damn it all to hell.
“Shut up.”
Potter, of course, choked and started babbling as Draco thought he would. It almost made him want to laugh. The boy was like
The war had begun.
if some Veritaserum were to find it's way in to your drink somehow, Mister Potter."
of the time, but he absolutely despised the fact that the man was a direct line between Hogwarts and his meddling parents. Why couldn't he left alone for Merlin's sake? Draco shuddered at the thought of his father hearing about the Potter situation. He'd have to convince Snape somehow tomorrow not to tell them.
“Cool.” Harry nodded, the both of them lapsing into silence while still staring out the window. “Is she the one that sends you all those sweets?”
Draco hesitated for a moment before coming to sit next to Harry.
, Mr. Potter,
"You can't lie to me, Potter. You're hiding something." Draco sat up and watched Harry perch unsurely next to him on the ground. He looked at the Lake nervously and obviously avoided eye contact.
"What do you mean?" Harry frowned.
“Mr Potter?” Harry heard. He had a brief recollection of that time at Grimmauld Place, just before he’d passed out. The pain had been roughly the same type, only now it was far worse.
Once inside, Harry spotted Dean and Seamus already there unpacking their trunks. They had been laughing as Harry had pushed the door open, but quieted as soon as they’d noticed him. He saw that Seamus was busy hanging up posters while Dean lounged on his bed and watched.
"It's Mrs. Lancaster, now, Lucius." Ms. Zabini boasted, holding her left arm out to flash a chunky diamond ring over a silken white glove. Draco raised an eyebrow as his father coughed over the slip-up.
"I'm sorry, Harry." Hermione whispered after a moment. "Was I really being…overbearing?"
"Oh? My apologies then." Blaise answered back, looking extremely pleased with himself. It was obvious he hadn't quite forgiven Theo for the hairclip quarrel.
under Blaise's glare.
Draco's mouth snapped open, "What - I was not
"What did you do to Harry?" She shouted at Malfoy.
"I didn't doubt that." Remus said, "And as much as I or anyone else may not like it, it could possibly have been the right choice, dangerous as it is and could be."
“-and we need to keep an eye out. If she’s suspicious it could be even better…”
"I've told you this already!" Draco said as if it was common sense, "My father took my Trace off when I turned fourteen. It's not exactly the most legal, however…"
"Fuck. He can't be here, Harry-"
"Well I don't bloody seem to be getting anything out of it, so what's the point." Harry said angrily. He spun Malfoy again, just managing to refrain from letting go of the boy and hoping he spun all the way in to a ditch somewhere.
"You waited for me?" Harry asked Malfoy's retreating figure. He didn't open his eyes to check, but rather heard the boy's footsteps halt. He stayed silent for heartbeat or two.
“Let’s not pretend I’m just Harry, right now, shall we?” Harry said lazily, “Let’s not pretend like I’m just a student who doesn’t give a lark about the Ministry. Let’s not pretend I don’t know about what’s really going on and most of all, let’s not pretend that I don't know more than I do, because I
"-weapon." Ron said at the same time as Draco, the two looking at each other in recognition for a few moments.
"Morning, Draco." Pansy said as he slid in between them, holding a cup of tea in one hand and the
"Defeat?" Draco almost laughed. "You can't expect Harry to defeat that lunatic." A cold laugh did escape him then, the idea so eccentric and so damn
"Bad that
"Erm…"
"Ow!"
"Enough, Draco." Snape barked. "Ten points from Slytherin for speaking with such obvious ill-disdain to your Headmaster."
Draco turned away before Ronald could see his smirk, and went further down the hallway where he'd seen Harry enter one of the rooms. Stepping in, Draco was hit with a wave of something between the mix of nostalgia and nausea. He paused in the doorway, crinkling his nose.
The next day, he was let out of the Hospital Wing. The entire school was due to go back home as well, so the timing was infuriatingly perfect in that he was forced to sit through the final meal in the Great Hall with everyone else before embarking that afternoon.
"Oh. Malfoy." Sirius sighed, putting away his wand. This was shocking. Was Draco not enough of a threat for him? He'd wasn't the scariest bloke in the world, but he definitely wasn't
breathe a word of it to anyone else. Got it?"
Remus smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. "And never stop. Sirius and I…"
Blood rushed in his ears, either from anger or pain. His body was covered in a cold sweat underneath his robes, but he kept writing and writing, watching his skin cut open and heal over again and again until it grew dark outside and the lamps inside the room flared to life, casting yellow shadows over the parchment and making his blood glint.
Draco figured that this must have been the ‘changes within Hogwarts’ that Dumbledore had warned him about, which is why while disgusted, he wasn't surprised.
"Er, right." Harry shuffled to the bed and sat down, scooting back so his back was against the wall. "Well, I just wanted to tell you that I'd seen your father, today. At the Ministry."
Harry started to panic. "Why wouldn't I?" Did Draco know about them?
"No, I meant…Merlin. Don't get mad for what I'm about to say, okay? It's a simple question and I mean no harm by it, but I have to ask. You know how I feel about muggles now."
"But why on earth would he agree?" She cried.
"Merlin." Was all he could say.
” Harry said loudly as the other Gryffindor’s went into pandemonium at the woman. The Slytherin’s stayed remarkably silent, but Draco could tell they were all captivated as much as he was.
"Oh." Draco said. "I didn't think I'd be here, too."
Ronald shrugged. "Dunno. Just interesting to see, I guess. Never got why he tolerated you."
“Excuse me?”
“Meaning?” Harry asked, finding that using one-word answers helped his urge to curse wean significantly.

"Define worse." Harry said, slightly irritated. "S' fine. It's gone, now."
“Oh, we’re not here for that,” Blaise assured her in the tone Draco knew was aimed to charm. “We have a meeting with Mr. Mallory Lancaster. If you could be so kind as to direct us to where he works, it would be much appreciated.” He smiled, and just in case, Draco smiled too.
-o-o-
"It's alright, Harry. We get that you're stressed out. It must be difficult."
"What?" Harry asked. "You want us to hide it from Dumbledore?"
"But you're not-"
He got his answer when Umbridge widened her eyes as big as the plates mounted on her wall. Her breathing hitched and she seemed to hold it. He let the spell maintain for a moment, burning his gaze into hers as her hand weakened in his. He kept their grip, then after another second, whispered
"What?" George cried.
. Almost tripping with the ingredients held to his chest possessively, Harry nodded curtly to him and reached his table. He begun heating up his cauldron with the alkali base and started with throwing in the crushed Occamy Shells. Ron read out the instructions to him and sliced the ingredients as he went.
“Just leave me alone,” Harry said as calmly as he could, laying down facing away from Draco in hopes that it might calm him down and stop him from possibly lashing out at the boy.
Draco scoffed humourlessly, "I'm with you there."
Draco straightened up, turning around again completely. "Pardon me?"
Draco saw Theo physically shudder at the words, and just barely managed to suppress his own shiver. Trust Blaise to use the one Bad Word in Slytherin.
Draco scoffed, "Not you, Weasley."
Sirius was cut off by a loud "OOF!" as Remus elbowed him the stomach.
He could almost hear the drone of the boy's voice in his head, and he nodded and shot another smile before leaving as the Champion's were called up. He hadn't seen Ron or Hermione this whole time. Were they not worried at all? He hoped they could see him from the stands.
"I'm not sure. I just needed you to believe that I was committed to the truce thing. And so far, you're the only one who could remotely understand what's going on, if you get what I mean?"
"Against his own son?"
"You didn't sleep at all?"
"-Child marriage!" He and Hermione said together.
"Can't we just skip? The sun's practically already up!" Harry whined, fatigue hitting him all at once.
"It was fine." Draco said, then when his father said nothing he cleared his throat and said quickly, "Except for that Triwizard Tournament, father. It really was dreadful."
"Hedwig?" He asked the owl excitedly, and it only hooted in response. He stepped back to let her fly in, and watched as she flew in an arc around his room to settle on the back of a chair.
, and he had double Divination in a few hours. Harry groaned. At least he didn't have Potions.
Malfoy grew a wry smile over his face, staring off somewhere in to the horizon. The act threw Harry off balance for a moment, and put him back over that same bone-chillingly icy Lake as during the Yule Ball.  He shook himself out of it quickly, an involuntary shudder running through him. Luckily, Malfoy didn't seem to notice.
“How do you remember stuff like that?” asked Ron, looking at her in admiration.
“Hermione Granger.”
Harry promptly bullshitted all of his homework assignments due for that day that morning, which was easy since it was mostly dream-journaling for Divination. There was still an essay on moonstones for Snape due the next day, along with something for McGonagall that he couldn’t remember, but it was all enough to get him through the day at least.
-o-o-
"We should get changed now." Ron said, looking at the clock. They had one hour until Harry had to line up for the opening dance. "Merlin help us."
“But if it’s not even healing over anymore-”
"I don't want to kill anybody-" Malfoy starts.
It still didn’t take away from the fact that the wounds had been open long enough to cause permanent scarring that wouldn’t have normally happened with the nature of how they were acquired. Harry guessed that such punishments weren’t meant to be drawn out as long as his were, resulting in each individual letter on the back of his hand to be a piece of pink, raised flesh. It stood out particularly against his skin, both in colour and depth. There was no doubt that it’d be incredibly hard to hide, which made things significantly more difficult for him because of two people: Hermione and Draco.
, Pansy." Draco said, irritated.
"It was long again." Draco stated, as if it was the simplest thing in the world. He deftly swished his wand and the hair on the ground vanished.
"Bollocks." Malfoy breathed out in relief, "I thought she might hit me again." Harry scowled at him and muttered a badly muffled, "
friend.
"Then that means he wants them here." Remus said. "Could he be feeding them false information?"
"Wouldn't have been the same without you." Ronald sidled up, clapping Harry on the back and jostling the both of them in the process. "Draco here was in knots the whole day."
much.
He scanned over the students’ heads to the staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall, realising that the absence of Hagrid’s usual greeting outside the Hogwarts Express had carried into the castle.
Draco worked on cleaning the house in silence the rest of the day, pensive and high-strung as the hours ticked by and Harry had yet to return. He knew that court hearings weren't the shortest engagements, but it didn't chip away at his impatience and apprehension any easier.
Harry stayed silent, letting it sink in.
“What you must remember,” said Professor Flitwick squeakily that morning during Charms, perched as ever on a pile of books so that he could see over the top of his desk, “is that these examinations may influence your futures for many years to come! If you have not already given serious thought to your careers, now is the time to do so!”
“Oh, what? So everyone can have a go at me but I can't ever do the same?”
Harry felt the blush blooming on his cheeks. They were probably referring to the time while Harry'd been researching for something to keep him alive underwater, and one morning caught Draco's eyes looking between him and the egg inquiringly.
"Oh…right. I didn't know you and Mr. Malfoy were…
Taking another step, he found it was coming from one of the rooms. He took one step forwards before his brain registered the twinge of familiarity in the voice. His heart jumping, he immediately raced towards the sound and threw open the door. He stood in the doorway, chest heaving, before he was hit with the sound of loud shouting coming from a person stood inside the room.
"What?" Harry hissed.
"No, Potter. Listen to me. We're both in very sensitive positions at the moment. With the rising of the Dark Lord, I'll be able to collect information from the inside from my father - undetected, of course. In return, you'll give me any developments about your side and what they know. We'll be able to compare and share knowledge. This way I can be informed of what my father doesn't tell me and won't be blindsided by the Dark Lord."
"So don't expect to come in here and act like you're one of us, because you're
He didn’t have time to ponder too much about Harry. His first priority was that letter and he had a vague idea how to get it.
"I don't believe you." Ron said, a hysterical laugh bursting out of him. "Good one, Harry!"
“Of course.” Draco bit out monotonously, his mind running in so many different directions that he felt the conversation in front of him slipping to the back. “He’d be his own spy.”
Draco snorted, "I'll tell you everything tomorrow. It was rather funny."
It was nice. That's all he could think. The letter was really, really nice. It was the most personal thing that had been said to him in a while. Hermione always was a bit robotic in her responses, and Ron was…Ron in his letters. Draco's letter was almost like he was sitting right next to him and having a conversation. Harry could almost hear the words as if spoken aloud by him.
His father leaned back in his chair, face thoughtful. "Yes, that was a shame." Draco suppressed a shudder at his father's malevolent expression. "But that boy's luck will run out soon enough."
you in that Cloak of yours-"
"You think they don't trust the people from the Ministry? The Weasley's are the exception, of course."
"Yeah." Harry looked away. "Not lying."
“He can’t have left,” said Ron, sounding slightly anxious.
Malfoy resettled on the spot he'd been sitting on, his body now facing Harry's completely. "From now on we need to tell each other everything we know. About the Dark Lord and the war, that is. I feel like with our standpoints, we could both learn a lot from each other."
In the centre of the room, not even a few feet from the elevator doors was a single mahogany wooden desk that looked to be literally on its last leg. Behind it, Draco spotted someone hunched over the desk, scribbling down something on some paper.
Umbridge reached into a drawer in her desk and pulled out a small roll of pink parchment. Silently, she dipped her quill into some ink (he’d instinctively expected it to be pink as well, but it seemed not) and started to scribble on the parchment.
Harry leant in even further, the room becoming still around them. He uttered lowly, feeling the words roll off his tongue similar to if he were speaking Parseltongue, “I also disappeared on the night of June the 24th along with Cedric Diggory, wherein upon return his heart had already stopped beating.”
Pansy flushed immediately and looked down angrily, and Blaise whistled next to him.
"Go right ahead." Draco said obligingly,  You'll never understand our bond."
“Don’t...touch me!” Harry finally managed to bite out, clutching at his forehead painfully. The pain seemed to ebb from the point of his scar all throughout his body as if it were being pumped through his blood like a shot of adrenaline.
"No, mum." Dudley said, his voice slightly firmer. "It was him. He made that…
Harry shook his head. "Maybe I'm just stupid." He said. "But for some reason, I knew he wouldn't. He could have easily turned against me at any time, now that I think about it."
"Boring?" Harry asked.
Quidditch practise went swimmingly for Draco and the other Slytherins that afternoon, and they were indeed packed and off the pitch by the time Harry, Ron and the rest of his Gryffindors arrived for their practice.
thank you for reading :)
"N…Nothing bad will happen!" choked out George. "Merlin…wish I had a…a camera!"
"Potter! Weasley! Potion
"That man is no lord of mine." Draco breathed.
"I don't
"Hey girl." He said, coming closer and reaching a hand out to stroke her. She allowed it for a second before nipping his fingers irritably. "Right." He grumbled after an embarrassing yelp, "Treat."
"Here and there. You know how it is for him." Sirius's tone became a bit grave, but he chirped up after a moment. "Haven't seen him since the night I escaped on Buckbeak!"
"You have something to say?" Harry finished for him, surmising so from the way Draco struggled to say anything at all.
"Yeah." Harry said, "Thanks, mate. Hopefully they let me go back to Hogwarts. What do you think'll happen if they don't?"
Malfoy pressed his temple's as if he had a headache. Harry thought it was ironic when
“Well, like you also said earlier, we can’t afford to act on assumptions.”
"Not care about him this much."
." Draco tugged on his sleeve.
"Better to just give in." George added beside his brother.
He expected Harry to at least be a little happy to see him - even a greeting in return would’ve been appreciated - but the boy’s eyes only widened comically when they saw him.
Draco readjusted his position, turning to sit fully facing Harry with a tentative look on his face. Harry leant back, slightly taken aback by the other boy’s shift in resolve. Before this, he’d been resigned and worried, but now the air coming from him was determined and sure of himself.
"And maybe they suspect someone in the Order who works in the Ministry." She agreed, "But why Draco specifically? What could he do that a Ministry member could use?"
"Draco?" Snape sounded slightly worried now. It must have been something on Draco's face, or the shaky hands gripping his Godfather's arms, or the way he was looking at Dumbledore as if the man might disappear before his eyes.
"Who said this has
Harry smiled and let go of his hand. Malfoy grimaced at his dirt patched robes and begun patting them down irritably.
Sirius's face fell and he almost looked
"-Calling them
He lowered himself in to his chair as gently as he could, his heart feeling entirely out of place in the room as it hammered violently in his chest. The atmosphere was like glass, tense and very carefully controlled between breaking on the crux of a narrow point. The seat was cold under him, and it felt smaller than before. Maybe he really had grown over the year.
A pathetic voice in his head cheered on. He promptly ignored it and vowed to do so as long as it existed. Was this sleep deprivation? He really should go to sleep on time for once.
"IT WAS ME WHO SAW HIM! ME WHO FOUGHT HIM! I'M THE ONE WHO'S BLOOD HE TOOK. I HAVE THE SCARS. HE'S HERE BECAUSE OF ME!"
At least none of them spoke to him. None of them except Dudley. He would sometimes stop on his way down the hall and taunt Harry through the door, but that was it. On odd days, though, he's spend it out in the house doing work or in the garden wandering aimlessly. Sometimes he just forgot he
." Draco went on. "
Remus had once expressed his fears about Harry and his friends going down the same path as he did with the marauders. It didn’t seem relevant at the time, which was truly naive of Harry. He now understood that he’d already been on that path all this time and how hard it would be if he wanted to get off of it. At this point, there really was no going back.
carefully.
Ron gasped, "They didn't!"
-o-o-
"What if they don't let me go back?" Harry whispered.
He crept in to the Hospital Wing slowly, pleased to find there were no teachers or Madam Pomfrey present. He saw Harry's bed, curtained off and the black dog sitting on the outside. It immediately perked it's head when Draco stepped in, and he cursed internally.
It is
Harry drew back, an almost painful looking grin on his face, "It worked!"
"So as I said earlier, anyone gives you grief about him or anything else, I'll set them straight, alright?"
The whistle of the train sounded, signaling five minutes before departure. Draco looked to his parents, the two saying their goodbyes to the other families. They approached and greeted Blaise.
(thank you for reading! <3)
They walked in silence to the Apparition point, bustling children and their families loud in greeting with each other passing them by. For the first time in his life, it became difficult to ignore all of them as he walked stiffly next to his mother. He flitted his eyes as much as he dared, even spotting a mass of ginger he knew belonged to the Weasley's.
“Bloody hell, get dressed, Harry.” Ron hissed, picking up Harry’s uniform shirt and throwing it at him. “I need to eat well today. Merlin, I might throw up, though…”
Malfoy's face crumpled, and Harry almost wanted to take back the question completely. Malfoy, however, answered anyways, "I didn't see anything. My father disapparated me and my mother as soon as the Mark went up, so it couldn't have been him."
“Need I ask?” Blaise asked at Draco’s evident display of affliction. It wasn’t the first time Blaise had been witness to one of his obsession-induced slumps (which Pansy just called
Harry frowned, "What about me?"
He cringed internally, hoping the woman wouldn’t pay his vague statement any mind. To his surprise, however, she only looked more pleased.
pretty?"
Draco laughed, "Yeah, I figured that." And seeing Harry's face said, "You wouldn't notice if you weren't looking really hard, so it's not because you're that incompetent."
"Just answer her, mate." Ronald sighed exasperatedly. Draco ignored him too.
it was the right choice. You took this step, make sure to follow through."
, Potter." Draco glared at him. "But essentially, yes. Say you were the Secret-Keeper for me. You would keep my secret, and only be able to divulge it to whomever you want
“Alright, fine. Let’s just take it easy, yeah?” Ron said placatingly. Harry realised he was still panting from the exertion of the run here as well as the talking. “Let’s just do your hand up, then we’ll see what we can do.”
"I can't make it definite, whose side I'm on, Potter." Malfoy snapped, then immediately softened and continued in a calmer tone,  "I will always fight for what you're fighting for, but I still have my mother to think about. She won't leave my father easily, and I won't leave her if he comes back. I need to be there for her, even if it means living on their side."
... was bound to reach people like him. People who…”
"Harry! Come over here and talk some
"You really are terrible company." Draco said again, and was unsurprisingly met with still silence.
"-Harry!" Ron yelled, causing Harry to jump in his chair.
“I hate it. Everyone’s looking at me all the time.”
"Potter! Bloody finally you showed up!" Malfoy called out impatiently from the back of the line, and Harry winced. Ron quickly made his way to Padma inside with a muttered wish of luck, and Malfoy sneered at him as he passed.
text.
A moment later, he felt a blanket of warmth encompass him, and he hadn't realised that he'd felt so cold until he was surrounded by it. He realised that Malfoy had his wand out and had probably cast a warming charm on him. He looked at the boy gratefully, vision still blurry despite his glasses sitting crookedly on his nose.
"That doesn't give you the right go looking down on others for not having that! Calling muggle-borns
It seemed no matter what he did, he might die.
"Talk."
Draco just sighed, waving the wand movement lazily with his finger through the air once. “
deserved, the man was a loon for the Dark Lord. His wife never recovered after her son left either, and she kicked it not long after Barty did while he was in Azkaban. She went mad before that, though, so he technically lost them both at once."
Draco wanted to melt into his seat. Why had she made him come inside with Harry? He was just sitting there, for Merlin’s sake.
"So that's why he did it, then?" She asked, understanding dawning in her eyes. "Do you think he fears he could mess things up?"
"No, Malfoy. I need to hear you say it. That you're on
"Can you bring me some?" Ronald called after him as he walked to the door.
Before he knew it, Draco was opening his sleepy eyes to a dark room only dimly lit by the first blue breaks of dawn outside. He pushed his head up to look down his body and see he'd fallen asleep in his clothes from yesterday. Great. He'd wrinkled one his nice shirts.
"There. Just have a few pieces. It's alright with me, really. I'm full from this." He said surely, holding up his apple then taking another bite. He watched Potter nervously stare at him in shock for a few seconds then look at the food again. Thankfully this time, one of his hands unwrapped from around his knees and reached towards the food hesitantly. Draco held his breath as Potter seemed to contemplate the action thoroughly, then breathed it out in relief when the boy reluctantly picked up a small piece of the croissant. Without a word, he turned back to the sun and munched quietly on it, taking small bites as if he was savoring it.
"Harry?" Draco's face was shrouded in harsh shadows and worry. "What's wrong?"
“I see.”
"I- No, you can't send me letters." Draco said quietly, looking down.
"Alone!" Pansy reminded him, hands braced on her hips threateningly.
." Harry bit out, "That's how it's going to be from now on. He will without a second of hesitation, with a bit of doubt,
"Harry!" Called out Hermione from where her and Ronald were sat. The two were getting up from their chairs and readying to leave the room. "After you and Draco are done, go upstairs one floor above where the bedrooms are so we can start."
“Yeah.” Harry said, smiling weakly. “Long day.”
"…Harry?" Ron's voice jolted him out of daydream and he looked at the boy irritably. He hadn't even done anything wrong. He was just…there. Existing with no Golden Egg or Merpeople fantasies.
"Likes of him…Professor?"
becoming his mother. Bringing the napkin of food to him, he took one of the croissants and started to break it in to smaller pieces as Potter watched on curiously. Once satisfied when the whole croissant was in small bits, he pushed the napkin back in to the middle between them.
"Even
Harry took off his glasses to rub a hand over his face. “Let me get this straight,” he said, “you want us to go after the weapon ourselves? Isn’t that a little...brash? And that’s coming from
if she found out."
Draco finally took in his surroundings, crinkling his nose like there was a bad smell. "Merlin, where are we?" He whispered.
." He said disgustedly.
family members. He always did prefer the Black side.
" Draco said sharply, rising off the chair. "Let's go to bed." He beckoned Blaise up and waited for the boy before walking to their dormitory together in silence.
“Will I still have to come in tomorrow?” he asked innocently.
, like she was to bloody talk).
“Ten seconds…” Blaise muttered. He’d cleaned up nicely for the journey, decked out in an all-black, formal suit and matching black leather brogues. He had his gold earrings in to match the gold cufflinks on his sleeves, which Draco hadn’t seen him wear for a while.
Draco glanced behind the man to the kitchen, where he had already said his goodbyes to the Order and received a crushing embrace from Molly. Even Hermione and Ronald had shaken his hand goodbye.
Harry almost punched him. "He's not yours! He's his own squid!"
"I will." A third wire joined the first two. Their hands were almost completely encased in the writhing magic, and the red light danced off of Draco's pale complexion. His grey eyes seemed to absorb the colour, giving him an uncomfortable likeness to Voldemort that made Harry want to run away immediately at that moment. He only gripped Draco's hand tighter, knowing how important it was at that moment that they carried out this bond. He paused for a moment as the magic buzzed around them and lit up the dark room. The thrum in Draco's hand felt like an anchor, his mind feeling clearer than it'd been in days. It was supposed to be over; Harry had said all the vows discussed, but the air of anticipation around him made Draco and Sirius hesitate too, watching him. He gave himself no time to think about it before he begun to add a fourth and final clause on the spot.
Draco sighed exasperatedly and glanced at Blaise, deciding it would be more painful to keep everything a secret from the witch anyway. He told Pansy everything he had said to Blaise, leaving out the parts about his father and the possible war in the future. He pretended not to feel Blaise's stare on the other side of his face as he faced Pansy.
Harry remembered the day before when he’d lashed out at Seamus. Even Hermione had reminded him a few times that day to stop snapping at her and Ron for small things. He curled further in on his side, not saying anything back.
“What?” Harry asked, confused.
"I could do something to maybe help you, though." Malfoy said, almost making Harry a bit scared at the boy's entailing tone.
"Why?" Potter asked, looking at him curiously again.
"Hence the tea." Harry gestured.
"Professor Snape." Draco acknowledged. Snape swatted his robes with disgust and looked down at Draco through his nose.
"I thought you weren't going with anyone. You didn't say anything when I asked."
“Alright?” Blaise asked him, looking non-surplussed and irritatingly unaffected by the journey.
"H…Him…" Dudley stuttered out, refocusing Uncle Vernon's raging gaze on Harry.
, he thought. Something in his stomach churned...nausea filled him as the image in his mind didn’t go away even though his eyes were back to their original colour. The image of those eyes. Those red eyes...staring back at him…
The next morning, Harry woke up with several thoughts and questions flying around his head.
"And me?" Draco sked, genuinely interested in what Potter had to say about it. The boy ran a hand through his hair which was in need of another haircut.
"Sir, what is thi-"
Draco sighed forlornly as he waved his wand over the ink. “As powerful as I am, some things are impossible, Pans.”
“And now that I've got to see such admirable leadership, setting an example for the younger years, I'm becoming more and more glad that I joined to teach.” Umbridge picked up a flower-painted porcelain teacup that was sitting on her desk, blowing on it lightly and taking a sip. It was the only sound in the room as she paused speaking. Clearing her throat again with that pathetic, “
After a moment, she finally smiled, eyes glinting, “Why, I’m glad we’re seeing a change already! Get that temper down and you’ll be good as new, Mr. Potter. Don’t think this is going to get you to miss Friday’s appointment, however.” She tittered to herself briefly, seemingly finding what she said extremely funny.
“My hunches are nearly never wrong, my boy.”
"I'm well, Professor." Harry said.
” She hissed murderously, and Ron and Harry straightened up for the rest of the lesson.
But Merlin, he wanted to.
“There’s no such thing for Quidditch.” Harry said seriously, but Ron laughed anyway.
Draco glanced at him curiously. “Yeah...You notice that?”
"Well seeing as it's what stopped him last time," Ron spoke, "I'd say he'd try to get rid of Harry, too."
"Potter, are you alright?" Potter's eyes finally flicked to his, the green irises and red whites making him look feral and so unlike the usual person he saw. Draco felt the urge to ask what was wrong one more time when Potter smiled weakly and shook his head.
“Bloody fat good you are, then.” Ron complained, but was subdued by a sharp look from Hermione.
"Nothing, Hermione. I'm alright. He just…he cut my hair." He said slowly. Both his friends eyes flicked to his head and he suppressed the urge to pull his hood up.
Draco thought it was dumb, but of course his opinion didn't matter.
Was he still just like his father, though? Draco sometimes wondered so as he laid in bed at night, body still too full of adrenalin from training to even sleep. He'd done terrible things before-
"Well I had help for most of it, you know? The first task I had Hagrid showing me the dragons, then Cedric and you for the second task. Even Moody's offered to help."
, Potter. It doesn't matter how bad you feel, is it really fair to treat them like that?"
Draco smirked, arms crossed over his chest nonchalantly. "Whatever you say, Professor."
“But- I didn’t get to apologise-”
"That spell you just used as well," His father tapped his fingers on his lips as he thought, "You didn't learn that?'
Looking away sourly, Draco glanced back again to where Harry was. He seemed to be acting well enough, so maybe Umbridge was acting out on her own volition. Still, something snagged in his mind at the fact that he had detention with her the past two nights and now she was acting weird around him - if Pansy’s claims were even true, that is. Not to mention that it was Harry, and if there was trouble happening then he was most certainly involved. Draco sighed and looked away from him.
Draco gasped sharply and Sirius stiffened beside them.
"George! Fred!" Molly barked from where she was holding out a bag for the rest to drop incapacitated Doxies in to, "Get to work!"
Draco stilled, cocking his head to the side.  "I…But why?"
And it took a moment for Harry to realise that it wasn't his own voice in his head saying those things. It was an amalgamation of his Aunt Petunia's and Uncle Vernon's, so clear he would have thought they were next to him. Coarse voices sifting through the slits of a cramped cupboard under the stairs.
Remus rubbed his face with a loud, exasperated sigh. "Draco." He said, voice calm again. Draco looked up to them with a hardened look on his face. "Come sit. You both need to hear something, alright?"
“Yeah, yeah.” Harry grumbled. “Now what’s it say.”
"Ms. Zabini." Draco's father smoothly greeted a sharply dressed woman as they approached. Next to her, a man much shorter than her was stuck to her side, almost nose deep in nuzzling her exposed chest area as if it were the most lovely thing in the world. If Draco didn't know better, he would have been certain the man was under a love potion.
Ron nodded, "We were at breakfast, and you were gripping that bloody egg again like your life depended on it-" He stopped when Harry glared at him and he flushed. "Oh, er. Sorry. Right, well, you were holding that egg, and you weren't eating. You were kind of staring off in to space but then I saw you were mouthing something at someone. I didn't actually believe it was Malfoy at first, but he was looking right at you. And not in a bad, snobby sneer kind of way."
"Ravenclaw seeker?" Draco said peering at her.
Harry said nothing, only responding with a harsh kick in the shin under the table.
be shared with the public?”
Malfoy was now staring at him curiously, and Harry continued, "Tell me, Malfoy,
"Hey." Draco said.
. It was all his fault! Stupid Potter with his stupid Tournament, making them have this stupid Ball and being one of the stupid bloody champions. Why did he have to be so bloody flashy! Every fucking year! Deep down Draco knew Potter didn't want the attention, but the fact that he got it
“Finite.”
“Oh- sorry, Harry. Didn’t see you there…” Seamus rubbed the back of his neck, no hostility on him anywhere unlike the day before. Harry just smiled tightly, about to nod and leave when Seamus stopped him with a hand. “Wait! Before you go…”
Harry retracted his hand and started walking backwards, still facing Seamus. “Don’t worry about it! We’re cool!” Harry waved quickly and turned away, leaving Seamus behind with his mouth still open. He hurried down the corridor until all the students by the Entrance were gone, then backtracked and slipped out the doors.
Then somebody behind him
"Take your time, mate. No breakfast until you spill."
"Er…Take this to Draco Malfoy at his Manor?"
