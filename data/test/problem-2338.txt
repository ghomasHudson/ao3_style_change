“You'll have questions.”  Harry said, taking the remote and the note from Draco and setting them down so the other man would pay attention to him.  “I'll be coming back every other day or so until you really are well and fully settled.  No matter WHAT, don't talk to the Aurors.  Don't ask them questions.  Wait until I come back and I'll answer everything for you.”
Thanks so much for all the comments on the last chapter!  I'm sorry I'm not answering everyone individually.  I'm a shy dork... this is easier.
"Perfect."  Harry said after what seemed like ages, but had only been a few seconds.  "I have Quidditch practice tonight, we could meet tomorrow?"
“You started to turn that around in Sixth Year..”  Draco said, knowing he was treading on dangerous ground to talk about...  But he was feeling particularly self destructive right then so he just threw caution into the wind.  “Someone mentioned you got a new wand.”
"I have it started, it won't be too bad."  Draco said, but then hesitated, looking forward again, swinging his legs a little bit.  "But if you want to help we can meet at the library or something."
He was nearly sure he was going to have to turn around when he finally came to the window full of screens.  He stood for a few minutes just looking at them again, now with a slightly better idea of everything he was looking at.  Phones in the front, tablets and iPads behind them and laptops behind them.
"Thanks so much."  Draco said with a bit of his usual sharpness, but he smiled slightly at the same time, picking up the mug and leaning forward over it, resting it in his hands on his knees.  "I know it's true though."
Madam Pince had already been by their table three times, lingering with sharp, probing looks at them for daring to be having fun in her silent library.  Harry figured the next time would be the last and he wasn't ready to leave just yet.
“To try and help you settle in more.  Answer questions you have.  But you're far beyond where any one else is who we've put into hiding.  I spent most of yesterday with someone who could not comprehend using the light switches.”
Draco didn't answer verbally, but he did reach up and pull Harry's head in, determined this time to kiss him first and not get caught off guard like the last two times.  Harry groaned as their mouths crushed together, their kisses hard and deep.  They had kissed like this before, somewhere caught between fighting each other and wanting so much that it was practically violent.
"Close.  Tap twice on the spot first, then say the incantation and flick your wand up."  She demonstrated again, then smiled when Harry mimicked her exactly.  "Perfect.  Then the next part is
Snape did step back then, his eyes flicking as they searched Draco's for any sort of weakness, finding none he seemed to try a different approach.  "I only intend to keep my promise to your mother.  She came to ME, seeking me out to make the unbreakable vow to help you."
"Nope."  Harry shook his head, looking away from Draco as anger etched in lines over his face.  "Mr and Mrs Weasley keep trying to shield me from everything.  Like THAT will help me?  Please...  Sirius used to tell me things a little straighter, but he was super biased and didn't have a ton of information since he'd been in Azkaban for so long.  And Dumbledore.  He
“Right.”  Harry said, nodding and smiling just a bit.  “I have to go, time to check in with the next person in hiding.”  Harry paused, considering for a moment and then dropped his voice as though he was trying to keep someone else in Draco's flat from hearing him.  “Are you still friends with Millicent Bulstrode and Blaise Zabini?”
"So does she know?  Or did you just let her think what she wanted about you and..." Harry trailed off, waving his hand a bit.
Which he did, and was quite smug about it as he and Harry left the restaurant.  There had been nothing to it, it was the same as any Wizard restaurant, just with different money.  And the money wasn't HARD once it was explained to you.  He didn't understand why Harry thought he needed so much leading around.
Hermione had gotten the same treatment, but had taken it even harder than Ron had, retreating tearfully to the girls dorm without another word after asking Harry how he could have not known it was missing before now.  Harry's reply had been two steps beyond unkind.
Ron bought it, Harry could tell as his friend nodded, a deep line between his eyebrows, signalling a deep thought process.  But Hermione...  Hermione had that careful and probing look on her face that made it clear she was also thinking.  And far more clearly than Ron was.
"Why?"  Harry couldn't keep the small note of hatred from his voice, he had no desire to do anything or communicate with Snape again.  Having to go to him once was more than enough.
“Alright, so what first...”  Draco said with a sigh, running a hand through his hair as he looked wearily at the food on the counter.  “Bread, eggs, bacon and... chicken?”  He looked at Neville questioningly at the last one.
“Well you thought it looked like fun..”  Draco said, the dark nasty smirk playing across his features.  “Give it a go and see while you tell me about this memory.”
"I said we can't keep doing this.  You said it was nuts.  Those were ALSO things that got said."  Draco muttered, but his eyes moved from the other boy's shoulder to his face.  Harry was so close to him now, their bare skin only inches apart.
“I want one...”  He said, looking back at the window again.  “I haven't a clue what I'd do with one, but I want one.”
"No...  Well, I mean yes... But that's not what I was thinking."  Harry said, one hand still closed in the side of Draco's velvety dress robes.
He knew Harry was talking, but the sound of his voice was very distant in his brain.  Foggy and far away and totally removed from the way his world was narrowing at the corners.  His vision darkened at the edges, sharpened in the center.  He was both hyper aware of everything and aware of nothing at the same time.
“... Fine.  But just a short one.”  Draco frowned as he spoke, giving Neville a sour look even as the other man smiled at him gratefully.  “I need to change first.” He said,  getting up from the counter stool to go back to his bedroom without waiting for Neville to say anything.
Harry watched him for a few moments, then seemed to forcibly put softness into his eyes and smile at the blonde even though there was concern and question still written behind every feature.  “No matter.  Whatever it was, you seem fine now.  Are you fine?”
He let out a long low breath as Noel walked away, getting the eggs out of his batter and just throwing them away.  It was a waste but he didn't want to actually touch them.  He fumbled a bit cracking the next eggs but they all got into the batter alright.
"You ASSHOLE!'  Draco screamed at the other boy when he realized who it was.  He smacked both hands on Harry's chest, roughly pushing him backwards.
And then Draco grabbed his books and ran.  He didn't know WHAT that was, he didn't know how that had happened.  What spell Harry had put on him, what trickery was behind it.  He was half convinced by the time he got to the Dungeons, out of breath and dizzy, that somehow that had been a test of Voldemort's that he'd failed spectacularly.
"No.  Not socks.  What's IN the socks."  He unfolded the socks and produced a tiny bottle.  A very tiny bottle full of scintillatingly gold liquid.
"What exactly are our options?"  Draco asked, stepping a little closer to the other boy as Harry's hand drifted away from his arm.
“Fit of some kind.”  Draco interrupted, waving a hand dismissively as he got up and sat down on the edge of the couch again.  “My blood sugar must be low or something, I didn't have dinner or breakfast.”
“Not particularly.  I'd rather we had a chance to talk about everything.  Last night was...”  He trailed off, his brow furrowing a bit as he tried and failed to search for the right words.
”Sorry.  I know that’s the truth but...” Harry raised his head again, folding his arms on the desk as he looked at Draco for a long few moments.  “That’s a lot to lay on a child who has to sit in class with me.  Telling him that this man right here is the only reason that you’re still alive? Which isn’t exactly true..”
“But why were you asking about that?”  Harry scooted his chair closer to the table, leaning across it to try and open the book Hermione had closed over her arm.
It took every ounce of strength Draco had not to roll his eyes at Paul as he seemed to relish taking the knife to cut down through the layers of his cake, immediately undoing the perfect work he'd done.
He wanted to scream, he wanted to cry.  He wanted to laugh and smile and bang his head on the desk.  And also he kind of wanted to apparate as far away from everything in his life as he possibly could and just BREATHE for awhile.
But at one window, Draco did fully stop and stare.  It was a window full of screens like televisions, but not all of them were televisions like his.  They were all different, and all doing different things.  There were even small rectangular things like televisions on stands, with signs above them shaped like arrows that pointed at them.
“No he had other memories to show me, but told me they were as far as we could go until I got Slughorn's real memory.”
Harry's brain took a few seconds to catch up, trying to make sense of what Draco was saying in reference to the Daily Prophet article before he realized he was talking about what he heard in the bathroom.
"In the flowerbed...  Why?"  Draco shook his head, shifting a bit to settle more comfortably in the arm chair.
What would happen when 'The Chosen One" decided he liked the idea of a Wizarding World, if not an entire world, under the power of Voldemort?
Draco smiled and nodded slightly, resting his wand against his chest, keeping his eyes on the stars above him.  He was still getting used to this new Harry.  The one that listened to him and gave him the same consideration he gave his actual friends.  The one that sat with him and let him cry and scream or sit in silence for hours and never questioned it.  "What do you think I should do?"
What they were doing was sitting in the back of the library writing the 'bad essay' that would be handed in to Snape by Draco.  They had finished the good essay for Harry quite quickly and as neither of them made any moves towards wanting to leave, they decided to write the bad one together as well.
Just as it had been the first time Tom joined him in a dream, he seemed consciously aware of himself asleep before falling deeper within his mind.
"Alright, Potter.  You've made your views quite clear.  Believe it or not, I do want to help Draco and if I am willing to help him with his task from Voldemort then I am willing to help find a means of communication with his mother."
"Kind of."  Draco agreed, raising his head so he could see the other man, sighing out a short breath.  "Look...  I don't want to not see you just because of my mother."
He left the day his parents stood trial.  He waited, loitering in Diagon Alley with his sack full of treasure and suitcase full of the most normal items he owned, until the whispers started and he heard for certain that both of his parents were sentenced to life in Azkaban.
“It's fine.”  Harry said, waving a hand and passing it off as he opened the door.  He looked back at Draco once more, staring at him for a long moment before he spoke again.  “Are you sure you're okay?  No other questions you have before I go?”
Harry got up, going over to the cabinet and opening the door to look inside, peering all around it deep in thought before he made a disgusted noise.
Draco and Harry have one of the most convoluted, complicated, intricate and serpentine of relationships. It went on during school, it carried on after school. It stopped. And now it seems it’s starting again.
But he didn't speak.  He didn't start pointing to things or explaining things or teaching him things.  He just let him look and then they carried on to the next window.
More people, two of them, at his bench.  Smiling at him. The fucking judges, Prue and Paul, right there in front of him.  He turned on his smile again, trying to look charming and a bit harried.
Watching as the owl fluttered out of the window, he sighed.  He knew his letter was odd and curt and was drawing a line at the end of this correspondence so Harry didn't have to write back.  He'd already, purely by accident, taken too much of his time with those letters.
"I wanted to finish sometime tonight and you weren't going to run out of steam quickly.  Too distracting to work."  Harry said, then smiled and tilted his head a bit.  "And because Hermione told me what to do before I came up here so I didn't feel like it was fair that I knew the trick and you didn't."
Draco looked down, frowning a bit.  He could sort of see Harry's reasoning but at the same time, it was pretty flawed.  But everything was pretty flawed right now.  Everything in the world was fractured, everyone was reacting and acting based on everything from the strongest convictions to the most flawed judgement.   He, himself, had accidentally cursed Katie Bell and almost killed Ron Weasley because he was just trying to do what he felt he needed to.  Poor judgement, not thinking ahead, just reaction.
He turned slowly to take it all in, then made a low noise as he looked up to the glass ceiling that filtered in green light from the lake above them.  Everything in the Slytherin Common Room was a little darker, dimmer and yet somehow seemed to lend itself so much more to private conversations.
"Dementors right in your Muggle neighbourhood?" Draco asked, then let out a low breath as Harry nodded.
Harry unrolled the scroll, seeing first the name at the bottom, then read the rest of it.  Only then remembering they were getting a new professor that year.  The events leading up to him being at The Burrow, or even the events before they went to Diagon Alley seemed ages ago and not that important.
"So.. What is all this?"  He asked, sitting down in the chair he'd unceremoniously fallen out of, rubbing one of his wrists where it had hit the floor.
Harry shook his head again, wrinkling his nose a bit.  "Not especially.  I'm tired of the conversations there.  Tired of the people."  He raised his shoulders in a small shrug.  "Hey, I was surprised you weren't at the Slug Club lunch on the train.  You should have come, it would have been more fun."
Draco nodded silently, looking down again as his mind VERY easily brought that moment to the forefront.  Because he remembered, too.  It really had just been a moment and yet somehow time seemed to expand for that moment.  Harry had scooped up his wand, then looked up and met his eyes.  Draco just watched him, everything in him feeling crumbled to bits.  He didn't care that Harry had his wand.  He didn't care if anyone saw him looking at Harry the way he was.  Everything in him SCREAMED to beg the other boy to take him wherever they were going.  He didn't care what it was they were doing, didn't care if they dragged him halfway across the world then left him there so long as it was away from his house, away from the war, away from Voldemort and all the horrible, terrible things he kept having to do.
Draco's eyes flooded again.  Then closed as Harry spoke and choking sobs shook his body that went limp under Harry who removed his hand from Draco's mouth.
“Ah, you have big mugs, thank Merlin..”  Neville said, the smile audible in his voice even before Draco turned to see him.
He moved closer to Neville but only so he could look more closely at some of the other things.  “Sam.. Sung...  eh.. phone..  google...  Oh now whatever that last one is, it sounds rude.  What ARE those?”
“Easy..” Neville said, loosening his arms around Draco as the other man stood up on his own, but not removing them.  “Are you okay?  You're breathing but.. Merlin you're pale.  And that's saying a lot considering how pale you normally are...”
He couldn't help but laugh, rubbing a hand against his forehead as the others clapped for him and he was once again side hugged by the same friendly lady.  He knew he'd done well, but he was still quite taken aback that he'd made Star Baker.
"The whole point of a question like that is to make you try and choose between two things you don't like.  You HAVE to find the least offensive option between two equally shitty choices.  Which you did, obviously.  You'd have to put up with listening to her talk and shriek and bitch and moan, but you'd be awfully well fed."
He loosened his arms around Harry, turning his head in what felt like slow motion to look over the other man as Harry's head turned as well.  Both of them spotting at roughly the same time, the absolutely ENRAGED form of Narcissa Malfoy standing half up the stairs.
“Yes.  Electronics.  Like the television and the phone.  I was in the store to see them all and I want more of them.”
“It comes with practice...  And I think it differs a little bit depending on the person and depending on their skill level.”  Draco sat down next to Harry and smiled, rubbing a hand against the back of his neck.  “I feel it up the back of my neck, just here.  Like someone is slowly trailing and icicle up the middle of it.  I know from experience that I have until the 'icicle' reaches my back hairline to shut them out or they'll see something.”
Harry made a sharp noise, nearly dropping his books as he left Defence Against the Dark Arts.  Someone had seized the back of his robes and pulled, making him stumble back until he found himself in a doorway, staring at Draco in bewilderment for a few moments.  “What do---”
He blinked in the dark, his eyes accustomed to it, but still unable to see much.  “Mimir?”  He said groggily, his half asleep brain trying to put pieces together of why the owl might be back already.  “I didn't think you'd be back for a day or two...”
With some help from Hermione Harry thinks he may have found a way to start tracing the things missing from Malfoy Manor.
--Along with Inktober, it is Fictober! Following a prompt list from Tumblr I'm going to write short fics based around those prompts. A friend doing the same is titling each fic with the prompt so I'm totally copying that. ;)
"Harry it...." Draco swallowed hard, clenching his fists and holding them tight against his stomach.  "Harry it never went away.  It wasn't just some stressed out misplaced feelings.  I'd had them for years and.. they never went away."
"We haven't.  I think if this was last year I wouldn't have liked it.  But between Draco, everything he's said to me, and learning more about you....  I think I'm enjoying this."
"Not a bit.  It's just odd circumstance."  Draco tugged his coat down again, trying to ignore how uncomfortable his pants now were.  He moved to retrieve his wand.  "We better just find the blasted plants..."
“You know you do, and I know you do...” Draco’s smile turned dark, his voice low with Harry so close to him.  “But no one else believes it.  How many times have you told them I’m up to something this year alone? How many times have you said I was behind the necklace that cursed that Bell girl? And how many times have you truly been taken seriously?”
He watched Draco walk towards Astoria who tucked her hand firmly into his arm and sent a truly nasty look towards Harry before she managed to turn both herself and Draco away from him.
As he sat there the fingers of his left hand twitched, and he felt the squirm of the skin on the inside of his left forearm.  He looked to make sure the hall was empty the he shoved his hand under the sleeve of his robe and rubbed at his arm, his stomach squirming for a whole other reason.
“So you went out.”  Harry said, looking from the cup to Draco again, his anger seeming to ebb away.  “Good.  You had me worried with what you said at the cafe.”
He took another step closer to Harry, straightening up so that his height put him above the other man, even if Harry did outweigh him and out muscle him by a fair bit.  “You seem to forget that I am an
“My father’s?  Yes.  I know it sees strange since I never really knew him, but every little bit of him I did find was something I held onto almost murderously tightly.  Hating Slytherin was one of those things. I regret it now.”
The grip on Draco’s robes faltered slightly, loosened, then reaffirmed itself with twice the strength, making the blonde gasp a bit as weight leaned into him and stole a bit more of his breath.
"If Draco was with family I'm sure they would have taken care of Malfoy Manor."  Hermione spoke crisply as always, wiping her mouth carefully on her napkin before she continued.  "But everything is falling apart and no one can get inside.  The house still protects itself from intruders."
Harry grimaced openly and sighed, waiting until he was finished chewing before he replied.  "No, it was something much worse."
Just as Harry had remembered the one night they'd been in Malfoy Manor together just an hour or so before, Draco remembered as well.
“That's kinda what matters.  It's a shit thing for Voldemort to get you to do, but it's him that wants you to do it, not you.”  Harry smiled a bit, shifting slightly so that Draco was closer in against him, their arms still loosely wrapped around each other.  “So what do you want to do?”
"It's no problem.  I'm more than a little concerned that things are missing from Malfoy Manor myself."  Hermione said, sitting back down behind her desk.  "No one should have been able to get in, and depending on what's been taken...  It could be bad news."
Later it was, when Draco was home and settled into an armchair in front of his own fire.  He took out the worn piece of parchment and unfolded it to read.
“Mm.. Well there's a lot of training to become an Auror.  You finish school and decide that's what you want to do and then it's like school all over again.” Neville said, pushing into the yolk of his egg with a corner of his toast.  “So many courses you have to take and a lot you CAN take if you wish to.  Some of them were about the Muggle world.  I didn't feel like I needed that much extra training in some of the other areas so I took a lot of the Muggle world courses.  It was at least something different to learn.  And quite interesting.”
The shock on McGonagall's face when they turned up together to talk to her seriously would have been worth anything.  But the stony disbelief and uncomfortable behaviour of Snape was the icing on the cake.
" He whispered, flicking his wand, even though he hadn't wanted to make light in the woods and attract more attention to himself.  He looked further with his wand lit, trying to see the other boy, trying to find any trace of him.
He never finished that thought.  Someone had grabbed his arm and pulled hard, forcing a none too suave noise from him that would have broke any illusion of superiority he was projecting in that moment.  "What... STOP.. I---"
“Worry about it later...”  He muttered to himself, checking the time as he let out a long low sigh, trying to decide what he wanted to do that day.  Sleep was an option, since he hadn't yet gone to bed.  But he wasn't sure his brain would actually turn off enough to allow proper rest.
So he agreed.  He signed whatever papers they shoved at him, agreed to pack whatever he wanted to bring to fill a two bedroom flat (furniture not required), and sent them on their way happy that they had gotten the job done.
As he reached for the drawer of his desk that the bang had come from, he hesitated.  The whole front of it was shuddering, like something was trying, unsuccessfully, to push it open from the inside which meant that whatever the noise had been, it wasn't anything Muggle.
"Oh Merlin, Potter.  You get away with the most ridiculous bullshit around here.  Do you know what a charmed life you lead?"
“That really would be nice.”  The other man admitted with what was clearly an apologetic smile.  “I'll bring the mug back up when my shift is done, I'll just leave it outside your door, you can get it whenever it suits you if I do that.”
But Harry had insisted.  Aside from some snide remarks at the start and continued disbelief that Draco would even have a chance at getting on the show, Harry HAD become a great deal of help and a wealth of information.  Both from his days spent doing everything the Muggle way at his Aunt and Uncles house, and the incredible instruction imparted to him from Mrs Weasley.
Harry had hesitated, his eyes seemed locked on Draco's as Draco looked back at him, utterly lost and not at all interested in trying to fight with him to get the wands back, even though his own was with them.
are your secrets.”  Harry said with a roll of his eyes.  “He seems to think it's incredibly important that I see and learn all of this but is very pointed in telling me that he has no firm proof of anything that he's
He was not, however, prepared for the hot, hard press of Harry's lips against his own.  And he was not prepared for the intensely visceral reaction he would have to it that meant he was only surprised for a moment before he was leaning into it.  Before he was wrapping his arms around Harry in returns and kissing him back just as roughly.
He didn't run this time.  He couldn't have done it very well anyways if he'd wanted to.  Harry still had him pinned against the tree, not to mention he well and truly had no bearings in the forest anymore.  No idea where to run to if he'd wanted to get away.
"I doubt whatever it was.. was real.."  Draco said slowly, half trying to convince himself of that after his hopes had raised and then fallen with Harry's story.
Annoyed with himself, still annoyed with Harry and annoyed with the world in general, Draco made his way back to his building and pretty much stomped up the stairs.  Once inside and with his shoes off he brought the box containing his laptop over to the coffee table.
“That’s correct, Professor.” He said with a small nod, sitting down at his desk once more.  “Is there something wrong with that?”
They were watching 'The Great British Baking Show', something that had become a bit of an evening ritual whenever both of them had a night free to spend together.  Draco, over the past few weeks, had started to get more vocal about his belief that he could absolutely be a contestant on the show and win.
He wasn't sure what to think.  At all.  His emotions and his thoughts all rammed into each other at once over and over again, pulling him in fifty different directions at the same time.
“I need Slughorn's memory..”  Harry said, hoisting himself up onto the counter to sit, thinking rather smugly about how horrified Aunt Petunia would be if she knew.
“I know you're still loyal to the Malfoys and I get that.  Especially since I know Draco is still out there somewhere when he should be here living in you, right?  That's kind of the reason I own you right now.  I want to try and find him and bring him back.  If I do find him, I'll hand the deed back over to him.  Won't ask him for a knut, swear to Merlin.”
Ron was relying on the same, which was made clear by the way that he was balanced sitting back on two chair legs, secretively eating chocolate frogs rather than reading.  At least Harry was making an effort to look productive.
“If you need money from your account it's not my business why you need it.  You shouldn't have to justify it.  If you ask for a withdrawal from your Gringott's account again I won't ask you what you need it for.  It's YOUR money, after all.  And unless you ask for something that could compromise your safety or the safety of others... I won't tell you no.”
"I kind of want to tell her to just go to the safe house and stay there."  Draco said, leaning his head a bit towards Harry's hand.  "I just...  Have a feeling that this isn't going to go well.  I want her out as soon as possible.  If no one knows where she is then she's safe."
Meanwhile, in the Muggle world, Draco loses a good luck charm.  And can't help but wonder if Harry has anything to do with it...
“I'm head of the Auror Department.”  Harry's voice was tight, a hint of anger in his generally placid green eyes.  “I'm in charge of this entire operation.  I have far more important things to be taking care of than just coming and getting an eye full of
Draco collapsed onto the floor, his face in his hands, his shoulders shaking.  Harry didn't say anything, didn't even look around.  Just kneeled down next to Draco and stayed there.
"That's utter bullshit and completely fucked up."  Draco said, not even bothering to try and think of a more polite way to say it.  "How on earth do they expect you to fight with them, to trust them, to align with their cause if they don't even do you the courtesy of keeping you prepared."
Harry thought it out slowly, then started to nod just as slowly.  It wasn't exactly what they'd been aiming for, but it was, actually, a very good idea.  If Draco's mother went missing, it would generally be thought Draco would be safer at Hogwarts, not at home, in case he was in danger as well.  None of the Death Eaters could come and get him here, not without every professor knowing.  Voldemort definitely wouldn't come here for him.  And no one would likely suspect Draco of having anything to do with his mother disappearing.  Given that his father was in Azkaban, it would be pretty much assumed that it had something to do with Voldemort so...
"Well...  Silver more than gold."  Harry said, tilting his head a bit as he looked at Draco, pleased when a ghost of a smile crossed his lips.
“I never in a million years would have thought I'd see the day that Harry fucking Potter was happy to hear something like this.”
"Well...  Anyways."  Draco said, clearing his throat and softening his tone a bit.  "The point I'm making is that you didn't really have the luxury of being able to explore something like that, given everything else you were up against.  You got shunted into normal life when you were 20, after all the trials were done, all the clean up and all the rebuilding of the world was finally finished.  With the pressure of the whole WORLD watching to see what you were going to do next.  I think the Weasley's expectations of you are a little too high."
Draco couldn't help but smile.  Adult Neville continued to surprise him.  “Ask him then...  If you manage to talk his bull head around to this then I'll do it.”
Harry had barely opened the front door of Malfoy Manor before he was leaving again.  Pelting down the walkway as fast as he could possibly go while something massive, dark and ghostly chased him away from the house.
He still didn't want to.  He still wanted this whole thing to just go away.  He still wished he'd never handed that letter to Harry to read without looking it over himself first.
Harry looked up, still smiling a bit to see Neville looking back to him anxiously, realizing the other boy had gotten ahead of him and he vaguely regretfully worked to catch up.
“That can't be Neville...”  Draco said, but he knew Harry didn't have any reason to lie to him.  “He's an Auror now?  One of YOUR Aurors.”
Sending owls back and forth in the evenings kept him from uncomfortable discussions with his fellow Slytherins.
Chapter Summary - Harry is dreaming again...  Dreaming but not...  But this time he's rather delighted to find Draco with him.  It doesn't take them long to find their host for the evening.  A host with a few very important questions for them...
It seemed that the further into this he went, the more mysteries he was turning up...  And the biggest one, the only one he truly cared about, was still a blank slate.
Returning to the front door again, he once again tapped the spot twice, then said the second incantation.
Draco spoke the three words, then whipped his head around when Astoria called to him.  He looked up to Harry once more, quirking one side of his mouth up in an obvious parody of his childhood smirk.
Proper sleep routine be damned.  That book did not account for all things that could happen in life and make you exhausted.
“Go back to sleep.” He said, unable to keep the cold tone out of his voice, happy that he had pulled his bed hangings closed when he had gone to bed earlier.  “I'm perfectly fine.”
He got up from the couch again and went to the window, looking out and around until he spotted Neville across the street, then further up was another man he recognized as an Auror with a cart of some kind that he was selling things from.
Surprisingly, Harry laughed at that, and once again Draco couldn't help but smile with him.  "Well it's true."
my help.”  Draco tilted his head back and to the side as he watched the other man, then let it drop forward again more naturally as he nodded.  “It's fine, Potter.  I won't use Mimir unless it's night time.  He'll understand if I tell him only to come and go at night so even if Nott's messages come during the day he won't bring them until it's safe.  I won't communicate with anyone else via owl.  And I will do my best to try and bring Nott around to the idea of what you're doing here.  I cannot promise it will be a quick job, though, and I certainly can't promise success.”
As his emotion and excitement grew, Harry felt his scar start tingling.  He started to move his hand up to it but stopped himself when his eyes landed back on Ron and Hermione who were still arguing.  He couldn't let them see him touch it or they'd start asking about it and he didn't want to get into that 'cycle of concern' again.  Where he couldn't so much as brush his hair off his forehead without one of them asking if his scar hurt.
Draco watched Harry carefully, as he always did when he started talking about his family and their involvement in the other side of the war.  He knew Harry didn't hold him personally accountable for any of it.  But he couldn't help being worried that at some point he'd say something that went too far, that revealed something that Harry didn't know and couldn't stomach.  That even if he didn't hold Draco accountable or responsible for any of this, he wouldn't be able to stand being around him once he knew too much.  So far, Harry had never flinched, not once.
It was a little worse for wear, having been handled so many times and so long ago, but Harry's name was still on it, it was still sealed and it still had... everything he'd always wanted to say to him within it.
"Fudge was always a coward.  And Scrimgeour was a ridiculously pompous figurehead.  We've done so much better with Kingsley."
He'd purchased Mimir not long after things had settled after the war.  It had been one of the first trips out he'd made, one of the only trips he had made that had been stress free and no one had yelled at him.  When that started happening, and he stopped going out, Mimir was pretty much the only other living thing he interacted with, making them quite a tight knit pair.
Draco raised one shoulder in a slight shrug, scratching his cheek.  "He's asked me a few questions.  He also said that he'd been planning on how to help me since he made the Unbreakable Vow.  That he had a plan in place."
Draco laughed.  He couldn't help himself, and when he laughed Harry did, too.  And they laughed up the hall without looking back, half leaning on each other for support by the time they'd gotten far enough away they could stop moving.
With a smile Draco turned back to his living room and watched Mimir as he groomed the inside of one wing.  “We have our work cut out for us..”
Any lingering doubt he'd had about Harry was dissolving like sugar in water that evening.  Realizing the more he showed and told the other boy, the more he found out Harry already knew, and had never said a word about, never shared with anyone, never so much as hedged at with him until it was there in front of them both.  It was clear that even if Draco didn't understand the about face Harry had made this year, it was in earnest.  It was real.  And he could trust him.
Merlin, it was jut one hit after another this morning, wasn't it.  Draco tried not to falter or squeeze his eyes shut or think too hard about what Neville was saying as he passed the mug to him.  He managed to nod, managed to look up to Neville's eyes.  “He did.  Why?”
“Ooo...  Scary word, Potter.”  Draco couldn't help himself.  He smirked when Harry spoke about trusting him,  the whole situation absolutely insane, really.
“I will certainly consider it.”  Draco's non-compliant smirk returned as he looked over at Harry.  “Thank you for bringing my owl, Potter.  As loathe as I am to say anything nice to you, that was very kind and I appreciate it.”
That was what he wanted, he thought.  A laptop of some kind...  When he looked at pictures on his phone of 'computers' he managed to figure out what a 'desktop' was and what a 'laptop' was.  Laptops looked more his speed...
"You know what I mean."  Harry said, leaning forward a bit so he could whisper to the other boy, his words so low they barely made a sound.  "I know, Draco, I guessed when I saw you in Borgin and Burkes.  I've seen you favour your arm since the start of school.  I'm not going to run off and tell anyone, I would have done it already if I intended to."
“Not so long as the Horcrux is safe.  And they're supposed to be incredibly hard to destroy, too.  You couldn't make a necklace a Horcrux and then just take a hammer to it to destroy it.”
"Erm...  Yes."  Harry said, looking down at his hands in his lap.  "She made very polite small talk for a few moments.  Which she's never done before.  Normally she looks through me if I'm not there, I see her out fairly frequently."
Really little things.  Like how he capitalized everything in what he said about Ron's parents, except the word 'muggle'.  Even if Harry had been purposely trying to spy on him and get close to him by acting differently, there is no way he would have caught that small detail, no way it would have occurred to him to not capitalize that word with such intended and insulting purpose.
"Muscle pain."  Draco said after a few moments, realizing Harry was watching him, realizing clearly how obvious he'd been.
And he couldn't help but wrinkle his nose.  Couldn't help running a finger along the mantle and making a noise of disgust at the rolled dust that collected as he did it.  Couldn't help recoiling from the smudgy dirty window when he went to look out of it.
“I did...”  Draco said, his voice tight as he looked back at Harry, hating how utterly casual the other man was acting.  Like they were cordial enough to stop in shops and have a chat and a catch up whenever they saw each other.
"Good."  Harry said,  sliding his hand up to the centre of Draco's back, feeling the warmth of the smaller boy through his shirt.
Voldemort.  His grief was with the way the people opposing Voldemort had treated him.  Had expected him to just keep going and fight for them even though they never prepared him for or gave him any help towards doing that.
Two weeks ago.  It seemed like a hell of a lot longer, but it had been two weeks since he'd been up here to do his homework and Harry had been here and they'd ended up.. well...
He came first in the technical, clapping politely for everyone else around him and accepting a side hug from the woman next to him who had come second.  "Brilliant."  She whispered to him, giving him a squeeze.  "Just brilliant, young man like you doing so well."
"I'm composed.  That's as okay as I'm going to get."  Draco nodded his head once, then looked over his shoulder back the way he came.  "I'll go first, if that's alright."
Harry stared at it, slightly open mouthed in surprise for a few moments before he jerked his head up to look at Draco accusingly.  “Hermione gave me this in fifth year.”“I know.”
What if Harry changed his allegiance? What if it was brought about accidentally? What if no one, not Harry, not his friends, not Borgin, not Voldemort, had any intention of it happening... But it did.
"Hot."  Harry said quietly, reaching up and trailing the pads of two fingers along the sharp line of Draco's jaw.  "I thought the way you talked to him was deadly hot..."
” Tom said, uncrossing his knees and leaning forward towards Draco, resting his forearms on his thighs.  “I'm shocked that Lucius and Narcissa would let you learn anything about something so dastardly but useful.”
married.”  Neville said, his ears practically turning purple at this point.  “But it was...  It was an utter disaster.  We divorced not long afterwards... Quietly, though.”
Draco sat, on the edge of a chair across from Harry after shifting some papers from the seat to the one next to him. "What's going on..."
"It was going to be Daphne, but she refused and her parents told her that if they could find someone more suitable then she wouldn't have to marry me.  She ended up with someone her dad's age in need of a wife after his first one passed away.  So Astoria got stuck with me because one of the Greengrass' had to marry a Malfoy."
But now...  Standing here in this smelly, cramped and utterly ugly flat, he wondered if he had made a mistake.
--Along with Inktober, it is Fictober! Following a prompt list from Tumblr I'm going to write short fics based around those prompts. A friend doing the same is titling each fic with the prompt so I'm totally copying that. ;)
"Move.." The one word came quietly from the blonde and Harry, who had stilled his hips, pushed forward again until they pressed against the soft flesh of Draco's ass, pulling a low stifled groan from deep in his chest.
He untied the parchment, then took in a sharp breath when he turned it over.  His eyes bounced from the small little scratch of the funny Slytherin crest, to his name written in a heavy, spiky and slanting script that hadn't changed at all from school.
He walked further in, going slowly and quietly because even though he knew that the Malfoys were not here, he almost expected to turn a corner and find Lucius there with one hand on his cane, ready to unsheathe his wand and point it directly at him.
“We can't tell them that, though.  They'll know we did it on purpose to catch Snape out and I don't think 'entrapment of a professor' would go over so well.  It'll be one night and he won't make me do anything terrible.”
“Theodore...”  Draco practically whispered out the word, everything in him squeezing, twisting up.  The air fizzling from his lungs and his blood at a very rapid pace as an odd drumming sound filled his ears.
wrote to me and told me that under no circumstances were you to be at Malfoy Manor when your father was released."
Tom quirked one side of his mouth up, his eyes glinting that vague slightly red tone as they looked into Harry's green ones.  “I haven't done anything with you.  Yet.  Come.”
Astoria wouldn't be able to date anymore.  Scorpius would grow up with the terrible Malfoy influence Draco had so carefully tried to keep out of his life.
“A pamphlet then.  A booklet.  'How to Survive the Muggle World – For Wizards'.”  Draco said, picking up the 'remote' as per the instructions left for him.
Chapter Summary-  Harry is on a mission now to find out all he can about sending a message to Narcissa Malfoy and keeping it secret and safeguarded.  He led Draco to believe the other boy knew who he would be going to for the help but he might not have been totally honest.  He needed to know the advice he was getting was the best, and to him there was only one person that he trusted for that...
Draco scrunched his mouth to one side, then huffed out a breath of air.  He was annoyed now.  Annoyed with frayed nerves and way too much on his mind.  So it was a very unpleasant face that appeared to the two men on the other wise of the door when Draco wrenched it open.
"No.. Please tell me."  Draco smiled, neither of them looking at each other but sharing such personal things.  It was really rather nice.
"We can't keep doing this." He said bluntly, which was how Draco tended to approach most things.  Head on, straight to the point, nothing delicate at all.  And immediate.  He made decisions like lightning, fast and sharp and often destructive.
Narcissa smiled as well, looking towards the fire.  "You know that no matter how okay I am with you and Harry, and I am, I still don't really want to walk up on you kissing as you were today."
Draco half raised one shoulder and tilted his head towards it, as though silently saying 'so you say', but he didn't interrupt Harry again.
Draco felt his eyes widen at what Harry was telling him, nodding his head a bit and motioning with one hand a bit to get Harry to come even closer.  "Go on..."
"Because I do.  Because Voldemort doesn't just affect my life, and the fight I know I'm heading towards with him isn't just for me."
“He threatened Borgin about getting it fixed.”  Harry said, tilting his head and trying to smile apologetically to Ron, like he didn't want to burst his bubble.  Even though he was being particularly stupid in that moment. “Even if Borgin doesn't want to be under the Malfoy's thumb all the time, I don't think that was an idle threat.”
He slid out of the chair and onto the floor, curling in on himself as he willed whatever curse had been put on him to just finish the job.
"It's all about appearances.  You're the Chosen One, the Boy Who Lived, the hero of our world.  People will want to see you married with kids and living a fine, quaint and comfortable life."
And he also felt stupid for even wondering if it was something else.  Why would he even think that would be the case?
It's taking every effort both Harry and Draco have not to get kicked right out of the library as they work.  Who would have thought they'd have so much fun together?  But when secrets are revealed and an offer of help comes from a very odd source, will they manage to keep having fun?
Why was it that no matter which side he stood on there was someone there that just wanted to use him?
long time.  And I never in a million years would have guessed I'd see him again while he was angrily justifying something I'd done."
Neville started laughing, but it was clearly just an amused laugh, not a 'you're so stupid' laugh, so Draco smiled along with him.
"I think I have to let Snape help me."  Draco said, reaching to pick up the sickle that Harry had put down on the table, rolling it against his thumb and forefinger.
Harry muttered the words, making Draco jump a bit, casting one sideways look at the other boy before swinging his telescope in the direction he thought Harry meant.
“You saying it isn't fair and acknowledging that we should both get detention counts.”  Draco smiled at Harry, swinging his legs a little bit to bounce his heels against the wall.
"Mm."  Harry made a noise of agreement, nodding a couple of times and then sighing deeply.  He rubbed his hand against Draco's arm a couple of times then let it fall away.  "So what do we do now?"
“Oh for...” Draco half laughed and half groaned, resting his forehead down against his arms.  “I know how to make a bloody sandwich, Longbottom.  I am not entirely helpless.  If it doesn't require cooking, I will do fine.  I KNOW how to do basic things without waving my wand around.  But if you ask me to cook with the Muggle.. things..” He paused there, gesturing vaguely at the stove and what Harry had called the 'toaster' before he continued  “Then I don't know what to do.”
Not wanting to stand and hover near the doorway of the building which might have invited one fo the Aurors to talk to him and ask him if he needed anything, he turned right and started walking down the street even though he wasn't completely sure it was the right way.  It didn't really matter, though.  Even if he walked and didn't find the store he could pick some shop to go into like he had
Draco leaned over to tie the letter to the leg of his owl once it was sealed and Harry's name was on the front.
And if he was being honest about himself as well, he wasn't much of a slouch when it came to magic.  In terms of the basics, it seemed as though they had what they needed.
Draco has been writing letters to Harry for years. The first one he wrote he really did mean to send, but then he didn't... Since then he has been writing letters, sealing them, and putting them in a drawer. They're personal, and therapeutic, they tell Harry everything... But they're never ACTUALLY supposed to be sent to him...
“Oh so you are serving a purpose here.” Draco said icily, resenting Harry's presence, his closing the box on him like he was a child, and the tone of his voice.  “You aren't just here to have a look at a Malfoy in the Muggle world?”
He took in a hard breath, only realizing as the air hit his lungs that he hadn't been breathing for awhile.  At least not properly and not deeply.  That first rush of air made his head spin even more but it was like water in a parched throat it hit him so keenly.
Draco tilted his head a bit as he looked at the other boy, his hair damp and slicked back from his face, water droplets clinging to his neck and the top of his chest.
"I know."  Draco said with a nod, sighing softly.  "But I don't understand why it matters so much to her or to anyone at this point..."
But this time he didn't end up in the orphanage.  He wasn't anywhere he recognized, though something about it seemed to nudge at him as oddly familiar.  Like a room he had read about in a book that he was now walking around inside.  He followed the hall he was in, wide and panelled richly in dark wood.  There were sconces on the walls, the fire lit in them oddly static, glowing without flickering.  He wasn't sure if that was because this was something of a dream or if they were magic and supposed to be that way.
Draco sat up, looking at Harry with renewed interest.  "It must be good if you came down here straight away."
He pulled and opened the door, pushing it wide enough to see Harry on the other side.  "You called me a prat."
Draco shifted, moving in front of Harry as he fixed the icy, smirky, ego driven facade of his First Year self onto his face.  "You'll soon find out some Wizarding families are much better than others, Potter.  You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort."
"You're still going?"  Draco asked,  turning towards Harry a bit.  "I suppose you have to if we're committing to try and act like everything is as normal as possible."
"Apparently you do."  Harry said, pointing first outside, then moving the telescope to where his finger was.  "Look first, not through the telescope, just out the window."  He pointed again and Draco moved closer to him to look where he was pointing.
"Oh totally charmed.  Hunted and wanted dead by everyone in your family, all the Death Eaters and Voldemort himself."  Harry smirked, then nudged Draco with his elbow.  "But yeah, I do know."
But this is what came from socializing with people.  He could only control himself, which is what he did for seven years, and he did a very good job of it.  As soon as other people were added into the mix, you never knew what was going to be said, what trouble they'd poke and prod into...
Harry immediately and swiftly bent over in silent hysterics, shaking his head, and plunging his hands into his hair, gripping it tightly as he laughed so hard he couldn't breathe, not daring to let it make a sound.  Hearing Draco gasping in almost but not quite silent laughter next to him didn't help.
"I just..." Harry chuckled as well, running a hand through his hair and seeming a little fidgety that he'd been that easy to read.  "I just wondered... why?"
He wasn't sure how he felt about that.  It bothered him, before, that his scar was no longer acting up.  He had felt disconnected, but now...  Now he just felt spied on.
Harry was used to Dumbledore knowing everything even when it seemed strange that he should. But this was probably the first time Draco had been faced with it personally, and it was such a potent blow to come right NOW.
Harry nodded, but didn't say anything else as he left.  Not even to remind Draco to lock the door behind him (which he got up and did anyways).
He couldn't keep the bitter and dark note out of his voice and Harry's fingers flexed against his back.  He focused fully on the warmth of that hand on him, seeping through his clothes and into his skin.  Like an anchor keeping him there.
"I almost was."  Harry admitted as he joined him, leaning back to look up at the lake bottom again.  "The Sorting Hat almost put me there.  But I had been rather brainwashed by everyone I'd talked to at that point into thinking Slytherin was bad so I was rather adamant about not being put here.  Now I wish I'd kept my mouth shut."
"That was how Ginny started finding out."  Harry said, knitting his fingers together a bit.  "Not to change the subject and make this about me..."
"Was that for me?"  Harry asked, gesturing to the parchment as he stepped further into the room.  "You were actually going to write back to me?  Why haven't you before... I was worried about you..."
Draco moved across the room, waiting until Harry was looking at him before he flicked the light switch on and off.  “I have some skills of deduction, thank you.  And I don't need a tour of the neighbourhood.”
"It was my fault, Mrs. Malfoy, I--"  Harry said, but he stopped speaking when Narcissa's cold eyes flicked to him so sharply they could have cut his flesh.
"It's lovely."  Prue said, resting her hands on the counter and looking over Draco's ingredients.  "And what are you making for us today?"
What would happen when 'The Chosen One" decided he liked the idea of a Wizarding World, if not an entire world, under the power of Voldemort?
"No you wouldn't.  Do you like standing here?  Talking with me?  We've never truly had a conversation before, have we..."
Draco’s arms came up, one folding over the back of Harry’s neck while his other hand plunged into his dark, messy hair.  He tilted his head up a bit to press back into the bruising kiss, his mouth opening just as Harry’s did.
This had become more frequent.  After the chance meeting and conversation they'd had on the stairs a few weeks ago, Draco started to notice that Harry was kind of everywhere he was.  And not the same way he used to be.  It
“Electronics.”  Neville said, looking in the window next to Draco, chuckling at the blank look he got.  “It's sort of an all encompassing term for anything that requires power to be used.  It used to be for things that required electricity, which is what makes your television and the lights in your flat and the toaster and all of that work.  But there are also things that run on 'batteries'.  Which are small objects that hold power so you can use things without them being plugged into the wall.”
They'd probably smirked at each other, knowing little smirks that had been growing in frequency and intensity over the course of that whole year.  But then?  They went to class and everything went to shit and... he'd never spoken to him again.
Neville stayed quiet for a few moments, thinking, then scratched the side of his head as he turned his eyes towards Draco's face.  “What if we got you a way to communicate with him?  Letters.  Through Floo or Owl?  Would you consider writing to him then?”
He reached over to pick up the cup of bubble tea still on the coffee table, but put it back down again after he'd taken half a sip.  The ice had melted and the soft floral taste of the tea had diluted unpleasantly.  Not to mention that holding the cup seemed to highlight the tremor in his hands.
"Harry..." Hermione started and then hesitated, rethinking what she was going to say before continuing.  "Do you think we should tell anyone about what happened?  About seeing Draco in Borgin & Burkes?"
"It was really.. that arranged?  When you said it before I thought it was just sort of...  Well I don't know what I thought, but I didn't think it was that set up."  Harry fiddled with his napkin as he watched Draco.
“This is a nice neighbourhood, really.”  Neville said, his hands in his pockets as they walked together.
Draco shook his head almost before Harry was finished speaking."  Absolutely not.  Astoria and I are in complete agreement about it, as well.  It's funny.." Draco chuckled a bit, picking up another biscuit.  "We absolutely did not work as a married couple, but as parents we are
"You can see them now?"  Harry asked, getting up off the floor.  He set the sickle on Draco's bedside table before sitting down on the bed next to him.  "You couldn't in class last year.  Or were you pretending you couldn't to make Hagrid look like a joke to Umbridge?"
"No he wouldn't have."  Harry said, trying to keep his voice gentle but even he could hear the note of panic in it.
Harry looked taken aback, sitting up on his stool and frowning at Draco before he got up and followed him into the living room.  “What do you mean?  You have everything you need, right?  You don't have to justify stuff.”
"Neither of those were intentional."  Draco said, not disputing it, just setting things right.  "I never wanted to hurt Katie.  Or Weasley.  I'm just not good at thinking of every possible variable."
“No..”  Harry said, shaking his head.  “Neither did just trying very very small objects.  He thought he might have to build up to larger things.  And he tried non-living things and living things--”
Draco sucked in a sharp breath, sitting back in the chair, his arm stretched out in front of him because Harry had refused to let go of his hand.  The implication here was clear.  Draco could read between the lines easily even with the threat of his brain fogging over.
Borgin spoke in a tone of genial rebuke towards his young 'customer', using a small cloth to pick up the slimmest of silver rings.  There was no stone, no carving to it, just a very thin line of silver.  It did, somehow, seem to shine brighter than any of the other rings.  Somehow it seemed more attractive and more beguiling than even the most ornate piece on the tray.
“So I have to wait, then?  You said long term plans.”  Draco couldn't help feeling a little disappointed.  He was loathe to admit that he was thoroughly interested in something Muggle related.  But 'electronics', as Neville had called them, seemed terribly interesting and not at all what he was expecting of this world.
He was turning his coffee cake carefully out of the pan when he looked up and caught the eye of the woman who'd hugged him yesterday.  She smiled at him and turned more towards his bench.
"They could just go to restaurants, though.  Nice ones where you can sit down and eat.." He wasn't sure about this whole thing.  But he was game to try whatever Harry suggested since he was the one who knew what he was doing.
“It's just a big house..”  He said, tilting his head and looking at it slightly confused.  “It doesn't seem like one when you're inside.”
Harry drawled at him, parroting back to Draco what Draco had said to him when they had detention together in the forest.
“I, unfortunately for you, am in the position of not having to prove I’m innocent in this situation.  After so many false accusations, YOU will have to prove I’m guilty.”
"I don't want that either.  You could have just explained it to me, we could have figured it out together."
Tom pushed back from Harry, but gave his thighs a squeeze that included the hard press of his sharp nails.  A feeling that gave Harry a bit of a jolt in the pit of his stomach that wasn't entirely unpleasant.
"Harry."  The blonde boy stepped out from a thick clump of trees, black and stark in the dim moon light, making Draco's pale skin and hair glow almost as much as his Patronus did.
Re-telling in AU what happens when Harry finds Draco in the bathroom in book six. It wasn't supposed to be a chaptered fic but as I was writing it I realized there was no way to say everything in one part. So we'll see where it takes us!
"All will be well, My Lady Malfoy."  He said easily, raising one hand and bowing slightly as she swept out of the shop.
Draco turned his head a bit, realizing then just how close Harry was to him.  How every time they met here, their desire for personal space and reflex reaction to stay away from each other lessened more and more.  "You know the feeling?"
“What is all this..”  He asked, glancing at Neville then back to the window, tilting his head as he looked at everything curiously.
"Leave getting an Owl with me?"  Harry said, squeezing Draco's hands as he looked at him.  "We want absolutely no trace of you on this.  Nothing that could ever really be traced to you.  No one in their right mind would suspect I'd be helping you.  So if anything ever happened they might trace it to me, but it won't go past that."
"Yeah?"  Harry leaned forward, resting his forearms on his knees as he looked at Draco with interest.  "Why do you think that?"
“What are you talking about?”  Harry asked, furrowing his brow and shaking his head at Draco.  “When?”
Harry shrugged one shoulder a bit, yawning and thus missing the look that passed between Ron and Hermione.
Kind of adorable.  Not that Draco was thinking about that.  He was pointedly NOT thinking about that.
His heart resumed it's normal rhythm, faster than it should be, but it wasn't skipping beats and then trying to catch them up again.
“Right...”  Draco laughed, sliding back on the couch a bit and turning towards Harry a little more.  “There was a lot I didn't understand until I got older, but the basic idea is that there is a way, through incredibly dark magic, to split your soul.  And when you split it you can like... embed it into an object and the object will keep it safe.  And so long as your Horcux is safe, you can never
“I might need it for a really fast get away from the Castle.”  Draco said, with no hesitation what so ever.
"It's funny who can become our ally when we just let our minds relax and be more welcoming."  Dumbledore said, then chuckled when he saw Harry's cheeks go red.  "I'm not shaming you, Harry.  Your accusations were not exactly off point, were they?  You knew Draco was up to something and you were right.  I had always known you were right, I simply just didn't want you to get involved, things had to play out the right way.  I just wanted you to trust that it wasn't your problem to deal with."
“Can I go now?” He asked Harry, tilting his head a bit with a smirk. “Or did you have something else to offer in exchange for information?”
It was clear by the end that several of the guests to the lunch would be awaiting further judgement by the time they left it.  Harry found himself trailing behind Zabini as they walked away to go back to their compartments and change.  He kept a few steps back, wanting to hear what Zabini said about the lunch and the people there, but knowing if any of them saw him there they wouldn't say a word.
“Give what back?”  Draco asked, tilting his head up to smile non-chalantly into Harry's face, picking up a cup from the coffee table next to him, taking a sip from the straw.
"Ten points to Gryffindor for stating the absolute obvious."  Draco said, his voice coming out sharp and hurt and it made him madder to hear it.  He pushed his hair out of his eyes to glare at Harry.  "You were GONE, I thought I was alone and then you GRABBED me?  In the fucking Forbidden Forest!  Who wouldn't be scared by that!?"
He rolled folded the parchment into a self contained little packet, writing Theodore's name on it.  He was just about to call the project complete when another memory surfaced.. Bits and pieces at first... Then the whole of it flowed like he'd managed to unstop a river.
“Why did you help me get this?”  Harry asked as he took the small vial, turning it over in his fingers but keeping his eyes on Tom.
“You had a meeting with Dumbledore last night, right?”  Draco said, breaking the silence and utterly changing the subject at the same time.
"I was just... Wondering...  If your mother has spoken to you again?"  Harry asked, his eyes seemingly unable to stay on Draco's for more than a moment.
Harry nodded when Draco faltered looking for words, tilting his head a bit.  "I know.  Dumbledore does that.  I've gotten used to it..."
Chapter 4 Summary-  Harry has to get some help from a most unlikely and unsavoury (to him) source.  Nothing but the desperate need of the situation and of Draco himself would give him the drive needed to do this...
Harry’s hand twitched, but the gentleness of the jinx just made his fingers slacken of their own accord.  The wand dropped onto the desk instead of jerking and flying away from him.  It rolled towards Draco who carefully and almost reverently picked it up.
He'd managed to have something to eat and watch a whole episode of something mindless on tv before his fireplace flared red and shot another envelope out at him.
It took them a good hour and a half before they left again.  Neville told him as they went in that he was going to talk to the sales person as though he was buying the phone for himself.  But that if Draco heard them ask any questions about the phone that that he actually understood that he could speak up and say what he wanted.
Harry couldn’t help but smile, some of the Draco he’d known in school was leaking out in those words.  Not wanting to give the upper hand to Harry even if there wasn’t truly an upper hand here.  “That’s no trouble at all.  We can write whenever needed on this or anything else that needs discussion.”
“Harry..”  Hermione said tentatively, placing a hand on his arm. “We think you need a break.  You need to go somewhere and rest.  Properly rest.”
"Snape?"  Harry asked, his eyes narrowing a bit, his hackles raising.  "What does he have to do with anything?"
“Well..”  Draco said the one word hesitantly.  There was something he wanted to know but he had been hoping to ask Neville about it rather than Harry.
Harry smirked, nodding as they started walking up and down the hall several times in front of where the door for the Room of Requirement would open.
"Because the only other choice was McLaggen.   And I liked telling him Ron won the spot more than I think I'd like winning the Cup itself."
Robes, quills, rolls of parchment.  A few bottles of ink and countless pairs of socks got tossed haphazardly back into his trunk.
But after several minutes passed with nothing where he was,  and a walk around the main floor to see if he could hear the bells from somewhere else, he decided that what he was looking for wasn't in the house.
"No offence taken, I don't like her much either."  Draco said, settling his shoulders against the padded back of the bench.  "Anyways, she practically pounced on me and was saying that I just needed to tell her the information I had and she'd take it to him, that there was no reason for me to need to see him directly.  I think my mother wanted to agree with her, but I insisted.  I told her straight out that the information I had was PERSONAL in regards to him and that I wasn't comfortable telling people his personal information when he may not want it known.  She kept trying to insist and I just kept saying no..."
that was being offered.   He'd walked into this thinking that he was going to get extra terrible treatment because of who he was, but instead he was finding out he was getting
They hefted the portrait across the long basement where Keacher directed them, leaning it against the wall facing inwards, but on enough of an incline that Kreacher could slide between it and the wall to see his old Mistress.
“I'll teach you about apps.  Or Harry will.  But right now just use this for communication, alright?”
"Since always, really."  Draco admitted, pulling his knees to his chest and circling his arms around them.  "I fell into line with my parents because that's what you do.  I didn't question much, we didn't really have to.  Voldemort was GONE, I figured even if I wasn't sure how I felt about what he stood for, it was really a moot point.  I could say what made my family happy and that was the end of it."
Harry stood in the same place long after the quiet sound of Draco's footsteps had lapsed.  Watching the place between the tree's he'd last seen him.
"Before you were born.  Not too much before, though.  I saw your mother, your uncle and your grandfather.  And I saw your father from a distance as well.  Your uncle was in trouble, there was someone from the Ministry there trying to lay down the law..."
"Ahhhhh..." Harry nodded his head slowly and with a bit of a smile.  "Alright, now I understand.  Someone saw us together, she heard about it, now people are talking.  It
"Lost item returned!" An odd tinny voice chirped as he put his hand on the galleon.  With a small pop the red bubble disappeared and the galleon bounced down onto his palm.
It seemed perfectly natural for Harry to push his back up hard against the wall as he kissed him harder.. deeper...  Their lips parting and tongues meeting in a slide that Draco would have described as 'electric' if he'd had any idea what electricity actually was.
Harry was leaning against the open doorframe, his arms crossed loosely over his chest while Draco stood on the front step.  He couldn't help his mind wandering ever so slightly to how good Harry looked standing there.  That casual lean against the house that looked so natural and so...
A fresh wave of tears took the other boy and Draco turned on the floor away from Harry as his shoulders shook.  "No one can help.  Not even you."
Harry, however, didn't even flinch.  He reached over and put a hand over Draco's on the couch, letting out a soft breath.  “That's a pretty nasty thing to make you do.  I suppose I shouldn't be surprised given it's...  Well it's Voldemort.”
Draco couldn't help but be a little self satisfied with that reaction.  He'd hit the right nerve there.  And more than that he'd managed to take Harry down a few pegs in Potions class with this.  Harry had no right to be petted on by Slughorn anyways.
“He knows you saved my life.  He knows you saved all of our lives. He knows that by the time the actual war truly began that the Malfoy’s were lower than pawns to... him... And that without you we wouldn’t be here and he wouldn’t be here and...” Draco trailed off as he watched Harry put his face in his hands, feeling a bit insulted.  “I told him the truth.” He said defensively.
They fell silent again, letting it stretch while they looked at each other before eventually, again, Draco shifted.  "I need to go."
Physically he was still sitting in the kitchen of his Muggle flat, but mentally he was back in Malfoy Manor.  Seeing Ollivander's gaunt face, his sunken cheeks, the sympathetic look in his eyes as Draco's hands shook holding out the food that he was, more often than not, tasked with bringing the prisoners being held in his own home.
Harry leaned in a bit, his breath releasing in a warm rush against the side of Draco's cheek.  "This is nuts."  He said quietly.
Harry grated the words out, and the strain in his voice, the thickness there that Draco could hear that confirmed he was just as far gone as he was, that had to be the hottest thing he'd ever heard.  Ever.
"That's awful."  Draco said, moving to stand next to Harry, looking at the desk.  "Even if you know it's a Boggart, some of the things it can turn into...  It's terrible just to see it, you can't get your head to wrap around turning it into something funny."
Ron's sleepy voice came from across the room and Harry heard the shift of his blankets as the other boy moved to get up.
“You do not.”  Harry's voice was skeptical, then he laughed as he got to his feet and saw the look on Draco's face.  “How in Merlin do you know how to do the washing up?”
“I'm sorry to bother you.”  He said to the house, stopping short of the grand stairs that lead to the door.  “I'm not here to throw things at you, or gape at you or do anything nasty to you.  But I'm your legal owner now.”
Smoothing it out, he took in a breath of surprise.  His eyes whipped over the words several times, trying to make them make sense when they didn't...  Or rather, they made sense as they were written but the content of them was not anything Draco expected to read.  Not from Theodore or anyone, for that matter...
He'd never meant to stay at Grimmauld Place, but after the first year he realized that as the legal owner of the home he could actually move things around.  The portraits weren't up with a permanent sticking charm after all and he'd spent several weeks taking them all down and stacking them in the basement.  With their presence removed the house suddenly felt different...  And for the next six months after that he worked hard, erasing every last trace of the Black's from the house and doing it over for himself.
Harry followed without thinking twice, squeezing in next to him and shaking his head, still chuckling.  “I've never seen two people more shocked.  It was amazing...  But it isn't fair you're getting detention when we both wrote that essay.”
“I can help you with anything you don't know.”  Harry said as he came to join him, having shed his jacket onto the arm of the couch.
“Neville doesn't know how to hold a grudge.”  Harry said, looking around the flat a little more closely.  “To him, you're someone who got dragged into the war against your will.  You're a classmate, and therefore someone he wants to help.  You know, on closer look, you really didn't mess too much with the flat...”
Harry chuckled.  Very softly but he chuckled all the same, and it made Draco smile even though he desperately wanted not to.
He was met with silence after he spoke and he carefully turned his head to look up at Harry.  When he saw the other man's face he couldn't help but laugh.
“Does it still respond to you?” Draco asked quietly, his voice betraying just how on the mark Harry had hit in talking about their respective wands.
Harry nodded, heading for the door and Draco followed him. When they got to the door, Harry rested his hand on the frame but Draco could sense the hesitation and sense the questions in his mind.  He felt the blush creep into his cheeks again and spoke quickly to try and divert the other man's thoughts.
"A Vanishing Cabinet."  Borgin said in a surprising display of truthfulness.  He had taken a tray of jewelry and small trinkets out of the case and set it on the counter.  "But it won't suit the purpose he wants it for."
Harry shifted and leaned over, Draco felt warm lips touch his cheek and somehow that spurred him to move again, shifting with a low noise to look at Harry who was pulling back from him.
“I think that most people who make Horcruxes protect them... I mean, if you're a good enough Wizard to make one you'd probably have some pretty incredible ways of protecting them.  Jinxes or hexes but like...  REALLY bad.  Bad enough to kill whoever handled your Horcrux.”
"Snakes."  Harry said with a smirk, cutting Draco off and raising both eyebrows at him.  "Snakes are reptiles, Malfoy.  All I did was call you a snake.  Which you are.  Because you're in Slytherin."
Harry rolled his eyes and shook his head, leaning the side of his hip against the doorframe as he crossed his arms.  “Well clearly you've noticed that we've brought YOUR owl to you, not just a Ministry owl.”
That speech got him a look from the corner of Neville's eye.  A small smile.  Enough to know that he was being easily forgiven.
Draco's eyes went a little wide as he raised his head and Harry straightened up.  He took an unconscious step closer to the other boy.  "Acromantulas?" He said quietly, his eyes moving around the dark woods, only a small circle of it still lit by his wand lying on the ground.
So rather than tuck himself back into bed, he pulled on jeans and a long sleeved t-shirt, both of which were soft as clouds from being worn again and again, and walked himself out to the kitchen.
As he stripped and then slid himself under the hard and hot spray of water, he thought about everything that had happened.  He didn't WANT to rehash it all, but he was rather powerless to stop the march of the memories from intruding in.
He ran a hand through his hair and moved back to the kitchen, starting to go through his groups of things to pick out what belonged in the fridge to put away again.  But as he put them into the fridge he tried to keep them separated so he would still easily see which ones he didn't understand.  Once he knew more about the internet he figured he could look them up.  That seemed to be what 'google' meant.  You 'googled' things to learn more about them.
“Nothing.”  Draco said, rousing from his darker thoughts, with a deep breath in, letting it out slowly as he smiled a little bit, sliding one of the mugs to Neville before carrying his own around to sit down on one of the stools as well.
Paul?  Oh Paul Hollywood. The judge.  One of the judges, anyways.  Get it together Draco, you know who that is.
disarm him and remove the wand forcibly if he had to.  Completely certain Draco wouldn't curse him back to keep him off it.  Which...  He was right about.  Draco wouldn't curse him.  Or jinx him or hex him or.. anything.
Harry moved as well, sitting down next to Draco and coughing at the cloud of dust he'd sent whirling into the air.  “There aren't a lot of ways to get out of Hogwarts fast.  Not like this..  You can't apparate, you can't use the Floo Network, and even if you could it's monitored, I think.”
"I said shut UP, Malfoy!  Get away from me."  Harry shifted a few inches further away, hardly moving at all, all things considered, as Draco moved right in front of him.
"Lesser of all evils, I think."  Draco smirked, shifting a bit on the ledge, his thigh and Harry's pressed together.  "Have you finished that essay Snape wants for next class?"
He needed the deed, he'd put that into his vault but he needed that.  And he'd talk to the house this time.   Treat it like it was a person who needed to have something explained to it.  Which he knew, even to most wizards and witches, would sound strange.  But it felt right.
“I know Harry had wanted to ask you if you knew of any way that we could convince him to accept protection.”  Neville ventured, a hopeful tinge in his voice that rubbed against Draco like sandpaper.
Draco was barely breathing as Harry spoke.  Something about the words, the information and the way he was talking about it raised the hairs on the back of his neck.  Not much of it made any sense to him at all, but he suspected that THAT was what would make it so meaningful to Voldemort himself.   He nodded as Harry finished, smiling just a bit.  "I'll tell him..."  He made a slight choking noise, laughing as Harry pulled his tie again.  "If it's safe to do so!  I swear I'll only tell him if it's safe to do it..."
"Having someone to help me work something out.  Figuring something out 'together'.  It's a new concept."
He sat back down again, but on the floor this time, with his back against the couch, and turned on the tv.  Rather smugly he unlocked his new phone and pressed the buttons he had been shown to in order to send a message.
They walked in silence towards the woods and Draco paused at the edge while Harry walked right into them.  The taller boy stopped after a few meters when he realized he was alone before he turned back to look at Draco.  "I'm not doing this alone, this is your fault."
Heeeeey!  I'm back!  Working on updating some (but not all) of my current fics and maybe tossing something new in here and there as well.  I'm going to try not to have another 7.5 month absence this time.  Thanks for sticking around if you've been here before!  And thanks for coming by if you're brand new!
'Should just let the lot of you take your chances.  Deserve death if it comes for you.' Was the worst.
Harry watched them, turning to look for his wife and his own children for a moment, then back to Draco, finding the other man facing him once more.  Looking in that moment like he had when they were in school. So strong and yet some how so broken.
"Good help is hard to find.  I mean, they're clearly serving good purpose, but if you set them loose on their own, you're asking too much."  Harry said, smirking and arching one eyebrow a bit.
"No kidding."  Draco said with a short chuckle.  "Telling me I have nothing to worry about or not to worry generally means there is definitely something to worry about, they just don't want to say what it is."
“Certainly no need for him anymore.  Not when you and I both know he's a dirty double agent and neither of us know which side he's actually on...”
He'd had his first panic attack a year and a half after the war had ended.  He had come out of Diagon Alley and was crossing through The Leaky Cauldron when some witch had stepped right in front of him.
“Pale.  It's fashionable to be pale.”  Draco said, his words still airy but he managed a weak smile at the other man, then half gestured towards the couch before he lurched towards it.
What would happen when 'The Chosen One" decided he liked the idea of a Wizarding World, if not an entire world, under the power of Voldemort?
"I'm sorry...  It does make sense, you aren't wrong.  Snape would want to find a way out.  As much as I don't like him, I know he does care about Dumbledore.  But I'm more concerned about your safety."
"Why did you help me?"  Draco asked, his eyes slightly narrowed, immediately trying to read Harry's motive in this situation.  "You could have just let me give up and fail the assignment."
"Because if I don't believe that things are going to be okay, I won't be able to find a reason to keep trying and keep fighting.  And I'm fighting, remember?  This is my fight, too."
"But the question is, Harry, do you trust me with this?  Because if you don't, I will not be offended and I will not become involved.  I trust you, I think your judgement is good and your reasons and motive justified and well placed.  So should you just need me as someone to throw ideas at and receive counsel, that is fine."
"You too." Draco said, looking intensely into Harry's eyes for a few moments, then turned to walk back through the woods.
Draco shook his head, hoping his cheeks didn't colour.  As much as he spent his youth bragging about how well off his family was, he was spending his adult years alternating between being glad of how much money he now had for himself and ashamed that it was money that his father and grandfather had acquired from doing Merlin knows what.
Draco swallowed too fast, coughed on the chip he was trying to eat.  It took him a few moments and a couple wipes of his eyes before he could speak again, and he answered honestly.
Draco shouted over the indignant shrieks and screams and insults of the Lady Black as he and Harry, accompanied by a worried looking Kreacher, hauled her portrait down the stairs into the depths of the basement.
He'd gotten home from work about an hour earlier and had found something to eat before settling on the couch to turn on the television.  Just as he got comfortable, there was a flash of red in his fireplace and a letter shot out onto the floor.
“Ron!”  Hermione whipped her head around to look at the other boy accusingly.  “Did you not just hear what Harry said about not underestimating the enemy?  He's absolutely right!”
"Malfoy... Hey, c'mon."  Harry shifted up off the other boy, giving his arms a yank to get him to his feet.  "We gotta get out of here."  He glared over at Myrtle who looked like the cat who ate a canary, ready to start shouting at any moment and draw more people into this.
Draco's mouth snapped shut with an audible click and grind of teeth as his face flamed in colour and he bent to pick up his books, straightened his robes and moved to the east side of the tower.  He did not thank Harry, he considered the fact that he didn't call him names or tell him to leave the tower so he could work alone thanks enough.
"Just because something is 'nuts' doesn't mean it can't happen.  Did you mean it when you said we couldn't keep doing it?"
He opened a drawer and stuffed it inside, hoping that the Room of Requirement would hide this for him as well.
“DRACO won the war!  If it hadn't been for him...  If he hadn't done what he did... It was him!  HE WON IT ALL!  How can you not understand how important it is to find him!?”  He had shouted this and much much more directly at the Minister for Magic.  Kingsley was in the middle of a meeting when Harry had burst into the room.  Wild eyed and absolutely on a tear, utterly oblivious to anyone else in the room he had raved at him about Draco for ten minutes before he finally had to have people remove him from the room.
"You know I can't do that."  Narcissa let out a sigh of her own, shifting on the chair she was sitting in to look towards the fire.  "Even if I'd like to, you know I can't."
With time passing, Harry and Draco have been meeting to talk about what should be done next.  Draco wishes he could just fly away somewhere altogether and is surprised that Harry of all people knows exactly what he means.  They're getting closer by leaps and bounds, but neither of them can shake the fact that time is running out.
He hadn't wanted to stick around.  The world he knew, though free, was bleak looking ahead for him.  He knew that trials would happen.  He knew that his father for sure and likely his mother would be sent to Azkaban.  There was a small chance he might be as well, though he had a higher suspicion he wouldn't be.  And if he wasn't sent to Azkaban he wasn't going to stand trial.  He knew that seemed backwards, but it was the truth.
"Malfoy...  I gotta ask..." Harry started, then stopped again when Draco's head jerked around and the blonde boy glared at him.
"You look good like this.  And totally out of your depth." Draco whispered to Harry,  shifting to press his hips up a bit, which pulled a groan from the dark haired boy.
The young man reappeared in just enough time for Draco to have started contemplating walking out, carrying a slim box and beckoning Draco towards the counter.
Harry laughed, shaking his head and dropping the quill to wave his hands a bit.  “Nothing of the sort.  Scorpius is a great kid.  I’m far more concerned about what my own children are up to that I don’t know about than suspecting Scorpius of any wrong doing.”
He gushed on about deciding he needed to start acting like he didn't care, and that he wanted to be friends with Malfoy.  That he'd needed to make it look as believably as possible otherwise he'd never get anywhere.  And oh he was just SO sorry and could she and Ron EVER forgive him...
"I must say," Dumbledore said after a few solid minutes of silence, lowering his hands and smiling at bit at Harry.  "Between the two of you, you've actually come up with some very good ideas.  They are not fool proof, but nothing we do in this situation is.  Nothing we could plan would be without risk, and so the best course of action is simply the one that seems to have the least amount of risk."
Draco stayed quiet for a few moments, then let out a long low sigh.  If this was a test from Voldemort, he was absolutely going to fail right this second.  "I don't really know what side I'm on."  Draco said, shifting a little uncomfortably.  Half of him screamed at him to shut up, while the other half was so happy he had said it out loud.
“Not a clue.”  Draco said, smiling as he slid off the stool and went to the front door, tucking the envelope full of cash into the front pocket of one of his coats.  “But I'll figure it out as I go.  Television has been teaching me a lot.  About phones and the internet and apps...”
“It's safer if you can't do magic.  People can't trace you as easily.”  Harry took the wand from Draco but didn't put it in his pocket.  He turned it over thoughtfully in his hands as he watched the other man.  “You'll learn how to do things the Muggle way, it won't take you long to catch on.”
"It's actually not half bad."  Paul said as though he couldn't believe he had to say those words at all.  "You've got a perfect bake, your flavours are spot on.  I'm not sure I like a coffee cake as a wedding cake but it does all work together.  Good effort."
"Nothing is where the book says it's supposed to be!' Draco yelled, pointing first at the book and then out the window.
He would much rather lock the doors on the Manor and take his chances.  It was easier.  And... more comfortable...  In a lot of ways.
"I'm guessing that it's all hidden somewhere in the house."  Harry said, resting his hands on the back of one of the chairs across from Hermione's desk.  Pointedly not sitting and demonstrating that he wasn't planning to stay.  "The dust that is there makes me think no one cleaned for awhile when it was Voldemort's headquarters and then Lucius and Narcissa decided to bundle up all their most precious things and hide them against the idea that maybe one day they'd get out of Azkaban."
A rush of heat flooded him as his hips jutted forward and he could feel Harry's pressed into him.  Feel HIM pressed against him, that hard flesh that matched his own grinding into him, sending tingles through his limbs as he ground back.
“Have you put other people like me in not nice neighbourhoods?”  Draco turned his head a bit, enough to look up at Neville from the corner of his eye.  “Seems counter productive if you have.”
He nodded, fiddling with the quill he had been using to mark with before she came in.  He did know it was out of the ordinary.  And part of him knew this was something he could have handled over owl if he’d wanted to.  But he hadn’t wanted to.  He wanted to talk to Draco face to face.
“You think?”  Harry said as he followed him inside, both of them walking almost on autopilot to the place where the Vanishing Cabinet was, thumping down onto one of the worn couches with a sigh.  “I honestly believed he was really a Death Eater.”
Then Harry took him into a grocery store, talking quietly as he showed him how to take a cart and physically push the stupid thing up and down the aisles, selecting what you wanted and putting them in the cart.  And as if that wasn't enough, when you got to the front of the store, you had to pick up every last item out of your cart again and put it on a moving counter for the shop worker to touch and.. 'scan' Harry had said, before someone else crammed all your food into bags and you handed over money.
Draco watched the other man, who was not good at hiding his feelings, so he saw the annoyance, the brief hint of anger and then the reluctant acceptance pass over his features before he spoke again.  “Fine.  But you know they aren't going to get better unless you actually talk to someone about them.”
Harry was sitting cross legged in the deep frame of a tall window, looking out across the grounds while a thunder storm raged outside.  He'd taken to spending a lot of time sitting there and in other spots around the castle to save himself endless hours in the Gryffindor common room.
“This is my house.”  Draco said, still speaking in a whisper and looking more and more scared.  “You can't be here, what if someone see's you?  How did you even get in??”
Just a little bit about the 'ring' that I want to say because I don't know if it will get explained in detail at any point-
Tom was smiling just a bit when Harry looked up to his face.  His eyes curious and calculating as he watched him.  “You're really quite angry with him.”
“This is actually your house?”  He eventually asked, slowing as they stepped into what was clearly the grand entrance to the place.  “Wow...  I mean I assumed it was annoyingly posh, but I had no idea...”
He could tell as he spoke that this time, at least, while talking in a self depreciating way that made his skin crawl, that he'd managed to say something that was alright.  The young man seemed to warm to him then, and much to Draco's dismay a look of obvious pity crossed his face.
And thus the letter, which was never actually intended for Harry to read, was sailing through the skies towards him.
Harry pulled the deed from his pocket, holding it up like he was giving the manor a chance to read it.  Smiling a bit, he stepped forward and mounted the steps.
It took a little bit and a lot of blinking before his eyes adjusted and he took in Mimir, looking up at him in obvious exasperation (Owls have a way with showing emotion, he swore to that) as he held out his leg to him with a folded parchment tied to it.
“In third year Fred and George Weasley gave me a magical map of Hogwarts.  It shows the castle and the grounds and every person in it has a tiny labelled dot that moves as they move.  So just by looking at it I could find anyone and know where they are.”
Harry hissed out softly in parseltongue, smiling almost lovingly at the snake that immediately relaxed, seeming to ripple against Draco's forearm and move it's head towards Harry's finger then instead of away from it.
As the shaking finally started to ease, Draco stretched out first his legs then his arms, turning to look at the clock.
But even though they were alone, they were trying not to look like they were doing anything untoward.
“Oh..”  Draco faltered slightly, surprised to hear Harry mention the names of two of his Slytherin classmates.  “I'm not NOT friends with them if that counts for anything?  Why...?”
Harry closed the small distance between them, resting a hand on his shoulder and bending so he could tip his head and see into Draco's downturned face.  "Nothing's going to hurt you in here so long as you leave it alone.  And stay away from the Acromantulas."
"You don't know."  Draco said quietly, squeezing the other boy's hands.  "You may never know... What everything has meant to me.  All of it."
"Looks like it."  Harry said, his eyes turned down, looking at Draco's pale fingers against him, his own hand sliding more firmly onto the back of his hip.  "But you should talk to Snape.  We need more information."
They were sitting in a small restaurant half a block from Draco's flat.  Harry had marched him up and down streets in the area repeatedly until Draco was no longer disoriented and could find his way around easily.
"Get married and raise a family." Draco said, confirming Harry's suspicions that this was just like what everyone else said.
“I got too caught up in the idea of all of you needing to navigate this world that I just... Fell into looking at everything as what you could learn and how you could assimilate.  It shouldn't be up to me if you or any of the others function and behave exactly like a Muggle would.  I should just be focusing on making sure that you have what you need when you need it.  It's just...”
“We're just covering all bases.  Everyone, not just you, who's been put into protection is getting the same run throughs, the same information and the same tours, just to make sure you're all comfortable enough to go ahead and experience life on your own.”
Chapter Summary -  Potter is sending him owls.  Potter is sending him incredibly RUDE owls.  But he's also inviting him out, just to talk...  And that doesn't sound so bad, actually.
"Well you do."  Harry said, his voice a little more gentle after Draco spoke.  "You're a friend to me now.  Friends work out problems together.  But even really good friends still have to at least give each other a heads up about what's wrong.  I was crap at Divination, you know."
“Well it would go a lot faster if you ACTUALLY helped Harry and I.”  Hermione said rather hotly, slamming her book shut and shoving it away before picking up another. She opened it at the beginning, flipping through the title pages before she paused.
Neville poured two cups of coffee, sliding one down towards Draco before he turned, resting back against the counter as he sipped from the other.
"Defence Against the Dark Arts."  Harry said, scooping up the ball of parchment on Draco's desk, tossing it into the air to catch it for himself.  "Potions, when I had Snape's old textbook."
"I need to go deliver McGonagall's message."  Draco said abruptly, turning without another word to head up the stairs.  He was thoroughly rattled and needed to think about all of this.
“I completely understand.  And I want Draco to understand the problem I feel Scorpius is facing which is why I don’t want to chance writing an owl to him and have him misunderstand the tone I’m speaking in.  Because he could read it completely differently than I intended, given our rather colourful past.”
"Making out in the Ministry hallway? I kind of agree."  Harry smirked, but the expression faded as he saw the frown on Draco's face deepen again.  "What did you mean?"
Or would it have been nothing?  Teenage 'passion' tended to be as easily overblown as candles on a birthday cake.
It ignores a good deal of what the “Epilogue” led us to believe, though some parts I’m keeping because it adds to the story. If you love the Epilogue and everything it represents don’t read this. ;) )
“I suppose that's true.”  Draco said, then nodded, taking out the envelope of cash that Harry had brought him, asking how much it was and then clumsily counting out the money for him.
"You.... didn't tell me what you thought me talking to Snape was..."  Draco said haltingly, all too aware of how close they were still standing together.  That he could still feel Harry's breath against him as the other boy chuckled.
"I didn't, I just followed my Patronus.  I didn't even know I could do that while apparating, but..." He trailed off, raising one shoulder in a half shrug.
Draco only got half a word out before he saw Harry's wand point at him, heard him speak but didn't catch the words as his entire body felt wrapped in ropes.  He struggled to get free and slid off the chair onto the floor.
"I'll take it."  He said, pulling his money out.  He counted Galleons onto the counter and waited while Borgin swept the coins up and deposited them into the till.
"When Dumbledore came to get me, he took me to see him.  Had to convince him to come back to Hogwarts."
He startled then, sitting up quickly and making Harry jump.  His cheeks flooded as he looked at the other man, swallowing thickly and then forcing out a chuckle as he reflexively raised his hands to his hair to smooth down.
He waited until he was sure the other boy was well gone before he took in a deep breath, held it for a moment then let it out in a rush.
After a session with Dumbledore the night after they return, Harry once again ventures into the Slytherin Dungeons to find Draco and catch him up with some very interesting information.
It was brutally hard, they fought each other just as much as worked together.  Teeth and tongues clashing and pressing and searching and biting and forcing low noises from both of them.  Draco’s hand fisted tightly in Harry’s hair.  One of Harry’s hands slid down, squeezing the back of Draco’s thigh just under his ass.
He'd felt absolutely agonizing guilt for having let five years pass without doing anything.  Five years he could have been looking for Draco.  But he'd had to step back.  He'd had to take that break and once he'd actually started to rest, he'd realized just how badly he did need it.
“And specifically asked to be assigned to your protection detail.”  Harry said, smiling as he rocked back on his heels.  “We both assumed you recognized him.”
“Oh.”  He said the one syllable as a sour look crossed his face once he had the door open.  It wasn't Neville.  It was Harry.
Draco frowned, turning his head slightly as he regarded Harry uneasily.  “I’m sorry, I would have thought you’d find a little relief in a child of mine being wary of the Dark Arts.” He spoke stiffly, his spine seeming to straighten up a little more and make him taller and slightly haughty in his manner.
“What are you doing?”  Harry asked, still wary and not wanting to admit what he had spent his time in the memory thinking about.
“This would do it.”  Harry said, running a hand over the side of the Cabinet, still not quizzing Draco any further about it.  “But if it's broken I can understand not wanting to even give it a shot...  If you got stuck, then what...”
Setting it down on the coffee table, he was just about to start poking at the buttons when he heard a scuffle outside.  Scuffles were not out of the ordinary.. not really.  People got angry, people shouted, people sang drunk in the street outside the building, but this time he was quite sure he heard his name.
"I'm just thinking, Harry."  Dumbledore said and Harry saw his chin bob as he nodded.  "Just thinking, give me a moment."
“But..”  Draco hesitated, an almost calculating look on his face.  Much like the one he had affected at the start of the year when he and Harry were just finding their feet in friendship.  “He did kill your parents....”
"It is.." Harry agreed, nodding a couple of times.  "Have you heard Snape out when he's talked to you about it?"
Alright so...  We're just going to jump right into the action here, no reason to delay things moving forward.  Let's goooooo!
They had both risked everything, absolutely everything, to try and stay in sparse contact with each other since the end of Year 6.  Harry used a shoddy replica of the coins Hermione had made for the DA, his magic no where near as good as hers, but it worked.
“Perfect.”  Harry happily moved the few steps to catch up with the other boy, falling in beside him.  “I don't think there's anywhere else in Hogwarts I'd feel comfortable discussing all of this.”
"Whatever she has to say, whatever she's mad about.  You aren't alone.  You have me here and I'll fight for you if I have to..."
As mad as he was, as absolutely rage filled as he was right then, Draco couldn't help but laugh.  It was a tight noise that seemed reluctant to come from him, but it forced it's way out all the same.
They sat silently in the sitting room, both mulling over their own thoughts, though they were very similar thoughts.  Draco knew the underlying message in his mother saying she couldn't not be here at Malfoy Manor.  She said very clearly she couldn't not be here.  But he didn't have to be.  She was saying she'd find any way she could to make sure he didn't have to live here with his father coming back.
And he remembered Longbottom (Was that REALLY Neville?  He was still struggling with that.) laughing at what he had said the day before.  And him bringing him the bubble tea that morning.  And teaching him the television remote.
Certainly, he hadn't forgotten the feelings, but he'd forgotten he'd written it.  Forgotten that at one point in time he was desperate to tell Harry.  To be completely and totally honest with him.  As time went on he'd changed his mind about wanting to say it.  Changed his mind about that level of honesty.  He'd never written it in another letter....
"I wish I had more to tell you, I really do.  But this, what happened here, and a trip to see the Gaunt's in some rather unfortunate circumstances were all that he's shown me so far."
“You don't have to know how to use it to have it.  Having it gives you the opportunity to learn it.  I mean... If I'm constantly looking to TEACH you things I should definitely be more encouraging towards you using the internet.  It's an absolutely massive part of the Muggle world.”  Harry said, smiling a little more brightly.
Re-telling in AU what happens when Harry finds Draco in the bathroom in book six. It wasn't supposed to be a chaptered fic but as I was writing it I realized there was no way to say everything in one part. So we'll see where it takes us!
"Yeah?"  Draco asked, looking down at Harry.  He smiled when the dark haired boy nodded.  "Well..  My mother is a good mother, just not the kind to make things."
Snape jerked his head towards the door, then turned on his heel to stalk towards it without another word.  With a sigh of exasperation, Draco followed.  He didn't know if this would be about being there with Harry, or about the task Voldemort had set him.  But either topic wasn't one Draco felt like getting into.
“Harry..”  Draco said, looking worriedly and pleadingly at the other boy, glancing at Tom for a moment then back at the boy next to him.  “He didn't, really.  It had to be done.”
"It wasn't a dream, not really.  He was using the connection between us and.. magic, obviously, to manipulate things the way he wanted them to be."
Tom finally broke his gaze from Draco to get to his feet, smoothing out his hair as he smiled at the two boys.  “I must go.  But we'll be in touch.”
That seemed to startle Draco back into the present and a normal frame of mind, which was that this was a STRANGE and nonsense conversation to be having with Harry fucking Potter.
“Your wand, please, Draco.”  Harry held his hand out to the other man, the slight curve of his lips turning into a full smile.  “As you agreed.”
“Hm?”  Tom looked from Draco to Harry, his eyes narrowing a bit as he saw the murderous look on Harry's face.  “I beg your pardon.”
Harry said nothing for a few moments as he looked at the contents of the drawer.  Dozens and dozens and dozens of folded letters were inside of it.  Enough that it looked overfull, looked like Draco was going to run out of room in it soon.
There was, however, one person that knew Draco had to be alive.  He didn't know where he was, didn't know what had happened to him, but he KNEW Draco had been alive at the end of the war and he never second guessed that knowledge.  It angered him beyond belief that Draco's disappearance was just passed off.  That he faded from people's minds and memories without a second thought.  That no one seemed to CARE that he was just gone.

There was a a few cakes that absolutely rivalled his in appearance, and a few more that were definitely better flavour choices and combination.  He was making some mental notes as they went through, things he liked the idea of and things that sounded good.  He listened to what the judges said (Prue more than Paul, to be honest) and took it all into consideration as well.
Neville had taught him things, but aside from the cooking lesson which he needed to give him a fuller explanation of, he didn't push knowledge and information on him without being asked first.
Executive he was, much like Dean had been.  Wearing such tailored suits, talking absolute drivel with his co-workers, caring about things that he never thought he'd care about.
He smiled when Draco laughed, sliding his hand under the table where no one would see, giving Draco's thigh a warm squeeze before he got up and walked back across the Great Hall.
--Along with Inktober, it is Fictober! Following a prompt list from Tumblr I'm going to write short fics based around those prompts. A friend doing the same is titling each fic with the prompt so I'm totally copying that. ;)
But he had pressed his lips together, fisting his hand around his spoon until his knuckles turned white, then turned to her and let everything out in a rush that he had been rehearsing in his head.  Apologizing over and over again, trying to explain, while pretending to be worried about who might be listening in, that he hadn't known any other way.  That she and Ron had started out so dismissive about Draco and what he'd been doing at Borgin and Burkes in the summer that he had to come up with a plan of his own because he just
He broke from Harry's lips when it was impossible to breath in small breaths around his mouth, needing to gasp and draw in deeper panting breaths.  He rested forehead to forehead with the other boy, looking straight into his dark eyes as his hips lurched and everything in him pulled.  He moaned a long guttural noise, his legs squeezing around Harry, his hands pulling in his hair as his hard length throbbed and he came hard and fast, pulling from so deep it was almost painful.  It was only a moment between him and when Harry tipped and he groaned a completely different and far more primal noise as he felt Harry's length flex against him in his release just as long and hot as his own had been.  His skin felt like fire and Harry's felt like it was scorching him where they touched.
