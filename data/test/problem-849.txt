The students watched him almost as much as the professors. In particular, Harry noticed he constantly had one of the Slytherin boys’ attention on him at any given moment. He didn’t think they went so far as to schedule who would watch Harry when, but whenever he looked their way, one of them was looking back. His stomach fluttered each time it was Draco who caught his eye. He tried not to preen too much if it happened while a professor was complimenting his spell work. If there was one upside to the whole nightmare it was that he was hopefully impressing Draco. But even with that unforeseen benefit, the attention from everyone was starting to get to him. It was stressful and bordering on annoying considering he felt like he never got a moment of peace between the students and professors. Harry reluctantly felt guilty as he wondered if this was what he’d made Draco feel all year… not that he’d stop watching him any time soon.
I hope the whole lube thing came across as more humorous than skeezy given Harry’s age. But I figure if they could ask for anything (besides freedom), someone would ask for lube. Some of the men wouldn’t care who saw them (Mulciber) and others might have just been desensitized to it (Lestrange bros who spent a good portion of their adult life in Azkaban where they had no privacy). Seemed realistic to me.
“Potter is hiding something. How do we know that Burke actually assaulted him? Mr. Hale, you filled out forms to collect a memory of this event, but none were submitted,” Runecraft stated.
“Seems Jugson agrees with the boy,” stated Lucius. As one, they turned to watch Jugson leave the shower area. Unlike Harry, he didn’t seem bothered by his nakedness and walked casually around the room until he found one of the remaining uniforms.
Once they were all satisfied with the outline – though Harry was still very nervous – Harry did help Nott with Defense. It worked well considering it gave Harry ideas on what he could include in his own assignments for Snape. In return, Nott and Harry briefly went over the introductory alchemy Harry picked up from Albert. Nott promised to give him a couple of books to help him continue with his studies. Seeing Harry’s less than enthusiastic expression at book learning, Nott promised to go over the content with him as well. Harry happily agreed and was even looking forward to it despite being overworked while he caught up on his missed school assignments.
“Please tell me it’s the Appleby Arrows,” Nott stated. Harry turned his incredulous expression towards Nott feeling even more confused. He had just begun to think that Nott was alright, even if the man was a death eater. Harry couldn’t figure out why Nott was focused on quidditch instead of saying something supportive to his friend. Or even an acknowledgement that the situation sucked balls.
The Lestrange brothers were playing a game. It took Harry a couple of minutes to figure out it was a wizarding variant of the muggle
Needing a distraction while the other prisoners slept, Harry once again turned to the rocks that lined his cell. He spent a good five minutes just rolling one between his hands as he once again debated whether he ought to perform magic when he knew it was using up Burke’s soul. Every time he glanced at the mirror that he made, which rested on his bed, Harry felt nothing but pure want. Magic was a part of him. He wasn’t going to give it up, consequences be damned.
The voice started laughing at his own joke but it sent an uneasy feeling twisting in Harry’s abdomen. He was already postponing the piss he had to take due to feeling a little awkward. But that would be manageable. His back would be to Malfoy and Nott and it probably won’t be any different to using a public urinal. But what was he supposed to do when he had to shit? There was no way to avoid doing so in full view of two men. Harry considered that perhaps he should start skipping meals and cut down on how often that embarrassment had to happen…
“As if I didn’t know you’ve seen your judicial-wizard. You got that snake to send it,” Burke’s face had grown increasingly red as he accused Albert.
“Potter... thanks,” Crabbe said and held his hand out towards Harry. Harry grasped it expecting Crabbe to offer a simple handshake, but Crabbe used his hold to drag Harry to his feet. Once he was standing, Crabbe enveloped him in a hug.
Of course, Harry had to be more upfront about the Dursleys when he eventually rejoined his friends. Ron, Hermione, Neville and Ginny all trailed him to the dorm room for some privacy.
Nott helped him research the rest of the day, thought he was careful to hide that fact from Hermione once she and Ron returned. A couple of hours later, Harry recalled that Lucius had to keep his mirror small most of the time so the guards wouldn’t find it. Harry didn’t know if that would prevent a connection or at least make it harder to hear when Harry tried to call. He slipped a note to Nott explaining this potential complication. He got another raised eyebrow in return, but Nott went to collect a book on shrinking charms. Hermione thought nothing of it, but Harry didn’t know if that was because she didn’t care what Nott was up to or if she, understandably, did not see how it was connected to Harry’s current research interests.
“What is everyone so excited about?” Burke asked but all of the men around him had gone quite. “Come now, the boys were just telling me that they haven’t ever heard you lot quite so rowdy. I just had to come see for myself what got you all excited.”
It wasn’t any easier for Harry to speak about his experiences in Azkaban, even though he’d had practice from speaking to his friends and Hale. Fortunately, Harry was able to focus more on the official policies and only tied in his personal experiences to highlight some of the negative impacts they had on prisoners. Lance recorded everything using the same sort of quill Hale used during their meetings. Harry was reassured that it would be accurate, unlike Rita’s embellishment quill. When they were done, Lance surprised him by suggesting there will be multiple articles printed from this one interview. Harry was worried that meant he wouldn’t get out of the spotlight any time soon, though he understood how it would be hard to cover all the problems in one article.
And that was at the heart of their offer. Harry knew that if he let these men teach him spells, even more dark curses, it would be better than being left to his own thoughts. He didn’t want to dwell on what Ron, Hermione and the others might be faced with. His mind conjured images of Hermione strapped in the chair with chains, or Ron being dragged past Harry’s cell before he got his own cell down the hall. Worst was the hint of resentment that he was the only one here, but he tried his best to squash those thoughts before they festered. But that left room for thoughts about the guards and dementors to filter in. Harry didn’t want to picture Burke’s face as he tattooed Harry or the smirk he gave that just promised there was more horrid things in store.
As they waited for the rest of the wizengamot to arrive and take their seats, Hale continued to update Harry on what had happened in the last few days. He told Harry what he hadn’t wanted to say in front of the aurors. It reminded Harry that he was still carrying Albert’s letter that would hopefully help with the man’s trial, but as he was tied to a chair and had tons of eyes on him, Harry didn’t know how he was going to pass it over.
“If you’re ready, I’ll get the guards to give me my wand so that I can retrieve your memory of the guards’ assault on Albert. They will insist on being in the room for that, but we do not have to tell them which memory you are giving me,” Hale explained.
“You want a kiss, hmm?” Burke angrily asked. Harry was sure he was annoyed that Harry didn’t appear as rattled as he wanted. It probably didn’t help that Harry’s enemies were laughing with Harry at Burke’s expense rather than vice versa. “I could arrange to leave the door open, so you can greet the dementors properly yourself.”
Once dressed, Harry noted that his sweater didn’t cover his Azkaban serial number. It made him nervous, but short of committing to an entire wardrobe of turtlenecks, there wasn’t anything he could do. With his shoulders hunched, made his way to the owlery. He had some letters to deliver and it would be best to do so before anyone noticed and asked questions.
“Thank you,” he tried to tell Hale, but his voice was drowned out by the cheers from the news and spectators allowed to attend the trial. Hale must have seen the sentiment on Harry’s face regardless. They smiled at each other, and Hale gave Harry a few comforting pats on his shoulder.
“Oh, hi Stan,” Harry said as he breathed a sigh of relief that Neville wasn’t in here with him. Harry couldn’t imagine how Neville would fare if faced with Burke’s tender mercies.
Both Albert and Lucius were infuriated on Harry’s behalf every time a memory involving one of the Dursleys came up. After seeing how uncomfortable Harry was, they tried to tone down their reactions, but they couldn’t mask their anger. The first time Albert had seen Vernon toss then lock Harry in the cupboard, the man had sworn up a storm commenting on how he would just land himself back in Azkaban for murdering them. Lucius periodically asked Harry if he wanted to talk about it, but respected Harry’s continuous refusal. The man had even grudgingly admitted that “some Weasleys weren’t so bad” after he’d seen the memory where Fred, George, and Ron had pulled off the bars from Harry’s window and took him away in a flying car. Harry overheard them roping Mulciber into their revenge plans when they thought Harry wasn’t paying attention. Harry had mixed emotions about it. He was moved that they not only cared but were actively planning how to prevent the Dursleys from hurting him again. However, these men were more likely to do more permanent damage than Fred and George’s ton-tongue toffees.
“Draco’s a big boy. He can make his own decisions about whether or not he wants to go somewhere private with Potter,” Zabini said. Harry didn’t know if Zabini was trying to be suggestive, or if Harry’s mind naturally turned in that direction when it came to Draco, but he pictured a few other reasons for why he and Draco would go somewhere private.
For a few minutes, the others were quiet as they absorbed the news. Eventually some of the men started guessing at what Draco’s task could be. Each suggestion seemed to worry Malfoy no matter how outrageous it seemed.
“Hands on the table, Potter,” Wiblin ordered. Harry was mortified as he was patted down to make sure Reginald hadn’t sneaked him some contraband items. Once satisfied, the guards spelled Harry’s hands behind his back. As Wiblin was pulling him from the room, Harry heard the click of a picture being taken. Both Harry and the guard turned to look at Reginald who had the camera pointed at them. Harry didn’t like it, but trusted Reginald by now. The reason Reginald took his picture at the start of the interview was because Harry was still tense and uncomfortable. That would come through in the pictures. Harry was tense again because Wiblin was holding him tightly. It brought back bad memories. However, at the click of the camera, the guard loosened his hold. He was more cautious as he led Harry back to his cell.
After a moment, Harry decided he was too tired of Azkaban not to take the chance. He didn’t know if Dumbledore, and likely Ron and Hermione were making any strides in getting him released. If Nott could help by gaining public sympathy for him, it would probably help Dumbledore more than hinder him.
“Do you know why you survived the killing curse?” Draco asked one day. It was one of the many questions he’d asked in relation to his research, but it was the first one Harry understood could be connected to soul magic theory.
“No. I lived with the worst human being to ever live. As much as you might have followed his footsteps in making a horcrux, you are nothing like him,” Draco reassured.
“Do you want to continue our conversation here or keep moving?” he asked. Harry didn’t really mind having Draco and Nott watching them. If Sirius had been given a trial, Harry would have spied on anyone providing information for his case too. Harry probably wouldn’t have kept a respectful distance either. Unfortunately, Draco and Nott weren’t the only people to consider.
“Scars?” Harry questioned and looked back towards his soul. He supposed calling the almost empty spaces scars were as close as they could get to explaining it. The thin strands moving from one section to another did seem to be trying to stitch itself back together.
“Yes, Albus, I do,” he again puffed out his chest importantly. Under different circumstances Harry might be amused by the man’s peacock impression. As it was, Harry’s stomach was in knots and he was desperately wishing that Professor Dumbledore will be able to get him out of this.
“I propose a trade. Apparently, my father was teaching you introductory Alchemy. I can help you continue your studies. In turn, you can help me with Defense,” Nott proposed.
?” Harry hissed. “Bellatrix is the one killing off her family members. If anyone is a blood traitor, it is her.”
“Thank you,” Lestrange said. He sounded sincerely grateful. The sense of longing in his voice made the others uncomfortable though they could empathize.
,” Harry said. Harry had no idea if the taboo was still in place, but thought he’d be cautious while Neville was visiting.
“Not the things that truly count,” Draco reassured firmly. As friendly as he and Draco had become, he wasn’t used to the other man so blatantly complimenting him. He found he rather liked it and hoped Draco meant what he said.
“I’m well aware that Hogwarts’ professors don’t adequately cover it. With the amount of misinformation that circles around the dorms, it is best to ensure you’re fully prepared when any sexual activities occur,” Lucius pushed though the awkwardness he felt. “Have you learnt the cleaning-”
“Found him, just, er, hold on,” Harry said. He magically packed his books and notes in the bag, but left the map and mirror out. It was probably safer to cancel the spell on the mirror until he and Draco were in a safe space, but Harry feared that he wouldn’t be able to reconnect. So instead, Harry hid the mirror up his sleeve. He also kept the map activated as he would need to confirm which direction Draco moved in once he was back inside. He would have to rely on his wandless magic to cancel both spells if he was caught.
Lucius didn’t respond as he was too busy hissing and jumping back from shower. Harry felt the water temperature in his stall suddenly drop a second later. Harry tried to quickly rinse off the remaining soap on his body as the water was quickly becoming ice cold.
Harry must not have concealed his own concern, or pity, because Nott stated, “Severus is sure to help him, Lucius”, but he was watching Harry intently.
Given the minister's visit, Lucius was keen to go over the finer points of politics. While Harry was onboard to complain about Fudge and Scrimgeour's failings, he found the historical perspective Lucius provided to be dry. He tried to focus. He knew that it was useful information given the oppositional stance he had with the ministry now. Unfortunately, the subject couldn't hold his interest for long. Fortunately he wasn't the only one.
Harry had few memories of Theodore Nott that stood out in his mind. He settled for the time he realized that Nott was able to see thestrals. Nott looked uncomfortable being the center of attention, but Albert appreciated Harry’s gift nonetheless.
“I know just the place for you, Potter,” said Burke. There was such a self-satisfied tone to his voice that Harry thought the man must have known Harry was going to be arrested and brought straight to Azkaban.
“Oh, I already feel so angry. All the time,” Andromeda confessed. “The fact that it was Bellatrix. That’s she’s gone too, and I won’t ever get my revenge... or an explanation as to why my
Snape insisted on both being present. That had to be the shortest interview of the bunch,” Ron explained.
“I’m happy to help where I can. Let me know if you want to know more about a particular policy. Or if you need help contacting key people,” Hale offered. “To be honest, I’m eager to see how you’ll shake things up.”
He spent some time levitating rocks again, but this time paying attention to how the magic felt. No longer feeling desperate, Harry grew bored of this task quickly. He took a self-indulgent break to stare at Draco’s picture using the mildest lumos he could cast. It eventually dawned on him that his behaviour bordered on creepy, so he focused on creating pictures of his friends as well. As the memories came to him easily, he produced vibrant photos of them. It was bittersweet to see Ron, Hermione, Neville and Luna, but it was the photo of Ginny that made him pause. He still felt a flutter at seeing her smile. He still thought she was beautiful and strong. The thought of her with Dean still left a bad taste in his mouth. But all of those feelings paled in comparison to the longing he felt moments ago while looking at Draco’s photo.
Harry snorted. “Well, the summer before my third year, I accidentally blew up my uncle’s sister,” Harry stated and was amused by the intrigued expressions on Lucius’ and Nott’s faces. Nott even looked impressed until Harry clarified he meant blowing her up like a balloon and not into little pieces. Still, he complimented Harry’s fast thinking in using an alias when he went on the run.
“Because they no longer believe in witches and wizards. If they did, they would start burning us at the stake again,” stated Albert.
Aside from resuming their regular tutoring sessions, the other prisoners encouraged Harry to learn occlumency. He told them he was rubbish at it, but they insisted that he had too many secrets not to try. They were leagues better than Snape as a teacher as they took the time to explain the theory behind both occlumency and legilimency. Each man tried to teach him the methods and tricks that worked for them. Sadly, Harry had trouble applying them to his own mind. He couldn’t meditate with Burke’s soul making itself known whenever Harry was still for too long. He couldn’t empty his mind from all thoughts. He couldn’t hold a mental illusion long enough to serve as a barrier. Throwing about random unrelated thoughts and memories in order to prevent someone from easily finding the memory they were looking for worked for awhile, but eventually he lost control over what the person invading him mind could see. This unfortunately meant that both Albert and Lucius saw more than Harry wanted them to see.
“Shut your mouth before something happens to it,” threatened Harry. His mum and Bellatrix were nothing alike, and he found it vile to even compare the two.
“It occurred to me that we overlooked an important aspect of your processing, Potter,” Burke stated. Once he was sure that Harry was secure, Burke moved towards a cabinet on the side of the room. He grabbed a box and made his way back to Harry. He summoned a chair – one without chains – and sat down facing Harry.
Harry wouldn’t say his stay in Azkaban was comfortable, but he grew accustomed to the easy comradery he had with his fellow prisoners. He even became desensitized to having dementors constantly stop by and observe him. By the time Harry was herded into the showers again, he wasn’t as reluctant to disrobe. It helped that Burke wasn’t leering at him.
“How specific can the spell be?” wondered Harry. “Could I charm my glasses to let me know if someone was using Polyjuice, for example?”
“Yeah,” Ron said nervously. “I know you don’t like talking about it, but we hoped it would help your case or at least get the bitch fired.”
“So, Potter,” Malfoy stated as he tapped the bar to remove his empty tray. “I can’t imagine you’ll be here much longer.”
“I don’t know. I’ve come across one before, but I didn’t know what it was,” Harry said as he thought about the diary. “Although... it was sentient. And the one in me isn’t. So-” Harry suddenly felt hopeful, “so maybe I’m wrong. Maybe whatever this is, it isn’t a horcrux.”
. Harry didn’t need to look at Burke or Bradley to know that if he protested he’d probably still end up taking the picture but would probably also be sporting a black eye.
It didn’t take long for a medi-witch to come and fuss over him. She said his vitals looked good, but that wasn’t what caught his attention.
Harry wasn’t completely sure about Malfoy’s assessment. If whoever planned this was smart enough to keep him out of Dumbledore’s reach then surely they were able to plan ways to use that time to get the public on their side.
“Now, you can take the rest of the afternoon to get your bearings. I’m sure Professor Flitwick and Professor Snape would understand if you don’t join their classes today,” he sounded amused, knowing that Harry wouldn’t be in any rush to rejoin Snape’s class nor would the professor be to have him. “I hope you’re feeling up to attending your classes tomorrow?”
“Some place where it’s legal to do soul magic,” Draco answered quickly. He’d have to jump through some hoops for any study that involved children, but it would be possible. He mentally ran through the experts he knew to figure out which country might be the best if he needed help with the data. “Perhaps we can schedule a family trip to Albania, Romania, or Bangladesh? Or if you don’t like those options, there have been a couple of interesting studies that recently came from Mozambique and Latvia... or perhaps Ca-”
“Come now, Perkins. You know we can’t take any risks with such a high-profile prisoner,” Burke said trying to sound reasonable.
“It’s fine,” Harry said. Sure Mulciber was crude and inappropriate, but he didn’t give Harry the heebie-jeebies like Burke did.
As they moved past the main doors, Harry noted that no other guard was stationed there. He assumed the second guard with them was supposed to be at that post, but as Burke led him down the stairs, the guard followed.
"I don't know why this is even a question. Clearly the last animal should be a dragon," teased Mulciber. Harry rolled his eyes, thinking it was just a joke, but Crabbe and Avery were ok with that option.
“No matter what the results of your study are... I’ll keep putting you – our family – first,” Harry promised. He meant it to be reassuring, but Draco tensed against him.
“What’s wrong with your hand?” asked Nott, seemingly out of the blue. Harry blinked at him uncomprehendingly. “You told Scrimgeour it was a sign of the ministry’s corruption.”
“It’s beautiful,” Lucius remarked. Harry jerked his head up and noticed that the man was sitting up in his bed. He looked wide awake, so Harry knew he had watched Harry work for awhile.
Harry went right back to the library after he ate. Ron and Hermione dutifully followed him. They hadn’t even finished pulling out all of their books before someone pulled out the chair next to Harry and joined them.
“Move,” ordered the guard at the end of the hallway. The prisoners started shuffling forward in a single file. They headed in the opposite direction from where Harry entered this wing of the prison.
“Surely even Burke wouldn’t have...” the first newly arrived guard trailed off as he focused on Harry. The sheet was clenched in Harry’s hands over his lap. While the guards could tell he still had his shirt on, the bare leg not covered by the sheet spoke of the dark truth. The guards didn’t have to look far to spot a pair of Azkaban standard issue pants and trousers crumpled at the foot of the bed.
“It helps,” said Harry. He noted that his illusions on the older man were still holding strong. “I’m not sure how to explain. It’s like each spell releases some... pressure.”
Harry blinked in surprise. He hadn’t considered it mostly because he hadn’t been given the opportunity to make arrangements. He had hoped that Dumbledore had hired someone to work on his case, but with a sinking feeling, he realized the man had probably intended to represent Harry himself. Given how resistant the ministry was to Dumbledore at the moment, it was probably hindering Harry’s case more than helping.
“I see Belly’s flaws,” argued Lestrange.  Lucius looked as shocked as Harry felt. He hadn’t heard one negative word from Lestrange about his wife. “She snores
It wasn’t until he recognized one of the prisoners that Harry really started to panic. That man had been part of the department of mysteries fiasco. He had definitely been arrested that night. Harry’s eyes quickly snapped to the man in the next cell. Harry was pretty sure it was another death eater from that night. Across from him was Walden Macnair. Next was Crabbe’s father. Harry wondered if he blamed Harry for his arrest as much as his son did.
They were quiet as they all observed the baby. None of them could point to any physical sign of Ginny, and it did make them sad.
“They arrested me for the department of mysteries fiasco,” Harry answered. Malfoy raised his eyebrows but fortunately no one laughed. Harry suspected they probably were a little amused that he was now in Azkaban with them for incidents that occurred the same night most of them were arrested.
“You know I’ve done worse than childish pranks... though some of them were rather cruel,” Draco admitted. He remembered thinking himself clever, but in retrospect had been rather mean-spirited.
“What’s a horcrux?” asked Crabbe. He had been too caught up in his own terrible memories that he had missed Harry’s previous explanation. Seeing Harry’s reluctance to say it again, Albert filled in the others as best he could after only hearing one side of the conversation.
“Harry,” Nott said slowly. He was picking his words carefully. “I’m due to see my judicial-wizard soon. It is the only way we have to get messages out into the world. I’d like your permission to tell him about the blood quill... and about the tattoo.”
Andromeda was surprised, but willing to support him. Harry thought she was reluctantly hopeful about reconnecting with her family. As she watched Harry pushed through the first few hurdles, she told him she was grateful he didn't immediately give up when encountering resistance. Harry would be the first to admit he hadn't expected as much trouble as he got. Part of him thought his relationship with Kingsley would make the progress easy. Unfortunately, the minister wasn't eager to appear soft against Death Eaters so soon after the war.
Despite the man’s words, he was glancing at Harry’s neck and unable to completely mask his unease. Harry’s unease was also growing as it dawned on him that he might no longer be able to pursue his chosen career. Could someone with an Azkaban tattoo become an auror? Did he even still want it? Harry recalled his arrest and subsequent dash to Azkaban thanks to aurors who showed no interest in helping him. Harry had no desire to see them again, let alone work alongside them. Working in any branch of the ministry had never been so unappealing.
“I’m sorry too,” Harry said. “Not for freeing Dobby exactly, because he’s happier now... but I had a certain view of you and never let myself see anything beyond that.”
“Normally I would be reluctant to use memories in trials. The ministry is notorious for heavily questioning their authenticity. However,
“Of course,” Harry said. He hesitated, but didn’t know what else he could say or do. Defeated, Harry turned around and made his way back to his own table.
“What’s your plan?” asked Hermione. When Harry glanced up at her, he knew she was trying to be supportive.
“How... is-” Draco started but faltered and looked uneasy about whatever he wanted to ask. Harry waited for him to gather his thoughts. “He’s been there for months. People say... I’ve heard that it doesn’t take that long to... change...” Draco spoke in vague terms, but Harry knew what he meant. He too had heard horror stories about Azkaban long before he’d been sent there. Stories of people dying or going near catatonic after too much exposure to the dementors. Harry now wondered if the guards also played a hand in that. Sirius hadn’t talked about his experiences. The little he had shared with Harry hadn’t been good and Harry suspected that not much had changed in Azkaban over the past decade at least.
Lily jumped up and ran to the field, and James picked her up laughing and hugging her, before, kissing her right there in the middle of the field, in front of half the staff.
They reached the school and Harry sat for a moment. Does he kiss him? Will this happen again? What should he do? In classic Harry fashion, he didn't voice his concerns about what would happen next, and instead he shot out a quick "See you around" as he left the car to get into his own.
the reason i've choosen to upload this is because if i don't post it now the draft will no longer be here in 21 days. and my dad usually keeps my electronics forever, i hate it he should at least put an amount of time on the punishment, smh.
"Whatcha staring at their huh Harry"? The twins appeared from behind the bench laughing when they saw Harry jump.
"Yeah George, let's do that" And they bolted out the door, before they came back grabbed the ball, and kissed their mom on the cheek.
Truth be told it was really four days, without, anything huge. Except Thursday some Senior tripped Harry in the hall, but he'd probably had no idea who he had actually tripped. So on Friday Harry came into school ready for a normal day, it was normal at first. Normal in fact meant normal, nothing was different, girls still stared at him hoping to be with him, Ron and Hermonie talked with him daily, and his Soccer friends respected him, of course there was the weight of not holding his sexuality from everyone. Then again he had only hid it for two or three days before being forced out of the closet.
Harry smiled at his family his parents still deeply in love, and his siblings annoying at times, but who couldn't love them? It wasn't the right time to tell them why distrust the peace and love the family had. He had to wait awhile until he told them, now wasn't the right time.
The ongoing chorus of words going through his head, it's all Harry could think about. It seemed to be the Harry was living this double life where by day he was calm,cool, and collected, but by night, well, he was this new person all together, this person, who couldn't shake this boy out of his head, this horrible, mean, nasty,beautiful boy. Fuck. Draco fucking Malfoy, why couldn't he get him out of his head, this had happened before. It was like Harry was telling everyone-including himself-about how terrible, Draco was, but deep down he wanted to be with him all the day. He was telling himself that he didn't care about him, but just last night at practice, Draco had fallen forward onto his knee. Harry rushed over to check and see if he was okay, but was greeted with a mislay 'What do you care Potter' . Which shouldn't bother him, all he had been to Draco these past three years was Potter. But somehow Harry caught feeli-no he hadn't. There was no way in hell that Harry Potter was a poof, he had a girlfriend. Ginny. Now there was a big problem, a big piece of trouble slipping into the cracks, into Harry's life.
“I’m not suggesting adding a spa,” Harry snapped back. “But warmer clothes would be a good start,” he suggested in a calmer voice.
A low and gravelly voice asked him. It was accompanied by a rattling sound. Harry shivered but realized that the usual cold he feels in the presence of dementors had also receded. It was still cold, but it was just the general cold of Azkaban. Harry wondered what could be blocking the effects of the dementor before he registered that the men in the cells around him were moaning in misery. Harry hadn’t noticed until his own laboured breathing had calmed. Although Harry could no longer feel the effects of the dementors, it seemed like everyone else in the vicinity still could.
When Mrs. Weasley insisted he bring Draco over for a family meal, Harry did not have the strength to deny her. Draco was understandably nervous but marched to the burrow with his head held high. It was painfully awkward. Mrs. Weasley did her best to welcome him, but Mr. Weasley kept glaring at ‘that Malfoy boy’. His sons were a little less hostile, but just as suspicious. Even Ron and Hermione, who had insisted they would be OK with it long before Harry knew it was even a possibility, had difficulty letting go of the past. They tried, but talking about quidditch turned tense. Hermione and Draco’s intellectual debates turned mean. Even Harry’s desperate attempt to talk about the ridiculous price of vegetables had somehow resulted in an exchange of glares. It would have been a complete disaster if not for James.
“What are we going to do? There is no way we can cover this up,” said a guard. There was a short discussion amongst the guards about what their options were until one of them remembered where they were and who their audience was. “We should take this conversation to the main office,” he said.
“Yes. We have options, and we can figure it out when we’re ready,” Draco said. This time when he changed the subject, Lucius allowed it. Probably because he'd already made his point. Harry knew Draco did want more children, and Harry had to mentally prepare himself to give them to Draco without allowing Draco to take the health risks.
Hale was smirking as he put down the camera. It was such a smarmy lawyer look that Harry would have been worried had it been aimed at him. Luckily it was aimed at the guards that were standing nervously by the window watching the interview from the hallway.
“You know Weasley and Granger would give me a hard time if I mysteriously showed up and wanted to talk to you alone,” Draco pointed out.
Once Harry had also gone through a review for defense against the dark arts and transfiguration, Albert pointedly cleared his throat. “Perhaps we can focus on more practical spells?” he said.
“It’s less impressive when you also get a basilisk fang stuck in your arm,” Harry countered. “Though that did turn out to be a handy weapon. Got close to the diary and stabbed it with the fang. Figured if I was going to die, I might as well take him with me.”
“And the wizarding world is catching on,” Burke continued. “They know their supposed golden boy is tarnished. Why, you’re practically as dark as you-know-who.”
“Or, you’re not intelligent enough to grasp the brilliance of any verbal abuse I send your way,” came the haughty response from Lucius. Despite the words, Harry thought the two men were good naturedly teasing each other... mostly.
“They are shown, as you were,” Asherath explained. “They either eat or starve.” It sounded all the more cruel given Asherath’s matter-of-fact tone. Harry couldn’t help but wonder how many dementor babies ended up starving. As far as Harry would tell, the dementor population seemed low. Then again, Harry was able to feed and he wasn’t even a dementor.
“Unforgivable curse,” Harry admitted then launched into an account of what had happened. He was careful to avoid mentioning that he actually cast the curse and instead started his story from the moment the aurors had stepped into the great hall. He paced back in forth in his cell as he told his story. When he got to the part where they had arrived at Azkaban and he was told he’d stay here to wait his trial, Harry finally allowed himself to vent his frustrations and called the aurors a number of derogatory names.
Harry watched as Draco tapped absently over a part of his notes. While Draco probably wondered about how the mirror got there in the first place, the bigger mystery was why Harry incorporated blood magic into his spell. In order for that to work, it would require blood magic on both objects. Performing blood magic in Azkaban was even more improbable than somehow getting their hands on the mirror in the first place.
“Er, no,” Harry said embarrassed because he was technically guilty of the crime he was arrested for. “I just meant that the ministry is filled with morons.”
“Besides, your meetings with Nott were meant to cover his trial, not Potter’s,” stated another wizard.
Lucius’ voice wobbled a bit over Draco’s name, but he smirked at Harry after he spoke. Harry was surprised for a moment that Draco would have talked to his father about him, but realized that he probably sent letters home complaining about ‘Saint Potter’. Harry couldn’t imagine either of Draco’s parents being that interested but felt oddly pleased by the thought. Draco had frustrated Harry enough over the years that he felt smug satisfaction that he had been equally vexing for Draco.
“I’m not sure you’d want to try,” Lucius said. He elaborated when Harry looked confused, “not unless you were sure you wouldn’t also consume your own soul at the same time.” Harry had not thought of that possibility. He wondered if he’d end up an empty husk or if he’d end up as some dementor hybrid cursed to feed only on souls.
Perkins stepped back from Harry but kept a hand on Harry’s arm. Harry noticed that Bole had a similar hold on Hermione, though her hands weren’t tied behind her back.
get them to see his fellow prisoners as he did. The problems between them weren’t as personal. That wasn’t the case for Neville. The Lestrange brothers had been involved in the torture of Neville’s parents, which caused permanent damage. Harry couldn’t gloss over that or expect Neville to forgive them. Harry had gotten to see the better side of Rodolphus and Rabastian, but he had no right to ask Neville to do the same.
“Not easily,” Harry said. He couldn’t say wandless magic had allowed Harry to transfigure writing implements so Avery could draw the runes for him. Instead he told them that Avery explained their meanings to him.
“And you’re not going to say anything about it for my, Vince and Theo’s sakes,” Draco reasoned. He turned towards Harry and warned, “that might not be the case if you tell them anything unrelated to the mirrors.”
Jugson paused but didn’t move away. “Look, Burke will give me some perks if I mess the kid up. It’s not like we should be mollycoddling him considering everything,” Jugson said as he tried a new tactic.
Their friends sent congratulatory messages, a few made “about time!” jokes, and some insisted on scheduling celebratory dinners. As far as Harry could tell, they all approved and were happy for them.
“Not at all,” Hale reassured him. “It’s far from due process, but I had plenty to use from our interviews. In fact, it might have been a blessing that you didn’t have to go over all those painful memories yet again. Runecraft certainly doesn’t seem sympathetic to what they’re putting you through. He and his minions will likely drag it out. Be prepared for some hard questions thrown your way, but it’s mostly just the verdict left. Public pressure ensured that you would be present for that at least.”
“Don’t answer that Harry,” Hermione advised. At her words, Mr. Runecraft immediately turned his attention towards her and he smirked unkindly.
“When my husband died, well, I found it to be a difficult adjustment. I tried a few sessions with a mind healer. However, talking openly about myself is not something that comes naturally for me. You may find the same to be true for you,” McGonagall realized that while she had always considered herself to be a private person, Harry was used to keeping his secrets for a different reason. Still, it may end with the same result when it came to mind healers. “After a few sessions, I decided it wasn’t for me and found another way to deal with my grief. There isn’t one straightforward way to heal. I just hope you don’t discount it simply because Severus was the one to suggest it,” McGonagall said.
“I’m not making you a friendship bracelet... but, yeah,” Draco said, and shrugged. There was a slight rosy tint to his cheeks.
“Dangerous, you mean,” Hermione said with disapproval. “So much can go wrong. What if it damages the structural integrity of the wall?”
Harry had been dutifully reciting Crabbe’s message a second time to ensure he had it all, when Albert cut in.
“Thank you again, Harry,” Lucius said as he examined the brush he was gifted. He smiled as his thumb brushed over the dragons.
“What would your friends say about such a tragedy? Or perhaps they’ve already written you off. I wouldn’t want to associate with criminal elements,” taunted Burke.
When the unicorn conversation naturally died down, Rodolphus insisted his lesson be next. Harry was reluctant to learn more dark arts spells. Initially the dark arts tutoring had come off as a joke. When the men had first started suggesting spells, Harry had seen it as fun and a way for them to good-naturedly tease him. It seemed different when they tried to interweave it with his regular sixth year spells.
"George, he's gay, come on and you know exactly who it's for" Fred laughed "Just don't let Ginny get too restless when you tell her, be careful"
It's not like Harry could just talk to his parents about it, even if he felt remotely comfortable talking to them about this kind of stuff, you could never get decent about of alone time with one of them, because one of his siblings always needed them. Henry was constantly complaining he needed time with soccer, or James and Lily were telling him to be quiet with those video games. Haley was begging for more makeup, saying she was a growing girl and persuaded the attention towards her.
It's been almost two full months, i'm sorry but i'm back hopefully this schedule will get better. i update tear me apart more, so go check it out but i honestly only update it more because the chapters are shorter, but this is probably the story i'm most proud of so thank you i hope you all like this chapter !! :)
They made it to a Pizzahut, and met Fred George and Ron inside, where they got two large pizzas, and talked about their games, and of course Harry brought up what a little git Draco was. Ron talked about Oliver's save, in the first half and how next year he wanted to go out for keeper.
They both nodded in understanding and left to grab their bags trading each other looks of vengeance. Harry walked over to his mother. Draco stared at him as he started his walk over to his car.
So he was angry about not being the first boy to kiss Harry, so one could only imagine how furious he was, when he found out he wasn't the first boy to shag Harry either.
But Hogwarts happened. His mom somehow convinced his dad to stop sending their son to Christian boarding school, and he came home. She missed her only son, even with him in it the house was almost silent, so with just her and Lucius it was eery. Just having the presence of her son was nice. There aren't many out gay kids at Hogwarts but enough that Draco learned it was normal, and at 14 he could finally say it to himself. It wasn't like he was hiding it but it also wasn't anybody's goddamn business. Blaise and Pansy never asked, they might know, they did know him since he was 2 but it didn't matter. Plus Hogwarts brought him Harry.
The halls were buzzing with the usual commotion one would expect in an adolescent filled high school, laughter, talking, perhaps crying? The usual things going on in the utter horror that was high school. Harry stuffed a book or two in his locker-things he didn't need that day-and slung his backpack over his shoulder, carrying it to his first class. Oliver stood talking to the Weasley twins, not an unusual sight, the three were quite close. However Harry couldn't meet any of the six eyes that followed him when he passed their area. Was he ashamed for kissing a boy. No not at all. He was embarrassed for walking out, you could say that, kissing was good, but it didn't keep Draco out of his mind, fucking git.
"HI HARRY" Henry came running to the door, his shirt was muddy so he must of just came from soccer as well. Henry played defense, once he got onto the A team instead of the B he would probably start playing the same position as Draco, a sweeper.
"Hey" He mumbled out as he stood in their doorway, both looked up and gave him a stern look, before James broke out into a smile.
Thank You all so much for Reading !!!! Tell me what you think, comments and kudos are appreciated and I hope you enjoyed. I'm trying to think of good Jobs for the parents so any ideas are also appreciated. Thanks again -Sam
"So good Harry" He pushed himself-as much as he could in the small space-onto the boy trying to get him all the way inside.
Harry drove home slowly, there was no reed to rush, his parents knew he was safe. Besides he just needed a minute alone to process what had just happened. It felt so right, and he was confident in saying he was gay to himself, sure he said it to Ginny but that was in a moment of panic. In his room alone looking into the mirror, trying to get the words out like they slipped out on the soccer field, he barely got out the 'i'm' before the second word got caught in his throat. As douchey as it was for Ginny to out him like it, at least he didn't have to come out to everyone-wait fuck that. What if he didn't want anyone to know? Any only today did he understand it, when he was messily making out with Seamus, hands roaming, he had never felt so good, boys made him so excited, and so turned on.
Lily wouldn't agree to go out with him until junior year, and the way she agreed was not the way a lot of love stories go. Lily's sarcasm was the reason the two were married, on the soccer field, Sirius and Peter kept asking if she would ever go out with Jame's. Pestering her over and over again. It was a big playoff game, so Remus was announcing plays of the game when,he said this,
Harry had never been so hard in his life, never felt so good. Seamus moaned on his dick, and that's when he saw his lover's aching one, he took his hand and reached down, and jerked it off like it was his own. Somehow it felt right. The boy below him whined grabbing Harry's hand and guiding it towards his ass, he with his own hand reached around on the floor fumbling for something, it took awhile as he was still bobbing up and down on the dick in front of him. He eventually found it, a small bottle of lube, opened like he had many adventures in the backseat of his car. The bottle was thrust into Harry's second hand, the first grabbing Seamus' ass and lightly brushing his hole. It felt strange, so personal to be touching this part of his mate. The lube was strange in his hands, he had watched enough porn, and knew about anal from friends that tried it with their girlfriends, so squirted a blob onto his fingers, maybe too much but he wanted to be careful, and pushed a finger in. The boy below him became a mess of moans as the finger inside him began to move. Seamus got off the floor of the car and onto his back laying on the seats, Harry pushed the boy's legs back and put his finger back in before adding a second, then a third slowly opening him up. It was like fingering a girl, but tighter, and a girl never moaned as loud or as much as the boy below him did, which made him move fast trying to get more moans, proud of himself, making him harder every time they got louder.
"Catch up" He began then stopped when he saw the look the green eyes gave him, a knowing one like he knew there was a hidden reason to why he wanted to 'catch up'. It seemed like everyone wanted a chance to be with him. Girls always had crushes wanting to be his, disappointed when he decided to be with Ginny. Now the boys wanted to know what all the buzz was about, even more when they found out his dirty little secret. "Okay. Maybe a little more than catch up" There it was. Harry wasn't upset though. Over the course of their meal he had started to think of doing 'a little more' than just catching up if he was being honest with himself. The kiss with Oliver had made him think, and kissing boys was so nice, but what if he had made a mistake, breaking up with his girlfriend for no reason, then just being 'a little confused'. He wanted more, and to be frank he wanted Seamus as his more. He wasn't bad looking, rosy lips, pale skin, freckles thrown across his face, almost like someone took a paintbrush and flicked it leaving dots all over the short boy's face. His eyes were soft and inviting, the kind that let you know you could always come to them and trust.
He cried that night when he heard his dad say those words "They don't deserve to live, let alone be allowed to our basic human rights. They aren't human!". He was twelve, he had always known, always liked the way boys bodies looked to him, female ones always made him uncomfortable. Boobs never did it for him, he tried to watch porn but always focused on the males on the screen, tried to watch women by themselves but they never did the trick. He cried and cried, thinking no one would love him, he was sick, that this was the end of everything, he would be alone forever.
Seamus had a small boxy car, he was leaned up against the drivers door scrolling through his phone. School had let out about five minutes earlier and he awaited the taller boys arrival. He let out a light smile when he saw Harry come over, sliding his phone into his back pocket.
Harry's cleats were marking their place in the ground, as he ran up the field, dribbling close to his feet, looking up around to make sure no one was in his way, before passing to George Weasley, but the pass was short and the opposing team, came to intercept the pass, Harry groaned, as #17 took a shot. Draco ran up from the top of the Goalie box and booted it to the other half's 18. Harry chased after it, pounding his feet into the ground sprinting up to catch up from his spot at the half mark, he swept in and scored another point for Hogwarts. The game ended 2 and a half minutes later, the score 5-2, making them 6-0, another win. This was one of the best teams the school had seen for awhile. However despite their win Harry was fuming.
"Me too" He was used to his post practice snack, which today was canceled. His coach kept canceling, which would normally be nice, but whenever practice was canceled now he kept getting himself into these little predicaments.
"Yeah. No problem Harry" Seamus opened the door and climbed into the car, Harry mirrored this on the opposite side. They drove in silence for awhile Seamus looked over occasionally at the other boy, his mind racing with what he wanted to do to him, but that could wait. "You hungry" He asked and before the question could be processed by Harry, Seamus continued "Cus' I'm starving"
"No I'm good"  Haley and Henry were old enough to be home alone for a bit, besides how long will this take? He should be home long before dinner. "You'll just have to bring me back to get my car" Remembering last time he went for a drive and insisted on walking home, forced to take the bus, god why was his pride so important to him, he barely had any to begin with.
Harry waited and swung his keys, before walking with Ginny to his car. The Weasley's brothers all shared one car, that used to be Percy's and then the twin's, but they sometimes gave Ron a ride. Usually Harry drove him to school. But today Ron got a ride with the twins.
She started to tear up-Harry too. But she wiped hers away he let them fall down his face curving his jaw and falling onto his sweatshirt. "Leave. just leave Harry. Have a good life. I hate you" She walked to the car wiping away one last tear and climbed in the back.
"None of your bloody business why. As I was saying I won't be here next Tuesday, and I wanted you to know, on Wednesday we have a game, so you'll have to give the  little speech with do alone."
"Nah, Brady's mom will bring me-I said that, oh and I tucked away a stay over bag for tonight in your car mum. In knew this would happen and I'm prepared that's good though right?" He didn't wait for a response and just kept going. "Also did you see that amazing save I just made, like two seconds before the whistle blew. And Harry Draco's here and saw it and can you believe it! He didn't say anything but he still saw it. He's like the best player-besides you-on the varsity team. Man I can't wait to see him play on Wednesday. Oh Yeah practice got canceled on Wednesday. Coaches wife has a C-Section that day." That's the thing with Henry he doesn't shut up and once he get's going he doesn't stop.
"I'm Henry" He introduced himself sensing the confusion on the older boy. "My brother plays on the team too. I wanna be a sweeper just like you, you're so good. I love watching you play, and that save you did at the end of the first half. SO GOOD!! Like actually, I wish I could play like you"
But maybe you're forgetting that Draco was practicality head over heels in love with Harry James Potter.
"So what even was that" Harry couldn't possibly remember correctly that his friend had just kissed him, he hadn't right? He didn't know what to do, he couldn't date a teammate people would think he was bias, plus he had just broken up with Ginny, and everything was big ball of confusion shifting around in his mind and leading him to make the worst and most idiotic mistakes someone could think of in a lifetime.
George and Fred Weasley. They weren't gay, as they put it, they were, Bi-Curious. They had been since eighth grade, when Oliver Wood transferred to their middle school. Come on who didn't love Oliver Freaking Wood. It was great, they hooked up for awhile, nothing more then a couple handjobs, then a few blowjobs, and soon the whole package, they faded away, but Oliver was kind of greedy he kept coming back for more, they wouldn't talk much for awhile, but he always seemed to come back.
When he got home both his parents were asleep. Which left Harry alone once more but this time with his thoughts. Why did he care so much about Draco?
Did people just think, that if they pretended they hadn't been complete assholes and ignored him, everything would go back to normal. Well for two days that actually went well, it was normal. The teams Wednesday game went well and they won, continuing their streak, of no defeats. Then all shit hit the fan. Why?  Because he's fucking Harry Potter that's why.
"Yeah I don't have practice tomorrow, maybe I'll get some of the boys on my team to come and watch your game"
It was hard for the young boys to not tear each other's clothes off right in the parking lot, but they were smart, driving into an abandoned parking lot. That's when their mouths collided only taking seconds, it was sloppy, and wet their mouths opened inviting the other in with their tongues fighting for dominance, until Harry won.They scrambled into the back seat knocking each other on the head and laughing, smiling at eachother when Seamus started to rub Harry's thigh before climbing onto his lap.
"Yeah, heard some seniors talking about it, although those seniors can be untrustworthy ya know. Wouldn't mind finding out for myself"
"Alright explain then. Explain why your ending a perfectly good relationship. When there's no cheating and no fighting nothing is wrong in this. Except now of course" She scoffed.
Harry's face dropped at the mention of Draco. He didn't realize that Henry looked up to him as a player that much. Harry didn't notice it but his mother caught it. And that's when Lily knew. She figured out what was bothering her boy, she didn't ever think he was. But it all made sense. The way he was jumpy, and always looked worse at the mention of dating, or why he always rambled on and on about that Draco Malfoy. Lily didn't care that her son was gay, but did he have to like the Politician's son?
As soon as Harry was old enough to start on a rec team, they let him, outshining all of his team. At 11 they found him a private travel team, that he started along with the rec team. And of course Harry wanted to play on the middle school, team, and of course he made it, three teams seemed like a lot for one kid but Harry kept pushing through.
"Hey Wood" He smiled at his teammate, Oliver was always there for everyone on the team, ready to help teach someone keeper, skills, if they wanted to learn, or he would miss a game. Harry looked up to me, trusted him completely. Maybe that extra trust is what made the next thing that happened happen. How Harry ended up snogging his team's Goalie. One shouldn't bore you with the conversation that took place next, and frankly Harry couldn't remember really. It was like he blinked and was in the passengers' side of Oliver's car.
"Oh man Ginny" George breathed in through his teeth "Well are you gay or bi, cus you don't even have to tell Ginny then"
Harry had clearly had too much liquor, but it was either going to school hungover or explaining to his mother and father, why half the liquor cabinet was empty and his breathe smelled that strong scent of rum. So hungover to school it was. Fun!
my phone is getting taken away along with my computer so i have no access to technology for god knows how long which fucking sucks donkey balls mannnn.
"Why'd you invite me out" Harry asked as the finished up, pushing his plate away and throwing the used napkin on it. The diner was themed like the 50s', common for a small town joint close to where Seamus lived. He waited for the boy across from him to answer, he seemed to be thinking of some excuse instead of the obvious that he wanted to hook up with Harry.
Draco woke up at 5:00 every single morning of his life to start the same routine he had always done. He woke at 5 and started his half hour jog around the family garden, the thirty minutes let him go around once if he just jogged. Starting after his jog he took a fifteen minute shower an went downstairs at 5:45 where one of his maids would have an egg sandwhich and orange juice waiting for him at the obnoxiously long dinning room table. He'd do any homework or studying he needed to do then headed out at 6, it take twenty five minutes to get to school but he would of course take his fifteen minute detour to grab lunch at the grocery store. Arriving at school at 6:40 was annoying but he'd exercise more by walking around the track listening to music until the first bell at 7:20.
They got dressed and after a couple of minutes back into the front seat, Harry's phone buzzed, it was 7:15, he missed dinner and didn't even mention he wouldn't be home. 3 missed calls from each parent and a dozen or so messages, he whispered out a 'fuck'
He had to find someone who he could trust at the school. There was one person, or well two people.....
He went for a run. He was tired of crying, and as it got colder the flowers would start to die, the garden becoming bare. Music played as he slowly jogged, he ended up running for about an hour, trying to think. They had a game tomorrow and he needed to be ready, missing practice was awful, you don't get to be a professional if you don't take it seriously. He doubts his parents would let him play at University, there was no need to keep him busy anymore, he had a hard enough time convincing them he should still be able to play in high school. Grades are what mattered, sure they could pay Draco into any school, donate a library or a hall, but this was about reputation. He's gonna have to become a lawyer or go into Politic science or history.
"Yep, and luckily Fred was feeling the same way when I asked him about it." George laughed "About the same person for godsake too"
Sorry if you were ever invested I hate when I'm reading a fic and something like this happens, I promised myself I'd never do this but here I am lol. also i can't believe people like this and i was so proud of it because i kept cringing at my writing so hopefully this is better!
Harry's talent really seemed to come naturally, of course practice did help, but it was mostly pure talent and skill. For Draco his talent, came from anger and hours of hard laborious practice. Which is a reason a rift came between them, Draco was angry that the talent just came to him, but he was furious his parents encouraged him, unlike Draco's. So that was the start of what some would call a rivalry between the two boys.
"Hey" Harry's voice came out questioning, he was still worried, didn't understand why he was here, or what his acquaintance wanted with him.
James saw her the first day and took a liking to her, pointing her out, to his friends, Remus, Peter, and his best friend Sirius. Sirius was still close to the family to this day, he was Harry's Godfather, Haley's Godfather was Peter, and Henry's was Remus.
At Half time Henry came running over to him, graciously taking the food and drink from his older brother's hands. "Brady and Chris said they would bring me to their house and the dance. Can I go? Can I go?"
The door squeaked as Harry entered, it was now a quarter past eight, an entire hour since he and Seamus had finished and parted ways, his parents were in their room, the tv on but neither paying attention as Lily read and James went through cases for work.
And one Draco Malfoy was not happy, with any of it. It was stupid to think, that the person who hated him most would like him, but it seemed less idiotic when the news of Harry being gay came to light. However people would still argue that someone should not get heated over the fact of someone else snogging someone. Especially when they was no romantic connection to either person.
Why was it a problem if he wasn't gay. This was so confusing, he was attracted to Ginny wasn't he. Wasn't he? Oh god, he was a poof, sure Ginny was beautiful, but more in the way you look at a little sister, or a close friend. Like Hermonie, Harry thought she was pretty but he wouldn't date her, well of course he wouldn't date her. HE"S GAY!? God this was so god damn confusing to him, he'd never been attracted to girls, that much he guessed, but he also had never been attracted to guys either.
"I like you too" The older boy smiled, before flattening his mouth with what came next "But we can't date or anything, I just-"
James made a confused face "Short one with the heavy Irish accent" He intimidated it as he questioned who the boy was.
"I don't care about those idiots you dickhead" She shouted which left the Twins to running to their beaten down car, knowing what their sister was like angry and it was not the nice girl everyone seemed to know.
Both Malfoy and Nott were regarding Harry curiously. Harry could tell that Malfoy wanted to ask what the deal with the dementor was.
“Plus, if you got the pleasure of torturing Potter while the dark lord is denied...” Nott trailed off as he let Jugson picture whatever he wanted as the negative consequence.
“Ronald Weasley?” Bole asked Ron. At Ron’s confirmation, Bole grabbed his arm as well. The man was large and muscular and could probably subdue both of Harry’s friends if need be. He started guiding them towards the other aurors and Perkins followed suit with Harry.
“Sorry, you probably had a whole speech. Did I ruin it?” Harry worriedly asked. His hand closed over the ring as if fearful Draco would take it back because Harry interrupted.
Harry tried to brace himself but he wasn’t sure if he should expect his worse memories to play out or if he would have another disturbing conversation with a dementor.
Draco let Harry absorb his words. A few more tears fell, but Harry didn’t pull away to wipe his face. He just watched Draco and Draco watched him.
His companions stuck close to him. The walked beside him and took up the stalls around him. Even with this demonstration of unity, the other prisoners kept blatantly looking at Harry. The longer it went on, the more Harry started to recall the attack. Consequently, Harry scrubbed vigorously at his body until Lucius reached over and placed a hand on Harry’s arm.
The same rule did not apply to Voldemort. Harry didn’t blame them for being curious about his memories of Voldemort even though he hated reliving them. What did surprise him was when neither commented on Tom Riddle’s parentage. Lucius had only remarked on Voldemort’s lost charisma, while Albert revealed he’d gone to school with him. It seemed some death eaters were already privy to the knowledge that Voldemort was a halfblood, but it was kept hush-hush in favor of promoting pureblood propaganda.
“I-” Harry swallowed nervously and tried again. “I didn’t mean to do that,” he said in an unsteady voice.
“Er...” Harry hesitated, not sure how to respond. He couldn’t look Mr. and Mrs. Weasley in the eye, so he helplessly looked down and watched James.
where one man would demonstrate to another in the cell in front of him. It slowly moved diagonally until Harry would see for himself the wand movements. He rather hoped nothing got lost as it moved from man to man. He wouldn’t put it past the Lestrange brothers to purposely screw it up.
horcruxes during our second year. It drained her energy and possessed her to get stronger,” Harry said.
“He came to see me. Once,” Harry said. He cupped his hands around his teacup to absorb some of the tea’s warmth. “He said he’d let me go if I told everything the ministry was doing a good job,” Harry frowned at the memory. He instantly regretted saying anything as he felt Dumbledore’s stare intensify on him. Harry looked into the depths of his mug as if it was the most fascinating thing in the world.
“Get up, Lestrange, or I’ll take it to mean you’re not hungry,” said one of the guards. Harry’s eyes widened as he realized the guard was speaking to the man in the other cell next to Harry. He didn’t know which brother was there, but either one was bad.
“I don’t understand why this spot is different,” Draco said in frustration after several of his tests yielded no conclusive answers.
“You’ll... help me?” Harry questioned. He didn’t doubt that James was his horcrux, but was surprised by Draco’s offer. He’d expected the other man to walk away in disgust. Instead he offered help. Unable to stop it, Harry burst into full-fledged drunken sobbing. Draco continued to run a soothing hand in his hair, or down his upper back while Harry cried himself to sleep.
the reason the ministry had gone after the Weasleys in the first place. If the twins found a way around it, he was fine with them using his name.
“I can try,” he said. Harry needed to see the man in order to properly heal him. Harry only had to think about summoning his glasses before they were sailing towards him. Harry’s quidditch reflexes helped him catch them before they could smack him in the face.
“But... how?” Harry asked, because it didn’t make sense. Even if James wasn’t his horcrux, how could his soul return to him? That didn’t happen when Voldemort’s horcruxes were destroyed.
“Er... well, you grew into those features, didn’t you? You could be a fucking model if you wanted to,” Harry said and hoped Draco didn’t hold any of his childish errors in judgement against him.
“Potter, your self-worth isn’t supposed to be lower than mine,” he commented as he helped Harry get under the sheets.
“Are there other ways of getting rid of it then?” Harry asked as he brought the conversation back to his original concern.
“Does it really matter why?” asked another guard. “Let’s just be thankful it didn’t kiss Potter as well. Scrimgeour would really have our asses.”
“True,” Harry said and held out the mirror for Draco to take. “You’ll need to time it when the guards aren’t there, but you can pretty much talk to your dad at almost any time of day.”
Harry glanced in Malfoy’s direction. So far he had not seemed malicious towards Harry. None of the men had though Harry wasn’t confident that would remain the case if they had access to him and a guard’s approval to do what they liked.
Breakfast was as awkward as dinner had been. Many students were still half-asleep and didn’t bother to even glance in his direction, but the ones that did made up for the rest. Harry might be used to attention, but that didn’t mean he liked it. The exception being Draco, of course. When he’d seen the Slytherins walk into the great hall, he’d been tempted to go say hello. He’d held back, unsure if more questions about Burke would come up. He thought he saw Crabbe give him a small wave, but feared it was just wishful thinking that he’d still be welcomed by them now that he had no more letters to offer. Instead of talking to them, Harry spent his time watching Draco but tried to appear like he wasn’t watching Draco.
“Oh dear. Of course, you don’t know. You couldn’t know. I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this, especially so soon after you’ve woken up... I’m afraid Ginevra Weasley died a few months ago during a difficult delivery. It was a tough pregnancy overall,” she told him as gently as she could.
Harry feared it might not be working as Burke fumbled with his own clothes as if nothing new had happened. The man pushed his own pants and trousers to his knees before moving to settle over Harry again. Burke gripped Harry’s leg, moved it to his satisfaction, and then just stopped. The man frowned before turning to glare at the dementor still lingering at the door.
“Obviously,” Snape sneered. Luckily, he made no move to touch Harry again. Unluckily, he stared at the wall with a displeased expression. “Ten points from Gryffindor for damaging the school,” the man stated as he moved to investigate the damage. Harry didn’t bother to argue as he still felt unsteady and could hear his heart pounding.
The first time the idea had come to him, Harry had immediately rejected it. However, he kept circling back to it no matter how much he hated it. He knew it was a bad idea. Aside from having to kill someone to create a horcrux, there was a plethora of additional side-effects. Voldemort was definitely unhinged. Perhaps that wouldn’t happen if Harry only created one, but he didn’t delude himself. There was no way he’d be completely spared since he’d be damaging his
Harry waited until none of the guards were close to him before he angled his body to see into Avery’s cell. He activated the wards that had been set up earlier. They flashed as they activated, causing Harry to suck in his breath in fear. One of the guards turned in their direction with a frown. Harry held his breath for two nerve-wracking seconds, before the guard decided nothing was out of order and turned away.
“Er, right, hold on,” Harry said. He hesitated to pull out his map in front of them. With a wandless and voiceless notice-me-not spell placed on the map, Harry quickly pulled it out. Harry figured it worked since all three blinked in confusion at him. Harry quickly scanned the map. As soon as he found Theo, he folded it back up and placed it back in his pocket.
Hale introduced him as Mr. Lance, and made sure to stress the fact that he had recently won some prestigious award for investigative reporting. Harry made the appropriate impressed noises though he’d never heard of that award before. He knew Hale intended to put Harry at ease with Lance’s obvious competence in his job. But, it was Lance that eventually reassured Harry when he confided that his cousin had been arrested, and subsequently died in Azkaban only seven months into his sentence. Harry felt like Lance shared Harry’s desire for prison reform even if the man hadn’t outright said it.
doing anything. Except arresting innocent people like Stan Shunpike. How does that help anyone?” Harry asked annoyed. “Scrimgeour isn’t any better than Fudge,” he added bitterly.
“Don’t really trusts the guards pointing their wands at my face,” answered Mulciber. Frankly, Harry couldn’t blame him for that.
write down what you say, but they’re well aware that I could selectively choose sections of the transcript,” Hale said with a smirk that indicated to Harry that he’d be doing just that.
“What did you tell him?” asked Draco. He sounded nervous. Harry faltered, not sure if the answer would upset Draco or not.
“Can you hold another illusion?” Albert whispered. “Hold the image of the cell right in front of the door as you activate the wards?”
! He shouldn’t have had to. I was already all twisted up. It wouldn’t have made a difference to my soul. But it was for nothing. Nothing. Because Neville saved us, and I killed Ginny. I wasn’t justif-tif-right. You had reasons. I did bad things because I was sel-selfish. But you had reasons. You were a death eater.”
“After that, can you really blame Harry for thinking no guard would come to his aid?” Hale summed up.
“Look,” Harry cut her off. He was growing impatient, but more embarrassed. Despite being muffled by his sleeve, Harry was certain Lucius and Albert were hearing the whole conversation. “Go get Theo. He’ll vouch for me.”
here. You better get comfortable because you won’t be leaving. So, I really do hope you like the cell, the cold, and the company. You’ll grow to like these bars soon, Potter,” Burke announced as if nothing would please him more. “After all, it’ll keep you nice and safe from the dementors and the other riffraff around here.”
They pulled into a local diner and ordered. They chatted like old mates catching up, their friend groups intertwined in middle school but broken up by the transition to high school. Seamus was like any boy their age, he was funny, hated homework but did alright in school-except for that times he made the glass bottle in chemistry explode-and he was obsessed with sex.
"Yeah I know what you are. So what am I a beard, what was only three months ago. Did you fake that. Then again it was pretty fast. Heh, wow your a poofer. So you like arse fucking then".
The school was in full blown riot when they found THE Harry Potter was gay. The news was spread by Friday night just hours after Ginny Weasley and him had broken up. The twins were each slapped twice when Ginny found out that they had known her boyfriend was gay and didn't tell her. Ron was shocked and Hermonie said she was a little suprised but Harry was unpredictable but not really consider his unpredictability was so predictable.
"Then I'll walk to my car" Nothing would be more cringe worthy thing looking back and remembering sitting in the car with someone you just snogged for ten minutes, in complete silence. What would make it worse would be someone would try and lighten the mood by playing music thus, making sure whatever songs played would the be ruined for the both of them. So instead Harry decided that rejecting the boy again would be better then ruining some good music. Good priorities right?
Because everyone knew who Harry Potter was, he was like this superstar, even if he didn't play soccer, everyone would have known who he was, thanks to James Potter. James was a superstar athlete, he had three friends he was loyal to, married the girl he had a crush on since, freshmen year.
Three days, three days, and no one said anything. The first day Harry expected something but, no, just silence. That was weird, of course it wasn't as weird or slightly disturbing by the next days that followed. For two days nothing went happened.
He made it over and smiled at her, as she ran up to take a shot, the goalie caught it, and Harry along with others chorused an 'awww'. He yelled "Nice shot Ginny"
Henry looked up smiling at the him "Do you think maybe you could teach me? Or maybe you could come over my house and teach me. Wait that's weird. I don't know I just really want to play like you."
Coach made it increasingly difficult to make Boys Varsity, no doubt only a mere 16 boys made it onto varsity, even getting onto JV was pretty hard 20 were on the team, 36 out of the 73 boys that tried out made onto a team. Which was why it was most impressive when Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy made it onto the school's Varsity team. But it wasn't that surprising they both breathed ate and drank soccer, they practically were the sport.
The same could not be said for the Malfoys. Lucius and Narcissa, never really showed a loving interest for their only son. It was always about whether or not Draco embarrassed the family name. He started at private school, in preschool, always the best and most expensive teachers for the Malfoys. Draco loved soccer, and begged to play, but the answer was always no. One day Narcissa spoke up claiming it would keep him active and busy. So the reason he played soccer was to keep him busy.
"Good" His voice was deep with confidence and that's when he started to thrust harder and deeper, he was balls deep in this boy's ass and it was the best feeling he could've ever imagined. Seamus continued to jerk himself off fast matching the pace of each thrust. He was pounding into him now it was orgasmic, he wasn't going to last much longer. He kept going though and what sent him over the edge is when Seamus pushed Harry off of him and got back onto his lap. This time he was the one lining his ass onto the large cock and sitting all the way down, easy as he was already open wide for Harry.
Henry ran onto the field as soon as the whistle blew, Harry was shocked when he went immediately over to Draco. "Wow!! You're so good"
Walking home from the restaurant, meant no car, and no car meant bus. Which was torture device in itself. But again insuring someone didn't ruin the Strokes for Harry was much more important then comfort of your car and your pride when boarding the bus.
"HARRY" Haley came down the stairs, she had just finished undoing her ponytail, from practice. "This boy Chase asked me out today,and not just to the dance, but to date"
Sitting his ass down at the very same time Dr. Severus Snape walked into class. The guy was a nightmere, Harry couldn't tell you the amount of times he had gotten lunch detentions from that guy for calling him Mr Snape.
"Seamus, told Dean, Dean told god who knows, and you had to have known Seamus can't keep his mouth shout himself-"
The window was down and the wind hit his face, it felt refreshing with one arm out the window feeling calm as he drove alone. There had to be a reason why he still had an empty feeling at the bottom of his stomach, why was he still so confused if he thought everything was figuring itself out.
Word travels fast in high-school. You saw it when the news of Potter being gay came to rise in Hogwart's Halls. So the news Oliver Wood snogging Harry Potter also traveled around the school like nobody's business.
He watched as Seamus bounced up and down on him, moving his hips in a figure eight and his own cock standing straight pressed against his stomach moving along with each bounce of his hips. This was it, he grabbed the boy's waist, holding him in place and let all of his remaining energy plow into the ass on top of him, fucking him with absolute relentlessness. Their moans became loud, and Harry stopped thrusting up when he finally came into the condom and groaned, Seamus finished soon after, the sound of his friend's moans sending him over the edge and he came on Harry's stomach and chest.
Harry sighed the argument not worth starting. "Did you guys need something, we need to get onto the pitch"
"I don't give a damn about who started it" Their coach snarled "I care about unity between the team, and you two are always causing a rift. I don't care if you two are the captains I will not hesitate to bench you both". he paused "For an entire game"
"Okay" George broke in. "We can't really dictate to one part in time but around eighth grade when we were really serious about it. Also Oliver Woods great arse really helped me decided personally."
"Don't be so down on yourself, we heard all good things" They laughed, which he ignored and stormed off onto to the field, Jesus Christ why can nobody keep their mouths shout. Maybe he should've said something before he got out of the car. Whatever. This was just perfect.
Draco headed home to see four men at the dinning room table with his parents. Narcissa was typing what each man said onto her laptop. Draco was ready to say hello when he heard the topic of 'those pesky homosexuals' by one of the men.
"No" Henry answered "I'm just asking her to the dance, and Dad knows about that, unlike everything with Chase" they started bickering.
"Fuck, god fucking dammit" Seamus groaned and starting pulling at his own cock, he just wanted Harry in him. "Fuck me" Harry moaned at the thought his own member was throbbing thinking of entering the tight ass in front of him. Seamus reached down once more and gave the boy a condom. Taking it he ripped it open with his mouth and slid it onto his dick, and he lined it up to his entrance before looking into his eyes which rolled back one he pushed himself in, making the boy's back arch as he slowly worked his cock all the way inside of him.
"Soon" Henry smiled there were crumbs on his face and his uniform. The middle school across the street was under the same rules as the high school, but they weren't as strict, their uniforms were just polos and khakis, or skirts for the girls. Harry missed that, the dress pants were getting annoying making khakis feel like sweatpants. He missed middle school in general which was a weird thing to say, but it was the truth life was so much simpler than.
"You will all have a partner for this lab. Which will begin now. Directions are on the board. Begin" He voice drawled out.
Henry and Haley's doors were shut, he could hear music from one and voices of a Netflix show from the other. There were three bedrooms upstairs and one bathroom they all shared. His own room was dark, he set his bag down and flung off his shoes, taking off his uniform and slipping into pajama bottoms and a loose t-shirt he climbed into bed. Left alone to think of the feeling in his stomach and now chest, growing bigger as he became more confused.
"What's wrong with you" He smirked shaking his head, walking away while slinging his back over his right shoulder, carrying his soccer bag in his hand.
"Homecomings coming up" Ginny said excited "I hope Harry will ask me" Molly smiled, and Ron rolled his eyes, the twins who were usually quick to a joke about their relationship just looked down at their plates stuffing their mouths with potatoes so they wouldn't have to speak.
"Fredrick" He heard his father laugh lightly "We're Republicans. We don't go into that stuff" The people at the table laughed those laughs that made you want to choke yourself. "Anyways you know how I stand on the subject. No. It's wrong. Men and Men don't walk hand and hand. One of the many Malfoy beliefs. Why Narcissa and Bellatrix have a sister that married another woman, I don't believe we've spoken to her in quite some time" They all laughed again.
"Just shut up Harry" She laughed again "I though we were something. Guess not. Have fun, when every knows this, cus I'm a very talkative person aren't I"
"Yeah don't worry about it mom. I'm gonna head upstairs. Love ya" Desperate to get away before they kept questioning him, and he let out something he might regret.
so this draft is only partially edited and written, meaning THIS DRAFT IS NOT COMPLETE and poorly edited on my part. it sucks mannnnn, i'm honestly really upset.
Both his parents had left, but his siblings were sitting at the counter eating breakfast. "You guys almost ready"
"Well Harry, I knew because I was just so incredibly dashing and handsome I couldn't limit myself to only one sex" Fred smiled
Ginny got a ride home with her brothers which left Harry alone in the car, he turned the radio on, to The Strokes. "Last nite" Was on.
"Shut up Harry. No one's as perfect as you" The boys shot glares at each other as they worked in absolute silence. Ron walked out without saying goodbye and Harry didn't mind it gave him so peace and quiet as he made his way to World Literature.
At half time James was at 10 out of the 17 he needed, no one had seemed him play this hard before, Lily blushed each time he scored, she tried to hide her excitement whenever he came close to scoring. Once he reached 14 she stopped hiding it, and drew #9 and JP on her cheeks, in the teams colors. Just in time for homecoming, because with 10 seconds left James slammed the ball into the net scoring number 17.
Lily and James were the parents that always showed up dressed in the team's colors, cheering on their son, it killed James every time work kept him late. They always wanted to show up, because that's the type of people the Potters were.
Things are stirring in Harry's heart!!! Starting to figure things out but he's still confused as ever.
Draco hung up the phone smiling. He pinched himself and pinched himself again. Fuck his routine. Harry potter was gay!!!
"When you were little I used to hear a lot about the goals you scored during the game now all I hear is about how Draco did this during the game, or Draco did that" She giggled. Harry grew red and humphed "What"
Harry hung his head back and sighed. Jesus Christ, what was wrong with him? He wasn't saying he didn't like Draco. However it would be a hell of a lot easier if he didn't, and then he wouldn't have to deal with these, weird emotions he was feeling. Couldn't he just go back to hating Draco, like the good old days, where everything seemed fine and normal.
Harry completely bombed the game, he scored once, the only shot that was on target. Diggory, Flint and Pucey carried the goals. They still won, thanks to the back lines defense and the center mids. As much as Draco was in love with boy he really wanted to tear his head off his neck. Winning was everything and he was completely sabotaging the teams chances at championships if he kept this up, they would start losing games.
Draco spent most of his time in the shower next to his bedroom, so he didn't have the time to check his phone. Monday morning however he was finishing up his run when Blaise called.
"And the opposing team takes the ball before, our own center mid, JAMES POTTER, comes in a steals it, right on mate, passes it to, Blalinkski". Sirius and Peter were laughing as they walked over to where the microphone was set up. Sirius leaned and whispered to Remus. "New word in, from Lily Evans, 'If James can score 17 goals, I will go out with him'" James looked over to where Lily was sitting, he smirked and winked at her. Remus burst out laughing, "Don't look so cocky you'll never do it"
"'Ginny don't'" She mocked "Your love is like ice, you heart too. Like stone. I don't want everyone to think I was dumped for whatever bullshit reason the golden boy comes up with alright. So sorry but this is the way life works people were gonna find out sooner or later. Why not now"?
James had gone to private school, for all of his education, excluding kindergarten, and starting at 1st grade. Lily had gone to public school, the family not having much money, until Lily had gotten a scholarship to attend Hogwarts Academy of Studies, a free ride courtesy of, Principal Albus Dumbledore. Of course the Evans still had to pay for the school uniform, but that was little considering their daughter was attending a elite private school.
So Draco took his car, and pulled out of the parking lot, he had to get home so he could study and do his homework, then probably lock himself in his room. Shutting out the insufferable bickering his parents were yet again bound to be doing once Draco managed to get home if this traffic would fucking hurry the fuck up. Lucius was probably whining about how his paperwork was screwed up, or 'how was he supposed to get elected next term, if Narcissa didn't do her part and make him look good, instead of a goddamn fool'. There was always some problem with Draco's parents.
“Oh, what are you going to do to me, Potter?” laughed Burke. “You’re trapped in a cell. I still have my wand. Please give me an excuse to use it.”
“I wouldn’t know,” Malfoy said eventually and then was silent again for a few minutes as he thought about the situation. “Sending you straight to Azkaban was probably just to make it harder for Dumbledore to rescue you quickly or prevent the whole thing from happening. They probably thought that sending you here would ensure that their plan would work… but since it’s a crap plan, it will not.”
The temperature in the changing room was cold and Harry shivered once fully undressed. The temperature marginally rose once Harry moved into the shower area. He was also pleased to note that there were waist-high stalls set up around the room. There were no curtains, so Harry had to try extra hard not to notice anyone’s dangly bits no matter how much they were all just wagging freely in the room. Harry strategically placed his hands over his dick to keep his modesty and hoped the half-walls of the stall would prevent most from taking a peak. Harry briskly walked over to a stall. Lucius and Nott chose the stalls on either side of him. There were no assigned shower stalls, so Harry knew they purposely picked them to remain close to him.
Draco nodded. He looked unsure for a moment, but then pushed past whatever initial reservations he had to state “I will need you to go over everything. You weren’t the most... coherent last night.”
“It was the same for Ginny, Luna and me as well,” Hermione added. Ron let out another bark of a laugh.
HARRY POTTER ABUSED BY MUGGLE RELATIVES! was the headline that greeted him the next morning. Harry couldn’t bring himself to read it, so Hermione summarized it for him. The Dursleys were presented as magic-hating muggles that had tormented him for years. While true, Harry thought it wasn’t as bad as the papers were making it seem. The reporter made sure to highlight that neither the headmaster or the minister commented on the issue, but another ministry underling was quoted saying they were looking into it and would “rectify Dumbledore and Fudge’s past mistakes.” Harry thought it unlikely and dreaded what his summer would be like.
“And not as love-blind as Rodo here,” added Mulciber. “It’s refreshing to hear that you see the bad with the good. I’ve met Draco and he can be a prick.”
“Clothes. You, er, need to change and put on the Azkaban uniform,” instructed Anton. He gestured to a pile of folded up clothes waiting on the desk. Perkins stepped forwards and undid the magical bindings on Harry’s wrists.
In the morning, the other prisoners remarked that they had a good night’s sleep. After some speculation, Nott realized it was because the dementors hadn’t done their nightly patrol. While the other prisoners celebrated the reprieve, Harry couldn’t help but worry about it. After their initial interest in him, it probably wouldn’t bode well if they had decided to start avoiding him.
Harry was led towards the chair with magical chains. Along the way, he caught sight of Dumbledore sitting in the first row. He wasn’t directly behind the chair Harry was to sit at, but he was close. Noting Harry’s attention, the older wizard smiled encouragingly and nodded at Harry in recognition. Harry was surprised that he felt comforted by the headmaster’s presence given he’d felt forsaken by him since his stay in Azkaban. Still, Harry couldn’t manage to return the smile because he was all too aware that this time Harry was the one avoiding all eye contact with the older wizard.
Hale started the questioning by walking Harry through the events of the night Albert was arrested. Hale glossed over a few things Harry had mentioned during their private meetings, so Harry tried to follow his lead as best as he could and kept details to minimum. If McGonagall made a big deal about it later, Harry could claim he'd been worried about getting himself or his friends in trouble. What would be harder to explain were Harry’s memories of that night previously submitted into the trial.
“You could always try to create the spell,” suggested Rodolphus. Harry had never consider creating his own spells before. He wasn’t sure how to go about it, so the others started explaining how they would use the known spells as a springboard to develop additional variations. Together the men picked apart their knowledge of enhanced vision, Polyjuice, and shape shifting characteristics. By the time they were satisfied their spell would work, Harry couldn’t help but feel proud. He not only understood the logic behind the new spell, but had also contributed to the discussion that helped them arrive at the incantation for their new spell. They would have to test the spell to ensure it would work, but Harry was already jumping forward; he had a similar suggestion for a variation that would enable someone to see if a nearby animal was actually someone’s Animagus form. Harry nervously shared this with the others. They had just started to debate the feasibility of the spell working, when the guards returned to announce it was shower time.
Although Hale asked questions about Albert, Harry tied in a few of the other prisoners as well. Hale was the judicial-wizard for all his new death eaters friends, even if they were not currently appealing their case. So, Harry made sure to mention that Crabbe told Harry to wake him if Harry had nightmares about Burke. He spoke about how Lucius was constantly ensuring that Harry was OK, which was remarkable given that the guards had not offered even the mildest of pain relief potions. To Hale’s amusement, Harry even recounted how Mulciber sung and danced in the showers to draw the attention away from Harry’s bruised body.
“Nah, use Burke’s name,” suggested Mulciber from his cell. “That way, he’ll get the blame for all the bad things you do.”
“They make sure any injuries are healed before you’re presented to anyone from the outside,” Mulciber informed Harry.
Ancient studies were more interesting than Harry expected them to be. The problems Harry had in those lessons arose whenever the Lestrange brothers focused on wizard superiority. Harry felt the need to rebel against that on principle. These lessons inevitably devolved into debates. Harry grew frustrated that all his tutors supported each other during these arguments.
Malfoy looked shocked. Harry didn’t know if it was because Harry was being arrested or because he hadn’t thought Harry would cast any unforgivables. With more than a little bitterness, Harry wondered how many of the slytherins in Malfoys little group had cast unforgivables. None of them were being arrested for it.
“I’ll bring product next time,” the man sighed. He tried to flatten Harry’s hair as much as possible.
Not that he acted on his feelings. He’d done enough damage to Ginny. He didn’t deserve a second chance; especially since he wasn’t sure he or his horcrux wouldn’t unintentionally hurt Draco in some unforeseen way. He was content to bask in Draco’s friendship, and let that be enough.
“Vidanima maxima,” Draco said from Harry’s side. He didn’t move to Harry’s previous spot as he suspected his husband would need him close by.
The prisoners filed out of the changing room and back into their cells in an orderly fashion. Harry was once again surprised at how docile the most dangerous of Azkaban’s prisoners were being. It made sense given there were dementors nearby, ready to swoop in as soon as the guards dropped their spell. Still, Harry found it unsettling. Perhaps because he too walked back into his cell and watched the door close without even thinking of making a break for it.
The wizengamot was unwilling to get into a debate on the treatment of prisoners. After Harry had directed everyone attention to it, many of his naysayers were suddenly willing to move on to finalizing their decision on what compensation Harry would receive just to avoid a larger discussion on Azkaban itself. Despite Runecraft’s insistence that Harry was not owed any sort of compensation, he was largely ignored. Hale negotiated a monetary compensation of seventy-seven thousand galleons. Harry thought it was an insane amount but wasn’t going to refuse once he saw the sour look on Scrimegeour’s, Runecraft’s and the others’ faces. As minister, Scrimegeour had to issue to public apology for Harry’s illegal detainment.  The wizengamot did not agree to Harry’s request to investigate Azkaban, but Madame Bones did state it would be on the agenda of their next internal meeting.
"Could you not just hop over to my cell?" Harry wondered when it occurred to him that a frog could easily slip through the bars.
“This is crazy! I’m not going to go around practicing unforgivables,” Harry said. “If I have to mean it for the curse to work, then I would need to want to hurt the person I’m casting it on. Aside from Bellatrix, I don’t really want to hurt anyone like that.”
This chapter was supposed to be longer, but as I started to flesh it out, it got more complicated - and I’m not even finished writing it yet! So, I figured I’d cut it in half and give you guys something now since I’m slow and who knows when I’ll finish the rest. But at least you know Harry’s over-the-top and insane plan to woo Draco. Good thing Harry is used to doing the impossible.
“He’s a bit young,” stated Nott. Harry thought it almost sounded like Nott was trying to reassure Malfoy that it was unlikely Voldemort would mark Draco.
“But that’s...” Harry thought it was ridiculous that the ministry would hire people who weren’t prepared for even simple injuries. “What if they’re the ones that are injured?”
“You know you can always come to me if you need to talk,” McGonagall offered. Harry nodded but privately thought he hadn’t seen McGonagall as someone to confide in since first year.
“I’m not sure yet, but if you have your soul, then clearly James isn’t carrying it around,” Draco said.
As he made his way back to the tower, he nervously cast a lumos using his wand. It was significantly brighter than expected. Harry tried focusing on the feeling of his magic, like Lucius had taught him, and tried to channel only a portion of his magic into the spell. He was only partially successful as his lumos remained brighter than it should be. He knew he’d have to keep practicing before he rejoined his classes.
“Excellent Harry! Excellent. Not that I doubted you,” Slughorn said when he saw Harry’s perfectly brewed potion.
“Yeah,” Harry responded though he sounded resigned. “I just know that’s going to come back to bite me somehow.”
Harry fell into a fitful sleep. He was woken up twice to having dementors at his cell door. The first time, Harry pretended to still be asleep. The second time, he sat up in bed after Crabbe gave a rather particularly loud whimper. Harry watched them as they watched him. There were two dementors this time, but Harry couldn’t tell if they were the same ones he’d seen before. Neither spoke. One dementor hovered back and forth from each end of the cell door. Harry thought it was trying to get as good a look at Harry as it could despite behind unable to move around him. They left after five minutes without saying a word to him. If Harry had any other visitors that night, he slept though it.
judicial-wizard: lawyer. I figure if they use the term medi-witch/wizard for nurses then they might have a different name for lawyers as well.
“Or it was stupid. I could have been released ages ago,” Harry remarked. He may not have been completely spared from Burke’s treatment, but he could have avoided the worst of it.
Harry saw the cloak of a dementor at the edge of his cell before he was consumed by the memory of his mother’s death. He was lost in it, reliving her futile pleas to spare him.
“Of course! They were all...” She paused and a strange sad expression crossed her face. It made Harry uneasy.
More banging noises rang out as the prisoners slowly sat to await for breakfast. Harry recognized the sound of a food tray being pushed across the floor from his time with the Dursleys. Sure enough, eventually two guards entered Harry’s field of vision and slid a food tray into Albert’s cell.
“Move along Jugson,” said Lucius in a tone that was classic Malfoy superiority. The man didn’t even bother turning around to address Jugson when he spoke.
Harry held a photo of Draco in one hand and the photo of Ginny in the other and tried to figure out if this had always been the case. His romantic feelings for Ginny were relatively new but they had been strong. His fantasies had certainly been intense, and just as frequent as the naughty thoughts he had about Draco. Both seemed equally unlikely to happen, so he had resigned himself to a non-existent love life. Until now. Lucius’s encouragement to pursue his son reframed how Harry saw their future. Draco suddenly felt like a real possibility rather than a pipe dream. It was thrilling. With a sigh, he gathered up the photos and left Draco’s photo on top. He tucked them into his pillowcase and hoped the guards wouldn’t bother to check there.
“Actually...” hedged Lestrange. Harry found himself creating two more bottles for the Lestrange brothers. Just as his blush receded, Lucius cleared his throat, causing Harry’s heart to skyrocket.
“Your judicial-wizard would have to petition the court to allow him to bring his wand to the interview room. Unfortunately, this gives the guards advance notice. Since the petition must be specific, the guards would know what memory is to be recorded. Many prisoners have mysteriously been addled just before the memory could be extracted,” explained Lucius. Harry knew his face was ghostly pale as it really sunk in how much power the guards had over his life while he was stuck there.
“It is also not the boy’s first infraction,” continued the auror. “Just before his second year, there was a levitation charm used at his muggle relatives’ residence. The-“
Harry was quiet for a moment before he pointed out, “this is still me trying to do magic. I still don’t know how to stop it from happening accidentally.”
“I allegedly cast the cruciatus curse on Lestrange,” Harry repeated. His voice a bit stronger that time.
“Still, it’s... it’s my fault,” Harry admitted. He was the one that got her pregnant. “I should have been there.”
“You should wait for true love,” Rodolphus added unexpectedly. “Everything is so much better with Belly than any other woman I’ve been with,” he sounded wistful. If Harry hadn’t met the woman, he would picture a saint with the way her husband spoke of her.
“I’ll be ok,” Harry insisted when both Lucius and Albert looked reluctant. To prove his point, Harry decided to finally put on his clothes. He didn’t want to move, especially if it would expose him again. To his surprise, he only had to look at his trousers while wishing to remain stationary, and they flew at him as if summoned. In shock, Harry let go of his sheets to grab the clothes as they hit him in the chest.
Asherath and Isanders debated amongst themselves if anyone in their clan would be able to follow up on Harry’s theory. When it became clear to the dementors that Harry was no longer in a state to contribute to the discussion and planning, the two dementors bid him goodnight and stated they’ll let him know if anyone comes up with a way to test his theory. The dementors leave, happy to have some answers but still confused about the strange soul magic humans used.
Before Harry could offer to create something for the others, Albert insisted that he complete the quiz he had created. This led to them focusing the afternoon on more theoretical topics. Harry knew he was being uncharacteristically invested in coursework, but his fellow prisoners helped keep him motivated. His pride grew when he created a prototype for their hypothetical glasses that could differentiate between an animagus and a natural animal. During the testing phase, Albert and Lucius’ animagus forms were outlined with a neon green glow.  They needed to test the glasses with a born animal, but Harry was convinced they worked. It made him happy that he executed a complex bit of spell work that he helped create. He couldn’t wait to show Hermione.
“Oh... you think James might be carrying my horcrux?” asked Harry. He wondered if that was better or worse than what he feared.
“No. No. I told myself that. That I had to make sure I survived because I had to kill him. It was supposed to be me, Dumbledore said. So, so, I did it. I told myself- I said, it was OK because I would save them, but I
Harry’s chest felt tight, but he couldn’t say if that was from suspecting Lucius was plotting, or from believing Lucius trusted him with Draco’s happiness. Either way, it ground their conversation to a halt. Even Mulciber and the Lestrange brothers let the conversation die out. In the resulting quiet, Harry kept imagining how he could convince Draco for both a date and to hideout at grimmauld place.
“I guess I will also be meeting with my other client today. Bring him here immediately, so I can log his injuries,” Hale said to the guard.
Harry’s state of mind did not improve until he started seeing people other than Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the Weasleys. Seeing Neville helped, though there was a certain amount of guilt there too. It seemed Neville felt the same way.
“I see him too,” the man in the cell beside Malfoy answered. He was in the other cell that Harry could see into. The man was older than Malfoy and he looked familiar to Harry. Unfortunately no last names were coming to mind so Harry wasn’t sure how he knew him.
“When I made the horcrux... er, to make a horcrux, you have to do more than just... kill someone. I...” Harry thought it would be easier to say it while Draco’s head rested on his chest. He could avoid seeing Draco’s expression turn to disgust, but still have the comfort of holding him. However, Harry didn’t know how to get the words out. He’d hidden this secret for years. Draco knew about the horcrux, but he’d never pressured Harry to reveal how it was made. Harry clung to the hope he could live up to the person Draco
Perhaps Burke wasn’t too far off the mark, because a dark part of Harry very much wished that one of the surrounding Death Eaters would find a way to relay that comment back to Voldemort. Someone who went by the moniker “dark lord” would likely take offense to such a bold claim, and consequently try to prove who the darker wizard was by using Burke as target practice.
Harry worked to cast an illusion over Albert’s face that matched his previous injuries. Crabbe helped him remember which injuries went where. As Harry healed the man's other injuries, he placed the illusion on right away to ensure it matched. By the time Harry was done healing everything, Albert was breathing much easier. Surprisingly, so was Harry. He still felt uncomfortable and gross overall, but casting so many spells had helped ease those sensations so they weren’t overwhelming.
“There are many theories about you,” continued Asherath. “Part-dementor, which seemed unlikely as you reacted negatively to my presence until I connected with you... and yet, you can harness our magic.”
“Harry,” McGonagall said once they were back at Hogwarts and away from potential eavesdroppers. Harry tensed as he waited for her to berate him for supporting a known Death Eater. However, when McGonagall finally found her voice, it wasn’t Harry she berated.
In the rubble that used to be his house, Harry chanced upon a ring. It was a dainty thing but had a fairly large ruby in the center. Hermione, ever cautious, had run a number of diagnostic spells to determine if it was safe, before she allowed Harry to pick it up. Finding no magical spells, dark or otherwise, she didn’t protest when Harry pocketed the ring.
Without Burke and Jugson to distract him, Harry was more aware of his surroundings. He was shocked when he realized that many of the men were taking the opportunity to masturbate while the water would wash away the aftermath. Harry didn’t know how they could be comfortable enough to do that in a room full of people. Even if Harry had been alone, he wasn’t confident he would be able to rub one out. Azkaban’s general atmosphere had dulled his sex drive. He was thankful that neither Lucius nor Albert were horny enough to do anything while Harry had a clear view of them.
He recounted how he learnt about the deathly hallows. He was amused by Draco’s reaction to learning the hallows were real and how he’d unknowing been the brief master of the elder wand. As he recounted what he experienced, or thought he experienced in purgatory, a terrible possibility occurred to him.
“Good work, Reginald, as always,” Dumbledore said to Hale. He nodded politely to Perkins before focusing all his attention on Harry. “Harry, my boy, it is good to see you at last,” Dumbledore said warmly. Harry wanted to point out that Dumbledore had plenty of opportunity to see him when he was first sent to Azkaban, but he bit back the retort.
The discomfort both of them felt might have gone on indefinitely had Mrs. Weasley not insisted they talk it over. There had been lots of tears, Harry apologized profusely, and Molly insisted that it was OK. It had been hard for her to say, and hard for Harry to hear, but Molly asserted that James should have two parents to care for him. It hurt that Ginny would never be involved, but James should not be deprived of love because of it. Molly trusted Harry’s judgement that Draco could provide both her boys that love. It had left Harry simultaneously filled with guilt and gratitude.
“You’re young,” Scrimgeour argued as he brushed Harry’s comments aside. “You just don’t grasp the full picture.”
“Of course I’m sure!” Harry hissed and wondered what the man was trying to accomplish. “She did it in front of me! Weren’t you there?”
“Could you pull down the collar of your shirt?” Hale asked as he set down the comb and picked up the camera. “Great. Now, tilt your head... Perfect. Keep that expression.”
“I believe you. You know the worst parts of me, and still somehow see the best. I don’t get it, but I’m not going to fight it. I’m going to be selfish and keep you with me for as long as you’ll have me,” Harry said.
Once again, the wizengamot fell into a vicious back and forth argument. Some confirmed the need for more witnesses, but others insisted that the prisoners were not a trustworthy source. Lucius being named as the only other eyewitness stalled any support Hale gained from wizengamot members.
It was true. Harry had no intention of ever leaving Draco, but he wouldn’t have proposed either. Not because he didn’t love Draco, but because he loved him too much. He would never ask Draco to tie himself even more to Harry’s life. He’d thought about it but wanted to leave Draco with the option of a clean break once he realized Harry really was a monster. But now that Draco had asked, Harry couldn’t say no. He promised to let Draco decide who was worthy of him. Unfortunately, Harry realized there was something he’d have to be painfully honest about so Draco could make an informed decision.
“When we’re ready, we will look at our options,” Draco said. Harry simultaneously realized that Draco did want more kids, and it was something they probably should have discussed before now.
“I’m not conjuring lube for you every time you’re feeling randy,” Harry insisted. He turned to Lucius and asked, “how do I cast a semi-permanent transfiguration?”
“So, what did you really want to talk about? Or do you actually have some forms for me?” asked Harry.
Harry was more than happy to see the guards go. His relief at his own physical safety was tempered by his guilt that Albert hadn’t been as lucky. Whatever reprieve Hale may set up of Harry didn’t extend to the other prisoners.
“Alright,” Harry said despite his doubts. He had no alternative suggestion, so decided to go with their plan.
“How do you feel?” Asherath asked once he was hovering in front of Harry. Next to him was another dementor. Harry thought he was getting better at identifying them, so he felt certain that it was Ishanders with him.
“Souls cannot hide from us,” said Asherath. “We see and sense them no matter how they try to hide,” he gestured towards Lucius’ cell. “Wizards may make themselves smaller, but we always know they are there,” he added. Harry made a mental note to warn Albert and Lucius that their animagus forms didn’t go as unnoticed as they thought.
“I really don’t know what you mean…” Harry whispered. The creature gave some inhuman grunt before turning away. Harry watched as it made its way slowly down the hall until he couldn’t watch it any more. The terrible feelings and memories did not return.
Before Harry made it back to the Gryffindor common room, a younger student stopped him to say Dumbledore wanted to see him in his office. With a sigh, Harry changed direction.
“Vince, could you come here?” Draco asked. Crabbe practically leapt to his feet; Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen him move that fast. Draco realized he wouldn’t have to explain the situation, so he gave Crabbe the mirror and let him pass him into the classroom.
“Making friends, I see,” interrupted a new voice. Burke, the guard that had escorted Harry into the cell strode into view. Harry hadn’t heard him opening the door at the end of the hallway and was surprised to see him.
“We were just making suggestions of spells Potter could have used instead of an unforgivable,” answered Nott in a hard voice.
Not wanting to talk, Harry lay on his cot and ignored everyone. Rodophous tried to coax Harry by taking in that baby voice he and his wife seemed to love so much, but Lucius told him to shut it. Surprisingly the man did. Fortunately, no one tried asking him about quidditch as a means to distract him; if they had, Harry was sure he would have screamed at them.
Dumbledore politely offered Harry tea once they were back at the castle. Harry felt it was mandatory rather than a request, but he didn’t mind. He hadn’t had a cup of tea in ages. He might have used his excess magic to make Azkaban’s food taste better, but it wasn’t the same as the real deal. So, Harry accepted Dumbledore’s offer.
“We remember that all too well,” Mulciber snidely commented. As the others started ribbing Lestrange about some youthful indiscretion where he apparently tried to sneak into the Harpies locker room but instead mistakenly went into the opposing team’s locker room. Apparently, the Moose Jaw Meteorites were not too happy with him.
It took Scrimgeour a minute to get everyone to settle down. The man looked resigned as he went through the motions of adjourning the trial.
"Isn't that a bit... obvious?" Harry asked. He wouldn't deny his crush on Draco since it had long become obvious to his fellow prisoners. But Harry was fairly certain that none of these men’s sons had guessed.
“Not even for Umbridge?” asked Ron. At Harry’s surprise, he elaborated, “people are saying she’ll likely be arrested for what she did last year.”
“I don’t know why you all seem to think Draco will agree to be my boyfriend,” Harry said. Harry knew he wasn’t irresistible.
“And here I thought the novelty of seeing me on my knees for you had worn off,” Draco teased instead of the actual romantic speech he had written out.
The witches and wizards that had wanted to condemn Harry gained some support from other wizengamot members who were less willing to part with ministry funds than they were with parting from a prisoner that had gained too much media attention. But Hale never faltered and countered all objections they put forth. Harry found he was able to enjoy Hale’s wit more now that he’d been pardoned. Harry tried to maintain an innocent expression and the good posture Lucius had instilled in him. He didn’t care about compensation beyond giving Scrimgeour, Runecraft, and the rest a final fuck you.
“Harry!” Hermione exclaimed and flung herself at Harry. She drew him into a surprising hug. Harry’s arms automatically locked around her, tense at first but as soon as his brain processed it, he allowed himself to enjoy the non-threatening contact.
“No. Snape wanted to kick me out after what happened in his class,” Harry explained. He felt vindicated at their outraged expressions. He relayed the whole conversation when they prompted him too.
“Are we sure it’s real?” asked Nott. Harry couldn’t help but instinctively bristle, but he understood their skepticism.
,” Harry insisted. He wouldn’t put it past Snape to bribe a healer to say Harry was unfit for school just so Snape could get Harry kicked out like he’s always wanted.
decide I’m ready?” asked Harry sharply. He knew Snape would take his time in declaring Harry fit. If the man suggested Harry return to the tender loving care of the Dursleys in the meantime, there was going to be another ‘accidental’ crack in the wall. Preferably right above Snape’s head.
“I figured we’d start with us,” Draco explained. “It’s still in an experimental phase. I’m sure it’s safe, even to use on children, but I can’t exactly ask other people to let me test it on their children. And we’d need that if we’re going to look at James’ soul. There’s still so much we don’t know. Like, do souls come into being fully formed, or is it something that grows with time? So, if we tested it on James, and his soul is about half the size of an adult’s, we won’t know if it’s because his soul is still growing or if it’s because he’s half of your fully developed soul. So really, it’s best not to start there. We’d need-”
“Excellent!” Dumbledore said happily. “I’m sure Miss Granger has kept a list of all the homework assignments you missed. You’ll be back on track in no time.”
Harry took the time to mention to Narcissa that Andromeda was interested in reconnecting. He did not say more, leaving it to the two women to decide how to move forward. For a long time, he hadn't been sure whether they did so. It was only about a month and a half later that Harry swung by Andromeda's house to drop off something for Teddy while Draco and Narcissa were visiting. He’d been invited in for a cup of tea. When nothing disastrous happened, Andromeda felt comfortable occasionally inviting Harry over at the same time as the Malfoys. She’d claimed it was because Harry was family too, but Harry suspected she wanted him to keep Draco entertained while she cautiously got to know the person her sister had become.
Halfway through Harry’s modest breakfast, McLaggen gathered enough courage to ask the questions everyone seemed to want to know. When Harry pretended not to hear him, the older boy grew increasingly loud and his questions turned into rude comments. Harry tried not to let it bother him. He knew it was suspect when the saltshaker kept falling into McLaggen’s meal, but Harry felt secure that no one would immediately jump to the conclusion that Harry had mastered silent and wandless magic. After McLaggen’s bravery, Harry noticed more and more people blatantly listened to his conversations with his friends. Harry managed to make it through the entire meal, but he’d developed a tension headache by the time his first class started.
Burke took a moment to admire his work before he moved his wand back to Harry’s neck. The sharp pain returned.
to him. They’d been his support system and he felt a little lost without them now. Perhaps Burke had been right when he accused Harry of having ‘daddy issues’. Harry honestly couldn’t tell if his messed-up childhood had an impact on how he felt about his relationship with the other prisoners. Harry had never felt more supported than those otherwise miserable weeks in Azkaban, but he couldn’t help but fear that it meant more to him than it did to them. Then, he felt guilty for doubting them.
“He misses you and your mum... he gets this look whenever he’d talk about you. I don’t know, he just... stopped being a prisoner for a moment. That doesn’t make sense! It’s like...” Harry struggled with how to express it, but he tried because Draco hung to every word he said. “Thinking about you brought back all the good that Azkaban sucked out.”
Draco strove to find a way to settle the matter. For him it honestly didn’t matter if James was Harry’s son, carrying his horcrux, or was the other half of Harry’s soul. Either way, Draco loved them both. But it weighed on Harry. So, Draco continued his research and tried to develop a plan for all of the possible outcomes. He was nervous when, after years of research, he thought he finally had a way to answer it.
The space in front of him was immediately filled with a white light. It was bright enough that Harry had to give his eyes time to adjust before he saw anything besides
The papers were split. As Kingsley anticipated, a good portion of the public was not keen on pardoning any Death Eater. However, Harry was still the Boy who Lived (Twice) which garnered support or at least a willingness to listen. He might not have been the one to kill Voldemort in the end, but it was common knowledge that Harry, Ron and Hermione had spent the war weakening Voldemort.
“He’s got a point,” Lucius added. “We don’t yet know enough about horcruxes. If we can research them and understand the theory, we may be able to safely move the dark lord’s soul.” Even though the man didn’t outright offer his own library and was careful not to mention what would happen to the soul shard once removed from Harry, Harry felt Lucius was just as invested in saving Harry as Crabbe.
Harry used the marauders map as inspiration to have the shrinking and enlarging triggered with a password. He spent over an hour trying to figure out how to do it without disrupting the other enchantments on each object. He was glad he’d chosen the bottle to run his tests as his first attempt resulted in the bottle returning to a rock before it crumbled into dust. Oddly, it also left behind a smell that reminded Harry of the roll caps Dudley used to play with as a kid. His second attempt wasn’t any better. The bottle shrank but the lube inside didn’t. It left a huge mess – luckily it was as easily banished as it had been to conjure. Harry was frustrated and tempted to give. He also considered waking Albert up as the man was good at problem solving, but he wanted to see if he could do it on his own. He determined that if he was unable to succeed by morning, he would ask the man for help. Harry was glad he decided to keep trying, as he was eventually successful.
"I don't care about your routine. HARRY POTTER'S GAY DRACO! BLOODY GAY" He laughed "Can you  believe it. Draco. Draco??"
Hey I'm back, I've been trying to write and I am,but then I write and look back and go "Well this fucking sucks" and delete the entire chapter :).
“I miss him too,” Draco said softly, but managed to keep his voice steady. “He... spoke about you too... in his letters,” Draco added.
“What’s another way to make a transfiguration permanent?” he asked. He was proud of his creation and wanted the brush to last. Lucius guided him in using blood magic to lock in the spell. The benefit of this method was that anyone other than Harry would have a hard time reversing the magic. The downside was that the spell would reverse itself at Harry’s death. Harry knew most people would be wary of using blood magic as it was a branch of magic that often intersected with dark arts. However, Harry knew this type of magic could be used for good. The wards meant to protect him during the summer used blood magic. Harry also recalled that Slughorn claimed his mother gave him a transfigured fish that reverted back upon her death. Harry suspected his mum had been rather gifted in blood magic.
They let Harry leave shortly after. He was tired by the time he got to the common room. He wanted nothing more than to sleep the rest of the day away, but since he no longer could sleep, he had no escape. Harry debated pretending to go to sleep just avoid everyone, but as soon as he spotted his friends, he knew they weren’t done with him yet.
if there’s something between you and boy Weasley, I’d want to know that bit of gossip,” Theo teased.
“I’ll protect Draco’s virtue while you’re gone,” Zabini offered with a grin. Parkinson looked like she wanted to send Zabini to fetch Theo instead, but she eventually gave in.
“I’ve never seen anyone aside from the dark lord withstand the dementors let alone talk to them,” Nott stated.
‘Take a chill pill’, ‘cool your jets’, and ‘keep your shirt on’ are the more 90s sounding slang that Harry probably would have used given the timeline, but I couldn’t resist the more vulgar ‘calm your tits’ since he’s saying it to Mulciber. I kind of hate the expression ‘calm your tits’, but it’s something Mulciber would get a kick out of so it snuck in there.
Based on previous comments, I know some of you were hoping for an angry Harry, holding a Harley Quinn sized mallet, ready to play whack-a-mole with Dumbledore, Ron and Hermione... but this isn’t exactly a bashing fic. I do think Dumbledore’s actions towards Harry are morally questionable, but Harry isn’t going to start hating his guts. I totally understand the impulse to slap Dumbledore on Harry’s behalf. However, Harry admires Dumbledore on some level. He’s hurt that the headmaster never visited him and is scared to confirm his belief that Dumbledore knows about the horcrux in him. He might even pick up on Dumbledore’s attempts to manipulate him. There are definitely trust issues between them, but Harry isn’t going to go around cursing him or anything. Elements of “bashing” might pop up because their relationship is fractured and Harry might be more critical about what Dumbledore wants from him. But it will be softcore bashing, at most.
“I thought you weren’t going to cause any trouble,” said Burke and roughly pulled Harry back upright. “We don’t take too kindly to troublemakers here, Potter.”
“Er, it didn’t work,” Harry lied. He was embarrassed that it only took one attempt to successfully create a realistic candid photo of Draco compared to the numerous attempts he'd needed for Bellatrix. Draco’s photo looked vibrant where Bellatrix’s was dark. Harry pretended to fumble his next two attempts with creating a decent photo of Draco. It was partly because he did not want to be teased about his crush, but mostly he wanted to keep a few photos for himself. On his fourth ‘attempt’, he duplicated his favourite picture and sent it over to Lucius.
“I don’t want to die, Gin. I really don’t,” he reassured her. He briefly caught her eye and was touched at the love and concern that was there. Not that he deserved it after what he’d done, but Harry was greedy and needy enough to accept it. “But he’s killed so many already. He won’t stop until I’m dead too. I’ve accepted the very real possibility I could die... so I... I...” Harry floundered and looked at the ring helplessly.
Having grown up with the Dursleys, Harry believed that. “Yeah, people kind of suck that way,” he stated. It wasn’t a new notion for him that some people were just angry and vengeful. It was probably foolish of him to assume there would be guards in place to protect him. Umbridge was proof enough that ministry employees could be bitter and corrupt.
“What if, for every dark art spell the Lestrange brothers teach you, they show you two defense spells? Preferably one of those defense spells would be to counter or heal the effects of that dark spell,” Lucius proposed.
“Not as far as I can tell,” Harry stated. While he though the news would make Nott feel relieved, Harry remembered that they were surrounded by other death eaters. Not helping in a task set by Voldemort might actually backfire later on. “I think Malf, er,
Burke glanced back towards the showers. There weren’t that many prisoners left given that the water was rather cold by now. Jugson still seemed to be in the shower area.
“Er, actually, yes, sort of anyway,” Harry admitted awkwardly. He tried to think of a way to make it less creepy. “I figured you’d want
, but yours is not the hint of a developing soul. Your extra piece was already full grown. A fraction, to be sure, but still a part of a fully-grown soul.”
“It’s unfair,” Mrs. Weasley said when Harry quieted down enough to hear her. “It’s unfair, and I hate it, but it’s not your fault.”
Instead, Harry spent his afternoon working on the mirror. He read through the books Theo had lent him with ease after he’d had a crash course on the subject. As he added to the notes Theo had started. Harry took care to print clearly as he’d already caught Theo squinting at Harry’s usual messy scrawl.
Standing at the bars of his cell was a dementor. Harry couldn’t see into its hood, but he knew without a doubt that the creature was staring right at him. Harry didn’t understand why his worst memories had stopped replaying in his head if the creature was not only very close but had his full attention trained on him. Harry was suddenly very grateful for the bars separating them.
“Just meant that before I met you, I would have assumed you’d be a spoiled brat too. You know, being the saviour and all,” Mulciber explained. “That spoiled cousin of yours – he the one you live with?”
“Alright, maybe, maybe some better workers, or what’s it called… sensitivity training? Yeah, maybe that’d be alright?” Ron said. Harry didn’t know what to do with that. He knew Ron was trying, maybe even genuinely supported his own suggestions, but Harry knew he was still skeptical on how much the prison should change. Harry didn’t know how he’d convince the public if he couldn’t even convince his best mates.
Harry struggled with selecting a gift for Albert as well, much to his surprise. He felt close to the man given their daily interactions, but Albert kept a lot of his personal life private. Harry created an enchanted razor as he knew the man didn’t like asking the guards to remove his stubble. Yet, Harry felt this gift wasn’t enough. It didn’t convey the gratitude he felt for everything the man had done for him. Harry wanted to create something personal, but had few personal details to draw inspiration from. He knew the man was a widower with a son Harry’s age. The man’s animagus form was a porcupine. His wife’s form had been a sparrow. Harry wanted to incorporate an etching of a sparrow in whatever he created, but found he had trouble picturing a sparrow clear enough for the spell to work. Much like the static pictures he had created before, Harry needed several attempts before he was satisfied with the results. In the end, there were only three stone blocks with sparrow engravings that Harry ended up being satisfied with. Harry created three more stone blocks and added a porcupine engraving to each. He found this easier given he had seen the Albert’s animagus form recently. He arranged the blocks to form a box. He fused together the bottom and side blocks but charmed the top block to slide back and forth. On a whim, Harry charmed the inside of the box to give off a soft glow.
Neville’s visits were the only ones he never felt any sort of trepidation with. He loved Ron and Hermione, he did, but they were clearly waiting for Harry to open up about his feelings (Hermione), or reminisce about Ginny’s past antics (Ron). Both were things he wasn’t ready for, and Neville was the only one who didn’t push it or look at him expectantly. Early on, Neville had offered to tell him about the time he’d missed, having spent lot of time supporting Ginny during her pregnancy, but when Harry had shamefully admitted he wasn’t ready to hear it – that he may never be ready to hear it – Neville never brought it up again; the only one seemingly content to let it be.
"I never said you were" She smiled brightly "Now give me your stuff I'll bring it home, you take your car and go celebrate with the Weasley's, and I'm sure you want to see the end of Ginny's game right"? She winked.
"We gotta get back to the school for my car" He replied, and with that he texted his parents. 'sorry I'm on my way home, got caught up' He'd explain it later. Hopefully his parents would believe a quick bite with a friend lasted 5 hours.
"Hey kids" Lily smiled as she walked into the kitchen from the living room "Harry you're home earlier then usual, nothing to get up to at the highschool. Or has the high of finally having your own car finally wear off"?
"Well I don't know, but I kissed you" He laughed again before becoming serious "Harry I really like you, you know. Maybe we could do something like this again" There it was.
Harry jogged down the staircase, coming to enjoy dinner with his family. Lilly looked at her eldest son her mother instinct told her something was wrong. On the outside he didn't seemed that off-when he knew you were watching of course. But Lily knew. She knew when to look. She knew that everytime he was using that fake smile that he was dying on the inside. He seemed alright to everyone else but he was barely picking at his Chicken Parm-one of his favorites.
I hope you all liked this chapter, I have many ideas, don't worry this is the first step to our boys being together a little hint Henry is a sweeper so is Draco so just keep that in mind ;).
Getting through the day was pretty easy considering Harry complained of a headache and slept through his Algebra quiz, and health class. Going to his brother's game was a relief and before driving across the street to the middle school, Harry drove to the gas station for an energy drink and doughnut. He bought a Gatorade and candy bar for both Henry and Haley, then made his way to the green as the game was just starting. His parents were there and a couple kids from his team as well. Haley had a longer practice going on then went into watch her friend's volleyball game. His stomach lept when he saw Ginny across the field and wave to him. He was going to have to do something about this problem. He didn't want to call her that but it was a problem. A pretty big problem.
"Nothing, but I heard about what happened with Ginny" Harry sighed and looked down "Also heard about you snogging Wood" He laughed while adding "Heard it wasn't half bad" Harry looked up to a smirking boy.
Harry didn't tell his family what was happening and stayed in his room drinking his dad's rum up. He didn't need to check his phone to know by all the phone buzzing he was getting that his secret was out. It sucked but Ginny was right-what no she wasn't. Why not now? Umm how about the fact that Harry had figured out just days before that who he was. But now the entire Sophomore, Junior and Senior class knew he liked Dick. So what. Fuck 'em.
Draco approached his car, taking his time as he walked at a leisurely pace. The game had been okay, but it's hard to concentrate while running backwards, when the star striker's ass is right there. I mean come on, have you ever tried running backwards? On its own it's pretty difficult to look out for other players, and the goal post if you go too far. Now try running attempting to concentrate on not colliding with fellow team members, and your opponents, as a perfect ass, and human is in front of you. But Draco couldn't date Potter. Why?
Harry walked up to his room after a post school, post practice snack. Draco wouldn't be at practice next Tuesday, he'd be there for the game, so that was a good thing. Harry was just so confused. He looked around at his room, it was pretty nice. The walls were painted a blue that resembled on of a mid-day sky, with a twin sized bed pushed up against his wall by the window, tucked away in the corner. He had a couch on the other side of the cluttered floor where, He, Ron and Hermonie would sit and do homework, when his siblings were taking up the counter tops in the kitchen. There was his closest and desk, piled high with homework. His walls had pictures of soccer players like Messi and Suraez. The team colors of his school-red and gold-stood on his walls with HAOS banners and a team jersey that read Potter on it hung on the center of the wall next to two local London bands posters.
Harry ran into Sprout before the end of lunch. He didn’t have her class that day, so she took the opportunity to check in with him then.
Next to him, McGonagall scoffed. Harry was certain she had already figured out what angle Hale was setting up. Harry thought the man was mostly successful. He didn’t get much out of the first ministry worker, but the second one became flustered at Hale’s questions. Hawkworth had tried to dismiss him early, but Hale pressed on until the man covered everything Hale wanted him to.
Unfortunately, Harry never seemed to change their minds. Neither did they succeeded in changing Harry’s mind. So, while Harry found the lessons initially intriguing, they inevitably ended in the same arguments with both sides frustrated.
“Is it because they’re muggles? We won’t judge you if you love the muggles that raised you,” Lestrange offered.
“Oh, save it, Potter,” Burke snapped. “I’ve been reading all about your innocent victim spiel. It’s dragonshit. I’ve already told the reporters that you’re guilty and getting what you deserve, just like everyone else,” he punctuated that statement by jerking Albert’s arm. He glared at Harry before adding, “it’s just a matter of time until they see it too.”
The dementors made a particularly loud rattling sound. Harry was struck with a fear that they would attempt to suck his soul out despite the distance between them and wished he’d learn to keep his mouth shut. However, two of the dementors turned their attention to the third.
“Of course, Harry. I wouldn’t expect any less from one of my star pupils!” Slughorn complimented. Harry smiled until the professor moved on to check on someone else’s potion. With Slughorn out of the way, Harry noticed Zabini had been watching the exchange. He raised his eyebrows at Harry. Harry’s attempts at manipulation were probably too blunt for a seasoned Slytherin, but Slughorn’s ego was big enough that it worked. Still, Harry blushed at being caught, though he only sent a shrug as a response.
His mother’s ring was a mangled mess. The band was broken and twisted twice over. He didn’t know how Mrs. Weasley had managed to get it to stay on a chain, but magic must have been involved. It no longer remotely resembled a ring, but Harry knew it for what it was. Even the lack of ruby in the center piece did not throw Harry off.

Harry supposed he could also provided a second patronus if need be, but the man was watching Harry so intently that he probably wouldn’t notice if any dementors got close enough for a kiss.
