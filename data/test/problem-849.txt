“What? Oh yeah, of course” Harry said, too busy watching Cedric coming closer.

And then, it was fine, you know? Year ten and eleven were good years. We found our groove as a friendship group, and it was like the three of us against the world, you know? And then after out gcse’s we had a group of Romanian exchange students, and one of them asked me to the year eleven prom, and I said yes because a boy had never shown interest in me like that, and it turns out that Ron had been building up the courage to ask me, but Victor got there first and it turned into a whole thing, really put a dampener on our gcse summer, and poor Harry got stuck in the middle of us.”
The opportunity for said revenge came when he was arrested. The temporary respite was more than welcome. I knew that interfering with my father’s politics was a death sentence, especially with Potter raving about the Dark Lord being back. I wished merely to create a thorn in his side; something small yet chafing and impossible to ignore.
“Yeah mate, look at that!” exclaimed Ron, bumping Harry’s shoulder as they strode back to their building to shower and dress for dinner. He would have to write to Sirius about it, it would make him happy to know that Harry would be safe here.
Harry felt fucking awful. He knew it wasn’t his fault, but he couldn’t help like his flirting had given Blaise the wrong idea- but then again, Harry was always clear about his relationship with Draco, and he was the same with Pansy, who had never ever made a move on him. It was all so fucked. The friendship group he had only just gained had been cleaved down the middle, and he couldn’t help but feel somewhat responsible.
Draco flushed with embarrassment, deeply ashamed at being so openly vulnerable, and to Harry, no less, whose parents were dead. Draco had no right to complain. Draco was about to say as much when he found himself crushed against Harry’s torso, Harry’s arms strong around him.
“that creature is not sleeping in the tent with us tonight Potter.” Malfoy said, eyeing Talgarth with distrust.
Draco kisses him sweetly on the cheek before leaving.
Harry and Ron looked at each other as they heard footsteps go down the hall and then stop, as Cedric presumably went to the other room on this floor.
That was one thing Draco hadn’t missed. He hated them for their noise, their all-consuming presence. However, weak as he is, he couldn’t help but seek Harry in the throng. His eyes roamed over the mountains of muscle before alighting on their target. He was in baggy, straight legged light blue jeans and a massively over-sized crewneck sweatshirt. He looked as if he had been catapulted straight out of the nineties, and fuck if it didn’t look fantastic on him.
October came and went, and Draco found himself nursing a firewhiskey in the common room, sat by Neville at the eighth year’s Halloween ‘extravaganza’ as Dean described it. It was fun, he thought. Good decorations, good food, good drink. He looked around him again and couldn’t help but notice the blaring lack of the golden trio. He had initially assumed they would be having their own celebrations, but it was coming up to midnight now and he knew Ron wasn’t one to miss a party, and where Ron went, the other two followed.
Draco chocked on his coffee as Dean laughed, and Harry slapped Seamus’ chest.
Sirius looked surprised, which Draco hadn’t been expecting, and he suddenly doubted the offer for him to take the cottage.
Harry smiled weakly up at her, knowing she’s right but not quite able to believe it.
“Harry.” Draco said, turning to him and fear flooded Harry that Draco would try and make him talk about it.
in case you're confused about Draco's birthday not being in June, I took the creative liberty to move it to July for the purpose of Draco and Harry sharing a birthday month (for the purposes of this plot, it matters)
“I don’t know how interested you are in rugby, but the first proper match against another school is in two weeks. You should come. It’s a home game so on our fields, yeah” Harry whispered as Draco desperately tried to copy the lesson notes he’d missed from Harry’s notebook.
He returned to the car with Harry, Hermione and Remus, and they drove home in tired yet companionable silence. When they arrived back at the farm, Sirius was talking to the Weasley matriarch as Charlie and Ron carried out the big bench from the kitchen into the stretch of grassy lawn between the big farmhouse and Draco’s little cottage. Once it was set down and Bill and one of the twins- Draco was hard pressed to tell them apart- had brought out the benches, Molly ushered Sirius into a seat and the others all piled in around him as Harry and Remus went off into one of the many barns, and Hermione and Ron disappeared back into the kitchen.
They both fell silent and turned to him when he closed the front door, before the both abruptly burst out laughing. Draco felt a flush rise on his cheeks in embarrassment as they mocked him, made worse by the fact that he didn’t know what was so amusing to them.
It had been a pub night, and me and Potter were making our way home when he stopped and turned to me, and confessed his sodding love to me. Well, not quite. It was all “I really like you” and “you’re funny and smart and better than me in every way”- well, not quite. But there were a lot of compliments, and he said “I really think this could work” That was the sentence that stuck with me. I liked Potter, I mean who wouldn’t? all tall dark and handsome with green eyes and good with children, and since my lecture he really was kind. Always making me cups of tea and doing dinner and things that make my heart melt. I like him too, a lot, too much even, but I’m not stupid. “I really think this could work” of course it couldn’t. I’m the ex-death eater, the only one on the wrong side not in Azkaban apart from Goyle and maybe Pansy, if she counts, and I did more for Voldemort than the other two combined, and thus I am the public scapegoat for any and all frustrations left over from the war. I could never be with Potter. The public wouldn’t let us. Hell, even his friends probably wouldn’t let us. I knew he was wrong, I knew we could never work, and so what else could I do except lie through my teeth?
“So, you wanna talk? Or distraction?” Harry says, looking at the ceiling and Draco marvels at how considerate he is, how empathetic.
Harry carried on in the same fashion, and Draco found himself actually understanding. It killed him to admit it, but Harry was not only better than him at French, but also an excellent teacher.
“calm down ‘mione, they’re not on a limited time frame, they’ll still be there in five minutes. Can’t a man eat first?” groaned Ron, barely awake with his robes all wrinkled and his tie undone. Hermione’s reply of “you’re always eating Ronald” reminded Harry an awful lot of Molly Weasley.
“I'll always be here” Draco replied, relaxing into Harry’s warmth.
Achilles come down, by Gang of Youths
The peace of the morning was corrupted when a green-looking Ron stumbled in, clearly more hungover than Harry, and almost certainly still drunk. “fuck Harry-“, here the redhead blanched, pressing a freckled hand to his mouth as he gagged. Once the vomit-scare was over (definitely still drunk, thought Draco), he wacked Harry’s head with his wand, yelling about how they were late for quidditch practice. Harry leapt up, hair still shimmering, pulled on his quidditch gear and ran out the door after Ron, mumbling something that sounded suspiciously like “I’m never bloody listening to Seamus again”.
The moment was interrupted, however by Malfoy drawling “oh Weasel, I think our esteemed Saviour has designs on your girlfriend”
“Just you being here is enough” Harry whispered into Draco’s neck.
“of course we will Harry. Of course”
I can’t bear to face him, but I feel as though I have no choice, and so I get up, wipe my face and wrench my door open and I spit “what, over me already, Potter” with all the venom I can muster.
That Sunday with Andy, she gushed over her coffee with Narcissa, seeming brighter and more alert than in recent months. Harry’s heart warmed at the improvements he saw in her demeanour. They had a lovely afternoon, Andy playing with Teddy in earnest, and conversing with wit. The next Monday, Draco showed up at 9 sharp, drastically overdressed for a day spent with a baby. Harry was in a pair of cargo trousers that used to belong to Charlie Weasley, and a Weasley jumper. The jumper was soft for Teddy to sleep against, and the cargos were useful as harry could put snacks and toys in the copious pockets. Draco however was in pressed black slacks and a cream sweater that looked as if it cost more than Harry’s entire wardrobe. Harry laughed, “as amazing as you look Draco, those are not suitable clothes for our activities”. He turned back to preparing Teddy’s snacks for the day, missing the way Draco’s cheeks burned red at the compliment. “I don’t own clothes like yours” the blond replied. Much to Harry’s surprise his tone wasn’t sneering or disdainful, just neutrally honest. “okay then Draco, we will take you shopping as your first outing. You’ll need comfy clothes that you don’t mind getting too dirty.” Said Harry. Draco looked horrified at the word ‘dirty’ but nodded, nonetheless.
He was soon distracted by the food they were organising. They had sandwiches that had been kept fresh under a stasis charm. Today was the only day they would have nice-ish food. There were cereal bars and chocolate as well. All in all it was a weak, childish picnic, and Draco had never been so eager to eat a meal in his life.
He took an extra long luxurious shower, and was just settling into his armchair with a book when he heard a knock on the door to his cottage. He opened the door and standing on the doorstep was Pansy, who immediately launched herself into his arms. Due to the extra muscle he had gained doing farm work he caught her, barely stumbling, and gripped her tight to his chest, her legs wrapped around his hips.
Draco took this as his cue to knock on the door jamb and poke his head in.
“yea mate, he was looking at your arse as if it was Jesus” laughed Seamus.
“I’ll make some tea, and we’ll sit on the sofa and talk, yeah?”
“Yeah. between her and Bryn sometimes I just want t’run away from here and not come back”
Harry noticed Draco staring and stood up, waiting for Draco to cross the room
“Come on, let’s take advantage of the free champagne. He’s probably gone back inside, so if you could continue the girlfriend act…?”
“ate dinner in bed with my mum”
Eventually, Harry left, promising to come back in a few days to finish the project. When Draco returned to his room, he tried not to feel like his bed looked empty without Harry lounging on it.
“Spending time with Draco, what does it look like?” Hermione replied somewhat coldly, and Draco silently cheered at being defended so quickly.
“What time is it?” He asked Ron as they approached Harry’s farm.
The first Tuesday of the holiday found Harry back in Draco’s room, as they decided what to do for their project. Draco had spent an hour deciding what to wear, which was futile because almost his clothes were the same style, or the same colour. He decided on jeans, again, because Harry wore a lot of jeans, and his denim dungarees, and then a soft long sleeve jersey top that Pansy had bought him.
It almost seemed as if Harry was having relationship drama… about a boy. That didn’t make sense though. Rugby boys weren’t gay… they couldn’t be. They were always so mockingly homophobic. But it really sounded as if Harry had had a run in with an ex-something.
Harry finished his rant, closing his eyes and resting his head on the back of the sofa. Draco was momentarily distracted by his jawline, but only momentarily. He was too occupied with their conversation.
“Draco, my sweet. I think I need some time alone, now. Why don’t you run back to Harry, hmm?” she said, her voice tight with emotion.
“Blaise. Stop it now” said Pansy with a sharp look. Harry admired how she brought him to heel so swiftly.
“you two can stay with me again tonight yea?” he said to Dean and Seamus who nodded.
“book 16?” Draco asked, and Harry nodded mournfully. Then he turned and fiddled with the black box on his bedside table that Draco now knew to be a modified version of a muggle speaker, and soon a deep, strong and melancholy voice filled the space.
“Blackbird singing in the dead of night...”
“Did you notice that too?” Harry asked me, coming to stand in between my legs.
Draco hadn’t meant for it to sound so… disbelieving. Condescending. Impolite. Possibly even cruel, but alas, he had managed to sound like the biggest arse alive.
Harry tracked Hermione down in the library, closing her textbook so she had to pay attention to him. He learned forward, and relayed his plan to her, desperately hoping she wouldn’t disapprove.
“Oh, like me and Luna” Harry said. Draco snorted.
He opened his eyes again, and the twins drew him into a conversation that felt mocking but wasn't overtly cruel. Draco couldn't quite place his finger on it but it definitely felt a bit like they were making fun of him. Sirius then rescued him by calling down the table if he liked the cider, and when Draco voiced his affirmation, Sirius described how it was homemade by them on the farm.
“I’ll just incendio it” he said, shrugging. “Potter, in case you hadn’t noticed, you don’t have a wand. None of us do”
“Blaise kissed me, and I think it’s fucked everything up” he said into her hair. Speaking the words out loud made a weight settle onto his shoulders that dragged everything down towards the centre of the earth.
No sooner had she finished talking then came a knock at the door. Remus stood outside, in a smart-looking short sleeved button down that was at least a size and a half too big.
“That sounds really tough,” Draco said in what he hoped was a soothing tone. Hermione huffed.
Harry woke early, and he and Pansy sipped tea in sombre silence at the kitchen table whilst they waited for Draco to emerge, but he never did. It seemed that Draco’s alcohol-fuelled optimism dissipated over-night, and when it reached 11 am with no sign of him, Harry sighed and said to Pansy, “I think you should go and talk to him”
Harry doesn’t know what he did to deserve a best friend like Hermione.
“Luna, darling. Come to the ball with me? Ah, great, I’ll see you then. Tell me what colour suit to wear.”
I hate him for his patience, and for how right he is, and for how much I want him still, even after I saw him with his tongue down another man’s throat. Just as he’s about to close my door I say “wait”, my voice scratchy and hoarse.
Even if I know that I am feeling it, as I watch Potter drink the rest of my coffee like he does every morning, before kissing my forehead and going to shower before his lecture.
A few hours later, Harry found himself on Regents street with Pansy on his arm. They were receiving many appraising stares. He guessed they did make a striking couple. Pansy was in a skin-tight leather skirt and silken blouse, and he was laden with bags full of designer clothing that she had picked out. She had even bought him some obscenely expensive items. She said they were a ‘thank you’ for him letting her stay at Grimmauld, and buying lunch the day before. She said the reason she was able to buy clothes at certain shops here was because she had set up a tab that went straight to Gringotts, so she needn’t worry about money at all whilst shopping. Pansy was growing on Harry massively, especially as she had bought for him some stunning silk shirts from the Selfridges.
“Shit, shit wait wait” he says, fumbling in the pocket of his trousers. Harry always wears suits, never robes to these things, insisting that if he’s going he’s going to be comfortable.
“of course, it’s not very interesting though.”
“ooh, bad boy Draco”
“you tempt me Potty, you really do. If I wasn’t such a loyal friend, it would be my hand not Finnegan’s there right now” sighed Blaise. Harry genuinely could not tell if the boy was being serious or not, so he just decided to go along with the joke.
She nattered on though, talking about her day completely oblivious to the missing person, which Draco could see was making Sirius and Remus uncomfortable, likely because it showed the progression of her illness.
All too soon for Draco’s liking, Dean, Seamus and Neville bustled in, arms full of Honeydukes sweets and contraband firewhiskey. They all nodded, or smiled at him as they entered, something that made Draco feel better than he would ever admit to. Harry and Hermione came in, a limping Ron between them, and the group settled themselves on the floor, Ron’s bad leg stretched out in front of him, and Hermione fussing over it. Harry waved his wand at his speaker and the room filled with music. “it’s our playlist, tonight Ron!” he yelled triumphantly as a man’s voice filled the room, and all the Gryffindor boys immediately started to sing along
“what happened tonight, Harry?” asked Hermione gently, sensing Harry’s distress.
The days until Wednesday passed without incident. He, Ron and Hermione shared a chocolate cake Monday night after Teddy had gone to bed. He didn’t tell them about his imminent meeting with the Malfoys, scared they would distrust Malfoy and accuse Harry of putting Teddy in harm’s way by allowing Draco into his home. He had received Narcissa’s confirmation of her and Draco’s attendance on Monday afternoon. It was a painfully formal letter, but nevertheless she graciously accepted his invitation. Tuesday passed in a blur of preparation. Harry wished to make something somewhat impressive, and also provide a selection, desperately wanting to impress the Malfoys, who were the wizarding version of aristocracy, or landed gentry. He strapped Teddy to his chest before setting off to Tesco, already used to the weird looks he received from muggles for being so young with a baby that was a stark pale to his dark skin. He got all the ingredients he needed. On a whim, he ventured into Covent Garden to get a selection of loose-leaf tea from the fancy tea shop there.
And, oh fuck, but it was yet another thing Draco hadn’t meant to say out loud, but obviously did, because the universe hated him.
“Right, Harry this is Draco. You’ll show him where he’s staying before Ron comes, and I’ll pack youse some sandwiches for t'night” Remus said, and Harry nodded, getting up and hefting Draco’s duffle bag into his shoulder before gesturing at Draco to leave the kitchen.
“Oh hey! Draco” from the other sofa, he looked up and found himself staring directly into disarmingly green eyes.
(Friday evening, 05/09/1998)
Draco sat up properly at that, thinking. He had never thought he held people at arm's length, but then again, he was on his first proper sleepover ever at the age of sixteen.
Draco’s mother had hand delivered his suit, in that she was driven to the school by their chauffeur, and brought the suit in a special case. Draco had gone for classic black, with the lapels of the jacket, the tie, the pocket square and the satin back panel of the waistcoat decorated in an emerald floral print. It was one of his favourites, and if he had chosen the green to compliment Harry’s eyes then no-one needed to know.
Potter sounded so infuriatingly gentle and he had brought Draco food and he had noticed Draco’s absence and he wanted to talk and it was all just too much. He unlocked the door with his wand from the bed, as more treacherous tears slid down his damp cheeks. He felt the bed dip as Potter sat, and he looked up to see what dinner Potter had thought to bring him.
Smeared with oil like David’s boy
So they talked, and talked and talked. Harry talked about being adopted into the Weasley’s, and about how he, Ron and Hermione were a formidable gang at their old secondary school. Harry talked about the music he likes- lots of Bowie- and about how he looks like he stepped out of the nineties because he wears his dad’s jumpers that Sirius kept for him.
Maybe, just maybe this won’t be so bad after all, I think as Potter stands behind me and slides his arms around me, pressing kisses to my back and shoulders.
“i don’t think any of mine would fit you... let me ask my mum if she has anything” Draco said, suddenly realising that of course Harry wasn’t going to sleep in his clothes, and he had only asked for a t-shirt, which meant he would be spending a whole night next to Harry who would only be wearing a t shirt and underwear. Oh god.
Blaise sighed and replied with “I do, Potter, I do.”
“That's amazing, love” Remus said, pressing a soft, chaste kiss to Sirius’ lips. “You should invite her here, t’farm. We could have a family dinner; you, and her, and Draco, all the outcast Black’s together.”
They say yous a monster
Draco looked up and found himself prisoner in Harry’s stare. Harry grunted, waving his hand and the mess Draco had made disappeared. Trust Harry Potter to be powerful enough to do wandless magic while so incapacitated.
“you can’t just do that Draco. Just bring strange men home like that” Harry hissed.
“you can come and see him whenever you like, lord knows I need the help.” Laughed Harry.
Draco was sure that if he hadn’t been in love, he was now.
“I got something special for Draco too, if he lets me put it on him” she said, with a mischievous look on her face as she looked through all her bags before uttering a triumphant “aha!” and pulling something out. It was another silk shirt, this one a pale pink, bordered with green and decorated with small birds and banners. Harry loved it, and said as much.
“You want to? Do you want to now?” Harry said, hand still stroking against Draco’s head.
Harry and Ron came and went two more times, for the table and the other bench, and while Ron was cheery and earnestly wished Draco a happy birthday, Harry was studiously avoiding looking at him. Draco sighed internally. If that was how Harry wanted to play it, so be it. Draco was over it already, not that there was really anything to be ‘over’, but as much as he was aware that Harry was attractive, he utterly refused to play cat-and-mouse with someone that would blow hot and cold and pity him. And frankly, at almost twenty years old, Harry shouldn’t have to be told by others when he was acting in a stupid manner.
“It’s two Ps and an M intertwined” he explains, and I know he means the nicknames of all maurauders but one. A tear splashes onto the ring as a lift it from the box.
“I wouldn’t want to have to serve your balls up tomorrow” harry laughed.
Sirius pushed his half-drunk mug towards Harry, who accepted it gratefully and drank all of what was left at once, setting the cup down with a gentleness that seemed at odds with the strength he clearly possessed, before he swiped a hand across his mouth in an action that shouldn’t have been as attractive as it was.
He undressed Teddy, and made up a small bath with the bucket he kept for that purpose. Teddy, intent on being a nuisance, kept splashing around eventually Harry was completely soaked. Pansy was having the time of her life, offering no help at all and laughing as Harry got steadily soggier. Eventually, Harry gave up and stripped off his shirt for the remainder of Teddy’s bath, before drying and dressing him and settling him into his cot, making sure the baby monitoring spell was properly in place.
Draco is shocked for what feels like the seventh time that day when Harry reaches out to him, and pulls him onto the sofa next to Hermione. Draco sits stiffly, but feels warmth flood him when Hermione lays her bushy-haired head on his shoulder.
“This is on the republic” was all he said, wincing as it came out cold rather than explanatory. He really was fucking awful at making friends. No wonder he only had about 4 at school in a year of about 200.
Then, at breakfast, Harry had said ‘hope to see you after the game, blondie’ and Draco had felt all warm inside ever since. Apparently, there was going to be a little party afterwards, to which Harry and Ron were bringing their girls, and Draco apparently counted amongst them too. It should have stung, but instead he felt rather special.
She smiled a real smile and nodded, and then said, “Draco really likes you, you know.”
“finally, as I am head and thus may change whatever I please, I have decided to reduce the prevalence the housing system here at Hogwarts. Students will dine with those in their year, and all class projects will be done with inter-house partnering’s. Finally, as Eighth years, you will be roomed in pairs that cross the houses, and house unity is just as much a goal as achieving your NEWTs.” She smiled now, saying “we have borrowed much from the muggle education system, to ensure that we never see them as ‘lesser’ ever again. As the equivalent of sixth formers, you will be allowed to wear professional and appropriate muggle clothing if you wish. Finally, some of your chosen subjects will also offer the novel adventure of ‘school trips’, which we hope will bring exciting variety to your studies.” Turning, she then ushered everyone in to acquaint themselves with their new home.
“Y’alreet?” The man asked, nodding at Draco, before wrapping an arm around Sirius and then Remus in a half-hug.
Face still wet with tears, Draco fell into a fitful sleep to the sound of Harry’s voice.
“I'm sorry. I can’t talk about it. I can’t bring myself to. I wanted you to know, though, and Ron is the only person who knows everything”
“always”
Almost an hour after they had finished breakfast, and they were just leisurely chatting, Draco stumbled in looking very much worse for wear. He collapsed into a chair and Harry wordlessly levitated the breakfast he had saved under a stasis charm over to him.
On the weekend between the two weeks of holiday, his parents threw a soiree, as was their wont to do whenever Draco was home from school. He was paraded around their friends as his parents sung his praises, and everyone drank too much and ate too much and wore clothes that cost as much as some people’s rent.
work song and cherry wine, both by Hozier
“There’s nowt up there for you” came a deep voice from behind him. Draco turned, bewildered because if he wasn’t in the house where was he to sleep? His confusion must have shown on his face because Harry let out a huff of laughter and opened the front door.
“I've offered Sirius one of the boys’ rooms, now they're all at uni. Would you both like to stay here?”
The rugby team bounded in, boisterous and indecorously professing their love to the dinner ladies in order to get seconds- it always worked- and then obnoxiously scraping their chairs back and clanking cutlery and the noisy smacking sound that those who were never forced to take etiquette lessons in their youth make when they eat.
He and Ron returned to their room to change, then headed back out to a more modern building next to the science block that housed Dean and Seamus and a handful of the other rugby boys.
“I haven’t got a girlfriend, Malfoy. What are you on about?” asked harry as he leant over to sweep Draco’s fringe out of his face. When this bout was over Draco turned to Harry, brow furrowed and looking confused. “your girlfriend? The girl who looked like Hermione that you were all over earlier.”
Like a cry at the final breath that is drawn
As he was stripping off his t-shirt he heard voices and smirked. He felt bad for overhearing, but he argued that given it was likely about him it was fair.
Maybe they were different this year. Draco didn’t want to let himself hope, but…
“I don't like strangers,” Harry said plainly, eyeing Draco. “And you’re one of t’strangest of t’lot. Sirius and Remus are the only family I have, and the same goes for them. To have you waltz in ‘ere as if you had some sort o’... deeper connection to Sirius and I just didn’t like you. Didn’t like it. Didn’t like the thought of some posh twat waltzing in and fucking everything up.” here Harry let out a humourless laugh and kept going.
The words made a heat start to pool in Draco’s stomach, which only intensified when Harry turned around. His green eyes were stunning without glasses, so much brighter with the (oh my god is that eyeliner) black lining his eyes. His lips were pink and glossed, and his hair glowed with small glints of gold flashing here and there. Draco was speechless, even more so when Dean came barging in, shirt unbuttoned and trousers sinfully tight, and shouted to Harry, “it’s time for the last song my man!”
“hey, Draco hey” said Harry gently, tightly wrapping an arm around Draco’s shoulders and pressing a kiss to the top of his head.
“Did you make it, mate?” Ron asked, eyes wide.
“yea, that would be really nice” smiled harry, before turning back to Narcissa.
“I can also appreciate it’s hard to spend your birthday with people you barely know” Harry replied, and Draco thought he maybe looked a bit guilty, as if it was his fault, though Draco supposed it kind of was. Harry definitely could have made more of an effort to include Draco in his little group.
Back in their dorm later that evening, listening to the soft sounds of some other song that Draco didn’t know, he finally worked up the courage to ask Harry what has been on his mind all day. “Potter, how did you learn how to sing, and what was the song you were singing to Lovegood earlier?” he silently commended himself for remembering not to use the name ‘Looney’ and stared at the wall just beside Harry’s head, not prepared for the effects of the saviour’s eye contact. Harry laughed, deep and warm. “I never learnt how to sing Malfoy, I just sang, a lot, and eventually I got way better. Ask Ron- I sounded like a strangled cat when I first started. The song from earlier is called work song by an Irish muggle singer called Hozier. Luna introduced me to him, and I love his music, it’s really poetic and Hozier perfectly describes the kind of love I want to find one day.”
“I have to say, I agree. Save me a dance tonight, will you?” drawled Blaise, wandering in. he was in similar attire to Harry except it was all black. Against his rich dark skin, darker than Harrys, he looked like an angel of death, entirely beautiful but sombre too.
“of course they can, I’ll dress the bed for them in a minute. Ron and ‘mione are coming for dinner tonight too.” Harry says, bringing Draco his coffee and sitting next to him at the kitchen table, whilst teddy plays with his dragon toy in his highchair.
“Harry, its nothing awful. Tonks accidentally almost cut her thumb off making teddy’s lunch, so Remus is taking her to A&E. I'm going over to watch Teddy because it’ll likely take them hours. I was just wondering if you could maybe stay the night at your mate’s house? There's no easy way from where you are to Remus's house so it would just be easier for you to stay there until tomorrow, that okay?”
“Now, onto more exciting matters. I hear someone’s turning nineteen very soon.” Sirius said, eyes glinting.
songs
Sirius seemed to find it the same, it seemed. Though weighed down by the pain of the past, Sirius seemed to get more and more animated during conversations about their family, and he mentioned more than once how nice it was to have a family member who didn’t hate him.
Draco just nodded, unable to talk in his haste to get his laptop and climb onto the bed, desperate for proximity with Harry. Much to his delight, Harry automatically wrapped an arm around Draco’s shoulders, and Draco settled into his side as they started the film. He knew he was being a bit pathetic, but he was enjoying himself too much to care.
“ils t’ont aimé, ils t’aime encore. Tu n’es pas seule. Même sans parents, je t’aime” (they loved you, they love you still. You’re not alone. Even without parents I love you)
“Remus is on his way with Teddy”
“It’s fine Harry, you never notice” I say, trying to comfort him, reaching out and taking his hands in mine. Of course, as I am wont to do, I said exactly the wrong thing and I watch as his whole body stiffens and he nearly rips his hands from my grip.
“don’t make it gross Pansy” groaned Draco
(6:30 am)
This is, perhaps the most important piece of information about the school. Not to Draco, though. Draco didn’t play rugby. He had neither the body type nor what he liked to consider as an innate disposition for violence that was necessary for Rugby.
Luna laughed, the sound light and effervescent. “Anything for you, my darling” she replied, shifting a bit but staying on his lap. He lay his head on her shoulder, looking out at the school grounds for a few minutes before he nudged her.
Neither Harry nor Ron were at dinner, which was totally within school rules- curfew was ten on weekdays and 11 on weekends for sixth formers, but still, Draco felt their absence. Oh alright, just Harry’s absence, but where Harry went, Ron went.
I hear the door open and close, and then I hear a tentative knock on my own, followed by a “Draco, can I come in?”
“hardly likely, Malfoy’s don’t feel such trivial emotions.” Harry huffed a laugh, and Draco was so happy he was back.
She climbed onto the bed next to him, putting the tray on his bedside and nestling into his pillows, before passing him a mug and taking one for herself.
“I thought that went unsaid, mate. I don’t talk to anyone else in our class. Only you, blondie” Harry said. He knew the second sentence was laying it on a bit thick, but he had realised these past weeks that he really genuinely liked Draco, and given that Drao had never really done anything before, Harry was enjoying the modern-style ‘courting’ he was currently doing.
For the umpteenth time that day, Draco had made a fool of himself in front of Potter, and Potter had responded nicely. Potter had never been
That easy camaraderie, like you could tell each other everything, and know you wouldn’t get judged for it. His friends were wonderful, they just weren’t close like that. They weren’t touchy-feely either. Ron always had an arm over Harry’s shoulders, or they were fake wrestling, or shoving each other or tackling each other. It wasn’t gentle touching- not like hugging and linking arms or the like that Draco did with Pansy, the one female friend he had outside of school, but it was more than Draco had with Theo or Blaise.
“Well, it was a very convincing performance. Also, Harry, you might want to make it clear to that blond boy- Drake? - that you and Luna aren’t an item. He looked quite upset to see you necking in a hallway” Hermione said, still tucked into Ron’s side.
Your so self-satisfied I don’t need you
“Ah. ‘Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds’, right”
At the end of the sixth year, Harry took some galleons from the never-diminishing pile in his vault, and after begging Arthur Weasley to exchange it for muggle money at the ministry, bought himself a small iPod and headphones. It was the first self-indulgent gift he had ever given himself, and he kept it on his person always. Sitting under the covers in Dudley’s old room in the early hours of the morning; calming himself down after watching the death of his mentor at the hands of his tormentor, keeping himself sane in the tent with Hermione. The music saved Harry from completely and utterly falling apart.
That left him and Malfoy. Malfoy was still staring intently into the fire, but his eyes were glazed over, belaying his intoxicated state. Harry lay back on the grass, and grabbed Malfoy’s elbow, pulling the blond back with him. Malfoy offered no resistance, and they both lay there looking up at the stars. Harry turned his head, admiring Malfoy’s glowing profile.
He went back to the kitchen to join his Gryffindor’s.
“God, where do I start?” Hermione laughed a little. “We’ve known each other since age eleven. Harry, Ron and I all went to school together in a slightly bigger village about a forty-five minute drive away. Harry and Ron had been friends forever and Harry and I gravitated towards each other as we were the only people of colour in our year. I think at first, Ron resented me for what he perceived to be me taking Harry away from him, because of course we had something in common he had no access to.”
“I’d hoped I’d like you” Sirius said, face shining with mirth as he walked into the kitchen, Draco on his heels.
“S’alright” Harry said, steadying Draco with a broad hand to the shoulder. The warmth of Harry’s hand soaked through to Draco’s skin and he nearly melted. God, his school-boy crush was really getting pathetic.

“Talk to me, Draco.”
“i have to meet him properly now” Sirius said, smiling softly at Harry.
Not knowing what to do with himself, Draco walked back to the cottage, where he dramatically flopped down onto the bed and hoped and prayed that today had marked the beginning of some sort of… something between him and Harry. Something that was a bit warmer than the cool indifference of before.
And anyway, he had Pansy. What more could he want? Especially with her and Hermione getting on so well, and him fitting so seamlessly into that. It was nice. Really, really nice.
“Come here my sweet” she said, and he shuffled over and lay his head on her shoulder.
“I never- I never notice?” He says, wringing his hands together and starting to pace. “Am I the worst boyfriend ever? Do you think I encourage it because Draco please, please believe me I would never, ever do that” he says, stopping pacing and dropping to his knees in front of me, wrapping his hands around my calves and looking up at me with a forlorn, pleading expression.
There was an immense change in Potter after that. He was more considerate, and made more of an effort with everyone, even me. We struck up a friendship of some sorts, mainly because I was the only one he could rely on to tell him when he was slipping back into old habits. Now, we are in our second year of ‘university’ as he calls it. We are each doing our masteries. I am studying to become a Healer, and Potter is training to teach, which is a new course brought in after the continued failure of Hogwarts to hire competent DADA professors. The school is a wizarding district in and of itself, by the Southbank, and I love it here.
I will not ask you where you came from
‘Scaramouche, Scaramouche will you do the fandango?
“Draco” cried Luna, voice stronger and surer than he had ever heard, “I need you to escort Hermione to the hospital wing; Ron and Harry have been hurt.” Without looking at him, Hermione grabbed his hand, squeezing tight, and began to race towards the domain of Madame Pomfrey.
He also realised how much he enjoys Draco’s company, too. When the blond had shyly admitted that he hadn’t don’t anything, all Harry could think was ‘I want to be your first kiss. I would make it so good for you’
We should just kiss like real people do.
Draco nodded, jaw tight and gripped Harry’s hand back. In unison, they dipped their heads into the cracked bowl of the pensive.
He heaved himself off of his step and went to the farmhouse in search of Sirius, who seemed to spend a lot of time indoors. The door opened with just a twist of the handle. It made sense, but still shocked Draco somewhat, as he was used to London, where thievery was rife and you had to lock your door just to step out and chat to a neighbour.
“Shit, shit I’m so sorry, I’m sorry, sorry” Draco babbled, stumbling back and smoothing down his t-shirt.
Blaise said it was a surprise, and no doubt he would turn up looking deathly attractive with the most gorgeous girl on his arm.
“The build-up is the most important it, Ron. Anyway, I've decided I'm going to do it at some point over the holidays. But I wanna enjoy courting him first” Harry said, laughing and settling in to fix up his suitcase so it’ll close properly.
Sirius parked down one of these residential streets, and indicated for Draco to get out of the car.
And as childish as he knew it was, he resented the fact that Harry had carried Theo- that they had gone on some sort of mad adventure together, and would now have some obnoxious inside joke about it.
“don’t leave” he heard the slurred mumbled words and rolled his eyes. He stripped, and accio’d his pyjamas before changing and slipping into bed next to Draco. With a wave of his hand he turned the lights off and settled down to sleep. He heard rustling, and soon a head was on his chest, and a leg was thrown over both of his. He deeply regretted not putting more clothes on Draco, but imagined he would have found it a near impossible task. When he heard Draco’s breathing deepen and even out, he slipped out and went downstairs. He sat at the table, ate brownies and pondered the situation as he waited for the others to get back.
“I swear they’re going to get married” said a deep voice from his shoulder. Draco turned abruptly, and found himself staring into the triumphant, smirking face of Harry. Draco felt himself blush and hoped the low lights of the room covered it.
It’s good though. An ex-death eater being in the bosom of the most decorated war heroes keeps me safe, even if it is leeching at my sanity, and Potter and I make an unusually good pair. At least, it was good, for a good year and a half. Fantastic, really, until last week.
There will come a ruler, whose brow is laid in thorn
“he said he would help with the alcohol and lights and stuff. This is going to be great ‘mione. I’m going to have it on New Year’s Eve and invite the whole year before we go back to school.” As much as Hermione knew this would end terribly, she couldn’t deny Harry things like this. She was too happy that he felt capable of doing such a thing, and didn’t want to seal himself off from all humanity. Hermione nodded at him, and his face split into an easy grin. His smile turned impish and he bent down to whisper to her “I know you, ‘mione, and if you won’t party at Hogwarts you better party at home. Invite your cousins.”
“Who’s coming tonight?” Draco asked, desperate to be talking to Harry.
“clubbing with Dean and Seamus mostly, gay muggle clubs have the best music, and no one recognises me” he replied. Draco coughed again.
“I understand, Harry it's okay” Draco said into his chest, overwhelmed with relief that Harry still wanted him.
And yeah, I might be an ex-death eater whose father may or may not have failed trying to escape Azkaban and re-embarrassed our family all over again, and yeah, maybe I am technically unemployed- Harry calls me a gentleman of leisure. Blaise calls me a househusband even though we’re not even engaged yet- but even if I was Satan himself, surely it’s common decency to respect when two people are in an exclusive relationship, instead of people constantly trying to ask Harry on dates in front of me.
“film?” he asked Harry, because it felt like safe ground.
Harry knew exactly what Blaise would say to that. He was right.
Once McGonagall stopped talking, Ron and Harry looked right at Hermione, who rolled her eyes but nodded, knowing she would spend the best part of her night in the Gryffindor boy’s room transfiguring all their clothes and essentially doing their packing for them.
“are you- I mean, are you gay, Malfoy?” Harry finally asked, biting his lip and looking a bit embarrassed of the question.  Draco was too shocked to spit out a typical Malfoy brand scathing response (‘what? Scared I’ll bum the saviour?’ later came to mind). Stupidly, all he could think of in the moment was a very inarticulate “uh,, why?” (there goes ‘living proudly’ you coward, he scoffed inwardly)
“Shit. It isn’t Hermione, is it?” Draco asked, scandalised at the love triangle emerging in his mind.
“he needs time to process it but also, I think he’s staying away from you because he’s waiting for you to change your mind. He doesn’t want you to comfort him now only for you to turn around tomorrow and leap into Blaise’s arms.” She says, picking at a loose piece of thread on her trousers.
“Ah. Well our Ginny’s nearly as tall as Harry now, and skinny as you, so it’s no wonder they fit. They’ll do you all right while you’re ‘ere, I suppose. Keep them ones on and I’ll bag up the rest for ya.”
“No, don’t do that” she said, holding his face up by the chin.
“S’not between us. It’s one sided. Jus’ me being an arse” Harry said, still mumbling. Draco just hummed noncommittally.
The two of them spent a pleasant day around the village after their tea, which was delicious. Draco was glad he couldn't drive otherwise he would be at that tea shop every single day of the summer.
“Ron, ‘Mione and I are going to this open air cinema thing in the village in a few days if you want t’come?” Harry asked, casting his eyes back to the sky.
Slightly shell-shocked, Draco nodded, picked up a shower caddy and his towels, and mindlessly followed them downstairs.
“God don’t I know it. I’m just hoping not yellow. I don’t want to look like a male Cher”
“can I stay here, for a few days?”
He thought of the dress he had chosen her. It was a tight teal bodice with floating tulle skirts of lilac. It was whimsical enough to be totally ‘Luna’ and fancy enough not to look out of place in the great hall of Hogwarts.
“Reet. Try these” Ron said from where he was bent over the chest of drawers, opening them up and chucking trousers out. “I’m sure Harry can stretch to tops for you but just in case I’ll lend you some of Gin’s.”
When he awoke, sharp pain spearing through his head, he saw Hermione and Luna curled up on Harry’s bed, and he felt that familiar ache as the realisation dawned that he was safe enough to be present as the two women sought comfort in each other. All pain was forgotten as he gazed at the image before him, once again hit with the knowledge that this was what friendship felt like, and it felt so good he could hardly resent the fact that he had waited 18 years to find it.
She was right- Draco had insisted he wear a pair of ‘going out’ jeans. These were black, and Draco had dug out a very expensive, tight mustard-yellow t-shirt that he had been gifted by Ginny after she received her first quidditch players paycheck. The colour matched his dark skin wonderfully.
Once the chill had started to seep through Harry’s large hoodie, he scooped Teddy out of the swing, strapped him to his chest and headed home again, hoping that Teddy would go down for his morning nap easily and Harry would be able to snatch some precious extra minutes in bed with Draco. He hums on his way, one hand wrapped protectively around Teddy’s back. He often gets a lot of weird looks as a black man with a white baby, but the streets are still relatively empty at this time, and he isn’t sure anything could dampen his mood today. He arrives back at Grimmauld in high spirits, puts Teddy down with little fuss, and makes another cup of tea before drifting back upstairs and slipping into bed. Like a magnet, Draco immediately rolls over and tucks himself into Harry’s side, one arm and leg flung over Harry’s body. Harry kisses Draco on the top of his head- his hair smells of jasmine and sleep and Harry smiles.
Remus then led him out to the land rover where Harry and Hermione, who must have stayed the night, were standing waiting. Sirius was nowhere in sight, and Draco suspected that the day yesterday had affected whatever medical affliction he had too much for him to be able to come out today.
Just as the panic threatened to overwhelm, he heard a deep voice behind him say “er, Malfoy, do you need any help with that?” Draco stiffened, embarrassed at being so obvious in his struggle, and turned around to face Potter. He didn’t know what to say. he couldn’t lie, but dear merlin he couldn’t possibly ask for help. He looked at Potter. Despite Potter’s usual insistence to wear clothes at least two sizes too big at all times he was in form fitting running shorts that showed off impossibly muscular thighs. And not impossibly in the hyperbolic describing-attraction way, but truly impossible. Potter may have been a good quidditch player, but he had never trained on a professional level and school players did not train in a way that allowed for that kind of muscle.
Fuck. Harry doesn’t know how he ever liked a boy like Cedric. Or rather he does- Cedric still remains one of the fittest boys Harry had lain eyes on. His personality was just ugly, Harry knew that now.
Eventually, his mum calls them for dinner and Draco feels as if he could talk to Harry forever. Dinner was agone though, as his mum kept making not-so-subtle references to Draco’s schoolboy crush on Harry, all of which made Harry laugh and then wink at Draco as if he knew. Then again, Draco wasn’t so sure he had done such a great job of hiding his infatuation.
Harry had worried that him coming out as bisexual would change things, but there was month after year eleven where Harry stayed with Ron and his family as the custody proceedings were settled, and Harry didn’t belong to the Dursley’s but didn’t quite belong to Sirius either, and so he stayed with the Weasley’s in the interim. Harry was overwhelmed by dreams that told him that Sirius’ acquittal hadn’t happened, and he wasn’t actually free and safe, but he was still stuck with the Dursley’s, and he woke up soaked in sweat and tears and shaking uncontrollably, like a lamb in a storm. One night, Ron woke up for some water and saw Harry sat up in bed, crying with whole body sobs violent enough to shake the bed beneath him, and Ron had just lifted the corner of the duvet, and when Harry choked out “I thought you wouldn’t want to” Ron had just scoffed and said “don’t be an idiot, Harry. We’re brothers, remember?”
“Harry” Draco replied, nodding. His brain was too busy analysing the previous conversation to produce anything more conversationally sophisticated.
“Alright mam?” Ron yelled as he herded Draco in the door. A large woman in an eccentric floral dress came out of the kitchen to greet them.
Harry was pulling on a t-shirt, and Draco watched the rich brown planes of his stomach disappear under the soft white cotton.
“no one has forgotten the past, Draco, but they have forgiven it; there’s a difference.”
“just because, I’m like, bi I guess, and I kinda hoped that the painted nails and gay books meant more than just superficial interest? I just, I don’t know” Harry stumbled over his words, unsure of how to express how much he wanted a friend like him in that innate way to his historic rival of seven years. It felt too,,, personal, and raw.
Now Draco, he was exactly what you would expect. Signet-ring-wearing, uses-cad-instead-of-bastard, wears-merino-wool-for-Monday-night-dinner type boy. His family had to have at least three houses.
“right. I’m going to go to bed” he said, yawning and standing up. its darker than he thought it was when he turns to walk back to the tent, and so much colder without the flame. Harry was warm and toasty in his sleeping bag, just on the brink of sleep when Malfoy stumbled into the tent, swearing as he fell over his bag that he hadn’t seen in the dark. Soon enough, Malfoy found his way into his sleeping bag, and blissful silence and the sound of soft breathing descended on the tent again. Harry was once again brought from the brink of sleep when Malfoy started shaking. The slender boy was clearly freezing.
Some of their ideas weren’t so bad. The eighth-year quidditch team brought a nice reprieve from endless revision and being unable to leave Pansy and Blaise alone together, and watching Potter, and agonising over how hot Potter is, and avoiding every other living being in the castle.
“I mean, I guess, yeah. I mean more someone to put up with me complain about my father even though he’s allowed me to live in the lap of luxury. Someone to put up with me changing my outfit three times before I leave the house. That sort of stuff. I suppose Pansy does that, but you know, she’s a girl” Draco said, pulling a face at the last bit.
“it’s not awkward Malfoy. Do you,, do you like me?” Harry asked, thumb rubbing soothing circles on Draco’s hand.
He slid into the chair opposite Harry.
The rest of Draco’s day went as expected. He had English after French. He hadn’t thought that enough boys would have signed up to do English to warrant two English classes, but he knew Theo was doing English, and Theo wasn’t on the register for his English lesson, so there must be another class.
“of course, boys, next long weekend I expect you all to return with bottles of the good stuff, yes?”
“Forgive me if I overstep, but do you perhaps think that’s why you’ve not had any relationships. Not because its bad, of course, but because it was holding you back from letting someone in in that way?”
“something slow-ish, please” said Pansy, and Harry complied, soon the sounds of ‘redbone’ by Childish Gambino filled the room. Blaise gave a nod of approval to Harry, and started to nod his head to the beat. Harry guessed this was as close to kindness as he would get from Blaise, and smiled, sipping leisurely from his tumbler. He was careful not to drink too much in case there was a middle-of-the-night Teddy emergency, but he allowed himself just enough to dull the senses.
“not allowed?” Pansy said, and Harry realised maybe Draco hadn’t explained the abuse. He scratched the back of his neck and smiled sheepishly. “yeah, my relatives where somewhat abusive when I grew up. I was usually locked in the cupboard when they watched films” he said.
“oh, sure. Let me just call Sirius and let him know”
“Did you do this?” he asked.
“no saucy business then?” said Pansy, winking.
“No, no not at all. I’d ask you to offer Harry here some girl advice about Gin, but I doubt you’d know anything about that” Sirius teased, gesturing for Draco to come in. Draco sat on one of the armchairs and took it as a win when Harry, who was draped across one of the sofas, didn’t immediately leave.
Finally, they were all settled at the table with their dinner in front of them. Harry placed a hand on Draco’s thigh as they ate, and delighted in the faint blush that dusted Draco’s cheeks for the rest of the meal. Once done, Pansy and Blaise offered to clean up, and so the rest made their way into the living room. Harry sat and pulled Draco on top of him by the hips. Draco yelped, falling on Harry in an ungainly heap and Harry wrapped his arms around Draco, propping his chin on Draco’s shoulder and revelling in the easiness of the touch. Soon, Pansy and Blaise came back in, a bottle of firewhiskey in tow, and the six of them drank long into the night. It ended, as it had many nights before, with Hermione lugging Ron through the floo, and Harry carrying Draco upstairs, Blaise doing the same for Pansy, even though he seemed just as drunk.
Draco grabbed his hand back. “god no Harry not like that” he sputtered, looking Harry in the eye in earnest. “not because you’re the bloody saviour boy-who-lived-forever golden prat. Because you’re you. You’re the Harry that sings when he’s happy and is always hugging his friends and is always there when you’re drunk and throwing up and you still play quidditch even though it’s almost killed you more times than I can count. You’re the Harry that was kind to me even though you had every reason to punch me every time you see me because of everything I’ve done to you. You’re Harry who doesn’t speak when he comforts you because he knows words don’t make a difference but being held does.” Babbled Draco, wishing he hadn’t fucked it up before it had begun. Harry relaxed, laughing at Draco’s hungover rambling.
Given that Harry cared far more about being comfortable than he did about adhering to fashion trends, he almost exclusively wore running shorts and trackies and hoodies and the like, so he was all set. The others were a different story all together. It had been a long night of Hermione shouting and the Gryffindor boys being generally useless. Harry had never been so grateful to see her leave a room.
“it’s not the same Molly. He’s the closest thing I have to blood family, and he isn’t even related to me” Harry said into her shoulder. “I am so alone without him” Harry choked out.
“She’s just upstairs” the woman said to Sirius, with a strong Caribbean accent. She then turned to face into the house and hollered “Sirius is here sweetie” up the stairs. At the noise, a black man who Draco assumed to be her husband wandered out of another door and greeted Sirius with enthusiasm. Then, Draco saw a girl who must be their daughter descend the stairs. She was in knee-length shorts and a cropped polo shirt with converse. Her hair was in box braids and hung to her waist, tied back into a low ponytail.
Draco awoke with a headache pulsing behind his eyes, and groaned. He felt colder than he had the night before and he realises with a sting of disappointment that Potter had turned over during the night, and the two now lay back-to-back. Draco feels his stomach clench with the slew of negative emotions that assault him simultaneously. Of course, of course, Potter had been drunk and the kiss that had meant everything to Draco had meant nothing to perfect Potter who could get anyone he wanted.
He wanted to say something, but he felt a bit sick and his head felt heavy and his tongue wasn’t co-operating. He tried to sit up, and collapsed right back into Harry’s side.
Someone- he missed who but he was fairly sure they were ginger- kept refilling his mug, and before he knew it he was well on the way to being drunk. The air was getting chillier, reminding Draco that for all the heat of the day, it was May and not July, and that he should have had the foresight to bring out a jumper.
“Sirius, what’s wrong?” Harry asked cautiously.
“We came to check on our visitor. From the sound of it, he’s not doing too well.” Harry said, and now Draco was even more confused.
Harry was stunned by Draco’s apology, and shocked further at the sympathy it drew from him, as he pitied the child Draco had been, choiceless and used as a pawn, much as Harry himself had been. As Draco left though, Harry felt the increasingly familiar warmth of happiness emanate outwards from his chest at the prospect of peace with Draco, and on his final ever first night at Hogwarts, Harry wanted to dance. Something cheesy, something disco, something fun.
These words hurt Draco, reminding him of the bottle tucked under his bed, the bottle that was both his weakness and his salvation. He saw Hermione grip Harry’s hand in apology and understanding, before Harry waved his free hand and the lights cut out instantaneously.
Harry was shocked that McGonagall had said that speech without seeming to breathe, but he guessed (correctly) that she wanted to say her piece before he could resist or interject. Harry sighed, and nodded. He was too grateful for all that she had done, and all she continued to do, to deny her this. He was also hopeful for a year free from fighting, and anger, and division. Whilst friendship may have seemed like a stretch, Harry wanted peace, and he had a feeling, from seeing the pristine black of Malfoy’s nails, and the lack of robes in the Great Hall, that he and Malfoy could find common ground in an assumed shared queerness, if nothing else. Harry was desperate for a friendship like that; he had Hermione to share his racial with, and Ron was family to him, but in his sexuality, he felt quite alone, especially seeing how easy Ron and Hermione could love each other, no one could object to it, say it was ‘wrong’ or ‘unnatural’, the words of his uncle Vernon coming back all too quickly.
“Maybe I didn’t fail him, then” Sirius whispered. Draco took a deep breath to say something, anything, but then Remus walked in. He could obviously feel the tension in the air but before he could say anything Sirius turned around and grabbed his hand with a watery laugh.
“think about it. You look like you’ve had a hard day- if you’re not too angry, I’ll get takeaway and we can eat it on the sofa like normal, and if you don’t want to be with me I’ll bring it to you when it gets here. I might not understand why, but I’m still sorry I upset you Draco.” He says, patting my shoulder and leaving just like I did to him almost two years ago now.
Of course, they took it upon themselves to be the paragons of virtue, all forgiving and holding hands and kumbaya my lord.
Clothe yourself with beauty untold, and see life as a means to a triumph
“he’s, uh, actually here to offer emotional support, whilst I tell you something.”
“Alright there, gin?” Harry said, nodding at her as he passed and opened the neighbouring barn to let the cows out.
Harry coughed, and looked up at Malfoy, startled by the intensity of the grey eyes he found on himself.
Still drunk and not entirely aware of what he was doing, Harry pulled his shoes and jeans off and clambered into the blond’s bed, wrapping Draco’s body in his strong arms and stroking the boy’s hair. When the screaming subsided and only tears and whimpers remained, Harry played the first slow-ish song his drink-soaked brain could think of, the sounds wrapping around the kneeling Harry and the boy in his arms
“that’s rich coming from you Malfoy. By your own admission, you’re still a virgin. How can you care who I fuck when you can't get any?” Potter is smirking now, and again I am reminded of my own powerlessness. I used to be the Ice Prince of Slytherin; he is now the Fire King of the whole world. I am nothing before him.
I fumble opening the box and once I’ve finally lifted the lid I gasp. It’s a crest, with four quadrants. I can tell which are mine and which are his. Mine contain a small coiled dragon and a narcissus flower, and his contain a lily and then a jumble of letters. I trace them with my little finger. The ring is tiny, but the attention to detail is mesmerising.
Draco hesitantly dropped into the seat next to Blaise, tucking into his shepherd’s pie with fervour. He had never seen Theo converse in such a friendly manner with anyone who didn’t come from landed gentry.
Here she gave a wry smile, looking rather obviously at the group of Gryffindor boys sat around a chess table.
“Can you just stay in here, while I tell her? I’ll go now. I don’t know how long I’ll be. I can give you the Wi-Fi?”
After refreshing his silencing charm, Harry threw his arms up in the air, closed his eyes and in his mind’s eye he was back in a gay club in a backstreet of Barcelona, being spun and romanced by any tall dark and handsome stranger that was closest. His hips swung with the music, head thrown back as the deep, grating voice surrounded him.
There’s ‘bien que’ for although, and then many others that express abstract things, like wishes. So, for that you would use ‘je souhaite que…’ like, ‘je souhaite que je fasse plus de sport’ right? You can use that for an example on question two…”
“Why does he always have to be like this?” Hermione asked, angrily. Draco lifted an arm and she immediately tucked herself into his side, clutching her mug in both hands. “Whenever he’s in a good mood he’s all about letting Ron and I figure it out for ourselves, but the minute he’s backed into a corner he gets defensive and weaponises it against us.”
“it's not for want of offers” I shoot back, smirking. “I just have...” here I pause, and sweep my eyes up and down his figure, “...standards” I finish, turning back to my drink. I revel in the feeling of having won this exchange, this verbal sparring match, and I have won, until Pansy, more drunk than I gave her credit for, snorted beside me and said “yeah, because you’ve only wanted to fuck Potter since we were eleven.”
Draco’s heart flipped at this. He was torn between joy at Harry’s declaration and invitation, and fear at the prospect of a party full of Gryffindors.
“His names Theo” he said faintly, before the vomiting in the bathroom started anew.
The golden Trio turned to each other and those around them, Hermione looking sick at the sentiment that Hogwarts was not the epitome of thorough education. McGonagall continued; “we fought and won a war against bigotry, and division, and the prejudice-fuelled extermination of those considered ‘lesser’. The muggles did so too, centuries and decades ago, and now they educate their children about these hatreds, their source, their insidious nature, and how to stop falling into the trap of perceived supremacy of one group over another. Muggle history is fraught with division and prejudice, so we have decided to take a leaf out of their book, and teach you more. To ward against blood purist beliefs, we have added a new compulsory class to all years, wizarding politics. This class will teach about the war and the beliefs that fuelled it. Furthermore, all years will be able to take one of several muggle subjects, taught by parents of muggle-born wizards. There will be a list of these for you to choose from later”- at this, Hermione looked ready to combust.
Draco had no idea who James was, but he saw a look of pain pass across the faces of Remus, Sirius and Harry. Sirius went pale, and Remus grabbed his hand that was holding a spoon. Harry dropped the piece of paratha that was loaded with dahl that was halfway to his mouth, his lips tightening and drawing down in what looked like misery.
Seamus and Dean launched themselves at him, yelling “HARRYYYYYY” and he stumbled under their combined weight. He winked at Blaise, who was supporting a stumbling Parkinson and they all made their way up the stairs. The three Gryffindors collapsed into bed, much like the time before, and harry was asleep in no time surrounded by body heat.
Draco came down, and the five of them drank and talked and laughed whilst they were waiting for Pansy. Harry noticed that Blaise was sitting a bit too close for comfort, but thought nothing of it. Eventually, Pansy descended the stairs looking resplendent in a skin-tight blood-red leather miniskirt and black bra. As before, she was also in a thoroughly scary pair of stilettos, and they clacked down the stairs as she made her entrance.
“wait until you try his cake, its orgasmic” mumbled Draco. “Draco darling, you do realise Potty dearest is back with us now” said Pansy with faux sweetness.
And then he had seen him again laughing up a storm with Ron, Dean and Seamus, and then again talking earnestly with Hermione on a sofa, where they were facing each other, knees knocking together.
“No offence, but thank fuck for that” Harry groaned.
“I’ll leave you boys here. Draco, I’ll take you down by the cows as there’s a fence that needs mending”  and then Draco was off walking again, barely getting fifteen minutes respite before he was forced to exercise. He was eternally grateful that he bought the walking boots on his mother’s advice.
“Oh yea, we wanted to get ready together. Actually Draco, could you take some photos of us, Ron isn’t wearing that shirt to the actual ball.” Harry asked.
True to Sirius’ word, Hermione showed up that afternoon, in running shorts and a cropped polo-top and she and Draco holed themselves up in the office in the farmhouse, and Hermione took Draco step-by-step through the UCAS process, which was much more arduous than he expected.
“S’not far now, and s’really not that bad once you’re used to it” Ron said, before his long, muscular legs started striding across the fields again.
