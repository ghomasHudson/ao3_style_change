“Yes.” she said. More people began to trickle in, and she stood. “I have a seating chart everyone. On the far wall.” Harry walked over there and after a moment of searching, saw his name at a desk. Next to Malfoy’s name. Why was he not surprised?
“Oh, of course. Is that why you’re still failing Potions? Because you need me as a teacher?” teased Draco, laughing, and Harry flushed. True, he was still not doing that well in Potions, even though he’d been under the instruction of four different teachers.
“He’s always been like this,” he commented, jerking his head at Malfoy, who’s gesturing wildly with his hands while he talks. “Too smart for the rest of us to keep up.” Harry’s a
Draco smiled. That was good, she’d had company for Christmas. He was glad she and her sister were reconciled. He could probably sneak away on a weekend and visit her, McGonagall was pretty lax about the eighth years. Although he wasn’t just any eighth year, technically he was still on probation, but that didn’t mean much at the moment.
Harry had cajoled Draco into agreeing to let Harry braid his hair again. Harry mostly liked doing this because he could play with Draco’s hair, which was pretty (not that he’d ever say that to Draco’s face) and soft, and he always found himself running his fingers through the blond strands.
“You must be Mr. Potter.” Harry spun and saw a young, dark-haired black woman sitting at Snape’s old desk. She had a faint Aussie accent, and he vaguely remembered someone
“I’m Harry.” he said, and Draco wondered what it was like for him, to just be Harry and not Harry Potter, the Saviour of the Wizarding World. Draco smiled wryly to himself. Probably a similar feeling to just being Draco, instead of Draco Malfoy, the ex-Death Eater whose father was in Azkaban.
Harry shifted their positions, so they were sitting up and facing one another, Draco straddling Harry. Draco leaned forward and grabbed Harry’s tie, pulling him close again, his fingers threading through Harry’s hair as they kissed again. As it went on, became frenzied again, Harry began to take control, his tongue sweeping through Draco’s mouth in a way that left him breathless. A small, desperate sound came out of him, and Harry’s fingers tightened around Draco’s hips as Draco shivered and arched against him, his hands clutching at Harry’s back.
s) flat had to be Harry Potter. Draco didn't know what he was expecting when Luna told him that Potter would be coming over, but he certainly didn't expect the tall, dark, and handsome Potter that stood on their front step. Draco could see tattoos covering him where his skin wasn't clothed, he had finally grown into his body and was
The, his mother began to invite friends over to view his artwork, he had begun to progress from just pencil and charcoal sketches to painted pieces. When Pansy had heard they were having guests over to view Draco's work, she had barged in the following day.
"As enticing as that sounds, I stayed here with mother." Draco said, finally shrugging Pansy off of him.
"Oh, um..." Malfoy ducked his head a little and flipped over his arm, showing his Dark Mark covered in flowers, "I wanted to get it covered up..." He trailed off.
"Hey, Draco, you think you could design a tattoo for me?" Pansy piped up suddenly. Draco looked at her incredulously.
"Oh! Harry! Hello! Are you finished already? How did Draco do?" She smiled at him as she came to inspect his bandaging. Malfoy had turned around and started punching things in on their cash register.
"Well," Harry looked at his watch, "I really should get going. It was nice catching up with you Luna, we'll have to go for tea sometime. And thanks for the tattoo Malfoy, I'll keep your hand poked tattoos in mind." and with that Harry exited the shop, and walked down the street entirely satisfied with his new tattooist.
Malfoy snorted, and rolled his eyes, "I'll give you the short one, Pansy." He smirked. Harry thought for a minute, then nodded.
"Oh! Thank you Draco!" She smiled, then stood on her toes and gave him a kiss on the cheek, "I'll just grab my coat and we'll be on our way." She grabbed a coat from a giraffe-shaped coat stand in the corner of the room and held her arm out to Harry. Which he took and led her from the kitchen and out the flat.
"Yeah, yeah Malfoy. What was your first tattoo?" Harry sat up, trying to see the tattoos that were on Malfoy, it was difficult since he was wearing a long sleeved shirt and trousers, so all Harry could see was Malfoy's forearms where the sleeves had been rolled up.
Harry had gotten his first tattoo shortly after the trials, he wanted to do something to remember those that he had lost. His first tattoo was for his father, a pair of antlers on his shoulder blades. The next was for his mother, a large stargazer lily on his left bicep. Then a little badger on his right ankle for Cedric, a paw print over his heart for Sirius, the Elder Wand going from his wrist to his elbow on his right arm for Dumbledore, a pair of white wings in the center of his back for Hedwig, Mad-Eye's eye on the back of his neck, a clothesline of socks on his left calf for Dobby, the Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes logo on his left ankle for Fred, a slightly larger paw print with a crescent moon on the right side of his chest for Remus, an Auror badge for Tonks just above Remus' paw, a camera for Colin on his left wrist, and a small cauldron for Snape just above his left knee. His tattoos in memory of those he'd lost, and those that had died to protect him led to a greater obsession with tattoos, some other significant additions to his tattoos were footsteps from the Marauder's Map going from his collar bone, up the left side of his neck and behind his ear, a golden snitch on his right hip, and the Gryffindor crest on his right bicep.
Harry followed Malfoy as he walked back out to the lobby, Harry waited in front of the desk while Malfoy rummaged around behind, putting Harry's file away. His mind began to drift again when the bell over the door chimed and Luna bustled in.
"Oh, shove it Malfoy." Harry grumbled. Malfoy didn't respond, instead he pulled a file out of the cabinet and opened it on the desk, peering over it.
"No, Ginny knows. And Draco's my cousin, what does she have to be concerned about?" Luna looked up at him.
After a bit of touring around the manor, showcasing the new additions of artwork done by Draco, Narcissa excused herself saying: "I'll leave you kids to catch up!"
"It looks really good Malfoy." Harry said, Malfoy seemed to relax a little and he gave the tiniest smile to Harry. He then went about cleaning the area again and bandaging it.
"I can do that Luna, you and Potter should leave or else you'll be late to tea." Malfoy said, gingerly taking the pot from her hands.
"No! Wait, Potter! I'm just joking, lighten up. I'm fully capable of tattooing you. Now stop being a child and lets go talk about how you want it to look." Malfoy said, gesturing to one of the tattooing rooms with the file in his hand. Harry looked skeptical, but finally sighed and followed Malfoy into the room.
"Right this way dears." Narcissa said, and led the three through the house, she stopped here and there to point out different pieces. As they progressed through the house Pansy gripped Draco's arm tightly, and she kept smiling at him.
“About what?” he asked, slowly turning to him, trying to look collected, and failing. Harry gave him a gentle smile, putting a hand on his leg, trying to assure him it was ok.
“What moine, don’t kick me I said nothing wrong.” He hissed, looking at the direction Hermoine was nodding. “That’s bloody Malfoy and his gang. Last thing I heard he joined Goyle’s little death eater gang and disappeared of the face of the earth.”
“I agree. Now off you go before I change my mind on letting you come back here again.” Malfoy smiled. A genuine soft smile.
The first few days were hard. Malfoy felt himself lost after doing daily chores. He didn’t need it but at this point he was thinking about going back to working on the fishing boat and be so busy he wouldn’t have time to focus on the loneliness. But.. he decided against it. He had his son to look out for and send letters. Besides who’d care for the cabin. Who’d look after his chickens? Astoria? She hated them. She had a better life now.
“Fair enough, the Blacks house was part of my heritage at some point. They must’ve put something in that whiskey, I haven’t been this drunk since Hogwarts whiskey night in the dungeons.” He grumbled, letting the potion do its work. Wondering if it was even worth it with that after taste.
By the end of the night they were both quite drunk. Genuinely enjoying one another’s company as they were finding they had more in common than they had thought. Of course avoiding any sensitive topics like the war and a lot of their childhoods. Harry found himself feeling.. more at ease than he had expected. Malfoys refusal to call him anything but potter, his snide remarks and no more respect than he had had in the past was a nice change from most of his friends. Some of whom would treat him like he was broken, others like he was a big giant hero instead of a friend. Malfoy was a nice change of tune most definitely. Not that either was going to admit they had enjoyed it.
Draco took a shaky breath, he didn’t feel ready. But it was safe here. So he cast a silencing spell over the both of them. “Talk then Potter.” He crossed his arms, standing in front of him. Making himself look bigger than he felt.
He took her up, looking her over, hoping to find a blood feather, a feather that had broken off and was still bleeding, she seemed to have known what was going to happen and gnawed at one of her flying feathers, he plucked it out, thanking her softly as he healed the wound immediately. Letting blood from the feather dripped into a vail.
Scorp had a harder time saying goodbye. Nearly tearing up when Draco hugged him. “It’s going to be ok buddy. I love you. You know that right? You’ve got some great friends and I’ll see you during Christmas break.” Draco smiled softly, kissing his forehead. “Now chin up, I am so proud of you. Keep up the amazing work.” He said, letting him go. Scorpius nodded heavily, doing as told. Saying a quick “I’ll see you soon dad!” as Draco got into the train.
He sighed, putting off the blue sweater he had been wearing over the short sleeve white button up, revealing his bruising and hurt arms. Anything tight around them hurt too bad.
Draco smiled to himself. slowly drifting off into dreamland his thoughts continuing into a blabbering mess about a nice future finally.
“I know Potter. You’re duller than Longbottom. But.. Sincerely. I apologize for how I acted upon my disappointment.”
He smiled when the small barn owl landed on his shoulder. She knew she wasn’t allowed to do that. But she did it anyway. Cooing softly and patiently as Draco gathered up his stuff and got inside. Only opening the letter as he poured himself a cup of nice and hot coffee and seated himself in his favorite chair by the fire. Daisy by his side for pets and some support.
Hermione smiled softly, taking his hand. “He’s fine, they’re healing him, he went through a lot. How are you feeling?” she asked, looking over at pansy whom was still asleep. “Skadi got us, we found you in the field yesterday. Harry managed to tell us what happened before he went out again. I don’t know how you did it but you got him out of there.”
Somewhere along the lines as they got to the dinner itself (which was a lovely cooked chicken, stuffed with mozzarella, wrapped in parma ham with a side of homemade mash). The topic of doing stuff together came up.
Only when he was home he crashed again. Putting on ward after ward. No one should be able to come near his home now. He was afraid, fearing for his life. He erased every single trace of him traveling there and by the time it was night. He calmed down slightly. Taking a long shower to try and wash off the nasty feeling. The feeling that he was missing something. Something important. He blamed it on not having done enough spells… but he’d have to check tomorrow. Right now he needed to stop panicking and try to relax and rationalize and….
Harry would. Of course, never admit he nearly cried after reading the letter. He hated himself for messing up with Draco. He looked forward to getting to know him better. Talk more. And he wasted it all. Like a moron.
“So how did you two end up you know.. together. I know you were quite obsessive over Malfoy sixth year but this.. I don’t know if I’ll ever get used to this.”
“What did you say that ticked him off enough to make him go away. Isn’t potter more of the let them walk all over me type? Trust me I can take it if it was about me.” Draco said, staring at her.
Malfoy wasn’t sure what to believe really. Greg had been quite dull, he must be getting influenced by someone. Or it straight up not true. He didn’t care to find out for himself. he and pansy did have a falling out a long time ago… he should try to make up for that probably.
“Understood, I’ll be on my best behavior for the small Malfoy.” He hummed, getting up and out to leave to his own room. “Oh and Harry.. Thank you..” Malfoy gave him a soft smile before spelling the door close behind Harry.
“Did you just friendly nod at him.” Pansy shook her head. There was the drama queen Malfoy knew. “Leave it. It’s fine.” Malfoy said, glaring at her slightly. “We spoke the other day, Scorp befriended his son. I had to make sure he wasn’t going to break them up harshly. He’s got no class and Scorpius is sensitive.” He shrugged.
Blaise’s response had been much shorter, but just as meaningful. Leaving Draco with a sharp sting of guilt. Had he really abandoned his friends like that?
“Draco.. I thought you got kidnapped.. you were so close all of a sudden.” Harry said, he looked like he was feeling a lot better too.
Hermoine laughed as she took her shot. Harry flopped down next to Malfoy. “Don’t worry Malfoy, you look stunning. Truly.” Harry grinned, clearly full of himself.
Draco nudged him. “You’ve been doing just fine. Just toss in some Malfoy class when you want to rid of them.” he hummed, taking a sip of the drink he’d brought with him.
“You want me to stay with you? Pansy is occupied collecting her muggle boyfriend and Blaise is shagging half the castle. I’m a fan club deterrent as you can see.” He offered, getting a small hopefull smile from Harry back.
Like the 14 year old watching helplessly as Voldemort killed Cedric, the man that couldn’t properly love his kids because he felt he hadn’t deserved them.
He ran his fingers through Draco’s soft but thick hair. Smiling to himself. He couldn’t bloody help it.
Nights like that.. when they fell asleep together, whether it was on purpose or on accident, were the best. Harry usually woke up first. Watching Malfoy like this would be the last time he would see this, before getting up. Making the two of them a somewhat decent breakfast.
Harry stood up, immediately coming into Draco’s space. “I.. I’m so sorry..I’m. what are they?” he asked, carefully reaching out to touch the bands, looking at him for permission to do so, which he got in the form of a short nod.
There was a bit of silence. “I mean. It would be great to see what everyone has been up to.. but you know how  there is still bad blood between a the other houses and Slytherin for our.. actions back then.” Pansy muttered, looking around.
“Seeing you two together like this. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. I remember the tirades you used to have about Malfoy being a git Harry.”
“As is my full right.” Draco smiled softly, he had been softer in the mornings recently. Harry had noticed he lost some of his wary ness when he wasn’t suffering from the binding spell as much.
So here he was. Fancy dinner, suited up, hair done and  smiling and nodding as Hermoine talked about work and Ron brought up how he missed them being Aurors together. It’s a wonder really, how far one could get in an conversation with just nodding along.
“No one would ever want me on their team Finnigan. I am the embodiment of evil. And Potter couldn’t take losing too me all the time.” Malfoy snorted.
Harry did as told. Glaring into Malfoy’s eyes as he did so. His own widening. “damn you actually did a good job too. “ he hummed.
He picked up the reigns, letting Loki take a full gallop as he went back, trying to justify halving the trek back of an hour by “giving the horse something to get his energy out.” Totally had nothing to do with the fact he was a little worried about it all. He did of course take his time letting the horse walk out and cool down properly, thanking Helve, his friend, for taking the horse off of him after that to saddle down.
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” Draco said, and waited impatiently for the ink to fill in. Once it did, he unfolded all of the sections of the Map and searched for Luna’s name.
“Thank you.” he said to the phoenix, tears swelling in his eyes, but tears of relief and joy instead of sadness and anger. The phoenix dipped its head, before flying off in a flurry of bright feathers. Draco watched the phoenix fly away, his breathing ragged, before closing his eyes and laying down upon the soft grass.
“I’ve done horrible things, Harry. You don’t get it. People have a right to hate me for what I’ve done, what I was in my past. I’m not just going to go through life without consequences.”
“You didn’t exactly protest though, did you?” he said dryly, fiddling with the doorknob. He stepped inside, and Harry followed him. Really, he’d only come so they could snog in private.
Later that afternoon, Harry returned to the castle to have his career meeting with Headmistress McGonagall. He stopped in front of the griffin staircase, and while he waited for it to go all the way to the top he perused the trip sign up list. Harry had signed up yesterday, before he and Ron had joined Hermione in the library, but the list was full now. Malfoy, Daphne, Padma, Parvati, Hannah, Susan, Sue Li, Dean, Micheal Corner, Ernie Macmillan, and Harry. It’ll be different, three months without Ron and Hermione, Harry thought. But interesting as well. And it’ll be bloody wonderful to have some small semblance of anonymity.
“I think this’ll be good for you, Harry. Plus you could do the teaching program there! I remember how much you loved teaching the DA.”
“Alright,” Harry replied vaguely. He saw Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini sitting in a corner, talking with Daphne Greengrass. Suddenly, he was struck by an idea. It might actually yield something, whether help in finding whoever attacked Draco or advice on taking to Draco about his self-deprecation. Or it would get Draco mad at him. Either one. “I’ll be right back,” he told Hermione, and before he could hesitate he went over to the Slytherins.
“When Lupin taught me I thought of that too, the first time I rode a broom. But he told me that wasn’t a strong enough memory. It ended up being just- not a memory, but a general feeling, from when I was super young and with my parents.” replied Harry, slightly gently, trying not to annoy Draco with the information that his chosen memories might not be strong enough.
“They expelled the Ravenclaw boy. And the Healers say that they’re getting close to a counter-curse.” said Daphne, laying her hand on Draco’s shoulder in a useless gesture of comfort. Draco felt numb. He didn’t respond to her words. “It’s not your fault, Draco.” Daphne whispered, and Draco turned around sharply.
“I thought you liked me. Liked me back,” said Harry, getting off of Draco. His lips were still tingling. Draco looked at him imploringly.
“Because it just happened, nosy.” he retorted, his hand tightening on Harry’s. Amelie butted into the conversation.
“So how’s this map work?” Draco asked nonchalantly, and Potter dug around in his trunk. He came up with a blank piece of parchment and tapped it with his wand.
Hermione had a thoughtful look on her face. “I think it’s… interesting. To see exactly how much he’s changed. And if he’s nicer to you, that’s good.”
“Stop trying to be nice or whatever you’re doing. It’s awful.” ordered Draco, and Potter blinked, his lips curving into a small smile. Stop looking at his mouth, you will not be distracted that easily, Draco told himself.
“Good afternoon, class. I’m Professor Athme and today we will be brewing a Wit-Sharpening potion. Instructions can be found on page 32 of your books, and ingredients are in the cupboard. You have all of class to complete this.” The room filled with the sound of turning pages and clanking as students get out their cauldrons.
The next few minutes were filled with the crinkling sound of wrapping paper being torn and tossed away, and various clunking noises.
Snow smacked against the back of his head, and Draco swore as it trickled down the back of his shirt. He shifted off of Harry, the moment- whatever it had been- broken.
“Didn’t you faint then, too?” prodded Draco, still sniggering. Harry gave him a look and sighed deeply.
“I think the letter’s long enough,” he declared, adding a quick We miss you, Merry Christmas to the end, and signed his name, passing the parchment and quill over to Harry so he could sign also.
“Then I’ll talk to Ron and we’ll try to always have someone with him outside of classes and the common room? At least for the first few days?”
“Here.” he said briskly, then collected his things and left. Harry glanced at him as he walked away. In Potions he had been so… well, Malfoy-ish. But just now he’d been alright.
It was the night of the Crystal Ball, December 22, and Draco was getting ready to head down to the ballroom. If he was being honest with himself he didn’t really want to go. He was over all of these dressy events by now.
“I fucked up tonight.” Draco said. He wiped at his eye, but when he drew his hand away it was smeared with gold. “Fuck.” Daphne pressed her lips together.
They’d never talked about anything like this before, sexuality or liking people. Harry supposed he was just a little surprised, only because it was the first mention of it. Otherwise it didn’t matter much to him, in the sense that it didn’t change who Draco was. He was still the same Draco Harry knew.
“Potter what the hell are you- FUCK- doing here?” said Malfoy weakly as he tried to stand, but collapsed as his ankle gave out. Harry lunged forward and caught him by the arm.
“Practice makes perfect, Potter.” Draco responded, a smirk curling his lips. Harry smiled back before pressing their lips together again, their entwined hands held between them.
“This is not fun- FUCK- Potter,” said Draco, cursing when his foot slipped and he fell onto the ice, a cold chill seeping through his clothes. He stood up slowly, wincing at the cold and his banged knees.
Harry and Draco tugged their trunks out of their room and into the hallway, where their luggage joined the pile of trunks from the other Hogwarts students on one side of the hallway. Harry lingered by their dorm door, eyes skimming over the familiar features of the room, remembering memories in the dorm room with a nostalgic smile. Late night talks, kissing, cuddling. Falling asleep together, just sleeping together. Draco helping Harry with homework. Small, everyday things that blurred into each other, but that Harry remembered fondly nonetheless.
“A bit annoying, isn’t it,” began Daphne airily. “Draco suddenly turning french.” Harry smiled in amusement.
Harry and Daphne stood to the side, watching her dart around the motionless figure, flicking her wand this way and that.
“Draco! Are you alright?” came a loud voice, and he groggily opened his eyes to see Daphne leaning over him. His head throbbed, and he groaned at a wave of pain.
“The classes aren’t in french, are they?” Daphne whispered, with a worried expression, and Simon chuckled.
He made his way to the third floor corridor, cautiously peeking into the room where he’d found Malfoy previously, but it was empty. Figured.
He grabbed his toothbrush and went into the bathroom. When he’s done, he walked back into the dorm and took off his glasses to leave on his bedside table before climbing into bed and falling asleep.
“Lies,” Draco muttered under his breath, and Daphne bounded over to perch on the arm of the chair Harry was sitting in.
Draco almost wanted to fight it, because if he was being honest with himself he was scared. Scared of his feelings never being reciprocated, scared of messing up and ruining a friendship that he had already come to depend on. He didn’t even know if Harry was gay.
It had been more than Draco could’ve ever dreamed of, and yesterday morning, the day after, he’d woken up half thinking it had all been a very vivid dream, but then he’d realized it was indeed his reality when Harry had kissed him good morning.
Five minutes later he was sequestered back in the carriages, staring out of the fogged-up pane of glass as the countryside rolled by.
“Got it.” replied Harry, picking up the stirring stick. “Ten counter clockwise… ten clockwise…” Draco rubbed his eyes and closed a few jars.
Draco flushed again. “Those ones aren’t very good, and I needed the practice anyway,” he mumbled, but Harry noticed Daphne still scrutinizing the blond with interest.
“Alright,” replied Draco grudgingly. “I feel like Hermione wouldn’t mind a romantic gesture. Maybe… fancy dinner in Hogsmeade? I dunno. Something that shows you put a lot of thought into it. Or if she’s ever talked about a hobby, or something she’s interested in besides the usual...something that shows you pay attention to what she says?”
Draco suddenly saw the rest of the Hogwarts students, clustered together before a large fountain, which had a small plaque on it, unreadable from his distance. He walked slowly to the group, still trying to take in everything around him.
But he did. Had. Does. And that knowledge is just...infinitely precious to Harry. Wondrous. Amazing.
“Good evening, students.” came Professor McGonagall’s voice from the portrait hole, and everyone looked up in surprise. The Headmistress smiled at their bemused expressions.
“Because I know you want to be a better person, and I know you can be a better person. This is the first step on that path. Pansy told me why you leave on days like yesterday-”
“You okay?” murmured Harry, his eyes searching Draco’s. Draco knew what he was asking about- their discussion from earlier.
“You might have white hair, but don’t worry, you aren’t ancient yet.” joked Harry, and Draco rolled his eyes.
Daphne gave Draco a subdued smile before they rejoined the group ahead of them, standing in an ornately decorated room with a large and grand fireplace, vividly green flames flickering within. Harry felt a pang of anxiety at the sight of the bright green flames and fingered the necklace he’d gotten from Draco, the smooth, small pendant of a stag sliding through his fingers. Calm washed over him and he took several measured breaths, feeling the anxiety ebb away. He felt Draco’s eyes on him, and the Slytherin squeezed his hand comfortingly. Harry met the concerned grey eyes and smiled.
“Oh,” he said, uncomfortably aware that he had promised Draco not to tell Hermione. “They said they’d help us and Ron- well- guard Draco,” he told her in an undertone. It was the truth. Just not all of it.
“Want to go flying later?” offered Harry as they took a shortcut through a door disguising itself at a bit of wall. Draco was walking in front of him, as this little passage was only wide enough for one person. It was useful, though, it saved them the trouble of navigating the moving stairways.
Draco’s grey eyes met his inquisitively, and Harry coughed, knowing he’d been caught staring again. Draco smirked, clearly pleased, and his hand slipped into Harry’s under the table, the motion already familiar, comforting. Harry laced his fingers through Draco’s, brushing his thumb over Draco’s hand slowly, enjoying the look of slight exasperation Draco sent him as the blond talked to Camille, across the table from them.
“Ron’s in detention with Professor Eagry, Dean and Seamus dared him to break a window.” Hermione said, her disapproval of this evident in her voice. Harry chuckled and took out a roll of parchment. He’d have to do this by himself, then. Though Hermione would probably help him if he struggled enough.
“I have this damn eyeshadow all over my hands.” Draco said, letting out a laugh. Or a sob. Harry couldn’t tell. But he chuckled, knowing that was Draco’s way of asking if things were alright between them.
“I think so. He hasn’t said otherwise, and he still lives in the flat above the shop.” answered Ron. “We didn’t see him as much as usual this summer.”
“Oh, fuck off.” Draco sat back in his seat. “Shall I tell them your story then, Daphne? When your sister walked in on you and the older man getting it on?” Pansy and Blaise laughed, and Daphne colored.
And so they sat there on the ground, Draco’s back against Harry’s chest, hearts beating in time. Together.
“Well, the next time you decide to disappear please leave a note.” replied Daphne indignantly, finally letting go of him. Draco gave her a small nod, still wondering over the fact that she had cared enough to notice his absence. The two walk up the aisle to the eighth year table and sat across from the other two Slytherins.
AH! It's done! I hoped you liked my (quite) fluffy fic and it's small side of angst. Please feel free to leave a comment, or a kudos, they really make my whole week! :) i love you all <3
“Because,” she said, rolling her eyes. “Father dearest told me not to, just like Blaise and Pansy’s parents told them, but I rather adore breaking Father’s rules and you looked lonely anyway.”
“Luna said you talked to her. Brought her salve and food.” Ron spoke up suddenly, and Malfoy looked at him.
“Sorry,” he said, sounding not sorry at all, before continuing his kisses down Draco’s neck, his hands exploring Draco’s stomach, his chest. Harry sucked a tender spot on Draco’s throat, before licking down his neck, and Draco let out a small sigh. Merlin, I could die from this, thought Draco, his head spinning as he lay there, almost prone, unable to move, not wanting anything except for Harry to never stop doing what he was doing. His own hands were wandering instinctively across Harry’s back, sliding across his warm skin, feeling the muscles shift on Harry’s back.
“Happy Halloween to all of you,” she said. “Now, could all of the eighth years leaving for Beauxbatons tonight please stay behind. The rest of you may go on to your dorms.” The students at the House tables began to trickle out.
“Hey,” said Daphne, perching on a sofa arm. Draco gently shoved her over to make room and sat down next to her, greeting Blaise.
Surprisingly, Draco enjoyed Weasley’s company too, although, like Potter and himself, they stuck to last names out of habit and the fact that they’d only been friendly for a few days. Weasley knew a lot about Quidditch, from brooms to teams, and was entertaining to be around. Weasley was also good at Wizard’s chess, as was Draco, so they both relished having someone with skill to play against this afternoon. (Draco had won more than him, though)
Harry blinked. “Er. Because I didn’t want it to hit you?” he said, and Draco rolled his eyes, crossing his arms.
Thanks so much for all the love! Just a note: I don't speak french so my apologies if the french phrases are not entirely correct.
“Yeah, yeah.” replied Ron with a small grin. “Hey- I was thinking of going flying tonight. Anyone up for it?”
“Oh nevermind, I found them.” came Draco’s voice, and a few seconds later he trod out of the bathroom, green slippers on his feet. Harry laughed. “Shut up, Potty.” Draco scowled as he passed by Harry, who breathed in the smell of sweet mint.
“You always tap your fingers on something. Like you’re playing.” Harry explains, and the ghost of a smile flits across Malfoy’s face.
It had been intoxicating, to be that close to him. Close enough to count every eyelash, every crease in his lower lip. They’d stared at each other, and Harry had been physically unable to look away, the other boy had mesmerized him.
“Honestly, it didn’t occur to me.” Harry said. “Not to come with you, I mean. Hermione always says I have a saving-people thing.” he smiled, hearing Hermione’s exasperated voice in his head. “ And yes, Malfoy and I… we’ve never liked each other. But just because I don’t like him doesn’t mean I won’t help him in a situation like this. And things have changed, I think. We definitely aren’t friends, but I don’t hate him like I used to.”
“You are cute. You’re shorter than me.” replied Harry, fingering the ends of Draco’s braid. His hair was very soft. Draco was right, it was a bit messy, but better than his last attempt.
Four weeks fly by, and the weather is bitterly cold. Draco’s spending all of his time with Harry, Daphne, Camille, Simon, and Amelie, and loving every second of it.
Ten minutes later Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Malfoy pick their way down to the Quidditch Pitch, all of the boys with brooms in hand. Harry carried a Snitch in the other hand- the
“Yeah.” replied Harry, amused. Draco shook his head and muttered something under his breath before letting out a great sigh.
“Pansy did it to me once. I liked it.” mused Draco. “Alright Camille, as long as I look good.” he announced, and Camille smiled mischievously.
“Now who’s the one with a philosophical look on his face?” teased Draco, and Harry swept his meandering thoughts aside.
Some time later Hermione and Ron joined him again. The three of them had stayed with Harry for the first few hours, but then the other two had left to get food and sleep. They’d been bringing Draco food whenever they came back to the hospital wing-which was often- but he ignored the offered sustenance.
“Why is this so fucking difficult?” muttered Harry under his breath as he wandered the aisles of the shop that he and Draco were in. He was trying to think of something to get Draco for Christmas, but had been drawing a blank for the past half hour on any objects that Draco wanted or needed. Nothing for school, or quidditch, and Harry knew if he tried to get Draco clothes it probably wouldn’t be up to stack with his normal attire. Draco didn’t collect anything, and all his hobbies or interests were something Harry had already considered.
“Oh. Me too.” Draco wanted to knock his head on the table. This is worse than bickering, worse than being nice. This is just horrendous. Even the knowledge that Potter will be at Beauxbatons with him isn’t enough to distract him from the awkwardness that practically coats both of them.
Harry had huffed in frustration. No explanation, only a request to take notes. He supposed he should be thankful Malfoy had said please.
But if Draco had known civility- hell, ignoring him, even- was this awkward, he wouldn’t have made that promise to himself.
“Sue, Padma, can you come help me find something?” asked Daphne, and the two girls quickly got up and follow her away, not looking at all sorry to depart the scene. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are left awkwardly staring at Malfoy, who’s still watching Daphne walk away with a sulky expression. Then he sighed, and looked up at the ceiling as if casting a quick prayer before meeting Harry’s gaze.
“Well you better start talking, because I want to know everything,” she ordered. “Potter, you’re dismissed.”
“You would have to arrange your own modes of transportation to return for break, yes. But Beauxbatons does also have a Christmas break.”
Draco frowned. “Yeah, I hadn’t thought about that.” he replied. Less privacy, which meant less of the times they both loved when it was just the two of them and they could talk,
Before he entered the castle, he tilted his head back up at the starry night sky, looking for the familiar constellation that he’s named after. It didn’t take that long to find. He remembered years ago, when his mother would take him outside at night, spreading a blanket on the lawn and pointing out the stars for him. He allowed himself a small, secret smile. Then he went inside.
“Bloody wonderful,” muttered Draco. “A room with Potter and Longbottom. I could just go jump off the Astronomy Tower. At least then I would die faster.”
“Oh, yeah,” said Harry, remembering the giant, stately Abraxans flying through the air, the powder-blue carriage careening wildly after them. “Well, that was a really good Patronus, Draco.”
“You never know.” replied Harry, eyes tracing the invisible lines of the constellations. “Hey, isn’t there a constellation called Draco?”
“Tomorrow, then?” he offered, and Harry nodded. “Oh, did you deliver Hermione’s letter?” continued Draco as he pulled his blanket up to cover him.
“Yeah, alright.” he sighed finally, brushing strands of his hair out of his eyes, before looking up and meeting Harry’s gaze. There was something… different in his eyes now. Something more intense, but Draco couldn’t place it.
“You can’t do anything about it,” Draco said quietly, but there was a steel edge in his voice. “The fact is that I did horrible things and I was a coward. I’m the reason Death Eaters broke into this school, I’m the reason Dumbledore is dead, what I did sparked everything into happening.” Harry’s heart broke a little to hear Draco’s voice get steadily quieter and fill with despair.
“Hey, Dean I’m alright now.” he replied, and Thomas offered a smile to Draco as well as they passed, and Draco returned it hesitantly. He and Harry entered the dorm, Harry still keeping a firm grip on his hand. They went over to Draco’s bed, and Harry picked up a quill laying forgotten on his bedside table.
“Look, there’s a table for the eighth years,” whispered Hermione in his ear, and Harry saw a smaller table up front, facing the House tables and below the professors table. A smattering of eighth years sat rather uncomfortably at their new table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione quickly make their way there, Harry determinedly ignoring the excited voices that surround him as he passed between the Hufflepuff and Gryffindor table, and after what seemed like an eternity of walking they made it to the eighth years and sat. He took a deep breath and squashed the anxiety stirring in his stomach from the crowds.
Draco closed his eyes, trying to go to sleep, but it was in vain. He sighed again, angry with himself for stressing about this so much.
“Come on,” he said, grasping Draco’s hand and tugging him up. Draco rolled his eyes but allowed himself to be led from the room, inwardly berating the stubbornness of Gryffindors. Particularly this Gryffindor. His boyfriend. Draco marveled at that statement, even now. It felt so foreign when it rolled off his tongue, but oddly familiar at the same time. It did have the added bonus of seeing Harry smile whenever he said it, so that was something.
Draco’s head popped up at Camille’s delighted exclamation, as did everyone else’s. They were at dinner, and sure enough, out the windows Draco could see white flakes floating down from the sky.
She laughed. “Yes, it’s Crookshanks.” As she goes on talking the basket began to hiss and quake a little. “He had a good time in Australia, but his fur got even harder to manage than my hair.” Ron smiled and twirled a strand of her hair around his finger.
After dinner, Draco and Camille went to go to study in the library, and Harry took the opportunity to pull Daphne aside. He hadn’t been able to think of anything to get Draco for Christmas, but an idea had struck him- of doing something with him, not buying him something. Harry was inspired by the memory of when they had stargazed together, and Amelie had told him that there was supposed to be a meteor shower on the night of the ball, so Harry was thinking of bringing Draco out to watch. He wanted to run it by Daphne, though, as she was Draco’s closest friend at Beauxbatons aside from Harry.
“I’ll take that as a compliment, then.” They take the phials up to the professor’s desk and set them down before walking back to their desk. As they pack up, Harry’s struck by an idea.
Harry put his hand up; as did Amelie and a few other people in the class. Draco’s hand stayed down next to him.
“No one’s in trouble. At the start of term I reminded you that I would come back in a week to discuss the exchange trip with Beauxbatons Academy of Magic.” A couple of people nodded. Harry perked up and listened.
Before they went down to dinner, Draco persuaded Harry to come back to their dorm with him, saying he wanted to drop off his book.
“Merlin, don’t ever do that again.” Harry murmured. “I thought I wouldn’t reach you in time.” Draco let his head drop forward.
“I’ll come with you.” offered Harry, and the two made their way through the crowd. Harry kept an eye out for either missing Slytherin, but didn’t see anything.
“Er…” he says. It was excruciating to sit there under the blond’s curious gaze, and Harry has never been good at excuses. And apparently he wasn’t as inconspicuous as he’d thought when he would watch Malfoy in class, or the hallways. Bloody brilliant. “Have I?” he replies weakly, fidgeting with the edge of his parchment. Malfoy tilts his head slightly and Harry knows he sees right through Harry’s attempt at playing dumb.
“Darling, trust me. Besides, your friends will be there with you. It will be good for you to not be alone.”
“Whatever,” muttered Draco, standing up, still with a pink tinge in his cheeks, and Harry tugged him down onto the chair so he was basically in Harry’s lap. “Potter!” Harry laughed.
“Death Eater,” muttered one of the boys, glaring at Draco, who glared right back until the other boy looked away. Just because he didn’t bully people anymore didn’t mean he
“Welcome, students, to NEWT Transfiguration. I am Professor Eagry.” She was a tall, slim, pale blond woman in voluminous black robes with her hands clasped behind her back. “Today we will be reviewing human transfiguration. I will put you in pairs and you will take turns attempting to change aspects of each other’s appearance. First, I want you to change the color of your partner’s eyebrows. When you have all accomplished this I will give you the next exercise.”
“That’s a good look on you.” commented Harry, a laugh interwoven in his voice. Draco raised his eyebrows.
“..I heard McGonagall got a new Transfiguration professor. Makes sense, since she’s Headmistress now, but it’ll be weird not learning from her..” Susan discreetly pointed out a tall
“What does that even mean?” he replied, and Potter smiled and sat next to him on his bed. Draco coughed in surprise but tried to remain collected at the steady warmth of Potter’s body next to his.
But suddenly the Patronus stopped coming together, and the light ceased coming from Draco’s wand, and Harry looked over in confusion at the blond in time to see his eyes flutter shut, and Draco crumpled to the ground.
“Interesting,” was his only comment, and Harry turned to Ron, wanting to see his reaction to all of this.
Maybe he’ll initiate something… but Daphne didn’t seem to think that was likely, if she told me Draco liked me back. She seemed to think I’d have to make the first move.
“Fucking….Finnegan.” Draco muttered through clumsy lips. His vision went black and he succumbed to unconsciousness.
The scars from the Sectumsempra crisscrossed over Draco’s chest, long and thin and silvery. Harry traced them with a finger softly. He remembered that day so clearly. How Draco had gasped and fallen backwards, the bloom of his blood in the water, across his shirt. The pained, small noises he’d made. How terrible Harry’d felt, watching him lay there.
With a small pop, Andromeda appeared, arms cradled around Teddy, who was crying from the Apparation. She gave Harry an exasperated look. “Well, now I know he doesn’t like Apparating.” Harry chuckled half-heartedly, mind still on Lupin and Tonks.
“Weren’t you just telling me about your superior shopping skills? Besides, would you rather do it now, or after dinner when it’s freezing and dark?” cajoled Harry, and Draco rolled his eyes, brushing his blond hair out of his eyes.
“Wow. My Patronus is a fox. Apparently we’ll be working on them later in Defense, I’m glad I already know how to do mine. Are you going to this club?”
“Brilliant.” he replied, settling into his blanket-cave. “I should get sick more often, if it means Draco Malfoy fetches me breakfast.” Draco chuckled but left before Harry saw the flush on his cheeks.
“Fuck off,” he said sleepily, rolling back over and tucking the extra pillow under his head, but Harry’s voice sounded from behind him.
to light his way, as his eyes have adjusted to the dark; and the moonlight still flows in from tall windowpanes at intervals along the corridor.
Harry had woken up early this morning, mind ever fixated on the dream he’d had last night. Everything about last night, actually. From the major things, like his talk with Draco, to the small details, like how the moonlight had lit up the gold around Draco’s eyes. Made a halo of his hair. The sound of his voice.
A flash of gold. Over by one of the goalposts. Draco locked his gaze on it and lay horizontal on his broom as he flew towards it, watching the Snitch flit this way and that as he approached. He could hear the rushing sound of Harry flying behind him, catching up fast. Draco clutched his broom tightly and shot forward, then went vertical, following the Snitch into the sky.
Honestly Harry welcomed the change- he had enough on his mind already without dealing with Malfoy’s snide remarks. All the same, it was still odd.
“Do you want to be a teacher after you graduate?” asked Amelie as they sat down. She seemed unfazed to be with Harry Potter, something Harry appreciated.
“Surprisingly, yes. Although Pansy wanted me to tell you-” he glanced at Harry with amusement- “that she would have words with you if anything happened to me.” Harry looked appropriately humbled by this.
But Malfoy hadn’t seemed....hostile. Not unfriendly. If anything he’d found Harry amusing. Or rather, Harry’s flushing and stammering and awkwardness had been laughable to him. Harry groaned and closed his eyes briefly. He was so bad at these things.
“See you,” repeated Draco, now immersed in his book. Harry sighed, half-exasperated and half-amused, before heading down to the common room with his school things.
Harry nodded again, slowly, pondering this new information. So Draco had seen Fawkes, on that day he wouldn’t talk about, and had seen his happiest memories… Harry had never heard of that about a phoenix, but then again, they were powerful magical creatures.
“Alright, students, it is time for our exchange students to leave us.” announced Madam Maxime from the front of the dining hall. “If the Hogwarts students would please follow me.”
“Mother,” he said to himself, recognizing the elegant handwriting. He opened it and sat back down again.
“Let’s just ask Hermione later.” he muttered, and Harry nodded agreement. Ten minutes go by, and more than half of the class looked as lost as Harry felt. He glanced to his right and saw Hermione scribbling away, and hastened to look like he’s taking notes, but the only thing that came to mind were Oliver Wood’s Quidditch maneuvers to use against Ravenclaw, so Harry wrote those down slowly as Professor Flitwick continued to talk.
They sat at the eighth year table, and began to eat, chatting with the people around them. Suddenly there’s a loud exclamation of “Oh there he is!” and Daphne Greengrass launched herself up and ran down the main aisle. Harry turned his head, as do many people intrigued by the noise, in time to see her jump on a startled-looking Malfoy.
“Look at that! A thousand yards. I bet none of you could get the little person to run a thousand yards,” Malfoy said, preening.
“No,” he replied snidely, and Harry chuckled, his hands moving to Draco’s neck and drawing him back down and pressing their lips together. Draco lost himself gladly in the
“I hate them too,” he said quietly, and Daphne nodded agreement, looking as though she did not trust her voice as she glanced back over her shoulder. She took a shaky breath and Harry felt another wave of sympathy for her. Apparently Draco felt the same because he gave her a quick, one armed hug.
Draco doesn’t, though. He and Potter might be tentative friends-honestly, tentative acquaintances- but they’re not that close that Draco can stick his wand in Potter’s face and cast a spell on him.
“If you want, I know a night vision spell.” offered Hermione, and Harry exchanged a quick glance with Malfoy.
He was glad to return to Hogwarts, to see his friends again, but… things would be different here. They were different here. He was the Death Eater, Harry was the Chosen One. When people found out about their relationship… it wouldn’t stop him from dating Harry, but it would make things difficult. For both of them. For Harry.
“Nothing, actually.” said Harry conversationally, and kept walking, tugging Draco along with him. Draco glanced back once to see the two students looking after them and muttering to each other. I knew this would happen, thought Draco.
When he’d seen Theo and Draco go into that hallway, he’d followed them, out of nothing more than curiosity. But then he’d seen Theo make a move on Draco, seen them kissing…
The next morning, Draco woke up early and donned his robes. Walking down to the common room, he smirked and rolled his eyes.
“I think we should stop for today.” said Harry, peering at him with obvious concern. Draco cleared his head of it's jumble of thoughts, drew himself up and stood.
“It wasn’t your fault.” he said. “I know you think it is, but it wasn’t.” Draco didn’t say anything. Harry was wrong about that, but Draco didn’t want to argue about this again. Right now he just wanted to sit with his boyfriend and enjoy the fact that Harry wasn’t dead or still unconscious.
Harry ate in the Great Hall with Ron, Hermione, and Neville, and he and Hermione head up early to the common room. Ron and Neville stay behind and join Dean and some of the other boys in a Quidditch discussion.
“I don’t know, watching you get drunk was pretty funny.” teased Harry, and Draco rolled his eyes, throwing a pillow at him. Harry caught it and tucked it under his head.
“Morning.” he replied, wrinkling his nose as Harry leaned in to kiss in. “Harry, I haven’t brushed my teeth, don’t kiss me yet.” he complained weakly, but his hands were reaching forward of their own instinct and threading with Harry’s hair. Damn. When I’m around him, I just lose every bit of self control. It’s insane.
His hand dropped as he watched the sky, and the owl flew off when he stopped stroking it. Draco’s chin dropped, and he breathed quick, shallow breaths. His eyes are squeezed shut, and in that darkness he saw his father, his mother, his aunt, Dumbledore, Luna Lovegood and everyone who’d been locked in the dungeons of his house…
Hermione smiled mischievously. “Yep.” She showed Malfoy how to play, and Harry felt almost a little fond of the Slytherin as his eyes light up and he swiped the screen vigorously. Malfoy snatched the phone from Hermione and bragged shamelessly when the game ended, even if he didn’t get very far.
“Yeah. I’ve been having Christmas at Hogwarts for six years.” replied Harry thoughtfully as he sank gratefully into an armchair. “Merlin, it’s so nice to sit down.” he added. Draco smirked at him as he also sat down.
“How was that healing test you had today?” asked Harry. Draco stood up to greet him, pleased that Harry had remembered.
“Thank you. For telling me.” said Harry steadily. He pushed his emotions away; the horror, not at the scar or Draco, but that Draco had had to experience that. The sadness, for the same reason. And the empathy, because Harry knew what it felt like to be broken, knew what it felt like when no one else understood you.
Harry takes a deep breath, slides his hand into Draco’s. The other boy’s hand tightens momentarily around his.
“Do we have classes today?” asked Harry, his hand slipping into Draco’s as they walked through the halls.
“Off to France in two days!” exclaimed Ron. “You two ready?” Draco and Harry exchanged a glance, and Harry grinned.
“Well, don’t.” ordered Draco. “If I can forgive you- and you know how little I do that- you can forgive yourself. You didn’t mean to.” Harry recognized the truth in his words with a small pang of amusement sweeping away the sadness. (Draco held so many grudges) Harry lay down next to him. Draco traced Harry’s tattoo with one fingertip, drawing comforting lines on his skin. Then he sat up, and Harry watched him, eyes sweeping over Draco’s pale skin. “Come on,” said Draco, a bit pink in the face. “Dinner.” He held out a hand, and Harry accepted it, the strong grip pulling him up and back to reality.
“Yeah, you were a right foul git,” Harry joked, and Draco looked slightly offended, but smiled ruefully.
“...actually I like being his friend, Ronald…” Draco smiled at that. I like being your friend too, Hermione, and for the record I think you can do better than that red-headed twat, he replied back to her in his head.
“Wait, what’s Riley’s?” asked Harry, and he saw his own slightly confused expression mirrored on the two Slytherin’s.
“Yes, Mother.” he answered dutifully. Draco could only imagine what the Aurors thought of all this. The young man with blond hair and a dark suit saying goodbye to his mother, who was living in a shell of a home. He wondered if their eyes were drawn to his covered forearm, if they could see the memories flitting like ghosts behind his eyes. If they hated him, as he hated himself.
Hermione, the girl he’d once sneered at for being Muggleborn was a very smart, witty, nice person to be around. Draco finally had someone that would discuss the finer points of something obscure with him, like if the use of moonlace was more potent in the Draught of Living Death than moonleaf. (They’d eventually decided to agree to disagree when Potter and Weasley had moaned that they’d been bickering for three hours and could they please shut up)
Malfoy grumbled, pulling the blanket off of him and lifting up his sweater, revealing the bruises on his ribs. “You did this to me. Poor old me. Now hurry up. There’s muffins in the cabinet too.” he shooed him off, quickly covering himself back up.
“I suppose. I don’t even know if the kids want to see me. Albus hates me celeb status as much as me. James.. he’s to cool to talk to dad and he isn’t exactly happy with the divorce.”
Focus forwards again.. almost there…. They were too caught up. Grabbing the Snitch  at the same time as they crashed into the ground.
For my story, Draco suffers from pretty severe PTSD. I will be basing it of some of my own experiences with the disorder. But I am open to criticism. He’s distanced himself a lot from the wizarding world. Living far from England and up in the mountains, fending for himself and his family most of the time. He’s learned to enjoy a simple life and get by with distraction after distraction. He's taken up fishing and other muggle activities. Living a mondaneish life.
He had his life threatened yet again. His sons life. He had almost died just now to safe this absolute moron of a man. And he had the audacity to fall asleep like that? in the middle of a field somewhere in fuck knows where?
And he most certainly knew Draco was in no state of mind to be in isolation. To be alone and fend for himself. Harry most certainly didn’t feel like being alone and he at least had people close to him who knew how to deal with him. He’d just have to explain how as soon as he apparated in front of Luna’s house. He was taken away. He had planned on just taking a breather, talking to Luna and clearing his mind and returning.
Scorpius is what had kept him from giving up. From ending it all and letting his mother deal with his late fathers mess alone. Not that he had the gut to end it himself. He would’ve thrown himself in the death eater hunting party’s arms, they had a special grudge for him it seemed. Probably had to do with his father… and what he’d done in school because of the man. His mother? shed moved on Pretty much, they hadn't been together for long after the war. She went remarried another ex deatheather that had also survived the huntings. he send her letters the first few years but that had long since stopped too. As far as Draco knew, she didn't know or wish to know what Scorpius looked like.
“I was yeah… I love the game but honestly. Playing professionally isn’t for me. I’ve been trying to kind of lay low you know.” Harry rubbed the back of his head, feeling a bit awkward. It had always been a dream of his to join the falcons but he didn’t feel like he had it in him.
Harry’s first attempt was most definitely a fail, he flopped around but managed to stay on. Making some comments on how Weasley’s bucking brooms were better than this.
“i.. thank you?” Draco was a bit stunned for a moment, before he remembered he had snitched on them once and she still had scars on her hands from the lines she’d had to write.
And even on said day. Harry had to be reminded by ginny as he was making dinner himself that evening. “you couldn’t have told me before I practically showered in garlic… I know we dislike Malfoy. But I don’t want to smell like shit.” Harry whined, attempting to wash the smell off, without result. Ginny just chuckled. “Serves you. I had a full day shift and you barged in at 2AM. Go dress. I’ll finish this up. Please do let me know how it goes. “ She smiled, rather friendly today. Of course. They were babysitting Rose, whom was happily chattering with Lilly about going into town tomorrow.
“Tell me Dra… Malfoy. It’s incredibly frustrating not to know. I don’t know if you’ve noticed but your lovely little binding spell hasn’t been lifted. Not just that. We’re friends. I miss hanging out with you.”
So she cheated on Potter. And that made him leave like an idiot.. he should have been back already. Potter was dramatic, but when he cooled down he would have at least contacted Hermoine or Ron right? It was concerning he wasn’t back yet, even Draco found himself getting increasingly more worried. Something must be wrong. Terribly wrong.
He saw him tense up slightly. “She has a good idea on what is going on. But if she is right you will never forgive me.” Draco answered slowly, thinking every word through very well. “I know you would probably like to know more but.. I don’t have the words to explain it to you. So topic change potter.” He said it so coldly. It sliced through Harry. Nope not bringing that up again.
"It's like you've never been tattooed before, Potter." Malfoy grumbled as Harry moved to sit in the chair, he turned back towards the file.
"Yeah," Harry spoke absentmindedly, gazing at the intricate flowers woven throughout the Mark, "you designed it?" He looked up at Malfoy in awe. A faint blush was dusted across Malfoy's face, and he just nodded. He drew a few more lines on the page, then rested the pen behind his ear.
"Yes." He said. Malfoy nodded and went about disinfecting and shaving the patch of skin, then Malfoy applied the tattoo guide he had made to the skin, and held up the mirror again.
That being said, the only tattoos he got were flowers. For multiple reasons, but the main ones being: he could design the tattoo himself, and that the Mark was an ugly thing on his body and he only wanted beautiful things to be on him forever. Pansy had tried to convince Draco and Blaise to get matching Slytherin crest tattoos with her, but Draco refused and instead decided to get a poppy with silver petals and a green stem, Slytherin colors to be "matching" and a poppy for remembrance.
Harry followed Malfoy as he led him to one of the back rooms, Malfoy placed Harry's file down on the countertop where the tattooing equipment had already been set up. Malfoy was setting up some things and flipping through the file with his back turned to Harry, and Harry just stood awkwardly in the doorway, watching Malfoy. Malfoy turned, finally annoyed by Harry's staring, and gestured towards the seat in the room.
"I'm not amazing, I just do it to spend time with mother, and besides what else am I supposed to do all day?" Draco, walked over to a bench that was on the side of the room and sat down, Pansy and Blaise followed him.
"Hello Pansy, Blaise, it's lovely to see you again, it's been a long time hasn't it?" Draco said sarcastically, Pansy just rolled her eyes and Blaise shot him a grin.
"Alright Potter," Malfoy said once he had finished, "let's get you up to the front desk so you can pay and I can give you a pamphlet of what not to do while your tattoo heals."
Designing tattoos eventually led Draco to applying for a job at a muggle tattoo parlor; and, with proper training, he became one of the most skilled artists in the shop. Eventually earning enough to rent a flat nearby, he moved out of the manor, and shortly afterwards his Aunt Andromeda and her grandson Teddy moved in with his mother. The sisters had decided that their family had been separated for long enough.
"So, here's the sketch I drew up. In the file all it says is a nine and three quarters tattoo, and before Luna left she said you generally like your tattoos simple, so I just drew the sign from the station." Malfoy spoke, turning the sketchpad around for Harry to look at.
"Draco would be honored to show you his work, wouldn't you dear?" Narcissa gave a pointed look at Draco, he rolled his eyes then shrugged.
"What I mean is: what are you doing in Luna's flat, Malfoy?" Harry said, following Malfoy as he walked through the house.
"Yeah, a tattoo. I've been wanting one for a while now and I know that if you design it, it'll turn out great." She smiled.
"Hello Potter, it's been a while... hasn't it?" Malfoy said, cooly. Eyeing Harry with an air of indifference. Harry was almost at a loss for words- almost.
"Don't pretend to be humble Dray, it doesn't work for you. I miss the pompous idiot you used to be." Pansy nudged his shoulder.
It had been a little over a year since his last Malfoy encounter when Harry saw him again, at Harry's favorite tattoo parlor- The Inkubus.
"This still good?" Malfoy looked at Harry as he looked in the mirror. He nodded, and Malfoy smiled. "I'm sure you know all the recommendations for getting tattoos and all that, so if you're cool with it let's dive right in." He said, Harry gave a small smile, and Malfoy put the mirror away, picked up his machine and set to work. Harry relaxed into his chair, letting his mind drift as the needle went over his skin, and before he knew it Malfoy was setting the needle down and picking the mirror back up looking at Harry expectantly. Harry looked into the mirror and smiled.
"As eloquent as ever, Potter. What I'm doing here is opening the door for you." He rolled his eyes and stepped away from the frame, leaving the door open and walking into the flat. Harry followed him.
Of course, Potter's looks didn't stop Draco from being snarky, they didn't stop Draco from behaving just like the kid from Hogwarts, Draco and Potter interacted as if the past wasn't behind them, as if they were still in school and the biggest concern they had was their petty rivalry. Potter and Draco spoke briefly before Luna whisked Potter away to their scheduled tea.
"Relax, Potter. I'm not going to hex you," Malfoy looked down at the pen and paper in his hands with a smirk, "not even sure how I'd go about doing that. I have to sketch the idea to make sure you like it, no need to jump every three seconds. C'mon, Potter, if I hexed you I'd lose my job." Malfoy smiled, it was easygoing, different from his smirks and forced smiles from Hogwarts.
"I'm living here for the time being." Malfoy said, as he entered the kitchen, Luna was standing over the sink mixing something in a pot that sat within.
"Erm, hi Malfoy," Harry craned his neck to see if Luna was in one of the private rooms where the tattooing actually took place, "where's Luna?" He asked after not being able to see her.
Living with Luna had made Draco see far too many people from school for his liking. The worst of the many visitors to Luna's (
"It's perfect." Harry spoke with a bright smile, Malfoy was right, he liked his tattoos simple and to the point most of the time. Malfoy's face lit up.
busy, dealing with his fame and fan clubs." Even though Harry couldn't see Malfoy, he knew that he had rolled his eyes.
"Oh, right, I'm sorry... hey look," Harry stood up and pulled up the back of his shirt, Malfoy looked away, but curiosity got the better of him and he looked back to see Harry's
drawings, and just had to stop by and see them for ourselves." At this Narcissa's face brightened, and she clasped her hands together.
After their first meeting after the war, Harry avoided going to Luna's flat, that was until he was invited to Luna
"He needed somewhere to live while he looks for a new flat, so I offered my spare bedroom." She smiled, then looked between them. "Harry would you help me? I'm making food for the owls that deliver the post, but it seems more soup then solid." She lifted the pot and he heard it slosh.
Harry had scheduled an appointment for a new tattoo, a small 9¾  behind his right ear. He entered the shop expecting Luna to greet him and get him ready for his appointment, but when he entered Malfoy sat behind the receptionist's desk. The bell over the door chimed as the door slowly closed behind Harry, Malfoy looked up from the book he was reading and smirked.
Harry lay on the chair, the left side of his face pressed into it. Malfoy had pulled his stool around so he sat right next to Harry's head. Harry didn't know where to look, being so close to Malfoy, so he gazed just past him out of focus. Harry hadn't realized Malfoy had put gloves on until he felt the rubbery material touch the skin behind his ear. He held up a mirror so Harry could see where his finger was.
After Narcissa had left Pansy lunged at Draco, and enveloped him in a hug. "Dray! I've missed you so much!" She squealed. Draco chuckled lightly, Blaise clapped a hand on his back.
"He's wonderful isn't he? You'll have to schedule something with him again when you have more time, he specializes in hand poked tattoos." She sat on the desk that Malfoy was working at and looked back and forth between the two.
Harry had knocked on the door, checking his watch quickly to make sure he wasn't too early. He was supposed to pick her up so they could go and meet Hermione and Ron for tea in Diagon Alley. He heard some scuffling inside and then Luna called "Can you get it?" Harry didn't know if that was directed at him until the door opened and he was met face to face with Draco Malfoy. He looked just as thin as ever, but in a healthy sort of way not in the sickly thin way he had been, he looked more sleek and elegant than he had in his Hogwarts days, his hair was slightly longer than before and had parted it so his fringe hung over his right eye. He tucked his fringe behind his ear and gave Harry a once over.
"Fine," Malfoy huffed, "she made me design a tattoo for her, then made me get one myself and then I was hooked I guess. Also, elaborate? Potter, that's such a big word I'm surprised you used it properly." Harry snorted.
"Should I warn Ginny that you're giving a room to Malfoy and kissing him on the cheek? I reckon that's something your girlfriend should know." He said as they walked to the apparation point. Luna smiled again, with a dreamy look on her face.
) so Draco told Luna of his predicament, and she had immediately apparated into his flat. She took one look around and told him that he could stay with her until he got back on his feet.
, and dressed like one. He had worn a green flannel shirt, unbuttoned with a white t-shirt underneath and jeans, his sleeves were rolled up and Draco had to stop himself from becoming absorbed in the sight of
After the war and the trials, Draco Malfoy left wizarding society- to the best of his ability. He had tea with his mother every Thursday, and wrote to Pansy, Blaise, and Luna every week.
He woke up late. About 2 hours Later than his usual 7am standard. Scoffing slightly. Lovely. Now he needed to hurry up. He freshened up, finally taking his well deserved shower, dressing up into something clean and setting everything up he needed for the spells. There was one spell that would leave him be able to detect Potters magic for a while. But he needed something that connected them.. thank the old Norse gods for his blessed Bird. Who had bitten the both of them, drawing blood.
After a few moments of silence Malfoy opened his mouth. “I….” he seemed at bit of a loss. “I agree. I didn’t think you would be willing to allow them. The Malfoy name isn’t exactly good nowadays…” He looked at his drink. Wishing he had poured more than half/half. “What about Ginevra?” he asked, trying not to let his insecurities shine through.
“I know. I really hope Mormor can find out where I messed up. I’m sad to leave you behind like this.” He was offered a kind but worried smile. Helve’s grandmother had insisted he called her his granny too, in Norwegian of course. She found Miss Olsen or just Annie too correct. Besides after hearing Draco never knew his grandmother.. she became his too. not taking no for an answer at all.
By the time he came by it was noon. 3pm to be exact. Shakily he sat up. At least he wasn’t dead. Though he didn’t feel too far off it. He hadn’t thrown up, but he had some spots on his face, oxygen deprivation. His eyes were red and he looked like he hadn’t slept in 8 weeks. the stains of tears still on his cheeks. Groaning he picked himself up. Ordering some food to be brought into his room. Not feeling ready to go outside and search potters Magic out.
Harry spent his Saturday finishing up some Charms homework with Ron, and playing a few rounds of wizard chess, which Harry lost spectacularly at. Around mid-afternoon, Hermione joined them and they pick their way down the rough path to Hagrid’s hut.
“Nothing better happen to it.” warned Harry, and Draco smirked but pledged nothing would befall it before leaving the common room. It was still quite nice out; the sun had not yet begin to sink, and there was still some trace of warmth in the air.
Draco turned around and saw Theo, leaning beside him at the bar. For the past hour he’d been skulking on the outskirts of the club, trying to stay out of people’s way. Also to avoid Harry, and Theo. Harry because he didn’t want to fuck up any more, and Theo because Theo.. Theo was still looking at him like he’d done in sixth year, and Draco didn’t like him like that anymore.
“They should have dinner ready by now,” said Hermione, carefully marking her book and stowing it in her bag. She stood and so did Ron, and Draco tried subtly to follow them out.
Draco’s left forearm was exposed, but there was no Dark Mark. Only a large, shiny burn scar lay on his pale skin. Harry gazed at it, transfixed and a little shocked. Draco suddenly lifted his head from his writing and looked from Harry to his scar, his eyes suddenly unreadable.
“What’s on your mind?” asked Daphne conversationally, and Harry smiled wryly, his gaze snagging on Draco walking ahead of them, chatting with Simon in rapid French, the words indistinct but filled with smooth sounds.
“I’m not having a last hurrah hookup, Theo.” Draco said firmly. “I don’t like you like that anymore.” He walked back to the main room without waiting for Theo’s reply.
“That’s us,” he said, his finger on the pairs of footprints adjacent to each other in the eighth year boys dorm.
Twenty minutes later, when Ron and Draco were having an enthusiastic bickering match over Quidditch, while trying to also do Ron’s homework (it was very amusing) Hermione came over and sat beside Harry.
“And a necklace?” said Harry, smiling slightly bemusedly. Draco grinned, unfolding his long legs and flopping down onto Harry’s bed next to him.
The next morning they were spooning again, when Harry’s wand-alarm rang for fifteen minutes before classes started. Harry sat up, reluctant to leave the warmth of the blankets and Draco, but it wasn’t like time would wait for them.
Harry glanced over at Draco next to him, who was writing neatly and concisely and biting his lip in concentration. His notes were at a stark contrast to Harry’s messy, meandering scrawl. He always found it difficult to take notes when the teacher was talking; often he wrote too slow and couldn’t catch up, or couldn’t remember the whole sentence he was supposed to be writing.
“You must tell us all about it,” exclaimed Hermione. She held up a napkin-wrapped package that Harry had not noticed previously. “We stopped by the Great Hall to get food so we could all go to the common room.”
“Hello, Luna, Draco.” he greeted, and they both smiled at him. Harry thought Draco looked rather calmer than he usually was; he supposed Luna’s gentle ways had rubbed off on him a bit.
“We found Theo, here isn’t that crazy?” exclaimed Daphne, exchanging a smile with the boy, who Harry now recognized as Theodore Nott, who’d moved to France after the war.
Harry watched with everyone else, glad to have the attention off of him for a moment. After “Trenton, William - RAVENCLAW!”, McGonagall rose from her seat at the center of the staff table and touched her spoon to her glass, and the students quiet.
“It’ll be dark soon, and our room is kind of far. Maybe skip the coats for one night.” replied Harry regretfully. It was getting colder every day, although there had been no sign of snow yet. Draco frowned.
“Alright.” answered Malfoy, still sounding a little surly. He muttered the spell and his wand lit up, and Harry could now see the proper path to the castle and followed it. Malfoy’s cheeks were red, and he blew his hair out of his face as Harry carried him, not meeting Harry’s eyes. “I could’ve walked up by myself, you know.” he announced, and Harry chuckled.
Draco sighed as he filed out behind the other students from his Ancient Runes class. He’d barely had the focus to jot down the homework, much less take notes. He’d have to borrow Hermione’s tonight, as they were both in the same course but not the same class, regretfully.
That was certainly… a more, well, special moment, than just randomly. Harry didn’t think Draco was one for caring about grand romantic gestures, but in Harry’s mind the reveal plan was just as important as the outcome.
“Right,” replied Harry woozily, and they finally left and strolled down to the dining hall. The whole way there, the only thing on Harry’s mind was Draco, and how soon he could kiss him again. It was driving him wild.
Draco’s lips parted and Harry ran his tongue along his bottom lip. He still tasted like mint, just like in his dream. Draco was arching up off the the ground, pressing against him, and Harry could still feel Draco’s heartbeat, reverberating through his own chest.
“Potter, Malfoy, welcome back.” said Headmistress McGonagall, striding over to them in her pointed witch’s hat. Harry greeted her, and Draco murmured a hello. “You all are exempt from morning classes, go ahead to your common room. Your things are already in your dorms. You will be expected at afternoon classes.” she continued, and they nodded before leaving the Great Hall with a few other exchange students.
“You really hated that, didn’t you?” Draco replied, smirking. Harry shook his head with a sigh and they turned a corner towards the ballroom, the faint sounds of music beginning to reach Harry’s ears.
They flew slowly to the ground, where Harry released his grip on Draco and Draco stumbled as he took a few shaky steps, sinking onto the grass.
“Nothing.” answered Potter, raising his eyebrows slightly. Draco turned away and glared at the wall.
Daphne stepped daintily into the sooty fireplace and took a handful of powder. “Beauxbatons,” she said confidently, throwing the powder down, and there was a flare of green flames and she was gone. Harry’s heart jumped to his throat.
“It’s great.” replied Harry firmly, and Draco grinned almost shyly, not meeting Harry’s eyes. They stayed up and talked a little while longer, about their trip tomorrow, before finally going to sleep, and Harry’s final thought before drifting off was of the fiery tattoo, and how glad he was that Draco could cover something he despised with something he loved.
“Yeah.” Draco said softly. They stood in an easy silence for a little while longer, watching the paintbrush strokes of color across the sky, before Harry turned and took Draco’s hand, and they left the Owlery.
“Have you been down here a lot?” questioned Draco. Harry seemed quite familiar with the room and the house-elves.
“It’s a smartphone. Powered by batteries and electricity, though I power mine with magic when I need it. Muggles use them to talk to each other and lots of other things.” A smartphone. Interesting. I suppose they have to invent things like this, thought Draco, since they don’t have Floo Powder or owl post like wizards do. Granger tapped and tapped,
But not unfamiliar. After all, if he thought about it the outcome of the war had depended on him, partly. If he had truly died that day when Voldemort had killed the piece of his soul that lived in Harry, countless more people would have died in Voldemort’s dark reign because of it.
Draco finally relaxed and leaned back against him, the crown of his head just under Harry’s chin. “Definitely wait,” he decided. “I want to see their faces.” Harry grinned.
He knew his return to Hogwarts would not be pleasant. He knew he would be hated, and whispered about. But he was already used to that. Plenty of it had occurred this summer whenever he had needed to leave the house. It didn’t help that he had to have Aurors accompany him everywhere he went.
A few minutes later Amelie reappeared and dragged him onto the dance floor, which he smiled begrudgingly at, but let her. Harry was still apprehensive about dancing, as he knew he was rubbish at it, so he mostly watched everyone else dance, leaning on a wall. Daphne was dancing with Nott, Simon was spinning Amelie around, and Camille was
“Dunno,” Draco replies, and Harry hides a smile but he knows Draco’s eyes caught it anyway. Draco always spoke so eloquently. Whenever he used words like “dunno” Harry knew Draco was teasing him.
Harry broke the kiss and pressed his forehead against Draco’s so that they almost shared breaths. His hands were still stroking slowly up and down Draco’s sides, making his brain go fuzzy.
And now they were again ensconced in their dorm, Harry having persuaded Draco (it had taken a while) to let him practice braiding Draco’s hair again.
“Expecto Patronum,” he said clearly, and the silvery, translucent light that Harry knew so well streamed from the point of Draco’s wand. It wasn’t forming a shield this time, nor just insubstantial wisps of magic, it looked to be actually weaving into the shape of Draco’s patronus. Harry grinned, glad for Draco. He’d been so frustrated about not getting it.
“Are they dating or something?” asked Harry vaguely, still watching Daphne and Malfoy, who appeared to be being scolded by the blond girl.
“I know,” Harry said, his hands rubbing comforting circles on Draco’s back. Draco pressed his brow into Harry’s shoulder, feeling a little calmer now. They stayed like that, wrapped around each other, before Draco raised his head again, frowning at Harry’s robes.
Draco nodded, stepping back to give Harry some space. “No problem. Will you be alright to Floo?” Harry was dimly aware of McGonagall and a few other teachers standing around them. He imagined being swallowed by that green light and he mutely shook his head.
It was quite a nice room, thought Harry. Painted in shades of blue and white, like most everything here. One window, in between the two beds, which were without the curtains that Hogwarts beds had. Two small bedside tables, two desks with indentations for inkpots, and a bathroom.
“Yeah, alright.” he responded amicably, and they walked in an easy silence toward one of the doors that would let them out into the gardens. Harry caught Draco eyeing him a couple of times.
“Alright,” he agreed casually, but planned to show up prepared. Draco Malfoy does not have things sprung on him.
“See for yourself.” he says, and hands Harry the small notebook that he’d been so curious about. Harry glances at him curiously before flipping to a random page. There’s poetry. Another page. A small but detailed sketch of the castle, another of the courtyard. And on the next page, two words written over and over.
“Alright, now we just let it simmer and stir. Can you stir?” he asked Harry in a tired voice, and Harry nodded. “Counter clockwise ten times, then clockwise ten until it turns pearly-colored. I’ll tell you when,” he instructed.
He was awoken by a violent sneeze from Harry the next morning, and blearily pushed himself into a sitting position.
The four of them walked up to the common room, and Draco exchanged an amused look with Harry. Hermione was walking in between them, and Ron on Harry’s other side, so they weren’t joined together by the hand anymore, but knowing Draco, he was planning a showy moment to reveal their relationship. Harry chuckled to himself.
Daphne nodded. “Good,” she said. “And yes, I think he’d like the star-gazing. Merlin knows he’s not especially looking forward to this ball, anyways. You didn’t hear any of this from me.” Harry smiled weakly, his head still spinning with new realizations.
“Hey, Hermione, Harry, why are you- oh.” All three of them look round at the portrait hole, where Weasley had just stepped into the common room. His eyes narrow a bit at the sight of Draco, and Draco subtly grabbed his wand. He didn’t need a repeat of Finnegan.
Draco sat back in his chair to ponder all this and there’s a pause. Granger watched him, and he can see in her eyes that she’s waiting for him to insult her, or Muggles. He would expect it of himself, honestly. But things have changed.
“Whatever, Potter.” said Draco, rolling his eyes and getting up. But he smiled when Harry took hold of his hand and pulled him back down for another kiss.
“Excuse me? Harry?” came a small, high-pitched voice from behind him. Harry turned around and saw the kids from before, a Gryffindor boy and girl. “Could-could I get your autograph?”
Harry felt a small wave of relief that Draco was acknowledging it, and tightened his arms around Draco briefly, letting him know he’s there for him.
“That wasn’t my fault,” said Harry exasperatedly, nudging Draco over so he could sit down next to him on the sofa. “Blame Ginny.”
Draco rolled his eyes at that last comment. “We’ll see.” They reach the revolving griffin staircase and pinned on the wall next to it, just as promised, is the list. Daphne took out a quill and they wrote their names in the first two spots.
Harry pulled back and looked at him for a moment, his hands still caressing Draco’s skin. He whispered something in a wondrous tone, but it was a soft, sibilant noise. A smooth hissing, the whispers of which seemed to wrap around Draco, and he shivered, entranced.
“Hey.” Draco looked up to see Harry, leaning against the next column with his hair wonderfully ruffled and messy.
“You were taking so long, I thought I’d come and help you out.” Harry said smoothly, grinning. Merlin. I’m going to murder my boyfriend, thought Draco in exasperation. He should have known Harry would want to do something like this. He supposed he was at least glad that Harry wasn’t quite dumb enough to kiss him in front of all the eighth years.
At the beginning of the summer he had been invited to stay with the Weasley’s. As much as he normally loved spending time at the Burrow, playing Quidditch with Ron and Ginny in the back field, and enjoying Molly Weasley’s cooking; Harry had known that he did not want to burden the grieving family, as much as they protested it would be welcome. He had thought it best to leave them be for the summer, although he still had sent letters to Ron.
“What do you want, Theo?” Draco asked, the fuzziness in his head making him blunt, not at all the suave, subtle tone he usually had. He stared at the other boy, his gaze catching on Theo’s inky hair. Remembered it’s softness between his fingers. He tore his gaze away and stared at the floor.
He had almost forgotten that he would have to be back with the whole bloody pack of Gryffindors this year. Draco huffed and closed his eyes, somewhat annoyed with himself that he, for lack of a better way to put it, ran away. He can see Potter’s messy dark hair in his mind. It reminded him of someone else’s dark hair, the one person he missed.
“There are only ten spots open. To sign up you must put your name down. The sheet will be outside my office starting tomorrow morning. Now, this trip is only available for the eighth years. On October first, those going will take a Floo fire to Beauxbatons. You will return on February first.”
“Alright. Thank you, Headmistress.” It was slightly embarrassing, thought Harry, having his teacher Apparate him, but the alternative was Floo and Harry couldn’t do that. It almost reminded him of Apparating with Dumbledore, back in sixth year. He smiled a little at the memory of Dumbledore and McGonagall put a hand on his shoulder. Soon Harry felt the gut-wrenching twist of Apparation and his vision whirled, until they rematerialized at Beauxbatons.
Draco thanked her and she left to tend to someone else. Why had Potter brought him in? He frowned as he swung his legs off the bed. Maybe he’d ask Daphne later. It’s not like he could ask Potter, or wanted to, but he was still curious.
watched, following the lines, until Draco lowered his arm. They lay in peaceful silence, until Draco sat up with a yelp.
“Yes, ever since I can remember. He used to play with me when I was very young, and Mother and Father had to go to events and things. Not so much after, though. Father stopped it. He said it wasn’t becoming of the Malfoy heir to hang around with common house-elves, and that was that.” Draco said it very matter-of-factly, and Harry felt angry at Lucius Malfoy, for saying such a thing. “You used to spend the holidays with Weasley and his family, right?” continued Draco, and now Harry was the one to smile and reminisce.
Harry and Amelie went down to the dining hall for lunch twenty minutes later. Harry could see Camille, Simon, Draco, and Daphne all sitting nearby, and he and Amelie strolled
“My name is Maya, and I don’t like pizza.” she declared loudly, before sitting back down. Harry had to stop himself from smiling too much. He loved working with the little kids.
Draco laughed, catching the paper in one hand deftly and tossing it aside. I hope the presents we sent off got there in time, he thought. They’d sent their presents for Weasley and Hermione back with the letter, and then enlisted other owls to carry other presents back to London the other day. He’d received most of his presents from his friends back at Hogwarts, and from his mother, the day before, so he could open them today.
As they keep talking and bickering, Harry’s surprised to find that he likes hanging out with Malfoy when he’s like this. He felt like someone Harry could be friends with- he’s funny when he wants to be, as smart as Hermione, and he talked a lot, also like Hermione.
“I don’t have it.” insisted Harry, doing a bad job of hiding his grin. “Honest.” Draco glared at him, crossing his arms.
“Look, a phoenix feather. Must be from Fawkes. McGonagall said he was still at Hogwarts.” Harry held up a red feather, and Draco coughed. He’d almost forgotten about what happened yesterday.
“Why not?” asked Harry, seemingly confused, and Draco rolled his eyes from where he was sitting at his desk finishing a Transfiguration essay. He set down his quill carefully before replying.
“Seating chart on the wall, everyone.” called the professor at the front of the classroom, and Draco blinked in surprise. They’ve never had seating charts before. He strolled over to the piece of parchment on the wall and scanned it for his name. It’s next to Potter’s. He scoffed softly and eyed the back of Potter’s head. Daphne’s already walking to her seat beside some seventh year Ravenclaw.
Harry felt the solid weight of Draco’s hands on his shoulders, and he let his breathing slow down before he raised his shaky gaze to meet the blond’s cool grey eyes.
“Where is it?” Draco lifted his wand, and caused a beam of light to run out of it. He used it like a pointer, going from one star to the next in graceful lines and swoops. Harry
“How did you do that? Counter the effects?” she asked, and Draco immediately began explaining to her, seemingly glad to get away from the previous topic. Harry glanced at Daphne, and saw that she was looking at him, too.
Hermione had been able to get in. only to tell Harry it wasn’t looking good. Draco had become paranoid, badly. There had been a strange bruising around his arms where the bands were. But he didn’t want to go in on it. Hermione had tried to talk it through with him. But he didn’t seem open to any kind of help and after she discussed the manners she had been allowed in for. He had kindly urged her to leave him be again.
So when he finally returned that night, after a dinner with Astoria and Ollie, to a cold empty house… he finally let his emotions out. He plopped onto the floor after putting on the fire. Hugging his knees to his chest. His head on them. Fuck… he felt so alone.. now what. No Scorpius, No Astoria,  no one. He didn’t cry. He just panicked in silence for a while. Let his mind go over the stuff. Eventually his body became less tense. So he went over the other events of the day… he’s seen some of his old friends. And his old enemies.. potter… Should he write Potter perhaps? It had come up in therapy. Why not write the guy you bullied. Say you’re sorry. Talk it out, express your regrets and perhaps stop beating yourself up over the guilt? He should.. one day, when he learned to be less awkward when encountering anyone he had done wrong in the past. Who knows.. maybe he should send a letter like that one day. But not today. Not tomorrow either. Right now he had to get his stuff back together
He stood next to his wife, Ginny. Another Weasley that most definitely could drink his blood. The one time he did have to go to the healers after the hunters had found him and almost hexed him to death. She had refused to help him. It had taken him yelling at her to just end it then to make her help him. Out of pure spite she had lifted the curses and tended to the worst of the wounds, stitching them without any numbing while hissing about how she would make sure he’d have to live out his miserable life knowing what he did before kicking him back out of the hospital.
“Well then… that was surprisingly nice, for hanging out with Gryffendors.”Malfoy smirked as Harry helped him onto the sofa where he curled himself up and summoned a blanket.
“Fine, Malfoy. Let Harry do your hair. Same as his. You gotta leave it till the end of the game.” Draco pulled a face that could only be described as horrid. “I.. no that is to cruel. I’ll take the glass of water.”
“you’re a dork love. My dork. You two should come over for dinner some time. Catch up.” Dean smiled.
“I’ll find a hotel for the night. Owl me if you find anything.” He grumbled, apperating before they could go against him.
By the time harry finished his little story Draco was already onto the next thing he had complaints about. “Potter I heard you were literally stalking me. That is obsessed. Look it up in the dictionary. Picture of your dumb head right there.” He grumbled. “Sure Malfoy.”
“Bittles is fine, his instability could make him too harsh on the hands and we wouldn’t want her to hurt.” Draco smiled at them.
So he made his way back, getting to his room and flopping down onto the bed inhaling deeply. What was he even doing here? Finding Harry potter because his friends were useless at it? Why.. I mean the guy wasn’t too bad. He seemed to be one of the few people that could deal with Draco. Someone that actually understood how the war affected those deeply evolved in it. They had been on opposite sides. Harry being the savior. Malfoy being Voldemort’s Golden boy, his ticket into Hogwarts and .. the one meant to die a sacrifice in order to take Harry down. He owed Snape so much.
“I guess she does but listen Malfoy. Even if Ginny is going to tell you what’s up. Harry is just like this. If he doesn’t want to be found. You ain’t gonna find him. He’s more illusive than some criminals, I would know. He’ll come back in a few days and it’ll be alright.” Ron said, grumbling as he put his fork to rest. Knowing this might take a while.
Over dinner they had some small talk. Talking about the kids. Harry commenting about how Astoria was missing and Draco admitting she had moved on from him. They were only together for their son. Harry admitting he and Ginny weren’t too close anymore either and hadn’t been for years.
Surprisingly, Malfoy answered first. “Pretty good after the Potion you two provided. I feel slightly less of a wreck. Aftertaste was horrible however. Ad some ginger next time… Lovegood. Jam please.” He hummed. Luna passed it to him. Smiling friendly. Harry had been there when even Luna had taken the stance for Malfoy. Claiming he had brought her food and care while she was being held hostage. There wasn’t bad blood between them.
Next was Pansy who let Ron paint her nails, he did a bloody awful job and she glared him down. Hermoine told them the longest she had ever spend on an essay on end was 8 hours straight before she passed out and collapsed.
{ this is a short filler chapter. i sadly havent felt as motivated to continue on this story. I will try to update you as soon as possible}
Walking through Diagon didn’t get him much further. No visible trace of potter. After about 2 hours of finding no trace. Malfoy decided it might be time for some desperate measures, in the morning though. Tonight had been stressful enough.
Harry sighed softly. “Albus befriended his son Scorpius. He wasn’t sure me n Gins would be ok with that. I assured him all was good. Did you know he can actually cook?” he saw his friends expressions go from surprised to shocked, making him chuckle. “Don’t worry about it really.”
Harry was the first to reach the hall. The breakfast was just disappearing and most students had left to grab their stuff for their field trip. He was greeted by Albus who was, to Harry’s surprise smiling. “Its good to see you dad.. I am er… glad to see you alive and well and stuff.” He said, rubbing his arms a little. He looked like his dad, minus the glasses he was an exact copy. But Albus was mellow, calm. He looked a bit bored with life. Which was a great contrast to the boy practically jumping up and down behind him. Blonde, almost white hair, smiling bright and holding out a hand.
Draco was quite surprised when a small witch approached him. “Malfoy? Oh Merlin I barely recognize you.. Look mate I erm… I’m glad you’re here. I just want you to know that me, and the pair of dumbasses over there…” she pointed to a small group, one of whom Draco recognized as an old Hufflepuf. “We forgive you. The war was hard on us all. You did what you had to to survive, like we all did.” She said, looking dead serious.
They agreed to go to dinner with Seamus and Dean jus a few days later. Dressing up in some semiformal attire, mostly because Malfoy refused to wear jeans and denied Harry his right to. They already felt and looked loads better. The bands around Malfoy’s arms were only a little tight. He had full access to his magic again and he was getting the sleep he needed to function like a decent person.
After the dinner with Potter going quite well, Draco decided that it might be time to contact his old friends Pansy and Blaise. Not Goyle. He’d heard of Gregory, a lot more than he’d like. Last time being on the front page of the Daily Prophet for being wanted. Rumors were being spread about Goyle trying to restart some of what the dark lord had left behind. It was said he was gathering crowds of ex and new members in the underground trying to restore the pure bloodlines.
“So Pansy… I heard you were working in Egypt on muggle artifacts? What’s that like?” Neville asked. And before Harry knew it everyone was chattering about work. That was until Hermoine stood up, smiling with her business smile.
Skadi seemed fine with whatever. She hadn’t bitten him since the first time and truth be told. Draco had grown very attached to her over the past few weeks. she was quite the personality to have around. seemingly understanding his every word and trouble. She had taken to bringing him “Gifts” when Draco had a bad day. Gifts  consisting of twigs, stones, the cap of an old beer. Worthless. But she insisted he appreciate it and applauds her for her great sacrifices.
Once at the Inn and getting the first glares from whomever heard his name being called. He headed into his room. “What am I doing to myself. I’m not welcome here. I shouldn’t be here” he grumbled. Plopping on his bed. Skadi cawed in response. “You’re right. I’m here for a reason. I need to get my life back together. Good bird.” He snorted. The dinner was planned for later tonight. He might as well take a little nap before getting ready right?
“Nah nah.. its fine, I don’t mind staying with you.” Harry gave him a dorky smile, Draco snorted in return. “Go freshen up Potter, You smell worse than me. I’ll meet you in the castle. I’m sure Scorp is excited to meet you. He’s a big history and potter fan. Do not disappoint him.”  Harry nodded.
“They’re quite well off aren’t they? Having their lives together so well.” Harry commented, looking at the well and beautifully decorated room they found themselves in.
New guy turned to harry as he got up. “You really thought I was going to let you be saved Harry? Foolish.” He smirked, Harry finally saw his face. He was scarred up, the whole right side of his face looked like what he could only describe as if it had been boiled off with scorching hot oil and never quite healed. He was missing an eye and appeared to have a prosthetic leg. Which explained the slight limb.  Somewhere it still was a familiar face. He recognized it.
“You’re fine. I enjoy your company twat. But since you are here anyway. Seamus and Dean send us a letter. Well they send it to me, asking when we would like to come around for dinner so they could plan it all out.”
Potter smiled. “Of course I mean it. Draco Malfoy, I hang out with you willingly. You yet again saved my life and are still trying to in your own dumb way. We are friends yes, as ridiculous of a pair as we are.”
Even is magic was reaching out. It had been years since Harry had used wandless magic. It seemed stronger than ever. He heard the rumbling downstairs. New guy was cursing as he rushed down too, before he could even reach the door the hardwood table flew in his direction, splintering against his back. He dropped to the ground, knocked out. Others threw spells at him, he blocked them, threw them back. He couldn’t see what was happening. He just heard the screams of someone being hit with their own Crucio and someone rushing up the stairs.
Harry stood up, putting a hand on her shoulder. “Ginny I’m… I’m sorry. I didn’t know how much I’ve been hurting you.. I didn’t realise I was hurting the kids with my work. You know what I’ll stay home. I’ll find something like an office job and I’ll be home more.” he said it softly, trying to calm her down a little. “I’ll do better. I Promise.”
“Harry you hated him your whole time at school and now telling me you and Malfoy are having cozy dinners at his place chatting about the kids.”
He heard a bunch of chattering approaching. Potter and his fan club. Draco snorted. “Enjoying yourself there Potter?” He asked, getting glares from their old classmates and their spouse.
“You were absolutely horrible Draco. You were friendly with Hermoine. You even.. you dared sitting next to me.” Harry snorted.
Draco nudged Harry under the table, startling him. He held up two fingers to his face. Harry snorted. “I need some air. I’m gonna catch a quick smoke. You Joining?” Harry said, loud enough for the others to hear. Was this how they were now? Did they have little signals for when they needed a break? Harry couldn’t say he minded.
Harry noticed, putting his arm against Malfoy to try and calm him down a little. Dean didn’t seem to notice, or care that much. Seamus had hopped in to greet them really quick. Wearing the ugliest apron earth with the text
The dogs, named Cherry and Peaches, seemed to pick up on Draco’s uneasiness about them. curiously checking him out. This resulted in Malfoy almost losing all his composure as he leaned into Potters touch. Eventually Harry asked if the dogs could be taken away because allergies. Muttering an you owe me to Draco. Who seemed to be able to breathe again. He wasn’t a big fan of dog. He had ran into Fluffy, Hagrid’s hell beast once.. never trusted a dog since.
“Anywhere he could’ve gone too or are the both of you, even you Granger utterly useless at finding your supposed best friend?”
Whatever had spelled him. It was coming closer. Harry had stopped feeling curses hitting him about an hour or so ago. Each beat of his heart felt heavier, slower. Whatever was reaching out to him.. he was grasping at it. Reaching out. Begging it to please stay with him.
When Harry returned his gaze to Ron and hermoine, he was met with wide eyes and Ron’s mouth hanging open.
{ another authors note, fun I know. So I plan on using norse mythology throughout the story. It takes a bit of explaining sometimes. Let me know if there’s too much describing and to little plot and story.
“Indeed, it’s pretty but homey.” Draco hummed in reply, his eyes running over the well filled book case surrounding the fireplace. Recognizing some books.  “Not everyone ended up as wrecked as us. That’s nice to see at least.” He added
“Whatever I did went so horribly wrong. They enhance my magic at night, which might explain why we can’t sleep. They should have been able to slide off when I found you. But something happened and the only reason I haven’t … lost my arms is because being closer to you loosens them slightly. Keeps them from tightening.”
That.. well that went a lot better than Harry had expected. He’d expected rage and a whole lot more awkwardness. Not a Mellow Draco thanking him for staying with him. He quickly went to get his shower, thanking merlin for there being no one else around them, he wasn’t spotted in the halls.
“Draco I swear to god if you do not let go of that fucking snitch your ass is grass and I’m gonna mow it. You made us crash.”
They counted down and grabbed the key, arriving at the very familiar train they used to take as kids. The train Draco had taken.. maybe once? Twice willingly. The other times he had jobs to do. He froze but got dragged in by the others. It was a 3 hour ride and he already regretted agreeing to go. Sighing he sat down in whatever cabin he came across first, not really being willing to go to the good ole Slytherin cabin he and his friends used to sit in, remembering full well he had kicked Harry’s nose in, hoping to make him return home and not face the horrible things the dark lord wanted him to do that year. It of course hadn’t worked because Potter had , bloodied and all, joined the table either way.
“I mean it was to be expected. Living in England was hell just after the war and you took quite the hit despite Po…. Is that Potter and his gang?” Pansy leaned back to look over Blaise’s shoulder. “Oh my it is. Don’t look.”
Malfoy laughed. “They have. Granger has, she’s kicking her husband under the table. Look away.” He hummed, taking another sip unbothered.
It had taken them 2 years of counselling and another baby to fix their marriage somewhat. And now Harry was just simply travelling the world. Usually home for about a week or two weeks to spend with his children and play the good happy dad he knew he wasn’t. At least the traveling he did for work brought him some fulfillment. Seeing every part of the world. Helping people out of their misery  by ridding of deep and dark curses.
He was doing quite well. Despite being alone. He had taken it upon himself to do groceries in town more often. Grant himself the luxury of buying some local goods, speak to the townspeople and make some connections. He didn’t have too many friends left. Pansy lived far away and had a busy life after all. A lot of the others were missing, dead or in jail. Sometimes he held a diner with some of the muggles here. They were kind but hardworking people. They didn’t understand why a snob like him had gone to live in such a remote place, not all of them were open to conversation but those who were. Had grown onto him. Maybe he should organize another diner soon. He had the supplies for it and even with the littlest bit of magic he should manage.
Now please do remember that you do not owe me. In any way. Do not attempt to repay me. Keep away. The binding spell should lift soon.
“Tell my Son that. When Scorpius sends me an unformal letter AND makes Skadi fly right back. There is something wrong. He is upset and I cannot stand for Potter making my son upset.”
Malfoy smiled softly.  “In that case, please do feel free to come by when you wish. I do not care if you bring your friends along and use my living room if you do not feel like talking to me. Anything is fine. The closer we are the better.” He said making harry snort.
Draco watched for a few minutes, walking up to Harry, placing a letter he had written earlier on the little bedside desk. Before looking around, making sure no one saw. “it’s for the best Potter” he whispered, running his fingers over the others jaw before leaving him.
“Sure Gins, sorry wasn’t looking at the time. Sleep well love.” He uttered, quickly closing the door.
“We seem to get around fine now don’t we. I think it’s about time we try and break the stereotype. I’m with you Hermoine.” Harry stated.
But finding Malfoy turned out to be harder than he had expected. While Harry had been to his house several times. He didn’t exactly know his address. And when he did find it eventually. It was so incredibly warded he couldn’t get in.
“Well go on then. What happened, I haven’t got all day to spend sipping tea with you.” He asked, tapping his foot lightly, the place had changed, last time he was here, it had been cold, empty and most of all dark. There was no cute lights, the chandeliers weren’t home to every house spider species in great Britain anymore. It was much cozier with actual furniture. And without the looming presence of the dark lord forcing your mother to show him around the house and show him that the place was actually empty while holding his want to your throat. Leaving a deep cut either way while your father just watched you in disgust.
The sound of wings rapidly approaching. Skadi cawing loudly as he held his arm out. The raven landing on it. She was panting, it was clear she’d flown as she could. She had been send with Draco’s latest letter and gifts to Scorpius as they had decided Daisy was maybe a bit too old.. Only a day ago. She must have returned right away.. with an urgent matter.
Draco had seen her. Spoken to her. She said she had an idea but she would look into it. For now she advised to move closer to avoid his core from taking too much damage. She also gave him a small red pouch and note with a plea to the Valkyrie Eir. Asking for her healing and protection. He gratefully took it from her and thanked her.
“That was a secret boy.” Draco laughed, surprising Harry. He hadn’t expected Draco to be so friendly and… great with kids? Even if it was at his cost.
“Sure Malfoy.” Harry snorted, it was just getting amusing at this point. Why did this aggravate him so much back then? Who knows.
“Sure, so whenever you see the right foot go forward you stand in the stirrup, work from your knees, not your ankles, keep those still, when you’re ready, give her a bit of pressure with your heels.”
Hogwarts looked different. It had repaired itself after the war. There were new stone guards. More of them. the bridge had been rebuild and looked far sturdier than its wooden ancestor. There seemed to be more towers. And overall.. the building looked far more welcoming, though Draco would be the last to admit that part. The friendly warm light from inside, the somewhat spooky decorations.. it somehow.. did feel nice to be back here.
He was surprised to say the least. A Giant raven had managed to work its way into his office, the one day he actually was at home. It was 2 am. Harry had, per standard nowadays, fallen asleep at his desk, bended over paperwork he refused to do while traveling. The raven had woken him up with a bite to the hand before screaming at him. He could’ve sworn the thing was laughing at the state of him. Grumbling he took the letter she was carrying. “This better be fucking important Bird.” He muttered, sucking on his bleeding finger. He raised a brow. Malfoy? Out of all people Malfoy was the one to send him a letter.. I mean.. the bird made sense then. A stuck up prick.
“We know Malfoy.. we tried to trace them back but they left the hideout already.. and Hogwarts has tripled its spells. Your boy is safe.” Hermione said, squeezing his hand. “you’re safe here. Nothing will happen.”
“That’s me sir, Scorpius Malfoy!” he even sounded happy. Was this really Draco’s kid? I mean it was undeniable, but my my. Big difference. Malfoy must’ve done something really well and different from his own upbringing.
