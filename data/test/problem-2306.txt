"I was out."
"Harry! How are you my boy?", called Timothy, the store owner. Draco had been working at the apothecary for the past couple of years as an extension of his potions apprenticeship with Professor Snape. He didn't need the money of course, but it looked good on his uni applications.
Draco pried her hand off of his face.
"Daddy and papa brought me. They said Brax is sick. Is he okay Harry?" Teddy asked his face forlorn.
Three Weeks Earlier...
"You bought that coffee." Harry retorted.
Narcissa hated this. She knew more than Lucius that it had not been just a fling. She had seen his empty bed at night. Been suspicious after he decided to 'move out' on his own. Noticed that Draco had never been this happy since he was a small child. How could she not? She was a mother. But, Potter was gone and had taken her grandchild with him. Her heart cried for the baby she would never see, that her son would never raise. No, that would not do. If there was even the smallest chance that this would bring Draco peace, it had to be done. For she knew her Dragon. He was stubborn, loyal and fiercely proud but also sweet and caring to those fortunate to see that side of him. He would never stop looking for Potter otherwise.
Remus gathered his cub in his arms. "Oh Harry."
"What's wrong love?" he asked worriedly.
Harry was completely sloshed and ended up with some bloke whose name he couldn't even remember who shagged him hard and fast up against a dirty stone wall. As the unknown man ripped through him, he felt like he was being fucked free from the indifference that had taken over his life. So Harry fucked him back. He held onto his hair a little harder, moaned a little louder and pretended he was with someone who loved him just so he could feel something.
Draco was horrified at the possibility. "Never. joke. about. Hufflepuffs".
"We were together until fairly recently."
It was just another day full of empty hours, empty conversations, and breathing. Nothing had meaning anymore. He was doing what he had to do. Anything to keep his mind off of Draco. So what if he was feeling sorry for himself? He was allowed that after what he'd been through. He put the tea kettle on and nibbled on a piece of toast.
"Sorry Mione. I'm just nervous is all", he mumbled.
"You dare draw your wand on me boy? You are no son of mine.", he hissed in fury.
"Where did you hear that terrible language young man? That is a very bad word."
"How is he? Is he going to be okay?", Harry asked nervously wringing his hands together. Healer Ronson chuckled.
"Can we get up now? My legs are sort of numb."
Sirius was losing his little boy and he didn't know how to stop it. He remembered the day Harry had come to them.
Harry flooed to Malfoy Manor. He stepped into the parlor with Brax who had started crying from the trip. Harry wiped a smudge of dust off Brax's quickly reddening face and tried to soothe him by rocking him back and forth.
That night, the blood adoption was performed by Dumbledore as requested in the Potter's will. Sirius would never forget looking into those gorgeous eyes as the ceremony concluded that stayed green but formed a brown ring around the edge that he knew represented him and Remus. He felt the bond as the magic surrounded them. He was a father.
Though his father would like to pretend to the public that he no longer held any of his previous prejudices, Lucius's pureblood upbringing was still in full form. It was something that could not be broken, it was a part of him just as the Dark Mark was. It was engrained in him. Expectantly he had chosen to ally the Malfoys with the Greengrasses, the second most powerful wizarding family in England.
Draco turned his body towards Harry so that he was facing him. "Harry, listen to me.", he implored.
"Um, love?"
"Sure thing Harry. I would have stopped him, but he left before I got home. He misses you, you know."
He was going to have a baby. Draco Malfoy's baby to be precise. The same Draco Malfoy who was engaged to be married.
God, Draco was gorgeous. Even more so now that Harry could see him standing up. His eyes shifted down to Draco's penis which was hard as a brick and standing at attention. It looked even better than it felt. But of course, he'd never tell Draco that. He decided to play with his boyfriend a bit.
"I told you to stop calling her that. And you wouldn't dare or else it's socks for you.", Harry snapped.
Draco finally released the pregnant traitor and took Harry's hand in his. Their eyes locked and Draco lowered himself to one knee in front of Harry. With his other hand he wandlessly accioed a small velvet box and held it out to Harry.
"I'm pregnant." The words fell out before he could stop himself.
"There's a hangover potion on the table although I DON'T THINK YOU DESERVE IT.
"That's perfectly understandable. It'll be quick. I promise." Hermione gave him her best reassuring smile. One of Hermione's greatest strengths was in her ability to remain rational and calm in any situation. Normally this wouldn't phase him, but today it was absolutely infuriating. He needed someone to panic right along with him.
"I just...argh. What if he doesn't show? What if he figures out I'm actually not worth it? He's bloody brilliant Blaise. Smart, gorgeous, kind. People like him. People don't like me and now I'm nothing. I have no money. I'm worse than a Weasley."
He could still feel the man's breath on his neck whispering to him how really gorgeous he was and how tight his arse was. When the man finally grunted and lost himself inside Harry, only then did he let himself come back down and the tears started falling. The man was rather nice about the whole thing; helping Harry floo home and even leaving his number on the nightstand which for some reason made Harry feel even worse.
"NOW!", Draco shouted at Harry. Harry flinched and mumbled something under his breath.
Her voice wobbled on the last bit and he prayed that she wouldn't start crying. Again. Hermione herself was eight months gone with her and Ron's second child. If she started in now, he didn't know if he would be able to stop himself from joining her. He felt awful about the way he handled things. In his haste to get away from Draco, he'd hurt the people who mattered the most to him. His family. The Weasleys had gone out of their minds looking for him for two weeks before he called after finally getting settled in his new apartment. When they couldn't find a trace of his magical signature anywhere in the United Kingdom they feared the worst. This was only the third time he'd flooed them in the five months since he left England. He had lied to them then and he was still lying to them now.
There was an ache in his chest that just wouldn't go away. He know he should have never told Draco to leave. At the time, he thought it was the best thing, and maybe it was. They just weren't good together. Always fighting about everything. Money, the flat, food, bills, it never ended. Perhaps he should have tried harder. Fought for their family more. No one should have been able to make him doubt what they had, but regret always comes too late.
Lucius reached out suddenly and grabbed Draco by the throat. Draco's eyes widened suddenly, a sense of deja-vu shuddering through his body as his wind pipe was closed off by intermittent twitches of Lucius's hands. He felt his father's breath creep against the side of his face.
"You do that."
"Calm down Harry. That's not what I meant. I'm merely stating that you may want to consider taking the rest of the year off. Have a rest. Figure things out. Though you must admit that being seventeen and expecting is not exactly what Lily and James would have hoped for you."
Harry swooped in front of them and hovered for a few moments to rub Thea's tiny head and reassure Brax that he would be back before he knew it. The toddler's lip had been poked out and wobbled when he realized that Harry wasn't staying. Brax grabbed at Harry's face to press a sloppy kiss against his cheek. The crowd collectively "Aww'd"; someone having cast a video charm on them for the entire stadium to see. Draco rolled his eyes. Sometimes he forgot just how much of a celebrity Harry still was as the Boy Who Lived.
"Have you seen him? Why would he want to spend the rest of his life with someone like me? I'm not even a pureblood. He would be better off without me."
He sighed and looked over at Harry who was laying on the couch not moving. If it weren't for the rhythmic movement of his chest, Draco would be sure he was dead. He brushed Harry's hair from his eyes and placed a soft kiss on his forehead.
Draco stared at the red, messy blonde haired bawling mess held up for him to see. His heart soared. That was his son. He and Harry's son that they made together. "Amazing" he mused to himself.
He picked up the chubby little baby who was kicking his legs wildly and placed him on a floor blanket surrounded by fluffy pillows. He waved his wand and a couple of small toys flew up and swirled above the baby's head dancing to various children's melodies to keep him entertained.
And well, he wasn't wrong.
"Oh Draco, you look absolutely dreadful. Must be awfully hard with a new baby and all. How are you coping?, she asked cupping his cheek affectionately with one gloved hand.
"Draco calm down."
Harry kicked Draco who landed on the floor with a loud thud. Harry rushed to the Floo.
"St. Mungo's", he yelled and stepped through with the sick infant; Draco following not far behind.
"This is no threat Draco. I can and I
"Easy. I'll rent a...what do the Muggles call it again? Ah yes, a forklift"
He stared at Harry and himself lying in bed. He floated above the two of them, smiling. Back then, things were easy. They were so peaceful, so in love, limbs tangled in a tight embrace as if they were the only two people left in the world. He wondered if he would ever have that naive innocence again. Draco snapped to attention when he realized that something was terribly wrong. The memory began to melt away, the scene before him dissolving into nothingness. He couldn't recall what he had just been looking at before being pulled away. He came to rest again, his mind was rattled, but he intently watched the scene before him.
"He's my dad. That's what they do." Harry said shrugging.
He looked up again only to see Shacklebolt staring at him intensely.
Turmoil at the thought of the man with emerald eyes and messy black hair that stubbornly refused to be tamed despite Draco's endless attempts to set it right with potions, spells and hair care products. The thought that he would quickly trade her soft body for a hard one, her pouty lips, for incredibly thin, but inexplicably soft ones, her smooth creamy skin for scarred tanned skin that held the pain and memories of a man who had experienced too much heartbreak for one lifetime. Scars that mirrored his own. He would trade it all for a totally illogical and nonsensical match. For one Harry James Potter.
"Yes." Harry whispered.
"Yes really. It was supposed to be a secret. Our families weren't very cordial and I was promised to your mother whom I came to love very much. Don't misunderstand me, but this was different. We even discussed running away together and moving to a Muggle neighborhood."
Harry gasped and quickly moved off, apologizing profusely. Draco waved him off, wincing at the pinching feeling of blood flow returning to legs. He pushed himself up and held his hand out to Harry. "Come on. I have something to show you." Harry smiled and took the offered hand, finding himself pulled flush against Draco's chest before apparating away in a swirl of magic.
"You are. I had Kreacher pack your bags. Everything should be there."
Sirius glared at Harry making him shrink under his father's gaze. "This baby is going up for adoption."
"Of course we are. We're completely off our nut. Quite insane really... but I think we can do this."
Dumbledore sighed and folded his hands in front of him on the desk. "Harry you are an excellent student. Not only are you the Boy Who Lived, but you are the Quidditch captain for Gryffindor and very popular among the houses. You have a lot of people admiring you and I don't believe that it's best that you remain in school and influence the others with your questionable choices."
An all consuming love that makes your knees go weak and your mouth go dry. The life changing love that makes you want to be a better person just to feel worthy of the gift you've been given. Where you carry that person with you in your heart wherever you go because life without them is not only not worth living, but unimaginable. And you know that if even you searched the earth a million times over, you'll never find another best friend, a sometimes enemy, a lover, someone to laugh with, someone to yell at, someone to be yourself with, someone to share your life with.
"Leave the man be Mione. He said he was sorry a million times.", Ron said, sending Harry a reassuring wink.
"What was that?", Draco asked moving closer until he was directly in Harry's face.
"Potter.", a booming voice called.
"Harry you look great! How are you? We miss you so much. Mum wants to see you. She wants to take you shopping.", Ginny said chattering away. Harry and Ron exchanged a grimacing look. Mrs. Weasley was a maniac when it came to babies. She had seven for Merlin's sake and she was already pushing Ron and Mione for grandchildren. She was sick really.
The post arrived and the mail was dropped on the table in front of him. He shuffled through it, sorting it out into piles. The majority of it was for his father and a couple of parcels were addressed to his mother. However, there was a ministry letter addressed to him. From the "Pureblood Heir Registry"? Draco frowned. He hadn't heard of this office before. He untied the letter and began reading.
"It's not about the other night! It's about us. I'm miserable and you're turning into some Diagon Alley drunkard. You have to go."
"Men.", she sighed with an eye roll as she renervated her best friend.
"Shite.", Draco said loudly, earning a couple of looks from the surrounding students. "I have to go home."
Harry knew deep inside that he would never get over Draco. That single fact alone terrified him more than any Dark Lord ever could. A cold air settled around him and he briefly registered what was happening. Voldemort himself would rejoice from his grave if he could see him now. Harry Potter was dead inside. He died the moment Draco became Draco Malfoy.

The bird looked at Draco smugly and flew away. Draco ran to the window and shouted, "Yeah well you can tell him to forget it! We can't get divorced! There's no way to reverse a soul bond."
Remus pulled Sirius away into the corner. "I want my cub home Siri. Look at them. They need our help. Your grandson is in the hospital and they're living in a hole because of your stubborness. I'm asking them to move in with us and you better damn well be nice. I will not put up with any of your shite anymore!" He walked away before Sirius could respond.
"Harry love, I'm going to work. I'll be back round nine. I picked up an extra shift. Will you be all right?"
"Draco, get down." Harry hissed, throwing a pillow at him.
"See you later mate.", Ron said with a small wave. Harry smiled tightly before cutting off the connection on his end.
"Is that him?", Lucius asked looking towards the cot in interest.
"I don't need this. I'm going to the pub. I'll be back later."
"Oh sweet Merlin! You're a smelly little sprog aren't you? Draco cooed at a smiling Brax.
harry felt a set of hands close in over his vision. "Guess who?"
. The words ran through his mind in a continuous loop. It dawned on him what he needed to do.
Narcissa strode into the room fully expecting to see Draco as the wards had alerted her that the heir was home. She didn't expect it meant Brax.

“Naturally. I also want Vesper.”
Samara took her time finishing her bath – while Scorpius sighed, waited, and eventually entertained himself by watching the star blossoms – until finally giving a stretch and taking off with a flick of her tail, back the way they had come. Grinning in both exasperation and fondness, Scorpius followed behind.
with Harry? Something out in the open? Something that would fall under daily scrutiny from the entire wizarding world, something that would undoubtedly out him to his parents and potentially ruin his best marriage prospects?
Harry laughed. “No, it’s not Parkinson.”
Draco rolled over so he was lying on his back and staring at the ceiling. “I know it’s not

“Harry,” the other man corrected breathlessly. “Call me Harry.”

Harry chuckled, closing his eyes. The two sat in silence for a few minutes, enjoying the reprieve.
“I’ve also never seen Blaise quite like this.”
“Thanks, ‘Mione.”
“Worked out for a couple of hours, had a shower, finished cleaning,” he said. “Nothing exciting.”
Thank you so much for the kudos and comments! The chapters are about to get longer and the Drarry a bit juicier. Your continued feedback is always appreciated <3
– enough.”
Teddy looked down at his feet. “But I
“Thank you,” said Harry, with a nod of his head. He followed the elf inside, happy to step into the warmth of the grand foyer, while the doors closed smoothly and slowly behind him of their own accord.
“Let’s look at how the garden is coming along, shall we?”
“Me neither,” said Kyle, mirroring his expression.
That was an understatement, of course, considering that the late Potions master had thought the young Longbottom a complete dunce and absolutely useless. Though Draco would always love and miss his godfather, looking back on it he could see how he had thwarted the education of some of his students through his prejudices.
But Ron was looking at her in such a way that she knew saying that now would be incredibly stupid.
Back to the fantasy. What was he going to do to her first? Use his mouth. That’s what he wanted to do. He would make her mewl and cry his name. He would make her come, absolutely gushing for him, and then he would enter her.
“Good,” Harry said. He knew the others were watching, but that didn’t stop him from running a hand over Draco’s forehead, pushing his hair out of the way. “We’ll figure out who did this, and we’ll make an example of them. I promise.”
“I knew there had to be a reason.”
Ron closed his eyes, absorbing that. “The wedding?” he asked.
travel all over the world together if we wanted. What are summer holidays for, after all?”
, how it ended, who broke up with whom. But also…” She tilted the glass to and fro, her mouth in a pensive frown.
Hermione didn’t reply, unsure of how to. About many of the guests, Hermione was sure the other witch was right. But she could also recognize a slight tone of bitterness tainting Andromeda’s words, implying her observation was perhaps a bit skewed. Not that Hermione could blame her.
“Yes,” Goddard agreed. “That was the important first step we were hoping for.”
“Hm.” Draco turned to face Harry again. “And this?” He brushed a hand along Harry’s forearm.
“I’m sorry, are you… are you
“What do
Draco felt warmth surge through him at that.
He sat back in his chair, nodding along to something Lindsey was saying now about the latest human Transfiguration research, glad he had come to his senses before he had accidentally revealed too much. Spending a lot of time in the Muggle world, with Muggle men, had given him the illusion that he was free to be himself here. He had forgotten that he actually wasn’t, not really. He could feel his Malfoy mask slowly slipping into place, both familiar and frustratingly heavy.
She giggled. “Always, Mr. Weasley. Always.”
“Draco,” Harry encouraged, all desperate and breathy. Spurred on, Draco dipped his tongue inside, eliciting a needy moan from the brunet.
“I happen to agree with you on that. I only said something to Vesper because Draco asked me to, and because she had mentioned to me that there were already two different men who had asked her out.” He saw Blaise’s jaw tighten at that. “So I thought… well, I wanted you to at least be in her thoughts, as it were, if she was considering her options.”
Draco chuckled. “He did, did he? Well all right then. Meet me in the sitting room. Do you remember where that is?”
Draco nodded, because he did believe that Harry understood. “I’m
Draco nodded. “Yes. The theory now is that non-magical children born to magical parents – we call them Squibs – still have the ability to pass on magic to their descendants. They often marry Muggles – non-magical people – and have children, and sometimes generations down the line the magical ability surfaces again. We call them Muggleborns, because they’re witches or wizards born to Muggle parents. But in truth they are descended from magical lines.”
Harry did, and discovered Draco half-hard under the covers. He stroked and teased, and was rewarded for the effort as the erection stiffened in his hand.
“That’s the man you’re marrying. Better get used to it.”
“Why not?”
years especially would have a lot of good questions for you about what it’s like.”
“I’m sure I will,” Potter replied. “Lead the way.”
“It’s not really. Or maybe it is, I don’t know. I was just realizing how long I’ve been here talking to you and…” He trailed off, knowing he was in danger of sounding very stupid. But Max just stared at him expectantly, waiting for him to continue. “When Pansy told me, well…” He laughed again.
“Sure, love, go play. Stay at the edge of the water, though, ok? Don’t go in without me or Daddy.”
“I understand,” Mila said. “You can give the details to Madam Lorenz. She’ll make sure I do everything right.”
“Good week?” came a voice from the open doorway, and Draco looked up. Potter stood there, watching him, and Draco felt his smile dissolve.
Draco knew that was true, but he also knew it wasn’t quite the same. While Harry and Pansy had had a few unpleasant run-ins during their school days, it was nothing a little friendly conversation couldn’t repair, now that they were adults. But when it came to the way Draco had harassed Ron Weasley or thrown offensive slurs at Hermione Granger, he hardly thought one dinner together was going to make it right. No matter how good Harry’s cake happened to be.
“But how is Andromeda going to feel about that?” Draco said, interrupting Harry’s thoughts. “You would keep your legal guardianship, obviously, so she would have to be the one to revert her guardianship to me. Is that… will it be too much, after everything that’s happened? Will it feel like giving up too much?”
“No, it’s not,” Draco said. “Look at his eyes. He’s thinking very hard about something. Or someone.”
Harry shook his head. “I can’t wait to see your face when you realize just how wrong you are.”
“He told me he needed to move on. He told me he needed space. He cares about me; I know that. He wants to be friends again, once we get back to school. Those are the sort of things someone says when they don’t want you, aren’t they? Hell,
“Thickett…” Harry said, taking the hand to shake it. “As in…”
Harry launched himself into the air, his trusty old Firebolt still responding beautifully to him. He was well above the ground now, and he paused, looking down, while he waited for Draco to join him. He did, and the two exchanged a look.
Ron stared at him, wide-eyed, and Harry looked around to see that just about everyone in their vicinity was staring at them. Draco wasn’t finished, though, and hadn’t seemed to notice their audience. Harry hoped there were no reporters around.
“Still so tight for me, baby,” Harry whispered. “You feel so good.”
In truth, the teasing did make him feel better. He was glad that his friends thought the article was as ridiculous as he did. He snuck a glance at Ron and Hermione, who had been keeping quiet. Hermione gave him a sympathetic smile, as she had been doing all week. And Ron, true to form, was ignoring Harry completely. He imagined the article had only worsened Ron’s sour attitude about the breakup.
Harry looked around at the table. “If any of you ever considered yourself my friends even a little, then you will
He was tipsy, warm, and full of food when he arrived home. The house was quiet, as he knew it would be. It was nearly eleven, and Harry had undoubtedly put Teddy to bed at eight as usual then crawled into bed himself not long after, as he had work in the morning. Much of the burden was eased with Pipsy to help out, but Harry still did so much, and needed his rest.
Draco checked his watch. “Bugger, I really do have to go. Sorry, Han.”
“You told me to fight for her,” said Ron.
“Given the… well…” The man let out a delicate cough. “Given the symbolism I am assuming is intended with this particular gift, the blend of colors would fit quite well. Metals with different appearances, but with the same essence. It could be a unifying force between the two designs, make them… match, as you were hoping.”
“Already done,” the Slytherin replied, his fingers kneading Harry’s neck and his thumb running up and down Harry’s pulse point. “And it’s damn good, too. We’re going to get full marks on this. I can feel it.”
“I believe you said a thousand, actually,” Harry corrected.
Draco felt a surge of anger towards Harry’s aunt and uncle, miserable excuses for human beings that they were, followed by a pang of sadness for the little boy that Harry had been. The image of Harry, young and scrawny, with broken glasses, stuck in his cupboard all alone, still haunted Draco sometimes. It made him feel guilty for not realizing sooner, for not being kinder to Harry during their youth.
“Self-examination is not for the faint of heart.”
, Hermione. We’re going to have a
start tomorrow, you know.”
. There were times when he wanted his space, and it was then that he learned to appreciate Marissa’s more self-contained nature.
Pansy let out a dry peal of laughter, and Draco couldn’t help but smile, realizing how much he’d missed that sound.
Teddy didn’t say anything, only tightened his grip in Harry’s shirt. There was a good chance he didn’t really understand what Harry meant. But that was all right. He would someday.
Draco looked at Ms. Sturgis. “Not by everyone.”
“Wait,” she said, grabbing his arm. “Kyle?”
Draco leaned forward to kiss him. It was deeper than the one he’d given Harry in greeting, and Harry let out a small sigh, relishing it.
“Indeed.”
“There it is,” Draco said as the rhythmic, otherworldly sound filled the room, magnified by the charm. “That’s your baby’s heart beating.”
They’d had a real date not long after that, in which he took her for lunch and then to walk around in one of his favorite gardens. He’d kissed her for the first time under an apple tree that was in full bloom, the fragrance around them as sweet as the kiss itself. The Austen references just kept coming to mind, the way the whole thing felt so much more like courting than dating, but she was already adjusting. He was so pure and focused, so sure in all of it, that it was easy to forget that the rest felt a little old-fashioned.
“My mouth?”
years play Quidditch this year,” said Seamus. “Because we don’t live in the house dormitories and all.”
“There’s got to be someone you connect with,” said Draco, “
thing,” Paul interjected vehemently.
“I really had trouble,” he said. “Dad-Harry would practice with me for hours and I would get really frustrated. He’s patient, you know, but he’s also so… intuitive about his magic I guess is the word, and I don’t always learn that way. Or at least, when it came to the shield, there was nothing about it that was intuitive to me.”
“He shouldn’t have said that,” Hermione said softly. “I know he didn’t mean it.”
She suddenly sounded so stern that Draco merely did what she asked in silence. Lorenz looked it over with narrowed eyes.
“But what if you’re in France or something?” Harry asked, knowing his voice sounded a bit pathetic. “I wouldn’t want you to-“
“Yes, I do,” said Harry, not wanting to beat around the bush. “It really worries me, Kingsley, I’ll be honest. I don’t think a lot of people realize how dangerous a law like that could be. And what’s next, then, if it passes? Are we going to start digging into pureblood rituals and customs, too, telling them what they can and cannot do?”
“Water, please,” he said to bartender, who nodded.
She blinked at him lazily, a look that always told him she wasn’t going to do as he asked. He shook his head, turning away to retrieve the Marauder’s Map and give it a quick once-over.
Draco closed his eyes and nodded, but Harry wasn’t totally convinced.
This time, when he felt another presence, on his right side this time, he knew exactly who it was. The person had laid down next to him, close enough that their arms brushed together, and Harry knew him by smell alone. He opened his eyes to see Draco’s eyes gazing at him. He smiled.
“So that’s why I don’t recognize you. I figured if we went to Hogwarts together, I’d know you at least by face. It’s not that big a place.”
He would know soon enough.
“The nail in my coffin was a few days later, when you off-handedly mentioned an ex-boyfriend back in Toronto. That gave me confirmation that you liked men. And then I knew I was doomed.” He sighed, and Kyle almost thought he caught some self-deprecation in the sound.
Or even… wanking?
“No, sir,” he said, his voice clipped. “I’m just overworked. NEWTs are coming up.”
Harry put his glass down and approached Draco, placing a hand gently on his waist. Draco set down his glass as well and made himself meet Harry’s eyes.
“You didn’t finish your NEWTs here? I thought maybe you had.”
And he didn’t like that change, not one bit.
He might have drifted off, he wasn’t sure, but he eventually felt a presence next to him, sitting down to join him on his blanket. He smiled, then opened his eyes, suspecting it might be Ron, or Neville, or any of his other friends who had finished their NEWTs and were looking for a relaxed chat. Instead, though, he was met with the indifferent face of Blaise Zabini, who was gazing down at him with dark eyes. Harry sat up, surprised.
“I…” She looked between the two of them. “Thank you.” She still seemed a bit distracted, though, as she stood to leave.
“So,” she said, still smiling, “what
“She was the catalyst, yes, that got me first thinking about this. But… in some respects she wasn’t wrong.”
“But that doesn’t preclude
“Yes, Draco. That’s it,” Harry encouraged as Draco pulled him in further. “Just like that. Fuck, you’re so good. Just perfect.”
“Teddy… that’s your godson, right?”
Harry chuckled. “It’s not that, I just… I was just thinking.”
She knew she must look ridiculous, as Harry was starting to laugh now, too, but she didn’t mind. Not at all. She lumbered over to Harry and he gave her a kiss on the cheek.
“She looked behind her,” Declan said. “Twice.”
“It’s entirely different. I’m in a category all my own, so I’ll always be one of Harry’s favorites.” She smirked in a self-satisfied way at her husband, who scowled, though there was some amusement dancing in his blue eyes. Harry chuckled.
“Sorry, you’re right,” the man said, sitting up and looking a bit more alive. “What’s left to do then?”
“It’s this house! Knowing no one is around, except Kreacher, who’s tucked away in his little cubby hole downstairs, we can be as loud as we want. No one is going to walk in on us or get in our way. It makes it quite easy to jump you constantly.”
Hermione huffed a soft laugh. Harry made a face at Draco but didn’t retort, instead turning back to Hermione.
Harry gasped as he felt his cock breach the tight heat of Draco’s entrance, realizing that the Slytherin was going to ride him to completion, and that Harry was going to relish every moment of it.
year common room gave him just the right opening.
“Come again?” he asked indifferently as he packed up his desk for the day.
“Gods, Draco. Please.”
“Why not?”
Grinding against the other man was giving Draco a hard-on unlike anything he’d had all night, and it was becoming clear that Rick was having the same reaction. He felt the man grin against his mouth, a hand roaming to explore and lightly cup Draco between his legs. Draco’s sharp intake of breath had Rick’s smile widening.
Blaise absorbed that silently.
Potter really was some kind of genius. How did he know exactly what Draco needed in that moment, to erase the guilt and embarrassment of his aborted tryst with Rick (the Prick – Draco had to smile at that), to make him feel not just physically good, but… good about himself?
“Whatever you say.”
And admire he did. Long ripples of muscle shaped Harry’s broad back, coming in to dip at the spine. Though there were plenty of scars – some small, and some long and puffy, like they were made by a whip – they only added to the effect, to the pure masculinity on display. Draco followed the lines with his eyes as a finger descended down the spine to where the torso tapered at the tailbone.
. I was having these feelings, while he was talking, and I had to know if they were real. It was possible I was just flattered or surprised or… I thought if I kissed him, at least I would know one way or the other.”
The headmistress seemed satisfied, and she took her leave. Harry remained in his classroom, shaking his head and actually laughing a bit to himself.
Draco’s face closed off slightly. “What sort of look?”
. It might have worked for Harry, but it wasn’t really working for Draco.
Harry was back to full hardness now at the sound of Draco Malfoy begging for him. He wasn’t sure there was a sweeter sound to be heard anywhere, and he knew it was time to comply and reward the Slytherin for being so fucking sexy.
“Firewhiskey would be great.” Draco produced a few coins from his pocket.
Although Harry was like a second parent in a way, since he was the godfather. And Draco was a third parent, essentially, by association. They kept Teddy regularly, and Harry visited him often. Draco spent time with him whenever he could, though, since he had started his residency, it wasn’t as frequently as he would like.
“Honestly, men do you one favor and they think themselves saints,” Pansy said to Hermione conspiratorially. “They never realize what women do for them day in and day out, do they?”
job to make you fit for a wedding in less than an hour.”
Draco was aware that his mouth was watering, but whether it was because of the wine he was slowly sipping, or the delicious smells wafting from the range, or the sight of the man in front of him, it was impossible to say.
“I know. But are you… can I…” He licked his lips. “Can I see you tonight?”
"Come in!" called Ron.
She didn’t say much, though, mostly just let him talk, asking the occasional question and nodding and humming and saying things like, “That’s an important insight,” and “Tell me more about that.”
going to have to contend with the fact that if you want to have anal sex, even if you are exclusively a top, you do need to get comfortable around the inside of an arse.”
Harry hadn’t realized how much he would like it this way. The slow pace kept him from building up and coming too soon, and the effect it was having on Draco was incredible to watch. With only a few more leisurely strokes across his prostate he was a quivering, sobbing, desperate mess, his cock so hard it had turned an angry shade of purple.
sounds interesting.”
“And you’re all right with that? After what happened with Hermione?”
“I’m sorry, Professor,” Harry said quickly. He looked at the others. “Are we really going to stand for this?”
“From what I could tell, he always
“My father is a murderer, a bastard, and a fool, Ms. Sturgis,” Draco said. “And if he hurt you or someone you love, I am truly sorry for that. But I am not him, and I will not tolerate attacks on
Not that she minded.
She looked up at him. “Yeah, you could say that.” He could see a flash of something in her eyes, but it was gone in an instant.
“It can’t be a knife or a scalpel or anything like that,” said Draco. “Because the same issues apply as with the Scalpel Charm. No one could cut that perfectly with a knife,
Harry laughed, secretly enjoying the blatant flattery. He put his focus back on the task in front of him. “Rough shift?” he asked. Even Draco’s feet seemed tense, the toes slightly clenched and the muscles a bit twitchy. And that was nothing to what Harry could spot easily in the blond’s elegant shoulders. He was carrying something, Harry could tell. Something heavy.
Draco pulled back so that he could cup Harry’s cheek and kiss him soundly. Someone amongst the crowd wolf-whistled, but Harry didn’t care. He pulled away, finally, knowing he was probably blushing.
Harry thought that over before answering. In truth, he never kept a running count, so it was hard to be sure. “It depends. They sort of come and go. I date less during the school year, for obvious reasons. Usually there are… maybe three or four that I see on occasion. During the summer I go out multiple times a week, so it’s a bit more than that.”
He had something to say, something important, before he could move forward. He waited until Harry was really watching him, furrowed brow and all, before he spoke.
“One can only hope,” the woman replied. “Sleep well.”
“Mm, a bit,” Draco said cheerfully.
“Hello, Mr. Potter,” she said. “How was the session?”
“I said, I think I’ve really fucked up, Harry,” he said softly.
romantic!” Hannah called after him as he made his way down the hall, laughter in her voice. “Absolutely hopeless!”
“Hardly,” Harry said, all out grinning now. “I’m saving myself actually.”
She considered this, then nodded. “Yes, all right.”
Harry shrugged at that. “I can only say it how I see it.”
Blaise was quiet, and Vesper resisted the urge to ask him what he was thinking. Instead she closed her eyes, working on summoning the wherewithal to get herself out of bed.
, it just makes it that much worse.”
Harry started and turned to her. “I… um, yes, it was.”
help me, whenever I ask, and I took that for granted. I won’t again, I promise.”
Draco ducked his head, his cheeks warm. “All right. Fair point. I had a similar thought. Maybe it is time. I just want to bring it up in a way that doesn’t sound pushy or… or desperate.”
"You know you really should stop insulting the Weasleys. You guys have been friends for years now."
"Cute kid. Looks just like Draco of course. How is Draco doing anyway? Haven't seen him in ages since we had those drinks at my manor. Pity he isn't taking Beaubaxtons up on their offer. Blaise is leaving next week. He's rather excited about it.", she chatted away examining her perfectly manicured nails.
"What is it now?", Lucius snapped. He was kinder to the elves than he had been before, but old habits died hard.
"Divorce notice.", Draco said angrily after crumpling the paper up and throwing it down on the floor.
Harry's heart tore apart; a slow burn rising in his chest. Draco never begged for anything in his life and here he was begging Harry to take him back. His hand shakily reached for the knob; desperately wanting to turn it. To fall into Draco's arms, to make things go back to the way they were before, but something made him stop. He withdrew his hand knowing that things would never be the same again. They couldn't go on like this.
Draco's chest puffed up with recently acquired bravado and Lucius's eyes flickered across his son's face in amusement. He still saw Draco as a spoiled child, under his thumb. He'd lost it once before when Draco had begun the affair with Potter and he was determined not to lose it again.
"Draco's drunk. He's on my doorstep. Can you come?"
"What did you expect me to do? We don't have the money to pay them. Maybe it's time we asked your father for some money."
"Take care my boy and be sure to send me a birth announcement, I'm sure your child will be a fine witch or wizard in eleven years time."
He cleared his throat. "I may have been rather hasty in my decision to disown Draco. You must understand that I was in shock. I never meant to...well let's just say I regret it. I come bearing gifts." Lucius said as he pulled rapidly unshrinking packages from his pockets.
It was inevitable.
"You don't take care of bills by stuffing them in a box Harry!"
Draco's heart jumped into his throat and he prayed that Harry didn't know about that night at Pansy's.
Lucius brushed off his robes and adjusted his cuffs, straightening himself up as he moved to leave. As he reached the door, he stopped at the sound of Draco's labored breathing as he attempted to suck as much air back into his lungs as possible.
'His duty' Draco thought with a scoff. His duty to take over a role he had no interest in. To deny his dreams of joining a professional quidditch team or being a healer because while being a healer is admirable work, it is too menial for a Malfoy. His duty to marry someone of his parent's choosing. Not for love, no. Not ever for love because love is an emotion. Love is a weakness. But rather to produce an heir of the highest quality possible.
"They shut it off yesterday."
Hermione shot him a scathing look, but he just rolled his eyes and mumbled something about hormones while putting his arm around her shoulder. "Harry...", she began slowly. "This wouldn't have anything to do with Ginny and Dean would it? I know you said you were over it a long time ago, but it can't be easy seeing them get engaged. You two were together for-"
He thought back to when he first met him in Madame Malkins at the age of eleven while being fitted for school robes. Even then, his heart had begun to race when looking at the small, skinny boy with the wide eyes. He wanted so badly to impress him and befriend him though he didn't know why. Draco's hostile upbringing and superiority complex chased Harry away. He could admit now that he had been an arrogant little git; too proud to drop his mask even back then. Imagine his surprise when he found that the boy he was so taken with was in fact, the Boy Who Lived. Lord Voldemort's and consequently his father's arch nemesis. Thus, the inevitable happened. Two children, wrapped up in something bigger than themselves and raised on opposing sides of a war, became enemies.
As they stepped inside, Harry shouted, "Expelliarmus" and "Stupefy" in quick succession. The intruder fell promptly to the ground. Harry carefully walked towards the man. He was shocked to see none other than Lucius Malfoy on the floor. He quickly cast a renervate and helped the man up. Lucius dusted off his robes.
"What do you want Parkinson?" Hermione said stepping in front of Harry.
Where had it all gone wrong? For Harry, these last two years had been the best of his life. Had they really thought this could work? The son of a death eater loving the Boy Who Lived? It was laughable.
"Draco..Draco!" he tried a little louder. "Some decorum please."
Draco's eyes widened comically. "You're serious?"
Harry sat at the kitchen table folding clothes. Kreacher was out doing the shopping and honestly, he needed something to relax him. He shuddered when he heard the door open and close. He felt a kiss pressed to his cheek and an exhausted looking and disheveled Draco sat across from him reeking of potion ingredients.
The younger man still wouldn't meet his eyes so Draco took Harry's face into his hands."My life isn't ruined. It's just changed, that's all. If nothing else over these past couple of months, I learned that it's not much of a life anyway if you and Brax aren't in it. You two are the best thing that ever happened to me and I'm so sorry for not showing it before. This is all my fault."
"I hate him. I despise him. I loathe him.", Draco said punching the pillow trying to get comfortable.
Sirius responded by throwing several hexes at Draco who quickly ducked back into the room, locking the door behind him. He split into laughter as he heard Sirius yelling with Remus through the door. Sounds of struggling ensued.
Draco allowed his head to rest against the coolness of the hospital wall as he sat next to Harry who was silently filling out forms; tear streaks lingering on his cheeks. How did things get so out of control? What if something happened to the baby? The healer came out and cleared his throat. Harry stood up immediately.
"Mother, Astoria.", he acknowledged tightly. "I'm afraid I must leave you. I have something important to attend to."
Draco dodged Harry's attack ignoring his husband's protests. He continued to moan and groan and shout things that would make Seamus Finnigan blush. After a minute or two, he walked out of the door shirtless with his sleep bottoms slung low on his hips and his hair mussed only to see a furious Sirius standing a few paces down the hall wand in hand.
Ron breathed a sigh of relief.
Harry refused to cry in front of Pansy, but his eyes betrayed him. They filled with tears anyway.
"What?"
FOUR YEARS LATER...
"Shhhh now, let Pansy make it all better".
"Oh thank Merlin", Harry said burying his face into Draco's chest. For that moment, all arguments were forgotten.
"My parents are paying the bill. We're moving in with them tomorrow." Harry said without looking at Draco.
"Silly Potter. For someone so famous, you sure are dumb. Of course he got in. He got Os on all of his NEWTs s well as being Snape's apprentice. How could he not have gotten in?"
Draco would admit that he had been blindsided when his father sent him an owl proclaiming that he had actually signed the contract and they were to be married soon. Especially since he found himself smack dab into the middle of a relationship with Harry. He never thought it would actually happen to him. All of his friends had already been paired off, but he foolishly thought he had somehow escaped the tradition his blood demanded.
"Mr. Malfoy, would you like to cut the cord?"
"Why would you think he's going to leave?"
Harry had definitely put on a few pounds since he last saw him. He chalked it up to break-up weight, but wouldn't dare say anything. Not when they had just gotten back together. He had been the opposite of Harry, going to the gym every day and dragging Blaise on morning runs just to burn off the stress and sadness.

"Draco?" Harry questioned, his heart speeding up to a frightful pace.
"Dr-Draco. He's going to leave. Oh god, my child will be fatherless!" he wailed as he sunk to the floor. Hermione gave him one of her looks.
According to the family tapestry, it was coming up on the Potter bastard's fourth birthday in six month's time. At which point, if there was no other legitimate heir conceived, the child would gain his inheritance and Lucius would be powerless to stop it. Every property, every vault, every knut, and control of the entire Malfoy line's magic would fall into the hands of a child. A child that he had no control or influence over. Not even Draco knew the power that he himself wielded as the heir. Lucius had been careful to conceal it from him.
"Oh yeah. Whatever Mione said."
"I don't care. This is my fucking house and I want you out! NOW!", Harry screamed throwing a green sleeper at Draco's face and running from the room.
"I don't know what you're so nervous about. It's Harry we're talking about. He would never stand you up. Besides, where would he go? You've already knocked him up."
"I guess... professor what is this all about?"
Harry paled at the mention of Draco and his back knotted up in tension. Draco was looking for him. Did he know about the baby? Of course he did, Harry reminded himself. It was well over his twelfth week mark. Draco had to have gotten the notice by now.
"You should be ashamed young man for leaving your baby alone like that.", she tsked. "Poor dearie. I have half a mind to report you to the Ministry for abuse.", she said waggling a wrinkled finger of disapproval in Harry's direction.
After sealing all the windows, shutting the floo down and covering the furniture with sheets with a few flicks of his wand, he jogged upstairs. Harry quickly magicked his clothes and treasured belongings into a few bags. As he moved to leave the room, something made him turn around. There on the floor lay a small white stuffed dragon. Draco's from childhood. Somehow it had gotten left behind.
"I can't right now."
"Now you've done it", Harry said thoroughly pissed as he went to attend to the baby.
"Thanks papa." Harry said sheepishly.
Draco had been to mind healer after healer thinking somehow he had been secretly hexed as revenge for his participation in the war. Or perhaps revenge from one of the many sour business deals he had come across. However, none of it made sense. What curse or potion would make him lust after an unknown man?
"Hell if I know. But I do know one thing. Harry loves you. He doesn't give a shit about the money or the clothes or the image. You know that. You guys are meant to be or something. It's disgusting. You have something that anyone would give their right arm for."
"Young man. Obviously you need to not only learn how to close your legs, but your mouth as well", Lucius replied with the utmost calm.
It was always somewhere lurking in the background. The very real possibility that they would eventually be betrothed. Especially after Astoria's mother had fallen ill a few years back and there was a rush to arrange a match for her in the event that she passed away before seeing Astoria taken care of. A preliminary marriage agreement had been drawn up, but nothing was official.
"Yes Teddy, I'm dying. Now bugger off will you?"
"Love you too lion." He gave Harry a little pat on the bum. "Now get your arse in the shower. Can't be late can we?"
Pansy was notoriously jealous of Harry. Everyone knew she was in love with Draco. She had it in her head since they were practically babies that they would get married one day. Her bitterness was at an all time high now that Harry was pregnant. She couldn't understand it. Harry Black was nothing special and yet Draco still picked that half-blood filth over her. It was unacceptable.
The older wizard lightly lifted his wand. In an instant, the two were thrown fifteen feet from one another, their arms and legs stretched out like starfish and pinned.
"What is there to discuss Cissa? How can we even be sure that this child is Draco's?"
"May I ask why?"
"Come on now, let's fix your robes.", Hermione said
"That's it Harry. Keep pushing.", the healer encouraged. Suddenly Harry fell back against the pillow as a resounding cry was heard through the room.
"Spit it out elf!", Lucius commanded, tiring of the creature's incessant blubbering. The small elf jumped at the sound of his master's voice and curled into itself whimpering. Narcissa held up a silencing hand towards Lucius and looked at the elf kindly to let him know it was alright to proceed.
"I know Mione, but I'm fine. I told you I just needed a break. I was working too hard and I burned myself out.", he explained with a shrug.
"Yes mother. Shall we?", he asked as he took her arm and led her down the winding staircase and into the decorated ballroom.
"Congratulations Prongslet. We're so proud of you."
The healer was still talking, but Harry had long stopped listening. His mind was in a jumble, but he knew what he had to do. Draco had taken everything from him, but he'd be damned if he let him take his child; the only family he had left. Harry slid off the examining table and apparated on the spot.
"I'm so sorry. I thought you were someone else.", Harry said apologizing profusely. Lucius held his hand up to silence him.
"We don't need any help! We're doing just fine. I don't need him or his pity."
"Hello professor. You wanted to see me?"
No one could have predicted that the end of the war was not only the end of Voldemort's reign of terror, but an end to the animosity between Harry and Draco as well. They began a tentative friendship; Simple acknowledgments on the streets of Hogsmeade, small talk at the various balls and charities, business meetings over tea. This eventually grew to love; holding hands behind glamours on the streets, stolen kisses in the dark corners of every ball and function, passionate sex on the kitchen table (on top of the forgotten paperwork), Kreacher left to clean up the spilled tea. It was more than Draco, or even Harry for that matter, ever imagined could be.
"Look. I'm only going to tell you this because you're my best friend and I can't stand to see you miserable. It's been four months! You never go out and you don't talk to anyone. All you do is mope around and sit in your room like some lovesick Hufflepuff. So here it goes. Pansy told Harry about your acceptance to Beaubaxtons and that's why he told you to leave. Some rubbish about following your dreams and not holding you back."
"Well, here's your chance love.", Draco said winking at Harry as he stepped back in all his naked glory.
Kreacher looked visibly upset at the mention of receiving clothes. "Hmph. Still, master must eat.", he stated firmly. "Kreacher will be back with more nutritious food." With another soft pop he was gone again.
"Harry love. Try the breathing thing you read about in all those baby books. It's got to be good for something yeah?"
make your life a living hell.", he promised and Draco knew better than to push his fortune from the look in his eyes. Lucius released his hand from Draco's throat and Draco dropped clumsily into his chair.
"Why Blaise, getting sentimental are we?" Draco said smirking at his best friend.
"Draco. I had no idea you were coming." she said desperately trying to flatten her hair.
"What's that?"
"The bloody hell it isn't! They had no right-"
"You're pregnant.", Remus stated.
Draco's head immediately snapped up. He couldn't believe what he was hearing.
"I may have been upset with you for walking out like you did, but I was more jealous. You had the courage to stand up for what you wanted. Although I am appalled by your occasional Gryffindorish displays, it lets me know that I raised you well. You fought for him once and I see no reason for things to change. You know what needs to be done. Now get out."
"Was this person the father?"
"They can't do this! That meddling old fool is going down. I won't stand for it. How can they ask you not to come back to school? No one treats a Malfoy like this!"
Classes begin this Fall. All students are required to move in before the 5th of October. Please note that there is no family housing for first and second years.
Madam Hooch, ever one for sticking to the rules, blew the whistle signaling the official end of the game, but not a single soul paid attention.
"No...This isn't right. Harry."
Draco picked up the jar of floo powder, taking a handful and throwing it in the fireplace fully expecting to see the green flames rise, but nothing happened.
"M-master is telling Boppin to call when the tapestry changes.", it stuttered. Lucius's eyes hardened to pure steel and his face was void of any emotion.
Destined, even.
"Harry.", he said gently. "We're at school. Well no, we're a few miles away from the main campus, but it's basically the same thing. I talked to the headmistress and you're all set to start next Autumn. We can wait until then to move if you want. I can do some correspondence courses in the meantime since I completed my finals early. I don't want to be away from my boys again."
"Leaving?"
Draco bristled at that. His mouth pressed into a thin line.
"Do not test me boy." Lucius whispered dangerously. "You will provide an heir or you will regret it."
Harry plucked a blade of grass from the ground and twirled it between his fingers. "Pansy said I ruined your life.", he said quietly.
"That would be none of your business Mudblood. I'm merely socializing at a ball which is what proper pure-blood ladies are taught. But you wouldn't know anything about that would you?"
"Has your hearing gone bad boy? I said get out. You no longer live here." Lucius poured himself another drink. Draco was momentarily confused when an envelope appeared in his hands. He opened it and immediately recognized the sparse contents. His face lit up and he jumped at a startled Lucius who was stiff and as a board while his nearly grown son hugged the life out of him.
He knocked on the door and waited. He knew he shouldn't be there, but before he could leave she answered wearing a large grin on her face.
"Fuck the breathing!". He pulled Draco's face close to his.
"It's cute", he said knowing full well that Draco despised the word. Draco's smirk was quickly wiped off of his face.
"I came to see Draco. Is he here?"
"Um yeah. Thanks." He handed the baby over to Remus.
Draco slammed the suitcase shut. "This was never going to work out. You knew this would end eventually. You know who I am. I have obligations. My father already signed the contract."
'No, I'm not ready. I'm gay for Merlin's sake! Damn you woman, can't you see I'm miserable!,' he wanted to scream, but instead he chose to reply sensibly.
"Master is not eating again.", the ancient elf said.
"No Malfoy has ever brought such disgrace to the family name as this. If you leave, you are no longer welcome here!", Lucius called after him.
Harry drew up every ounce of courage he had through the tears now freely flowing down his face and began. "I can't Draco. It's over. Go away." He ignored Draco's increasingly muted protests coming through and walked to the floo.
Harry had to compose himself as Draco kissed him on the cheek and handed him a large bouquet of flowers. Harry scowled which was a rare occurrence.
"Yes. No. Wait. I don't know.", Harry finished putting his face in his hands.
Draco's grin widened. "So what you're saying is that I made you so incoherent with pleasure that you never had the opportunity to look?" Harry nodded sheepishly. "Damn, I'm good".
"Mione! MIONE!" Hermione ran into the room, heels clacking.
Draco sat whispering sweet nothings and words of encouragement in his husband's ear ignoring his bandaged hand. Harry pushed himself up on his elbows, black strands sticking to his face as he bore down gritting his teeth.
"Of course. Right this way."
"I-it s-says, Emerson James Potter ma'am."
Draco sat in a comfy arm chair in his father's study. They were sharing a nightly glass of wine. Well a glass for Draco and the rest of the bottle for his father. He had been back at the manor around two weeks after making amends with his parents who welcomed him with open arms. Lucius was trying in vain to update his son on various legal affairs concerning their family properties and businesses, but he could tell his son's mind was miles away. Probably with a certain green eyed boy who still wouldn't respond to any of his numerous advances or gifts.
"He's a complete git. Honestly. I don't know how Remus puts up with him. Yesterday when he told you your jeans were too tight, it pissed me right off. Who does he think he is?"
Harry's mouth opened and then closed, tears overwhelming him for the fifth time that night. It was too much. "I can't believe you did all this for me."
Inescapable.
"What are you doing here?"
Harry rolled his eyes. "You know, it could be a Gryffindor...or maybe even a Hufflepuff.", he teased.
Draco had been taught from a young age to hide his emotions. "Emotions are for lesser men Draco. You are a Malfoy. You were born of privilege my dear boy and that has its consequences. Your duty is to your name and nothing else. It is what defines you ," Draco could still hear his father saying. The mantra replaying itself over and over again in his mind.
Two hundred and fifty seven threats, a destroyed hospital room, one emotionally scarred nurse's intern, and a broken hand later...
"We need to get you to St. Mungo's." Draco quickly conjured up his patronus and sent it for help. Harry let out a loud gasp and Draco rushed to his side. He noticed a puddle of water on the floor beneath Harry.
"Draco darling, are you all right? Do you need to lie down? ",she asked as she took another sip of her tea; her blue eyes glancing over the rim of her cup.
Harry nodded crisply. For a moment, Draco thought he might get punched in the face judging by the way Harry's fists were clenched at his side. He had been on the receiving end of one of Harry's punches only once during their brief two day break-up period back in fifth year and he never wanted to risk pissing him off again. Harry was small, but he could hold his own. The atmosphere was tense as they both stared at each other in silence.
"It's nothing", Harry said tightly.
He couldn't believe that Draco was once so innocent as to lug that thing around as child and furthermore, keep it into adulthood. It was one of the things he had loved about being with Draco. Peeling back all those layers and discovering the truly vulnerable person hidden underneath. It was all pointless now. He paused momentarily, threw it in the bag, shrunk the entire load and slipped it into his pocket. International FlooPort pass in hand, wand in the other, Harry felt the familiar tug at his navel and then... he was gone.
He took a deep breath. "Alright, just do it."
Draco weaved in and out of the crowd with Brax's hand firmly in his and little Thea held closely to his chest after a quick diaper change and potty break. Brax almost fell a few times as he toddled along, but somehow they managed to make it back to their seats. Lucius had rented out a private booth for all of them that was normally reserved for scouts and the school leaders, but since he had recently donated a new library wing, they let him do whatever he liked.
"Are you certain we should Lucius?", Narcissa whispered.
"I know Cissy, I know.", Remus said comforting her.
"Harry, you're being ridiculous. You do want to know don't you?" Harry nodded hesitantly. Now wasn't the time to chicken out. He should have chickened out three months ago when Draco was laying on top of him, his glorious body covered in sweat, hands running up and down Harry's body, his tongue doing sinfully delicious things to him...
"It won't last forever. Someday he will remember."
'No family housing.' Draco said aloud. He honestly felt like crying and before he knew it, he was. They could barely afford their flat here. They could never afford to live close to campus in France. He incendioed the letter and couldn't help feeling like all of his dreams went right up in flames along with it.
Lucius pulled several, brightly colored vials from the sleeves of his robes. He sat them on the table. "I've been assured that these are the most powerful lust and impotency curing potions on the market."
"You have to go", Harry stated calmly; not meeting Draco's eyes.
"Harry, it's not nothing. Clearly you're sick and you have been for weeks now. I know Draco's gone and you're having a hard time, but you can't ignore this forever. He has a right to know. You can fix this Harry. You can't give up."
"Well, your father came by this afternoon and this is all from him and your mother." At the mention of his father, Draco's grey eyes hardened.
"I hate to be the one to tell you this, but you may not have a choice in whether or not you inform him. All pureblood heirs are automatically registered at the ministry once their magical signature can be detected at around twelve weeks. You're eight weeks now. Announcement letters are sent out to the families. It's to prevent illegitimate heirs you see."
"Well they didn't.", Harry snapped. "What am I going to do now?"
"Ah yes, there is something I wanted to discuss with you. How do you feel about home schooling?"
It was disgusting.
Harry sighed exasperatedly. "I'm blood adopted Draco which means I'm biologically a Black. You know that. My dad and papa let me keep a small portion of my birth parents' magic so that I could still look like them. They never wanted me to forget them." Harry downcast his eyes, the tears from earlier that day returning. He was starting to feel like he couldn't breathe properly anymore.
Harry slapped his shoulder playfully.
"Control yourself!", his father snapped, losing his patience. Draco reluctantly took his seat still fuming. "Judging by your reaction, I'd say that this information is disturbingly accurate. No use in denying it. You've been married for nearly four years and you have yet to produce a single heir. Therefore I've had several potions brewed to aid you in your future endeavors with Astoria."
Draco stood from his seat. "What?! Why didn't you tell me?"
"He's in the back."
"Daddy?" Teddy asked.
Hermione pursed her lips at his answer and he knew she could see right through him. "But to go all the way to America? You didn't even tell anyone you were leaving. Gods Harry, we thought you were dead. How could you do that to us?"
____________________________
"Last, but not least, Head Seeker for Beaubaxton University, Mr. Harry POTTER!" The cheers and roars from the crowd were deafening. Brax clapped wildly along with everyone else and bounced up and down. "Daddy! Daddy!", he called out pointing to Harry and reaching out for him.
Harry let out a noise that was close to a sob and a sigh of relief. "Yeah. It's kind of fitting don't you think?"
"Yes cub?"
"Perhaps you should take a rest." Lucius nodded in agreement.
"Oh, for the love of Merlin, get up! Bloody pathetic is what you are. What a waste. Go back to your husband.", she said throwing his trousers at him and slamming the door behind her.
"Up papa!", Brax demanded, patting excitedly at Draco's pants legs.
Ron snorted in amused agreement. Dean had sulked and begrudgingly helped them look for Harry, but they all knew that some part of him was glad that Harry was gone. He didn't want him hurt or anything like that, but he still held onto insecurities about Harry coming to his senses, realizing that he made a mistake breaking up with Ginny and trying to get her back.
"How was your day?", he grumbled out.
Draco moved to the shelves and pulled a purple vial down placing it on the counter.
"Which choices would you be referring to sir? Choices like being married at a young age or is it the fact that I'm pregnant? Is everyone too pure and innocent to be tainted by me? Is that it professor?"
"What happened?"
"You're all pale and sweaty. You look like you're dying."
"You better.", Hermione threatened.
What if they start dating? What if they get married? Merlin forbid, what if they had...chil...He can't even say it... Children? His stomach flopped miserably.
"There's my favorite girl!", he cooed playfully nipping at Thea's chubby arms, earning a glare from both Narcissa and Lucius who were obviously jealous, but thankfully held their peace. Draco marveled at how far they'd all come from that night at the dinner table when they first told everyone that Harry was pregnant at sixteen.
"Yeah. I just got sick of it. It was too long; too girly. Do you like it?"
"I didn't know you were a carrier.", Draco finally said in a strained voice.
Note: It's been a while huh? I'm truly sorry for anyone who might be still reading this or has been waiting for me to update. I promised not to abandon any of my stories, so here I am. I've been distracted by new fandoms and plot bunnies so I've been struggling to come back to some of my older stuff. [ Insert shameless plug about how you all should go read some of my newer stories if you haven't already. I even managed to write some non- Mpreg! #gasp] Any who, I pieced this together this morning and it's not great, but it's going up anyway. Don't be too hard on me.
"Hello Drakie darling."
Draco's fiancee, Astoria Greengrass was elegant and refined in a way that only a rich, pureblood witch could be. She was stunning with large brown eyes, dark chocolate curls that framed soft features and pouty lips. She possessed a quick wit and a charming smile. A match for him in every way that made logical sense. Not that any of it mattered to the man still staring in the mirror, his grey eyes cold and emotionless to hide his inner turmoil.
Lucius sighed. "I'm well aware of that. When that day comes, he will be married to Astoria and have a child. Draco will not abandon his responsibilities for some fling", he spat.
"Yes, you may." He allowed Draco to whisk him away into the hall and carry him up the stairs. Thank god he didn't notice the featherlight charm Draco placed on him beforehand. They finally came to rest at the astronomy tower.
Healer Rayner looked up from his position between Harry's splayed legs.
Narcissa decided to interject. "Now Lucius, this is no way to behave. We need to discuss this rationally."
"But you're adopted."
"Shove off Mione." Hermione looked gobsmacked.
When Harry pulled away, his eyes connected with Draco's. The commentator said something about Draco and the rest if the family being there for support, but neither one of them were paying attention. A silver gloved fist came up and over Harry's heart as a private gesture just between the two of them before it was raised in the air and Harry took off.
Harry was happy. He missed being at school with his friends; carefree, laughing and joking around like this. Hogwarts was his home away from home.
"I'm afraid you've wasted your time father. These potions are of no use to me. If you wish to have an heir so badly then bugger her yourself." Draco said in a bold move of rebellion.
She sighed. "I don't mean to pry Mr. Potter but is the other father perhaps a pureblood?"
"I can't believe this. What am I going to do?" Draco put his head in his hands. Blaise pulled a chair up and sat in front of his best friend.
Teddy's lip trembled as his eyes darted between his fathers and Harry.
Lucius silently levitated Draco's body through the halls of the manor and into his bed.
"Oh Merlin, that's rich. Good one.", he said gasping for air. Harry's face resembled a stone after Draco had finished laughing, his lips pressed in a thin line and his emerald eyes full of fire. "I'm not joking."
"Oh hello Pansy. How are you?", Harry said attempting to be polite.
"Go ahead Boppin. It's alright."
"Yeah!"
"I did it for
. Both of our dreams are going to come true. Quidditch tryouts are in March. You're already a shoo-in for the team, but you still have to try out as a formality."
"You can't do this Harry. Godammit! We're married. We have a baby. You said you loved me. Harry please, I'll do anything. I'll be better. I won't drink anymore. We're a family. Me, you and Brax. I can't live without you. Please Harry...please..."
Draco abruptly stood from the table, shaking the entire thing in his haste. His heart was racing at a million beats per minute. No. This couldn't be true. Harry would have told him. He would never keep something like this a secret. 'Unless you walked out on him without any warning and decided to marry someone else', his mind helpfully supplied for him. Draco glanced up briefly to see two sets of eyes trained on him. Astoria's mouth was ever so slightly turned up at the corners into a frown, but her eyes were carefully blank.
"You didn't.", Draco said firmly.
His mother peeked her head around the corner and slowly entered. She gave him a warm smile and placed delicate hands on both sides of his face.
"What? Who's going to leave?"
Remus eyed Harry closely all night. Harry was starting to shift uncomfortably under his gaze. He knew he was caught. No use in trying to hide it now. He reconciled with himself that this unpleasant conversation was going to happen whether he wanted it to or not. Remus discreetly sent Sirius upstairs to get Teddy and Brax into the bath and asleep. A task that would surely take over an hour. He needed to talk to Harry.
"Fancy some company?"
Sirius nodded, letting his son's words wash over him. Harry was right. If he wanted to have his son and his grandchildren in his life, he would have to accept Draco along with them. He was a part of the package.
After what felt like an eternity, Ron felt familiar hands on his shoulder and looked over to see his girlfriend standing next to him in the same spot he had landed. "Ron, are you alright?", she asked.
Draco who had been mostly quiet through the entire ordeal, quickly stood and punched his father in the face. Lucius's head snapped back from the impact and Narcissa gasped. He drew his wand and pointed it at Lucius's chest.
"I just said that."
"I asked you what name you wanted and you told me to name him anything, so I did."
Harry's face shone like it hadn't in months. "No promises on that."
Ron groaned and they all turned to see Pansy Parkinson and her friends coming towards them.
"I'm great.", he lied, putting on a brave front. "Is Draco here?"
"This is hands down the foulest thing I've ever smelled. We'll have to call the Auror squad just to remove your nappies.", he said fanning his hand in the air as Brax giggled.
As usual, his mind filled with shadowed images of a man. The sounds of the stranger laughing. Of him dancing horrendously in a living room. Of him stepping out of the shower, his dark hair wild and dripping water down his short, lithe body; one that was pressed against his skin as he woke in the morning. Try as he might, Draco could never make out his face. It was something akin to fragments of memories. Impossibly familiar memories. Ones that never took place. This illness had haunted him for nearly four years.
"Oh no."
"Anything", Harry gasped out through the laughter that was now slightly painful.
That was it. Harry stood up from his chair, his narrowed green eyes fixed on Lucius.
Harry felt a small kick in response to his excitement and then groaned. He couldn't believe he had forgotten to tell Draco about the baby. He knew better, but something deep in his gut was still afraid that Draco might turn around and change his mind when he finds out that their three was soon to be four.
"Father", Draco greeted dryly.
"Is everything alright?", Astoria asked in concern. She appeared to be trying, but he couldn't find himself to believe her as sincere.
Narcissa wisely chose not to mention that fact that it was Lucius who had foolishly aligned himself with Voldemort and almost had them all killed.
"Surprise!?"
"I just wanted you to be happy. All you ever talked about was the Potions program... I wanted that for you."
"See now, look at that. Those green eyes. You're gorgeous love. How could I be embarrassed by you?" Harry snuggled back against Draco's chest and breathed in deeply.
Harry rubbed the nape of his neck nervously. "About that..." He almost burst out laughing when Draco turned around and openly gaped at the sight of his stomach.
"Why? Why do you hate Draco so much? You don't know him at all dad. He's not like that.". Sirius had been against their relationship from the beginning. He never even wanted them to be friends and when he found out that they were dating, there had been nothing but animosity. Harry knew that there was a lot of bad blood between his parents and Draco's, but he never really understood why. This was deeper than a simple a House rivalry.
"You're pregnant Mr. Potter. I'm sorry."
"I do. When I think about living my life without him...without both of them, I can't even breathe."
Before he knew it, his lips met Draco's in a bruising kiss. Harry felt a sensation in his groin as he let out a moan. In response, Draco's own member hardened as he ground his hips against Harry making his intentions clearly known. Harry's face turned bright red as he realized they were both naked and in the shower. It was crazy in a way. Even though they clearly had sex before, it was mostly rushed and in cramped spaces. He had never actually looked at Draco's penis before. Draco noticed the coloring on Harry's cheeks.
"You wouldn't understand. You don't have any parents to answer to. No family depending on you. The whole Malfoy line is in my hands You don't know what kind of responsibility that is."
"Whatever you're thinking, stop it now."
well.", he emphasized hoping his son was quick enough to pick up on the not so subtle hints.
Not wanting to deal with Kreacher's nagging again, Harry walked to the floo before the elf could return and landed in his office. He was soon lost in paperwork and owls. The last mission had been a huge success with over thirty arrests and the downfall of one of the largest illegal potions rings in England. This particular group also had an affinity for capturing half-bloods with creature ancestry and selling them for sex or slaves. They specialized in Veela and elf prostitution and wolf slaves/pets. He was so tired that he eventually fell asleep on top of a stack of files when he was awoken by a sharp object hitting him in the head.
"You can still come and take your NEWTs when you're ready and attend graduation. I only want the best for you Harry. You must believe that."
"No. I was under the impression that he went to find you."
Hermione simply rubbed at his back and looked off towards the castle where four figures were getting smaller by the second, a knowing smile on her face.
"I'm telling you now aren't I?"
"Don't let him into your pants too soon yeah?"
"Of course not cub. We could never hate you. We're just worried about you. I knew you smelled a little differently, but I never suspected. It'll be alright", Remus said hugging Harry tightly.
"Resorting to the old threats I see.", Draco managed to choke out.
Silence...
"What the hell?"
"Get back on topic Blaise! Honestly, who'd want to marry me?"
"Papa told me to ask you if you would take me flying. I wanna try my new snitch. Please Harry, please.", he pleaded.
A knock sounded at his door. "Come in", he stated calmly.
Draco stood up in disbelief. "What are you talking about? I'm not going any damn where!"
"It's not junk, you stuck up arse!", Harry retorted playfully hitting Draco's arm.
"Oh I'm excellent. No need to ask how you are.", she said eyeing him distastefully. "You look very...domestic", she decided on.
His secretary alerted him that his father was on his way to his office. Unannounced, as usual. Not two minutes later did Lucius come strolling into his son's office.
"And just what do you think you're doing? Go back inside."
"I know Blaise, but he has to go with you. Beaubaxtons is his dream. I won't take that from him. I can't. Please come get him before he does something stupid."
Harry ran up to Draco and enveloped him into a hug and a quick kiss on the lips. Draco recovered from his shock induced state and looked at Harry square in the eyes.
An equal mixture of cheers and expressions of disgust rang out across the stands as the two boys went at it like their life depended on it. Older students frantically covering the eyes of the first years, much too young to witness the carnal passion being displayed on the field. All the while unable to tear their eyes away as one of Harry's tanned and roughened hands tangled itself into Malfoy's newly grown out hair and Draco's pale, delicate hands gripped the sides of Harry's muscled body, hanging on for dear life.
"Go home Draco, you're drunk off your arse"
"I don't know if I can do this. We're not ready for kids, we're only 17. What are we going to do?"
Harry smiled warily and wiped his face. "I don't know. I think it's hormones.", he muttered and they both laughed.
"I'm fine mother.", he replied; his tone sharper than intended.
"Harry, it was just a joke. I'm sorry. Come back to bed.", he called after him. And for the first time, Harry didn't.
"You miss him, don't you?"
"Hey baby won't you look my way. I can be your new addiction. Hey baby what you got to say, all you're giving me is fiction..."
"My choices?" Harry said standing up, his magic rising and swirling through the air. An angry Harry Potter was never a good thing. But an angry, hormonal Harry Potter...well that was just terrifying.
Draco lay down exasperatedly next to his very pregnant husband; placing his head on the bump, closing his eyes and relishing in the peace that enveloped him; just being there with his little family.
"Draco, I told you it's fine. And besides, you're technically not a Malfoy anymore since Lucius disowned you."
Pansy looked Harry up and down with a sneer on her face. "Always the hero aren't you Potter? Wow... Look at you, you're huge!"
"Why not?", Teddy whined.
Harry shook his head. "No. It wasn't just you. I'm sorry too... I just missed you so much.", Harry sobbed pressing their foreheads together. Draco wiped the tears leaking from Harry's eyes away with his thumbs.
"So that's it then? You're just going to walk out? After two bloody years?"
"Yeah?" Harry said coming from the hall.
Draco nodded. "Alright then. We're keeping it. I love you and you love me so for Merlin's sake stop blubbering. We're having a baby. Smile."
Harry and Draco stood saying their vows in front of the bondmaster, all the Weasleys and their best friends. They finally kissed and everyone gasped seeing the bright purple magic surrounding them, tying together their past, present and future, their minds, and their bodies; signifying a soul bond. If anyone looked closely they would see tiny celtic knots appear inside their wrists.
"That was not a request Harry, it's an order. If you continue like this, you could get reckless and we can't have you endangering yourself or the others. Now get out of here."
"I'll think about it", Draco said heading for the bathroom.
"Harry?"
Draco frowned at the mention of his father. "Technicalities love, technicalities. And besides, I doubt he actually disowned me. Wouldn't want to suffer the embarrassment would he?", Draco said bitterly. "Let's not talk about my father. He's not a part of our lives anymore."
"He's getting married...to a woman."
"Send it back.", he ground out through his teeth. Harry took a step back.
"This is where it all started huh?", a familiar voice commented. Draco.
Harry wiped his eyes and gave his boyfriend a small grin. "We must be crazy to do this."
A shit eating grin spread across Draco's face and he held his arms out, gesturing to the space. "We're home."
Well....it wasn't completely terrible. Let me know what you thought :)
Narcissa's heart broke as she looked down at her son. Tears fell down elegant cheeks. In a rare moment of affection and kindness, Lucius took his wife into his arms.
"I said not now Teddy!" Harry snapped. He instantly regretted it because his head was now spinning.
Before Blaise knew what was happening, Draco was already headed towards his dormitory. He had to go see the one person who could help him fix this.
"What's an abortion?", he asked innocently with curious eyes. The silence in the large dining room was deafening as everyone stared at the small boy in shock. Remus fixed a stern stare in Teddy's direction.
Snape looked even more pinched in the face than usual, robes billowing behind him in the wind. The professor simply arched an eyebrow as if to say, "Really Draco?" as Malfoy elegantly stood, dusted his uniform, spelled his hair back into it's usual flowing state, and followed behind his Godfather. Smirking smugly the entire way.
"Draco", Harry exclaimed. I didn't think you would be home this early. The ball isn't until tonight."
Draco swigged down the potion in one gulp grimacing. "Argh, this tastes like a hipogriff's arse"
By the time he returned from his inner musings, Draco had begun walking around and telling him about the kitchen and Brax's room, but he didn't hear a word of it. He slowly let his glamour fade away.
"Um...Gryffindor wins!", Leon Alistair cheerfully announced to the arena, the green Slytherin flags flipping over automatically, leaving only Gryffindor red and gold to light up the stadium. "That was one hell of a kiss. Er... game! I meant one hell of a game.", the announcer stuttered, trying and failing miserably to cover up his slip.
"Look at you. My little boy has grown up so. Are you ready my Dragon?", she asked.
"I took the liberty of buying Brax some new toys and a new bed. Kids are bloody expensive. I spent 19 galleons on a stuffed crup. A stuffed crup Harry. I'm glad we're not having any more for a long, long, long time."
Harry collapsed in front of the tree directly facing the quidditch fields where they had their very first kiss. He pulled his knees up to his chest and closed his eyes helpless to stop the warm tears from spilling over his eyelashes.
Twenty-one year old Draco stood in front of the mirror straightening his tie. From an outside perspective, he was the picture of perfection. An aristocratic, educated, abundantly wealthy and extremely handsome young wizard. Yes, Draco Malfoy had it all. The mansions, the money, the clothes, the fame, and a beautiful fiancee as well as a position as the Vice President of a major company.
(See the end of the chapter for
"No he doesn't and I don't plan on telling him." Harry said. He was thoroughly annoyed at this point.
"I wouldn't do that if I were you", the annoying voice said. He rubbed his eyes and saw Blaise looking at him sipping a cup of coffee.
He swallowed thickly, carefully pried his shirt from Harry's death grip and practically ran from the room to find a healer, tripping over his boots on the way out.
"Come to think of it. I have had a bit of a cough lately. I think I may need a simple antibiotic."
Lucius and Narcissa sat in their recreation room, sharing a cup of tea before it was time to retire to bed. The manor was cold and lonely without Draco in it since he and Astoria had moved into one of the smaller family properties. It was pureblood custom that a newly married couple live with their parents, but Draco had stubbornly insisted that they needed their own space. It was times like this that Narcissa mourned her other little sleeping angels and cursed her body for not being able to bear more than one child. Even with the aid of magic.
Harry sighed. "Fine, I guess it can't hurt to see someone. I'll go after I finish this report."
"Shut up Blaise! You're supposed to be my best man. You're not helping."
After the second Wizarding War, the Malfoy name was severely tarnished. It took an obscene amount of money, charity work, and groveling to return them to their previous status in society. The wizarding community graciously accepted the offers and slowly, but surely also accepted the new and improved Malfoy family. There had been so much loss and pain that no one had it in them to truly be consumed by petty hate and differences. They had all suffered in one way or another. Not to mention the fact that Lucius Malfoy's new company was quickly becoming a worldwide sensation. He had even gone as far as to branch out their products and services to Muggles which proved to be quite the source of revenue. Muggles may not live up to Lucius's backwards standards, but they were damn sure good for business.
"I'm just gonna get some pumpkin juice. I'll be right over."
"Where were you last night?"
The rest of the dinner went by fairly smoothly. As smooth as a dinner in the Malfoy house could be for that matter. Draco remained distant and spoke only when he was asked a direct question. Narcissa continued to chat about her usual nonsense. Shopping, gossip, aloof questions about the family business. Through her chatter however, her eyes were carefully trained on Draco who had begun lazily rubbing his eyes; vision blurry. Sweat beads formed on his forehead as he fidgeted with his tie trying to loosen it.
"Seeing as it's your son that's the pregnant one, I don't believe my son is the ponce in this relationship. Draco has a future as well. He's going to Beaubaxtons to be a Potions Master. I won't let this bastard child ruin his chances!".
"I don't know what to do anymore. He won't even talk to me." Ron and Hermione exchanged a look after hearing the hopelessness in Draco's voice. Hermione moved forward and hugged Draco tightly as a sign of her support.
Lucius and Narcissa watched as Draco thrashed on the bed, tears streaming down his face. He was crying out nonsensical words; desperately trying to fight the spell. Lucius gently led his wife out the door and to their own chambers.
Draco was pacing back and forth angrily across the floor; his trademark scowl in place.
"Maybe he's sick. He's burning up you git! Did you even check his temperature? Feel his goddamn forehead Draco!", Harry screamed. Draco didn't answer.
Draco opened his eyes and groaned.
"What crawled up his arse and died?" Ron whispered to Draco. Draco quietly led them into the kitchen out of Harry's earshot.
"That was beautiful.", Narcissa cried, dabbing at her eyes with a lace cloth.
Teddy studied him curiously. "Are you dying?"
Hermione let out a sigh of relief. "She was worried about you too you know. I think Dean was a bit jealous.", she teased.
"No. Don't even say it. You don't know what love is. You'll always be a cruel heartless bastard, just like your father. Get out!"
He could only imagine what his friends and family would think if they found out that not only had he been in a secret relationship with none other than Draco Malfoy for years, but he was knocked up by him as well.
"Are you saying that I'm some whore? My baby is definitely Draco's. I love him and I would never cheat on him. You don't know anything."
"I can barely walk, how am I going to get across a dance floor?"
"I see.", she commented and Harry could see the disapproval in her eyes.
Draco said slammed his fist down on the desk; his face flooding with heat. He had never been so embarrassed in his life. Including the aforementioned incident when his father had walked in on him pounding his best friend from behind over his office desk.
Draco scoffed. "I don't know about you Potter, but I will make an excellent father. This child will be the perfect Slytherin".
"Harrison James Black! Are you listening to me?" Harry snapped back to reality.
"No. That was. It was a one time thing."
"Hey little man. What are you doing here?"
"Did you not just hear my father Harry? I have nowhere to go. I can't... I can't take care of you.", he reluctantly admitted. The defeat in his voice broke Harry's heart. He had never seen him look so vulnerable, so broken.
"What's wrong with him you bastard!?"
"And the father, was he a one time thing also?"
"If it makes you feel any better Draconis, I'm graciously giving you one month to get your priorities in order. I'm sending you to America to oversee a business deal. I trust you won't disappoint me. I've gone through entirely too much to ensure your success." With that, he swept out of Draco's office.
"N-no", Harry stuttered under Draco's amused stare.
"Oh yes.", Blaise replied shoving the potion in his face.
"Then we're in the same boat. I can't go back either. I just told my dad to piss off."
Lucius huffed as he was released and immediately picked up the glass to calm his nerves. He looked up to see Draco holding onto the envelope like his life depended on it while smiling like a maniac. Lucius shuddered as he looked scarily like his crazy sister in law Bella.
"I wish I had a camera. The great Draco Malfoy having a breakdown like a little girl."
"Oi, me too. We'll talk Quidditch. That'll get a rise out of him", Ron chimed in, a crumpet hanging from his mouth; two others in his hand.
Draco pretended to be involved as his future wife and his mother discussed wedding details that he had absolutely no interest in; occasionally replying robotically. Yes, he thought traditional robes were better than Muggle suits. No, he did not like roses either. Orchids were much better. Yes, there should be a vegetarian option for the menu.
"Then what is it then Draco! Tell me so that I can understand."
"He's just fine. But I'll tell you what. He needs his uncle to make him feel better yeah? Would you like to go see him?"
"Look, he's with his parents right? They can help him with Brax. The first half is only a few months. You both need some time apart. By the time Yule is here, you'll both be missing each other like crazy and start shagging each others brains out. Voila, everyone's happy."
"Of course not Ron", she said reassuringly.
Draco snapped out of his trance, turning slightly green and laughed nervously. "Isn't there someone a little more qualified?" The healer nodded in understanding and whisked the baby away to be cleaned and fussed over by all the nurses.
Draco cringed at the loud noise. "Fuck off Blaise and stop shouting! What happened anyway?"
"I'm not hungry.", Harry replied gruffly.
"Leave it Gin. She's not worth it."
And laugh he did. Laughed until his throat ran raw and his eyes were barely slits, red and dry from salted tears. Who would have thought that one single man could bring the savior of the wizarding world to his knees. He had survived abuse, starvation, numerous murder attempts, the death of almost everyone who ever meant anything to him and two wars. And somehow Draco was the only person left on this goddamned earth that could hurt him. Isn't that how it had always been? He knew just where to hit Harry, how to crawl beneath his skin driving him to the farthest end of hatred to the highest point of love.
A Few Nights Later...
"Well we were always kind of rushed you see and I was a bit pre-occupied at the moment. I couldn't exactly think straight."
Harry and Draco stood at the check out desk where the nurse was awaiting the quill that was furiously writing out their bill and release instructions.
"No, he doesn't know and I don't want him to. This is classic you see. Typical teenage love story. It wasn't meant to last. He would have just ended up hating himself, hating his life, hating Brax...hating me. I'm saving him." Harry said shrugging and unsuccessfully holding back his tears.
"You heard me. You need to leave."
"Oh no! You poor thing. He didn't tell you did he? I suppose I wouldn't want my husband to know they ruined my life either."
Harry didn't respond, just stared blankly ahead at the tele.
Sirius handed Brax over to Harry. "Here cub. I'm taking Ted to the loo.", he said throwing a giggling Teddy over his shoulder and rushing off.
"You're sorry? Is this some sort of joke? That's impossible. If you haven't noticed, I'm a male.", he yelled his voice rising a few octaves higher than normal.
Blaise paled because he knew just how stupid Draco could be. "I'm on my way".
"Yes, I suppose I was. Anyway, we were found out and your grandfather pulled me from school for a few days. He told me how disgusted he was by my behavior and that I was not acting like a young man of my station. I had duties to fulfill and I was already promised. I was too cowardly to go against him so when I returned, I broke things off."
"What are you talking about Pansy? Draco didn't get into Beaubaxtons.", Harry said confused. Pansy laughed mockingly at Harry.
"Draco must marry Astoria. She's a fine witch, she will make a wonderful Malfoy." His tone held no room for argument.
"Sorry about that guys. Must have eaten something bad", he reasoned with himself, although he didn't truly believe that explanation and neither did his friends.
Draco pretended to be engrossed in his paperwork. He wasn't particularly fond of his father's impromptu visits. It was bad enough that he saw him at dinner every Sunday and in business meetings. No one, and I mean no one should ever be subject to small talk with Lucius Malfoy. Family or not. It was almost always an unpleasant affair for his father seemed to have no filter, though he was better than he had been in the past. Things had been strained between them more than ever before.
Harry self consciously looked down at his worn jeans and t-shirt now covered in baby vomit. He smiled nervously and attempted to dust himself off. "Er thanks".
"He didn't leave me!" Harry yelled back. "Did you know that Draco got into Beaubaxtons and he turned them down at first? Do you know why? Because he loves us. Because we're a family. He didn't run away. I did..."
"This is our way. This is how it has always been done. Draco will thank us one day. We may have lost the war, but we must uphold tradition. Have I ever steered us wrong before?"
Ginny stepped protectively in front of Harry. "Shut up Pansy.", she hissed. "You're a jealous cow. Draco doesn't love you and picking on Harry won't make him either. So stop it already, you're embarrassing yourself."
It was also times like this that she secretly mourned the loss of her grandchild whose little feet would have been padding down the halls of the manor in no time. The guilt of what they had done ate away at her until it was almost suffocating. More often that not, she found herself struggling to tell Draco the truth. It would dangle on tip of her tongue waiting to slip, but never did.
"Dad would you just SHUT UP! I'm not leaving Draco and if you don't like it... you can just piss off.", he shouted running after Draco and leaving behind one stunned Sirius Black.
"I meant one of the normal names we discussed like Leo, James, even Scorpius. But Abraxas? What kind of bloody name is that?"
"I'm sorry.", she whispered as she pressed a chaste kiss to Draco's forehead. "Step back Cissa", Lucius commanded. He raised his wand and chanted the spell; his wrist flicking his wand in intricate, graceful movements. "Nulla memoria reliquit!"
When he walked in, he was met with the sight of a listless Draco on the couch, covering his ears with his hands and the baby screaming bloody murder in his cot. His tiny face was bright red, tears streaming down chubby cheeks. Harry rushed to pick the baby up.
With great satisfaction, he had already incendioed the Daily Prophet which contained a picture of the "Greatest Match in Recent History" displayed in the middle of the Society pages that he had to pass in order to get to the Sports pages. Draco and his fiancé Astoria. It was a joke. What kind of name was Astoria anyway?
"What? Buggering hell, why didn't you tell me? I told you to pay the bill. Where is it?"
"We're just worried about you Harry. That's all.", Hermione said, her eyes full of concern.
Harry brushed past Pansy and swiftly apparated away with Abraxas in his arms. He had to talk to Blaise.
She trailed kisses down his chest before wrapping her hands around his semi-erect penis. He was so pissed, she was surprised he could even get it up. Pansy increased the speed of her movements and soon after, Draco felt the familiar tightening in his stomach. He arched off the mattress and came in a few weak and utterly unsatisfying spurts in Pansy's palm. Pansy smirked and continued to kiss at Draco's neck until she noticed that his moans of pleasure had turned to something entirely different. She rose to find tears streaming down his face.
"I'll kill you", Sirius said as he launched at Lucius before being physically restrained by Remus.
"You told Sirius Black to piss off?" Harry nodded and laughed. Draco picked Harry up and spun him around a few times before setting him back on the snow covered ground.
The Gryffindor looked absolutely besotted.
When Harry opened his eyes, he found himself standing inside a warmly decorated living room. "Where are we?"
She tutted. "It's no imposition. We'd love to keep him." She turned her attention to Brax holding him in the air and blowing softly at his face to watch him giggle. "Nous allons avoir du plaisir. N'est-ce pas mon cher cœur?, she cooed; smoothing down his white blond hair.
, got married and had two children. One of which you know
"He's going to leave me isn't he?"
Draco's life was slowly crumbling apart. Ever since he married Astoria, he had been miserable. He struggled to make love to her after the traditional wedding consummation. That night, she was eager, responsive and perfectly submissive in a way that was surprising. He'd always been brought up expecting that Pureblood young ladies were just that, ladies. In every arena of life. Astoria had wantonly moaned out her pleasure and pressed perfectly manicured fingernails into his biceps to encourage him. She even allowed Draco to fold her into positions that would have shamed her ancestors. And it did nothing for him. Absolutely nothing. After more than an hour of trying, he still couldn't quite get there.
"Christ Potter, you look like hell.", he remarked without tact.
"Fine then. Drink yourself into a hole. See if I care." Harry yelled after him before hearing the door slam shut.
The redhead swallowed thickly and shook his head furiously. No, he doubted he would ever be alright again. His best friend was kissing MALFOY! The same Malfoy who has made their lives hell for years. The same pompous wanker who picked fights that constantly cost them house points, landed them detention, or both.
"Really?"
He looked everywhere for Draco and couldn't find him. With his luck, Draco was already well on his way back to school. He'd missed his chance.
Harry smiled widely, teeth on full display as the motion of being thrown caused the hidden snitch he had been holding to fall from his grasp. It's wings fluttered meekly against the ground.
Brat.
We are delighted to inform you that you have been accepted to the Honors Potions Master program at Beaubaxtons University. Your particular scholarship will cover all expenses including but not limited to tuition and housing. You will be required to complete at least thirty hours per week of work study at the University's resident apocathery as well as fifty hours of independent research to be turned in before graduation for review.
"No, I don't think I will".
"Malfoy was even worried about you. He came by my office demanding to know where you'd run off to.", Ron told him.
"Are you crying?", she inquired. Draco's answering blubber confirmed her thoughts.
"It's a boy Harry! He's beautiful. Quite small though. What should we name him?"
Lucius eyed the flat with an odd expression on his face. Harry couldn't tell if it was disgust, curiosity, or worry. Probably some combination of the three. Brax chose that moment to start wailing.
"This has nothing to do with Draco! Just leave it Hermione! Do you always have to be such a bi...such a know it all?" he shouted and stalked out of the pub.
Seamus had come over with Dean and convinced Harry that the best way to get him over the prat who dumped him was to go out and have the slummingest, dirtiest, best time of his life. Show him he didn't need him. None of his friends had any idea who the mystery ex was. They dressed him in skin tight clothes, lined his eyes in charcoal black, spelled his hair and pumped him full of fire whiskey before taking him out into the night.
After the engagement party, Narcissa had made it a habit to invite Astoria over for breakfast no less than four times a week under the guise of wedding planning, but Draco knew that it was in hopes that they would grow more comfortable around each other. Although they had been acquaintances since childhood, they hadn't spent much time alone together or talked about anything of real substance. They were strangers to each other.
Narcissa tried to hold in her excitement and placed her tea down carefully. "What does it say?", she asked quietly, but eagerly. The elf was still frightened and could hardly get the words out.
"I talked to my father.", Draco explained. "It's all ours if we want it." He had spent days redecorating the family villa with the help of the elves so that it would be perfect for them
"Let me go Remy! I'm going to kill him. I'll gladly go to Azkaban just to punch that little shite one time. Just one time."
"Come on Pansy, I'm at work and I'm married." Pansy scowled at that.
"I have a few questions for you if you don't mind." Harry nodded distractedly before she started rambling on.
Draco snorted. "I'll bet you a hundred galleons, he's somewhere lurking in the halls waiting to see if we're having sex. As if we haven't done that before."
"Yes, leaving Potter. Isn't that what I just said?"
The other spectators couldn't help but watch in rabid fascination as the heads of the Gryffindor and Slytherin houses finally reached the field to properly scold and regain control of their two wayward and horny students.
"Ohhhh. How could you not have looked at it before? We've had plenty of sex", he said resting his hand on Harry's stomach to emphasize his point.
"I would have given anything to see that.", he said as his mind veered off track before returning to the situation at hand. "Right then, it's just us. Come on, let's get you somewhere warm." They held onto each other tightly as they apparated away.
"Er well yeah. We couldn't exactly afford it this month."
"Draco", his father acknowledged with a slight nod as he sat down, cane still in hand; his Malfoy family crest ring shining brightly on his finger.
"God Harry, what is it?" she said holding her chest. Harry looked at his best friend and broke down crying.
Silver eyes met green ones across the room. Harry was radiant, glowing even and Draco had never loved anything so much as he did Harry. Draco excused himself from his brood and walked over to his husband. He hardly noticed Pansy and the girls arguing.
"Theodore! I asked you a question."
Theodosia Gertrude Malfoy was born on a Tuesday at 11:02 p.m. with a head full of dark curls and molten silver eyes. She had everyone wrapped around her little finger. Especially Sirius who snatched her from Draco before he could even sit down.
"It's not alright Remus! Don't tell him lies." Sirius paced across the floor. "Dammit Harry, what were you thinking? How could you be so idiotic? You're seventeen years old and you're pregnant. By a Malfoy no less. A bloody snake. Have you no pride? Look how they treat their own child. I forbid you to see that boy again. And another thing..."
"What's wrong love?"
Remus's face wrinkled in concern. This baby was really hard on Harry. He was suffering from magical exhaustion. Remus and Sirius gave him a little of their magic whenever they could but their magic wasn't nearly as compatible as it needed to be. He needed Draco, but Harry was dead set against telling him anything. "Do you want me to take Brax so you can have a sit down?"
"Well, well, well. If it isn't Harry Potter-Black", a high pitched voice called from behind. Harry spun around with Brax only to see a smug looking Pansy Parkinson.
Harry was walking around the flat with Brax sucking down a bottle in his arms. He was exhausted. A loud crack sounded from outside the window and a shadowy figure came to view. Harry immediately put down the baby and cast strong protection charms around his cot. He readied himself for an attack, wand in hand. Whoever it was, was almost throught the wards now.
"This is it gentlemen. One more big push."
"What?" Harry blinked in confusion and looked around. He was at a loss for words. The walls were stone, but it was brightly lit with floor to ceiling windows. It looked like every dream he ever had of the perfect home come true.
"What is this? A ministry investigation?"
"You love it." Ron said attacking Hermione with disgusting crumpet filled kisses.
"Excuse me?"
"Honestly Ron. Must you be such a pig?' Hermione said slugging Ron in the arm.
"I give up. Welcome to the world Brax.", Harry whispered tracing one finger down his son's tiny cheek.
"Mrs. Malfoy?"
"Good morning starshine", a cheerful voice sounded. His head pounded when he tried to sit up.
Harry smiled and picked up the baby. He handed him to Lucius who looked as if he was about to protest. When Lucius saw Brax's blonde hair that looked so much like his own and a small hand wrapped tightly around his finger, the great Lord Malfoy melted into a pile of grandfatherly mush.
A knock at the door revealed a tired Dumbledore with an armful of blue blankets. It was then he knew that James and Lily were dead. They had all been betrayed by Peter and little Harry was the lone survivor and the miraculous defeater of the darkest lord in history.
He sat back on the floor, letting his back rest against a stack of floor pillows. His hand wandered to his bump where the baby was now kicking harshly, probably in response to his surging emotions. The little tyke always seemed to know when he was hungry or upset. Right now, he was pitiful mixture of both with a little more on the latter end. When the baby shoved it's foot in his side, he leaned to the side gasping. He looked down at his stomach and mumbled, "What was that about love? Do you need something to eat?" The answering kick was confirmation enough for him.
"That's not it Harry. You wouldn't understand."
"Harry this is insane. If you don't stop it this instant, I'm going to smack you. Draco isn't going to leave." She placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. "He adores you. Always has. Why can't you see that?"
"Harry! Harry!" a small voice shouted before Harry was tackled by Teddy.
Draco slowly turned to face Harry, an evil glint in his eyes. Harry's eyes narrowed as he inspected Draco's face. He knew his husband well and he could practically see a devious Slytherin plan drifting through his mind.
Harry was called up for his diploma and received some of the loudest cheers out of everyone. He did it, he graduated. A little late since he was graduating with Ginny's class, but it was done. When the names were concluded, the chairs disappeared and tables appeared piled with food and favors. Everyone was mingled in the chaos. Harry was hugged half to death by his parents and Teddy who was fidgeting in his formal robes.
Draco was speechless. He finally understood. He didn't dare ask which one of the two it was, but he could guess.
"Thanks for that Kingsley." Harry removed his glasses and rubbed at his tired eyes.
"Harry love. If this is about the other night, I told you I was sorry. It's not what you think."
"Whatever happened to her?", Draco inquired.
"Does he know?" Remus had always been on Draco's side. He really was a good kid, but he couldn't sit back and watch him hurt his son and grandson like this. If he knew Harry was pregnant again and he still left, he would castrate the bastard himself.
"Dad, stop!", Harry pleaded visibly embarrassed.
"Take your time dear!", she called after him with a knowing smile on her face. She snuggled Brax close to her breast and kissed his forehead.
? - snogging session.
"I have to find him." Harry grabbed Brax, ignoring his father and snuggled him into a fuzzy blue jacket with bear ears on the hood. He was at the door before he turned and looked at a forlorn Sirius sitting at the table.
"How? Who-?" he stuttered.
He knew this was coming. He knew that Draco was engaged. Had known for months. But the reality that it was finally over, that Draco was actually bound to someone else forever and that there was no chance for them left, was too much to bear in that moment. He felt the tears threatening at the corners of his eyes and he knew it was time to go. "Guys, I'm sort of tired and I still have some stuff to do around the house. I'll floo later."
"I said no Draco. Your parents are just trying to help."
Draco's fingers pinched the bridge of his nose as he mentally counted down to the inevitable explosion. Remus was shocked, Sirius was so red they were sure he was turning into a tomato, Narcissa's hand was covering her mouth seemingly shocked but Draco knew she was mentally planning a wedding and baby shopping excursions, and Lucius, well let's just say he was beyond furious. He was the first to break the silence.
"My papa is a werewolf.", Harry replied as if it should have been obvious. Draco had to have known that this was a possibility. They hadn't exactly been careful.
Harry nervously pulled at his hair not wanting to remember that night at all. "Um.. a few days ago."
"What are we doing here?"
"I think I will.", Draco said standing up from the table struggling to keep his balance. His temperatures was rising by the minute. He barely made it to the door before collapsing onto the floor.
"Now do you require any potions or not?"
"But... I...huh?" Harry stuttered frowning in confusion.
"Are you still here?"
"Don't ever speak to him like that again!", he growled through gritted teeth. Narcissa moved towards Draco in an attempt to pacify the already escalated situation, but Lucius pushed her behind him.
His mind, however was a million miles away from their breakfast table. No matter how hard he tried, his thoughts always returned to Harry. It was always about him. He considered going to find him. To try and make things right and work out a way for them to still be together, but he knew there was no chance. Harry would be never agree to be second best and Draco couldn't ask him to. He missed him terribly.
"Out where?"
"Say hi to Harry and kiss Brax for me!", Blaise called after him. He smiled to himself and got up from the table, grabbing his and Draco's left behind items.
"I don't have a father. We'll do less entertaining! Tell your friends to go eat someone else out of house and home."
"The healers say he has post-partum depression or some rubbish.", Draco explained. "He's been like that since we brought Brax home. He wants nothing to do with him or me."
"Don't you dare talk to my son like that Malfoy. Your precious little ponce of a mummy's boy is the reason they're in this mess. Harry is a good kid. He was a virgin before Draco came along. He's supposed to be going to the professional quidditch leagues after graduation. He has a future dammit!", Sirius yelled slamming his fist on the table.
"Daddy", Teddy whispered tugging at Sirius's robes. "I have to pee."
"But what about school? You can't just quit. We can try to work things out long distance. You still have the summers off and all the hols.", Harry rambled on.
"You're absolutely right Draco. We're doing just brilliantly." His voice dripped with sarcasm. "Look around this flat Draco. We barely have enough to feed Brax and buy his nappies. You're such an arrogant arse that you'd rather let your own son starve than let go of your precious pride for one sodding minute!"
"Prongslet?" Teddy called peeking through the crack.
This was only the beginning.
Draco picked his son up and stabilized his little feet so that he was standing on top of his thighs. The commentors signaled the beginning of the game and introduced the first team. Afterwards, the Beaubaxton team flew out in their blue and silver uniforms, Harry bringing up the rear. Each player was announced individually. When it was Harry's turn, he circled around the arena.
"Perhaps. Know anyone offering?"
"He's just fine Mr. Potter-Malfoy. He has a mild case of the dragon pox. It's common for small children. All he needs is a little rest, plenty of love and to take these prescribed potions twice a day."
"Sorry."
"Shut it Draco. You're going to wake up Brax." Just then a loud wail came from the hall.
"Firstly the view is amazing and I suppose I just wanted you all to myself." He pulled Harry close as they slowly turned, dancing to a melody all their own. The kind of music made by shuffling feet, content sighs and the beating of two hearts as one. Suddenly Draco felt Harry tense in his arms.
"I'm fine. Really.", Harry insisted. He didn't want to go home. There was nothing there for him, but his thoughts. He needed to work. He needed the distraction. It was the only thing holding him together.
Draco walked in the door. "Harry, where are you?", he called out.
Harry came back from the loo still holding his stomach.
Hopefully, Draco and Astoria would be able to conceive soon and this nightmare would be behind them. An elf popped into the room, the poor creature shaking at it's knobby knees and fiddling with the off green potato sack it was wearing. Likely because all of the staff had strict instructions not to disturb them at this late an hour unless there was some sort of crisis.
"Don't cry.", he murmured which only made Harry cry harder. Somehow he ended up crawling into the blond's lap. Draco rocked him back and forth muttering soothing words in his hair. After a while Draco's legs began to go numb.
"It absolutely is junk. If you want something new love, I'll gladly buy it. Come now. Tell daddy Draco what you'd like," Draco purred pulling Harry to him and grinding their middles together. The store owner eyed the two over his glasses. The old man shook his head in disapproval and returned to the paper he was reading.
"It's not so bad", Harry said attempting to lighten the mood. He pulled out his wand and muttered a powerful cleaning charm on the front room while letting up the curtains to allow some sun in. Draco sighed. He just wasn't used to this.
"Have you gone mad Draco?", he hissed. How could you throw away your life like this? It's one thing to date, but now to soil our family blood with this...this filth?", he said gesturing towards Harry. "I will not allow it!"
"Wonderful! Then you aren't opposed to the idea?"
"He won't stop crying. I tried everything." Harry felt across Brax's head frantically.
Harry had had enough. "Shut up you git! My parents can hear you.", he yelled as he launched himself at Draco.
Least of all Ron Weasley, who watched in dawning horror as a normal scuffle between the two House seekers went from beating the piss out of one another in between hexes and turned into an all out, full on - bloody hell is that Harry's
"What?"
"It's a start", he sighed as he began to unshrink their belongings. Thank god for their mothers...er mother and Remus. They had to sneak the boys in to get their clothes and other items. Draco busied himself by attempting to transfigure Harry's bed into a king size one like he had at the manor.
Dear Mr. Malfoy
"Hurts.", he gasped out in pain. Draco placed his hand on Harry's bulge steadying Harry to help him maintain his balance and stiffened when he felt how hard Harry's stomach was. It was like a rock.
Unresolved sexual tension Hermione had called it. He'd scoffed back then, but now, faced with the reality of it all was too much.
"Draco?"
Draco's hands were shaking and he sank to the floor in the corner of the stockroom. His letter from Beaubaxtons had come and he was itching to open it. He took it to work with him because he was scared that there might even be a small chance that he didn't get in and he wanted to gather himself so that he wouldn't break down in front of Harry. They needed this. This was their only way out. He steeled himself and opened the envelope slowly.
"I won't even ask why you know how a hipogriff's arse tastes".
As Draco watched his husband dive down to start the game, looking every bit like he was born to ride on a broom, he felt a swell of pride in his chest. They made it. This is where they belonged. Every road they took would always lead them back to each other. And that was more than okay.
"He's up the duff again isn't he?" asked Ron.
"Because you deserve better than this!", Sirius exploded. "He left you alone with one baby and another on the way! He ran away Harry. Right after he got what he wanted. Just like his bastard of a father. How can you defend him?"
"There you are. That'll be five galleons."
He held up a bottle of firewhiskey. "You said we could talk. Is that offer still open?"
Draco groaned. She was relentless. "Goodbye Pansy.", he said sternly.
☉☉☉☉☉☉☉☉☉☉☉☉☉☉☉☉☉☉☉☉☉☉☉☉
Draco sat at his desk, eyes pouring over a complicated contract. A sound of frustration and boredom escaped his lips as he carelessly tossed the papers aside and leant back in his chair. For a few brief moments, he was oddly serene. Something that wasn't a common occurrence days. He allowed himself to fall into the false sense of security before the pain slammed into him.
Draco hummed in agreement as they sat in silence. There were so many thoughts running through each of their minds that they couldn't figure out what to say first.
"Who told me is of little importance.", Lucius interrupted.
"I love it." Draco ensured him. Harry's eyes began to tear.
"What will you do for me if I stop?"
Draco was careful to keep his face void of emotion. No matter what he felt about the situation, he swallowed his feelings down because ultimately, it was Harry's choice. "What do you think we should do? We have options Harry. Do you...do you want to keep the baby?"
________________
"If that's all professor. I'll be leaving now.", he said a bit dejectedly.
"Hey Drake", Blaise said knocking on the bathroom door and opening it a bit. "How many pairs of knickers do you have?"
"Oh Harry baby, just like that. Yes!", he shouted. "You know I like it rough. Fuck, you're so hot!"
"We've been through this before Blaise. There's nothing to go home to."
Surely this wasn't happening right now. Not at this moment. He felt a strange sensation and then a rush of water came flooding into his pants and soaked through to the tiled floor.
He couldn't sit and watch Draco get married. He was strong. No doubt about that, but not that strong. He couldn't keep lying to his friends telling them he was fine when he wasn't. He couldn't bury himself in his work anymore. He had someone else's life in his hands and for the first time it didn't feel like a burden. This was his chance to create a new life, for himself and the baby.
"You didn't.", Harry swallowed. "You didn't tell him anything did you?"
Harry chose that moment to save Teddy who was in tears at the thought of betraying his big brother. Damn, Teddy must have been spying on his conversation with Ron earlier.
"Where did all of this come from?" Harry noticed the look on Draco's face and shuffled nervously.
"I need to go to the office and check on things. Continue planning without me." He kissed his mother's cheek and begrudgingly Astoria's as well. Draco immediately went to Grimmauld Place. The wards were up and keyed to keep Draco out and he found himself arse flat on the ground in front of the gate. It was of little consequence as he was determined to break through them.
"You absolutely will not. We bought you a crup last year and you forgot to feed it. It died!" Lucius shouted.
Harry picked up Brax and walked into their bedroom, slamming and locking the door behind him. Draco winced at the slam and slowly slid down the wall onto the floor. He needed an escape and fast.
"Just be careful. It's cold out there...and Prongslet?"
"Narcissa.", she corrected gently.
"Cute?", he growled as he advanced on Harry.
"Huh?"
of us or none of us."
"Draco..." Blaise said carefully as he placed a hand on his friend's shoulder. "You do realize you're yelling at a bird right?"
"Sure Gin, tell her I'll try to stop by soon."
Harry was on his knees with his head stuck in the fireplace. His position was made even more difficult by the huge bump that had taken up residence on his front. The healers thought it could be any day now that he would go into labor. With it being a male pregnancy, Harry knew he would likely not make it to full term due to the lack of room in his abdomen. He sighed heavily.
"Oh Harry! We missed you", Hermione shouted as she hugged him. Harry only yawned and rudely pulled away.
"I'll be back to get him soon.", he promised, rushing off after handing her the baby bag.
Harry was lying in the bed awake when Draco came in. He had been waiting for him for hours. He should have been home a long time ago. He quickly turned over, pulling the duvet up to his chin. He felt the other side of the bed dip in and Draco's warm body wrap around him. His mind swirled with endless explanations for Draco's lateness and none of them good. His chest burned as silent tears slipped from his eyes and he fell into a restless sleep.
Truthfully, he hadn't really left the house in three weeks. Only to go to work and come home from one of his missions covered in filth and fall into restless sleep. With the exception of the previous weekend when Seamus and Dean dragged him out to the clubs. It predictably ended in disaster.
"Oh bugger, I'm leaking."
He spotted Draco intently scouring the shelves for potion ingredients. Harry immediately wrapped his arms around the slender waist of the taller blonde and buried his face in Draco's black cashmere jumper. Draco instantly knew who it was and smiled, whirling Harry around gently to face him. He took in Harry's expression and his smile faded. Something was wrong.
Sending you love and hugs as always <3
. They might manage to both climax before Vesper’s call, if they were efficient about it.
Draco sighed. Yes, that would be the frustrating thing about being an emotionally intelligent five-year-old who spent most of his time around veterans of a war. He probably always felt like there were secrets that everyone around him knew but that were being kept from him “for his own good.”
“I’ve seen the list, and you have very fair-minded masters for your panel,” Draco assured her. “They’ll likely throw some easy questions at you first, to let you get settled in. But you know your research back to front to upside-down. There isn’t anything you can’t answer, I know it.”
“Which is an issue he ought to be taking up with the former Mrs. Rowle, now Ms. Abbott, I should say, rather than with us.”
“That’s right. The Squad is interested not just in dealing with the aftermath of accidental magic, but also in understanding what causes it, and understanding the nature of it.”
“And I got older. My friends started having kids. You know how it was after the war. Anyone who was paired off and old enough was eloping and procreating like there was no tomorrow.”
“But I did end things. I mean… I did. But it wasn’t… it was supposed to be a wake up call, or maybe a way to get space from each other. I never stopped loving her. I’ll always love her. It was just… somehow it had all gone to shit and I couldn’t figure out why. But she took it like… she heard me suggest that we should take a break and she just ran with it, like she couldn’t wait to get away from me. But then… then we started reconnecting, and I thought… maybe we were getting somewhere. And now apparently she’s seeing this bloody Ross… person, who’s essentially the opposite of me, and I don’t know what to think.”
“Thank Merlin for small mercies,” Harry said, and Malfoy chuckled.
, Draco thought bitterly. If only he could go out and meet someone who just fancied a shag and nothing more, who wanted sex without the baggage.
“So we’re both guilty of the same crime. We’re just one in the same, in the end, aren’t we?”
He found himself leaning into Harry a bit as they walked, seeking out the natural comfort of his warmth and weight. Harry turned and smiled at him, leaning over to give him a peck on the lips.
“He took…” Harry breathed, “my letter… from Draco.”
They emerged onto a narrow outcropping that looked out over the lake. They were not very high up, but one slip would land them in the water, which Scorpius knew from experience was still quite cold, even now into spring.
years went into Muggle London for the parade and the fireworks. It had been a wild night, full of drinking, dancing, and general revelry. All of the 8
Draco watched the lanky brunet as he sipped his coffee and wondered if he had made a huge mistake coming here. He’d thought he wanted a chance to speak to Kyle again, a chance to make things right and make sure that the man was doing ok after everything that had happened. But he never thought he’d actually get the chance.
“Well, then, there you have it.”
It wasn’t until he was seven and – Harry and Draco deciding that a third child would be fun – Lily had come along that he’d realized he’d taken Marissa for granted. Lily was fun to show new things to, and she was always game for an adventure, but she also wanted to follow Scorpius around
“I don’t particularly fancy the idea of you having a love life at all, I’ll admit,” he said, amused. “You know I don’t think any man will ever deserve you. But, as you constantly remind me, you are essentially my surrogate daughter, and so it is my duty, as your surrogate father, to ask you about these things, make sure that you’re happy.”
She shook her head mutely.
“We’re just having a picnic in the park,” said Harry. “He won’t mind. He’ll probably spend most of his time on the playground anyway. Besides, he’s been very interested in meeting this cousin of his that he didn’t even know he had.”
Clint looked at him once again, his hand stilling. For a moment, Kyle thought there was some understanding passing between them. Although maybe he was imagining it.
“But if we don’t get married, I can’t be with him forever.”
“Well, I’ll let you two get acquainted, then,” Pansy said to them with a squeeze of Draco’s arm. “I’ve a few more guests to greet.” And she was off before Draco had time to protest.
“Gin and tonic for him,” he heard Potter say, placing a couple of Muggle notes on the bar. “With lime.” He turned back to Draco. “Give it a try. If you don’t like it, we’ll order something else.”
“Picard thought you looked quite cozy.”
“Sure, I’ll have what you’re having.”
“I know, that’s why I like it,” said Draco.
“Yes, Sir,” Harry said.
likely, especially since Draco would be at the hospital a lot, leaving much of the planning to him. But he could live with it. “But I get to marry you at the end, right?”
Harry was really tired of being right. Quidditch practice that night was the worst they had had all term. Ron was his usually silent self, but Ginny’s mood was outright foul. She was belligerent and uncooperative, and most of practice was wasted on trying to get all three Chasers to successfully execute the plays that had been practicing for weeks. A week ago, they had it down perfectly, and a victory against Ravenclaw was all but guaranteed. Now, though, Harry was genuinely nervous. The first match of the season was inching ever closer, and if Ginny didn’t snap out of this soon, they were in serious trouble.
“Think about it,” Draco encouraged, not wanting to give it away just yet. “Think about what you know is changing.”
,” Ron said again, like it was a foreign word he was pretty sure was an insult. “So I said, ‘confused about what, about us?’ And she looked at me, and she said she knew she loved me but she didn’t know… she needed time to think about things and would I… would I give her some time…” Ron was pacing again, and shaking his head frantically. “Fuck… fucking hell…. Fuck.”
“Well, you know I of all people would agree with that,” said Harry, his smile turning wry. “What you’re describing has been most of my experience with life, honestly. At the same time, though, I do like the idea of making a plan. Especially with you. I want to feel like we’re moving forward and we at least have a sense of where we’re going. Otherwise, how do we move forward at all?”
“I have them right here, remember?” Teddy said, pointing to his little backpack and lunchbox that he kept by the fence so he could play unhindered once school let out.
“’Ook, Mummy,” he said. “I have tain.”
“Of course,” Draco scoffed. “Why wouldn’t I be?”
“Because we didn’t talk about that, not really,” Harry went on. “When we broke up, I mean. But at the same time…” He trailed off, realizing he had no idea how to put into words what he meant. He sighed, exasperated with himself. “We didn’t talk about it, but as we were talking I was
Harry laughed. “No. I never bake a cake. Usually I’m lazy and just bring ice cream or treacle fudge or packaged biscuits or something. Ron and Hermione do the same. They’re not exactly skilled bakers, so they don’t mind. But tomorrow night is special, so I thought we’d mark the occasion properly. And I make a pretty good cake, I have to say.”
“Do you two disagree on that issue?”
Hermione shook her head. “No. We’ve already committed to spending the holidays with your family. It’s what we agreed.”
So here's Harry and Draco's wedding in all its fluffy glory. I do hope it satisfies you in some way, and I hope you will still be on board for the rest of this story. There is much more to come! <333
The night went on and Hermione eventually forgot about her questions regarding Blaise and Vesper, as well as her other worries, as she danced, talked, and laughed with her friends.
“Yes,” the Mind Healer replied. “Yes, of course.”
“Was someone jealous?” Draco asked Harry in a low voice, taking a sip of whiskey out of Harry’s glass.
Harry stared at Malfoy in surprise, but said nothing.
Harry cut the floo connection and Draco stood. When he turned back to the portrait of his godfather, the man had the most peculiar look on his face.
It had happened on Scorpius’ thirteenth birthday, not long after the party at the manor when all of the guests had gone. Lucius had come to visit Scorpius in his room and presented it to him in its blue leather box with a silver M embossed on the top.
Fair warning, this is the part where Draco is with other people. I know it's blasphemy. Don't think I don't know that. I had to write this weirdly non-Drarry smut after all, and it was not that fun to do. I hope you will keep an open mind anyway and realize that this is just part of the journey. We all know Draco will end up where he needs to in the end. Have faith <3
Harry was nervous. They both were. In just a few short minutes, twenty, at the most, Andromeda and Teddy would be arriving. It was the day that Andromeda started her treatment at the hospital, which also made it the day that Teddy would move into Grimmauld permanently. Harry and Draco had both taken off work to be there and help him get settled in.
“Please, call me Harry,” he replied, remembering Draco’s advice about how Narcissa liked forthrightness. “I really would prefer it.”
“Oh?”
She was quite looking forward to the prospect of a rest, actually. It might be just what she needed to get into the mindset to socialize with dozens of people for a few hours.
choice, for her.” That was what Draco had been trying to say all along. There was no right and wrong, there was simply better and worse. She was trying to determine which was the better match, and which was the worse.
“And Ron’s mine.”
“Only if you’re up for it,” Draco said. “I’ve already made you work quite a bit this weekend, haven’t I?’
“I have a number of heirlooms that I’ve found while cleaning out the house,” Harry went on, deciding to go for broke. “I hope you will feel free to go through them at some point, and take whatever you want. I’ve told Andromeda the same.”
Harry closed his eyes in a slow blink of realization. “But I’m not sure I respect him as a person. He’s made some questionable, selfish choices in his life. Not just choices that I wouldn’t make myself, but choices I can’t understand anyone making. He has attitudes, too, about dueling, about his business. It’s about what serves him, not about what’s good for other people, for his students.”
“We broke our promise, about not using our past against each other.”
But the amusement was gone suddenly as she asked the question, and instead his entire face softened. “Because it proves how much I care about you.”
Harry followed the direction of his pointed finger and laughed. “Yeah, actually. Well-spotted. It’s uh… sort of a private joke, from the war. A bit hard to explain, really.”
“I’ll help wherever I can, then.”
“Great, “ Max answered, grinning. “I have a lot of other ideas for things we can do together.”
Potter grinned. “Inside the castle walls, of course I don’t. But between you and me, sitting right here, sure. Every teacher does, at least a little.”
Harry did know the one, although he disagreed with Ron’s assumption. “I think if it wasn’t every weekend, but only on occasion, she wouldn’t care. You just… this summer, when it was every day, it scared her.”
Draco cupped Kyle’s chin and kissed him soundly. “Adorable, actually. Fucking adorable, which I believe I’ve mentioned already.”
“I just think their first encounter should have been in a more private setting,” said Draco. “Not at a party, where everyone can see it.”
It was true. Draco had kept quite a strong professional and friendly connection with Lindsey over the years, though she was still based out of Toronto. They owled regularly, sharing thoughts on the latest potions research as well as the day-to-day details of their lives. Draco was especially thankful of this, since he had been worried early on that the short-lived but intense relationship he’d had with her brother would dampen their friendship permanently.
“But I love him,” she argued. “I don’t want to hurt him.”
“Malfoy is who Harry wants,” Hermione went on. “And if that’s who he wants then-“
. “What if I already spend a lot of time with her? What if I spend basically…
Scorpius shook his head. He didn’t much like that logic. They were best friends. Didn’t best friends tell each other everything?
“Hmmm… I’m considering it, at least,” Draco teased, and Harry decided to shut him up with his lips. Draco responded beautifully, pulling Harry flush against him and deepening the kiss.
He was barely out of the fireplace before he was pounced upon by a shrill and aggressive Pansy Nott.
“I’m just asking.”
Harry huffed a small, nervous laugh, grinning back at his soon to be husband. He then took a deep breath, looked down at the words he had read through a million times already, and began speaking, trying very deliberately not to rush.
“Perfect.”
“Sylvester is faking you out,” Harry said. “She lifts her elbow like she’s going to throw overhand and then she switches it up. She’s telegraphing her moves on purpose, so watch out for that. Erlich always aims for either side hoop, so keep that in mind.”
“He is,” Vesper said simply. “Anyway,” she pointed to the door, “I’m going to go grab some lunch from the food cart.”
“What would you like?” he asked Clint as the bartender waited in front of them, eyebrows raised in a silent question.
“Ah,” Neville said, batting the compliment away. “Hathaway did the most difficult bits. All the nighttime sprays, cleaning the leaves…”
Harry chuckled. “You know, if you’d taken a Muggle Studies course, you’d know all of this already.”
Harry snorted. “Yeah.”
They both had a good laugh at that image, and it was nice, to release some of that restless, excited energy. Draco brought Harry closer, so they were almost nose to nose.
“No,” Draco answered, because he had no bloody idea what a condom was.
“Hm, not great,” Harry replied.
He would find a way to wait, though. He would make sure that the timing was perfect.
magical.”
“Good,” she said, smiling at him. “At least you have
But the baby was not his. It was his best friend Blaise Zabini’s. And that was that. He was not going to raise another man’s child, not in those circumstances. The humiliation would have been simply too much to bear, far worse than being the first Malfoy in three centuries to divorce his spouse.
“We’ve been writing quite a bit,” the witch replied demurely, her cheeks not quite back to their natural shade of olive. “It’s all been very friendly, though. Nothing obviously romantic.”
her the impression that I… like her. And I do! I didn’t just ask her to make Em jealous. I wouldn’t do that. I was just talking to her earlier today and realizing how much I like being with her and how much we have in common… and that she’s… really pretty. I don’t know. I just had this thought that it would be so much simpler and more straightforward to date Aria than to try and date Em. The feelings are just a lot less… confusing, you know?”
“Feet, Potter!” Kemp called, before the program even started. “Stay off your heels!”
“Oi,” said George, nudging Harry with his foot. “You love us and you know it.”
“No one is spying on you.”
“Where shall we go?” he asked his feline companion. He was content to wander and let Samara be the guide, if she preferred.
Harry smiled softly. “That’s true.”
“Um, thanks,” Harry said, helping himself. He took a bite. “Delicious.”
“It’s just…” Malfoy began, and he shook his head. “Witches throw themselves at you, constantly, and you don’t even care.” He was still laughing.
“Yeah,” Draco said with a huff.
“It’s something I wish I were better at,” Clint murmured, after a moment. “But I don’t know how to be.”
“Here,” she said, holding the chart out to him. “They just came through.”
Harry laughed, his whole face brightening, and Draco grinned at him.
“What did she do?” Draco asked, his voice growing tighter.
Nixie thought that over. “No, you is probably right about that.”
“Harry. Harry. Harry.”
“Right. So the transition into sleeping together won’t be strange, but out of it… well… that’s when things get complicated.”
“Sure,” said Clint, grinning. “But we’re switching jobs. Let’s not risk burning the hand again.”
“And if you liked that,” Potter said, “then I would move closer, and I would touch you again.” Potter’s fingers were firmer on his skin now, flowing across his throat, letting it give way under the light pressure. Draco felt shivers begin at the back of his neck and dance down his spine before spreading outward, gamboling across every inch of his flesh in waves. He put a hand on Potter’s hip to steady himself.
, how it had all worked out somehow, even if it wasn’t in the way Harry had expected it to.  Harry let himself sneak in a few more kisses, after checking that Teddy wasn’t watching them, and both men were smiling widely when they finally pulled away.
The woman nodded and took a seat, a little farther from her son than she had been sitting before.
It took a bit of looking around, but he found her in the front hall, saying goodbye to an elderly couple, a longtime connection of her parents, that were calling it an early night. When she turned back and spotted him she looped an arm through his and guided him back down the hall, leaning in close.
“Can I ask you something…?” Draco trailed off, aware that the incomplete question would pique Harry’s curiosity.
“She was having an affair? That would make sense.”
“My story?”
“Hear that, Harry?” Draco whispered in Harry’s ear. “We even beat the brains of the Golden Trio. I believe this calls for a celebration.”
“And I also tried to remember that her husband was dying, and that’s an awful thing to have to go through,” he went on. “Whatever I feel about Vernon as a person, she loved him. She made a life with him. And it’s horrible to imagine losing that, losing that person. All I had to do was think about how painful it would be if something happened to you like that, and it was easy to find compassion.”
well, actually, if it was carrying Harry through the entire week in this mood.
Harry shrugged. “It was just a normal dive.”
Draco scowled. “I’m trying to concentrate, Harry,” he said.
“There’s no need to be anxious about it, Draco, honestly. It’s just for fun. If it doesn’t work and we don’t like it then we’ll move on. No harm done. I won’t be upset.”
Teddy writhed a little on Harry’s chest, perhaps in reaction to the spike in Harry’s heart rate that inevitably followed his looking upon Draco Malfoy those days. But Harry rubbed his back in little circles, and the baby calmed, going still again.
“Yes, he is quite clever,” Draco agreed.
His eyes widened. “Sweet Merlin. I really should find her, then. It was great talking to you, Kingsley.”
“Please.”
“Because she was my friend first,” Harry said, looking a little amused.
“Did I get it right?” he asked, out of breath.
“Mm,” Hermione agreed vaguely. Ginny had a point, though she also felt that a person didn’t have to “live for” being a parent to want to be one, or to be good at it. Still, Harry and Draco did seem particularly family-oriented. Ginny wasn’t, and Hermione and Ron found themselves somewhere in the middle. And that was all ok, really. “To each their own,” she said.
upset that you’ve broken up would be a bit of an overreaction, if he wasn’t already struggling with his previous breakup. You didn’t do anything so stupid as to tell him you loved him or anything.”
Harry liked the sound of that. “Always,” he echoed.
“Teddy?”
Draco shrugged. “I wasn’t sure anything would come of it.”
Harry had become one of his closest confidants that year. They’d shared both joy and sorrow; they’d confessed closely held secrets, revealed insecurities both trivial and deeply rooted. That wasn’t nothing; you didn’t find that with just anyone. So how could he be content to throw it away now?
Teddy shook his head. “No.”
“Yes,” said Draco. “You want a family. A child. Someday.” He wasn’t sure if it was relief or elation filling his chest with lightness. Probably a bit of both.
“Aurors… tortured people?” Vesper found that very hard to believe.
the quiet life,” said Ron. “I just don’t want it all the time. Besides, things are a bit quiet nowadays, since I’m not allowed into the field for another three months.”
He was kissing her at first, but as he started to move faster he couldn’t keep up with it. Soon his face was buried in her neck, his body shaking and frenzied, close to the brink.
“You’re here!” his office mate cried as he approached, jumping up from her seat to give him a hug.
“Harry? I mean, um… Mr. Potter?” came a voice from behind him. Harry turned to see one of the renovators, a dark, muscular wizard named Adam, the same one who had been giving Harry suggestive looks every time he was doing work at Grimmauld. He’d even found the man hanging out after work was done a couple of times, lingering longer than the others as if hoping to be invited to stay. Adam was making it perfectly clear, from Harry’s perspective, that Harry was welcome to bed him any time he desired.
He’d only managed to calm down once he remembered the way they’d left things that night. There’d been no awkward standing around in the entrance hall, seeing if the night would continue, no wondering if one was going to invite the other back to their quarters. As soon as they entered the castle Potter had clapped him on the shoulder and said, “That was fun, Malfoy. I’ll see you around, yeah?”
“Gods!” Draco barked out before biting his lip hard. He didn’t want to give Harry satisfaction just yet by admitting how sexy he found this experience already. He’d never be able to live it down.
“Want to try riding me?” the brunet asked him. “I’d really love to watch you take my cock.”
Ron brought a hand to his mouth, tapping his thumb on his lips as if considering this. Then his hand dropped to the bedspread, to the spot right beside him, and he patted it gently. “Sit with me,” he said. “Talk to me.”
Severus said nothing as Draco made his way to the hearth and opened the floo connection. Harry’s head and torso appeared, a grim expression on his face that immediately had Draco’s stomach plummeting.
They wandered over to Ron and George, who sat looking relaxed with bottles of butterbeer in their hands and chatting with a pretty brunette that Harry had to assume was Percy’s mysterious but apparently quite likeable girlfriend.
Hermione laughed quietly and gave Harry’s shoulder an appreciative rub. Harry had certainly become more socially gracious and politically savvy over the years, but she liked that he still maintained certain boundaries, so he never lost himself or fundamentally changed who he really was.
“I know,” Harry said, smiling softly. “But I wanted to bring it up anyway.”
“Thank you,” she said. She added a dash of cream to her tea and stirred it with a spoon before taking a sip. She paused a moment when she realized the tea tasted a bit sweet. Guensler must have prepared it with sugar instead of cream, the first time around. Her presence must have been making him more nervous than she realized. She shook herself. It didn’t matter. “Tell me more about what the burst sounded like.” She took another sip of tea before putting it down and returning her attention to her notes.
