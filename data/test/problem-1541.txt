'Go ahead, just keep away from Aria.'
Hogwarts wasn't Hogwarts anymore. That much was obvious, not even a week in, and everything that originally made Hogwarts was different. The Carrows were in charge of punishments and from what Ron heard he now guessed himself to be lucky to be handed detention with Hagrid in the Dark Forest. It had not stopped the hexes and jinxes from descending upon him whilst he walked the halls. How in Merlin's name had Aria coped all these years with it all?
'We have at least one thing on our side,' Theodore said, 'you - what you do now will impact the rest of Slytherin.'
'It's alright.' Luna said, 'Neville?'
what were their names again? - will not mind me joining you? Especially as your plans were already
Aria's hand went to her mouth, upon the moment she had pretty much opened the door and peered into the room. Tears welled in her eyes as she stepped forward, turning around to assimilate the room, her hand reached out, touching the tapestry nearest to her, then the hand clenched slightly as though she couldn't believe it.
Aria's mouth opened with realisation, 'Oh!'
Potter walked quietly beside him, through the halls of the Manor until they reached the dining room. He opened the door for her, receiving a small 'thank you,' from Potter when she passed.
It had been going too smoothly ... she should have known something would go wrong. Draco had been ... well ... sweet. He hadn't said a thing to upset her the night they went clubbing - he hadn't even remarked upon her sense of dress ... and she knew by the glares that he had been wanting to. An almost jealous Draco had been a revelation to watch from the normal sneering one she had known at Hogwarts. But that same person had said nothing ... nothing when - his cousins had implied that she was not good enough and that she had the indecency to fall for another Veela!
'Magic flows through our very veins, Aria,' Narcissa said. Aria nodded her acknowledgment, she knew that. 'I could sense it, your sorrow, the love you held, the pain you felt. The power you wielded. It was like a fire in your very soul. It felt familiar like I had felt it before. I realised why the moment I embraced my son after the battle.'
'Not strange at all,' Aria said, 'I'm his happy memory, he told me himself.'
"About how I will not be able to refuse this time." Draco gulped. "Sorry I woke you."
The heavy sigh and yawn made Aria look up from the book she was currently reading. Ron was looking slightly drowsy and his head was a mess from where he clearly had been running his hand through it, which caused Aria to laugh.
'Mother!' Scorpius hissed. Aria raised her eyebrows at her son.
It was a different voice to the one she had been expecting. Aria looked up and sure enough, Fleur was sitting in front of her and Aria had not even noticed.
Her favourite flowers are orchids.'
'No, the same one,' Draco frowned, 'I replied but I am yet to hear from Aria concerning tomorrow.'
'I'm certain,' Aria said, she was so close to Draco now, that she was able to press her lips to his ear. 'I'm a Malfoy.'
Aria felt like she was going to be sick. "Did you hear him? Wondering what a person would become if they ripped apart their soul."
To top it all off Draco was still swapping tentative glances with Aria and it was days after their first kiss. Draco discovered that Aria had a smile that she would only use after they exchanged glances. It was like having a secret that only the two of them shared.
As soon as the holidays were over, Aria headed straight for the library, a place she liked to stay away from if she could help it, but since Mr Ollivander had gone to all the trouble of teaching how the process of how wands were made, she couldn't get it out of her head. Magic sometimes was completely fascinating. Hermione, of course, often joined her, but Hermione in the library was not unusual, and her friend happened to be counting down the months - and by months Aria meant weeks or days - until the exams were due. Which meant Ron grumbled under his breath about not seeing daylight because he was spending his time indoors.
Draco was about to voice his opinion on that matter when he recalled the fact that he had indeed referred to their house as The Den. 'You mistake me if you think I'll allow our home to be called that retched name. I referred to it like that, because you have been doing almost since I took you to see it.'
Love? Well, that was new. But then she supposed he had just sworn to respect her, which meant he couldn't taunt her with his usual nicknames of Potty or Scarhead. It was so on!
Ron gave her an earnest expression. 'Not really.'
Aria hoped that if she took away the focus upon her recent row with Ron, and focused upon how helpful Ginny and Hermione had been - Ron might just not say anything.
'Good,' Alana nodded, and added seriously, 'hurt her again, and I'll learn every hex Hogwarts can provide me with, I'll even get Aria to teach me.'
'It doesn't matter,' Alana said adamantly.
'Oh, come on, Aria, you've got to sign up, everyone wants to see you in action -'
'Yes Grandmother, I am,' Draco said sincerely.
Draco held up his hands, 'No intentions of asking you do something like that.'
'I'm fine,' Aria said, 'absolutely fine, and I would have been even without your wings!' she snapped, 'now, however, is not the time for me to remind you, that you are an idiot. I need to get you to the hospital wing.'
Without a further word, Draco went in search of Blaise and Pansy. Feeling slightly proud that he left Weasley looking like he was caught between being sick and disgusted, and Granger gaping at them.
'It's not about Draco,' Aria said, 'You're going to have to get over it, I've forgiven him ... move on.'
Draco scowled at the sound of his friend's very frustrated voice, of course, he wasn't over it; Pansy should have known this, known him better by now. Draco felt so embarrassed, and although he had promised himself not to get worked up over his cousin's and Aria's magical compatibility, he couldn't help but do just that. Given how much time he had, he just had to make this year worth something, had to make it count.
"Aria, is it now?" he said sternly. "tell me the truth. The use of her first name makes me wonder if you've grown attached."
'Maybe Malfoy said something,' Luna said, 'to his father - after all Veela's only go for people truly compatible with themselves.'
Aria gave it a moment's thought, 'Fair enough.'
"Precious one," Aria said without looking at him. "I need to speak with Dumbledore."
'For what it is worth, I'm sorry.'
'She hates dark cramped spaces. Her favourite colour is blue, the type of blue you see on a clear sunny day. And she's a lot smarter than people give her credit for.'
'It's too soon!'
'Don't ... don't come near me,' Aria said her voice breaking as she spoke, she would not break down in front of everyone. She ripped the bracelet from her wrist and throw it at him, not caring who saw or heard the commotion she caused. 'Keep it, stick it where the sun can't shine for all I care. I want nothing ... nothing to do with you.'
Aria knew who it was even before he had spoken ... the feel of his magic, she had thought that he would have joined his friends like he usually did.
'McGonagall said I could go, not you. But thank you, for the offer.'
Voldemort sinisterly laughed, "Welcome home my precious one."
'He was also trying to teach you something else,' Aria added. 'As you progress in Potions, the more you'll find uncommon names or names you have never heard of before. It's all due to when the Potion was created. You can't just rely on knowing the common names for herbs. The older the Potion, the more you'll find it.'
'No!' Aria voice was firmer this time, 'I want you to tell me ... because if this is some weird way of breaking up with me -'
Aria frowned blinking slightly looking at the goblin-made bracelet, another outdated tradition had started the gift of receiving it off, surely that couldn't be a coincidence. 'Do some families still follow old traditions even if they have gone out of date?'
'Need to be won to bend to your will.' Aria said, 'so?'
"Does this make her happy?"
For the moment Ron was in the kitchen, alongside Fred and George, trying to make sense of the package he had just been given.
.......
They had always attracted each other's attention, thinking back on it, he should have realised it. He would have done things differently - very differently. Potter's magic was unlike anything else he had ever felt, it was pure, honest, timid, and at times dangerous. Her magic was a lot of things, but Potter when dangerous - that was not a good combination. And his own would respond to it, why else would he seek her out, like a lovesick puppy - taunt her, fancy her - Merlin he fancied her, dorky glasses an all. That had been the hardest thing to admit, to figure out.
'I love it!' Aria said, 'When can we move in?'
'Did you see Malfoy's face? Bloody brilliant,' Weasley said, laughing along with Finnigan who mimicked a look of sudden surprise, at his empty hand, as if to wonder why his wand was not there. Draco felt his cheeks flush with heat. Granger at least rolled her eyes clearly not amused by them, but it made his day noticing that Aria hadn't laughed.
'Oh, Mrs Weasley will be most pleased,' Potter said grinning widely.
The words whirled around in his mind as though he was committing them to memory, trying to intake just how they had been spoken. Of course, he hadn't minded spending time with Aria ... so why was his mind so fixated on three words? It's not like it had been the first time Aria had arranged to spend time with him. Draco had thought that naturally their time together at Hogwarts would be limited, they moved in different circles. And he gathered she would want to spend most of her time spending it with her friends ... but then, she had been the one to say it, those words ...
It looked no different - the teacher's table still placed in front of the four house tables, in the center was the throne-like chair that Dumbledore once used. It was one thing knowing that he was gone and another to actually see it. Aria looked around the Hall, so similar but yet so different ... the same Hall she had eaten meals in for so many years, and the same Hall that held all those lives they had lost in the final battle.
'After the ball.'
'Well according to the rumours - your relationship, is at an end. Potter wants nothing to do with you, and it's all due to how to treated her in Defence after your cousin ... well yeah .. after certain events -'
A squeal from his daughter caught his attention and the air itself shifted. Draco knew who it was without even looking, and his daughter ran off.
Aria nodded against his shoulder, 'We should head back.'
'If you need anything, just let me know.' McGonagall said, 'And if you wish to return, you may do so.'
Cygnus tilted his head downwards, and sighed deeply, 'I'm not proud of it - I should have been braver ... you see I found my compatible match. She's beautiful, and so caring like your Aria, but ...' Draco waited as Cygnus paused, Draco had sensed his cousin was far from finished. 'A Muggle-born witch.'
Shit. Aria would be a fool not to know the meaning behind the coloured roses Draco had chosen, he was literally saying I love you intensely and my intentions are honourable. She gulped a card that had come with the roses and Aria picked it up slowly, her hand trembled as she did. This card just two words, in the same neat handwriting; Forgive me?
But that had been after the Dark Lord's defeat - after Potter had saved him. If he had just figured it out, back when they appeared at the Manor when he felt his magic wanting to respond to that of her own. He could not explain why he wanted to protect her, why he wanted to wrap her up so she would be less frightened. It - it had alarmed him, he was uncertain, and he had no way of doing any of those things. Potter had escaped, along with her friends, and the next time they saw each other, had of course been the Room of Requirement.
'I resent that.' Aria did not need him to inform her of what he had been thinking, for she knew she wasn't exactly the most patient person.
'So naive.'
Ginny gave him a hopeful look. "So there is a plan after all."
'I haven't known him all that long, Aunt Marge.' Dudley said.
'Hi,' Aria mumbled shyly, Draco's hand was cupping her face lightly.
Aria would never forget, and she was just about to tell him so, when she caught Celena in the same corridor as them, 'That's what I've got you for, so you can remind me.'
'It is different for every person,' Fleur said, 'but mostly you should at least be able to sense or feel their magic - like a wave or an entwining.'
"It's the darkest of magic you can perform. That Slughorn was not kidding when he said it takes killing to be able to rip your soul apart. The only thing that can destroy them is something that would have no cure. But Seven pieces it is unheard of. You would need to destroy all of them before you took him on. The Dark Lord will not die otherwise."
'I've checked it over - you're all clear.' Bill said.
........
'I am not pouting.' Draco replied.
'You could always take the bracelet off,' Draco heard Granger say.
'How did Lupin teach you?' Draco asked, 'This spell was well above third-year level -'
Ron grinned mischievously, 'If it annoys Malfoy and keeps you happy, I'm in!'
'Could we - just - change the subject -'
'I can't bring myself to cry,' Aria turned so she could face Draco. She bit her lip. 'I can't help feeling that it makes me a bad person.'
'Her name is Aria.' Draco replied.
'I was going to tell Aria after dinner, as we were running behind,' Draco informed his mother. Aria glared at him.
'You should ... you could have informed me you were feeling unwell.' Draco said, 'You changed your hair ... it's down.'
Draco glanced towards Dudley and repeated what he had told their aunt. 'We haven't known each other long.'
'Yes you do,' Dudley said, 'I just wanted a quick word with Draco here.'
"Albania!" Aria said thinking. "Quirrell went into the Albanian Forrest, Hagrid told me that rumours believed the Dark Lord was in hiding there. And well Quirrell found him or the Dark Lord found Quirell more like."
'Yes thank you,' Draco said, 'I'll escort you to the room you'll be staying in - let you get settled -'
Draco turned to his father, this was all his fault, Aria had been disgraced within their very home and Draco had promised that she would not get hurt. Draco had been on the verge of saying something, but his father's bleak look stopped him, for once his father seemed at a loss for words.
So, no Dragon, my cousin Dudley and his girlfriend Emily, do not mind in the slightest.
'Who?' Draco demanded.
Aria shrugged, it wasn't like Draco didn't know what her new obsession was. He had been with her when she had created the very wand she had moments ago been holding.
"Let's get out of here before Snape comes," Ron said looking around the corridor wildly. "Seamus keep a lookout."
'You didn't have to do that,' he commented gesturing towards the fireplace.
'You're actually disappointed aren't you?' Aria breathed into his ear, 'I can tell by your pout.'
'The thing is, I'm fine. My aunt is dead and I'm fine.' Aria said against his shoulder. 'I can't cry. I should be crying, surely.'
The sound of the door opening made Draco spin around, Aria froze at the sight of the room, shock written upon her face. She looked at him in hesitation.
'Well that is good to hear,' Mrs Weasley said, though she still looked doubtful. 'Please, though Aria, please come to us if ever should you need it - no matter what is going on in our lives.'
Aria blinked, she was pretty sure she was giving off the impression of a deranged fish, with how she was opening and shutting her mouth. And she was pretty sure that she was caught in some kind of daydream, as Draco Malfoy would never - never - apologise, and neither would he call himself several words under the sun for being a jerk.
As for the form of payment, which I'm sure you'll need to acquire, I could forward this from our vault to yours,
Aria cringed, Voldemort had been calling her that since her capture, though always in Parseltongue. Aria was uncertain of the reason behind it, it wasn't in Voldemort's nature to be careful with his choice of wordings, so whether it was because she could understand Parseltongue that he choose to speak it or whether it was because it caused fear and shivers from his supporters. Aria guessed it might have been both, Voldemort after all craved power. What she couldn't understand was why he hadn't killed her. What this was all about? Unless it was some type of weird delayed gratification.
This time it had been Neville who received a message.
Aria returned to the page in her book she had been on.
"' ...saviour Aria Potter was rushed into Saint Mungo's in the late hours of last night ... the wizarding saviour, her condition is currently unknown, but it seems that those on the scene rushed to help, as Aria Potter symptom upon arrival was the lack of breath ... what could have put our esteemed hero in such a state or is the question whom ..."
'Draco has a point, Narcissa, let things be - nothing but the bonding now.'
'I still can't believe that after all these years Sirius's last "screw you" - actually worked,' Aria said, 'and that I just had to stumble across it.'
'Yes, I do,' Aria said firmly, 'Have you ever just heard someone's voice in your head when you read a letter or note that they've written? I hear Draco's voice every time, I can hear the way he would exactly say the words. I can picture his expressions as he spoke. If that's not loving him, I have no idea what is.'
'You can stay as long as you like,' Draco found himself saying, though it was unnecessary, perhaps she needed to hear it though for she responded with a soft thank you.
Not the question she had been expecting - most people knew exactly who she was, but the question about the platform meant it had been a first-year to ask - and if they just asked the first person they saw then most likely -
......
'What's the matter?'
'If you want to, that is,' Draco found himself adding as Aria's head and eyes had dropped to the table, he found himself approaching the table and taking the seat opposite hers, but he dared not reach out to touch her. 'It will help with your magical withdrawal -'
Weasley, Finnigan, Thomas, and Longbottom had spoken at the same time, their voices sounded ... hopeful, Aria looked at them sheepishly and shrugged as though it explained everything. Perhaps it did, for no one questioned her further on the matter, though, there were several exchanges of small smiles, and knowing looks.
'That's the first thing, you would never call him Draco, despite your engagement. He has always been Malfoy but since this whole compatible magic thing came to light, that's all changed.' Ron reasoned. 'You would have fought it head-on, you would have put up more of a fight than you have -'
'Well then let me take care of you.' Draco said, 'Like you deserve to be taken care of.'
Aria,
'Don't make excuses for him ... please,' Ron said, 'I can just about handle you agreeing to do this.'
'Because of Muggle-borns?'
"Do not think me a fool."
"And yet you carry her."
'I do apologise for not telling you sooner,' Draco added, noticing Aria's taut facial expression. 'Is something the matter?'
'Wait you know Aria?'
Draco shrugged, 'I didn't get it either ... but I think that mother - regrets a few of her previous choices.'
Aria raised her eyebrows.
Draco watched her walk away to her waiting friends, Weasley was looking at Draco like he was a bit of filth, nothing unusual, Granger hurried Weasley away with Aria following them.
'NO!'
'You sure know how to make someone feel better about themself.' Draco muttered sarcastically.
Aria frowned at the offending being that had jumped upon her for attention. Epsilon rubbed her face against one of Aria's hands. Definitely not a dream then. After several more nudges of her cat's head against her hand, Aria complied beginning to pet her. 'Alright fusspot, I got your point. But don't meow at me in dislike, when your fur ends up in a mess.'
The words had not been a question, or if he would study with her and yet not a demand to study with her. She had been asking him to study with her ... asking to spend time with her. That had to be it ... his mother had organised him to accompany her on the holiday and Aria had said he was invited to her birthday celebrations ... she had never asked him to go.
The only reason she knew it was Voldemort's main plan was that the news had been delivered to her two weeks before her return to Hogwarts: DUMBLEDORE DEAD. This news had caused a mass celebration. Voldemort seemed to be in a boastful powerful mood. And today she would learn why Snape had been tortured by Voldemort. They had gathered in the small hall once more, Voldemort and all his supporters.
'Draco's looking for you.' Hermione said softly. 'We had to tell him about the wand testing, or he would have searched the whole school for you.'
'Thanks for the platform ... and stuff.'
"Like I said there is no plan."
'Nifty - but I thought we couldn't use magic outside of school.'
Draco was stunned, just moments ago this girl had told him not to be judgemental, but then had implied it herself, he was so stunned, that he didn't correct her, and before he got a chance to, the girl had vanished from sight. Draco shook his head, replaced Aria's bracelet back into his bag, and went back to his letter.
'I agree with Aria,' Granger said firmly, 'I felt like I learned nothing.'
'And you've been able to perform the spell if I heard correctly, since your third year -'
'It already feels like your magic,' Aria said, eyes taking in all that she could observe, 'it's faint, but I can tell.'
"The cup and that locket."
'I know.' Cygnus said softly his wings and taloned hands disappearing, 'but I wasn't after Aria, Draco. I'm Indebted to her!'
'It appears we were thinking along the same lines.'
'Maybe the war made him take a different opinion upon everything,' Fleur concluded.
"What did it say?" Sirius demanded.
Nothing happened. Draco lowered his wand. Maybe he imagined it. Draco did not imagine the growling noise - nor as he looked towards the ground the snarling beast that was threatening him. A fox. Draco was not threatened in the slightest, but that did not mean he would step closer. Draco backed off several paces and tested the outskirts of their wards; everything was intact, satisfied Draco Apparated back to Malfoy Manor.
The door to her room opened again, and Aria hoped that the Healers had changed their minds. It turned out to be one better. Teddy Lupin was definitely the best thing to happen all day. Andromeda stopped in her tracks. Aria glanced at Draco who looked rather pale, Narcissa looked like she was seeing things whereas Lucius Malfoy looked how he always did. She wondered how long it had been since Narcissa Malfoy had seen her sister exactly ... Aria stood corrected ... the situation was now awkward.
'But we can't have,' Aria said, 'I mean, surely I would've noticed - would I have noticed?'
'No you're not,' Aria said frowning at him, with her I know better look. 'But I guess you more than made up for it - thank you, by the way, it's beautiful ...' her hand clasped at the silver chain around her neck, from under her coat and she pulled out the rubied shaped teardrop surrounded by diamonds; Draco's latest gift.
Chapter: Voldemort's Secret: Aria's Slytherins.
'But you are returning to Hogwarts, yes?' Mrs Malfoy said, Aria nodded, 'So you will have plenty of time to spend with one another, and not just over the rest of the summer. I expect you do as much or I will change my mind back to my original request.'
Draco glanced at his cousin again - not once had it been mentioned to him that Cygnus would be at Hogwarts.
Aria nodded, she had never known him to lie to her - usually because he knew things that she didn't and he liked to gloat about it in her face. Well besides the time he had told lies about her to the press but that wasn't exactly to her, so she didn't think that quite counted as the same thing.
Draco groaned, he should have suspected it, 'I'm not giving you any money, you utter Slytherin. You knew, somehow. I don't care if I can't prove it but I know you, and that smug look on your face Potter, you can wipe it off now.'
........
Aria nodded. She could do this. "Expecto Patronum!"
Draco's eyes told Aria, she wasn't exactly wrong as they darted all around to check where they all were, as he closed off his composure, but no one made a move towards them.
'I know, she informed me.' Draco said.
'Muggle-born?' Aria said, turning to the voice. The girl reminded her so much of herself. She looked so small, though her girl before her had tidy brown hair and hazel eyes.
'Leave it with me.' Draco said to Aria, 'Mother perhaps you could have a little chat with aunt Aster, inform her that her daughter is no longer welcome.'
'Call us even,' Aria said.
Well, that was surprising. Aria knew Voldemort better.
'Same for me.' Aria replied, 'I've gotten everything I had ever hoped for and so much more.'
'Also told him to stay put if he knew what was good for him,' Ron said, 'No offense mate, but I would not want to cross your path when you're angry. Just look at all of this -' he gestured back to the room, 'wouldn't stand a chance.'
Compatible magic. Draco snorted in spite of himself. Why did he have to be a Veela? Well, being Veela wasn't so bad, he supposed, girls falling at his feet he could handle. It was too bad that none of them had compatible magic with his own. No, it had been Potter. Potter whose magic matched his own, and apart from Granger, the youngest Weasley, Potter had been the only girl to not fall at his feet, and the only girl worthy enough of having compatible magic with him.
Draco waited, there had to be a point behind all the things Granger was informing him of, but Granger didn't elaborate. 'Why would she deny that her favourite flowers are orchids?'
It was in Rome that they started their coach trip and it gave Draco an excuse to closer to Potter than normal, though they had sat together side by side on the plane it was not for a long length of time He re-framed from rolling his eyes as Potter took the seat nearest to the window. It was like watching a child that didn't want to miss out on anything as she looked out of the window constantly. From Rome, they traveled to Pisa, then to Florence, then to Venice. Each time they stopped Potter's face would look around as if stunned by what she was seeing.
'And you live to tell the tale,' Aria laughed, 'I can't believe you - Dudley you went up against an of age wizard, you know that right?'
"To your dorm Miss Potter," Snape said sternly. It was weird being under Snape's protection rather than be at the end of his cruel belittling tone.
"Since getting the bracelet?"
'You went fucking Veela Malfoy, I had to put myself in front of you so you wouldn't harm them!' Aria said angrily, 'Gods, they're Muggles, one of which didn't know a thing about magic -'
"No clue. Do you reckon Aria sent it? It's not like she can talk to us any other way."
Unable to get away from Hogwarts until the end of term, because McGonagall was unlikely to grant him to leave now, Draco wasn't left with any option but to write Aria a letter. The question was, how did he start it? Love? She'd rip the letter the moment she began to read it - or worse the moment she got it. But he had to try. He found a secluded part of the library, took out some parchment, a quill, and ink.
Chapter: Christmas Presents.
"Muffliato!" Aria cast. "Hello, Professor."
"In the future, precious one, you will tell me if you require anything whether that is to train your protection so you feel safe to the robes you wear. I did not lie to you when I said that your safety was important to me."
On what must have been sheer instinct Aria's head turned towards him - the next thing he was aware of was intense emerald eyes, full of emotion; surprise, and something else he couldn't quite grasp.
"So six more find and who knows it might be less, the Dark Lord has trusted where he shouldn't have before."
"Severus."
"We're not stupid, Potter." Nott said, "you've never belonged to anyone."
'Not asking for much are you?'
Sirius looked bemused, but Ron laughed. There was a plan. Aria was spying and Dumbledore's Army was reinstated. Ron's coin went warm in his pocket. He grabbed at a quill and ink. Scribbling down the message.
'I'll get out my violin for you,' George said.
'I thought you got along,' Blaise said, 'you certainly did when you were younger. Did you not know he was going to be here?'
Draco nodded.
our reservations, so we could add you, it seemed that there might have been a system error.
'He can't have changed that much!'
Aria had reached him on the podium now, she stood rather awkwardly waiting for whatever announcement was to come.
'What is - was something the matter?'
Draco waited outside for the Great Hall to clear out, as Aria lifted the magical squares so that the Great Hall could be returned to normal for dinner.
if you just accept my offer. As for the Muggle Passport, you need this so you can
'You owe me nothing!' came Aria's voice from behind them, Draco turned surprised at the sound of her voice, he hadn't even heard the sound of her apparating and held at her wand point was his other cousin Celena, 'But if you really want to repay the debt, could you deal with her -' Draco took in Aria's appearance, she looked frazzled and there was a small graze on her cheek.
The loud sounding crack made Draco jump for he was not expecting it, neither had he been expecting for the person who had just Apparated to land so close that they caused them both to fall over, Draco's arms reached up automatically around what had fallen on him - or rather who. His eyes, which had closed, shot open and his breath caught in his chest as he found himself staring straight into familiar pools of emerald green eyes. Eyes which were embarrassed and blood-shot.
Aria nodded and regretted it the moment she did. 'My head is pounding away constantly ... I feel cold all the time.'
'I thought it would ... go away. It did last time.'
'I -you -er.'
She thought that maybe she was trying to look for things, that Malfoy was up to something. Then she thought she most likely was doing so because Malfoy had so far stuck to his oath. Aria had done a bit of reading up on magical oaths - which it turned out to be different from vows, the intent was the same - just without the death of the person who took it broke it. Though somewhat pleased Malfoy wouldn't die if he broke his oath, it didn't settle her worries.
'Piss off ... Goyle!'
'How are preparations with my mother coming along?' Draco asked though he had input on their upcoming bonding, Aria deserved to have a bonding she wanted - though somethings Draco was unable to provide her with, like not having the bonding at the Manor. The deep sigh and the frustrated groan had not been the reply Draco had expected.
'Neumann?' Blaise laughed, 'you think this is about Neumann putting you on your arse. Man, Draco, open your eyes. It's about you!'
"We'll swear oaths. We want an end to all of this."
"Before she went into hiding, we reckon. Came through the fireplace and disappeared two-"
Indeed she was, Scorpius groaned and stretched out his hand to take Adelaide's hand, and Draco glanced at his wife, who was looking at their son, with a knowing look on her face, one which reminded him of the time his mother had when she had informed him of her life debt plan. Draco rolled his eyes, somethings he gathered, just like some debts and bonds were just best left alone, just like how Draco would always be indebted to his wife for providing him with a life, he had been gravely concerned that he would never get to have with her. Draco, however, was so grateful that Aria Malfoy had given him that chance.
"Well, the seventh piece would be the Dark Lord's body."
'Yes, well, it will be held here - mostly father's family as mothers-'
'Draco you are distantly related ... and she has always had a soft spot for you.'
'You know,' Aria said gently as she raised up her throbbing foot, 'you should consider Healing for a career. I'm feeling loads better.'
'I'm Alana, Alana Williams.' the girl frowned, 'If this is the way to the platform - then why are you just staring it, why haven't you gone through yet?'
"It was knowledge that he wanted from the Ministry Aria. A Prophecy to be exact. That holds the reason why he tried to kill you in the first place. And he thought it would destroy you. For it says that you have a power he knows not. But you cannot survive whilst the other lives. The full prophecy if you wish to hear it is amongst one of my memory vials."
'That's the major difference between our point of view of Hogwarts,' Aria said, 'Your home was always the Manor, even during the war - though I suspect it wasn't as much of one then - but you still view it as home.'
Blaise gave him a sudden look of understanding. Theodore just raised an eyebrow. Then there was a sudden shout, that almost made them jump -
'Well you'll be pleased that least one female student isn't falling for his Veela charms,' Blase said, 'and she is looking as popular as ever.'
It was not her fault that the Floo Network just hated her. No matter how many times she had used it now ... she'd always come out - well fall out - covered in soot.
Draco sighed heavily, running a hand through his hair, 'What's it going to take to get you to call me by my name again.'
'Normal way?'
'Oh like how you did?' Aria pointed out, glaring at him again. Draco had conjured a bowl and some cotton wool, and he summoned a potion non-verbally, which he poured into the bowl.
'Did you?' Hermione said, the rest of her question went unasked, but Aria having been her friend for years knew what she had been thinking.
'You heard me - stay away from her - I know what you are doing! I know what you are up to! You are unworthy -'
Doors were opened and slowly students starting to disembark from the Express onto the platform. Draco caught sight of the striking blond hair, his son one of the tallest in the crowd due to the fact that he happened to be in his last year. The family resemblance between them was uncanny if only the same could be said for -
But Blaise proved to be rather frustrated by Draco's divided attention - because one should always ... always ... keep an eye on their work in Potions - so the next chance Blaise got, which happened to be outside Defence Against the Dark Arts, Blaise took matters into his own hands.
'Thanks,' Malfoy said, his grey eyes searching hers out, and she could see the honesty within them, 'Aria.'
'Never said you were!'
'I didn't want to worry you,' Aria said softly, she hated the look of disappointment Mrs Weasley was currently giving her. 'Any of you ... you have your own things to be worrying about. You don't need me to add to it. Besides, it's only for a year. I can handle it, I can handle them.'
Before he could even take a breath, Dudley jumped in to speak.
'What you two talking about?' Theodore said having returned from a nearby store, 'Looks serious.'
'Carl Webster?' Draco confirmed, 'The Hufflepuff -' he trailed off, causing both Pansy and Blaise to snort at him, some habits were hard to break. 'Well, he's not very good at defense now is he?'
'I'm waiting, Aria.'
'Well my question for you Miss Potter, to help the rest of the class with their homework on finding a memory that what works is, what were you thinking of in the moments when you very first cast your corporal Patronus.'
"What happens next? Because the Dark Lord has a whole army out there waiting to kill us, especially if he finds out about this," Zabini said.
'And you're talking like her too ...'
'You look ravishing- but Aria are you sure you wish to go out dressed as you are now?'
Narcissa sighed, 'What was said exactly?'
So Voldemort was checking in on her. Ron thought. Things were becoming much clearer. There was a plan. But no plan that Aria would or could tell him personally. And he felt hurt by that knowledge. She clearly trusted Hermione even though Hermione was not at Hogwarts for how else were the messages being communicated to them in the first place. Ron would do as he had been asked. He would wait for the plan. For now, all they could do was damage control. Ron's hand trembled slightly as he picked up his fork. He fucking hated the Cruciatus Curse. He hated the Carrows even more.
Now if only she could figure out where she was going to take them both.
'I know what this means -' Aria said, holding up her wrist to show the bracelet upon it, 'I know what you are - I know that this is only given by - why didn't you just tell me to begin with?'
'In the garden,' Aria said, 'I've told Draco I wouldn't and could not stand having the wedding inside the Manor itself, like his ancestors ... not after - all that happened. The garden was a good compromise. Narcissa is already talking about taking me shopping for my dress, I turned her down as a one on one, told her she'd be more than welcome to come with us.'
"The solution to your problem is here with us," Voldemort said casually, returning to the matter at hand. "Draco has graciously accepted the task of being your guard. The bracelet you now wear is part of a pair. The other attached to Draco. He is now responsible for you."
'Of course, I did.' Aria said her cheeks still burning from all the attention.
Aria blinked, she had not realised she had gone off into her own world. 'Sure, umm thanks.' Aria stuffed the letter into her bag and left McGonagall's office with a final nod.
'Well, this changes everything!' Ginny said, 'You do realise Ron's going to go nuts, right?'
"I hear that you were attacked on your first night here." Voldemort said, "I wish for you to tell me what happened."
How dare he! If Blaise had not tugged on his arm, Draco was sure he would have shot to his feet in outrage.
"Your guess is as good as mine right now," Ron replied. He hoped it was from Aria. Hopefully, once they cracked the message it would explain what was going on.
Mrs Weasley had come here, to Grimmauld Place, with everything that was going on. Ron had gone away with Hermione to Australia, after the funeral, so she knew that it wasn't him, that had brought her best friend's mother here.
'If you're sure,' Dudley said, 'I'll head back to bed.'
'You expect me to believe that!' Draco said, turning to the flames beginning to go out thanks to his parents' quick work. 'You've been after Aria since meeting her, you humiliated me in lessons -'
'Only cause you obliviated her memory -'
'I'm on patrol,' Draco replied feeling disheartened.
In reality, she felt like she couldn't, that turning back and hiding under her bed-covers was now the best option. But she was a Gryffindor ... she was Aria Potter ... if she could face down dragons, trolls, Boggart-Dementors, Dementors and breaking into Gringotts, Voldemort and everything else she had done to face down Voldemort, she could run through a barrier that shielded platform nine and three-quarters from Muggles.
She finally learned where she was being held, hostage. Malfoy Manor. For her safety, Voldemort had claimed Aria had been moved to Draco's suite. Draco took his usual room and Aria had been shown the guest room. The first couple of days had been awful, awkward passing of morning greetings with Draco, then spending her days trying to dodge the oncoming hexes so that Draco wouldn't be hurt.
'You fixed it!' Aria muttered.
'We'll arrange it for the weekend after then Aria,' his mother said, 'normally your family would be invited to join us but Muggles have never-'
No, Aria wasn't. Trusting she may be, that did not make her naive. After all, why would she question a letter from Narcissa?
Draco looked into her green eyes, which showed a bit of hesitancy. How could someone that could be so brave be so unsure of themselves?
"What makes you think we can be trusted."
The Manor halls were empty, this was no surprise to Aria, Draco practically had a whole wing to himself, Aria had discovered that much, it made her grateful that the home Draco had brought for them was much smaller in comparison - she dreaded to think how lonely Draco had been as a child, even though he had things and friends to occupy him. But the empty rooms and hallways, there was nothing bright about them. So some part of Draco must have been lonely.
"The memories have meaning to them. I took a great risk in getting that Pensieve and Dumbledore's memories down here." Aria said. "He told me to be careful with whom I trusted the information with Draco."
'I'm still pissed at you!' Aria said.
Aria began to read, alongside Granger, the Gryffindor boys, started talking amongst themselves, Finnigan providing the entertainment.
'I was cleaning - it's all been cleared, just a cough left. Healers said I'll be able to home in a few hours - besides I thought you'd be in Diagon Alley - you said you were going to meet up with friends.'
Draco knew an accusation when he heard one, especially when it came from The Dark Lord. "We've been completing our homework, it is NEWT levels we're studying for, I wish to be prepared. Aria accompanies me -"
'For now?' Draco repeated, 'Sounds like you're going to take full advantage of this.'
'I don't get it.'
Aria shrugged, 'Just thought I'd return the favour and be honest with you.'
'And still doesn't!' Draco snapped back.
you'd upset me terribly.
Hogwarts was packed, normally after the exams where over students could relax and bask in the sun summer. Draco was managing to do one of those things, being outside enjoying the sun, Aria had long ago nestled herself against him. It still amazed Draco that Aria was completely relaxed in his presence ... despite their past, despite all that happened between them, Aria was truly comfortable. Part of Draco wished that their complementary magic had nothing to do with it, but then he knew he would not have what he did now at this very moment in time. But when Arias magic felt as it was now, so at ease, Draco too relaxed. He saw no reason not to, after all this had been Aria's idea, and this way it gave Draco a view of the other competitors, as sections of the castle grounds had been cleared for dueling practices.
'He was showing the class that dueling doesn't always begin with a bow, Draco,' Theodore said.
'Can you believe she's engaged to that ... scum of a Death Eater?'
Aria was a force like no other. She barely slept, being kept so busy. Running around forming a secret Army. Training Crabbe and Goyle to defend her, well enough so The Dark Lord could be pleased with their progress but also enough that students could defend themselves from Crabbe and Goyle. Aria Potter should have been placed in Slytherin. Draco closed the curtains with a flick of his wand when he noticed her nose started to twitch. The offending sunlight kept at bay. Draco hoped this would allow her to sleep longer.
Anger boiled inside Aria, she had been so stupid. Just why hadn't she thought to read up on magical debts? A life for a life. The life-debt could not be repaid in the way Mrs Malfoy had asked for it to be. Hot tears hit her cheek, how was it possible that a letter from Dudley of her aunts' death did not bring this result, but Draco Malfoy could.
'On the contrary my dear - you are far more indebted to her than you think. We all are.'
Aria Potter in one word was formidable. Draco savored the moment, taking in her sleeping form, Aria had crashed out on the desk next to him, just a few hours ago whilst they were doing their potions homework. The Christmas break had now arrived, not that it felt much like Christmas with Voldemort still ruling his home. However, Draco would take the small victories. They had a plan to harm the Carrows just enough so that they would never roam the halls of Hogwarts in any way ever again or at least he hoped the plan was underway. Aria was certain that by now someone in what she called Dumbledore's Army had worked out the coded messages. Rays of the morning sun peeked through the open windows, illuminating Aria and making her look like a goddess. Draco allowed himself the freedom of brushing her fringe back from her scar. His intended. The crazy plan muttered and agreed with his mother in the darkest of the night to keep Aria safe. There was a time he thought he would not have cared. Now he can't stand the thought of losing her.
Anger was forgotten, her frustration gone, for Draco had her at his next word; 'Hello.'
'You and Malfoy have it,' Fleur said.
Chapter: Conversation with a Portrait.
Ron sighed, heavily, his gaze never left hers. 'Are you sure you want this? Are you sure that he loves you? Are you sure that he is not going to hurt you?'
There was a flash of green within the fireplace and Potter stumbled through. Was she always this uncoordinated? She pushed her glasses back onto her face. Draco snorted at her soot-covered appearance, where had she come from to be covered like this? She glanced up at him, glaring intensely at him. Draco coughed awkwardly, unsure now what to do or say. Potter looked down at her appearance, gave an exasperated sigh, and pulled out her wand, with a flick the soot vanished, and another towards the fireplace, the soot disappeared from the floor surrounding the grate.
Aria understood though she said nothing as they walked into the dining room. Dinner had once again been laid out for them.
'Ron and I will - check on things,' Granger turned to Weasley, 'Won't we, Ron.'
The question had not meant to be for their ears.
"Well, it's in our best interests that he doesn't," Ophelia said firmly.
'Ron, I am not making excuses ... just giving you my opinion.'
'I've heard it,' Aria hissed once more, 'now quit wasting time as I said, you're not welcome here.'
'Says I'm not eating enough -'
"I understand clearly."
"Been guarding this room each night," Draco replied not looking at her.
Aria bit her lip, and shut her eyes tightly, 'You don't understand Draco, I don't think I'm ever going to. It's Dudley I feel for more than anything.'
"He has no use of it, I don't see why not."
'You had no choice - not what you told us to begin with, but the truth got out in the end.'
'It is strange, Miss Potter because the first wandmaker was in fact a woman.'
Ron thought about it. It made so much sense. Aria had realized that Voldemort would go after The Order members. None of The Order members close to Dumbledore were working now. And the ones that were, couldn't send messages via Patrnous's freely.
'Yeah, I like the sound of that.'
'Then he should have done something!'
Aria stared at her, wondering what she could possibly mean.
Draco laughed, actually laughed, his eyes sparkled and Aria could feel his magic buzzing ... she could get used to the way it shielded her. 'That is devious ... utterly devious. I would never thought you'd have something like that in you.'
'Now do you still wish to go?'
Aria ducked her head turning away, clearly thinking along the same lines ... the last person they both wanted to speak of was Bellatrix Lestrange.
Draco emitted another sigh but said nothing. There was so much Aria had not told him, she considered telling him what it had been like, to try and make him understand, however, his magic calmed hers, and she relished in it.
Malfoy was staring at his arm in disbelief, 'I - I tried everything - how - how did you do that?'
'Well not completely,' Aria said, 'But you should have told me about the announcement!'
Aria laughed, glad to have been taught for once by Snape. 'That's because it's a trick question. Tropaeolum is a herb, that is commonly known as nasturtium.'
"My Lord." Snape bowed low. He had brought a young teen-aged girl with him. A girl who had dark hair like Aria and dark eyes that looked so much liked the Potions masters.
'I was looking for you,' Aria said, feeling much calmer than before. The urge to hex something had disappeared the moment she heard his voice. It was wonderful how calming just from his sheer presence alone made her relax.
'No, it's got nothing to do with Goyle bugging the hell out of us.' Ron said, and his head turned slightly, a frown etching his facial features. 'I'm far more concerned about you -'
"After all learning all this, do you still think Dumbledore is not a fool?"
The information stung, Aria had not told him that. That was until the girl said.
'I don't know how long it will last for,' she said, 'so I might have to redo the Charm - but at least now, you won't have to hide your arm or face any awkward questions.'
In the next instant time froze as Aria's green eyes met the stormy grey eyes that belonged to Draco. She had never noticed that about him either, how stormy his eyes were. The air itself seemed to shift and Aria was unsure on whether it was Draco's magic that made the air intensify or whether it was something else entirely. But then it seemed to not matter how the air felt warm, for nothing else mattered, as Aria was swept up in Draco's magic as it wrapped around her providing its usual blanket of protection. Nothing mattered as lips brushed her own; almost ghost-like - the stormy eyes searched her own, for what she could not tell, and then Draco's lips found hers again. Forget about time freezing; Aria felt like she was melting or drowning, but then she chose to forget everything she was thinking and allowed herself to absorb the moment.
'You!' Aria said in mocked outrage, 'I thought it was rather good actually.'
'I'm trying to fix that.'
Aria took a deep breath. "Dumbledore is no fool!"
Aria took a breath, as the students turned towards her, Draco wondered what on earth she had been planning to do.
'With a bit of care and attention, it might not be -'
'Are you not?' Draco said, stepping to walk beside her, leaving the Entrance Hall.
The magic surrounding her became suddenly warmer. Yes ... she could get used to his magic and the shield it wrapped around her.
'Doesn't stop me from feeling guilty.' Aria said earnestly.
After weeks of hearing about the last activity Aria assembled together for inter-house unity, Draco decided enough was enough, and by the looks of it so had the rest of Hogwarts, as it looked like the whole school had turned up. The numbers were so vast that McGonagall had postponed the meeting for an hour so they could rearrange the Great Hall.
'Insane woman.' Draco said to himself, as he drew his wand up to test the last foundations of the house wards. Satisfied that the house was guarded, Draco made his way around the grounds. Their back garden was more like a yard, the dense woodland area at the edge of their lands, and of course the lake, the wards if Draco had placed them correctly - which he was very confident that he had - would stretch to the end of their property. When he reached the trees that were the beginning of the woodland, Draco heard a rustle amongst the leaves.
Draco charmed music to sound throughout the room, 'Well my lady, as I said, you did ask ... now would you care to dance with me, we're hardly going to get cold, so I don't see why not.'
'I -' Draco paused, 'regret that - it was stupid ... thinking I could do it all on my own - letting the others into the school - worse mistake of my life.'
'Just tell us, or ask us, whichever it was,' Draco said.
Aria snorted, 'I think you're just looking for any old excuse ...'
Aria smiled gently at her, 'That compatible magic is not as complicated as it seems.' Lily frowned, looking a little lost. 'You'll understand when you're a bit older. Let's go home.'
'I believe my lady that this belongs to you,' Draco said leaning across her to place it on the unit.
'I'm sure they do not blame you in any way.'
His mother turned her head away and sighed, 'this was not how I wanted you to find out ... I was going to tell you, once you had gotten used to Aria. I know you despise the girl Lucius - but I'd thought you'd be adult enough - what happened to our family coming first? - I'd thought you'd see past -'
Mrs Weasley's hand squeezed her shoulder, 'You're looking a little pasty, are you coming down with something?'
Aria still did not understand why Draco had bound himself to her in this way. It was very clever though. An outdated Pure-blood declaration of courtship that honoured the betrothed. Whilst Aria wore the bracelet, she would be protected because any curses would be deflected towards Draco. But a very clever idea indeed, Voldemort would not understand the true meaning behind such an outdated custom.
Kindest Regards,
Draco Malfoy.
Draco groaned, 'Well Aria Malfoy, I wait for the day that it is official with such anticipation and longing, for you deserve a bonding until then Potter let's get going before I change my mind.'
'OK ... I might have ... threatened him.' Dudley said, looking slightly sheepish.
Aria sat herself down and gave Draco a look of determination, 'OK, tell me.'
"Maybe three minutes later. Verity caught a glimpse of her, but she was gone once we got there. Just this package in her place."
Aria was placed, and by placed Aria was shoved into the spare room she had often used at Malfoy Manor by her new mother-in-law, the moment she appeared. She didn't even give Aria a chance to question Narcissa in regards to what happened with Celena. Perhaps it was for the best that she didn't know after all ... but still, Aria had wanted to see what the gardens now looked like considering Draco had little time to reput everything together and replace what had been destroyed by the fire.
Aria groaned, no this year the whispers were not subtle at all. She hated it ... why couldn't people just stay out of her business? ... What was it to them? Why did it matter to them? It wasn't their lives it affected... no, it was her own.
Aria shook her head, what had he been thanking her for again? Oh, yeah, she had nodded, her body reacting of its own accord in her sleep-like state.
'That's Slytherin for - I know you're right but I'm not going let you think that.' Aria retorted smugly. 'It makes sense though, if you think about it, it's bound to have lots of animals living around it like badgers, foxes which happen to live in dens. Rabbits - but that's warrens and deers live in thickets-'
'I see you've been chatting to Granger.'
'So did you find them? - OH-' Aria said staring at the sign, with realisation.
'Most likely wasn't so toxic when he set it up -' Bill said, 'some of our products can become toxic over time -'
'Yeah, when I said, friends, I meant the term loosely,' Potter replied, 'I'm going away with my cousin and his girlfriend, we're going to go skiing for ten days, travel to America for another ten days, we wanted to do a huge tour of Europe but Emily couldn't find enough - funds. So we're doing a small couch trip and seeing some of the main sights.'
'Now you're distracting me,' Draco said, eyes still closed, 'I can feel your amusement, care to share, or is the sight of me struggling that hilarious.'
'Of age?' Dudley said.
'Of course, I am,' Aria said, 'I'm a Malfoy after all.'
'She'll have to get through the wards first!'
'Doesn't matter ..'
"Before we were not intended."
'That I knew I could do it because I had done it before,' Aria replied with a sweet smile upon her face, 'sometimes it takes more confidence by knowing you can do something to be able to do something. So yeah - my thoughts were I knew I could do it.'
'I'm of age - so I'm allowed.' Aria said, 'you should be fine from here - see you at Hogwarts.'
'What?'
travel like a Muggle, we will not be able to go anywhere without them otherwise.
'Well after the engagement news ... I thought people wouldn't have a very good opinion of me.' Aria said, 'Not that I care - I've never had anything to prove to everyone anyway.'
'Finnigan's put his name down.' Pansy said, 'And Thomas. Corner and Boot from Ravenclaw, I think they were a part of that group.'
'What is so strange?' Aria said not really understanding.
She should have suspected nothing good would come off, Professor Neumann informing them, of a dueling challenge. As they had learned the counter-spells to the hexes and minor jinxes that they had learned, Professor Neumann had thought that it would be a good ice-breaker. Aria thought better of joining in with how tired she was feeling.
'How do you mean?' Ginny asked.
'Yes, I managed to,' Aria said, 'Only one so far, took me ages to figure it out - even though I had help to understand the magic behind it.'
'Everyone has been asking me that since we've returned, my mind is not suddenly going to change. I'm not competing.'
'Oh don't be so surprised, I'm just as cunning as you are,' Aria replied kissing his cheek, 'My boldness and bravery won out, the rest is history.'
'Yeah, she is,' Draco said.
Aria snuck out in the middle of the night again. She had been trying to guess the Headmaster's password. And she had succeeded. Sherbet lemon indeed. Such a sneaky Slytherin.
Mrs Weasley just had to use the don't mess me with tone. Aria cursed at herself, she should have gone over, been quicker. She should have thought that Malfoy would pull something like this.
"Another one came."
Aria glanced up from the Ancient Runes book that she been going through to find out the engraved meanings on the bracelet, of course, Draco would have figured that she would have done some research into duels and found that magical items - such as the traditional Veela gift Draco had given her were banned. So without any hesitation, she put the bracelet back on - it made her feel rather smug being provided with a way out of this tournament. Which meant he would have also figured that she was looking into their meanings. Draco looked curious, he wasn't at all upset with her.
Draco shook his head at the letter, of course, she wouldn't want to face a crowd. He should have realised that ... after learning about her nightmares. He smiled slightly to himself ...as he read the letter again, the letter that had come just four days ago; the longest letter he had received so far from Aria. She had been much more open with him since the ball ... and he had known something had upset her - he had felt her magic after all, though he was sure it was more than a mere headache - it had been the look his mother had gave him before she left, that had been the reason he didn't question Aria further. Aria's letter had not been the only one he had received ... with the return to Hogwarts fast approaching ... several of his fellow housemates that had chosen to return also had got in touch with him. He figured as Aria did not want to step into Diagon, that he might as well meet up with a few of his fellow housemates.
"I'd rather have my goddaughter back and out of Voldemort's slimy hands," Sirius said. "I don't get why he hasn't killed her. What made his plan change. So with this new form of communication-"
'I'm Aria Potter,' she said shrugging it off, 'normal rules don't seem to apply when it comes to me.'
'This is Draco, dad,' Dudley said, as the man's eyes narrowed upon him.
Aria bit her lip, well this was awkward - wait ago Aria, just had to pick a touchy subject.
'I actually like that.' Aria said blinking at him a little, as though combining the names so simply would not have occurred to her. 'Now I best get on over to The Burrow the Weasleys are expecting me. I'll see you in a couple of days.'
'Yeah, they tend to be a small bundle of fur, have whiskers, and say meow.' Aria rolled her eyes.
'What changed - you two seem rather close -'
'Of course, you're not, forgive me, I shouldn't have said that,' Ron said, shaking his head, 'just - be careful please Aria, you're like family, I don't - I can't stand to see you get hurt.'
' ... as I was saying magical bonds can develop over a number of things. The types you'll be most aware of; the bond between wand and wizard, compatible magic ...'
'I can't believe you actually spent three weeks - three weeks - with - with -MALFOY!'
Draco blinked at that, he thought given how things were, that it had been Cygnus.
Speaking of how amazing magic can be, it came in very handy when we went to change
'No, he didn't,' Aria said, glad for her friend's support, well technically there was no Ron as this was a girly night. Aria had invited Hermione, Ginny, and Fleur around, Grimmauld Place felt empty and rather lonely after having spent so much time in other people's company.
'So you don't dislike Slytherins?'
'Aria ...' Draco stammered, 'spoke up for us?'
"I know."
Draco had known this would be awkward for his friends to accept ... but there wasn't much choice in it - Aria had been his match and his family stood by the old values - it was worse for a Veela as they only choose those they had true compatibility with. 'We're still getting to know one another ... and she's made me realise that Muggles aren't as bad as we were led to believe - that they're not dirty ... well, you know...'
'Right so as we've discussed, the Patronus Charm relies upon a powerful happy memory and takes concentration, now Miss Potter -'
'I was going to use it.' Aria said.
as you'll most likely be aware, I've not had many dealings with Muggle money before. Could you advise on
'Everyone is on it!' Aria exclaimed, 'Teddy, Andromeda, Tonks, Remus. Even Sirius! The Weasleys', my - my parents. I love it - I absolutely love it! I can't even begin to tell you what this means to me.'
The only privacy Aria had was when she was within the guest room of Draco's suite. Draco never left her side. She didn't really understand why he would choose to protect her and what the deal was with the bracelet she now wore.
Aria winced at the harsh tone, she was not surprised by it really - slightly startled that the harsh tone had come from Ginny but not surprised. The whole - I'm engaged to Draco Malfoy and you've got to nice to him conversation had not gone down well. Even if the said engagement was for a year.
'Sometimes,' Hermione said shaking her head, 'Just sometimes, I forget that you should have been placed in Slytherin.'
Now that, the holiday matter has been settled, Mother has bestowed a request upon me,
It seemed to be working, his father stabbed at his food, and Draco was glad he had sat between them now. Potter's magic was brushing against his again. Though he could not tell what she was feeling this time, he had no doubts by the smile upon her face, and the glint in her eyes, as into what she was feeling.
'I'm not going to force her, but I will tell her,' Draco found himself saying, from what he remembered the Weasleys twins were not to be messed with unless one wanted to land up on the wrong side of a prank, and even if it was only one of them, Draco did not want to take any chances.
She sighed as one of her hands came to rest against her forehead. This had been going on for the last couple of weeks, she would find herself waking up abruptly in the middle of the night as though she had woken from a terrible nightmare. When in fact ... it was just the opposite, her dreams and been pleasant.
'And to the person who did more, gave so much and is now trying to help create a place that holds no animosity. Aria if you could just come to the stage for a few moments.'
Aria groaned frustratingly, even when he was right he knew how to tick her off. She willed for the ground to swallow her up, or at least be able to go home, but she doubted she'd be able to Disapparate from the Manor grounds without his help, for she knew their wards had been changed, it was why she had used the Floo when she had visited them. She thrust her hand over, pointedly not looking at him.
'Don't worry, you can still hex him if this still all blows up in my face.'
'Potter would you kindly escort Draco to Hogsmeade. Only Pansy and I both have plans.'
'Goyle?'
'You can blame his father for that!' Aria said as they walked through the magical barrier separating platform nine and three-quarters from platforms nine and ten of Kings Cross.
When he noticed Aria looking around off into the distance in signs of Dudley and Emily's arrival, Draco got out of the pool.
'No,' Aria said, 'Oh, actually, could someone make sure Kreacher has fed Epsilon.'
'But you still decided to say something?' Blaise said, and Draco watched his friend's hands massaging his temple, 'I swear Potter's usual attitude of not doing the smart thing is rubbing off on you!'
'Aria!'
Aria looked away feeling slightly awkward - even without the words she knew which event Ron had been talking about; her apparent death.
'I can manage.' Draco said, walking around to the other side.
'Oh there's a lot you don't know about me, Dragon,' Aria winked at him, causing a little heat to rise in his cheeks, the next words were out of her mouth before she could stop them, 'study with me.'
Aria bit her lip, 'For what it's worth I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the death trap.'
'Excellent Miss Potter, twenty points to Gryffindor.'
"Why do you believe they would attack you on the first night?" he questioned
'I was thinking of getting you an emerald to match your eye colour, but as ruby happens to be your birthstone as well as Gryffindor's colour ... it seemed fitting.'
'Thought you might like my present,' Draco said confidently.
'Of course,' Aria said, and then she giggled, 'I just hadn't realised that Draco had lost the ability to speak.' she looked at him straight in the eye and added, 'I should kiss you more often if it's the only way to keep you quiet.'
'You mean to tell me that the great Draco Malfoy, hasn't got his life thought out?'
study with me
'I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, swear on my honour and magic, that I will never harm Aria Lily Potter, attempt to change anything about her, I will treat her henceforth with the utmost respect, added to that I also swear to treat her friends with the same respect. I will respect that her time is her own, and she is free to as she wishes with it.'
"Muffliato!"
Aria gaped at him, 'You don't know - OH - course not - we have spells and what not -'
"Place it."
Draco could not believe he was doing this. How had Potter managed to talk him onto getting on this flying Muggle death trap, again? At least Potter's cousin wouldn't have to go through with his threat of "kicking his arse", Potter was clearly enjoying herself, she looked like she was loving every minute of his predicament. Potter giggled herself silly as the flying contraption took off, while Draco's death-like grip did not falter until the aeroplane touched soil again. Somehow he knew that not telling him how they were exactly getting to their destination had been apart of her revenge for the announcement of their engagement. Draco dreaded to think of what else he had to look forward to that Potter had "planned" not to tell him. Three weeks of being in Potter's presence had better be worth all this trouble.
'You do,' Fleur said, 'or you would not be wearing that bracelet - it is traditional for a Veela to give one upon an engagement - Bill has one like it, which I gave him.'
Anyone expect Draco. Aria thought. But they didn't need to know that.
'And I noticed your trunk, you didn't really scream "witch" but then I guess I don't either.' she said, 'Does it make a difference - being, what did you call it? Muggle-born? I'm still learning all the terms.'
'Have what? Compatible magic?' Aria asked, 'We can't have.'
'I'm going to let Ripper back in, he'll think I've left him if I leave him outside any longer -'
"What the bloody hell is that supposed to mean?"
Fingers ran through her hair, and Aria wallowed in the attention. Lips pressed against her forehead. 'Everyone grieves differently Aria, just because you're not crying now doesn't mean that you won't at all.'
She was not even affected by the Veela allure!
The end of the lesson could not have come fast enough. Malfoy seemed to be oddly confused, as Aria stood there glaring at him, tears still falling.
'Do not be disheartened,' Narcissa said, 'But if you feel you need to go, then go.'
Aria almost slapped herself for not thinking of it sooner. She would have had one from her parents if they were still alive and one with Sirius. The only reason Aria even knew such a bond existed was because of Teddy.
'Are you OK?'
'So how is a wand made exactly.'
'Where are we going?'
"She flies extremely well, does she not."
'I promised Mr and Mrs Weasley I'd spend Easter with them,' Aria replied, 'And I do not break a promise, at least if I can help it.'
'I'd thought I'd come to see you first - I was going to head there afterward.' Draco said.
'You owe me ten Galleons.' Aria whispered into his ear, as Scorpius's head tilted downwards, looking not at all happy.
'You're well - people would go nuts - there would be an outrage if they tried.' Hermione said.
Ron's hands reached up and rubbed at his face, 'I know you've got compatible magic and all, I just don't get how you can be so sure.'
That had been the reason why his mother had gone to such lengths - calling in the life debt. And if Potter found out - Merlin if she ever found out it had been a ruse, he doubted that he would still be alive.
"You think you know it though."
'Christmas.' Aria repeated herself. 'It happened over the Christmas holidays.'
'I'm over his death Hermione,' Aria said, she really didn't want to explain why she felt like the only room she was comfortable in was her godfather's old bedroom and that it was the only place she could fall asleep peacefully in. 'It's my house - Sirius's left it to me - I'll do what I want with it and if that means putting up with more toxic fumes Sirius implanted anywhere else, so his room wouldn't be changed - then, so be it.'
"And go where Ron?" Aria snapped, "Hogwarts has been locked down!"
'Yes, it will be quite pleasant,' Mrs Malfoy said, 'Now do tell us, are there any plans you have made over the summer. Long visits or stays anyway.'
'I've got something to do today,' Aria said, she still didn't understand why Marge was coming to help with arrangements, mostly everything had been done, 'I'll be back in time for dinner -' Aria added as Vernon raised his eyebrows at her. Heaven knows how Vernon or Dudley would have survived, either of them knowing how to cook, they didn't even know how to turn the oven on if Aria had not been around to do it. Vernon said nothing, returning to his paper and Aria left the kitchen.
Hermione, Ron, and Aria exchanged guilty looks.
Narcissa smiled softly, 'We had reasons for making that announcement.'
OK, so maybe he hadn't changed completely ... but still ...
'Your point?' Draco inquired. Blaise merely inclined his head in the direction of the Gryffindor table. Aria was surrounded by fellow peers, Finnigan was talking amatively with his hands, making those nearest to him, Aria included laugh.
'Come on - let's get something to eat - no actually let's just wait by the pool.' she shook her head, 'Come on.'
'Pansy, what are you talking about?'
Draco was unsure on what did it, whether it had been that his mind was clear from frustration or whether his thoughts had been on Aria, but there was a gasp as the husky run around the room; Draco felt slightly disappointed by the form of his Patronus, with their complimentary magic he thought he would've had something to match Arias. Aria seemed surprised, had she too expected the same thing? But she shook her head and gave him a smile and look full of understanding. Maybe having a different Patronus to hers was not so bad after all. Then Aria decided that she couldn't be outdone, and cast; perfectly and non-verbally a corporeal Patronus, her stag dashed around the room. From her smirk, she had been able to do so for a little while, she just had wanted to wait until he managed to cast his. Show off! Well, he couldn't have that - as soon as the class ended, Draco swept past the other students, completely ignored Weasley and Granger, tugged on Aria's arm, making her spin around, and pulled her towards him, his lips meeting hers.
'Of course, I did!'
Aria had not been expecting that, her eyes widened, tears falling, as the audience in their seats all stood to stand ... every single last one of them. Hundreds of people, all standing, all because of her. Aria may have felt like she could have done more, but she had also done so much, it was not until now that she could see it for herself, did she realise just what she had even done.
'Did I or did I not say I'd help you?' Aria said.
'Please, Aria - just listen to me.'
'Last time?' Draco said his eyebrows arched up in a questioning manner.
You are not to pay for me, however kind your offer is, I know you said it would please you greatly,
'Sorry, I didn't mean it the way I said it - I'm just ... why can't I get it?'
The car journey was full of the most awkward conversation, he had ever had to encounter in Potter's presence. Full of things like; "so Aria said that you know each other from school", and "how did you start going out?". Potter was not helping him either, she sat there gleefully listening to his responses. This was why he disliked being around Muggles - he had no idea what to say or tell them without putting his foot in it and looking stupid. After a few hours, they reached the place Potter said Muggles called an airport. It was how they traveled all around the world without the use of a Portkey. He did not feel at all nervous, Potter's magic was slightly calming.
The sound of footsteps was mixed with slight laughter - as students filled the white square, and began to look around at those who had joined in the square also. Chatter broke out as students began to ask similar questions of who others supported. Then Aria called out, 'Whose who support the Tornadoes remain in the square -'
Hermione, gave a puzzled thought for a few moments, 'Isn't she a home-schooled student, here for the dueling tournament.'
'You should have informed me, or come to the Manor ... I don't know why - you know your always welcome.'
'No your not, we need to get you to the hospital wing, but first, your going to have to move your wings.'
'Saving the wizarding community does that,' Draco said, rolling his eyes, what else had Blaise been expecting.
'Well you did ask me -' Aria shook her head at him and turned around almost running into the seemly empty room, for the only thing the room contained was charmed snow.
'Friday?'
Aria gathered herself. She would not fail now. It pleased Voldemort greatly when she replied to him in Parseltongue, if that meant no one else had to suffer by which she mainly thought of Draco, Aria would comply. "No My Lord." How she hated saying those words. How the Sorting Hat would laugh at her now. The irony of it all. She really should have been in Slytherin. Aria turned to her plate and filled it up, she ate a small amount before Voldemort could say something about that too. Voldemort could be very attentive when he wanted to be and he watched Aria closely.
Aria tried to not arch an eyebrow. That was the closest thing to a compliment from Snape she had ever received.
Hermione bit her lip, Ginny frowned, while Ron pulled a look of disgust. Though Aria had not mentioned Draco by his name, she had implied it, for they all knew which ball she had been talking about.
'Oh!' Aria said softly still blushing.
'Nothing like that,' Aria reassured him, 'it's just - I went to a family ball so I could be introduced - and afterward, well it's hard to explain - before he'd have no problems at looking at me like I didn't belong there or a bit of filth - after the ball, that all stopped - that's what I meant by odd. Just not at all what I expected.'
"I forgive you." Aria yawned, stretching slightly. She reached out placing a hand on top of his, biting her lip. "I know." Her soft reply along with her startling green empathetic eyes said it all. She did not wish this upon him, she wished there was another way. "But I can't see you die."
She just bloody knew it, shakily, Aria got to her feet, walked along the row to the nearest exit, down the center aisle, heading towards Kinsley who had continued with his speech.
13 21 6 6 12 9 1 20 15
'It got too much!' she stated, she looked hastily around the sitting room for signs of life, she appeared to be relieved that Draco was alone. 'I hope you don't mind my turning up unannounced and early.'
'Well just for future reference jewellery is not always going to win me over.' Aria paused, 'and congratulations on the Patronus by the way. Told you, you could do it.'
His mother squeezed his shoulder, 'I'm sure she's just been busy and you'll most likely hear from by the end of the day.'
'She's not going to go anywhere.' A soft voice said Draco faced the person who he had just sat down next to; his grandmother, Florence Malfoy. 'Your young lady.'
'Really?'
Two could play at this game, Aria crossed her arms and smirked.
'Potter hasn't spoken to you?' Blaise said, his eyebrow arching, 'Well I don't know why that surprises me - given what happened -'
Though wizarding travel was much quicker, and he much preferred to use it, Potter clearly enjoying herself, her magic buzzed with excitement and Draco couldn't stop himself from smiling at her antics. Traveling as a Muggle was different from what he thought it be like - true he didn't like aeroplanes much - it made his ears go funny - apparently this was considered normal and Potter gave him a cure of sorts for it. Though Draco could still not see how sucking on a sweet actually helped. But the relaxed nature of it all, despite having to be early for everything, it was relaxing, in a way. He could see why she wanted to travel this way now, and not just see the sights by herself.
'I have something for you, Aria,' Draco said softly breaking the awkward silence after dinner had finished. 'I would have given it to you the other day ... but it was not ready.' he explained, pulling out a square box from his robes, placing it on the table in front of her.
"You serve a greater purpose to me by me not killing you Aria." He glared. Aria did not understand. What purpose could that be? "Make no mistake I will kill you if you ever betray me or attempt to. No matter my reasoning for keeping you alive now."
'He didn't try anything - did he?' Ginny asked, eyebrows raised, 'because all bets are off if he did!'
'So today I thought could have an honesty day,' Aria said, 'I'm going to ask a bunch of questions or make statements, and they may get personal - and each house will take part in them, and I will be joining in also,' she took a breath, and stepped forward to the white magically drawn box, 'It's rather simple really - the magic square in the middle will turn green once everyone who should be in the box is there, and will turn red if someone shouldn't be in it, before returning to normal again. If anyone is missing when a question or statement is said, the student whole house square will sound an alarm - so for Slytherin; it's a snake's hiss, a lion's roar for Gryffindor, a raven's squawk for Ravenclaw, and badger's squeal for Hufflepuff. Each of the squares is enchanted to re-size themselves accordingly - so the more people that should be in the middle the smaller your house square will become - for example; if you're a boy step into the white square.'
The door opened, Aria and Draco pointed their wands. Ophelia walked in wand also raised. "I can't stand another second of this." Aria and Draco lowered their wands.
'What do you mean odd?' Neville said, now leaning forward, a look of concern tormented his face.
'Really D? Shotgun!' Potter retorted, pulling open a door to the back of the car, 'How old are you? Two?' Potter looked in his own direction when he showed no signs of moving, 'Well in you get Draco, or do you need me to open the door for you?'
'What?'
'You could help me with Potions if you prefer?'
'No,' Hermione said, 'we haven't - yes Malfoy was an arse. That does not mean what Aria -'
'I thought you'd never ask,' Aria said, kissing his cheek which seemed to flush upon the contact, 'I'm sorry I've been ... I didn't - I'm sorry I never understood before. You - if you want to - can tell me anything. I won't break your confidence.'
Tainted Souls. Chapter: The Darkest of Times.
'You're a Potter too,' Draco said sincerely, his hand reached up to cup her cheek. 'Remember that always.'
Aria was breathing heavily. She completely focused on her task.
A crowd surrounded the dueling stage, the dueling tournament had come to an end, which left Draco frowning at the stage. The tournament trophy had been handed out sheer moments ago to the winner. That person was not himself.
Aria knew her friends could tell something was wrong, with the apprehensive glances Ron and Hermione were sharing. But Aria just didn't want to talk about it. She considered herself lucky that the Professors had obviously been told and therefore she had not been called upon in her morning classes.
She felt like shouting, Anything! Anything else, then marry your son, please, I beg of you! But she did not, she was more mature than that ... she hoped. She was more deified than shouting to get her own way, though she was not above begging, and if it came to it she would. To hell with her dignity - she wanted her life - marrying Draco Malfoy had not been part of her life plans. At all! Begging sounded like an extremely good idea.
Pink confetti and hearts decorated the ceiling of the Great Hall the morning of Valentine's day, Aria yawned sleepily as sat down next to a positively beaming Hermione, who was sporting a new charm bracelet.
'I would have thought that being presented a gift needed no explanation,' his father sneered.
'Not really,' Pansy shrugged, 'but with Potter not dueling, anyone could win it.'
'I grow bored.' The females were finally dragged from the room, entertainment clearly had been filled for the evening. 'Let's all dine now."
"Weren't you listening Aria," Draco said looking deathly pale as she felt? "Seven times. The most magical number. He wanted to know what would happen to that person."
'Hey, who's that?'
Aria Potter.
Draco stood with his hands in his pockets, glancing around the platform that was swarming full of people, other witches, and wizards all doing the same thing. The term had come to an end starting the three-week break over Christmas, meaning the cold weather had also set in. Draco drew his cloak tighter around himself and replaced his hands into his pockets. The sound of the Hogwarts Express pulled Draco's attention towards it and he watched as the train came to a stop.
Draco peered at Aria's face, he had been too comfortable to move before now, Aria too in spite of the way their current conversation was going. Aria seemed perplexed.
Fleur exchanged a look with Mrs Weasley, then looked at Aria again. 'Send for him ... she needs him.'
'Wouldn't hurt me you said, respect me you said,' Aria hissed, 'was this the plan all along. Hay I know mother, Aria Potter is pretty much dim-witted, we can fool her with anything. Did you think I would not find out - that we would not learn it -'
"I've watched the Dark Lord torture my mother Potter," Draco whispered, "I can't stand watching it either, I dislike it immensely and I hate him."
Definitely Muggle code then.
thought out and made before our engagement started. I've instructed Coeus to wait for your response,
'Is not that,' Potter said defensively, 'I just - never mind.'
'You do, however, make an excellent point,' she added, and Aria looked up at her hopefully. 'You both do not know each other well.' Aria took a breath of relief, 'I think it is wise we change that.'
'Yeah, like I said, brightest in our year. Only ever beat her in Defence Against the Dark Arts.' Aria said as the bell rung, ending lunchtime, 'speaking of which, that's where I should be heading now.'
And when Aria put it like that, Draco could understand better why she felt ready to leave.
'If you excuse me, I have a ... husband to go find,' Narcissa said and she swept down the hall, and Aria knew she was not looking for Lucius at all.
"Yes."
'Webster's put his name down for the duel competition,' she announced.
Hermione beamed at her, 'It's nothing ... it's just - you're being so you.'
'Well your knowledge is very vast, Draco,' Blaise said, and the common room portrait burst open again, Aria, Weasley, and Granger were joined by several other Gryffindors. 'It will give you a chance to prove a point to your cousin.' Blaise murmured as the Gryffindors grew closer. A chance to show up Cygnus, Draco liked the sound of that, his cousin should have never underestimated him.
'I don't get how you could be this close to someone who you've disliked for years,' Ginny said, indicating towards the picture, 'This is the same guy that tormented you for years - watched Hermione get tortured by his own aunt - in his own home!'
'Thank you.'
Aria's trail of thoughts abruptly stopped as she caught sight of one of her best friends in the eighth-year common room; her very unimpressed male best friend.
Fleur had placed down the picture in front of Aria, Ginny and Hermione both leaned over to look also. The picture was definitely the two of them - Draco and Aria - sitting together in close proximity like they were locked in an intimate moment.
Draco was stunned, not by her reception of him, but by the fact that she sounded as though she did not want to be heard, and he could not think of any logical explanation. 'I came to explain.'
Chapter: Messages from a coin.
'I do but I'll admit it he might have put me off. I'll see him thirty-first - spend the whole day if that's OK.'
Aria's head turned away from him completely, 'I don't want to bond with you for just that! It's not a good enough reason!'
'Oh,' Alana flushed, 'I didn't - no one said anything about that.'
Draco frowned slightly at the do not disturb sign-up on the handle of the hotel room he was sharing with Dudley. America had been completely relaxing, and his complexion had darkened slightly - he had not tanned as much as he thought he would. Probably something to do with the lotion, Aria made him put on his skin. Something Muggles used to stop their skin from burning - called sun cream lotion or some nonsense like that.
'They were fools.'
Aria got up to her feet - she would not cry - she would not cry due to a bunch of big-headed Malfoy's. She crossed the room to the dresser table ... and looked into the mirror ...
'You know that you just used magic on aeroplane, that's full of Muggles, right.'
"It was from Aria."
'You talk too much -'
'The Ministry last year - I was waiting with her, of course, I was in disguise ...'
'No,' Draco said, 'And he already has the female population swooning at his feet -'
'Stand up,' Blaise said.
"So, this is the girl ... Ummm, she'll do", Aria mimicked the snobbish voice of another one of Draco's endless cousins ...she grabbed the perfume bottle upon it and flung it across the room, and it smashed upon contact ... though she was not sure what with ... she didn't bother to look, unconcerned by what it hit as long as it hit something ...
"After your marking. You will take her flying. The wards are strong enough that even brooms cannot breakthrough. You will keep her completely safe. Do you understand? Not a bone, not even a hair out of place."
She could still not believe she was actually here, sitting there, in a large sitting room in their Manor, drinking tea. Because coming to Malfoy Manor had been a toll in itself, especially after the last time she had been here. That last visit where Hermione had been tortured, Dobby killed, by Mrs Malfoy's own sister hands, well Aria did not want to think on those advents. But Aria could not ignore the facts, and if Mrs Malfoy wanted to call in her life debt, she was entailed to, then she had to be here and listen to what Narcissa Malfoy wanted for repayment. But this? Aria had not been expecting this! Aria still did not understand why Malfoy wasn't protesting against his mother, why he wasn't saying something - anything! Surely he knew how much of a bad idea this was. They could never - not in a million years - they could not even stand one another. Granted he had saved her life, and she, his, but this - marriage! - it was too much to expect from them both.
'Draco has a new one,' Mrs Malfoy replied coolly, 'the one you ... required from him, will not work the same way for him again. You said so yourself when you battled the Dark Lord; "the wand chooses the wizard".'
'Well, he - you - I didn't know he was a Veela or that we had compatible magic. I know why and I can understand it - I just wish -'
'Somewhat,' Draco said, then he shrugged, 'others just vanished as sexual equality happened ...'
It was a spell Aria did not know. She gave Draco a puzzling look.
'That school of yours finally taught you some manners then,' Miss Dursley muttered, 'about time too.'
'He would,' Aria said, 'that's Draco's cousin; Cygnus Neumann.' She knew instantly why he had been drawing so much attention, 'and yes, he's a Veela.'
'I hate him!' Draco snapped as they sat down in an air-chair in the new common room for the eighth-years. Only in the dorms would each house banner, be found; the common-room showed no signs of the Hogwarts house banners or even portraits. The only portrait they had was the guardian to the room. When Draco first saw it, he thought the walls looked like a family tree, but it was not. It was a tree of sorts, each branch led off to a person's name along with a date of birth, and most had a date of death, others just had the year of death, as there was no conclusive date. The Remembrance Tree was what they started calling it; it held all the names of lives lost, including those who had died fighting the Dark Lord the first time around.
With Fleur out of the question, Aria's next choice had of course been Hermione, and she knew Hermione would help, it was Ron Aria was concerned about most, and if Ron found out Aria was looking into the rune meanings ... well, she was trying to avoid yet another argument about Draco Malfoy. Which left her with asking to borrow Hermione's ancient runes book and still have the same outcome or roam the knowledge of Grimmauld Place ... or more precisely the books Grimmauld Place contained.
Vernon said. 'Marge is bringing Ripper with her -'
"Is my precious one ready to talk now? I have dinner with me."
'You'll get used to them.' Scorpius said to Adelaide, 'my family and the extended family.'
But yet they hadn't told Goyle this information. For as far as Draco knew Goyle was still following them. Granger seemed to know what he was thinking for she said. 'She deserves some peace, that's why we hadn't said anything.'
"I believe so. Watch them. Be careful who you trust with the information inside it, Aria. It will I believe with no doubt help you with your quest."
'That'll be dad,' Dudley said, looking towards the front door. Draco heard footsteps going away from them, what sounded like talking, then a few minutes later a beefy-looking man walked into the sitting room.
Seriously ... no I mean it, it's not like I don't love it, but you could have warned me, I feel sorry for those poor owls that had to drop off the cage, but when I said I might - did you see that word there, you know MIGHT - want a cat, that does not mean you buy me one. Poor thing ... still haven't come up with a suitable name for it. Any suggestions on what to name a female grey cat? Oh, and I hope you realise I was actually joking when I stated I wanted stuff, I was mostly listing off things at the top of my head.
'Aria?'
'Don't worry,' Aria said, 'I had no clue - literally. The old Potions Professor - Snape - he would always use the old names for herbs, it confused the hell out of me, until my friend pointed it out.'
'It was lovely, especially when daddy got home - though we spent most of our summer rebuilding the house.'
"What are you thinking about so seriously?" came a small murmur.
'Aria says that's judgemental, judging someone by certain behaviours or what house they are in.' Alana said, 'she's pretty cool, you know and you screwed up. She was happy ... she had told me so, said "I'm happier than I have been, for quite some time", and you screwed it up.'
Aria shot up abruptly, her breathing was laboured and her heart was beating erratically.
'It's because you're frustrated ... when I first learned, I was so determined to get it, I had to learn it ... I just had to. And that thirst clouded my ability to see clearly. I wasn't lying when I said that knowing I could do it gave me the confidence to be able to cast a corporeal Patronus. I struggled for ages, trying to rack my brain for every happy memory I could think of so I could do it.'
Silence filled the air, there was not much that needed to be said, but Aria did have a question to ask.
Kingsley had fallen silent, there was a scurry of people rising from their seats, as soon as Kingsley bowed his head slightly, silence fell. Hundreds must have come for this gathering, but not one cough broke out, Aria smiled to herself at that, the community had come to respect the fifty people who had given their lives fighting.
Draco sighed. Aria had never heard him sigh before. Draco always seemed so sure of himself. Aria took in his appearance. He looked like he hadn't slept.
Draco had never felt Aria's magic to be as happy as it was now.
Narcissa did not need to explain further, Aria knew she was talking about the bracelet concealed on her wrist beneath her robe. Talk of the bracelet made Aria, look at her own and examine her own bracelet. All of this, the engagement, had started because of Narcissa.
Draco got to his feet, wondering why, until he realised he had not been concentrating on what McGonagall had been saying, and she had asked the Head Boys and Girls to make themselves known.
'M-m,' the dark-haired, young witch stuttered, she had not believed her own ears. Green eyes, searched the grey and blue eyes before her, in signs that they - that the elder woman had lost the plot. Mrs Malfoy however seemed to be extremely calm, and Draco Malfoy looked almost pleading, though she was not sure in what he's look was begging for; her to end this madness or go along with it. Aria Potter glanced from one to the other, sighed then cleared her throat to try again. 'Marry?' she managed to choke out, 'you want me to marry your son? In exchange for the life debt I owe you?' she had to repeat it all, or her brain would never believe it.
'See!' Ron exclaimed, as though Aria had proved his point, 'He's up to something!'
"You were successful."
"When you did not return from the Ministry I thought like this might happen," Dumbledore said.
Draco turned sharply at the voice, coming face to face to a freckled-faced red-headed Weasley. Thus far the Weasley brood had kept their distance, mostly Draco thought out of respect for Aria. It was not the Weasley Draco had been expecting to have words with him, instead, Draco was face to face with a stocky, red-haired, one ear Weasley, who Draco knew to be several years ahead of himself and in Hogwarts was never seen without his brother in tow. But Fred Weasley had died in the battle, leaving his twin George on his own.
'Cat?' Ron said sounding astonished.
Well, she was dressed for such an occasion. 'We are now.'
"I know My Lord," Aria answered as sincerely as she could.
Her voice sounded hopeful ...
Aria shook her head against his hands, 'It may look it, but no. There are things ... I've told him a few things, things I couldn't avoid, like the nightmares and you. But his perspective changed when I saved his soul from Dementors.' Draco caught a glimpse of her frowning again. 'The Weasleys' were the closest - are the closest thing I have to a family. I know that they will always welcome me with open arms because that's who they are. But they never - not once verbally.'
Hermione gave a small smile. Aria too laughed.
'I do not know,' his mother said, 'Aria did not say ... I tried to find out ... I had no luck, they were not overheard.'
"What does he call you in Parseltongue?" Draco asked quietly once Voldemort had left the room.
Celena was silenced, scowling at Aria who had cast the spell non-verbally.
Draco rushed into the room, Potter was thrashing around on the bed as though her life depended on it, trapped within her own dreams. Her face was scrunched up as though she was in distress. Her magic swept across his, she was completely terrified.
'Oh, I highly doubt that.'
The reason as to why he felt so relaxed came to him, as they neared France. Because from Paris they would be getting on an aeroplane to America from there. America which he knew he wouldn't get away with wearing long-sleeved tops. Potter's cousin and his girlfriend didn't judge him on his past mistakes - despite any threats Potter's cousin made, nothing had been said about the mark upon his arm. The mark he had taken to keep his family alive. Surely if they saw it, they would ask about it. And Draco was sure Potter had not told her cousin that he was once on the dark side of their war, he doubted her cousin would have threatened him if he had known. Draco had tried everything to cover up the Dark Mark tattoo that now scarred his arm. In the end, he had to make do with long sleeve shirts to hide the hideous thing.
'So Aria's protected from attacks - just not poisoning - maybe Malfoy should have thought of that,' Ron said, 'look at where she is now - look at what's happened.'
Aria wasn't sure how much time had passed when the air shifted and she heard: 'Oh Aria why didn't you tell me?'
Draco seemed to be impressed, for his eyes glinted, and the corner of his mouth twitched before he smiled. 'Didn't think you'd get that one, being as it actually comes from Native Indian tribes and not runes to be exact.'
Draco raised his wand, and copied the movements shown to the class earlier, pointed it at the table, non-verbally he cast the spell, and the table before him exploded.
'Dad!'
'The Ministry can sue me later,' Aria said, 'besides, you missed one little factor Draco. The Muggles are all sleeping.'
'Yes,' Aria replied, 'she also happens to be another one of Draco's wonderful distantly related cousins. And thanks to her, how Draco landed up in the hospital wing.'
Tonight had been no different, unable to get to sleep, in the dead of the night Aria, had crept to the little sitting-room in their cabin they had been given and sat by the fire.
'He's rather good-looking.'
'It's of no use,' he said, when she withdrew her wand from her bag, 'I've tried everything.'
'So as neither of us are about to fall asleep anytime soon,' Draco said, 'what should we talk about?'
'He doesn't mean it, Mrs Weasley,' Hermione said before Mrs Weasley had a chance to say anything, 'And it means the other houses too, not just the Slytherins, Ron.' she glanced back at the paper, 'it goes well with the houses united scheme, so I'm not surprised, and there's a quote from McGonagall, she says; "I'm looking forward to working closely with Aria Potter on this, Miss Potter came up with a number of ideas, during my visit with her. And I'd like to implement those creative ideas", Aria you never said.'
And Aria vanished without a further word, Draco hoped that this time she wouldn't be affected by withdrawal symptoms.
'I didn't think ... we've only begun to...' Aria tried to explain.
Draco blinked, 'What do you mean, "about me"?'
Aria was no fool, she knew no one would dare attack her, not when they had Draco's wrath to deal with. Which is why she gathered she had been led here alone.
'And Teddy-' Lily said, 'you'll like Teddy though, his cool, unlike Scorp.'
'I didn't know they would put it in the paper,' Aria said, 'I was going to tell you, I swear when I saw you all next.'
'Oh ..' Aria said clearly astonished by the question. 'I would ... but I've got Quidditch practice later ... tomorrow night?'
13 5 1 14 20 9 13 5 19 5 5 11
'Aria, dear, are you feeling alright?'
'Oh, I intend to.'
Draco's fists clenched, of course, he would bloody ask her to demonstrate the spell, who wouldn't, Draco glanced quickly at Aria, and he had not been the only one to turn in her direction.
'I'm aware of that.' his father said, 'but we owe her nothing - I owe her nothing -'
'Calm down.'
'You thought yours were better - even though I can sense Draco because of our compatible magic.'
'I'm not asking Aria for lessons,' Draco mumbled, 'this isn't about learning Defence, this is about a matter of pride.'
Draco kept an eye on Aria as she played with Teddy, more helped him stand on his own feet whilst he learned to walk. The garden to his aunt's house felt small, but then with the added company for Teddy's first birthday, it would be. Draco, Aria, and his family had not been the only ones to be invited along for the celebration, his aunt had also invited the Weasleys, the Minister, and Granger. The weather was overcast, but all in all, it had been pleasant enough of a day.
'You'll see.'
"What makes you think I can be trusted?" Aria corrected and pointed at her throat. "I belong to the Dark Lord after all."
Aria bit her lip, then blurted out before she could stop herself, 'I want the reason as to why you didn't tell me from the beginning - the real reason - not the petty excuse.'
'The protective magic-' Aria mumbled realising why she had not felt emotions now and just the warmness of Draco's magic. 'It's because I don't have magical bonds ... your magic is the first - since ...' Aria trailed off nothing needed to be said.
'Someone born to non-magical parents - never mind-'
Aria ripped it from him. Ron and Neville looked at her, both of them confused. "What part of the castle has been locked down don't you get?"
'I just suspected Granger to figure it out first.'
'Oh, he knows it ... don't worry - he's being smart enough not to say anything,' Aria said, 'Serves him right, for not telling me - though I don't think his mother gave him much of a chance to.'
'It's not much of a threat if you tell me what you're going to do to me.' Draco replied.
"Old pure-blooded custom. Used - well it doesn't matter when. But basically, I can't lie to you, have to protect you and you're protected from most spells except one. Especially within the Manor and its grounds. I have to prove myself worthy due to the bracelets."
'We'll see.' Aria said, with a soft smile, her eyes sparkled playfully. 'I've got to go, see you.'
............
'I won't.'
Ron watched. He knew Aria better than anyone. Something was not right. Her magic when Ron was able to get close enough during a shared lesson was - well it felt like it was ready to burst and hurt anyone who came close.
'So, what else is in that paper - anything newsworthy?'
'Study with me ..'
'I know what you meant,' Aria said, helping herself to breakfast, 'I'm glad you like it.'
Aria did not challenge him. She knew he would have already been told what happened on her first night. And Aria told him in her own words what happened.
'They ... never liked me, they tried to "stomp" the magic out of me,' Aria said softly, her face tilted down towards the shelf of the vanity unit. Draco's hands stilled, he glanced towards the mirror and saw a pained expression on her face. 'How you saw Marge treating me ... that was basically every day of my life. Girl cook the breakfast, don't burn the bacon. Girl take the trash out, it's all your good for.' she paused wrinkles creasing her forehead as though lost in thought, and Draco returned to drying her hair. 'They made sure that I knew I was not wanted, that I was unwelcome in their home.'
"Dumbledore is dead."
"Snape tells me you are advanced when it comes to defense."
It was not her fault his cousin; Cygnus helped her to her feet before Draco could. Narcissa had been kind enough - escorted her from the room so she could clean herself up. And it was not her fault that said cousin, had not left her alone all night ... not her fault that Cygnus stopped her from tripping over her own feet.
Mrs Weasley still did not think very highly of the Daily Prophet. Neither did Aria, however much it was trying to make a new name for itself.
Fleur considered this for a moment, 'Some families ... I heard still follow them, I could not be able to tell which ones though. It is unlikely given your nature that Draco Malfoy would follow those traditions even if his family did. You are a very independent person. No, I think it must be to do with the rune meanings themselves and the protection charms the bracelet contains, for the reason into why he wished for you to wear it ... again.'
'It's not soon enough,' Draco mumbled, letting out a sigh, he looked around the Hogsmeade platform, the scarlet express train was already waiting for them to board. 'And you won't be with me for long.'
Aria had forgotten that the Death Eater and Voldemort expected her wand to be more restricted than it was.
Aria smirked, glancing at the bracelet glittering upon her wrist. She had been hesitant to accept the gift, thinking maybe it had been cursed, until she remembered his oath. If it had not been for that, she doubted she would have accepted it, despite how much he clearly had spent on it. Well if Malfoy wanted to waste more of his money, she was more than happy to let him.
'Yes, I'm ready,' Draco said, placing down Aria's letter. 'And I'm aware, and unconcerned.'
'Of course, there is,' Aria said sounding astonished and waved it off. Ginny laughed, Neville shook his head in bewilderment and Luna smiled dreamily at her.
'Leave that to me.'
The Dark Lord had been waiting.
Draco knew one thing for certain since he set eyes upon the beefy-looking woman, he didn't think much of her or the way in which she had spoken to Aria. Aria stepped out of his way, gesturing to Draco to step through after she exchanged a quick glance with her cousin.
Dinner was waiting for them. Potter sat in the seat he pulled out for her and tucked her back towards the table before seating himself beside her, firmly between her and his father.
Hermoine and Ron were glancing at each other with smiles on their faces, Aria felt her face heat up, 'What?' They both laughed.
........
'Sorry.' Draco mumbled, 'Do you want to -'
Well, Aria supposed he had a point there, and she held the piercing gaze of Ron's blue eyes. Normally just hearing Draco's surname would explain everything.
.......
Ron flushed, looking a bit sheepish.
'We're in agreement there.'
Draco switched on the light like he had seen Potter's cousin do so many times before. Dudley had woken and was now staring in a concerned manner at the wall which was the barrier between their room and Potter's.
'Strange that,' Mr Ollivander said, 'Just a habit I got myself into ... learned all this from my father. Times were different when I grew up, women quite rightly have equal rights now.'
'Miss Potter, what can I do for you?' He did not seem surprised to see her, but Mr Ollivander was ... unusual. 'I do not think you'd required a new wand, I figured you would have brought yourself a new one before your return to Hogwarts.'
Ophelia smirked. "More than you think, and they're behind me."
"How about I'll harm anyone who even thinks of telling the Dark Lord anything," Draco said darkly, "because I will."
It didn't matter that she was a half-blood, nor did it matter that most of the time she looked like a regular person, something the Malfoy's failed at, with their calm collected manner and dress code of sophisticatedness. Though she looked like a Malfoy and was soon to be one - Aria far from felt like one and it just didn't sit well with her. She felt like she was trying too hard at seeking approval she did not even need, but then she thought of Draco - of how Draco had put aside his beliefs, had tried to stick to the vows he swore to her - how he had gifted her that tapestry, the gift was just beyond words. This time she was doing something for Draco. Aria could be as elegant as the other Malfoy relations if she wanted to, and Aria was never one to back down from a challenge.
'Really now?'
Lunchtime Aria wandered the grounds and made her way to the lake. She always wondered here in times of need. To the bank across from the first place she ever cast a corporeal Patronus. That seemed like a lifetime ago, but what she wouldn't give to speak to the person she had tried to desperately save now. The Resurrection Stone was gone, Aria had no clue as to where she had dropped it.
'Umm,' Draco murmured in agreement.
She really was going to strangle Malfoy, but then a better plan came to mind. Oh, yes the holiday - Malfoy had no idea what was coming to him.
'I can do Friday.'
'Oh, no Professor,' Aria said innocently, almost too innocently, a smirk forming on her face. 'I don't see much point as I'd be disqualified.' She moved her arm and the sleeve of her robe fell down enough to reveal something glittering on her wrist - the bracelet Draco had given her, and his cousin blinked at her as the bell rang. Draco couldn't help it he was smirking also, she had finally put the bracelet back on and did a bit of research by the sound of things. While she wore the bracelet, which protected her from hexes and jinxes she wouldn't be allowed to compete in any dueling tournament.
'And he would have got himself killed!' Hermione replied firmly, 'They would have killed him - I'm not saying what he did was right - but he did not hand us over - I can't just forget that!'
'I just can't wait for this year to be over!'
'What's wrong?' Aria asked, well more demanded. 'It is Ron? George?' Please don't let it be George again, she could only handle that conversation once. Poor thing. The whole family had been devastated after losing Fred, but George ... had not been handling it well. He had drunk himself stupid ... so stupid he almost, almost, landing up killing himself. That was until Aria had spoken with him. Had pushed past her own issues, pushed away from her feelings of guilt, she had stepped into The Burrow, seeing them all for the first time in months, just to have words with George. Though she had never been as close to the twins as she had been Ron, she had always respected them, too much to let George stumble into the gloom, where his twin brother would not have wanted him to be. Somehow after hours of being locked up in the twins' old bedroom, she had got through to him. Now George was planning on opening up Weasleys' Wizarding Wheezes again. 'Anyone?'
When Aria reached the designated room for tonight's advent, she took a breath before she walked in - to find no one there. The room was empty apart from the furniture. Perhaps she had just been the first to arrive - for Narcissa wouldn't invite her then not show up, come to think of it Narcissa would have been here to welcome everyone including Aria herself. Something most certainly did not feel quite right to Aria. Had she been led here on false pretense? That explained why no one was in the room. If so then the invitation she had received had not been from Narcissa but someone else entirely. Aria let the door close softly behind her.
'For what it is worth,' Ron said looking at Aria rather awkwardly, 'I am sorry. In all honestly, I think Malfoy needs his head testing - I mean his completely lost it thanks to your compatible magic - barmy I tell you. He would have never protected anyone but himself before now.'
Aria took such a deep breath, her eyes closing as though she was forcing herself to relax, and the question Draco had been about to ask her trailed off. Aria's eyes opened again, her green eyes searching his.
'Merlin, Draco,' Aria exclaimed, and she turned deep red, 'I - it's not like - I - not that you need to know.' she rambled clearly struggling to find the words. 'Gosh, Draco, one of my best friends is a guy and he has quite a few older brothers. I think - we realised what they were up to, us girls.' she paused and added coldly, 'It's not hard to figure out - you know - especially when a guy and girl - run off together! I'm not stupid!'
'The Daily Prophet likes to take things that concern me and blow them out of proportion,' Aria said, 'I'm fine.'
'Figured you didn't have time, what with Quidditch and helping McGonagall.' Ron said, 'I've heard a lot about the activities from the younger students in passing.'
Weasley seemed to be unsure on whether he should leave or if he wanted to remain, and hissed under his breath, though he did leave the room, to what seemed to be at Granger's insistence. Draco was surprised he hadn't actually come across the Weasley family before now, considering how close Aria was to them.
Once Great Hall doors opened, and the students from all the houses and years filed in - confused by the emptiness of it. Aria stood near where the teachers' table would usually be, Professor McGonagall stood beside her.
Aria held out her wrist to show them the bracelet, 'yeah it's true - all this time he was running around telling everyone he was pure-blood when he's a Veela.'
'How lovely for you all, the whole family back together.' Aria said.
'I love you too,' came her soft reply, Aria was blushing slightly as she spoke, 'Yes I'll bond with you.'
Christmas day at Grimmauld Place was dark and dismal. But even Sirius's old house seemed better than Hogwarts at the moment. Upon Dumbledore's death, they had to place several of the Order's homes under The Fidelius Charm, they even had to redo Grimmauld Place because it had become so vulnerable due to having too many secret keepers upon Dumbledore's death.
'Draco?' Mrs Malfoy turned to her son, Aria followed suit. He seemed hesitant to speak, maybe just maybe he too was thinking of a way out of this. She could never be what he would want after all; Pure-blood, pretty, smart - apart from Quidditch and Defence Against the Dark Arts, she had never shown any talent for anything. Then Malfoy did something she had not ever expected.
It didn't matter that he didn't receive any points, he received something better for Aria kissed his cheek swiftly before making off after her friends.
we wonder if you would be available for another dinner, perhaps somewhere outside of the
'Yes, true,' Aria said, giving up trying to read and talk at the same time. 'You should warn your friend that if he doesn't want to see himself hexed to back off. I get what he's trying to do, I understand he feels like he needs to repay them, but he won't repay it by following them around everywhere ... what does he think is going to happen? Someone will attack two of the war heroes and he'd be there to jump in to stop it?'
'Compatible magic!' he said, and added angrily, 'if this is about Malfoy -'
'Gods they made it sound as though, I was in grave danger.' Aria said.
The silence resumed after the Weasleys had left, his mother looked as though she couldn't quite believe what was happening and his father showed no difference, just his usual cool expressions.
Those had been her words in her letter, is that what she was trying to do? Set a good example by raising above the rumours? By accepting the apologies and acting like it was nothing? Had that been the reason she had agreed to the engagement?
'I guess I found out what I wanted to do,' Draco said shrugging, then he pointing towards the back of the house, 'there's a lake here too, I thought you'd like that.'
'Why thank you,' Aria said mocking a bow. 'Hopefully, I put a few people off with my randomness. I couldn't believe it when McGonagall told me how many people had turned up.'
'I can do it for you.' Draco offered.
'Thought it was ... you were looking at it like, you could see something no one else could.' she said.
'No, it's something I've only ever told you and Hermione.'
The practice dummy flew backward, toppling onto its side before it came to a rest.
Aria rolled her eyes, as Professor McGonagall finished her announcement, turning back to the book she had taken out on compatible magic, whilst she waited for dinner to appear. She had already scribbled down the items she would need, she just needed to speak with Hagrid. Ollivander said the best way to becoming a wandmaker was through experimenting with the cores and mixing combinations herself. She had no interest in any dueling competition ... she just wanted to start making her own wands, it literally became a new obsession.
Draco hardly needed telling twice or the encouragement to steal Aria away from the rest of his family. He had no intentions of dancing with her, however, well at least not in front of his family members. He smiled unsurely towards Aria and gestured with his head towards the doors of the room. Draco steered her to the other end of the Manor when it became clear to Aria that they were doing so, she asked.
Emily shook her head, clearly bewildered, and opened one of the car doors, and climbed in.
Aria nodded and turned to Draco who looked sad and remorseful. "It was the only way. Only death frees us -" Draco pulled at his sleeve to reveal his hidden counterpart. " and I'd choose you or death over his rule any day."
'I have nothing to prove - unlike you.' Cygnus replied, 'Get out of my sight Draco before I give you a detention.'
'Malfoy,' Aria spat, 'will you just go already, you can't be here -'
'I may not like you,' Granger said after a lengthy pause, 'but I will be civil to you for Aria's sake.'
'I was as good as what got them killed,' Aria replied. 'They died for something they believed in - they died for me. But if I have just gone to Voldemort sooner - I might have saved a lot more lives. I sometimes wonder if I made the right choice.' Dudley gave a look of confusion, 'I don't regret defeating him but I do wonder if I should have remained.'
Aria often wondered what love was, not the love of friendship, but actual love. She couldn't remember her parents, Sirius had died before she had the chance to really know him. Aria knew that actual love existed, she saw it every time Mr Weasley and Mrs Weasley looked at each other, she saw it in the photographs of her parents. Aria knew she loved her godson, but to love another person beyond the point of friendship? She didn't know much about that type of love. Funny how she had been willing enough to die to protect her friends, and that had protected them in the last moments of the final battle, but yet she knew nothing about it. There was no doubt that Aria loved the protectiveness of Draco's magic, but loving his magic was not the same as being in love with Draco Malfoy, was it?
'Potter!'
The confession slipped off his tongue, but Draco did not regret it for one moment, not when Aria's green eyes were shining so brightly and looking at him so intensely.
I will just place into your vault an enormous amount of money otherwise and be done with it.
For a moment she wondered why he said that then she remembered he had asked her not to change. Aria stepped closer to him.
"Do you think our Headmaster will mind me borrowing your pensieve?"
'Hush.' Draco said. 'We've got time to figure this out. We don't need to do - to sort everything right now. But I think it's best you stay with me at the Manor for the rest of the holiday.'
And Aria thought carefully, remembering, "I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality." Aria ran a hand through her hair, "that is why he didn't die when he tried to kill me."
The Slytherins were nothing like Dumbledore's Army. There were no voices of excitement. instead, they gave her calculated looks and each other the same calculated looks, then they all settled on Nott.
Of course, she had questioned it ... but there was the matter of the life-debt. And Draco had been trying to prove that he was not the same person, he had been honest, she supposed spending all that time with him in the summer, helped. Compatible magic just sucked sometimes. But she could not deny that they had it, she could not forget the way it made her feel ... her head pounded, and Aria rubbed her temple - great the last thing she needed; a headache.
Though his tone did not voice it, it wasn't hard to hear the accusation within it.
Of course, his father would have to come along and overhear everything.
'He hasn't put you off already, you keep telling me you want three,' his aunt replied, laughing slightly, 'When do you want to see him next?'
'You already thanked me for that,' Aria said. 'Now shall we try again, I believe I never introduced myself, I'm Aria Potter, most people know me as the Girl Who Lived, the Chosen One or the as the Wizarding Saviour ... I much prefer being called Aria.'
Draco's ego slightly deflated at the embarrassment Aria caused. She had kissed him? Ha, he didn't think so, well she had but he had initiated the kiss. Aria gave him one last knowing smile, as though she could tell what was on his thoughts, before sliding into her seat. She looked extremely bored as the class began. He supposed an expert at the Patronus Charm would be, though it seemed as though she still had to get the knack of casting it nonverbally, as she had not been able to cast a corporeal Patronus non-verbally, only producing a cloud-like silver barrier that formed a shield. Draco laughed at the sight Aria produced halfway through the lesson, clearly fed-up with her boredom, she had once again begun to try casting the spell non-verbally, her face was screwed up, eyes closed and nose twitching.
'I got a little gift for you,' Draco said, about a month after they had left Hogwarts. Aria had been a little quiet, but she seemed happy enough.
December had arrived bringing with a cold bitter wind. Aria for the first time in years had received a letter. Normally this would not cause her any concern. But the letter McGonagall had just given her had not been received the normal way. It had tried to come through the Muggle post.
'So are you going to sign up for it, the Duelling Tournament?' Blaise asked.
Ginny laughed, 'Ha! Like she's going to agree to come shopping with a Muggle-born, and two Weasleys. I think you've got some wishful thinking Aria.'
'So you'll promise to kiss me lots when I see you next?' Draco inquired. This earned him an exasperated sigh and a playful shove.
Aria,
Dear Aria,
She was going to have an over-extreme wedding that surely was going to make a statement because that is what Malfoy's did best in Aria's opinion, no matter what had happened and who the Malfoy's had aligned themselves with, they walked with confidence and a purpose, everything calculated - just like the Slytherins' that they all were ... cunning indeed.
"Voldemort my dear has a secret," Dumbledore said. "One he never told his fellow companions. One I only ever had theories about."
'Yes .. my godson,' Aria stated, 'I'm having him the whole day and for the night to give Dromeda a break.'
Aria's new entourage managed to protect her all the way to the Great Hall of Hogwarts. The plans to overthrow the Ministry altogether had been successful that now Voldemort had a watchful eye on all the witches and wizards' children. It had become mandatory to attend Hogwarts. Umbridge as far as Aria had heard was in charge of questioning Muggleborns. The evidence of Voldemort's accomplishments was clear as Aria looked around the Great Hall during the sorting. The youngest Weasley's were there, Hermione, however, was missing as were several muggle-borns. They were either now in Azkaban or in hiding. Though from what Aria gathered Voldemort was very confident that those in hiding would not stay that way for long.
Next thing he knew both women were crying and embracing each other, quite awkwardly as his aunt still had hold of the baby. He was never going to understand women ...
Draco brought himself back to the matter at hand - the do not disturb sign. Was this some kind of Muggle code? Should he just go back to the swimming pool and inform Aria. It turned out he did not need to inform Aria after all, as she came down the corridor saving him the trouble.
Aria felt like she was completely spoilt for choice, Potions, which was not her best subject, or a subject that she had always fallen asleep in. 'Potions. I might be able to remember more of that.'
Love him?
She burst out of the classroom, Malfoy calling after her, shouting her name, asking her to stop, telling her once again that he thought she knew. Aria ignored him. She felt completely foolish. And for the first time, during her stay at school, she actually wanted to get the hell away from Hogwarts.
Aria took her duvet with her as she strolled across the room to open the window, letting the falcon swoop in. She took the letter and stared at the falcon when it made no move to fly back out of the open window. 'Well, get going then.' Aria gestured to the open window to Coeus, but the falcon still made no move to leave. Aria took a deep breath, closed the window, and placed the letter in the bin, along with the others.
'No, he did not ... but the facts remain the same, and the two of you are who you are ... if seen together - would most likely cause a public outcry.'
'You're just as bad love.' Draco retorted.
Something just didn't feel quite right to Aria. For at least half an hour she stared down her reflection in the long mirror. Her hair had been put into a beautiful knot, the black lace and cream sleeveless and strapless dress, fitted her perfectly. But Aria felt like she didn't recognize the person that was staring back at her from the mirror. Maybe it was the way the dress made her skin look oddly paler than usual. She looked like - well - like a Malfoy, or to be exact; how Mrs Malfoy looked - elegant and beautiful. Aria wrung her hands together nervously, she could do this, if the gathering tonight was to welcome her into the fold, then it was as good as any night to show those stupid cousins of Draco's that they were wrong.
"People who answered the DA call when we went into the Ministry. The messages are coming through to people Aria can trust."
'Oh,' Potter said looking at them, and for the first time, Draco noticed the blue, glittery nail varnish, 'Emily - my - Muggle friend - I'm currently her new model - that's why I was so late, I had to go back home and change. I didn't think turning up in Muggle jeans would be appreciated.'
'Today I want to honour those who gave, time and time again to the cause, please join me in a two minutes silence, and honour the fifty who to unfortunate circumstance cannot be here with us this day.'
'Aria, you're making it sound like you were the one who - you know - done them in -'
'It's been quite funny watching Ron and Hermione jump apart or hearing them complain when they realise Goyle is around ... they're rather annoyed he's been destroying their time together..'
'Thanks, Aria.'
Draco's voice sounded disappointed and his facial expression appeared the same.
'That's -' Ron began, then shook his head trailing off.
'Welcome to the family, Aria Malfoy.'
'So, when are you having him next?'
"What do mean there is no plan?"
'Thanks.'
'Miss Dursley,' the woman said, 'Dudders, you never mentioned knowing such a pleasant young man.'
All those months of hiding away in the Muggle world had finally come to an end.
'Aria, what is it, love?' Draco said helping her to her feet, only then did he notice that she had brought her stuff with her. This puzzled him, Aria was not due to see him until tomorrow. Draco's question it seemed was the wrong one to ask, for Aria blinked, her eyes watering up.
The fact that Draco actually didn't care that she didn't know what she wanted to do with her life and was OK with that. Or the way his hands cupped her face whilst they kissed, holding her chin in a delicate grasp as though she was the most fragile thing he had ever held. Or just that his magic felt like nothing she had ever known, and she could get lost in it for days. The fact that Draco Malfoy made her feel stronger than she had in months - years - if she told the honest truth. But Aria said none of those things, Ron would not want to hear them.
"Welcome to Dumbledore's Army."
'Then I agree,' Aria said softly, silently cursing herself. This had to be the craziest thing she had ever done! Or was agreeing to do too!
'Greg's never been overly smart,' Draco said, 'or intelligent at all come to think of it -'
'No you're not,' Malfoy said, raising his eyebrows at her, in the manner she knew was his; I know better look.
"Does our Lord need me?"
'It's all right,' Potter said softly, smiling at them both, 'but if you must know Mr Malfoy, no I can't tell the time. It must have been my Muggle upbringing.'
"Thank you for earlier," Aria said truthfully breaking the pause. She wasn't sure if she was meant to acknowledge that Draco had protected her in some way, free of his own accord or not.
'It will settle once we bond, the connection will be there, you'll still feel my magic, but you won't become dependant on it.'
"So tell us, Potter, how do you exactly plan to teach us defense spells when you can't cast them."
"Yes," Draco responded irritably.
'I'm sorry - I didn't mean it like that Aria,' Ron sighed heavily, 'I just ... don't want to see you get hurt - not after-'
Draco lowered his head, and muttered in an ashamed tone, even though he was not. "I have grown attached, My Lord."
Just who did they all think they were?
'Draco?' his mother called from the doorway, 'Are you ready to go? You'll be careful won't you, I doubt you'll be treated fairly whilst in Diagon Alley.'
'Ah Draco, you made it,' Potter said, having spotted his approach. 'This is my cousin Dudley, everyone calls him D, and this is Emily. Guys this is Draco.'
'Your bracelet literally allows you to come and go to Malfoy Manor as you please.' Draco explained, he too was looking down at the bracelet, 'and the last one?'
For the first time that evening, he looked along with the Slytherin table. To his surprise, they had gained a cluster of new students, who were swapping stories of their home lives, it wasn't so long ago that he too had done so; well he bragged. His eyes followed the line of students along with the table, sweeping over the second-years, to the seventh surprised by the number of returns Slytherin had. This year would be the hardest for them all, they had, had it so easily last year, the Slytherins had been overlooked, held the superiority. Well with Severus Snape known Death Eater as Headmaster, there was little they could do wrong. Then Draco's eyes settled on a person he hadn't seen since the final battle; Gregory Goyle. Draco merely inclined his head, if Aria was willing to bury the hatchet, then he could do the same, and after all, Goyle owed him one, for saving his life. Goyle would have never made it out, from the Room of Requirement unconscious, but he owed Weasley and Granger more so, for actually saving him.
'Ah,' Blaise acknowledged, but he did not add anything more than that, nothing needs to be said. Pansy entered the common room settling herself down into an empty chair, dumping her bag at her feet.
'Much better,' Aria murmured happily as she felt his magic reach out and wrap her in its shields again. 'How ... what happens now? If we don't...'
'It's gone all around the school, and it wasn't hard to figure out who - well which eighth-year, blond-haired, stuck up, Death Eater, idiot they were talking about - not with how I saw someone hex you earlier -'
Aria took a breath, Narcissa was right, what was going away going to prove after-all.
Concerned looks were exchanged between Fleur and Mrs Weasley. Draco was lost in thought. After a long moment, he said.
'She'll deny it until she's blue in the face, but they are.'
'It's the Daily Prophet, Hermione,' Aria said, 'Of course, they would, this is me we're talking about. They love to use details of my life when the news is low - either they love me or they hate me - I'm surprised the headline wasn't: Savior wastes valuable resources. The Prophet just can't seem to make up its mind on how to portray me.'
'I come to learn a few things,' Draco said earnestly, 'but what I have learned most, is that you're Aria Potter, and once you set your mind to something, there is nothing - nothing - that can stop you.'
'Don't you dare -' his mother said, 'don't you dare transform to try and comfort me - it is not I that you owe an apology to.'
Draco smirked at her, 'That my lady ... was the whole idea.'
There was a murmur of agreement.
Epilogue: Many years later.
Potter came out of the house, slamming the door behind her a big black bag held in her hands and a thunderous look upon her face. 'D, are you sure you haven't got the paperwork. I couldn't see it in the kitchen.' she placed the black bag in a black bin, before walking over.
Aria grimaced, she knew telling Ron would be the hardest, that was why she had chosen to tell him first. Though Ron was not red-faced, Aria could tell he was displeased. It would have been hard to miss, as Ron had gotten to his feet in the blink of an eye, a hand fisting his hair. If Aria was honest, she thought Ron may have thrown a punch at something upon hearing the news, though she was glad that this had been the result.
'I didn't do anything - you did!' Cygnus said, 'And Draco, I've changed my mind, you've got yourself a detention -'
'Of course Aria,' Malfoy said, his posture stiff, his fist clenched at his side. 'May I call you Aria? We are engaged after all. You can call me Draco.'
To make matters worse, Aria had completely disappeared. Draco presumed that she had gone to her Muggle relatives. He just wanted to talk to her, he needed to talk to her. Draco didn't understand how Aria could have not known, she had after-all she had found out about his Veela heritage. But what if she had only figured that out and nothing else, was that why she had not hexed him. He had been expecting her to.
'We should be enjoying it while we can you know, the snow's not gone ... yet,' Ron commented, 'We should enjoy it before we all get jobs that ruin enjoying the nice weather.'
'We had said something.' Narcissa clarified.
'This is Adelaide Reyes, father.'
'If I told you I didn't want you to go?'
Well, one down ... several more people to go.
'Good,' she replied firmly, 'she deserves a bonding. I'd advise you tell her the whole truth next time Draco, she might not be so forgiving.' So his grandmother had known what had caused him to almost lose ... everything he had built with Aria. 'Now I do believe your young lady is free, go dance with her.'
That was it? Bound by a bracelet to sodding Draco Malfoy.
Draco's head snapped up, 'What did you expect me to do, Aria?' his stormy grey eyes full of anger and a hint of determination, 'Do nothing? Let them your aunt and uncle shout at you ... like that - they called you useless, your uncle called you a freak!'
'About time you made it,' Ginny said, 'what happened?'
'Caught? Caught is not the word I'd use.' Aria said. 'There was a horde of fans out there.'
Well, Draco had not been expecting that, as far as he was aware his son could barely stand this girl for he had recognised the name straight away.
Be sure to remember their names, you're going to have to use them whilst we are away otherwise
'Wands!'
'Fine,' Draco conceded, 'The Thicket Den.'
'OK,' Aria said with a firm nod. 'We best head to dinner before your father accuses me of not knowing how to tell the time again.'
'I am calling you by your name,' Aria retorted with a smirk, 'Your surname is Malfoy, is it not?'
Draco could not help himself and as far as he was concerned he had no reason to feel guilty about it either; he felt smug. Very smug and very vain. It was like every fiber of his being coming suddenly alive, he had gotten control of his Veela transformation overnight, and that was on top of kissing Aria Potter and not being hexed to a million pieces for it. A Hogsmeade weekend was coming up - though he had still yet had to ask Aria to go with him, he was certain she would not turn him down. So he saw no reason in feeling guilty about how he was feeling.
'You were there when Aria broke into the Ministry and broke all the Muggle-borns out.' Draco realised, 'So that's what this year has been about - you've been wanting to repay the debt you owe to her for saving your compatible match.'
'I think the bigger picture is here,' Hermione said taking the Daily Prophet from Ron, 'is who they are trying to blame for your current condition.' she glanced over the article, 'though they mention no names they are heavily insinuating that it was foul play -'
'Forget about it,' Ron said, looking around at the shattered bits and pieces on the floor, 'but you could tell us what has you so upset you felt like blowing up half of the room of requirement.'
'After our bonding, we need to decorate it, put the finale wards up into place,' Draco said.
Draco picked up the hairbrush from the unit and softly ran it through her hair.
'Well at least I think she is, I never did really ask, she just sort of ... helped me.'
Draco shook his head, at her slight exaggeration - how was it possible for someone who had been poisoned not that long ago, to be this relaxed now. But Aria was just so carefree like it didn't matter, all that mattered was the boy in front of her.
'Thank you.' Aria said softly barely looking him in the eye, she thrust the cage with his falcon in towards him. 'I thought you'd like him back.'
His father's hung his head, 'I - I did not know ...'
'I am,' Aria said softly, and this time she did pause before adding, 'Draco's Patronus - Ron.'
Everything had just literally spiraled out of control ... and Aria was completely stunned and momentarily angry. Her ankle throbbed, one of her wrists hurt from the way she had landed, the other bleeding slightly from where she had been bitten. It all just spiraled from one simple accident. Nothing could be simple for her, and why the hell hadn't Draco left when she had told him to. They would be damn lucky if an investigation didn't happen now.
........
Ron grimaced and exhaled a breath. 'Aria I think the compatible magic is making you act weird.'
Aria swallowed the lump that formed in her throat, when they were pronounced husband and wife, as soon as Draco's lips met hers, all Draco's feelings along with the presence of his magic hit her senses. His affection; lust, possessiveness, and protectiveness. His love. It was so intense, Aria allowed herself to wallow it all, it reminded her of the first time she and Draco had kissed.
'I was taught that it was rude for a guest to bring dirt into someone's home,' Potter retorted, as though she thought, he didn't think she had any manners.
'It's their first one ... without Fred,' Aria whispered, 'I don't want - I ... I know he was of age, that he made his choice but I still feel guilty and I wouldn't want to add to the reminder of what caused them to lose a son.'
Wow indeed, the platform was its usual busy self, full of parents sending off their children. So far no one had noticed her arrival onto the platform. Aria kept glancing around, as they walked over to the Hogwarts express. Aria levitated Alana's trunk onto the train. Aria nodded and looked around, and found exactly who she had been looking for, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny; who were also loading trunks onto the train.
'Babysitting?' Draco repeated.
Draco smirked to himself at Aria's flustered manner, she got so expressive when she wanted to get her point across. Her words halted, a blush appearing on her cheeks.
'Sorry?'
Dudley was about to speak but he stopped as the door Aria indicated to flew open, to reveal a beefy-looking woman.
'I - surely - there must be something else,' Aria said, 'We can't marry each other - we don't even - we barely -' she stopped once more, pausing trying to think of a better word, though there were several she would like to have used; tolerate, stand, like. Damn her brain! Why wasn't she smarter like Hermione, or out outspoken, well maybe being outspoken like Ron, was wrong for this situation, it would only lead her into trouble - well more trouble. But no, she had to ramble, when nervous or couldn't think, which made her feel and seem like such an idiot, '-know,' yes that was a much better word, 'one another. I still have your son's wand. I'm more than happy to return it!'
'Aria, you will not be in the wrong - no one will. The public does not know that this engagement is just for the year, for they did not need to know that. If you go ahead or if you decide not to, that is up to both you and Draco alone.' Narcissa paused, 'the reason why we wanted to make the announcement was to protect you - both of you - as you are the Saviour and Draco a former Death Eater -'
The spell cascaded towards Aria and she braced herself mentally as much as possible. The pain she expected to feel however did not come, at least not to her. Though the curse hit her it was Draco who had crumpled to the floor, screaming in pain. Aria's eyes went wide. Tears she did not know she had started to fall upon her cheeks.
'Yes, he did have everyone fooled,' Bill said, 'the perfect double agent-'
'Amazing, how did you do all this.'
'Like how he did not try to kiss you?' Fleur mentioned, holding up the holiday photographs Aria had gotten out to show them, as she only just had them printed. 'Because that's what this looks like.'
'Suppose so,' she shrugged, she had not missed the unsaid if you can manage it. Well, challenge accepted, 'Draco.'
'What does it mean?' Draco said.
'Oh no, he's got me,' Aria laughed, pretending to pin to the floor, supporting Teddy in a sitting position on her stomach, 'whatever should I do - help! Someone help me - I've been attacked by the strongest little boy in the world!'
Draco stayed close to her. With the attack from her old Gryffindor friends. They had to stay alert. And only Draco's presence calmed Aria.
'I came to see if you needed anything,' Draco coughed awkwardly trying to hide his own embarrassment, he felt a little out of place, and this was not the impression he had wanted to give her at all - she'd probably be thinking that he was after something more, coming to her room this late at night. 'Before you retire for the night.'
'Is it true ... that you and your friends really defeated a troll, in your first year?'
It wasn't technically a lie. Even if the said first-year had been her.
' ... I do not have the words, for they seem to fail me, for how could I even begin to describe the selflessness of those who bravely fought, that bravely stood up in our darkest hours ... words, they are not enough ... will never be enough to describe. I, however, will not regret that I could not have done more, to do so would be an insult to those who gave their lives, to those who battled and died believing that they were fighting to bring about a better future ...'
Granger gave a heavy sigh, 'Well he can't bloody hex you that's for sure - his wand has been restricted.'
Merlin! What had happened to her? Most scars could be healed magically, leaving no trace - even the curse Aria had used against him had not scarred his chest. But this - it had been the reason she had covered herself up - Draco cursed the damn war - for doing this - for scaring her like this. No wonder she had recoiled from his touch.
'We didn't exactly get on very well Aria,' Draco said calmly, 'How was I meant to know that? How was my mother?'
'Now look who has lost the ability to speak, meet you at the end of breakfast on Saturday.'
'Last time I left alone grandmother, things were said ...' Draco replied, 'So it is not Aria disappearing, that I am concerned about.'
Aria smiled, feeling her cheeks heat up a bit, watching as Epsilon, who had clearly had enough attention now, combing herself back into perfection. 'It came to me ... it just, came to me.' And Aria was glad that for once; Hermione clearly did not know or realise everything. It wasn't that hard to figure out where the name had come from - not if one recalled Astronomy. But in Aria's defense, Epsilon did act a bit like him, and with her grey fur, Epsilon reminded Aria of him too.
Aria forced herself to take a breath. Draco was asking her such a ridiculous question considering that both of them were now in a guest room of Malfoy Manor.
Draco caught Aria rolling her eyes. Miss Dursley left the room, Aria began to place the empty cups back onto the tray. Once she had done that, she got up with the tray in hand. As she neared the door she had come through she was tackled to the ground, the tray flew out of her hands up into the air and came crashing down.
Draco scowled, pausing as he wrote, bloody Cygnus. Bloody stupid Defence Against the Dark Arts, stupid lesson, had to ruin everything. Draco returned to his letter, there was no pointing dwelling on what had happened, he just had to correct it. He just had to. Draco could not get the image of Aria almost breaking down, of how she shook when she been ... well it wasn't exactly speaking to him, but he did not want to think of it as anything else. But her words, the last words he had heard her speak, "I want nothing ... nothing to do with you", Draco ran a hand through his hair again, he had no clue what to say, how to fix this, but by Merlin did he want to.
'You've got it so bad ... so bad.'
Her head needed a break, it was why she on holiday to begin with, but as the return to Hogwarts loomed nearer, the worse her dreams became. Aria counted herself lucky that she hadn't woken anyone up, as Malfoy was sharing a room with Dudley; much to her amazement Dudley seemed to be OK with that arrangement, and she had been sharing Emily. But the room sharing with Emily meant one thing - she couldn't use magic - and Aria knew from the many times Hermione and Ginny had told her, she talked in her sleep. It was embarrassing enough Dudley and Ron knew, she didn't need Malfoy added into the picture, as Aria was pretty sure Dudley had told Emily what to expect. What she needed most was some sleep.
Aria merely rolled her eyes at him. 'You try talking to a very stubborn unicorn Malfoy, about taking a tail hair without getting hurt.'
Thought she knew! Aria had heard it all now.
'She's not wearing your bracelet.'
'You alright Aria?' Hermione whispered.
'What happened to you?'
"He could have told you about the prophecy, though he chose not."
"I've been needing to speak with you," Aria said. "Well to ask you really. Because from someone wanting and failing miserably at it, why would someone go from trying to kill me to being overprotective of me? It doesn't make any sense. And even Draco says he has become obsessed with my protection."
'Oh! You want to prove that you're better-'
'Of course, I was,' Aria muttered, withholding the sarcasm from her voice. How had she talked herself into this again, and why of all the subjects did it have to be history. No wonder she was beginning to fall asleep.
'Oh get over it! I could have been in Slytherin ... big deal!' she called out over the chatter that had broken out, waving it off. 'And lastly, if you have ever been judgemental of a person.'
'Is this the way to the platform? For Hogwarts?'
Draco slumped back, in a manner she had never seen him use before, so that he rested upon a desk of the classroom they had been using. Aria wondered if the question was rhetorical or if he had actually been asking her, Aria moved so that she rested upon a desk near his.
'So what do they mean ... the runes?'
"Hermione gave you this?"
'Draco?'
Draco blinked, stunned, 'You're going to have to tell me more than that love.'
Draco snorted.
'Oh, it is,' Alana said, 'I'm a Slytherin, so you'll have no idea when to expect them.'
'I can think of worse ways of spending my time, Draco. Forget it. Try a different memory. You're on the right track - just have a bit of patience -'
'I didn't fix the family tapestry Aria,' Draco responded, 'I restored it, to its former glory. And added to it, slightly.'
'And thank you, I know it may not sound like much but thank you for saving our lives when we were -'
Aria glanced down towards her sleeve, hidden underneath it was the bracelet Draco placed upon her during her capture, the very bracelet that had given her a sense of freedom, the very bracelet that bound them together. Bound them in the ancient ways of magic.
'Merlin you and Potter kissed? No wonder your head was in the clouds.'
'Draco can cast magic outside of Hogwarts, his classified as an adult in our world,' Aria clarified, 'I can't believe you - either you have a death wish or you were just - just completely reckless.'
'Nah,' Aria grinned mischievously, and she turned to their children and Miss Reyes. 'Got everything, good, let's go.'
'So ... why are you so uptight about your cousin and ...' Blaise's whispered his eyes flickered towards Aria.
Hermione raised her eyebrows, Ron was looking at her in complete confusion.
'So you're in agreement then, Draco and yourself will be engaged -' Aria raised her eyebrows at Mrs Malfoy, she really had to read up on old wizarding customs and meanings, if courting meant engagement. But at least it would be just for a year.
'Susan Bones and Hannah Abbott, as well,' Pansy said thoughtfully, 'So far I've only heard about Daphne signing up.'
'Wow ... magic ... is so cool!'
'To be honest, I'm still finding this compatible magic thing ... a bit daunting.' Aria said, 'It's like it's changed Draco - or well ... if I tell you something - promise you won't tell anyone else?' Neville and Luna both nodded. 'Draco swore a magical binding oath - so I don't know if it's that ... his being a Veela - the compatible magic - or that fact that he, you know ... might actually like me.' Aria rubbed at her face, 'so, yeah, it's daunting.'
'Speaking of which I wondered why it did not match yours -'
The door opened to the room Aria was being kept in. The first thing she saw was Voldemort's gleaming red eyes, though Aria would not find a hint of motives there. He didn't look like he was going to kill her at that exact moment for his wand was not at hand. He was not alone. Pale-faced more than normal entered Draco Malfoy carrying a tray upon which had the lastest meal. Aria caught Draco's eye. Just how humiliating, she had not been released for meals. The person who came with them usually had to try to force her to eat. The last Death Eater that tried left covered with food. Aria didn't care if she hadn't acted very ladylike when she spat the food out all over the Death Eater she barely remembered the name of.
Yes a whole two lovely months before Hogwarts started back up, Aria had jumped at the chance to repeat her last year when the offer came. She had not realised Malfoy was returning also.
'BALL!' Aria seemed to be battling with what emotion to show first, anger or frustration, 'no he did not.'
'Shut it you!'
'So have you figured out what they mean?'
Just what was going on?
'I think it's more than just the oath - it is rather confusing. Thinking that he'll be one way and his not - though he hasn't lost that arrogant smirk of his.'
'So do tell us, you said you were going away, where exactly will you be traveling to? And you mentioned friends,' his mother asked.
.....
'You do!' Aria shoved his shoulder playfully.
"Is there?"
'How -' Draco croaked, he had the right to know - but he did not want to know the answer at the same time, especially if Aria had been with someone - like that.
'All I ask ... is for you to tell me - things ... preferably before I hear them from someone else.' Aria said, 'That would be the best courting gift I could receive for now.'
Aria didn't stop playing with him either, not once, while his aunt and mother chatted - well apart from when she changed him or fed him - they changed their games - Aria supported him to sit up, and helped him play with some soft blocks - building them up and knocking them down again. Put him on his stomach to encourage him to learn to crawl, the five-month-old was starting to grasp the idea that he had to move his arms and legs together to move. Until finally Teddy began to tire.
Let me know about Wednesday,
'Would someone just tell me what I've supposedly done?'
'You are not -'
'She's very insightful, of course, I've been speaking with Hermione.' Aria said rolling her eyes. 'One would think that I'm not clever enough to work it out myself.'
Draco sneered at the direction the voice had come from, his friend was shaking his head at him, 'Fuck off Blaise ... just - fuck off.'
'Oh, shut up, you.' Aria replied Draco noticed her cheeks were a little flushed and her small smile. Her magic felt at ease, which in turn made Draco feel the same way, he slipped his hand towards hers and squeezed it. 'Library?'
'Why? What happened?'
"These are no ordinary bracelets, my precious one." Voldemort continued. "I believe a demonstration is in order. Crucio!"
'Umph!'
Aria looked up from her plate laden with Mrs Weasley excellent cooking, her return to The Burrow had been a reluctant one, she had not wanted to leave the warm safety Malfoy Manor or to be precise Draco Malfoy's magic was beginning to provide. Her guilt had driven her away and had driven her right back again a couple days later, once her head felt clearer and she herself a lot calmer.
Aria looked up at the sudden whispers, it didn't take long to figure out what the whispers around her were about, several of the female students were gazing towards the staff table, it was then Aria took note of who was on the table. McGonagall was in the throne-like chair, Flitwick was missing - Aria presumed he was with the first-years. Hagrid, Slughorn, Sprout joined her at the table along with the other professors and one person she recognised, with silvery-blond hair and pointed features.
'I'm not going to get hurt Ron,' Aria said, 'Besides, Draco swore that he wouldn't hurt me. I trust him. So even if you can't, could you at least trust me.' Aria stood up, intent on walking to the girls' dorms but stopped after several steps, she turned and faced one of her best friends. 'I'm tired Ron, I've had enough. I've done my part and I'm done fighting. I did what I was meant to do, I now want to live my life. I don't want to chase after any more crazy dangerous wizards, as much as I've loved the adventure that came with it. I don't want to be what people expect me to be anymore, I'm done.' Aria took a breath, looking at him as earnestly as she could. 'I'm done, Ron. No more fighting, the war is over, I just want to move on from it, and leave the shitty mess that it was, where it should be, behind me.'
'Sorry, I forgot Emily had it, it's in her bag.' he replied quite calmly and closed the boot. 'We're all good to go.'
It sounded like she had contemplated doing just that, Thank Merlin she had seen some sense.
Lessons had started up the following day, and he already disliked a lesson. The whispers and looks of disgust he could handle, he was a Malfoy and well above it, not to mention McGonagall had threatened to strip his Head Boy status if he tried anything, he had only gotten it because she felt as though he could learn something from it, and because of McGonagall's new hope of inter-house unity. And Aria had taken it all in her stride and began to promote it too, by firstly accepting Pansy's apology. But he did not like being made a fool of, yes there were those smarter than him, but they had never made him look foolish as his cousin had.
'Aria you were barely breathing -'
Draco murmured his agreement, it was disappointing that one person from their house had signed up. He looked at both Blaise's and Pansy's expectant faces. 'Fine, I'll do it.'
Draco's stormy grey eyes searched her own once more, and a warmness filled the air as his magic reached out. 'I honestly thought you knew. I - I'd thought you had worked it out when you had worked out about my Veela heritage. I gathered you'd figured out about the compatible magic, and how Veela's - ' he shrugged his shoulders, 'I know we should have told you from the beginning ... the truth that is ... but if I'm honest I couldn't face another rejection from you.'
Draco found himself staring at the window, a little bored from all the last-minute checks, that he and his parents were doing in one of the sitting rooms within the Manor. He was fed up, considering they had already gone through the checks the previous day. Surely they didn't need to check the arrangements over this much.
'What do you mean?' Aria said, 'I don't recall - oh my -'
And though Draco's body had fallen so he lay on his side, his breathing was even, and as she reached him his grey eyes shot open filled with what she could only describe as pure hatred. Aria could tell that Draco knew that she was there, that she had come to see how he was for herself, and to help him up. But Draco did not take her extended hand, he pushed himself up and settled for scowling at Neumann. And though it was the Professor's fault that Draco had flew across the room, Draco's shield had not been strong enough to take the offending blow. Something Professor Neumann pointed out in a criticising tone for he said, as the bell rang; 'Shield needs more power behind it Mr Malfoy. Do take yourself to the Hospital Wing.'
'Dromeda.'
Aria shook her head, 'Not after Hedwig.' She gave no other explanation, it needed no other explanation.
'The only fool was me,' Aria said, 'When I was younger, I thought that if I did well ... if I could just do one thing to please them, that I could change how my aunt and uncle felt ... nothing was ever good enough. I gave up in the end, I realised that no matter what I did, I was never going to be as precious as their little Dudley.' Draco caught her rolling her eyes. 'I didn't know anything ... completely ignorant of magic - they told me that it wasn't real and I was punished if anything freaky happened - if I cast accidental magic, not that I knew what I was doing, of course. Dudley was a shit that made school life hell ... then I'd returned to get even more of it back at theirs. It was never home to me. They couldn't care less about me, well not Dudley, not now.'
