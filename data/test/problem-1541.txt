, and it’s not as though all wizards are, are… scapegoating twats, or what have you. It’s innocent people getting hurt here.”
He approves, too, of the colour of the new sheets. Harry knows, because he asks. “Better than the others?”
Malfoy dropped his hands into his pockets. “Ah, I see. Just let you walk out of here with the near-priceless ancient texts that are the key to securing Hogwarts, so that you can translate them in some as-yet-to-be-determined manner, which may or may not involve losing or staining them?”
It did make his life more comfortable. It did come with influence. It did involve parties and hobnobbing and the sorts of circles Potter was so quick to write off as chock full of posh arseholes. It did make him money, if not as much as he’d spent. And while he didn’t care about losing the Manor—let the Goblins take the damn thing, he’d be glad to be rid of it—that did rather seem to underscore Potter’s point, if he really thought about it. Aside from his own fear of failure, it wasn’t costing him much at all. It wasn’t the sort of sacrifice redemption stories usually seemed to require.
“Pansy.” Draco turned towards her so quickly he pushed his chair aside in the process. “Where did you hear that?”
The silent treatment comes with another advantage. It lets me daydream my way through yesterday’s events in as much detail as I see fit.
She shrugged apologetically. “Either way, here we are. I share Hermione’s concerns. If you leave, it throws things out of balance. There’s no way of knowing how the Gobstones would fall. If they’ll go back to the surgery, if they’ll bring in someone else to try to train him to use the Elder Wand, and Merlin only knows how that would go.”
Draco’s heart pounded. “Merlin,” he breathed. “I’ll be damned.” He turned to Harry. “I think she’s done it.”
Shacklebolt made an attempt at a conciliatory smile, though it looked decidedly strained. “Let’s see what Dr Malfoy and I can work out, shall we?”
“If you would like to access Ministry records I am equipped to supply you with form MM-OOBP-QXP-23: Request for Access to Ministry Records.”
Before Harry can suggest a different approach, the next bookcase is zipping towards him. And so they go on for an hour, Draco standing so far away that Harry can’t even make out the filigree on his robes, let alone touch him. Let alone kiss him.
Across the table, Malfoy nattered on blithely. There had been, Harry learned, a cold front coming in from Wiltshire that had pushed a seasonal wind current towards London, and it was usually a particularly warm current, and Malfoy had missed it completely when, apparently, the meteorolowizard on the WWN had not only predicted a cold front, but had advised that the mixture of cold and warm air would produce showers across London, and Malfoy had been caught completely unprepared, soaked through too quickly to even cast an
There was no way Potter would understand any of that. Or wouldn’t willfully misunderstand it, even if he did.
“Why would you do that?” Harry couldn’t help it, it burst out before he could even really consider the question.
She threw her hands up in exasperation. “It was a problem with a wand! We were solving a wandlore problem!”
He hadn’t scheduled a Portkey; the Ministry wasn’t to know, yet, that he was gone. But he’d scheduled his day around a multi-stop Apparition starting at 8am, to make sure he had enough time to recover, if needed.
He’d zipped his flies when he heard a cough behind him, and was halfway to cursing himself for turning around so eagerly when Draco spoke.
“Nevermind,” Harry said. “It’s not—I—I don’t even know yet, and, anyway, I—If you have a moment, I—There’s something else I’d like to discuss.”
“Shall we move to the next?” Draco set his fork down to cue the change of course before anyone had a chance to answer. Potter’s fork disappeared from between his fingers.
“That they are. But we’re Wizards, remember? What’s an Episky between—” he paused. “Between us. Unless you’re planning to curse them off?”
The feeling of Malfoy pressing up into him was perfect, and utterly unsatisfying. He reached for the top button on Malfoy’s trousers. He’d been surprised, last time, at the row of tiny buttons. This time he made quick work of them and tugged at Malfoy’s waistband. Malfoy lifted his hips and let Harry push them over his knees, and Malfoy kicked them and his pants and his loafers off together, and then he was under Harry, naked, and the smooth planes of his skin seemed to go on forever. Except for his cock, his hard, pink, perfect cock. Harry wanted to feel Malfoy’s legs intertwined with his own, wanted to wrap himself around them. He wanted to be so close to Malfoy that everything fell away.
“Well,” Draco shivers. Clears his throat. Searches for the upper hand. “Well, that’s one mystery solved.”
Their footsteps retreated. Harry saw the edges of a flash, and heard a door slamming open, and a bang, and then Malfoy’s posh, indignant tones asking what the bloody hell was going on, and then Susan’s brusque pronouncement that, “You’re under arrest.”
It’s an opportunity, Harry realises, and rushes on. “Look –” Draco starts to raise a hand in objection and Harry grabs it, twines their fingers together. “Just listen for a second. Okay?” He pauses. “Please?”
Two sharp knocks on the door startle him out of his seat. Ron doesn’t knock like that, nor Hermione, nor Robards or Proudfoot or anyone else he can think of. There’s one person who probably would, though. He smooths his hair and his robes and steadies his breathing, and summons his wand.
“It made a difference. Made it easier to say some of those things, knowing you’d step in if anything went wrong.”
Rather than seeming especially put out, Malfoy gave him an indulgently warm smile. “Never hurts to be prepared, does it,
Malfoy was staring intently at the newspaper, and all Harry could see was the headline, the top of his head, and the martini that sat to his left.
He speaks to the Wizengamot with conviction. With certainty. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Draco smile.
“Yes, Doctor Malfoy. The Minister is aware that you are living abroad. I am authorised to arrange his travel to Paris if you are willing to meet with him.”
Beside him, he heard Harry’s breath catch. “Might not, no.” Harry twined their fingers together and held on.
Leaving the room was almost as shocking as entering it had been. Even though it had been dimmed, the light was blinding and loud by comparison and he wanted to shrink away from it.
“Fuck, Draco. All of this, I thought maybe, after all this waiting...but no.” Potter laughs again, and this time it’s a cracked, half-empty sort of a sound. “You still can’t.” He sighs. “Maybe you never will.”
Still caught up in the state of mind that seemed to come from running, Potter complied without objection.
“Yes,” Harry replies. He nods and repeats the word. “Yes.” He drops Draco’s hand to step through the Floo.
Harry stared, just for a moment, and then wrapped a hand around it and brought it to his mouth. The corners of his lips stretched as he sank onto it, and then Malfoy's hand was back on his head, guiding him deeper down and holding him there. Harry sucked and Malfoy moaned, deeply enough that Harry could feel it. He exhaled and began to bob his head, thrilling as his forehead grazed the buttons of Draco's waistcoat on the way down.
He uncorks one now, takes a long pull, and falls back on to the chaise. Potter, bloody Potter and his meddlesome, naïve,
“Friendship, is it? Everyone here seems to have the most interesting definitions of that word.” He pushed his plate away. “Seeing as he and I are, apparently, total strangers, perhaps introductions are in order?”
He didn’t see Harry. Not at breakfast with Pansy and Greg and Blaise and Millie, though they seemed surprised by his absence. Not at the meeting, which was so full of hot air Draco almost forgot it was January and was, therefore, more of the same; delay, deny, tantalise, promise, and extract more time. At least Shacklebolt—who had sent Draco a tally of charitable demands in the low five figures just after New Year’s Eve and found them all funded by the next close of business—was keeping his word, arguing for Harry’s recovery even as Croaker and Robards grew more, and more openly, frustrated with it. And while that might’ve been enough to make him long for his quiet flat and his quiet office, it wasn’t enough to keep him from walking the gardens, or visiting the stables, or examining the boundaries of the void, or checking the condition of the plants in the conservatory.
—how to do this. Harry will hit a wall at the end of the aisle he’s chosen, he’ll have to circle round, and Draco will get there first.
“Prippa!” Draco resorted to shouting, in part because he suspected there was no other way to be heard over her wailing.
“Amit’s been crying about it for days. He’ll be gladder to see it than his own mother!” She throws Draco a blinding, grateful smile. “Never thought we’d see it again!”
Not that it matters, particularly because, as he walks past Section G, he realises that Potter’s no longer visible from this distance. He must be doing it, then. Going through all those things .
He crooks his finger and runs the back of it, feather light, over the underside of Harry’s shaft and Merlin but he could cry with relief.
The fire died down as soon as Millie ended the call. Draco stood and surveyed the room. He’d thrown back the sheets in his rush to the Floo and bed called out to him, but he knew he had no hope of falling back to sleep.
Draco has a drinks cabinet in his office for the obvious reasons: loosening informants’ lips, putting troublesome staff at ease before a good bollocking, an occasional congratulations for some intrepid reporter or other, drinking.
“Right.” Harry’s eyes went back and forth between the chairs and the sofa. He shifted his weight to the other side. “Right,” he repeated. He walked past the chairs and sat, very tentatively, on the settee.
He knew this script, knew it could break the storm and bring the rain. Knew, too, that it usually didn’t. That more often than not, it was sticky hard floors and sweaty bollocks and the mechanics of in and out. That this soaring charge was one in a million.
And Potter will want him for a quick shag now and then, and won’t that be glorious. Merlin, he wants Potter bound again, wants him tied to a headboard, his legs spread, that gorgeous cock in his mouth. Wants Potter shooting down his throat this time.
Harry set his hands on the edge of the table and looked Draco right in the eye. “I’d like to tell you why I didn’t see you, and I’d like to tell you what’s happened since I last did. If it bothers you that I asked Millie to schedule, I’m sorry. I didn’t know that you’d see me otherwise.”
Noon arrived, and then one, and he figured it was safe to start walking to the conservatory, even if that meant, in the interest of caution, walking very slowly through the foyer and down the corridor past the music room and the morning room, and slowing down even more when the great glass doors to the conservatory came into view at the end of the hall.
Draco didn’t look up until his papers were in order, and found Potter, still holding out the mobile. “I’ve got a phone, thanks.” He paused. “Two, actually, both much nicer than that bit of rubbish.”
Harry snorted and raised his glass. “Best watch your compliments. My head might explode under the influence of such effusive praise.”
Harry stumbled out into an empty living room. Of all the things he’d imagined and tried to plan for, the possibility of
Harry pulled his wand from his pocket and stepped back into a dueling stance. Draco wondered if he noticed or if it was pure habit. He wondered, too, if it meant he was about to see Harry’s competitive side, which made his heart race in a way that didn’t feel anything like fear or trepidation.
“What about something more advanced?” Draco asked “You’re known for your Patronus Charm. Would you try it?”
“And Godric, too.” Draco paused to watch Harry’s mouth bend into a smile and relax again. “What would you do if you left? Have you given it any thought?”
“There’s a reason Granger and I are the only two members of the Reconstruction willing to perform the ritual. It could be a bit dangerous. The element of unpredictability only adds to that. We’d assumed it required two people, but it may be, if it has to be present, that the snake counts as one. Having a third shouldn’t be problematic, but it does raise the issue of the particular requirements involved in having you talk to the snake.”
“And both of those options, when I thought about them, and talked to Hermione about them, and then Ron, too, and, if this isn’t too many surprises for one meal, Pansy—”
“But there is something else, of course. We at the Trauma Resource Centre strive to change the way members of the British wizarding community see one another, the ways we’re able to care for one another.” He smiled humbly at the crowd. “It may be easy to see one person or a group of people as the symbols of the war, to pretend it only happened to witches and wizards who were on the front lines. That’s not entirely true, though, is it? All of us, on both sides of the war, whether in the middle of the fight or sitting at home hoping desperately for words of missing friends and family… we all fought a battle of some sort, and we all bear the scars for it. When we acknowledge that, when we share that weight with one another instead of carrying it alone, we can begin a type of healing that isn’t otherwise possible.
Draco knew, instinctively, that if he paused to consider the question Harry would spook, but knew, too, that it contained dimensions he couldn’t quite grasp in the moment. He tried to keep his voice even and hope for the best. “Of course. It’s important for you to explore any feelings that might affect your magic. Your overall wellbeing, really.”
Potter opens his mouth and closes it again. He’s searching for words. Draco knows how hard that must be for him.
And then there’d been that damned smirk, and Malfoy’s insistence that Harry meet his eye, and ‘you should try it some time.’ It wasn’t just a brush-off, Harry was sure of it. You didn't have that kind of history of getting under someone's skin, or them under yours, without picking up a few things about their tells, and Harry knew Malfoy was up to something.
“Mistress,” Prippa sobbed, “Mistress says Master is coming home and is making things change. Mistress does not know if she will have to leave!”
“Yes. In case you hadn’t noticed,” Draco rolls his hips under Harry, “there are some things that make me quite happy.”
Nothing hurts. He’s fine. Can’t quite manage to say it, though, or anything else. Not when Harry’s flushed and tensed and suddenly looks so much like the boy Draco used to know.
One has more appeal. The other would do more lasting good. He considers how he would feel after each, and quickly decides that it’s an ill-advised line of inquiry. One item on the list has question marks next to it; he’ll go for the other.
“It’s a blind item, Higsbee. Can’t be sued over those, we haven’t accused anyone of anything.” He holds up a hand when Higsbee moves to interrupt. “And yes, I’m sure. Though if you repeat that to anyone, I’ll see it printed in your blood.”
“Shall I do a Shrinking Charm as well, or would you rather do it yourself?” Draco held out the stack of files.
Or maybe to suck him off until he’s incoherent with want, or to punch him in the face, or to stand there, bold and powerful and unflinching as he always is, and ask Draco why, and what he wants, and what he’s doing.
“Oh!” straightened, looking serious, and then dissolved into laughter. “Sorry. Sorry. We got a bit… Pansy Side-Alonged us back. Figure we could take the Floo back to mine, but Blaise was hungry and…”
Draco cringes. If Pansy is 98% shame-proof, all things Potter are the other 2%. Which will rather predispose Blaise to a certain stance on the matter, too.
“Of all the things you could’ve said. Not that I’m not pissed off about the fucking blind, mind you, but it’s pretty bloody low on the list.”
“I wanted to ask you something.” Anxiety flashes across Draco’s face and Harry rushes to assuage it. “Not something bad! I don’t think so, anyway. I mean, you might, but, okay. Look.”
But he stood across from Draco Malfoy, and he heard him talk about work, and art, and love, and suffering, and peace, and he believed him.
Though “generous” is not a concept Draco’s particularly concerned with when he realises who he’s looking at. The height, the dreadlocks, the line of a face caught in profile. Oh, yes. He can certainly work with this. It’s material for the front of the section. Probably would be even if Lee Jordan hadn’t turned him down in favour of the WWN.
He reached out for Harry, twining his fingers through his hair, running them through again and again. And then Harry pulled off and opened his mouth wider, and Harry took him in all at once, and Draco missed it for arching back, groaning, panting as Harry worked up a rhythm.
But as his eyes adjusted he could see that there weren’t any aisles, nor were there any prophecies. These were lights, glimmering in gold and blue. He reached out a hand to touch one. It was glass, warm to the touch.
“For someone else, maybe. For Harry Potter, hero of the war and Head of Auror Field Operations? Every criminally minded wizard in a thousand mile radius came to try and draw him into some trap or another. And word spread. They arrested half a dozen Yakuza and two New York Muggle mobsters, who tried just because they had heard something about an ultimate weapon. And once they were all in England, they didn’t exactly all sit around enjoying strawberries and clotted cream. Crime was up twenty percent in the second quarter of the year. Wizarding and Muggle.”
When he finished his half, Harry slipped his arm through Draco’s and reached his other hand into the bag. They stood like that, side by side on the embankment, until the coffee was gone and the croissants devoured.
Potter studied him, squinted as if trying to see through him. “You’re not going to fight me on this?”
The portrait laughs. “Except that. But I’m afraid that’s largely unavoidable if you hope to live an interesting life.”
have a happy, prosperous, trouble-free life in the Muggle world, and I’d like to keep it that way. And you’re asking me to hand you just enough material to charge me with extortion or report me to the FSA, without getting enough to bring you down with me if you try it? I think not.”
They lay there, hearts slowing, breath evening out, until an edge of anxiety crept into Draco’s satiation. “Do you think,” he began, “in spite of your very luxe hotel room, you might stay the night?”
“Very well. I’ll be in the front office if you,” what? Draco scrambles. If you need me? If you want me? If there’s something I can give you? If you want to interrupt a job I’ll almost certainly be too distracted to do? “I’ll be in the front office.”
Harry sat onto his knees, stretching around to find Draco staring at him. He looked a bit more contemplative than Harry was used to at this particular point in the proceedings and, Harry thought, a bit lost.
“Did you wear jeans to one of London’s premier financial institutions for safety, too? Or is that down to poor taste?”
Through the charmed window, Harry saw Malfoy straighten, and every trace of weariness was wiped away. His face was so blank, so haughty and proud, that ten years ago Harry might’ve sworn it was Lucius. Malfoy held himself stiffly, hands folded neatly and back ramrod straight, as though he was waiting for a tardy business associate rather than an indictment.
“As I would have done if you’d contacted me in some manner more effective than hurling pebbles at a Protego.”
“Obviously,” Harry bites, folding his arms in front of him, partly as a gesture of defiance, partly because it’s as close as he’ll come to hugging himself in front of Draco right now.
I studied him, not entirely sure of whether he was joking, or what about. His brow was furrowed and he squinted as he tried to fix a letter. He had a smear of blue paint on the back of his left hand. He kept licking his lips and then biting them, rolling his bottom lip between his teeth as he worked. If he was joking, it wasn’t evident to look at him.
Potter looked properly green about the edges, but he didn’t object. He cast, and his famous stag emerged from his wand, cantered a wide circle around them, and disappeared through the trunk of a Maple tree on Draco’s right.
Pansy got really furious then, sort of shoved you into the wall and jumped back and I saw that she’d pulled her wand. You pulled yours too and tried to disarm her, told her she was being ridiculous.
Draco popped open the top button of Potter’s flies. “Yeah.” He pulled down the zipper and saw Potter’s hips buck towards his hand. Fuck, but he wanted to touch. He was going to touch. He wanted to touch Potter so well that everything else slipped away, so that it was all that existed in the world. “How…?”
Draco moves slowly, rolling his hips as he lowers the fabric. He reveals the edge of a patch of honey-blond hair.
“Er, yes sir.” Higsbee doesn’t leave. “But they’ll want to know, down in F and L, where it came from.”
Malfoy hummed. “Take a Severing Curse, for instance. Its effect is clear, but there are several different ones that build from the same basic magical function. If we can separate the strands of the curse, we might use them to provide Healers with a new tool. They can’t repair curse damage from Severing Curses at the moment, but if we could isolate the part of the curse that has to do just with cutting, rather than with cutting destructively, or cutting in a way that can’t be stopped, they might be able to. Curses respond to other curses in a way they don’t to healing magic, such that, for instance, using a modified curse might allow Healers to cut out a section of cursed bone and then regrow it using Skele-Gro, such that the curse damage is effectively cured.”
“I’d tell you to ask nicely,” he began, something incendiary uncurling in his stomach, “but we both know getting you to say please takes a lot more effort on my part. And I’m afraid I’ve got a meeting in an hour.”
Draco cranes his neck and takes the tip in his mouth, hollowing his cheeks around it. He loves the solid weight in his mouth and strains forward for more.
Prippa’s chin quavered. She looked down and noticed that she was squeezing the cloak, squeaked, and abruptly burst into hysterical tears. “Mistress is saying Master can take Prippa away from Mistress! Prippa does not want to leave her Mistress!”
Speaking of, if my writing has fallen off of late, it’s not only because my parents are determined to keep me engaged at all hours, but because my few spare moments have been devoted to writing to him. He’s not an especially eloquent correspondent but, especially given Granger’s rather pointed scoffing when he promised to write, I think I’m lucky to be getting letters from him at all. And while he may be less inclined towards poetry than recounting the particulars of his holiday at The Burrow, the more imaginative details he includes are really quite enough to be going on with.
’s editorial team is in a constant, ceaseless, high-priority hunt for pictures of Potter, and when several land on their desks they don’t even recognise him.
“No permanent harm done.” He glanced quickly at the end of a wand handle sticking out of Harry’s pocket, and said nothing. “Shall we sit?”
Potter steps around the edge of the door looking strangely eager and, even more strangely, not especially like a damp Kneazle.
The front office is unattended. He hasn’t finished labelling Harry’s items. He could use this time to dust things. This vantage point, even. That’s what he should be doing. Much closer to what he should be doing.
Potter yielded easily this time. Didn’t even yield so much as meet Draco with enthusiasm. Draco pressed his lips against Potter’s, and Potter opened his mouth to deepen the kiss. When Draco pulled him close, Potter went. When Draco nipped at his lip, he felt the hint of a moan bubble up in Potter’s chest. This was the problem with Gryffindors, he thought. Or one of them. Giving them too much time to think was never a good idea.
subscription knows you’re impulsive. Burning buildings, dark magic, none of that’s any match for your—well, I say insanity, but I hear others prefer to call it “courage.” But those who actually know you also know that you’re rather intensely private. A million rumours about the number of dark wizards you’ve captured, not a single one about your private life.”
But the decision was made, he reminded himself. And he thought Harry would be glad of it. And in the meantime he could try to make the next few days a bit more pleasant for both of them. He started by asking Galder to bring him a Quaffle and sending Harry a note, asking to meet in the terrace gardens instead of the conservatory.
“What’s—?” Potter paused, the lines in his forehead growing deeper. “What’s the difference between them? And why does it change things?”
Anyway, I Stupefied her, levitated her to her bed, and did it all with magic. Fortunately, I brought a book, and I’ll Rennervate and Obliviate before the Ministry coordinator arrives.
He chanced a glance over his shoulder. Potter was still surrounded by the kittens, one of whom had scaled his jumper and found a perch on his shoulder. Potter and the kitten both watched Draco with an identical tilt to their heads.
Dittany was the obvious answer. If it came in the form of a hot, infused bath Draco was that much more grateful for it.
When he tugged on Potter’s hand, pointing down towards the grass, Potter took the hint. He pulled Draco down with him, and the pressure of his hands was second only to the pressure of their bodies together.
“But I’m here, all the same, and I do. Maybe suffering would be better. Purer. Ironically enough…purer. Maybe it shouldn’t be possible—maybe it shouldn’t be allowed—for someone who’s done what I’ve done to love something as much as I love all of this.” He waved a hand to show Potter the trees and the murals and everything that lay beyond. “I do, you know. Love it. Maybe it’s simply wrong, maybe it’s profoundly unjust, that I should get to love something this much and make it my life’s work. My daily work. But I know what suffering does, what stories of suffering do, and this feels… That always felt bitter and violent and full of rage, and that’s what it created. I want to be done with that. I don’t want to feel that way anymore. I don’t want anyone else to feel that way. And I think, sometimes, when I look at the paintings and when I lie in the grass, that no one who feels the way I do when I see a new work of art for the first time could ever do the things I did at seventeen. I think maybe that feeling, especially if wizards get it from Muggles and share it with Muggles, could keep other people from doing what I did, or believing what I did. I do think this can do something good. Truly, I do, Potter.” As he said it, he was reassured to find that his body was settling. There was no nausea, nothing unsettled skittering through his stomach, no tension banded around his lungs. It felt like telling the truth.
“You’re the one who’s gave half a dozen post-war speeches about the importance of moving on. One might think you were familiar with the idea.”
He’s half ready to pull out his wand and dry himself off when Malfoy issues a command. “Take your shoes off and follow me.”
“Yes, I’m determined to leave. I’ve been here longer than I meant to be already. I have a career and a home. A research agenda to pursue. Colleagues. Friends. Students to direct. Mother; I do miss her.” He ran a hand through his hair. “And even if I did stay, what of it? I can’t be the person here that I am in Paris. I miss walking through the city. Going out to eat. He and I could never do that together.”
“However, in the course of their duties this team retrieved a dangerous magical artefact. Auror Potter’s experience and magical ability made him the best candidate for safely transporting this item, which is unstable and may react to magical traces in the vicinity.”
I have, of course, so his delighted infatuation with a singular task was nothing new, He took to the brush as easily as the broom, letting it become an extension of his body. He did not surpass me for skill, but for enthusiasm, no one could rival him.
“I know, and that you’ve made progress there is obvious and very, very important. I think—I hope—you know I feel that way.”
“Not—I don’t mean to be rude. Dr Malfoy is fine. You started calling me Harry, and we stopped working together the same way we had been, so I haven’t been sure.”
Harry smiled at that and raised his eyebrows pointedly at Hermione, who returned the smile. The owl who’d delivered his morning
Harry shuddered and leaned in to him, wrapping an arm around Draco’s neck and resting his forehead on the opposite shoulder. Draco felt Harry’s breath coming in pants against him, felt him nodding his approval.
“Sorry,” Draco mumbles, and makes his way to the other side of the bed. “Just—sorry.” He brings his hands to his clasps and slips each hook free of its eye, until they hang loose from his shoulders.
He brings Draco’s head to his lips and kisses it, just as Draco had done to him. He barely hears the thin whimper that escapes from Draco’s throat, but he’s heartened by its existence all the same.
“You see, I’ve been putting all of my considerable resources into this case, and just before you told me you’d decided to take another route, I discovered what I believe to be a significant breakthrough. A comprehensive theory that would explain your symptoms and present a viable alternative course of treatment.”
“You’ve got at least one tattoo that says otherwise.” She chucked the pillow back at him, and when it landed on his face he was happy enough to leave it there.
“Here we are at bakeware. Please be aware that these sections are organised differently to those where we store larger items. For instance, rather than being sorted by date of arrival, as in our furniture section, bakeware is organised by intended use, then size, with a special section for those items, such as holiday baking tins, that do not fit within standard parameters. Are you aware of any such specialised items?”
“Yeah,” Harry looks at him sadly. “I guess it is.” Draco’s heart threatens to scream at the broken look Potter gives him. “Well, thanks. For your help.” He tries to smile, but it doesn’t take. “Good luck with everything.”
“One’s first time often is.” Draco stands and Merlin, but his cock is aching. He goes through the exercise of straightening his robes, mostly to ensure that the fabric is displayed to discretion’s best advantage. He can’t let Potter see, not the way he’s just seen Potter. Not any of it.
Draco half-laughed. “Turns out, that starting us out bit, you did.” He let the corners of his mouth turn up. “What else do you know how to do?”
“It was not,” Draco said. “It was a useful dinner, during which I was able to learn quite a few interesting tidbits. And I do hope you both realise that, sensationalistic headlines aside, being seen with Potter isn’t likely to be terrible for my reputation.”
“Have to agree,” Blaise added. “Burning vaguely phallic objects? Disintegrating his own clothes? Potter’s subconscious is about as subtle as the rest of him.”
“What will it mean for our world, to raise a generation that is taught that their blood status is who they are? That it is not their intention—not their virtue—that determines their ends or the means they use to reach them, but the unalterable fact of their blood?
to discard and other things too, probably, definitely. He pulls himself up, ignores the shakiness in his knees, and begins to rebutton his robes.
There was a weekly calendar inside, which seemed odd. Then he caught a familiar name and did a double take. Holding it close to his face, he squinted, unsure that his eyes weren’t playing tricks on him. But it was there, plain as day in unmoving Muggle ink.
, there’s not exactly a Hippocratic Oa–Oh.” Draco stopped short. A wave of cold fury washed over him as Potter’s intimation caught up. “Oh.” Draco laughed. “She feels it’s unethical, doesn’t she?”
“I didn’t know,” Harry speaks up from behind him, then trails off. “I didn’t know what to do with it.”
“Um,” he mutters, and he tightens it without realising. Merlin help me, it’s got dimples when he does that. “I...yeah?”
“Hardly,” she bit out. “But a bit of notice beyond some perfunctory letter from a secretary we’ve never heard of would’ve been nice before the Ministry started traipsing through. On top of terrifying the ever loving daylights out of Greg, the sudden arrival of a coterie of Aurors doesn’t exactly suggest the maintenance of the status quo.”
“Why aren’t you?” he yelled back. “With that dress surely you could have your pick, if you’re so inclined.”
Without thinking he drops a hand to Harry’s thigh, squeezing, running up to his arse and cupping it, massaging it so his hole will be exposed. Harry whines and bucks into Draco’s face. He hears Harry moan, and whisper, “Fuck, more, Draco, fuck, so good. You’re so, so good.”
Malfoy’s question hung in the air. Harry wasn’t sure how to answer it. There were reasons why he’d come looking for Malfoy originally, and reasons why he was glad he had, but they weren’t the same reasons.
Draco thought Harry flushed, though he couldn’t be sure it wasn’t the glow of the fire. The nervousness in Harry’s voice suggested the former. “There might have been, yes.”
Harry doesn’t look like he quite believes it. Draco does the only thing he—well, he doesn’t know how. He has no idea of how to do this, but it’s the only thing he can think of to try.
The scepticism that flashes over Harry’s features hurts but then, Draco thinks—he hopes—the words sink in.
Harry slips the button free and presses his hips into Draco’s back. The pressure is delicious, but it’s almost beside the point. He wants Draco to feel the effect he has. “You’ve done so much already. Just a little break.”
He looks to me, searchingly, but I want to hear his word for this, and if he says ‘all right,’ on Slytherin’s grave, I’ll fucking slap him.
Do you know, I asked him how much they paid for that tripe and he said he did it for free? Something about minor editorial constraints and donations to those ridiculous causes he mentioned in his column.
Harry Potter, the Ministry’s Golden Boy, brush in hand, defacing public property, and it was bloody glorious.
He chanced a look next to him and almost flinched at the strength of Draco’s gaze. He turned his eyes back to the boardwalk. “I didn’t think about why that possibility bothered me so much I couldn’t risk it. Maybe I wasn’t ready to. It was another few years before…” He shook his head. “Anyway. I’m sorry. For that and for not asking and for not trying harder when I got back. You meant a lot to me. I’m sorry you didn’t know that. That I didn’t tell you.”
We’ll start with brunch, which Harry really is quite expert at, and which he promises will cure everyone’s New Year’s Day woes. I may’ve brewed a batch of hangover potion at the Chalet, just in case his rashers don’t quite live up to that claim.
Draco moans, open-mouthed, can’t help it. Warm, and soft, Harry is so warm and soft, not just his skin, and he wants more, Merlin but it feels good.
“You wouldn’t, would you?” Draco mumbled, rising from the couch and walking part way across the room. “Fine, then. You may be disappointed, though I imagine not surprised, to hear that the wizarding press was of no particular interest.”
Harry picked up the piece of string and wrapped it around his finger, then loosened it again when one of the kittens started to bat at it. “If there’s a way for me not to be dangerous—”
” Harry trailed off into a long hiss as Malfoy suddenly thrust forward, burying himself in Harry entirely and sending sparks shooting up Harry’s spine. “
“Please. You must realise I’m not actually a first year Hufflepuff, and your quasi-euphemisms are hardly sophisticated. Potter here needs it up the arse to translate, fine.”
You do not go out. Not out there. Some men do but it’s the beat for you. That’s why you come here, the heat and the press and the sweat and the noise.
“Ah, but it is my business.” Draco takes his first full breath as he feels the conversation moving to more familiar territory.
“I hear what you’re saying about the coincidences, but it just…it all depends on being secretly angry at the people I love.”
He smacked the file down on the coffee table in frustration. He’d left strict instructions that he was not to be interrupted.
“I didn’t put it there Malfoy, Christ. I told you, there were some around before. It’s probably…bred, or something. Everybody meant to check when this one started rattling, but, you know...” he trails off.
Potter cries out and shudders when Draco runs his tongue up his shaft and then takes Potter in his mouth.
The week still drags, though. By Friday, Draco’s had his robes finished and pressed, had the elves clean the Manor top to bottom just for something to oversee, reassigned half his photographers, started in on a plan for streamlining the business desk, and caught up almost completely on his personal and professional correspondence.
Draco broke away first. He didn’t bother trying to smile. Not when Harry would see through it, or when he wasn’t sure he could manage it. Not when part of him wanted to climb back into bed.
“Right. Yeah. Among others. And I realised both of those options were basically pretty crap. That there was no way to win. And by then it was March, and there was really no good way out of it except busting through the wall, so to speak. Fortunately,” he smiled, “that’s one of those things I’m good at.”
“He lives alone in a house he inherited. Wizarding, but in a Muggle neighbourhood. He spends time with friends from school, the Weasley family, and his godson. He has collegial relationships in the Auror department and enjoys lunches and pub nights with co-workers. He partners most frequently with Seamus, who prefers to stay close to London. But he and Ron like the long-term undercover work best, and they’ll do that as often as they’re able. He likes Quidditch but doesn’t have time to play very often. Hasn’t had a pet since the war. We’ve tried to convince him to get a new owl, but he won’t. Seemed more receptive to a cat or a Crup, but his hours aren’t really conducive to it. He cooks sometimes...” Granger trailed off, looking a bit at a loss for how to continue.
Minutes passed before Malfoy let out a soft call and Edgar circled lower, and then lower still, finally coming to a stop on Malfoy’s outstretched forearm. Malfoy held him so close Harry almost couldn’t hear the reassurances and praise that Malfoy had for the bird, almost couldn’t see the look of approval in his eyes.
“It’s your lucky day, then. Given the uniqueness of the case, I suspect it will have to be a collaborative endeavour.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Would you like me to?” He realised too late how that might’ve been taken and rushed to correct himself. “I thought you wanted more autonomy?”
He moves quietly towards the front of the room. He doesn’t want to surprise Potter, but doesn’t want to disturb him either. It seems a sound course to have chosen when he hears the first strains of Potter’s voice, choked with emotion.
Draco turned his back to Harry. “You take the right, I’ll take the left, and let’s turn as we cast.”
Seeming to notice Harry’s unease, she sat up again and asked what else was on his mind. He shrugged equivocally. She leaned forward and pressed further, and Draco heard her raise her voice again: “I want to know, Harry, really I do, and it doesn’t help anyone for you to keep hiding things when we all only want the best for you.”
“It just doesn’t make sense,” Harry said, feeling more than a little out of place. For one thing, though he’d never want to admit it, it felt a bit odd to be the only person scowling in a room full of revellers. For another, the case file had said “Muggle dress,” not “Muggle dress of the chic, fashionable, posh twat variety,” and feeling underdressed was doing nothing for his mood.
He tried the first thing that came to mind, hoping against hope that it would be better than the laden silence. He sat back in the chair, crossing an ankle over the other knee and dropping his voice to a conversational register. "As Kate said, I have some additional questions."
He folded his hands neatly in front of him and did not chance a look at Potter, who, from the sound of it, had already been brought up to date. “Only that the Ministry has urgent need of interdepartmental cooperation on an important matter, and that my skills and talents in particular would be required.”
“I appreciate that, but I’d rather not. I understand your concern, but the risk is bigger than the benefit. Of course they’re all very capable, but that’s no reason to put them at risk.”
What if— it was always Draco who left, meaning it was up to Draco to return, or not return, or put it out of his mind for years at a time. What if Potter left him back?
He tries being nice to Higsbee, which almost reduces Higsbee to tears, so Draco has him banned from his office for a full 48 hours to compensate.
“It’s that important to you? He or she is still going to know who you are. Might have read the books, all of it.”
“Why?” The weight in his chest began to coil into something sharp and taut. “Because Malfoy won’t be in the same room with me? He’s made you his designated go-between?”
Tomorrow afternoon he’ll stand in front of the wizarding world. He wrote a statement; I rewrote it. He’s spent today away from the office. Spent it here, instead, practising. Waiting.
It raised gooseflesh across the nape of his neck. But he’d thought he might regret saying anything more and he didn’t. It felt good to say it. To know that he’d know, after the fact, that at least he’d said it, whether or not Potter believed him. Maybe that was selfish, too, but Potter had asked. Though maybe that was childish, but still, Potter had asked so many times and Draco, if he was honest with himself, wanted to answer.
Harry falters. Draco’s fingers grip his jaw, turn his head so that he can feel Draco’s hot breath on his ear, can hear the low whisper. “Trust me.”
Potter’s lips turned up in a faint approximation of a polite smile. “I’d prefer to stay inside, thank you.”
“And,” Harry continued, “I… I’d never skipped one before. I guess I thought I’d feel badly about it the whole night. And I did feel badly, I don’t want to make it sound like it was all fun or anything. I’m glad I was in the void. I was so nervous, something probably would’ve happened. But as it went on, it didn’t feel like I thought it would. It was just me, with a book, and a nice chair, and I didn’t want to risk leaving, but I asked Lobsey to bring some tea, and it was all pretty okay, I guess. Cosy.”
“Of course!” Draco exclaimed. “It’s because you care so much. So much you want an excuse to never see them again.”
“You’re very welcome.” They lapsed into silence. “For what it’s worth, I don’t think you’re an empty canvas.”
He sighed and sat up, ruffling his fingers through his hair. He certainly should have been tired enough to sleep. It was late. He’d spent a full shift catching up on paperwork before Malfoy’s event. He’d fallen asleep on harder surfaces—on pavement, on wood pallets, in Muggle tents, maybe even in a pub booth or two. It wasn’t like he’d spent a lifetime growing accustomed to creature comforts. But he hadn’t always felt this electric restlessness then, this totally inability to settle.
The tension shifted, moved out of Potter’s back and into his chest as he pressed into Draco’s touch.
“Never heard of an attic?” Draco catches Potter’s eye and is buoyed by his obvious self-reproach. “You inherit a magical home that’s been in a pureblood family for generations and assume you know all of its secrets because you’ve spent a few months poking around?”
Because he’s Harry Potter, Draco thinks. Because his father would have disowned him or dismembered Potter, or both. Because his mother wanted—wants—to see the line restored. Because the paper would have been accused of favouritism and never could’ve become what it is now. Because there would have been rampant speculation that he had Potter under
“I’m so, so sorry. I told you.” Frustration tinged Potter’s voice. “And you can’t put those back with a spell, they’re just gone, dead, look at that, the tree, what if it killed the tree?”
“He certainly hadn’t slept well or much. He was as agitated as you are. He was very ill at ease—between you and me, if Galder hadn’t been on the edge of a conniption, I suspect he would’ve brought a kitten to the table. And the only thing he did ask, beyond the bare pleasantries, was whether anyone else would be joining us.”
Once convinced, he’d thrown on a t-shirt, his best Muggle jeans and an old leather jacket he’d picked up in le Marais fixed his hair, and been ready to go before the rest of them. Pansy had been last down, in a strapless leather dress that was as scandalous as it was gorgeous, even by Draco’s standards, and Blaise and Millie had Side-Alonged them to the beach.
Malfoy laughed. It was incredulous and a little crazed, and Harry thought he saw the cages give a bit of a rattle. “You—” Malfoy tried. “You—You didn’t. Of course you didn’t.” He laughed again. “Never. Of course. Of course.” He shook his head.
Draco hesitates for a moment. “Certainly.” He moves to sit on one side of the longest settee in the room. He accepts the drink gingerly when Harry hands it to him.
Harry grins and leans in for a kiss. This time, Draco responds – his lips are warm, and pliant, and firm against Harry’s, and his hands come to grip Harry’s shoulders and pull him closer, and it leaves Harry breathless.
From the corner of his eye, Draco saw Harry studying the rug. He didn’t stop once Draco was settled.
It makes Draco’s chest ache. “Right.” It’s more decisive than he expects. But that’s right, too. He is certain, and Harry is right.
Finnigan and Wilkins turned, fencing Harry and Draco in and pressing them together in the centre of the formation.
His attentions were returned and he found himself pressed against the bar, the hard oak top pressing into his back and forcing his pelvis forward. His body met Malfoy’s and he rolled his hips, searching for evidence of returned interest.
“Uh, Malfoy?” He pulled his head up an inch or two, though was still steadfastly focused on his own forearm.
So the Aurors showed up right in the middle of her speech, and she just looked so confused, probably on purpose, then told them they were rude to interrupt a healing energy whatever. Savage and Williamson didn’t like that much and arrested her on the spot, in front of everyone. She tried to throw that Hallows charm to Blaise, yelling some rubbish about keeping it safe and carrying on the circle, but he must be smarter than he lets on sometimes, because he wasn’t having any of it. It just fell on the floor and the powder spilled everywhere. Think it’s safe to say she’s well and truly done for, at least for a while.
The smooth syllables slipped over Harry’s tongue. He could feel Malfoy shudder and lean forward behind him.
“In your professional opinion,” Penelope went on, “do you believe that someone without first-hand knowledge of the crime scenes could have depicted them so accurately?”
"The importance of knowing the motives of one's...." Harry trailed off. He quirked an eyebrow and let himself extend a single finger just far enough to brush it over the fine, smooth wool of Malfoy's trousers.
He tried to strike up a rhythm, but Malfoy beat him to it. Fingers threaded through his hair and Malfoy's hand held him firmly in place as he thrust up into Harry's mouth. His grip was harder now and Harry felt the pull on his scalp, but he didn't mind, not when his fingers were digging into the well-pressed crease on the back of Malfoy's trousers and Malfoy's cock was hitting the back of his throat and he was taking it, all of it, everything Malfoy threw at him. Not when it was one more sensation driving him closer to an edge he hadn't known before his last night with Malfoy, a blissful, empty depth made by the blurring together of the strain at the edge of his mouth and the tightness at the back of his throat and the pinch of Malfoy's fingers on his shoulder and the reverberations of Malfoy's groans, and his own, and the soft roughness of wool against his skin.
Harry steps forward, joining him in the hallways. It’s a tight squeeze, but he’s not objecting, and he kind of wants all those eavesdroppers to hear him. He returns the smile. “Yeah, I do.”
He’s comfortable enough with one now, letting me move inside of him, relaxing around my index finger.
“Apparently.” He laughs again, and out of the corner of my eye I see him rest his arms behind his head. “Can see why you had it in mind.”
“No idea,” Draco answered. “His file doesn’t suggest any history with men. And I didn’t think so after this morning, as I had no reason to think he’d have any sort of reaction to a physical exam, particularly one administered by a man. But after this…”
"This is unexpected. I'm sorry to disappoint, but I took an early lunch and I'm afraid things are quite busy here at the moment."
Draco kept walking slowly, anxiety rising in his chest as they moved past the tack room to the next set of stables. If Draco was right that Potter’s second outburst had been down to the mention of Hippogriffs, this would be telling. They passed the feed room. Draco spoke to stop himself holding his breath.
Of course, he hadn’t come anywhere close to saying all of that. His half-sentences felt woefully inadequate.
The candles flared and Harry almost jumped when a thunderclap rattled the windows. When he looked back, the key had been absorbed into the tap, filling the opening so its edges were flat.
“When you were growing up.” Potter enunciated each word carefully. “You had them when you were growing up.”
When Draco brings his hand to Harry’s cheek, shivers run down Harry’s spine. His fingers still smell like lavender, his breath carries a rich, smoky hint of whisky, and the sweetness and spice feel so much like Draco, like being immersed in him at last.
His hands slipped down to Potter’s waist and he untucked Potter’s shirt, sliding his hands over the warm skin beneath, and Potter rolled his hips to meet Draco’s fingers, and fuck, Draco thought, Potter was starting to get hard. Potter
Steeling himself to forge onwards, Harry takes a rather large gulp of his drink. “Read any good books lately?”
“Okay.” Harry nodded and stood. “Down in the field?” It sounded just as much like a request as a suggestion. “So I don’t accidentally knock it into anything?”
Potter straightened and faced him. He projected amiable, welcoming warmth to a degree Draco still found hard to swallow. “It’s been a long time. I don’t think you’d be here if you wanted me to come to harm or if you weren’t working for the best possible outcome. And even if I didn’t think that, I trust Hermione with my life and she says you’re the best at what you do, the Muggle-magical biology stuff. So, I’m glad you’re willing to work with me, and don’t see any need to rehash the past.”
It’s got Potter on the front cover, of course. Not exactly a surprise, considering they had him in May, him with Granger and Weaselby in June, him and Longbottom in July, and him with Krum and Delacour in September – “War Heroes, back to school!”— as though the other two did anything. Just a follow up to the break they took in August for Krum’s Quidditch World Cup feature.
“More?” Draco asks, half sincerely making an offer, half asking because he sincerely needs to hear it again.
Then he was off, stalking down the boardwalk and leaving Harry stunned in his wake, unable to so much as put together a thought.
Harry got to his feet, trying not to be shaken by the intensity of Draco’s gaze. He bent to retrieve the open golden ring that lay on the stone tiles. “This is yours.”
“I know you can’t help me move anything. Regulations and all. Would you mind if I moved it up to the front office, though? Figured I could move things up here, then to the lifts, then the atrium, then through the Floo a little at a time. But then I have to move it all in here first. But then, you know. It’ll be gone. Can let you get back to it.”
In practise, though, sitting down to breakfast at a table that has never been graced with the Dark Twat’s presence, in a sunny room, in chairs that are far too comfortable to ever be repurposed for actual or social torture, is entirely necessary. It’s peaceful. Quiet. Pleasant. Usually.
The silence between them moved from laden to explosive. When he spoke, Malfoy's voice was hoarse. "What?"
He pressed his shoulder blades into the grass, tilted his head back, tried to breathe deeply, and tried to focus on the smell of orange blossoms instead of thinking about Potter.
“Oh.” Harry said. He felt himself match Malfoy’s frown, but the words he wanted were still only half-formed, swirling around in the back of his head. “I guess we should go, then.”
Part of him felt as though he should investigate that urge. Make sure it wasn’t the desire to prove Malfoy wrong, to prove that he didn’t just deal in black and white. But Malfoy hadn’t been entirely wrong about that, Harry was a bit chagrined to admit. And it had taken Malfoy to show him why it mattered.
“Almost definitely,” Draco agreed. “Either way, I remember it well. But I bet anyone would be a better dancer when not under that much scrutiny. Or after exiting adolescence.”
“Oh?” Harry leaned forward, resting his elbow on the edge of the table and his face on his palm. “So then…?”
As requests go, this one is easy. I drive into him and he gasps, arches his back, screws his eyes shut and moans. One hand fists the sheets, the other drops from my shoulder to my arse.
“Ah, of course. The great Harry Potter is a selfish lover.” Potter’s eyes bug out at the word. “I should’ve known.”
I had to keep my eyes on him through it all. He seemed to glow even in the fading sunlight, the pinks glancing off what was left of his tan and making him seem to burn with it. His mouth was open, his jaw working as he gasped for air. His eyes had been screwed shut, and I almost stopped at the force of his gaze when he opened them.
They try again, and again, and again. Proudfoot tries firing hexes, jumping out of Harry’s way, meeting him with a punch to the stomach. Short-distance Apparition is the only thing that gives her much of an advantage. Harry thinks it would be tricky to integrate spellcasting in to his use of the cloak if he weren’t working so entirely from instinct. As it is, he finishes the trials breathless, exhilarated, and a rousing success.
Harry couldn’t think of anything to say. Couldn’t be sure anything other than half-digested coq au vin would come out of his mouth if he were to open it.
Draco’s attempt at a dark smile becomes wholly sincere when he sees the trail of precome and spit linking Harry’s bottom lip to his cock. “Fuck my face.”
, which could only be surprising to someone who intentionally shuts himself off from all wizarding press. And I was even more surprised that he defended the thing. Really, having survived the Dark Lord, he may yet choke to death on his own earnestness. No one is that sincere all the time. I’m beginning to think he’s just an exceptional actor, though he lacks the brains for it.
She retrieved her saucer and looked down into her tea. “Ten years alone with them is rather a strong incentive.”
“Yes. At two. Robards wants to send an Auror guard to meet me here, if that’s all right. I was going to ask you about that anyway. They’d come at half one, so there’s time to get through the Ministry building to the courtroom.”
There’s a lot of clock ticking, too, and he’s pretty well resolved to get a new watch and a new wall clock by the time noon rolls around.
I kind of want to write about what it was like when you woke up, but I think you’d just think it was mushy sap and laugh at me. And you were there. Hopefully it won’t be too soppy to tell you that I hope what I was feeling showed, cause it was…after all that waiting and hoping, to see you actually wake up and hear you say my name, and you looked so disbelieving, like it was in a dream. And then asked me if it was a dream, and your face when I said no, that I was there, and when I got to tell you I love you, and you said it back, and I think you almost cried. Okay, definitely getting into overly too soppy territory.
Draco was frozen in the doorway, not entirely able to process the scene. Then some very helpful part of his brain whispered,
Harry arches and cries out when Draco thrusts into him and rolls his hips just so, and then Harry’s gone too, descended into a stream of filth that Draco only half hears. But he knows enough to know what it means. Knows enough to do it, to match every demand for “harder” and “faster.”
“I’m not sure.” Draco answered honestly, if reluctantly. “A medley? Nothing? It shouldn’t be anything harmful, though. If it is, I’ll intervene.”
Just like that, the urge to scream returned. His jaw tightened. “We’ve walked through all the options.”
“Please. Even setting aside the relentlessly homoerotic mutual stalking of our school days, it’s obvious.” She scoffed at Granger’s pointed blankness and continued. “I tried to engage him in a discussion of gay erotica and he froze my bedroom. No one truly secure in their sexuality reacts like that.”
" Malfoy's ears pinked and Harry could barely stop himself laughing in relief. He wasn't the only one with predictable tells. "Stupid as you might want to think me, I do have eyes."
He opens for Draco without question or reservation. This rivals Legilimency for its intimacy. Draco’s tongue is a kind of magic he’s never encountered before, and there’s nothing to do but rock into it, welcome it, until he’s so far past the edge of coherence that his attempts at language wouldn’t even qualify as begging.
“Hmm. Asked if you were sorry, actually, but I like your question better. Regret. Do you regret leaving?”
Potter paused with his mouth open. His chest still heaved. He shook his head. “You think you’re so clever.”
It’s like they’ve got an emotional tracking spell on him, Pansy and Blaise. He half wonders if they do. He certainly wouldn’t put it past them. He’s also not certain he would object, if that’s what makes them turn up for breakfast the next morning. If anything, he would be grateful, and the feeling sits uneasily. Unlike intimidation and machination, gratitude is a bit of a foreign affair.
Draco turns to him, looking suddenly grave, and Harry feels the tug as Draco pulls him close. They’ve been closer than this before, but this feels far more intimate. A lick of anxiety curls Harry’s stomach again. He’s not sure what to do with this, without direction, without anything other than the bare fact of their attraction.
I still don’t know if Potter likes elf-brewed tea or down duvets. I do know that he likes to surprise me. Or else he’s as naturally talented at that as…well. He surprised me for the second time in as many days. He didn’t turn me in.
Experimentally, he leaned in and tried it. Malfoy's hips jerked forward. Harry's cock strained against his pants; he hadn't realised how hard he was until he felt the bulge of Malfoy's erection brush his lips. He slid his lips over the outline of it and felt Malfoy's hand fall to his shoulder, digging in so hard that Harry could feel each fingertip, even through the leather of his jacket.
Potter, wearing the same Aran jumper and beige-brown trousers he’d worn at their first meeting, was in the seat he’d taken when they’d spoken the day before. It put distance between them, gave Draco somewhere to sit that was at a professional remove, which, in spite of his gratitude, left him with a sense of foreboding, and a bit of frustration. Potter was dreading this too. Potter wanted to put distance between them. Potter was going to continue to pretend that he was totally nonplussed by everything. Though this time, Draco couldn’t blame him. Not when he felt oddly weak in the knees about the whole thing, to the point of envying Potter his seat.
“Ah. Right.” Draco gripped the base of his cock and pulled it free of Harry, who rocked backwards and tried to follow. Draco smacked his arse. “Duty, Potter.”
“So it got to the point where I probably could have been cleared to go back. Not necessarily because I was ready, but because they had reasons for wanting to clear me. And the thing is.” He paused. “I don’t really like this bit.” He folded and unfolded his napkin in his lap, and Draco watched him, and already he wanted to reach across the table and take his hands, pull him close and congratulate him. Throw him a bloody parade or something.
He turned over and pressed up to kneel beneath Potter, and reached back, threading his fingers through the nest of Potter’s hair to pull him into a kiss, humming his assent into the end of it.
“You feel ready.” Draco keeps stroking, slow and careful, and Harry can’t help but buck into his fist.
“Most of the universities. Les Jardins du Luxembourg.” He hesitated. “My flat. And we can always make a loop, come back here, or walk the Quai de Conti back towards the Meurice.”
He opens his mouth to speak. Draco knows what he’s going to say, can see it on his face – and when did he learn that face so well? – but he can’t hear it. He doesn’t have an answer for that question.
Draco set his spoon to rest once everyone was done and the bowls disappeared, to be replaced with a salad. Draco cleared his throat and turned to Blaise. “When will you be in Paris next? It would be nice to see more of you.”
Potter’s eyebrows climbed still higher. Draco couldn’t be certain if it was scepticism or intrigue, but he could feel the taut tension in the air between them. It certainly wasn’t a no. Perhaps with a bit of convincing…
“Lovely.” Draco and turns on his side to look down at Harry. Rests a hand on his chest before he continues. “This month has had a lot of reasons to be fine and not much more. I’ll give you that much. But it’s not—it’s March. Doldrums for everyone. Half the Ministry’s sopping wet half the time.”
With a crack, one of the Manor’s giant black roof tiles broke free, sliding over the eaves and crashing to the ground. It splintered into dozens of pieces, a few falling inches from their feet.
There it is again. Potter’s staring. Not quite staring, though. It’s got sort of a tender edge to it and the corners of his mouth are turning up. Draco turns away. “There are some similar artefacts, however, that do technically belong to your estate, some of which may have been in the attic.”
“More or less?” Draco turned to level Granger with a glare before bringing his attention back to Potter. “So there were magical outbursts before the surgery as well?”
He whined when I pulled away, but was absolutely silent when I sat back and grasped the button on his jeans. I withdrew my hands, but he hadn’t meant his silence as a reproach. He reached down and undid them himself. His eyes were trained on me, and I was torn between holding his eyes and watching the hollow between his hipbones come into view.
Harry ran a thumb along the petals of the day lily. He dropped the same thumb to the nexus of the bud and the stem, looking on the verge of snapping it off. He stopped himself at the last minute, lips pressed together, and withdrew his hand. He looked at Draco. “Would you…” He waved his wand feebly.
Blaise wouldn’t tell Slughorn, he’s too busy kissing arse to admit to his lascivious ways. Blaise and I may share an appreciation of the conquest as well as the occasional dalliance, but he doesn’t tell anyone else, save his mother, much of anything.
Potter’s eyes are green again. They’re always green, but not this bright, watery emerald that Draco’s discovering. It’s worse because his cheeks are pale, because his lips are swollen, because everything about him looks open and scared. Vulnerable. Exactly how Draco never wants to look again.
I met with the Aurors again yesterday and – you might want to kill me, though I hope you don’t – let them see some of this journal. It was the best record there was of how she’d been behaving towards you the whole time and why she’d actually want to cast a Sectumsempra. I let them see my memories of it, too, if it makes you feel any better. Between your records and my memory of the event, they could tell that she’d done it on purpose. Also, the ground unicorn horn is a violation of a whole bunch of statutes from the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, and Misuse of Magic and Intoxicating Substances.
The intensity of it hit Draco square in the chest. He swallowed against a thundering lump in his chest. He tried to sound even. Calm. “It does.”
The intercom on his desk buzzed and saved him from his thoughts. Or might've, had it not been Kate to tell him Potter had arrived.
Harry watched him carefully. He looked as though he was on the verge of apologising. Draco raised an eyebrow at him, mock-sternly.
Potter seems wholly unconcerned with that detail, though. He nods furiously, twisting his fingers against my scalp.
“Thank you. Dr Malfoy, are there any special precautions you would advise beyond the use of an armed guard?”
It feels really bloody good, of course it does. His cock’s rock fucking hard and Harry’s mouth keeps inching lower. He’s got to be leaking into Harry’s mouth, and that’s why Harry pulls off like that to swirl his tongue over the tip, perfect, perfect, and he can feel his bollocks tightening and—
“You were given the material to blackmail Harry Potter and you took that opportunity to get a date?”
It’s just that Draco isn’t kissing him back. The lips Harry meets are unmoving and slack, and when Draco moves it’s not to pull him closer, but to push him away.
“Right.” Draco turned towards him. “You won’t do it.” Draco cursed his luck; of course Potter would stand up for himself now, of all times, when Draco was so close to finding something that might work.
Draco’s heart plummets. He grips the magnifier, doesn’t move, certain that he can’t afford to have a reaction. Couldn’t even if his underling wasn’t just across the desk.
Harry jerked his hips, urging Draco in deeper, trying to set a pace of his own. Draco was glad to match him.
Malfoy’s belt buckle clattered against the box when he stepped forward. He bumped into the desk as he leaned over to grab Harry’s t-shirt, twisting it in his hand and pulling Harry forward until Harry could feel the heat of his breath.
“I am the best.” Draco raised an eyebrow. “And I might have got a bit further with a complete report up front. As it stands, critical information was omitted from the set of reports I received before leaving Paris.” He took a sip. “Those oversights effectively misled me as to the nature of Potter’s implant and the goals of this rather experimental treatment plan. I have had to start from scratch.”
“Do I regret leaving?” His heart is pounding now. He should’ve known, should’ve expected, but he doesn’t have an answer for this question. Not one that he can give out loud.
It takes Harry a moment to respond. Seems to take him a moment to even comprehend the words entirely. Then he nods and scrambles to turn over.
“I said shut up, Potter,” Draco mumbled, half asleep, before closing his eyes entirely and passing out on Harry’s chest.
“What if I wanted to work with someone from scratch? Without them having all this stuff about my personal life and medical history?”
Just like that, Potter sagged, dropping his arm and the leaf along with it. He held out his wand to Draco. “Thank you.”
He tensed when I pressed against his hole. Almost inevitable, with such a novice. He took a deep breath and tried to relax. A hand in his helped. He squeezed it and I tried again, but had barely pushed a fingertip into him when he clenched again and tried to push me out. He apologised and asked, more anxiously still, “Would you…with your mouth, while you?”
Draco resisted the urge to rush to Harry’s side. It was made easier by his own surprise at that instinct, and easier still by having very little idea as to what he would say once he got there. And easiest of all when the press, taking advantage of a distracted Wizengamot, rushed the floor. Draco’s stomach sank, and he grabbed Granger’s arm to get her attention.
