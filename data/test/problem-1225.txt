And not just in a friends way. He loved him as in, he wanted to kiss him and hold him. The realization hit him hard and he spent the following weeks accepting the fact that he was gay.
“You can’t be Draco. Draco Malfoy is in this cell with me. See? He’s all alone, just like me. You don’t leave people you care for. You don’t leave people you love.”
He stared across the room to where Draco was sitting next to Pansy. He had been avoiding eye contact until this moment. He had avoiding all glances in his direction. Looking at him, and knowing he couldn’t have him, made him sad.
Draco raised his brow in confusion. “What do you mean, Potter?” A server came around replacing Dracos and Harrys now empty glasses.
Harry took a long drink from his cup, looking as if he needed the alcohol to have this conversation. Draco had only taken a sip out of his by now, and he was realizing that Harry might be trying to get drunk.
Around noon, Uncle Remus had Harry follow him to start getting ready while Uncle Sirius moved with Draco and Blaise in a different room. Harry and Uncle Remus moved into a dressing room by the event room. It was small with several mirrors and a simple wardrobe in which Harry’s marriage suit hung. “I know that this might not be the best place to talk about it Harry,” Uncle Remus said as Harry opened his wardrobe, “but there is something that I need to tell you about Sirius… something that I am positive that he’ll be too proud to tell you until it’s rather more obvious.”
“You must be joking,” Draco sighed. He strolled towards Harry as the rest of Harry’s team landed one by one. Except for Ron, who dismounted from his broom over by the goalposts and was making his way slowly back to the changing rooms alone. “Turn around,” he ordered, ignoring the looks from the Gryffindors.
He chewed on his lip, staring at the potion. Fidgeting with his fingers, he shook his head, “No, no I can’t do it,” he said to himself. “I can’t! I—I won’t… I can’t,” he looked at the potion. “It’s not fair,” he insisted. “They… they might deserve it but still…” His mind at a lost, he grabbed the potion and placed it out of eyesight of his bed before getting into it.
“Because I’m an omega and he’s an Alpha? Well we’re still learning,” Harry said truthfully. “I change with the full moon, but I am still in control of myself, I’m not like a regular werewolf. And Draco, he doesn’t shift really, but some attributes changes,” a dusting of blush started to affect his cheeks.
and felt the searing pain on the back of his hand for a second time; once again the words had been cut into his skin, once again they healed over later.
Malfoy followed him and yelled in a deep voice that made the omega stop instantly, “Stop right now!” He used his Alpha voice. Harry was pissed off—no one has dared to even use their Alpha voice against him, not even Krum or Niall!
His eyes went wide, realizing what he did, and quickly tried to retreat to Blaise only for Loki to stop him, “Now, now, no need to be so snippy… I’m not a girl too, I just love having woman’s parts, don’t tell me you never imagined having them, boy?” His hand began to move towards Harry, but Blaise stopped him.
“I am—well maybe, just close your eyes, okay Harry?” Draco stuttered. Harry frowned, confused, but did as he was told. He heard Draco shuffling, the floor squeaking under him. “Draco?” he questioned.
The house looked massive to Voldemort, as he looked at it. A massive ramshackle tower of rooms that seemed to be added onto one another with no thought or reason, looking as though it is only staying upright and together with magic. Voldemort moved towards the home, feeling the shields and protections around the property. He couldn’t help but chuckle as he moved through it easily, none of the barriers barring animals. He slithered towards the front door, which was naturally locked, but it did not matter to him.
“How are you feeling Harry?” Lupin asked, “I know that this is a lot to accept… I’m so sorry.” He stood up and wrapped his arms around Harry. Harry sat still, his face looking bewildered as for the first time he thought about his future life.
Harry and Draco kept to themselves during rehearsal, their bodies always pressed together as Harry tried to forget about his outfit for the holiday and the things Mr. Riddle told him. By the end of the two hours, he and Draco were sweaty and exhausted.
Ginny grimaced at Harry and Draco from behind Slughorn’s back. “Well now this is most pleasant, a chance to know you all a little better. Here, take a napkin. I’ve packed my own lunch; the trolley, as I remember it, is heavy on sugar, and a poor old man’s digestive system isn’t quite up to such things. ...Pheasant, Belby?”
“Well I’m not surprised considering the past four Defense teachers,” the other boy said. “But we can talk about that later, Draco,” He turned to Harry and smiled, “Hello, my name is Blaise Zabini, and this is my sweet Omega, Theo Nott,” he pulled the boy on his other side on his lap, he was a cute boy with short black hair and blushing cheeks.
“Indeed,” Voldemort said. He looked from Harry to the seating chart. “It must be exhilarating, thinking of the plunge, knowing that once you’ve taken that step you can never go back. I’ve killed when I was your age Harry. I know what it feels like, the power, the control… the chaos. You want to kill all my followers Harry? I cannot help but wonder, how will you handle the circumstances?” He chuckled coldly as Harry just stared at the names. He took a deep breath, pushing down any fears he may still have, and looked at his father.
Drool and precum dripped from Harry’s mouth, and Draco pulled out roughly, grabbing the base of his cock and slapped Harry’s cheeks. “Open wide,” he ordered. Harry did and Draco aimed his cock into Harry’s mouth. A stream of piss gushed out and started to fill Harry. It was hot and salty, and Harry felt perverted in how much he loved it. He did his best to swallow, but the piss was too much and it drained out of Harry’s mouth, down his face and chin dripping onto his body and collar. Draco groaned, moving his cock so that he was pissing directly on Harry’s hard cock, grinning at the sight. “Now we know whose dick that is,” he growled out. Harry swallowed the remaining hiss in his mouth and burped. “Master’s,” he said.
“Fuck,” Harry muttered and glanced at Nagini who was still sleeping. He was still hard, very hard, and moved as quietly as he could to the bathroom where he took care of himself, reaching the climax that the dream denied him. He licked himself clean, liking the taste, and moved to the sink to wash up. “Day three,” He told himself as he stared in the mirror. “It’s all over.” He stared at he mirror and forced himself to push down his emotions until he smiled like the perfect son of Lord Voldemort. He showered, dressed in his school robes once more, and laughed at Nagini. “You are a lazy snake,” he smiled, moving to the bed. He sat down as his hand moved to his pocket. “Come on Nagini,” he said, patting his lap with his free hand.
“Underneath your Alpha,” Draco answered. Harry sneered at the answer and turned his attention back to the dishes.
Dark Lord. Because of him, I’ve fell to the Dark Arts. I’ve learned the spells, the curses, and most of all your society and culture. And it is with this learning that I can say the following proudly: I despise each and every one of you. I long for the day where I can watch you all die, choking by your backwards beliefs and idiotically toxic ideology.” Harry paused. There was a loud outrage. He smirked at them all, his eyes meeting each pair of angry eyes glared back at them. Calmly he pointed his wand at his throat, repeating the spell he watched Dumbledore use to amplify his voice. “Yes! The pureblooded ideology! Your pitiful belief that having no muggle blood in you makes you superior. That is the most heinous and pitiful thing about your culture. You actually believe that you are superior than half bloods, then muggleborns—because you all would rather keep the blood pure in faux-incestuous marriages instead of reaching out. Look at the Goyles, the Crabbes and the Parkinsons! Look at their spawn and see the ruin that is your own creation!
“It’s fine,” Draco said, still sounding stony. “Just show me the gym. Or better yet a track, I feel like running.”
Harry nodded and went to the same seat he collapsed in an hour earlier, which now had a bundle of robes folded onto it. He took it and placed it on his lap. “And you—get out you idiot!” Voldemort spat at the house elf who whimpered and scurried away.
Harry jumped, water splashing out of the tub. He turned slowly to stare in horror at his godfather. “Harry… what happened?”
Harry was thankful that the Slytherin, according to Draco, knew to keep their mouths shut at least. He actually enjoyed being with Draco’s friends when they were together. During the first week there were many times where Draco just left Harry in the hands of his friends, like a rushed Dad leaving his child in daycare, before running off to the library for a book he forgot, or to ask one of his professors a question. It seemed much more fun and talkative, at least, compared to when he and Draco slept in Gryffindor Tower where Draco still received a lot of glared and untrusting looks from the other Gryffindors, but Harry’s dormmates tried their best to act welcoming.
Harry frowned, he started to feel tense as the whispers around him started. “How did they know about the prophecy?” He asked. He looked at Ron and Hermione, “That’s the prophecy, word for word.”
, Hedwig flew towards them with a letter. She dropped it and stole a bit of bacon from Harry’s plate before flying off. “Who’s it from?” Niall asked curiously.
Harry laughed. It was loud and light, jiggling the deepest of his core. He smiled brightly as Neville blushed and sort of shrank into himself. “It’s okay Neville,” Harry said, “you don’t need to explain yourself. I get that.”
“I believe that is a matter that you boys should not worry about,” A voice said behind them. The three turned to see Mr. Riddle standing in front of them. “In times such as these, Mr. Potter and Malfoy, it is best to keep your heads down, for who knows what sort of vile plans demons are coming up with.” His eyes shifted towards Blaise for a moment.
he chastised himself. It was stupid, being so over-reactive towards a party! He just got to Hogwarts, nobody knows him here, only Daphne Greengrass and Draco didn’t even know where to begin to look for her! This party might be a good idea, if not to somehow make a friend miraculously, then to just find out more about Hogwarts and who to avoid. Besides, he was going to live with Ron for the rest of the school year so he might as well try to get to know the guy. He looked nice enough, even if he did smell a bit like a weed garden, and Draco did not want to make a bad second impression after horribly messing up the first by falling asleep on his bed without even unpacking.
The needles returned. They moved on their own, stabbing and digging flesh off of Vernon’s body as Voldemort aimed his wand at the overweight man.
The twins found an empty room and took it for themselves. The two enjoyed a peaceful sail, and even heard that they were underwater! The journey took all day, and Harry was happy that they packed food for it as he and Niall leaned against each other and ate pre-made sandwiches and snacks. At one point, Harry brought out his giant dragon plushie and Niall snickered. “You actually brought that?”
“Along with those courses Harry, you will be expected to take ritual theory, destruction arts, as well as History,” Mr. Riddle said. “Here”—he snapped his fingers and a piece of paper appeared in front of Harry—” is your schedule for the semester. Please note that for your first year here, the general studies will be the same. You are allowed only one elective from which you can choose from the list here,” he indicated at the bottom. Harry looked at the list and read it to himself silently.
“Harry, I hope that you don’t hit me for this.” He leaned into Harry, took the boys face into his arms and pulled the boy into a kiss. It wasn’t nearly the kiss he would have wanted for a first kiss, but saving Harry for a demon monster was worth it.
Harry nodded. “Draco, I love you.” He pecked Draco on the lips again, leading to a deeper kiss than the first.
Tears streamed down his face as he kissed Draco for the last time in the safety on the Grimmauld Place, before they both apparated to the building they were supposed to go to, to drop Draco off. The building was made up of windows, overlooking the lake and off in the distance, the triangular building that was Azkaban.
Though, when he finally did make contact with him, he was wearing a white set of white robes that matched his skin complexion beautifully. His hair was gelled back in place, a small strand of his hair dangling down over his forehead. He looked absolutely breathtaking.
“I wouldn’t say that. I might understand more than you know.” Which was true. If anyone understand awful family, it was Harry.
Since Voldemort has made his return, both Draco and Harry had to begin limiting the time they saw each other. First, it was every other day. Then, it was three days a week. Then, it was every Saturday. And Harry absolutely hated it.
“Malfoy, I don’t care that you were a death eater. In the end, you didn’t tell Bellatrix that it was me and you practically gave me those wands. And then you called my name and distracted Voldemort enough for me get away. You’ve proven yourself enough for my forgiveness.”
He always imagined the ending of the war being one of happiness and relief. But instead, all he was filled with anger and grief.
Draco noticed Harry wasn’t kissing back and he opened his eyes, moving back, looking completely embarrassed. He stared at Harry, who was staring right back in shock, both of them staying like this for a long moment.
Harry made a soft noise against their lips as Draco began returning the kiss. The noise drove right through Draco like tone of weight. He went right down to his pelvic region and he knew he was done for. All rational thinking was down the drain. He needed this boy kissing him back. He needed those rough, chapped lips on his. And he needed to stay this way for as long as possible.
“It’s hard to be down there isn’t? Hard to look at all of what happened and not... not feel...” He looked like he was lost for words, so Harry nodded, already understanding what was being said.
It was as if he could never get away from the boy. He had every class with him, so all day he was forced to be in the same room, and in most of them, he had the unfortunate fate of being Harry’s partner. His world had quickly become one filled with lots of green eyes looking at him and lazy fingers running frantically through his hair as he did his work.
“Would you look at that? Malfoy decided to actually come back.” Harry looked up almost immediately and his heart dropped at the sight.
It was going to be used to make sure the other way alive, because of that day, neither knew if they would see each other again.
That seemed to break Harry out of his trance. Harry looked at the real Draco and then back at the boy in the corner and back again.
“Wait, so muggles have cameras that capture an entire scene that tells some story and they all watch it like this? Just to laugh or cry?” He said in amusement while the end credits were on the screen. Harry laughed at the reaction of Draco.
Draco didn’t need to be told twice. He moved his lips from Harrys, kissing his jaw and his cheek, making his way down to the boys neck. Harry immediately moved his head back to give Draco more room to work with. Draco nibbled and sucked on the soft skin on harrys neck, basking in the sweet noises that left the boys mouth as he did so. Those noises drove Draco mad. He needed to hear Harry make more of those noises.
And the worst part is that the one who gets stuck inside, forgets the outside world. Their reality becomes that of their nightmares.
“I started dreaming about what it would be like if I had a chance with you... I didn’t think it could be possible. But I had to try. And that leads us here, to this muggle bar that is overly crowded and us being drunk... because I wanted this chance to say something... this chance to maybe make it happen, without being a coward and running away from it.”
“Mom.” The girl said loudly and every head in the room turned to look at the girl and the two boys. The teacher at the front of the room was the one that Harry was looking at though.
"If I run off, they will kill my family. I need to protect my family. I can help you escape. But I need to stay here and I need you to go to the Dungeons with that Luna chick, her father and the goblin man. I'm not letting you lose. I've been hoping for you to win for sometime now." Harry understood this and without another word, nodded his head, continuing to walk the way to the Dungeons.
Well, that is except one person. If it wasn't one of the many things about the man that seemed to continue to keep him around, time and time again. The man was Draco Malfoy.
“I’m... I’m gonna go now.” He said frantically and left the room in a rush. Harry stood there, confused at what just happened, his head still warm from where Draco’s lips had been.
Draco was beginning to hate the secret part of their relationship, because he wanted sad bad to be there for Harry. Harry meant more to him that he could put into words and seeing his friend like this was hurting him.
The two of them had finally made it to the Floo, Harry grabbing his hand, the first contact he had with the man since he had been taken for the trials, and they both made their way to their destination.
In the front of the room stood the one and only Hermione Granger. And she looked like she was 20 years older than she had been before they had been hit by the spell.
Time passed by Draco after that and the melody that ran in his head was the only thing that kept him strong through every single awful thing that was happening around him. The dark lord had moved into the Malfoy Manor and made it his home base. The walls became tainted with the dark magic that filled it. Days and nights passed but he didn't know which one was worse.
Harry gasped in pain at the intrusion and Dracos breath came out heavy and ragged as he tried to keep himself together as he pushed further in slowly. He didn’t stop until he was seated all the way into Harry, stopping there as he gave Harry time to adjust to him.
“I just lost my virginity to Draco Malfoy. How do you think it was?” He said with a laugh. He could tell Draco was annoyed with his little eye roll but the just smiled. “Of course, Draco. It was bloody fucking amazing... it was everything I had imagined it to be in my head.” This made Draco smile.
“Bloody hell... your Harry Potter!” She said with an disbelief. The girl ran forward and grabbed hold of Harrys arm. She looked over Malfoy, realizing who he was and grabbing his arm as well. “We need to find my mother!” She said and began dragging them through the corridors, up staircases, in a school that was completely rebuilt as if nothing happened.
They ended up at a bar in the middle of muggle London, one that was busy, it being a Friday night and all.
The news surprised everyone, but everyone was happy. Even when they found out whose it was. Harry had explained to everyone that Harry and Draco never hated each other. That they had been together for a while now.
He continues to trust until he felt the walls of Harry’s arse tighten around his cock, and he looked down to see Harry exploding white ropes of come all over there stomach. It was the hottest thing he had ever scene. It didn’t compare though to the sight of Harry’s face as he screamed Dracos name, his whole body tense under Dracos as he orgasmed.
“You know, I get that you hate yourself for being the cause of so many people dying to protect you, but please, could you get over yourself? Seriously, Potter. What would your parents say if they saw that you wasted your life after they had died to keep you alive? What would that cousin of mine and that werewolf Professor say if they saw that you decided that life wasn’t what you wanted and you decided just to chuck yourself off the astronomy tower?”
“I can try.” He said quietly, looking like he was contemplating something important. And when he made his decision he looked nervous. “I want to try something. Do you trust me?” Harry stared for a moment before nodding. “Okay. Close your eyes.”
Draco was dumbfounded. Harry had entered this class because of Draco. He actually wanted to be closer to Draco.
There was so much anger and emotion in Dracos voice, that Harry hadn’t actually noticed that Draco was on the brink of tears. He couldn’t see that Dracos eyes held tears in them, threatening the burst out.
This was the moment he had waited for his entire life. It was supposed to be magical. He was supposed to run into his soulmates arms and life would make sense because they had each other.
“So I went home that night, and I didn’t even get completely drunk. No, my mind was replaying the images of watching these men eat each other’s faces off. I didn’t dare go back the next night. I stayed inside for an entire week, until I couldn’t stand it any more and I had to go back. Something about it made me want to go back. And so I did. I never did anything with a bloke. But I can tell you that after the second night, I went home and fantasized about this man who I had seen there. And I got off from it. Not only once... multiple times.
They still had their hands firmly grasping  the others, and they both were still processing the reality of what had just happened.
He was always left completely confused about not only Draco’s actions, but also the emotions that Harry felt inside.
Harry got frustrated though and spelled both of their clothes away. “Sorry, I was irritated... need you so bad...” he said, rubbing his now exposed cock against Dracos now exposed cock. Draco groaned into Harry’s mouth.
Harry realized it not long after Draco did. Draco, being the smart wizard he was, told Harry that he should see if it would open under water. It sounded a lot like what a merperson would sound like above water.
“I want you to have a reason to want to live Harry. You deserve to live. And I know the reason you can’t trust Granger or Weasley, Granger would just probably psychoanalyze you and Weasley wouldn’t understand, but both wouldn’t understand enough to help you. They wouldn’t be the people you would go to to talk about your issues. I’ve watched you three long enough to see how that works. You usually deal with your issues alone. So, If you would like, if it would help, I would like to be there to help you. I will do anything to keep you alive. If means you cry on my shoulder, I’m okay with that. Whatever it means, I will do it. I owe it to you.”
Draco worked steadily. It was tedious work, but it was easy to focus when there were other things he'd rather avoid thinking about.
Harry blinked. Hell - in all the mess of last night, he'd completely forgotten. "Erm, sorry about that," he said. He tried to smile, but his face hurt.
"Oh yeah." Harry felt like an idiot. He watched Draco trace a finger in figure eights on the arm of the sofa, and a sharp pang of sadness reverberated in Harry's chest. He felt sorry for Draco. He wanted to reach out and wrap his arms around him. The silence was almost unbearable. He clutched his hands together tighter to keep from doing something stupid.
"Sure. Harry." Draco flushed slightly, and Harry felt his heart race. There was something so enticing about Draco blushing. His mind began cataloging a list of new places they could have sex, and Harry grabbed Draco's hand to lead him down that happy path.
"Yes." All Aurors were required to keep an emergency bag packed with clothes and other essentials in the event of an urgent case. Draco had never needed his, and it sat locked in a cupboard under his desk, gathering dust. "Are we going to one of the safe houses then?"
The rain continued for the next three days, but it suited Draco's mood. The turmoil outside mirrored how he felt inside. His mind was in shambles. Everything in his life revolved around Potter, and all of it was a disaster.
?" Draco scoffed. "I'm the one trying to maintain civility! Perhaps you don't understand since you grew up with Muggles, but it's not easy for me here. Half the time I try to use one of these Muggle appliances, some kind of disaster happens, like an explosion, or a flood—"
"But you can't dance," Draco said through gritted teeth. It was a weak excuse, but it was the only thing that came to mind.
Mrs. Wilder was first through the door, always showing up mere minutes after opening. She brought fresh pastries and sat down to have the second cup of coffee in the shop.
"I told you," Draco said. "I knew you'd lose it. That's why I've got it." He patted his left trouser pocket.
"You could have Splinched yourself," Harry said. He sounded angry, but he knelt beside Draco and touched his aching arm tenderly. "Can you move your arm? Rotate it?"
Trembling hands worked their way into his hair, and Harry looked up to see Draco's panting, flushed face. The moonlight coming in from the window cast an otherworldly glow upon him. Harry's heart felt full to bursting, and in that moment, everything slid into place as realisation struck. It was all so simple.
"God, I want to fuck you so badly," Harry said, groaning. "Please tell me you didn't pack the lube."
He cast a spell to smooth out the wrinkles in his trousers and put on his red jumper again. He even made sure to wear matching socks.
Draco nodded at them. He remembered Mary from the ceilidh, but she didn't recognise him. Jeremy remembered him since Draco had answered the door half-naked when they met.
A tapping noise from the living room dragged Harry from his thoughts. Who even knew he was here? Hermione or Ron wouldn't have bothered to knock, so it couldn't have been them.
After Robards handed over a thin stack of letters, Draco made a cup of coffee and went back to his desk.
Draco shrugged. "I doubt he's going to get reprimanded for any of it. If it had been me, Robards would have sacked me." He waved a piece of fish at Potter. "I still don't understand how you could work with him."
While he sat, regaining his composure, someone began rapping at the front door outside. Draco hastily locked drawers, threw glass jars into a box, and exited the store room, making sure to lock it behind him. A glance at the clock revealed it was now opening time, so that was probably Mrs. Wilder out front, anxious for her coffee. He would have to make some adjustments to his morning routine.
Draco shivered. "I'm not sure." He really couldn't say, not with Harry's breath tickling his ear and his hands sliding down to his hips to undo his trousers.
Draco ignored him and went to the bedroom, where he found his jacket and fished through the pocket until he found the Chocolate Frog he stole from Pierce's desk.
Whatever reservations Draco had been grappling with, he seemed to have abandoned them then. Harry closed his eyes and let himself feel. A tongue ran along his bottom lip, coaxing his mouth open with a groan. He did his best to respond in kind, curious and desperate to familiarise himself with the way Draco tasted. It was all so much better than he had imagined, and he wrapped his arms around Draco to hold him closer, lightly massaging his neck with one hand. He'd hardly dared hope that things would actually turn out like
Harry wished the numbness would return. Experiencing an entire spectrum of feelings all at once hurt too much. One second, his spirits were lifted to great heights at the joy from knowing Draco cared for him, at the prospect of getting to be with him and touch and kiss him. The next, he felt crushed already under suffocating agony. And then he felt angry, because all of this seemed a bit early, a bit pre-emptive and presumptuous besides.
Draco sat up in interest and craned his neck to take in all he could. Not that there was much to take in. The road was narrow, with trees and overgrown shrubs dotting either side.
At least the celebratory mood had broken up. But Draco no longer cared about that. He took several deep breaths, shoved his fists into his pockets, and went into the kitchen. He'd just located his favourite mug from the cupboard when he turned around and saw he wasn't alone.
Potter drew his legs up onto the sofa and folded them underneath him. "I missed them. I needed to see them. I needed something happy, and when I read that letter, I knew I had to go."
do." They made their way up the aisle. Potter set a box of eggs in the trolley, which was full and getting difficult to push. "And who cares? We have the money." Draco didn't understand Potter's problem.
Draco stumbled into the bedroom and crawled under the blankets, grateful that it was Potter's turn to have the sofa that week. He kicked his shoes off, then wriggled out of his shirt and trousers and threw them on the floor. Sleep would be great.
Draco leapt to action. Pierce had thrown Harry off as they fell over, but Draco launched himself at Pierce and pinned him to the ground. One look into his remorseless expression was all it took, and Draco began punching him in the face. It was so cathartic to hear him cry out and writhe in pain. This was only a fraction of what he deserved for using the Cruciatus Curse on Harry.
"You can do that," Draco said. He opened all the cupboards, but there wasn't much in them. Some were empty. "Where's the tea?"
By the time Draco arrived and sat at the kitchen table, Potter had already begun eating. There seemed to be an odd tension in the air. Draco spooned potatoes onto his plate and shook his head. Perhaps Potter was still upset about the crosswords.
And mercifully, this outing was considerably more pleasant than the last one. Draco fixed the charm Harry had cast on his shoes last time, and now they were comfortable to walk in. Instead of wondering how much longer until they were back home, he could actually enjoy the scenery this time.
Draco gave a cursory glance around as he shoved his keys into his pocket. He did a double-take when his eyes latched onto a familiar figure that came to a sudden halt at the end of the street. A very familiar figure. One with messy hair and bright green eyes that shifted from Draco to Whitby, confused.
As he locked the door to the shop and began the walk home, Draco paused at the spot where he and Potter usually split ways. He knew where Potter lived, of course. He remembered the address from the land deed Potter had shoved at him nearly a lifetime ago. All for a blanket. All for this.
"We've already been administering one to you while you were unconscious." Whitby pulled out a small jar with thick blue liquid in it and placed it on the bedside table. "But now that you're awake, you can take it yourself."
Whitby cast whatever spells he needed in order to assess how terribly Draco was doing. It took several minutes. Draco focused on the sound of the flames crackling in the fireplace, and Whitby paused at various intervals to scratch notes onto his parchment. Draco waited until he said, "All finished," before opening his eyes.
He held his breath as he passed by MacDonald's and Jennings' cubicles, thankful when they didn't call him over. Either they didn't see him or they didn't suspect him of anything—Draco didn't care which.
"There's this place up in the Lake District that, erm—well, Lawrence and I used it as our meeting point." Potter paused and frowned at his plate before continuing. "I'll write down the coordinates for you. But there's an abandoned shack about fifty paces west of a fallen tree. We can meet there, if there's an emergency."
Yet every afternoon when he went to the bookshop, Harry found his resolve wearing thin when Draco greeted him with a smile. And when evening came around and they bid farewell with a lengthy, albeit chaste hug, the faint smell of peaches always helped to chase away any remaining concerns Harry might have had.
"Eating's not going to fix anything," Draco said. "And did you miss the memo that Pierce knows where we are? We should go somewhere else."
"Good night," Draco said. Unbidden, the memory of Potter kissing him came forth, and with horror, he realised he was getting hard.
"Hmm," Draco said. It seemed strange that he could feel so at ease living in a Muggle village. He knew they weren't all bad, though. Jeremy was funny, and Emily made great cakes and biscuits. Plus, there were no Jaffa Cakes in the wizarding world.
"Yes. And whoever the culprits were, they died." Everything truly was too perfectly aligned to be a coincidence now. But there were still pieces missing. Why did Pierce want to kill Harry
Draco glanced at himself in the window again. He looked understated and elegant, exactly as one should on a first date.
"All right, let's go," Potter's voice said. Draco spun to see where he was and laughed when he crashed right into him. "Naomi's going to drive us home."
"It poisons the blood." Draco looked down and saw that Potter's hands were also clasped together. "It's irreversible."
The heady rush of pleasure almost erased the worry in Draco's mind. He rolled onto his back, pulling Potter on top of him, and angled his hips upwards to press into Potter's hardening cock.
The waiter appeared with their food. Draco stabbed his duck breast and began cutting it into smaller pieces, pointedly ignoring a glob of sauce that fell onto Lewis's robes as he tucked into his own food.
"Well, it's not as though it's the first time someone wants to kill me," Harry said with a rueful smile. His hands gripped the edge of the sofa. "I need to think this through. I think we can figure out who it is." He looked up at Draco. "Who knows you're protecting me?"
Draco’s cheeks turned red, but he stood his ground, glaring silently at Harry before turning to Neville. “I think it would be good if I get a job while I’m at college and I figured here would be best, both since I know you and I am familiar doing duties that are similar to this. I’ve regularly cooked, made drinks, and served my grandparents and their friends whenever we had company over.”
Harry stepped to chase after, but Hermione stopped him. “I’ll talk to her,” she said, getting off the bed. “In the meantime, why don’t you two try to make Malfoy understand what’s going on here?”
Draco licked and stuck his tongue in Harry’s ass, causing the feminine boy’s moan to go higher and higher as his tongue prodded his hole, followed later by a slick finger. “Pussy feels good full of Draco’s finger, Harry?” Blaise chuckled.
The house-elves stopped and looked at Harry. The closest one wearing only a burlap sack with the Malfoy insignia on it said, “How can we be helping the young master?”
“You would best keep your opinions to yourself or else I will take action against you as well!” Minister Fudge yelled at Mr. Krum.
“And it’s what got me drawn to you Harry,” Draco said, “believe it or not you have something similar to that. People are drawn to you Harry, for better or worse. I have for years.”
“Alright, but what else do you want to do besides carry my children?” Draco asked with such a serious face that Harry had to stare at him for a long moment to make sure he was joking.
“Don’t be,” Remus said. He looked at his boys and brought them into a hug before turning to the letters, dividing the stack between the twins.
“Uh… Mrs. Lestrange?” A girl said, raising her hand. Harry looked over at the voice to see it was Lavender Brown.
Dumbledore nodded. He leaned back in his chair, a deeply thoughtful expression on his face as he examined Harry. Silence filled the room, and, feeling awkward, Harry went back to playing with his food, taking small bites now and again. Around him, the adults shared looks, Sirius and Lupin huddled together in one corner speaking in hushed whispers while Mrs. Weasley and Tonks watched Harry closely. Moody, however, had one eye on Harry while his electric blue eye whirled around his head, looking upwards. The silence grew, and its tension slowly started to wear down on Harry. He glanced at Dumbledore, who still looked deep in thought.
“Good luck,” Draco said and he pulled Harry into a deep, long kiss, his hand snaking up Harry’s shirt, grabbing and teasing his chest. Harry moaned, but pushed away. “Not now,” he panted. “I promised Ron and Hermione that I’ll spend time with them.”
Draco gave an impatient sneer, “I know it was one of you who whispered that spell in my ear,” he said, “telling me how to make Goyle infertile. Come out now, Harry is my submissive, and so are you!” Still there was darkness. Draco turned to Harry and grabbed the back of his neck, “Show them your submission, boy,” he commanded.
Harry felt tears pool in his eyes as he looked up at his father. “I’m sorry,” he whispered. “I’m so, so sorry.”
Both teens were too distracted by their pleasures that the world disappeared around them, all that mattered was what was on the picnic blanket as Connor ate Harry out. They did not notice a figure standing just outside their small clearing. A figure who had a harsh face riddled with scars and was wearing tattered robes. The man’s eyes were solely fixed on Harry and he breathed in as the full moon’s light hit him through the leaves. He did not need to change, no, not now, he wanted to see the fear and recognition on the Potter boy’s face before he did. But the muggle boy could be a problem. He looked strong, usable, and most importantly, disposable. Chuckling to himself, the man step towards them. “A bitch and a bodyguard,” he said to himself. “Can it get any better?”
“Don’t you dare mock me with that name,” the woman snarled. Mr. Riddle laughed and took a bite of his apple. “You mortal fool, you do not know my Master’s will and you never know. I will do to the boy as I like.”
“And how much blood does this—ahh oh fuck—potion needs?” Harry swore as his hand shook, opening the wound to a two inch cut down his arm. Voldemort just stared irritably before moving to a nearby cabinet, opening it to reveal vial after vial of a dark red potion. He took one and closed the cabinet before returning to Harry.
Harry frowned, “I mean I have other dreams but… I never had a secure home where I felt I’ve belonged. As twisted as it sounds, I have that with my dad and Draco, even if my father is an insane murderous maniac.”
“Good boy,” Draco hushed, rubbing his hand delicately on Harry’s cheek. “That’s a good boy, suck my nuts… that’s it, now my cock again.”
Harry’s cheeks went red. He shuffled nervously and looked at Ron for help. Ron, however, still looked like a living dead, staring into a defeated air. “That’s because,” he muttered, “I’m bonded to him. He’s courting me.”
The three shared a confused look about the encounter before going back to their research. When it was time for them to head to class, Harry decided to pocket the smallest of the books, casting a quick illusion spell to sneak it out. He was able to read it at lunch, with Draco and Blaise huddled on either side until, again, they were interrupted by Mrs. Lestrange. “My Potter, you sure do want to know about marriages… why is that? You thinking of having an Unholy Matrimony soon? You cannot possibly need to read this much for a project, you might hurt your pretty little face.”
“So we’ll have to find a way to keep him away,” Uncle Sirius said, “And I’ll be dead before I let a crucifix in here…”
The two left the dorm, Ron locking it, and with another grin, Ron swung his arm for Draco to follow him. “We’re walking, the place is close by,” he said.
Her hand moving quicker than lightning, Harry felt intense pain as she squeezed his groin. Shock, embarrassment, mortification, and absolute shame and dread filled Harry as she squeezed. It lasted less than a second, but it lasted an eternity as Harry’s face fell further than before; his eyes pooling with bitter tears of both pain and shame; his tears washing away his eyeliner and mascara down his cheeks. Meanwhile Parkinson’s laugh only turned higher, crueler as she jumped away as Orion and Lycaon began barking madly, chasing her down as she screamed out laughing, “There’s a prick! A very small prick! The girl-boy has a prick!”
“We just got here,” Harry lied. “Uhh… Blaise and I have homework that we need to do in my room…” He looked at Blaise and walked quickly passed Uncle Remus and Uncle Sirius, up the stairs to his room, the demon following after. Harry didn’t talk until he was safe in his room, the door closed behind him. He fell to the floor, sliding against the door until he was curled in a ball. Blaise watched him for a moment and sighed.
“And now Brothers and Sisters, we shall all stand in honor as these men take their first meetings as husbands,” Mr. Riddle said. The sound of standing filled the church.
“I have a question, Professor, and you seem to be ignoring raised hands,” Harry said innocently. “This must be a translation error between my learning from Durmstrang to Hogwarts, however, it seems to me that you claim that there is no reason whatsoever to practice spells because there will be no situation, ever, when you would be attacked.”
“How many Weasleys are there here?” Draco asked in a sharp tone. Harry did not like how he asked the question, but still he thought for a moment to answer. “Five Weasleys, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Ron, Ginny, and Bill, along with Bill’s fiancée and Hermione, and us two.”
Ron nodded and closed the door before he could see his mother’s worried face. Walking urgently, Mrs. Weasley made her way back to the kitchen where both Sirius and Lupin were sitting. “Have either of you seen Harry?” she asked worryingly. “He wasn’t in his room.”
“Maybe,” Niall smirked, “Sexy thing named Neville Longbottom. The boy is filled out in all the right places.”
Voldemort moved in front of them, and all mutters and whispers stopped. “My friends, followers,” he called out. “Today we are gathered here to celebrate the joining of my blood, my heir and apprentice, to the Malfoy Family!” Harry had to resist a sigh. He and Draco squeezed each other’s hands. “Today, my son… Harry Potter himself, whom I have stolen from the Light and bred into my own child will join in holy matrimony with Draco Malfoy, the son of my most loyal of followers.”
Valentine’s Day came quickly. Harry was surprised as he, Ron and Hermione sat at Gryffindor Table in the Great Hall, when Theo came over and sat next to Ron, the ginger kissing the Slytherin’s cheek. “Good morning,” Theo said to Hermione and Harry, “hope you don’t mind, but I kind of want to have breakfast with my boyfriend.”
“Your cause,” Harry countered. He took the quill, and like before he crossed out each name, one by one. “You are my father,” he said, “you have taught me many things… you’re the reason why I’m with Draco in some ways, but I will not tolerate your followers.” He expected Voldemort to be angry, to lash out, instead there was only a cold smirk.
“Or, you can leave my house now and I might forget the fact that you’ve came in here uninvited,” Uncle Sirius said angrily, standing up to meet Mr. Malfoy.
“My bed. Sleep in my bed,” Harry said. “I would feel safer… if I was in your arms.” They both shared a smile and Draco quickly scrambled out of his small bed and onto Harry’s. “And…” Harry continued, his cheeks blushing madly as he talked, not knowing where this was coming from but loving every moment, “it would be hot in the bed if we’re both in it so… I think it would be better for both of us to take off our shirts.”
“What about you, Cedric?” Harry asked, looking at the Hufflepuff. “What are you going to do after Hogwarts?”
Wormtail stopped and turned to Harry, scared. Harry’s scar was burning almost pass his endurance, but he gritted through it. “I’m going to kill you Wormtail!” Harry yelled. “Let that monster drown, or else I’ll make it last!”
Draco’s eyes lit up for a moment. “Harry,” he said, “a word?” Harry nodded and leaned towards each other. “I think you should,” he said.
Harry gave him a short glare and shook his head. “I never lied to anyone,” he said. “I just never told you guys about it because it was my private life. But now the world knows, so I want to set the record straight.”
Harry first noticed white. Whiteness surrounded him. A misty whiteness that seemed to not have formed anything yet as Harry looked around. It was not foggy, nor was it clear. Harry could look through the misty whiteness that surrounded him, and yet there was nothing there. Nothing surrounded him, nothing formed, no noticeable figures or shapes or landmarks. There was nothing. And then, a darkness appeared. A black cloud out in the distance. Harry knew that he had to go there. He walked towards the darkness, the mist moving out of his way forming a path. There was no sound, not even his footsteps, and Harry started to get uneased by the silence. And the whiteness. It was too bright, the more Harry looked at it, the more he came to realize. It was a cold whiteness that surrounded him, and the more he thought about it, the more he realized just how cold it was. Even his feet started to feel cold against the once neutral floor.
“Due to your transfer, I am telling you now that I will not accept any foolishness in my classroom. You are at Hogwarts now. Any privileges you’ve enjoyed at Durmstrang would best be forgotten,” Snape warned.
The morning lasted too quickly for Harry’s liking. Like Hermione said, they spent it preparing for the next D.A. meeting, as well as talking with other Gryffindors in the common room. At a quarter to four, Harry excused himself and left the common room, turning a corner and entered the nearest closet. He did not bother turning on the lights, instead he stared at the red eyes. “Bring me to Yaxley’s home,” he demanded and walked into the darkness, the vial of the Strangler clutched firmly in his pocketed hand.
“He’s going to be all right,” she said, her voice weak with tiredness. “He’s sleeping. We can all go and see him later. Bill’s sitting with him now, he’s going to take the morning off work.”
“Try boy, and you’ll meet the same fate as all the others.” And with the threat hanging in the air, Satan disappeared.
Dumbledore was gone from Hogwarts. Umbridge was now in charge, calling herself Headmistress Umbridge. There was a tense feeling around the castle. Everyone was skittish, everyone was angry. It felt as though the castle itself was afraid of what was coming next. And yet, while he was angry, Harry fell back to his research. He needed to learn how to control the Horcrux inside him. He needed to learn more about how his father became practically immortal. Two days went by, and this angry nervousness became the new normal. It was Saturday, the beginning of the weekend, and very early in the morning.
He found the Gryffindor Potter talking with the other Gryffindors as they loitered in the corridors by the Great Hall. He looked slightly uncomfortable as Weasley pressed against him, and Draco held his head high as he tried to look as snooty and confident as possible. “Potter,” he called out.
“That girl,” Mrs. Weasley said annoyingly, looking at Harry as though he would agree with her. Harry just stayed silent. “Anyway, I really did come here to talk to you about your condition… Dumbledore stayed after you fell asleep, and we talked, Dumbledore with Arthur and I. Obviously we don’t want to isolate you or cause the others to worry… so we agreed that during the full moon you’ll be here. Everything will be reinforced and charmed so that you’re safe—and you will have the Wolfsbane Potion, obviously. It will be a little close but Dumbledore will make sure that it’ll be made just in time—Severus is making it.”
Exhausted and wanting nothing but his bed, Harry led Draco and Blaise by the hand to his room where they undressed and slipped into bed as husbands; Blaise in the middle with Draco and Harry laying on him, their hands held while Blaise’s arms were holding their shoulders. “So my beautiful mages,” Blaise said sleepily, “what big adventure should we do next?”
“Actually no,” Draco answered, feeling silly for having nothing, not that he would hang up if he had them. “But uh… I like the fairy lights. If you don’t mind, I kind of want to get another string and just finish along the windows and wall.”
“Your mother is right boys,” Lupin interjected. “All of you should get out. This is official Order business.”
“Move behind me,” Voldemort ordered, and he took a step in front of Harry, his hand gone from Harry’s back. Harry missed it immediately. Voldemort led Harry down the room towards the end where he saw three figures sitting. They all stood to stand as he got closer, their blonde hair immediately recognizable.
Harry rolled his eyes but smiled genuinely, “Okay then, Sir,” he said in a teasing tone, “I’ll go get clean for Master now.”
“I see,” Mr. Riddle nodded, his wife whispering in his ear. “Thank you… Harry, you are indeed changed, there is a womb beginning to form inside you.”
Harry did not expect, returning home, to find three letters waiting for him. He was exhausted, wanting nothing more than to sleep, but knew that any moment Aunt Petunia would call him down to get dinner started. So he went to the letters and smiled, they were from Ron, Hermione, as well as surprisingly the twins. He opened Ron’s up first, the first letter of the summer, only to see that it was short.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded to Ron. “He uh has this club thing, ‘Slug Club’ or something. It was full of his past students including my mum and… Voldemort,” he said. The three were silent for a while. Harry looked between the two of them. “He doesn’t seem bad, Slughorn I mean,” he said. “The Death Eaters were looking for him too, but he was on the run.”
Loki, the old god not Harry’s familiar, decided on the way to Harry’s home to change his clothes, choosing a slim black suit with a loose pink tie and brown pants, it did not meld very well, and Harry did not want to comment on it in fear that the old god might start talking again. When they returned to the Black House, Harry found his uncles in the back room, lounging with their familiars.
“Then you better shape up your Transfiguration grades, though casting spells is rare in the art of potion-making, I assume that you are at least aware that there are several difficult potions that require its ingredients to be transfigured from other objects,” Professor McGonagall said.
“I know, but I can’t stay with you,” Niall frowned. “I don’t want to accidentally give you my peanut butter.”
“Both of you are acting so damn childish it’s actually amazing and really annoying at the same time! So take your egos, stuff them where the sun don’t shine and make up!” Harry screamed. His chest was huffing when he was done, his eyes darting between Draco and Blaise.
Blaise glared at her for a second before stepping forward. She directed Blaise to stand in the center of the circle, where she met him there. “Right, well, I’m here to teach you lot how to fight, yeah? Well the magic Lord Satan has gifted all of us can be used in many offensive ways, why, with enough madness you can just about do anything!” She gave a short laugh before stopping suddenly. Her eyes changed, having a deadly gaze about them as she whipped her wrist and hand towards Blaise. A ring of ice appeared around the boy and quickly shrunk, squeezing and locking him in place. Blaise gave out a small yelp of pain. “Ow!”
“F-Father,” Harry said hoarsely, clearing his throat. Voldemort smirked as he heard his son. He squeezed tight enough to set a reminder.
“Oh, so that’s why he didn’t answer my letters?” Theo asked, “I thought he was being rude.” He stared at Harry for a moment, his nose held up. He looked as though he was thinking for a moment. “Since you’re here, that means someone needs to find another compartment.”
“I don’t want to—I—I grew to like you, however…” Harry found his throat caught. “I cannot condone what you are after Voldemort.”
“Thank you Uncle Remus,” Harry said, not looking up at his uncle. “Uncle? Do you know if we have spear thistles in the garden?”
Bellatrix frowned at this; she loved her Dark Master. Every fiber of her being existed to serve Him. And yet… this haggard tiredness existed. Lilith saw this and shook her head, “It may have been a mistake coming here,” she said, “yes you failed to kill a boy, but in your defense, the Prince was in our way. He taught Harry spells that covens forgotten long ago. If anything, I would say you’ve proven to our Lord how powerful Potter is, how much of a good match—a good wife he will be, and give him a powerful spawn.”
“A couple things,” Cedric said. It was then that Harry saw that Cedric was looking nervous. “You liking boys and uhh… that stuff you studied.” His cheeks were red, and Harry felt a little uncomfortable. Cedric said this and quickly said, “No, no, no! Not like that! I mean—I don’t—I’m not homophobic! In fact, uhh… I kind of like boys, you see, and girls. I thought I was the only one here who did…”
After breakfast, Draco came over near lunch. He had a very satisfied look and he greeted Blaise with a kiss before doing the same with Harry. The five convened in the living room with Uncle Sirius and Uncle Remus taking up one love seat while the lovers take up the other, larger one, Blaise in the center and Harry and Draco on either side. All four warlocks looked towards Blaise expectantly. “Well,” Draco said, “what did you find out?”
Harry decided to say nothing. He got onto the train with Ron and Hermione, “I’m going to find Draco,” he said to them, “I hope that’s okay.”
“My womb is alright,” Harry said, “my father checked it as soon as I told him on the train station before I left for Hogwarts. My womb was weak but still functional. It’s healing now, and my father sent me potions to help with the healing process.”
“Good morning,” Harry smiled, “would my father mind if I cook him breakfast? Surely he doesn’t have house elves here.” He giggled to himself and went to what he hoped was the bathroom. Nagini followed, but Harry did not think to argue to the snake about privacy. Instead, he focused on cleaning himself and getting ready for the day. Freshly showered, he looked through the drawers of his dressers and wardrobes only to see that they were all empty. With nothing else to wear, Harry dressed in his school uniform and went downstairs, Nagini following him.
Harry woke up feeling very comfortable. In his sleep, he snuggled deeper into the plushie he was holding and grumbled, “Niall, I don’t wanna wake up shut up.”
“However Tom, I have to argue that Harry’s interest might be unnatural,” Dumbledore countered. “If through your research it can be proven that you are manipulating him against everything he knew—”
Draco smirked and wrapped his arms possessively around Harry. “A ceremony, huh?” he said thoughtfully. “We only have days left before we have to leave.”
“Because if Weasley and Granger see you angry they’ll unfairly blame me, and I rather keep my looks than have Weasley try to curse me,” Draco chuckled. Harry giggled and shook his head, “I’ll explain it to them, come on.” He took Draco’s hand and pulled him forward, “since you’re here, you can help me with Snape’s essay.”
“What a load of disgusting garbage,” Harry muttered. But that was the world that Draco lived in, a world that Harry now found himself plunging into. So, he had to know it, and had to swim through it, otherwise there was no way he would be able to have Draco as his boyfriend. Still, Harry would never do that, he would never denounce his mother. There were noises downstairs and he could hear the all familiar stomps of his uncle coming up the stairs towards his room. “I can denounce the Dursleys, however,” he muttered. He closed the book and rolled off his bed just as Uncle Vernon slammed the door opened. “Boy! Get downstairs and clean up the garden! Figg’s cats got to it again, the ruddy things!”
Potter smiled and pulled down his soft cotton joggers. Draco's eyes went straight to the bulge in his pants.
Draco exchanged a look with Harry, and they made their way to Robards' office. They sat down in front of his desk, which was littered with stacks of parchment.
From the corner of his eye, Draco watched Potter use a small, beige 'ecelectrical' box to place an order for dinner somewhere. When he returned and sat on the sofa, he turned off the telly.
"We can try a few more potions. However, you really - and I can not emphasise this enough - you really aren't in a fit state to travel by Floo or Apparition any longer. In addition to everything else, your bones are getting fragile, and they can't handle such trauma."
His friends leapt up when they saw he was awake. Their mouths opened, like they wanted to say something.
He thought for a moment before continuing. "There was no meeting, though. Lawrence and I waited for a long time, but nobody ever came. Eventually, we came out of hiding and explored the building. It was on the first floor… That was where I saw the potion. It took me a moment to realise what it was. If I'd just been a little quicker—"
A short, frail-looking old woman in a spotted dress smiled up at Draco over a cake. Soft grey curls poked out from underneath her hat.
They trudged after him and went into a kitchen. An old kitchen. Bright sunlight streamed in through the windows and highlighted several spots of chipped paint on the faded yellow walls.
Someone bumped into Draco, knocking him from his reverie. He shuffled towards the pub with a mix of excitement and dread in his stomach. When he peered inside through the windows, it was like looking into the past.
At his desk, Draco stared idly at his eagle feather quill and stroked it. A blank piece of parchment sat in front of him. Robards' words played through his mind again, and he frowned in disbelief. It certainly didn't feel as though he was willing to give Draco any chances. All the assignments he and Barclay had been given were dead simple. They usually spent more of their time on paperwork.
Draco began unpacking another month's supply of the blue potion and the clear potion. There was also a month's supply of two new potions - some thick, green sludge and something else that looked the colour of morning piss.
A minute later, or possibly a few, a crack resonated, and Whitby stood before Draco in the clearing, hair in disarray.
"Just shut up and fuck me," Draco said, pulling Harry's head down to quieten him with a kiss. He could feel Harry's mouth curl into a smile against his lips, and one hand traced a path down Draco's side to squeeze his thigh.
Draco scowled and let his fork and knife clatter against the plate. His heart pounded as he approached the door and turned the handle. He didn't want to admit it to Potter, but part of him was afraid of interacting with Muggles on his own.
All of Draco's other regulars made their daily or weekly appearances. A number of tourists paraded through, grateful to have somewhere quiet and warm to spend a cold and rainy afternoon.
"I think they're still out by the sofa." Harry grinned at the memory of last night. "Hurry up, I need to let her in," he called, and followed Draco out, eyes on his arse.
Draco had never been down here. He found the wall and placed his hand to it, surprised to discover it curved.
He snatched the stack of letters and scurried from Robards' office to where MacDonald and Jennings sat. Hopefully MacDonald was in the office today. She hated him slightly less than Jennings.
The only good thing—aside from Draco having the bed again that week—was that the animosity with Potter had settled to bland civility.
Draco donned his Barbour jacket before leaving the cottage each morning and stepped through thick patches of wet leaves on his way to and from the book shop.
Nobody moved so Harry sighed and began his story. “Yes when I was fourteen, Viktor Krum and I were dating. He was my Alpha and I was his Omega. He taught me everything I knew. He never mentioned a bonding necklace however when we talked, it was always about after school. Marrying after school, carrying his children, becoming his boywife he would call it,” Harry blushed. “I loved the idea, even the name is nice to me, however now I would argue to be called his husband,” he glanced at Draco. “By the end of the year, though, Viktor went away without a goodbye. I was heartbroken, obviously, but fifth year made me quickly forget about my old Alpha. I don’t need to tell you guys what happened last year but during the summer, I met my father, my real father.
Harry nodded and their lips were together. The kiss was soft and lasting, the boys pressing their lips together as their eyes slid shut. The boys wrapped their arms around the other, Harry feeling electricity coursing through him followed by a heat that warmed every inch of his body. He never wanted to leave, never wanted to get out of Draco’s arms. Finally, everything was over, and he felt safe. They separated for only a moment and smiled at each other before kissing again, cameras flashing all around them.
“Good, then if you would please fill out the form,” she indicated to the paper. With a wave of her wand, a quill and ink bottle appeared. Harry took the quill and looked down at the form. It seemed simple enough to complete. It asked for basic information, his full name, relationship status, as well as his heat dates. Harry filled it all out, feeling strange as he wrote down ‘Harry Salazar Riddle,’ and handed the form back to Professor McGonagall. She read through it. “Your heat is in two weeks, Mr. Riddle,” she said. “Very well, I shall let your professors know so that you can be properly excused.” She glanced through it once more. “I see your heat lasts two days, is that correct?”
Harry sighed and shook his head once more, “Can we just move past this? I want to get this done as soon as I can.”
“I did? Well too bad,” Mrs. Lestrange shrugged. “If you are late, you will suffer a month’s detention. Goodbye.” And with that she left, the door closing behind her.
“And take better care of yourself! The next time I see you I want to see your muscles back—no, I want to see them bigger!” Harry demanded. Viktor chuckled and ruffled his hair.
“Yeah I guess you’re right,” Harry sighed. He forced himself to forget about the feeling and relaxed with his friends for the remainder of their break. When it was time to go back to the castle, clouds were slowly gathering in the sky. Harry felt the strange feeling again and looked over his shoulder when they reached the doorway into the castle. Once more, he saw nothing and walked inside.
“You’re doing enough—the desserts and tea and treating my wounds,” Harry said, his cheeks turning red.
Feeling himself and cute, Harry went downstairs to see breakfast was already ready. “Harry,” Draco said softly, getting up to hug his boyfriend. “How did you sleep?”
“Yes, my dear husband, I’m turning that hole of yours into a proper pussy,” Draco said, “how else will you carry our kids?”
“It wasn’t until the middle of October that they came back to me about it. This was a week or two before the other schools came here, Cedric. They cornered me in the Gryffindor common room and dragged me away to an isolated place. ‘We have the solution to your problems, Harry,’ Fred said. ‘We know what you are and how you can get your man!’ George said happily. I asked what they meant, and George said, ‘Well from what you told us, you want to be kinky Harry!’ ‘Or,’ Fred said, ‘You have desires to enter into a relationship that, compared to others, seem off or weird. What we mean is that you are naturally a submissive.’ I was confused, so I asked them what exactly they meant. It was a long explanation, they told me about dominant/submissive culture, sex, it was very awkward and very, uhh, well you know, don’t you Cedric?
“Ten points from Gryffindor,” Umbridge said, “And for the record Mr. Potter, we are not in that savage school, we are in Hogwarts! Where we live and learn in a just and orderly civilization.”
Draco looked around. He wasn’t sure what exactly he was going to do. After all, he’s only a fifteen year old wizard, the only reason he knew the Imperious Curse was because of Professor Moody last year. “What would Harry do?” he said aloud. He looked at Goyle. “Punch yourself while I think,” he said. Goyle showed no resistance, his hands curling into fists as he started to punch his stomach over and over. Draco watched for a moment, lost in thought.
“We’ll be in our seats if you need us,” Uncle Sirius said. The two hugged Harry and moved around the outside of the seats, reaching the front where three empty seats were kept. They were right in front of Draco and his parents. Harry stood awkwardly at the aisle between the chairs, his feet feeling like lead. It took him all of his concentration and nerves to take one step.
Belby, who was thin and nervous looking, gave a strained smile. “and this charming young lady tells me she knows you!”
“Oh, well I don’t know,” Daphne shrugged. “I mean, Gin’s still figuring stuff out herself, she’s still very hurt by you Harry.”
“I think it’s a great idea,” Draco said. “I know that Crabbe and Goyle have been trying to get pregnant, or at least they act like it.”
“Not much,” Harry said, “Just that from what the books say, it’s absolutely forbidden to mess with them. However Voldemort did somehow and created his Horcruxes.”
There was barely a warning as Greyback jumped from the dust, tackling Draco, his sharp claws digging into Draco’s arms. Draco struggled, failing to push the adult off of him, even with his enhanced strength. Greyback roared and opened his mouth to bite Draco’s neck, but the teen kneed him, earning a tiny bit of freedom that he used to moved both his hands, pushing Greyback’s head away as he bit wildly like a mad dog. “Get him,” Draco grunted, struggling to keep the man away as he continued to claw Draco’s arms, blood bleeding and staining his hands.
“Shame, purely a shame,” Voldemort sighed. “Then I will redouble my efforts on the two of you.” He turned to Vernon and Petunia and tapped his wand onto a nearby flower vase, which turned into many sharp sewing needles and thread. He smirked coldly at the two of them and pointed his wand.
The omega was a thing of beauty. He looked completely serious, but his emerald eyes shone with a mischievous glee that stole Draco’s heart. His petite hands moved purposefully, preparing his ingredients to perfection, even with the rare ingredients that Draco barely had any experience with, including the werewolf fur. Sweat started to appear on Harry’s face, but it only added to his beauty, giving the omega a healthy shine that Draco wanted to kiss and touch so badly. The Alpha groaned and kept himself in his place. Soon, he promised himself, soon Harry will be his. The boy was already on his way, and each moment he spent with Harry, Draco found himself falling for the Omega more and more.
The train began to slow down, everyone has changed, and the usual racket up and down it as everyone scrambled to get their luggage and pets assembled, ready for departure overtook the train. Ron and Hermione were supposed to supervise all of this; they disappeared from the carriage, leaving Harry and the others to look after Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon.
“That can’t be possible. A Somniatus would have had been in my house for at least a decade...” The realization of the situation hit him hard. He had been so lonely and depressed that he had attracted an actually monster.
“Are you going to tell me or not, Potter?” Draco was getting impatient. Harry looked at Draco, this time obviously drunk. He grinned and moved in closer to Draco.
Then there were the Dementors, that seemed to feed off Harry’s bad memories as if Harry was the only thing they could feed from. He had passed out on the train and in the quidditch match, where Harry fell at least a hundred feet from the air.
Malfoy seemed touched by this. He more into the room, closing a distance between Harry and him. “I don’t deserve that Potter. I don’t deserve your forgiveness.”
"What? Thought that the world revolves around you? Thought that your name meant that we all actually liked you? Don't you get it? We only pretended to like you because of your name." Harry looked at Ron, the boy who was his best friend.
It was clear that Draco didn’t talk about this often. There was a war going on inside the boys head, and it was obvious to Harry that maybe this was a touchy subject. He didn’t want to press forward into a conversation that Draco didn’t want to talk about. So he went to say so, but as his mouth opened to speak, Draco spoke.
“I always expected Harry Potter, savior of the wizarding world, to be the center of the celebration when it all ended. Expected for you to be eager for the attention.” Harry rolled his eyes at the remark and opened his mouth to say something only to find Malfoy wasn’t done.
Harry shook his head. “No.” He said shortly, the red head, his first ever friend, only looked away as if this didn’t surprise him. “Ron?” Harry said stopped him from walking away.
Draco at this point was tired of being stuck with Harry. He was sure that he was cursed to live out the rest of his life around Potter. Was the world this cruel that he would be forever forced to live with the one person that constantly reminded him of his horrid past? It sure did seem so.
Harry Potter couldn’t believe his luck. After getting put in detention for being out passed curfew, now he was stuck walking through the forbidden forest with Draco Malfoy and fang.
“Why am I not surprised that Draco Malfoy is a fan of fruity drinks?” Harry said, laughing at Draco’s eye rolling. “Hey, I’m only joking with you. Lighten up a little, Malfoy. We have been around each other all year so far. And we’re only three months in. Don’t you think that maybe, we should maybe try to make the most of it?”
The walk into the castle was also one he had expected. This one though, holding not so fond feelings. The last time he had walked through these halls, he had been fighting for his death. And nothing in the world could vanish the sorrow and emptiness that came as they walked in. This was also why he had chosen to do this here. This was a reminder that what he was doing, what he was going to do later that night, was destined to happen.
The halls were quiet and empty now. The light from the moon shown through the windows, creating just enough light for Harry to make out the details of his surroundings and truly admire their beauty one last time. How many times had he walked through the halls, sneaking off to do stupid tasks. He wished now he would have just stayed out of trouble. Lived like a normal teenager who figured out himself and dated and laughed and cried. But he had never been given that opportunity.
Draco didn’t answer right away. He stayed quiet for a long moment and even when he did speak, his voice sounded sad. Harry couldn’t stop himself from looking. The look on his face matched the boys voice. He looked lost in sorrow.
Draco Malfoy, the once arrogant, annoying Prat, looked not so arrogant and not so annoying. He knew that the boy had not done well with the end results of the war. His hair was no longer in a gelled, combed back do. His skin was paler than usual and this eyes were so black from the lake of sleep. He looked like the walking dead, which Harry didn’t doubt he himself looked like.
“I think... I think that’s a good idea, Draco.” The use of Dracos name made his head feel Dizzy. Draco smiled and took no time to leave the bar quickly, not caring that they would be taking a car back to the hotel. Even the car ride wasn’t as bad as it had been.
“No problem mate. I don’t know what I would have done without you. Your my best friend. Like hermione said. It’ll get better.” Ron didn’t say anything after that. Harry watched him walk away, the last person he had wanted to give his final farewell too, gone.
Harry never thought that when he decided to get away from everything that had just happened, that it would mean that Draco Malfoy of all people would be the one to come and comfort him. Oddly enough, he enjoyed someone who wasn’t crying over a death or celebrating. In fact, it felt as if he could actually relate to the blonde.
Neither of them sad a word, as they walked through the crowded corridor that held the Floo fireplaces in them. They both knew that the words they wanted to say at this moment, were not ones that they could express.
They both began walking again. It wasn’t long before they found the unicorn in the ground and a hooded shadow figure was drinking from it.
Draco never said a word. He listened in horror to the stories and questioned why on earth he was here in the first place. Most days he hoped that Harry Potter would come and defeat the vile man and save the wizarding world so that Draco could be free from this hell. Even if he knew that he would spend the rest of his sad life in Azkaban, but anything was better than this.
"Draco, you have become a death eater?" The long haired death eater snares at him. Harry can't understand why this is bothering him so badly.
Even after Harry awoke, and defeated Voldemort, he still couldn’t find Harry. And when the Aurors came and took the remaining death eaters away, he hoped that Harry would keep his promise, and fight for him.
Harry opened his eyes and turned to see the last person he had ever expected to see, Draco Malfoy. Harry opened his mouth to say something but Draco didn’t let him.
The moment that something happened in the all but exciting life of Harry Potter, some how the wizarding world knew about it. Harry was always confused how people got a hold of this information at times, but in a world full of magic, nothing ever surprised him anymore.
Keeping face around Draco in public though, was getting harder, since the boy was now the seeker for the slytherin quidditch team. Draco would always ignore Harry for about two or three days afterwards, until he was ready talk. Which usually resulted in Draco bringing him chocolate his mother made for him.
Nights at the Manor were worse than the day time. The sound of horrific petrifying wails could be heard from anywhere in the Manor and sometimes he wished that he go down and make the never ending nightmare end. Luckily, One night after walking in on Nagini, the dark lords snake, eating a very much alive Muggleborn wizard completely whole, his mother taught him how to put a silencing charm around him so he would never have to experience that again.
"Why are you doing this?" He asked in a low voice that sounded almost hurt. Draco stopped and looked at Harry and their eyes met.
Draco thrusted in and out at a fast pace, bringing himself to finish inside Harry, his name on his lips. It wasn’t long before Draco collapsed onto Harry, both bodies covered in sweat and breathing hard.
Patiently, he waited for Draco to stop, and when he did he pulled back from Draco’s embrace, standing inches from him still.
“Now, I’m about to tell you the thing that brings you into all of this.” He stopped speaking and Draco took note in how close Harry was. Even though he himself was drunk, not as drunk as Harry, but drunk, he could feel it.
"Please what?" Harry was startled. He looked around the darkness around him in this new setting. There was a small window providing almost no light at all but after a moment he noticed a set of blonde hair sticking up.
It should have been the greatest feeling in the world to Harry Potter. Finally, it was over. Harry finally was free from the weight of the war. Free from the duties of being the savior. Free from the crazy man looking into his mind.
"I'll kill myself sleeping on that thing." Draco lifted his own bag onto the bed and turned it over. Clothes and books spilled out and mixed with Potter's.
The village saw a healthy dose of tourists in warm weather. Many stopped by to visit Cartmel Books, but Draco's shop also boasted a fiercely loyal customer base of locals.
It was an uncomfortably intimate image. But then, their closeness was borne out of necessity. There was nothing they could do about it except embrace it.
Customers came in and out. He might have waved or said hello and exchanged pleasantries with them. Perhaps some people bought things. He really couldn't remember. It was hard enough to remember to keep the pastry tray filled since his mind kept straying to the section of a Daily Prophet article he'd ripped out and brought with him to the shop that day, for reasons that were still unclear to him. When he was alone at the shop counter, which was often, he laid the article out and glared at the words, at the goofy expression of Harry Potter, who had decided that yesterday was a fine day to interrupt Draco's peace and patronise his establishment.
Draco turned his head and saw that Harry was already watching him. Could he see how desperate he felt?
"Potter." He tugged his sleeves and crossed his legs, and Potter just sat there and watched him expectantly. "I can sit here you know," he blurted.
The emptiness left by Potter's absence was pervasive and all-consuming. Happy memories always lured Draco further into the abyss of loneliness. Memories of a not-too-distant past, ones where he and Potter had shared meals and spoken easily with each other. There were a few instances where they'd talked long into the night, and the sound of Potter's laughter always lingered in Draco's ears, lulling him to sleep when he got home.
Draco couldn't take any more dates like Friday's. And lately, they had all been like that. A partner was a lot more trouble than it was worth right now.
Pansy chose to stand in solidarity with all their friends, which meant ostracising Draco from her life. One moment, they were exchanging letters and meeting for coffee or dessert somewhere. The next, his letters went unanswered, and she stopped showing up at their meeting spots. Almost all the Malfoys' friends had cut them off over the years.
He looked up at the sky, scanning until he found the familiar three stars that formed Orion's belt. The rest of the constellation came into focus, and he cocked his head. There it was - the harbinger of winter. Draco had said Orion was also called The Hunter, and that the stars depicted a figure bearing a sword and shield. To Harry though, it looked like a figure brandishing a wand in one hand and waving with the other.
At meal times, Potter was prone to rambling about work, or his boring friends and the tasteless activities they found entertaining. It was easy for Draco to tune him out. A nod here and there was often good enough to convince Potter he was listening.
He put the jar back, closed all the drawers. Boxes on the floor collected all the empty jars and vials.
He Apparated home and immediately set the kettle to boil, then tossed a piece of steak and kidney pie into the microwave.
after so many years? Draco cast about for words. "I - um. This. Well." Complete sentences. "I'm getting new coffee. Later. This week." Well, that was close.
Draco shrugged. He didn't want to say 'yes'. That would make it real. As real as something fake could be. If his parents could see him now.
Potter nodded, and Draco went to the kitchen, relieved. It was nice to have someone prepare tea for you, and he felt a secret thrill at knowing exactly how Potter took his.
He tried to take his time, but the old bat had a lot to say. Finally, at the sound of applause and cheering, he returned to his seat. Except Potter beckoned to him.
Robards' face knit together in confusion. "I hope you have compelling evidence, because if you're wrong—"
It was the first time Harry had ever seen him look so vulnerable, and his breath hitched in spite of himself.
Instead, at their request, Robards filed paperwork to sell it to Harry and Draco. A week later, they'd bought a car from some Muggle who was moving overseas.
The arms around him drifted up to gently grip his shoulders and pull him back a little. Draco placed his palms on Potter's chest and let his head loll back enough so that he was looking right into deep green eyes. He felt drunk.
But there was nothing there except for the tiny entryway with dusty framed prints hanging on the walls.
"We missed you this evening," Potter whispered after switching off the lamp on the bedside table that night.
"I reckon it was thunder, after all," Harry said. He hung his jacket and removed his shoes, then settled onto the sofa. "I think there's an episode of Midsomer Murders on tonight."
It was nice not to think for a while, and the fresh air helped to clear Draco's mind. It was almost as enjoyable as walking through the Manor grounds.
Draco gritted his teeth. They really had no business with these Muggles. This wasn't part of the job description. 'Keep Potter safe'—that was it.
He took a deep breath and went to the kitchen, where Potter and Dorothy were nattering on about pointless topics and putting the food away. The kettle was going, and Draco groaned inside at Potter's hospitality.
Potter was also much more tolerable whilst they cooked. He'd taught Draco a variety of basic skills and simple recipes. Food was a neutral topic of conversation, and to Draco's surprise, Potter wasn't half bad as an instructor.
"And you don't think I can find that out." Draco turned his eyes down at his bowl of beef stew and sulked.
He pulled away and sat up, breathing hard as he took in Draco's body splayed out before him, eyes lingering over the thin trail of hair that led to his straining erection. He placed his hands on Draco's thighs and pushed them apart, then settled himself down between them and ran his tongue up the length of Draco's cock.
In an attempt to avoid becoming a complete recluse, Draco made himself go on walks with Potter, where they were immediately assaulted by prying neighbours. They came at them from all sides and had an endless battery of questions. Draco reminded himself repeatedly that it would do no good to make enemies whilst here. Even though Muggles hardly registered as a threat, they could be extremely irritating.
There were times, of course, when Harry allowed the truth free rein in his conscious mind. Always at his discretion, in the shower, because there at least it was easy and almost natural to confuse tears with water droplets. It was easy to convince himself that
Because it was someone else who knew anonymous tips weren't truly anonymous. Someone who didn't want to get caught.
He let out a sigh of relief and leant into Harry, pressing their foreheads together. The living room was still a mess, but he didn't care. Now that Pierce was gone, it felt safe. It felt like home again.
Draco noticed that all the couples in the restaurant were no longer engrossed in each other. Their eyes were on him.
Draco crossed his arms. Every week, their conversations went in circles and ended up nowhere. Meanwhile, he'd been passed over for nearly every prestigious assignment that came through, and after six years, he still hadn't been promoted beyond the most junior rank of Auror.
Draco frowned. There must be something else Pierce wanted if he hadn't killed Harry yet. Or Draco, for that matter.
"Wonderful. Now, write down your address for me, and I'll get these potions." He tore off a piece of parchment and pushed it across the desk, along with a quill.
Draco didn't handle the heat well. Each day blended into the next, and it didn't help that every morning when he awoke, the pain in his back had spread.
"I can read." Draco slowed as they approached the large Burger King sign and turned into the car park. He was starving after an entire afternoon spent driving.
Draco placed Potter's hand over the bulge in his trousers and looked up. Behind his smile, Potter wore a plaintive expression, and Draco thought he understood. He needed a distraction.
"Sort of. I was cursed." Draco laced his hands together. Squeezed. "It was over four years ago, in Diagon Alley. Just after my family's trial had ended. Are you familiar with the Septicemia Curse?"
Once everyone at the table greeted her, she leant in and said, "The dancing's set to start up again in a few. I've asked Rosemary if she could say a few words in your honour first though, to commemorate your marriage."
It also made for cosy evenings, wrapped up in blankets and limbs as Harry and Draco discovered each other's bodies.
Draco stepped lightly alongside Harry through the forest and took in their surroundings as if seeing them for the first time. Colours seemed brighter, and the air seemed fresher. Even the cold grey sky had a sombre beauty about it that was easy to appreciate in the absence of constant threat.
Dangling in the air was, of course, the question of whether they would even have time to put it together. Harry wondered if they were both thinking the same thing. It wouldn't be prudent to fall apart just then, on an otherwise perfect day, but the tears were there, threatening to escape.
The fiddler and the accordion player picked up their instruments. "Hope you can waltz, boys!" one of them called, and they began playing.
Draco threw aside the blanket and went into the bedroom. He slid under the covers on one side of the bed, whilst Potter did the same on the opposite side.
At last, after three failed attempts, he found the tiny space on a shelf with the boxes he was looking for. There were only two, and they were old and covered in dust. That seemed like a good sign.
"Actually," Robards said, "I've chosen to spare you the letters I continue to receive demanding that I sack you." He paused to let the words sink in before continuing. "I also want to reiterate that professional conduct is essential. Do you know how many complaints your colleagues have lodged against you?"
"Want to make things easy for me and just give me the Apparition coordinates to your family home? I might even advise the Wizengamot to go easy on sentencing."
these feelings resulted from being forced together, that they were temporary. But they felt very real and very powerful.
Draco raised his head. He looked at Harry and ran a finger along the side of his face while he thought. Harry felt he could look into those shining grey eyes forever.
He grabbed hold of Draco's hips and began thrusting, slowly at first, until he found an angle that made Draco moan ceaselessly. It was incredible that any one person could make him feel this way, so complete and safe, and Draco couldn't get enough. He thrust back in time with Harry, encouraged by his moans of pleasure, and at one point Draco felt a hand reach around to grasp him.
Harry wasted no time in bringing out his new camera. He left Draco to finish his breakfast while he fetched it, and snapped a candid shot of him spooning cereal into his mouth.
Draco withdrew his wand and held it out in his shaky fist. He hoped he was ready for whatever was behind that door.
Draco felt the head of Harry's cock press against him, and he held his breath in anticipation whilst Harry inched inside.
Draco opened his mouth to say something, though he had no idea what. Truthfully, he didn't know. He realised he didn't know anything for certain.
"Excellent." Robards reached for a stack of parchment and began leafing through it. "This morning, Aurors Potter and Lawrence were investigating a case when an explosion went off." He looked Draco in the eye. "Auror Lawrence has, most unfortunately, been killed. Auror Potter survived."
"Nothing," he mumbled, then left as quickly as he dared whilst carrying a cup of coffee full to the brim.
Potter snorted and left to answer the door. By the time he returned, the delicious smell of chicken, ham, and vegetables permeated the kitchen, and Draco's stomach grumbled.
He pushed his pyjama bottoms down enough to expose his erection, then sat on the edge of the bathtub and wrapped a hand around himself. Something caught his eye though, and Draco realised it was his book on the countertop. He'd left it there last night after rushing to get out.
Robards quietened him with a dark look. "If it's someone in the Ministry, secrecy is of utmost importance. I know you're already involved. But you need to let MacDonald and Jennings do their work. Just keep your mind on Potter."
Draco couldn't help noticing how Potter did indeed seem to take his time to enjoy his ice cream, and he wondered whether he realised what he was doing to Draco. It was just one more thing to add to his list of grievances against Muggle clothes—they didn't conceal erections well.
"Why? They're just Muggles." He hated Potter telling him what to do. That alone was reason enough for Draco to consider doing the opposite.
"We can't have owls giving you away. Don't worry, you can come here once per week to collect your post."
Draco tried to swallow around the dry, spongy mass that had once been his tongue. He wasn't used to Potter being so close. "I guess anything." He didn't really know what was around.
Draco thought about how Potter ate his ice cream cone the other day. It was certainly tempting. But then another idea struck, and he said, "I don't want to sleep on the sofa any more."
Jeremy gave a toothy grin. "Well, you two have fun sorting that out," he said. "Maybe I'll see you this weekend."
Harry barely waited for Draco to unfold his arms before taking one long stride over to envelop him. He turned his face into Draco's hair and inhaled, and a faint scent of peaches flooded his senses. It was so subtle, and Harry felt inordinately delighted that nobody else would know what sort of shampoo Draco used unless they were
Draco finally registered that it was Harry yelling, not Pierce. He paused with his fist in mid-air. His entire body felt as though it were on fire, and Pierce stared up at him with a dazed look.
Draco scowled. He wondered if Potter was still standing at the end of the street, or if he was perhaps trying to follow behind and eavesdrop.
"Oh, yes." Draco crossed his arms. This felt good. "Shall I interrogate him, then? Would one of you be kind enough to fetch some Veritaserum?"
Draco decided to leave them there for now. He had breakfast, minus coffee. He turned on the Muggle tele-thing. He didn't really watch it very often. Usually just on holidays. It had come with the house, and he hadn't bothered to get rid of it.
"Be my guest," Potter said, indicating the dying flames. "It's starting to get a little chilly over here."
"What if I still want to be with you?" Potter finally asked. He sat up and took one of Draco's hands.
. Draco gave a resigned nod. He could never decide if this was good news. "But I'm not doing that great."
Fortunately, Draco's one-to-one with Robards wasn't until eleven, and it wasn't as though he had meetings with anyone else.
Draco scowled. "Potter is under my charge. It seems necessary that I know what the status of the investigation is, and if there's anything I can do to help."
Draco read late into the night, and when he crept into the bathroom to prepare for bed, he took a moment to look at Potter, who was a very chaotic sleeper. Every night when Draco passed through, Potter was flopped over in a different, sprawling position, and his mouth always hung open. If only the wizarding world could see their hero now.
He thought he heard Harry say something, but whichever part of Draco's brain processed speech had gone on holiday. He could only respond with a groan, but that seemed to be a good enough answer, because Harry added another finger, and another, and he began fucking Draco with them whilst continuing to suck his cock.
Potter at least had the decency to look apologetic. "That wasn't supposed to happen, but... look, they haven't been back." He ran a hand through his hair. "I know people. They were quick to put a stop to it. And I mean, nobody else from - er, back home - has been here, right?"
And so they donned their jumpers and jackets and stepped into the crisp evening air. Perhaps it was Draco's imagination, but the atmosphere felt distinctly unsettled. He reached for Harry's hand as they crunched through dead leaves that littered the empty path through the forest.
They broke apart, and everyone linked hands with people on either side and began dancing in a left-moving circle. They danced right when the caller shouted at them to move right.
"Now there's a happy couple," the caller said into the microphone. "Let's do another waltz with the rest of the crowd. Couple up and have fun! Then we'll change tunes."
Draco led them towards the dimly lit interview room with measured strides. MacDonald directed Pierce's floating body onto a wooden chair and cast a spell that affixed his bindings to it.
It was a good idea, and so Draco kicked off his shoes and went to lie on the bed. Potter followed and lay on the opposite end, turning on his side to face him.
"Constellation." He carded his fingers through Draco's hair, short and soft, and watched his eyes close in contentment.
"Wrong again. No wonder you've never been promoted," Pierce said. "Or is it because nobody is willing to trust a Death Eater? Or"—he paused to let a smile stretch across his face—"do you think it might be because certain Aurors in the department kept spreading misinformation about you to Robards?"
Robards shifted his glance from Draco to Harry. "I had Pierce fully recount the evening after you left. Potter, are you all right? Do you need to see a Healer?"
"I saw him skulking up the road yesterday evening." She took another sip of her coffee and said, "I knew he wasn't coming to see me."
"The bed is big enough for two," Draco pointed out, though his mind immediately went to all the times he'd walked through to the bathroom and seen Potter sprawled all over the entire bed.
After he finally regained his senses, Potter pulled Draco to lie down on him. He laced his fingers through Draco's short hair and kissed him.
"Yeah, he was. They'd just got married a few months earlier, so he took it pretty badly," Harry said. "That's why he took some time off afterwards."
When the clock struck eleven, Draco took the last sip from his cup of coffee and strode over to Robards' office.
Draco managed a weak smile in return. He needed time. He needed to think about this when he wasn't drunk off the feeling of Potter's hands on his. "Let me think about it."
Harry sighed, picked up the journal, and moved to sit in his favourite chair out in the secluded nook. He clutched the journal in his lap and stared out at the river for a long time. He couldn't say how long - the clock on the wall had died, and it was entirely too quiet.
Jeremy puffed a ring of smoke at him and smiled. "I'd avoid being in charge of catering if that's your aim."
Potter's hands ran down Draco's back, settling on the curve of his arse and giving it a squeeze. It was all the encouragement Draco needed. He buried his face in Potter's neck and rolled his hips to grind their cocks together. It was torture of the best kind, and as he rutted frantically against Potter, desperation for release built inside him. Draco looked into his green eyes, and Potter's raw expression of desire ignited an overwhelming need for more.
It was early, and the sight of Potter sleeping peacefully in the weak morning light did something to Draco. His heart clenched with some sort of horrible longing, and he remembered Potter kissing him last night.
He realised after some time that he knew exactly where he was. Back in school, he had come here once a year to celebrate Pansy's birthday with her family. She was a creature of habit, and as far as he knew, she continued to celebrate her birthday in the same upscale pub—The Wandmaker's Arms.
Draco pushed back onto Harry's cock, moaning at the exquisite sensation of being filled so completely.
Draco stood in his socks and underwear whilst he read through his resignation letter the next morning for the fifth or sixth time.
"I still think this has something to do with the case you and Lawrence were working on," Draco said. "I wonder if there's a link from your case to someone in the Ministry. That could explain everything."
Draco rolled his eyes and looked over the packages of Jaffa Cakes. He couldn't tell whether they were cakes or biscuits.
Potter continued. "You know we'll be returning, right? Just get one flavour now, and try another next time."
"I doubt it's Barclay," Draco said on a rainy Thursday afternoon. He lay on the sofa with his head in Harry's lap, occasionally popping a Chocolate Bourbon into his mouth to munch.
His heart nearly stopped when he saw Potter grinning up at him. It was a ridiculous, bashful grin, as though he'd been caught off guard.
"We, erm, eloped," Potter said. Draco could tell Potter felt just as panicked as he did. For once, it was not a comfort.
A hand snaked down his chest to cup his erection, and the next thing he knew, Draco slid to the floor on his knees, pushing Harry's legs apart.
Leaving sounded appealing. He no longer had any appetite, even though he had only taken a few bites of his dinner. Part of him wanted to stay though, if only to prove he was unshakeable to these people who didn't matter.
It occurred to Draco that he would very much enjoy watching him masturbate one day and filed that idea away for later. Potter's breaths grew shaky, and Draco kissed him again. His brow furrowed as he let out a groan, and his cock pulsed in Draco's fingers as he came over his stomach and chest.
Yeah, right. Draco rolled his eyes and left, taking long strides down the corridor. As he made his way through the cubicles on his way to Robards' office, an idea struck him. Of course—the Charmed Galleons. He'd alert Harry to go to their safe location.
"Did you ever touch yourself whilst looking at that card?" Harry asked. He brushed Draco's hair aside.
Draco found it exhausting. From what he had observed, Potter seemed to relish it. Worse, Potter seemed to weasel his way in with all the locals in record time. Even old Mr. Browning - the last of the village council to approve Draco's plan to open the bookshop - regularly exchanged more than two sentences with Potter. Nobody seemed immune to his charm.
Moments later, Potter jerked his hips upwards one last time, and he cried out as his own climax overtook him. Draco was glad he came first—he could focus on Potter's head thrown back into his pillow and the way he held onto Draco's thighs for dear life. Draco caressed the tops of Potter's hands and watched as he rode out his orgasm. It was gratifying and impressive to see how good he could make Potter feel.
Draco wrapped a hand around his erection again and began stroking at a measured pace, squeezing lightly around the head that poked out from his foreskin. He knew this wouldn't take long, but he didn't want it to be a utilitarian wank any more. Not with Potter smiling at him. He looked so bashful, as though he'd been caught doing something he shouldn't have been. It was quite an attractive smile after all, Draco had to admit.
Mostly, he was afraid that Potter would laugh and turn him away, and Draco hated admitting that to himself. Potter
It took a moment for Draco to register his words. He nodded and watched Potter undo and pull down his trousers and pants in one smooth motion. He was hard already.
Draco bought new boots in London after his December appointment at St. Mungo's. His Christmas gift from Whitby that year was a ban on caffeine, since it elevated his already-precarious heart rate. He made sure to buy the most expensive boots he could find from some Muggle shop. He had no desire to visit Diagon Alley. He hadn't been back since he'd been cursed.
"Being active helps clear my head. It helps me feel… Normal." Potter's voice had gone quiet. "It still hurts, you know. Losing Lawrence."
Draco looked as well. Foliage arrangements and colourful banners bearing the names of businesses that had sponsored the dance decorated the walls, and fairy lights were strung up all over, giving the place a soft, airy glow. The tables were adorned with sprigs of herbs and wildflowers, which carried the heady fragrance of late summer throughout the building.
Draco turned, scanning the crowd for a face he recognised, but there were so many people, and the sun shone in his eyes. He was in an uncharacteristically good mood.
"I don't think so," Pierce sneered. "I've spent long enough looking for him. Of course the last location on that list of safe houses would be the correct one."
This felt like a cruel joke, even if Robards insisted it wasn't. Protecting someone wasn't usually very exciting work, but if the client really was so important, this could make Draco look good.
"Make your own," Draco said, and he stepped around Pierce. "I don't know how Potter could ever work with you."
It wasn't how Draco imagined spending his Saturday. The hot bath he'd taken earlier seemed a long time ago.
"Oh, hullo," said Potter, who didn't look at all angry to have had his peace disturbed. In fact, he had the gall to smile.
Harry had apparently gotten completely immersed in writing then, because when he felt a tap on his shoulder, he gave a startled yelp. His pen clattered to the floor.
After a while, the caller announced the dancing would come to an end. "So let's close things out with another waltz, yeah?" And he signalled to the musicians behind him, who launched into an appropriate song.
Draco sat at his desk and glared at Pierce's Stunned, floating body whilst Potter called Robards. Within minutes, he heard footsteps coming towards them, and moments later, Robards' irritated face appeared in Draco's cubicle.
"Dammit, Malfoy!" He slammed his fist on his desk, and all the tiny instruments, picture frames, and figurines toppled over. "This is serious! This is exactly what I've been telling you—I'm willing to give you a chance, and this is how you act." When Draco remained quiet, Robards continued. "As I said, this has just come in. A high-profile client needs protection."
"You might want to think twice about that," Pierce said. "Who do you think Robards is going to believe if we get into a fight?"
Draco shook his head, or perhaps the pub was moving. "I'm never leaving whilst you're still… not leaving." Hmm. That didn't come out right.
. They were now both senior Aurors, two ranks above Draco. It was unthinkable that in six years, Potter had been promoted twice, whilst Draco continued to languish at the most junior level.
"Not hating someone isn't the same as liking them," Draco said. Potter, of all people, should know that.
He didn't know what he was so afraid of, now that he knew Harry wanted him, now that he stood here looking at Draco like that. The words were on his lips, but he bent to kiss Harry instead. It was easier to show Harry how he felt, and Draco tightened his hold to pull him closer. Harry's breath hitched, and Draco felt a cold hand cup his cheek as they broke away to look at each other.
Life as a Muggle turned out to be as bad as Draco feared. Although they were permitted to use magic at home, they didn't. Neither of them were good at cleaning spells, and there wasn't much need for magic otherwise. Muggle life was dull, and it was sobering to realise how limited they actually were.
Draco spoke with two other Ministry workers he suspected, but he soon realised his interrogation skills were lacking when both of them reacted the same way as Wimple had done.
Harry frowned. "I don't know. That seems odd. Why wouldn't he have come after me already? It's been almost two months. Hallowe'en is on Monday."
"Then we'll deal with it," Harry said. "It could also be some kids playing a prank or something. It is Hallowe'en, after all. The important thing is to stay calm."
"Heavens!" She threw her arms up. "We've got to do something. Every wedding deserves a celebration."
Situated along the main thoroughfare through the village, the squat bookshop stood between two restaurants and overlooked the River Eea. Rows of tall, walnut shelves crammed with books occupied the bulk of the shop. Mismatched, squashy armchairs populated various nooks where shelves wouldn't fit. A coat rack and a counter stood immediately to the left of the entrance. Next to the counter, there was a small table that always boasted a fresh pot of coffee and a tray of pastries. A stone fireplace stood in the back, warming a nook in the rear corner that offered a splendid view of the river.
Draco wondered if this was it. If this was the end of the routine he and Potter had established. That he'd come to look forward to - and apparently Potter had, as well. There was no other bookshop for Potter to haunt though, so where could he be?
Draco's mouth hung open. Was Robards in on this, too? He couldn't imagine why someone would be so unwilling to listen to the truth. Or did he hate Draco that much?
Harry helped Draco up and onto the sofa, then sat beside him and kissed him lightly. "That's better," he said. "Let's think. Did anything significant happen on the 2nd of September?"
It was late when Draco yawned and finally decided to get ready for bed. Just before turning the light out, he tucked Potter's face into his book and set it aside.
"Splendid," Emily said, clapping her hands together. "I'll bring round your tickets in a few days." She stood and smoothed her skirt. "I'd best be on my way, though. I told Philip I'd only be gone a few."
"So, how come you haven't been to any of the restaurants around here?" Potter asked. He'd decided to approach Draco as soon as he entered the shop the very next day.
Potter cut into his chicken so fiercely that his knife scraped against the plate and made a horrible, tinny sound. "It always has to be about you, doesn't it?"
Draco watched them disappear, then remembered himself and took out Potter's case file, setting it on the floor. With a wave of his wand, he cast, "
"I don't care. Both. Just fuck me, I want you," Draco blurted. He was too aroused to feel embarrassed about how much he wanted this any more.
Lawrence received an anonymous tip the day before the explosion about the case they were working on, and he and Potter had gone to the location specified in the tip. Only the supposed meeting they were going to spy on never took place. Someone had planted an explosive potion there instead. Someone who never intended for a clandestine meeting to take place.
"I'm sorry, all right?" Potter shifted closer to look him in the eye, and Draco decided he believed him. "I didn't realise how worried you'd be," Potter continued.
Potter made a beeline to a shop, and moments later, they stepped out carrying two large ice cream cones.
"God, oh god - I'm going to come," Draco cried, and the first spray of come to land on Harry's chest pushed him over the edge as well.
But since Draco had avoided saying anything at all to Potter, he had no idea what the Chosen One was even doing here, in
"Good, then you can help Mr Malfoy." Draco felt his face burn. "We have a lot to go over. Oh yes, one moment." Lister fished around in his pocket and brought two scrolls of parchment out. "Details of your assignment. I'll let you read these whilst I get a coffee, and then we'll begin. Do either of you want one?"
Harry sighed. "I don't want to believe it could be Pierce. And it's true, I don't think there's definitive proof. But it makes sense."
He tore the blanket away from himself, careful to leave Draco covered. He clung to Harry as always, soft blond hair tickling Harry’s nose with the faint scent of peaches.
A muted explosion sounded whilst Draco poured water into his mug, and his mouth dropped open at the sight of steak and kidney pie splattered all over the microwave. This was the last thing he needed. He made a mental note to file a complaint against Lister next week.
"Not ready? How many times have I told you that I need my coffee exactly at nine?" She looked angry, but the corners of her mouth struggled not to twitch upward.
"This one doesn't taste bad. It's just like drinking water, I promise. Let me go and get you some for the next month."
Some days, Draco would stare out the window, seething, willing Potter to show up. Others, he'd pretend to read and sat staring at the same page for the entire day.
"I orchestrated a break-in," Pierce said. "Whilst all you lot were busy dealing with that, I slipped into the Confidential Records Office and bribed old Wilcox." His face hardened. "Didn't expect he'd die and that you'd be auditing all the records, though."
"Lovely to meet you too, dear," Dorothy said, popping a bag of tea into each mug whilst Draco poured. "Don't worry about old Drinkwater. Never takes kindly to new people. Or most people, come to think of it."
Potter shook his head and stared off to the side, unfocussed. He seemed to be in a distant place in his mind. "Lawrence got a tip about our case the day before. There was to be a meeting at some place early the next morning. We went to spy, to see what we could learn and if the people at the meeting could lead us to a larger ring of criminals."
If only Potter hadn't fucked up the charm he'd cast on Draco's shoes to add extra cushioning. They felt stiff and unpadded, which made the entire walk miserable.
Each step towards the sofa felt heavy with anticipation. Draco sat down stiffly next to Harry. There was plenty of space between them, and he had to wonder if that was a bad sign.
Harry was astonished at the sight that met him. He had to pause in the middle of removing his shoes to look around and take everything in.
Draco shut the door and sat next to Harry. "I'm fine. Maybe." He shook his head. "I don't know. Robards doesn't think—" He turned to look at Harry. "It's Pierce. Pierce is after you."
"That's not what I meant." Potter made a face. A stupid one. "You just look ill, that's all. I'm worried about you."
"You'll get thrown in Azkaban, you git. Get his wand and Stun him. We'll take him to the Ministry and let them deal with him."
If Potter was trying to make up for his colossal fuck-up, Draco was going to accept it. For now. He'd tear into Potter once he felt better.
No. He decided he'd buy one the next day - the day before Draco's birthday. He had to go shopping for his gift anyhow.
Since he could no longer travel by Floo or Apparition, Draco was stuck taking the train back home that day. He didn't mind though. Sunday afternoon didn't seem to be a terribly busy time, and he had an entire compartment to himself. He sat watching the landscape change, fingering the portkey in his pocket. He wondered how much longer he had left. He wondered if he would actually use the portkey, if it came to that.
“Our boy’s growing up fast Remus,” Sirius said, shaking his head. “I miss when he was a toddler and we were the two most important men in the world.”
He felt a hand on his shoulder, and still did not look up. “Being an Omega is both a terrific thing, as well as a terribly dreadful thing at times,” Mrs. Malfoy sighed. “I was lucky, I found my husband early. We dated through Hogwarts and were married as soon as we graduated. Others had to search high and low for their Alphas, some even resorting to settling for a Beta. I don’t know what it means exactly, but if your relationship heads that way, I don’t see any reason to stop it.”
“Ohh,” Harry nodded but frowned. “But how do I know that Draco and I were made for each other? I can’t give him my purity, so what worth—”
“Potter, for tomorrow you will review your Charms and Transfiguration textbooks,” the Dark Lord commanded. “I will not accept any mistakes tomorrow. Understand?”
“No!” Draco yelled. He pulled his fist back and stepped away from the werewolf. “I am a Malfoy!” He yelled, “I will not be a pawn.”
Remus hummed but allowed himself a smile. He glanced down at his stomach and looked up at Mr. Riddle. “I’ve been thinking, Tom, about names. If our baby is a boy, I want to name him after our other loves, keep their memory alive. We don’t have to if you don’t want to, but if it’s a boy, I want to name him Sirius Adrian.”
Harry’s mind kept on Draco as he worked. Thoughts and scenarios of how their lives would be as mated Alpha and Omega. Would they live here, in Malfoy Manor, or find their own home? How soon would it be until Harry was pregnant with their children? How many children does Draco even want? Harry himself wants as many as he can properly take care of or at least five. Or maybe six as an even split, three boys and three girls. It was a longtime fantasy of Harry’s. Living peacefully surrounded by his children. He would be reading to them, chasing them, or teaching them how to play Quidditch. Maybe one of their younger ones would be tugging at Draco to get him to do something demeaning like giving a piggyback ride or, god help him, change a diaper! The thought of Draco Malfoy changing a baby’s diaper was so ludicrous that Harry laughed out loud.
“Hiding? Pansy Parkinson, we are not hiding anything,” Harry said, giving her a sly smile. “Draco and I are dating, and, god willing, we will marry with the submissive clause once we’re both of age. We started dating just as this train was heading away from Hogwarts.”
Deep in the forest, where the trees became elders, and their whispers are the loudest; where light is all but snuffed out by the knotted branches and it’s leaves, lies a clearing. A clearing that had a regal presence to it, though there is no castle nor throne there, just a stump.
However, as they started to make their way back to the castle to prepare for the Third Task, Niall and Harry were surprised to see their godfathers at the castle’s entrance. Behind them, was Professor Dumbledore along with a man in a bowler hat whose face was very red and a couple of Aurors. “Harry! Niall!” Sirius said when he and Remus caught up to them. The men immediately brought their boys into a tight hug. “What are you two doing here? Are you hurt? Why aren’t you at school? What did Dumbledore say?” Sirius asked frantically.
"How should I know?" He scanned the menu items and frowned at the Muggles staring at them from behind the counter. "I'm going to sit down. Just pick something for me."
After the walk, they all ate dinner at the pub. Harry's words kept playing through Draco's mind, and he pressed his leg against Harry's as they devoured their food. The sun had set by the time they arrived back at their tiny cottage. It was a clear night. The moon hung heavy and full, and the pleasant chill from earlier that day had developed an ominous bite, so it was a relief to shut the door against the night.
Draco rolled his eyes. He stood leaning against the wall, as far away from Pierce as possible. "Tell them," he said. "Tell them what you intended to do tonight."
Potter clasped his hands together and looked Draco in the eye. "Look, I care about you. I mean, really care about you. I - I don't know if you've noticed..."
"Yes," Draco said. "That would certainly explain why the Daily Prophet followed you here on your first visit."
Potter's Invisibility Cloak was something different, something incredible. Draco rubbed the silvery material between his fingers. It was unlike anything he'd felt before.
Draco flashed him a mischievous grin. He rolled onto his stomach and got to his hands and knees, then squeezed a good amount of lube onto his fingers. He glanced over his shoulder, smirking at how raptly Harry stared at him, then reached behind to touch himself. It was awkward at first, but Harry began rubbing his legs, and it was easy to let go after that.
." Draco winced, shutting his eyes against Potter's desperation. "I said no, okay? How many times do I need to say it?"
It was more hopeful than accurate, but it was the most diplomatic response he could think of. He didn't want to invite questions.
Even now, only a few months later, there was a marked difference in Draco's appearance when compared to the photo. Now his skin was tinged slightly grey, and he looked exhausted all the time. And that was on a good day.
Merlin, all these years and the man had never learnt how to deliver bad news. It was almost comical. Draco rolled his eyes.
He didn't remember setting his book aside or turning off the lamp, but when he awoke the next morning, someone had.
Draco's stomach churned—he loathed travelling by Portkey—but he forced his eyes open and looked up to see Potter scowling at him.
Draco picked up the stack of blankets from the counter and placed them underneath. "You forgot your blanket today."
Draco held out a hand, and Whitby clasped it in both of his to give one firm shake before he stood to leave.
For better or for worse, his depression had left him a bit lax when it came to security measures, and Hermione and Ron eventually found him in 12 Grimmauld Place.
Inside, everything was exactly as he remembered, from the hideous pink walls in the living room to the garish appliances in the kitchen and the dead plants in the disused conservatory. He set down one of their bags in the bedroom, where they'd spent many hours in each other's arms, oblivious to the rest of the world.
Draco dreaded going into the office all next week. He couldn't bear the thought of being trapped in that dark, soul-crushing room, performing the same task over and over, with no end in sight and only Barclay to talk to.
There was blissful silence for much of the morning. Draco sat behind the counter and read, occasionally nodding or waving at the handful of customers that came in and out. It was a pleasant, normal day, and when Potter walked in mid-afternoon, it was still a pleasant, normal day, because he was no longer a poisonous intrusion in Draco's life.
He was too far gone at that point. So in love that to stop things now would almost feel worse than what was to come. He knew that if he left Draco, he would never be able to live with himself. And he had a lot longer to go.
Potter gave a small smile, then went to the bathroom. Draco flopped onto his back and shut his eyes. At least the world had stopped spinning.
"Not yet. I was sent to help Barclay straight away last week. Not really sure who to talk to, either."
For a moment, Draco considered giving up and going home. There was no way to explain himself if he was caught. Probably, Robards wouldn't wait until Potter's case had been closed, and he'd remove Draco as Potter's watchdog and sack him straight away.
And that did Draco in. He had to tell Potter. He had to give him a way out. He couldn't bear the thought of hurting him.
He kept trying not to pay attention to Potter whenever they ate, sat on the sofa together, cooked, or went out to do the shopping or go on a walk.
Draco reached to cradle Harry's head with a hand. "Listen to me," he said softly. "I'll understand if you want to stop this - stop seeing me. If you want to spare yourself from having to be with me when it happens. I could never hold it against you."
They spoke of Draco's health only sparingly. Harry knew Draco would answer any of his questions. The problem was that Harry was too afraid to hear the answers. It had been enough when, after their first night together, Draco had explained the next evening how his body was in no fit condition to Floo or Apparate any longer, nor had it been for over a year. Harry, feeling a little selfish as he clutched Draco's hands, asked if he was still fit enough to have sex. When Draco said yes, that had been the end of the conversation, and their clothes.
He always had his curtains drawn closed in London, but here, like at the Manor, he kept them drawn aside to let starlight flood the room. He held his hands up and stared at them.
"You don't look sorry." But there was a glint in Harry's eyes. "Is there something I can do to help?"
A rapping sound at the front door made them freeze, and the sudden breeze made Draco realise the windows were open. Fantastic.
Draco could only stare, dazed, as he felt his heartbeat slow. Potter's pupils were large and dark, and his mouth was pink and swollen. Draco felt utterly spent, yet he'd never wanted him more. He pulled Potter onto the sofa and sank between his knees.
"Well, so what?" said Harry. He picked up his own clothes from last night and threw them into the bedroom. "Just Floo home." He waved his hand at the fireplace.
"You are unbelievably selfish. You think it's easy for me here? I haven't stolen away to have secret meetings with mates. I've been bloody honest with you about everything since we got here!" Well, almost everything. He pressed his fingers to his temples. "God, my head is killing me. This is all your fault."
Harry shrugged. "Just felt like it," he said, and a sudden thought occurred to him as they were about to turn towards his cottage.
The cold hardly seemed to matter with how tightly they clung to each other. Harry's tongue found its way into Draco's mouth, and a small moan escaped Draco. He wished they were home so he could take Harry to bed.
It was an unassuming little house composed of bright red bricks and surrounded by an overgrown garden. All the other homes looked remarkably similar. Muggles had no imagination.
Most nights were spent laying awake until absurd hours hating the sofa and staring at the ceiling until exhaustion overtook him. Now and then, he could hear the bed frame creak when Potter shifted.
He and Harry had made memories here. They'd always remember them, even if the Muggles here wouldn't.
Draco scowled. Leave it to Potter to bring up trivial things such as rules and regulations when it suited him.
"Some random Muggle isn't going to know how to steer us in the right direction. Best to just avoid them."
Draco's home was barren. It was completely devoid of any sort of personal touches. There were no photos, trinkets, or keepsakes of any sort. There was no artwork on the plain-coloured walls. A single blue rug lay in the middle of the living room. All the furniture was black.
Whitby left him to lean against the door while he picked up the keys. He nudged Draco to the side a little so he could lock the door.
Draco took a deep breath. It was difficult, with Potter looking at him like that, straight into his soul. "Maybe - can we sit down somewhere?"
When he wasn't with Draco, pretending time didn't exist, he worked on his book, or wrote in his journal. And now that it was warm again, he began spending more time in his garden. He'd forgotten nearly everything from Herbology, and his knowledge concerning non-magical plants didn't amount to much either. Still, gardening seemed to be an integral part of owning a cottage, and Mrs. Wilder had encouraged him to give it a go when he'd first moved in.
"A month! Goodness, I remember what that was like," Emily mused, and a wistful smile spread across her face. "Don't be shy now—I want to see your wedding photos." She glanced around the room as though to see if any were hanging on the walls.
Draco watched him put his jacket on and step outside. He watched until Potter had disappeared from view entirely before he made his way to the store room. He sat for a moment before lining up potion bottles and uncorking them. What was wrong with him? He frowned. It was foolish to be making attempts to salvage this friendship. Not when he'd let all others whither away into nothing. Potter wasn't special.
"Not… Recently." Before Potter could accuse him of lying, Draco said, "What are you going to do once we return?"
Draco ignored him and flipped to the back of the access book. Sure enough, there were entries for everything: names, dates, the time, the type of record accessed, and a column for notes. Many entries with Barclay's name littered the back pages, and 'AUDIT' was stamped in all the notes columns.
Although the hike was significantly less painful than last time, Draco wasn't the outdoorsman that Harry was, and his muscles ached. He sat at the kitchen table and rubbed his hands over his legs whilst Harry brewed tea.
Draco took a deep breath, wondering how much he would regret this. "It's important I keep to my schedule. If you can wait after I close, then -"
"Something to drink?" Harry offered when they'd removed their shoes and hung their coats and scarves.
Rain continued to pour outside, but the cottage was cosy and warm, and the air was heavy with the heady smell of sex. Draco felt drunk from the intimacy, which reminded him that this was probably a bad idea.
Robards groaned. "Why do you always insist upon quarrelling with me? Those are only guidelines. And I set those guidelines."
Draco's curiosity got the better of him on Thursday afternoon when Potter went out, and he began tinkering with the Muggle appliances. Potter seemed to enjoy watching the tele-thing, but Draco couldn't make it work no matter what he did. Surely there had to be
"That's ridiculous, and you know it!" Draco shouted. "It's been years since the war, and everyone knows I'm an Auror! Nobody's petitioned to have me removed."
Draco flipped open a large book sitting on the desk. It was an access book, containing logs of everyone who had entered and left.
Robards bent down to pull a thick stack of parchment from his desk drawer and waved it in the air. "This many."
Draco remembered Jeremy. Potter already insisted on wandering the countryside with Muggles and taking time getting to know them. Now he wanted to play their silly pub games, too?
A tall, gangly wizard in orange robes strode in. He had a weak chin and scraggly grey hair, and his eyes were fixed on a long sheet of parchment held in front of him.
Potter now. It was impossible to make that claim. Not when he dined and laughed together with him most nights of the week. Not when he welcomed and thanked Potter for his help cleaning the shop each evening. Not when he realised he liked the way 'Draco' sounded coming out of his mouth, which always turned up slightly as the last syllable escaped.
"Friendly place," said Potter, who looked like he was struggling not to laugh. Draco hated him for looking so relaxed. So healthy. Like he'd really taken care of himself over the last three years.
Draco stared into his eyes, trying to gauge how truthful he was being. He'd never learnt Legilimency though, and he never trusted anyone these days, so it was difficult. How much did he want to trust Potter? Now that was interesting to consider. He thought back to the day they'd first arrived at Hogwarts, when he'd offered Potter his hand, only to be rejected. Somehow, this felt like a second opportunity, only it felt like Potter was the one extending his hand this time. It felt good.
After a few minutes, he put the empty jar into a box with other empty jars, wiped his face with a hand towel, and made sure to lock all the drawers.
But it was difficult to avoid the fact that he'd wanked to Potter's photo. Especially when he started doing it every day.
"I was going to take my time torturing Potter. I wanted him to suffer like Lucy had. Then I was going to take my time to make sure he died a slow death."
"But it makes sense," Draco said. He was determined to get to the bottom of this. "Either someone bribed you, or—"
Draco thought back to earlier that afternoon when she'd told him to fuck off. "We've exchanged words."
He made a note to criticise Potter later and threw the stack of post at him, then sat on the opposite end of the sofa to read the summary from Jennings. The ink was still shiny.
He continued to sit and scratch at the paper as daylight faded until warm hands wrapped around his shoulders.
And look how that had turned out. Potter cared about him. Potter, who always seemed ready with a smile, who didn't hold back when Draco made him laugh.
Draco pushed his trousers and pants off and neatly placed his shirt at the end of the bed. Harry threw his clothes onto the floor with everything else.
Draco looked over his shoulder and saw Potter standing behind him. He held a Chocolate Frog in his hand and set it on the table.
"Yeah," Harry said. He reached under the covers for Draco's hand and placed it on his erection. "I'm feeling much better today."
"I've been coming here everyday for almost two weeks," said Potter, and he leaned one arm on the counter.
"No thank you," she said, and she leaned back on the wall next to the coffee pot, watching it. "You know, I may be old, but I can't remember a time when you've been late to open," she said when he returned.
wrong," Draco said. "I've just found evidence that Pierce tampered with the Ministry safe house files at the beginning of September."
"You owe me," Barclay said. "Once you come back, you owe me. Robards has got me auditing the departmental budget reports."
Draco continued to stare as Harry entered the shop, hung his coat and scarf, and walked over to the counter.
When his entire face felt numb, Harry closed the window. He didn't want to eat breakfast, didn't want to go into the kitchen, but it had been a long time since he had eaten. In fact, he couldn't remember his last meal.
"I'm going walking in the morning," Harry continued. "Why don't you come with me?" He gave a sheepish grin. "I promise it won't be as miserable as last time."
Of course, there was no doubting the prestige of the assignment. It probably wouldn't take very long to find the culprit either—everyone still leapt at the slightest hint of danger towards Potter, even though he was more than capable of protecting himself.
After a three-day heat wave at the beginning of the next week, temperatures fell to a level more seasonally appropriate for early September. Potter went outside nearly every day to go on a walk or run. He began inviting Draco to accompany him, but Draco refused.
"Would you actually tell me if you weren't?" Harry placed the handful of pieces onto the coffee table, right side up, and joined Draco in flipping all the other pieces over.
Draco squinted and frowned at the wooden cabinets, a threadbare rug on the floor, and a rickety table and chairs.
Potter squirmed and thrust against Draco, eliciting a groan from both of them. This was so much better without all those damn clothes in the way, but he needed more. He needed to have his hands on Potter. All over Potter.
He wrinkled his nose at the stale air inside and tried to remember what Lister had said about lights. Something about the wall.
Draco was restless in the empty cottage, though. He had learnt how to manipulate the telly now, so he spent the afternoon clicking through all the channels. Despite the variety in programming, nothing held his interest.
Friday was busy. Harry had to rush to meet with Rosemary about a last-minute situation that arose with the caterers, and he was gone all afternoon. When he returned home, he was exhausted and in a poor mood, so they ordered takeaway pizza for dinner and watched Midsomer Murders before going to bed early.
Draco picked at his food, which was no longer hot. The noise level in the pub grew louder as more people filed in, and almost all the tables were full.
"Well, we have to keep up appearances." Someone else would have sat down eventually, Draco reasoned. At least he was used to eating with Potter.
The dizzy spell had passed, and Draco looked around. They were in a tiny, windowless room with no furniture in it. The air was stale, and the faded floral wallpaper had seen better days. He walked towards the door.
Despite his best efforts, he'd gotten to know a number of them. But this turned out to be useful when he opened a bookshop a year ago. He had a guaranteed pool of customers right from the start. Not that there were other bookshops in Cartmel.
"Oh." He didn't particularly want to get lunch with Barclay, but he was one of the few people who didn't mind eating with Draco. "All right then. I suppose."
They stared at each other. Harry couldn't make out his expression. Draco was always so bloody impossible to read. He felt his own eyes go wide, and his cheeks heated when someone bumped into him on accident.
"I need a nap," he announced to the cottage, but Potter wasn't there to take pity on him. Draco had forgotten he was meeting with Rosemary. Something about the catering preparations had fallen through. Already.
Draco's cries were getting desperate, and Harry felt his cock stiffen just a little bit more against his tongue, felt the first spurt of come hit the back of his throat.
The Muggle leading them, a fit bloke named Mark, chose a particularly breathtaking path, treating them all to a picturesque display of fiery brilliance at almost every turn through the forest.
The chaos carried over to Level Two as well. Barclay nearly collided with him as he stepped out of the lift.
And here he was, still a junior Auror and getting ditched in the middle of dinner by prats like Lewis Edgecombe.
Draco saw Robards coming towards them with a stern look on his face. "Sir," he said, but Robards ignored him and instead held a hand out to quieten everyone.
After a few minutes of deep breaths, Draco began to feel better. He looked down at Whitby and saw the resigned look on his face.
For some godforsaken reason though, he had chosen to bequeath his cottage to Harry. As though it made sense for anyone to own two homes in the same village, on completely opposite sides. Just what was he supposed to do with
Potter was happy to oblige. He took Draco's cock into his mouth again and began caressing his balls with his free hand. Jolts of pleasure coursed through Draco, and he couldn't help bucking his hips slightly.
Potter took his time unpacking, and Draco watched to make sure he didn't take more than half of the wardrobe space.
Draco picked up the stack and placed it on a shelf beneath the counter, out of sight from nosy visitors. "Now you know."
If he had to pick a word for it, it would be 'friendship'. But it was so unlike any of his other friendships.
Someone making dinner for him was nice, he decided. It felt warm and comforting. It was a lot different from when a house-elf cooked for him.
"You really need to stop doing that." Draco winced, swallowing thickly. "You're going to make me sick one day."
As soon as Pierce's body froze, Draco hurried to undo the restraints around Harry's wrists and ankles. It hurt to see the raw skin underneath, and for a moment he knelt over Harry, taking in his appearance.
Draco removed his shoes as well and placed them next to Harry's so they made a tidy row. "All right."
"Ouch, watch where you're going!" Draco yelled as someone knocked into him. He rubbed his shoulder and headed towards the lifts. Fridays were supposed to be relaxed.
He sat at the counter day after day, slowly making his way through each book. He hadn't been so engrossed in a subject in quite a while. But it still wasn't enough to distract him completely from the fact that Potter had remained conspicuously absent from his shop for the last several weeks.
"You didn't pack your things," he said, while Potter removed and opened several cartons and handed him a plate and utensils.
This was a side of Robards Draco had never seen before. He thought about his resignation letter, which still lay tucked away in the wardrobe under a stack of clothes.
She hadn't invited him in years. After the war, the Malfoys were exonerated at their trial, but it came at a heavy price—Draco's father had given up the names of several Death Eaters, many of whom had been family friends at one point.
He didn't understand why this bothered him so much, whilst Potter didn't seem fussed about anything.
"You should've mentioned it to me first," Draco said, though he felt silly. It wasn't as though Potter had a lot to do here. Draco just didn't want him out of sight for too long.
Harry screwed up his face in thought. "Three. I started with Winstanley, but he resigned after a year due to injury. Then I was with Pierce for three years. And then Lawrence. Not sure who they'll partner me with once we return."
"I need to keep moving," Potter said, stepping over a log. "If I stay still, I start thinking about it too much."
Draco sat in the tiny chair in front of his desk. The office was tiny, and its walls were lined with shelves that were crammed full of files, boxes, and books.
The silence stretched out for a long time. Finally, Potter said, "There was a time when you'd laugh at me if I struggled with something."
That evening, their table won. It was largely thanks to Bill and Barbara, who maintained a wealth of knowledge that seemed pertinent to pub quizzes. Draco was impressed against his will and had to admit they weren't such poor company, either—they laughed easily and were laid back.
Whatever Robards believed, it was wrong. It wasn't worth it to waste more time trying to convince a man who didn't want to see the truth.
"I've been thinking about something." Draco set his glass on the bedside table. "Ever since the ceilidh."
Draco made the short walk from his cottage to his bookshop, where he unlocked the door and brewed the first pot of coffee that morning. After a long winter, warm weather seemed like it was finally here to stay, for a while at least.
Harry swallowed. He wondered if that was still true, if Draco still couldn't stop thinking about him, now that they had talked, now that everything had been laid out on the table. He began taking slow steps to avoid looking like a complete lunatic standing out there in the snow. Maybe it wouldn't matter. He only ever sat in that nook in the back anyhow. Surely that wouldn't be a bother?
Browning, never one for much chatter, hung his coat on the rack by the door, poured himself a cup of coffee, and disappeared among the shelves.
Whitby took it and began flipping through the previous month's notes Draco had kept. He paused on a page and nodded. "Yes, all right," he said to himself, then flipped a few more pages. "So, we can increase your dosage of this one as long as we no longer increase that one." With one hand, he clamped the book shut and handed it back.
Harry blinked once, twice, a dozen times, trying to keep the hot tears from forcing their way out. He pulled back and looked at Draco, took in everything about him. "I don't want to stop."
It only took a few strokes, and Draco started trembling again. "I'm coming," he cried, and he squeezed his eyes shut as his orgasm rendered him a panting, babbling mess. Harry continued driving into him, though it wasn't long before his breathing became more ragged. He bent forwards and hugged Draco to him as he came with one last thrust.
"What? You've been here... how long? And you haven't tried any of the restaurants?" Potter looked incredulous.
Draco felt his mouth clench. He took several deep breaths, but they did nothing to calm him. He thought about his poisoned blood pumping through every part of his body. "How long do I have," he said flatly.
"Well, doesn't that just figure," Mrs. Wilder said, shaking her head. "That boy holds everyone at arm's length. Even when romance comes smacking him in the face, he won't just accept it."
"Plenty of people at the Ministry can easily find out what cases we're working on at any given moment," Potter said. "Unless it's a classified thing like this."
As soon as the staff meeting ended, Draco stormed back to his desk. He snatched his quill and a small stack of forms and letters waiting in his in-tray and set to work.
In the next minute, Draco felt the uncomfortable sensation of being jerked forwards. He shut his eyes as his feet lifted off the ground and a force pulled him around his navel.
Draco grabbed a handful of custard creams and a glass of lemonade, then made a beeline for the nearest empty table.
"Draco." As he leaned his arms on the counter, he realised he had nothing to say. Not that it mattered. His mouth had gone completely dry. Up close, the delicate cable knit of Draco's jumper caught his eye.
Draco wrinkled his nose at the worn-looking grey shirt and black shorts he wore. He waited until Potter shut the door and got out of bed to put clothes on.
"Bring my bag," he barked, and without giving Potter a chance to protest, he walked towards the house. The walkway was lined with patches of lavender, and a tall rose bush had overgrown so much that he had to step around it to reach the front door. This place could use a gardener.
Draco sat in the back of the crowd, hoping nobody would notice him or give him dirty looks when the obvious Death Eater implications were brought up.
"No," Draco said. He shut the door and walked up to Robards' desk. "I know who wants to kill H—Potter."
a bloody Death Eater! Did you agree to this date just to ambush me?" He tried to remember what Lewis did for a living. Was he a reporter?
Robards nodded. "I apologise that both your lives were in danger tonight," he said. "However, you remembered your training and conducted yourselves admirably. And most importantly, you subdued your attacker. I believe we have a solid case against him. He'll be in Azkaban for a long time." He laced his fingers together on top of his desk.
Draco knew Harry was only trying to appease him, but it was something. He could appreciate the effort. Harry would see. Draco felt with absolute certainty that it was Pierce.
He didn't think it would escalate beyond a few words. And he certainly didn't think anyone so old and frail-looking could be so strong.
It was hot that day, and the blistering temperatures didn't relent for the entire week. Nights were uncomfortable as well, for the air was still and damp.
Draco looked at his face, trying to discern anything from his expression, but Potter only looked confused. "MacDonald had some residue from the explosive analysed. There was a high concentration of Venomous Tentacula seeds, which—"
"I'll just have a look around," Whitby murmured once inside the shop. He disappeared among the shelves without waiting for a response.
Her eyes flitted between the two of them when Draco took a seat on the sofa. "Now tell me, how did the two of you meet?"
Draco read the log entry and decided that was enough. There was no need to mention the alcohol, or the drunken groping.
