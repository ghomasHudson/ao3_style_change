Harry laughs and tucks his chin over Draco’s head. They’re curled into each other like seashells collected on a beach and clasped tightly in someone’s hand, not quite perfectly aligned, but connected just the same.
“Of course he—That’s not what I’m saying!” Scorpius snaps, removing his arm from Draco’s grasp. He pushes back from the table and runs his shaking hands through his overlong hair, the strands just a shade darker than Draco’s own. Draco watches as he walks to the drinks cart and grabs a bottle before returning to the table and taking a swig directly from it without the slightest hesitation.
Harry, who hasn’t heard Luna raise her voice for any reason in close to a decade, jolts from his relaxed position on the couch and promptly trips and falls headlong over the coffee table.
“But Draco was always so vain.” Hermione’s voice is strained as she speaks and Luna knows she doesn’t mean to sound cruel. “Why would he scar his own face?”
“Inside me,” he gasps, needing to be filled.
“Five years.”
“Good morning, Harry. And please, it’s Narcissa. Is my son here?”
Cameron turns around and squeezes Harry’s fingers in both hands, adamant. “Please, let me photograph you.” He steps back to pull out a Muggle camera from the bag at his hip.
Draco says without conscious thought. He can never think when Harry is this close, it’s infuriating.
Draco blinks hard at these words, the amount of new information an assault to his already spinning equilibrium. “Teddy is practically Harry’s son. He adores him.”
“Mrs Malfoy,” he says, stunned.
were doing,” Harry sighs, both hands now coming to collect Draco’s hair into a loop around one fist. Draco’s eyes close at the implication, the heavy weight of Draco’s cock hardening against the soft skin of his inner thigh; he loves having his hair played with and pulled. As if reading Draco’s mind Harry gives an experimental tug, sending a shiver down Draco’s spine. He whimpers and nuzzles lower towards the thick, dark head of Harry’s erection, the tip a glistening tease peeking out of its foreskin.
Chi disprezza compra - a saying that means 'one who hates, loves in reality' . . . and isn't that just Drarry in a nutshell?
“Not really. I’ve lived a nightmare. I close my eyes and my brain likes to . . .  remind me.”
Harry clears his throat. “I think that's really my decision to make, Draco.” He watches Draco flinch at the use of his given name and smiles. Throwing Draco Malfoy off his game has never once gotten old in the thirteen years he’s known him.
“Don’t you ‘
“Your hand,” he said, quiet . . . hesitant.
did he know so much? Granted, their falling out at the end of one mutually awkward yet healing (and hormonal) final year at Hogwarts after the war was always inevitable, but Harry had never once considered that Malfoy would willingly ingrate himself into Muggle society, and yet—
“I hadn’t noticed.”
“Can I—“ Harry begins to ask but Draco cuts him off with a, “
Hermione nods, her hands held up in a placating manner. “Yes. I know that. But you need to calm down Harry, or you might just make the building collapse on top of us.”
were abandoned and relegated instead to the pages of dry tomes never to be studied again.”
Eyes flashing with heat, all semblance of humour gone, Harry shifts further up Draco’s body, placing his knees on either side of Draco’s head on the pillows, one arm moving to brace against the wall, the other cupping the back of Draco’s neck.
“He’s scared.”
Hermione could kill Harry, she really could. He’s always been a bit of an idiot, but it’s truly shocking to realise just how much of a daft prick he can actually be, considering the man brought down Voldemort at seventeen. Why on earth would he ever let Draco get that close to him? Turning that line of questioning on herself, she wonders why she and Luna ever thought leaving them alone together was advisable? The answer seems obvious enough, considering Harry can usually handle things, and Draco’s little flight of fancy earlier hadn’t ended in bloodshed. She curses her own idiocy at letting this happen as she runs towards Harry’s fallen form on the rocks, wet hair slapping against her shoulders and bare feet stinging from the harsh pavement. Draco’s a cowering mass of feathers and limbs just beside him and she ignores him in favour of assessing Harry’s wound.
If Draco has been waiting for years, it feels as if Harry has been waiting for centuries. He thinks back to mourning the loss of never having the chance to be with Draco before his death. And now, here Draco stands, solid and perfect; his wings unfurled wide at his back, head tossed skyward as he crows. Harry squeezes his hips, encouraging the pace of Draco’s thrusts as he takes him deep, needing Draco to fuck Harry’s mouth with all the abandon Harry currently feels. He can sense it mirrored in Draco. It echoes between them, tingling just under their skin.
(See the end of the chapter for

is not a festival of addicts, Ron.”
But then, one thought occurs to him. Harry looks up. “Why didn’t you let me kiss you?”
Harry scoffs and then fixes Xenophilius with his narrowed, verdant gaze. Luna sees the matched look of self-righteous anger mirrored on Draco’s face behind him and, despite everything, she smiles at how matched they are at that moment: a perfect tempestuous pair.
Harry smiles as Draco plucks the box out of his hands and holds it to his chest, long fingers curling around the edges like talons sinking into a fresh kill.
“I freed you from your inhibitions, Harry. Don’t act like you weren’t begging for it.”
Biting the pillow, Draco nods, unable to speak. He’ll agree to anything as long as Harry keeps lavishing him with affection and praise. He thrusts into Harry’s fist, wanting to come so badly he feels tears at the corners of his eyes. He keens when Harry replaces his thumb with his tongue once more.
“You spoil me.”
“It’s the earth,” Luna says, reading his mind.
“It’s mine.”

Harry turns away, awed and feeling conflicted at now finding himself in the strange position of being attracted to all three of the inhabitants of the flat behind him.
“What’s perfect? Your spiral into insanity?”
Harry nods, standing and shuffling out of the pew. “Fine. Thank you. I mean,
“Maman is dead.”
and the public easily went along with that story. The
Hermione drops her hand from her mouth, a look of awe on her face. Then confusion. “But, how does Draco—“
“Call-me-Harry,” he mumbles before barreling on, “when were you going to tell me you stole my watch in fifth year?”
Xenophilius spins ‘round, eyes narrowing on Harry in disbelief. “The wards wouldn’t fail like that.”
Scorpius enters the room, and approaches the fire, long legs folding as he seats himself on the hearth rug, his expression of concern still in place.
“I could tell.”
Before he knows what’s happening, Cecilia has rearranged the hotel’s chaise lounges to flank underneath one of their peach-striped umbrellas, the footrests of each chaise touching. She places her floppy hat on the back of the second chaise and plops Draco down onto it, arranging his robe in such a way that sets off both his long legs and the pattern of the fabric.
Not ten seconds later the door is opening to Cameron’s blinding smile. “You came!”
“Stop me?”
Draco’s stomach rumbles at her words and he feels Harry chuckle, awkward and forced in front of him.
“This is—” Harry begins.
“He kidnapped you,” Hermione whispers into his ear. “I managed to cast a tracking charm on you before he got too far.” She pulls back, looking him over. “Are you okay?”
Hermione shrugs, pulling off her silk scarf and folding it neatly in her lap. “It seems, Scorpius is having a bit of a laugh at your expense.”
Draco tilts his head in question. Gabrielle moves to hold Draco’s hand, reassuring and firm. “I feel what he’s feeling. Like you and I but now with Scorpius too.”
“Call me Harry.”
It’s late August and the heavy sun is slowly disappearing behind the rooftops of London when Harry turns to Draco, hand outstretched in invitation. “Wanna ride?”
“Of course not.”
“I’m so sorry,” she whispers into his hair, hoping the apology isn’t lost to the roaring wind.
“Teddy said he used to keep his hair blond. He remembers moments, happy ones, where he’d see you two together, laughing, or just . . . sitting, in the back garden, and the aura surrounding you was blinding. He said he wanted to be blond like you so Harry would love him like he loved you.”
“He’s on fire,” she says, voice shot through with worry. Draco squeezes her shoulder.
Puffing out his chest, Draco says proudly, “I have two degrees.”
“He needs St. Mungo’s.”
She reaches for him, but Harry shies from her touch and hides his face from her knowing gaze, removing himself from the situation the only way he knows how. He’s walking out the front door, his feet taking him down the steps and past the front gate of the garden beyond. He speeds up, his shoes slapping against the wet pavement as he goes. He’s running before he knows it, the distant echoes of Hermione’s cries fading into the background as he chases the setting sun down the alleyways of Islington.
Cecilia ignores him and magicks the curtains open, letting light pour into Draco’s sanctuary.
He looks over again and Potter is biting his lip. Circe help him, he’s developing a tension headache from simply being near the bastard.
“Fuck, they’re really going to—” a cry of pleasure hits the air, cutting off Malfoy’s words as the two people below come together in a rush. Harry’s fingers shake as he pulls a drag of nicotine-laced smoke deep into his lungs, overwhelmed with the subversive thrill. He had been hoping for his day to include some quick, impassioned sex, he just had expected to be an active participant, not an uninvited witness.
“Is that a Muggle contraption?”
Malfoy had been wrong earlier; the markings covering Harry’s skin were not “Muggle ink”, nor were they a voluntary choice. They were Harry’s reality from the age of 13 when they first started appearing all over his body at random, from his collarbones to his ankles. He sees the constellations of the heavens sprawling out over his skin in intricate detail every time he steps out of the shower and looks in the mirror. He doesn’t understand them, but they’ve never affected his daily life outside of a desperate need to cover them up in school, which he quickly learned to do thanks to Hermione. His scar was enough of a burden; he didn’t need another distinguishing characteristic to separate him from his fellow classmates.
“Well, he’s—”
With a jolt that feels like a spark of pure electricity shooting down his spine, Harry blurts, “You’re getting off on this, aren’t you?”
The cocktail shaker hits the floor with a reverberating clang. Everyone winces, and suddenly the lazy afternoon Harry had planned of a casual fuck with an eager partner, evaporates into the ether. He sighs, lamenting the loss of that drink. He really could use it.
“Where’d you learn all this?”
“Why is he so tense?”
pauses to grab a bottle of Limoncello off the sideboard just inside the door. He pops the top and takes a swig. It burns but coats his tongue in its cloying sweetness, distracting him.
A minute passes, and then—
She had been an utter fool. Beauty and grace, yes, but loyalty and power had certainly skipped a generation. Lucius’ mind was weak, and his loyalty to his wife and son even weaker. She’d anchored herself to a man who destroyed the world she so idolised as a child, and now her son was succumbing to the very same fate.
Xenophilius is there, holding her steady, keeping her from falling to the ground in her exhaustion. She allows his support, sinking into his arms, his heat and his reassurance, no matter how uncertain it truly is. His presence in her life since even before her husband’s death has been one of the few bright spots of recent years. She turns her head into his shoulder and breathes in his warmth. Everything in the Manor is always so frigid, except Xenophilius. He is always warm.
“Essense of Valerian, crystalline silver, and lapis dust, a concoction the Seraphim angels who bred with wizards created over a millennia ago.” He bows, handing it to Hermione, who takes it with curious fingers.
“—you did all that you could.”
Taking in a deep gulp of fortifying salt air, Draco sets his resolve, feeling old and tired but with his promise to Scorpius ringing clear in his mind. He steadies himself and shoves his boot into the metal stirrup; he can do this.
“Breathe.”
“My point exactly.”
“Oh my—” Harry brings his arm down from behind his head to see the back of his hand now empty of ink with only a smattering of tiny stars inching down from his wrist. The words
Humming, Draco grins, wicked and wild, his eyes dark, knowing he’ll soon get his way. Harry’s already growing hard from the feel of Draco’s cool fingers alone.
Max’s eyes close as he obediently swallows a dribbled sip and Harry feels the sting of Draco’s ghost retreating to its place within the frame on his kitchen wall. Harry places the bottle on the table and undoes his flies, relief flooding him along with a spike of much-welcomed lust as he pulls out his half-hard cock.
Draco raises an eyebrow at him, only adding to the decadence of the scene as he reaches for the pastry box. “What is?”
Harry squints up at Cameron, taking him in. He’s yet to stop talking, continuing to hold a one-sided conversation with Harry about where he’s staying in Venice, the beauty of the lagoon, and a warning about never trusting a gondoliere named Fabrizio, and—Harry finds himself enjoying this unexpected new acquaintance.
“The fuck, Potter?”
Harry’s eager to watch his new friends, grinning at their dramatics before stumbling awkwardly into a fellow reveller. He spins, coming face-to-face with a devilish mouth and a shock of dusty pink hair, styled in such a way that it falls over its owner’s mask-covered forehead in a delicious tease. Harry’s fingers itch at his sides, wanting to touch, but he holds himself back and apologizes in Italian, if not for the abrasive shove then definitely for the objectification, only to be responded to in cut-glass English, which is the only reason Harry can understand him in the uproarious crowd.
“Scorpius, we were impulsive and had just survived a war. No one was in their right minds back then. It’s not like—”
“Yet you blame yourself for her death?”
Hermione smiles. “You can either take a Muggle boat to the island or you can fly.”
Draco jerks against him. “You never complained.”
Slightly worse for drink, Draco eyes the looming, leather-like wings of the Thestral with skepticism. Its cloudy eyes stare back at him, assessing and, to Draco’s pride-filled horror, finding him wanting.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Potter.”
“Tuesday, at two! Promise? We’ll drink, we’ll make art, it’ll be
.” She holds out a tiny cup and saucer.
“You don’t think me . . . “ Draco trails off, his eloquence leaving him as he fumbles for the right word.
“Gustave Caillebotte.
“Right, out with it,” he says, gesturing to his son, his patience waning.
“Stop it,” Harry said.
Thanks for reading! See you all Thursday!
White light strikes the water and his head snaps up, revelling at the vibration it sends through his bones. He’s free. Blessedly free and for the first time in years he’s breathing in fresh air and not the stagnant, humid press of ancient magic that constantly restricted his power and his instincts.
Thanks for reading! Comments are love. <3
Beside her, Harry jerks and she looks up in time to see him squeeze his eyes shut on a trail of fresh tears.
“Excuse me?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ear-scrambler charm, mate,” the man in the bikini and raincoat says, leaning into Harry’s space. “Sounds like gibberish ta Muggles.”
“This guy’s cool.”
. . .
“We cool, then?” Potter asks, apropos of nothing.
Stepping out to join them, she snatches Malfoy’s pack of cigs and lights one. “
It’s a letter from Narcissa Malfoy explaining her son’s untimely death. Luna scans it quickly, noting the warmth in Narcissa’s words. It had been apparent to even Draco’s mother that he and Harry were close, and acknowledged the importance Harry played in her son’s life, going so far as to extend her condolences to Harry. It was overwhelming.
Hermione opens her mouth to shout once again but stops herself before she can; her brilliant mind rushing ahead and leaving her emotions behind. “Wait, hide?”
“Dee!” she says, louder over the din. “He was just with you!”
“Good. Settled then.” Draco drops his hand from his face, and weakly gestures to Harry with a crook of his finger. “C’m’here.”
“What?”
“Where’s Malfoy at, then?” Ron asks, counting everyone on his fingers.
Harry isn’t sure who he’s more worried for at that moment, Draco or Luna.
“Harry, is he talking to you?”
“Clearly.”
Harry smelled smoke. It was sweet, alluring, with a hint of something familiar curling around his untethered thoughts. He blinked his eyes open. They felt dry and too large for their respective sockets, causing him to squint into the warm glowing light of the gallery.
“But he’s one of us. And he’s hurting.”
“You oiling up the old beast for a joyride?” Charlie says from the doorway of the barn. He’s backlit from the weak morning sun, his smile just barely visible when Harry looks up.
Ignoring her, Harry crouches down. He wants to get a look at this man, to show him that they mean to help him, and he can only do that if he can see the man’s face. There’s something there, something covering his skin. It shines in the torchlight and Harry ducks his head closer, reaching out with curious fingers to push the man’s hair back over his shoulder.
Draco looks back down, eyes fierce with want and holds Harry’s head in his hands. “Move,” he commands, “now.”
“Yet, here we are.” Harry raised his glowing hand in Malfoy’s direction, weak with the effort, and saw the unmistakable guilt radiating from his eyes. Harry felt empathy for Malfoy at that moment and then found himself distracted by the sharp contrast of his aristocratic features. The blue light of his cursed hand reflected off of Malfoy’s porcelain skin, making him appear as if he were made of marble. Harry smiled at the thought—was he talking to a piece of art? He must have been. This wasn’t his old rival in the flesh, this was Draco Malfoy, carved for the ages into solid stone. He was the grand centerpiece to the room, the reason for its existence was to house this statue of elegant defiance, carved and brought to life from the finest alabaster the world had on offer. Giggling to himself, Harry sat down hard, his legs unsteady, chest heaving. The Draco statue followed him with his stone-grey eyes, looking concerned, which Harry found impressive, considering that he was essentially a large rock.
Harry nods as he continues to pore over the books Hermione has brought him, his elbows digging into the smooth wood of the ancient tabletop as his tea steeps beside him. Hermione sits across from him worrying her hands, her omnipresent beaded bag filled with all the things a person could possibly need for a weekend holiday tucked within, no doubt. Ron sits next to him, stoic and silent. They’d handed Harry the books on Animagus transformation as soon as they’d stepped through his kitchen door, windswept and smelling of salt air from their journey. Harry pulled both of them into a bear of a hug and then quickly set the kettle to boiling. Charlie had appeared not two minutes later, pouring drams of whisky into each of their cups, announcing that their arrival warranted a celebration.
“Come to the Lido with us,
“My gods, Cameron! And you didn’t know?”
“I won’t watch you kill yourself.”
Luna looks off into the middle distance and pictures it, the rich colour of Harry’s skin entwined with the porcelain china of Draco’s, their heat and intensity finally allowed to blossom together as one—mingled sweat and clashing mouths, hips moving in tandem and hands gripping fierce and hard, holding their bodies tight together. She smiles, breath hitching at the vision she’s painted for herself. Hermione slaps her gently on the wrist, pulling her back to earth.
.” Cecilia waves at him as she magicks the door open and pointedly closes it without offering him to come inside.
Gabrielle shifts, leaning over Draco to tuck a lock of hair behind his ear that had fallen loose from its plait. Draco smiles at her, the amber glow of her aura sliding over him like golden honey, endlessly soothing and sweet.
“I cannot, in good conscience, administer any form of medicine to a patient without knowing its exact contents and uses.”
Potter stumbles back looking first confused, then wounded, then worried. “Did I—“ he begins to ask, but Draco cuts him off.
Draco only wears a pair of Harry’s pants to protect him from the elements. Hermione shivers at his lack of clothing, wondering how the chill of the air and the fast-approaching evening tide doesn’t affect him.
“Sorry, that doesn’t translate.”
“I said, come here, Potter. Don’t make me repeat myself.” Draco tugs ineffectually at Harry’s shoulder as Harry chuckles at his poor attempts to make him move.
“But she did, son.”
“What surprise?”
“You sure you don’t want to Portkey back with us, mate?” Ron asks.
This invitation is met with a raised eyebrow. “Stay? Am I nothing but a crup to you, Potter?”
“No judgement, Harry, but you might want to clean up before Hermione comes out here and sees your manhood.”
“Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do,” Ron had said with a grin. Harry, neighing in return, knew what Ron had meant and loved him for it even more.
There’s a hiss and a spiking of feathers when Harry makes contact with the man’s skin. Harry sits back, hands up in placation, ready to tell him that they mean him no harm. But then, the man raises his head up to look at Harry with an instantly recognizable quicksilver gaze, and for the second time that night, Harry is rendered speechless. His shock dies in his throat, unable to be voiced. He lands hard on the stone floor as he falls from his balanced crouch, the torch he carried clanking onto the marble and rolling away, out of sight.
“My drink.”
“Hermione,” Harry sighs, dropping his head in his hands.
. . .
”  She spins on her heel and starts up the steps.
Draco’s feathers spike at Hermione’s statement and she cringes in response. “Sorry,” she says to him, and then adds, “he can understand us perfectly well, at least.”
Hermione hates uncertainty.
“Brilliant,” Draco repeats, dumbfounded and trying his best to stem the flow of memories rushing through him. The phantom feel of Harry’s smooth leather jacket against his sweaty palms on his first ride with him over the London rooftops; the heady vibration of the engine beneath his thighs as Harry fucks into him hard and hot from behind, Draco draped like a luxurious silk over the handlebars, purring along with the machine as Harry pulls back on his hair, the sting sending a zip of pleasure down his spine; the two of them hovering midair over the Manor’s grounds, kissing with happy abandon as a final
Draco slants his eyes down towards his arm, nostrils flaring. He looks caught, and so utterly guilty that Harry laughs.
Draco nods. “Only other things.” His tone sounding hurt and tentative in a way Harry isn’t used to hearing. He knows they’re getting to the crux of it now.
Teddy pulls hard at Draco’s arm and Draco rips himself free, shooting Teddy a glare above him. Teddy is shouting to him but he can’t hear it, only the roaring of an engine coming closer is audible through the cacophony of nature around them.
“We’re fine!” he barks, then quiets his voice. “See?” Harry steps back and runs a hand through his hair, allowing the women to witness Draco, fully nude and erect behind him.
Harry turns off the heat on the hob. “Don’t be. You didn’t know.”
“Don’t forget me, Harry Potter.”
“The fuck?” he says, just as Harry blurts, “Fuck me.”
Humming to himself, he takes in the artistic opulence of the room around him as he follows the sounds coming from the kitchen. He rounds a corner, distracted by a fruiting tree that’s emanating what sounds like a lullaby, before coming up short at the sight of a shockingly familiar white-blond head.
They must make a motley quartet, spanning out over the landscape with the herd, while Ron no doubt stands guard back at the kitchen door, arms crossed over his chest, little Rose sitting eagerly on his shoulders pulling at his hair. Harry had witnessed Rose’s shock when he shifted and he couldn’t help but internally smile at the genuine surprise on her face, the ensuing giggle and the assessing intelligence in her expression as she took in this new experience before her. What a sight it must be to see it from Rose’s eyes.
“You’re missing the dusk wisps!” Luna says just as Hermione closes the distance between them, kissing Luna until her willowy arms wrap themselves around Hermione’s shoulders and hold her back. It’s a perfect, solitary moment in a perfect, solitary place.
Harry snorts into his glass. "Yup. The Canadians
“Fuck.”
“We must visit him,” she says, adamant.
“So, then we cross that bridge when we come to it.” Luna leans in and kisses Hermione’s dusty cheek.
Luna gives his shoulder a reassuring squeeze. “Do it again, Harry.”
“Calm down, Harry.”
before crowding closer to him on the large four-poster bed.
Chuckling, Harry runs his hands through his wind-blown hair. He looks comfortable, perfectly balanced on a
The sun is warm on Harry’s skin as he stretches, luxuriating in its surprise appearance on what was supposed to be a dreary May morning.
Draco had shoved him and Harry had laughed. They wrestled on the bed before Harry kissed Draco into submission, pressing his tongue deep into his mouth and pushing a thigh between his legs, feeling the hardness waiting for him there. They hadn’t wasted the moment and within seconds were gasping into each other’s mouths.
“Yes, my love,” Xenophilius says, raising her arm to kiss her wrist. He cups her hand between his palms, holding tight. “What once was lost is now found.”
“Yes, Pip, thank you.”
“Why do you know all this?” Harry asks, gesturing at his person.
capture the beauty that is Potter, she’s made an exception.
. . .
She folds her arms across her chest, stance firm. “Because he’s the summer guest I booked. Remember? We discussed this last week. He’s here for the duration.”
Hermione refuses to believe this because every time she insists they return the next day to see whatever important thing Luna must see today, no matter the occasion or quest, the weather forecast inexplicably and suddenly looks dire.
"And I truly love you too, Draco."
A ripple of black velvet air shifts and slides open before them, revealing not the quiet, undisturbed valley of greenery and nighttime peace that he thought was in front of them, but a city of grey stone and marble, painted deep purple in the moonlight.
Down below on
“The fuck?” Potter says, looking stunned. “Malfoy, I’m not… this isn’t… I wouldn’t—“
Draco shakes his head, an involuntary shiver running through him. “Not quite, no.”
Hermione laughs, and goes back to her book.
Temper rising, Harry stood on unsteady legs, wishing Malfoy would string more than four words together. Of course, the
At Harry’s words, Hermione’s eyes fill with tears. She hurls herself at him as he stands to go, with Ron coming up behind her and engulfing all three of them in his long, strong arms. They remain that way, wrapped up together for almost a full minute, breathing in each other’s joyous memories of a holiday well spent and a reluctance to see it end as the precious time they have left comes to a close. It’s so rare for it to be just the three of them nowadays.
“Do we, though?” she asks, tilting her head inquisitively.
“I love you,” Scorpius says, so genuine it makes Draco’s eyes burn with tears.
“I was worried this would happen,” Ron laments with a soft chuckle.
Draco’s mouth falls open in undignified astonishment. He’d been a baby, a toddler at best, there was no way Teddy should remember such a fleeting moment in his life.
Draco shrugs again, his wings hitching with the movement.
Luna nods against his shoulder in understanding. The mental image she conjured feeling more real the longer she stares at the pool table before her, as if she were looking at their ghostly impressions through a Pensieve.
“Do you think he’s—”
Harry’s anxiety was spiking with the ever-growing silence, feeling uneasy about what had transpired earlier: how his hands appeared healed but, according to Malfoy, were still very much cursed. He looked down at them, at the blunt fingernails and calloused palms, the veins of his wrists and the uneven lines of his own messy handwriting carved into the back of his left hand, the words faded to light slashes of puckered skin over the years leaving only ‘must not’ and ‘lie’ visible. Seeing those three words spurred him into action.
Draco looks down at him, his eyes calculating and somehow amused.
“He hurt her?” Luna asks, feeling awful inside.
“How is he?” she asks, catching Draco off guard a few minutes later.
,” he spits back, his hips canting into Potter’s touch.
“Are you happy, Harry?”
Blinking, Harry turns and spies Cecilia walking over the bridge, making quite the picture of a Venetian woman with a bushel of flowers in hand and a tote of bottles clinking lightly at her side in the bright sunshine of an Italian afternoon.
“What would happen?”
The days pass by in a blur of turquoise water and cups of white wine. Hermione drags them to the Doge’s Palace and the Rialto Bridge, out-of-the-way fish markets, a museum named after a woman called Peggy, and a bookstore whose stone floor sits so close to the lapping tide that often there are puddles in the aisles, the ancient bookshelves propped up on stilts. One day, Ron insists that they take a gondola ride together, despite Harry being the third wheel. He snaps pictures of his best friends and sends them back home by owl to Molly, Arthur, and little Rose, reminding her that no, her parents did not abandon her, and that they’ll be back very soon.
She pushed her magic towards him, too, crooning as the bond swelled and filled, going from ghostly pale to golden-red and then into a thick cord the color of blood cut straight from an artery. Bright, so bright, so beautiful and perfect. Draco laughed as the final few ghost-strands flew away and their bond settled in between the two of them.
Harry could see the questions in all the Weasley's eyes, especially Ron's as he took another sandwich and started eating as fast as he possibly could. The twins didn't try to grab it this time. They both looked kind of ashamed of themselves which was good. As often as Dudley had done that to Harry, no way could he let it go on for Ron when it was so easy to speak up.
"Which reminds me," Draco said as if he was desperate to talk about anything other than the white amazing whatever it was that had happened between them. He wagged a finger at Harry just like Harry had wagged a finger at him. "I felt something when I touched your magic. It was… Deep breath, Potter. You're not going to like this."
Professor McGonagall snapped her mouth shut, eyebrows going right up to her hairline and shoulders going tight with surprise. Good. Harry didn't need the distraction of grownups being stupid and not listening right now.
Dumbledore had him here deliberately. He'd set Harry up to be abused his entire life on purpose. Did it really matter why? Whatever his reasoning was, he'd condemned Harry when he was a toddler. Harry couldn't imagine Dumbledore changing his mind after this long, if ever.
That meant Draco had to do it.
"Oh good," Harry said, rubbing his ears. "Thank you very much for checking, Ivy, Dobby, Cooper. Can you guys bring food? And tea, too. Oh, and I think Hermione needs a nice warm blanket. She was kind of in shock."
The family magic filled Draco until his hair stood on end. Until his breath came in pants and huffs that sent bolts of blue shooting across the ward stone room. He could feel Ivy pressing against his thigh. Blue and Vern and Yule were kneeling on Mother's bed, keeping her safe as the family magic flooded the Manor.
"Goblins?" Harry asked not just Draco but also Grandpa Arcturus, Amal, and Mrs. Malfoy.
His cheeks burned at admitting that he had a temper. All his life, he'd been beaten and yelled at and bullied and abused for ever speaking up for himself. Most of the time, almost all the time, it made him wince and give up and pull away to hide.
"No!" Harry shouted.
Harry sighed. "You can't. No one can. Look around. This is all I'll ever have. I can't escape. You saw me today. You've seen it for a while now, I guess. I'm a slave and that's all I'll ever be."
There.
She marched right down the stairs into Potter Keep, leaving Harry staring after her and Remus clutching the letter to his chest like he was terrified to let it get too close to Professor McGonagall. Harry opened his mouth and then shut it slowly. He was pretty sure that she'd been not-saying that it was a sex thing. Which, um, yikes. And eww. And wow. And…
"Harry may or may not have been trapped into a betrothal contract," Draco started only to wince as Cooper and Dobby both popped in to start patting Harry's face, knees, hands, and chest along with Ivy. "We're not sure his magical signature was gathered and added to it? If not, it's a matter for Amal and a lot of money. If it is, well…"
To Draco's shock, Mother's jaw dropped open. She paled and then turned and grabbed some floo powder.
Draco couldn't allow them to be punished.
"Is Black Manor safe?" Harry asked Amal without looking his way. "I mean, safe for him to go back to."
"Are you sure you want to give them this?" Amal asked quietly when Harry had him proofread the letter.
Fred replied.
"What's wrong, Grandpa?" Harry asked even though Draco absolutely wasn't sure it was a good idea to disrupt Grandfather Arcturus' concentration right then.
"Yes, Master!" Dobby said.
He scooted a little closer to Dobby, staring into those lightning bolt-struck eyes.
Father was doomed.
They'd talk to the Goblins, summon the Malfoy family to Black Manor, and see what they learned.
"Same here," Harry agreed. "I just kept telling it that no, you don't have to keep trying. No, it's all right. No, you did a good job. No, it'll be fine. You can rest now. And after a while, it did let go and then it sort of fell apart."
He laughed when Harry swatted him with a pillow, but he didn't stop looking smug as all get-out over it. Harry rolled his eyes and did the spell again, discovering that yep, the wards really, really, really would be delighted to keep Remus from leaving the floo room, either by the doorway or the floo. Or the window.
Nor could Draco let Father punish him.
"I think he's functionally illiterate," Harry said. He winced when Draco opened both eyes and sat up again. "I mean, he can read. Kind of? It's hard for him. I get the impression that he had to sound everything out and he traces every line as he reads it as if the words are going to escape off the edge of the page."
Grandpa Arcturus' eyebrows went up as he considered the question, hands draped over his knees as he leaned forward to study Draco and Harry.
"Can you feel Ivy?" Harry whispered.
"I'm sure," Draco said. He firmly ignored Harry's grumbles behind him, focusing fully on Mr. Parkinson. "Once we realized that there might be an issue, we researched it and immediately contacted you. Unfortunately, it won't be possible for Pansy and I to marry. Had Father bothered to ask, I would have informed him that I'm completely and utterly gay. I've no interest in girls and I've no expectation that I would ever develop an interest in them."
"There were no intro classes at all," Harry said. "We were just tossed into our classes and expected to survive."
"Would… transfiguration work?" Draco asked so slowly that he felt like an idiot.
Harry reached out to touch it only to freeze as Dobby and Ivy popped in. He could hear footsteps pounding up the hallway. Draco frowned, then blushed as Mrs. Malfoy burst into the library with a wild expression in her eyes. Amal was right on her heels, looking just as alarmed. It took another few seconds for Grandpa Arcturus to run in, panting.
"She helped?" Harry asked.
"Well, that was fun," George said with a shaky laugh. "What'll we do for lunch?"
They sighed in unison, turning back to their food. Both of them were hungry. And thirsty. Draco was far too tired given that he hadn't been part of the ritual. Harry was quite justifiably exhausted.
Draco nodded as he pulled himself back to his feet and brushed himself off. "We'll ask him once we get back to Potter Keep. Let's see if we can catch Mother and Grandfather Arcturus. They should know about this. It might be a clue to what we need to do."
"Fair enough," Healer Smethwyck said. He turned to Mother. "You stay right there, young lady. I suspect that we'll be at this the rest of the day."
He had his own bathroom with a big black claw-footed tub and a wardrobe as large as Dudley's second bedroom and a sitting room with three comfy armchairs, two couches and his own fireplace that was not, thankfully, connected to the floo network.
He strode right over to the blue phoenix who was truly enormous. She was bigger than Harry by a good bit, possibly heavier than he was. Draco's stomach went to knots just looking at scrawny Harry next to the huge, powerful, and completely unknown phoenix.
Everyone at school was hurt. Hurt or doing the hurting. It kind of made a lot more sense out of Draco's behavior last year. If he'd spent his whole life being beaten up and yelled at by his dad, then his dad would be the ultimate threat. Except that no one else saw the same things so Draco had ended up sounding kind of childish.
Angry goose noises. Lots and lots of angry goose noises. Harry leaned back in his chair and let Amal mutter fury-garbled curses in languages that Harry didn't need to know to realize that they were bad words. By the time he was done, it was almost four-thirty. Amal rubbed his face with both hands and then stood, eyes locked on all the paperwork.
"I'm afraid she can't do that," Draco said and then winced as Lord Black and Harry both glared at him. "She doesn't control the wards. I do."
So many who had not asked Lady Magic for help.
"Dobby, if the phoenix does something like try to grab me or Draco, I want you to go straight to the goblins," Harry explained. "Take Amal with you. He's got all the authority to act with everything I have as a Potter and as a Black. He's the Seneschal. He can go to the ICW and get so much help. Don't let anyone grab him or hurt him or spell him or anything that might compromise him."
"What we need to know," Harry said, grinning and letting the elves do just what they felt was necessary even though Hermione's eyes had gone as wide as saucers, "is if my magical signature has changed since the blessing is gone. If so, then whatever is on the contract won't match me anymore and it's all good."
His honor.
Potter Keep's war wards made Malfoy Manor's wards look like a joke.
Well, that simplified things a lot, even though everyone other than Grandpa Arcturus looked like Dobby had to be outright wrong. Grandpa Arcturus hummed and summoned Cooper who popped in with a damp dishrag in his hands.
"It could be," Draco murmured, blushing that he'd either not hidden his thoughts deep enough that they would stay in his head instead of radiating through the bond or he'd spoken out loud, which was worse.
Draco nodded and sipped his tea, wincing at the raw bitter edge of it. A second sip took that rawness down to a mild bite and then the third numbed his tongue enough that he could drink the rest without wincing.
"Oh, um, figured out how to break the curse on him," Harry replied with a shrug of his shoulders. "And, you know, a lot of other stuff. Are you okay? I mean, you dad did just die."
The sobbing screams of a girl.
Draco rolled his head to stare at Harry with a snide little smile. "It's like you lived in my house."
Both Ron and Hermione had opened their mouths to protest. They snapped their mouths shut as Grandfather Arcturus moved to stand behind Draco and Harry. To Draco's surprise, Bill and Charlie collared Hermione and Ron, dragging them towards the door.
Draco pursed his lips, staring at Ivy who nodded like she wasn't cheating to get Draco to lie down. Sneaky damn Elf. She always did this. Even Mother wasn't as good at making Draco behave. Probably because Mother had been so badly hurt and controlled by Father, but still.
Remus howled like a wolf as he charged at Dumbledore on all fours, awkward and terrifyingly wolf-like despite being mostly human.
"Without being seen?" Draco protested. "Are you crazy? Of course you'd be seen. You'll need your wand, a lumos, something to find your way."
The magic surged around them.
He wrote something on a piece of paper, setting it in a box on his counter. The paper flashed away, and the goblin nodded for them to move off to the side. Amal led Harry and Dobby off to the left where a long hardwood bench stained black like it'd been coated with soot stood. He didn't sit and shook his head that Harry and Dobby shouldn't either.
Draco stared at him. Hermione stared, too, mouth dropped open as she made incoherent little noises. At least she'd stopped with the chattering teeth and her hands had begun to warm up. That was good. Kind of horrid that she'd been so frightened by that betrothal contract that she'd more or less gone into shock.
After another moment, Silverclaw was on his feet and heading for the note paper while Mrs. Malfoy start whispering prayers and Grandpa Arcturus cursed at the top of his lungs.
Draco saw no need to reply to that given that it was blatantly obvious through their bond. It felt like Harry's emotions poured straight into him. He was rather horrified that his emotions had to be pouring into Harry, too.
Grandfather Arcturus snort-laughed and nodded. "That he would. And I wouldn't begrudge him a single knut for arranging the meeting, either. Make sure you head right back, lad. I don't want you here alone. Or just with elves, as the case may be."
"I'm so sorry," Hermione muttered against Harry's shoulder. "I'm so, so sorry!"
Bless him for it. Outside, in the hallway, Mother's voice was just audible. From the higher tone answering her, she must be talking to Professor McGonagall about what to do next. None of them had felt safe enough to leave.
A wave of reassurance came from Draco, washing over Harry like someone had just pulled a blanket up over him and tucked him in. It was so strange, so unlike anything he'd ever had until the last few days that Harry turned and stared at Draco who got those spots of color high on his cheeks again.
"Nah, it's not just me," Harry insisted just as quietly. "It's the magic. I mean, it's gotta go very soft and very gentle and kind of… like encouraging something very small and weak and exhausted to rest? That's what it felt like to me. It wasn't… like that."
Grandfather Arcturus grimaced. "I hate that you're making so much sense. I don't want you boys in danger."
"Um," Harry waved at Grandpa Arcturus because he didn't exactly what to let Remus know who was there if he didn't have to. "Is there some way we can make sure that Remus isn't being controlled, spied on, I don't know, having Dumbledore look through his eyes?"
Draco didn't let himself pace. He so desperately wanted to. Harry was out there, by himself, doing a ritual prayer when he'd never even lit a candle to Lady Magic before. Who knew what could go wrong?
"I'm glowing?" Harry asked.
He pressed his head back into the pillow to dodge the flailing arm Harry whipped around as he came awake with a startled shout. Harry stared around his bedroom, clutching Draco's pajama shirt, blinked several times and then turned to stare at Ivy.
The way Draco paled and then looked away told Harry that no, he wasn't crazy for suspecting that Dumbledore wanted him to suffer. When Draco looked back at Harry, his face was blank, reserved, formal, despite the way magic swirled in his eyes and his lips pursed. If it had been Aunt Petunia, Harry would've gotten a severe scolding, a beating with a wooden spoon and then been sent to his cupboard without meals for a week.
Once they got through his short, simple labyrinth.
Remus wiped the sweat from his forehead with his handkerchief. He didn't look like he understood that at all. Professor McGonagall frowned at them as if they weren't making sense. Thankfully, both Mother and Grandfather Arcturus seemed to be considering it.
"Oh," Harry said as he blushed even harder than before. "It's bigger inside."
Six books flew across the room to hover in front of Harry. All six of them were slender little books. Harry grabbed them and started flipping through them. Draco looked at the titles and then frowned as he realized that they weren't six separate books. They were six copies of the same book, bound in different colors of leather.
"Rest, my beautiful sons," Lady Magic murmured as the waves and waves and waves of magic swept across the world. "Rest. It is done and done well."
"Hurry!" Draco shouted at them.
Draco stared at the tiny papercut, a thunderous scowl forming. "What exactly did you do, Potter?"
Well, Father would do that. Anything that took away from what he thought Draco should be had to be eliminated. Honestly, Dumbledore probably did something, too.
He stopped and frowned up at Grandfather Arcturus. The blessing was all that Grandfather Arcturus had on him. There was no other trace of Dumbledore's magic staining his magical core.
It was four in the afternoon by the time Mr. Swashlin, who insisted that Harry should call him Amal, finished taking notes. He was still making indignant noises, kind of like an angry goose, but he was done taking notes.
"Who said anything about submitting?" Harry asked. "Or giving up? I said accept. You are a werewolf. You're also a wizard. Your wolf needs to accept the wizard side of you. The wizard side needs to accept the wolf. There's no giving in there. Accept and agree to work together is not at all the same thing as submit to. Besides, both sides of you will get something out of it if you do it. You'll be free from Dumbledore's control. You'll have family again. Heck, Grandpa Arcturus is pretty sure he can get Sirius free. You'll get Sirius back, too, but only if you can get rid of that blessing messing you up."
Emily, the lady from outside, came in with that lovely silver tea set and a plate piled high with chocolate biscuits. She chuckled when Dobby huffed at her, letting Dobby take over serving. Thankfully, she shut the door behind her when she left because Mr. Swashlin spluttered and made outraged gestures as if he wanted to shout but couldn't quite get the words out.
"No."
Professor McGonagall shook her head and patted Draco on the head. "You'll understand when you're older, dear. Come on, now, both of you. Let's go talk to the others. Is there an offer of help? A bazooka to blow that rotten no-good bastard pretending to be Dumbledore to smithereens would be perfect."
"It's not cheating," Draco said with his best Slytherin smirk. "It's using the proper tool to the job."
The altar burned with black, bloody magic, shoving Harry and Draco half a step away from it.
"He stole my books," Harry exclaimed, "dumped me in a home where I'd never learn anything about magic and where I'd be abused. He hired Voldemort to teach at the school! I mean, from what Silverclaw said, there's no way he couldn't tell that Voldemort had possessed Professor Quirrell. Hogwarts has wards. We were all told we were perfectly safe there because of the wards. Then there's the whole thing with the Philosopher's Stone and the unicorns and the maze. How is hiding the Philosopher's Stone behind traps that three first-years can get through a good way of protecting the Stone? And, really, how do we know that prophecy that started it all is real? There's… so… many things!"
Blue's eyes flicked their way and then went firmly away when Draco bit his lip.
That hardly bothered Harry who'd looked around the Blue suite with such delight that Draco had laughed as he opened the door connecting their suites.
He tucked the athame away, cupped the blood in the palm of his hand, and as Harry took the final few steps, turned his hand over to let the blood drop down onto the first of the ancient rune circles.
He watched Grandpa Arcturus take his place at one end of the room, directly opposite Draco who stood like they were back in the Great Hall at Hogwarts, sizing each other up before a meal. The bond between then was almost visible if Harry squinted just right and turned his head to the side. He didn't need to see it to feel it, though.
They would be fine. They would. Remus was tough. Grandpa Arcturus was way healthier than he had been. And Professor McGonagall had a link to the school. She should be able to deflect some of the wards magic.
Effective madness but then that was what Harry excelled at. He was so very in tune with Lady Magic at her wildest that he did things that no one in their right mind would ever consider and made them work. He'd stolen Dobby, found his seneschal, saved Grandfather Arcturus, forged an alliance with Draco out of nowhere, saved most of the magical world and now all of this.
Hermione sits on a magically cushioned rock, knees tucked up under her chin, and waits. And waits, and waits, and then sighs and waits ever more.
“Shit, sorry,” he says and begins to turn, but Draco’s on him in an instant, pressing him into the door and inhaling deeply against the skin of his throat. Harry feels the hard length of Draco against his abdomen and that knowledge does not help his current predicament. He arches his back, straining against Draco’s hold, all the while aligning their bodies more fully together. Harry’s spiralling, wanting to shove Draco away and pull him closer all at once.
“Who cares?”
Malfoy closed his eyes, his jaw going rigid with strain. “Not. Healed.”
“Father?”
“I don’t despise you—”
Draco catches him, holding him steady by the upper arms. “Careful there, you’ll break that pretty nose of yours again.”
For Draco's sake, for all of their sake, Narcissa comes to a decision. She stands, the world swaying slightly in front of her, and moves to untie the laces that keep the brocade sleeves of her silk robes in place. One by one, she plucks at the crisscrossed ribbon, feeling the fabric loosen around her forearms. She notes that Xenophilius' daughter is beside her, watching her intently, but this does not change her mind. She too needs to know the consequences of Draco's freedom.
“Except by me, and now you.” Draco smiles behind a lock of fallen pink hair. Harry pushes it back behind his ear and Draco leans into his palm, melting into the touch.
“Everything! Nothing! It’s all just—hurry!”
Harry looks at her, startled. “What the—”
Holding her breath, she releases the final tie, allowing both sleeves to split at the seams. The fabric pools at her elbows, exposing the jagged lines of the raised skin along her forearms, put there by the taloned hands of her beloved son. She does not blame him, she knows these scars were not Draco’s doing, but the creature that poisons his mind and his blood.
“He’s late,” Harry says, pacing back and forth across the parlour floor, hands clenching and unclenching at his sides. He’s been itchy all morning, a feeling of unease had settled somewhere along the back of his neck at dawn and taken root throughout the early hours. He can’t shake the sensation that something is wrong.
“Tuck in, gents. Chips are rubbish when you use a warming charm.”
“But Draco needs you, darling.”
“Like you care,” she tells him under her breath.
Harry turns his eyes away, clearing his throat.
Cecilia frowns, her knee bouncing once again. “He can be such a Gemini,” she’s saying, mostly to herself. Cameron grins at her, mouthing,
“Hmm?” Draco looks up, attention having drifted as his fingers dance over Harry’s chest.
“Yes, you were.”
“Talking, of course.”
Thoughts of parental figures with burgeoning, semi-adulterous sex lives help to distract her from her grief, but it’s fleeting, a mere blip on the tide of pain quickly rising over the dusty, black and white tiled floor.
Harry finishes his cigarette, vanishes the butt, and follows. He pokes at a slightly curled, waxy leaf of an odd-looking lopsided tree just inside the glass door.
“This is thoroughly undignified,” he yawns, curling further into Harry’s side.
. . .
Movement from across the room draws Draco’s attention. Hermione, the determined bint that she is, has managed to revive the elf from its stupor and Draco, knowing what Mipsy’s presence means, buries his head in the sweet heat of Harry’s neck, hiding behind the fall of his hair.
Hermione huffs out a laugh and pushes off from the railing. She needs another drink.
Draco nods, dragging his nose repeatedly over the scar he caused. The sensation is entirely too much and not nearly enough. When Draco presses his lips to the sensitive skin, Harry bites down hard on his own cheek. Draco does it a second time, lingering and possessive, and Harry can’t take it. He slams his head back against the door with a grunt for lack of a better thing to do.
“Sounds reasonable.”
“You’re drunk.”
Harry shrugs, his hands running over the neat row of records. He plucks one out at random and smiles at the cover:
Draco ignores the looks all around him and stands, holding the gangly, awkward creature in his weakened grip, back aching at the unexpected weight, his right leg in danger of giving out beneath him. He refuses to appear weak in front of the men who were about to let the poor beast in his arms drown and storms off towards the stables, head held as high as he can muster as pain rockets through his body every other step.
Luna turns and crouches down to run a hand over Draco’s feathers. “She did this.”
Looking over her shoulder to the pendulum wall clock softly swinging back and forth in its gilded box, Hermione laments what little night they have left. By the time they’d all gathered in the kitchen, seen to Harry’s awful bite wound, admonished Draco for administering said bite wound, scrambled a few eggs for supper, and figured out a place to keep Draco, it’d just turn 2.
Draco immediately advances on her, finger raised in admonishment. “
“Harry can’t lose him again,” Luna says, pulling back to look Hermione in the eye, startling her.
“I doubt this. Sun is good for you.”
,” someone says behind him, tapping him on the shoulder. He turns, looking down at a little girl with two long plaits tied with yellow ribbons. He smiles at her.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Luna! Harry won’t be at the shops forever.”
“Well, distract me better,” Harry taunts, only to be met with a wide-eyed gasp.
“Just wait till tomorrow night.” She winked at him and he laughed.
“Call me Harry,” Harry says as he rises to his knees, straddling Draco’s torso.
He tosses his head once on the pillow, still panting from his seizure, his chest heaving under the sheet.
Behind them, the teapot explodes.
“We can’t leave him here.”
He drops his hand, turning his attention back to Draco, feeling caught—as if every one of the warring emotions that he’s felt over the past weeks are now written stark and blatant across his face. Harry suspects what he feels for Draco runs deeper than what Draco is willing to offer him in return. He knows that their time together has an expiration date that’s quickly approaching; that this experience will boil down to a lust-filled affair Harry once had while on holiday, no matter his confessions earlier in the week. He doesn’t expect anything more, is too cautious to want to hope, but what he sees reflected in Draco’s eyes has his heart kicking behind the cage of his ribs.
Draco’s eyes light up at Harry’s confirmation. He inhales, taking in the warm smell of butter and custard emanating from the box. He points at one
“It is.”
“What happened?”
Draco is there, crouched on a chaise lounge, holding his head in his hands, his abandoned teacup from earlier sat beside him. He’s shaking. Harry goes to him, like a magnet sliding along metal—steady, electric, and inevitable.
“He left him there, Hermione,” Harry repeats. His knuckles are turning white as he presses his fingers deeper into his own flesh. He’s sure to leave bruises. The shells on the tabletop nearby begin to rattle and the fire in the hearth ignites into life without warning. Hermione jumps.
“That, or he was coming on to me.” Harry shakes his head. “Nevermind. How’d you find me?”
Draco frowns. “I don’t?”
“You play poker?” Hermione asks, brow furrowed.
he curses out onto the biting wind as the waves crash along the rocky shore bleow, sending up sea spray to meet him on the breeze. He hopes Harry can hear him back on the balcony, left all alone with his erection flagging in his jeans, and his pouting lips mumbling over what he suspects he did wrong.
“It worked?” Harry asks, and Draco nods. “Again?” Another nod. Harry concentrates and feels when the charm takes hold, this time coating the hand Draco has around Harry’s cock in warm, wet oil. “Fuck,” he breathes out, his hips moving of their own accord, unable to stop his shallow thrusts into Draco’s fist.
“Only for a little while, as it turns out.”
“It’s alright, Potter. You don’t have to pretend on my account.” He moves away from him, stepping closer to the rocks, the waves crashing against them in an impressive display of salty mist and seafoam.
Harry asks, turning his head towards Draco’s hair, his lips brushing his forehead.
That one stings. Harry grimaces and brings a hand up to Draco’s hair, soothing out a tangle. Draco, despite himself, leans into his touch.
“This is nice,” Luna sighs, sounding sleepy.

Harry does a double-take.

Ignoring the prickle of threatening tears, Luna pulls Draco in, tucking his head beneath her chin. Draco wraps his arms tightly around her, and Luna smiles at the strength of the embrace.
Harry tells him, and Draco lovingly runs his nose along the protruding tendon leading from Harry’s throat to his shoulder.
“Granger, you can’t be serious,” he says in scandalised tones as he squeezes her hands in greeting, utterly relieved that she’s here. “What on earth is going on?”
Hermione shrugs again and returns to her dessert.  “What? I didn’t want to lose you or Ron.”
“Among other things.”
“Subtle, Potter,” Draco says, smirking.
“I can’t tell where it’s coming from,” Hermione whispers. “The echo is bouncing off every surface.”
?” he asks, voice filled with wonder.
“You aren’t,” Harry grunts aloud. Everyone looks to him, and he swallows, standing firm.
“They met on a Muggle dating app. Max comes and goes as he pleases and has never promised Harry anything. It’s been two years and still! It’s infuriating. He’s just a . . . “ she worries her lip further, looking for the right word before settling on
Hermione looks up, wiping at her nose. “Owl us when you’re home?”
“They’d say it all the time.
“Oof!” Harry says, then laughs lightly. “Kay, that worked.” He rolls Draco slowly to the side, mindful of his wings, and extracts himself from underneath him, only to pull him up by the torso a moment later.
“Harry,” Draco whispers, and this time, Harry’s eyes are open to see it. His body shivers with the realisation that Draco is speaking to him, his neglected cock leaking at the sound. He removes his hand, swallows Draco down to the root, and hums.
Draco simply stares at her, his eyes glassy and unfocused.
Harry nods. “I’m a good cook.”
“No, before that,” Scorpius interrupts. “Before school. When you and Mr Potter were young and Teddy was still a kid. He remembers you.”
“No kidding.” The man has picked the woman up by her hips and pushed her onto the railing of the bridge, her legs wrapping tightly around his waist. “I feel wrong watching this,” Harry whispers.
“How?” he breathes, but Draco grabs his face with long fingers and directs their mouths back together, smiling into the kiss with a wickedness that Harry eagerly meets.
Hermione blinks at him, her number of concerns growing by the second.
“He’s alive!” is all she says before she’s pulling Harry into Side-Along Apparation with a twist of her wrist, and Harry’s world turns black.
Draco looks up at him, “The Stag.”
“He has many tells. One of them being the blatant changeover from one obsession to the next.”
Harry tries not to dwell on Draco’s conspicuous absence. He had dared to hope that he’d join in on the fun, yet Harry hasn’t seen that white-blond hair of his all evening. He pretends to ignore the nagging sense of disappointment that eats at him the rest of the night, and instead grabs another drink.
She moaned in pain but nodded, her hand squeezing his arm as he carried her from the room towards the master bedroom.
“I believe so.”
Charlie folds his arms across his broad chest and looks to Hermione, a smirk playing at the corner of his lips. He’s enjoying himself entirely too much. A smirking Weasley never led to anything pleasant in Draco’s book.
“It’s not a bad thing, Harry,” Hermione says, earnest.
Harry jumps, startled. There’s a priest standing over him, white cassock pristine and edged with silver thread, his face weathered and kind.
Harry grins. “What’s that?”
“Don’t be.”
“Is that a challenge,
Harry’s lying on his side near Draco’s hip, his fingers trailing along the pale hair of Draco’s thighs. “Fine by me.” Amusement clear in his tone.
“How long have you lived here?” Harry tries again at conversation, and this time, Malfoy turns to him, eyes narrow as he pushes out smoke through his nostrils.
Grabbing a stray pen off the countertop strewn with collection samples and drying herbs, he twists his hair up into a bun atop his head, feeling too overheated with it lying over his shoulders. He runs his arm across his forehead; his skin is searing.
The dam inside Draco’s heart bursts open and he feels a surge of pure animalistic fury explode through him as the world turns red. “Fuck you!”
Pleased with this description, Draco encircles Harry with his fist, squeezing as he finally takes him into his mouth. They both moan at the contact and Draco thrills at being able to taste that salty heat against his tongue. He sinks lower, wanting more of him, all of him, until his nose is buried in the curls at the base of Harry's cock and his throat works to accept the intrusion.
“Yes,” Draco hisses, raising his head up to pierce Harry with his preternatural stare, hypnotizing and alluring beyond measure. “Fuck me.”
. It is not my place to dictate otherwise.”
“That is, if you’d like to, Mr Malfoy,” Teddy adds, his placating nature showing along with a cool blue glow of his aura, its effect calming Draco’s nerves. The mischievous smile he pairs with the invitation, however, is totally a Weasley influence along with the chosen colour of his ginger hair save for one streak of jet black to match Harry’s.
“Same thing.”
It’s a rasp. A broken cry of a word, but Harry’s eyes go wide at the sound. He looks up, and sees Draco biting his lip, his face tense with concentration. Harry wants to pull back, to ask him if he spoke, but Draco’s holding tight to Harry’s hair, guiding him along his cock as he pumps faster and faster, reaching closer to that cliff’s edge of release.
“Out with it, I’m an old man. My time is short.”
She winks at Harry. “You shall see.”
Patting his chest, Charlie gasps, "Grand!” before doubling over with laughter. Teddy joins him, practically falling to his knees at Charlie’s side.
Harry nods, though Draco isn’t looking at him. He can see the internal war behind Draco’s eyes; the urge to descend and greet his mother and the desperate want to flee. Harry wonders which instinct will win in the end, but before Harry can find out, Narcissa is brushing past him and advancing up the stairs faster than Harry thought possible for someone in floor-length robes. She moves towards Draco, a single arm outstretched, long fingers reaching as if possessed.
Dove vai? - where are you going?
, Malfoy,” Harry calls, just as Draco is slipping away. He halts and looks back over his shoulder. Potter is holding eye contact with him, face unreadable. It’s infuriating.
Two spots over, Ron huddles under a violently orange Chudley Cannons towel and a peach-striped umbrella, grumbling about the terrors of the midday sun.
“No, thank you.”
Hermione stills behind her. The air suddenly feels uncompromisingly heavy in a room already filled with the humidity of the bathwater and the burning incense of Luna’s choosing.
“Eat the mint.”
There’s a roar above them and Draco’s not sure if it’s Harry screaming for him or the engine coming alive in a bloom of fire, but he seems flames and smoke and before he knows it there are strong hands hauling him over the back of the bike and the foal is there, seated in Harry’s lap like a too-large hairless cat, looking waterlogged but breathing.
Impatient, Draco nips the scar, shifts his body, and straddles Harry's lap, encircling them both with his wings. It blocks out the roar of the waves against the rocks behind them, allowing only the dim light of the house lamp above the balcony doors and the smell of the salt air to permeate the soft shield of his feathers.
“What?” Potter raises his head a fraction off the back of his chair.
“Potter, yes.”
“My word,” Xenophilius breathes, watching this exchange. “He’s improved.”
“One must always be prepared for a party, Harry.”
“My mother would sing to us about this place at bedtime,” Narcissa says, remembering the haunting lullaby and tales of the utopia far across the sea that she and her sisters loved to listen to as children. She’d thought it a mere fairytale. “No one can be harmed within its wards.”
“Oh, that isn’t necess—”
“Cameron, what the fuck?”
Yet, as consequence would have it, here Harry is, loitering outside Malfoy’s flat and imagining him growing figs and biting into their ripe flesh with sharp white teeth.
Draco’s words cut through the fog of anxiety in her mind and she nods. Daring to look up, she catches her son’s fierce, preternatural eyes glaring at her and sits straighter on instinct. “I can.”
“I’d never let you fall,” Harry promises and kisses him again, warm and soft and filled with reassurance, before pulling back to watch the wind play havoc with Draco’s hair.
“DRACO!”
“He seems to have forgotten how,” Hermione tells him. “It’s the Veela.”
Draco looks at him, his hair flopping back into his eyes. Hermione can practically feel the disdain through his expression at having to mentally repeat himself.
Draco’s lip quivers as he clings to the poor shivering beast in his arms, refusing to let her go. She’s just as cold as he is, her muzzle buried in Draco’s neck under the fall of his soaked hair, seeking warmth he doesn’t currently possess. He conjures a towel, and then another, wrapping the young thing in their fuzzy warmth, cooing at her, soothing her. Just off to the side behind a drowned-looking Charlie, the Thestral’s mother paws at the dirt, uneasy and anxious.
“Love you!” Hermione calls as Ron blows him kisses and shouts, “
“Can you leave this?” she asks, nodding to Hermione’s work. Tomorrow, over tea, she’ll attempt to tell Hermione what she knows. Breakfast is always the best time of day to share new information with Hermione.
,” he says, desperate, quick and heated against Harry’s overheated skin. “I used to hate you. I wanted you gone. Erased from my memory. Then I realised that I was so affected by you because I
at the
Malfoy snorts, smoke exhaling from his nostrils much like his namesake. “This is the mere tip of the iceberg, Potter.”
Hermione smiles at him, knowingly and without judgement, before turning to watch her children through the back door.
Harry sits up, pulling Draco with him, bracing a hand behind him for support as Draco gets his legs around him, balanced on the bed. Their bodies are so close they slip against each other with mingled sweat.
“‘Course,” Harry says, nuzzling against Draco’s throat.
“Yes. Fine. You are making me very upset. Happy?”
“Oh shit.” Harry scrubs a hand through his hair, his mind racing. He fumbles as he rips at his belt; he can’t get his flies open fast enough when Draco’s looking at him like that. This had been his idea, but Draco has taken the reins and Harry needs desperately to catch up.
,” she urges, “can’t have you standing out here all day pining, now can we? Unless, of course, you’ve prepared a serenade? I won’t interrupt you if so.”
“Stop what?”
Luna opens her eyes, coming out of her trance. “Oh?” She looks down. “Hermione, what happened?”
“Why? You were going to hit me.”
“Stop that.”
Harry felt torn. Malfoy had always possessed an obvious flair for drama, but something was clearly affecting him. He wasn’t acting, he was severely distressed and Harry couldn’t just be expected to stand there and
Draco feels Harry approach even before he scents him on the wind. There’s a whirling in his belly, a brewing tempest of emotion that matches the storm gathering strength just offshore along the purple horizon. The sun has just slipped behind the endless blue of the sea and Draco breathes in the crisp air of dusk as night quickly approaches, along with Harry’s footsteps. He takes the final sip of the tea Mipsy brought him and looks over his shoulder.
“Oi!”
Behind them, Cecilia crows with joy and runs down the hall, shouting loudly and expressively in Italian for Cameron to come see the happy couple. Harry has no time to bother listening to their excitement, he’s too busy pulling Draco in for a kiss.
He shifts his focus to the tease that is Potter’s body, lying next to him, a fragile facade of relaxation that Draco knows to be false. He’s seen Potter with his guard down, with his limbs easy and loose, lounging next to him on his balcony railing, eyes flashing with heat. He knows the way Potter looks when he’s in repose. This isn’t it, yet Draco can’t help but drink it in, eagerly surveying all that is exposed to him, every line of longitude drawn across his skin, every shimmering star.
Cecilia floats back out of his room, thank Circe, and Draco waves his wand to clean the mess he’s made of his bathroom. He covers himself up in a silk kimono robe his mother sent him from Japan last summer, runs his fingers through his shock of bed-head in an attempt to tame it, and walks down the hall to the sitting room. He stops short at the sight of Potter curled up like a stray kitten on their loveseat with Cameron seated upright at the far end, head slumped over the back of the couch, snoring. He’s holding onto Potter’s bare ankle in a gentle embrace that sets Draco’s teeth on edge.
Malfoy shot up from his seat, hovering awkward and anxious near Harry, his magic crackling off of him in wild, unchecked ripples. Harry watched the yellow and purple sparks of magic bounce back off the gleaming tile beneath them with unease, wondering if he was seeing things.
“Yes, I spotted that,” Hermione says, handing Luna a cup of tea with a splash of firewhisky. They’re both freshly showered, hair twisted up in towels and clothed in matching silk robes. It’s been nearly an hour since Harry suggested they head in.
“Let me,” he tells him, kissing his temple, and Draco sighs, burying his face into Harry’s neck as Harry begins to move at a languid pace–long, smooth strokes.
Draco tells him, right before he plucks him up and lays him down across an elongated boulder, sodden and frigid to the touch. Harry’s skin practically sizzles against the coolness of the granite as he settles, his head tilting back past the curve of the rock’s edge. Draco hovers over him, wings spread, hair a glowing halo of silver light surrounding his face. The waves crash around them, sending up sea spray, only to fall back down on them like rain.
Bill raises a ginger eyebrow in Draco’s direction. “Harry?”
It breaks the moment between them. Draco looks away, retreating into himself. He pulls the cloak around him tighter and shifts against the wall, one large wing extending to hide his face from view. Harry halts its path, then smooths down the ruffled feathers with a gentle, sure touch—an apology in a gesture.
“Getting your attention,” Harry whispers, and tugs hard, pressing his open mouth to Draco’s.
“I suspected.”
its long tail now curling around to the palm of Harry’s hand—normally rested out of sight along the back of Harry’s left knee, and had done since the age of sixteen, when Harry’s goal of following Malfoy everywhere around their school ended in a pool of blood on the bathroom floor. He was certain that his obsessive, reckless behaviour was the reason for Draco’s constellation becoming a feature on his body, even though he'd never quite figured out the logic behind the markings. For a while, Hermione was convinced they were some kind of celestial map complete with clues to help defeat Voldemort, but Harry instinctively knew that theory to be a false one. The constellations came and went just as the people that they represented came into and out of Harry’s life.
, what now?” She huffs.
. A rare magical affliction that manifests itself around puberty and hasn’t been documented in the Wizarding community since The Statute of Secrecy was signed into law in 1692. Magical beings bestowed with
Harry closes his eyes and revels in relief as the fat droplets pepper his overheated skin. Wet hands press down hard and smooth along his chest, dragging teasing nails over his torso and tugging his pants off his legs.
“So,” Harry says, shoving back from the bar and attempting to stand. He stumbles into Draco’s shoulder, who laughs and holds Harry steady with his large, beautiful hands that are always so, so warm.
“Where did Dee go?” she asks, looking about.
He’s charmed and feeling wistful as he strolls onto the tucked-away
“Fuck. I want him back, Luna.” His voice cracks on the words, filled with anguish. She closes her eyes at the sound, hating the world for taking yet another person from her Harry—for taking Draco from him.
He bursts out of the church into the night, gasping for breath, leaving the smells of incense and candle wax behind him. He leans down, hands on his knees, panting; his magic thrumming just under the surface like a shiver he can’t shake.
, Draco says, and Harry turns his head upward to look at Draco’s face, alarmed at hearing him speak. But the mask is still in place and those silver eyes of his stare out ahead of him, and Harry wonders if he somehow imagined the words.
The moment lingers as the waves crash just beyond their cocoon of intimacy. Feeling sluggish and weighted by the heat of the night, Harry struggles to stand from his seat on the chaise, his legs unsteady. Draco’s wings wrap around him, collecting at the small of Harry’s back, helping him up. Draco’s looking down at him, his eyes dark and coaxing. Harry’s drawn in by them, by a magnetism he’s never been able to name.
“What is it?” she asks, moving forward quickly, her book forgotten by the early evening fire.
. . .
Draco crows, his head flying back as his hips stutter with his orgasm. Harry feels the rhythmic pulse of it as Draco releases into Harry’s mouth, the sea-salt tang of his come coating his tongue.
They step through into another world, landing on the marble steps of the city forum, surveying the splendour around them with matching expressions of awe. Xenophilius guides Narcissa to a sprawling, gleaming temple along a river, showing her the way as if he were giving her a tour of his own lands.
Remus was tall and thin like Grandpa Arcturus, with that same sort of been sick for a long time feel to him. Despite that, he moved like he was dangerous and very, very strong. His wand was out. The snarl revealed elongated canine teeth. And his eyes glowed gold as he paced.
So desperate. The blessing ached to do the right thing, to find the right influences. It wanted nothing more, if a magic spell could want anything, than to do the right thing.
"To kill," Harry corrected.
The battle between his magic and his lycanthropy was going to kill him if the curses didn't.
He was wearing an apron covered with tiny, embroidered strawberries connected by pale pink ribbons stitched down by hand. The ruffles were huge compared to Dobby's scrawny frame. On Aunt Petunia, they were perfectly perky and highly stylish. Or at least that's what Aunt Petunia would claim when she had a bridge party or when Uncle Vernon invited someone from work over to have dinner.
Five minutes passed. Then ten. Twenty. As the clock struck the half hour and Professor McGonagall started pacing and cursing under her breath, a shiver of lavender and puce magic cascaded up and out of Amal. It dissipated like mist torn to shreds by a strong gale, then Amal's magic swept over the room in a surge that was warm and soft and laughing.
Stepping out of the floo into Malfoy Manor was like leaping from a hot sauna into a snowy bank. The magic felt so incredibly different from Potter Keep that Draco's breath caught for the force of it. He breathed carefully as Mother stepped through with Grandfather Arcturus on her heels, letting Mother clean the ash from his robes.
Draco's breath caught all over again, this time because his heart pounded so hard that the world went grey and Ivy's face was a distant blob viewed through a long, echoing tunnel. He wheezed, sucking air into his lungs as he held Ivy's hands. She clung to him as desperately as he clung to her.
"No," Dobby said. "Is the wand. All young wizard and witch wands have the Trace. They is not able to check anything else. Would not know that magic happens here unless Dobby tells them with his magic that it happened. If is quiet wish, just us, just here, just this, is safe. Master does not know. His blind to all but his Bad Master. Mistress may feel if she is not potioned. Little Master will not know but may dream of it. Ministry cannot feel Master Harry Potter's magic if no wand. They is able to tell Elf magic from wizard magic. Especially young wizard wish magic."
"Darn it," Harry said.
To Harry's surprise, Tippy giggled before he disappeared. With the cloak. Harry's stomach lurched.
To Draco's surprise, Mr. Parkinson barked a laugh. "Her mother taught her that hex as soon as she got her wand, Malfoy. She made sure that I and my brothers all watched as Pansy mastered it."
"Master?" Ivy popped over to pat Draco's shoulder. "Is Master Draco all right? You looks like you sees something."
"Such interesting timing," Grandpa Arcturus said with a scowl that could've stripped the paint off the walls if they'd had any paint. As it was, Harry was kind of worried that Grandpa Arcturus was going to set fire to the wood paneling any second now.
The magic laughed all around them. The stars danced and flashed through the colors of the rainbow. The runes under Draco's knees flared so bright that if he'd shut his eyes, they would still be visible, burning with magic so strong that nothing human could have channeled it.
"That was before Lord Black sent a message asking us to visit," Draco said. "At 10:30. In… oh, fifteen minutes."
He passed it over to Grandfather Arcturus and Mother who both studied the ritual carefully. It was a more complex one, the very last in the book. Draco knew, just from scanning it, that it would be horribly difficult to accomplish.
Harry gritted his teeth. "And I thought I couldn't hate Snape any more than I already did."
"Well, he doesn't need to control the Book," Harry said. "He needs to keep people from touching magic like Draco and I did."
He shut his eyes as all the elves bowed their heads, even Ivy. Draco took a deep breath and then let it out slowly. First the Elves. Then Father. He would figure this out.
Harry blew out a breath and rubbed a hand over his face.
The Hogwarts wards rippled out near the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Harry could see magic impacting them, hammering away on them, but the attack obviously wasn't doing a bit of good. But wow, there were a lot of people outside the wards trying to get in. Croaker and Silverclaw must've brought in a literal army of people to try and bring the wards down.
"At least Master should have called us," Ivy said, hands on her hips as she glared at Draco. "You is not supposed to be fighting by youselves!"
Harry grinned. "Let us scan you and then we'll head through to Malfoy Manor. Or eat and then go. The sooner we're all safe, the better. We still gotta plot to take Dumbledore down, you know."
The flames roared up and Draco followed her through with a handful of floo powder of his own. Security really did have to come first. So many of his cousins, aunts, uncles, and more distant relatives followed the Dark Lord. They needed to have a secure place. No matter what else might be going on, safety came first.
Draco looked over his shoulder to Harry who nodded. "That seems to be accurate. It's certainly not a spell or a ritual or anything. Just… gentleness and acceptance and the blessing comes off."
"We'll go set up the tent and work with them," Bill promised. "Then maybe you can explain everything over dinner."
Yes. It could! Harry huffed a silent laugh, grinning at Dobby.
"I won't let him control me anymore," Harry declared. "I won't let him control you, either."
Not at all.
"Yeah," Amal agreed. He downed his tea in three quick gulps and then flipped to a new piece of paper where he started making lists. "We'll need to see if you can claim your family magic. You can't take the title, of course. You're too young. That has to wait until you're sixteen. But you can get your heir's rings."
Dumbledore didn't care if Harry lived as long as Harry did what Dumbledore wanted. So no, that soul anchor was going away. No, he was not going to be the desperate, scared, ignorant kid Dumbledore wanted. He wasn't going to be alone.
Harry poked Draco's shoulder. "He's your grandfather, too, you know. Well, great-grandfather but still. You can call him Grandpa, not sir or Lord or something."
Mr. Parkinson's jaw dropped open just a hair which was a huge response for a man like him. "He didn't ask."
"Why were you such a prat?" Harry asked. "I mean, you're fine now. We're sitting here and not at each other's throats at all."
Harry's joy surged through the bond, capturing Draco's attention. It pulled his mind away from Fake Dumbledore and back to the waves of magic radiating out from Malfoy Manor's labyrinth.
"I'm fine!" Hermione protested in vain because the elves popped out and then a blanket popped in on her lap and a tea service with a full meal showed up on the coffee table between the squashy sofas a moment after that. "Oh, seriously, I'm fine."
"Do have some common sense, Potter," Draco drawled.
Harry nodded. "Sounds about right to me. Though I'd love to see them thrown in jail. And Dudley to be raised by someone completely different. I mean, he got smacked around, too, though not as much as I did."
"No," Harry said with a little snort and a side-long look that was far too amused.
"It's not hard," Harry said. "Seriously, you just kind of… focus inwards on the way your magic moves through you. Like when you're learning a new spell and you need to feel the way the magic flows through you? That sort of thing. But instead of aiming at learning something you're just feeling the way the magic moves in you. For me, it's kind of like a river that flows."
"This… this the City, Dobby," Harry whispered, tugging Dobby off to the side so that the many, many men in suits wouldn't run right over them. "Uncle Vernon said that this is the heart of all banking in London!"
"I need you to anchor me there," Draco said. He huffed and rubbed his head. "I'm suddenly very, very glad I had the chance to hold the Dark Lord in. It's making a lovely practice run for keeping Dumbledore out."
Draco seemed almost impatient with Harry's ignorance, frowning at Harry, but he waved off Hermione's beliefs readily enough. Draco huffed as he scooted back so that he could hook his legs over the arm of his chair, leaning back into the corner made by the arm of the chair and the seatback with his arms crossed over his chest.
Draco nodded thoughtfully, rubbing the small of his back and stretching until something cracked so hard that it echoed in the quiet hallway.
"Harry, I need you to breathe for me," Amal said right in Harry's ear. "Come on, deep breath. Suck a breath in for me, Harry, please!"
The magic that had given him Draco.
Tippy's ears came up. His eyes went wide. Then he nodded towards the cloak.
Hedwig was gone, out the window or something. One of Dobby's pants pockets bulged a little, so he must have shrunk the cage and Harry's trunk. Dobby took Harry's hand and they snuck down the stairs together since Dobby had already checked the wards, last night, and seen that he couldn't pop Harry in or out without letting Dumbledore know exactly what had happened.
Draco raised his chin and nodded firmly at Harry like he had absolute confidence that Harry could handle this. He even smiled a little bit, a proud smile that sent a shiver up Harry's spine. So, maybe? Maybe Harry could handle it. He kind of had to. No way was he going to leave a bit of Voldemort in his scar, even if Dumbledore seemed to think it was no big deal.
Harry didn't get to hear anything else because Amal pulled him away and down the hallway. They went down a long flight of stairs with torches lit not quite often enough for Harry to be certain of his footing, down a long hallway that was carved out of solid rock and then through six huge vault doors separated by caverns that had doors leading in every direction. Even up.
"The reason is named Dumbledore," Harry agreed. "Seriously, Ron. He's my soulmate. I will drop you like a hot potato if you keep this up."
"Oh!" Harry breathed as a brilliant smile bloomed on his face. And Dobby's, too. "Hedwig!"
None of which compared to the library.
"No, it's the tent," Harry said, blushing. "I should have asked Dobby to set up beds for them or something. That's…"
From both of them.
Who knew? It might be true. Draco certainly didn't know how Dumbledore had interfered with the soul bond. He just knew, right down to his core, that Dumbledore had done it. Somehow.
Which, come to think of it, meant that they hadn't been truly before Dumbledore's day. They'd been current and normal and just the way things worked when Dumbledore was a kid. So this was all what Dumbledore grew up with.
"No," Draco groaned. "Ivy…!"
Draco had felt Grandfather Arcturus' agitation the instant he came through the floo. Harry had felt it a moment later through their bond. No one was ever going to get the drop of the two of them, at least not if they were sufficiently focused and aware of what was happening around them.
They'd broken Dumbledore's power with one of the rituals in the book. Maybe there was another that would help. Hermione came over to read over Draco's shoulder, pursing her lips when Harry grinned at her. Ivy giggled and popped the red copy of the book in so that Hermione could read that one with Neville reading over her shoulder.
They'd asked for what they needed which might not be Dumbledore himself. Draco could only hope that it wouldn't be the horrible old man. He'd rather break a prayer circle or something than fight a grown man who'd caused thousands upon thousands of deaths all across the magical world.
"I know a lovely little charm that will make lightning spark between your hands if someone removes whatever you're holding," Draco offered with a smirk that was pure evil.
Especially when Professor McGonagall casually mentioned the soulbond and both of them reacted as if they'd been slapped.
"I don't know how to do that," Hermione protested.
He let Harry drag him over to Grandfather Arcturus' side despite the churning of his stomach making him a bit light-headed and queasy. At least there weren't any remnants of Dumbledore's magic on Grandfather Arcturus.
"If you take the Honeydukes entrance," Remus said, tracing it on the map and smiling as various warnings about dangers appeared on its surface, including one that flashed red about the Hogwarts wards being set to dangerously high levels, "you'll be deep enough that the wards won't immediately kill you. I could take the Shrieking Shack entrance. I don't think anyone else could. Perhaps you could, Minerva, but I don't trust that he wouldn't have set the wards to recognize you."
But do ask, the bond whispered where no one else could hear it but Draco.
"…Point."
It didn't hurt. If anything, Draco's magic surged to meet Tippy's, singing with excitement that came through Harry who was echoing the same sensation through their bond.
"…Pewter goblets are an insult?" Harry asked while blinking at Draco in confusion.
"Ron will do something stupid if I don't let him know that I'm not at Privet Drive," Harry said. "Besides, Dumbledore already knows I'm not there. That's the whole point of all this. I reckon that Bill will take this to Ron. He might, well, probably he'll tell Dumbledore that I sent it."
"People really need to pay more attention to the elves," Harry complained. "I mean, really? Lilac knew something was wrong. Dobby did, too. All I had to do was work with him and poof, a zillion problems started getting solved."
Mother huffed as if asking that was cheating, which it was. "Very well, darling."
"We'll figure it out because you're you," Draco said. "You just don't give up. You don't give in. You keep hammering at a problem until you figure out how to deal with it. I don't know how you do it, but you do. So yes, we'll figure it out. Somehow. Tomorrow."
Harry grumbled as he leaned back against the wall with his arms crossed over his chest. "Not fair."
"What is the most important thing Dumbledore does?" Draco asked. "Not his titles. His positions. His actual actions. What the most important action that Dumbledore takes?"
"She did?" Harry asked, blinking at Dobby.
Magic like stars filled everything. His hair, his eyes, his body, the world, everything was magic. Draco shuddered and bit his lip. Stars erupted from the pain and drifted upwards towards the sapphire and forest green sky with its millions upon millions of dancing stars.
Cooper, Lord Black's personal elf, stood waiting for them. He was rather pale, a bit too pale, really, but he looked much better than the last time Draco had been to visit. His ears weren't sagging right down to his shoulders. His uniform was clean and properly pressed, the black tea towel fabric no longer wrinkled and worn looking.
"What?" Draco asked.
Draco grimaced. "Werewolves can, in fact, survive almost anything which doesn't immediately decapitate them. The part I find appalling is that Dumbledore was willing to sacrifice an ally on a suicide mission."
"I think we should let him in," Amal said. He held up his hands when both Grandpa Arcturus and Mrs. Malfoy glared at him. "Look, seriously now, he's Lily's best friend. He's not gonna hurt Harry. The wards are incredible. We can keep him out more or less forever or we can let him in and learn what's going on. I think it's worth the risk."
The person who'd arrived was beyond the ward's ability to detect. Draco could feel that they were tall, probably masculine though whoever it was could also be an exceptionally tall and muscular woman. Their voice was a harsh distortion of a mid-range tenor.
"Can we…?"
"Who died?" Draco asked.
Down this passage. Down the next one. To the ward room.
"Tippy thanks Masters," Tippy said.
Draco pulled up and away, leaning on his elbow to stare at Harry who blinked up at him. "You say no."
He couldn't see them. He couldn’t see anything. His eyes were open, but his eyes didn't see.
That finally got Draco on his feet. He groaned and stretched before sauntering through the door connecting his Slytherin green and silver suite to Harry's very Ravenclaw blue and bronze suite.
"Right," Harry said as he chanted "it's fine they're fine" in his head. "Let's go."
Words spluttered out, leaving Harry red-faced and furious and flailing his hands like Uncle Vernon when his face went purple with rage at something Harry had done. Hopefully, his face wasn't purple like that. It would be so embarrassing.
"All of those things… feel familiar, Draco," Harry said, frowning. He tapped the display again and yes, all of them had the same magical signature. "That's… I'd swear that it's Dumbledore."
"Harry!" Draco gasped. He scrambled on hands and knees, catching Harry's face. "Let go! The wards are locked. We're here. Focus on me, not them."
Harry nodded. He grabbed Grandpa Arcturus for a bear hug that made him wheeze, then looked over at Amal who was a little bit pale but who grinned encouragingly at Harry while holding two thumbs up. Mrs. Malfoy smiled gently at Harry. She had her hands clasped in front of her chest like she was praying.
"Master does, too," Dobby agreed.
"Who gave it to you?" Draco asked so fiercely that Harry pulled the cloak off and held it away from his body.
Dobby pulled Harry back over to the bench where he'd been told to sit. It was another soot-colored wooden bench. It was not, actually, coated with soot though it apparently had been seared rather than being varnished. Harry tried not to dig his fingernails into the wood as he watched and waited and fretted.
"A… blue… phoenix?" Draco asked even as he shook Harry awake.
Harry sat bolt upright, nearly spilling the remaining half of his hot chocolate right down his front. As Harry stared at her, Draco sighed and snagged his mug, putting it with his on the tray to be taken away. Then Draco raised an enquiring eyebrow at Harry.
Just like Harry.
"Do you trust Professor McGonagall not to turn you back into Dumbledore?" Draco asked. "She's not at Hogwarts right now. I believe she has a home in Hogsmead. If anyone would be able to handle this transfiguration, she would."
"How are you handling this, darling?" Mother asked. "Tell me the truth. The wards must be a disaster. Your father and grandfather refused to allow anyone else to touch them."
He trusted Harry.
Her eyebrows both went up the instant she spotted Dobby's badge.
Harry's head went back at the word "abusive". For a second, Draco expected that Harry was going to start shouting denials of the truth that Draco had seen with his own eyes. But Harry didn't.
Actually, he would have to make sure that the wards rejected anyone tainted by Dumbledore's magic, too. It was the only way to be absolutely sure that they were safe.
Harry nodded. "Yeah, I get that. Used to do that a lot when Aunt Petunia would send me to my cupboard without meals. It never quite worked, though."
Harry stared at him for a long while and then shook his head. "I really don't like Dumbledore."
"You can't be serious," Draco asked in a much more shocked tone. "There haven't been any soul bonds in Britain in decades."
"Abuse," Harry agreed. "I can't remember ever being able to relax. In my whole life. It's only since I stole Dobby and came here that I've started to relax."
"We will," Draco promised as he hauled Harry away.
"It won't work," Draco shouted.
"No, Mother," Draco agreed.
They looped around the altar at the center of the amphitheater, so close that Harry could have reached out to touch it if he dared. The magic crackling around it, black and red and evil, made that altar as far away as the moon despite its physical proximity. Where he'd gone around the outside of the Malfoy labyrinth and worked his way inwards, Dumbledore's labyrinth was the exact opposite. They started at the center and looped their way outwards through four turns before they took the last straight approach to the heart.
"I will," Draco promised. "But I can't rest until those damned artifacts are gone. Literally. I will lose control over the wards if I relax too much. Stay here. And let the healer help you. That's an order."
Thank you for reading--I hope you enjoyed the story!
"Um, that there are strangers here," Harry said thoughtfully as he kind of poked magically at the wards. "That there's stuff that needs to be done, but I can't figure out what it is. Something… I guess it needs to change? Or go away? I can't tell. The wards aren't clear about what they want."
He pulled, pulled as hard as he could with his broken hands and his magic and his soul, dragging Harry back out of the wild magic that was the heart of the ritual. At the same time, Draco felt Dobby pulling on his bond to Harry and Mrs. Weasley shouting as she tried to rouse Fred and George.
"Huh," Harry grunted.
"You could tell?" Harry asked.
"That's a very good point, darling," Mrs. Malfoy said. "We should be working on that. Though I don't know that it would be wise for us to leave until Malfoy Manor is properly secure."
He drank it without blowing the flame out and then blew several smoke rings while glaring at the ceiling far overhead.
Draco contented himself with two steps at a time, but he didn't go much slower than Harry did. Once on the battlements, it was easier to see that there were a host of redheads in the Ford Anglia. It must have expansion spells on the inside because Draco thought he saw seven redheads and a bush of brown hair that had to be Hermione.
Harry answered.
The wards told Draco why. The only thing that had kept Father alive was the weak support he got from the family magic. Once that left him, Father's entire body, all his organs, collapsed and his core fractured under the Dark Lord's punishment.
Yeah, Dumbledore had definitely gotten to Remus. What Harry didn't know was what to do about that. He turned to Grandpa Arcturus who was just red-faced and huffing now, not swearing a blue streak.
More than likely, Draco should go out and make sure that Mother was all right. He should definitely talk to Grandfather Arcturus about how the Malfoy family would fit into the larger Black family, now. There were a dozen things that he needed to do back home at Malfoy Manor. Just the audit of their finances would probably take a full day's effort when Silverclaw was ready for him.
Grandpa Arcturus breathed slowly, eyes shimmering with his magic like he was as angry as Harry was.
He pulled out the cloak and covered himself and then pulled Draco under its shimmery veil. The world always looked a bit odd from under the cloak. It was heavy enough to hang well around the two of them, but his eyes were convinced he was looking through spiderwebs that had been coated with tiny drops of dew. Small ones that just barely caught the light when it hit just right.
But Dobby and Ivy and Cooper all saw magic as fully and totally alive. It was as alive as they were, or Harry was.
"That looks familiar," Harry whispered. "Really familiar."
"May I help you?" the woman asked.
"But!" Harry protested even though his feet were already running over to Grandpa Arcturus' side.
How bad had her abuse been in private that Mother's magic responded to the mere presence of another like a threat?
Draco huffed and shook his head. "Well, I wish them both much joy together then. Dobby was always a handful. A very loud, very energetic, very slippery handful."
"Very brightly," Draco agreed. "You might want to stop that. The wards at Black Manor might have issues with you blowing up the library."
"Darling, I thought you were going to bed," Mother said the instant he walked into the kitchen hand-in-hand with Ivy.
Harry stared at the note for a long moment before passing it to Draco even though Professor McGonagall held her hand out to take it. Draco read it, frowning. He saw the exact moment that Draco reached the crossed-out torrid affair bit because Draco went beet red as his eyebrows flew up towards his hairline and then he slapped the letter against his chest.
"Yes," Draco agreed slowly while glaring at Moody. "I know. That's why I've been trying to get you people to come to Father's office with me. How many times do you have to ask how Father died? He was tortured to death by the Dark Lord. His core fractured and his heart stopped. Everyone's agreed on that. All your spells show that. Mother agrees. I agree. You agree. Can we please go take care of those artifacts now that we all agree?"
But it was and it did and there was nothing Draco could do but stare and pant and try to breathe through the pain that felt like it was tearing his heart out.
Which was a problem for another day.
"Darling!" Mrs. Malfoy gasped. "You need to rest."
While Father and his other grandfather had never been religious at all, the vast majority of the Malfoy family had been devout followers of Lady Magic going back to the founding of the family. Draco, personally, had always found the little rituals they kept in Slytherin to be comforting in the extreme.
Somehow.
Magic crackled across the lawn, whipping the grass and trees like a gale was coming in. Draco froze so Harry froze with him. It took him a moment to see what had stopped Draco in his tracks, but then he saw it.
"Well, sure," Harry said even though Remus started growling and Mrs. Malfoy looked horrified. "I mean, Amal's got reams of notes on all the stuff I went through. It's pretty darn obvious that Dumbledore doesn't care if I live or die long term. I think I'm supposed to survive just long enough to be a useful tool for him. I just don't know what I'm supposed to be useful for."
His invisibility cloak billowed around Harry as he slipped into Honeydukes with an indulgent mother with a little girl who bore a disturbing resemblance to Dudley about to pitch a fit. The girl immediately ran off to start grabbing candy just like Dudley would have.
"And Mr. Swashlin," Draco agreed. "Plus Silverclaw. We… might be able to get out of it. I think we still have a couple of hours left before it's too late. Maybe. If the contract isn't cancelled within seventy-two hours of my father's death, it's considered to be ratified unchanged. Then the penalty clauses would be… quite horrific."
"The secrecy of making the attempt is important," Harry said as he ran on wobbly legs and got the thin little prayer books. "We can take these with us. Dobby, can you pack up everything we'll need? And are you sure he'll follow us, Draco? I mean, we could summon the Goblins, couldn't we?"
He was bigger than he seemed lying down, easily six foot plus. Very skinny, though, like he hadn't been able to eat enough for a long, long time.
"Damn it," Remus huffed. He plopped back in his chair, pouting as he refused to meet everyone's eyes.
"Dobby can do that," Dobby promised. "She be happy to leave here."
Draco licked his lips and decided to let that one go for now. He could feel Harry's curiosity about what Peter / Scabbers meant to Remus, about what could make Remus lose control in such a dramatic fashion, but they did have a bigger problem to deal with.
"Oh, chocolate," Harry said. "Thank you very much, ma'am."
"We cut our way," Harry said, straightening his spine and, by necessity, Draco's too. "Right. Well, we've done worse. Let's get to it. We only have a few minutes."
The animal sound of his agony was worse than even Mother's cries of fear. There was nothing human in those bellows, no language in his babbling, his begging, his occasional wails as the Dark Lord tormented him.
Draco grunted, finally turning to face Harry fully. "They can show you what's wrong, Potter. Visually. The spell is ostende mihi. Focus on the wards. Focus on the warnings they're giving you. And then say the words. You'll get a visual representation of the wards with information on what's bothering them."
"I have no idea how we're going to do that for everyone else in Britain," Grandfather Arcturus complained, yawning hugely in the middle of "Britain".
"Because if he doesn't know that I'm gone from Privet Drive he's likely to get the twins to help him do something rash and stupid," Harry explained. "Ron fancies himself my best mate. He's very invested in me. I don't doubt that he'd do something stupid and I know the twins would help him if only so that they could tease him about it later."
"No," Dobby said as he wrapped both of his hands around Harry's wrist. He moved Harry's hand so that it rested against the dirty pillowcase Dobby wore. "But a great wizard can steal Dobby. If Dobby helps, if the great wizard tries with his whole heart, if Dobby and the Great Harry Potter wish with all their hearts, the bond can… move."
Dobby's frown shifted from disapproving to confused for a moment. Then he clambered up on the bed, patting the air around Draco's body. After a few seconds, Dobby nodded. A few seconds more and Dobby grinned and bounced on the bed just like he always did whenever Father wasn't around for a few days or weeks.
He pressed his forehead against Harry's cheek and smiled as the exhaustion, the energy, the weird flow between them settled into something much more comfortable. Not all the energy leaving Draco and none coming back, but the two of them creating a pool between them that settled still and calm and warm around them.
"Right," Harry whispered as he shook his head. "Stop being a coward and do this. Simple prayer, walk through the labyrinth. Get Lady Magic or whoever to help us save everyone. Or at least prove that this works. Or not. Either way. Walking. One foot in front of the other. I can do that. Yeah."
"Easily that," Professor McGonagall agreed. "The last record I found of it being used was over two hundred and fifty years ago. It's likely sadly degraded. The next closest ritual circle is over a hundred miles away. It has to be the ward room."
"Colonization," Harry said, nodding. "Yeah, duh. What we're dealing with is a human style of magic?"
"Do you know of a way to cure lycanthropy, Dobby?" Amal asked even though it was blatantly impossible to do so. "I mean, the curses are designed to stick to a werewolf. If Remus wasn't a werewolf, then we could get the curses off easy."
"Oh, stop it," Harry huffed as he pulled himself free. "We've taken precautions and frankly, I don't think she'd have waited if she was a threat."
"I'll write up the oath," Grandfather Arcturus said with a frustrated growl. "But you boys need to understand that even this might not work."
He flicked his wand out of his wrist holster, grinning when Draco eyed his arm to try and see what sort of holster it was. Moody helped Draco off to the side and then made sure that he stayed vertical as the Unspeakables moved in to trap the Dark Lord's shade and box up the artifacts.
"No, none of that," Harry said, wagging a finger in Draco's face. "It will work. We'll do it. We'll free at least some people. Then we'll do it again and again and again until we free everyone."
Moody frowned. They'd separated Draco from Mother about half an hour after they arrived. The entire investigation had been nothing but questions and doubt and Draco attempting to hold his temper. Between his hunger and exhaustion, Mother's pain, and the lingering aura of those horrible dark artifacts in Father's office, Draco wasn't sure just how much longer he could handle this.
"I'll go through first," Draco offered even though he blatantly, obviously, clearly did not want to.
Silence fell. His cheeks went hot as Mother frowned at him. Draco squared his shoulders and put his hands on the table, carefully not pressing so hard that his knuckles went white. Confidence. He needed to show confidence on this.
"Dumbledore made my parents hide," Harry said, ticking things off on his fingers. "Dumbledore is Voldemort's greatest enemy, the one person he fears, but he's never tracked him down and stopped him. Dumbledore was Supreme Mugwump, right? Chief Warlock, too. He could've gone after Voldemort with all the power of the Ministry and the ICW behind him."
"It hurts," Remus replied. His voice was even lower, deeper and more growly than before. "It hurts and hurts, and we can't destroy it."
"Master Draco needs Ivy?" Ivy asked. She smiled at him, patted Harry's knee and gave Hermione a little curtsey. "What does Master Draco need?"
"Do you think there is a way to save everyone?" Harry asked after a long couple of minutes where they just held each other and relaxed under the warm weight of the blankets.
"I bet," Harry said, grinning at Dobby. "I asked the ward stone, or maybe I asked Lady Magic or something, if there was a way to take control of the blessing back from Dumbledore. The ward stone wants me to cut my finger on the edge here. Good idea, bad idea? Get an adult idea? Do it and ask forgiveness afterwards? What do you think?"
"Bad Dumbles is out fighting," Tippy said, eyes wide. "Is laughing. Is saying that no one can stop him, that is all wasted effort because has already done his spell. He is not able to see the cloak. Is not able to see what is under it. Is not able to see you."
Moody's whirling eye disappeared down a grey, echoing tunnel. He dove in and caught Draco's shoulders, shaking Draco until Draco wheezed and glared at him. There was sweat on Moody's forehead and his magical eye didn't whirl at all as he stared at Draco.
"It feels familiar," Draco agreed. "Let's go. There's no time to think, no time to plot. We'll have to use Gryffindor brazen stupidity to get through this."
The real point was a bit harder. Properly set up and maintained wards could forbid undesired people access to the property either by foot or floo or Apparation or broom. Even portkeys could be blocked. Draco struggled for a bit to get the wards to refuse access to anyone who had the taint of the Dark Lord's magic on their core.
"No, just trying to shift my awareness of Mother's curse damage so that it stops… distracting me," Draco said as he waved one hand towards the door. He didn't open his eyes. "She's in a great deal of pain."
Harry spent the whole time being ritually purified with spells and special water and mist and things giggling over Draco's gobsmacked expression. Off on the other side of the room, Draco kept spluttering about it more, from what Harry could feel through the bond, because it was making Harry laugh than anything else.
"What about Amal?" Harry asked with a grin.
"Oh, I know that," Harry said with a wave of his hand. "I figured that out ages ago, this morning, really. There's no way I can trust him or Hermione anymore. Which is irrelevant. Sending the letter will make Dumbledore think that I want to keep Ron as my friend. He'll like that. He was very invested in our friendship last year."
Both Grandpa Arcturus and Mrs. Malfoy had moved off to the end of the hallway to talk in whispers about what to do when, not if, Remus failed to escape Dumbledore's control. Rude. He could still do it. Maybe. If he stopped running in circles like a puppy chasing its tail.
No matter what it took.
"I'm… absolutely a werewolf?" Remus said, staring at Harry as if he'd just started frothing at the mouth.
"Trust your wolf," Draco said as he hauled himself upright and tried not to fall forward on his face in exhaustion. "Your wolf wants to be free. If you convince the wolf that the blessing is trying to help and protect you, but doing it really badly like a pup, that might help."
Draco chuckled as he plopped onto the armchair closest to Harry. "They are pewter and no, you won't get lead poisoning from them. They're charmed. That's part of what the carving does. See the little circles around the snakes? Those are rune circles. My great-grandmother had them made back when she wanted to insult some pushy guests who wouldn't go home after a three-month visit. The sheer insult of them sent them home in the middle of a winter storm."
Dobby's bond frayed away the same way under their combined magic.
"Right, any reason not to let him through?" Harry said. "I mean, we're agreed that Dumbledore is using him, right? It's kind of obvious in the timing."
She popped them out of Father's bedroom and down to the ward stone in the dungeons under Malfoy Manor. The ward stone wasn't much to look at, a simple chunk of granite that had been inscribed with runes generations ago, but the magic swirling around it made up for it. The wards surged and tested Draco, probing at him for an instant before shimmering and stilling.
Another wish that simply wasn't going to be met.
It was ritual.
Draco blinked at Harry and then sighed. "You Muggle, you."
"All the cabinet drawers are full of stuff!" Harry exclaimed. "I mean, your stuff, not my stuff. Dobby's got all my stuff in a trunk that's got a full apartment in it. I didn't even know they made trunks like that, but apparently it was in the Potter vaults. When I said I needed a trunk to carry everything, Dobby went and got it. It's cool but it's not as cool as these things."
Harry nodded thoughtfully. "Well, I don't know much of anything about werewolves—"
"I doubt it," Grandpa Arcturus said. "Lucius is paranoid and quite vicious to her and Draco both. I certainly wouldn't invite them here."
To his hand.
So hard.
No, Headmaster Dumbledore couldn't care less whether Draco and his mother were tortured daily.
"Do rituals leave behind traces that people can find?" Harry asked. The sausages felt like lumps of iron in his belly.
Draco just nodded. Their magic, the magic linking them back to Ivy and Dobby and the twins, dimmed a bit but Draco shut his eyes. His breath hissed through his nose because his lips were pressed together really tightly. Through the bond, Harry felt Draco reaching out to Ivy and the twins, accepting their magic, accepting their help even though he hated being weak, hated needing to show that weakness to others.
Draco sighed. "Right. Time to work on the next part. Is Ivy ready? And Quinn?"
"Remus," Draco said, "what does your Wolf say about Dumbledore's goals? What does it think he wants to do?"
They'd wanted so badly to help but the Dark Lord's Mark prevented them from properly serving Father. The way the blessing had been laid prevented it from doing what it needed to do, too. Draco hummed.
Harry really wanted to rush over and make sure that Lord Black was all right.
Horrifying thought, there.
Except no, that was probably the blessing. Which if they could remove, then Hermione would just be her scary-smart self instead of the bossy domineering person she was. Maybe. Harry really didn't know what Hermione had been like before Hogwarts. She hadn't talked about it much, not that Harry'd talked much about his life before Hogwarts, either.
It felt like he floated though. He'd never been allowed to learn to swim. That was for good boys like Dudley, not freaks like Harry. The few times he'd been allowed a bath as a tiny child felt similar, though. Warm, suspended, floating and safe and free.
Remus stumbled to a stop, staring at Harry. "What isn't?"
"Dobby!" Harry called. He smiled when Dobby popped in immediately. "Okay, so are the curses on Remus and Professor McGonagall affecting the people around them?"
"Pfft, no, don't be silly," Harry said, rolling his eyes. "I'm the Gryffindor. You're the Slytherin. I'll go first and you be ready to pull me back through if something gets me on the other side."
"Go to Professor McGonagall," Draco agreed. "She's Deputy Headmistress. She's got more right to give you orders than anyone else. And I know she'll find lots of things for you to do to help."
He waved at Remus who was sweating and gritting his teeth while struggling with the blessing on Grandfather Arcturus. As the one person who had only the blessing, he made the perfect candidate. Mother had put her foot down in no uncertain terms about Draco being the test subject.
It was frayed.
"Now!" Draco told Ivy.
Huh. Kind of like how Harry and Dobby had saved each other by pure desperation and the refusal to give up.
Someone had to have. He could feel it. He knew it. He just didn't know who.
"Oh, Lily was perfectly polite most of the time," Amal said with a sad smile that faded into a worried frown. "Not when she was furious. She'd go up like a grenade and then she'd go cold. You had to watch out once she went cold. And, well, Dumbledore made them swear an oath not to share that prophecy with anyone before he gave it to them. From what they were able to tell me, you or Neville Longbottom were destined to destroy You-Know-Who. That's why they had to hide, so that You-Know-Who couldn't get at them."
She repeats his name with reverence and then excuses herself to the kitchen to pop a bottle. “
Her initial reaction is to place a hand against Hermione’s cheek, appreciating the beautiful blush of her skin when she’s flustered and chasing information. Instead, Luna takes pity on her, and leads her to the kitchen table to sit down. “I owe you an explanation.”
Harry swallows, overwhelmed with the confession. “Me too,” he admits, pulse beating rapidly in his throat. He can feel it vibrate through him, he’s so tightly-strung.
“Well, there’s mandrakes, still.”
There’s a shot of the
“I’m sorry,” Draco says, and Harry shakes his head, eagerly leaning into the heat of Draco’s hand.
“Of course, mon cher, but first you should—”
“No! The alternative is to not let yourself die, dammit!”
“I’m fine.”
“I just want to make sure you’re certain.”
Shaking his head, Draco looks at him with a question in his eyes. He inhales another drag, eyebrows raising.
“Brilliant idea!” Neville says. He Accios his coat; it thwacks him in the face. Harry snorts, then trips, falling into Draco’s shoulder.
“Hmm?” Harry licks his lips and raises an eyebrow, turning away from taste-testing the pan sauce he’s simmering.
“I’m sure Max will want to hear how the trip is going,” Hermione says, hands on her hips. Luna is watching her closely from her perch on the loveseat. She doesn’t look at all pleased.
He nods and heads for the bathroom. “Yup. Fine.”
“Yes, it has been a rather adventurous day.”
Harry boggles at the ignorance of such a statement when compared with the state they found Draco in. “This is a prison!”
“That rain won't hold off much longer,” is all Harry says to them before shoving the kickstand back and releasing the clutch. Draco watches him take off, then Charlie just behind him, his heart racing. Harry had seen his face, he’d known where Draco’s mind had gone. Showing the bike to him was a calculated play.
He scrambles to his feet. “Why did you bring me here?” he asks Luna. She does not seem phased by his anger and this only angers him more. He runs his hands through his hair, practically ripping it out at the roots. “Gods, Luna, why!?”
“We’re completely sold out,” Harry sighs, grinning.
Shaking his head, Draco folds his wings tight around himself and Harry, keeping her at bay.
“They’re the same,” she says, referring to his vitals.
Harry looks at him.
Malfoy huffs out an inelegant laugh. “He followed her home one day six months ago, fresh from Morocco with his student visa, snapping away with that damn Muggle camera of his. He was in utter raptures about the light and the reflections of the water on the palazzos and . . . well,” he trails off with a shrug, letting his explanation lapse into silence. Harry waits for more but nothing comes, Malfoy just stares out, content to be watched, his hand idly rubbing at his opposing wrist.
Draco nods and turns away again, feeling a fresh prickle of tears sting at the corners of his eyes. Fleur squeezes his hand and asks Bill to heat the kettle for more tea.
The knocking comes again, this time with the added thud of a bare foot. Harry curses and forces himself to calm down, inhaling deeply then exhaling, long and slow. His attempts at willing his erection away are not helped by Draco watching him so intensely he wants to crawl out of his skin.
. He’s holding a cup of steaming tea cloudy with milk and reading, of all things, a Muggle paperback in the middle of the afternoon. And...Harry squints, is that a Muggle wristwatch on his arm?
Perhaps it should, Harry thinks, but then he pushes down that single encroaching thought and focuses instead on the sight of Draco’s hard, leaking cock dripping before him like a quivering tap, ready to burst forth with cool water, and Harry’s been left outside all day in the sun.
“I’d forgotten.”
“Hey!”
They’re on a precipice, balance slipping. Harry can see in Draco’s eyes that he’s made up his mind, or has simply lost his mind, ready to fall either way. Yet, Harry hesitates. He hasn’t felt like this in years and the realisation terrifies him.
Luna tugs on her arm. “It’s alright,” she tells Hermione, whispering in her ear.
“Time flies, huh,” Ron says behind him, making Harry turn in surprise.
“Harry, shall we?” Luna asks, and Harry blinks at her, confused.
“I couldn’t.”
,**” she sighs, shaking her head and then gestures for him to follow, ushering her ubiquitous,
“I’ll be leaving Mipsy in your care, my dear. She’ll want to look after Draco. She’ll be a great help, I assure.”
“Eloquent as ever,” Draco quips, as the door slides shut behind Cecilia’s back. Harry turns to Draco, suddenly feeling as if he were eleven years old again, standing off in front of a boy he doesn’t know whose piercing grey eyes makes his insides feel strange.
A curse that has been Draco’s burden to bear ever since they put his father in the ground.
“I’m so sorry,” he whispers, voice breaking on the words. He cups his mouth with his trembling hand, shocked by the force of his emotions. But, Merlin help him, he means it; he is sorry. Sorry for the death of his beautiful wife, the months he spent slowly killing himself after she’d gone, and the time he’d lost with his precious son because he’d been too blinded by grief to realise that he still had someone who needed him just as much as he needed Gabrielle. He’s sorry he’d left Harry all those many, many, years ago without a word of closure between them before either of them had healed and he’s sorry for last night and the emotionally muddled mess he’d probably made of whatever it is they’d begun to forge together on this forgotten piece of rock in the middle of the ocean. He’s infinitely sorry. He pours all of his repressed emotion out into the coarse black hair of Harry’s mane along with his tears. The remorse and the grief and the worry seeping out of him like blood from an open wound.
