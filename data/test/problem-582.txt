Tilly frowns solemnly, “They don’t know yet.”
Draco laughs, “I don’t know, is it?”
“You don’t need to say anything,” Draco says, “That is unless you don’t want this,” he says pulling his green tie lose, working the buttons on his shirt open.
Draco looks at Harry meeting his eyes, “I don’t hate it when you’re around.”
“A bit,” Draco answers, “more annoyed and irritated.”
Draco barely let himself look at his fangs, let alone someone he only half liked.
Harry ponders this for a moment, “how long can vampires go without blood?” he asks.
“I love you too Draco,” Harry says.
“You’re being sentimental,” Draco grumbles.
A moment later, before Draco can become properly bored waiting, Draco can feel the weight shifting on the bed behind him, as Harry crawls up onto the bed.
“I don’t want to talk to you,” Draco retorts.
“No sir, but I can go get some,” she says quickly.
Draco thinks for a moment, the name sounded familiar, but he couldn’t quite put his finger on why “Andi Sefer?” he asks after a moment.
“Yeah, it doesn’t surprise me,” Draco says, “You spend years being rejected by someone, and then find out they are happily in a relationship, and if you’re as mad as Pansy is, you’ll try to stop everyone from being happy.”
Neil takes Draco into one of the bedrooms, there were at least ten people sitting and talking. It was much quieter than the rest of the party, Draco assumed a silencing spell was put up.
Draco and Blaise arrive at the club and meet Imogen and Tracey by the bar.
Draco smiles, a gentle smile back at Harry, “Kiss me,” he says, “Kiss me, right here, like you mean it.”
“No,” Draco says, undressing in front of the mirror.
“That sounds like you’re angry,” he says.
“Draco,” Harry groans in frustration.
“And how many times do I have to say, he’s not even my type, I’m not attracted to him,” Draco says, “I’m just thirsty,” he mutters.
Draco scoffs, “You just don’t get it, it took me forever to even admit to myself that I was gay, and then I had to come to terms with the fact that the girl I thought I was in love with, I only loved her as a friend, she was my best friend, and I had to break her heart,” he says, “and I finally worked up enough courage to say it aloud to all my friends, and apparently a guy I wanted to snog, only to be attacked for reasons unknown, and completely forget that I had come to this realization, and that I worked myself up to actually going through with it, only to have all those memories erased, and set me back who knows how far.”
Draco looks suspiciously at the candy, “Hmm,” he takes the candy from Harry, looking closer it did appear to be a blood lollie, he was curious now.
“What do you want me to say?” Draco snaps, startling Harry, “Do you want me to say that I feel fucking isolated being a vampire, an outcast of a Wizard, that I have no one, that I can’t stand the presence of most of my friends for an extended period of time?” he snaps, “But that I watch you spend hours, days even, fucking days with your friends, and you never seem unhappy around them,” Draco says glaring back at Harry, “Do you want me to say that I only ever feel that way when I’m around you, that you’re the only person I can stand to be around for extended periods of time, and not complain?”
Draco watches Harry, “thanks for the lollie,” he says, and Harry can’t help but notice the curl at the corner of Draco’s mouth, it’s definitely a smile.
Harry isn’t sure how it happens, but his instincts have him dropping to his knees, and he can’t help but stare, yes, he does stare at Draco Malfoy’s cock, he wants it. Harry’s eyes close, and he presses his nose against the skin where Draco’s thigh meets his groin and inhales his scent.
The fact that Harry spends more nights having a wank thinking of Draco, is not something that he’s willing to admit, especially since Draco is so unobtainable to him.
Harry walks into the shower cubicle turning the water on, letting it run for a moment, while he undresses. Harry stands under the water spray wetting down his hair, the warm water hitting his body reminding him of tiny kisses against his skin. Kisses and silver eyes, that was all he needed. Harry was instantly hard. And he knows he needs to be quiet, but the satisfied groan that escapes his throat as his hand closes around his hardened cock, is completely involuntary, and he makes an effort to keep the noises to a minimum.
“Well yeah,” Harry says, “You still have horrible personality traits, that’s not going to change overnight, but if I continue to call you out on it, you’ll at least know that you’re acting like an asshole.”
“You’re always going out at nights now,” Hermione says, “what are you doing at all hours of the night?”
“Good?” Blaise asks, crossing his arms over his chest.
Draco spends well over an hour in the shower, and he has absolutely no shame over that. When his body is clean, and his hair smells like vanilla and lilac, he finally smiles to himself. Draco dresses in a pair of his pajamas, silver silk. Draco crawls into the bed the sun wasn’t up yet, but he knew it was late, and he was actually tired. He slips underneath the sheets and sighs heavily before closing his eyes, allowing himself to sleep.
Tasting Draco’s pre-come on his tongue has Harry desperate to touch himself. He can’t stop himself from reaching down, gently rubbing the swollen head of his cock, causing himself to moan around Draco’s cock in his mouth.
Harry bites his lower lip, his cock twitched against his belly, he was hard and he could feel the pre-come beginning to drip down the length of his cock.
Draco walks through the living room, stopping in the hallway when he hears Harry’s voice.
“Yes, you have,” Ron insists, “I want to know what’s going on.”
"Well I needed to talk to you,” Anthony says.
“Potter, if you ruin this dress, we’re getting a divorce,” Draco smirks.
Draco laughs, “that did sound bad, didn’t it?”
“Trust you?” Draco says, “Why would I ever trust you? It’s just the kind of thing you would like, something else against me.”
Draco looks at Harry, “It’s fine, I was only eating,” he mutters, grumpily.
Draco laughs, “I don’t look good anymore?”
“It’s fine Potter, just give me a minute,” Draco sighs, looking back down at Jamie.
Harry blushes bright pink, “no,” he says, “you hardly said a thing.”
Draco had only fed from one person, but he felt that way too like he shouldn’t be watching other vampires as they fed.
“Yeah that’s not gonna happen,” he says, knowing full well if anyone could understand him right now, it would be Harry, but Draco definitely wasn’t going there.
“I would love you no matter what Draco,” she said softly.
the frustration in Harry’s eyes.
“So, you’re into voyeurism now are you,” Draco says.
Harry smiles, walking into the closet, “Well look at you,” he says, unable to stop himself looking at Draco’s very naked bum.
Draco stares back at Harry, “No romance remember,” he says.
“You don’t even know her,” Draco says, “but that’s alright, there are plenty of other girls here,” he says, before spinning Blaise, so that he was now against Draco’s backside.
Coming out as Bisexual was not something Harry ever intended to do, he’d just liked to admire the male figure, and the sharp lines of their bodies, and chiseled jawlines sometimes a little stubble. He hadn’t been with many men, but those he had been with, had been only average lovers. None of them had been as wild or adventurous as Ginny had been with him, but that’s what you’d expect when you looked at her. However, when Harry had seen his new lover as even more adventurous as his past lovers, he’d decided it was just the Purebloods repression of sexual expression and freedom, that made them such damn good lovers.
“I wasn’t,” Harry says, “but you’re tying my hands here Malfoy, I won’t know what he knows until I talk to him.”
“You’ve probably snogged more blokes than me,” Draco says.
The following night Draco finds himself at Astoria’s house, he’s not sure why he came here, but he figured it was one night, and anywhere else was better than the manor right now.
“Yeah?” he answers, looking back at Harry.
“Such a good boy,” Draco murmurs stroking their cocks together, the head of his cock glistening with precome. Draco releases their cocks a moment later, and Harry whimpers with disappointment.
“I’ve honestly never thought about it before,” Draco says, “and that may have more to do with me trying to figure my own sexuality.”
Draco sighs heavily when he shuts the door, letting himself take a moment to breathe deeply, refusing to let his immediate need for blood cloud his head.
of the things my boyfriend does or says, doesn’t mean I’m going to stop dating him,” Harry says, “I like you, and I like the way you treat me, and I like spending time with you, and I like the way you make me feel when we’re together, and I don’t expect, nor do I want you to change who you are to fit the person you
“I guess I am obligated to show him some attention tonight,” Draco says teasingly.
“Really?” Harry asks somewhat shocked.
Thank you all so much for sticking around and reading! It means a lot :) I hope you continue to enjoy reading this series! Thanks again so much! <3
Harry looks back at Draco, “I’m not going anywhere,” Harry says, “You’re in no condition to be on your own right now.”
Draco turns around, “I’ve got to go suck a cock or something,” he says.
Draco turns around opening the cabinet, taking out one of the extra toothbrushes, he meets Harry’s eyes, in the mirror, “Thank you.”
Draco looks back at Harry, “All I wanted was to finally be me,” he says, “I finally worked myself up to being truly Draco, and someone took that away from me.”
Draco frowns, “You look like you haven’t slept in days,” he mummers.
Harry smiles, wrapping his arm around Draco’s waist, “And are you having fun?” he asks.
Harry shakes his head, as he feels his chest tighten, and his abdomen contract, Harry was too far gone. “Fuck Draco,” he groans, as he comes, spilling over his hand with a forceful moan.
Draco looks back at Harry, “but, I don’t always have to be,” he says quietly.
“You’ll have a party,” Harry says smiling back at Draco.
“Don’t put that on,” Blaise says, pulling down a pair of dark slacks, putting them back a moment later, “I’m dressing you, so we can go.”
“It’s alright,” Harry says quickly, “I can’t imagine what you must be feeling,” he mutters, “I was the one who interrupted your morning.”
Harry takes the magazine, beginning to read the article. He was shocked and appalled as he read. Reading the violent nature of the attacks performed by the vampire in question, and the way the authorities decided to deal with the crime in question, Harry just couldn’t believe what he was reading.
Draco smiles, “that girl over there is watching us,” he says into Blaise’s ear.
Draco rolls his eyes, unable to stop the silly smile that appears on his lips, no matter how much he wanted it to go away, “Together,” he agrees.
“You have tea?” Harry asks surprised, for some reason Harry thought Draco wouldn’t have anything other than whatever it was vampires ate.
“Seeing how it feels?” Harry asks.
Harry looks at Draco, “It’s not so bad, living in London.”
“Imogen, Tracey, Cameron, Terry, Damen, Heather, Daphne, Astoria, and the two of us,” Blaise says.
“I was not watching you,” Harry says, “I came to see if you were ready for breakfast.”
“I’ve been crushing on Draco,” he says after a moment.
Draco rolls his eyes, “You do tonight,” he says, taking Blaise’s hand, pulling him up.
“You’re not looking for your wife, you’re looking for a pretty girl to fuck all night,” Draco says.
Harry stops, “Yeah?”
“I’m willing to put in work, and find out exactly who Draco Malfoy is,” Harry says, looking over at him, “That is, so long as you’ll let me.”
Harry rolls his eyes, “You already know you’re attractive so.”
Harry reaches down, taking hold of Draco’s hand, moving closer to him, “You went through that transformation all on your own, with no one, for months, you just had to compartmentalize, and internalize all of that, I can’t imagine how scared you were, and completely alone,” Harry says softly, “No one deserves to go through what you went through,” he says, “and no one deserves to go through it with no support system.”
Draco leans over, pressing his lips against Harry’s neck, kissing his neck, as Harry presses his hips down, grinding against Draco. Harry moans loudly when Draco’s fingers find his nipples. Draco can’t help himself as he runs his fingers over Harry’s taut nipple, rolling the pink nub between his thumb and index finger.
Draco nods, “Well I still can’t remember, and would have no idea why I would want to go to Winsworth’s.”
Draco looks curiously at Harry for a moment before he crawls up onto the bed, sitting on his knees, and facing away from Harry.
“I’m not gay,” he insists, “I mean, Imogen is bi, Tracey is a lesbian, you’re gay, I’m only here to get drunk it seems like,” Blaise says, “I never get laid when I go out with you guys.
Draco nods, “it happens,” he says, “no need and crying over spilled potion,” he mutters.
“Draco,” Harry says letting his eyes meet Draco’s.
Later, when Harry joins Draco on the sofa, he looks over at Draco thinking that, that had been too much, and he took things way too far.
“Do they know what happened to me?” he asks trying not to sound frantic.
“You fucking twat,” Blaise mutters rolling his eyes.
“It was him,” Draco says, “I left the pub with him, and we walked to another pub and had firewhiskey.”
“Does the name Danielle Carr mean anything to you?” Harry asks before taking a sip of his tea.
Draco lets his hand move from Harry’s hair, down his back, and trailing over the back of his shoulder, his fingers making their way down Harry’s spine until his hand rests on Harry’s waist.
Draco stares into the mirror, staring back at the fangs in his mouth, he could
Harry wasn’t particularly hungry, but he assumed that if he was going to be giving his blood to Draco later, that Draco wanted him to eat before doing so.
“I’m glad to hear that,” Harry says a small smile on his lips.
“I know what your name is,” Draco mutters, hating that Harry was starting to figure him out inside and out.
Harry glares back at Draco with the same daring look, “We don’t have to talk about this if you don’t want to, but we do have to acknowledge it,” he says firmly.
Blaise and Hermione both look at each other before looking at Ron, “That’s Draco.”
“But you know so much,” Harry says surprised.
“What happens if you don’t have blood?” Harry asks.
“I’m wearing yellow,” Harry insists.
Draco reaches over gently touching Harry’s hand, to stop him talking, “I’m interested, Potter,” he says removing his hand.
“I don’t know,” Draco says, “but I want to go home,” he did want to go home, he was honestly scared of how he was going to behave around other people, but he didn’t want his mother suffering like this because of him, and he wanted his own comfortable bed.
“Go on, tell me then, while she’s in the other room,” Ginny whispers.
“This is not something I’m proud of Blaise,” Draco says.
Draco leans down picking up his book from the floor, “alright then, I’ll see you around” he says, before turning to leave.
“You don’t know anything about me, Potter.”
Draco nods, getting up to show Harry out.
Draco almost forgets to control the flow as he drinks, a moment later he presses his tongue down, letting her blood flow slower, and Draco begins to savor the richness of her blood, as it meets his tongue. After a minute Draco feels her pulse slow slightly as he continues drinking. Draco feels the blisters on his hand beginning to heal as he drinks more.
“This should help,” she says.
“I’m willing to give it a try,” Draco says softly after a moment of silence.
“He wouldn’t just let you bite him,” Ginny says.
“Sure,” Harry says, and Draco calls Zella to bring Harry a bowl of porridge.
“Not sure yet,” Harry says, watching Draco’s expression change.
Harry frowns, “I’m a banana,” he says looking down at himself.
“My name is Tilly Rowe, and I’m your matron.”
Draco didn’t hate it, he thinks it’ll take some getting used to, like when he had to work out blood bags, “Yeah, I liked it.”
Neil smiles, “You don’t have to bite her hard if you don’t want, but just be firm with it,” he says.
Draco has to reign himself back in, he wasn’t angry with Harry, he was just irritable because he was thirsty and he knew he needed to be better at controlling that.
Harry blushes a shade of pink, “sorry” he mumbles.
“I told you it was weird for people,” Draco says, “that’s the reason I try not to bring it up.”
“You warm the blood?” Harry asks curiously.
“Do not touch that Mister Malfoy, this is not up for discussion.”
“It’s not alright, I have fucking fangs,” he says, his voice quivering until just now he hadn’t believed that anything anyone had been saying to him, but he had fangs, he couldn’t deny what was literally on his face right now.
“It can attach to both human and vampire cells, the human is simply the carrier, the disease is not active in a human body, only when the dormant pathogen comes into contact with vampiric cells through the fangs, does the illness present in the vampire,” Draco says.
Draco reaches out, grasping Harry’s bicep, making him stay and talk to him. Draco can’t help but notice the defined muscle under his fingertips, that he never remembers seeing before.
“I think, that’s who you might have been with that night outside Winsworth’s Bridge,” Harry says, watching Draco drink from his mug and spilling a little bit.
It’s two weeks later, Draco was getting dressed in his bedroom, Blaise was in the next room turning the radio stations every few moments.
Draco smiles, with a slight smirk, “Tell me something new.”
“You’re a vampire,” Toby says perplexed.
Harry looks over at Draco, “That was the Minister for Magic,” he says.
“I’m sorry,” Harry says, but he’s unable to tear his eyes away as he sees Draco’s fangs begin to recede, “I’ve never seen anything like this,” he murmurs.
Ron nods with a shrug.
Draco shrugs, “I suppose this is fun.”
Draco turns around, “I’ve never been happier,” he says, and Harry
“He’s a prejudiced, egotistical, pompous, asshole, and he always has been,” Ginny snarls.
Draco laughs, “Well there is such a thing as too much tongue,” he says.
Harry looks at Draco, completely confused by this story, “Why would you go to a pub with Oliver Rivers for firewhiskey when you were already at a pub with your friends?”
Harry just smiles to himself, “would you like to go out with me again?” he asks.
“You should go,” Draco says quickly.
“They?”
Harry only grins wider, giving Draco a tiny wink before taking the floo back home.
“Fuck off,” Draco spat, “You don’t know what I need right now. You know nothing about me, you think you know so much, but you know nothing.”
“Ginny,” Harry says warningly.
“Draco,” Harry says quietly, so quietly he wasn’t sure he said anything until Draco responded.
Draco smirks, reaching down for Harry’s trousers, quickly pulling the buckle on his belt open, as he walks backwards toward the bedroom. Draco untucks Harry’s shirt from his trousers and begins to work the buttons open until he’s pressed back against the bedroom door.
, but this had to be an entirely new level of that.
“You could be with me, and never want to drink from me?”
“And you never knew he had a sister?” Harry asks.
Draco looks over at Harry, “that’s it,” he says.
“Who would you be most shocked to see Harry dating?” Ginny asks Hermione.
Harry narrows his eyes at Draco, he was done, he did not have time for this, “Draco,” Harry says warningly.
Draco rolls his eyes, “I’m not thirsty” he says.
Harry’s cheeks pinken slightly, “Sorry,” he says quietly.
“Who was I with?” Draco asks.
“You don’t know me, Potter,” Draco says.
Harry was holding a near-empty glass of wine when the Minister for Magic approaches him to discuss a proposal Harry had given him just a few days earlier. Harry nods attentively while Kingsley talks, and finishes the last of his wine, setting it on a table, at the very moment Harry felt a hand on his shoulder.
“Ready?” he asks.
Harry watches after him for a moment before he walks into the bedroom behind Draco, “You are very bossy.”
“Okay, but not anymore,” Harry says, “now, I live alone.”
It’s nearly four in the morning when the last of Draco’s friends leave his house, Draco was slightly intoxicated and wanted to go to bed. Draco quickly changes into his pajamas, before finishing off the last of the blood wine.
Harry looks down at his bowl, looking back up at her, “having breakfast,” he offers.
Draco’s hand settles on Camilla’s waist, and she leans into him as he drinks from her. Draco lets his tongue ease up on the vein in her neck, letting her blood fill his mouth before swallowing slowly. Draco can feel her pulse against his tongue, and he can feel it slow ever so slightly, as he swallows.
Draco sighs heavily, watching her retrieve some medical supplies from the cupboard.
“Some vampires live underground, in like covens,” he says, “they’re nearly impossible to find, some never surface again once they’ve gone underground.”
Draco rolls his eyes, “I want to brush my teeth,” he says.
“I love you Draco Malfoy,” Harry smiles.
Harry watches Draco as he eats the cake, and his curiosity gets the better of him. He watches the red of Draco’s eyes, begin to lighten to their usual silver, leaving only a tiny nearly invisible red ring around his iris, as Draco consumes another cake.
Draco rolls his eyes, “If you’re so attracted to Jamie, I’ll get his number for you,” Draco says.
“I know, you get all dressed up, you go for coffee or something, and more times than not, he’s a bad kisser.”
Draco savors the taste of Harry’s blood entering his body and allows himself to indulge in this for a bit longer until he can feel Harry’s lifeforce beginning to rise from deep with Harry’s being.
Draco takes Harry’s hand, letting him help him up, “Maybe the next time you come over it could be for fun,” Draco says.
When Draco answers the door, he’s greeted by a very beautiful with, with long platinum blonde hair, wearing a black V-neck tee, and a pair of blue jeans that fit her body so well, Draco was almost jealous of the way her legs looked in those jeans, he wanted to look that good in his jeans.
Draco nods, “A handful are passed through human contact, and the rest passed vampire to vampire.”
“That’s probably what you wanted me to make sure you did,” Blaise said, “keep you honest.”
Draco lifts his hips, and the dress begins to slide off his hips, and down his legs. A low groan of approval escapes Harry’s lips, as Draco sits back on the bed, pulling the dress off from around his ankles, before waving it into the wardrobe, where it hung itself neatly.
“We ended up spending a lot of time together, because I was helping him, but at some point I started having feelings for him,” Harry admits, “I didn’t get it at first, I thought if I could make friends with him,  I would feel better, but it wasn’t enough,” he says, “and he obviously was having similar feelings, because we started dating after that,” Harry says, “and that was nearly a year ago.”
“Will you also show me?” Harry asks quietly.
“It’s like a lion stalking its prey,” Harry says.
“Well I do,” he snarls.
Harry smiles, “of course,” he says, “next time, I get blackout drunk, you can take care of me,” he smirks.
The young red-headed wizard nods, “You’re my first of the day,” he smiles.
Draco watches Harry slide down his pants, and the way Harry’s eyes widen in surprise. Harry isn’t sure what he expected, it wasn’t that he hadn’t expected Draco to be well hung but staring back at what he’d only ever fantasized about was like being on cloud nine. Harry reaches up taking Draco’s cock into his hand, gently pulling down his foreskin. Harry strokes Draco’s cock and Draco’s hips thrust up to meet Harry’s hand.
“Ginny?” Harry asks confused, before turning around to see the red-headed girl standing behind him, with a disapproving look on her face and her arms crossed over her chest.
With a second lubrication charm, Draco inserts another finger, and Harry groans in response as Draco curls his fingers inside Harry.
“Mum, it’s okay,” Draco says in an attempt to comfort her.
Harry looks over at Ron, “That’s all you have to say?”
“I’m Mandy,” she smiles, “You and your boyfriend looked really good out there.”
Anthony frowns, “Draco,” he murmurs.
“Were you not seeing Ernie Macmillian?” Draco asks.
“My glass is empty,” Draco says watching Toby set the empty glass on a nearby table.
Harry nods, and he’s almost positive he can see a single stray tear threatening to break through Draco’s eye, but Draco would not let this happen.
“You’ll feel better,” Harry says softly, “Or is A negative no longer your favorite?” he teases.
Izzie nods, pulling her shirt off before sitting on the sofa.
“Hey Ginny,” Harry smiles, waving back at her.
Harry walks into the bedroom, looking around briefly, “Draco,” he calls out.
“You’ll feel better,” Harry says, tilting his neck toward Draco, “Or is this not why you’ve been cranky?”
“It can’t be,” Lucius says, “After everything we went through!”
“I asked Astoria, where you were,” Blaise says defensively, “she said that you told her you had to go meet someone.”
Because Harry was different. Even through all of his anger Draco knew Harry was different, and that only made him angrier.
“Why so late?” She asks, going to make herself a cup of tea.
“You let me see who you truly are,” Harry says softly.
“You’ve been avoiding me,” Harry says, walking over to the table where Draco was sitting.
“Vampires are creepy creatures,” Draco says, “I’m definitely not denying that.”
“Is that why you broke things off?” he asks curiously.
“Draco, I-“ Harry moans loudly, his abdominal muscles seizing up as he comes, spilling over Draco’s hand, grinding his hips down purposefully pressing the head of Draco’s cock against his prostate.
Astoria smiles, sitting down in Draco’s lap, letting her hand rest on Draco’s waist, as she leans in pressing her lips against his, kissing him softly. Draco rolls his eyes, Astoria always had to make an entrance, he humors her and kisses her back.
Harry nods looking around, “Looks like you’ve settled in nicely.”
Draco closes his eyes trying to remember coming back here with Harry, but he doesn’t remember.
“I’ve never drunk from someone without their permission, and I’m perfectly content with blood from a blood bag. I’ve never desired to drink from a person, so I doubt it’s something you’ll need to worry about,” Draco says crossing his arms over his chest.
“Hmm,” Harry murmurs, now thoroughly distracted by the fact that Draco’s leg was fully showing, through the slit of his dress, “You’re trying to kill me,” Harry says, gently running his fingertips over the skin of Draco’s leg, the skin was soft, “You shaved.”
“I beg your pardon,” Harry says, looking back at Draco.
“Hi, Malfoy.” Harry was so awkward, how that man got anything done Draco would never understand.
Draco rolls his eyes, of course, Potter would be here, leave it up to Potter to figure out where he moved to before anyone else. He gets up walking into the entry, sure enough, there was Harry Potter, standing there in his entryway, with what Draco could only describe as a smile, but he’s not sure why Potter would be so happy to see him right now.
Draco sighs, but puts the shirt on anyway. Blaise hands him a black vest a moment later, it was soft as silk, and Draco had only worn it one other time, as far as he could remember.
Neil smiles, “C’mon,” he says taking Draco back to the party, “I think your date wants your attention.”
“Alright, brunette then,” he smiles.
Harry grins, he didn’t know those simple words, could make him so happy. He walks over to the bed, beginning to undress, leaving his shoes by the edge of the bed and taking off his coat.
“I’ll walk you through it,” Neil says, “Trust me, you’ll love it.”
Leaning his head back against the shower wall, Harry’s eyes slip shut and Draco’s pale slender body enters his mind, his hand stroking his wanting cock. Draco’s cock in Harry’s mouth and Harry’s hand moves faster, he bites his lower lip.
Draco rolls his eyes, “What could you possibly have to say, Anthony? What?”
Draco wraps his arms around Blaise’s waist, “purple dress, white heels,” he murmurs into Blaise’s ear.
“I’m not ashamed, I just still need to work out so much about my new condition, before I can even understand it myself,” Draco says.
“We’re not as different as you think,” Harry says, “and I wouldn’t mind being your friend,” he says.
The corner of Harry’s mouth twitches, “I think it’s harder because I still don’t know what I am” he says quietly.
Draco laughs, he had sort of been getting around this year, but he’s just making up for lost time, he should have been fooling around with boys in his earlier years, but that just wasn’t a possibility at the time.
Draco leans over, pressing his lips against Toby’s, kissing him, Toby kisses back, a bit hesitant. Draco pulls back a second later, “Do they bother you?” he asks, “I can put them away if you prefer.”
Draco shrugs, “Probably, I’m going to look for my own place tomorrow, might as well stay in London.”
“It’s a party,” Harry says, “I was invited.”
“We’re not giving up, but realistically, we may never find her,” Harry says looking back at Draco.
“No,” Harry says, pulling his knees close to his chest.
Harry isn’t really sure what he expected his first time hooking up with Draco. Draco is exceptionally quiet as Harry moves down from the sofa, onto the floor in front of Draco, reaching for his trousers. Draco watches in pure anticipation as Harry opens the button on his trousers, and Draco couldn’t hide the way his erection pressed against the zipper, begging to be free.
“You were with Andi that night,” Harry says looking at Draco, “Andi was the one who turned you.”
Draco switches places with Blaise at the bar, taking a drink of his mead, deciding to go off and find one of those guys who was watching him dance with Blaise. Draco starts to walk toward the back of the club when someone steps out in front of him, and he spills his drink a little.
Draco did need someone to keep him accountable, he most definitely would have backed out of something like that, especially if the timing didn’t suit him just perfectly.
“Nothing,” Harry says, watching Draco walk over to him.
Harry reaches down a moment later, opening his pants with one hand, letting the head of his cock free from his jeans, freeing him from the distraction of his own aching erection, while he focused on getting Draco off, and damn if having a half-naked Draco writing beneath him, wasn’t the hottest thing he’d ever experienced in his entire fucking life.
“I don’t need you, Harry, I am an adult, who can take care of myself, I’ve learned to take care of myself. I don’t need you looking after my emotions, I can control my emotions and how I react to those emotions without your help, and I definitely don’t need you, or anyone else feeling fucking sorry for me, I am the happiest I’ve ever been in my entire life, and the second you start feeling sorry for me, during any of this, is the moment I no longer want you around,” Draco says looking back at Harry, “I asked you to be my boyfriend, not because need someone to take care of me, but because I want to be with you, I don’t need you, I can survive without you, but I don’t want to be without you, I want to be with you, I want to spend time with you, I want to go to the cinema with you, I want to go to dinner with you, I want to kiss you, I want to have sex with you, I want to have a relationship with you, I don’t need any of those things Harry, but I do want them, and I want them with you.”
Harry looks over at Draco, “So,” he murmurs before taking a sip of his coffee.
Draco saying, “Be a good boy, and do as you’re told.”
That last bit comforted Draco, “okay,” he says.
“I didn’t like what I saw,” Anthony says.
Draco groans softly, against Harry’s skin, he can hear his heart beating loud in his ear as his heart rate increases. Draco can feel Harry’s muscles, squeeze around his cock, and Draco is sure he won’t be able to last very long. He watches Harry’s cock twitch between their bodies, dripping with precome, and Draco brings his hand between them, beginning to stroke Harry’s cock, rubbing the sticky fluid over the head of his cock causing Harry to cry out in pure ecstasy.
“You are not taking my son away from me,” Narcissa says firmly, “I refuse Lucius.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry says, dropping the pastie in his hand, “I am so sorry.”
“Draco, I’m sorry,” Harry says looking over at him.
Harry just smiles, walking back into the kitchen, waiting for Draco to join him for breakfast.
“Say thank you,” Harry says.
Draco stumbles out of the Floo, his heels catching on the edge of the fireplace, at the same moment Harry’s hand wraps tightly around Draco’s waist, catching him before he could fall.
“Okay,” Draco says, nibbling at his toast.
“That’s freaky,” Harry says.
“Enough to know, he plays dirty,” Draco mutters.
“You’re so spoiled, it’s okay to make your own coffee every now and then,” Harry says.
“If he makes you happy mate then who am I to say anything else about it” Ron says, “thought we would go to the club and pick up girls together, but I guess you’ll be picking up blokes instead,” he teases with a giant grin on his face, and Harry can’t help but smile back at Ron and laugh at him.
Draco frowns, was it Friday? How long had he been here, what the hell actually happened to him?
Draco stares in shock, “Three days? I’ve been asleep in hospital for three days?”
Draco purses his lips briefly before, “I mean it, Harry, you can’t tell anyone.”
“She’s weird.”
Draco’s need for control at that moment seems to fail him, he thinks it might be okay for just a moment, and so long as no one else sees him drop his control that it might be okay with Harry, but not all the time, and definitely not when anyone else could see it. But Draco thinks he could release his control for Harry.
“Do you know where you are Mister Malfoy?”
“Ready?” Camilla asks with a pleasant smile.
“It’s not so bad,” Draco says, “It’s a pretty nice place.”
Draco shrugs, “It’s not like I’m missing anything.”
Draco looks in the mirror for another minute before he wanders back to his bedroom, putting on some clothes.
“That sounds nice,” Draco says.
A huge thank you to everyone who read the last chapter! Here is the second chapter. Look for chapter three around this time next week :)
Draco stares back at Harry still not seeing where he was going, “Okay?”
Draco shrugs, “someone will have to help you I suppose,” he says, “by day four, you’re more or less simply existing by breathing alone, too weak to move or even open your eyes.”
Harry raises an eyebrow, in acknowledgment, he didn’t have to like it, but he did have to respect it, “Understood.”
Harry nods, swallowing down the lump in his throat, “You shouldn’t be sorry for saying how you feel,” Harry says, “I’ll be fine,” he insists, “and this probably won’t be the last time one of us ends up with hurt feelings.”
“We’re getting there?” Harry laughs, “So we’re not even friends yet, but you’re trying out the word boyfriend?”
“Go on to bed,” Ron says nudging his sister off towards her dormitory.
“I’m going to go now, and I suggest neither of you follows me home,” Draco says, walking away from the both of them. Draco walks into the next room, making his way to the Floo, and going straight home.
“I’m your best mate, when did we start keeping things from each other?” he asks seriously.
Draco leans over the toilet, emptying the contents of his stomach, twice.
This causes Harry to blush, and he wishes he could hide this, “Merlin,” Harry murmurs.
“What you like, that is,” Harry clarifies.
Blaise watches Draco for another moment before he nods, “alright,” he says getting up from the sofa.
Draco stares down at the blood bag trying to figure out how it opens, he pulls on the tab on the bottom of the bag, and it made a tiny popping noise. Draco could feel the fangs sprout, and the clicking noise loud in his ears, as the scent of the fresh blood filled his nostrils. Bringing the bag to his lips Draco began to suck, a large amount of blood filling his mouth all at once sent his senses into overdrive. Draco swallows quickly pulling the bag away from his mouth, and blood began to spill from his mouth. Draco quickly swallows the blood, wiping his mouth now covered in blood with the back of his hand.
“What? No, stay,” Draco says.
“Yes?” Draco asks, looking up to meet Harry’s eyes.
“Well, generally speaking, a vampire can go about two days three at most, four if absolutely necessary, and if they’re older,” Draco says.
“Draco!” Harry all but screams as he sees stars. Draco’s cock prodding directly against his swollen prostate. Harry’s scratching at Draco’s thighs beneath him, “Fuck Draco” he moans.
Harry rolls his eyes, “Why because I said something nice about you?”
“Shit,” Draco mutters, feeling his cheeks flush, as he wipes at the corner of his mouth, with his finger. It’s that moment that Draco realizes his fangs are on full display. He quickly covers his mouth trying to hide them from Harry.
After class the following afternoon, Draco decided to take a shower, before he went out with Blaise for the evening. He walks up to the prefect’s bathroom, he can’t say he wasn’t taken back with surprise when Harry walks out, and they’re standing practically nose to nose. Harry is staring back into those beautiful silver eyes, and he’s suddenly at a loss for words.
Draco stands in the hallway his arms crossed over his chest, “You’re an idiot” he says looking back at Blaise.
“Oh no, I don’t think-“
Draco drinks his blood rather quickly before he picks at half of a sandwich.
Draco walks over to the bed, crawling up into bed beside Harry, moving to straddle Harry’s chest. Harry grins, and his mouth falls open, as Draco presses the head of his cock against Harry’s lips. Harry leans up, taking Draco’s cock into his mouth. Draco pushes his hips forward slightly, gently running his hands through his hair, pushing his hair out of his face, so he can get a better look at Harry.
life with him, his vampire life. When a vampire elects to turn another, they can choose to bond that vampire to them.
“Probably not,” Draco admits, “I, however, am going to make an effort not to do so, so often.”
“Watch it, Potter,” Draco says before a small laugh escapes him.
Draco frowns, “I imagine so, but I’ve never asked.”
“Merlin’s pants Harry,” Draco says, “You’re serious.”
Draco still couldn’t believe what he was hearing. There was just no way that the famous Harry Potter was gay, there was no way that Harry, Harry Potter of all people understood what it was like to be gay. People would love Harry no matter what, no matter if he was gay or straight, vampire or human, people would love him because he saved the entire wizarding world. But Draco, no one loved Draco.
“You’ve had an accident,” the matron says, walking into the room, taking a closer look at Draco’s chart.
“Straight away,” she answers, hurrying off to the kitchen to prepare Draco’s beverage.
Harry looks at Draco, “How many times is a few?” he asks.
It was just after noon when Harry arrived, and he can’t wait to crawl into bed. Mostly because Draco was in bed, and he missed sleeping next to him for the last week. Harry had been spending more and more time at Draco’s house, spending the night nearly every night. When Harry couldn’t spend the night, Draco would begrudgingly stay over at Harry’s, but that only happened about twice a week.
flipping through the first couple of pages, stopping at an article about a decrease in blood donors in Ireland.
“Draco, I didn’t mean to say that, to Ginny,” he says, “I wasn’t thinking,” he mutters.
“Draco,” Harry whispers quietly.
“You okay?” Harry asks softly, pulling the sheets back on the bed for Draco.
Harry feels shame at that, Draco was right and he was being rude, “I’m sorry,” he says meeting Draco’s eyes.
“I’ll let go if you sit back down,” Harry says looking up at Draco.
Harry notices how controlled Draco’s kissing is, the way Draco’s lips meet his and the way Draco’s tongue brushes against his own and exactly what this does to Harry is so embarrassing, he can’t ever speak of it. Draco breaks the kiss, his eyes tilting downward, he feels like he’s unable to look Harry in the eye. Draco quickly shoves whatever thought that had been in his head out, and he straightens up refusing to let himself be embarrassed.
Draco smiles finishing his porridge, “I want to have a party,” he says.
Draco swallows thickly, pressing his lips together in a fine line, looking back at Harry, “No,” he says fiercely.
Draco watches him for a minute, was Harry seriously trying to be his friend right now, “Well I’m still not feeding in front of you,” he says, “humans get weird about stuff like that.”
“That’s creepy,” Harry says again.
“Are you sure?” Draco asks, everything in his being wanted inside Harry right now, but he realizes Harry may need a moment.
Draco rolls his eyes, “Vampires have fangs, Blaise,” he mutters.
“Well I can’t change what I am, and that includes drinking blood,” Draco says.
“I don’t think you will be when you hear what I have to say,” he says.
Blaise quickly downs his firewhiskey, setting the glass on the table, as Draco pulls him to the dancefloor.
Harry walks over, gently placing his hand on his lover’s waist, and is immediately lost in the gorgeous silver eyes.
Draco rolls his eyes, leave it up to Potter to use a word like that, “I haven’t had a desire for human flesh if that’s what you’re asking.”
“Draco Malfoy?” Ron asks as if he hadn’t heard him clearly.
“Now find her pulse with your tongue,” Neil says, “And swallow.”
One minute later, Draco feels Jamie’s pulse increase, and at the same moment, he hears the fireplace whir.
Hermione looks at Harry as though he’d just spoken Japanese to her, and Harry gets angry when she doesn’t respond, “Why are you staring at me like that?” he asks raising his voice.
Harry smiles, “Well I certainly appreciate that.”
“Potter,” Draco says.
“Cute,” Draco says.
“Ah, he’s a Salamander,” Harry says laughing to himself.
“Want a coffee?” Harry asks.
“I’m not a child, I don’t need a babysitter,” Draco says.
“Potter,” Draco warns.
Draco shrugs, before sitting down against the wall beside Harry, “It’s just different Potter, it’s not the same for everyone, and you have to be ready to deal with the stuff that comes after,” he says.
Draco shudders, “That’s embarrassing.”
Draco glares over at Harry, wondering why he had to be the one to be here, instead of any other Auror, “Why are you here?”
Harry looks at Draco, he was starting to feel sorry for him again, “They’re not erased, they’re just taking time to come back to you, you remembered about Oliver, and Astoria, that’s a start.”
It wasn’t as private as Harry would have liked, but at this moment Harry didn’t care who saw him kissing Draco right now, and he knew only a handful of people knew Draco occasionally dressed in drag, so he could be kissing anyone, and that made it even hotter to Harry. Kissing his lover, in this sexy dress, in front of so many people. Harry knew the longer they sat here kissing the more attention they were going to draw, but none of that mattered right now. All that mattered to him, was Draco. Draco’s hand in his hair, Draco’s tongue against his, fighting for dominance, Draco’s skin, touching his.
"She's right," Harry agreed. "When Ginny and I talked, she told me that she realized only very recently that she might not have the right kind of mindset to really be like Molly. I reminded her that I wasn't expecting her to be all domestic and trapped at home to do all the housework, you know? And she said she knew that, but that even with a career and everything, she would still feel grounded."
For once, Hermione was the one who hung her head in defeat. "I guess it's both..."
"I want Astoria."
"I'm hardly ever mistaken, Potter," Malfoy said. "I've noticed all these odd clues around you a long time ago. I just never really thought-."
. Somehow, the fact that he was privy to the blonde prat's private life - the simple joys they accidentally shared - made him all the more determined to get to the bottom of this whole issue. Knowing that Draco's very mind had been tampered with was the last straw. He knew the man well enough to know that he would not react calmly if he found out. They would tell him eventually, but not yet.
Weasley laughed. "Good luck with that! Traumatic early childhood, missing guardians, not to mention inappropriate child-endangering school activities and post-traumatic stress disorder brought on by continual exposure to warfare..."
of yours, but Harry's having a difficult time right now and the
: All I'll say is that we've been together a while, and we intend to stay together. That's all anyone really needs to know, anyway. Again, next question?
"You know...I think I finally see what's wrong here," Harry said slowly. "Thing is, you've gotta figure it out on your own. It can't come from me." Finally Harry moved back but kept staring at her, waiting for a reaction. She had none. It kind of unnerved him. It felt weird, him saying so much, and her saying nothing at all. Talk about tables turned.
Naturally, at first, Harry had had trouble juggling the baby-watch between himself, Ginny, Molly and Andromeda. However, Kingsley himself saw the need to change Harry's hours to accommodate James' care. Therefore, he had placed Harry on a paternal leave, letting him work from home so that he could be with James around the clock. Harry liked this arrangement, since it gave him time with his son, as well as let him continue his responsibilities as the Head of MMI. What he hated about it was the feeling of loneliness brought about by spending the entire day in an empty flat.
to the mother of his children… but in a way, he did enjoy being hands on with Jamie and Albus. It was as clear as Veritaserum, to anyone who had eyes, that the sons thrived under the care of their father's rather than their mother's, which had made it easier for Harry and Ginny to accept things as they were with as little contempt as possible.
He was absolutely terrified right now. He was worried thrice over, for himself, Astoria and their son. There was always that small part of him that needed things to go according to plan, or his mind would stumble back to dark corners and he would lose himself again.
"For all our sakes, I hope you're right," he said. "Now, time for another important call."
The first time he had read it, he was tempted to chuck it in the fire. The very idea of Potter writing such nonsense to him irritated him, all those casual references to their terrible past. But then he had read it again. And again. And it had finally made sense to him.
"Ugh, don't remind me," Harry said, putting his forehead on the table in defeat. "I'm absolutely not looking forward to it, and neither is Ginny."
When a corner of Potter's lip twitched, Draco knew that he was on the right track. "Now, how about you start acting like a real Gryffindor, and be all brash and loud and impulsive while I play a quiet and understanding Hufflepuff and listen to all your woes?"
"What d'you mean, 'kind of'?"
," Malfoy said, full of relief. "You don't know what this means to me. To my family."
Draco's face reflected horror for a second before he expertly schooled his features back into the Malfoy Mask. He still had no words, though.
Hermione bit her lip to stop from grinning. "Whatever would the Malfoy forebears say!" she said with a dramatic tone. Malfoy couldn't help but laugh.
"Oh that's right," Weasley added. "I forgot Macmillan got you for that one. Bollocks, that means you still fall under the consultants who've come in within the last year."
Astoria's answer made Draco's eyebrow go so high that it threatened to disappear behind his forelock. He turned his gaze back to the woman by the door. "Who are the visitors? Are they part of the list previously approved by my mother?"
"That's why I had to see you," Draco said in a low voice. He didn't feel the need to explain further. He knew he was right to assume that Potter would understand.
Draco felt a tug at his heartstrings at Potter's concern. "What happened anyway? Not like you explained it to me in detail via owl."
On that strange note, Draco put together his scattered impressions and tried to build a clearer picture of what this night's conversation was all about, because he really hadn't seen it coming.
"Yes, that was one of the possibilities we considered," said Weasley. "But our team went overtime with the MMI mind-exploration."
"Did you at least get to spend time with him before he passed away?" Harry couldn't help but ask. "I don't believe Narcissa actually mentioned him to me when we'd talked in the past."
Harry wondered why he couldn't seem to stop spewing out personal information. For some reason, seeing Malfoy here, in his very home, was so surreal that he felt the natural order of things were slowly breaking down around him. He was confiding in Malfoy, for Merlin's sake. He wasn't that piss-drunk anymore, so he assumed he was going crazy.
He moved closer to his sleeping son, brushing a stray hair from the boy's cheek.
Sure enough, when Narcissa ended the spell, Astoria met his eye and motioned for him to finally approach her. She stretched out an arm towards her husband, and he grasped her hand firmly and allowed her to pull him closer.
"Of course, love," Draco replied tenderly. He had just arrived at the Manor, and was still at the front door when the parcels arrived. "What exactly are these, Astoria?" he asked as he levitated the large boxes from the foyer and into one of the rooms off the hall.
"What do you think?"
For a moment, Draco felt as if he were in another world, where he was best mates with these two Aurors, and they were sharing a few rounds and some witty banter at the end of a long day at work. Somehow, that picture was so absurd to him, despite the fact that he was still sitting with his two most loathed enemies, having drinks and a top secret mission, working together to help stop a string of grisly murders.
"I'm guessing you hated it? When you used to come here?" he asked tentatively.
"Once you invoked it, I, of course, used all the resources within my grasp to educate myself on its finer aspects. Just in case, you know, I might somehow use it to my advantage. Lo and behold, it seems as though even I know more than you do, given the amount of research material tucked away in the Malfoy library."
miss something?"
Astoria squeezed his hand gently. "I refuse to let this stupid letter ruin our time here," she said, and Draco was glad to observe that she was almost back to her sweet but haughty manner. "So long as we are within the estate, nothing can happen to us."
"Things, for the baby," she said matter-of-factly. "I can hardly go out looking like a whale! So I availed of the catalogue services of several shops all around Europe and had them sent here instead."
"You've mentioned it before," Ron pointed out. "That last talk that we had about Ginny leaving."
Harry gave out an exaggerated, long-suffering sigh. Spending time with Malfoy also meant going with the flow. Which meant going with whatever Malfoy judged best. Ironically enough, they both had realized that Harry and Ron made terrible decisions all the time, and that Malfoy could be trusted to actually make the right call for a number of situations. The man was bossy and prissy, but he knew what he was doing more half the time.
though his final conclusions had been off base. Still, it unnerved him. Once again, he felt vulnerable.
"Hurry up, darling, or we'll be late."
"But..." Malfoy seemed so lost at the moment, but he found his words. "Okay. Let's get real here. The three important aspects of extending your bindings."
Draco felt confused. "What do you mean?"
Of course, present-day Draco was living almost the extreme opposite of the life he had once thought he would live. Here he was, in the bloody Burrow of all places, having a nice chat with Hermione - she had insisted some time ago that he use her given name, with the silent threat of 'or else'. She was undergoing some stress having to stay home after having her second child, and had invited Draco over since Astoria was visiting a few of her socialite friends. Draco couldn't even imagine what his childhood self would do if he had been told that he would be sharing a nice cup of tea with a Mudblood and actually be looking forward to doing it again. Ah, how laughable Fate was sometimes. And in such a short period of time, at that.
Not everything was the way he had planned, or expected, or even dreamed of... but right now, everything about their little family was perfect.
"Then they would find a way to provide for that specific diet," Malfoy replied smoothly, before cocking an eyebrow up at his guest.
"I'm only just getting used to it, actually." It was true. The initial euphoria from the
"You wish," Draco huffed in an attempt to sound unconcerned. "You are no one and nothing to me."
that Draco, smart as he was and as Slytherin as one could go, didn't see the true colors of Potter's odd situation until that night.
Harry could see the blonde waver, but then steel his resolve in a second. "I'd like to authorize the monitoring charms you told me about." "What?" Harry was shocked. "Are you sure? I thought you despised the idea of being trailed and tracked by Aurors?"
Ron barked out a laugh. "Yeah, Mum is crazy about Women in Power, or something as ridiculous as that. Girls-Run-the-World kind of thing..."
Draco nodded.
, he thought.
He went through the piles of parchment littering one corner of his desk, in a weak attempt at putting his things in order. Draco's reply was still sitting on top of one pile, and Harry perused it once more before dropping it and heaving a sigh.
At that, Hermione beamed and motioned him to follow into the nursery, where Hugo, now a very healthy (and noisy) boy, was only just waking from his nap. "There's nothing much to help with, though I'm thankful for the company." In a bassinet, Draco could see the sleeping bundle that was Rose. He went up to her and tucked in a stray lock behind her tiny ear, rearranging the miniscule blanket around her.
A lump formed in Harry's throat, around the same time that an odd warm something squirmed in his stomach. He squeezed back.
"Can't you break a contract or something?" Harry asked, interested. Ron had tried to give him a better idea of traditional marriages before, but Harry never really paid any attention.
Harry laughed at his question, no longer sure about which of them needed the drinks more. "I dunno, mate," he replied, taking another gulpful of his drink. "I just felt like we both needed this."
"How much longer…?" the blond witch asked, her trembling voice betraying the cool and collected mask on her face.
No need to panic, this is just a quick note to all of you who are still waiting, that
"You're not being spied on, Ron," Hermione interjected. She had a thoughtful expression, which Draco was sure meant that the cogs were working overtime. "But I do agree that it's a rather large inconvenience for the entire department. Surely they're aware of the gross amount of interdepartmental cooperation within the Ministry in one month, let alone a year? It's such a generalized and sloppy solution, and it'll take forever just to get everyone done!"
"I'm sure she's alright, dear," Narcissa said, smoothing away Draco's hair from his pale face. "No need to worry now."
"Tell me everything, Mother."
Macmillan frowned. "Won't we need to read them properly?" he asked, accepting the papers through the enchanted fire.
"Mate, you've gathered more information from that piece of parchment in half a day than my team did for the last four weeks. Looks like I made the right call."
he reflected, as he took a bite of his piece of cake and smiled in complete contentment, surrounded by his new circle of family and friends.
Ginny laughed and nodded, running ahead of him to the upper level. As Harry had expected, her mood instantly became better outdoors, high up in the sky, just like his did. While he always sought his solitude and quiet focus up there, he had realized a while back that it was different for Ginny, that it represented a certain sense of openness and carefree abandon for her. She let out scream after scream, relieving all of the pent up pressure that she had kept over the last few months, while hoping to get into the team. Harry knew how much she had kept herself in check around him, and he was glad that his rooftop could help her with that. Definitely one of his better life choices.
"I'm pretty sure we'll manage," Potter sighed. He looked impatiently bored, which flustered Draco even more. Why could Potter not see his point?!
Dinner that evening was a lively affair. Hermione and Ginny were forgiving despite having waited for the boys, but since the two women had spent the time exchanging stories and sharing their career plans, neither noticed the time.
"None that we know of."
"What the bloody hell does that mean?!" Ron roared. "Are you saying we've been tailing the wrong fucking guy
"I can't believe I'll be grounded in four weeks," Ginny mumbled into Harry's shoulder. They had just Apparated from St. Mungo's, both collapsing onto the couch in exhaustion.
As it turned out, Harry didn't have to wait long.
"I was joking," Malfoy sighed dramatically. "I swear, I haven't had to be this sensitive and nice and warm and fuzzy for someone in years."
Harry looked up uncertainly at his best mate's scrutinizing eyes, searching for some sort of judgment from the redhead's expression. He found none.
"Yes, yes," Draco replied with an exaggerated long-suffering sigh. "She knows my life is in peril, and understands what's at stake."
"This is a unique situation, but not uncommon. There have been precedents, and this type of delivery has been practiced successfully in the last decade."
Potter huffed. "Of course you have. The entire magical community has." He scrunched up his nose in distaste. "As if there weren't anything else they could talk about my life, eh? A relationship scandal is sure to bring up every wrong thing I've ever done in this world since I was born."
He had never thought Malfoy's life to be lacking in any way, and lonely wasn't exactly the word to use on him. He had already seen the blond mingling with his best friends, and had observed that they were indeed close, though perhaps more formally than he, Ron and Hermione acted amongst each other
Draco was surprised. "We just spent two hours voluntarily discussing nappies, crying and politics," he said in awe. "I think we're actually acting like adults now, in the most boring way. A bit more food and we're well on our way to Slughorn level."
Draco groaned. He had never felt more lost than he did now, having met someone with whom he could verbally spar with, someone he could see as his equal, only to lose them right after. (There was always Potter, of course, but he didn't want to think about
: (flips confusedly through notes) Oh, er- yes - here's another one. How are you dealing with your recent promotion in the Auror Corps?
When Draco followed her train of thought, he blanched. "Merlin! Nothing like that, Mother! I would never do that to Astoria!"
"Well..."
"The sooner, the better."
When the Floo got cut off, Harry suddenly felt like he'd just been out flying at top speed, an odd sensation where his heart and mind felt feather-light and his body was pounding with the adrenaline of being in the air. He wondered idly what could have caused it, but soon forgot as he went about preparing for the rest of the day, mentally filing away the new development for Mal - Draco's case.
"Yes," Draco replied. "It's a system not widely used in the last century, and I only managed to work it out because our library happened to have original manuscripts written in the same style. It wasn't common though, not even in northern Europe, which means the guys you want have some sort of direct link to that part of the world, possibly someone with a direct inheritance of family history there."
"It eases my worries to see you so dedicated," she said finally. "Thank you."
Draco saw Hermione pursing her lips and knew that she was already thinking of the possible avenues of research she would take. Truly brilliant, that girl.
"Impressive," Harry said. "This must be of high confidentiality, since even I never knew that."
"And it doesn't ring any bells? Jog your memory any way at all?"
Ella shook her head. "So far… no red flags, no history, wow, not even a minor. The guy must be good at keeping under the radar."
Astoria looked at him blankly. "You really think you're interpreting all of that correctly? It sounds as if you had just pulled all of that out of nowhere..."
It was over before they'd even realized. Draco, being aware of the procedure in theory, expected a brief clashing of torsos, shoulders and arms, lasting just long enough to satisfy the physical proximity that the last part of the ritual required. He was surprised, therefore, when they both ended up holding onto each other in a much firmer embrace, lasting just a little longer than was actually required.
Harry looked once more at Draco. "You know, you're not such a bad party guest after all."
Malfoy slowly nodded. "Yeah, I absolutely dreaded having to come here to visit Great Aunt Walburga. Horrifying woman. I must have been very young back then, but I was glad when we didn't have to visit anymore." He looked Harry in the eye. "To be honest, if I had inherited this place, I would have left it alone. You did a much better job bringing it back to life."
son, now, eh?"
The blond shook his head. "Nothing. Even my elves confirmed the absence of such traces."
Narcissa waited patiently before the doors, motioning for her son to hurry up and enter before her. He had every right to be there first, as the father of the child, while she had the right to present her grandchild with his new name. Astoria's parents were already behind her, just as impatient to meet the newest heir to the Houses of Malfoy and Greengrass.
"Okay," Poter nodded. "I'd hate to be rude, but see, I am sort of expecting an important call, and you're blocking my Floo," he finished sheepishly.
"What's so bad about that!" Harry exclaimed. "We were having a perfectly fine Saturday morning."
"Gin, that's just stupid," Harry countered, shaking his head in disbelief. "I can't think of any reason we'll need much more space than what we have here. Your own room is still right
doing here?" Ginny asked, her voice dropping to a whisper so that neither Ron nor Malfoy could hear.
"Oh, Draco!" she all but squealed into his ear. "We knew that it was going to happen around this week, but we didn't find out until today, when Harry showed us your letter! Congratulations!"
Ron and Ella were ahead, already sorting quickly through the reports from the first letter.
Draco, in a valiant effort to show he didn’t care, refused to speak, but it didn't seem to faze the man at all.
"Her-Hermione.. she..."
To his amusement, Potter seemed to resign himself to his new companion, and finally got up to follow him.
It was said so sharply that Harry knew it had been difficult to swallow her pride and thank them, which made the gesture even more significant.
How could anyone even forget their birthday? Draco couldn't help but wonder at Harry's odd behavior.
Harry nodded his understanding. Alright. We've got everything to get this approved by tonight. I'll call when it pushes through."
He leaned against the wall just outside the lockers. His body was exhausted, but he still felt a certain pride knowing that he was already on the way to becoming an Auror.
long engagement. Especially for a pureblood union. Almost as long as yours and Ginny's."
Weasley shook his head, looking grave. "It seems that the first threat wasn't sent from here at all. Whoever it was… was actually in France with you. But I'm still sure that they're from here, or know you from here."
Ron shrugged, taking the hint to move on from the topic. "So when are we eating that pie? Why'd you put away the pie? I want some of that pie!"
"I'm sure they'll be fine," Arthur murmured reassuringly, but it sounded empty to Harry. All he wanted was for Ginny and the baby to be alright, to come out of this safe and sound, but he couldn't even be assured of that yet, not at the rate the Healers were going.
Throughout their cool acquaintance for the first few years after the war, there was no reason whatsoever for either of them to stay updated about their respective relationships. Sure, Draco and Astoria had invited the Chosen couple to their wedding, but that was more for their own benefit and publicity. With the release of Potter's
"You've been talking too much with Hermione," Harry said, rolling his eyes.
Taking out the list, he perused it and made marks next to each item - a systematic set of symbols he had developed to help himself keep track of magical properties and other characteristics. In Potions, it was very difficult to categorize ingredients, as there was much overlap among even the most varied items. Draco's personal symbols allowed him to note many things at once, allowing him to observe patterns that he may have missed the first time.
"And you would know?" Draco said without thinking. His heart stopped for a millisecond. Would Potter let slip something more about his own secret, or-?
"Er, alright," he managed to blurt out as Draco helped himself to the Floo powder. "Mind your head, wouldn't want to damage your overinflated ego."
, Harry thought stubbornly.
"I'm not cheating on Astoria," he said blandly, guessing (correctly) that she was still thinking it. "Why are you so sure that I would do such a dishonor to our family, Mother?"
"You forget I almost offed you single handedly in that bathroom," Harry said sharply, in an effort to bring Draco away from his maudlin thoughts. "I'm not a saint, you know. Yes, I care when people get hurt, but this is just really personal for me and I don't care who saves who. You've saved me, too, at the Manor. I'll never forget that."
"Thanks again for the tea," he said, ignoring the fact that Ginevra was clearly looking at the glasses of Firewhiskey. "Much appreciated. Perhaps we should set more time for further discussions." He nodded imperiously, first at Ginevra, then at Potter, before disappearing out of the Floo.
Draco watched in horrified silence as his wife, in all her pale glory, slowly circled him, expressionless eyes transfixed at the sight of her restrained husband.
For the nth time, Draco rolled his eyes. He would never hear the end of it.
, Draco reminded himself) chose that moment to walk into the room with a flustered blush. She shuffled a wad of parchment towards Weasley, who was sitting at the head of the conference table putting together what the rest of the team had assembled that week.
A suspicious look flitted onto Malfoy face, but it passed by so quickly that Harry was sure he'd only imagined it. Instead, the new father seemed to change his tactics. "Did Pansy put you up to this? Or perhaps Blaise?" Malfoy demanded.
Though Ron wouldn't say it out loud, Harry knew that his best mate had something going on with Hermione. Their disagreements had increased, even more than the usual amount of bickering one expected from their relationship. In fact, he expected that Hermione's pregnancy had affected them almost as much as Ginny's had with her and Harry. He knew that both of his best friends did their best to handle their domestic problems in private, and indeed Ron had never slacked off while he was on the job. Despite his carefree attitude and happy go lucky personality around friends and family, Auror Weasley still kept up a fierce reputation amongst the other Aurors, who did their best to avoid his temper. In fact, no suspect so far had escaped the inevitable breakdown and confession after only fifteen minutes of interrogation with both Harry and Ron. No one in the department ever questioned their authority, and they found that they liked it that way.
"It was the weekend, Gin," Harry said, trying to sound patient. "Ron and I go out all the time, so I fail to see how this was different."
Draco bit his lip. Potter frowned. "What?" he asked.
"No, that doesn't make sense!" he denied vehemently, scowling at this strange person who was tormenting him for no reason. "Just get to the point and do whatever you planned to do!"
Draco did as he was told, feeling dissociated from the moment. So much had changed in his life in just the last hour. France! Potter! He wasn't even paying attention when Kingsley repeated the same actions, sealing the parchment with a tap of his wand. Draco was still in a daze as Kingsley stood up to shake his hand.
Potter acted as though it were a normal conversation though. "That's wonderful, mate!" he said. Draco noticed that the brunet kept his tone light. His smile was no less friendly. "Have you thought of any names?"
Of course, neither Ron nor Hermione, or even Ginny actually knew about the Sorting Hat story, but it made him feel bad that he couldn't readily open up these small secrets to those who were closest to him.
When Draco nodded his agreement, the elf let out a visible sigh of relief. He wanted to touch the letter out of curiosity, but his paranoid self knew better. "It is from an unknown source, but made it through the wards. Has it been checked for malicious charms or Dark Magic?"
"-but we did it all backwards, didn't we?" Ginny asked rhetorically. "We were supposed to settle down after we were both satisfied, and just ready. But James happened, and..."
Harry was beginning to realize just how much they didn't know about each other's history. It made him wonder how many times he and Malfoy could have reacted better to their mutual animosity had they any idea of the other's past. Now that they were able to talk like this, it almost seemed silly to think that Malfoy couldn't get over his old prejudice against Muggles, or Harry, the bias against purebloods that he had absorbed from the first moment he had entered the magical community. It had shaped the way their lives went so many years ago, but now it all seemed so silly.
"Wow, Harry," Ginny said, shaking her head. "Pop out our kid, that's a lovely euphemism. So romantic of you."
"What was that about?" Ginny asked, her eyebrows high on her forehead as she stared at Malfoy's disappearance through the Floo.
"Fine," Harry said. "I'm just really worried about you, okay? So sue me."
He had never seen the well-rumored combined power that was Potter and Weasley at their most threatening, but when he did, he promised himself never ever ever to cross them and end up facing against them. Word around the Auror Corps was that the MMI heads had never failed to break into any criminal presented before them. After that particular half hour, Draco no longer doubted the stories. He had laughed about Weasley being called "scary", but now he knew that the right word was "terrifying". Why he ever thought the redhead was a spineless loser, Draco couldn't fathom, not after seeing him like that.
"Yes, oh," Ginny said, nodding her head with amusement, as if talking to a toddler. "Let's be realistic here. I love you, Harry, I really do and I love our boys, but think about it. Somewhere along the way, it'll be inevitable. You and I both will eventually meet someone, fall
"Nothing much we can do about it," Draco sighed. "I'm scheduled two weeks from now."
Potter's eyebrow quirked up at this, but he didn't say anything in response. Instead, he distracted himself by checking the time again and promptly standing up. At Draco's inquiring look, he gave a lopsided, albeit brilliant smile, which definitely caught him off guard.
The smug kidnapper gave no response, merely content with watching Draco. The blond decided for a different approach.
Draco had never felt more helpless than he did now. All sense of confidence had fled his being, now that it became apparent that his son might be in terrible danger. He hadn't heard back yet from either Weasley or Harry since he informed them of Scorpius' possible curse. To relieve his nerves in the meantime, he, Narcissa and Astoria had combed through as much of the Malfoy library as they could, searching every sheaf and scroll for more information about the protection ward that had failed.
Realizing that he couldn't stand Ron being in such a bad mood, he finally stood up and went over to his partner's desk. Ron barely even looked up at his approach.
She had just signed up for introductory training into the Holyhead Harpies, and Harry indulged her need to talk about it all of the time because it made him happy to see her so excited about it.
Draco looked at Potter seriously. "That bad, eh?"
Draco continued to stare at him, wide eyed at Harry's own admission as he went on.
Ron cocked his head. "Pureblood traditions aside, I didn't think you would ever go that route. You just don't come across as the kind of parent to even let go of your son for five minutes," he said with a smirk. "I know you're more of a hands-on dad and all. Even I'm not that kind of a dad, though I do like spending time with my kids."
Ron finally looked up, his face showing more worry lines and his skin betraying his obvious lack of sleep. It took a while, but he nodded his agreement, arranging the parchment on his desk before stepping out with Harry.
.' That was it."
Going to and from the Ministry was beginning to get old. Draco had already accepted this unfortunate event to be part of his routine, but he couldn't help but be exhausted from it. The monthly visits to the DMLE were required by his probation, in order for him to be evaluated repeatedly and ensure that he wasn't up to something sinister. Presently, he had two more months left to his probation, and he was surprised to receive a summons to meet with the Minister himself.
"I just mean, well," Narcissa took a deep breath before looking straight into his silver eyes. "What I mean to say, is that as your mother, I have been noting several signs, possible indications..."
They were on the roof of the building. It wasn't supposed to be very high up, since she knew that Harry's floor, the top, was the fourth. But the view in front of of them should have been more appropriate from the twentieth floor of a high rise building. She looked to him with eyes full of wonder. "Harry, what...?"
"That makes sense," the blond said, amusement in his grey eyes. "I swear, the conversations I have with you lot...and we've only just got here." It was then that he seemed to notice their empty glasses and gestured towards the barman. "Another round, then?"
"I want you, Harry. I want to be with you, and I want to be with James, and I want you both to see and know and feel that It's true!"
"I don't. In any case, those of the Noble House of Black do not make fools of themselves in public," Narcissa amended with a smirk. She hugged her son tightly. "How is she?"
"I don't doubt it," Astoria laughed. "I suppose it remains to be one of your more endearing qualities."
"Who even tells you that?" he asked, suddenly curious. What stupid person would ever think that Hermione couldn't do anything?
"Ridiculous," Draco couldn't help but interrupt indignantly. "I've a good memory-"
"Nothing," she shrugged. "I was just thinking about how great it is that you're finally able to do what you want, when you want to and how you want to. It's so refreshing to see you sure about what you're doing."
. His interest in Magical Theory won out, and he spent some time trying to break down how he himself was affected by the invocation on Potter. Granted, since they were something more than acquaintances, but less than friends, he probably figured above the general public in Potter's eyes, and therefore received less of the generalized compulsion not to notice them when they desired extra privacy. That would explain why he could see and recognize Potter and Girl-Weasley, even exchanging a greeting or two. He just never thought of them as a couple, or even gave it a thought, which, now that that particular ward had been lifted, he thought was odd for an information-starved Slytherin like himself. He would have filed it away in his mind, if only to pull it out later for leverage. It was just something he had been taught, and that he had retained.
Draco was surprised, but silently agreed. He himself had been afraid of his son's upbringing. Sure, he had grown up knowing what rules were to be introduced, what behavior was to be rewarded or punished, but it was only recently, after the War and after his mother's separation from Lucius that he began to wonder what exactly it meant to have children - because he knew that it was so very different from 'having heirs'.
"And then," she continued, "maybe when I get tired of being famous and touring around the world for tourneys, maybe we can have that happily ever after."
food from two rooms away.
"Contract stipulations? You mean the marriage contract?"
She pulled away and blinked her tears out of her brown eyes. "I still love you Harry, I know that I do, but... maybe it's not the same kind of love that we wanted it to be," she said sadly.
"That's exactly right," Draco answered with a note of praise. "Such a smart boy I've got! Now let's get you all dressed up for today's trip!"
: We're keeping it small and private, just with family and some friends. But perhaps another interview.
"And those are…?" Harry asked, confused. Had he missed a memo in his absence?
Anyway, just to clear up chronology. The events are happening in proper chronological order, arranged by year, but not spaced out in a regular way. For example, different sections within a chapter could be just minutes apart, or a few days, or a few months. I usually try to make it clear within the transitions, but feel free to point out if ever you are confused. I wanted my fic to jump through both small and large chunks of time to show the way the characters develop.
"Are you serious?" Harry gritted between his teeth. "Really?!"
Astoria huffed tiredly. "I know," she replied. "I just couldn't sleep."
As if on cue, a sudden pop and a flash of light blinded Harry for a moment, and when the haze of smoke disappeared he saw George fiddling with a camera. "Got it!" the prankster said. "This photo will definitely make me a millionaire! Oh but wait, I can't sell it! Damn! It's illegal now! Oh, woe is me!" He gave a dramatic sigh, then laughed along with everyone as he joined them at the table.
pity."
They were so different, and yet so alike in many ways. They understood each other in a way that no one else could.
"It's hardly the same, Ron," Hermione interrupted. "I was overworking myself, and I realized later on that I wasn't going about my career the right way. Ginny-"
"The translation of the translation, you idiot," Ron said, pointing at the words scribbled next to Malfoy's original transliteration.
Five minutes later Draco comes out of the bathroom, walking back to the bedroom, “Potter?” he calls out.
“You’re not like that,” Harry says, looking at Draco.
“Yes,” Draco says, crossing his arms over his chest, “I prefer to get blood other ways,” he says.
Harry blushes again, “Well,”
“I don’t want to hurt you,” Draco says.
Harry frowns, he thought he had just explained this to him, “I’m here to help-“
Another minute later Draco pulls back retracting his fangs before licking the excess blood from the corner of his mouth.
Draco waves his wand, bringing a second coffee mug from the counter top in the kitchen, setting it on the table in front of Harry, before using his wand to pour coffee from the pot in the center of the table.
Draco slides his hand between Harry’s legs, and Harry shudders against Draco’s body, as Draco performs a lubrication charm and his finger pressed against Harry’s entrance.
Draco raises an eyebrow at this, “Her brother isn’t Ansel Carr, is he?”
“No, I don’t want him,” Harry says.
“I want to see,” Harry says, drinking in every inch of Draco’s body.
“Okay,” Draco says, moving around Blaise’s body, as he dances, making sure to keep Blaise’s hands on his body.
Draco nods, “yes,” he says softly, looking down at Harry, his core buzzing with desire, as Harry slides the zipper of his trousers down. Draco bites his lower lip to stop himself from whining in desperation.
Draco leads them to the ground, Harry laying back in the grass, a soft moan escaping his lips as Draco’s fingers trail over his inner thigh.
“Did you have a date planned?” Harry asks less out of curiosity and more because he wanted to make sure Draco hadn’t started seeing someone else in the last week.
Draco stares back at Harry, “Then why the hell are you here?”
“Thank you,” Harry says, helping himself to a sandwich.
“I don’t care about our family name!” Narcissa says that wasn’t true though, she cared very much about the way people saw her. She came from wizarding royalty, and there was a certain level of prestige she was expected to have, and that did not include a vampire for a son.
Harry frowns, he loved Draco he never wanted anyone to say horrible things about him.
Draco moans, and his body shivers, “Then don’t,” he pants, as his eyes roll back.
“Taking nights off work, throwing him parties,” Ron says, “doing anything he asks, you’re just spoiling him.”
reading an article on fang lengthening while drinking a coffee. Draco looks up when he hears the fireplace whir and lets out an annoyed sigh when Harry steps out of the fireplace.
Draco nods, “Vampires just age differently, the oldest is said to have lived to be over a thousand,” Draco says, “but most live to be somewhere around six hundred give or take a few years.”
Draco rolls his eyes, “Well what about you then?” he asks, “new boyfriend?”
“Well it’s my birthday and I don’t want to do this today,” Draco says turning to look at Harry.
Draco shakes his head, “keep going,” he whispers softly, refraining from stroking Harry’s hair.
“You must go,” Lucius says, “You must go now, and never return.”
“Draco,” Harry says softly, pulling the sheets up around his body.
“My food isn’t a very attractive man,” Harry insists.
“Yes,” Draco says, “I only use feeders, so I can hone the skill really,” he says, “It’s only partly instinctual, there’s still a skill to it, and I still don’t always get it right.”
“You can’t stay here Draco,” Astoria says quietly, the two of them standing just outside her house.
“I’m going to take a bath,” he says, turning away quickly before walking back to his bedroom.
Draco looks at Harry confused, “I don’t understand.”
“I know,” he says, “I just hated the way she was talking about you,” he sighs.
“Draco please,” Anthony says softly, “It’s not like that.”
Hermione looks at Harry, “is it more than just casual Harry?” she asks.
Toby nods, leaning in kissing Draco once more, pulling Draco’s leg over his lap. Draco leans into Toby, kissing him faster, letting Toby’s hands rest on his waist, and find a tiny bit of exposed skin at his hips.
“Draco, I know you’re upset, but you can’t go off-“
Harry sighs, “I was fine just snogging, but then I don’t know what happened, I started feeling like something wasn’t right,” he says, “but all I can think about is snogging him,” he sighs, “How can I feel both?” he mumbles.
“Please,” Harry whimpers.
Draco looks at Harry but doesn’t answer.
Harry looks at Draco, about to open his mouth to speak but then Draco says, “by that point, you’re much too weak to hunt though,” he says.
Draco leans in looking for her vein, he was sort of scared and wondered if it was too late to back out now.
Harry smiles, “You can pretend all you want, but I know you have feelings Malfoy, and it’s okay to show them sometimes.”
“I know,” Harry says, “he was completely trying to take advantage of you, so I took you back here,” Harry says.
Draco stares dumbly, he would let Harry do anything to him right about now, and it helped that Harry was dripping wet, having just stepped from the lake, and he was wearing nothing. Draco quickly undressed, walking over to the edge of the lake, taking hold of Harry’s outstretched hand, as he steps into the cool lake with Harry.
Harry exhales heavily, looking at Draco, but before Harry could say anything Draco interrupts, “Look at it this way, you have a ham sandwich,” Draco says, “does it make sense for me to jealous of the pig?”
Harry blinks at Draco for a moment before he clears his throat, “Goodnight Draco,” he says.
“It’s fine,” Draco says softly, “don’t worry about it.”
Draco looks back at Harry, he doesn’t think he could look away if he tried but he’s not trying. Harry’s face in the dim light of the hallway, his eyes soft and his lips so full and beautiful. He absolutely needed to stop thinking about Harry like this, right fucking now, needed to stop.
When Harry comes, sweat coats his body, and he can’t see anything but white sparks in front of his eyelids, and he screams fucking screams as his come spurts hot and fast from his leaking cock, all over his stomach, and chest. And he can’t remember his goddamn name. Draco’s hips still as he comes seconds later, a loud moan erupting from within him that he had absolutely zero control over.
“There can’t be that many vampires in London,” Draco says.
“Well that’s too bad,” Harry says, “Because I’m not going anywhere until you talk to me.”
“I know we had a fight Astoria, but I don’t remember what it was about, I promise not to hurt you in your sleep,” he says.
“Well I wasn’t very nice to him either, but none of that gets in the way when we talk to each other,” he says.
“You’re angry,” Harry says quietly.
Blaise ignores Draco and shoves the shoes at him. Draco sighs, sitting down to put on the boots. And damn it if he didn’t look great. Looking in the mirror Draco stood there looking at himself, and damn if he didn’t want to fuck himself. He would definitely get himself laid tonight.
Draco comes a moment later, Harry’s name on his lips, and his entire body is trembling, and he can feel his skin buzzing.
“Hey,” he says softly, “It’s alright,” he says quietly trying to coax Draco back to him, “It’s okay Malfoy.”
Harry doesn’t feel like he’s just walked in on Draco feeding, what he saw looked like much more than that.
“But that better be the extent of it, because you know if I ever found out you were dropping things for me, that I would be angry with you,” Draco says, looking back at Harry, “He’s right people are going to start talking.”
“Do you have a problem with me feeding?” Draco says harshly.
Draco looks over at Harry, “you want to try that again, with the truth this time?”
Harry shrugs, “I just asked around, it’s like your wizarding royalty or something,” he teases.
Cami smiles leaning over, “Have a drink, you’ll feel better,” she says.
Draco shrugs, “I don’t think anyone who isn’t a vampire would know any of that.”
Harry sighs, and lets his hand close in on Draco’s a little tighter, “I do want to talk, but maybe later.”
Draco watches the other vampires feed for another moment, before he nods, “alright,” he agrees, “I’ll give it a try.”
“No,” Harry says quickly, “not at all, I will come back later!”
Harry looks back at Draco, “How often do you do that?” he asks.
“I want you to talk to me,” Harry says.
Draco gasps, his textbook falling out of his hand and onto the floor. His eyes staring dumbly at Harry’s hand grasping onto his, he doesn’t pull his hand away, but his brain short circuits. It takes twenty seconds before Draco finds his voice again. When his voice quivers ever so slightly Draco wants to swear, but he forces the words out anyway despite himself.
Harry rolls his eyes, “I was thinking you might want to spend time with the person that you’re dating, but why would you want to do that,” Harry says.
Harry frowns, “I’m sorry,” he says rather quietly.
“We’re going to be late,” she says, “you said we were only going to be here for a minute, and you’ve spent nearly ten interrogating Harry about something he clearly doesn’t want to talk about.”
“Of course, sir,” Zella answers preparing Draco’s breakfast.
Draco stares back at Harry, he wants to ask him what he knows, but his head is spinning right now. Draco rubs at his eyes, pinching the bridge of his nose, “I can’t do this right now.”
Ginny Weasley was speechless, she stared back at Harry in complete shock.
Harry clears his throat, “I wasn’t at that party last week because Luna asked me to be there,” he says.
Blaise looks back at Draco, he wants to insist Draco show him, but he had more respect for his friend than he had curiosity, “Alright,” he says, deciding Draco would show him when he was ready.
Harry eyes Draco suspiciously, but takes a seat at the table across from Draco, watching him curiously.
“Potter, this is not the time,” Draco mumbles.
Harry can’t say that isn’t true because Draco is right, without blood, he would be a creature who kills to survive.
Harry matches Draco’s smirk before leaning down, pressing their lips together, kissing him both firmly but gently at the same time, letting his hands trail over Draco’s chest, catching his nipple between his fingers, causing Draco to moan into the kiss, and arch his back.
“All that’s left is B negative,” she says.
“Why can’t you just tell me?” he asks.
“It’s the fucking truth!” Draco says angrily.
Harry gestures to his neck.
“Do you know which pub you were going to?” Harry asks.
Draco finds himself at a party and having to confront things about his new condition that he hadn't thought about, and then he has a little fun afterward.
Harry can’t stand it another moment; he leans over pressing his lips firmly against Draco’s, kissing him hard on the mouth. Draco doesn’t care if Harry’s messing up his lipstick, and Harry doesn’t care if he’s getting red lipstick all over his mouth. Harry’s hand finds its way into Draco’s long blonde hair, pulling them closer together, as he kisses him. A soft quiet moan forms in Draco’s throat, as Harry’s tongue, slips past his lips, and brushes against his own, and Draco’s hands, are in Harry’s dark, tousled curls, suddenly wanting more from his lover.
“Has the transition been difficult?” Harry asks.
The sheer grace as Draco pulls Harry into his lap, another more desperate whimper escaping Harry’s lips, as his legs settle on either side of Draco’s thighs. Draco keeps his hand on Harry’s waist, keeping him close, as he reaches between their bodies with his other hand, and Harry sobs as Draco’s hand wraps around both of their cocks, and it takes every ounce of willpower Harry has not to thrust his hips upwards, to seek more contact. Harry knows this is a test, and if he passes, he shall be rewarded.
Draco laughs, “Well I do know how to throw a party,” he says before sipping his blood wine.
“I’m just here to help,” Harry says, stepping closer to the bed, “They said you came to earlier, so I came as soon as I could.”
“Vampirism?” he asks dumbly, “I am not a vampire,” Draco says, staring back at her, when she doesn’t say anything else, Draco quickly reaches for the plastic tubing carrying the blood from the newly hung blood bag, however the nurse was quicker than he was, quickly stilling his hand.
Draco can’t help being mesmerized by Harry’s green eyes, “Nice catch,” he says breathlessly.
“So, are those like coffee cakes then?” Harry asks curiously.
Draco glares back at Anthony, “I certainly didn’t ask to drink your blood,” he says harshly, “And what makes you think that’s something I would want to do?”
Hermione gets up, walking down to the girl's dormitory leaving Harry alone with his thoughts, which on second thought wasn’t the best place for Harry to be right now.
“But that guy in France was just a lunatic,” Draco says, “Product of inbreeding I suspect,” he mutters.
“Draco,” Harry moans again, “Draco, Draco, Draco!”
“Fine,” Draco says, swallowing his entire glass of wine in two gulps, “I’m going to go now then.”
“That’s all for now,” he says, dismissing her.
Anthony smiles, before going off to get two firewhiskeys for the two of them.
“Is that just how fast or slow you suck?” Draco asks.
“No,” Draco says.
Harry smiles, “Okay,” he says, leaving it at that, “well enjoy your meal,” Harry says, and then, “Oh that is weird.” And Draco laughs.
Harry leans over pressing a kiss to Draco’s forehead, pulling Draco closer to him. Draco sighs contently, as he closes his eyes letting himself drift back off to sleep. Harry soon falls asleep, wrapped around Draco’s small body.
“This is not a negotiation,” Draco says firmly.
“They’re hardly worth my time,” Astoria says, and Draco can’t say he blamed her, he was honestly thinking about giving up dating altogether, though he might change his mind for one wizard, but he knew how likely that was, and he wasn’t going to hold his fucking breath.
“Happy birthday,” she smiles.
“What you saw was a willing volunteer,” Draco says, “and I surely didn’t hurt her.”
Harry rolls his eyes, of course, how could he think that Draco fucking Malfoy wouldn’t tell him exactly how he wanted it. He leans down a second later, taking Draco’s cock back into his mouth, causing Draco to shudder beneath him.
Blaise hands Draco his drink and smiles when he sees the pretty girl from across the club standing next to Draco.
“Oh fuck,” Draco swears loudly, as Harry sinks lower onto his cock, “fuck Harry, yes.”
Blaise looks around, he hadn’t even noticed, until Draco had pointed it out to him.
“I just woke up, I haven’t had anything yet today,” he mutters, “and I’m rather thirsty.” Thirsty was an understatement, Draco had wanted blood the moment he woke up, but he wanted a shower more, so he waited, and by the time he allowed himself to indulge his fangs had already been waiting, anticipating, the delicious and somehow nutritious liquid that would get him through the day.
Harry looks up at Draco, losing his grip, but not letting him go, “Sometimes people just need hugs, and you don’t always have to ask for one.”
“Let’s get out of here,” he manages a moment later.
“No, he’s not,” Draco agrees.
She reaches out examining the fangs, “I’ll bring you another blood bag,” she says before getting up, walking back into the hallway.
Draco thinks hard, he vaguely remembers making Blaise promise him something, he’s not sure if that was what he made him promise though, “I remember asking you to make sure I went through with it.”
“It wasn’t real,” he says after a moment of silence, “we were never really together.”
“Why are you even here talking to Potter?” Draco asks.
Draco glares back at Harry, “It turns out not to have been the worst thing that’s ever happened to me,” he snarls, “That honor would go to meeting you.”
Harry looks back at Ron and tries his damnedest not to get emotional, “He’s got more than just this mean exterior.”
Harry laughs, “I usually don’t have to tell someone I’m flirting with them.”
“And you are?” He asks looking her up and down, seeing Luna wearing golden jewelry all over her body, golden watches, necklaces, rings, and bracelets hanging everywhere on her.
“Halfway?” Harry laughs, “that’s a step up from ‘I hate you’ so I guess I’ll take it,” he teases.
Draco’s mind is a complete haze, he can’t focus on anything that’s not the way his cock feels moving in and out of Harry’s mouth, and fuck does it feel amazing. Draco can’t help but think that Harry’s done this more than a few times for him to be this good at it. Draco enjoyed sucking cock just as much as the next guy but with Harry, it was a goddamn art form.
Blaise looks back at Draco, “but you’re a vampire now, you can’t hide them forever.”
Blaise rolls his eyes and decides to take Draco’s advice, worst case scenario he gets drunk and has a good time with his friends. He reaches over, taking the glass out of Draco’s hand, finishing the last of his mead.
“What do you mean?” Harry asks.
“Thanks,” Draco says, taking the glass from her, taking a drink.
“I don’t bite, I swear,” Draco says, and then smiles when Toby takes his hand, walking them back to an empty booth toward the back of the club. Draco falls into the booth, and Toby slides in next to him.
Harry stares dumbly at Draco, “You can’t tell me?” he asks.
“I hadn’t thought of it like that,” Harry says.
“Draco,” Harry murmurs.
Draco brings the bag to his mouth once more, sucking quickly and swallowing at the same time. Draco finds himself getting lost in the sensation of the blood traveling through his fangs, causing them to recede back into his mouth, and the room temperature blood to drip down his throat. Draco felt a sort of warm sensation that reminded him of drinking a warm butterbeer. Draco squeezes the bag tight, as the last bit of blood flows into his mouth.
Hermione stares back at Ginny with wide eyes, and her mouth opens in shock, “Ginny,” she hisses.
Ron rolls his eyes, “Even he’s willing to admit it.”
“I would have never guessed,” Harry says.
Draco nods, “How did you even find me here?” he asks curiously.
When Hermione and Ginny leave, Harry has this heavy feeling in his chest, he sort of just wants to go back to bed, and stay forever, but he knows if he doesn’t go and see Draco tonight, he’ll never know if he can truly be with him.
Harry laughs because it was funny that Ron thought Draco could be any more spoiled than he already was, “He’s my boyfriend, and it’s his birthday,” Harry says, “I’ve thrown you plenty of parties.”
Harry wouldn’t let up until Draco agreed to do it again, proving that he had more control than he was willing to admit to himself. After that Draco began to feel like he was exploiting Harry because he loved the taste of his blood. Draco compromised with himself, by never once asking Harry to let him feed on him, but only doing so when Harry offered himself to Draco. And Harry often offered himself to Draco, letting it slip once that it made him happy that he could provide Draco with blood he needed to survive, and the fact that Draco actually enjoyed it, made it easier for Harry to put up with the discomfort of being bitten and having his blood drain into Draco’s mouth.
A moment later Draco feels a bit of blood slip past the corner of his mouth, he swallows quickly as he pulls his fangs from Camilla’s neck.
“Malfoy,” Harry says gently.
“At least I got to do it on my own terms,” Draco says, before meeting Harry’s eyes, “I’m sorry about that Potter, really.”
“Draco, have you met Camilla?” Neil asks looking over at Draco.
“So,” Draco retorts.
“I-I want y-you” Draco stutters, looking down at Harry. Harry doesn’t want to, but he lets Draco pull his cock from his mouth, he undresses quickly with promises of being filled with Draco’s cock in another moment.
Draco couldn’t think of anywhere else he’d rather be in the middle of the night, than skinny dipping with Harry, and from what he can tell, Harry’s enjoying their time together too. They stay like this for a while, swimming together and splashing each other in the water and for the first time in a long time, possibly ever, Draco is having fun.
“Sorry Professor McGonagall,” Draco says, glancing over at her for a brief moment before he turns around walking off in the direction of the library.
“See you tomorrow,” Blaise says, closing the curtains on his bed.
“I’m ready,” she says moving her long blonde hair away from her neck, and Draco bites into her neck, piercing her vein before sinking his bottom fangs into her muscle as her blood begins to flow into Draco’s mouth, and he swallows quickly.
Harry nods, “Alright,” he agrees, “but I want to shower first.”
Draco nods, “alright then,” he says.
Harry nods, too tired to move right now. Draco gently shifts Harry in an attempt to lift him off, causing the brunette to whine in a desperate protest, “Draco no,” he murmurs.
Draco shrugs, “That’s the last thing I remember, I don’t remember leaving my house, I don’t remember anything after that. I was standing by the fireplace with Blaise, and that’s it.”
“Sleep,” Draco mumbles.
“Do you always have to be in control of every aspect of your life?”
“You think that because you’re gay too, you know what it’s like to be me?” Draco says.
The following afternoon Draco finds himself sitting in his living room with Blaise. Draco couldn’t resist any longer, he had to ask Blaise what happened that night.
Harry nods, smiling, “it’s good for you.”
“That’s a lovely costume,” Draco turns around to see Luna Lovegood standing behind him.
Harry looks at Draco, “sure,” he says after a long moment.
It’s only after Draco’s finished his third bowl, and he’s completely satisfied, that he realized his fangs have yet to recede. Draco reaches up, gently touching at his fangs, careful of the points. He wasn’t thirsty anymore, so why did he still have fangs.
Harry takes one more look at his lover, biting the inside of his lip, before walking away to get himself another drink.
“Would you like some porridge?” Draco asks, eating some more of his breakfast.
Harry clears his throat, “I meant finding out I wasn’t straight” he murmurs.
“I-I” Harry stammers, “That’s not what I meant Malfoy,” he says, “sorry, I didn’t mean it to come out like that,” he sighs, “I just didn’t realize there were other guys here,” he says stopping himself, “I’m sorry.”
Draco laughs, “You throw the best parties, Neil.”
Draco plunges the spoon into the bowl, spooning the icy red blood dessert into his mouth, “This is amazing,” he mumbles, shoveling more into his mouth, trying to savor every single bite.
Draco scoffs, “fine then,” he says, sitting down on the plush ottoman, waiting for Blaise to bring him clothes.
“Oh, now you want to say something to my face?” Draco says.
Harry can’t remember what he wanted, “can’t remember,” he says.
“You do know you’re agreeing to go out to someone who’s an asshole,” Draco says.
It’s two months after his attack, Draco has come to terms with his new life, he may not like how things happened, but he’s learned to accept how things have played out for him. Draco’s even allowed himself to make a few new friends. Tonight, Draco was going to a party at his new friend, Neil’s house. Neil was a vampire like Draco. Draco met Neil at
Harry rolls his eyes, “What’s it matter?” he asks.
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry groans, letting his eyes slip shut, as he tosses his head back, grinding his hips down against Draco’s, “Yes, Draco!”
Draco nods, “and I hear it’s weird for humans to see a vampire actually drinking from another person.”
“Yeah,” Draco says.
Anthony smiles, “You’re not sure?”
Thank you so much for reading! I really hope you enjoyed this chapter! We're about halfway through the story. I do realize it's a very long read, but I do appreciate you sticking it out and reading it <3 Thank you so very much!
Harry stares back at Draco, “Does it hurt?” he asks.
“Hmm,” Blaise hums.
A low moan escapes Draco’s lips, as Harry takes more of him into his mouth. Harry’s tongue presses against the underside of Draco’s cock, playfully licking at the slit at the tip of his cock, “Oh, fuck,” Draco moans, as his eyes slip shut, “Fuck, Harry.”
“Which part?” Draco asks looking back at his magazine.
“When did you start giving directions to me?” Draco smirks, before turning around so Harry could see the front of his undergarments.
“I like it,” Harry says, “your light hair and your silver eyes complement each other so well,” he says, “sometimes I think I’m looking at a photo of a model when I’m looking at you.”
Camilla had red hair that fell almost to her waist, her hair is straight, and it falls over her shoulders, she’s wearing a blue dress that sparkled in the light, it fell all the way to the floor, but it had a slit up the side of the dress all the way to her mid-thigh. She also had on a pair of white high heels, and she had Draco questioning his sexuality.
Harry shakes his head, “Trust me, I would never.”
“Releasing all that control,” Harry says.
Draco frowns, he was going to have to make a trip to the blood bank today, “It’s fine, just warm it then,” he shrugs.
“Are you alright?” Draco asks softly.
“I’m sure Ernie would like to have the rest of your evening,” Draco says.
Harry looks back at Draco, “I’ll admit we let it go on a little longer than we should have.”
“Won’t girls think we’re together if we’re dancing together,” Blaise says, watching Draco start to dance around him.
The following evening Draco was released from St. Mungo’s and went home with his mother.
“Okay,” Harry says, eating another piece of fruit.
“So,” Harry’s voice is soft and gentle, and Draco can’t help himself, the desire drips from his eyes, as he drinks in the younger brunette, “Are you going to join me?”
“I don’t want to talk to you,” Draco says plainly, picking out some plain robes to wear.
“Harry, what the fuck are you even saying?” Ginny says, “I know you’re sort of friends with Malfoy now, but this is just insane even for you.”
“Hi there,” she smiles, “I’m Camilla Rose.”
Harry nods, “Yes, please,” he says, and his voice quivers slightly.
“It’s hard to explain,” he mumbles, leaning back against the brick wall.
Draco lets his finger slip between Harry’s cheeks teasing at his entrance, and Harry’s whining increases, and fuck if Draco didn’t think it was the neediest thing, he’d ever heard before and he just wanted to hear it on repeat for the rest of his goddamn life.
“And you were keeping them all busy while I talked to Astoria alone,” Draco says.
Draco cracks a smile, “It’ll just be a minute, just a bit under my eyes, and on my cheeks, just because I’m a vampire, doesn’t mean I need to look dead on the outside.”
Draco shrugs, “force of habit I suppose,” he says, “you spend five years being quiet with it, and it just sort of starts to stick.”
“Vampires drink blood,” Draco says, “I haven’t been.”
“Middle button only,” Blaise says, before going to sort through Draco’s jackets.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I-I wasn’t expecting anyone,” Draco says from behind his hand.
“I also remembered why I broke up with Astoria,” he says, “and I think it’s why I left with Oliver that night.”
Blaise nods, “Astoria came back, she tried to hide the fact that she was upset, and she talked to Daphne and they both left together after about an hour.”
It’s not that it doesn’t hurt but fuck if it isn’t a pain he would gladly take every day of his fucking life. The stretch, the ache he feels within his body, the arousal buzzing beneath his skin.
Harry smiles, “Alright,” he says deciding to stop teasing Draco.
Draco smiles taking a drink of his mead as he dances with Blaise, turning around, switching their positions after a minute of dancing.
Draco can’t say he blamed Harry for that, he didn’t know much of anything about his life in Surrey, or his life at all if he really thought about it. He did know that when Harry left Surrey he didn’t seem to have a desire to go back.
“Come,” Harry says, taking hold of Draco’s hand, leading him to the side of the room, where there were tables, the room was very well lit, so it wasn’t as though they had the semblance of privacy from a dark corner. Harry pulls out a chair for Draco, and Draco sits down in the chair and crosses his leg over his knee, and watches as Harry pulls up a chair in front of him.
Draco looks back at Harry, before leaning over biting into Harry’s exposed neck without any additional warning, causing Harry to wince in pain, as he feels Draco’s fangs settle into his muscles.
“I remember leaving the pub,” he says, “I left with Oliver Rivers.”
“I’ve always cared,” Draco says quickly.
Draco sits down beside her on the sofa, “May I touch you?” he asks.
“Shut up, Ron,” Harry says looking over at his friend.
“Porridge with B negative,” Draco says, before eating another spoonful.
“Please sit,” she says quickly, running to get a bowl.
Harry looks at Draco, now he didn’t want to leave, now he wanted to keep talking to Draco, “Have you come down from that ledge?”
“Harry is not a feeder,” Ginny snarls.
“Harry wouldn’t like that,” Draco says looking back at her.
Draco smiles, “What can I say, my boyfriend, spoils me.”
“You’re living in London now?” Draco asks raising an eyebrow.
“You think I have a horrible personality?” Draco says.
Draco watches Harry, his mouth going dry as he tries not to roll his hips in desperation. Draco doesn’t speak, he’s not sure he could say anything.
“Well that’s not my problem,” Draco says, “I can’t survive without blood, and if you have a problem with it, then we’ll just go our separate ways right now.”
This makes Draco laugh, really laugh, “That’s absolutely disgusting,” he says laughing.
Draco shrugs, “they’ll keep waiting.”
“But,” Harry starts, “You’ve never cared about other people in my life, it’s always been you first, then me, then you again,” he says, “but now you care about people I care about.”
“As ready as I’ll ever be.”
“I’m aware,” Draco says, “I don’t live under a rock.”
“Oh,” Draco says looking up, “Yeah, I’m fine,” he says, “are you guys having fun?” Draco asks.
“You can’t make your own bed?” Harry asks, watching Draco walk into the bedroom, picking up a catalog from the table, and sit down in a chair.
Draco starts remembering details from his accident and starts to get the hang of this whole vampire thing.
“Exactly,” Draco says.
Draco watches her for another moment, “I am not a vampire,” he insists, but he also noticed the way that horrible metallic taste in his mouth seems to lessen as he watches the blood drain, and rather quickly from the blood bag.
When the green flames of the fireplace transport Blaise back to his house, Harry takes Blaise’s spot on the sofa, “I’m sorry that this came out like this,” he says.
“Oh, and a pastie, please,” he calls back.
Toby smiles, tipping the bottom of Draco’s glass up slowly, and gently, and Draco drinks down his mead, as Toby continues to tip the glass up until it was empty, and Draco had swallowed everything.
you are.”
Neil had talked to Draco on his first visit to the blood bank, he was born a vampire, so he had twenty years of experience with blood banks, and how they worked. Neil came in every day, and he chooses to use feeders, rather than use blood bags. Neil swears the taste is so much better when it’s fresh, and he’s been trying to get Draco to try it for the last month. Draco always politely declines, blood bags just seemed so much easier to handle to Draco.
Draco comes out of the bathroom five minutes later, after making himself throw up, twice. Feeling a little bit better, Draco leans against the sink, as he brushes his teeth, before he makes his way back to the bedroom, stumbling once before he makes it back to his bed.
Draco stares back at his absolutely perfect smile in the mirror, after a minute of admiring himself he had to remind himself that he did have a task to complete. Draco stares into the mirror, sensing the muscles in his mouth starting to tingle slightly. Draco starts to think of it as magic. It was still magic after all. When he wanted to perform a spell, he thought of the spell and channeled his magic, and when Draco thought about it like that why should this be any different?
Draco loses his entire sense of what little control he had when he came in here, and his fingers leave Harry, and he’s pulling Harry’s hips down, pushing his legs further apart on either side of his thighs as he lines himself up.
This was true, but Draco didn’t mind as much as he thought he would. As Draco was about to speak, Zella returned with a plate of cakes for Draco. Draco grabbed a slice of cake before Zella could even set the plate down.
Harry can’t help but smile, “You’re not an asshole,” Harry murmurs, “you have one of the biggest hearts I’ve ever seen, and you’ve changed so much it actually amazes me, I see so much more to you than that person you were,” Harry says.
“Thank you,” Harry says.
Harry watches Draco for a moment, “How did that happen?” he asks.
Lucius glares back at his wife, “Narcissa, our family name.”
Harry frowns, “What about you then, all you’re wearing is white.”
Blaise doesn’t move, he stares, “It’s true then,” he says quietly, “you have fangs, real fangs.”
“Seriously?” Harry says half shocked.
Draco nods, really wanting to just shove his cock back into Harry’s mouth.
“Oh, hi,” he says laughing lightly.
Harry dresses in his pajamas, before walking back to the common room. He sits down by the fireplace, using his wand to light the fire, before curling up on the sofa, pulling his knees close to his chest, as his mind begins to wander.
“Fuck Draco,” Harry swears, arching into Draco’s touch, “oh fuck.”
Harry is sitting at his desk it’s a Thursday afternoon in mid-December, and he’s staring at the front page of the Daily Prophet, and he could scream. He’s not sure how, but the Daily Prophet had somehow got a hold of the fact that he had been dating Draco Malfoy, the headline read “The Chosen One, dating fallen from grace Malfoy boy."
Draco shrugs, before getting out of bed, “Do you want it to be?” he asks, walking into the bathroom.
Draco rolls his eyes, “you don’t get it,” he says.
Harry smiles, and rolls his eyes, “Go right ahead Malfoy” he says glancing up from his textbook.
“Are you alright?” Draco asks, looking at Camilla.
“I have fangs,” Draco says looking back at his mother.
ended up calling him by his surname.
Draco looks at Harry wondering if he was really going to tell him one of his secrets, “I can’t tell you,” he retorts.
Draco says nothing, and he kisses Harry. Harry’s knees are suddenly week, as it takes every bit of energy inside of him to stay standing, he kisses Draco back after a moment. Harry can’t help it, the small whimper that passes his lips, as Draco kisses him. Harry wants to run away right then, he turns to run horrified.
Harry smiles, “You have perfect etiquette, but your manners could use some work.”
“Yeah, what’s the point if you can’t even snog him,” Draco says with a sigh falling from his lips, suddenly feeling sad for himself. Astoria was his best friend and he couldn’t even tell her that he fancied Harry Potter. She wouldn’t understand.
“No you don’t,” Draco interrupts, “because if you did we wouldn’t be having this conversation, I am a vampire, you knew I was a vampire when you agreed to go out with me, and suddenly, seeing me as who I truly am, makes you uncomfortable, therefore I think we’re done here,” Draco says, “You should go, and don’t come back.”
“Thanks,” Draco says pulling out his Alchemy textbook, opening it to chapter four.
When Draco pulls back and retracts his fangs, he makes it a point to lick the excess blood from the bite mark against Harry’s neck.
Thank you guys so much for sticking around and reading till the end!!!! I know it was VERY long you guys! but I appreciate you taking the time to read :)
Harry groans in desperation and sexual frustration, “You are such a prim.”
“No,” Harry mutters.
Draco rolls his eyes, “I’ve not been cranky,” he insists.
“Draco,” Harry says softly.
“This is so fucked,” Draco swears, trying his best to keep calm.
the tingling, he wanted them to disappear. He knew he could do it on himself, he just needed to focus. It takes Draco several minutes before he finally feels the pull of the new muscles in his mouth pull at his fangs, then they’re gone. Draco stares in amazement at his reflection in the mirror, his fangs were gone, and he did it himself.
Harry steps out of Draco’s fireplace, and he can’t wait to see Draco. It had been six months since they officially started dating, and Harry had been on assignment most of the week, so he was ready to spend some time with Draco this weekend.
“What are you doing?” Ron asks.
Draco blushes, wondering how Neil knew that, and he moves to wipe his mouth clean, “There was a lot of blood,” he murmurs.
Draco shakes his head, “I’m okay,” he says.
Harry looks confused as he watches Draco for a moment as he gets up quickly, “Draco” Harry says standing up grabbing at his hand to stop him walking away.
Harry had never thought about that before, but he already had an answer, “It’s somewhere in between,” he says, “not like all the time, but I do like subtle hints outside of a sexual context,” he admits.
Draco nods, “I’m fine, I’m drunk, it’s not a big deal,” he says, laying down on the bed.
“Is it bad?” she asks quietly, looking back at her son reaching for his hand.
“Get on the bed,” Harry says breathlessly, his eyes traveling all over Draco’s body.
Harry shrugs, “I want it to be more than just what it is now, but there is still so much we have to work through before we can get to that point, and I just don’t want to spoil anything,” he says.
“Why would someone defang a vampire?” Harry asks.
“You are so beautiful,” Draco says looking back at her.
“Thank you, Zella,” he says when she sets the warm mug in front of Draco, followed by a tray of sandwiches.
“It’s in the back, I’ll go get it,” he says, getting up from his seat.
“I don’t want a hug,” Draco says.
“I like you-“
“It’s great,” Neil grins, “I don’t remember the last time I had so much fun at a party that wasn’t my own.”
“We’re meeting Luna,” Ginny answers, setting her tea down, “and she’s right, I only came by because I think I left one of my nice sweaters in the closet,” she says.
“You do and you’re not going to be able to keep it a secret for much longer if you don’t get a handle on it,” Ron says at the same time as Draco, who makes his presence known, stepping into the hallway beside Harry.
“Um, Friday,” Draco answers, that was the last he remembered, he remembered it being Friday, and he had plans to meet friends for dinner.
“He’s a bully, he always has been and always will be,” Ginny says, to Harry.
“You’ll be waiting a bloody long time then,” Harry says.
Harry narrows his eyes at Draco, “You’re literally the worst,” he says.
Draco nods, “He’s Bisexual.”
Draco takes a breath, calming himself momentarily, before looking back at Harry clearing his throat, “I want you to keep doing what you’re doing,” he says softly.
“Izzie and Myles are in the bedroom down the hall,” he responds, “And there’s also blood champagne chilled, in the kitchen, help yourself.”
Draco sighs, “well I’m glad you stopped by,” he says shutting his book on the table.
“Yeah, I’ve spent a lot of time with her, being a Prefect and all,” he says.
Draco nods, “That’s what she told me.”
Harry looks over at Draco, “I said you were fit, I never said I was attracted to your horrible personality traits.”
Draco looks back at Harry wondering about the question.
“Oh,” he says, “Not really, we’ve hooked up a couple of times, but that’s about it,” Harry says.
“You broke up with her on Friday?” Harry asks.
“Seriously?” Draco frowns, “I could have dressed myself in jeans and a tee,” he says.
“Apparently new vampires, tend to be sloppy drinkers, so they go through a lot more than older vampires.”
Harry shakes his head, “No, I just didn’t expect to see it like that.”
“You like it Master Malfoy?” she asks hopefully.
"Oh, I recall now, it was at a bookshop some years ago. Yes, that's right," he said smugly, eyes narrowing as if challenging Draco to remember.
Draco sighed, reminding himself not to sound too defeated so early in the game. "No, Mother is right. This kind of ward is powerful because it relies on familial connections. There is no kind of protective magic as potent."
"Leaving soon?" he asked, knowing that she had to be back on the training grounds by sunrise. "Geez, what do they even make you guys do that's so top secret and all-consuming? Maybe I should start recruiting from your team," he said, knowing full well that training for the National team was just as hard, or possibly even worse than Auror training. At least the Corps didn't run their recruits into the ground every single weekday for years. The difference, of course, was that Quidditch players put all of their years of hard work into one big tournament, which to Harry seemed to justify all the effort of training years before the League or even the World Cup. Ginny had the perfect drive for it, he thought silently.
"Of course," Draco said, shaking his head and settling on the bed next to her. "Are you feeling tired?"
“It’s nothing,” Harry says softly, letting his cheek brush against Draco’s silky-smooth blonde hair.
Draco quickly turns around, “I’ve remembered something,” he says quickly, “from that night.”
After a few dances, Draco takes Tracey back to the bar, to refill their drinks.
“Fuck Harry” Draco moans, as his cock twitches inside him, hot come coating his insides, and Harry shudders beneath Draco.
“What?” Harry asks looking up at Draco.
“Merlin no,” he insists, “I’m not even attracted to him,” he says rolling his eyes, “not that it’s any of your business.”
“Blood donner shortage in Ireland,” Draco says softly, “apparently blood banks in Ireland are trying to find ways to conserve their supply of blood for vampires,” he explains.
Draco nods, “Alright then,” he says watching Harry get up, and start walking toward the door before opening the door for Harry.
“It’s okay mate, you didn’t do anything wrong, sometimes things get messy,” he says, “especially when you’re new at it.”
“Harry,” Draco says, and Harry’s eyes meet his, “I’m sorry I raised my voice at you.”
Draco reaches out, tucking his finger into Harry’s belt loop, pulling him closer. Draco looks up at Harry, as he puts his arm around Harry’s waist, pulling him so that Harry was standing between Draco’s legs, and their chests were touching but just barely.
“I need to drink,” Draco says so quietly it’s almost a whisper, “so why don’t you come back tomorrow if you want.”
“AB negative right?” Draco asks, pulling his fangs down, he could already smell the blood, and he was fairly thirsty.
Draco had confidence Blaise would make him look good, Blaise had very good fashion sense, if he’s being honest, Blaise helped him pick out most of his wardrobe. Draco pulls on his trousers, zipping them up, and looking at himself in the mirror, and damn did these look great on him. His legs were going to be the star of the show, which Draco loved, “my legs look great in these,” he says.
“Blimey, I didn’t actually think he had a chance with her, and now he’s going home with her,” Ron says watching Harry walk, hand in hand with his date out of the room.
“Maybe five years,” Draco says, wondering why that was relevant.
Narcissa frowns, “are you well?”
Draco stops, deciding to let Harry have this moment. Rarely did Draco indulge in the after-sex cuddling, he didn’t see the point, he got what he wanted and Harry got what he wanted, why they needed to continue spending time inside each other afterward just didn’t make sense to Draco.
Harry moans louder than he meant to, as Draco’s cock slides against his wanting tongue.
Draco nods, “thanks.”
“It’s nice right?” Harry says, letting his head rest against Draco’s shoulder, pressing a gentle kiss to the nape of his neck.
Harry looks over at Draco, “Here, have a drink,” he says, starting to unbutton his shirt.
Harry frowns thinking to himself, he didn’t actually know any vampires, he had no idea what to say, “I, um, I’m not sure,” Harry mutters before getting up, “I’ll get the healer.”
“What else have you shaved?” Harry asks quietly, looking back at Draco.
“Potter?” he says, standing with the door half open.
“Want to try me?” he asks.
Harry looks at Draco, “Are we even friends?” Harry asks, “Don’t we have to start there before we can move into boyfriend?”
“We’re vampires,” Draco says.
Harry is quick to notice the way Draco smiles, and for some reason it makes him feel good.
“No, they’re not,” Harry says, “And he’s different now.”
“You may,” Izzie consents, and Draco places his hands around her waist, as he moves closer to her, moving her legs over his.
“Fair,” Draco says.
Draco smiles in between kisses, he slips his feet out of his shoes, immediately losing four inches of height, leaving his shoes in the middle of the floor, smiling as he pushes Harry back, just slightly, he can’t help but notice the tie his lover had decided to put on, it was the exact same color as the silver lace on the dress Draco was currently wearing.
“That was mine,” Draco pouts.
“Well no,” Harry says, “it would be a vast list, and not even counting the half-vampires.”
Draco laughs, “sure why not.”
“Luna is a fucking saint,” Ginny states, “I love her for it.”
“I’m not,” Draco says narrowing his eyes at Harry, “Don’t you ever try and pull some shit like that with me.”
“Unless it’s human-borne, there’s no risk so long as the bite has healed,” Draco says, “feeders at blood banks, and through ordering services, are tested twice a month for these diseases and pathogens.”
Ginny sighs, pulling on her sweater, “alright then,” she says finally agreeing to drop it, “I won’t pester you then,” she says looking back at Harry, “Luna and I are getting engaged,” she says softly.
Blaise looks back at Harry, giving him a short smile in acknowledgment, as Harry steps out of the fireplace.
“Malfoy,” Harry says, with a definite smile.
“Yeah, maybe,” Draco says looking back at Harry.
“Are you going to make me say it, Potter?” Draco says.
Harry sighs and rolls his eyes, “Nothing is going on Ron, I’m fine.”
Draco sighs, it was his birthday, and he did want a drink, he’d rather drink from Izzie, if he couldn’t drink from Harry, but he was extremely attracted to Cami, and it couldn’t hurt to just have a little taste.
Harry can completely believe that’s how Draco would pick a guy to date. If a guy had the bollocks to stand up to Draco Malfoy, then Draco would at least give him the time of day. Draco enjoyed that guys seemed to be afraid to talk to him, and he had respect for those who had enough courage to challenge him.
Draco sighs heavily, “Why did we break up?”
“Early,” Harry murmurs softly, letting his hand trail over Draco’s cool soft skin.
Draco frowns, he didn’t but he made an assumption, “St. Mungo’s.”
“Of course, sir,” she says stopping what she was doing to collect the shirt from Draco.
“I just got up,” Harry says, eating more of his porridge.
Harry glares back at Ginny, “If you say one more nasty thing about Draco, I swear I will never speak to you again,” Harry says looking at Ginny, and this takes her by surprise, “Of course Draco is an asshole, it’s just part of who he is, but he is not a bully, and he’s changed so much from when we were going to school together, he’s like an actual person now,” Harry says.
“Fuck” Draco breathes, as his hands find their way into Harry’s dark hair, and he stills his hips, as Harry starts to suck taking Draco further into his mouth until he couldn’t anymore.
“What’s wrong?” she asks quickly, moving her hand up to her bleeding neck.
Narcissa watches Draco for a moment, before she gently lays her head against Draco’s shoulder, staying quiet for the rest of the night.
Harry smiles, “Or I could make you come closer,” he says.
Draco does as she asks sitting at the table, smiling when she sets a bowl in front of him, “What’s this?” he asks his eyes going wide in excitement.
Ginny smiles, “because you asked that question,” she answers, “so your year then.”
Harry glares back at Draco, “You are an asshole,” he says plainly, “You have always been an asshole, and you clearly don’t want my help,” Harry says turning to leave.
the thirst in him, and his need for blood increasing every moment.
“You’re making an invisibility potion?” Harry asks mildly impressed.
“Hmm,” she mumbles, crossing her legs under the table, “well that explains why you’re here on a Saturday alone,” she says.
“I’m not gonna tell you, so you can go on and do whatever else you two have planned for the day.”
Draco’s jaw slacks slightly, his eyes flutter, as Harry’s hot wet mouth works his cock over, and he moans tugging the slightest bit on Harry’s hair as his breath quickens.
“Draco no,” Narcissa says, no longer trying to hide the tears that were now flowing down her cheeks.
“Was important enough to bring it up,” he murmurs, deciding to let it go if Harry wasn’t going to say anything to him about it this time.
Draco rolls his eyes, and Harry can’t help but smile, “Vampire plans,” he says.
“Of course,” Harry says.
“Your affliction,” she says.
Harry sighs heavily, crossing his arms over his chest, “You’re going to have to start making nice because Draco isn’t going anywhere Ginny, not if I can help it.”
“Oh, I don’t know your dramatic exit, perhaps,” Harry says looking back at Draco.
Draco shrugs, “I don’t know, I don’t personally know anyone with any right now, I imagine it's not pleasant,” he says.
Draco frowns again, “How long have I been here?” he asks.
“But one is easier to deal with than the other,” Draco says, “Go on, finish talking about me with Weasley,” Draco says before walking past the two of them.
“I don’t think so,” she says, “his room has been quiet this morning,” she says.
Harry looks down at his lap before looking back up at Draco, “you promise you won’t need to be talked down again?” he asks.
Harry smiles, “It’s not so bad, besides I’m sure there are plenty of penthouses in London for you to choose from.”
“We talked to Astoria yesterday, she confirmed you two had a talk, and that you left on your own, but told no one where you were going,” Harry says.
Draco isn’t quite sure what Neil means, but he does begin to feel as though he should stop soon. Draco eases his tongue off of Camilla’s vein, letting her blood flow into his mouth for another moment, before he swallows, and releases her from his mouth.
“What’s yours?” Draco asks, pulling his knees up against his chest.
“Where are you going?” Draco asks, following after him.
Harry leans over closing the space between them, pressing his lips firmly against Draco’s. Draco gasps, he hadn’t expected this. Draco had wanted this, Harry’s soft warm lips against his kissing him, in his fantasy there was quite a bit of tongue, and Draco had complete control, but somehow this is better. It’s better because it’s real.
“This is embarrassing enough without you staring at me like that,” Draco says glaring at Harry.
Harry’s moans and soft sighs of pure pleasure are Draco’s favorite thing about fucking Harry. Knowing that he could make Harry make these obscene sounds, and make Harry desperate for him, was enough to get Draco off, and he had in fact gotten off on it more than once.
Harry laughs at that, it was true Draco wasn’t human anymore, but to hear him say it like that made him laugh, “I guess there’s no denying the fact that I am human.”
Draco frowns, “feed?” he asks.
Harry blushes a furious shade of red, looking back at Draco, and he shrugs as he clears his throat.
It’s before sunset when Harry arrives at Draco’s fireplace, “Draco,” he calls out, wondering if he was even awake yet.
“I sometimes wonder what you’re thinking.”
to break the charm, and it broke when I came in,” she says simply.
Harry walks into the prefect’s bathroom, he’d had three exams today, and the entire time he could only think of one thing. One thing that he was going to end up taking care of by himself, but he couldn’t think of a better way to end such a stressful day.
“Yeah, sorry,” he says, glancing down at his hand, “sunlight,” he mutters.
Cami smiles, “What’s wrong?” she asks empathetically.
Harry grins, “in that case, we’ll revisit this later,” he smiles, before sitting up on the bed, letting Draco free of his arms.
“Hmm,” Draco murmurs, keeping his eyes closed.
Harry looks back at Draco, “It sounds like you’re trying to say that you want to be with me,” he says.
Draco sighs, “No,” he admits, “do you know what I needed to do?”
“If you must know,” Draco says rolling his eyes, “I need the toilet.”
“Well it’s not really about what you think,” Harry snaps, “Draco makes he happy, when we started talking, I was at a place where I was contemplating quitting my job, and just giving up altogether,” he says looking back at Ginny, “I was one more bad day away from letting everything go, but that was also the first day I talked to Draco, actually talked, like civilized humans, like friends, and without that moment, I don’t know where the hell I would be right now Ginny.”
Anthony walks over a moment later, pressing a gentle kiss to Draco’s cheek, as slips his arm around his waist, “Hey.”
Draco shrugs, “maybe.”
Zella hands him a spoon, “I made it with AB negative, it’s sorbet,” she says happily.
“Nothing,” Draco says, “I just want a party, here.”
Harry chuckles before starting to kiss Draco’s neck gently.
“Fine, aside from the obvious,” he says.
Draco sighs dramatically, standing in his closet staring at his clothes, “I’m getting dressed,” Draco says, annoyance clear in his voice.
Harry pulls himself off Draco, and drops down onto the bed beside Draco, a thin layer of sweat visible on his skin, “That was brilliant,” he says, still catching his breath.
“Depends on the vampire I suppose,” Draco says turning the page.
“Vampires that live in these underground covens are very dangerous, they surface only to feed, kill, and create more vampires.”
Draco wipes at his mouth, “It’s not instinctual, apparently there’s a certain skill level to it,” he says, “I suppose I’ll get there eventually.”
Draco can feel Harry’s warm skin pressing against his back, he’d taken off his shirt. Draco was also very aware of the fact that he could feel Harry’s erection pressing against his back, removed his trousers too, it appeared.
“Draco,” Anthony says reaching for his hand.
Harry smiles, “you’re very cute when you’re intoxicated and sleepy.”
Luna nods, “Ginny loves to dance,” she smiles, looking over at Ginny who was dancing by herself and attracting a lot of attention.
When Harry first let Draco drink from him, he was a bit weirded out by it. The fact that he was bleeding into his boyfriend’s mouth, and Draco was enjoying it, well Draco actually needed it, was just weird. They had done this a few times now, Harry still thought it was weird, but it was something he sort of got used to doing. It wasn’t his favorite thing by far, but he didn’t hate doing it. He didn’t think he could hate doing anything for Draco.
“You mad at me?” Harry asks quietly.
“Like what?” Harry asks.
“It’s none of your business if we’re just fucking or not,” Harry says.
By the end of the week, Draco has found himself a new place to call home. It wasn’t easy finding a magical place to live, right in the middle of a muggle city, but he had found what he liked to refer to as his basement penthouse. The building was fourteen stories high, and seven stories down, it housed those witches and wizards who happened to have a lot of money and would settle for nothing less than exquisite. The building was concealed to muggles, who only saw what appeared to be an abandoned office building.
Harry gasps when Draco’s fangs pierce his skin, he relaxes a moment later, as Draco’s fangs settle into place, and Harry begins to feel the blood in his body leave him and flow into Draco’s mouth.
“A date?” Harry says honestly shocked, “with who?”
“No, I think you’ve shot down all my conversation topics,” Harry says.
When Draco’s eyes fly open he’s lying in bed, and his sheets are anything but dry. A mixture of sweat and semen making everything around him sticky, and Draco can’t say he’s not embarrassed. He hasn’t woken up covered in his own semen in about four years. The fact that his wet dream had been about Harry Fucking Potter, only made it that much more embarrassing. Draco slips his hand under his pillow, pulling his wand out, “Tergeo,” he mutters, siphoning away the evidence of his sex dream.
Draco raises an eyebrow in indifference, “Vampires are not pleasant creatures.”
Of course, just what Draco wanted, he didn’t want to admit that Harry
“Is the immunity passed when they create a vampire?” He asks.
That does make Draco laugh because of course, that’s how he ended up naked, “Of course I did.”
Draco stills his hand, looking back at Harry, “I’ve only just started,” he says softly.
Harry can’t help himself, he seems mesmerized by blood that stain’s Draco’s lips red and drips slowly down the side of his chin. Draco’s middle finger wipes at the blood that seemed to escape his mouth. Harry lets his eyes wander back to Draco’s lips, it’s only at that moment when he sees Draco’s lips begin to move, that he realizes Draco’s talking again.
Ginny smiles wickedly, “was he in my year or yours?” she asks.
“What?” Draco asks.
“Enjoy your day off,” Draco says with a slight smirk, which causes Harry’s cheeks to flush.
Harry leads Draco further into the lake until they’re both no longer standing but floating in the water.
“Well when you’ve had five firewhiskeys nothing is really that gross,” Harry says blushing lightly.
Draco shrugs, “What are you doing?” he asks.
“It was Pansy,” Blaise says casually, “She’s always been jealous of Draco, and she can’t stand when anyone else is happy and she’s not. Though I doubt that bitch has never been happy in her entire life.”
“I want to be good for you,” Harry murmurs, nuzzling his nose against the cool skin at the base of Draco’s neck, “I want to make you feel good.”
Blaise groans loudly, “are you joking?”
Draco shrugs, “Seeing how it feels,” he confirms.
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry moans, grasping onto Draco’s shoulder, taking more of Draco’s cock inside himself.
Harry thinks about this for a moment, “Well, who said that?”
“Don’t you think you should know your limits?” Harry asks.
Draco frowns, “I haven’t spoken to Theodore since Hogwarts,” he says.
“So, you do have a problem with it,” he says.
Draco smiles, “we’re so handsome we’re attracting a lot of attention.”
“It’s not like that,” Harry says.
Dear Salazar, Harry was about to have a heart attack. The thong was completely lace, and see-through, and no, it didn’t quite fit Draco, not at all. Draco hated the way trousers made him feel
“What is it Malfoy?” Harry whispers softly, looking back up at him.
“Draco,” Harry says softly, looking at his boyfriend with gentle eyes.
Draco ponders this for a moment, “They definitely don’t help,” he decides.
“Have you,” Harry pauses a moment, “you know, tried feeding,” he says quietly.
“I told you not to follow me home,” Draco says, walking back into the living room.
Draco smiles, climbing off the bed, from the slight pant he can hear from behind him, he knows Harry approves very much.
Draco pauses for a moment before he nods, “Yes,” he agrees, “I am happy in this relationship, with you as my boyfriend and I want to move forward with you, and I think that includes being nice to your friends, and having their approval, yes.”
“And what are you talking about exactly?” Harry asks confused.
“Nothing,” Harry says after a moment, deciding to let this moment be.
“Hmm?” Draco responds getting up from the bed.
Harry gently tugs Draco’s hand back towards him.
“It’s alright,” Jamie says, “it happens.”
Draco watches the way Harry stirs his tea, while he takes a sip from his own mug, this time he wasn’t so lucky to keep it from spilling over his lips. Draco quickly wipes the corner of his mouth, looking back at Harry.
Chapter 3 will be up next week. Thank you so much!!!! <3
“Sorry,” Draco says again.
Meghan nods, “Great party, Neil has been dancing with me all night,” she laughs.
Harry smiles, pressing his lips against Draco’s shoulder blade, kissing softly, “We’d have to first get married,” he says, “lift up,” he murmurs softly.
“Tell me how I can make it better for you?” Harry asks, looking up meeting Draco’s eyes.
Harry smiles, “Sometimes?”
Draco had started calling Harry by his first name more often, and Harry knew that when Draco was annoyed at him, not even when he was angry with him, even when Draco was angry, he would call him Harry, but when he was annoyed, even just the tiniest bit Draco
Of course, Draco thinks to himself trying his best not to roll his eyes, “Then take me home.”
“I brought you home with me,” Harry says, “after the club.”
“Ernie?” Harry asks.
Draco is so close, he wants him inside him right fucking now, “Please Draco.”
“But you needed a hug,” Harry says.
“You’re getting a feeder?” he asks.
Draco wakes up the next morning, he’s hungover and wants to vomit. He sits up on his bed, and that’s when he realizes he’s not in his bed. These definitely aren’t his 600 threat count Egyptian cotton bedsheets, and he’s not wearing a single piece of clothing. What the fuck had he done last night, and where the hell was he?
Harry’s eyes drift upwards as he notices the portrait hole opening, he smiles seeing Ron and Ginny walking through the entrance.
Harry looks back at Draco, “What did you remember?” he asks.
Draco smiles, taking a sip of his coffee before setting it down, “We’re getting there,” he says again.
“You are so disgusting,” Draco hears Ron tell Harry.
This time Draco’s cheeks are stained with a pink tint, as he clears his throat, “That can be arranged,” he mutters.
Neil smiles, helping Camilla up off Draco’s lap, letting her sit back on the sofa, “It’s good right?” he asks looking at Draco.
Draco watches Harry for a moment, “Well, I was doing a bit of shopping, and he was trying to give me fashion advice, and I said I didn’t need advice on how to dress myself from someone who dressed like a toadstool, and then he said that my legs in those trousers, reminded him of a bowtruckle, and then he asked me if I wanted to go for a drink.”
This was something Draco had not foreseen happening during their exchange. Draco lets Harry savor his post-orgasm state of mind, and he thinks that it might be alright if he let his hand gently brush the hair back and tuck it behind Harry’s ear.
“You are so beautiful,” Harry murmurs softly, resting his hand against his chest.
“Harry,” Draco whispers, as he feels the heat pooling in his abdomen, and his stomach muscles contract, signaling his orgasm was close.
Harry clears his throat, and his suddenly very aware of how tight his cock felt in these pants, “take them off,” he says softly, before quickly pulling his pants off, tossing them onto the floor.
of me,” he clarifies, “there’s still a lot you don’t know about me.”
“Hi, Harry!” Ginny smiles, waving at him.
“Bring me some blood cake,” he says.
Harry stares back at Draco, unsure of why Draco would suddenly be this nice to him, “yeah, alright” he says, “might take you up on that.”
“Because you’re standing next to me now,” Toby says, moving to close to gap between them, and Draco laughs because that was so lame.
“Isabella is it?” Draco says.
“This is a nice place you have here,” Harry says awkwardly.
“No,” Draco mumbles.
“Hi there,” she smiles, looking Draco over.
“I’m fine,” Draco grumbles, pushing Harry back when he tries to help him, “I don’t need help,” he slurs.
“Don’t be angry,” Harry calls after him.
“Out with it,” Draco says.
Draco pulls Harry closer to him, lifting his hips as he lines himself up underneath Harry, “Are you alright?” he asks quietly.
“What are you reading?” Harry asks curiously, wondering what kind of articles vampires read about.
“And how drunk are you?” Harry asks.
Draco frowns, “Well I can’t remember what happened that night, have you talked to Blaise?”
Ron looks back at Harry, “You’ve been such a space case lately” he says.
Draco does want to get up but he thinks that he could tolerate a bit more of this, for Harry.
“Boyfriend?” Harry says curiously.
“That’s horrific,” Harry says, closing the magazine.
Harry eyes the blood bag in Draco’s hand, watching Draco pass it from his left hand to his right.
Draco might mean that.
Draco looks over at Harry, “The new vampire, will be immune to whatever vampiric disease they were a carrier of.”
Draco is skeptical, he’s almost inclined to believe Ron, he was Harry’s best friend after all, and Ron clearly had some issues with Harry since they began dating. It didn’t help that Draco knew Ron didn’t like him, like at all.
“Not going to happen,” Harry says looking back at Draco.
“Yeah, alright right after I send an owl to St. Mungo’s because you are definitely mad,” he says, Harry was asking him to share
Draco shakes his head, he’d always spent at least ten minutes getting Harry ready, and he always got him to take three fingers. Harry was usually a writhing mess by the time Draco got anywhere near putting his cock in him, and it was
“I didn’t ask for a bath,” Draco says.
Ginny watches Harry as he talks, but she still wasn’t convinced that this was any good for Harry.
Draco nods, “She makes me all sorts of bloody meals,” he says unable to hide the grin on his face.
Ginny smiles, slipping on her sweater, she looked beautiful wearing a red and white sleeveless dress that stopped at her mid-thigh, and the red sweater was perfect for the dress.
“If you could take off your shirt, and sit there,” Draco says pointing at the sofa.
“I said you were attractive.”
Harry looks over at Draco, being very careful not to let his smile show, “That doesn’t sound like you’re asking for a hug.”
“I think I’m gonna go have that coffee now,” Harry says.
“No, you don’t,” she insists, “You can’t.”
“So,” Harry says after a moment.
Ginny stares back at Harry with her mouth hanging open, “Harry,” she says, “You can’t be serious.”
Draco nods, “at some point.”
“Is this okay?” Harry asks looking up at Draco, whose cheeks were completely flushed.
Draco laughs at that, “You can come if you want,” Draco says, “but you didn’t seem too keen on it, the last time I had a feeder over so,” Draco says watching Harry.
“Please,” he says looking back at Draco.
“What?” Harry asks confused.
“The legs on that one, eh?” Ron Weasley says, stepping up beside Harry, it was very obvious they were looking at the same person. Whether or not that was because Ron saw Harry looking, or Ron was legitimately interested, he was not sure, but jealousy did rise inside Harry.
“Yeah,” Draco agrees, “I’m tired of dating, it’s exhausting.”
Draco nods, “Vampirism is seen as a disgrace apparently, and my family has been through so much already, they couldn’t have me their only son, being a vampire so openly. So, father has agreed to pay my way, so long as I never go back home.”
Harry sighs, she would never understand, he can’t tell her.
“Where would you like me?” Jamie asks.
“What happened last night?” Draco asks.
“It’s been three days, Mister Malfoy.”
“So am I,” Draco says, “I’m not biting you, Potter.”
Draco lets out a long yawn, “You’re home,” he says, “what time is it?” Draco hadn’t expected Harry home.
Draco rolls his eyes, “I can’t drink with your shirt on like that,” he says finally.
Draco nods, pulling his fangs down with a click, “So, is there a technique to it?”
Harry looks at Draco, “I’m not lying,” he says, watching Draco trying to figure out how Draco knew he was lying.
While getting ready to come to this event, his lover said something Harry had never expected, and as much as Harry had thought about it before, he never actually thought the idea would come to life, and never in such a public setting. Harry was thoroughly enjoying their little game, but it was making it extremely hard for him to focus on talking to any Ministry officials.
“The red-head.”
“What?” Draco snaps, and Harry can see intensity flare in Draco’s eyes.
“There is plenty to talk about,” Harry murmurs.
Draco doesn’t speak to Harry, but Harry can
“Help with what?” Draco asks, watching the blood bag start to drain.
Harry doesn’t mean to, but he does stare as Draco opens his textbook, looking deep into the pages. Harry watches a lock of blonde hair fall over Draco’s forehead, he wants to reach over and brush it back, putting it back in place but he doesn’t.
“And how does it feel?” Harry asks.
Harry grins, leaning over kissing Draco hard on the mouth.
“Literally you could date anyone in the entire world that you wanted, but for some reason you’re attracted to me,” Draco says, “I’m an asshole, I’ve been a bully to you for years, and I constantly tell you how much I hate you, but for some reason you find me attractive.”
Draco blushes, “what are you talking about?”
“What happened to me?” He asks, starting to inspect his body, his pale skin was bruised, almost everywhere, which explained the soreness he was feeling.
“I think that I’m going to have to test everything at some point,” Draco says, “but I have a lot going on right now, and don’t think adding to that by being, ‘bloodthirsty’, for lack of a better word, is going to help solve any problems.”
“That’s the one,” she says, “It’s in the closet then?” she asks.
“Where are you going?” Harry asks curiously.
“Draco,” Harry says surprised.
Draco looks back at Harry, there were only a few things he didn’t like, the rest was sort of fair game, “I’ll most likely tell you,” Draco says.
“Are you alright?” Harry asks.
“How fitting,” Draco says, starting to wonder how he got roped into coming to this party.
“What’s going on?” he asks, looking down at himself, he was in Hospital, why was he in hospital?
Harry rolls his eyes, and takes off the rest of his clothes, leaving on his pants and undershirt, as he gets under the blankets with Draco.
This time Draco was the one who couldn’t look away, Harry’s soft green eyes etched in his mind, and they were so close, and what the fuck was Draco thinking? This was Harry Potter he was thinking about, just because he was now openly gay doesn’t mean he needed to go and crush on the first possible queer person he runs into, hell he didn’t even know if Harry was gay or bi.
Draco looks at Harry with a small smile, before leaning down pressing his lips against Harry’s, kissing him gently. Harry kisses Draco back before he smiles breaking the kiss a moment later.
“He had his hands down your trousers, and it was so disgusting, because you obviously weren’t in a state to consent to any of it,” Harry says slightly angry.
“What do you remember?” Harry asks.
“Who else did you meet?” Harry asks curiously.
“Hurry up,” Blaise says impatiently, “We’re almost an hour later than we said we would be.”
Harry smiles, looking back at Draco, who was looking very pale again, “Are you alright?” he asks, “you look like you’re going to be sick again."
Looking down at himself, Draco was sure that he had murdered a small animal. Draco reaches for his wand, using a cleaning spell to clean himself up, before trying to sort out what the hell he was going to do. He was so impulsive, but he was eighteen he couldn’t be to blame for that. He would figure it out, he had to, as his father said he was on his own now.
“You asked why Ginny moved out, that’s why,” he says, “she pretended to be my girlfriend so there was less pressure as I figured out who I actually was, and without her I wouldn’t have had that chance,” Harry explains, “She moved out when I plucked up enough courage to go on my first date with a bloke.”
Harry smiles, “You’re very sweet,” he says softly.
“Alright then,” Harry says thinking he might just let Draco sleep, “I’m going to go see about him,” he says, before wandering off to Draco’s bedroom.
“Draco, stop it,” Harry says becoming frustrated for the first time.
“Let me buy you a drink?” Toby asks.
Draco mewls softly, as Harry’s warm hands caress his exposed skin. Draco turns over facing Harry, slipping his thin legs between Harry’s, tangling their limbs together.
“Goodnight Harry,” Draco says softly.
This makes Harry smile much more than he’s willing to admit, “Of course, you’re a bunny.”
“Was I good for you?” Harry asks quietly after a moment.
Draco looks back at Harry, “I don’t know for sure, I still can’t remember what happened after we left the pub, and I still don’t remember the rest of the night,” Draco says, “but I think there was snogging involved.”
Draco nods, “And I barely know your friends, and you barely know mine,” he says.
Draco shakes his head, what he needed was blood, he sits down on the sofa next to Harry.
“Stop crying mother,” he says, gently removing her hand from his arm, “It’s better this way, I’ll go tomorrow evening,” he says looking at his father before turning to walk to his room.
Draco smiles, “Thank you, Minister.”
Draco looks up seeing Ginny standing over the two of them looking very disapprovingly at them.
“You know who I am,” Draco says regaining control over his emotions, “You’ve known who I was since we were eleven, yes I’ve grown since then, and so have you,” he continues, “my opinions have changed, and so have yours, I realized I was gay, I became a vampire against my will, I’ve had some terrible dates, some drunken hookups I’d rather not speak of,” Draco says looking back at Harry, “but I don’t need a babysitter, I don’t need a boyfriend, especially one who wants me to be something I’m not.”
“It wasn’t a fight,” she says, “we broke up,” she says looking at Draco for any recognition.
Draco’s need for complete control, even when he’s fucking him drives Harry absolutely insane, he wants Draco to drop all of his control and fuck him senseless, he’s so close to coming, he can feel it and he wants it so fucking badly. Draco’s fluid movements are the most pleasurable sensation he’d ever felt before, it’s so controlled, fluid, it’s fucking perfect, and exactly what Harry needs. Harry wants the chaos and the hot, fast orgasm that is so so fucking close.
