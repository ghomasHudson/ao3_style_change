The next day was as uneventful as the previous week. Tempers simmered close to the surface amongst the Aurors and he felt no different than the rest. All of them just wanted to go home. But they had their mission. Agent Weasley was particularly subdued today, which usually meant something had recently blown up in his face. This was the quiet after the storm and all of the field agents knew to let him have his space.
Immediately, Harry felt smothered, like he was drowning, and he struggled to keep afloat even as he looked down at her prone body lying motionless on the bed.
"You better do it Hermione; I think Ron might have an aneurism."  The light joking eased his anxiety at the upcoming potential lobotomy.
She was already walking towards the back of the shop, disappearing amongst the shelves.  With a twirl, he Apparated away as the first red-cloaked wizard arrived.
As her voice rose and fell with the tune, all Draco could do was open his mouth and laugh.  He laughed at the absurdity of it, of the utter gall of Harry and Severus, and he laughed with joy.
"But the wound… the bleeding…"  It still gave Harry the shivers.  Red.  The shack had been bathed in red.
"Mr. Malfoy, we cannot allow you entrance into the dragon reserve.  You will only endanger yourself and the members of the research program."
Harry brushed his fingers against Severus' brow and his upward tilted palms.  "By Earth and Water, Fire and Air, you are released.  Return to your origin.  Return to your heart," Harry repeated over and over, and the words turned into a drone as the energy engulfed them both.
Rifling through Kogelmann's pockets, Harry found a vial full of a fine powder, a wand, a couple of rings, and around the man's neck on a bit of twine was a large brass key. He tossed the vial at Ron, who snatched it from the air but still gave Harry a dirty look.
He counted it as one of his not so good days, but at least he hadn't turned into a giant tangle of a tree with long branches so heavy they brushed the ground.  Poor Neville.  Harry knew how to count his blessings.
Draco hopped his chair three times, moving right next to Harry.  "What's wrong?" he asked, placing his hand over Harry's.  Harry stared at the two hands, not really feeling Draco's touch.
Harry's only sexual experiences had been a few snogs and gropes with soft, friendly girls, and then rape.  He hadn't even touched himself since their escape; hell his cock hadn't given one twitch since his capture.  The idea was so far-fetched, that it took him a moment to realize anyone would want sex.
, you aren't dead.  Lupin, I will return in three weeks."  And with a crisp nod and a swirl of his robes, Snape left.
Draco stilled.  Harry, continuing to fuck Draco with his finger, tore his eyes away and looked up at Snape.  His lips were parted and his breaths were coming in shallow.  Those dark eyes glistened.
Ripping the note from the wall, Harry slumped onto the nearest stool, the ache in his arse another reminder of something else terrible that had recently happened to him.  What a day.  He wished that he'd read his horoscope yesterday, it might have given him a clue, told him to stay the hell home, avoid blondes, stick close to the work-place.  Protect those that he loved.
Gripping the collar of Draco's shirt, Harry slammed him against the wall.  Draco grunted at the impact and clutched at Harry's strong arms, trying to pull them off.  Rough portions of brick wall dug into his back and head and he growled under his breath.
or magically hidden in some other way, not within Hermione's home anyway.  It was either locked up somewhere far away, and therefore probably lost forever to them, or hidden in plain view as Draco suggested earlier.  But nothing jumped out at Harry.  He needed a new set of eyes, someone who knew what he was looking for.
"Yes, I'm ready." Draco walked around the bar and right past Harry towards the doors. Harry cursed under his breath, questioning the sanity of going to dinner with Draco, but picked up his speed to catch up to the Slytherin anyway.
"Remus. He's— He's changing! Like back in the Labyrinth." Draco sounded frantic. Harry turned away from Sirius, his heart understanding more than his mind would allow, and looked to Remus.
Remus was amazed he heard no condensation or bitterness from the aristocratic man over the shabby accommodations.
This is where Potter spun.  Where, with more skill and finesse than he'd ever done anything except maybe fly, the man
Snape stopped his preparations and bracing his hands against the counter, he faced up into the dungeon walls; Peeves stared at Draco, then at Hermione, then returned his gaze to Draco once more.  "It's all very embarrassing actually," he admitted.
Time was running out, and Harry was beginning to lose it.  Hermione had been trying to calm him down for the last twelve hours, but his frantic anxiety finally forced her to drug him without his consent.  He wasn't sure if he would ever trust drinking anything Hermione gave him again.
His voice was soft, and he sang in an off-tune falsetto.  Really, Harry didn't think he sounded all that good, a little too fake, and that bolstered his own nerve.  He joined in for the next line.
"Let me try.  Thanks though."  He looked up at Draco and smiled softy.  Draco stilled the urge to kiss him, instead he handed back his wand.
"Hello, I'm Draco.  And you are?" he asked ignoring the man's attempt to leave, determined to find out more about this person, as if he were some mystery totally devised for Draco's own entertainment.
Remus only shook his head.  "I don't know, Harry.  It's an old ritual and hasn't been performed in the last 300 years.  There isn't much written down about it.  Why do you ask?" he asked curiously.
"Black Millie, time to ready the staves," she says with breezy nonchalance, her voice just floating over the din of the crashing footsteps, roared out charms and the constant groan of the
Harry felt that he was at a precipice in the pitch black of night. Did he continue to walk forward? He felt ready to take that one step into the unknown, his foot hovering in space ready to see if it landed in void and he fell forever or a sturdy path and strong arms were there to catch him. He wanted to take that step. He wanted to know what would happen next. It was his next great event.
Then, for a brief flash, their eyes met.  Lucius' eyebrows rose as Draco's furrowed together, and then the man smiled, an almost caring expression considering his usual stoicism.
"Cat?" Potter said, confused, then lifted his hand to his mouth and to Draco's surprise, he wrapped his fingers around his tongue.  "Waat doya mea?" he mumbled.  "Cah?"
"First, I talked to Doug Carrow and Nicetus Spence, remember them? Spence was the one who approached me first, before I even heard about all this. Then I talked with Nott; he'd been invited to a meetin' as well. That's when I found out 'bout his dad. This fucking rots!" Greg once again seemed to have lost his focus.
Kingsley clapped him on the shoulder. "I'm proud of you, all of you," he said, a small, thoughtful smile setting on his lips.
The other reason to take up nightly rounds of the castle was that Draco also took up wandering the halls, mumbling to himself about his spidey senses that warned him of a traitor in their midst.  Harry found this terribly ironic, because
"Well, there were two more Dark items we collected that we believe were sold by our guy. One victim is in the hospital being treated for shriveled lungs. His prognosis isn't good," Plincher said in a subdued tone.
Draco rolled his eyes.  "I'll show you when we get there.  Let's go."  He turned back to the Floo, called out "Auror Headquarters," and whirled through.
How could Remus do this to him?  The only card he hadn't pulled were those worthless three words so many romantic couples tossed around.  Remus wanted to grow old with him?  When did this happen?  Nobody wanted to grow old with Severus; he was as bristly as they came.  And did he want some mangy wolf hanging around all those years?
Or perhaps, though Draco is loath to admit it, it was that moment when Harry refused Draco's hand, so many years ago.  Immature and haughty, he wanted to be friends with the famous boy, and now he's the man's captive, locked away on a bilge-heavy ship, mere feet apart from where he sleeps, and Draco can't quite face what that does to him, in the dead of night.
With effort, Harry propped himself up on an elbow and began scribbling.  He drew out a sigil along with some wand movements and a long litany of words.  "You need to draw the sigil on the floor where you are performing the spell," he said panting for breath.  "Then just cast the spell.  It clears the mind of influences.  Useful spell, that."  After the effort, he fell back down to the table and closed his eyes.
Now angry, he jumped to his feet and watched as Tufts tore into the man, slicing at him with long claws and ripping out flesh with sharp teeth.  Repeatedly he could hear
He stared at Sirius. Sirius stared at him. With one tentative hand Remus reached out… and touched his oldest friend.
Harry stopped in mid-flop and looked over at Draco, who still had his gaze locked on the drawings of the comic.  With ears held back, a guilty look plastered itself over Harry's face.  "But you smell so good."  He slammed his lips closed.  Merlin, did he just confess undying love or what?
Draco paused his speech and leveled his gaze at Potter.  The green of Potter's eyes seemed lost amidst the white and his mouth hung open in a fair rendition of the pierced perch.  It was a tragically unattractive look.  Draco waited.
"Hello, Harry," Luna said.  "Hey, Teddy."  She sat in the chair next to Harry and began reading the menu.  A bright blue ribbon was tied around her right pinky finger.  Still standing where he'd stopped when he first spotted Harry, Neville's jaw was slack and his brown eyes were wide with shock.
"We'll have to think of your name if you want to stay," Luna says.  "Maybe Plundering Pansy or Buccaneer Parkinson or …"
"Agh!"  Draco was yanked to the ground.  "Help, it's going to eat me!"  With surprising speed, Draco was dragged through shrubs and berry bushes, foot first, until he reached the bottom of a stately tree.
"No," came the very close reply.  Potter seemed to have forgotten the whole concept of personal space.  Draco stood tall and turned to look down the man.
Kogelmann tilted his head in affirmation and tossed the ball right at Remus; it was instinct that caused him to reach out and grab it. The crooked smile that Kogelmann didn't even try to hide caused Remus to drop the ball immediately. It hit the floor with a 'pong' and harmlessly bounced away. "What the hell was that?" Remus demanded.
The two men looked up into the sky.  A thick blanket of clouds covered the moon.  A silence swallowed them up, pocketing them into their own private universe.
Remus looked at it, then looked at the three men standing above him. "Wore me out, is all. Between that damned thing and Moony… just wore me out." He took a deep breath and let it gush from his lungs as he rubbed one hand across his temple. It was covered in a sheen of sweat.
Draco feels slightly guilty when he discovers he's not the only captive on the ship until he realizes Pansy's not Anchored with a charm, but free to come and go.
Aghast, Draco gaped at Harry, but there wasn't any shock or admonition in his face; he just had that stupidly open look that caused Draco, at times, to want to confide in him, treat him like a friend.  He cocked his head to one side, totally unfazed by Draco's attack.  "Really?" he asked, so casually, so gently.  "Tell me about it."
"Oh, shite," Draco said, his voice oddly soft.  "I'm so… Stay down!"  This time Draco landed on top of Harry--whose brain tried to register he had a very warm, very firm Draco on top of him--as another blue ball flew down the hallway.  Its course twisted and blew up the far wall, taking out a 300-year-old painting of Fletcher the Alchemist.
It was an odd mystery of the universe: Gaydar.  Hermione had told him all about it and it amused him to no end.  He certainly had no such internal sense of someone's sexual preference.  He had to do it the old-fashioned way.  Either blatantly eyeball them or start up a little chat and see where conversation led.  And apparently he was either sending out 'gay vibes' or this guy was definitely ballsy.
And Harry looked up at Snape again as Draco stilled his movements.  The man's face was firm, but Harry could see that he was smiling in his own way.  He could see a flush to his cheeks and their eyes met.  Snape nodded.
There were no sparks, no flashy lights, just a stream of magic billowing from his wand, from his hand and from his very soul. It swallowed and engulfed the Dark Lord, embracing him like a tender lover.
"Well, if you think that—maybe—your anger slips, then perhaps you do have some control… issues. Harry, I'm not saying you do or you don't, I'm just saying that I have some understanding on losing control. It isn't easy, but you can rein it in. If anyone can, you can. If you want to talk about it, I'm here. And Draco's here. You have a very dedicated group of people who are all there for you."
"Give him a minute," she said, and Teddy felt like demanding what the hell she knew that nobody else seemed to.  He and Neville stood by helpless, but Luna seemed ready, waiting.
"What do you mean you couldn't find us a way home?!" Harry yelled.  "You said you found a spell!"  He sat up and glared down at Severus.  He was betrayed.
do this, Draco.  He is our last chance.  With him we can break this spell your father has over Britain.  We can take him down!  Can't you make this little sacrifice?" she begged, and Draco pulled his haughtiness around him like a shield.
"It certainly can be."  Draco was certain of this, though he hated to contradict Lucius.  "Revenge for a past misdeed has been handed down from Slytherin to Slytherin as a fair and viable reason to annihilate those who stand against us."
But Harry was more than willing to do it for Draco.  Draco saved his arse during the war and as one of his closest friends, it was the least he could do for him.
"You're naked!"  Harry couldn't stop his roaming eyes.  Apparently, Snape was very comfortable strutting about for all the world to see.
The scent of salt saturates the air.  The chair he is strapped to is metal and not comfortable.  He shifts; he has to pee.
Though he'd loved them, Draco'd never believed in fairytales.  Like the moon hanging low in the sky, those tales sailed beyond reach.  Now, he found it hard not to start.  In some twisted way—pale skin, black hair, eyes a spark brighter than strictly human—Harry looked like he'd just stepped from one.  No weak-willed Disney version, but the true Marfin and Dibble stories wizard children read along with Beedle the Bard.
"Yes, well, he has more information but it's all in that code I used during the war.  He can't read it, and I can't get to it without him letting me have it."
"Yeah, yeah," Remus agreed, pushing off the bench to stand up, tilting a little to his left. He lowered the plunger. Home. He couldn't go back there. The smell alone would drive him to unspeakable acts of insanity. He exited the park with no true destination in mind, his dry throat longing for a drink.
Ted Riley looked up from a set of papers on his desk and smiled congenially at Harry.  He was a wiry man with thin lips, rather nondescript except for the stiff way he held himself, as if always ready to be jumped.  His only other distinguishing feature was his very short hair, an anomaly amongst wizardkind.
"I don't know," Harry said finally, still struggling with himself. "There's something—" he stopped and stared up towards the ceiling. He could see the colourful sparkles reflecting the light from the windows, dazzling one moment and vanishing the next as clouds blocked out the sun. "Something in the air."
Draco turned right around to leave—sod it, he wasn't that hungry anyway—but he heard his name being called, and it wasn't tainted with hatred or anger.  He stopped his retreat and looked back at the knitting delinquent.
Potter held himself rigid.  The dark prince gained his feet; Draco could see the curse would not be forgiven.
A soft step behind him gave alert that Draco had finally entered the room. He felt a touch on his shoulder and he glanced at the man. Draco's expression was soft and caring, and Harry felt torn between sorrow for Hermione and tenderness for Draco.
"You sure this is going to hold?" Draco asked as he stared at the staff all wrapped up in what looked like mummy's gauze. It'd been Harry's idea, to somehow nullify the power emanating from the staff, and they'd come up with a binding spell modified with an inhibiting charm. Draco mentioned an artefact he had stored in his collection, ancient mummy wraps, and Harry couldn't seem to get that image out of his head, so his magic had formed into the guise of tattered gauze. The world loved to mock Draco's sense of propriety.
Severus snorted.  "You seem to lack faith in my magical research skills, Harry."  Harry rolled his eyes.  "I worked off of those circumstances.  Without knowing what Rowle cast, it will take some time to unscramble.  As it was, I found this spell to layer the dimensions together on Beltane and Samhain."
"Fine, Severus," Draco said, casting quick glances to Harry, his eyes returning to Severus each time.
With a nod, Harry finally relaxed and smiled. "Okay, let's go check it out after I contact Apis. I'm sure that your little collection isn't anything to worry about."
deaths.  All you know is violence and pain.  You people are insane, you know that?  Read any Muggle psychology manual and you will find people like you labeled
Potter gave a cursory glance to his own menu.  "I'll just have the special, Margie.  And another Stella, please."  He smiled at the waitress, a boyish tilt to his head.
"Remus," Harry began and the older man looked up at him. "I've been thinking. I don't have a job anymore and really, I don't want to work for anyone either. I don't know what I want to do. So, I was thinking of opening a shop." Remus frowned at him. "I'm just not sure what kind. Any suggestions?"
That night they all slept in Snape's room.  They'd enlarged the bed, and Draco forcibly chose the middle, though Harry wasn't about to argue with him for it.  It dawned on him that being in bed with two of his adversaries might be strange, however, the most striking thing was that he hadn't felt this safe in as long as he could remember.
"Potter, while we're here, shall I call your wife?"  He tried to sound snide, mean even, reminding the man of his responsibilities but then Tufts' ears shot up.
Draco hadn't wanted to kiss him for three days now; he only seemed to want comfort.  Harry missed the kisses.
he want?  Acceptance?  Approval?  Acknowledgement?  It wasn't that he was ashamed—a pureblood, pedigreed aristocrat like himself had nothing to be ashamed of—it was that he wished to be known for something other than his breeding, other than his childhood actions.  That people couldn't recognize his shrewd mind for business or his grace on the dance floor frustrated him.  Even without his father's inheritance—all holdings seized by the courts after Lucius' post-mortem trial—Draco had worked his way up with only his cleverness and noble name, now tarnished by the Dark Mark.  Like father, like son.
"Remus is a celebrated war hero,” Harry said calmly.  “If it wasn't for his actions during the war, we might not have won against Voldemort.  Please treat him with the respect he deserves.  And from now on Kingsley will be handling his case."  Harry turned to walk out, but Riley called him back.
"It is good to see you, gentlemen. It was quite a surprise to have Miss Granger awake this morning. Pleasant surprise indeed," she said and winked at Harry as she turned towards Hermione's door.
Since the chaos of the mutations, classes had been suspended and the students had been left to entertain themselves.  Luckily most of the student body had read Fred and George's treatise on "getting away with it," and knew a variety of contraceptive spells, otherwise an entire generation could be blamed on just a single event.  Well, wars did that, he figured.  But was this a war?  Did they have some enemy like Draco assumed, or was this some kind of accident, some freak chance of nuclear power mixing with magical power and voila! mutations happened?  Harry snorted.  While he hadn't put much thought to it, even he didn’t think an event of this magnitude could happen by chance.  But it was an interesting theory and while everyone slogged away to discover some way to explain this rash set of events, to cure their mutations, maybe Harry would try to prove it was chance.  With a new goal in mind, he returned to his dorm room to sleep on it.
.  They still had over a day.  One full, solid, complete set of 24 hours to finish before Voldemort's soul would die, taking every Death Eater with it.
"There was a Floo?" Neville blurted and Luna glared at him.  Teddy rolled his eyes at Neville's general inability to stay on the ball.
"Malfoy, I'm positively charmed.  You even clean up the streets with your own two hands.  I'm sure their list of skills is endless."
sex with men was like and with just that promise he was coming, erratic and never-ending.  He cried out with the intensity: names and gods and affirmations, groaning out as his energy was leached from his body.
He scrambled away, shocking his brain into greater heights of torture, and eyed the large reptile, blinking his blurry eyes several times to clear out the unshakable sleepiness.  The snake didn't move.
It was wide open out there in the valley and a healthy amount of panic washed over Harry.  His eyes darted around, seeking out any threat: a man lurking nearby, a flash of white Death Eater mask.  It was vast and there was nowhere to hide.  Instinctively he leaned close to Snape, touching sides with him.
Harry reached out and took the small figurine. He held it with quiet reverence and nodded at Draco's words. "I'll make sure to call you if I need you. Does this mean you're leaving?"
He slipped in quietly, trying to avoid the attention of any reporters or general admirers who hadn’t quite accepted that Harry Potter, Boy Saviour of the World, was now a man who didn’t want people to harass him for autographs or hear just how amazing they thought he really was.  It took little time to find Ron, who has hanging out at his favourite spot: the bar.
Harry sneezed and Draco glared at him.  Harry finally realized something.  "You're not allergic to me."  Draco had not once sneezed at him.
As the blunt end of the snake's head pressed into his armpit, Harry jumped, a shiver just shy of a tickle coursing down the length of his arms and legs.
Snarling reached Draco's ears as he pulled himself together after the harsh curse.  He'd been under the Cruciatus many times during the Dark Lord's reign; but it'd been years, and he'd grown soft with his safe job and lack of life on the edge.  Suddenly, he missed his home and his safety, even his unexciting job helping other people achieve powers he never could.  He longed for his books, sniping at Severus, and visiting with his son.  A powerful longing for his placid predictability overwhelmed him.
Silently, Cat-footed Charm in place, Harry took slow step after step towards the kitchen, easily walking through the familiar, yet darkened apartment.  His
slipping from Snape's lips carried with it the sin of a thousands rent boys.  "Suck and rub.  Suck again, deeper."  When Snape said 'deeper,' he pushed the waistband of Harry's pants down.  Harry shifted to let Snape push them down past his hips.  He felt awkward, his bare arse hanging out in the air, a cock head brushing against the roof of his mouth, but when a finger trailed down Harry's tailbone, down into his crack, thoughts of awkwardness were quickly banished by, 'Oh Merlin, Snape is going to play with my hole.'
He's the fourth over the bulwark, the flood of pirates behind him pressing him over the railing, tumbling him lemming style, thrown into the unknown.  Someone steps on his hand, another kicks him in the shin, and still they come, even as the Death Eaters swarm them with a volley of stunners, Cruciatus, and the green flash of death.
Harry throws back his head and laughs.  It's full and straight from the belly; his dark hair is tossed back and looks like the wing of a crow ready to take flight.  When Harry catches his breath, he sits up straight, eye bright with tears.  "Oh, don't worry about that," he says.  "Deadbones is a vegetarian."
"Oh, that would be Steven Manikin, out on the Head, about six and a half kilometers from the lighthouse.  He's a fairly shy boy, keeps to himself.  Came here 'bout three years ago.  About your age, I'd say."
He looked over at Draco, sitting in a chair near the door, watching the Gryffindors talking. When he noticed Harry watching him, Draco smiled.
"Can't we recreate the scenario that trapped us here?  Use a Sanctuary Spell and whatever it was Rowle cast?" Harry asked.
The bar certainly catered to a lower class than he was used to, but at this moment Draco didn't care.  Even with the stale scent of cigarette smoke and beer infiltrating the air, it was still the air of freedom and he breathed deep.  The crowd certainly registered low on the scale of human dignity, but even through the mass of tourists and journeymen, he still had hopes of finding someone to help him relieve a little stress for the night.
"That bastard Rowle.  He sabotaged my spell.  My Sanctuary Spell was compromised.  We should have been moved to a pocket of safety until I ended the spell.  This is an entirely different world," he growled, stomping around the perimeter of their cottage once more, vicious detection charms hurled out into the air.
But, he had to wait. It was not his time to act, he knew that, but even then it hadn't made it any easier.
With two strokes he was at the water's edge, and he climbed up the rocks until he was facing Severus.  "I…"
The mix of smells within the room overpowered Remus' sensitive nose as emotions ran high, and he gave up trying to make sense of it all.  He scanned the rolled up parchment in Harry's hand, wondering what that little exchange was all about
"Well, apparently you two get along," Weasley said with a smirk.  Draco was shocked; he didn't think Ginger had it in him.  "Okay, so if you're up for it, Malfoy, I would like to send you and Harry to Bulgaria and Seamus will go to Scotland first.  Check in if you do or do not find anything.  I'll give you your next location if you don't find anything, and if you do, then we'll get Seamus over there along with some other Aurors."
It was all very surreal.  Last night Draco had been with two men….  Two men he knew, not strangers, not anyone he'd pondered dating, and two of them.
"Scrimgeour wants the Staff to control wizardkind. We're certain he has the orb portion of the Staff. Sirius has the wooden shaft of the Staff under control… somehow. There is still the feather. For all we know Scimgoeur has it, though I doubt it or he would have done something more overt."
"And now," Draco looked up into Severus' eyes; he could see them pooling and glowing with tears unshed.  "Now it's too fucking late for anything.  It's too fucking late to find out if… well, maybe this new Harry might not have been too dull after all.  Might have still been a fun challenge.  But I turned my back on him because I was too fucking good.  Too fucking good for everyone and everything and now it's too late.  It's all over.  We're going to fucking
"Figured what out?" Harry asked, unable to look away from the calculating look on the doll's porcelain face.
"Draco…I'm sorry," Harry said in a soft voice, sitting up straighter on the bed.  "I didn't mean…"  Draco watched as Harry floundered for words and Severus rolled his eyes.  Slowly, he made his way across the room, one shuffle at a time until he too sat on the bed, on the opposite side as Severus, like a pair of Slytherin bookends.
Potter dropped the sentence.  His shoulders sagged, and he seemed empty, less of himself and that just pissed Draco off.
Draco snorted as he turned to the door and searched for curses. The door pulsed with magic, practically groaned under the weight of it. But they weren’t all curses or warding spells. Intricately imbedded in the molecular bonding of the doorway were containment magics such as he'd never sensed before. There had to be something big behind this door. Bigger than the arch. Bigger than the staff. Bigger than…
"Of course.  I am Draco Malfoy, vampire extraordinaire with a bite that rocks your socks."  He winked at Harry, who blushed deliciously and laughed at his corny joke.
"Harry, are you unsure of what happened, or are you just having problems putting it to words?" Remus intervened.
The sixth had eluded them for months.  Dumbledore had left them with the hint that it might be in a Ravenclaw or Gryffindor relic.  They researched everything they could about the two Founders and what other legacies they might have left behind.  Ron wondered if it could be the Sorting Hat, since it had once been Godric Gryffindor's, but every bit of research they did on the hat revealed nothing.  The true hint came when Harry finally placed the Sorting Hat on his head.  It actually sang a song for him.
Potter sat on the examination table that Draco'd Transfigured from a metal stool in his lab.  Dressed only in his pants, he was kicking his feet over and over causing the table to rock.  With his new wand and a set of sensitive instruments Draco'd got from Pansy, he had Potter hooked up and was scanning him for every anomaly he could think of.
"First," Draco said, and a vocal part of his brain was screaming that he was an idiot and that he should just kiss Potter right now and not ask such irrelevant questions, but he asked anyway.  "Who is Richy?"
"Bibble, have you been stealing sheep from this field?"  Harry stood over the poor little man, wand steady and aimed at his overly large nose.  What Draco had first though was an amorphous head was really a floppy, woolen cap.
"So, after you have the rune, you also need another thing from the parchment. Using the rune, the coordinates and some Arithmancy, you lift the sigil from the parchment. In some cases you need to pass the document through a candle to heat it for the sigil to lift properly."
But when Draco reached out, ran the tips of his fingers over one of his furred arms, Harry was in heaven.
"Yeah!  Of course!  I thought I was chatting up some gorgeous Brit, but I was hitting on a dude!"  Lily flinched and then rose to leave.  Samuel, the bartender, caught Lily's eye and the silent communication offered enough assurance that he sat again.
Draco's eye twitched.  "This is your room."  With a gentle nudge, he pushed open the door and gestured Potter into the room that housed a dresser, a bed and a small washroom.  There were no windows—he hadn't even bothered to spell one to show the outside, he hadn't seen the point—and neither was there any art.  It was bare and utilitarian.
incident you are speaking of in which you might have been stupid.  Unfortunately, there are many to choose from."
"Well," Draco drawled, "does he know how to destroy it?" He figured that would be too simple, but certainly worth a shot.
Harry out.  Only after giving into Shacklebolt's veiled threats and urgent pleas.  Harry made Draco sound practically philanthropic.  It was sadly amusing.
The curse light is green, and Draco watches as it charges for him.  Green in one moment, a bottomless void in the next.  His mind finds Harry in this instant before death; he thinks of his life and hopes that he's done a little good, made Harry proud somewhere in their short interlude beyond swapped insults and immature threats.
"We'll come back, Hermione. Crookshanks is here and he's been keeping you company. And we'll come back and talk to you every day, okay?"
"Yes, but they were fighting for your lives!"  Draco stands, slamming his fist against the table rattling silver and glassware, startling the tense flock of pirates as if they were yearling sheep.  "It wasn't like you people were stopping it.  She'd never been a member of the Dark Lord's people, you know.  She was trying to help
"Seriously?"  He'd thought that a joke.  Cow's blood and lilies?  It was too easy?  It was like using water to destroy invading aliens.  Iron to take down fairies.  A picture of beautiful, naked women to reduce a ninja master to a bloody nosed simpleton.  He felt betrayed and abandoned by the simplicity of the world.
He still continued to meet with Lily: find him at The Moon and Mars.  They would go home and fuck and God, Draco didn't know if he could handle another morning alone, but he kept coming back and kept taking Lily to his bed and kept begging him not to leave, though they both knew he would.
"It is time that we, the British magical population, confront these violent actions.  Harry Potter is a terrorist and our Ministry is mishandling him.  He is not a hero.  He is not someone to cheer, someone in which to offer aid.  His actions breed death and destruction.  More than 300 people have fallen at his hands, been
Harry reached out to the dip of Draco's back and pressed all five fingers into the pool of oil.  The prone man twitched.
"Nothing.  Let's go get Charlie, okay."  His voice was rough, husky almost.  Why hadn't Harry noticed it before?  It was just a whisper.  A controlled whisper.
They walked down the hallway, slowly and with care.  Harry had Greyback's wand at the ready, and Draco seemed to have found enough energy to walk on his own.  They reached the door and Snape looked at them each in turn and they nodded.  With a twist of the knob, they burst through the door.
Though his need was wistful, Harry found he couldn't breathe.  Somewhere along this long night Harry had fallen into something warm, frantic, a little unsettling.  It was so heavy, this feeling.  Draco was smiling, a kind of bemused expression he didn't seem fully prepared for.  Harry wanted to see him smile forever.
"Snape…" Harry said in a warning tone.  Normally, Harry could easily say that he'd never harbored any fantasies about his old Potions professor.  It wouldn't quite be the truth, but he had gotten good at ignoring certain things about himself.  It wasn't what people imagined when Harry Potter came to mind; it wasn't what they expected of him.  It was bad enough that Harry had abandoned the path of the Auror, or the Quidditch star.  But Harry, being attracted to a man?  Nobody would expect that.  It wasn't something he would have even let himself think about, afraid to open that Pandora's Box.
Harry reached out and brushed Draco's hair, barely ghosting his fingers over the fine strands, causing them to glide under his skin. Then he drew his fingers down the side of Draco's face, and Draco leaned into the touch, his eyes half-closed with a smile on his lips like a contented feline. With gentle anticipation, Harry leaned forward and kissed him.
"Yeah," Harry said.  His body had long ago forgone shivering.  Maybe it was trying to commit suicide.  Maybe today was the day he wouldn't eat the crap they laid out for him.  Maybe today he would just die.
As he took his place behind the speaker's stand and lifted up his mostly empty glass, he scanned the mass of people.  Wizards and witches from all over, from all generations, looked up at him, most with awe, some with a less enthusiastic response, only a few with disdain, or at least only a few who would openly show their disdain.  All had eyes on him.
Terry's smile doesn't possess even an iota of friendliness.  Draco remembers the Ravenclaw from Hogwarts; isn't he a Muggleborn?  If that's true, then his family—along with the families of all magical people unable to trace their ancestry back at least three magical generations—had been forced to leave Britain or go to Azkaban.  “Sure, coming right up, Mr. Malfoy.”  He speaks Draco's name like it's a taunt.  Then he leans down and pushes a tin plate through the small hole along the floor of the barred door.  Draco continues to look at Terry's face, then his stomach grumbles and his eyes slip from the mocking quirk of lips to the plate presenting a single piece of bread.
"I can't.  I've got this meeting with the French ambassador, and the Committee for Werewolf Rights is still being stubborn; I couldn't leave it right now."  There was so much to do.  Harry couldn't just leave it all.  That would be irresponsible.
Morning dawned through his office window where he'd already burned a few hours writing a report on what he'd discovered about the curse and the potential locations of the caster.  He expressly urged that the caster had to be found to remove the curse and then submitted his report to the head of the Auror Division.
Draco's eyes sprung wide at the sight.  "You know," he said, his voice completely languid and deeper than normal.  "You keep doing that and I might have to tackle you for another go."
"Potter, Lupin," he greeted. Remus offered a small smile and a nod, pushing a tower of parchment aside so Malfoy could get to a chair.
"Mr. Malfoy, thank you for coming," Potterette said.  Tufts blinked at him but he felt distinct warmth coming from the cat.
"I’m going to enter you now, Harry.  Just one finger.  Don't stop sucking Draco.  If you stop, I will stop."
With violent force, Draco jutted his wand at Schooner, almost skewering the man.  "You will break this curse on Harry, you sick fuck," he spat out.  "You will break it or I will break you, and have no doubt that I know exactly how to prolong your screams for so long your neighbors will think the place haunted.  Remember, Schooner, I was a Death Eater, too."
"Revenge is not noble, Draco," Lucius said.  Thomas, lounging on the idyllic pastureland, growled as he munched on seal blubber, but didn't have much else to add.
Gibbibuck glanced from Harry to Draco.  "That sword is goblinmade, and I demand you return it!" he squeaked.  "It is rightfully ours!"
"HOLY FUCK!" Harry heard over the incessant din and he looked over to see Ron and Plincher running towards the smoke billowing around the door where Braithwaite, Burns and Meyers had been.
"Do you know of any Healers you can trust?" he asked.  "Avoid anyone working for St. Mungo's, you know they're all under the Ministry's control.  I wouldn't trust them as far as I could kick 'em."
"Good. Then go." Shacklebolt nodded, then turned, and with a gesture gathered seven men with him. Together they trudged through the snow, disappearing around the edge of the building. The others gathered around Scrimgeour, ready for his next command.
Then a piercing scream ripped through the booming and rumbling that had the building rocking in its foundation. It was high and full of pain. Remus had no idea where it might be coming from and couldn't focus on it at all through his own dulled senses.
Then Draco took to soaping Harry up, and it was the most glorious thing—other than the malicious water aspect—to have Draco rubbing his hands over his head, arms, back.  He instructed Harry, like one would a toddler, to get to his 'private places' and Harry blushed under his layer of tan and turned his back to clean himself further. The water was warm, and the scent of the blue and tan bubbles relaxed him.  Finally he'd finished washing and the need to get out of the water overrode any desire to remain there with Draco.
Most details of the battle had faded from Harry's memory. Their sortie was fast and exhausting, he constantly felt like he was scrambling just to stay one step ahead of the more experienced wizard. But one step was enough.
Harry's shoulders stiffened and his fingers dug deeper into his hair. A heavy sigh shifted his entire frame, and Remus heard a muffled, "Maybe."
Without Apparition, all they can do is summon the long boats and beg the merfolk to pull them fast on charmed currents.  Like watery knights, the crew surges towards their ship, towards their friends, towards the end, breaths held, prayers repeated in a mantra to every god imaginable that this night they would succeed.
Draco looked up and then Harry noticed it.  The wand light was so low he barely caught it, but when he did it was unmistakable.  Poking out from between Draco's lips was the edge of a tooth.  His canines had extended.  He'd never seen such a thing on Draco before.
"What?  No!  Of course not.  We went our ways on good terms, you know that."  He lifted his hands to shield off the next volley of questions.
"Oh really?"  Harry lifted up his hand and started ticking off fingers.  "I saw you drinking blood.  You fly.  Your eyes, they have a bit of a glow to them, you know.  And during the day… dead to the world… literally.  If not a vampire, then what are you?"
games in Potter's presence and hadn't once thought to hex him.  Unnerved, Draco stood.  "Well, that was no challenge."  With a flip of his hand he turned and left the room, leaving Potter alone again.
The dark blood swirled in languid laps within the glass.  Harry twisted, squeaking against the leather of the couch.  Gripping Draco's gaze over the rim of the glass, Harry drank.
"Welcome back, Snape," the boy said.  Harry smiled at him, but it was a sad smile.  Severus noticed that he still wore the sling, but at least it looked like he could use his arm.
He lifted his face up to the darkening sky as alarms filled the air.  People were emerging from buildings, milling out in the street like lost spirits.  "Now I turn away on this past I've been living.  I can't hide here anymore.  There are other places to which I am bound."  And with his vow spoken, he returned to Harry.
"Harry," Draco murmured.  "Harry, I'm so sorry," kiss, "I waited," kiss, "and was so standoffish."  The final kiss was lingering and his lips parted to entice Harry's tongue to join his own.  Eagerly, Harry opened for him and the kiss deepened; all thoughts of words and apologies evaporated as their passion climbed.
Harry loved kissing him and nothing could darken his days--lighter and lighter as they raced towards spring.
Oh Merlin, that was something he'd thought long dead and buried.  He tried to think of Ginny, but a log jam blocked his windpipe at the attempt.
"I don't know.  Do something funny.  Impersonate a ferret," Harry said with a laugh as he looked over his shoulder at Draco.  Draco stood back lit by the fire, a fist anchored on each of his hips.  Harry quickly faced forward, examining the pile of chopped greenery.  Oops.
"Starve," Draco said simply.  Then with a roll of the eyes he continued, "It's just one of the many steps of contrition I must pay for my wild, playboy years."
"I thought you would be happy here, Draco.  I've even been working on a new name for you."  She looks up into the rigging for a moment, watches the lemur shimmy along the ropes.  "Death's Head Draco.  Marauding Malfoy."  She looks back at him.  "Though that's too close to the ship's name," she pats the ship's railing, "and people might think she's yours."
Pansy elbows Luna lightly in the side, jerking her chin towards Draco.  He's gone pink, his mouth slack as Harry licks down one finger, sucks on it a bit, then dives in for more potatoes.
"Where did he get all this?" Pansy asked, and Draco shrugged, watching Harry organize some bolts and nuts into a model of the Eiffel Tower.
Swallowing down some half chewed toast, Remus nodded. "You know I would do anything to help out. As if I would mind." He shovelled another forkful into his mouth. He noticed Harry didn't look at him as he ate and consciously slowed down, taking smaller bites. He actually didn't remember the last full meal he'd eaten.
Draco wrapped Harry up in his arms and the two men spun away.  Harry didn't know where this surprise would be, but he hadn't expected them to land in France, underneath the Eiffel Tower.  Snow smothered the entire landscape.  He could feel the magic in the air.
"Harry?" Draco asked, his voice velvety and ethereal.  Harry grunted a little and stirred, but did not waken.  Draco lifted a finger and began tracing his curse scar, slowly mapping the lightning shape.
working.  I can't just leave the store unattended.  Perhaps I can come by after I close the shop or tomorrow before 7 a.m.?"
Draco reached out for the paper, paused, then took it from Harry's feeble grip.  It had been crumpled in one corner, the tacked on letters pulling free in places from the Muggle paste.  Draco held it tightly between a forefinger and thumb and read the threat.  His eyebrows rose, his lips pursed, and Harry stared at him, hope sparkling within the green of his eyes.
Ron smiled.  "Oh, nothing."  He waved his hand to brush the question aside.  "Thanks for coming over."  Ron's grin brightened, and Draco's gaze flittered from Ron to Harry.  Harry wordlessly held out the note.
"Draco, Draco. Please, love. Draco," Harry mumbled over and over as blank eyes stared towards the swirling orb, just beyond his fingertips. "Draco." Harry rained kisses down upon his face, oblivious to the action around him as he pressed his weight down against Draco's struggles.
He found Potter curled up on Draco's bed.  The pillow was pulled close to his chest and Potter's face was half buried in its folds.  This close Draco could see grey streaking the once black hair and he had a disturbing urge to touch him—to simply reach out his hand and run it over the locks of hair that shimmered in the candlelight.  Something seemed to draw him to this man who had gone through so much and still strove to live on, to exist.  The sheer propensity of his life amazed Draco.
The restaurant, a posh Italian place in Diagon Alley called Café Angelo's, was Draco's pick and the bill, Draco promised, was Harry's. Harry just sighed in resignation. Draco ordered an expensive dinner, complete with lobster and truffles, and an expensive wine, something Tuscan, and enjoyed every moment of it. Harry ordered something plebian with too many noodles and aubergine. However, he did seem to enjoy the wine. Perhaps he wasn't a total loss.
Remus let lose Severus' shoulders and then gripped his hand tight.  "It is your choice.  Make up your mind quickly, Severus.  Because if you choose not to go through with the Exchange Ritual, I want to drag you back to our room and have my way with you before time runs out."  Remus waggled his eyebrows at him in a completely lecherous way, and Severus snorted in amusement.  He could still see the melancholy in the other man's features, but knew Remus was struggling to make this easier for Severus.  He was letting him choose.  Years with this man, with this witty, smart, sexy man.
"Hermione!" Harry finally said.  "Calm down, would you.  What's gotten your knickers all in a bunch?"
His normal mockery of Potter's lovesick puppy, however, was stalled as Dog Man approached him by walking down the center of the road.  One mutt paced him on either side, and Draco covered up his very minute dog anxiety by bolstering himself up with the knowledge that the man feared him enough to bring those lowbred monsters.
"You don't say!  A cape!  Like a super hero or something?  Aren't those supposed to be out of style?"  She chuckled, her mouth around her fork.  "He must be Superman."
"How you doing, by the way?  You miss Lily?  Ginny?"  He didn't look at Potter when he asked.  He knew he always missed Scorpius.
"Here Pansy, take mine."  He surrenders all of his utensils and picks up his chicken wing with his hands.  All the purebloods look at him with a kind of mesmerized curiosity.  When he finishes his chicken, fingers licked clean, he examines his mashed potatoes.
"I'm certain. Okay. Here is how we make a brick." Draco pulled his power together and forced his magic to look like a brick. He imbued it with mental shielding energy, the foundation of Occlumency. What he ended up with was a rather rough looking stone with a slight similarity to a brick. "Well, that isn't very pretty, is it?" he mused.
Teddy cracked the bathroom door open and peeked out.  Peeking right back was the smiling face of his long missing godfather, Harry.
When he returned to the exit at the light bulb emporium, having met no problems and having exactly what he needed in a tightly wrapped package shrunk in his pocket, he had expected to find Harry there, quietly waiting and ready.
"Tell me," he said through tightly gripped teeth. "Tell me everything." And another bolt struck the ground right next to the man's head, who screamed, clutching into a tight ball as a stain of wetness seeped through the crotch of his pants.
The bindings slithered off their captive like wet noodles, and Bibble stood and bowed low, his oversized nose brushing the sheep-cropped grass.  "Yes, Bibble will tell others.  Leave the sheep to the wizard," and then he scurried off.
Remus' eyes darted up to meet his, and he was shocked to see guilt and worry in them.  But as quick as he saw it, it was gone and Remus smiled.  "We think we have a few leads, but we came upon a rather sizeable obstruction that we are attempting to deal with."
Severus wished Draco would focus his attentions towards someone receptive, such as Potter.  Draco was, and always would be, a son to him.  Plus, he could never be what Draco wanted… what he needed, and deep-down Severus thought that Draco recognized that as well.  They both understood that this odd devotion the young man had for Severus certainly kept him safe, kept his heart protected in isolation.
Conjuring up a spare chair, he sat down next to Harry across the bed from Ron.  They all remained in silence as they shared in Hermione's small victory.  Slowly, he started to relax and eventually drifted off, dreaming of full moons and long gone memories of running free beneath them.
It was three in the morning, and Draco had been swept up in one of those dreams where he'd done more against the Dark Lord, stood up against the Carrows, and had not been a bloody coward, striving only to save his family and his own arse.  It was the kind of dream where he'd listened to Dumbledore, and there'd been a use for him.  Where he hadn't merely been baggage.
He noticed that Draco was on the floor next to his feet with Remus not far away, his half transformed body twitching against the stones. He looked back down to Kogelmann and cursed under his breath. Dropping to a squat, he felt for a pulse at the man's jugular. Relief flooded Harry to find he hadn't killed the man.
"One of Malfoy's men sneaked up and cursed him."  Neville's voice cracked, and Luna wrapped him in her arms.  With that strength from his wife and a few deep breaths of air, he continued.  "None of us saw it.  I remember I was watching Teddy; he had this great ape nose."  His words were hollow.  "And then Harry yelled."  The air in the office was hot and stagnant.
"I do try."  There's a moment where Terry glares at Laura, and she rolls her eyes.  Then Draco continues.  "However, please attempt to keep up.  In my capacity as
"I can't really walk on it.  Do you think you could help me?"  And just like that Draco found himself right where he wanted to be, with Harry's arm over his shoulder, hopping beside him hip to hip through the dark cavern.
For a moment, the fairies went silent, then in an uproar they all fluttered about, dive bombing the three in a game of tag, buzzing their heads in greeting, all in welcome, all in play.
With a strained look upon his face, Greg grabbed Draco's elbow and lead him up through the streets, eventually climbing a snowy hillside of barren grapevines with the little town laid along the river at their feet.
"So, Harry.  Didn't work out with Guinevere, huh?"  Hermione sat in the chair between Harry and Ron, and Draco leaned in to listen.  Harry rolled his eyes.
"Hello, Mr. Malfoy," Potterette said with a smile.  "I'm sorry, but I've got to go pick up Lily from Molly's."  She looked down at Tufts and back up at Draco, a conciliatory grin on her face.  "Can you keep him for the rest of the day?"
Quietly, walking in slow, exaggerated movements, Draco crept up to the door and peeked in.  There he saw Harry leaning forward on his desk.  His elbows propped up his arms; his hands cradled his head.  Fingers massaged his skull through his mop of a hairstyle, and he was slowly shaking his head.
"Don't touch it.  Knowing your luck, you'll inadvertently curse it just by breathing on it.  Move away, you catastrophe."  Harry had some driving impetus to get his fingers into everything.
"Then, call Draco.  If you'd quit being a pillock, you'd realise he is your best choice. Here, I'll do it for you."  Ron twisted on his toe and sprinted for the Floo, locking Harry in the back room with a flick of his wand as he tossed in the Powder and called up the Auror division.  By the time Harry had charmed the lock open and hurled some great one-liners at Ron—he would have to remember them later for George—someone had already run off to retrieve Draco.
"Harry," Hermione said, her smile stiffening, her hands rising to cover her mouth, as if smiling and laughing were something to be shameful about.
Surprisingly, this wasn't exactly the exchange he had envisioned if he'd ever met Potter again, not that he'd often envisioned such a reunion.  He remembered after Potter had saved him from that burning room how he couldn't think of the man in the same light, and how shocked and saddened he'd been upon discovering that Potter had gone missing, could even be dead.  That emotion had been unexpected; that he'd felt anything for the man was unexpected.  But he'd long ago admitted it to himself.  He could admit a certain attachment to a ghost, but not a living, breathing person.
He woke up with Draco's arm around his waist and his sharp nose poking the back of his neck and realized just how cold he had been.  Draco was warm, soft and someone who wasn't hurting him.  Tears started slipping down Harry's face, and he began to quietly weep.
"Draco," Harry called. Ignoring him, Draco closed on the orb, the dwindling crowd of witches and wizards letting him pass as they focused on defending themselves and Wolfwood. "Draco, what the fuck?"
Harry's gaze zeroed right on him, and narrowed.  "That's not what you're supposed to say.  You're supposed to say 'Oh Harry, that's terrible.  I'm sure if you avoid the prat, you'll never have to see him again.'"
Draco can't hear everything, but when Terry finally generates enough courage from his dance of reach out and pull back, he touches Harry, gently.  Far more gently than a subordinate to his Captain, a friend to a friend.
"Schooner?  Adrian Schooner?"  Those flat eyes stared at Draco, and he wished the artist had given them more dimension, more life.
The two left the rundown hotel and began walking the streets, trying to decipher the map they had that was written with the Cyrillic alphabet, Draco constantly checking on Potter, wondering about him as they lost themselves in the town.  By sundown they finally found the two story brick building.  It was in a modest neighborhood along a busy street lined with elm trees.  Cars whizzed past them as they stood on one corner and watched the front entrance.
"Yes, we know. We're working on trying to cure you: Draco, Remus and me. Ron is doing his part, too. You're not the only person affected by the curse. However, with your shield spell up, you've been impacted differently by it."
Though he felt defeated, Harry spent the better part of the afternoon and into the night walking around the neighborhood.
Neon blazed “OPEN” in the shop's window.  After Potter went catatonic at the crossroads, Draco lugged him towards the cafe.  Options were minimal on this bizarre night, and the lamp-light glowed cheerily.  Draco planted Potter in back-corner chair.
Years ago, Draco remembered being the Ice Prince.  The icon of a pureblood, attractive, rich bastard.  Every invitation was his.  Every aristocrat wanted to gild his arm.
That evening, before the sun had settled into its bed of oranges and reds and true chill would settle over Durrus, Draco stared at himself in the washroom mirror.  It was large, almost covering the entire wall above the sink, and was immaculately clean of the usual spit and toothpaste splatter that too many rental places let build up.  He had to hand it to Mrs. Loche, at least she was fastidious about her cleaning.  It was Thursday evening, and he'd hoped to be home by tonight, to sit back with a good book, maybe that new novel by Reginald Wallingsworth about the ex-Death Eater who now fought against the illicit trading of narcotic potions in South America, or maybe talk to Severus' portrait about how he nearly made Potter cry and let his old mentor browbeat him out of his self-recrimination.  Instead he was in County Cork, surrounded by short stone walls and stupid sheep, and a great contempt had settled over him at this peaceful swatch of countryside.
"I'm here," he heard, as if Draco were standing in his brain, calmly telling him about the weather. "Calm down, would you. It's noisy in here."
When they had reached the corpse of the dragon, Harry asked to get close to it.  Draco had no desire to close the distance with a rotting corpse, but did as Harry asked.  Harry leaned against the giant form and murmured sad goodbyes to Pansy, slowly stroking her decaying flesh.
Draco swallowed and cleared his throat, but he still couldn't seem to find his voice. "Something…" he coughed once more. "I think it was the shaft of the Staff. Whatever it was Harry, it wanted you. It wanted you bad." Draco dropped the words; they sounded inane, even if their truth was explicit.
Draco looked down at the wand.  It was light in colour and something about it drew him to touch it.  He picked it up in his right hand and swished it through the air, producing a rainbow of sparkles.  Tension encasing his muscles, tension he hadn’t even realized was there, eased.
"Well, is it public knowledge?"  Obviously, Malfoy was angry too, and the two Slytherins faced each other.  Teddy, Neville and Luna remained huddled together for protection in case anything came flying their way.
Then an expression crossed Remus' face, a brief flash of sad enlightenment, "Severus.  The receiving end was Severus Snape.  Who is…"
"'History says that the Staff was wielded by the Aztec ruler. With the Spanish traveled an intrepid European wizard who understood immediately the power of the artefact. As the Aztecs were decimated, the wizard gained access to the Staff and tinkered with it. He must have been a very powerful man, very stupid, yet still very powerful. His influence in some way affected the magic of the Staff and it came to life, gained its own
The man looked shocked. "Wha… Nobody got to me. I don't know anything. Now, if you will excuse me…" and he left the room, leaving Harry alone to wonder just how big this entire thing had grown while he let time slip through his fingers.
Watching the tableau, Draco felt stupidly guilty at not having cured the man.  "When will Daddy be Daddy again?" she asked.  Tufts licked her, and she giggled.
"Yes, come in," Draco said. Ron and Harry exchanged glances, passing secret knowledge through faint facial expressions that Draco read like an open book. Stepping back, Ron let Greg enter but still held his wand aloft. Harry had lowered his to his side.
"Potter, make yourself useful and help me find that little monster."  Phase Two: The Chase.  Right on time.
"Look, Ron. Maybe I can help… unofficially." Ron looked up at his friend, a tiny glimmer of hope touching his saddened face. "We finally deciphered Hermione's notes and while most of them are totally unrelated to her research, there are some leads. We never checked out Arbormore at Cairo, so I need to go do that soon. Malfoy knew about Hexine and offered to talk to her about how this type of a curse could be related to deep, unformed magic." Ron's look of shock almost stopped Harry's dialogue, but he forged on. "There are some other things we found out. Millicent Bulstrode actually came to talk to Hermione about a curse. Apparently, she was cursed too and that was the whole reason Hermione even got involved. Remus is looking for her. Also, Hermione seemed to think—in some of her later notes—that it was caused by an ancient relic of some sort; that this kind of curse couldn't be done by mere spellwork and she was actually talking to some scholar down in Costa Rica about South American relics. So, since I need to go down that way anyway, maybe I could help with catching your bad guy. Off the record of course. I'm sure after the case is solved Kingsley will let you stay up here with Hermione."
Draco shrugged.  "Well, so far I've got loopy Potter, serious Potter and will-fuck-a-goat Potter.  I'd say yes."
"Oh, please, do shut up.  Come on.  We'll be back in a few hours if I'm right as to where I need to look."
Following a sparse meal they were in the living room with Snape sitting on the couch.  Draco stood by the fire as Snape looked him up and down, an appraising gaze that made the blond squirm.  His shirt was balled on the floor; his trousers hung low on his hips.  Harry was sitting on a kitchen chair next to the couch where Snape sat, observing everything closely: Snape's eyes, Draco's reactions, the tension in the air making everything crisp.
"I've never seen any spell so strong or so clever. Nothing is your equal. I would find peace and enjoyment in studying how you were created for the rest of my days." And in a way, Remus meant it.
"So, someone had a crystal ball and was 'zapping' people with it? Did anyone tell you how they felt after they got zapped?"
It wasn't a conversation he really wanted to have.  "Yes, sir?" he said, worried.  Things had been so… safe.
He'd eaten all of his provisions before his fever had hijacked his clear thought, and he remembered throwing his empty water jug to the far end of the cave in annoyance at discovering it empty.
He'd had to lunge for Harry to make sure the Ming vase hadn't suffered the same fate as the Grecian one had and now he sat on the floor with Harry wrapped up in his arms, struggling and flailing, screaming to "Let me go, dammit!" and telling Draco he was a "Right bastard!" and finally going quiet with little sniffles.
"Yes, this will work… All I do is change out this part with something to tie in either mental or verbal…"  He lost himself in the challenge.
Perhaps it bothered him just a little. He stood by as the first set of Aurors descended the steps and then followed after the prescribed three minutes.
Draco drops his hand and jerks his head towards the retreating woman as she disappears between two pale blue buildings.  Harry nods and the two men go to join the pirate crew.
"Oh?" Draco said, his eyebrow arched in the green dancing flames of the Floo.  "And what does Harry need help with?"
Draco took in one deep breath and let it out before he looked up to meet Harry's eyes.  "You are cursed."
Luna returns to Harry's side on the quarter deck and surveys the scurrying sailors: Lethbridge and Alsom, picked up in northern Ireland two winters back; old Firebreath; Monkey and her lemur, Piance; and then of course her mates, those she'd schooled with.  All of them rebels against the Dark Lord's rule, the bigotry over purity of blood.  She tilts her hat a little over her left eye, it gives her the dashing flourish of a Musketeer, and calls out orders that Harry passes on to her with his calm assurance.
Draco tensed worried about which Harry might show up.  Harry wrapped his arms loosely around Draco’s legs.  “It’s a symbol, in a pentagram, or a circle.  Maybe.”  He breathed Draco in again.  “But it hurts to look at, to think about.  It hurts.”  Harry swallowed.  “And it tries to get away.”
A tight feeling within him, a squeeze on his heart, shocked Harry from his frenzy. With little grace, he flopped against the church wall and slid his body to the floor, his arms loose at his sides as he pressed his back against the wood panelling. With everything muddled—his senses, his brain—he felt uncomfortably detached. He blinked and watched as Draco descended, a blurry form a million miles away. He was cold, cold and alone in this vast void. He might as well give it up. Silence cloaked him and he felt the world's weight of sorrow pressing all around him. But, there was something within him, a strong hold on his heart, supporting him from the inside. And as he struggled to keep his head afloat, eyes squeezing away the cloudy haze, Harry felt the orb's power severed.
Days later an announcement had been made about a brainstorming meeting to discuss the maelstrom, its cause and how everything could be put to rights.  As Harry passed through the halls, frustrated by everyone who reached out to touch him—had they even washed their hands?—he saw Professor Snape leading Peeves tied up by a glowing rope.
Harry turned to him, his eyes boring into Draco's as he spoke of things that had nothing to do with the tension in the air.  Draco almost chuckled.  When it came to the elephant, perhaps Harry wasn't so willing to point it out when it had to do with himself.
Draco held up his hand and then began his accusation in a professional, dry tone. “Mr. Harry Potter, I am here on behalf of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Division.  It has come to the Division's attention that….”
In the city, Harry has at least buttoned his shirt to the top and is wearing normal trousers.  All of the crew have dressed to blend in with the Muggle population.  The chest that Draco finds he has to bite his tongue more and more often to not pounce on and lick is hidden away.  He's tired of waiting.  He wants to get back to the ship and let his body do the thinking, maybe he'll pin Harry up against the wall, devour that chest, his neck, those chapped lips that are so fucking perfect.  Maybe he'll strip and await him in his bed… there, Harry couldn't misconstrue that, now could he?  They walk past a drug store and Draco wishes he could slip away and purchase lube, but he can't be more than twenty feet from Harry as a safeguard for him making a break for it.  Not that he's gone beyond five, but still, the Anchor bruises his pride.
The chicken came out juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside.  Severus certainly was a good cook.  Harry spooned some steamed carrots onto his plate and poured a glass of berry juice.  "Looks amazing, Severus," Harry told him, and Severus smiled.
But Harry was interrupted, "I don’t wait 'just a sec', if you want to talk, we talk now."  And Draco turned away, walking towards the office hallway.
that miracle and was the future and held every promise the pure existence of living ever evoked.  Draco fell into it and hoped to never be found again.
Draco laughed.  It came out pure and honest.  Greg soon joined in.  "Definitely not a phase.  But no lover out there either.  Too busy with the club… and other things.  Which is one of the reasons I came to visit."
Then the man was trapped, surrounded by the gang, and he pulled something out and pointed it at his assailants.  It didn't look like a gun.  It was too thin and even to the Hero it was barely visible. It looked like a stick.
Did this change things?  Did he want to maintain this weird relationship of masks and lies?  Was Harry Potter worth it?
"I see.  Well, I can run a full diagnostic on Tufts and from there I can give you a regimen of spells or potions that can help counter the curse."
"How far back are you planning on digging, Boot?" Draco demands.  It has been over an hour and a sharp pain claws down his spine.  The ropes force him into uncomfortable positions, binding tighter if he shifts left, tighter if he slouches an inch.  A lesser form of crucifixion.  "I've told you everything I know about the Dark Lord.  I have nothing more to offer.  Now, either cut me lose, let me go, or kill me now, because your constant droning is a hell unto itself."
Draco thought about last night and his features softened. They had been out fairly late. He had enjoyed himself with Harry. Remus glanced at him curiously, lips glistening with fat, and Draco quickly schooled himself.
"I can feel her power, it's still there, locked away.  Tightly locked away, behind some wall...  Her magic is still in her."  A single tear traced down his smooth cheek.
"Stop." Remus looked over and saw Sirius standing there, his image flipping between the man and the dog. "You cannot hide, Moony."
Remus cleared his throat and offered Harry and Draco an apologetic shrug. "Sleep? I have to get some rest or I'm worthless to you two. I know we all went through shite in that maze and I, for one, need some recuperation. So, Harry, I'm going back to Hermione's and…"
sign in the actual movie that suggests they're vampires," Harry said with a wry grin.  "Maybe I'll notice it this time 'round."
Everything went soft, then thin, then it was all a world of static and noise.  He could still feel Snape's solid grip on his arm but he couldn't seem to move.  He was frozen in a hopeless lunge for Draco; Draco, who'd gotten left behind.
"Sure, whatever. Ready?" Harry should have known it wasn't going to be as easy as just asking for help.
Finally, the world grew more and more solid, clear.  It was still their valley, with the lake and the forest.  He saw the cabin, neat and whole and uncharred in any way.  There was no Rowle, no limp body bleeding from the head.  There were no heroes running from the forest and there wasn't any Draco waiting for him.  Draco was gone.
Before he could even act that familiar, overwhelming power tackled him. He bore down on that groping intrusion inside his soul, and dug his fingernails into his palm, focusing on the pain.
The instant contact caused Draco to growl in want.  Long fingers curled around Draco, gripping him with sure fierceness and tender grace.  Slow, steady strokes had him clinging to Harry, whimpering and murmuring and professing promises and forever.  And as Draco peaked and exploded, spilling white cream all over Harry's hand, he knew that even if he didn't have eternity, life would be perfect with Draco in his arms.
"And Merlin… hearing you moan like that.  Harry… you don't know how long… how long I've wanted to do that, to hold you, kiss you, to be with you."  This time Harry leaned forward and kissed Draco, and as the kisses grew in passion, Harry wondered why hadn't he thought to do this before?  Why hadn't his best friend ever come to mind when he realized it was love he wanted, it was promise and relationship… and eternity.
Draco turned to look at the tousled looking man, sleep lines still imbedded in his face. His eyes were wide. He looked so vulnerable. "Severus taught me how to brew all of his patented potions." Draco wanted to explain. He hadn't kept this knowledge to cause Remus pain… he just didn't know. And the fact that he actually cared did not go unnoticed. "He left everything of value to me including his research, library, dark arts collection, and home. Though the home left much to be desired," he added.
Slightly nervous he leaned over Severus' erection, heavy and proud and so full.  Severus tilted his hips, just slightly, but Harry got the hint.  With tenderness he rubbed first one cheek, then the other against the soft, silky skin.
And now that the snake had embarked on a long diatribe about the majority of wizards' lack of mental faculties, all Harry had to do was imagine deep tones, a dark voice slow and sensuous, and his body began to react.
"Yeah.  What?"   Then Harry smirked at Draco, followed by a leer for good measure.  Draco's mouth fell open the tiniest bit.
Draco took a deep breath.  "It is a modification of the blood, really.  I can't explain the scientifics or the magics of it, just that you use the blood and the change occurs.  All of my abilities are fueled by my blood."
Hermione was quiet again, and Harry wondered if she was still there or if she'd fallen asleep or wandered off or was just ignoring them, though he thought all of those options rather implausible. So he waited and finally she agreed to hear what they had to say. She was dually impressed they cracked her code, though Harry noticed she didn't point out that Draco already knew about it. The two men filled her in on the Quetzalcoatl Staff and what Popicon had told them. She was regaled with their exploits in Mexico, Sirius' return, and finally told what they found out from Kogelmann.
They'd finally hit the end of a long, tree-lined road.  Potter walked on like an Azkaban inmate ready for the Kiss.  After they'd left the den of Dark creatures, Draco had fully intended to get some answers, but Potter remained unresponsive.  Fifteen minutes of questions, Draco stopped asking; he was no nag.
"Draco," Harry cried breathlessly, gasping to form each word.  "Run.  Get away."  Panting, he tried to pull from Draco, but Draco held tight.  "Get.  Everyone.  Away."
He watched them a little while longer and since Ginny seemed to be enjoying herself, he decided not to play … what, jealous boyfriend?  Protective brother?  He better cool it or he might send mixed signals.
Draco knew he couldn't speak now, to break the sounds of rutting and loving would be taboo, and honestly his lips were quite occupied with other important duties as he rode out the twitches and jolts.  A bite of a shoulder, a lick along wet lips.  But he couldn't stop his brain, his thoughts, as he ran a hand along the line of Severus' spine, or felt the puff of air across his cheek from Harry's exertions.  He urged Harry, gripped him even as Severus ground into him from behind, the man's head thrown back, radiant with fucking bliss.  If he did open his mouth, Draco might say things dredged up from the bottom of his heart.  He might say,
Then he squatted behind his Princess and leaned over his back, pinning him to the floor.  Nuzzling his neck, he sank his teeth in, not enough to break the skin, but enough to bruise and show the world that Lily was his and nobody else better lay to claim what he owned.  Lily groaned at the bite and pressed up into him.  Draco ran his hand up Lily's side, feeling the muscles flex and tense, and then wove his fingers through that beautiful hair; he couldn't get enough of that hair. He gripped and pulled.
Opening his eyes, he looked over at Draco, who wiped at his brow with the back of his arm, leaving damp splotches on his sleeve. He glanced at Harry and smiled. "Thanks," he said as he took in deep breath after deep breath. "See," he said smiling brightly, "I told you we could do this together. Just keep feeding the wall that over-abundance of energy you have, and I'll keep up its integrity."
Harry gazed up at him, the stars and crescent moon reflected in those green eyes, so deep in the darkness of the evening. They held Draco's own, peering, searching for some knowledge or secret. Maybe for the truth or even a promise, Draco didn’t know. Then they darted down to Draco's lips and with the weight of inevitability, Draco leaned forward and kissed him.
Lily's words gave way to a constant groan, and he reached up to grab for his prick.  Draco pulled back and said, "No.  Do not touch yourself unless I say so."
"How the hell did you get in here, Malfoy?" he demanded, angry at the man that came sharply into sight.  With his wand pointed at the centre of Malfoy’s chest, he made a sterling attempt to make sense of it all.  "
"You are in St. Mungo's," Draco thought, and Harry looked at him. His eyes were still closed and his hand still held Harry's firmly.
Harry hitched Draco up more solidly against his side.  "Yes, sir," he said with as much strength as he could muster.  Draco nodded, holding out the wand.
For five days Harry stationed himself at Hermione's, just trying to make sense of the new information he'd received.  His first order of business though was to reset all of Hermione's wards to allow only him, Ron and Hermione through.  He hoped that with his expertise in this field of magic there would be no more unexpected visitors at the flat.
"Sirius!" Harry cried out. When Sirius was a ghost, that phantom being, Harry didn't really think of it as Sirius, just a diluted counterfeit, but now this laughing man, barking at some joke someone must have said, was real. "Sirius!"
Too bad Dregor was too valuable to just let go.  The man knew his antiques and his ledgers were immaculate.  Plus, he put up with stupid people far better than Draco ever could.
Unfortunately, that was not the only dirty limerick Draco knew, and he regaled them endlessly as the two men in the kitchen completed dinner.
And with that mind-set, one memory manifested and a small, scrawny boy walked towards Draco out of the scattered vortex. He was sad, Draco knew this, and he watched while the boy stared at his holey shoes as he took step by step towards him. The shoelaces flapped against the non-existent ground as each step was taken. Finally, the little boy stopped a few feet before him and lifted his head.
She shrugged.  "No idea; saw it on one of those animated Muggle films."  Then she broke out into a smile.  "Merlin's arse, Draco.  It's good to see you."
"I think so." Some of his earlier enthusiasm returned. "But I want to explain this to you first." Remus sat down next to Harry, looking over a parchment full of gibberish.
A small grey bird with a white tail fluttered in front of Harry's face; the man stared at it with a goofy look on his face.  He looked almost besotted, like a love-sick twelve-year-old who'd just seen Macy Maverick on stage for the first time, performing her patented hip thrust before the Weird Sisters began mocking it the following year.
A large weight landed on his side and he heard a slight 'huff' in his mind. No, not heard… just sensed. Knew. He flipped around and tackled Padfoot in response, gripping his throat between his strong jaws. The body below him went slack and submitted to his dominance. Satisfied, Remus (no, Moony) stood and ran, ran for the edge of the endless clouds, ran for joy and freedom, yipping for Padfoot to follow. He sensed the dog behind him, racing and full of life and the two sped across the fields of shadow.
However, Remus knew the truth. He could smell each pheromone spike as skin met skin, as touch was returned by touch, as if each man, as unalike as the opposite ends of a magnet, were drawn together by that same polarity.
"See!" Harry said, pointing at Gibbibuck.  "He probably stole Fritz.  This is probably the thief."  Harry seemed to be absorbing Gibbibuck aggression, because he kept shifting from one foot to the other, running his hand through his hair.  "Draco."  At Harry's pleading tone Draco's heart stalled, then beat hard.  He turned back to the reasonable goblin, if such a thing existed, to force his case.
Surprisingly strong, Potter's fingers dug hollows into Draco's arms.  Blood frozen, fear pounding in his chest, Draco thought longingly of warm fireplaces and easier times.  Remembered the days when he wasn't always afraid, wasn't always alone.
"Well, I'm not here to go dancing, Ginny."  Ginny was wearing a very flattering pleated skirt and low cut blouse with some African jewelry that accentuated her hairstyle and her cleavage.  She looked quite lovely; Harry could admit that even if it did little for his hormones.  He was wearing faded black jeans and an emerald green T-shirt.  The only attention he paid to his appearance was to spell his hair to behave, falling just right to hide his scars.
Movement down the road caught Draco's eye, and he resisted the urge to call out when he saw that it was Potter walking their way.  Romeo and Peking rose up off their haunches and barreled down the road, kicking up dust.
The eggs stared at him, scrambled and yellow and completely unappetizing.  He dumped his lunch in the trash bin, covering his breakfast and last night's dinner.
Suddenly Harry pulled back and studied Draco, who seemed alarmed at the swift retreat of those warm lips.  "What's wrong," he asked?
The soothing scent of roasting rosebuds and ground cinnamon deflated his inner beast.  Dim shadows shifted inside the black interior.
"What the fuck, Malfoy?  I thought you were here to buy a jumper, not toss me to the dogs of the Secondary Court.  Shite.  All I want is to be left alone.  It's not like my clothes are hurting anyone!"  Potter's voice had gone shrill, and Draco felt the sudden need for a headache potion as the dull throb the boarding house's lace and paisley had infested him with grew into the steady beat of hammer on anvil.
Harry didn't disagree, and now as he sat on the roof, enveloped in complete dark, he admitted his own frustration.  They had a few possibilities to check out, but which ones should they try first and was this really, truly something from Hermione's own hand?
—then, he wanted it done.  Plus, Fritz had been gone for ten days now, and he worried about the little construct.
In every Auror, there lies a Dark portion. In some it was just a tiny nugget, in others it threatened to consume his or her entire soul. It was impossible to remain entirely of the Light when you have to constantly dance with the Dark. That Dark within Harry suddenly coagulated and formed into a tight mass, growing and pulsing and swaying the young man to hurt and maim, to pull the answer out no matter what the consequences. This he would do. He would do this for his friends, for the innocents, for himself.
"I chose to stay here, Draco."  Her eyes have changed, her posture eased.  There's almost a smile on her lips as she catches something far away and stares at it, then tugs her focus back to Draco when he attempts to engage her in conversation. One of her teeth sparkles.
The lemur scampers through the door, crawls along a little net bridge spanning the roof of the galley, dangles by its tail and nabs an apple that has developed a patchwork of spots and then creeps away.  Nobody seems to notice.  Draco notices, he notices a bit of fur that shed from the animal onto the plate of yams, and pushes his plate away.
The Malfoy matron walked through the entrance in full-refined elegance.  Her gown sparkled with gold and silver threads and her wavy blond hair was pulled back into a classic French twist.  A spring of baby's breath adorned the style.
But the lack of warm body next to him did not perturb him or send him into a melancholy.  In fact, he welcomed the challenge and knew he would find his Princess.
Efficiently, Draco made them tea with a few wand flicks and some more of those odd kitchen utensils Harry'd only seen at the Weasley's. He sat on a high stool next to a central bar in the only modern room of Draco's home, complete with stainless steel and crockery hanging from the ceiling like a flock of bats. Draco sat next to him and the two sipped their tea in silence.
The brow's wrinkles tripled in size. "I'm sorry, I can't help you." Professor Arbormore stood and went to exit the room.
Draco caught Harry's eye and gave a quick nod towards the boughs of the trees swaying above them, his pale hair falling clear of his face as he tilted his head back.  "The Fae, Potter.  We're surrounded by the Fae."
"Good, it’s a bit too warm in here, if you ask me.  So, now onto more important questions.  How to deal with your needs, such as toilet facilities, food and water, rest.  You need to relay to me what you need."
His fingers wouldn't unravel from Draco's hair, so he gave up trying. Though he didn't hunger for blood, he couldn't stop devouring Draco's lips, his breath, tasting his skin between desperate gasps.
Harry knew that Ron and Hermione were joining with others around a huge cauldron. Their ritual was imperative. Thirteen witches and wizards were casting a magical net over the battlefield disallowing any escape of their enemy, either through Apparition or more importantly, displacement of the soul. His very essence would be trapped in the Net. Voldemort would never rise again.
"Thank you."  Snape handed him a knife and the lettuce and Harry began chopping.  More vegetables were piled before him: tomatoes, an onion, a green pepper, and some celery.
"Would you be quiet?  Common sense, Potter!" he snarled, dragging Harry behind a wall of novelty bulbs in the shapes of retro shoes, animals, cartoon characters and other stupidly inane things.  "You do have some, don't you?"
"Oh, it is going very well," Remus nodded. He enjoyed running and owning Spellworks and Magicpots with Draco and Harry. The arrangement worked well for them all.
Draco easily dodged the ball—Harry couldn't throw worth crap—and laughed at his friend.  "Ready?" he asked.
"Good afternoon, Barlow.  Could you get these things back to my quarters for me?"  Harry hands the sailor their purchases, and the man nods and runs off.
"Harry!  Severus!"  The mirage ran towards them.  "I can see you!  Can you see me?  I'm right here!"  The transparent form of Draco reached out to them.  His hair was a little longer and he seemed careworn.  But it was Draco, and a sob escaped Harry's lips as he reached out, only to pass right through his extended hand.
Draco's mind was flipping through one seduction technique to the next as they walked quietly back to Potter's cottage.  Should he be tender and cover him in kisses, or maybe forceful and press him up against the door the minute they walk in?  Every scenario caused his cock to tremble in anticipation, and he decided that this was too important, that he didn't want to lose this, and maybe he should just let Potter direct the play.
"Potter, what would you do without me?"  Draco asked in his most put-upon tone, putting the phone away.
"What? How is this possible?!" one red-faced witch exclaimed, her cheeks rosy. She vaguely reminded Draco of their old Herbology professor, all ratty and cheerful.
Nothing was clear. His senses, all muddled and distorted beyond comprehension, left him feeling possessed by chaos. The air was thick, not only opaque but also full and heavy, making him desperate for clear air. A deep buzz blocked out all other sound and caused his insides to tremble at the tone. And the smell, so alien he forced himself to inhale through his mouth where he only tasted the retched miasma. His every cell ached with a pressure, like he was about to explode.
"Tomorrow's the day," Harry said.  Though it had begun to get chilly, he was naked where he rested next to Severus.  He'd come to realize how safe Severus made him feel.  How at home.  When had Severus become the world to Harry?  It was a mystery: a silent, undefiable mystery.  In the last year, his life had completely changed, changed from anything he could have ever imagined, and he had no clue on Merlin's magical earth how it'd happened.
Rising at dawn, he went out to his rock and studied the water.  It was placid this early, before the heat from the sun stirred it.  He could see the sharp flashes of fish as they turned and darted amidst the submerged lake weed.
Harry had only ever talked about his final battle once, with Ron and Hermione after he awoke in the combat infirmary set up on the battlefield. His telling was full of holes and both of his friends knew better than to push. Remus had nobody to tell the specifics to, keeping his sorrow at a boiling point for years. And Draco feared to tell anyone. Some knew of his role, such as Kingsley, but nobody knew of his horror. And as each man shared that which had never seen the light of day, something broke in them. Something different for each.
A pulse of heat and light and magic began to surge off Harry in waves.  With skin almost the same green as his terrible polyester suit, Harry looked ready to vomit over everything.  Then the magic began crawling over Draco's skin, digging into his pores, pressing into his eyeballs and with a frantic urge to conserve himself, Draco pushed hard on Harry, sending him stumbling away into a pile of peat pellets that rained down but never even touched his body, instead glancing off the tangible aura around him.
Remus hated that she was in danger. Ever since they had come together he felt an overwhelming sense of protection over her. But his logical side realised they needed every able fighter, and Tonks was more than adequate at her job, if a little clumsy at times. But every time she got wounded his stomach churned; every time she went out on a dangerous mission, he only wanted to scream.
He continued to observe from a corner, pushing away the niggling impulse to leave and run to his jewel.  So many people on this festive night, celebrating Christmas, celebrating being
Soft growls filled the air, and Severus smiled.  Just faintly, but he smiled, and Harry leaned forward to capture it all with a kiss.
Draco jumped to his feet.  "I'm obviously a hero.  A super hero!  I can leap from rooftop to rooftop, and I patrol for evildoers on the streets.  I descend upon them in their acts of treachery to instill in them a healthy fear of the night!"
"No, but I have little to go on.  It will take time, Harry.  This isn't a brainteaser; it's a bloody enigma."
"Yeah?" asked the green fairy.  "I know just the thing.  Let's do to him what we did to the slaveman."
He raises his wand.  Draco follows the snap of the tip and feels the ropes around his wrists release.  "I made it myself," Harry says, pushing the mug through the little slit at the bottom of the door.  It doesn't quite fit, so Harry has to tilt it over; some of the black tea spills out and seeps into the cracks between the planks of the cell.  Harry says the words like they mean something significant.  Draco just watches him.
"He found out Ginny was dating a woman and now he's all excited he has a lesbian in the family, like he's trendy now or something," Hermione said with her perfected eye roll. "It isn't like you don't already have a gay best friend, and she's really bisexual. Oh, Remus, do you think I could get some unicorn blood from you." She batted her eyelashes at Remus, which only made him laugh more.
Harry seemed to know the way around the busy area and they soon stood before a small, yet clean, restaurant boasting a taste for world cuisine. There were a few wrought iron tables and chairs cluttered around the front door with plastic umbrellas striped white and green, shading them from the sun. A rich, enticing smell permeated the air of which Draco instantly approved.
the chess set and pieces, which all flew into the room and organized themselves primly in regimental rows on the table next to Potter's bed.
"That's it!" Ron finally said. He placed his shoulder against the door, leaned away from it, and came in hard, cracking the frame.
Their conversation stopped and Harry felt Draco breathing, slow and steady and thought he must have fallen asleep.  He wondered again how much time had passed.
"I just got an owl from Romania.  One of the female dragons at the preserve started showing signs of nesting.  I've been called back tomorrow, but I wanted to know if you wanted to return with me and Tad."
"It is… going to take some time," Severus admitted.  He picked up his spoon to dip into the potato soup.  A thin layer of melted cheese covered the top.
"Don't talk to it, Potter!" Draco scolded.  "If you talk to them, they'll just trick you into doing something you'll regret."
Draco leaned forward and inhaled, taking in the scent of this man under him, his musk and arousal stabbing hunger through Draco's nerves.  As he ran his cheek against Lily's arse, he heard Lily's breath catch, and he trembled under Draco's touch.  Slowly, with all the patience, but none of the intent, of a saint, Draco flicked his tongue across that tight hole.
"Well, I muffled the magical signature so it wouldn't register as magical anymore," Potter mumbled.  He stopped dropping kisses and looked up at Draco.  "Now, nobody will know."  He offered up his shy grin, but Draco wasn't about to let Potter off that easily.
"Are you listening to me, Schooner?  Are you paying attention to my words, because I hate repeating myself?  I hate it when I'm not listened to.  You will take off this curse.  I will give you your wand, and you will take the curse off Potter.  Now, if you try to do anything else, trust me when I tell you my soul already carries the taint of Dark magic and what's another curse when weighed against the power of the Dark Lord's will."
"Oh really, I can't be arsed to care.  That was too good to worry about Mr. Starched Pants out there."  He giggled, and Harry's jaw dropped at the audacity.  Action Number 25 on how to make Draco smile: Mocking Snape.
Standing there in the gardening section, dressed in a neon green running suit, Harry Potter was facing a display, reaching out to touch something.  As Draco stepped closer, his boots thumping on the tiles, he saw that Harry had something white and round by his side.
Something registered in the back of his brain as he continued to moan and beg and plead.  The pressure on his cock disappeared but then it was replaced by a new pressure, an enveloping grip.  "Yes, please!  Draco, God… more."  A slow glide of skin on skin.  A sharp movement, pulling and kneading.  A hard constriction sliding up and down his shaft, gaining a smooth rhythm.
Draco sat up at that.  "What?  After that jealous pout you went through?"  He gave Harry a long look that called him out on the table.
"Do you know anything more about this ball?" Harry asked, showing no sense of the urgency Draco knew he must be feeling.
had been expecting me to be all along.  I had to get away from all that pressure to figure out who it is I am."  Then he laughed.  "It sounds so damned touchy-feely doesn't it?"  Finally his hand won the battle and it ran through his hair, mussing it into fetching disarray.
The room smelled clean, except for the rank sweat sliding down his backbone, and it was warm. Comforting even. His eyes closed again and he drifted off.
Draco stood and waved goodbye has he retreated from Harry's mind, passing through the unformed memories and thoughts and finally finding himself in his own body once again.
"I wouldn't have invited you if you were a distraction."  He locked eyes with Remus and a pink glow suffused the other man's cheeks.  He chuckled to himself.  "Well, shall we?" he asked as he walked past Draco.
"You two certainly squawk like a pair of guineafowl in the morning.  If I'd known that, I would have kicked you straight out of bed."
Harry threw a squeaky chew toy at Ron's head, which he easily ducked.  Working at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes really toned those reflexes.
Draco nodded in encouragement.  He was offered everything and anything; he certainly could answer one request.
"So," Draco said, pulling Harry's attention away from the bird as it flittered from branch to branch, gleaning bugs out from under the scales of the bark.  "You say that snake in your pants can turn back into human form anytime it wishes."  At Harry's shocked look, Draco smirked.  Things continued to flow out of his mouth, and sometimes he found it easier to hold in the really embarrassing things if he let a few of the more inconsequential comments escape.  But the reactions he got from Harry were interesting.
"Merlin's balls, I can't do this."  Harry began to struggle against his restraints, thrashing in panic.
at the touch, and Harry felt drawn to run his tongue along the outer edge of Snape's ear.  He discovered the man had a thing for ear bites.  Snape grunted in anticipation as his rocking sped up.
Dryly, Draco explains, "You do realize that everyone here calls her Loony."  Pansy's eyes flash at him, and Luna laughs, a high giggle of someone much younger.
Schooner?  Draco recognized the name, but it'd been so long since he'd had anything to do with the Dark side of wizarding society, that those memories were locked away in a rusty box, moldering away.  He had, however, kept accurate and secluded files he could review if it seemed like it would be needed in curing Potter.
Her eyes zone in and out of focus, and she finally looks at Harry.  "Yes, Captain."  Behind him is Pansy, one hand fluttering before her mouth, her face pale, pale like the belly of a ray, a lift to her brows giving her a hound dog expression of fear, worry, shifting to horror like she's pulling on a new layer of skin.  Or shedding one.
Finally, pressed by emotions and desperation, by an innate understanding as a father, Draco approached the sad departure and squatted next to the three.
"Yes, it was," Draco agreed, nuzzling along Harry's neck.  He breathed in deep and smelled Harry's sweat and his own saliva mixed with the bitter scent of their semen.  Musky undertones that shot right to his center.
Harry's head shot up to look at Snape.  "What the hell?" Harry said, his voice loud enough to startle the silver dragonflies, which took to the air in a cloud.
"Draco, don't squeeze so hard," Harry said.  The little fairy's piercing scream had summoned Harry to Draco's side.  "Don't hurt him."
A peanut sailed in a high arc through the air and landed in Ron's gaping mouth.  With a grin, he smacked loudly on it, plucking another nut from a small cache in the palm of his hand.  The half-full Planter's jar sat on the desk between them next to a small stack of papers and Harry's propped up feet.
"Remember, Malfoy.  Don't do anything heroic.  Just reconnaissance.  The last thing I need is for a civilian to get injured working in the field for us.  Got it?" he said and Draco nodded, turning to leave.
Draco remained in the front of the shop watching her go, and then looked down at his rowan wand.  It had been an adequate wand, but it never worked for him the way his old hawthorn had, the one that Potter had taken from him.  He'd decided months ago when he first considered leaving his seclusion, that his first act would be to get a new wand.
The mention of the loom lit a spark within his old rival.  His hands fluttered about as he spoke, the long fingers twitching and dancing with his words; he couldn't seem to stop the grin from consuming his face.  The dimples remained.  He hadn't been aware that Potter's teeth were so straight.
why he was considering letting Harry sleep in his bed with him.  He didn't want to take advantage of Harry, but having a warm body, if just lying next to him, seemed considerably less secluded and right now he was feeling terribly forlorn, too.
"He's never been in Animagus form this long," she explained and Draco nodded.  He understood.  When wizards or witches were in the form of their animal shape for too long, their minds and actions began to show more and more of the animal's natural tendencies.
But here he was. Trudging under the Mexican sun, hot even in February, looking for some vague address that he had been certain he'd found twice, but later realised he stood on the wrong avenue or street or whatever these damned people called their roads.
Latin flowed from Apis' lips with all the power of lava and fire. The witch's voice burned, echoed through the building, and Harry suppressed an instinct to smash his hands over his ears to drown out the deep reverberations. A few others didn't. Remus flinched at the edge of Harry's peripheral vision. Sirius stood stoic, unmoving, eyes only on the artefact awaiting its destruction.
The bottle of albatross blood sat just out of reach at the edge of his assembled ingredients.  He moved for it, but before he could step around the table, another hand gripped the bottle and handed it to Severus.  Severus took the bottle.
Draco stepped close, his chest to Harry's back, and he tilted his head to rest his cheek on Harry's shoulder.  He stared at the door, just leaning against Harry, drawing support that he willingly gave.
It takes some time before Draco realizes he hasn't interpreted any of the rise and fall of lips as words and has only noticed the pinkness, the chapped scabbing, the joining and parting of motion.
Laura takes to her feet, leaning towards Draco, both hands braced against the table.  "We weren't the only ones there.  The Death Eaters were hitting the place, that was why we even showed up.  We weren't there for the Brevediers or your mother.  We knew the Death Eaters would be there!"
"Good boy," Rowle said with a smile.  "I might just come by tonight then.  How 'bout that?" and he turned his back on them.  The door closed, the rusty metal ringing through the silence, and he walked away.
"Remus, how're you with Arithmancy?"  He placed the book, and a few others he picked up, down on the counter, and Remus counted up his purchases.
"No!" came another cry, this one slurred and swimming in spit. "Not the orb. My Staff!" But then the cries were lost under a bubble of a sigh and the room settled once again into silence.
After a couple of days on rations of nuts and twigs, Draco was ready for the piles of sweets and breads.  There were pies and hearty soups made from root vegetables.  Potato pies and biscuits.  Draco noted there was no meat on the menu, but he didn't mind because his goblet overflowed with Fae wine, and though the mortal man was always warned against partaking in a Fairy Feast, Draco threw caution to the side and enjoyed himself to his fullest potential.
"Lots of 'em. But they all got it back. Though if rumor's right," Duncan looked nervous, "it ain't come back full."
"Yeah.  Yeah, I am.  Thank you."  Harry leaned into Draco, gripping him in relief.  He hated blokes like that.  A shiver shook his body, and Draco squeezed him.
Draco blinked his eyes open.  The sky above was chalky and stagnant, like a canvas backdrop painted in time.  Never changing.  There were clouds, soft things that held no threat, only depth; no wind urged them along.  Something about the slant of the early light or maybe the stillness carried his spirit.  He felt that on the edge of his hearing, if he really focused, he could hear music and he was lost in it.
Due to potential leaks, Ron wanted to keep their involvement a secret, see if the Dark Artefact peddler was being tipped off by someone on his team or if they had some other means to know they were being watched.
"Well, I'm sure if you did have any business with the Assistant Minister, you could find him in his office.  After hours his secretary is gone, and he always forgets to ward his door."  Draco's eyes grew wide, staring at her as she spoke the words so nonchalantly.  "Of course, I will be up soon myself to talk to him about the ceremony.  In about a half-hour.  Have a nice day, Malfoy," she said and walked back towards the crowd, her sensible heels clicking on the floor.
"Severus," Harry began, then paused fumbling for the words he wanted to use.  "What's going on out there?"
Draco's sudden realization, the unbalancing of his world view, keeps him ensconced in his tiny room under the pretenses that he has a stomach ache.
Food.  Real food, not the travel rations Snape had fed them yesterday, nor the putrid mess they'd been eating in their captivity.  Harry walked to the table, intending to sit, but he noticed Draco hadn't moved.
Draco had no chance.  He knew it.  But that didn’t mean these mind games didn't offer some warmth to his cold, lonely nights or that he would stop constantly tearing his heart out with false hopes and wishful thinking.  The glory that was his existence.
He hears a mumble percolate from the left. "If magical people are so cherished, why is the government shunting them off?"  A hushed silence surrounds the area of the speaker, but nobody looks up to claim the statement.  It was said quietly enough that Draco ignores it.  There is too much truth and damnation in the question.
It was an ordeal to extricate Draco from Harry.  Together, Snape and Harry had to peel away each finger where it'd bonded with Harry's shirt.  Then Snape swaddled him up in a quilt, thick and heavy and the two led him through the bedroom door to the couch, his head hung low.
They would snatch moments in bed, before sleep and after waking; they would steal moments behind Snape's back.  They would seize precious, precious moments.  Draco smiled more; Harry felt light inside, the huge weight of the past having eased its mighty hold.  Facts such as Draco was a boy or that Harry still didn't get an erection were all inconsequential; they didn't matter in their cloistered little world.  They both talked to Snape incessantly, asking him about life, his past, even potions.  The man seemed willing and almost eager to share words with them.  However, since that day he and Snape had talked alone outside, Harry avoided questioning what had been going on out there.  He liked watching Draco smile, and he knew Draco wasn't ready.  Finally, the young man was looking forward to the future instead of being trapped in the past.  It was delicate, this life they led.
"While you and Draco were enjoying a casual romp in the sack," he cocked an eyebrow, and Harry thought he saw something other than Snape's usual stern amusement there, "I received a missive."
Draco's heart stops, then beats a heavy thump.  Maybe… Maybe Harry is stunned.  Maybe he's just dazed.
Another busy Saturday night at Garish's and the mad collection of Hogwarts graduates and war veterans were gathered around their usual table.  Hermione held a glass of ginger beer, an unusual occasion for her, but Ron had accumulated a herd of empty lager glasses on his end of the table, obviously making up for Hermione's lack of consumption.
Pansy is standing behind Luna, breasts heaving with her wand arm hanging heavy at her side, eyes wide.
He walked around the block and soon arrived at the back of the bar. Duncan stood to one side, a hat pulled low over his forehead. "Let's go," Remus said, and they walked down the alley, dodging overturned trashcans and piles of rubbish. There was an overpowering scent of piss in the air.
.  And as was typical for the Potions Master, brewing was his form of relaxation.  Not torture.  Not killing.  Not playing with his
"Harry!" Teddy jumped to his feet and pulled Harry down from the chair.  Everyone in the restaurant was watching them with suspicious interest.  The waitress took a tentative step towards them, but Teddy waved her off as he hustled Harry towards the street.  Luna and Neville were right behind them.
"She talked and now she's dead. I ain't talkin' no more." His accent deepened as the man's dread strengthened.
It was unnerving, how unlike Harry the man now was.  When Luna had questioned him, every time he tried to talk about the Minister or how he ended up in the institution, Harry'd start to choke and shake, and Teddy had worried he would bite off his tongue.
"Well, obviously you got bitten," Harry stated, and Draco was annoyed to hear that the man didn't sound very sympathetic.
"Merlin, Potter.  Control yourself.  You.  Are.  A.  Cat.  Doesn't do much for me."  And it was true, though he certainly had harbored his own fantasies of Potter, flashes from his dissident brain after school and even in the early years of his marriage.  One of those many 'irreconcilable' differences.
Slowly, he reached into the pocket near his right hip and pulled out a yellow ball. He held it out by the tips of his fingers and turned it around so the three men could see a black smiley face printed on the side.
Fortunately, it hadn't taken Draco long to admit the words of the old wizard had been impelling, nesting in his mind, sleeping like a viper just waiting to strike once Draco's mind finally cleared.
"It's okay."  Everyone stares at Draco Malfoy, whose face is impassive, eyes studiously sticking to his own plate of something Hungarian and full of mushrooms.  "Eat it with your fingers if you want to eat it with your fingers."  His voice is hard, but supportive in an offhanded way that is completely feigned.  Luna smiles around her own spoonful of pie.
"We have it in stasis.  You've sustained incredible damage, Harry.  Severus has been continually brewing potions that adjust to the level of your injury.  He thinks you will have complete use of your arm again once it's healed, but right now we don't want to risk it.  You are to stay here, in this bed, until it's healed," Remus said sternly.
"I didn't know," he calls out across the open deck.  "I didn't know you weren't killing everyone.  I…" he swallows again.  "I believed what they told me, what the Ministry told me."  Harry's shoulders relax and a hint of pleasure crosses his face.  "I'm sorry."  The words just flow out of Draco, and he doesn't care.  "I'm sorry I thought you a monster.  I'm sorry."
Harry dropped his eyes to the table, his features softening. "I know you didn't. It's just hard…" Harry sat silently for a few moments. Draco began to wonder if he was going to continue, but then Harry spoke again. "Anyway, then you found her in your alley, and she now lies in a bed at St. Mungo's while the curse continues to spread."
Draco crossed the room and laced his pale fingers through Harry's black hair.  Light and Dark.  Yin and Yang.  And—Draco used to think—Good and Evil.  Though Draco had never been Evil, he’d just lived by his own set of rules.  Not only was he a pureblood and a Slytherin, he was also a vampire and things just didn't measure up the same when you could live into eternity.
His marriage was over and his son was with his ex-wife.  And though his job was fulfilling, it was still a reminder of his failings.
"Well, let's go there… we at least need to say good-bye to the place. I'd practically been living there myself," Remus said. Harry nodded, but continued to watch Draco. He couldn't take his eyes away as they walked towards the Floo centre.
Apis began to chant, and as the sanctuary of peace the two men had conjured faded, they dropped their hands and turned to face the stone box.
"Ginny, don't go.  Really… Hermione would want you here.  I want you here.  I'm sure your mum wants you back for as long as you can stay…" he trailed off, not sure what else to say.  He wanted to scream and yell, not at her, but at their situation.  He knew Ginny still cared for him when she left, but he had thought after all these years a childhood crush would have faded under the weight of true experience.
He sounded defeated, not angry, not betrayed, just wounded, like he'd lost the big game when he was certain he had it in the bag. "I thought…" he began, but apparently couldn't finish. Then he buried his face in his hands, his shaggy hair hiding him from the judgmental gaze of the world.
The white poinsettias, the garland, and fairies.  The grand staircase.  A gnome, dressed like Santa, changed his pose near a fir.
With the sound of the door opening, he quickly returned the flask and appeared attentive as a small mob of red-robed Aurors walked in.
"Oh, I hate that label… It makes it sound like it's just sex."  An owl hooted nearby.  "I loved Richy.  I would have married him, given a few more years and legality."  Potter stopped talking.  "He was a painter, and he loved the sea—and...and it swallowed him whole."
"Yep, pretty much."  A gaggle of witches and wizards in their trendiest wizard and Muggle wear stood outside of the club, waiting to get in.  Some stood sans warm outerwear, which Harry thought was ridiculous because it was early January.  Not the warmest time of the year for England in the least.  Lucky for them it wasn't raining.
Harry lifted his hands to his face, examining them with utter curiosity like he'd just discovered something rare and alien.  "My skin," he said, "it covers me from head to toe," then he lifted up his finger and poked himself in his ear, "except for just a few holes.  Isn't that amazing?  How did this happen?"  Draco looked at Pansy, who looked at Harry with open incredulity.
"Breaking out the hard stuff?" Harry asked, standing to prepare himself for the onslaught of questions and handshakes.
All three looked up to see the fairy from a couple days ago, the one with the oak leaves and gossamer skirt.  He did a little bow at them as he hung in the air like a spider on its silk.
They struggled, rolling over the thick grass, but Harry had always been frightfully wiry and had ended up straddling his opponent.  He curled his fingers into a fist and began pounding in the Death Eater's face.  He punched him for his dead parents, he punched him for Voldemort, he punched him for every fucking rape he'd endured, and he now punched him for every time his heart stopped beating in fear and as he continued to bloody the man's face, breaking delicate facial bones, his tears fell freely and he screamed in frustration.
It was one of those days Greyback had insisted on his 'girly boy', and it took Harry forever to get Draco to come back out of his shell and talk to him again.
"What exactly do you mean?" Draco asked.  "Severus, you've always been a man to make your own choices."
Draco sat stock still as Harry clutched onto Mrs. Weasley's hands, laughing his thanks even as the tears fell down his cheeks.
"Don't look at me, I'm not a house-elf," Draco said, watching the two men preparing dinner.  A large pot sat over a coil burner on the stove, and Snape was adding meat and spices to it.  Looked like stew and salad tonight.  Harry's stomach rumbled; all food was good food and their shrunken bodies were filling out with each meal.
"Do you know if a witch was there, large witch with thick, black hair… Bulstrode. Millicent Bulstrode?"
"Shit!" Draco ground the word out from between his clenched teeth.  Quick as a snake, he peeked around the corner to the front of their cottage.
Draco sizes her up.  "And Harry Potter swooped down, saving them from utter destruction, and now has your undying loyalty."  He can hear a bell clanging from somewhere in the larger cavern, the sound somehow swelling with each ring.
"Ron!"  Harry knelt by the foot of the Floo.  "Ron!" he called again.  Finally, dressed in a yellow dressing gown covered in flapping books, Ron popped his head and shoulders into the Floo.
But unlike his father, Draco recognized a losing battle when he saw one.  Knew that while purebloods were superior, indiscriminate slaughter wasn't the way to prove it, and being led by a half-blood only made it all the more ludicrous.
"Yeah, the Mark's stopped burning," Draco added. He rolled up his sleeve and gently touched the swollen Mark, dark and angry looking.
The two men, nude with their hope bared and open, faced each other, each lifting a jug.  Severus dipped his first two fingers into his jug of potion and set the jug down on the tub edge; Harry followed suit.  The potion was thick and gooey and stuck to Harry's fingers like the slime from a pulverized slug.  Then he thought of Draco and ignored the sensation as Severus anointed his forehead and palms with the substance.
Soft words from behind him pulled him out of his reverie. "I didn't know you could brew it." It was Harry. Harry had heard the entire thing, and Draco squirmed under that knowledge.
"Technically," Remus said, facing Draco and Harry, "he isn't dead, but he isn't alive. Or at least, that's what he says." Remus jabbed his thumb over his shoulder indicating Sirius standing behind him. "Plus, he said he has a hold on the staff right now."
"We have to…" Draco said breathlessly, gesturing towards the hallway they had just come from, wishing it would just disappear and the two wizards would find themselves back home, surrounded by friends, safe from sentient pieces of wood and crazy dungeon builders.
"Malfoy, I thought you said you could decipher Hermione's code.  Why can you only decipher these?"  He flipped through the documents, trying to see how the code from one pile seemed any different from those on the pages of the other pile.
The neon blue sign was becoming a familiar sight for Harry and he wasn't sure if he liked that. He hoped to God that Aiden wouldn't be here, he didn't need to deal with that man right now, that very sexy man. Harry shook his head to flee those thoughts.
"And no more drinking!" the Chief Auror said as he took the glass from Ron’s hand and went to stand by the Minister’s side at the podium.  Harry heard Kingsley chuckle and would have laughed too if he wasn't already apprehensive about the Minister's handshake.
Remus looked deeply into the murky liquid in his cup.  "Anyway," he shook his head as if trying to deny certain memories, "we're sure we found a way to kill him with this potion.  It connects to each portion of Voldemort out there… not just his soul, but his essence, and completely obliterates it.  Gone.  Voldemort, Horcruxes and…anyone with the Dark Mark."
"Damn song is affecting my sound amplifier. I have to drop it." Harry dropped the spell, not willing to risk bursting the fine bones in his ear canal.
But the most tangible portion of the dream that stuck with him in the rising light was one word. Mexico. Sirius had told him to go to Mexico. Padfoot did not actually speak; the word just appeared within his thoughts, injected with hypodermic ease.
"Oh, come here."  Christine grabbed his wrist and pulled him to the precipice and as he looked over the edge all he saw was open space.  "Have you ever just wanted to jump?" she asked again.
Draco muttered something completely incoherent.  Harry leaned forward and perked his ears.  "I couldn't hear you."
"We need help," she said.  "I'm not a Healer, and he obviously has more things to tell us."  Strangely, Luna's calm attitude wasn't annoying Teddy; he simply took strength from it.
He stuffed his hands in his pockets, thinking about that look on Snape's face as he kicked stones and walked around the house.  For some reason it made Harry feel strange to see the lack of a sneer on Snape's face, the compassion in his eyes.  To know that he cared.  He thought back to those memories of his, memories of his mother, and he knew Snape could love.  A loving Snape was still just so foreign, like a belly-dancing Hagrid or McGonagall in a two-piece.
"It's just that… What you said…" Harry gripped at his sides as he slid to the floor laughing.  The monster quickly popped away.  Phase One: Get Draco's Attention.  Complete.
"Not today," he said with a sorry shake to his head.  "There is this one criminal I've been working on, but he refuses to cooperate.  I'm certain he's doing the crime he's charged of, but I've no tangible proof yet."
Apparently Remus had made his decision and Harry couldn't be happier. He only wished them as much time as possible, not dwelling on when this miracle might end.
"You have no business here, wizard," the goblin guard said.  "Under Article 13 of the Wizard Goblin Treaty of 1203, Goblins have full authority over themselves and are not under any jurisdiction of the Aurors."  The goblin grimaced once he'd finished, or maybe it was some kind of a smile.  Draco always had hated dealing with these creatures.
"Bloody hell, Potter!"  Draco.  He was Draco Malfoy.  Why was he laying on Harry Potter?  His blood thickened in his veins, and he scampered away.
"Draco?" came the soft call from behind him. Yes, he realised, he'd jumped between Harry and this man who looked like Black liked a damned hero. Like a Gryffindor. Repentance was certainly due.
They watched each other, their eyes meeting in the reflective surface.  Harry smiled.  It wasn't huge and it wasn't full of humor, but it was meant to reassure and in response Draco's lips twitched in a miniscule smile as well.
As usual, Draco ate dinner at the pub, and Margie greeted him like he'd been patronizing the Sheep's Head for years.  "Draco!" she called over the music, already pulling his pilsner.  People didn't stare at him anymore.
Draco cleared his throat, drawing Harry's attention. He exchanged a look with Harry then with the people around the table.
Hermione really was the brightest witch of her age, and with the help of the book and some further information from Professor Slughorn, a long and complicated ritual was prepared that would destroy the Horcrux residing within Harry's scar without, hopefully, destroying Harry.
Remus watched Harry work his charm on the older man.  It was obvious Savage looked up to Harry in some way, or at least valued his opinion.  Wilkes, on the other hand, was barely concealing open hostility.  The air reeked, almost causing Remus to sway under the swath of venomous fumes emanating off the Auror.  He often valued his ability to sense emotions, his wolf's power of smelling pheromones, but right now he wished his nose was blind.
"Why?  You took away Sally.  I think you owe me."  Harry stood a hands-breadth away, and Draco could feel his warm breath puff across tense skin, could smell the scent of strawberry jam.
"What is going on?" Ron asked as he jogged up to the four men. "We heard an explosion and… Is that Remus?" he asked.
Everything glowed on Harry's face, as bright and sudden as a Muggle fireworks display, like he'd found his lost puppy who'd been missing for days.  "I'm happy," he said, then stood up and walked out of the room, leaving Draco behind to ponder a few things.
Then he was distracted from his encroaching melancholy by a lick across his neck.  It sent goose bumps across his arms, those fangs close to his face.
They crossed through the door and walked straight into the Potions classroom.  Where Hermione and Snape were doing unmentionable things, with Peeves overlooking the entire scene.
No trace of the fear Draco thought he'd seen remained on the boy's face, for he smiled such a beautiful smile it burned away everything but hope and joy and love. Draco relaxed at his unexpected declaration and briefly hugged the boy again then gently let him go.
"By Earth and Water, Fire and Air, you are released.  Return to your origin.  Return to your heart."
For the first time in his entire life, Remus wasn't racked with agony the morning after, didn't feel like someone had ripped him apart and reformed him with bits and pieces missing, left behind by a careless Frankenstein. Well, perhaps not his entire life, but definitely it'd been long enough that he praised the Wolfsbane with repeated mumbles. He still returned to the castle in Scotland for the transformation, locking himself in the dungeon behind lifeless iron and potent wards, obscuring the outside world to cut off the wolf's desire to run and be free. But this time the wolf didn't have any desire. His animal side, his monster, didn't struggle, didn't fight for dominance. He just lay down inside of Remus with casual submission, gave up his body and let Remus run the show. It was astounding.
And then an overwhelming surge of sorrow and loss and unfulfilled desire practically knocked Draco to the floor.
"I didn't do anything in the church, did I?" Harry asked, wondering if he'd blacked out under the orb's power. Draco slowly lowered his eyelids and shook his head. Then two and two immediately summed up to his interrogation of Riley. "It's about Riley, then?"
Ron looked at Harry with a haunted expression. "Harry, let me go." His words so soft Harry had to interpret lip motions once more. Draco and Remus stood nearby, wands at the ready, carefully guarding the open door. Plincher watched on, his attention split between Harry and Ron.
He waited for fifteen minutes, stewing with indignation, before he finally saw the far too amused face of his lunch appointment.  He had arrived late himself and was terribly annoyed that Harry had kept him waiting even longer.
"Tufts… Potter.  Listen to me."  The cat glared at him.  "Your wife," an odd flash of emotion, "is a competent witch.  I saw her fighting in the Battle at Hogwarts.  She can protect your daughter and herself.  They will be fine.  Plus you have that red-headed menace of a best friend and the entire Auror Division, which I am sure will all be watching over your family even if they are up to their noses in cases.  Don't worry.  We will find Schooner, get you cured, and you can go back to your carefree, perfect life."  He didn't know why he was suddenly angry with Potter.  Sometimes, in brief glimpses, he would see his life for what it really, was and he was shocked to realize he didn't recognize any of it.
"Harry?" Hermione probed.  Harry jerked, his mind had traveled elsewhere, and he'd forgotten where he was, that Hermione stood next to him outside of the wizarding school.
It reminded him of the slumming runs he and Blaise used to enjoy after the war, when they'd first left Hogwarts five years ago.  He'd still been on probation then.  They'd dress up in Muggle clothing and attempt to integrate themselves with the hoi polloi.  It had been all the rage for purebloods to pretend they were interested in and enjoyed the Muggles back then.
What did he want?  He had run for so long, done what he was told even longer, that he hadn't considered what it was he really wanted.  He wanted his place in wizarding society back.  He wanted his family whole again, not dead and scattered.  He wanted to forget some of his mistakes, or at least be forgiven of them.  But Draco would let none of this sentimental drivel materialize.  "A life for a life, Potter.  I help you with Granger and you owe me a Life Debt."
As a young boy Harry'd never traveled, never gone to the park with his father and mother and played.  He'd dodged bullies and hidden away from violence and neglect.  He kept his tears silent while locked away in a tiny cupboard like something broken or out of season.  Dumbledore had assured the skills to survive would be ingrained into his very soul.
Rowle pulled up his trousers and grabbed Harry by the hair with his stubby fingers, dragging him to the eight by eight cell that he and Draco had shared for a week.  Harry tried to get his feet under him, but Rowle kept tugging, forcing Harry off balance, and he just gave up and reached out to brace himself as he was tossed inside.
"Elbow, elbow, wrist, wrist, wrist," Harry said, mocking the parade wave.  This time, Remus laughed, too.
"Ah, young Malfoy," says the Dark Lord, not taking his eyes from Harry.  "I see you've given up your pacifism to betray me and your father."
Potter smiled, and Draco noticed he had dimples, though not deep; they were the kind that only popped out in a truly honest grin.
The four men stood clustered in the stone-lined basement of Grimmauld Place; Severus and Draco in long, muslin robes, Severus with a curiously blank look on his face while Draco sported one of excitement and anticipation.  Remus was rubbing salve all over the pair of Dark Marks tattooed to their souls, slathering on the thick, waxy substance as liberally as gravity allowed.  Harry stood in the center of an ash-lined circle, decorated with runes and other symbols that designated his intention, protected the participants and contained the magic within.  In his hands he held a small, clay pot.
Harry felt like he'd just spied on some private moment and had annoyed the older man.  He'd thought they were all friends now.  He'd never thought he was… what, in the way?  In four strides he was by the door.  "I'm going out," he said with his back to the men on the couch, then he opened the door and stepped outside.
Harry shook his head.  "We weren't there when it happened.  I don’t know what could be affecting her."  Anyway, why would she be in an alley, Malfoy's alley, when affected by this spell?  Harry didn't think this had anything to do with a mishap at the Department.  The whole thing set up alarm bells.
"Harry. Harry, I'm here. Come on, hang in there. Remember the wall." A wall? Harry grasped on this word like a truth amidst lies. "Just sit here and remember the stone wall. I'll be right back."
The Midnight Prince leaned against the tombstone and wouldn't meet his eyes; each word he spoke was mumbled.
"Mr. Potter… Harry," the youngest male of the group interrupted. "I know we aren't supposed to ask, but how did you defeat that Dark wizard in England? Even us isolated wizards up here heard about him. What was his name? Vandermar? Baltarmurt? Something like that?"
No matter how often he protested, she always fulfilled the entirety of her delivery contract.  For some reason the woman was immune to the Laryngitis Curse and Silencing Charms, and her voice had even cut through a Deafening Hex he'd cast upon himself.  Weeks ago he'd given up the fight to cut her choral antics short, and he stood by in resignation to weather through the onslaught and just hoped the torture ended soon.
"I hope that's a good thing," Harry says; a look in his eyes lets Draco and the night sky and the sea all know he's certain it's a good thing.
Harry reached out his hand and laid it on the table halfway between.  "No.  I couldn’t reach."  A fat teardrop splattered against the tabletop.  "I tried, but I couldn't reach him."  He'd let them down, both of them.
Harry stared at her in awe.  She'd really pulled through during their research and redesign of the ritual.  He could never have done it without her.  As Hermione softly snored in deep slumber, Harry reviewed all of her notes and rewrote the entire ritual down on another scroll, incorporating her notes in the process.
"Sure, and he's seven feet tall and sneezes fireballs.  Right.  That isn't Malfoy.  No way he would show his face like this."
"Kingsley! Ron!" Harry burst out from the back room followed by Hermione and Draco. His hair stood on end and black smudges covered his face.
"I know," Snape said, clearly sounding like he understood as he pinched the bridge of his nose.  "I couldn’t get your wands when I'd freed you.  My only suggestion at our current predicament is to continue working with mine.  I have no other options."  Harry was happy the man hadn't offered Greyback's wand as an option.  It showed he cared.
"Looks like you've been trying to figure something out," Draco said, eyeing the piles of parchments.
"Haven't I helped you enough?" Draco asked in his cultured accent. The barmaid caught Harry's eye then quickly looked back to Draco. She appeared to be hiding a smile, but not very well.
"Crap!" he yelled, gripping at his tender flesh.  A thick, warm fluid slowly seeped out, coating his hand and arm.  It didn't smell like blood.
"Harry, I know a few medical charms, would you like me to do what I can, or do you want to heal yourself?"
"Hey Lilac, need a new chew?"  The guinea pig whooped at him, running in circles within her cage near the Floo.  "Snoogles!  What a good boy."  The crup wiggled his entire body, tongue lolling with an eager desire to lick.  Harry slipped his hand over the canine's body and earned a coat of slobber.  He ruffled the feathers of a mina, scritched a cat behind her ears and hissed at an emerald tree boa that grouched at Harry due to a recent shedding.  Typically, the five-yard stroll took him fifteen minutes.
"What… what is it?" Draco'd asked, looking up from the sandwich he was building.  At Harry's posture, all hunched and fearful, he dropped the pickle and closed the distance between them, drawing in his husband, wrapping him in his arms.  Draco knew that Harry only rubbed that scar when something really bothered him.  And Harry never avoided Draco's eyes.
Draco leaned closer, hovered his lips just outside of Harry's ear.  "How can I help you, Harry?"  Then he licked.
Draco stood completely silent, staring in shock between Hermione and Snape, then over to Harry with a kind of pained look of constipation.
"Just lie back.  Get comfortable or something," Draco suggested, twisting his hands in the edges of his borrowed robes.
Harry slouched.  It wouldn't be so bad.  It couldn't be worse than proposing to Ginny and having her giggle in his face.  "Fine.  Let's get this serenade going."
enters into battle.  Overhead spells race across the sky, and then a shudder wracks the ship as something collides into it beyond the perimeter of Draco's vision.
Nobody laughed at Draco Malfoy.  So he'd left and would never return again.  There were two other pubs in town; not, he reminded himself, that he would be here much longer.
With a snort Harry fished around in a mini-cooler full of Marsha's Ever Frozen Water Cubes, three ham and cheese sandwiches that had long ago gone south, and a few wine bottles.  With a contented grunt he pulled out a wine bottle full of a thick, red substance.  He cast a quick warming spell on it and handed it over to Draco, who pulled the cork and took a long sip.  A supply of catchoo blood was always available for Draco.  Just one of the many routines the two had slowly developed over the years.
Harry stopped to refill his lungs, and as he opened his mouth to further berate Draco, he looked into those grey eyes and his tirade stalled at Draco's gentle expression.  "What?" he finally asked, wearily.
"Speaking of gay best friend, where are Harry and Draco?" Ron asked, looking up from his wife with a happy grin. His arms were wrapped tight around her and she rested her head on his shoulder. Remus couldn't help but be happy to see them together. It'd taken a while for Hermione to get her life back together after months in that magical coma, but she was back; her department reinstated her, she married Ron, and the two now stopped by Spellworks and Magicpots in Diagon Alley every few days. As unexpected as it was to Remus, it had become their new gathering spot and Remus never felt more connected to his friends than he did these days.
"Tell me what you know, and I'll pay you what it's worth." Remus jangled his pocket, sounding the Galleons resting there, all from Sirius' old vault, now in Harry's name.
He'd done the Auror thing, like everyone had expected.  He and Ron, and amazingly, Draco.  Ron dropped out first to help George at WWW.  After five years Harry decided fulfilling other people's expectations didn't fulfil his own, and he began working at Muggle animal shelters.  Soon after that he began his own re-homing centre in shop-space he'd purchased in Shepfield Alley.  Draco was the only one left at the Ministry.  He had always insisted he wanted to make up for past mistakes, prove himself to everyone who sneered at the Malfoy name, spat at his white-blond hair.  They didn't spit anymore.  Draco was the 'respectable' one of the three now.
When he was finally allowed to take on tasks for Voldemort's army, his duties began with small projects, usually researching or piecing together reconnaissance.  Nothing sensitive.  Most just a test of his skills, a waste of his time.  Eventually, they allowed him to aid other wizards and witches in brewing potions or creating what they called 'curse bombs', but he was never allowed in any planning sessions or given any access to the deeper, secret knowledge the trusted inner circle was privy to.
They'd arrived on a low foothill of Rila Mountain miles out of town and had to trek through mixed forest and fields of knee high grasses, and climb over farmers' fences.  It wasn't Draco's idea of fun.  He got grass seeds in his socks, ripped a hole in his trousers, and twisted an ankle over a rough section of rocky ground.  He was in the most foul of moods when they finally arrived at the edge of the city.
," Draco said, casting the room in darkness.  Reaching out he touched Harry, carding his fingers through his thick hair, caressing his cheek.  Finally, he wrapped his arms around the other man and drew him close.  A tremble rippled through Harry's body, but Draco held tight until his stress slipped away.  A clock ticked the minutes off; the only other sound was the quick, shallow breaths from Harry that eventually slowed from their frantic pace.
The two are no longer circling each other, only calculating and watching for movement.  Draco knows the timing is everything.  Timing and speed.
"Harry, we need to talk."  His heart did that tight, twisting sensation, and he knew his compassionate look was crumbling away.
As the three unraveled the lengthy roll of paper, Harry's eyes jumped over the page.  The writing was in neat, precise print.  It was Hermione's, in full, living colour as if she'd just jotted down a note to Harry, Ron, and Remus, and it wasn't some final hint calling out from beyond a comatose grave.
The other goblin, grumbling about pushy wizards, unlocked the door and out flew a cat-sized dragon.  Its long, sinewy body was twisting in the air, and its silver wings flittered furiously as it circled Harry's head, emitting a high buzz.
"Are you okay?" Remus asked Draco quietly as Harry railed at Kogelmann. Draco looked with at him with frantic eyes and nodded as Remus squatted down beside him.
Then the door banged open and Harry stepped in.  His chest rose and fell, heaving with breath like he'd ran up the three flights to the room, and the brilliant green of his eyes reflected the weak light of his wand that he pointed inside.
Pansy threw her hands up into the air and sighed.  "Fine!  I'm happy to see you got him out of there, Luna.  Did everything go okay?" she asked in a rush.
None of the documents really connected to any of the others.  Draco had translated 14 of them and they ranged from more information about a curse she was researching to some shielding spellwork she was developing to, of all things, a shopping list of potions ingredients, albeit some stretched the definition of legal.  One page was definitely some form of personal diary and Harry felt like he abused a bit of her trust by reading it.  He never knew she quite felt that way about him in their early years in school.  Luckily she found Ron to be far more endearing.
The older man held up his hand as Harry prepared his barrage.  "Harry, I promise to keep you informed.  But even if you were still an Auror, I wouldn’t have you on this case, you're too close.  Go home.  She's being sent to St. Mungo’s; you can check on her there."
Snape reached out and covered Draco's hands with his own.  Harry laughed weakly.  "When did you get all mature and stuff on me?"  Silence moved amongst them.
"You don't say," Draco replied with a sigh. Nothing surprised him anymore down here, least of all a cursed door.
Remus glanced up at Harry, curious.  Ever since the destruction of the sixth Horcrux, Harry had developed odd abilities, shown signs of a hidden depth of power.
Tufts slunk from one side of Draco's legs to the other as they walked down the narrow street of the old part of town.  The air was full of the scent of fresh bread, and the gnarled trees growing in a small park were beginning to sprout new growth.  Draco's head was held high and he caught everyone's eye who deigned to stare at him and his 'pet.'  So focused with looking forward, he didn't notice the young boy who'd scuttled up behind them to grab at Tufts.
"When we leave here I expect you both to visit often, and regularly.  I've grown fond of both of you and I don’t think I could be appeased by just one."
with Luna in more than just will.  Magic has been spent to prove it.  Magic that Pansy has agreed to, unlike the spell she'd been under before.  She's akin to a slave, a serf, a bonded servant, but Luna would never abuse her power, she isn't like that.  She doesn't want to be seen by anyone as mad.
Bursting into the night, Draco followed Potter, hand still clutching Draco's arm, fingernails digging into his flesh so viciously, Draco wondered if he'd have scars.  A minor addition to his current collection.
He couldn't breathe.  New sensations slammed through his body, a poisonous concoction of pain, heat, desperation.
"This is stupid," Draco growled. "Pick a door, any door and see what new level of hell you fall into."
Draco refused to ask.  Really, he wasn't even supposed to know about the date since Harry hadn't talked to him about it.  He watched as Harry ate a slice of pepperoni pizza covered in tiny fish and Draco sipped catchoo blood from his usual wine bottle.
After he'd left, avoiding Snape's pointed scowl, he'd lain on a twin bed in a room that he was to share with Draco, one of only four rooms in the entire cottage.  Clothes had been waiting in a neat pile on a small chest of drawers, and he'd pulled them on as Draco looked away.  The sleeves of the shirt hung past his fingertips.  He tried to sleep, but he found he couldn't.  The bed was too soft, the room too dark, the air too warm.  He swore he could hear something, just… just beyond normal hearing.  Someone was out there.  Finally, after fitful tossing and turning, Draco'd gotten up and flicked on the light, then without a word, he crawled into bed next to Harry, back to back.
"Oh, do quit your whining and do your part for the masses, Draco."  Pansy patted his arm.  "There, that's a good boy."
Flash. Tall man, black skin and white hair, cocky grin and dark eyes. Eyes that should be bright, brilliant almost, twisted in the odd slideshow parody.
Draco lifted his chin, looking down his nose at the short creature.  "It is not Harry Potter's to give you.  I suggest you bring your grievances to the wizarding leaders.  Not to mention, the sword was given to Godric Gryffindor a thousand years ago by your own kind."  He turned to the goblin with the keys.  "If you please."  He nodded at the door.  "There is a small dragon within, which Mr Potter would like returned."
Remus examined his face as they drew closer; he noticed it wasn't so much a smile as a leer. He had a distinct feeling of uneasiness at the wicked amusement in the man's eyes. This man was a sadist; Remus knew this to the marrow in his bones.
"Yes, yes, of course.”  He then bid goodbye to two of his students, who had stayed after class to perfect the Draught of Peace, a potion currently in high demand.  “I will be retiring to my office, Miss Brocklehurst and Mr. Hopkins.  I shall return in due time."
--untouched toy mind you--had finally convinced him that a ferret in a hippogriff corral had a better chance.
Draco leaned against the counter, smiling at her, speaking in such a way that Mary leaned towards him, drawing out her smile as easily as a snake charmer.  The man glowed with charisma and everywhere he went, everyone he talked to, he owned.  Harry tore his gaze away again.  He wasn't into competition.
"Oh fuck! Remus, what's happening?" Draco turned his attention from Harry, shuffling along his knees to the man forced into an unwanted transformation.
Alarmed, Remus tried again, "Is that you?" but all that he vocalized was a wolfish growl. He looked down at his hands again, a mix between fingers and paws, trapped halfway between wolf and human. What was happening to him?
Snape lifted his wand and began pacing around the pristine ground.  There was no sign of a battle; the cabin had never been aflame.  Finally he circumnavigated the grounds, his face warped in fury.
"Harry," Draco said, taking pity on him. "I would love to partake in your little shop." He winked. "However, I was thinking—" His eyes scanned over the flat. "I know that Hermione's has been a home to you and that you don't want to go back to your own flat. I would like to offer my place for you to stay, for as long as you want. I too," he looked down at the table, oddly shy, "have grown used to your presence and would be disturbingly at a loss if you weren't around."
"Come here," Harry said.  Like a timid mouse Malfoy looked over his shoulder at Harry, then slowly turned his whole body and crawled over on hands and knees.  The two teenagers huddled back to back, laying one side on the cold, hard ground, arms wrapped around their middles.  Malfoy was a little furnace and Harry was certain he won out on this deal.
"That's it!" Harry said, jumping to his feet, rifling through the other papers for something he'd uncovered an hour ago.
"Well I hate it.  I hate it," and he curled into himself, clutching at the throw pillow as he whimpered into the night.  "Why does everything have to kill?  Why does everybody thirst for blood?"
"Yes, Draco.  It appears so."  Snape sat up, the cloak slipping off his body to pool in his lap.  Harry made a point of not looking at the man's bare end.  Then Snape hmmed, a deep sound rumbling from his chest, and Harry had to look away, hoping the other men wouldn't look his direction.  Merlin, the noises that man made.
Heat blazed over Harry's face, blossoming down his chest and painting his ears.  "Oh my God.  Snape heard you," Harry said in a devastated whisper.
As the chill wind sent goose bumps over his flesh, Harry realised he needed to get home, to sift through that small library of words. And then he laughed. Wasn't he home already? The only reason he ever returned to his building anymore was to sit on the roof. He glanced over the skyline; tall buildings stood against a backdrop of mixed gray. This was the wettest winter he could ever remember. It seemed to rain every day.
"Well Remus, sometimes when you have a lot of built up tension, your body just reacts a certain way while sleeping. It's nothing to be ashamed of; everybody has it happen to them sometimes," Harry said in his most fatherly tone, which wasn't very fatherly in Remus' view.
"It's okay, Draco," Harry said.  "Snape saved us.  We can trust him.  You can talk to him."  At least, Harry assumed they could trust Snape.  He had gotten them out of there, but why weren't they taken to Hermione and Ron, or to other Order members?  Why were they stuck out here in the middle of nowhere with nobody to rely upon other than the very man who brought them here?  It was still a cage, even if a much nicer one.
"Stop struggling. Accept who you are, what you are." The figure stepped forward from the shadow near the wall. It faded as it entered the light from the window high overhead. It continued to come forward, gaining more substance and definition as the light was abandoned for more shadow. "It is the only way. You treat Moony like a cancer. You are Moony. Moony is you. The two shall never be separate. Accept." The figure tossed its head, flipping long hair from its eyes.
"Well, I'll leave you to it.  Remus, I'll watch the shop for you."  Harry waved as he walked back to the front of the store.
"Really?" Harry asked sounding pleased.  Draco looked up from a glowing list of people he knew and saw Harry grinning at him.  "Well, guess it's the green then."
"No!" Remus ordered, lurching forward to pull Sirius away, to keep him from the tremendous power of the artefact.
" he said, his voice strong and embedded with magic.  He thumped the tail end of the car with his wand and it shot to the roads—well, at least the lines on the maps.
He didn't know what to do.  Should he leave?  He wouldn't mind staying to watch, but that might make them uncomfortable.
Swallowing his anger, he nodded.  "Of course, Pansy dear.  How could I forget?  Potter is a means to an end.  I know that."  But he didn't.  He really didn't.
After Margie left, Potter said, "Good luck on your criminal.  I'm inclined to suggest you let this one go, small fry really.  Not that I'm telling you how to go about your job, of course."  He lifted his hands up in surrender.
Wind whipped through the high buildings, battering his cloak against the side of his stone friend and muffled his hearing.  He watched as the men clustered, bits of paper swirling around them as a dust devil made its entertainment.
"Boot!" he calls out.  "Duck!"  And Terry obeys.  The Slicing Hex lodges into the wood and in the next tick of the clock Terry petrifies the attacker with his own spell.
killing people.  Your side killed off a quarter of the Muggleborns before the Order realized what was going on and shuffled them out of the country.  Killed off or jailed in that Dementor infested hell."
"Let her go?" the greying werewolf barked. "Why would I do that, silly little man? I've you both. Hmm, doesn't she look delicious, just delicious…."
"Good morning, Wolfwood," Draco said cheerily as he peeled himself off of Harry. Harry grabbed his waist and pulled him back down for a kiss.
He wiped off his sword then bent down and came back up with the keys in one hand and a wand in the other.  He efficiently unlocked the cage, none of that rattling Greyback always affected, and swung the door open.  The captives made no move.
The days were warm in early April, and the three had taken to sitting on the hill together in the high, green grass.  Snape, or sometimes Harry—Draco never offered, apparently he was
Harry sat down to write it all out, but he couldn't put it to paper, either. He was too agitated, too full of raw energy. The air crackled around him. He needed to fly. He missed the Hogwarts grounds; there was nowhere to fly around London.
Harry pulled out a chair and sat across from Severus.  "We have not traveled through time, just dimensions," Severus explained.  "I think we would be safe, but I've not studied this form of magic before.  I need to do some study and without the proper reference materials, I believe I will get nowhere at a surprising rate."  He sighed, laid down his quill, and pinched the bridge of his nose.  "Unfortunately, I think it imprudent to leave the wards at this point in time."
He loved that Potter was a screamer.  He reached for his wand and spelled a puddle of lubricant in the palm of his hand, and with eager, shaky hands, he dipped his finger into that tight hole.
It hurt, so much thicker the man was than three fingers, but it also felt delicious.  A groan escaped his lips when he fully seated himself onto Severus' cock.  They stayed there for a moment, Harry wrapped in Severus' arms as he adjusted to the sensation.
Harry twisted to look back over at the other two where they sat at the dining table.  "But, I don't want to leave," he whined some more.
And if a few of his students cringed in fright at the sudden insanity of their Professor, well sod them.  Draco was happy.  Wishes actually did come true.  He would not allow something as silly as his image block his joy.
"Sorry, blondie, but today you'll have to go without.  Greyback's busy, and I just know he's your favorite.  Maybe I'll do you a favor and stop by tonight.  How would you like that?"
how to grow up and be a good person, while I'll, of course, teach our fine offspring how to wrap the world around his… or her, finger.  We'll both be here for him.  We will love this child like no child has ever been loved, and while we are bound to really screw up on the rare occasion, we've got stable people in our lives to redirect us if we totally sail off course."
Draco laughed.  "Of course, Tufts.  Each father thinks that.  You miss your boys?  Have they been gone long?"
The colors danced in the morning, light reflecting off the dew and the deep reds and oranges of autumn in the Carpathian Mountains painted everything richly, like the world blazed on fire.
He looked up and saw Harry staring at him, intensely and almost a little frantically. "Draco. They're gone. This is my watch, and they are gone." He dropped his gaze.
"Cake?  You sure this is a surprise for Severus and not a treat for you?"  Harry squeezed him playfully.
It seems so simple.  And to think, all these years, Harry has been carrying around a piece of such evil, and still he struggles to do the right thing.
Harry twists sharply from the tall table where the tea supplies rest, his mug of tea half-prepared.  “You did what?”
And with that, Harry and Snape lunged at Draco strapped up by vine and branch, their mouths colliding with this exposed skin, hungry and questing.  Tongue on belly, lips on throat, and finally, Harry landed on Draco's open mouth and swallowed each groan whole.
"Yeah, yeah.  Let me grab my robes.  Just… I'm not seeing anyone, and I don't want to talk about my sad and lonely life, okay?"
But there would always be pain, and as he glanced over at Harry lying next to him, he also knew there would always be joy.
"Good night, Harry. And thank you. For dinner." Draco thought he sounded like a blubbering fool, but when Harry finally met his eyes and delivered another brilliant smile, Draco was sure it was worth it. Harry's smiles had become more desirable than cases of the fine wines they'd just enjoyed.
With regularity he copped Severus' wand and escaped to the outside with it.  He would stand by the edge of his lake attempting to flood the wand with magic, his magic.  Sometimes it would glow, but usually Harry just became frustrated and wanted to throw the damn thing into the depths and laugh maniacally as it sank to the bottom and rotted away with moisture and time.
Tension poised in the silence that followed, Draco saying nothing, the others watching.  The only thing he received in return for his reticence was a glower through Harry's dark, messy hair.
Ducking inside, fingering his wand, Draco first noticed the chorus wrapped up in white shrouds, only their working mouths visible.
. Nothing apparently happened, but Harry knew that tiny motes had ejected from the tube and slowly drifted over the area, alerting the operator to a multitude of planted curses. Just another fun product from Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, working for an Auror team near you.
"Nothing," Harry says with a grin, those miles of dimples popping out.  "I do have to say, though, I'm not sure what to do with you."
Harry flipped over, treading water, and looked up at Severus standing on the edge of the lake; the blue water lapped his boot toes with the swish of Harry's arms and legs.
Harry stalked down the narrow tunnel with Draco close behind, wand up, scanning the darkness. He heard faint footsteps ahead of him from the other two Aurors, but no other noises reached his ear. The steps descended steeply and the corridor practically glimmered with layers of magic implanted in the stone and concrete surrounding them, giving way to wizard space.
The magic of the chant swirled through the warehouse, catching Harry's hair, sparking along the edge of his teeth. He tasted iron and sulphur.
"Merlin, Hermione, your hand!"  Ron ran over to her, sliding on his knees the last few feet.  She flinched as he drew close but let him gently take her misshapen hand into his own.  "Wow."  The Kielen Dagger lay beside her on the ground.
It wasn't that Snape was his friend… but he wasn't his enemy either.  He was an incredible wizard and a brilliant man.  Harry just had no soft spot for him; he long ago realized he didn't want a soft spot for the man who would be his spy.  Harry knew that Snape had given up everything,
"Well," Snape said and Harry looked up at his old professor who he'd seen die; whose memories he was intimately familiar with.  What he saw caused the tears to flow even stronger, a tsunami he'd been holding within that cage of steel bars.  With a wail the pain and the anguish he'd bricked behind crumbling walls now burst.  With a look of mingled compassion and sorrow, Snape stepped forward and opened the door.  "Come on Draco.  Harry.  Let's get you a bath."
"What the fuck?" Draco screamed, hoping that a sudden spark of inspiration would tell him what needed to be done, what exactly was going on with Harry.
The spiral of magic rises, like Whalebone Spout, then rains over Pansy, shadowing her skin in golden hues as it soaks in, penetrating her with the magical vow, seeping into her very core.  Harry steps to the side, swaying from just having harnessed the ancient magic.
"Braithwaite!" Ron screamed over the singing bird. Harry paused and sensed the air around him, forcing himself to concentrate through the endless melody. He didn't feel the missing Aurors anywhere, which gave Harry some hope. He didn't sense their spirits, either.
They locked up the shop and Harry fled, heart pounding in his chest.  That night at home he wanked.  He wanked in the shower, he wanked in bed.  Morning arrived and he wanked again.
They found a boarding house by the river and it was a much better place than their last accommodations.  The bed was larger with less squeak, there was a closet and a toilet, though the shower was still down the hallway.  The window opened to the water and a fresh breeze tossed the light curtains about.  Plus it was much warmer than Bulgaria.
"So, can you fix me, doc?" Harry asked through a yawn.  This daily routine of examining Harry and then testing a potion or spell had become all too familiar, and Draco had become irresolute, not expecting anything new, anything promising.
They seemed to lose their shape, their singularity, and just disintegrated, becoming an odd puddle like substance.  The gooey stuff merged together like a pile of silly putty, malleable and without distinction.  Then the blob slowly began to take form, flowing upward to shape two columns and then absorbing together above that, growing taller until it was roughly Harry's height.  It continued to morph before him, snake like tentacles erupting out of each side became what looked like arms and finally a bulge on top gained definition.  A few more seconds passed, and Harry's shock stalled all higher mental functions as the amorphous substance finally turned into one Draco Malfoy.
