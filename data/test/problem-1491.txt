Distantly, he wondered what Harry would think of all this, but he pushed the thought away. Harry was certainly done with him, he had made sure of that. He couldn’t dwell on the past.
“You’re not,” Harry said, and was surprised to realize he believed that. “You’ve had a rough go of it, but you’re not a bad person.”
“You thought she’d buy your bullshit story,” Ron cut in. “Unfortunately for you, I came too, and I’m not that fucking gullible.” He moved up to stand beside Harry, wand held at the ready. “You want to contact Kingsley, Harry, or should I?”
Draco snorted quietly into his wine and Harry flashed him a grin. He opened his mouth to say something else, but another voice cut in.
“Amigos,” Harry tried, wishing he had taken the time to learn a translation spell. When they had been working with Spanish aurors, they had done all the talking. “De...escuela?”
He was the first student to arrive, but the professor was already seated behind the large desk at the front of the room. She was young, with thick-rimmed glasses and a wide, easy smile that she turned on him as he entered. Draco didn’t recognize her, but she clearly recognized him.
Harry was asking Luna a question about the Quibbler and her late father’s ideas for making it even better. Draco, realizing that he had not yet eaten, excused himself quietly and made his way toward the buffet tables. They had been set up along one wall and were groaning under all of the food. The Ministry had paid for the caterers, of course. This was practically a state function.
“That’s good to hear, Mr. Malfoy.” He clapped his hands together and looked back at Harry with a smile. “Now that’s out of the way, we can focus on how to get out of this mess.”
Carefully, Draco stacked the pieces of parchment together and put them on the top of his dresser. He meant to go back out to the living room, perhaps pick up a book from Harry’s room or continue looking at the floorplans, but something stopped him, drew him towards the closet. Towards the loose floorboard he had found that first, disastrous night of their marriage (“Ugh,” Harry had said when confronted with intimacy with Draco, and of course, Draco couldn’t blame him). He felt his skin start to crawl with residual shame and lingering fear, but felt those feelings recede as he withdrew the small roll of parchment stowed beneath the floor.
“Huh,” Harry said, grinning. “I hadn’t even noticed.” He shrugged and took a sip of water. “I guess after someone has saved your life, not once, but
The man was making his way toward them, a broad smile on his face. Draco nudged Harry discreetly and took another sip of wine so that he wouldn’t have to make the first greeting.
“That’s very sweet, Malfoy, but it’s not just you we want,” drawled Ron. He drew the wand out of his pocket just enough to allow Malfoy to see it. “Where’s Viola?”
But then, between one step and the next, the world shifted around them. Instead of a London street with Luna watching them curiously, they were standing on a dark driveway twisting into away into mist. Beside Harry, Torey/Hermione gave a sharp gasp.
“Um. Yes,” Harry said uncomfortably. He wasn’t sure what to do with his hands. Malfoy was watching him narrowly, and Harry noticed suddenly that his face looked even thinner than it had when they had arrested him. His skin in the
Harry felt his smile fall from his face. Draco nodded. “It’s bad. He’s very powerful,” he said shortly. “I don’t know how we’ll be able to get to him, let alone stop him –”
He was at St. Mungo’s, he realized slowly. That made sense. His head was splitting, he guessed something had happened...
Harry did remember when The Conversation finally happened. They had just learned that Draco could be discharged the next day. He had been weaned off the pain spells, and was just taking a potion once a day to help his body return to normal. Harry had brought his favorite Thai food to celebrate, and they were eating in Draco’s hospital room, sitting across from each other at the table instead of Harry in the chair and Draco in the bed. It felt incredibly normal, to Harry, and incredibly nice.
He was grasping for their approval and they all knew it. Harry had done a lot of stupid things in his life, most of them flanked by Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Their support meant more to him than he could say, and if not their support, then at least some form of understanding. Judging from their expressions—Hermione’s, dubious, Ron’s, mutinous—he was a long way even from that.
“I didn’t want Oliver to get in trouble! Sure, he was a tough kid to understand sometimes, but I had grown fond of the boy. And he did look so like his mother.” Miles had signed and dabbed at his eyes with a handkerchief. “I thought he would bring her back. I kept trying to reach out to him to let him know I still loved him and nothing bad would happen to him, but he never responded. Finally, I’d had enough, went to the authorities in Madrid. They told me that he’s actually a war criminal, and that’s when you two got involved. My Viola! Kidnapped by a Death Eater!” And he had broken down crying again. They hadn’t been able to get anything else useful out of him.
“I’m not your enemy, you know,” he said suddenly. Draco tensed, but Shaver continued. “Just here to help the students learn how to defend themselves.” Draco turned slowly to face him. Shaver was watching him with a crooked smile.
“Do I wound you, Malfoy?” Harry asked quietly, moving even closer. The other man’s eyes flicked up to meet his, and Harry was taken aback at the depth of sadness he saw there.
Malfoy shook his head, still not making eye contact. “I’ll be here. At least I think I will.” He looked up briefly, almost disinterested. “Do you happen to know what they plan to do with me now?”
Still, it couldn’t hurt to check. The voice had said to go to the bathroom, so Draco moved easily toward the hall. It was the most natural thing in the world to go to one’s own bathroom during a party. He put his plate of food on the hall table to the right of the bathroom door, and stepped quickly inside.
his head. It was difficult not to jerk away or fidget, but Harry had experience with this sort of thing. This was not the first time he had been treated for a head injury.
“Draco,” Harry said, a breath, a relief. “I’m glad you’re still awake. I – I have something I need to say.”
“First of all, if you can’t afford a lawyer, the Ministry will provide you one of their legal staff who are highly skilled and incredibly ethical,” Harry retorted. “Second, excuse me for thinking that your boyfriend would want to help you, clearly –”
Footsteps sounded and Draco hastily refolded the parchment and stuffed it in an interior pocket of his robes, stepping out of his alcove and coming face to face with none other than Minerva McGonagall.
All of them, he decided, and more. The entire flat, where he had rediscovered who he was when he was out from underneath his father’s threats, or Voldemort’s shadow, or the Ministry’s hand, or Harry’s well-meaning but oblivious fuck-ups. The kitchen where Ron had taught him to cook. The lamp that Pansy had found at a Muggle antique store that was so hideous Draco had threatened to move out then and there.
Draco smirked back at him and picked his chopsticks back up. “Now eat your dinner, dear, before it gets cold.”
They were deep in conversation, broken by several loud laughs, when they saw Draco. A hush fell over the group, and he could practically feel their eyes on him as he pretended to be very interested in his quill. He was tense, though, he realized – nerves that had been heightened in Azkaban were alight with warning. He tried to breathe evenly.
Harry felt like he’d been punched in the stomach. He couldn’t speak for a long moment. When he did, he felt as if every word was costing him.
“Reconciliation is all well and good, Harry,” Hermione began. “But tying your entire future—the rest of your life—to Malfoy…”
“I’m sorry,” he said, so quietly that Harry had to kneel down to hear him. “I forgot my place. I will do whatever you want, whatever you say, but please. Please. I can’t go back there.”
When they landed a moment later in the Ministry of Magic, Viola gasped and sat down hard. Then she looked up at Malfoy and started to laugh, talking so quickly in Spanish that Harry couldn’t catch a word. Malfoy laughed softly in response, and Harry suddenly realized he’d never heard Malfoy laugh without malice before. It was almost nice, if anything Malfoy did could be nice.
“Why?” The question was out of his mouth before Draco could stop himself. He pressed his hands against his lap, desperate to know, dripping with shame. “How can you trust me?"
Harry pushed open the door to the holding cells and made his way to where he had deposited Malfoy that first night. He peered in.
“It’s four-thirty,” he said with the ghost of a smirk that made Harry’s heart race. He grinned back.
He hadn’t, of course. He’d stayed. Soon, though, he would be leaving, and it felt good. Good things behind, good things ahead. He threw the Floo powder into the fireplace and stepped into the flames.
“Yes, thank you Dedalus” Potter replied. Draco was quietly pleased to note that the other man’s easy confidence appeared a bit ruffled. He had already taken a bite of the salads set before them, and a bit of salad dressing caught the light on his lower lip. Draco looked down quickly. “Thank you for coming, it’s a pleasure to see you.”
being put in that kind of position!” Hermione snapped, rising from her chair so quickly that the spell book on her lap crashed to the floor. She didn’t even flinch or bend down to pick it up, which told Harry all he needed to know about how angry she was. “I did
“Good, I think,” Harry replied. “Ron says she’s settling in pretty well. I know she misses you, though,” he added awkwardly, realizing that he hadn’t been to Ron and Hermione’s house since Viola had moved in. Malfoy huffed a laugh.
They gave him until the end of the day. Malfoy disappeared into Elena’s room, and Harry could hear them speaking in rapid Spanish through the walls, although he couldn’t tell what they were saying. Malfoy reappeared and made several phone calls from the kitchen landline. Harry caught words like “me voy” and “ayudarle con el huerto” that made him think Malfoy was finding someone else to help Elena with her farm.
He broke off, suddenly afraid he would start crying. Draco’s face, drawn and pale, seemed to hover in front of him. Draco’s shoulders, tensing as if to protect himself. Draco’s hands, trembling.
In the end, the party came together very quickly. It felt like Draco blinked, and suddenly he was no longer sitting stiffly on the edge of Harry’s couch, but standing stiffly with his hand on Harry’s arm, greeting party guests with what he hoped looked like a real smile. Every so often, Harry would look over at him with a brilliant smile of his own, squeezing his hand or leaning over to press a quick, chaste kiss to his cheek. Each time he did, Draco felt his heart beat a little faster.
Harry jerked back as if the other man had slapped him. He didn’t know what question he had been expecting, but it had not been that one. “Um…sleeping?” He tried to laugh. It came out as more of a gasp. “What, Malfoy, do you mean –? Like…sex?”
Then he had made that comment about Weasley and Potter had looked at him like he had just remembered who he was sitting across from.
The crowd inside was slightly more restrained than the crowd outside, although Harry still blinked as several flashbulbs went off all at once. The Druid beside him still had a hand on his arm; she seemed to be waiting for something.
“I wasn’t even sad when I heard my father had died,” Malfoy said suddenly, casually, as if he were commenting on the weather. “I’m such a shit person.”
“So,” he began, finally focusing on Draco. The other man’s shoulders were still hunched, and he was grasping the paper-covered robes like a drowning man clings to a lifeboat. “What was that about?"
“Ah, Mr. Rose!” Harry exclaimed with a smile of his own. Draco had to fight a sudden, wild urge to laugh as he remembered Harry’s rage at the idea of any reporters in their home. Seeing him shake Rose’s hand as if they were old friends, Draco felt something warm blossoming in his gut.
“It was his idea!” Ritchie spluttered, pointing at Draco with a shaking finger. “He seduced me, said he’d blow me if I let him out of the cell and gave him extra food –”
“You can’t wear white to someone else’s wedding, you utter horror,” he said, tossing her the heels she had left by the door. She stuck her tongue out at him.
“Draco,” Lucius said coldly. “Nice of you to stick around. I guess that means you want to be returned to your basement?”
The headline stretched over a photograph of Kingsley leading Draco out of their flat past flabbergasted party guests. The caption read: “Youngest Death Eater stays true to form; corresponds with dark wizards in the Savior’s own home.”
After the first course was finished, one of the Druids approached their table with a long scroll. Draco remembered this from other weddings he had attended during his childhood – well, mainly he remembered rolling his eyes as the lengthy marriage certificate was read in full, witnessed by everyone in the hall, then signed by the two newlyweds. It was a long time to wait between the first course and the rest of the meal, especially for an eager child. He eyed the scroll in the woman’s hand, hoping that she was a fast reader. His stomach seemed to have woken up after a long sleep.
Malfoy picked off an olive. “Lucius always said it was to summon a frying pan so that Dobby could punish himself,” he said quietly. “I was four.”
It looked just as he remembered: the sea stretched out before them, gray and smooth beneath the clouds. The stable sat a few meters away, and the smell of horses mingled with the salt in the air. There were a few horses grazing in a fenced-in paddock behind the stable, and a small structure that Draco remembered as the proprietor’s office sat near the road. With a grin, he set off toward the office and Potter, impossibly, followed him.
Something in Malfoy’s voice made him turn back to look at the other man. Malfoy was still watching him blandly, but his hands had clasped into fists.
“Look, Ron—” He stopped abruptly as a bored-looking waitress came over to take their food orders. When she was safely back in the kitchen, he tried again. “I haven’t been around as much for you and Hermione, and I’m sorry about that.”
Harry laughed as well, feeling a lightness inside him that he hadn’t felt in...well, in a long time. “That was fun,” he said, leaning back against the wood. “Well, not fun,” he amended quickly. “It was bloody terrible, wasn’t it? Umbridge.” He and Neville both shuddered theatrically, then laughed at each other.
“He’s a git, isn’t he, but he’s our git,” said Ron sheepishly when Harry looked at him in amazement, and the others laughed, gathering around Harry’s bed. The St. Mungo’s nurses glanced over at them disapprovingly, but didn’t say anything. He was Harry Potter, after all.
“My goodness!” he exclaimed, his reedy voice an echo of the voice from years past. “Can this really be young Mr. Malfoy? Why, I hardly recognize you, sir, you’ve grown so.” He pulled himself to his feet, grasping a cane that was leaning against his chair, and squinting into Draco’s face as he tottered out from the desk. Draco felt his cheeks flush with mingled embarrassment and pleasure when he placed one papery hand against Draco’s cheek. It had been such a long time since anyone had reacted favorably to seeing him. The old man hadn’t even looked at Potter, a step behind Draco.
“Thank you, sir, I’ve got it,” Harry said, scrambling for a piece of paper. “Weren’t the kidnapping charges dropped when Viola’s custody –”
Draco ate his own food slowly, aware of his stomach as it accepted the finest food it had been given in years. There must have been some kind of spell on the salmon, though, for although it was rich and buttery, and the mashed potatoes must have been made with cream they were so fluffy, he didn’t feel nauseous at all. At least, not because of the food. After the first question, Potter had remained focused on the plate before him.
“Draco Malfoy will go to trial for breaking the terms of his probation and kidnapping on July 13,” Robards repeated with exaggerated slowness. “Do you want me to write it down for you?”
“You promised, Potter,” Malfoy said through gritted teeth. His eyes were wide and desperate. Harry relented.
“Not your fault, either,” Harry said with a small chuckle. “At least, nothing you’re doing now. Ron’s just—”
“You poor sod,” he said, almost kindly. “I paid him to tell you those things to see how you’d respond. Didn’t even have to pay him much, when I told him it was to fuck with a Death Eater.”
Ron was staring at the letter in Harry’s hand like it had grown fingers and made a rude gesture at him. On the table between them, Kingsley’s owl preened smugly, as if aware of the stir it had caused. “
“I was eating lunch at that little place behind the Ministry – you know the one?” she asked, looking around at them all. “It’s got sandwiches and sometimes soups, and it’s right next to that stationary store on the corner –”
“It would,” Bogrod answered with a nod. “But I think you’ll agree that to add someone else to your private accounts, especially someone with Mr. Malfoy’s…
Draco turned to leave, sure now that he was just hearing things, when he realized there was a folded piece of parchment stuck to the back of the door.
Draco just smiled slowly, feeling it build from one corner of his mouth to the other, and Potter cursed adorably and looked around frantically before leading him to the empty storage room behind the classroom.
Harry was still very weak from blood loss and residual spell damage, but the next time Hermione came to visit, she brought Ron, Neville, Luna, and Ginny along with her.
“We’ll take her,” Hermione said as she and Ron rejoined the group, as if Harry wasn’t pressed up against the bars with his wand pointed at Malfoy’s throat. Both Harry and Malfoy looked around.
“Let’s plan for tomorrow. I should be done at 4 – barring a prison break or another agent loss.” Harry scraped the last bits of soup from his bowl as Draco nodded again.
“I’ll be back with some dinner later,” he said quietly as he let himself out. Draco nodded, already half-asleep.
Harry was just about to sidle out of the way so that Fairchild didn’t walk into him, when the other man suddenly disappeared. It looked just as Luna said it had: between one step and the next, Fairchild was gone.
“I don’t want there to be anything between us,” he said, blushing. “When I ask him to go on a date with me.”
The grove was huge, a spreading circular building meant to mimic the traditional woodland groves of old. Harry knew it was even bigger inside, but despite this there seemed to be hundreds of people standing outside, waving and calling to him. Some were holding up signs that hollered things like: “We love you, Harry Potter!” “Harry Potter, marry ME!” “Harry is our hero.” As the carriage bumped its way through the throngs of people, Harry felt like he was swimming against the ocean’s current, waves of sound crashing over him again and again. Several flashbulbs went off all at once and he saw Rita Skeeter’s sickly smile as he passed. He hoped suddenly, fervently, that he wouldn’t faint, then chuckled at himself. He had faced dementors, Death Eaters, the Dark Lord himself – but this wedding was threatening to undo him. He wished everyone would stop
“Vertiaserum is complex as well, of course,” Elias said cheerfully as he walked through the Auror offices at Harry’s side, “but at least you get to control the narrative.”
“Look,” he said through gritted teeth. “I don’t know what sob story that wanker told to get you here, but she is safer and happier with Elena than she ever was with him. He may be her father —”
Harry found himself telling Malfoy things he hadn’t even told Ron and Hermione. At one point, Malfoy made a comment about cleaning with Muggles tools being time-consuming and draining, then ducked his head suddenly, seeming embarrassed. Harry, though, nodded vigorously.
“Yes,” Draco said hesitantly. “You know, we really don’t have to do this,” he said for the third time, but Potter shook his head and strode toward the living room.
Nearly an hour passed before Draco gathered himself and sat back on his heels. He told Harry, softly, not meeting his eyes, about how Shaver had been continuing to single him out during Defense classes, how every time he used him as an example for a hex or a jinx, Draco felt like he was back in Azkaban being tortured, powerless to stop it, powerless to do anything but scream. As Harry silently got him a glass of water and tissues, Draco told him about Warden’s threats and Kingsley’s suspicions and feeling like he was constantly on the verge of a misstep that would send him back to prison, wondering how he deserved to have gotten out in the first place.
But last night, something about Malfoy’s terrified eyes, the day spent bashing his head against implacable wizarding laws, and reading page after page of Death Eater-like atrocities committed against Muggles in Oslo, had put Harry fully on edge. He had spent the remainder of the night sliding in and out of confusing, fitful dreams that left him wide-eyed and panting in the dark.
The details were sporadic, with lots of missing pieces. Miles had apparently met Narcissa in Madrid about a year after the way. He hadn’t recognized her, having left England when he was young and mostly avoided news of the war. “She introduced herself as Helena Black,” he said dreamily. “Such a beautiful woman, with such sad eyes.” She had asked him for help finding her son a job, and he had gotten Draco a job at a factory near the city. He and Narcissa had fallen in love (here, Ron and Harry had exchanged furtive, disbelieving glances. Personally, Harry doubted Narcissa had fallen in love with anyone after Lucius, but marrying their benefactor so as to continue being supported certainly seemed like something she would do), and they had been blessed with a baby girl: Viola. “It was a miracle!” Miles had gushed. “My Helena was no spring chicken, but our love was stronger than anything!”
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand and slipped in as the door was closing, making sure to crouch slightly so that their feet would be hidden. He felt Draco tense behind him.
Harry pressed a quick, desperate kiss to Draco’s lips. “It’s so hot when you’re stupidly brave,” he muttered with a smile. Draco huffed a breathless laugh.
“Oh, now that is a shame,” the elderly man said. He pressed his hand briefly into Draco’s cheek before removing it. “She was a noble woman.”
Draco nodded and lay back against the pillows. He closed his eyes. “I’ll kick his ass if he tries,” he said, and smiled crookedly. Harry chuckled and rose to leave again.
Draco didn’t realize he had closed his eyes until the bathroom door slammed open and he snapped back to the present. He turned quickly, planning to slip to the side and out the door with a mumbled apology. The words died in his throat when he saw Weasley stalking towards him. Ron had followed him. The other man was weaving slightly as he walked, but his eyes were fixed on Draco.
, including cursing anyone, taking more than 24 hours to answer any correspondence from Azkaban or the Ministry of Magic, or giving any public indication that this marriage wasn’t a pure love match greatly desired by both him and Mr. Potter.
was the best descriptor Harry could bring to mind. Somehow, what started out as definitively wooden boards at the base soared into towering trees overhead, their tops lost in golden mist that reminded Harry of the Hogwarts Great Hall. Hundreds of people were seated on either side of an aisle that bisected the room from east to west; Harry knew, thanks to Hermione, that another aisle bisected the room from north to south, the two paths meeting in the center marked by four light-barked trees whose leafy branches created a kind of mini room within the huge grove hall. As he paused beside the Druid, he registered a change beneath his feet: the aisle had transformed from wood to hard-packed earth.
“You’re – it’s –” he breathed. Then he was kissing Harry, and Harry was drowning in it, it was so good, so
Draco felt sweat running down his back. Of course, it made sense. McGonagall had invited him back, but he clearly still needed to be watched. He might not even have minded much, had it been anyone else. Distantly, he wondered if Harry had been told about this. Probably. Draco felt sick. Maybe he could excuse himself before Shaver reached him…
Without letting himself think too much about what he was about to do, Harry folded Draco into a large hug and pressed a lingering kiss to his cheek. He felt the other man tense, then immediately relax into the embrace, his surprise at the kiss betrayed only by a light gasp.
“Don’t worry, Draco,” she whispered kindly. “Harry’s nervous too, and the tiddlywamps will do their best.” Then she patted his hand and turned away, her golden hair floating behind her, leaving Draco with several questions and an oddly warm feeling in his chest. He found himself looking over at Potter, who was watching him with a small, slightly wary smile. For just a moment, Draco let the warmth in his chest guide him as he leaned over to Potter. “I’ve been meaning to tell you all evening,” he murmured. “Great work with the tiddlywamps.”
“No,” Draco responded, suddenly feeling very unsure about the whole thing. “Look, we really don’t have to—” he began again, turning to face Potter, but the other man was shaking his head vigorously now.
sorry,” Draco said forcefully, then seemed to collect himself. “My past is not your concern,” he said, more quietly this time. “I know that. If you’ll excuse me.” He rose to his feet. “I am quite tired.”
It was difficult to remember, however, as Weasley bore down upon him. The other man’s breath smelled strongly of firewhiskey and his face was flushed.
“I hope she forgets me quickly,” he said matter-of-factly. “I would hate for missing me to ruin her childhood.”
“Get in touch if you feel any head or leg pain coming back,” she said to Harry as she followed Ron toward the fireplace. “And try not to call me for any illicit healing for at least a few weeks. Magical law, yes, any time. Please call me with desperate, pressing questions about magical law.” She smiled at him and Harry grinned back.
He didn’t realize how late it had gotten until his stomach rumbled so loudly he looked up, startled. The window by his desk was dark, with a few faint stars pricking out from behind London’s smog. The day was over, and Harry had barely even seen it begin.
She and Hermione ducked behind a wall while Harry threw the invisibility cloak over himself. Not a moment too soon: in the next instant, none other than Colin Fairchild himself turned the corner. He glanced over his shoulder, clearly trying to look casual and failing miserably. From where he was standing, Harry could hear him muttering.
“I...I understand,” he said slowly. “I messed up, that night, with Kingsley. I should have trusted you, I should have listened to you, instead of getting angry. I was so angry, Draco, but not at you – gods – I wish –” He stopped. Tried again. “I’m so, so sorry, and I understand if you never want to see me again but I’m going to get you out of here anyway. Ok?”
“I’d stop right there if I were you.” Harry looked around to see that three of the students who had been studying in another corner had come up to stand just behind him. All three had their wands drawn. The student who had spoken – no more than a girl, still, really – was glaring at Draco with a look of pure hatred.
“One wrong move, Potter,” Lucius crooned. “One wrong move, and this lovely lady dies a horrible, horrible death.” Hermione’s eyes were huge in Torey’s face.
“Yes. Yes, of course,” Draco responded quickly, doing his best to smile back. “Thank you. And thank you again for being my witness. I – appreciate what that meant. For you.”
Maybe Potter wanted revenge. Draco felt his stomach clench at the thought. He would be at Potter’s mercy; any jury, any Auror, any witch or wizard would side with the Boy Who Lived over a Death Eater. He would be walking from one prison into another.
The worst part was, he didn’t blame them at all. He completely understood why they were doing this. If the roles had been reversed, he would have been incensed that a known Death Eater had not only been released from Azkaban, but was being allowed to finish his studies alongside innocent students. When a low voice behind him hissed “We’re watching you, Malfoy,” he didn’t even look up. He knew they were watching. They should be watching. He couldn’t be trusted.
“Oh, that.” Harry laughed and told him about the snake at Dudley’s birthday party, how it had spoken to him and how he had made the glass disappear, setting it free to the consternation of everyone around him. Malfoy laughed so hard he nearly fell off the cot.
“No,” Malfoy said calmly. “I just thought I’d ask.” He closed his eyes briefly, then opened them again. There were still dark circles beneath them. His arms looked very thin. How much weight had he lost in these last two weeks?
“No,” Draco said firmly. “You’re not getting rid of me that easily. We’re getting out of here together or not at all.”
Harry raised both eyebrows with a little half-smile and said he had, actually, what would Draco think about that?
“Ok...” Draco was still watching him warily, but Harry thought he saw a bit of a glimmer in the other man’s eyes. “What did you have in mind, exactly?” Suddenly his face closed, became impassive. “Another party?”
Draco was trembling all over now. Harry pulled him close, one hand on the back of his neck, feeling the fluttering in the pit of his stomach getting stronger. “You can tell me, Draco. I’m on your team.”
He didn’t love continuing to lie to Harry, either. If only he could be sure that Harry would be on his side – would listen and give him a chance to explain before calling the Ministry – but Draco knew he couldn’t be sure of anything. Harry had been so kind to him so far, but Draco harbored no illusions as to where his husband’s true loyalties lay. If it came down to a decision between supporting Draco and supporting Kingsley and the rest of the Wizarding World, Draco knew he wouldn’t stand a chance.
“They don’t badmouth you to her, Malfoy,” Harry said defensively. “They’re caring for her. And she loves you.” He waited for a moment, but Malfoy didn’t respond. “I could see about arranging a visit, if you like,” he offered then, slightly guilty for not thinking of it before, but Malfoy’s eyes flicked back to him and he shook his head vehemently.
from a hundred throats in unison – then raised it lightly to his lips and took a sip. The wine slid down his throat and his eyes filled with sudden tears. It had been so long –
Beside him, Potter was already eating, his own glass of dark red wine already half empty. As if he felt Draco’s eyes upon him, he glanced up with a crooked smile in between bites of his steak and leaned over.
Of course, Draco reminded himself, it was mainly to do with the idea that someone could be happy to see him – could want to touch him, or want to be near him – and not anything to do with Harry himself doing those things. Aside from how inappropriate that would be, Draco knew for a fact that it was all for show. He had learned at their wedding dinner that Harry was quite a good actor when he needed to be.
They approached the front door, watching for any signs of movement, but there were none. After a long moment, Ron shrugged and rang the doorbell. It echoed inside for a long moment.
They peered into one of the newly-lit windows together. Harry was momentarily afraid that someone inside might see Torey’s bushy black hair peeking over the windowsill, but the people inside were too busy speaking to each other to notice black hair out the dark window. Harry didn’t recognize either of them, but Torey/Hermione gasped.
“The headmistress asked me to do it the year after the Battle,” he replied. “Said it would do the students good to see blossoms when they returned. Everyone took to it, so I’ve done it ever since.”
How had Harry thought he could solve anything by marrying Malfoy? It hadn’t solved anything. It seemed to be making things worse. Malfoy was clearly miserable and nothing was getting better, and he, Harry, had been an idiot to think that he could do with one action what Kingsley and Dumbledore and so many had failed to do over their entire lives, and now he would spend the rest of
“I still would’ve kicked his arse,” Harry said with a grin. “Somehow I can’t really picture that git singing.”
“Malfoy’s not the one on trial, here,” he snarled before he could stop himself. “He was cleared for Dumbledore’s death years ago, I gave testimony, you can’t –”
Luna nodded seriously and stepped back. Harry smiled gratefully at Hermione. “Thank you,” he murmured as she stepped up beside him. She rolled her eyes.
Harry suddenly remembered, vividly, how he had been sure Malfoy was faking the dark circles under his eyes and his thinning frame before Viola’s trial to make himself seem more sympathetic. He closed his eyes against the memory.
After another moment, the words faded once more, leaving Draco standing in the bathroom holding a blank piece of parchment, his wand shaking and his breath coming in erratic gasps.
The two little girls were definitely sweet together. Harry had seen them when he’d stopped by after breakfast before going with Hermione and Ron to the Ministry. They’d been curled up together in one of the big armchairs in the den. Rose was reading one of her favorite books aloud and Viola was staring off into space. When she’d noticed Harry watching her, she’d glared at him and turned her gaze back to Rose, nestling deeper into the chair defiantly.
It took him too long to hoist Potter’s limp body into a kneeling position. With one of Potter’s arms in one hand and his wand in the other, Draco turned on his heel and Apparated both of them back to their small flat. Potter’s pulse was still going, but so was the blood coming from his head. Draco felt himself slipping closer to panic.
“Sanctimonia vincent semper,” she said suddenly. Harry was opening his mouth to ask her what that meant, when a dark curtain seemed to rise. Suddenly, light was pouring from every window in the Manor, and human figures were moving across several windows. Harry gaped at her, and Torey/Hermione looked back at him with gleeful satisfaction.
“Hey,” he said, and waited until Harry looked at him to continue. “I know missing children cases are hard for you, and this one’s going to be even harder. I mean –” he gestured helplessly. “It’s fucking Malfoy, isn’t it? The git disappears for six years and then pops back up, a kidnapper.”
Lancelot was happily munching on the thick summer grass and Potter—heels floating up nearly out of the stirrups, shoulders slumped forward over the reins—was laughing uproariously. Draco found himself torn between annoyance and hilarity. The sun was warm on his shoulders, peeking out from behind the clouds, and he suddenly felt like moving fast. Lady must have sensed his eagerness. She whinnied and flicked her ears back, listening to him.
“It’s too late,” he said, and his voice was so resigned that it made Harry’s heart hurt. “They’re on their way. I understand, of course.”
Draco pressed a kiss to the top of Harry’s head, and grinned at the other man as he came around to take his seat beside him.
“You’ll never guess what Viola and Rose put in Ron’s shoes this morning,” Harry said by way of greeting, which seemed to be all Malfoy needed. With a crow of pure delight, he grabbed the Tupperware and settled himself on the edge of the cot as Harry pulled up the chair.
Harry felt something cold slide down his spine and pool in his gut. He shook his head, suddenly feeling very small, and very foolish. Neville reached over and bumped his arm, gently. Everything about Neville suddenly seemed very gentle.
Bogrod re-entered the room with several pages of parchment covered in spidery writing. He explained the changes quickly, then Harry signed and initialed at the bottom of every page. It was done.
Ron shot him a look that was rather too full of understanding for Harry’s liking, then reached out and grabbed his arm, pulling them both to a stop in the hallway outside the main Auror offices.
“Are you implying that I can’t defend myself against Malfoy?” Harry asked archly. “May I remind you, he won’t have Crabbe and Goyle to hide behind now—and time in Azkaban must have done something to him…”
“That’s alright,” Draco answered, taking a seat at the table across from Harry. He was holding his shoulders even more stiffly than usual, Harry noticed. “How was work?”
He was still debating it the following Monday as he finished his breakfast in the Great Hall. He usually ate breakfast at his and Harry’s flat, but things had been a little tense since the party. It was probably his own guilty conscience, Draco told himself. Harry had actually seemed very attentive during the night of the party. Every time Draco looked down at his plate at the table, his eye fell on the silver ring on his finger and he remembered how Harry had played with it absently as they listened to the band. Almost as if they were really in love.
“No,” Draco mused, hanging up another ornament. This one was a miniature lion that roared silently and pawed at the air. “He had strengths in other areas.”
“Maybe that’s why you need a break,” Ron said matter-of-factly as they walked down the hall back to their own offices. “You killed Voldemort, finished Hogwarts, then started working here immediately. You’ve never had a break, Harry, and everyone needs a break sometimes. Look at me. Look at Hermione.”
And then it was over. When the fog cleared, they were standing in the living room of Harry’s flat and everything was silent.
Harry looked at him, a question in his eyes, but Draco put his hands in his lap and looked down, not saying anything more. After a moment, Harry picked up his fork and pushed more rice onto his plate. “You and your mother, both,” he said quietly. “I’m alive now thanks to two of the three Malfoys.” He chuckled, taking another bite. “Fancy that.”
“You can put those down there,” he said, indicating a table beneath a portrait with a nod of his head. “I’d invite you to stay and help me decorate, but I daresay you’ll be wanting to get to class!”
“And he’s the perfect candidate,” Hermione said, eyes shining. “Always a little ambiguous regarding the Death Eaters, never outright killed anyone, did his time in exile and then saved his little sister from a monster. Any lawyer worth their salt can make a case for personal growth and second chances.”
, Harry thought. He nodded back. Slowly, carefully, they crept forward and Harry pressed his ear to the wood.
Potter regained his composure just enough to wave one hand. “Go on, Malfoy, don’t wait for me. You do your galloping, or whatever it is people who actually know how to ride these things do. We’ll be here, eating our fill.”
Harry grinned at him again and winked. Draco's heart stuttered and he blushed deeply. "Shut up, Potter."
"You shouldn't have been forced to let Death Eaters into the school at sixteen," Harry twisted his wand in his fingers, "Or been forced to try and kill Dumbledore. I should have asked if you were okay instead of nearly cutting you in half."
"I believe your first point of action when trying to move forward is to discuss with those you have wronged and find out what you're missing from your memories," Luna advised.
Harry flopped down on the floor beside her leg, staring across the room where Neville had taken Harry's spot and was trying to copy Draco's intricate braid in his girlfriend's hair. Hermione patted Harry's head and felt him lean on her thigh. One of the best things Draco had ever done for Harry, Hermione thought, was teaching him to accept physical affection easily. Ron abruptly got up and stared at Harry, fixing him with an oddly scared look and raced out of the living room. Hermione turned to Harry, "What on earth is wrong with him tonight?" Harry shrugged, his Christmas jumper hanging off one shoulder. "Dunno 'Mione, might be feeling odd without Fred. Why don't you pop your coat on and go check on him outside? Might need someone to hug him, and I reckon he probably wouldn't like it as much if it was me." Hermione nodded, pulling her winter coat from the hook by the back door and slipping outside.
Harry stared at the picture of who he assumed was Teddy sitting happily in Hermione's lap on the coffee table. A little boy clutching a stuffed dragon looks up at Hermione in wonder and his hair changes to match her mass of tight curls.
Ouch, I'm on the ground. My shoulder fucking hurts. Where's my wand? Where's Ron? I can't see Hermione anymore - she was next to Malfoy! Who is screaming? Fuck, there's so much blood, whose blood is it? Someone's grabbed me - fuck - oh, it's just Ron. He's yelling something but I can't hear him over the screaming. I can't stop shaking, I've got to pull it together and find Hermione. Fuck, there's a little kid with a leg missing. I've got you, I've got you. It'll be okay, I'll get you to help.
Harry smiled at him and turned to Luna, planting a messy kiss on her cheek. Luna brightened immediately, "Oh, thank you Draco. I'm glad you're not upset at me." Draco shared an ambivalent look with Harry, Luna was a mysterious force to be reckoned with.
"It's not his fault," Hermione glared at Harry, "As if he asked for this! And my arm and Marcie's leg were able to be grown back because thankfully we had only physical injuries and not curse damage!"
Luna crossed her fingers and placed them on her desk, "That could be extremely traumatic. For yourself, I mean."
"Mother mixed up her creme brûlée this year by using some of the maple syrup that Charlie brought back when he rescued that Colddrake. I thought it tasted like treacle tart but a bit more adult." Draco was eating a profiterole and Harry's mouth went dry watching Draco licking cream off his fingers. Ron kicked him under the table.
Harry put his head in his hands and tried to cry, no tears forthcoming. The weight in his chest grew heavier and he was exhausted. Harry abandoned thoughts of cleaning up the tea service and went upstairs to bed.
, before Draco dropped his sleeve. Harry felt a swell of nausea as he made the connection between Hermione's injury from Bellatrix and Malfoy's arm.
“I guess so,” he said slowly. “We can contact Miles first thing tomorrow, but she does need a place to stay the night. Can’t have her in one of the holding cells.”
“By the way,” Harry said quickly, not wanting to make too big of a deal out of this but also feeling strange about Draco not knowing. “I’m taking some time off from the Aurors. Starting tomorrow, actually.” He watched Draco, wondering how the other man would respond. Draco’s face, when he glanced up from his parchment, was unreadable.
It was mid-afternoon, sunlight streaming into the kitchen. Malfoy was standing at the stove, stirring something in a sauce pan. A much younger Viola sat at his feet, playing with a ratty stuffed lion. “Does Admiral Covington want any pasta?” Malfoy asked Viola seriously. She looked at the lion, then at Malfoy, and shook her head solemnly. “Ok,” Malfoy agreed easily. “Would you like any pasta?” He looked over his shoulder quickly as he said it —
Harry pushed back from the desk and rubbed his eyes wearily. It was a strange, unsettling feeling, knowing that Malfoy was up to something but having
But Azkaban had apparently pushed his father over the edge. All the contradictions were gone, replaced with a single goal, a single purpose: to finish the job Voldemort had begun and take over the entire world. Lucius would succeed where his master had failed. Like his master, he would start with England. Unlike his master, though, he would not move forward until Harry Potter was finally dead.
“Tomorrow?” Draco asked, feeling his stomach clench again but remembering just in time not to look into Kingsley’s face. “The wedding is tomorrow?”
Harry pushed back from his chair and took a breath. He hadn’t thought about Malfoy, down there in one of the holding cells, in days. Had it been two weeks since Miles’s trial? Since Malfoy and Elias...
, exactly, because their “normal” had never been kind and easy like this—but like something he could get used to, perhaps even grow to enjoy.
“All right, Malfoy?” he asked quietly, leaning solicitously toward him for the benefit of their guests. Draco nodded quickly and found he didn’t have to go so deep for a smile this time.
“Or getting blown yourself,” said another, and all three laughed crudely. Feeling like he was grasping at the last straw, Harry followed them.
“Really, Potter, you’re causing quite a scene,” Malfoy drawled, but he was smiling. Harry thought he didn’t seem to be able to help it.
The door closed and they were alone. Draco was still chained to the posts, his head hanging. He looked exhausted, ravaged. Harry took a deep breath and took off the Invisibility Cloak.
“Where is the money, you little cunt?” he rasped. “Tell me, or your sister gets cut.” Suddenly he smashed the bottle against the table and brought a jagged edge up to Viola’s cheek, which was reddening already from the smack.
They hired a lawyer whom Hermione knew from school. Elias Cho was charming, likeable, and completely single-minded when it came to children’s custody cases, according to Hermione. “He’s about as far from a Malfoy as you can get. He’ll be perfect.”
After the first few beatings, Draco had gotten the message. It had been months—years?—since he had tried to even talk to any of the other prisoners. Being ignored was much better than being hurt.
The next hour was tense. Malfoy ate his slice of tortilla with a sort of distracted intensity that suggested he was thinking hard about something else. He wasn’t meeting Harry’s eyes, which infuriated Harry for some reason. Ron had slipped easily into the role of guest, and was conversing with Elena in broken Spanglish that had them both giggling. Viola, who had rejoined them when the tortilla appeared, alternated between looking back and forth between Malfoy and Harry and singing a little song to herself in Spanish as she took bites of tortilla.
“Very likely,” Harry agreed. “They like to get custody cases cleared up as quickly as possible, so that the child in question can return to a sort of normalcy. I’ll check in with Kingsley this afternoon and let you both know.”
But Potter had stayed. Had stroked his back and his head. Had let him cry, then listened as he spilled out everything he had been holding inside. Well, almost everything. He had been on the edge of telling Harry even that last, his father’s letters, when Harry had said the unthinkable. Had done the impossible. Had said –
Harry was clutching his wand in his pocket and scanning the scene before for any signs of life. The only living things he saw were the horses, and a bird taking flight from the fields, spiraling upwards into the late summer air.
It had been years since he and his mother had gone riding, but when Potter clasped his hand and looked at him expectantly, it was surprisingly easy to remember the salt spray on his face, the fresh tang in the air, and the smell of horses laid against the color green. Draco turned on his heel, feeling Potter turning right along with him.
“I love you,” he replied, and they pulled gently apart. Ron held out his hand and Viola took it. He picked up her small suitcase with the other hand and nodded at Harry. “All right?”
“Interesting,” came Miles’s voice, and Malfoy spun around so quickly he hit his hand against the counter. The older man was standing in the doorway. He had clearly been listening to everything. “This man of yours – he wouldn’t be Álvaro Perez, would he?”
“Shut up!” Harry snapped, and stepped forward once more. Draco flinched back and Harry felt a wave of magic hit him like a physical blow. He had just enough time to think –
Draco shook his head, lying. The last thing he’d wanted from today was to see Granger and Weasley swapping spit, albeit in the future.
"How can you not know?" hissed Draco, glaring at Harry. "You take Care of Magical Creatures, don't you? Surely they've appeared in... in a textbook or, or... Fuck, I know what they are. But why can I—?"
"Knew you'd be familiar," Moody said. He grabbed another spider, held it tightly in his callous hands, and pointed his wand at it. "Imperio!"
As soon as silence settled over the room, he felt strangely at a loss. Astoria had been right: the problem
Some of that he’d never even let himself think about, let alone say. Yet Draco knew it was true. Because, the reality was, the dreams terrified him; not because they were bloody and elaborate, but because they might be
Luna, of course, noticed. She didn’t have much tact on a good day, so it wasn’t surprising when she sat down in the Great Hall one morning and asked him, straight-out, if Draco had a crush on Harry Potter.
Potter releases a wet laugh and tugs Draco to his chest. “Oh, my God, Malfoy! Don’t ever do that again!”
This was a terrible idea. A terrible, no-good, awful idea. Draco was rarely the type to help people. He was a man of routine, and
Finally they clamber upward into the girl’s bathroom. A ghost is waiting nearby, but Draco pointedly ignores it in favour of asking: “So, what actually just happened? My brain still feels fuzzy.”
The rest of their journey to Hogwarts went uneventfully. Granger and Weasley showed up a little over an hour in, muttering about Blaise Zabini and Pansy being made Slytherin prefects. By the time the train was pulling into Hogsmeade Station, the skies outside the window had been painted in stars just visible through the rain, and everybody was thankful to have arrived. Draco helped Luna up and they dragged their suitcases from the compartment, shuffling off in the direction of the doors.
The rest of her speech was lost on him. It sounded like she was just repeating the same stuff, so he guessed it would be alright to zone out. It was only when Granger jabbed him in the arm that he realised the class had moved onto... staring into teacups? Somebody, probably Potter, had gotten one for Draco, as well.
A moment later, a heavy body jumped onto his lap and scratched at his chest. “That hurts, you blasted cat,” said Draco quietly, running a hand through her ginger fur. Helga relaxed immediately, even letting out a long purr. “Always so spoiled, aren’t you?”
“Don’t,” Potter says easily. They exited the bathroom and headed in the direction of the Hospital Wing. “I didn’t go down with the intention to battle anything. I just wanted to save my friend, so no. No, uh, thank-yous.”
Potter flushed, fiddling with his hands. “You said ‘Auror Potter’. I’m not an Auror, though. I haven’t been for almost a year.”
The green robes pulled over her shoulders shifted as she crossed her arms, a frown line appearing between her thick eyebrows. “Shouldn’t you be working?”
His opportunity to rid himself of the diary came by in early January. He'd been carrying it around in his bag and felt a sudden, exhilarating freedom from it. He rushed to the first bathroom he saw and chucked the blasted thing as far in as his arm would allow. He heard it land in one of the toilets with a splash. Draco ran for it.
Draco shouldered past the throng of people, and slowly reached the edge of the forest. He looked over his shoulder, searching for a head of blonde hair. What seemed like every tent was on his fire, giving the busy field an orange glow. He couldn't see Luna anywhere, though, so he kept moving.
“Serves him right, for freeing Winky!” said Granger, indignant. “I bet he regrets it now. I bet he misses her, in fact.”
"I reckon I'm the most beautiful creature," Draco mumbled, just loud enough for Boot to hear it, as he let out a low chuckle. "Luna, what other electives have you chosen?"
The Welcoming Feast was a busy affair. The Beauxbatons students— six girls, six boys— quickly took residence at the Ravenclaw table, much to Draco's annoyance. Word about his ability to speak French had gotten around the school, and as such everyone expected him to translate for the students who hadn't bothered with learning too much English. This was a tedious task, as the girls spoke in such high-pitched tones, and the boys all got distracted so easily, he had to listen very hard to understand half of what they were saying. Terry eventually put a stop to it, by waxing poetry about Viktor Krum.
Just then, Cho Chang appeared a couple of seats down. She smiled over at them, pretty in every way that Draco wasn't, and said, "Was that French? You know, I know a little bit as well. My mother has me attend classes in the summer."
An eerie silence rattles through the store. Draco steps closer to the two grownups, opening his mouth to request something, but hesitates.
The man had his usual cloak pulled over a blue nightshirt, and immediately noticed Draco lurking behind him in the corridor. For a terrifying moment, all they did was stare at each other, until Moody said, "What are you doing out of bed?"
"Did he tell you personally he wouldn't be here?" the second voice replied, with a hint of irritation. Severus continued after a beat, "Because if not, I think I'll be ignoring your advice."
It’s only a few minutes later that Draco is leaving Madam Malkin’s himself. His mother comes to collect him, a stack of textbooks in her hands, and a promise of buying Draco’s wand on her lips. They head to Ollivander’s together, Draco’s stomach flipping with nerves. He’s wondered about the sort of wand he’ll get since before he was in the double-digits, and whether it’d be like his mother’s Hawthorn or his father’s Elm one. Perhaps it would be entirely different but still perfectly elegant.
"Ancient Runes, and Divination," she said. "I wanted to do Muggle Studies but it wouldn't fit in my timetable."
"Shove off." He stood up, but it did little to erase the height difference. Draco had grown quite a bit over the summer, so he was finally taller than Harry (not as much as Weasley, though) yet Zabini was unfairly long. Like a noodle, or something. "And who do you think you are? Waltzing into my space and asking inappropriate thinks like, like—"
The next morning, Granger is nowhere to be seen. Draco questions the two Gryffindor's about it, but they’re set on keeping it a secret. He is sure it had something to do with their behaviour the night before, but isn’t sure
A bright green light shot into the jar, and a rushing sound whizzed through the air. The spider stopped moving at once; dead. Draco couldn't look away. That light, it had been familiar. It had occupied so many of his dreams, and now he knew why.
He mumbles unintelligibly in a response, then gestures for Potter to slide open the door himself. He does, entering with a loud creak, and plops into the space across from Draco. They sit silently for a few moments, simply glancing at each other, before Potter says, “I’m sorry I missed your birthday.”
“Alright, fine,” Draco agrees. He probably could’ve argued for longer, to keep up with appearances, but he’s curious now, about how the school decorates for Yule. “The Great Hall, you said?”
That evening, all the students were once more taken to the Great Hall. He rushed over to Potter, who told him the summary of what had happened. Black got into the castle again and had tried attacking Weasley. Everyone was already whispering about how he’d mistaken Ron’s bed for Potter’s.
The diary is starting to give him the creeps, too. Some of its replies are worryingly vague, while others bordered on threatening. But every time he tries to tell someone about it, a strong wave of fear pulses through him, and he can't get the words out. Draco will have to rid himself of it over Christmas and to do that meant staying back at Hogwarts. Luna volunteered to as well, to keep him company.
In one of these particular lessons, Harry leaned over and murmured in his ear, "You should be the teacher, instead."
Red sparks flew through the air in the distance. Draco narrowed his eyes. Perhaps they had caught whoever conjured the Mark, although he doubted the culprit had stayed to watch. He crept forward until he was close enough as he dared, and crouched behind a bush to listen.
After that, Draco doesn’t know. He can’t recall who moved first, though both his father and Mr Weasley gave as good as they got. Punches were thrown, customers watched. Embarrassment floods him the whole time, and makes him realise Lucius was acting like a hypocrite. Honestly, you can’t insult someone’s reputation and then fight them in a place where everyone can see.
“This is quite the rare type of wand, Mr Malfoy,” Ollivander explains as he packs up the failed attempts. Mother starts counting her galleons to pay. “Lime-wood and unicorn hair, ten inches. Lime-wood wands often choose wizards and witches who are blessed in the arts of legilimency and divination.” The man smiles. “That is two very curious wands sold today! How exciting.”
“It’s not like that,” he said, as they left the castle at noon. The three Gryffindor’s walked at a considerable distance ahead of them, checking over their shoulders every few minutes to make sure Draco was still with them. “I’m serious, Luna.”
Harry and Granger had disappeared after Sirius a moment before, leaving him to deal with Severus and Weasley; plus a werewolf that could come back any moment. Draco licked his lips, and noticed Sev’s eyelids fluttering. “You’re alive!” he said, relieved. Who knew three disarming spells could knock someone out for so long? “You’ve got to listen to me, Black was innocent the whole time! It’s all because of Ron’s rat! Peter Pettigrew is alive, and an unregistered—”
He licked his lips. He had no idea where any of that had come from, and could not explain it if somebody asked. Beside him, Potter sent him a confused look.
Draco decides to sit alone on the train back to London. He leans his head against the window, staring at the blur of scenery outside. Students near his compartment run up and down the narrow corridor, laughing and making early farewells. That tinge in his chest, which he felt on his first day at Hogwarts, comes back. It has him wiping away tears.
They found Sirius in his animal form not long after. The four trotted after the black dog, who was carrying some newspapers in its mouth. Sirius led them up into a cave hidden in the mountain that shadowed Hogsmeade, and then Transformed into his usual-self. Draco was rather breathless from the long walk, and didn’t immediately notice the hippogriff tied to the back of the cave. He jumped away from it, letting out an emasculating shriek. “Is that—?”
"Well, if you get home from your family thing early, you can spend some time with Harry. He's not going, either."
“Oh. I hear she’s part Veela,” Draco said conversationally. He wrapped an arm around Luna’s waist— she was about to fall. Soft snores flooded into his ears. “You don’t seem too affected.”
He melts into the gathering crowd starting to circle around them. As he runs, Draco notices Professor Lockhart making his way over, which only strengthens his resolve to avoid Potter at
A loud crash from another compartment made Draco flinch. Another moment passed and all the lights went out, plunging them into a pool of darkness. Luna's fingers on his wrist moved into his palm. He squeezed her hand, she squeezed back.
He started off again, briefly entertaining the hope that Luna had gotten away before any of this even started, but it was unlikely. She'd written him weeks before about the Cup— the Lovegood's had planned to stay the night, just like everyone else who had bought tickets for the occasion. It seemed like such a stupid idea, now. Like, yeah, alright, let's round-up wizards from all around the country and then not expect something to go wrong. Brilliant plan.
Zabini was kind of handsome, Draco thought, until he started talking in his annoying drawl. "I know about your secret."
The next ten minutes of his life were terribly dull. He walked and walked, legs burning, with no sight of Luna or her father anywhere. It was only when a dark green light burst from nearby did he get truly afraid.
"I believe it," Weasley said. "He always seems to know about things in advance. And it's a better explanation for why he knew about Crouch last year than him being a Death Eater in training."
“Teddy,” ventured Draco. He hastened a glance at Potter, wondering if the nickname was okay, and received a short nod. “Could you try changing something for me? Something simple will do.”
Umbridge found herself a seat on a cushioned sofa near Trelawney's desk, and sat down ramrod straight in it, waiting for the class to begin. Trelawney, with a small shake in her movements, clapped her hands together. "Today, we'll be continuing our study of prophetic dreams. Split up into pairs please, and interpret each other's latest nighttime visions with the help of your Oracle books."
“Yes, child, it is me,” Professor Snape whispers. He was crouching down so they were at the same level. Dark, greasy hair covers most of his face. “Count to ten with me.”
A group of Ministry workers surrounded Harry, Granger, and Weasley, their wands tilted down at the three.
, he thought. They deserved to be concerned. Zabini wasn't about to beat him up just because he has green and silver on his tie. "Can you stop beating around the bush?"
The conductor, a short witch that Draco guessed was only just of age, gave him a sickly sweet smile as he got on. “G’mornin’, I’m Jessie. Where’re we takin’ you today?”
Potter made a face that Draco didn’t recognise. It might’ve been confused. “I don’t think so? I doubt I had any more incidents like that than a normal wizard.”
He startled, smacking his shoulder against the wall. A fierce ache blossomed under his skin, but Draco sucked back the grimace and turned around with a smile. “Astoria. Hey. What’s up?”
"Good. Communication should be kept strictly verbal, from now on. Letters can be intercepted," he added, at Draco's confused look. "You've used the Knight Bus before?"
Well, maybe not none. Harry moves in front of Draco, blocking the exit. “You can’t leave! You’re part of the team, now.”
Severus waved his wand, and his suitcase shrunk to the size of a bee. Draco picked it up from the floor and tucked it inside the pocket of his travelling cloak. It weighed lighter than a quill. "You've packed everything?"
In the next few days, they moved from the drawing-room to the dining room, where Sirius seemed to make it his personal mission to get rid of anything bearing the Black crest. Kreacher put up a good fight; appearing wherever they gathered and attempting to remove things from the rubbish stacks, though all his efforts were mostly futile in the end, as Sirius would get so mad he would pick up the elf and chuck him from the room.
Grumbling the entire time, Draco walked the short distance from the front door to the kitchen, absently flicking his wand so his hair magically falls from its ponytail and across his shoulders.
The man wanders toward a shelf in the back while Draco goes cross-eyed from staring at the tape measure between his nostrils. “Try this, Mr Malfoy. Hawthorn, and unicorn hair. Ten inches, reasonably flexible.”
OOTP will probably be split up into 2-3 parts, cause of how much plot there is to cover. same goes for the rest of the books :-)
“Colin Creevey…” Draco murmurs, listening to the Ravenclaw table gossip about the incident. “That sounds familiar. Have we met him?”
, he thought. Draco had been reading way too many romance books to have taken that in a different way.
Umbridge glared at him. Draco resisted the urge to shrivel back. Surprisingly, Trelawney looked grateful. "A student, you say? And I suppose you'd like that to be you? Fine. Go on, then. Predict something for me."
“What a night it has been,” a new voice announces after the commotion has finally died. Professor Dumbledore stands at the foot of Draco’s bed. He claps his hands together. “Harry, Ron, it’s time I talked with you both. Young Mr Malfoy, I’ll come by tomorrow morning, yes?”
Black’s face stretched into a snarl. “Malfoy’s boy, is it? I should’ve known you’d get your filthy, cowardly into Harry.”
"I really don't think Sirius should've come," Granger was saying, chewing on a long strand of frizzy hair.
Whispering breaks out among the class. Snape glares at them over Draco’s shoulder and they shut up. “It’s urgent, sir. You don’t understand.”
"I hope she's alright," Draco murmured, almost to himself. "You three best be off. Those Death-Eaters will be looking for other people to play with, and I'd bet Muggleborn's will be at the top of their list."
Granger smacks herself on the forehead, and the boys’ attention is redirected to her. Draco breathes out, relieved they’re no longer staring. He hopes he won’t regret this, but already Severus’ words are returning to him.
That... hurt. Like, a lot more than Draco expected it to. He’s tried so hard to be more than a Death Eater’s son, to be more than Lucius’ gross ideals. It had taken months for him to even think of challenging what he’d always been taught— but he had done it, eventually. And sure, perhaps without the dreams, he never would’ve bothered, but Black had no fucking right to just assume he was some carbon-copy of his father; that his friendship with Harry was clouded in something malicious.
Draco glared at Terry. "You doubt my talents? Well, watch and have your world be transformed, Terence. Tu es le pire sorcier que je connaisse!"
She lowered her magazine, making her wide-grey eyes emerge from the top, and nodded. Harry took the seat opposite them, while Ginny and Neville sat down closer to the door. Luna watched them before saying to Draco, "How was your summer?"
They chat for a few more minutes before Pomfrey shoos the three away. She gives him another sleeping draught (“In case you need it”) and then Draco is leaving as well. He has a quick lunch just in time for the food to be cleared away, and then decides to visit Severus’ chambers. The man will probably be waiting for a proper thank you for last night.
Also, thank you thank you THANK YOU for all the kudos and sweet notes. Every single one makes my day, and even though I'm VERY bad at responding to them, they mean more to me than I can say <3 So glad there are folks enjoying this story as much as I am!
was a huge map of the United States and Canada, the British Isles, and Western Europe. It spread across an entire wall and was crisscrossed with shimmering threads in hundreds of different colors. Small, neat labels marched alongside the outlines of nations, some cities, and a few regions colored in teal or gold.
There was a wall and a closed door between the sitting room and kitchen, so he couldn’t see anything that was happening, but he could hear Elena clucking over the state of someone’s shoes. Then he heard the child’s voice again, complaining about something, and then the voice that was Malfoy’s but
Then Draco saw Lancelot, rider-less, cantering across the grass, and his heart stopped. Potter. Where was Potter?
“Hermione told me they all say the same thing,” Harry said, remembering the hurried conversation the morning before the wedding. There had been so much to go over, the contract had seemed like the least of his worries. “Everything was happening so fast—I didn’t think it was that important to read.”
Harry stepped carefully, trying to avoid making the floors creak, but all was quiet as he peered around corners and paused outside doors. Several rooms had people talking in them, but he didn’t recognize any voices. They weren’t talking about anything very interesting, either: just innocuous musings on the weather, the latest Quidditch games, whether or not someone’s aunt was going to be invited to her sister’s wedding. Harry got the impression, as he moved silently from door to door, of eavesdropping on a rather loud, rather boring, family reunion.
Hermione’s face was pinched and worn. She looked as if she hadn’t slept in a few days which, if Harry knew her, she probably hadn’t.
Harry leaned against the wall, fighting down waves of anxiety. He was just about to head back out to find Hermione, when three men passed him coming down the stairs.
“Harry.” Draco’s quiet voice cut through Harry’s fury and he quickly looked back down. Draco swallowed hard. Harry could see his Adam’s apple bob up and down. “The Minister of Magic has a point. Reporters always need a new story. If we give them a story on our own terms, we’ll be able to control what they print.” He swallowed again and looked back down quickly. “Of course, I’ll do whatever you think is best.”
“Not to worry,” the Auror, who he didn’t recognize, spoke over him. “She’ll be attended to, and the troublemakers will be identified and removed. Not to worries, sirs.” Harry hated being spoken over, treated like a child, but he noticed Malfoy’s cheeks had gone even paler and nodded quickly.
And now he was preparing to go horseback riding with Harry Potter, of all people. Draco was still half-expecting a punchline, some mocking joke or other that would leave him looking like a fool, with no options for retaliation without the threat of Potter reporting him to Warden. But so far, the other man had just asked him several questions about appropriate riding gear. Draco felt a little like he was dreaming.
. But it was like learning that Dumbledore had known he was the seventh Horcrux all along all over again, and Harry could not stop himself. Draco was here, and Dumbledore was gone, and the rage and shame that always reared up in Harry when he thought of his old mentor were far too close to the surface.
“Just making a mess of my life and hurting those around me, as usual,” he said with a grim attempt at humor. Neville didn’t smile.
Harry finally came back to himself beside a large lake. At some point, mist had come down, or drifted up from the earth, and it seemed as if he were the only person in the whole world. A small wooden bench faced out over the water. Harry sank down gratefully, casting a wordless warming charm. He wondered what time it was. He wondered where Draco was. He wondered if Draco hated him even more now, and put his head in his hands with a low moan.
“Azkaban.” Draco’s voice was hardly more than a whisper. “I’ll do anything, I can’t go back there, I’ll do anything –”
Malfoy of all people—why not just go ahead and do it so quickly no one has any chance at all to think things through?” He met Harry’s gaze, his own eyes gray and stormy. “Tell me again, in the name of Merlin’s stinky left toenails: why did you agree to this, mate?”
“Of course, I am available any time you like,” he said formally, turning back to his scrolls and parchment. Harry felt a twist in his gut and hoped he didn’t sound too desperate when he said – “Let’s go now then!”
After a surprisingly smooth ride across the ocean waters surrounding Azkaban, they Apparated directly into what looked like a dressing room, the man holding onto Draco’s arm a bit harder than seemed strictly necessary. Two more Ministry employees were waiting there, although these seemed to be more in the class of “make a man who has been in Azkaban for four years look healthy and happy again.” They washed and combed his hair, brought him new clothes, and one of the men even waved his wand in a practiced manner in front of Draco’s face. When he turned to look in the mirror, he recognized himself, which was startling. The dark circles under his eyes, stark against his pale face, had disappeared, and there even seemed to be some color in his cheeks. The man noticed him looking and smiled smugly.
“Sí, Elena. Les veo,” Draco answered tightly. Then in English: “She doesn’t understand English, so you don’t have to Obliviate her. I’ll come quietly.”
Still…A memory of Draco waving to him from horseback, smiling from ear to ear, stole into his mind, and Harry felt something in his heart twist. He had thought they were getting somewhere, finding some kind of relationship that would let them tell each other things, help each other out. If not husbands, and if not friends, then at least…roommates.
“Did a lot of cleaning, did you Potter?” Malfoy asked drily, but his eyebrow quirked in what seemed like genuine interest. So Harry told him: about the chores he had to do before he could eat dinner; about vacuuming Dudley’s room and having to move all Dudley’s toys, which he was never allowed to play with, to be able to get into the corners; about the cupboard under the stairs. Draco listened soberly, nodding once or twice when something resonated. When Harry finished, he took a deep breath, seemingly gearing up to say something profound.
“Oh – yes, of course,” she replied, seeming to catch herself. She turned to Draco; Harry could practically see each piece of her smiling mask reassemble itself. “Right this way, Mr. Malfoy. Slytherin colors, I assume?”
The woman nodded vigorous understanding. “Pues, entrad! Bienvenidos,” she continued, stepping back and ushering them into the farmhouse. With a bemused look at Ron, Harry followed her, with Ron close behind him.
He stopped. Stepped carefully into the room and closed the door behind him. Turned back to the two men before him. Asked again.
have the ones I don’t want, it’s disgusting enough that you’re eating your own, don’t you dare laugh at me” – and he thought, suddenly, that perhaps he could ask this question without it coming out wrong.
“I’m not fussed that you haven’t been spending as much time with us, mate,” he said, setting his pint down carefully. “I’m a grown adult, not a spoiled little kid, however much my actions might be borderline childish.” He grimaced, and Harry knew this was an apology for how Ron had acted in their apartment. Before Harry could say anything else, Ron was talking again.
He pulled out every bad choice Malfoy had ever made, every snide comment that had ever been overheard by someone, and turned them over and over until they glinted in the light and the jury couldn’t help but look at them. Hoker even brought up Dumbledore’s death at one point, and Harry saw red.
He blinked hard and focused on the paper in his hand. It was a floorplan, one of several that Harry had left for him to look at over the last few days: possibilities for their new flat, provided by the Ministry. Draco had been putting off looking at them – every time he thought about the Ministry, the nausea spiked – but Harry had mentioned it this morning over breakfast and Draco did not want to keep anyone waiting.
All through that long, strange night as he sat in a hard chair somewhere in a Ministry building, waiting for something to happen. There had been two guards posted on either side of him. Neither of them had spoken to him, and he didn’t try speaking to them. There was no point. Instead, he counted silently in his head.
idea where he was. It made Harry miss Hogwarts. Back then, Malfoy had always been just across the Great Hall, or at least visible on the Marauder’s Map.
“No,” Malfoy said shortly. He swallowed. “No,” he said again, more softly. “There wasn’t much of an opportunity for sports in Azkaban.”
“Why the fuck would he care, Potter?” Malfoy asked, opening his eyes again and staring at him in confusion. “I certainly can’t afford to hire my own lawyer. I assumed the Ministry would provide some hack who would pretend to try to get me off and get paid a little extra to do a bad job.”
They led him to another door, not the one to the dungeons. This one opened onto a set of stairs that were ratty and wooden. Harry had to step quickly before the door swung shut. All three men lit their wands, the glowing tips illuminating a basement with a cement floor and cement walls. Squinting into the gloom, Harry could just make out what looked like a dog crate with a heap of ragged blankets in it.
Malfoy nodded. One corner of his mouth quirked up in what might have been a smile. “I’ll try not to disappoint,” he said. Harry nodded back and turned to go, when Malfoy spoke again.
“Go on, then. What was yours?” Malfoy asked. “First magic?” he clarified, when Harry looked at him blankly.
“The castle looks good, don’t it?” Hagrid asked, stumping toward the entrance to the Great Hall. Looking around at the entrance hall, Draco had to admit that it did. The stone was glowing gold in the morning light, and there were already flowers and leaves adorning many of the walls and staircases.
Draco was suddenly very conscious of Potter standing behind him. “I’m afraid she—she passed away a few years ago,” he said, and cleared his throat. “Unexpected illness.”
“I told you, you don’t need to be,” Harry said around the food. He swiped up some sauce from his plate. “I believe that you didn’t know Riley was a Death Eater. And you certainly saved—”
, I want to see you again so badly.” He squeezed his eyes shut. “I’m so selfish, it’s such a selfish thing to want, because you’re far better off without me. I don’t want you, because I want you to have someone else, someone better, someone – someone
“I take offense to that, Harry.” Luna Lovegood appeared at Harry’s shoulder, a heaping plate of food in her hands. Her long blond hair was twisted up in a complex series of braids held in place with sparkling flowers. “I prefer to think of myself as a butterfly.”
Harry suddenly remembered the Pensieve memory of Malfoy and Viola sneaking bites of pasta when Miles was out of the house. “She’s a good eater,” he said aloud. “Ron says she’ll try anything he puts in front of her, but she always knows when she’s full.”
“Father,” he choked out. “What --? How --?” He clutched the older man’s arms more tightly. “I thought you were in Azkaban,” he whispered. “I thought –”
“We want to return her to her father, you heartless bastard,” Harry snarled, pushing past Ron. “What have you done with her?”
Harry nodded as the man looked up at them tearfully. “We’ll get her back for you,” he said firmly. “That’s a promise.”
“Harry, would you join us in the bedroom please? Something has come to my attention and it requires your presence immediately.”
The spell hit Riley squarely in the chest and the older man crumpled. Desperately, Draco looked around but they were alone except for Lady, Lancelot, and several seagulls overhead. There was no help here.
“Hello, Potter,” he said with a broad smile. “I wondered when you’d make your move. My servants have been abuzz with news of you.” He gestured at the dementors, shifting ominously around him. “Very kind of you to finally show up.”
She was gone before she had finished her sentence. Ron, trailing after her holding a gurgling baby Rose, grinned at Draco.
“We’ll be watching, boy,” Warden murmured, her eyes intense. “The newspapers, the media—what they print matters, so you’d best keep an eye on it too. You should also know,” she added, putting a hand on his shoulder as he started to walk away from the guards, “the Ministry will be checking in with Mr. Potter regularly. If he has any complaints at all about you…” She trailed off, letting Draco’s mind fill in the rest.
There wasn’t even any disgruntled Auror who had been reassigned from Azkaban to question – a fact that still nagged at Harry every day. If Lucius Malfoy had somehow slipped several letters past the prison’s security system, shouldn’t someone have been made to answer for that somehow? But no – from the outside, absolutely nothing had changed. Not even Ron, an Auror himself, could get a decent answer.
Draco paused for a moment, holding his own Floo powder and looking around the room. He and Pansy had made this place a home. It wasn’t the upscale flat he and Harry had once shared, but it had been
Harry laughed awkwardly. “Oh – just a little something I’ve been working on for the Ministry,” he said. “I got a little impatient with it a few nights ago and…well, let’s just say I might have to ask Hermione for some stronger repair spells.”
“There were some gashes that went pretty deep, but the standard healing spells seem to be doing the trick. That’s good.” She turned toward the door and he followed her out. As they walked down the hall, he considered asking her more questions, but decided on what seemed to be the most important one first.
“Percy heard Kingsley telling another Ministry official that Draco was going to a special holding cell for dangerous criminals until they could set up a trial. He hasn’t been able to find out where the cell is, though, and Kingsley has refused to give further details as a security measure.”
which, according to Draco, actually had some interesting points about a certain potion. Harry hadn’t paid much attention to the details, but he had loved seeing Draco talk about potions with that fire in his eyes. The other man had become so much more comfortable around Harry over the past few weeks, once they had finally talked and he had realized that Harry wasn’t out to get him. Harry drifted towards Draco and Luna, meaning to join their conversation, but he was waylaid by two Ministry officials wanting to wish him well on his new position at Hogwarts. When he looked around again, Luna was talking to Kingsley Shacklebolt and a thin, reedy wizard who Harry vaguely recognized as one of Kingsley’s assistants, and Draco was nowhere to be seen. He must have gone to the bathroom, reasoned Harry, and went to get another plate of food.
The owl flew away without waiting for a response, and Draco examined the seal on the parchment. His heart leapt. His own name was written neatly about a coat of arms bearing a lion, an eagle, a snake, and a badger. It looked so familiar, so safe—
Harry rocked forward slightly, leaning against the bars. “And that’s my fault. I wish I had. I wish I’d gotten to know you like this sooner.”
“Yes, I think that’s enough out of you for now, Minister,” Lucius crooned. “The boy has so much to catch up on.”
“She slept well,” she answered, with a softness in her voice that surprised Harry. “And she and Rose – she’s our daughter – have really taken to each other. She won’t talk to us much, but she ate a good breakfast and she’s with Luna now.”
“I do not. Need. Your. Pity,” he spat, and turned on his heel, clearly meaning to stalk into his room. A hard tapping against the window stopped him in his tracks as both he and Harry turned toward the source of the noise.
Except it didn’t sound like his normal laugh, the one Harry had come to know and love during their brief marriage. This laugh was rough, and not very happy at all.
It was his birthright, and his destiny. Harry reminded himself that this – this feeling of going forward because there was no other choice, this itching drive to wipe out evil – this was what he lived for.
Harry shook his head slowly. “No, Malfoy, I was saying that Hermione is working on a plan and has moved your hearing up to next week.”
The woman – Elena – laughed and disappeared into the kitchen. She reappeared shortly with two glasses of water and a small plate of biscuits, which she set on the rickety coffee table by their knees.
“Touching,” drawled Lucius. “But I’m afraid your time is up, Potter.” The door banged open and more dementors poured in, followed by dozens of other witches and wizards: all the other people Harry had seen in the house that night, along with several others who had arrived more recently, he guessed. Bringing up the rear was:
“I understand,” he replied slowly. “I really do. I – I hate that I did that to you, that I’ve been doing that to you this whole time. It’s –” he looked down sheepishly. “I’ve clearly got some of my own issues to work out around people not telling me everything. But that’s not your job, or your burden to bear.”
“You’re coming with me,” he said shortly. “To the cells,” he added, lest there be any confusion. “Viola will stay the night with Ron and Hermione.”
It was several hours before he could get back to Malfoy. Robards had been furious at Harry barging into his office, then flabbergasted at the allegations. Harry had released Ritchie and Robards had drawn out a vial of Veritaserum from his desk with a stony glare.
It turned out that the money clause in the marriage contract was tied to the rest of the marriage contract in its entirety. One clause couldn’t be changed without complicating the rest of the contract, including their actual marriage, which was out of the question. Draco had to give credit where credit was due: someone in the Minister of Magic’s office knew their magical legalities.
Harry felt anything remotely like sympathy for Malfoy abruptly fall away, and he led him to the cells in stony silence.
He turned to Kingsley, who was stepping toward him carefully, holding several sheets of parchment in his hands.
“Harry’s got a point, Ron,” Hermione said levelly. “I know you don’t like him, but you can’t deny the facts. Draco called me. He could easily have let Harry die, and blamed…Riley, or whatever his name was. He might not even have gotten sent back to Azkaban.” Draco huffed out something that was not quite a laugh. “But he called me,” Hermione continued. “And Harry’s fine.”
He bowed his head again. “No apology can come close to what you are owed, but I make it regardless. I am so sorry, Draco.”
Harry glanced around quickly. Indeed, in the confusion of the dementors’ flight, Draco seemed to have slipped the Invisibility Cloak back on and vanished. Harry had no idea where the other man had gone. Instead of anger or confusion, though, he felt relief.
He was running through these questions in his head as he opened the door, and was slightly disappointed to see that the living room was empty. It was late. Perhaps the other man had gone to sleep.
Harry was over at Ron and Hermione’s helping set up their nursery. Hermione had told them that she was expecting a baby in the spring, Ron baffled and beaming beside her. Weasley hadn’t even glared at Draco during that dinner. It seemed as if they had all found a fragile sort of peace, born from the comfort that he and Harry were rapidly finding with each other. Draco still couldn’t quite believe it, didn’t quite let himself sink into this new thing called happiness, but he was getting closer. Every morning when he woke up, Harry was still there beside him (they always slept in the same bed now). Every night when he went to sleep, Harry would lean over and kiss him right before they turned out the light. Sometimes those kisses turned deep and hungry, sometimes they didn’t. Draco loved them all. He had no idea what he had done to deserve any of those kisses, but gods, he loved them all.
“Ah, Harry. Good, Mr. Malfoy was correct. I’m afraid I need to ask you to come home. I am here in your flat, and need to speak with both you and Mr. Malfoy immediately.” He seemed to notice Ron and Hermione for the first time. “My apologies, you two. I’ll try not to keep him too long.” The smile was so undoubtedly Kingsley’s, even through the embers, that Harry felt himself relaxing. Everything would be alright. Kingsley would know what to do.
“I didn’t know if McGonagall would go for it,” he said quietly when he pulled Draco aside after class. “I just asked her if she might consider letting me shadow someone and she told me to start my apprenticeship today, so here I am. Is it – is all this going to be ok?”
The comment from that morning hadn’t even been that bad, but it left a lingering foulness in Harry’s mouth that was only exacerbated by the news later in the day that a Ministry covert opps agent had been discovered and tortured by Norwegian dark wizards calling themselves “Neo-Death Eaters.” It was unclear how much of the mission had been compromised. Harry dropped his head into his hands and resigned himself to working late yet again.
She led him down a long hallway that proceeded at a right angle from the entrance hall. This hall, too, was deserted; there weren’t even snatches of conversation coming from behind any of the doors. The air seemed to get colder as they walked. Suddenly, a sparkling silver foal sprang into existence before the woman and trotted ahead, and the chill instantly dissipated.
“So good to meet you, so good of Harry Potter,” she purred, and Draco, swallowing down equal measures of bitterness, rage, and fear that his face would betray him and he would be back in Azkaban before the day was done, nodded and smiled and nodded again.
“What did you think about? In Azkaban?” When Malfoy didn’t reply at once, Harry pushed on. “I mean, what did you think about wanting to do? When you got out, I mean. What’s something that you’ve been wanting to do for four years?”
Harry choked on his response. He suddenly remembered Dumbledore’s words from what seemed like a lifetime ago:
“This is really good,” he said, after swallowing the first bite. “Weasley really taught you how to make these?”
Malfoy’s thin, tired face wouldn’t leave his mind for the rest of the day, though, and neither would his words. “
It seemed to take forever to get to their table. It was at the head of the hall, a beautifully-decorated table set for two, with two chairs next to each other facing out towards the guests. They looked a little like thrones. Draco scoffed inwardly – leave it to Potter to milk every ounce of self-aggrandizement he could out of this event. Then he realized he would have to sit on one too, and felt his stomach clench. What would the world make of a Death Eater sitting enthroned beside the Boy Who Lived? He would be lucky to make it through dinner without getting hexed.
“Yeah, I did,” Draco said now. He swallowed hard. “And the Dark—I mean, Vol—” He bit his lip. “He did
“I heard you and Elias. After – um – after Viola’s trial,” Harry shot back, suddenly feeling like a huge creep. “Um...were you not –?”
“No, you’re right,” Harry said quickly, trying to ignore the wave of defensiveness that rose up in him upon hearing Malfoy insult Ron. “Ron’s my best friend in the world, but he would be the first to agree with you there.” Malfoy was looking down at his lap, his back very straight. Harry groped for words, wondering how he could return them to the almost-comfort of a moment ago. “Were you able to follow Quidditch at all? When you were—I mean—”
But something made him pause on his way out, made him turn towards the office that held the Pensieve. For Viola’s sake, he told himself. And so that he could have evidence of Malfoy’s crimes.
Draco Malfoy hung from the man’s beefy hand, his head lolling forward. He was horribly skinny, horribly frail. Harry could see his thin hands shaking where they hung at his sides. The man gave him a shake.
Then the scene changed and Harry was standing in Miles’s flat. He was confused, briefly, because it looked like Miles was standing over a pile of dirty laundry and yelling at it. He kicked it and it grunted. Harry realized with horror that the pile of dirty laundry was actually a person. It was Malfoy, lying curled at Miles feet, clearly trying to protect his face by burying his head in his arms. Miles kicked him again. “Fucking Death Eater faggot,” he said spat. “I know you’re hiding money from me. I know you are! Tell me where it is.” He was holding a bottle, the brown glass shining in the light of the one lightbulb.
Harry felt his stomach drop. They were too late. Malfoy must have guessed they would be coming and vacated the premises, or else he had never been here at all and the activated Trace had been a fluke. They would never find Viola, Miles would never get his daughter back. Harry cleared his throat and began to give a gruff apology, but the woman was still speaking.
Before either of them could say anything more, however, Madam Malkin herself was standing before them, beaming. She was, if possible, even shorter and rounder than Harry remembered, still dressed in mauve robes that trailed across the floor behind her. Kind brown eyes sparkled up at him from beneath hair that had gone entirely gray. She seemed to be overcome.
Harry stepped in front of him, blocking Draco’s exit. “Stop doing that,” he said gently. “You always do that.” Malfoy drew back, affronted and prickling.
Draco did not run. He did not scurry, or bow his head. He walked, slowly and calmly, to the door and let it swing closed behind him. He walked carefully down the hallway until he found a shadowed alcove a few feet from the hall’s mouth. Then, and only then, did he let himself press his back against the wall and close his eyes, taking deep breaths and wishing he could sink into the floor.
"Here, dear, have some food," Molly plonked a container filled with her banana and chocolate chip muffins down in front of him.
Luna stood up and wandered over to Ron's bed, empty as Hermione and Ron had gone to look at flats in London for the day. She started conjuring garlands of flowers from Ron's canopy, humming to herself. Pansy shuffled until she was sitting against the headboard beside Harry. "Alright, next question. What do you prefer, A - blondes. B - brunettes. C - shaved head. D - gingers." Harry froze. If he answered D, Draco might think he missed Ginny or was lusting after one of the Weasleys. If he chose one of the other options, Draco might think he had his eye on some other guy and try to find out who it was. Harry hummed, buying time. "I s'pose blondes." Harry saw Draco's head turn minutely towards Pansy, before focusing back on his book. He could see Draco's ear and cheek were pink. Harry frowned, what was that reaction for?
After stuffing themselves with enough food to last until dinner, the families moved into the living room to open presents. Draco was delighted with a first edition copy of 'Moste Potente Potions' from Hermione and the Fire Crab shell cauldron Harry had bought him. Harry was tucking into his packet of spiced rum fudge from Ron when he felt Narcissa's piercing stare.
"Araminta, dear, settle down!" Narcissa was reaching for her granddaughter who stood on James' groin in her rush to jump into Narcissa's arms.
with you Ron?" She looked up to see Bill offering Hermione the end of a Christmas cracker. She glanced over at Luna, Teddy was asleep in her arms and Bill seemed to have noticed too. Hermione cast a
His first few weeks back hadn't been eventful, it had helped that he was proven to not be a Death Eater and his public apology had gone a long way to people seeing him as another survivor of the War, rather than an aggressor. He spent most of his time with his friends, the Eighth Year students were housed together because there wasn't room in their house dormitories. Draco shared a room with Ron, Blaise and Neville. Harry was with Dean, Seamus and Justin Finch-Fletchley. Justin was the only male from either Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw to return.
Luna hands him the first one but places a hand on his wrist, "The black ones are the worst. You won't come back from knowing about these and rest easily."
Narcissa had already pulled up her sleeve, and was having various diagnostics cast on it by the Auror who had stepped forward. "She's clean," was his curt assessment. Draco had hung back, fiddling with his left sleeve, Hermione felt suspicious at the action, surely then, he was Marked? Draco seemed to have steeled himself and held out his left arm for another Auror to inspect. "Ah! Got a Glamour on it, powerful one, but knew we'd catch you...er..." The Auror had gone green after seeing what he had uncovered on Draco's arm. Hermione herself felt sickened and clutched her
Draco woke up gasping from a nightmare about the manticore attack. It had been from Harry's perspective. Draco climbed into Harry's bed and held the dark haired man to his jumper clad chest as he sobbed, the frame of the bed shaking with the intensity of his grief.
"We shouldn't have been used to it by then either," Ron's hoarse words joined in, "We shouldn't have had to go after Quirrell at eleven. We shouldn't have had to deal with a basilisk at twelve."
Harry's tears continue to fall steadily, he automatically draws his knees up to his chest and curls into a ball. Harry remembers passing days in his cupboard in this position and sobs again. He hasn't felt as helpless as this in a long time.
"Er, what?" Harry looked around and found Molly being tended to by a concerned Hermione and an amused Draco.
Draco breathed out heavily into Harry's hair, "Look Potter," Harry stilled, he was Potter when Draco was mad at him or trying to make a strong point, "Everything that has ever happened has culminated in you defeating old Snake Face. It had to happen exactly as it did for us to get to the point where you would willingly cuddle up with me and live with my mum and aunt." Harry smiled against Draco's throat, "I still can't believe your family lives with me." Harry had explained before - badly - to Draco how he'd just known that they were
Harry watched the sun drop behind the hill, fiery light colouring everyone to look like Weasleys and grinned at the family gathered in the garden. Draco squeezed his hand,
Harry raced back over to Andromeda and Narcissa, both of them granting him a small smile. Harry felt the monster in his chest puff up, he was Teddy's godfather and Harry wouldn't let him grow up like he had. He was determined he would be a loving and present godfather. He was going to have a good relationship with Andromeda and Narcissa, and Draco too. Harry began wondering where Draco had disappeared to. He suddenly spotted a shock of blonde hair over near the wall, and bristled with irritation. Draco had his godson and was talking quietly to Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini.
Harry has no idea what to do further, so he does the only thing he can think of and Apparates away to St. Mungo's.
Harry turns again and Disapparates to the Ministry, landing in the foyer. He strides off to the elevator bank, pressing the button for the Magical Law Enforcement floor.
Neville stood up and whooped, "Yeah! That's my girl!" Ginny had faked out the Keeper and scored her fifth goal. Draco turned to Harry, "Thank God I wasn't the Keeper for Slytherin against that girl, would have destroyed my ego after a week honestly." Harry smirked at him, "Yeah, you just had to lose the Snitch to me every time we played." Draco rolled his eyes and gripped Harry's wrist again,
Harry blew her a kiss, taking a healthy bite out of the muffin. It didn't taste quite as good as usual, but his tastebuds had been off lately.
I hate this bed. We've only been at Hogwarts a month and I can't remember why I agreed to come back. I'm in a room with Malfoy, Seamus and Justin. It's not the same. Well, I guess Dean is in here too, judging by the whispers and giggles from Seamus' bed before he cast the Silencing Charm. I miss Ron and Hermione sleeping with me. I know they love me, but they love each other too... It's all different.
Healer Gurjeet stood casting spells and adjusting potion dosages for ten minutes before placing a hand on Harry's wrist, "Harry, I know it feels like there is no way forward, but you're strong enough to recover from this. There's not much more I can do here. I'll see you later, Marcie." The medi-witch waved and continued to monitor the vitals.
Looking up at a sudden commotion at the doors, Draco observed a group of Aurors coming towards him and his mother, led by Kingsley Shacklebolt. Draco tensed, but knew this had been coming. He nodded calmly their way, accepting his fate, hoping they'd be lenient on his mother. Narcissa was not Marked and had only been concerned with keeping her family safe and whole. Kingsley drew up in front of him, "Mr. Malfoy, Mrs. Malfoy, we'll need you to come with us. Please surrender your wands." Draco stood and immediately handed his mother's wand to the nearest Auror. He turned to help his mother to her feet, she leaned into him heavily but closed her face into a regal mask. "We come willingly," were the first words he had spoken in an hour.
"Maybe in a few weeks, Teddy. Not right now," Andromeda sounded disappointed. Harry wanted to object that he was fine, but he was still having troubles eating or keeping the house clean.
The living room Floo shone violently green, Hermione and Pansy stepped through into the room and looked at Harry warily.
"Mate, it feels like you're already gone. I don't want you to die. I miss Fred. I've never seen you like this, it's like you're a shadow of yourself. I need you around, mate," Ron's voice was rough.
Draco gave Harry a complicated look, "Yes, well. That was after the second time I caught you with another man in our bed and told you to go to hell."
Ginny had died before reaching St. Mungo's, the curse was swift and destructive. Harry would regain sight in his left eye eventually, his left arm had mostly been regrown and he had been in a magically induced coma for five weeks. The Potter kids were subdued, Draco had taken them to his new home in the Cotswolds. Scorpius had Lily clutching one hand and Albus holding the other. James waited until Hermione had finished, scooped up Minty and left the room, followed by a concerned looking Rose. Hugo had brought a book and was studiously ignoring the emotional atmosphere.
Harry sinks to his knees, sobbing, "Please, I was cursed yesterday at work and then I wake up today and there's a strange man in my house and Hermione and Ron don't live in their flat and Ginny hates me and I'm not an Auror anymore. Please, help me, something must be wrong."
The next floor up had a sizeable library and what Harry startlingly identified as a cinema room, as well as another washroom. Draco gaped at the screen on one wall, wondering what the purpose of the room was. It was filled with low, comfortable looking lounges and more pillows than he'd ever seen.  The fourth floor held Sirius and Regulus' rooms. Harry sadly explained who the two men had been, Draco didn't think Kreacher would expect Harry to want to sleep in either of the rooms.
Draco sighs and pulls a box out of his pocket and flicks it across the table to Harry. He opens it and sees the ring he'd bought for Draco just after Christmas 1999. The gold band had been engraved with Celtic lover's knots, Harry had seen it by chance when out in Muggle London and thought it perfect for Draco.
Dozing in the Hospital Wing, he'd heard Hermione yell at Harry for nearly killing him. Draco was sure his heart had broken as soon as he had it confirmed that Harry was the one who had cast the final blow on him. He couldn't believe Harry hated him so much. It had been a week since Draco was attacked, and Madam Pomfrey had promised he could leave the next morning. His bruises were yellowing, his ribs had been repaired and his swollen eyes were back to normal.
Andromeda cleared her throat and reminded everyone that it was indeed, very late, and perhaps they should head home and let Draco rest. Hermione followed Ron out the door, glancing back at Draco and Harry as she left, already in their own bubble again, and smiled.
"Lucius gave that to me to indicate his seriousness in courting me. Draco has always admired it. He will know the depth of your feelings and intentions." Narcissa's words were shaky at the end and Harry found his own eyes prickling with tears.
"Wait - I love you." Harry had both hands on Draco's chest and looked up at Draco's patrician features in fear. He needed to hear Draco say it back.
"It was subtle, at first. It was understandable when you couldn't be affectionate, you didn't know us. You didn't want to sleep in the same room with Draco at all. Over time though..." Hermione looked to Ron.
Draco gasped and his arms wrapped tight around Harry, pushing him back against the closed door. Harry thought he was going to combust he was so aroused, until it kicked up a notch when Draco's erect cock pressed along the length of his own. Their kisses turned into shared breath and brushing tongues while they furiously rutted together, it all coming to a climax sooner than Harry would have liked.
"Living room," Harry hurried ahead of them and placed the box on the coffee table. Draco and Luna hoisted the Pensieve onto the table beside it, Hermione casting a Strengthening Charm on the table as it groaned under the weight.
- literally 'five years of pain'. Causes the cursee to lose all their memories and act out of character for five years. They questioned the smugglers, one of the witches remembered the gem. She said it was an old curse, designed to hurt enemies of Dark Magic practitioners. The gem belonged to my dearest Aunt Bella as it turns out. Mother remembers Rodolphus gave her a box of gems which was heavily warded on their wedding day, she suspects that's how Bellatrix had it."
Draco leaned in and pressed a kiss to Harry's cheek, "You need to wake up, Harry. I don't want to be anyone else's partner. Don't be selfish, Potter."
Ron skipped over to Hermione, who was talking to Kingsley nearby and interrupted their conversation to regale her of the new plans.
Harry yawned and stared out the window. A cold and dry February had turned into a miserably chilly and wet March. He was curled up on Draco's bed with Pansy and Luna. Luna was twisting conjured flowers into Draco's hair while he sat on the floor reading. Ginny was gushing about her new Harpy robes which had arrived that morning on Neville's bed, her back resting against Neville's chest. Neville looked like he had never been more content, just smiling to himself and staring at the rain thrashing the dormitory window. Pansy was flicking through a Muggle magazine, Cosmopolitan. Harry had been shocked when he saw the magazine in her hands. Pansy shrugged and told him Muggle clothes were cuter.
Draco's throat felt swollen as he fought back tears, he moved his hand to squeeze Ron's shoulder, "He'll be up there with you. There's no one he'd allow to take that place."
Ron shook his head, "I've never seen you like this, it's like you're a shadow of yourself. I need you around, mate."
Harry was sulking, trying not to look at Draco, seated with George and Ron, arguing about their Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. He rocked Teddy's new cradle with his foot, angrily regarding Hermione reading by the fire. She and Draco had come back from Australia thick as thieves, Ron loved Draco, and George and Ginny had accepted him into their mischief making trio as if he had orange hair and freckles. Harry wished Ginny was here, she would be cooing over Teddy and talking to Harry about the different outfits they could be dressing him in now the weather was cooling. Ginny and Neville were spending the last week before returning to Hogwarts visiting Augusta Longbottom, who had retired to Italy at the start of July.
"Well, Minty calls you Daddy and Draco never corrects her..." James looked to Minty, who was snoring loudly in his arms.
"It's hard not to be angry at you, the you we've had for five years," Hermione said, "I know for you it's been like three days since you were cursed."
The monster in his chest was quieter now, but still stretching its muscles and preening. "Duck your head again," Draco advised before scrubbing his fingers through Harry's hair. "Good, your hair is clean, time for the rest of you." Harry blushed again. Draco had grabbed a soft cloth from the pile of linen at the end of the tub, dipping it in the water and choosing another tap he turned back to Harry. Harry tensed as Draco began softly scrubbing him, soothing the ache in his shoulders and washing the blood from his arm. Draco stared at Harry before placing a cautious hand on the crackled starburst scar on his chest. "Is this...?" Draco looked at Harry with trepidation, Harry nodded and placed a hand over Draco's. "Yeah, he got me again the noseless twat." Draco's face immediately perked up and he laughed.
"Thank you. And the rest of you lot, for supporting this." Harry swallowed heavily, trying to dispel the lump in his throat.
Harry nodded, he'd always suspected Theo had a crush on him. He avoided hanging out with him and Draco because of it. Draco had told him he was crazy and that Theo was just a bit shy.
"If the most evil wizard in recent history couldn't do Potter in, I doubt some oversized cat with a pointy tail can manage it," Draco's drawl masked his concern.
Ron clapped him on the shoulder, "Excellent, mate, we can have our Sunday scrimmages here!" Bill had joined them and laughed at Ron's delighted squeal.
"I can't even eat Molly's pies anymore," Harry sighed, "And she makes the best steak and kidney pie."
"I'm not swapping beds, you shouldn't have to sleep in my sweaty sheets," Harry raised a brow, amused.
Harry placed his empty bottle on the counter and grabbed another drink for himself. Ron was still halfway through his first drink.
He stepped through the Floo to Healer Gurjeet's office and slumped into the armchair he'd come to resent.
Harry sighed and stared down at his bony wrists, he reminded himself to eat more. Draco was always on him to eat three wholesome meals a day.
had the same idea and cast a Stunning Spell at Mr. Nott at once. The combination of the spells has put the young man into a serious magical coma, he's here in St. Mungo's under Auror guard until he wakes up." Draco nodded, Kingsley muttered something at this point that sounded rather like, "Not that Aurors are good enough for
- while Draco rallied and spoke again, "As head of House Malfoy, I would like to formally apologise to you all for the offences committed against your family by my father, mother and myself. It was unconscionable to behave so abhorrently to you, who are family in blood and magic, and I offer unconditional allegiance to the House Weasley and its Heirs from this day until my last." He had bowed his head at the last sentence.
Harry didn't think anyone had noticed but himself, but he caught Scorpius' eye and suppressed a laugh when Scorpius winked at him. Harry was making a note to speak to Scorpius about it when an owl landed in the tureen of peas, upending it over the table and greatly disturbing Minty, who hated peas with a passion.
"Oh, well. Maybe take one of those really long baths you never get anymore?" Harry couldn't help but lower his voice and whisper, "Enjoy one of those books you pretend you don't buy."
Hermione pressed a kiss to Harry's nose, a gesture echoed by Ron, both of them wishing Draco a good night.
Hermione was in tears, she laughed, "So, you're not cheating on me and you didn't get into a fight with Draco? You've been so weird!" Ron quirked a sheepish smile, "You're so smart, love. I thought you'd look me in the eye and work out that Draco and I had gone to buy a ring just from looking at me." Hermione threw her arms around Ron and kissed him hard. "Ronald Weasley, I love you. Of course it's a yes!" Hermione heard a cheer go up behind her, everyone had quietly gathered just outside the back door and had watched the proposal. Everyone was cheering and smiling at her and Ron. Except for Harry, who was looking at Draco like Ron had looked at her.
"Harry! Harry please wake up!" Hermione was sobbing, "Harry, c'mon you've been sleeping for days. Ever since you were stung you've been slipping away and you can't - you can't!"
Harry will never forget the parallel his mind drew between the despondent Draco Malfoy that night and the miserable figure from his sixth year at Hogwarts, crying in a girls bathroom to a ghost. Draco was sat so far forward on the chair he was in danger of tipping off, his focus on the door which Harry assumed hid his wife from view. Harry didn't greet them, he just sat down next to Narcissa, leaned his head against the wall and closed his eyes. Narcissa nudged him an hour later and (somehow) communicated to Harry with a tilt her head and an eyebrow quirked that he should fetch them some refreshments.
Harry grabs some jeans and a shirt off the floor and races down the hall to the bathroom there. He locks himself inside and steps into the shower, scrubbing himself frantically. Harry catches sight of a tattoo on his leg and stares.
. You were a Gryffindor and the defeater of the most evil wizard since Grindelwald. Stop being so bloody cowardly!" Narcissa's tone was both forceful and pleading.
Hermione arrived with Harry's spare pair of glasses, six children in tow (Harry's three, Draco's son and her own two) and a grave expression. Ginny and Harry had been out for their twentieth anniversary dinner when they were attacked by the wife of a potions dealer that Harry had taken down some seven years earlier. The man had lost his last appeal to escape spending the rest of his life in Azkaban and killed himself. His wife was driven mad in her grief and attacked Harry and Ginny, before killing herself when the Aurors tracked her down.
Hermione's arm though - I don't think I'll be able to get the image of that dangling from the breakfast table out of my head ever again. Definitely going to have to talk to Parvati or Padma about vegetarianism. They're Indian too, so it's probably something I should have known about anyway. Fuck, I feel dizzy. I just have to get to our room, I can shower and lay down. God, I feel weak...
"She was a wolf he turned, she could turn like he could, without the moon," Draco shivered, thinking of the monster. "Father gave the Aurors what they needed to track down the remaining Death Eaters, but he forgot about Anja. She wasn't Marked, she was just vicious."
Draco rubbed his arm absently. It had been Greyback who had carved the slurs about Draco's sexuality on his arm, the deepest one after he refused to identify Harry in the Manor. Greyback mocked Draco and implied that he wanted to be Potter's bitch. Draco hadn't told Harry that part. They had been barely speaking since the night that Draco had told Harry and Ron about his and Hermione's night out in a pub. Harry visibly shutting down at Draco's gleeful description of the cute surfer who had kissed Draco after hearing his posh accent.
"You're so thin, are you eating? Are you drinking enough water? When was the last time you properly slept?" Molly pressed her hand against his forehead, checking for fever, before brushing her fingers through the limp hair hanging in his face.
Harry grabbed her shoulders and pulled her into a hug, "Gin, I love you, I do, but I don't, er, I love you like I love Hermione I think." Hermione smiled at this, she knew how hard it was for Harry to express emotional sentiments out loud. Ginny pulled Harry tighter and then held him back so she could look at his face, he started to mumble something about being friends. Ginny smiled, and gently let go of Harry. "How about family? I mean... You're basically our brother, Harry. I think if Mum had her way years ago she would have adopted you properly, but Dumbledore told her you had to remain with your family."
Draco opened the wrapping, tucking the paper into his pocket and opened the lid. His expression was unreadable as he stared at the pendant and it spurred Harry into speaking.
She stopped short on the back step. The yard was filled with twinkling fireflies, orbs of conjured light strung around the trees, pulsing soft blue to lilac and back again. Ron had his back to her and turned when he heard her approach. Hermione registered the blush on his face and then gasped as he dropped to one knee, taking her hand in his. "'Mione. Hermione. I'm not good with words like you. But you make me feel like I'm the smartest, kindest bloke alive. When I'm with you, everything is better. You've always been the best of the three of us. I know you're going to have a really impressive career, so I'm hoping you'll let me be the one you come home to after a day of changing the world. Marry me?"
Narcissa gave him a stern look for interrupting so rudely before continuing, "I told him that you would never look at another woman after Ginevra. He believes your interest in men is theoretical because you never date."
"Honestly, Dad, you're so bloody obvious." Lily rolled her eyes and shared an amused look with Hugo.
Harry opened the lid to find a simple platinum chain with a circular pendant engraved with a ouroboros. The eye of the serpent was a diamond and it glinted in the warm light of the library. "It's very nice."
"Thank goodness, I needed a break from sitting. Did you see Hermione blush when Ronald gave her that present? My money is on lingerie or something dirty." Draco stretched his lithe form and took Harry's offered arm as they set off down the lane behind the house.
The room emptied slowly, with Dean and Seamus stopping to talk to Sergeant Parrish before leaving. Hermione was in Ron's arms, his head atop hers and his hands running a soothing rhythm over her back. Harry shuffled awkwardly before stepping up to Draco and holding out his hand.
"Yes, Luna has me in every two days for a session though," Harry mumbles, cleaning up the smashed mug with a Reparo.
Ron twitched nervously to Hermione's left, startling when Fleur offered him a plate of pumpkin pie. Hermione was concerned. Ron had been distant for the last two weeks, he could barely look her in the eye or have a full conversation with her. Draco eyed him sternly from across the room where he sat braiding Ginny's hair and talking to her and Harry about the Quidditch trial Ginny was going to have with the Holyhead Harpies. Hermione didn't think Ron would ever cheat on her, but he was acting so oddly that she knew he was keeping something from her. Something to do with Draco. She was worried, maybe Draco and Ron had a fight? They had gone to Hogsmeade with Harry and Luna two weeks ago while she updated Kingsley on her Map project. Harry and Luna hadn't mentioned anything untoward, Luna had said, "Ronald is just experiencing the effects of Nargles from the mistletoe decorations. Perhaps his head will clear after Christmas?"
Draco inhaled sharply and nodded with wide eyes. Harry leaned in to press a gentle kiss against Draco's mouth, before sighing happily and pressing his forehead to Draco's.
Molly's Christmas morning spread was as glorious as ever, supplemented by Narcissa and Andromeda's delicate pastries and Ron's luxurious cinnamon rolls.
"Minister Shacklebolt kept it out of the papers," Draco's voice was bitter, "Didn't want the public to know there were more wolves like Greyback who could turn without the moon."
Narcissa drew herself up, "Alright, well, we have much to do, lets determine who will organise each task, it will be less overwhelming if we share the burden I think." Hermione nodded from the end of the table, she already had her quill hovering over parchment, restlessly waiting for something busy to do. Harry spoke up, "I'd like to help with everything. What I can do?" Narcissa smiled at Harry and Andy squeezed his hand. "Agreed, Harry. Hermione, I wonder if you and Ginny could contact the florists. Arthur, could you contact Kingsley for help with a secure location?" Harry settled into his chair, feeling finally that he had a real place in a family and smiled to himself.
"A bomb going off in your school after the battle that took place here," Sergeant Parrish sighed, "I don't think I'd feel safe coming back here."
The next day found Harry sitting next to Draco on a low bench, watching the Weasleys play a messy Quidditch game. It was snowing too hard for a Snitch, so they'd both opted out of playing.
Hermione put a hand on his arm, "Harry... Don't you think it's time to tell him?" He looked at her knowing brown eyes in fear,
Harry flopped back down, staring at the ceiling. It was mocking him, Harry was sure. The honey coloured wood was Draco's suggestion, before Draco ceased to be able to suggest anything at all ever again. Harry regretted not appreciating Draco more - before discarding the thought. He'd appreciated Draco immensely, he'd just never quite found the guts to
Draco sighed, "I only left once a day to shower and get new clothes. Molly's been feeding me and I've been sleeping on Arthur's old stretcher."
"You're a liar," Draco gripped his wrists and pulled him upright, "But we'll look past that. You're freezing, go have a shower and change."
"Believe it, I had to pick up the pieces of you telling Drommy that she was some money grubbing spinster who was clearly trying to con a 'celebrity' out of child support," Narcissa scolded. "Never mind that she has never asked you for a Knut!"
"Just generally being a massive cunt to everyone. We put up with it for a good year and a half. The wedding day and then the thing with Ginny pretty much sealed our family shutting you out," Ron supplies.
Draco was nervous about coming back to Hogwarts. He knew he had Harry, Hermione, Ron, Neville, Ginny, Luna, Pansy and Blaise who would support him, but he had done a lot of damage to the safety of the school. McGonagall had allowed him to return under the provision that he helped Madam Pomfrey by brewing potions for the Hospital Wing. He felt that it was barely a punishment, between his potions work for George and Madam Pomfrey, he was set on what he wanted his future occupation to be.
The woman gives Harry a look that reminds him of Aunt Petunia, "You will leave Draco alone. You've done enough to him for a life time."
Harry shrugged off his coat and sent it soaring over to the rack with a careless gesture before sweeping Minty into his arms and cuddling her. "They went to get some more things for dinner." Harry felt bad at the lie but didn't want to upset the four year old.
“Please tell me you don’t really think that,” Harry said, hugging him again. “Please tell me you believe that I came for you over this being some kind of death experience. Because, Draco, if you don’t believe that I’ve been looking for you for
“Oh, sure, right,” Harry said quickly, coming around the table and peering over Draco’s shoulder. “You’re in school again! How was the first day?”
“I want you to understand why I took Viola away from him,” he said firmly. “I’ll give you my memories, you can look at them in a Pensieve. And you have to watch them before you decide whether or not she’s going back there. Do you understand?” His voice was cold, and Harry was suddenly struck by the fact that Malfoy was asking him if he, Harry, understood terms of surrender, even though Malfoy was the one with a wand pressed to his throat. Scorching annoyance flickered in his gut. Fucking Malfoy.
Draco stepped back out into the hall, already hoping he could find Harry and share this buoyancy with him. As he walked back toward the living room, however, he noticed that the door to the bedroom that they now shared was slightly ajar.
“One of these days, Draco,” he said sweetly. “You’ll wonder why you held out for so long. Potter isn’t coming for you.”
Kingsley Shacklebolt was pacing back and forth before the fireplace. He broke into a smile when he saw Harry, but his eyes looked tired. “Thank you for coming back,” he said, clasping Harry’s hand warmly. “I’m sorry we’re not seeing each other under more pleasant circumstances.”
The carriage stopped before one of the grove’s entrances. Harry knew there were three other entrances spaced evenly around the circular structure, and guessed that Malfoy’s carriage would be pulling up to the entrance directly across from him. He had never actually been to a traditional British wizard wedding before – Bill and Fleur’s had been much more in the French style, which was closer to Christian Muggle weddings – but Ron and Hermione had filled him in, Ron drawing on personal knowledge and Hermione drawing on her extensive research.
Harry nodded back, hackles rising. “Minister.” He shot a glance at Draco, whose face was set in its impassive mask.
“I didn’t even know she had died until three months later,” Draco growled, turning around at last. His hand was clenched around his cup so tightly Harry thought the glass might break. “Warden called me into her office and told me and laughed. Then she gave me dozens of letters my mother had written to me during her illness, all increasingly panicked, asking me to respond, apologizing for pulling me into the Death Eaters, urging me to be strong. My mother died thinking I didn’t even care enough to write back.” He was breathing hard. Harry, on the other hand, couldn’t seem to take in even one breath. Malfoy’s raw grief, this sudden outpouring in their kitchen, was too much.
“Malfoy?” A loud voice said suddenly behind him. “What’re ye—” and then Hagrid was there, his arms full of leafy boughs and flowers and blessedly empty of Harry’s body. Draco stepped back reflexively, his fists clenching against the suspicion in Hagrid’s words.
“I—my sincere apologies,” Draco finally said, his voice low. “I had not thought to ask how you want to handle money. That—I’m sorry,” he finished. He sounded almost desperate. “Whatever you want to do, however you want to proceed, is fine—”
“How—” Draco cleared his throat. “I’m sorry, I didn’t ask you before how you would prefer to handle money. Should I be keeping track of how much I spend today?”
“Can someone please tell this uncultured clod why hair drying spells are necessary?” asked Draco to the group, and laughed as the rowdy chorus of responses drove Harry into the kitchen.
Malfoy turned to Harry. “Well Potter, let’s get on with it,” he said irritably. “Or is my punishment to stand here all night next to your labored mouth breathing?”
“Like torturing people,” Draco repeated, feeling emptiness yawn inside him. Before it could swallow him up, though, Harry was at his side. He curled into the warmth gratefully, and Harry kissed him on the cheek. Then he turned Draco’s face gently and kissed him on the mouth.
“There’s no one here,” Harry whispered, moving away from the last window. “Do you think we came to the wrong place? Shouldn’t Fairchild be here, if no one else?”
“Harry! Please lie down!” It was Hermione, her concerned eyes huge in the lamplight. “You were injured, you’re here at St. Mungo’s, you’ll be alright but you have to remain still and calm.”
“Oh it’s no trouble at all,” grinned the second man, coming up to stand beside the first. “Our pleasure, really.” Suddenly, he slapped Draco hard across the face. “Get him in the chains,” he growled.
Viola nodded, suddenly sober. “Are you coming?” She asked in perfect English. Harry hadn’t realized she spoke English that well.
“Alright,” Draco said slowly. “Thank you.” He turned back around and gathered his things, trying to regain a shred of dignity by taking his time.
“He showed me such riches, such glory,” Lucius murmured at one point while Draco hung upside down in his cell, gagged and rotating slowly, powerless to do anything but listen and try not to throw up. “He readied me, he readied the world. Now all I have to do is take it for myself.”
So Harry told him: about the stuffed dragon who liked to eat cookies, and the fact that Viola and Rose read books together before bed, and that Viola had discovered a deep love of Ron’s roasted radishes which, she told Harry, were little packages of sweet sunshine that came out of the oven. Malfoy laughed at that.
Harry laughed too. He hadn’t ever thought of that moment as something funny, but he saw it now, looking back alongside Draco.
“Oh – do they?” Draco suddenly felt like he was back in the Manor’s secret room, bringing food to Lovegood and Ollivander and avoiding their too-knowing looks. Lovegood was looking at him again now, her gaze suddenly shrewd. She leaned forward.
– before he slammed against the far wall. He felt his head hit brick with a sickening thud, then he felt nothing more.
“This was a public wedding, Harry,” Hermione reminded him gently. “Kingsley put his support behind it, Malfoy got out of Azkaban for it. This is your life, but it’s also public knowledge. I’m sorry,” she said quickly, backing up a few steps at Harry’s glare. “I don’t agree with it, obviously, but –” She turned to Ron. “Help me out here?”
“Whoa,” Harry said quickly, twisting so that he could get one hand on either of Malfoy’s shoulders. The other man’s eyes were fixed on his clasped hands, but his shaking stilled immediately. “Steady, Malfoy. It’s alright. We’re alright. They can’t get to you. They won’t hurt you.”
Harry followed her. He knew it was foolish, that his 20 minutes were passing quickly, but she might know something about Draco. He had to try.
“Actually, I don’t know. I’m very busy, you know.” He suddenly looked a little lost. “And you don’t have to. I mean, now that I’m out –”
Harry shrugged, feeling defensive, as he had each time this topic had come up. “You both heard what Kingsley said: this is a step towards reconciliation, truly, after all these years of divisions and old grudges. If someone from Dumbledore’s Army and a former Death Eater can get married and have a happy life together—it will give everyone else some kind of hope. Right?”
But no. He squashed that feeling at once. Hogwarts was not safe for him, should not be safe for him. Not after what he had done. He would do well to remember that.
Upon returning home, the men unpacked their purchases and got their showers for the evening, and laid on Harry’s bed, although Draco’s own had been delivered that day.
“No!” laughed Ginny. “That’s hysterical. I heard Ron griping about getting stunned in the bum, but not about
“So, yeah, Potter, the whole Pureblood world now knows that I’m a backside artist,” said Draco. “Harry, you don’t know what it’s like to be a Pureblood. They don’t like… sexual deviance.”
Harry was speechless. He sat down in a wobbly chair, broken springs pricking his arse. A smirk was gradually coming to Harry’s face. Draco uttered a cleanup spell, then flicked on the candles with his wand.
Draco moaned, “Okay.” Harry continued his ministrations until Draco was panting and covered in a fine sheen of sweat. “Now!” Harry pulled back and jerked Draco’s cock for a few seconds before it coated Harry’s chest. Both men grunted loudly.
“I haven’t started yet!” exclaimed Draco through tears. “Sorry. I hope this isn’t tacky. It’s heartfelt. I would like to ask the family if I could honor your loss by taking the middle name of Frederick… in memory of Fred, of course. He made me laugh a lot. I used to have to curse myself to keep from laughing at Fred and George.”
Oh, I forgot (doing a lot of that lately)… I HATE robes. They’re so… traditional. Uck! I bought a lot of perfectly fitting (not tight) clothes at Selfridges today. I think they make me look so fucking hot. Well, I’m not so hot right now. I’ve gotten nasty bags under my eyes from having so little sleep. My hair needs a good cut, but who’s going to touch a reformed Death Eater?
Hogwarts groundskeeper and Professor Rubeus Hagrid says this of Mr. Potter, “Leave ‘im alone! If it’s true, then I wish Harry all the best. If it’s not, I wish Harry all the best. He saved our world. Give the little guy a break, will ya?”
Harry introduced Draco to the wonders of public transit and department stores. Draco helped Harry with some spells to help carry around their purchases much easier than possible in the Muggle way. Harry returned to the flat with their purchases, then returned to Draco and took him out to a quality, relaxing dinner.
“He’s hot!” said Harry. “Luna, I didn’t even know that you knew Draco until he told me about his Wrackspurts.”
“Yes,” admitted Harry. He rolled onto his back and stared at the ceiling. “I’m no fan of the man. That doesn’t leave this room. It would be improper for the savior to oppose his supposed mentor.” Harry paused. “There’s another thing about Dumbledore. I’m sure you’ve heard of the prophecy. Well, there’s a lot more to it. When that old fraud Trelawney made the prophecy, she said, paraphrasing, ‘The person to vanquish Moldy would be a Wizard born at the end of July. Only one can survive in the end... Moldy or the savior.’ It did not say which.
“I suppose you’re right,” said Draco. He dressed, then pulled out a vial of clear liquid from his valise. He held it up to Harry. “Veritaserum.”
… Is that okay?” asked Harry. Draco nodded. “You’ve heard a lot of things that only you know. This one is also known to Ron and Hermione, but it should be kept between us. Your godfather is in it. Okay?” Draco nodded again.
Draco was the first to unzip his trousers. He pulled his hardening cock through the fly in his boxers. Harry unzipped his jeans and pulled them and his y-fronts down past his bum. Harry made sure not to let Draco see any of his scars. He was scared at how horrified Draco would be. That was for another day.
“Down the lane lived a magical young lad with long, greasy black hair, a big nose, and oddly fitting clothing. His name was Severus. He discovered Lily’s magical abilities and was enamored with her. Dare I say he loved her. Petunia was jealous that her sister was being admitted to an exclusive magical school, while she was relegated to ordinary schools and had no useful skills. This filled her with cruel and vile jealousy.
Harry laughed, “Oh, no reason. I just didn’t see you as the type of person to float along the corridors with Luna.”
After a minute, Harry rolled over and stared into Draco’s eyes. “I’m just a little overwhelmed. I’m better now. I didn’t want to cry in front of our guests.”
“Mother found and broke into my sketchbooks,” said Draco. “They are full of pencil and charcoal drawings of the incredibly sexy man with the lightening scar… my… fancy. Look, please. They’re on the table.”
“I know you can’t... but there is something else we can do. It might not be as pleasurable, but I hope it makes you happy.”
“I need to be honest... I can’t afford to stay here for very long,” said Draco with tears building in his eyes. “I’m just a poor former Pureblood with no dowry.”
As tears built up in Draco’s eyes, Harry kissed him on the cheek and said, “That was beautiful, my love.”
Neville Longbottom, longtime friend of Potter and son of famous aurors, says, “I don’t really know which way Harry goes. Who cares?”
“You are as much of a Death Eater as I am,” roared Harry. “These last ten months without you have been hell. I’ve been in love with you for a long time. You are the most attractive man I have ever known. I like how you carry yourself and your prickling attitude. Your witty repartee is charming. You have that annoyingly beautiful British stiff upper lip… Fuck. I can’t believe I’m telling you this. How do I not know you’re working for
“Now, go find a place to sleep, you rascally guy!” said Harry, hinting that Kreacher should leave them alone.
I’m back. We just had a wonderful visit from five aurors. It seems that mother and I are to testify on Monday. I hope to hell that I get a chance to see Harry. Maybe he and Luna can keep at least me out of that hell hole known as Azkaban. Lucius’s solicitor says that there isn’t a chance in hell that he’ll ever be freed. Good. At least I won’t get physically abused anytime soon… I hope.
“Thank you, Harry. I feel like I understand you so much better. More about me later. I’m worn out. Need time to think.”
It turned out that he did. We were off by ourselves and both of us said that we had thought about each other. A few days later we had sex. I remember afterwards saying to myself, “I guess I’m gay.” That did it. I was finally able to accept my true feelings. From that day forward I was not a “straight.”
Harry exited the Goblin bank with a small case. He walked up to a man in a dark cloak and whispered, “Who’s my favorite seeker?”
The thing that happened with Harry is looming over me. I cannot stop thinking of it. Who knew that one little hour could change me so much. I can’t believe it lasted a whole hour! Merlin! Harry has not contacted me yet... that is pissing me off... and I can't get the address him… He, of course, knows where I live… duh! The first and last time he was here wasn’t good, however. Damn!
Harry wrote back. He saw the owl’s emblem and sent him back immediately before he could be caught. Harry had to send that twat of a house elf of his, Kreacher. That little guy needs to be punished for his insolence and disobedience. And I thought I had a foul mouth! Oh well… at least I got the note. Harry’s being kept under constant security protection by the auror squad. Owls are not allowed through. He’s been giving his testimony to the Wizengamot. I guess this last year was quite busy for him. Harry’s going to see me as soon as he is able. There is an anti-apparition ward on the house. Luckily, most of those don’t prevent House Elves from apparating.
“Who gives a damn!?” exclaimed George. “Yeah, we’re Purebloods, except you and Hermione, but we hardly
I must say that what we did on that Tuesday was nice. I liked it. At first it was awkward. It was ok. I must say that it was a little odd kissing someone with five-o-clock shadow. I didn’t hate it. I never thought it would happen to me. Odd. I have thought about doing this and other things for a while, but never knew it would happen at this point in time. As I am writing this, I don’t know how you felt about it. After, you said it was fine. I definitely thought so. Yes, I do. (Note to self: next time I will try to be more careful with my teeth.) I didn’t want it to end. It was nice. Thanks for helping me talk about this and I think, right now, that I’m glad we tried something. I don’t know what to think or do now. I guess I have a few months to think about everything.
Okay, so that note ended up being a steaming pile of elephant dung. I’m too excited to make it into proper English. Well, this must be edited before publication. I’m just too fucking giddy… and too fucking tired of war.
“Fast,” said Harry. “Don’t worry, we’ll give it time. Please, let’s keep this between us for now. Um... just the four of us. Please. Follow me. Dinner’s ready.” They all migrated to the dining table and enjoyed a wonderful meal.
I can actually list all of the people in the magical community that are out. Actually, the “straights” call them “fucking faggots.” I hate that phrase. The term “openly gay” isn’t much better. I don’t know where the “straights” make up these STUPID titles. They (rich cunt Purebloods) teach you how to treat the NON-straight/NON-white/NON-Pureblood like shit. I even bashed myself because all I knew of poofdom was that it was not the societal “norm.”
“What fam—? Oh!” said Draco. “Well... how about this... Could we perhaps have Ron and Hermione over for dinner tomorrow? What were you planning?”
So… Me and Harry. That night he came to my room, he sat in the chair. I was standing in front of him. He asked, “So, what do we do?”
Harry got off the bed, stood up, and removed all his clothes. He stuck out his right index finger and motioned Draco to come closer to him. Draco did so and Harry turned around. Harry lit his wand and gave it to Draco so he could see the detail. Draco gasped and tears fell freely from his eyes.
“In time, Lily and James got married and had a son with very messy black hair and shockingly emerald-green eyes. A snake man killed the young boy’s parents, leaving the child with a special scar. The boy was left to his mother’s evil Muggle sister, Petunia and her nasty, abusive husband, Vernon. Remember, Petunia hated her sister and was green with envy, seeing her sister’s magical skills as deviant and wrong. This made Petunia hate the small child of her sister.
“I’ve come to understand that in the last few days,” said Draco. “You don’t know how much that means to me. How could
my choice to be gay or to fall in love with you. I’d rather be happy. I no longer have the love of the Pureblood ways, especially after Moldy’s actions. The snobbery is disgusting.” Draco paused, sobbing. “Hold me.”
“How’s he doing?” asked Draco. “I can’t imagine. It makes me sad, and I wasn’t related. I’ll tell you a secret… I used to have to hex myself to not fall down laughing at Fred and George’s antics. I was a closet Fred fan.” Draco paused. “Harry and I have put a three-day pause on reminiscing about the past, but I need to say this. I was fiercely jealous about the happiness of your family and the warmth of your friendships. I could only dream about being happy like that.
the scoop, but only if they promised not to run Rita Skeeter for two weeks. Harry took out a full front-page ad.”
Pansy blushed. “I’m sorry, Draco. I meant what I said, I’m only with my parents for the money. I know how awfully shallow that sounds, but it’s the truth.”
Draco was facing away from Harry. He kissed Harry’s hand, which was across his chest. Harry ran his hand through Draco’s hair, bringing his hand to skim Draco’s cheek. “You’re crying,” said Harry.
“Of course, dear,” replied Molly. “My brother was gay. He got killed the last time around. He owned the watch we gave you for your seventeenth birthday.”
Draco entered the room and sat on the side of the bed, within reach of Harry. “Hey,” he whispered. “Are you okay?” Draco rubbed Harry’s back with one hand.
One good thing came of today. Kreacher told me that his “Master Harry Potter” wishes to assure me that he desires my company. He also said that Harry will visit me when he’s able. I hope it’s soon. Merlin! Kreacher also said that Harry has come to many decisions and that he would like me to be in his life! I’m so fucking happy, I cried. Never done that before. I can’t give Harry a written response, so I’m hopeful that Kreacher gives him my oral message, “As do I!”
“Thanks, Kreacher,” said Harry. “I order you to call me Master Harry and him Mister Draco. I order you not to tell anyone where we are living. Draco and I are gay and are in a brand-new relationship. I order you to not tell anyone about our sexual orientation or that we are in a relationship. This is a Muggle building. Okay, Kreacher?”
“Draco, darling, would you consider getting a handle on my finances?” asked Harry. “They’re a mess. The estates are in a hundred different trusts, mostly administered by Ministry employees. There is also a question as to how many vaults I have. Kingsley sent me the relevant portions of my file. I would be honored if you would lead the effort.”
“Oh, Draco. Of course, I can. While I absolutely enjoy having adult relations... err... sex... with you, I don’t exactly have to do
“Moldy already had several horcruxes,” said Harry. “In the end, he had seven. His diary that Ginny and I discovered in my second year, Ravenclaw’s lost diadem, Hufflepuff’s cup, Slytherin’s locket, his snake, his grandfather’s ring, and me.
When Pansy came to, the kitchen held three extra occupants, Arthur Weasley, Ginny, and Luna. The latter two because of Harry’s patronus. Pansy slowly opened her eyes. She said, “Sorry, I just never thought I’d see the day when... when...”
Harry sighed, “Yeah. No one can fight off Veritaserum. We verified a lot of things late last night.”
Harry turned to stare into Draco’s eyes. Draco said, “I had no idea, of course. We are more similar than I ever thought. The... intensity... of our experiences is so... horrifyingly similar.”
“My mother died to save me. This gave me a powerful protection. It meant that the killing curse rebounded off me and hit him. Uh... um... Severus heard half of the prophecy when Trelawney gave it. That was why I was targeted by Moldy. Severus told Moldy of it to gain his favor.
“I’m sorry, love,” said Harry, hugging Draco and giving him a kiss on the cheek. Kreacher had finally arrived with the drinks. Harry stood up, handed them out, and said, “To new and renewed friendships.” They clinked glasses and took a sip of their drinks.
