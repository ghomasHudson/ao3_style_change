“I’ll compensate you for your time, whether or not you’re successful.” Potter spoke through gritted—non-existent—teeth.
Harry sighs. “The curse messed up my magical core. It was all tangled up with my organs, so my magic was strangling me. The healers disentangled it from most everything but my lungs. They couldn’t get that bit free without outright killing me. So now my magical core is wound up with my lungs, and that’s the way it will stay.”
Draco slid into him. Harry lay back, his defenses down. His heart thudded in his chest. Draco was in him completely, he could stop it beating if he wanted.
Also, he didn’t think he could handle kneading dough with Malfoy again. He was still rather confused about his feelings on that—and the conversation with Ginny hadn’t helped.
The next day, Harry returned to the attic. He levitated all of the oldest chests with their failing wards against one wall, all of the sheet-covered portraits against another, and everything from Sirius’s time to the other side of the room. There were odds and ends that didn’t quite fit into any of those categories, and Harry left those piles in a haphazard group in the center of the space.
Malfoy’s eyes flickered. “Cretin.” He produced a napkin, smoothed it out, and handed it to Harry. It was still warm from Malfoy’s pocket when Harry used it.
For a moment, Harry thinks Malfoy will demand a response. Then something in the other man flickers, and his gaze veers to the side. “Two in the morning! Well, that’s it.” And like that, he scoops up the cards and returns them to their box, then he’s standing. He holds a hand out to Harry. “Come on, then.”
Ginny met Malfoy’s eye as she placed her empty bottle on the little drink tray. Malfoy made a weird expression at her, eyes widening and narrowing at the same time. Before Harry could try to make out what was going on, Luna was bending to give him a kiss, too.
He was so beautiful on his knees, in only his vest and briefs. Harry licked his lips, said, “Not going to take off the rest?”
A bright bolt of magic shoots out of the dark. Harry has a wordless shield up in an instant, though nearly not in time. The spell glances off his knuckle, and he drops the phone with a clatter.
A screech calls Harry into the present. He pulls the kettle off of the hob and pours the water over the loose leaf tea Luna gave him. Steam billows up suddenly and violently and clears just as quickly. In that moment of clarity, Harry realizes that the twist in his stomach is shame. He
Those went into the oven in a dizzying pattern that Harry was just starting to get a hang of. He had just maneuvered the last of the trays into the oven when Malfoy cast a Tempus above him. It was already nearly six in the morning.
Potter scowled. “Sorry, Malfoy. Not everyone has the ability to tune out of the world for eight hours a night. I’ve been awake for months. I’m fidgety. Deal with it.”
“I don’t know, Potter. Last I truly remember, you were beating down my front door in your finest auror robes.”
There was actually one thing left that he hadn’t done yet. He went to one of the spare rooms they had finished early on in the repairs and knelt in front of a cabinet. Tapping his finger against the door, he muttered the unlocking spell.
“I can, indeed. But will I?” His gaze follows Harry’s as Harry throws a look over his shoulder. “What is it that has you so twitchy on my doorstep? Are you afraid of being followed? Or is it that your conscience is catching up to you? Will it round the corner in a moment?”
Ginny barked a laugh. She didn’t say much after that, and didn’t seem to expect him to, either, which was something he appreciated about her. She could be relentless when she wanted to be, but she could pick up on a person’s mood.
Surely this is punishment. His first case back in the “field” is sending him straight back to his desk to trawl a small ocean of useless evidence. The situation gets even better when Harry scans the files Robards dumped on him and realizes they are, in fact, the inventory of the evidence. The actual evidence is archived. But he’ll be damned if he’ll complain. He bites his tongue all the way down to Records—he walks there, taking every staircase, because he needs to
“Malfoy. Hey. Hi.” He runs a hand through his hair and blinks the stickiness from his eyes, runs the back of his hand surreptitiously over his mouth to catch any drool.
This time, Malfoy levitated the trays into the ovens himself, glancing at the large clock above them as he did so and casting a number of Tempus Charms to float over each. The trays went in smoothly, as if they were good friends settling into place together in a well-rehearsed play. It hit Harry at that moment, watching Malfoy’s look of concentration and the fine shimmer of sweat on his face, that Malfoy did this every morning. Surely he had someone to help him, though? Perhaps another wizard or witch?
Harry smiled. The little paper Draco pulled one last tray of biscuits from the oven and gave the small Teddy a sideways hug, then the cutouts drifted flat, their voices went silent, and the lab was quiet once more.
Malfoy crosses his arms. “Are you questioning me, Potter? Directly after handing me that summons to be interviewed at the Ministry under the
“Hmm.” Draco gives him a mock-suspicious look, but his smile is fond. Harry wonders if Draco knows just how fond.
Harry wasn’t quite sure what Draco had been referring to, so he didn’t say anything, only settled next to him. The bed
“Oh. Here,” Harry said, pulling the slip of paper Luna had given him from his pocket. He read the letters and numbers off. “Maybe we could ask at the desk?”
Luna waited for him near the edge of the forest and the Erumpent’s field, next to the faint oil sheen of the wards. She had told Harry that the wards kept anything not human from passing—mainly the Erumpent, though it limited the traffic of non-magical creatures, as well. Apparently, the Erumpent did not take kindly to coyotes and goats wandering into its field.
Ron nodded. “You’re family. I bet Dad would be happy to help, too. And Mum. She’s dying to have a go at your kitchen.”
She must notice because she says, “I’m sure whatever it is, you’ll find the right thing to do.” Her lips quirk in a rare cheeky grin. “You’re Harry Potter.”
Harry decided that the cottage pie was more important, so he dropped the topic in favor of taking a bite. It was really good—the beef moist and rich, the potatoes slightly crispy on top with a crust of melted cheese.
Harry came downstairs to the sound of voices. Ginny’s and—someone who wasn’t Luna, but familiar. The familiarity hit Harry strangely, unexpectedly, with a pang of surprise. He went into the kitchen.
Harry glanced at Ginny, who was smirking now. She said, “I think it’s a great idea.” At Luna’s beaming smile, she added, mouth full, “Did you enjoy the shop? Maybe you can be a barista.”
Harry shrugs. He could say “it’s not your fault,” but he doesn’t. It wouldn’t be a lie, but it wouldn’t be the truth.
He had to admit, it was nice to perform magic in front of someone; he’d been too long with muggles. He watched Potter track the movement of his wand with no small amount of satisfaction. Draco set the wand down on the table in full sight and easy reach—something he would never do if Potter were able to grasp it—and suppressed the little smile that tugged at his lips. “That reminds me. What of your magic?”
Malfoy kissed him. It was softer than their last kiss, and brief. No tongue. Just Malfoy’s moist lips and breath.
And before Harry knew it—before he could shake out of his thoughts and leave Malfoy to his rhythm in the shop—Malfoy looked up and met his eye again. He didn’t make a face this time. He turned to the woman, said something, and she nodded. He came around the counter and approached Harry’s table.
He leaves Harry’s door open. Harry stares through it at the bulletin board with its waving, winking photographs, animated notes, and the little doodle of the panda eating the words from office memos and shitting a line of broken poetry. With a sigh, Harry stands and closes it.
Harry’s not sure of the emotion that flickers across Malfoy’s features this time. Suspicion, but—not just. Something closer to startlement. Then he steps back and holds the door open. With one last glance at the country lane, Harry steps inside.
“I wouldn’t expect it to. It’s a non-magical establishment. Though you never know these days. They’re doing clever things with screens and waves.”
Draco was the one who’d thought of making a gift for Teddy that held memories Teddy could relive and enjoy for the rest of his life and even pass on to his own children, if he had any. Harry suspected Draco had got the idea from a conversation they’d had late one night about Harry’s lack of pleasant Christmas memories from early childhood. They’d both been a little drunk at the time, and Harry had waxed poetic about how he wanted Teddy to have something nicer to look back on. A few days later, as they worked on their Christmas gift list—Draco was always very organized about these things—Draco suggested making some kind of memory record for Teddy.
Harry sensed a barb but didn’t know how to respond to that. “But—Pansy. In Oregon? What was she doing here?”
She made him wash his hands twice. When she was apparently satisfied with their level of cleanliness, she showed him how she made a brulee coffee.
Their orders arrived in a billow of salty steam and clinking porcelain. Harry didn’t like his very much. He pushed the overdone steak around the eggs on his plate while Malfoy told him about the first time he’d ordered from a non-magical restaurant; to begin with, neither Ginny nor Pansy told him that you couldn’t order by tapping on the menu, “So naturally, when the waitress arrived and I told her I’d already ordered, she was confused. You’d think Ginny or Pansy would have said something
A laptop sat in front of her on the kitchen table. And on the screen of the laptop were Hermione and Ron.
He found Luna by the barn. “Good morning, Harry!” she said. She waved her wand, and the half dozen buckets hovering behind her lined themselves up on the ground next to her. “Did you sleep well?”
Harry spends the next three days going through it. Every piece of correspondence, every bloody floo call. Robards was right. It’s all disgustingly, suspiciously innocent—almost mockingly so, in fact. Seed catalogues. Receipts for locally-made pottery. Recorded calls with Narcissa Malfoy full of sparkling laughter and airy conversations about the French countryside. Owl post filled with glossy photographs, tins of tea, and evergreen-flavored Bertie Bott’s Beans.
Potter also had no ability to taste or smell. Honestly, Draco thought it was a wonder he could see or hear.
Harry’s heart lifted as a small replica of Draco soared over a tiny Teddy and Harry, dodging a sphere of compressed cotton meant to look like a charmed snowball-cum-bludger. The first time Harry saw one of their creations after completing it was always a revelation for him. No longer exhausted from crafting it or frustrated by wrestling with wonky spellwork, he could see it with fresh eyes, the way it would (hopefully) appear to Teddy. In this case: as an enchanting paper model of their afternoon spent playing snow-quidditch, with a flash of gold foil criss-crossing the scene to represent the snitch.
It wasn’t a short journey, and he had to make it a total of four times. Each time he saw a little group of snakes off, he returned to where Luna was trying her best to keep the newest hatchlings contained and had to start the process all over. He also had to spend time convincing the stragglers to keep up, and locate any snakes that had wandered off from the nest before he could get to them.
Draco crossed his arms. “I’m going to take that as the compliment I’m sure you meant it to be. For your information, I did have plenty of other things planned for my day. Shall I list my responsibilities for you? But the sooner I solve your problem—or exhaust the possibilities—the sooner I can have you out of my hair. Does that satisfy?”
Harry listens and nods, bemused, and Malfoy occasionally throws him a wry look, like he knows Harry is only humoring him, but he keeps up the stream of conversation anyway. The truth is, Harry likes the sound of him talking. When he isn’t sharpening his voice to cut glass, or twisting it to throw petty insults, it’s quite pleasant. Deep with maturity and almost lyrical.
Then he tore a piece of the onion off with his fingers, swirled it in the sauce, and popped it in his mouth.
What did he do before Malfoy’s case? A lot of paper-pushing, but Robards took him off all of that so he could focus on the investigation. He sits down with the original case file and flips through it again, this time more slowly, with an eye to the missing information. The complete file still hasn’t come up from Records, he notes sourly. But knowing the full story now—or more of the full story, in any case—Harry can begin to fill in the details himself.
They stood in a loose circle around the tree. To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy stood directly to his right, and Parkinson took up a spot between Ginny and Luna. He tried not to be distracted by Malfoy as Luna gave them directions for softening the summer-hard soil and removing the roots of the tree, but he couldn’t help but track the movement of Malfoy lifting a hand to push back his windblown hair every so often from the corner of his eye.
“I’m back in the field,” he admits, and at her shift in expression, hastily adds, “For a case that shouldn’t involve any heavy casting.”
Malfoy bit his lip. Suddenly, he seemed so fragile there beneath Harry. Harry leaned down on one arm, pressed a kiss to Malfoy’s mouth, and slid his other hand down to tease around Malfoy’s hole the way Malfoy had done to him—circling, circling, brushing over his entrance. He had the urge to taste Malfoy down there, but it wasn’t what Malfoy had asked for, so he traced his finger around and watched Malfoy’s eyes flutter closed.
Last night, after leaving Ron and Hermione’s, a restless need to find something spurred him out into muggle London, where he rented a computer at an Internet cafe. There, over an ill-advised cup of coffee, he searched for news of the town where Poesy Potions bases its operations. He found nothing on Poesy by name, of course, but a search yielded results about its muggle alter ego. To his surprise, Perfect Products—as it calls itself—manufactures muggle goods, as well. Largely ointments for livestock.
And for the life of him, Harry didn’t know if she was agreeing that it was literally magical or “magical” as a turn of phrase.
He takes a deep breath. “How likely is it for someone to recover from being obliviated? I mean, badly obliviated. Memories wiped and replaced.”
No, though. Apparently, he’d just spent so much of the last twenty years in the wizarding world—the Ministry, Grimmauld, magical districts and neighborhoods—that the Muggle world had moved on without him. He passed groups of people standing around, tapping at touchscreen computers. A security guard on some kind of upright scooter that glided by, silently.
Ginny snorted into her teacup. She took a drink and looked off at the garden, but there was a little smile at the corner of her mouth.
Heather interrupted Malfoy to say, “Latte,” as casual as could be, as if it were natural to throw orders at Malfoy, and Malfoy said, “Coming up.” He flipped a cup from a small stack of them. Then he was stuffing a rag into his back pocket and filling up the special grinder that Harry wasn’t supposed to touch. He tamped the grounds down in a little long-handled metal cylinder, which made the muscles of his forearm stand out, then loaded the cylinder into one of the machines. While two steady streams of thick black espresso dripped into the coffee cup, he poured milk into a small pitcher to steam.
Draco slid a hand into Harry’s boxers. “You.” Gripped Harry’s erection. “I couldn’t die before you. That’s one game I won’t lose. I have to survive you, because in the end,
Dinner arrives, and she departs. Harry tucks into this evening’s mush. The image of Malfoy is still there in his mind, blinking and squinting in the courtroom with that little frown on his face.
“They’re just memories, Malfoy. They happened to you, too. Or are you afraid about what you’ll learn?”
It was clean and appealing and very Muggle. A short queue had formed in front of the counter, where a child stood on tiptoe to peer into a glass case of pastries. Little bags of coffee lined the neighboring shelf.
“This conversation you came to engage me in. It’s scintillating. Utterly engaging. I can’t believe I’ve been missing out in such intellectual dialogue. We should do this more often, you and I.”
His voice is rough. “So what you’re saying is that I shouldn’t even be here now. Are you going to obliviate me, too? Robards already suggested I submit my pensieve memories of the investigation.” He meets Hermione’s gaze head-on and knows he’s being unfair. Knows from the pained look in Hermione’s eyes that he’s struck a chord by calling up the guilty memory of her parents; they are back to themselves after years of rehabilitation, though they still have memory issues.
“The buck,” Ginny said, indicating a buff goat a hundred feet off with long curving horns. Harry looked at the dented building and gave a low whistle when he realized what Ginny meant.
the dough, it’s done nothing to harm you; wrap it in a Cooling Stasis and set it aside for twenty minutes to rest before you try rolling it out again,
“I see,” Malfoy says, tone perfectly polite. “For what, pray tell? If you’re looking for etiquette, you’ll find plenty of that here.”
They worked for a while to the sounds of dough against the tabletop. Then Malfoy spelled the radio on, and the kitchen was filled with a lively violin melody. Harry bit back a comment about “seducing” the bread with romantic music.
A tower of clay pots had been knocked to the ground, spilling soil and yellow honking daffodils across the cobbles. The daffodils trumpeted their distress.
But Alex is already pushing away from the door frame, and Harry doesn’t say any of that. “Good luck with that.”
He followed the smell of coffee to a small shop at the side of the terminal, where he ordered a medium-sized caffe mocha and tried not to stare at the tall barista as he made the drink. Fortified with caffeine and chocolate, he found his way to the Apparition point.
The door to the oven had barely been shut before Malfoy was clearing away the mess from making biscuits and calling a number of new ingredients.
Malfoy looked at it and then met Harry’s eyes, and a feeling of déjà vu struck Harry. He was eleven again, standing on the train. Before Harry could look too closely at the memory, Malfoy clasped Harry’s hand—his own was warm and a little moist—and then the feeling of Apparition hooked Harry around the gut and yanked him sideways.
His stomach twisted, and before he knew it, he was folding her into a hug. She smelled of something spicy, something floral. Her hair felt soft against his face. He didn’t realize how tense he’d been about this moment until it was here. As they disengaged, Ginny stepping back with a faint smile on her face, Harry realized that—although it was a comfort to see her again, and although hugging her was so familiar—she felt like a sister to him.
Malfoy stares. Here on the floor, leaning forward, a chunk of his fringe has fallen over an eye. “You just shattered about five of my childhood fantasies.”
“Wanker,” Harry muttered. He made his way across the shop, stepping around the tables with their upturned chairs. Lights from the street illuminated the menu board and the empty counter. The smell of coffee was less aggressive than it was during the day.
Draco had cleared off one of the work tables. A shield charm glistened like a soap bubble around it, protecting the space from stray fumes and particles, even though he wouldn’t be using the lab much until the new year. In place of the usual mess of equipment, glass jars, and parchment, the table was scattered with spools of ribbon, bits of colored paper and gold foil, and fiddly little sequins. And under a disillusionment charm—in the
The electuary, it turned out, was some kind of herbal infusion sweetened with honey. The ginger and lime in it went well with the slice of blackberry pie Luna brought him. Having the snack gave Harry something to do while he tried to come up with a way to back out of the brewery trip—though he couldn’t think of a thing that wouldn’t make Ginny ask questions. And anyway. He liked beer.
After the tour and lecture, she directed Harry to attend the small, everyday tasks: checking the temperature and pressure in the barrels, sanitizing the equipment, running cooling and heating charms, adding carbonation to the barrels that would be served soon in the taproom, pulling moisture from the steam so the humidity didn’t get too high in the building. Once he got the hang of it, it was pretty automatic work for Harry, and he didn’t mind it. But he was relieved when Charlie called him over to a counter at the side of the brew space, thanked him for his help, and offered him a taste-testing session to round out his experience.
Even from across the street, Harry could see the crease of concentration between the man’s eyes and the firm set of his mouth, slightly frowning. He had an uncommon shade of white-blond hair. Harry didn’t know why, but the sight of it sent a thrill through him.
Draco found Potter in Draco’s own favorite little corner of the garden. This dismayed him and also made him feel some other, unidentifiable emotion, but it definitely had
Her expression was incredulous. “You idiot! Did you expect him to open his arms and give you a big kiss?”
“Where are we going now?” Harry asked, as Malfoy led him down the street. “And when can I have my ice cream back?”
There’s Hills and Bate and their unannounced search: they hadn’t listed any specific item in their warrant, only the vague “dark artifacts.” Which means someone sent an anonymous tip that Malfoy was hiding something, and under the Phoenix Act, the Auror Department would be compelled to perform a search.
Somehow, the sight of Potter’s discomfiture emboldened Draco. “So, you’ve established that you’re not a ghost and you need my help. I assume you mean with…your current state?”
Without breaking stride, Malfoy turned toward the car park and ducked under the chain and its “Private - No Trespassing” sign. Harry ducked after him.
Draco moaned. He reached into Harry, pulled Harry in. Pulled pleasure from the tips of his toes and his core. Pleasure Harry didn’t know he had, all folded up till then, springing open. More than he could handle.
Harry knocks but doesn’t wait before opening the door. Robards looks up. His eyes widen a fraction before his expression darkens. His mouth opens, but Harry heads him off.
Thankfully, Healer Catherine comes in shortly after to discharge him, and Hermione jumps to her feet and glances up at Ron sheepishly, and Harry casts a spell to dry his shirt.
He took the chest downstairs and set it on the floor in the sitting room. Then he poured a glass of Firewhiskey.
“Hmmmm.” Malfoy makes a big show of thinking about it, and Harry feels faint and but also thrilled because he knows, he
Why didn’t he check the guest registry at the security desk before he left the Ministry? He would have evidence that the CEO of Poesy had actually been there. (Though when he told Hermione, she pointed out that the man had as much right as anyone else to visit the Ministry and could have been there on any kind of business. And even if he
At first, he couldn’t find Malfoy. Then Malfoy moved back into the circle of lights. They illuminated him softly as he passed in and out of them. He looked ethereal—like something that couldn’t be real.
, if he remembered Ron’s teasing correctly. But Harry always managed to find the book she requested. She thanked him every time with a beatific smile before flipping open the pages seemingly at random and talking liltingly about her thoughts and theories. After a bit of flipping, she always found what she was looking for, and would explain the information to Harry. She didn’t write too many notes, just a word here and there, unlike Hermione’s furious scribbling.
Harry found Luna in the library downstairs, half-hidden behind teetering stacks. He had only known to look for her there because the door had been left open, and he would have walked back out again if he hadn’t heard the
Malfoy watches him as if waiting for the rest of the sentence. When Harry doesn’t finish the thought, he says, “What did you
Harry felt wonder and admiration, and the emotion elicited an answering feeling from Malfoy, a warmth Harry had never felt from him before. Harry nearly lost himself in it.
“I’ll get the roast Brussels sprouts and tempeh with turnips,” Luna said. “They make very good Brussels sprouts here.”
He blinked around at the crowds of people and the line of cars driving slowly past. From the open window of one car, a number of people cheered and whistled at a man standing near Harry. The man waved back, picked up his suitcase, and jogged to the car before heaving the case through the open window and diving in after it. Several hands appeared to grab his clothing and pull him inside. The last Harry saw of the man was a pair of kicking feet through the open window, then they disappeared and the car slid away.
“She mentioned something to the effect. Though I was busy being surprised that she was there, talking with me.” He frowns. “But not as surprised as I could have been.” The frown deepens. “Sometimes, it feels like I almost remember. It’s that sensation of having a word at the tip of one’s tongue. I—remember that we talked. Not what we talked about, only that we did. I remember—” he hesitates briefly, “—that I trusted you.”
“No!” Draco snagged the old man’s arm. “No. I—want to show you the rest of the garden. We’ll simply…step around the stinking puddle of liquid fertilizer and be on our way. These here are the compost bins. The level of this one has declined by half over the winter.
From her place at the end of the table, Parkinson scrutinized Harry over the rim of her drink. Harry didn’t know what to make of it, so he ignored her.
Finally, once they are all transferred and in order, Harry looks up. Malfoy is leaning on the back of a chair, examining him. The expression on his face is somewhere between a sneer and fascination.
“Malfoy,” he said, glancing around the large space filled with racks of dough and milk and vegetables and meats. “Are you using Wizard Space…to keep food?”
Harry huffed a laugh. He rolled his hips experimentally, and Malfoy’s mouth fell open, eyes fluttering shut again. Harry pumped his hips—this time a little sharper, a little deeper. Malfoy hissed, a high sound of pleasure. On the third go, he was rising to meet Harry’s movements.
“But it’s not really,” he says. “I shouldn’t have said that about obliviation. That was really shitty of me.”
. Malfoy? Dependable? He stopped in the doorway, struck by the realization. But. But, if anything, he could count on Malfoy’s desire not to hurt Luna’s feelings—a thought which, itself, baffled him.
Malfoy fixed him with a dry look. “Really. And you don’t keep books just for show in your own home?”
“As a matter of fact, I didn’t. The potions manufacturers didn’t have a license to develop potions, but I’m pretty sure they had a license to manufacture. What else do you need to know? Some of the potioneers were present. One of them threw an unidentified curse at me. It got me and the potion barrel next to me. It’s the same thing I told you yesterday.”
Healer Catherine grunts and lowers her own wand. Harry watches her expectantly. His last healer would bow over his chart and scribble results without saying anything to Harry, before prescribing Harry exercises and potions and telling him to return in two weeks. Healer Catherine says, “Very nice. I’m heartened by your improvement, Harry. I can see by your smile that you are, too. How does it feel?”
It was nestled between a vacuum museum and a brick-faced hotel and was covered in a mural of flowers—a pop of color amid beige and grey. Racks of baked goods filled half of one of the huge street-facing windows. Next to them, a man stood at a workstation built so that passersby could see him working both hands into a ball of dough.
Harry is going to be sick. If he had been sitting here just a couple of weeks prior, he would have been convinced of Malfoy’s words. The whole thing is so disgustingly plausible for him—the Death Eater, the blood purist, the potion master, the sneering hateful prick. In fact, a little part of Harry’s mind doubts the Malfoy he’s come to know over the past week. Maybe
In the end, the whole thing was quite simple. They collected Harry’s, Hills’, and Bate’s selected memories, copied them, and returned them to their respective owners. The Wizengamot then adjourned to consider the new evidence. During the whole thing, Malfoy sat looking both mutinous and lost, spine straight, hands pressed to his thighs. Hills remained gruffly cordial. And Bates looked like he wanted to murder someone, though he made no protest when it came his turn to offer memories. Harry wondered how Hills had put him up to it.
By the time they got to the till a minute later, Harry had recovered enough to enter a brief scuffle with Malfoy over who would pay—much to the amusement of the staff. In the end, Harry won.
Harry murmured the incantation Ginny had taught him to wake the practice Snitch and then released it. It glinted once in the glow of a floating orb before blinking out of sight.
actually have some tea. I must have forgotten where I put it in all this mess.” He goes straight to the side cabinet, where the tea is always kept, and measures some out, and heats water in the teapot. He brings it and his own plate to the kitchen table, and Harry doesn’t say anything as Malfoy pours two cups of steaming Earl Grey—the fragrant one with the little blue and yellow flowers in it—and adds milk and sweetener to Harry’s, even as he wrinkles his nose delicately at the atrocity while he’s engaged in the act.
Malfoy led Harry down the street towards the Apparition point. Harry had made the trip enough that the way was familiar now. He fell easily into step with Malfoy while sipping from his drink, which was…interesting. Very sweet and not quite tea, not quite coffee.
Hills gives a smart nod, and Harry follows him up the stairs. Bate trails behind, still scowling. With no one to see him, Harry rolls his eyes.
Ginny had dropped him off in a part of the city dominated by shops and restaurants. He passed an ice cream shop advertising flavors like olive oil and avocado, a cinema made to look like an Indian palace, a bookseller, a shop selling taxidermy animal heads and crystals half as tall as himself, and a pet shop with rhinestone collars in its window.
But Malfoy doesn’t rise to the bait, only scrutinizes Harry. Harry gazes back, raising an eyebrow and ignoring the quickening beat of his heart.
It became a game: how long he could keep from going over the edge. Harry snarled and trembled with the effort. Malfoy pumped Harry’s cock, rolled Harry’s nipples in his fingers. Bit his shoulder. Murmured dirty things in his ears: how Harry was made for his cock, how he was going to fuck Harry raw, that Harry wouldn’t be able to sit for a week.
Malfoy must sense something of what Harry feels, which would be why he asked in the first place. He watches Harry with anticipation like hunger, and Harry is afraid Malfoy will press him for the answer. Afraid of what will come out of his mouth and what it might mean to this fragile…whatever-it-is springing up between them. The thing like friendship. And, alarmingly, this frightens Harry more than the thought of Malfoy mocking him: the thought of doing something to squash their tender new truce.
Harry wants to call out, but his mouth won’t open. He swallows. The kitchen is as empty and dark as the sitting room, the counters bare. He creaks softly up the stairs. The door to the study is open a crack. Malfoy sits at his desk, his back to Harry. It strikes Harry as a vulnerable position for Malfoy to leave himself in, for a man who once lived in a house with Voldemort, a legion of Death Eaters, and Greyback.
Malfoy was unfailingly polite to the waiter who arrived, and seemed well familiar with the ritual of ordering drinks and asking about the daily specials.
Malfoy sneers at him, his hair sleek against his head, formal robes buttoned up to his throat, and Harry takes a step back.
Two hours later, most of the muggle police disperse, and so do many of the aurors. Only a handful remain, mostly to ensure the safety of the protesters, magical and muggle alike.
“A strange bird,” Draco said. “We get them here in the garden sometimes, you know, drawn by all the plants.”
Harry can’t help it. He has never careened from professional behavior before, not like this, but he’s been cooped up in an office for months, and— It’s Malfoy.
This time, Malfoy grasped Harry’s hands and placed them on his own head. Reeling, shivering with pleasure, Harry didn’t understand at first—then Harry gripped the fine white-blond hair. Gently. Then Malfoy’s teeth grazed his shaft, and his fists tightened automatically. Malfoy moaned. The sound traveled through Harry, and he gripped tighter, and Malfoy gave a guttural groan and deepened his movements.
“All right,” Harry says with a nod, and he turns, almost weak with the relief that goes through him. He tries not to examine that, nor the fact that the thought of Malfoy forgetting the last three weeks bothers him so deeply.
Then the conversation about Harry’s job shadowing looped back to Grimmauld Place and Harry’s plans to fix it up.
Harry laughs helplessly even as a flock of doxies takes wild flight in his gut, and—shockingly—arousal warms his groin.
Malfoy showed him the shop’s two different coffee grinders (“But you’ll only be using this one”) and how to measure the ground coffee into the automatic coffee maker. Unlike the other morning, when Harry had been loading bread into the oven, Malfoy gave him very clear instructions, long fingers brushing over the machines and their parts as he talked. Harry’s hackles rose; he wanted to tell Malfoy he got it, he knew how to use a coffee machine (never mind that he had only just learned from Ginny), but he was entranced.
Frowning, eyes narrowed, Draco cast one, anyway. But when he opened the book and ran his finger along the bottom of the first page, it wasn’t a blowjob, or the startled faces of a muggle couple in a posh bed-and-breakfast room, or an old man walking by with his terrier just as Draco began to shout and shatter on the soft grass in the park. The rough little paper cutouts popped up, and they were Draco and Harry, sneering at each other across the Great Hall as owls swooped by overhead, delivering their post.
Rounding the corner, he came to a stop. Draco Malfoy, face pink, eyes wild, stood rigid and twitching in a body bind.
“I mean. Yeah. It did.” The truth was, it had passed his mind many times over the years, but his thoughts always stopped with
Cafe. Restaurant. Art gallery. Clothes. Comics. Coffee shop. A garden shop selling books. A metaphysical shop selling books. Restaurant. Doughnuts. Cafe. Puzzles and games. And books.
“You’re beautiful like this,” he growled. “Look at you, taking my cock like you were made for it. Do you fuck yourself on your fingers and dream of me, Malfoy? Have you been saving it for me?”
Malfoy is right, of course. Who is Harry to steal attention from him and his work? Only, Harry hadn’t been thinking about it that way when he went to the press the day before. He’d been thinking—well, apparently he hadn’t been thinking at all. He just…he thought it was about the
With another furtive glance over his shoulder—the country lane still appears empty—he flicks his wand in his sleeve and tests the house’s wards.
They brought Malfoy to Interrogation Room Three. Harry ended the binding spell; Malfoy didn’t have his wand, so it wasn’t like he’d get far.
The image haunts Harry all the way back to his hospital room, which is still made up for him, he notes with chagrin.
Someone clears their throat delicately from the kitchen threshold. Harry and Draco spring apart. Hermione stands there, looking contrite and amused. Mostly amused.
Malfoy smirked and continued his explanation. Actually, the process was not too different from what Harry had learned from Petunia, who had been rather particular about her baked goods. Malfoy kept a close eye on Harry as Harry folded his first batch of dough, but quickly went quiet when Harry got into the rhythm of it. Though he didn’t offer any verbal compliments, he cast frequent suspicious glances at Harry. Harry pulled back one corner of his mouth in a smile.
” He handed the plate back to the server. “Can you fry that, please? Maybe put it on bread. Maybe with a bit of lettuce and tomato.”
They ducked under strings of lights and passed more shops brimming with stuffed toys blinking sleepy button eyes and clay masks that sang in chorus and suncatchers that shed their own illumination, reminding Harry of the colored light that had shone off Malfoy’s hair at the brewery.
“Fine. I’ll watch your memories. But only because I need any insight I can get into…this disastrous situation.”
“You’re both a disaster,” Malfoy said, and took the glass from Harry. Before Harry could protest, Malfoy took a sip. “Medium-bodied. Strong character from the caramelized malt. Fruity aroma; they use local varieties of hops. Crisp finish.” He handed the glass back to Harry. “The first one you drank. It was a porter.” Malfoy reached for the empty glass, swirled the dregs as if evaluating a wine, and drained them. “Rich. Sweet and bitter. They put cocoa beans in. Completely different flavor profile.” He set the empty glass down. He picked up the next glass in line, which was a dark golden in color.
At first glance, it looked like a second library. Harry’s idea of a library, anyway: there were a few books on the shelves, but they were outnumbered by other objects. Some things he remembered from the Dursley’s home and from the home and garden magazines Petunia had kept. Some sort of metal cage shaped like a human head, filled with screws. An object that was a single metal gear. A comb with very long tines. A record-player type thing with a big bell.
A strange feeling washed over Harry as he walked towards the house with Luna, still lightly holding hands. He had that sensation again of being displaced, like things weren’t quite right. But the back garden reminded him distinctly of her old home in Ottery St Catchpole and the Burrow at once, so he felt like he was caught between times and places.
, he was going to add. The idea had been forming in his mind since—well, since Hermione had made the suggestion during her call. Though he had been seriously considering it since their trip to the coast, and it had solidified during lunch earlier.
“Pollution in the Ministry” reads the headline. He knew to expect it, but that doesn’t stop a cold sweat from prickling his neck.
“You could literally live out of your bag,” Hermione had told him, smugly. “I’ve set up plumbing. Well. Charms to mimic it.”
“But what if I were to make one just for you and me?” Harry said, and pulled Draco tighter against his side. “I can fill it with all of the important things: the first time I gave you a blowjob. That time we apparated drunk into the wrong room at that bed and breakfast.”
The folly of arriving so early is apparent then: the hearing isn’t scheduled till one in the afternoon, so he has the entire morning stretching before him with nothing to do.
“Look alive. Loser spills his guts. Thank Salazar you’re not in the Slytherin common room. Loser took a dose.” Malfoy mimes tipping back a vial.
a smarmy dark artifact smuggler. Not a Ministry errand boy. For all his boasting in school, for all his bluster and preening, Malfoy was an afterthought now—and that was just weird.
Besides, who had time to worry about a lack of a social life when you were eyeballs-deep in investigating an illegal potion ring?
It was odd to be walking these streets with someone else. He’d got used to exploring them on his own. His gaze skated over the shop windows as they passed. Even in the reflection, Malfoy’s hair shone bright in the summer sun.
She cackled and jammed the button on her door again, and the window slid up. “If you’re going to puke, open your window and point it at the car behind us.”
They stepped outside. Harry looked up at the sky and thought about the invitation he’d felt from the forest and the land to explore. It was still there, still tugged at him. But the breeze felt playful, and the pull to explore could wait.
Harry bristled at the order and at the implication that he didn’t have a working memory—and at the fact that Malfoy expected him to start with the tallest shelves—but once they settled into their search, Harry found that he quite enjoyed going through the stacks with him. Helping Luna earlier had been nice, but she’d left him to do the searching on his own. It was nice having someone nearby, even if it was Malfoy. Malfoy had a way of running his fingers over the spines and muttering. He complained about people putting books back in the wrong places, and swapped titles around a few times. Otherwise he worked quietly, pausing a couple times to ask Harry how he was coming along with his search.
Harry woke to morning light coming through the gap in the curtains. Unfamiliar curtains, unfamiliar bed.
“I wasn’t sure if you’d prefer a larger room or a smaller one, so Ginny suggested one of the medium-sized ones.”
He sets down the cup and pushes away from the counter. When he gets to the door of the kitchen, Malfoy says, “Harry? I appreciate you being here this morning.” He clears his throat. “With the aurors.”
She lets go, and he clasps her elbows. “That’s brilliant!” He glances at Malfoy, who watches them with restrained amusement. “Malfoy.”
With that, he left the kitchen. He paused before the front door, remembered the weather, and pulled on his jacket and the boots charmed against water. He grabbed his basket and the umbrella. He would have preferred an umbrella charm or an
“Salazar, you’re a twat!” Malfoy rolls his eyes so hard his entire head joins the movement, and he steps back. Harry stands on his own, though he notices Malfoy hovering as if ready to step close with a supportive arm.
“The chocolate chips,” Malfoy said. He looked up irritably from the floating mass of flour in front of him. “My magic is good, Potter, but I doubt even Merlin could measure dry ingredients and Summon things at the same time.”
“Hm.” Draco lowered next to him and took a drink. “I suspect a steady supply of secret calming draughts.”
Harry frowned into his soup bowl. He’d been high on laughter and caffeine for most of the afternoon, and he and Malfoy had continued to banter through their meal, but now it hit him that his afternoon with Malfoy was coming to a close.
“Yeah. Of course.” Harry steps back from the hearth. Then Malfoy is standing in his drawing room, tall and slim, in waistcoat and shirtsleeves. There are deep pouches under his eyes, but his hair is combed, his clothes clean and pressed.
“Is this what you want? For me to fuck your tight hole like this?” he whispered roughly at Draco’s ear. He was driving into Draco, his hips slapping against Draco’s arse with every thrust. The headboard knocked against the wall, and Harry spared a brief thought for their neighbors, if they had any.
Despite the warm soup, Harry’s stomach went cold. He looked up at a seagull wheeling overhead. Maybe it was the clear coastal air or the strange, not-unpleasant mood that had emerged between him and Malfoy since the day before, but he found himself telling the truth. “I dunno. I never imagined being anything other than an Auror.”
The first brush of Malfoy’s tongue was long and slow, and Harry opened his mouth to him. Malfoy slipped in, hot and tasting a little of the chocolate cake they’d shared for dessert. He gave one more long, slow stroke—inside Harry’s mouth—and then thrust once, twice, in echo of what he’d done to Harry the last time. The sensation went straight to Harry’s arsehole.
“I was telling Malfoy about the job shadowing opportunities. I think I found the perfect one to start.”
“Malfoy? Malfoy. Malfoy!” Harry knows it’s beneath his dignity to shout into Malfoy’s sitting room, and that Malfoy—if he was inclined—would ignore him, but he can’t help the irritated rise of his voice.
“Coffee,” Malfoy said, sliding a chair out and folding into it gracefully, which irritated Harry. All of that boyhood haughtiness had translated into an easy competence.
Harry glanced at the clock. He had some time before he was supposed to meet Malfoy at the coffee shop. And why his stomach should do a flip-flop, he didn’t know. Well. Granted, it had been incredibly good sex. And—well, not that he expected a repeat performance, but he couldn’t discount that it was a possibility. That is. It was a possibility for Harry. If Malfoy—
“There’s a creek just there,” Luna said, pointing into the deeper shadows towards mossy grey rocks, although Harry couldn’t see water.
“There’s nothing more to say,” Potter said, but followed Draco back into the house and settled across from him at the kitchen table.
Harry, in the process of lifting the first glass of beer to his mouth, paused just short of inhaling the liquid. “What?”
“I do. It is, indeed, a house. It even has a little porch with, ummm, a little garden and some hanging things—baskets. Windows. Very nice.”
He collected his bag from the baggage bin; a magical timestamp shimmered on its strap, showing its arrival time as an hour ago. On his first holiday via Portkey years ago, Harry hadn’t understood the reason for sending bags through their own Portkey and had insisted on keeping his with him for the trip, only for the bag to spin out of his hands upon arrival, nearly braining the arrival attendant and flinging shrunken clothing all over the terminal. He spent the next ten minutes Summoning tiny pants from potted trees and light fixtures.
Harry looked at the big blue IHOP sign above the building. “Would you be very upset if I said I’m no longer in the mood?”
In the end, Hermione does wonder where Draco disappeared to, though her response when she finds them isn’t one of surprise. She only complains that they’re blocking the floo. But that’s all right, Harry thinks. She can apparate home.
Malfoy rapped a knuckle against the table. Head in hand, Harry looked at him. Malfoy made a complicated gesture which involved pointing at Harry and pointing at himself, then at both their eyes in a sort of “I’m-watching-you” way. When Harry only stared, Malfoy sighed and spoke nonsense that sounded suspiciously like, “I thought you were more intelligent than
Upon returning, Sophie clucked at the sight. “Well, not everyone is cut out for the fine craft of hat-making.”
The whole thing smacked of propaganda. Which, of course it would, because Perfect Products doesn’t actually exist.
A barking, whistling howl pierced the night, joined by another. A shiver went up Harry’s back. They weren’t wolf howls, but they didn’t sound like dogs, either. They went on and on—ghostly, wavering cries that sliced through the peace of the night and soared over the crickets. He wondered if he should wake Ginny and Luna, but he reckoned whatever lived in the woods, they knew about it.
Edward grinned at him. “Too early yet. Though she’d have been happy to see you. You’re all she’s been talking about these last few days.”
He felt uncomfortable mentioning his relative wealth in front of them, especially Ron, but Ron only shrugged and said, “That’s a good point.”
He pauses halfway to the sitting room door, his muscles vibrating. He turns his head not quite far enough to look over his shoulder.
take a breath in his not-dead state and so instead spent a moment looking extra surly before he said, “Because
This time, Harry made three Portkey jumps altogether. London to Atlanta, Atlanta to Dallas, Dallas to—
, Potter,” Draco finally bit out, slapping his quill down. “If you ever plan to let me finish this, will you stop flirting with my kitchen?”
“Yes. Yeah. Of course.” And he’ll punch the git for nearly giving his best friend a stroke when he finds him in his study with his back to the door.
He nearly Apparated on the spot, but he caught himself and began to stride toward the bathroom to Apparate from there—then thought better of getting Malfoy in trouble by “disappearing” in his coffee shop’s bathroom. So he returned to the alley and went from there to Malfoy’s house. He vaguely remembered the overgrown rose bush at the side of the house and aimed to appear behind it, though he didn’t have a clear picture of that spot in his head and nearly splinched himself.
Normally, the alcohol infusion would take far longer to sit—several weeks, at least—but Draco had a spell for quickening it, and what the muggles didn’t know wouldn’t hurt them (or break the Statute). He didn’t always rush the infusion process, but something at the back of his mind had nagged at him until he did.
Malfoy sat, seeming completely unaware of the effect he was having on Harry. “Have you ordered yet?”
Harry is thrown by the biting reference to his old house. Before he can react, Malfoy turns on his heel and steps into a sitting room off the front hall. Harry hurries after him.
Then it was gone, landing in a bunch of ivy right as Edward jogged over (though “jogged” was a generous word).
“I’ll strike fear into the hearts of all Dark wizards,” Harry intoned, because he couldn’t help but pick up on the playful energy.
Harry wonders if this is what Malfoy felt like when Harry brought over the casserole, because he can’t turn down any of the food even though his stomach is twisting with nerves and he’s almost up to his eyeballs in coffee and liquor. And Malfoy prattles on the entire time about the particular bakery in Paris his mother took him to as a child, and the provenance of the port, and how to pair it with foods.
Harry cracked the cover off of his paper bowl of chowder. It steamed in the cool seaside air. It was good—full of dense, soft chunks of potato. The smoked tuna was meaty, almost creamy. But the sourdough, while all right, was not as good as Malfoy’s, Harry was inexplicably pleased to notice.
Still. Did Malfoy use a dishwasher at home? Or was this one for show, since Malfoy employed a Muggle staff? (Harry
Before he took the Floo home, Harry chose several bottles to take with him: a large bottle of Sound Effects Steam Beer for Ginny and Luna, because he thought they’d enjoy making animal noises at each other, a bottle of the Deftly Dancing Dubbel for Malfoy (as a joke, really), a Brewmaster’s Beer for himself, and a bottle of Daydream Doppelbock, which he got last, on impulse.
The next morning, Luna was waiting for him in the kitchen with her hair pulled into a series of plaits and tied beneath a scarf.
“Oh, yes,” she said. “Almost all of the magical rooms are.” She opened the door to a tight space crammed with coats, cloaks, and jumpers.
, for Merlin’s sake. But he had to admit that there was something enchanting about the twirl of Malfoy’s hand as he applied the topping.
“Look! He can’t— He’s not even—” Harry can’t finish a sentence. He’s furious. He grips the banister tighter as his vision greys around the edges.
As he waited for his second round, he had to sit with no food and no beer and try not to stare at Malfoy balling a napkin and dabbing casually at his mouth while he talked to Ginny.
As promised, the herbal preparation room hadn’t changed much in the three weeks since Edward had last visited. That didn’t stop the old man from looking around like it was his first time. The appreciation and wonder on the worn face secretly pleased Draco. It allowed him to glimpse the room the way a visitor must: the long work table in the middle, the shelves of jars filled with dried herbs, the racks of tinctures, the boxes of empty glass bottles and blocks of beeswax, the jugs of alcohol. The room smelled of herbs infused in brandy, of honey and menthol and something bitter.
Lately, they’d begun to post disillusioned aurors outside every suspected illegal brewery location. It was a 24-hour operation, with the aurors taking shifts. A resource-intensive endeavor, and not guaranteed to yield results. At least, not before resources dried up or the head of the DMLE questioned the success of the tactic.
Harry stared around. It was…a bedroom. A comfortable-looking bedroom in the same darkly-stained woods, with pale walls. It was very sensible-looking, except it did have some kind of spherical chandelier thing hanging from the center of the ceiling. It hung above the bed and reminded Harry of something from Astronomy class with its little models of planets in orbit (they moved slowly) and a single unlit candle suspended in the center. Harry wanted to make fun of Malfoy for it, but he couldn’t seem to open his mouth.
He looks everything and nothing like the boy Harry remembers. His features are stronger, more squared than pointy. His hair remains the same shocking white blond, though he wears it short. Shorter, even, than Harry’s own. He’s still the same slender bastard he’s always been, but to his dismay, Harry finds himself tilting his head back to glare into the flinty eyes.
Luna smiled at him and accepted the feather. Later, she showed him how to carve the tips into nibs. Harry cut his fingers twice.
“Not at all. The kitchen is there to be used. I thought I’d come check to see if any more animals got trapped between the wards, but I haven’t found any.”
That was it. His monologue ended. Harry tried to decide whether the invitation to sit was implicit or not forthcoming.
Harry laughs. “What, Malfoy, were you imagining games of…of strip snap in the Gryffindor common room? Frequent fantasy of yours, was it?”
All good feelings are gone when Harry wakes the next morning. He rolls out of bed well before his alarm and appears at the Ministry before even the coffee stand has opened for the morning. It’s the only way he can prevent himself from calling on Malfoy’s floo at the crack of dawn. As it is, he barely abstains from sending a note by owl. Just an encouraging little message.
“Too many good things to choose from,” Harry said, with a tight smile. Malfoy’s elbow was nearly touching his on the table, but he felt like if he moved it away, the movement would be too obvious. “Luna, would you order for me?”
Harry couldn’t help himself. He stepped forward and cupped Malfoy’s jaw and kissed him. The kiss felt like a natural extension of the moment, both of them windblown and ecstatic. Malfoy’s breath was warm against Harry’s mouth, panting and just as full of the night as Harry.
Harry lifted his hand and very gently ran a finger over the tattoo. Malfoy clenched his fist tighter but didn’t move.
“Fuck you, Malfoy.” Though Harry laughs, despite himself. He covers his face. Groans. “Oh, my god. You weren’t supposed to see
It was as if he’d never gone. He had the overwhelming sense that Malfoy was there, leaning against his car and waiting for him. But when Harry turned, the driveway was empty.
Malfoy pulled out his wand and wordlessly banished Harry’s clothes. Harry yelped. His hands flew to his crotch to cover himself, but his dick was standing up, and his fingers knocked against it. A jolt of pleasure and shock went through him. His head spun—from the blood rush, from the alcohol.
A little smile twisted Draco’s lips. “Really. It’ll be fine. Teddy will love it. Drink more. You’ll feel better.”
Bemused, Harry sat at his table in the corner and listened to the hiss and clatter of the machines. Malfoy came by a few minutes later with a whipped-cream-topped mug and a plate.
The study is empty. The floor, the side table. Every book, every paper, every piece of parchment—gone. The study is completely clean, the desk chair pushed neatly against the desk, whose surface is a tidy expanse of empty wood. The curtains are drawn over the windows. It looks every inch the way he’d expect the study of neat, fastidious Draco Malfoy to look.
Harry instantly feels like an idiot, disturbing Malfoy. “No. Everything’s fine. I’m.” Now that he’s here, staring up at Malfoy’s concerned face, he has no idea what to say, no idea why he actually called. But he feels like even more of an idiot because of it, and can hardly tell Malfoy that. He rubs his damp palms against his thighs. “Just a bit quiet around the house, and I thought— But you’re probably busy getting ready for your hearing.”
Their meals came, and they talked about pop culture and travel and food. By the time the conversation came around to Harry and Grimmauld Place, Harry had drunk the Brewmaster’s Beer and a purple bubble beer and had joined Luna in trying to blow more bubbles than Ginny. (Harry’s stomach swooped every time Malfoy looked his way and rolled his eyes. Harry managed to blow one bubble into his face when Malfoy was focused on Luna, where it popped, obviously startling him, and his expression transformed into something part irritation, part suppressed laughter, and Harry thought for an instant that he’d cracked whatever strange wall was between them, but then Malfoy sniffed and drawled something dismissive.) Parkinson wanted to know what kinds of renovations Harry had planned for Grimmauld. It turned out she had some kind of interest in magical buildings, which had something to do with her travels.
He went to the bookcase, mostly to stare at it for a minute. He ran a finger over the spines. Well. Identifying potions and deducting their uses and makeup had always been a strength of his. With nowhere better to start, he would start with references on that subject.
Then he gives Harry a little push into the room, and then he must follow it with a lightening charm, because Harry half drifts toward the bed and tumbles into it gently.
He liked his voice and his smile, even those smirks, but especially the genuine smiles, the unguarded ones. He liked his hands and his
“Hm? Oh, he’s fine. He and Rose are watching the television. Arthur was over earlier fiddling with it. Now they get some of the Latin American channels. Ron’s discovered telenovelas.” The little smirk is back on her face. “So he’ll be all right for a while.”
“I was thinking you might want to try something non-magical, Harry. Electricians are in high demand, and you might be fascinated to learn about the non-magical equivalent to magic. Or you could go into package delivery.”
The atmosphere inside the taproom was similar to that of the brew space: reclaimed wood, barrels (these ones used as table bases), jars of herbs, pieces of brewing equipment hung as decoration. In fact, it almost looked like an extension of the brew space, minus the piles of wet grains and with the addition of paintings depicting Medieval-looking people drinking from tankards. Hard to tell, but it seemed like at least some of the background babble came from the talking portraits—and, judging from one group of men in a nearby painting, more than a little of the laughter.
She smiled. “I was going to bring it over anyway when I saw the girls were gone. I had kind of a feeling I knew where they went, so I brought it along with me.”
“I served you a lot of tea,” he thinks he hears Malfoy murmur, just before past-Harry admits he’s wrong and he and past-Malfoy get into a short argument.
Now, having recovered from his initial shock, Harry looked at Malfoy closer and noted the anemic pastiness of his skin, the deep creases under his eyes. A vivid bruise spread over his cheek. Harry would have to ask Williams and Chesterfield about that. Other, older-looking bruises mottled his neck. The hard thing in Harry’s chest dug in deeper.
On impulse, he takes the guest entrance up to street level. He exits into the protest, which is still going on. It’s continued on in shifts since the day it started. The misty rain has not deterred the demonstrators. Neither has it deterred the press. Harry recognizes several of the faces there from the
Malfoy dragged him through room after room, which were all connected by staircases and filled with bookcases. Memories of Hermione’s stories came back to him; upon returning from a trip to see Ginny and Luna, she’d mentioned this place in reverent tones.
Harry watched Malfoy as they passed back into the lights. The half-wild look on his face. His body, pressed close to the broom.
The chaos of movement is a dim backdrop to Harry’s own whirlwind thoughts of Malfoy dressed in a heather cardigan, grey eyes dark with anger, his voice seething. He had the audacity to put on the airs of a
“I guess. Yeah.” Harry looked at the fire, trying to keep his gaze from straying to the tree. He had a terrible habit of giving himself away, he’d come to realize.
His courage dries up, and he stares, frozen, at Malfoy. He can barely breathe. Malfoy stares back, and Harry realizes how close they are. He can just hear Malfoy’s quiet breathing over the crackle of the fire.
His fingers had still been sore when he woke, peppered with angry red marks from repeatedly jabbing himself with a needle the day before. He’d been too embarrassed to ask Luna to cast a Healing Charm on them, so he cast some of the field spells he’d learned as an Auror. After ten minutes, his fingers were a little better (and only slightly stained turquoise), but he was definitely not up for another adventure yet.
At nine, Hermione’s wand vibrates. “Oh! I’m sorry, Harry. I have to get home. Floo me tomorrow. Will you be contacting Draco?”
Malfoy continues coolly: “But considering the DMLE had their hand in this, or at least the attempt to discredit me, I’m not actually staying at home. None of my research is there, anyway. They stripped that rather neatly, as you saw.”
Harry also looked down. The menu appeared on the table in front of him, shimmering under the glass top with a faint mother-of-pearl sheen. He tapped the image until it displayed the drinks. Since this was a brewery, he’d already planned on checking them out, but alcohol had become a necessity now that he was sitting next to Malfoy.
He went with the foot traffic past a security checkpoint and through a series of doors that allowed him to pass through before swinging themselves shut behind him. And maybe it was just the surreal feeling he got from travel in general, but he felt like he was perhaps still in the wizarding section of the airport.
It took them months to learn a new rhythm with each other while also figuring out what to do with their careers. For sure, they didn’t
He passed the cafe and the wand boutique and the wizarding wireless shop, and came to the end of the alley, where there was a little coffee shop. Harry had seen it on his previous trip to the alley but hadn’t gone in because the smell of Sophie’s burnt coffee had put him off the drink for the day—and he’d half-suspected Sophie had got the coffee in question from the shop.
check in on him. Circe. With Robards in a snit and someone out to get Malfoy, anything else could have happened today, and Harry would have no idea. And Hermione said Malfoy hasn’t replied to any of her owls today.
The alley bustled with activity. Harry wended his way along the narrow path between magical folk, tables and chairs, street vendors, and the occasional potted plant that tried to bite him. In one recessed doorway, a busker waved her wand like a conductor while a violin played itself. Sweet smells of baking wafted from the open door of the cafe next to her, reminding Harry of Malfoy. He passed a clothing shop with racks of waistcoats and robes, a small bespoke wand maker advertising unusual woods and cores, a magical antique shop, and a bookshop. Strains of music drifted from a shop selling wizarding wireless sets next door.
Shortly after pie, Ron heads home with Rose. Hermione and Draco head up to Draco’s study to go through some letters or draft some rebuttal or other.
Ginny’s mischievous edge and confidence translated into a firm clarity when teaching. She explained things well but expected him to keep up, though when he asked her to repeat an incantation or a wand gesture, she did so patiently.
He flipped the page of the report on his lap. His right foot was falling asleep on the desk. He shuffled his legs, freeing it and hooking it over his left ankle. Took a sip of his cooling coffee. A bite from his cheese and pickle sandwich.
Harry gave himself a shake. He looked at his food and stabbed up a radish. “I reckon he’d rather not want to see me.”
He had spent the later part of the morning and the early part of the afternoon with Luna, looking through the indexes of books, searching for information about curses and magical plant illnesses. Doing research with Luna was very different from researching with Hermione. The library didn’t seem to have any organizing strategy that Harry could recognize, and half the time Luna couldn’t remember where a book was. She gave Harry directions like, “Look at that shelf near the middle. It’s sort of up near the top to the left.”
“So I’ve been told.” Malfoy smirked, but the expression flickered when his fingers reached the cuff of his sleeve. He unbuttoned one, then the other. Hesitated for a breath. Pulled the shirt off.
believe that Draco was his last recourse. And Draco didn’t want to antagonize Potter. Though he was loath to admit it to himself, Draco hadn’t felt this thrill since he first began working on his mastery potion. This was a challenge he couldn’t pass up.
Malfoy and Hermione exchange a look that Harry can’t read. Before he can ask what it means, Hermione says, “And actually, the expedited hearing is technically against the law, although you have to know something about the law in the first place to know that, and the entire reason for rushing it is so that Malfoy doesn’t— Well, whether or not it’s intentional, this kind of time frame doesn’t give him much time to prepare legal counsel.”
Malfoy turned. He had a tiny smile on his face that Harry could only see because they were so close.
“Good job, Harry.” Luna beamed an encouraging smile at him. “But I’m not surprised, really. Draco is a good teacher.”
Potter, who’d been eying his soup, looked up and shrugged, expression too casual. “Not like I need shelter. And I don’t sleep.”
Just as Ron had promised, the entire Weasley clan descended upon Grimmauld Place within a day of Harry’s return. Bill cleared the curses, Arthur calmed the enchanted furniture, and Molly attacked the kitchen and rooms with a volley of Cleaning Charms and ferocious intent.
Now, he settled into the ride for the sake of the ride itself. It reminded him a bit of being on the Hogwarts Express, though the scenery and the seats and the smells and the company were all different. He remembered his friends being engrossed in games and books while he looked out the window, content to enjoy watching the world roll by. (He also remembered Malfoy stopping by to sneer at them.)
“It’s all right, Harry,” Ginny said, at the look on his face. She gave his shoulder a slow, heavy pat. “It happens to the best of us. Look, they even have efectric lights.”
Then Malfoy was pushing him off, and Harry pulled back, lips wet, confused. He opened his mouth to ask if he’d done something wrong or unwanted. But Malfoy looked at him, eyes dark. “May I fuck you?”
Malfoy finished rolling the one cuff up to his elbow. Vaguely, Harry wondered why Malfoy had bothered with a long-sleeved shirt to start with, but the thought drifted away almost as soon as it had formed. Malfoy’s fingers were long and deft. He released the button of the other cuff and rolled that sleeve back next. Harry caught sight of sinuous black ink on the inside of his forearm and felt a jolt of alarm. Not for the first time, he noted that it looked different than he remembered seeing on Snape; something about it was lighter, less distinct in a way he couldn’t identify.
Harry ignores that and sweeps the potatoes into the bowl with the carrots. “Bate was an arse, but Hills kept it brief.”
Their drinks came, and the conversation turned to Luna’s work with the Thestrals. Parkinson asked about the Thestrals by name, and she asked other questions about the house and the farm that made it obvious that she’d been a part of the household for a long time—since the beginning. She and Ginny and Luna and Malfoy fell into a well-established rhythm of conversation.
Malfoy licked his lips, didn’t say anything. Harry gathered the fabric and slid it up, over his abdomen, his chest, guiding it over his head and off his arms. It felt significant, somehow, this last barrier before Malfoy was there, lying completely naked beneath him.
He led Harry toward the back of the shop. In the kitchen, he turned to scrutinize Harry from head to toe. Harry’s neck felt hot. This time, Harry was kind of expecting it, so he wasn’t surprised when Malfoy flicked his wand and Transfigured Harry’s clothes. Harry looked down to find himself in a green button-up and artfully distressed jeans. It wasn’t too different from what he’d already been wearing, but the jeans felt snugger, and so was the shirt, at his shoulders.
out. And he was an auror, to boot; the man should be able to look after himself. Roaming around the countryside in a muggle area, half-transparent…
He was going to miss Luna. It wasn’t the same with Hermione, who muttered to herself and asked brisk questions and expected him to have answers. He was going to miss the messy coziness of the hidden downstairs library.
He rests his mouth against the rim of the cup, breathing steam into his face and fogging up his glasses. A tiny smile tugs at his mouth as he remembers the canceled hearing and Robards’ surprise. Malfoy—with the help of Hermione—can hold his own. He thinks of the reports he won’t have to write up on Malfoy, and the words he won’t have to censor when Robards blows into his office to interrogate him on the investigation. He thinks of the protesters outside the Ministry—he no longer needs to pretend they’re his problem—and the story in the
She maintains a calm expression, but her eyes soften. He might have called it pity if it were someone else. From her, it is compassion and a deep understanding.
“Oh, is that right?” Harry cuts in, and heat spreads over his face. He feels the angry sparking of his magic, and it wraps a tendril around his lungs and gives a squeeze. He can’t speak with the alarm of it, and his teeth grit.
Most importantly, Harry and Draco had had fun working on it. All of these years later, Harry still liked working with Draco: on a case, in the field, at home, on secret Christmas heirlooms. He especially liked witnessing Draco in his element, working on potions or on magical artifacts, like this one. Draco made a certain face. He was making it now: lips pursed and eyes narrowed as he focused on the 24th, blank, page.
The beer in his hand was red. He took a drink. Frowned at it. “Why did I order this? Why didn’t I order just one drink?”
It was strange to be on this side of the counter. From where he stood, Harry could see out the front window that Malfoy stood at when he was mixing and kneading dough during the day. He could see the spot where he himself had stood when he’d first spotted Malfoy from the opposite side of the road.
“Oh, yes. I’ve visited every other bakery in the city, and most of the coffee shops. There’s only one that makes croissants better than mine, but don’t ask me which one, because I won’t tell you.”
Draco lifted an eyebrow and settled his chin on his clasped hands. “And yet I distinctly remember you mentioning a curse a moment ago, but maybe my hearing is going along with my sanity. Please, elucidate.”
Potter’s fingers appeared to fidget, and Draco had the impression that they’d have been tapping against the tabletop if they’d had substance.
Harry puts the casserole dish away. Then he makes a pot of tea to have something to do with his hands and takes it into the drawing room to curl up on the sofa.
“I can’t believe you never had Ginny bring you,” Harry said. “It was sort of similar. They didn’t have prawn toast, though.”
Dry, warm, smelling of mint, and blessedly alone, he descended into the kitchen to have his tea and toast. Only a slight hint of old fish smell followed him around. He was resigned to it. Though, a nice cup of fragrant Earl Grey and a hearty slathering of butter and blackberry jam would set him right.
As he talked, his hand worked over Harry’s arse, moving closer to the cleft. Then he gently pushed apart his cheeks and slowly dragged his tongue over Harry’s hole. Harry whimpered, and Malfoy blew on it. Did it again. Slowly, almost ponderously, his breath hot against Harry’s moist skin.
“You’re a treat,” Malfoy sneers. Then the door is moving, and it takes Harry a moment to realize it has swung open, not closed. He gapes.
Harry couldn’t think through the storm of wings and shrieking. Then he remembered the spell Ginny had shown him for sealing up the mounds—except it was a bit hard to cast with the fairies swarming.
Malfoy’s gaze drops. “She really has been very kind to me. More than I deserve for…for everything I did. I realize it’s for the cause and not necessarily for me, but I still admire her ability to put our past behind her.”
He hasn’t had reason to use it in a while, but maybe out of respectful memory of Dumbledore, who he still associates the devices with, he’s stored his small pensieve with more care than he treats most other things in his cheerfully cluttered home. He pulls it from the locked cupboard in the parlor and sets it on the desk. The liquid inside shimmers.
Harry half expects another mocking comment from Malfoy. Instead, the other man only places the letters into Harry’s hand, his eyes hard. For a moment, Harry can’t look away. Then he unfolds the first letter and skims it. A frisson of alarm runs up his arms and neck, though he isn’t sure what he’s looking at. Some kind of formal request for documents, which goes on for pages. He flips through the letters, recognizes the Ministry seal on all of them.
“Really, Potter. Were you born that self-centered, or is it a side effect of the fame? One wonders.”
more sophisticated than Firewhiskey.” She flicked her fingers in the direction of Malfoy’s glass. “And what about this one?”
“What are you talking about?” Harry turned in the direction Malfoy pointed. A woman was setting a plate and mug into a plastic tub on a side table. “Seriously? Are you too good to clear the tables?”
,” Malfoy hisses, turning and raising his arm. Harry is chagrined to see he’s holding a packet of letters. His own hand went to his wand. Malfoy’s gaze drops, and he curls his lip. “Haven’t lost your reflexes, I see. They’re letters. You’re meant to read them.
The list grew long, and included an aggressive flock of books in the library, a cloud of noxious fumes under a Stasis Charm in the old potions lab, a nursery with walls sweating some kind of brown droplets, and a door that opened into solid darkness. Twelve years as an Auror, and a lifetime spent as friends with Hermione, had taught him the usefulness of approaching some things in an organized fashion.
“Harry,” Draco whispered, sounding suspiciously choked. But when he looked up, his eyes were sharp, bright. “Do I need to cast a privacy charm?”
Hermione and Malfoy are bent over the coffee table when Harry arrives. This time, books cover the table, not food. Neither Hermione nor Malfoy seems to notice that Harry’s come by floo. In fact, he flooed twice to get there—from the Ministry to his house, then to Malfoy’s—and he’s queasy from the extra jump. He can’t say why he made it, except that he had an itching suspicion between his shoulder blades and didn’t want anyone to overhear his destination.
Draco set the steaming mug of coffee on the scarred table, and Edward sat gratefully in front of it.
He hadn’t been inside the shed before. When he’d asked for a broom, Ginny had brought it to him, and he’d assumed she had a couple of spares. From the look of the shed from the outside, he’d expected a few brooms for guests, some decommissioned older models, and some odds and ends for the farm. He hadn’t expected a space the size of a small house, with benches for sitting and lockers—and racks and racks of brooms.
They sat at the bottom of the garden and drank straight from the bottles, even Malfoy, though Harry had remembered to bring a glass for him.
Malfoy occasionally pulled his features into a sarcastic expression, but he always received good-natured laughter in return. Some of the customers appeared to be regulars, and he stopped to chat with them even if he wasn’t on the till.
Malfoy hissed in surprise, but Harry continued his exploration, kissing the snake head and then licking a broad stripe over the tattoo to the base of Malfoy’s hand. Malfoy made another hiss of alarm, but Harry tightened his grip before Malfoy could pull away. He pressed another kiss to the skull head, and then—not wanting to hurt Malfoy—gentled his grip before he moved to Malfoy’s hand.
Harry slowly stalks forward. The truth is he can’t move much faster for fear of losing his breath, but he scowls and hopes to play it off as intimidating. He doesn’t have to fake the anger.
He isn’t sure how that makes him feel. Not guilty—not quite. Maybe a twist of tension, but part of that might be excitement. Which is just mad.
“You were just going to drop it in another fit of pique,” Malfoy snaps, when Harry’s gaze follows his movements.
“We’re sorry,” Chesterfield said when he appeared in the holding compound. “We would have called, except they were already leaving and—”
“What makes you think I want anything? Maybe you weren’t raised with manners, but I was, and I am not about to let you go running off like a tear-streaked maiden from a Regency novel.”
Hands shaking, Harry folded the letter and returned it to the chest. He cast his own ward over it, then went downstairs and had a glass of Firewhiskey.
Harry feels his face heat at that statement, as if it meant, or should mean, something else. As if there were some…
Heather turned from the till. She snagged the cup of espresso and the pitcher of steamed milk from Harry and said, “Look. You want the milk to go under the espresso, so you start off far away. But you don’t want it to splash, so hold it close first, then pull back—like this. You don’t have to worry about the latte art at the end. That’s just for show.”
Malfoy’s lips press into a white, thin line. Grey eyes meet green, unblinking. Abruptly, he looks away. “To answer your question, that’s what I’m trying to do. Tell people about this.”
Malfoy wanted to show Harry a museum, but it was closed when they arrived, which plunged Malfoy into a glowering mood. Harry demanded they get ice cream instead, then sidetracked them on a tour of the creamery, at which point Malfoy stopped glowering because he was sucked in by the sight of the machinery producing perfect blocks of cheese. He stared, and licked trails of melting ice cream from his cone, and Harry smirked and cast a little underhanded Stasis Charm on the ice cream.
Evening sunlight bathes Malfoy through the window where he perches on the sill. He’s directly in Harry’s line of sight, and Harry’s gaze falls on him. This is a pose Harry hasn’t seen him in before: back propped against one side of the sill and feet propped against the other, a book open on his knees, absorbed and serious, his sarcastic mouth set in a thoughtful frown. Occasionally, he lifts a long-fingered hand to turn the page. Licks the pad of his index finger. Pulls on his lip and tilts his head so that his white blond hair shines with the luster of fine metal.
“What? Oh.” He looked at the credit card Ginny had handed to him and gave it to the cashier. She took it with a grin, and it occurred to him, belatedly, that she had asked him a lot of questions—especially when the coffee person handed him his cup and directed him to a table around the corner where he could choose from a dizzying array of sweeteners and creamers himself. He rooted around for the milk and sugar, added generous helpings of both, and walked back onto the street.
Ginny whacked his arm with her wand. “Come on. It’s hurting me to look at you. Have you had any caffeine yet?”
Malfoy shook his head. He was leaning back against one hand as he looked up at the sky. Some kind of bird croaked loudly as it flew by overhead, punctuating the high drone of crickets. “I’m surprised you didn’t go into Quidditch,” he said in an offhand way, after it had passed.
Dazed, Harry watched him—was completely mesmerized by that strong hand stroking himself off. The same sure movements he used when kneading.
They only knew that Harry had overstepped with his legilimency somehow and that orders hadn’t been followed as they should have.
His finger tasted vaguely of salt, but mostly just of clean skin. Harry took it in to the knuckle, nearly bumping his gag reflex. He drew back, hollowing his cheeks.
“Ha. Yes, quite. Very funny, our imaginations.” He spotted the self-sweeping broom, which was stuck against the furniture again, nudging against the bottom of the grandfather clock, and he knocked it out of the way with his foot. He cast a swift disillusionment charm at it and at the metal bird fluttering its wings on the side table.
“It’s just dinner with Hermione and Ron,” he says, returning to the kitchen. The cooking storm has ebbed. Draco has finger-combed his hair and straightened his collar. He pauses in chopping herbs to shoot Harry a harassed look.
Molly had assured him that he would settle in, but that had been a week ago, after they’d just finished the renovations. He hadn’t said anything to Hermione about it because he knew her answer:
He dropped into his desk chair. The hospital bracelet caught his eye again. He picked it up and turned it over in his hand. An odd emotion lodged inside of him—one somewhere between despair and alarm—and then he took up his quill to write his second memo to Shacklebolt that day. He visited Robards again and delivered his official resignation in person, with a promise to see out his current case.
Malfoy shrugged. He didn’t seem too concerned. So Harry used it, and came out in the t-shirt and boxers he slept in.
Harry had his first night of uninterrupted sleep in a week, and when he woke, he knew what he had to do.
Hermione stares straight ahead, her expression as dark as a storm cloud. “Right. Not enough evidence.”
something—and Harry was adamant that, whatever it was, they needed to do it together. After all, there was no point in quitting the Aurors, where they had got involved in the first place because they clicked so well as working partners, only to spend no time with each other.
“Malfoy. I didn’t know you cared.” Harry pours two cups. Then, at Malfoy’s glare, he sighs and lowers the teapot. He hands one of the cups to Malfoy. “I felt your wards under attack. I responded instinctively to reinforce them.”
The host brought them to a corner booth. This time, Malfoy was not already there. Harry lifted the sticky menu, but his attention was only half on the food and drink. Ginny and Luna had sat together again, and he couldn’t stop being aware of the empty space next to him.
Edward lifted his cup in salute. “If you ever have a mind to open a shop in town, I’ll suggest serving coffee on the side.”
. He’d been subsisting comfortably on his practice of muggle herbology for years. If he was going to fail out of his potions mastery, what need would he have for featherfee fur or geranium fangs?
Harry found himself glancing frequently at Malfoy and jiggling his leg as he flipped through books. “How are these?” he asked when they met in the middle of the bookcase. To Harry’s surprise, he’d actually gone through more of the books than Malfoy had, but that may have been because Malfoy had spent time flipping through indices and poring over the pages. Meanwhile, Harry had picked the books that looked more impressive—the older books, those that were dense with text and large words, and those with authors that had long strings of letters after their names.
“God, you make me crazy,” Malfoy whispered. He slid a hand up Harry’s inner thigh, and Harry bent his other knee, steepling the leg, giving Malfoy easier access.
“A true sixth sense,” he said. “Sixth sense” was one of the many muggle phrases he’d learned after moving to the area. The concept amused him, as did superstitions like bad luck for breaking mirrors. Muggles might not have had true magic, but they had some ideas that came surprisingly close to the truth—and some that were laughingly off-kilter.
“All right.” He knew Draco didn’t mean it, but there was a flutter of anxiety in his stomach, anyway, because—he’d thought it was cute at the time, but maybe it was stupid, after all. Gifts like these were all right for kids, which Draco wasn’t. But Harry thought—
Harry, sitting on the edge of the chair, scrubs his face. “Just a little.” It occurs to him that he didn’t tell Hermione about the article himself. “Sorry. I meant to tell you. I guess I forgot to mention I talked with the press.”
A chicken squawked across his path, and Harry jumped back. He didn’t recognize her before she disappeared into the herbs, but when he knelt, he discovered a tiny pink egg in the cat dish by the back door. It was still warm when he picked it up.
Harry slung his bag into the back seat and got into the passenger side. He was still vaguely nervous about being in a vehicle, but mostly, he was excited.
“Uh.” Harry looked from his right to his left, to the scores of yellow and green and blue eyes staring at him from inside picture frames.
Harry, who had just been trying to figure out the logistics of Apparating with all of that food, frowned at Malfoy. “You—what?”
The hotel clerk didn’t blink at two men asking for one room, although Harry felt conspicuous. When they got to the room, some of the lack of suspicion was self-explanatory: there were two beds, each too small to fit more than one adult man comfortably.
A file sits in his inbox. Harry stares at it a moment and then lets out a soft laugh, rubs a hand over his mouth.
Malfoy streaked up to join him. He made a darker shadow against the backdrop of the night sky, a patch of void.
it. And—fuck—Malfoy’s face was right there, mouth open and panting. Harry gave in and clutched Malfoy’s hair and kissed him.
He doesn’t know quite what he’s looking for. Pieces to the puzzle, perhaps—one that is rapidly growing and filling with more holes.
Because he didn’t have much to say, and because they seemed to sense he needed quiet, Ginny and Luna talked between themselves about the farm and people they knew that they had seen recently. It seemed like such a familiar rhythm; it had to be how they talked when no one else was around.
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” Malfoy said, eyeing the birds as they swooped and squabbled over the morsel.
Emotion finally cracks Malfoy’s features, a narrow-eyed look. He inspects the parchment with a frown. “You could have just owled this. Didn’t want to pass up a chance to gloat in person?”
Malfoy smiled. “And to think: I haven’t even started.” His hot hands smoothed down Harry’s thighs, squeezing, thumbs grazing the most sensitive skin of the inner thighs.
Harry dug the toe of his trainer into the carpet of leaves and pine needles. “Right. They told me Malfoy asked them not to tell me about him being in Oregon. I reckoned he asked you the same thing? Malfoy didn’t want me to know where he was.”
“All right. Fine. Sit there, on the floor. No, don’t question me. See? Look.” He slid from his chair. “Like this. Now, you here. That’s a good boy.”
Malfoy let out a startled noise as Harry hauled him in for a kiss. His mouth tasted like salt from the ocean spray. He kissed back, sweet and slow. They were the last two people at the edge of the world.
Harry sniffed, but couldn’t suppress a fond smile. He opened the locked cabinet and pulled out the little altered pensieve, a one-of-a-kind artifact made by Draco to project memories into the air. Their work required them to view memories sometimes, and Draco was not a fan of the usual method of splashing down into them. Neither was Harry, for that matter. The projected memories weren’t as immersive as the usual pensieve variety, but they typically worked for their purposes—including personal projects.
“Hey,” Harry said, looking around the room. “Those paintings. They’re the same as the things in your coffeehouse. The photograph of the big rock on the beach and that water spout. The black and white ones. These are the same things, right? Except in color.”
For no discernible reason, Harry blushes furiously. “I just wanted you to see I’m not here as an auror.”
Harry took the plate that Malfoy grinningly offered and loaded pieces of fried onion onto it. Something to balance out the alcohol sounded very good right now.
Some sense—perhaps a holdover from Voldemort’s stay at the Manor, when Draco had lived in a state of hypervigilance; or maybe it was a touch of the
Abruptly, Ginny inspected the broom in her hand. She cast the charms on it. Her spellcasting was quick, her movements tight and her words barely a whisper. She had a look of utter concentration on her face. It was so different from Luna’s casting, which was airy and light, with broad, soft wand movements and lyrical incantations. They suited each other, he realized.
He thought he might have Teddy over for a week or two, but Andromeda informed him that the boy was visiting their family in France and wouldn’t return till shortly before the Hogwarts Express left for school.
Back in the kitchen, Malfoy sits at the table, docile as a puffskein, while Harry sets the pot to boil. He takes the proffered cup with a murmur of thanks and gazes at the wall while he holds it near his mouth. Harry sips his own but mostly wants something warm to hold. He wonders if he should be concerned about Malfoy, but honestly, he doesn’t care. He’s far too frustrated with himself, and he is over this entire situation. He wishes—suddenly and fervently—for drinks at the pub after work, the drained but satisfied feeling of accomplishment following a day in the field, and the tingle of residual magic. He wants his old life back so sharply he could shout. He’s been living as a ghost for months. Seeing himself from the outside in the memories, he almost didn’t recognize himself.
A little bell rang above. The rich smells of coffee, sugar, yeast, and chocolate greeted him. A coffee machine buzzed in the far corner.
Harry’s gaze sweeps automatically around the space. He’s not sure what he expected. He vaguely recollects Malfoy Manor, but this is nearly as different from the Manor’s cool marble and white balustrades as Hermione and Ron’s little home. A thick fleece jacket hangs from a hall tree to the side. Shining leather brogues line a shoe rack. There’s a collection of needlepoint still life studies depicting aubergines and cauliflower and carrots, an etching of thestrals, and a little felted wool birdhouse that is a replica of the cottage. Books on a shelf. A broom in the corner.
Harry stopped in front of Malfoy’s home. It looked exactly like the others in the row with its tan brick face, white-trimmed windows, and iron-grey door.
Harry liked his job. He liked solving problems and closing cases and working late on most nights of the week because it suited him. He’d made deputy head auror by age 25, and with any luck—that is, if Robards would ever retire or be promoted to head of DMLE—he’d make head auror by 30. His life was anchored by comfortable routine, but he saw enough action to keep it interesting. He wasn’t stressed; he wasn’t bored.
He considered protesting, considered going downstairs to spend time with both of them. He was here to visit them, after all. But honestly, all he wanted was to curl up in the soft quiet of the room, and Luna was smiling her permission at him.
Draco caught the plate of toast before it fell to the floor and got a handful of butter and jam for his trouble. He extracted the letters from the ruins of his breakfast, cleaned them with a charm, and threw another charm at the tea splashed across the kitchen.
He looks aside, throws a hand out, grabs the first book he touches. Opens it on his lap and pretends to have been perusing the literature the entire time. Malfoy doesn’t say anything, and Harry doesn’t look up again.
Harry touched his face and felt stickiness. He licked his fingers and then dragged his tongue over his lips. “Is it gone?”
“I can appreciate the history without appreciating the flavor.” He shot Malfoy a warning look before picking up the last of the glasses. It looked…promising. A bright golden color. He ignored the looks of his friends—Ginny’s gleaming eyes, Luna’s expectant smile, Malfoy’s faint smirk—and took a drink. It was easier to ignore them now that he was starting to feel a little warm. He rolled the beer around in his mouth before swallowing.
Pursing his lips in an annoyed moue, Draco said, “We just made that one.” But he was already turning to the page. It fell open, and for a moment, it looked like a mishmash of colors and shapes, not quite coherent. Then Draco ran a finger over the bottom of the page, and a number of paper cutouts sprang to life.
Harry lifted an eyebrow. He was aware of Malfoy looking at him, but he didn’t turn. Ginny pinched him on the ribs and reclaimed her beer.
Harry scraped along the wall Malfoy presented, and maybe if Harry were someone else, it would have deflected him. But Harry had known Malfoy almost his entire life, had studied him, fought him.
The quill returns to the inkwell. Harry feels the slightest thrill of magic shiver through the air (drying the ink, he guesses), and then Malfoy folds the parchment and sets it to the side. He reaches for another blank sheet. Harry clears his throat.
“Then I don’t need to say a thing to you. ‘Voluntary,’ it says, right here. I hardly see the point of calling it
Malfoy looks unfairly good as he kneels in front of the hearth and rests his long-fingered hands, with their bony knuckles and manicured nails, on his thighs. He is still fully dressed, as if it isn’t evening and he isn’t home. He’s in dress robes, pressed and neat and buttoned up to the collar, and he has been since early that evening, as if he’d got dressed for the hearing-that-wasn’t. Despite the mocking tone of his voice, the set of his mouth is grim. The green glow of the floo brings out planes in his face Harry didn’t notice before, paints them in shadow and then smooths them out again with flickering light.
Draco tapped his quill against the page and quelled his rising irritation. “Yes. In fact, it does, Potter. If they had a license to produce potions from certified formulas, they’ll have had access to approved ingredients suppliers. If they didn’t, they would have used a different supply chain. Not to mention their setup would be drastically different in both cases. Do you really know nothing about the cases you’re investigating?”
Though, she could raise her eyebrows as high as she’d like in his imagination, he wouldn’t read the thing now.
She smiled. She was his height, and she wore her long red hair in a plait coiled at the back of her head in a way that made her seem like a no-nonsense kind of person, but she was being very patient with him. This might have been because, first thing in the morning, he had apparently impressed her with his knowledge of timing and Stasis Charms, and thus she thought he was some kind of culinary genius. So she was probably being much more patient with his wandering focus than she otherwise might have been.
He didn’t have much of an appetite despite his eventful morning—the pastry he’d had earlier had done it for him—so he picked through half the salad and soup and bread that Ginny dished out for him.
Malfoy gripped Harry’s shoulders. “Oh, my god. Touch it. Please.” His tone was raw. Malfoy—nearly incoherent.
“Peafowl. We had peafowl.” Draco shuddered. “And I’d have to be truly mad. I spent my childhood being chased by those terrors, thank you kindly. No.”
—and safeguarded Luna’s feelings and ran a Muggle coffee shop. No, Harry wasn’t innocent of having his own preconceived notions about Malfoy. They had a lot of history. And for someone who apparently still believed Harry was an arrogant attention-seeker, Malfoy was exhibiting remarkable civility.
Would Malfoy pull his dick all the way out if he didn’t respond? Harry didn’t want to know. He gave a tight nod.
Harry tried to ring Malfoy up, though he botched the attempt because he’d never used a till before. Sophie canceled the transaction and showed him how the system worked. When Harry was done and handed over the bag with three hat boxes in it, Malfoy smirked at him.
Malfoy has done…all of this. All of this, without taking credit for it. The public doesn’t know about it—but the Ministry knows, and they treat him like a criminal. It’s like the Ministry has stolen something precious and personal from Malfoy without Malfoy knowing.
Malfoy snorted and glanced at it, then slipped it into his own pocket. “Come on, then.” He waved at the person behind the counter, who glanced up from flipping through books to beam and wave back. The flock of birds burst across their face, dodging around their smile.
,” Malfoy says, and the way he says it—a little forceful, and a little incredulous, and a little like a question—makes Harry’s heart squish.
“Peer-reviewed journal,” Draco corrects. “And—” He cranes his head over the cover of the publication as if checking that it’s right-side up. “Just making sure.”
Harry wasn’t sure he’d heard correctly, even as Malfoy drew up onto his knees, unbuttoning his shirt and Summoning lube.
“But what are they doing? Are they…?” Harry couldn’t make himself say what it looked like they were doing.
Harry felt faint again. He reached a hand behind himself blindly, planted it against the floor, and sat.
A cold sweat broke out on Harry’s neck, although it wasn’t like he should be nervous to miscast on Malfoy. After all, the arse had come looking to embarrass him. It would serve him right for Harry to make the hat too tight on his head.
“The only thing the healers at St Mungo’s were able to tell was that my current state probably has something to do with the potion and not just the spell. How they react together, or something. But since they didn’t know the spell or the potion, there wasn’t much they were able to do, as you can see. They recommended I visit potions experts who had more experience with the…esoteric theory of potions.” Potter flapped his hand and made a face. Then his expression darkened. “The ‘experts’ they recommended found me very
“You’ll be fine,” he told himself. “You’ve achieved far greater feats under more pressure than this.”
“I’m not a ghost,” Potter said. He looked down at his mostly see-through body. “I know what it looks like, but I’m not actually dead.” Then, when Draco still hadn’t said anything, he added almost sheepishly, “I need your help.”
Overwhelmed with admiration—and maybe a little turned on again—Harry kissed the top of Draco’s head.
Malfoy showed Harry a few more basic drinks, and soon they fell into a rhythm: grinding beans, loading the espresso machine, steaming milk, pouring coffee, stirring in syrups, applying whipped cream, assembling sandwiches, removing rolls and desserts from the cases—all while insulting each other, to the amusement of Heather and the customers.
He found himself scrutinizing the fit of his jeans—wishing he knew how to Transfigure clothes—and huffed at himself.
“Speaking of simple tastes,” Malfoy said as the waitress arrived with the tray of food and set the cottage pie in front of Harry.
“G’night,” Harry says quickly. He dashes the powder into the fire, says, “Twelve Grimmauld Place,” and drops into green flames.
“Ham and egg sandwich, no eggs. And a brulee coffee,” the waitress said, and Harry gave a little jump.
“I’m fine. Malfoy. I’m fine.” Harry grips Malfoy’s arm, the one still clutched to Harry’s own shoulder. “Merlin. Fuck.”
“I assume they vanished it. Granger had copies of the manuscript she turned over to the Ministry. But no one’s supposed to know that.”
A gleam came into Draco’s eyes. He leaned down to bite Harry’s chin, dragged his mouth up to press a quick kiss to Harry’s. “Trust me?”
He blinked into the darkness, heart racing, still groggy and half out of sorts—but fully awake thanks to his experience as an Auror and, before that, always being on edge during the war, ready to wake at a moment’s notice.
Malfoy talked, and they passed out of the city and into the countryside again, and then into the mountains. The transition sneaked up: first the mountains loomed ahead, and then they were no longer visible, and the car was straining up twisty roads, and by the time Harry realized they were in the mountains, they were already heading down again, and they’d arrived on the other side.
It ends on Harry moving around his house, restless, waiting for news. That scene has a disconcerting echo to it, being as it happened so recently. Does he really look that pasty and unkempt?
The sensation of Apparition was even more uncomfortable on the trip home. Luna took them, having only had the one beer. Harry felt sick and displaced when they got back.
Malfoy grins a lazy, vaguely predatory grin and finishes his brandy. Harry, figuring what the hell, tosses back the rest of his.
This was one consequence of finishing work on the house: Harry had nothing left to do. It gave him an uncomfortable feeling, an itch under his skin that wouldn’t go away.
“Shoo! Away with you!” He took a menacing step closer to them. They scattered a few feet, flicked their ears, continued to chew.
Harry scrambled to do the math. Luna and Ginny would have come six years ago now; he remembered because he had just made Senior Auror position around the same time. So, Malfoy had come after them.
“Um. You’ve got a lot of Muggle things? Non-magical things. Is that what I’m supposed to notice? I’m not very good at this game.”
“They aren’t fond of being stared at,” Malfoy said under his breath. He glanced at the slip of paper again. “Here.” He strode to the center of the aisle, stopped, and ran his finger over the books till he came to a thick blue spine. “This one.” He drew it out.
The symptoms were never the same. Different effects, different potions. A witch whose skin burned anyone who touched it. Another who’d been irreversibly blinded. A wizard who could not stop laughing. But the lab had traced nearly all of the potions to the same brewer. Something to do with equipment and adulterants.
The process of hat-making, itself, was actually more interesting than Harry had thought it would be—that is, slightly more interesting than watching a Flobberworm eat lettuce—but Sophie didn’t let Harry try any of the techniques, only moved from demonstrating one to the next. A few times, he paused to assist a customer. In one case, the customer purchased a hat that needed to be refitted.
But Malfoy had already turned away and avoided meeting Harry’s eyes in the mirror behind the counter.
His heart gallops, and for an instant, he fears his lungs will constrict. But they don’t. He runs a shaky hand through his hair, feeling like an idiot.
Across the field, Luna clutched her Emitter in both hands. Ginny held hers in one, resting on her shoulder. Malfoy cradled his to his chest.
They followed a wooden walkway alongside a window into the kitchen, which Harry happened to glance at just as a plume of flame exploded up. Past a dining room that appeared as if it were underwater, with rippling green reflections on the walls (it reminded Harry of the Slytherin common room). Past a twisty stairwell that led to a basement room from which sounds of laughter floated up, along with something like a donkey braying. Around a corner to a door carved with fantastical creatures Harry didn’t recognize.
He gathers them all and tamps them into one pile and drops them in the outbox. If there’s one thing he’s learned in adulthood, it’s that it is often more effective to leave with a softly closed door rather than a slammed one. No use leaving a mess of an office and giving Robards more to be angry about. Especially if he’s just earned himself a place in Malfoy’s investigation as another suspect.
it. He reveled in the sense of power; it was the first time he’d ever felt completely in control of himself, and by extension, the world around him. He could relax on pub nights without worrying about his emotions scrawling across his face. He hid boredom during staff meetings. Smirked at the wizards and witches who tried to befuddle him with a look.
Eventually she calms, and they go over her notes together. The case file is surprisingly true to the real story. It states that Malfoy was accusing Poesy Potions of releasing toxins into the water supply and was attempting to rally public outrage and panic. The problem is that the authors of the file accuse Malfoy of making up false information against Poesy, or at least vastly exaggerating it for the purpose of creating dissent.
“Look at these ceiling beams,” Potter went on. His gaze raked across the ceiling, over the hooks and the things hanging from them. “Are those embroidered oven gloves?”
, by the expressions on their flushed faces. He could call ahead like a reasonable person, but then, he honestly didn’t feel like interacting with anyone right now. The cheese and Branston sat wrong in his stomach. Honestly, he wanted to go home, drink a lager, and put something with less…vinegar in himself.
Harry laughed some more, helplessly. The breeze brought with it a waft of roses. The sun shone down. Malfoy kept talking, and Harry didn’t mind.
Harry realizes he’s smiling back. In fact, he’s been holding Malfoy’s gaze for longer than is socially acceptable. He looks away.
Malfoy sighed. “Here,” he said, pushing a pile toward Harry. “Can you put your energy to use and do a search for Brownish Blight, Sickle Leaf, and Withering Waste? Have you used the Advanced Search Charm?”
Basic etiquette, and his total vocabulary, have vacated him. He’s not sure what to say next, though turning and walking through the door without another word would be rude, wouldn’t it?
“Have you run into any othelias, Harry? It’s hard to tell. You can have them living in the walls for generations and not know it. Daddy has the contact for a witch who relocates them. I’ll get her name for you.” She added, “I think it’s good that you’re finally giving the house some attention.”
Malfoy in the photo narrows his eyes at Harry. Harry indulges himself, sticks his tongue out. Then he lowers the scandalized photo—hesitates a moment as if he might change his mind and take it with him—drops it on top of a delivery menu, closes the drawer.
. That is exactly the sort of perfectly calculated thing for a Slytherin to say to a Gryffindor to throw said Gryffindor off of his trail. The whole situation is too perfect to be anything but an act. The ferocious, dignified martyr. The manuscript, which—who would understand any of it, anyway? It’s all a trick, of course. So what is Malfoy really up to?
In the sitting room, the curtains have been tied back, and bright sunlight fills the space. Harry activates the table’s extension charm, and it dutifully expands. Harry thinks it
“Come on,” Malfoy said, with an expression Harry couldn’t quite read, but made his stomach heat. “They’re upstairs in my bedroom.”
Before that first trip to Hogwarts, Harry hadn’t observed much scenery. And now it occurred to him that he hadn’t seen much outside of Grimmauld Place and the Ministry, either, since he’d signed on as an Auror. Even out in the field, he hadn’t paid much attention to the world around him, except to remain vigilant for danger. Now, Harry relaxed and took in the sights—the window displays, the older brick buildings butting up against newer facades, the quirky shop names.
Harry’s lungs squeeze a little at Malfoy’s sincerity, and this time, it has nothing to do with a surge of wild magic. He clears his throat. “Yeah, she’s something special, Hermione.”
“No. We’re not getting engaged, thank you very much. But we will be coauthors. Well, we are coauthors, now. Look!”
Here is some English for your Ministry to consider: take your piece of parchment and fuck off. This is harassment.”
He clunked the glass down. “First off, my dating life is off the table.” He could see Ginny working up a gleaming retort to that and pushed on: “Second? Second, let’s talk about something else.”
“You’re awful quiet,” Ginny said, nudging his foot with her toe. Harry could hear the smirk in her voice.
He Vanished objects that were crumbled beyond repair, even by magic, including a chest full of dolls that looked Muggle in origin. The doll heads collapsed at his touch and might have been cursed because he felt a sudden wave of euphoria and dizziness. Alarmed and reeling—nearly laughing at the madness of the situation (though that had to be from the effects of the curse)—he got rid of the lot with a wave of his wand.
So Harry wrote a memo to Shacklebolt politely declining the position. After only a moment’s thought, he recommended the name of Jaya Singh. She was two years younger than him but shrewd and ambitious and fiercely protective of her fellow Aurors.
“Oh, that looks good, Harry,” Luna said, glancing at the pepper slices on the cutting board. “The seeds can go here.”
, Harry James Potter, and we needed you to retain a modicum of plausible deniability. For Draco’s sake, if not yours. The hearing would have been canceled today, and it would have been obvious to anyone looking at you that it wasn’t a surprise.”
Harry’s heart raced. He didn’t know if he was begging Malfoy to put his finger in, or what. But god, he actually
Harry’s done this a dozen times. He’s practiced the speech, knows how to word the order so it sounds like a request. But what springs from his mouth is, “You’re to submit for questioning.”
Him and his pitiful face and so-called forgetfulness and his unmistakable lies and still-messy hair and his attempts to
“Ah,” Draco said, but before he could get a hand on the old man’s shoulder, Edward was off looking at the next plant, as if he were on some bloody garden tour.
It wasn’t like Harry was disappointed for Malfoy. Merlin forbid. Only, he was…surprised, that was all. Surprised, because he knew the intelligence behind those haughty eyes, and Malfoy was… Well, by anyone’s standards, Malfoy was striking. The pointed features somehow suited him in adulthood. The grey eyes and white blond hair were eye-catching and rare. You didn’t forget him, that was for sure.
Ron came over that night and brought a Chinese takeaway. Harry got the sense that Ron was checking in on him, and he wondered if Hermione had put him up to it. Or maybe Molly, judging from the treacle tart Ron pulled from his robe pocket and un-shrank for him. But Ron maintained a friendly cheerfulness, and Harry went along with it as they unpacked the chow mein and rice and chips and a mound of sweet and sour chicken.
“Slightly concerned…so you baked enough pastry to feed a small army. This is really good, by the way. So what were you…
Harry blinks with dawning realization. “You’re jealous. That’s what’s going on here. Malfoy, do you think I
Hills sees him first and stops dead in the threshold. The grizzled old auror goes still, not a flicker of expression on his face.
, but hadn’t evinced any of the same spectacular effects as a potions ingredient. Draco kept it as a decorative feature more than anything. Although, despite its uselessness, it was still decidedly not muggle.
“Dark artifacts,” Bate says, and though Harry can’t see the man’s face, the sneer is there in his voice.
Above the counter, a huge slate board on the wall listed the menu items in neat rows, surrounded by hand drawn roses in colored chalk.
They had half the dough folded, and the timed Stasis Charms set on the individual balls, when Harry’s stomach rumbled loudly.
Harry didn’t mind. He stood near the entrance of the shop, watching the passersby and listening to the hats mutter. Occasionally, he stepped aside for a customer to wander in or out.
They had waited till they were in the car to cast the Drying Charms, when no non-magicals were looking. Then they dried the damp seats below them. Neither of them mentioned the charm Malfoy had used to catch Harry from falling onto the rocks. Harry hoped that, in the confusion of water erupting, none of the non-magicals had noticed. There was a chance Malfoy would receive a citation. Harry didn’t know enough about American magical laws. But Malfoy didn’t seem bothered about it. He was too busy spelling the salt from the upholstery.
They ended up in the living room, where the fireplace lay dormant for the summer. Harry claimed a squashy armchair that was very comfortable.
Harry placed his plate and cup in the tub, while Malfoy waited near the table with a lightly supercilious look that Harry chose to ignore.
Reluctantly, Harry holds it out. He watches Malfoy’s eyes scan the page, watches the expression harden. Malfoy hands it back to him with a sneer. “Are you arresting me, Potter?”
He opened his mouth to tell the cashier what he wanted, then realized that his usual drink order—with its mound of whipped cream and candied lemon zest—would not make for a good to-go beverage.
Harry looks up with a scowl, in no little part because Malfoy sounds half sincere with his offer and because yeah, it would help.
Harry dumps his handfuls of weeds into a pile and brushes dirt from his palms. He doesn’t really allow himself to think about what he’s doing, only goes to the kitchen sink to wash the remaining dirt away, wanders into the drawing room, and throws floo powder into the flame, calling out Malfoy’s address.
the bruise blooming on his cheek and hip, but he accepted the hand Edward offered. He stopped himself just short of brushing off his trousers—his
Harry wondered what one of the larger ones looked like. He could imagine Ginny giggling downstairs at his reaction. He and Luna stood in a sitting area with a door to an en-suite. There was a rug and two upholstered chairs and a small coffee table rendered from a cut log in between them, next to a black iron stove. A blue kettle sat on the stove top. There was a large bed that could have fit three people with a quilt atop it. Beyond that: a more private sitting area with an escritoire, a wooden chair, and a bookshelf with a number of titles. There was even a small box that shimmered with preservation charms for food and drink. In short, it looked like its own cabin.
He liked working late. The main lighting charms were turned off, leaving only his desk lamp and the vaguely blue glow of the emergency illumination. No one else was in the office; he could work without anyone popping in to ask unimportant questions, to cajole him into coming to the canteen for coffee, or to ask for an update on the report he was scheduled to present at the staff meeting in an hour. He could put his feet on the desk without anyone looking at him askance.
He knew he’d been dreaming before he woke. The strands of it stuck and pulled away like a cobweb at the back of his mind. If he grasped for them, they collapsed and disappeared. So if he’d dreamed of the impending crisis, he wouldn’t know.
obliviated. They don’t have enough yet to prove that the obliviated memories have to do with his research surrounding Poesy, or that any of that terrible monologue of his was artificial.”
Harry sits cautiously. This time, Malfoy scoots his own plate toward himself on the table and sets the platter to hovering, making room for Harry to put his plate down.
Malfoy sniffed. “See over there? There’s a small donut shop that sells an Earl Grey flavor with lavender icing. Very tempting to recreate the recipe. And in that general direction is a bakery that advertises making everything on site, but I’ve seen them hauling boxes in from Costco. How no one recognizes those giant poppyseed muffins, I have no idea.”
