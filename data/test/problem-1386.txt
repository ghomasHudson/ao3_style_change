Harry didn’t feel like going back to the Great Hall just yet though. So he continued his route through the school. Pausing every now and then to remember.
The shouts suddenly turned to hushed whispers. But no one came to open the door. Harry sighed in frustration, and slid his back down the wall.
He was hyper aware of everything, so when Harry sat down beside him he jumped.
“I ordered muggle furniture because I was afraid that no wizard would want to show their face.” He said.
“Umm, a sour taste in my mouth?”
And on his bare chest.
“But.. that still doesn't prove anything! He’s still an asshole. A Death Eater.”
“So, if you wanted to apologize to someone, and they kinda hate you now, how would you go about doing it?”
Kreacher was standing there. Not only that but he was wearing clothes. What the hell?
“Who?”
“Granger. I need to talk to you.”
Suddenly Harry was on his back, and Draco was on top of him pinning his arms above his head.
Draco rolled his eyes, “I’m touched by your sympathy, Ronald.”
Harry looked up with an even more confused look, “Hagrid.”
“Ah, but how could I forget? You tagged along after Potter all throughout your school years.”
Ron looked down at the cake on the floor, anger clearly forgotten, “We support you either way, mate.”
But he’s Draco Malfoy, the person who practically lives off of my misery. But here he is not teasing me about my panic attack. It’s upside down. And earlier I heard him say: fuck you to Snape. What the hell is going on? It’s suspicious behavior.
Hermione’s eyes widen and she looks dumbfounded. “Of course.” She says when she finally gets her voice back. “How about tomorrow evening in the far corner of the library?”
“Draco! Don't talk like that! You know that your parents care. At least a little bit. And I was given the task of protecting you, by your mother. We made an Unbreakable Vow!”
Draco nodded. This was dangerous. Coming out. Harry could tell the press, and then his marriage would be ruined.
“Oh, Harry, I'm so sorry.” Hermione said softly.
Draco looked at her in shock, “What! No! I can’t do that! We have to keep the Malfoy bloodline!”
Draco raised his eyebrow at Weasley before addressing the other man, “Good morning Potter, I assume you got the case files from Head Auror Banks?”
Charlie was always talking about dragons and Ginny kept gushing over Luna. As it turned out Ginny had been the one to break up with Harry because she saw that they both needed it.
I hope you enjoyed it! Constructive criticism, comments and Kudos are always appreciated!
Is black and blue.”
“You okay?”
I hope Draco’s doing okay.
Harry woke to a sharp knock on the door and Hermione’s voice ringing through the fog in his head. “Harry? Harry. Are you alright? How’d it go?”
“Lumos Maxima Reverto.”
“Potter! What the fuck are you doing?!”
“Don’t call me that.” Harry said automatically. “What do you want.”
“I wanted to ask if you’ve seen Malfoy lately.”
Draco resisted.
“Master Draco! You’re back!” He squealed. “Can I take your stuff?”
“Nothing! You can go back to class!” Harry snapped.
His father was only a foot away now. “Yes. I was quite disappointed in myself when I learnt that I had raised a faggot.”
Harry had been staring at those words for the past fifteen minutes and he had yet to think of anything good. His motivation was nowhere to be found. ‘Pull yourself together Potter!’ He told himself, 'You need to fix your friendship!’
“What is this unbreakable vow?” He asked, feigning innocence.
That’s weird. I expected him to be an ass about it. But he seems… almost like he doesn’t care.
Harry whipped his head around, she was smirking at him.
Draco bit his lip, thinking hard. There *had* to be a pattern here. He gasped. “The full moon!”
“This year we’ll only be covering the more advanced things. Such as Vanishing and Conjuring. But be warned: this year will only be challenging if you make it so.
Draco flicked the Time-Turner on the table, “Ok,” he said, “But there were rules made at the beginning of time. The Time-Turners are made so that they can feel human emotions, but a human has to be wearing it. Trust me, I don't know who came up with that crazy idea. But they must be related to you, Potter.”
Harry stood back up, “Nah, I like making you squirm.”
Draco watched Harry’s pupils blow wide and he seemed to have lost the ability to speak because he mutely nodded. He was aroused.
“About time.”
Ron let out a loud sigh, “Whatever mate. I think Dumbledore’s gotten to your head.”
Ron chuckled, “Oh, yeah. Harry told us that you got a Howler from your mum! He said that you were too afraid to go back.”
“Well, I /am/ still mad at Blaise for outing me. But honestly, I don’t think anyone will do anything. And I would like to see them try.”
“Okay…umm, can you do something for me? Can you breath? In and out? In and out.” Harry kept up a rhythm and eventually he saw Draco’s chest match his words.
“Draco, Ron came to make sure you were okay.” Harry said.
There were flowers all around. It looked like it was out of a movie. Draco paused at a Dancing Night Lily bush. He picked one off and held it up to catch the light of the moon. It started to wriggle, then twirl, until it was twisting around his palm with grace.
“The spell damaged his body and his brain is perfectly intact. But. With a spell like this we don’t know how it’s going to react if we try and mess with the brain.”
Harry waggled his eyebrows, “Kiss me again?”
I nod, and smirk at his baffled face. We’re toe to toe now and I can see every single blonde eyelash.
“Are you sure?” She asked, smirking, “All those years of you two fighting, I always thought it was just that. But looking back on it, I can’t believe I couldn’t sense the sexual tension!”
“I know you’re usually the one to do this, but I wanted to do it this once.”
“And you’ve gotten yourself right in Potter’s inner circle. Excellent! Now you can finnish the boy once and for all.”
“Draco, listen to me! This task the Dark Lord has given you, is not to be taken to foolishly. You need to put your brain into this one!”
“And that one right above us. That’s Draco. The one I was named after.”
Malfoy walked past him and drawled, “I don’t think I will.”
Draco looked around. He saw train tracks. Except they were up in the air, and looping all over the place. And what looked like a really big pink snake was stopped in the middle of them.
Anyway, I'm ranting. TW: none for this chapter, except cringe, if you get triggered by that.
Ron glanced at his girlfriend in surprise. “You only swear when you mean it.”
“I’m a Malfoy aren't I?”
The trio walked over to the Hogwarts gates, there they found Ron, Hermione, Dean, Seamus, Parvati, Lavender, and Luna.
He and Neville sat down at a table in the furthest corner of the library. They were quiet for a long time.
Sorry if this chapter is a little sloppy. I kinda crammed a bunch of shit together. I don't know how it turned out. So good luck.
Harry’s voice was tentative as he said, “Are you alright?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco tried not to show any surprise. He had watched Unspeakable after Unspeakable be assigned field tasks while he stayed at his office.
Draco thought for a moment, “We’re not seeing any magic at the coordinates right now right?”
“But, it’s too heavy!”
Draco raised an eyebrow, “Sing something?”
“A rabid bear. He died right before I got here.”
“But, I let Sirius die! It’s my fault if I hadn’t been so hot headed, maybe he would have survived.”
Draco took the Time-Turner and murmured a couple of incantations. They all bounced off of it.
Draco could have laughed at that if there wasn't so much pain. Everything was blurry. He pointed at the Time-Turner. He barely got out the words: “Try… go back…”
Harry sighed and snuggled deeper into Draco’s side. “You take my breath away.” Draco murmured.
“Then I will leave you to rest, but I am taking your wand ‘till morning.”
They fell into an awkward silence and Draco couldn’t shake his feelings. Then Harry mumbled something.
Malfoy smirks, “Oh, you'd be surprised. I’m sure it never got through that thick skull of yours, but we are wizards.”
He lifted his head. He was standing on a metal platform high in the sky. There were other metal platforms too. They were all connected in a big circle.
So please, if you can, will you meet me in the kitchens tomorrow after classes. I really want to fix things. (Bring Ron too.)
Harry shrugged. “Well it’s kind of my fault that you ‘lost’ it anyway.”
Harry’s confidence slowly dimmed as Malfoy looked back and forth between him and his hand with a raised eyebrow.
Harry looked like he wanted to argue, but Draco wasn’t going to let him. He had so much shit to get off his chest.
Narcissa stared at him, her eyes wide.
“What letter!” Lucius growled digging the point of his wand into Draco's neck.
“What if we tried the Unforgivable Curses? I mean they might not do anything but they might have some effect on it.”
Quinn looks at her, “Mine. It has less people, so we won't get caught.” They kiss Pansy pationently before starting on their lunch.
And Harry was ever so confused when Mrs. Weasley hugged him for the first time. He thought she might be attacking him.
“Tom is dead.”
“No problem, Potter.”
“I was born in a messed up century. My favorite flavored sweets were raspberry and amphetamines. I bought a car at age 16.”
Now, he could have easily gone into a dive and caught the snitch way before Harry even got a chance. But he had a plan, and it involved Harry catching the snitch.
“Snap out of it Harry!”
“Do. You. Want. Me. To. Go?”
Harry went over to the other end of the shop. When he told Ginny, she just smirked and waved him off.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Cause I'm not giving' up,
Harry dropped the razor and collapsed to the floor, blood spilling out of his cuts. Malfoy ran over, dropping down beside him and looking panicked.
I stare at Malfoy as if he’s a different species all together. “But you- you’re a Death-”
“Where have you been?” Hermione hissed in his ear.
Blaise took it. “The one regarding your sexuality.”
Malfoy’s eyes got even wider and he stood quickly and bolted up to the boy’s dorm stairs.
“Are you alright!” Harry panicked, “I’m so sorry! I should not have let you convince me to do that! You complete idiot! You could have gotten seriously hurt!”
“Yes, it was your idea after all.”
Ron looked dumbfounded. And a little confused, “But wait.” He said, “I was supposed to do that tonight!” He pulled a velvet box out of his pocket.
Harry did his best to glare, but it only made him look more winning. So, Draco finally relented, “Fine! Finite Incantatem.”
“Don’t mother-how-are-you me!” Narcissa snarled, throwing her gardening gloves at him. “You were gone for two whole days!”
There it was again, the whimper.
Harry ignored him, “So, what are you doing?”
Draco watched his expression turn even more puzzled. “What does it say?” He asked.
“Well, I suppose it depends what you mean by ‘crush’.” Harry was avoiding Draco’s grey gaze. He was blushing hard.
He jumped when he felt Harry sit down beside him. “Are you alright?’ He asked.
Then Lucius disappeared, leaving Draco to collapse in Harry’s arms one more. He started softly sobbing into Harry's shoulder. How they made it to the couch, he wasn't sure.
“It’s different once we get inside.” Harry reassured.
At this point Harry looked like he was getting uncomfortable. So (to Draco's relief) he jumped in before Narcissa could go crazy: “Mrs. Malfoy? Mrs. Malfoy, we have discovered that your Manor could be a possible place for the next time the Turner is used.”
Harry nodded, and Draco continued.
Draco exited the lift, his head down like usual. He walked down to his office and waved his wand. A cup of coffee appeared in front of him.
“Nothing!” Harry spat, trying to pull away.
“You can’t exactly get things precise with a wand especially if you’re painting.”
“That you wanted to ‘snog me senseless’? Yes even that part. Which reminds me.”
The Time-Turner started spinning out of control, and with it Draco’s thoughts.
“What he did to you is not irrelevant!”
Draco nodded and handed him a vile from his pocket. Harry bent down and forced the clear liquid down Lucius’s throat. They waited exactly 13 seconds for the potion to take effect, then Harry asked the first question, “Do you have the Time-Turner on you?”
No, not me,
The clerk at the store front heard him and pushed his way over to them though a crowd of Hogwarts students.
Harry paused, afraid that he was going to fall apart right there.
Harry hesitated, “My relatives had me make cakes before.”
“Yeah, umm… what’s this about?” Harry sat down across from Sadder on the blue plush chair.
Hermione looked up, “The Hogwarts Express is leaving tomorrow if you want to join us.”
Harry burst. He laughed so hard he clutched his stomach.
Harry still didn’t say anything, he just stood at the door trying to find the right words.
When Draco stepped into the sitting room, Harry was sitting on the sofa reading a book in his pajamas. He had obviously not expected Draco to come rolling out of the fireplace.
‘Brazzzil.’
Luna and Dean and Ollivander and the Goblin curled in a heap on the cold cellar floor of Malfoy Manor.
“Are you alright?” Harry asked, softly kissing Draco on the top of his head.
“No there isn't.” Harry glanced around the common room, “Actually, there might be.”
Draco roughly shook his head. “How many times do I have to tell you Potter? I made my own choices!”
“Yes it does! He was your gay awakening!”
“Hide it.” Harry said, looking down at the table.
“What? Oh…” Then the redhead launched into his explanation.
“Excuse me.” A figure walked up behind Lauren, “You’re bothering him. I would appreciate it if you would back off.”
“Wow. That's… wow.”
Hermione gave him a look, “You and Luna were the only ones not here, and then she appeared out of thin air. And remember you can't Apparate in the Hogwarts grounds.”
“Owls.” Harry sighed.
After further inspection of their surroundings Draco saw a small hut, er shack, standing a few meters away. It had an old dead snake pinned to the door.
“But… how…” Harry asked.
“Yes.” Harry answered honestly, turning back to the sun.
“He practically eye-fucked Harry!”
Harry turned to Draco, “We have everything we need for now. We can question him further at the office.”
“She said that a couple of days ago, she was cornered in the library by some sixth years and you came to her defense.”
He looks away. Whatever his emotions, he’s good at hiding them.
Ginny went into a shop and came out with half her head shaved. Luna gushed over it, while Harry and Neville exchanged a knowing look.
Harry’s blood ran cold, and he saw red.
“Good job guys.” Draco said. “Let's clear this old moldy furniture out.”
He pressed a small kiss to the cheek of the smaller man, and said, “We’ll be alright.”
“Of course not! Draco are you insane? I will not torture you! We already know one of them works, so why do we have to try another one?”
Draco decided to finnish the paperwork tomorrow and put it in his desk drawer. On the way out of his office he stubbed his toe and cursed, this day was only going to get worse.
“Can I see one.”
He saw Neville take a deep breath, “ImpansexualandIthinkIhaveacrushonBlaise!” Neville squeezed his eyes shut.
“Go right on ahead.” I say.
“No, I have talked to the Head of the Auror office and she has agreed to send one of her most trusted Aurors with you.”
Draco had seen the Weasley walking around Hogwarts with these. He had always been a little jealous of the warmth that they seemed to radiate. He had made fun of them, but only because he wanted one himself.
“Do you?”
“Well, he should have some common sense then.”
It was Malfoy.
“Hey Nev. how are you?” Harry greeted.
“So you have a chance with him!”
“They told me, casual affection leads to sexual infection. But it’s hard to get an erection when you're so used to rejection.”
But the thing that surprised Draco the most was when Harry wrapped his arms around him. Despite his brain screaming at him not to do it, Draco leaned into the touch. He was still shaking and felt oddly comfortable in Harry’s arms. Like that was where he was meant to be. And maybe it was.
“Draco, don’t be shy, come closer.”
I will stay with you,
“But why go with me?”
Draco rolled his eyes, recognizing that Ron was only teasing.
All of the Gryffindor 6th years grumble as they had the redhead their money. I'm appalled that they would do such a thing.
Draco turned his neck so fast he heard it creek, “How much did you hear?” He asked anxiously.
“And you can't wake him up?”
“I was just walking down the corridor to Trelawny’s office, when Luna. Luna Lovegood, just straight up kissed me! Right there! She grabbed my tie and kissed me! Harry, I've been waiting for this for so, so, so long! I think we’re dating now. I mean, who kisses and then just doesn’t date? It’s stupid. But we’re dating now! I think. Merlin! I’m dating Luna Lovegood!” Ginny lets out a girly squeal at the end.
Hermione slapped him, “It doesn’t matter. What matters now is getting Harry a date.”
Blaise smiled even wider, “I dare you to tell the group the secret you’ve been keeping from them.”
“I- I was just about to respond to your letter.”
Ron looked bewildered, “Who sent you that?”
“Thank you!” She squealed. “And umm, can I have your autograph?”
I glance across the classroom. Malfoy is measuring ingredients with precision. Sweat trickles down his forehead from the heat of the caldron. I won't be fooled. I know he’s up to something!
I whip around. “How the fuck do you know!” I shout. “I haven't told anyone except Ron and Hermione!”
“He took the Mark. Even if he isn’t one now, he was one then!”
Potter shuffled his feet; Draco knew exactly the ways to make him squirm.
“Welcome back.” McGonagall said when she reached them, there was a warmth in her eyes that hadn’t been there when she was addressing the other students.
“Nah, I don’t think I will. I like watching you squirm.”
She stood up and reached for the door, but Draco stopped her.
I stare at him stunned. Nevil has always insisted upon being straight. I definitely did not expect this.
That was 5 months ago. They’d been seeing each other in secret for a while now. Nobody knew, not even Ron and Hermione, well… they had their suspicions, but never confronted the pair directly. Draco and Harry also had to keep up their appearances in the corridors and classes. Although the teachers seemed to know exactly what was going on, Snape had even made a big deal of forcing them to be partners in potions. But maybe that was more for Harry’s humiliation.
“That was fifteen years ago. I don’t have the same voice.”
“Please stay.” He said in a scratchy voice.
“Oh come onnnnnn!” Harry whined, jumping down from the ladder. “I bet you can manage it.”
“So uh, thanks for finding a way to get the door open. I guess you were right.”
“Suuurrrre. You /never/ play that card.”
“Mostly peaches, oranges, reds and pinks. The colors you use when you paint your sunsets.”
“There were no reports about you breaking out of Azkaban. How did you do it?”
There was something about Harry's desperate look that made Draco want to comply. “Fine.” He huffed. “But only if you explain everything in full detail.”
Soon the two of them were in their backyard and Draco was holding the snitch in his gloved hand.
Ron and Hermione gasped as Harry’s silver dragon spun forth to carry his message to Molly.
“Morning. I owl’d your mum. She’s not too happy. I wouldn’t recommend going back there. At least right now.”
Hermione put a hand on Ron’s arm, “Calm down Ron. Let him go, he obviously needs it.”
Harry sighed and sat down on his bed. What he had said was the truth.
Draco rolled his eyes, “Merlin Potter! You're such a sap!”
‘Tick tock’ were the code words for ‘help’, and ‘stop the clock’ were the code words for ‘I need my wand.’
Draco shook his head not wanting to relive the moment.
“Potter, look at me.”
“Great.”
Malfoy took a deep breath. “I don’t know if we can forget the past. Or move on-” Harry tensed. “But we can move forward.”
Harry’s head shot up, “YOU PAINT SUNSETS!”
“Just… remember to take care of yourself alright?” Harry said.
“I’m sorry Mr. Potter, but sometimes the only thing we can do is let them go. Sometimes it’s too cruel to keep them in pain. We will keep giving him the potions for two more days in order for you to say goodbye. But he is still unconscious, so be prepared.”
Ron jumped to his feet, “What?! With who!?”
…Draco’s P.O.V 3rd person…
After that, Ron and Hermione went back to their flat and Harry was left to prepare for the full moon. Which happened to be that night.
“What? Did you want to beat them to it?” Draco smirked, “Aren’t you dating Ginerva? Winter could have cousins in no time.”
My knees get weak.
Ron glared at him, “Yeah mate, I think you did.”
I walk along the old corridor and Luna’s words ring in my ears. ‘The things we lose always have a way of coming back to us in the end.’
Harry stood there dumbly; it was the first time Draco had cried in front of him since their 6th year at Hogwarts.
Harry wandlessly summoned the file. Without explaining he grabbed Draco’s hand. For what felt like the uptenth time he was whisked unwillingly into darkness.
“Were you under the Invisibility Cloak?” Asks a voice behind me.
“You're avoiding my question.” Draco was getting angry. Why was Harry so reluctant to share what he knew.
“Tonight I’m taking you on a date.”
“Why yes, yes I do. I defeated the Dark Lord for Merlin’s sake.”
Also, thank you all for 100 kudos! It might not be that big of a number, but it still means a whole lot to me, so thanks!
Hermione rolled her eyes. “We’re over that remember!”
He couldn’t even control it. All of the Occlumency lessons with Snape and his mother, but none of them made any difference. Voldemort was too strong.
By the time Malfoy was finished with his rant, Harry was looking at him wide eyed. Malfoy sighed and seemed to gain more control over his temper, “Let me translate that for you: What the hell were you thinking? What would I have told Granger and Weasley? Do they know that you cut? Have you told them? Have they seen the other scars?”
I see, anger, resentment, disgust, and… fear? That was unusual.
Even when nobody else believes,
It swelled to the size of a door. And turned into a giant ball of flame. It was impressive magic. Only one person in the world would give it that kind of flare.
Draco snorted, ‘fancy spells’? “Sure.”
This year Harry didn’t want to be lonely for Christmas, so he had joined Ron and Hermione at the Burrow. Everyone welcomed him with open arms, you could expect nothing less from the Weasleys. They knew what a hard time Harry was going through, and would always take him under their wing.
Malfoy’s breath hitches, and I wonder if I said anything wrong.
Shit. I should have brought my Cloak! I’m an idiot.
“No father, I’m not going.”
“Well, I just wanted to ask you how you would feel if I started dating Ginny.”
Hermione Granger was standing outside the pub.
“I appreciate your concern, but I can handle my mother.”
Draco looked up from the mental he was dusting, “No. I usually don’t paint with canvases that big.”
“Harry James Potter, will you marry me?”
Harry hesitated, “Cedric.”
“Merlin’s tits Potter! How late do you normally sleep in.”
With it’s final words the Howler ripped itself up. Draco stood there as little bits of paper floated down on him.
“Okay… I was actually going to ask you a question.”
Theodore Nott piped up, “Last time I checked he was in the library.”
The air goes still. I look at him lost for words. “Dumbledore?” I finally mumble.
“Whatever lets you sleep at night, Potter.”
Draco felt an odd sinking feeling in his stomach. He had really just wanted to talk. But if this case is that important…
“Malfoy!” Ron shot up off the couch all of his weariness seemingly forgotten.
“Sorry?”
He looked back at his friends, who were smirking at him. “Okay… fine, maybe there is a little truth to your assumptions.”
“Oh.”
Harry nodded earnestly, “Yeah! I was going to come out to you later this year, but now I don’t have too.”
Harry blushed profusely, “I had Hermione look into that after the war, but she couldn’t find anything. And then I asked Olivander again, he said that your wand should have gone back to you after my wand was fixed. Then he did that thing where he says curiouser and curiouser over and over again.
I look up. Quinn’s standing there with their hands on their hips, looking remarkably like Mrs. Weasley.
When Harry opened the door to the eighth year common room, he found two people sitting on the couches. Ron and Hermione. ‘Here we go.’ He thought. Harry sighed and sat down beside them.
Oddly enough, Harry seemed even more disappointed than him. “Yeah,” he agreed, “Yeah. But I hope we can still be friends at least.”
I step out of the closet and wipe the tears off of my face. To my surprise I see that Malfoy is still sitting in the classroom, doing his homework.
So Draco did the only thing he could think of: Apparate right back to Number 12 Grimmauld Place.
“Look, can you just drop it?”
“Who will that be sir?” Draco asked, gritting his teeth.
Everyone in the room, (George, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, Bill, Fluer, and Charlie) all let out a “Finally!”
“Don't worry. I won’t break his heart. I’ll be nice in my letter!” He waved said letter over his shoulder, and heard Harry smack his head on the wall. Draco laughed; he knew exactly how to get under Harry’s skin.
“You said that last time.”
“It’s the same thing!” He said, holding up the parchment to Draco. “What are they talking about?!”
To his surprise Draco’s ears turned pink, “Sort of. I umm, I paint landscapes sometimes.”
As Harry walked down the empty corridors a feeling of nostalgia swept over him. He passed the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy's foolish attempt to train a group of eight trolls for the ballet. He could still recall the first time Fred and George had told him about it.
“EXPELLIARMUS!”
“Three, two, one!”
He looked zoned out, “What? Oh. Yeah. Here.”
“How do you know what I am! I’ve done things that would shock you!”
Harry burst out laughing, “Oh god! Even five-year-old-you was a prat. Trying to turn to a peacock, what would you do? Swish your feathers at intruders? My dad was something much more intimidating.”
“There is something I haven’t told anyone…”
But Ron and Hermione ignored him, and kept discussing all the times he had ‘flirted’ with Draco.
Draco’s eyes opened wide. What? He was supposed to be in Azkaban.
“Well, I don’t know. I guess I’m kind of hesitant. I mean you are the Great Harry Potter. Why would you want anyone to bother you with their struggles?” Draco was relieved he had managed again, to sound sarcastic.
His mother curled in a heap as Voldemort tortured her.
Harry gave him a doubtful look. “You can go if you want to. But I’m not sure you’ll come back alive. I took the wards off of Grimmauld, but I still think she’ll flay you if you Apparate there right now.”
Harry glanced up and down the hall, but saw nothing. He knew he wouldn’t fall back asleep any time soon, so he decided to take a stroll through the Manor.
“Ron? Hermione?”
“Right.”
Draco sighed. He really needed to be more careful. With a rather skilled flick of his wand his robes transfigured into regular muggle clothing. A crisp white button up shirt and some jeans.
Sadder gave him a curt nod and ushered Harry from his office saying, “I’m sorry to make you leave so soon but I have lessons to plan. Goodbye!”
“This is not nothing!” She retorted. “Professor! I need to take Harry to the Hospital Wing!”
“No fair!” Parvati grumbles, “You knew because of your skills in Divination.”
Harry scrunched up his face like he had just smelled something rotten.
“Mothers know these things Draco. Come. Let's ask the House Elves to make you some dinner.”
He took something out of his pocket, then handed Harry the small brown package. Harry opened it up to discover a pin that said ‘I’m the fucking Saviour of the world. Fear me.’
“Merlin Potter!” Draco huffed, “I can walk perfectly fine on my own thanks.”
The first one glared at him,  “You think you're so tough don’t you?”
“Probably in the sitting room.” Draco was struggling to breathe. It was like cold claws were wrapped around his lungs and slowly squeezing out all life. He was scared. His mother’s life was in danger from the criminal, and here he was too panicked to do anything. And if the criminal had the brains to get past their wards, they were in a lot of trouble.
Then he remembered all those years they spent antagonizing each other. There was really no need to after their third or fourth year, but they kept at it. Always trying to top the other with their pranks and insults.
Draco thought about it for a moment. “I suppose I never really wanted to date a girl. When Courtney asked me out on a date, I declined. I never really dated a girl.”
“You would choose Malfoy over us?!”
“Hey! How you been ‘arry?”
“Hey, Malfoy?”
Harry
“And you want to go?”
Harry looked reproachfully down at the elf, “I thought I told you to stop calling me that. And I would like you to please make Draco some breakfast.”
Ginny shrugged. “Yeah. It’s true. Although I wanted to be the one to tell you.” She shot Harry a dark look.
Second chances really did take courage.
None other than Lucius Malfoy was rummaging through the crates of food. Harry peered into the room and then looked at Draco.
Hermione rolled her eyes, “Merlin Ronald. Look beyond the tip of your nose!”
After they departed Draco and Harry were left feeling very awkward. Harry was very pissed. His bright green eyes turned to pierce Draco and he felt something swell in his chest.
“Oh. Yes. I suppose it is the reason.”
“Alright!” Ron exclaimed, “That cake is still sitting there, what are we waiting for?”
Everyone agreed, so Seamus explained, “We’re basically playing a word association game. I’ll start, I’ll say a word like: toe, and the next person has to shout the first word they thought of. Everyone got that?”
Harry laughed, “That’s the first thing you ask? Cedric I think.”
He turns around and starts to clean the shelves, leaving me to my thoughts.
“Oh right you can't! Cause they’re in AZKABAN!”
“Fine!”
“No. Owls.”
They were yelling now. “I’m not going to use the Cruciatus Curse on you!”
“Great!” Harry exclaimed before taking Draco wrist, and dragging him outside to the garden.
Potter looked confused, then he blinked and started to crack up. Draco started to laugh along with him. A light warm feeling was slowly creeping all through his body and he felt a lot lighter than he had all morning.
“Oh, shut up!” Harry laughed, “Actually, I came here to find you.”
An excited whisper sounded through the hall, as the last of the other students left.
“You two will be cleaning out the potions closet.” Snape gives me an evil look. “You have… two hours. No magic. And remember, don’t close the door behind you. Begin.”
“Luna! Chill out!” Harry put his hands on hers, “Of course I don’t mind. It’s great that you do!”
I'll wait for you.
I know that you probably hate me right now, after what I said to Ron. I want to explain everything in this letter, but I don't want to use up all of my scrolls.
When he passed the dungeons he pointedly did not look at them. They would cause him to collapse. Too many bad memories. He cast a Silencio on his and Harry’s feet as they neared the cellar.
When the waiter came to take their order, they also came with a letter for Harry.
He stood there feeling his heart race. His father hadn’t moved at all since Harry left. He was just staring at Draco with an odd glint in his eye. Draco had a closer look at his father for the first time in years.
Narcissa knitted her eyebrows, “Do you really think that I want you to produce an heir? Draco, I just want you to be happy.”
Ron held his hands up in defense, “Hey, I just want to help.”
Hagrid beams and tells us to go outback to the pumpkin patch. Then he hands us the Slug Repellent, and Brain Banisher.
“Someone convinced me to take my life back. To take it back from my father, the Dark Lord, my pure blood upbringing.”
“Then Fluer had her baby. When we went to that bar the Weasleys were so kind. But they had no right to be. Molly just forgave me on the spot. And Arthur didn’t even take my apology!”
“I can relate.”
“Yeah. Just a bit in shock. This letter says I was supposed to respond yesterday.”
“But that’s impossible.” He said for the second time, “Your magical signature, it changed.”
Harry walked down the stairs of Dumbledoor’s study. The rush of victory quickly replaced with cold, hard, sadness. Ron and Hermione had already gone down to the Great Hall. But he had stayed up in the Headmaster’s office, talking to the portraits about Dumbledoor and Snape’s last days.
Malfoy raises an eyebrow, “Potter, I *never* wanted to.”
He heard footsteps, and  then the faces of Ron and Hermione appeared out from behind Kreacher’s giant crockpot.
“Kiss me.”
He was right, when they got inside it was not at all what Draco was expecting. He was expecting a cozy cottage bar, instead he got a lively bar full of people. It was decorated in some sort of muggle fashion. There were bright colors everywhere you looked. One corner held a collection of bright sunglasses. Another held a rack of bright feather chains that looked extremely fake.
Draco felt his face start to heat up and he clutched the edge of the table until his knuckles turned white. “He said that did he?”
“As you know this is a makeshift year, a special year, a year to get back on your feet. So I have decided to make the rules a little less ‘air tight’. You will still have classes and N.E.W.Ts, but the curriculum won’t be as hard. You also get to enjoy the freedom of visiting Hogsmead every weekend if you so desire.”
Harry took a deep breath and tried to get his temper under control. He forced his face and posture to relax, “Ron, Hermione, there’s nothing to worry about. I’m perfectly fine. These are just scratches.”
And then we’re kissing.
Harry stepped into the room. One side of the room was decked out in Slytherin silver and green, and the other in scarlet and gold. ‘Whoever designed this place did a really terrible job!’ Harry thought, as he walked over to the Gryffindor side and pulled pajamas out of his trunk.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up, “You know Legilimency?”
Harry clutched his knees tighter and buried his face in them. His shoulders were shaking with sobs. He looked several years older thenwhat he really was. And in a way it was true. Not in years. But in heartbreaks, and pain, and sorrow. Draco had never felt more sorry for someone in his entire life.
Ron goggled, “You seriously didn’t realize before?”
“How are you?” I say. She looks quite happy.
“Are you okay.” He asked as they sat down under a tree.
Malfoy was sitting in a ball in the corner with his head in his arms. As soon as he heard his name his head shot up.
“Point made.”
He walked down several flights of stairs until he came to the portrait of the Fat Lady.
“Thank you for coming to see me Mr. Potter. Please, sit.”
With one final sigh Draco slipped into blackness.
Hermione’s eyes widened, “Oh… I’m sorry. I didn't kn-”
Harry's head snapped up, “Yeah?”
Draco could feel the blush start to creep into his cheeks, so he hid his face by picking up the files.
“Sir, there is a line!” The receptionist said firmly.
They tried several different spells, but none of them ever seemed to work. Then Harry suggested something that Draco was thinking about, but couldn’t say due to his ‘Deatheaterness’.
“Yeah.”
The boggart promptly shrunk down to the size of an ant and turned bright pink. Harry picked it up and slammed it into a drawer. Then he said a couple of spells and it was locked in there tight.
Who knew one kid from France could make such a difference?
I look up, Ginny is sitting down in Hermione’s empty spot.
A grumble passed around the room. Hermione ignored it.
“Yeah, mate.” Charlie said, “We all assumed that you two were dating when you brought him with you to the Broomsticks.”
“Honestly Potter, You can be so dense sometimes! Look at that giant hole in the middle of the tracks.”
Harry gave him another uneasy glance. His eyes glazed over and Draco knew what was coming. He braced himself.
“I mean that, in 6th year you were always saying how much of a Death Eater he was, and now you're defending him… it’s weird.”
Draco couldn’t stop. Tears poured like a waterfall down his cheeks and sobs raked his body. He put his head in his hands, and pulled his knees to his chest. He felt pathetic. He wasn’t supposed to cry. Let alone in front of Harry Potter.
“Potter. I-”
“You were always mean to everyone.” Harry snorted and Draco shot him a glare.
Harry rolled his eyes before calling, “Kretcher? Kretcher!”
“C’mon.” Harry said, pulling his jacket closer, “It’s getting cold, I can tease you more inside.”
Ron gasped, “Scratches my arse! Harry these aren't just scratches. We can see the blood coming through.”
Harry placed a hand on Draco's knee, and looked him right in the eye.
Draco’s feet slammed down on soft grass, they were once again on a grassy hillside. But this time it didn’t have the same eeriness as the other one. Instead it had a sort of calm. There was a singular tree at the top of the hill and Harry was already racing towards it. Draco had no choice but to follow the bastard and make sure he didn’t kill himself.
Harry’s P.O.V.
“Fine.” He mumbled, turning even redder, “I have a crush on you.”
A round of ‘here here!’s went through the room, and Hermione sighed.
Harry stepped onto the Hogwarts Express with Ron and Hermione, they walked into the first open compartment they could find.
He cared so much, that it made his heart hurt.
The jinx lifted and Harry’s chest rose and fell rapidly in order to get his breathing back to normal. Both men stared at each other for a while, Draco was sitting on top of Harry.
“Hey mate!” Ron said, getting up too. “I see you brought the ferret.”
“How did you get the Turner to listen to you?”
“You think about me in the morning?”
Harry inhaled deeply, and tried to steady his beating heart. “Fuck. Draco I think I’m falling for you.” Harry looked down at his hands and saw the tears fall from his eyes to his lap.
“That’s because she was worried. She’s more of an older sister. She wasn’t the one to get involved in the Dark Lord’s antics.”
“Spit it out then.”
So don't give up on…”
In fact, Lucius was taking out his wand. He pointed it at Draco's neck and dug it into his throat. “You thought you got off Scott free did you?”
But Harry wasn’t giving up that easily, “C’mon! What’s stopping you? Are you scared you won’t get it on your first try because-”
“I was attempting to go far enough back to re-hide the Dark Lord’s Horcruxes. I thought if I did it on the full moon then it would have more power. Because as you probably know from Astronomy: the moon represents time and change, and therefore the power in time intensifies. And with the added power of the Horcruxes magical signiture’s I hoped to go back far enough.”
Draco’s eyebrows felt like they were part of his hairline, “Quite alright Potter,” he said, “But you certainly have gained quite a mouth since school.”
Ron looked just as confused as he said: “I’ll do the first one: Never have I ever snuck into the Forbidden Forest.”
Draco was never the one to get drunk, but with the Weasleys it was different. Everyone was so carefree. He still didn’t want to go over the edge though, so he stuck to his normal amount of alcohol.
“You wouldn’t dare!”
Draco couldn’t take it anymore. The idea of getting *cozy* with Harry Potter was enough to make a blush creep up his neck.
Harry’s face lit with understanding and Draco rolled his eyes. He walked up to the hole and started running his wand along it, mummering complex incantations. He had always been proud of his ability to conduct certain spells, and now he was an Unspeakable so he had access to even more.
“The Cruciatus Curse of course.”
“Me neither. But that’s not the only reason.” She paused, “Harry I think I’m bisexual.”
“No. Mr. Malfoy is still unconscious. But he isn’t in as deep of a coma as before. There still might be some hope for him.” Healer Martian smiled at him and then walked away.
Harry ran into the 8th year common room and grabbed his school bag. He ran back out to Malfoy, and got an idea.
The four of them spent the next days repainting the entire Manor, Ivy occasionally joining them and bringing them lunch. One memorable time Harry was on a ladder and spilled an entire tin of peach paint on Draco’s head. He thought the proud Slytherin would get angry at him, but instead he had started laughing.
McGonagall swept out of the Great hall and the rest of the students stumbled behind her. “Now students,” Mcgonigal said as she climbed the stairs, “As I said before you will be assigned one other person to share your room with, remember these were chosen carefully and are /inflexible/. I have also put down your schedules. Have a look.”
“For Merlin's sake Potter! Granger doesn’t just make shit up. She usually has a reason behind it, and frankly, you *have* been a little off lately.”
He walked into his room and slumped down on his bed. What was he thinking? They were both pissed, but seriously? Did he really just kiss MALFOY? His thoughts were pounding into his head. What he really needed was a vile of Dreamless sleep. Unfortunately he had used up all of his stocks. So he was forced to fall asleep without his trusty potion.
“Yeah, well… somethings in life are actually quite enjoyable.” Draco’s eyebrows shot upward. What was he refusing to?
Harry stared at Draco lying in the bed before conjuring a chair. Not a big fluffy one like Dumbledore had used at his trial. His was simpler. But it still had a little padding. He sat down. There were so many things to say in such a little amount of time. And there was one thing in particular that he wanted to say before the Hospital closed. So he just said them all.
I shake my head, and grab my container of Brain Banisher.
Draco and Ron toppled to the ground. They both sat there stunned for a moment, then Harry started to laugh.
Ron’s eyes widened, and Hermione put a hand over her heart.
That smile made Harry smile. He leaned up slightly to place a small kiss on Draco’s lips.
“You lie!”
“I mean, I still can’t believe that you weren't put in Slytherin.”
Malfoy’s head whipped around. He looked alarmed until he saw who was standing there.
“What did I tell you? Complete nutter!”
Malfoy and I step out the back door. We walk over to the pumpkin patch and I see him wrinkle his nose at the giant slugs on the pumpkins.
“Oh,”
“Can you see how much paint we have in the root cellar please?”
Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “W-wow. That- that’s a really direct question.”
Draco shuddered and his head snapped up. He was sweating hard, and his hands were clutching the blankets. The dream had been so real…
“Who!?”
As Ron was talking a tawny owl flew in through the open window. Ron rushed over, and untied the scroll attached to it’s leg.
Harry watched Neville face scrunch in confusion. He almost laughed out loud at his expression.
Harry nodded and went on with his theory, “The park and the forest I’ve never been to but I can guess. I think Voldemort hid the Hufflepuff cup in the park before the Lastrange’s vault. And the forest must have been where he made the Diadem. So the culprit when there instead of to Hogwarts.”
“Oh. Well, umm, will you let go of me?”
Ripper trapping me on top of the fridge for hours until the Dursley's got home from lunch with Marge.
I step away, but I instantly miss Draco’s warmth. I pick up my Invisibility Cloak. And I look once more into those eyes. They truly are the most beautiful in existence. They are full of love, and fear, and… heartbreak.
Draco nodded, “She won’t even talk to me now. Not even when I brought her some food.”
He sounds like he actually cares. Ha.
The lights flared on overhead. Draco groaned; he was hoping to avoid this situation.
Harry’s eyes lit up, “Oh you’re on Malfoy!”
Draco rolled his eyes, “I’m always annoyed at you. But if there’s one thing I don’t like to do: it’s hold grudges. After the war there were so many people who wouldn’t let the past go. I really don’t want to be one of those people.”
Harry put his chin on Draco’s shoulder, “You can just buy them.”
He heaved himself up off the bed and opened the door. The light was blinding. “How’d what go?”
“Hey,” Harry cut in, “You did get me something.”
I turn the corner heading for Gryffindor tower. My head filled with Malfoy, his hair, his eyes, his snarkiness. His smile. Ugggh. It’s so frustrating! It was so easy when I could just ignore feelings, and hate him. But now it’s so much more complicated. Everything is so jumbled! And twisted! It’ll literally drive me insane!
“Because I care about you!”
He swung his legs over the bed and felt his feet hit the cold wood floor. He looked down and noticed that he was still wearing his clothes from the day before. He quickly transfigured them to be a little more suitable.
But, it did give Draco the perfect excuse to do little things that drove Harry insane. Like when he would reach around Harry for an ingredient and purposely breath on his neck. Or when they were waiting for their water to boil: he’d put a hand on Harry’s thigh and slowly inch it upward until Harry’s face was bright red and he was rushing off to the loo with a barely visible boner.
Draco nodded cheerily and got to his feet.
When he pushed open the Potions door everyone turned to look at him. Well almost everyone. Malfoy had his gaze firmly fixed to the chalkboard.
Wait no.
“Yes.”
“IF WE DIE FOR THEM I’LL KILL YOU HARRY!”
“A student died in there.” Malfoy muttered to himself.
Hermione nodded thoughtfully, “Yes. I see how that could go wrong. And of course the part where he’s going to be married in a week and a half. But-”
Harry pushed open the door and was immediately hit with the smell of Christmas: pine needles, baked goods and eggnog.
“You idiot!” Hisses a voice behind me. I turn and see Malfoy holding his wand aloft. “You just closed the door! Now we won’t be able to get out for hours unless someone comes to find us. And I doubt Severus will. Did you not listen to him! He said not to close the door…”
Blaise was next. “Draco, Truth or Dare.”
“Draco…”
“I had faith in you Harry.” She sighs, “I thought it would take at least three more weeks.”
Malfoy wrinkles his nose as if disgusted at the thought, “I guess there are two things that really set Gryffindors and Slytherins apart: Gryffindors are oblivious as fuck. And they have no idea how to flirt.”
“At least I made you a cup.” Harry said, holding out a mug of coffee and beaming. They both seemed to be pointedly ignoring the fact that they had slept in the same bed.
Harry noticed, “Just breath! We don’t know what wards have been broken.”
“No!” I huff, “I do not have a crush on Malfoy!”
‘No! I do not have a crush on him! And my friends don't think that either! They’re just confused.’
As Harry bent over the file to get the right coordinates, Draco just sat there gobsmacked.
His feet hit something with a clang. It was a weird noise and it didn't sound like dirt in the middle of nowhere.
“They did.”
Crack.
Despite that, Harry felt lighthearted, and cheery. And unusual feeling for him.
I don’t say anything.
He thought back to his conversation with Professor Sadder. ‘A cake and an apology letter confessing your true feelings usually works.’
“You're cute to me.”
“Who's?”
“Rictusempra!”
“Hey you two!” A shout came from behind them.
“Will he be okay?”
Once Harry was sitting on the top most branch he called down, “Hey Draco! Come up! It’s beautiful! Or, are you too scared?”
“Will you go on a date with me?”
Ron walked up behind Harry and put a hand on his shoulder. “Why don’t you send a patronus to mum and tell her that you're spending the night with Malfoy. I’m sure she’ll understand if you can’t make it to dinner. And Narcissa has already said her goodbyes. So you’ll be alone.”
“What!” Ron yelled, after he stopped coughing.
She walked away, leaving Draco to rush to the door labeled Mr. Harry Malfoy-Potter. He opened it with shaking hands to see his husband laying down in bed, reading a book. Draco took a deep breath, relieved that he was okay.
Hermione took out her wand, “Enough of this bullshit!” She waved it once and the bandages disappeared.
Neville nodded earnestly, “Of course! Your secret’s safe with me.”
“Hey Luna!” Harry said, “I haven't seen you in a while. How are you.”
From there he climbed the steep steps even higher. He paused as he passed a scorch mark on the wall. He lifted a hand up to it, and remembered all those years ago when he climbed all the way up here with a tiny dragon in a crate.
“I often talk out loud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful…  Have ever whispered to yourself Draco?”
“Mother? I’m back.”
Quinn gets a smug grin on their face. “Hey Granger!” They shout, “Pay up! I won.”
Harry finally met his eyes, his own green emeralds pleading, “I promise to tell you everything later. But I just really need you to help me.”
Ron scrunches his face, “Why would you come to me for help?”
“So you like me back?”
And always remember that your fandom is your family!
Draco nodded and got to his feet.
“I’ll be fine. You obviously need to get this off your chest. But start from the beginning, I want to know how to help you.”
Draco was suddenly hit with an urge to kiss him. It had never happened before. Well maybe it had. If he thought about it, during their school days Draco was always trying to find ways to impress Harry. His breath started to come in short gasps. He needed to find a place to think.
“The full moon!” Draco continued excitedly, “Those dates were all on the full moon!”
Harry and Hermione turned to see Ron running down the corridor toward them, obviously abandoning Neville to work on his own.
Lauren held out the posters, but Harry didn’t sign them. He was starting to get uncomfortable in this situation, this girl seemed like a big fan. And a big creep.
(I always imagined the Fat Lady's voice being really squeaky.)
“Wh-what?” Harry spluttered, “Of course not!”
Narcissa looked uneasy for a moment. “And what would these wards do?”
Draco looked up at her, surprised. “Mrs. Weasley. There was no need-”
“You wish!”
I turn away. I don’t want to think anymore. I don’t want to speak anymore. I don’t want to live anymore. I just want to get this over with. I just want all of the pain to go away.
Harry gazed at the letter. It wasn’t perfect, but he had gotten his message along. Maybe that would be enough. He attached the parchment to the school’s owl’s leg, and sent her off. Hopefully, he would be able to explain everything.
“They’re blonde too.” Ginny added, amused.
Harry had a panic attack when he saw it. He said something about Dumbledore’s right hand. Draco knew he was back on the astronomy tower. Watching Dumbledore fall.
Harry finally stops laughing long enough to say: “Does that mean your staying? ‘Cause we could work on the case. I have the files up stairs.”
“Well then you must have not met a lot of people. Say, are your friends Miss. Granger and Mr. Weasley homophobic.”
“Yeah. I’m good.” Harry said. “Now, how do we get to the Manor?”
Harry looked horrified at the thought. “No! I only did it when I broke into Gringotts… Anyway that was some hell of Occlumency! Who did you learn from?”
Draco narrowed his eyes. He could see what these two were getting at. “That, is none of your business, is it Granger?” He spat.
We’re so close. Close enough to that I could just lean in and… STOP! WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU THINKING!
“It’s a game called Never Have I Ever. I’ll explain how to play: So everyone has a Refilling spell set on their glasses. Someone will make a statement such as: Never have I ever been hit by a car. If that statement does not apply to you that you take a shot. If it does apply to you then you can leave your glass. A fair warning: The glasses have been spelled. So if you're lying about something your drink will turn orange. Are we all clear about the rules.”
Malfoy looked into his eyes and seemed to study his soul. “Why not.”
He laid the rocks out in a line on the desk and they managed to Vanish them all quite successfully. Without Vanishing the desk like last time.
“Do you have it?”
Harry went rigid. “I don’t want to talk about it.” He said stiffly.
They walked in the biggest room in the house and Harry stared around in awe. “This thing is huge!”
“Yeah, I know Potter. But there’s no way I’m staying at Hogwarts. With half the teachers gone there’ll be nonstop hexes sent my way.”
A small sniffle told him that he wasn’t the only one out there. Draco rounded the bend and spotted Harry hunched over by the pumpkin patch. He was still in his Weasley Jumper. And he was crying.
“Draco!”
Ron looked up from his pudding, “You good mate? You missed the carriage and then you missed dinner-” he looked down sadly at his plate that had just been whipped clean, “and now you’ve missed desert.”
Draco stiffened; he didn't want to talk about it now. “Well, cast a spell, let's see if I’m correct.”
The four of them walked into the store. Ginny and Luna wandered off to look at some of the muggle romance novels, Neville went up to the front desk, and Harry walked the isles, not looking for anything in particular.
I look skeptically at Quinn, who is looking completely sincere.
As he lay on his bed staring into the pillow, he wondered what was wrong with him. Why did he have to go and shove people away?
Draco’s eyes were staring to look wet, the tears magnifying all of the different colors swirling amounts the grey. I smile up at him, “Who knew you were such a poetic sap?”
“The first one.” Came Ginny’s reply, and Charlie snickered.
“C’mon! It won’t be your first Christmas without me!”
Draco looked away as Harry gave him puppy dog eyes, he sighed, “Fine. But only because you have an injury.”
An idea lit the gloom of Draco’s mind.
He wandered down the corridors of the train, peeking in compartments. Not going anywhere in particular. He saw Ginny, Luna and Neville in a compartment. He knew he should go and sit with them, but it just wasn’t the time.
“We still haven’t figured out a pattern. And we know that they are just random coordinates. It’s not being used at any magical place.” Harry plopped down on the couch beside Draco, a little too close for comfort.
“How’d you know it was me?”
“Yeah, she did. But I think she still might be a little uncomfortable with me bringing a boyfriend home. But it’s not her fault, she grew up on certain beliefs and she’s doing her best to change.”
They opened the files and began pouring over them. It turned out that the Department of Mysteries knew how to track when and where the Time-Turner was being used. None of that helped though. If they couldn’t find a pattern it would be useless. But it was all they had.
All the heads in the Great Hall turned to Headmistress McGonagall as she tapped on a glass with her spoon.
“O-Okay…” Harry said, starting to back away, “That’s cool, but I-”
Draco ignored the voice. He didn’t want to be desterbed.
Harry got up from the floor and stared at himself in the mirror. His breath started coming in short gasps, his palms were sweaty and he was lightheaded. He knew what was coming. But he didn’t really care at the moment.
“Okay. Harry! You're going first! Truth or Dare?”
“Master Draco has requested your presence in the dining room this morning.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Show off.”
I sigh and shake my head as they run the rest of the way to lunch. When I finally reach the doors of the Great Hall I see Pansy giving Quinn several Knuts. She looks at me as I sit down, disappointed.
Draco looked up at the twisting blue creature in anger, “It’s a ferret! Why must Merlin thrust this curse upon me?” (If he was being honest he loved his patronus instantly.)
“Hey Ginny.”
He hasn’t called Hermione a mud-blood for weeks, and hasn’t made a slur about poor people in forever.’
“Thank you for your concern, Granger. But contrary to former beliefs, I am perfectly fine.” Draco said.
Hagrid’s was the most interesting: it was a small, green, scaly snake. And it was alive. Which was surprising. It slithered out of the small box, and stopped in front of him.
Draco sniffed, “I have no idea what you two are talking about. Nothing happened.” Despite his pompous attitude Draco was quite afraid of lying. He had been since…
Draco opened his mouth to ask how she knew about the case but he was cut off.
Draco’s breath hitched. It was the first time Harry had said it. Actually, said it. Of course they would sometimes say it in a joking way. But somehow this time felt more real. He didn’t know what to do. But his brain naturally supplied an answer.
“Tell us what happened.” Hermione urged, exchanging a knowing look with Ron.
“Bad at flattery? I’ve charmed plenty of people before.”
Draco got up and followed him, grabbing his dress robes then heading to the bathroom to change. He liked to have privacy when he changed because of certain things on his arm and chest that made him uncomfortable. Harry had been completely understanding and accepting. He had been in tears upon seeing the scars on Draco’s chest, and promised to make it up to him for the rest of his life. Needless to say, it was an emotional night for both of them.
As Draco handed him the folder, their fingers brushed, and he felt a shock of… *something* go through his veins.
“Good. How are you?” Hermione asked. The family walked to the chair and Rose sat down in it. (Hermione conjured extra chairs for her and Ron.)
The room got tense and awkward and Draco didn’t even know why. So he just turned around and walked into the room next door. He sat down awkwardly on the couch, and waited for Harry to get back.
Draco let out a dramatic sigh, “Unfortunately for me, I do have to wait to slam you into a mattress.”
Ron chokes on his pumpkin juice.
“Hmm?”
“Don’t say anything Potter. We can both agree that I made some pretty shitty choices. I may have been under the influence of Voldemort, but I am my own person.”
The sound of Molly’s motherly voice pulled Draco back to the present.
He turned. Luna Lovegood was walking through the forest barefoot with her odd blue and pink shamrock shaped trunk.
“Now we have at least three Gryffindors going after the Slytherins.” Quinn says, from across the table.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck, he had planned this moment the day before, but now he had no idea what he was doing. “So you got my note?”
The unthinkable happened. The whole room was filled with a glowing silver light. Draco snapped his eyes open. In front of him was a corporeal patronus. Not just a silvery wisp.
Suddenly feeling very courageous, he leaned down to whisper into Harry’s ear. “You’d better not tell Granger.” He growled. “Or I might have to punish you.”
“You’ll have fun without me.” Harry assured them.
Other than his birthday three years ago, Draco hadn’t seen his father at all. And now he was holding a wedding invitation for ‘Lucius Malfoy and Kohianna Welt’s wedding.’ He really did not want to go.
“U-Umm it’s okay if you say no but I figured that since we’re working on this case and all… ”
They lay there until dawn, not speaking, not moving. Just simply enjoying each other's company. They watched the sunrise together. That sunrise marked the beginning of something new and exciting.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “Yes?”
After the trial had ended, Potter had come up to him and thanked Draco for saving his life. Actually, thanked him. Potter and his hero complex. It was actually quite annoying.
Maybe it was time to face the facts. Maybe he did have a crush on Draco.
He brushed it off as another one of Hermione’s not-so-smart assumptions and climbed into bed.
Their noise seemed to attract Mrs. Weasley who came bustling in, “Oh! Harry dear, it’s good to see you! You too Draco, now let's all move to the kitchen. Breakfast is almost really then you all can open presents.”
“Do you think you could do those fancy spells you did back there?” He shouted over the howling wind.
“If the person wearing it is the rightful owner, then the Time-Turner will do what the person wants, but if they aren't it won't. We know the culprit is using the Time-Turner, but they aren't the rightful owner. For all we know they might be torturing it to do what they want. I don’t know if the spell put on it also affects the person wearing it. We’ll have to find that out.”
He was in the seventh floor corridor! He could get into the 8th year common room! But wait, the owls were gaining on him! He would have no time to say the password!
All in all Draco really enjoyed himself. But whenever he would reach across the table, or stretch a little too far, his back would twinge painfully. The doctors had done their best to dispel all traces of the curse, but there would always be a tiny black star-shaped scar at the top of Draco’s spine. It wasn’t visible when he wore a shirt or robes, but it would always leave a mark.
Harry flinched at Ron’s sharp tones, “Draco…”
Harry walked up to the hole and stood beside him. Neither of them spoke, and Harry felt himself drift off into his own thoughts as he took in the sunrise.
“Ron, I’m so sorry I said all of those things, I wasn't in my right mind. I know it’s not a worthy explanation, but it’s all I have. I’m so, so sorry. You’ve been there for me through thick and thin, and I threw all that away!
Hermione rolled her eyes and muttered something like: “Honestly Ronald, you daft bimbo! Those are Hogwarts teams!” But it was the look in her eye told that Ron and her were obviously going to get married.
“Well first of all, I wanted to apologize for ignoring your letters all summer.”
After several bottles of Butterbeer and countless shots the Golden Trio was quite tipsy. Draco was a lot better at knowing when he was drunk, and decided that tonight was not the night.
And Harry, being Harry, decided to be reckless and climb the damn thing.
Harry stared at Hermione in shock.
Charlie smiled nastily, “Hey I think he’s also a Malfoy. A Death Eater!”
Draco looked at him skeptically, “Alright.”
And it’s form was a ferret. Of course.
“So I tied him up with gaffer tape, and I locked him in a shed. Then I went out to the garden and I fucked my best friend.”
“I know Ron! But he doesn’t need to treat us like shit. He’s been acting this way since the battle.”
“A few weeks ago! You made me suffer that long!”
Draco thought for a moment, “Now we just have to figure out where the culprit is going to go next. ‘Cause we know that they’re trying to use the Horcrux’s magic to make the Time-Turner stronger. I don’t think they would use it in Godric’s Hollow, where you were made one, or Hogwarts. And I doubt they know where you stayed as a child. So we can rule out those possibilities.”
“I think we broke up.” He said glumly.
Hermione was the first one to spot them, “Harry!” She said, jumping up and hugging him.
He heard Ron sigh, “Well at least come down and join the game.”
“Did he apologize for attacking you?” Hermione asked.
Draco was baffled, “Well most of the time, I think about how your stupid hair gives me a migraine every morning.”
As they were heading back down the corridor, Luna came up to them.
“How?”
“The ride conductors had to climb around and get all of the people off. We were the last ones. The whole time Dudley was complaining about being hungry. It was terrible. But not as bad as being so scared that you shit yourself.
“That I am.” Draco huffed, the wind knocked out of him.
“And can’t you just conjure furniture.”
Hermione was the first to speak, “Why didn’t you tell us Harry?”
Malfoy sat up and turned to Harry for the first time, “What do you want?”
Lavender rolled her eyes. “This is my way of coming out. You can clap for me now!”
“That was actually a really good idea.”
‘I’ll believe it when I see it.’
With a swish Snape leaves the room, and I resist the urge to set off a glitter bomb at the excessiveness. Then I realize that I'm alone in a room with Draco Malfoy. And suddenly that task he was assigned seems more intimidating.
“Yes. Granger came up to me in Arithmancy. She said something about your 'mental health’. And me being the only one who can ‘bring you back.’ A load of bullshit in my opinion. I just wanted to know what you did to make her believe that you needed *me*, of all people.”
Ron raised his eyebrows, and Hermione looked at him coolly.
The voice is right. As I turn back to the table, Everyone is looking at me with a knowing smirk, even Nevil.
I'm not giving' up, giving up,
Draco smirked and stood up, “Where is your Gryffindor pride now?”
“There isn’t.”
Kretcher nodded, his head bobbing up and down. “I am quite honored to make Master Draco breakfast. He is an honorable Black after all.” Then he went over to the cabinets and started to take out plates and cups.
Draco sighed what felt like his hundredth today. Mr. Border was Head of the Department of Mysteries, and going to his office could only mean one thing: trouble.
“Well, I’m not going.” Harry pouted.
Percy had given him: A Book of the Most Useful Auror Defence Spells to Use on Missions. (Harry planned to chuck that in the fire as soon as he got a chance.) Hermione’s gift was a muggle one. It was a package with glasses, a fake stick-on scar, and a replica of Harry’s wand.
When he walked into the room, he realized it was the same one where Hermione had been tortured. He froze, the images flooding his head.
“Harry no! Why would you do that?” Hermione whispered.
Harry suddenly realized that he had forgotten to get Draco a present. So when he sat back down Harry announced, “I did not forget to get my boyfriend a present. I just… well never mind, here it is.”
Ron clapped Draco on the back and said, “Well, I’m off to the Burrow. Hermione and I plan to stay there this weekend. Winter is doing amazing.” With that Ron Apperated away.
The game picked up after that, people finally getting used to the absurd dares. Pansy dared Ron to shave his eyebrows off. (“Not again!”) and Neville confessed that he never really felt like a true Gryffindor until he pulled that sword out of the Hat.
Fuck Malfoy and his rainbow hair.
Draco propped himself up on his elbow, “You didn't even nail the she-weasle?”
“You pay for that.” He said. He grabbed a handful of cake and hurled it back at her.
“How’d you get that!” Neville shouted.
Harry rolled his eyes, and flopped down on the couch beside him. “Well now you're not. Cause I’m here and I want to talk to you.”
“Oh sorry! Again.” She let go of his arm and blushed.
“C’mon. I stalked you all of 6th year. I know when you get mad.”
Draco looked at him for a long time. “Fine.”
“Yeah, mate.” Ron said with a frown, “You didn't tell me where you were going.”
Luna seemed to regain some of her lightheartedness as she said, “It looks like you might have a couple of wrackspurts in your ears, Harry.”
“Ron said that you were obviously gay.”
Draco grabbed Harry’s chin and forced their mouths together. Harry's whole world shattered. He just melted into Draco’s arms. His mouth felt like a pillow, soft and warm. And Harry’s heart felt like it was about to explode right out of his chest when Draco slid his tongue in his mouth. When they finally pulled away Harry was out of breath. He was just staring at Draco completely star struck.
He started to walk away, but Harry grabbed his arm. The blonde raised a questioning eyebrow.
What was he going to do about Harry?
This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good.
They worked in silence most of the time, occasionally asking a question. It wasn’t until Harry caught Malfoy staring at him did they have a real conversation.
“/Wow!/” Harry said, adding his whole supply of sarcasm to his voice, “/I’m so impressed! Einstein could never!/”
Draco turned back to Harry and threw him a halfhearted glare, “I don’t know what gave you that idea Potter, but I assure you, your hair is as atrocious as the day we met. And is it necessary to be making sexual references at this time of day?”
Harry and Draco walked out of Tomes and Scrolls and down the cobblestone street.
“Whatever, /Potter/.”
I pull the Invisibility Cloak out of my bag and slip it over my shoulders. It’s hard avoiding the crowded hallways and keeping up with Malfoy. Although I don’t think I would lose sight of him, he has gleaming blonde hair that I could see a mile off. I wonder what it would feel like to run my fingers through it.
Harry gave him a timid smile, “It’s alright, we’ll survive. ‘Cause parents aren't always right.”
“Harry? Harry! You're doing it again!”
Hermione’s voice broke the silence, “How long have you known?” She asked, turning her head to face Harry.
Harry stepped into the kitchen, “Kreacher?” He called, “Is it ready?”
Harry shrugged, “That’s why I’m here.”
“Why though? You’re a fucking faggot and deserve to rot in hell. Why would you need to study anyway?” The first one said, “What do we do to faggots Charlie?”
“What!?”
Harry mentally kicked himself. He was trying to prove that he could be a good friend! Why did he have to go and fuck it up?
The thing I would like to say is that, a lot of people Have no idea what fan-fiction is. And even if they do, some people frown upon it seeing fan-fiction writers as unoriginal and uninspired. And i want you all to know that, those presumptions are completely untrue.
Harry shifted and let out a slight whimper in his sleep. Draco had the urge to squeeze all of the unhappiness out of this perfect person. Instead he chose to plant a soft kiss to his neck, hoping that was enough to keep away the demons.
Harry sighed, “Look Malfoy, I know we formally started over, but can we really start over? Forget the past and all that. Move on?”
“They don’t know. The Healers were able to get most of it out, but there’s some still in there. Depending on what it is I might have to quit my job as Head Auror.”
Hermione cleared her throat, “As I was saying before I was rudely interrupted: We are playing Truth or Dare, but with a twist. A wizard twist. In my pocket I have a large vile of Veritaserum.”
Quinn really made a bang, so I invited them to join the D.A. They agreed. Eventually they started dating Pansy Parkinson. Most of the D.A. Wanted to kick the redhead out, but Quinn stood their ground and said, “Why are we discriminating against Slytherins? I know several decent people from that house! Some of them would love to join!”
I turn a corner and feel Malfoy's fingers close around my wrist.
Draco stopped mid sentence. “He said what?”
“Glad you asked. You have heard about the missing Time-Turners right?”
Then Draco’s thoughts got more depressing:
Harry put a comforting hand on his shoulder, “I know how you must feel. But they forgave you long ago. When I told them that you’d changed. And anyone who I think is okay, they’ll be okay with. The only person who might be a little icy toward you is George, but that’s understandable right?”
“Oh, yeah!” Hagrid says behind me, “Malfoy’s jus’ been apologizin’ for all the things he’s done.”
Harry sighed again, “I did. And she said that I should really be doing more of my own homework if I want to be an Auror.”
Draco immediately felt self conscious. All of the red-heads were looking at him. Hermione was the first to move.
*Flashback*
Harry gulped, “So you heard, everything?”
I hate him.
Malfoy looked skeptical but followed him anyway.
Lauren whipped around, and came face to face with Draco Malfoy. She glared defiantly at him, “And who are you?”
Draco sat down on the couch and sighed. So much for putting feelings aside. Harry was a mess, unfortunately for Draco, he was a lovable mess.
Crack.
Everyone got their drinks and Draco made his way over to Arthur. He cleared his throat wondering where to begin. Before he could speak Arthur put a hand on his shoulder.
“So, how’d it go?” Ron asked after a moment.
Hermione looked positively giddy, “Come on Harry! Don’t tell me you're just realizing that you have a crush on him now?”
Kreacher nodded and returned to making his soup.
“... No?”
He slaps me on the arm.
Everyone was finally happy. The Weasleys were happy. Draco was happy. /He/ was happy.
Harry had a giant knot of happiness in his stomach. He felt like he could fly. “When did they discharge you?” He asked, hugging his boyfriend tight.
“I was just lying there on my bed with nothing to occupy my brain. So my brain started to occupy itself. I started thinking of terrible things. Like the war,”
“Well, you're still cute.”
“It would be an honor.” Draco said.
Draco just sighed and stood up. He looked down at his robes. They were the ones he had been wearing at the bar.
He slowly dragged it in a line down his arm, and let out a sigh of relief. Desperate to feel something other than the slow, crushing pain in his chest.
Okay, I just /had/ to add Luna into this one. Only because I think she has a lot more knowledge and wisdom than everyone thinks.
“I don't know!” Harry said, obviously frustrated. (Draco had to stop himself from laughing.)
“That’s not-”
Ginny’s face reddened, “Well, maybe…”
I stop breathing. I stop shaking. I stop sweating. I look up at Malfoy and my eyes focus. “Scaring you?” My voice is nothing more than a whisper.
Harry smiled. Of course. The Weasleys knew him better than anyone.
“Then I was given this case with you. And that made things a whole lot more awkward. I was eventually going to give you a sincere apology, but being a Malfoy and all we aren't really good at saying ‘sorry’. So I just didn’t apologize at all.”
“Yeah, Malfoy.”
“F-Father…” he stammered.
Harry hesitated, he couldn’t keep shunning them. “Ginny asked me to meet her by the lake.” He said hurriedly.
Harry shook his head.
“Ha!” He yelled, flying towards the ground. Harry landed and stuck out his tongue at Draco. “Who’s a toddler now?”
“Uh, no. They had homework.”
Harry and Hermione looked at Ron and snickered, remembering the incident in their 4th year.
Harry was suddenly suspicious. This could be a trick. The Daily Prophet might be trying to weasel information out of him.
So you can imagine how surprised he was when Ron accidentally burned a loaf of bread, and didn’t have to eat it. It was in between Harry’s first and second year that Harry learned how a loving family behaved.
Draco had had enough. He didn’t need Harry’s help. And he also had nothing to be happy about.
Harry nodded, “Where would she be at this hour?”
“Mr. Malfoy. That is no way to talk to a teacher!”
I take deep calming breaths to try and ease the unwelcome knot in my stomach. I feel an all too familiar feeling when I realize that the walls are far too close for my likening.
“Yeah…”
Draco whipped around and promptly toppled on top of Harry, who had come with to deliver the news. Draco’s mother was standing right behind him. Her hands were on her hips and she had on a dirt stained dress. She had obviously just been in the greenhouse.
Harry opened his mouth, probably to argue, but Draco held a finger up to stop him.
He sat up, and slid out of bed. He walked over to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. His arms were covered with bandages and well as his chest. He might as well have been a mummy.
Then he was gone, leaving the owls to swoop in the open door.
Dear Hermione,
Hermione pulled away and said, “C’mon let's go back in.”
I feel a cool hand on my cheek, it gently lifts my head until I’m looking into two grey storm clouds. Draco’s eyes are beautiful. He gives me a warm smile, “But I also know that you are a fighter. I know that you can’t let this setback kill your hope. I know the loss of your godfather was like losing your parents all over again. But you can't give up in that little light inside of you. I know that you can’t see yourself the way I see you, but I just want you to know that I would be lost without your little light.”
“Mate?” Dean asks as Ron walks over and shakes me.
“Dudley was rocking the platform so hard that I think I stopped the ride. It just shut down. And Dudley wasn't able to rock it anymore. I think that was the first time I ever used magic and didn't know about it.
“Wh-what?!” Harry spluttered. “‘Sexual tension’? That’s not what was going on!”
This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good.
“Okay, I can do that, but will I be working alone?”
The door banged open, “Potter, you can’t stay here sulking all day. Granger set up another ice-breaker game, and surprisingly Pansy helped her.”
“This calls for a celebration!” Ron declared. He sat down at Harry’s desk and began to write back to Granger.
He watched as Harry nodded, and grabbed the Time-Turner off of Draco. He gave the nob the slightest twitch and disappeared.
“Oh Harry.” Draco whispered and took his husband's hand, “I’m so sorry.”
“O-okay.”
“Oh, I’m doing all right. I actually wanted to talk to you in private.”
Harry looked at her confused, “What? No. What do you mean ‘going on in school’?”
“So you’re admitting it?” Ron asked.
Harry sighed, “Well if they ever do that again just come find me.” Harry picked up the girls patch from the ground where the first one had dropped it. He whispered a spell and the patch magically reattached to her bag.
When the two of them got home Draco headed to the bathroom to change out of his dress robes. He also got a small gold box out of a cabinet. Just as he was putting his shirt back on he heard Harry exclaim, “Hermione too?!”
“Harry! Harry! Over here!”
*“IF WE DIE FOR THEM I’LL KILL YOU HARRY!”
Draco huffed, but this was where it got dark. “I brushed my teeth with bleach cause I didn’t have time for cavities.”
Draco smirked, then leaned down and pulled Harry into a rough kiss. As their lips met, lights exploded behind Draco’s closed eyes and there was a ball of heat in his stomach threatening to explode. He grabbed the glasses of Harry’s face and threw them on the bedside table.
Harry grinned broadly, “There’s another thing…” He took out his wand and Draco eyed it. But when he had a closer look at it, he realized that it wasn’t Harry's wand. It was his old one!
He was no better than an assassin. That night on the tower, Dumbledore was mistaken. Draco was useless.
Harry looked up surprised, “No you didn’t.”
“I bet it was Potter again wasn't it?”
Of course Hermione was worried about my ‘emotional wellbeing’ but why in bloody hell does she think I need Malfoy? “I don’t know…” I say slowly. “Hermione is always a mystery.”
“M-Me and Potter? Are you mental?”
Draco raised an amused eyebrow, “‘Hmm, how do I put this?’” He was quoting what Harry had said to him about Ginny, “‘She has the wrong parts.’”
Draco didn’t even bother to struggle as Voldemort entered his mind once more. Flashes of memories flew by.
Draco was starting to get scared now; Harry still wasn’t moving as if he were under the Body-Bind curse. So Draco took it upon himself to Apperate them to the next coordinate. He looked down at the file, and turned on the spot disappearing into dizzying darkness.
When they got back to their compartment Ron turned on him. “What were you doing with /Malfoy/?”
“If I didn’t know better Draco, I'd say that you actually have a hair fettish.”
Ron was still standing there, his cheeks red.
Draco's eyes widened, and he said, a little more urgently this time, “Tick tock, stop the clock. Because I got the feeling that I’m gonna get shot.”
“Oh.”
“I’m not mad.”
All of the boxes shrunk to fit through the doors and floated down the hallway.
Nevil snaps his fingers in front of my face and I jump. Falling off of the armchair, barely missing the fire.
I glare at Hagrid and start to tell him ‘no.’ But he flashes me a look.
Hermione clapped her hands excitedly, which was quite unlike her.
He saw Draco’s whole body tense up, and thought he might have gone too far. But Draco relaxed and looked down at his drink.
Harry finally entered the room. But he wasn’t alone. Ron was with him.
“Blaise Zambini.”
Harry glared up at him defiantly, “Nope. You're cute.”
“Honestly Harry! I’m beginning to think you have a crush on him.”
Draco flicked his wand and murmured a couple of complex Unspeakable spells. “The root cellar.” He whispered, “They know. But my mother is safe in her room.”
“They were.”
“Yeah?”
Something about the way Lucius insulted Harry lit something in Draco’s heart. “No.” He said firmly, “Father, he’s a good partner. *He* wasn’t sent to Azkaban. And I dare say that we’ve become good friends.”
Draco scowled, “At least I’m not up at the crack of dawn, fiddling with muggle shit and waking everyone else.”
“Why do you care about me!?”
Harry was startled into looking up. He saw Ron and Hermione gazing at him through shocked eyes.
That earns me a light smack on the arm, “Trust you to have the dirtiest mind.” Draco says, half laughing.
“Well, it’s just. She thinks that I have a crush on you and-”
This time Draco had to bite his tongue to stop from chucking. “I don’t know. But I do have a good way to end the night.”
“So,” Quinn says, “Are you finally going to admit it?”
“Harry. Why are you defending him so much?”
Neville glanced around the crowded common room, “Not here though.”
Draco never expected the Great Harry Potter to extend a hand of friendship in his direction. But here he was.
As everyone else laughed at the pin, Harry gazed around. He had a warm fuzzy feeling in his chest. Narcissa was out of bed. The Weasleys were still grieving for Fred, but they held their heads high and looked forward.
“Harry! Look!” Ron’s yelling pulled Harry from his thoughts. He was holding up a long thin package, which could only be one thing.
“Look!” I say, “I might have followed Malfoy for a little bit. But I wasn’t stalking him.”
Malfoy quirks his lips, “Oh please Potter. For my sake and yours, don’t even try flattery.”
This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good.
Blaise gave him a weird look, “He hasn’t talked to us since the game two night ago.”
Harry rolled his eyes at the last sentence, he had told Hermione countless times that-
“Okay?”
Harry scowled, as Draco walked out of the bedroom and into the kitchen.
“Incarcerous!” Draco bellowed. It hit his father right in the chest and thick ropes immediately started wrapping themselves around him.
By the time we were done it was almost dusk. We were covered in sweat and slime and mud. But the work is exhilarating, and it helps me take my mind off certain things.
Draco held out his arm, Harry took it, and then they were whirling through time and space. The wormhole of the Wizarding World.
“Well, I don’t think it’s any surprise, but he used the Cruciatus Curse on me and my family.” Draco was desperately trying to keep his tone light and avoid tears. “After what happened with you at the Manor, he was furious. I would have bled to death in the dungeons if it weren't for my mother. I owe her. That’s why I'm still staying, even after all these years.”
He suddenly stopped talking with a gasp, for Draco had gotten down on one knee. He removed one of his gloves and touched the snitch with his bare hand. It opened up with a click to reveal a small ring.
I roll my eyes, Quinn has a knack for exaggerating the truth.
Draco nodded, wondering where he was going with this.
“Don't listen to them.” Harry blurted before he could stop himself. “They don’t know how bad outing someone can be. They’ve never experienced how scary coming out is. They don’t know what it’s like to be shunned for who you love, or your gender identity. So don’t listen to them. You’re amazing just the way you are, and no one should ever tell you otherwise! And if they do, well fuck them!”
Draco truly is the one person who keeps me grounded. He’s like a rock, always present in my life. Always there with a snide remark, or a teasing look. I know that one day everything might change. But I really don’t want to think about that. I just want to be free to live in the moment.
Harry’s shoulders drooped, “I don’t really know what it’s about. But I mean, I want to fix our friendship, even if we’re no longer dating.”
I see the statue of the one-eyed, humpback witch and get an idea.
Okay, i just want to say something.
“Oh yeah. She was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin.”
“How do you think wizards cover their tracks?”
“Wow! Was that the giant squid?”
“W-what!” Harry spluttered.
Harry trudged down the stairs to the dungeon. The strap of his bag digging into his shoulder and making his cuts feel like fire.
“Harry.”
“What are you doing?” Harry’s voice felt like daggers to Draco’s ears.
Harry had indeed heard the Healer when he went to the Hospital the day before:
“I mean, I’ve been nothing but a dick (excuse my vulgar language) to you for your entire life. Let alone what happened during the war, and here you show up and are being all nice to me. It’s just confusing.”
Draco sighed, sounding defeated, “Yes I’m sure. I’ll go back to the Manor, besides, I need to help my mother get out of bed.”
“Going somewhere?”
I'll wait for you.”
“Letters?”
Draco smirked, “Everything.”
“You would have looked good in green.” Malfoy comments.
“Merlin! Get fucking dressed and I’ll bring food. But just get out of bed and start on your fucking homework. Vous êtes si dramatique tout le temps! Lui donner un repos!”
Draco jumped in surprise, dropping the moose. “Potter! Can’t you see I’m busy?” He huffed.
I get to work spraying the Slugs and bringing them to the edge of the Forest. At most I can carry three, I tried to lift four once, but ended up with a mouth full of mud.
But before I can walk away, Draco grabs my wrist. I turn to face him.  There’s a smirk playing on his lips under all of the tears.
“Ron an’ Hermione not with you?”
Draco nodded, too tired to say anything. He just flopped back down on the couch and closed his eyes. Luckily he was tired enough to have dreamless slumber.
*”Mr. Potter. Please! Listen, the curse that hit Mr. Malfoy was a strong one. It seems to be spreading from his back. The potions we’re using can only delay the process.”
Ron, Harry and Draco all hurried into the pub. Inside sat all of the Weasleys (minus Bill of course.) It was a weekday so they basically had the place to themselves.
“Draco?”
Hermione gave him a small smile, and a peck on the lips.
The portrait swung open, and Harry stepped inside. He heard a chorus of, “Look it’s Harry Potter!” But he ignored them. He was here to see one person, and that person only.
“Harry?” One asked, “Are you in here?”
Harry’s magic abruptly cut off as a single tear fell down Draco’s face. He looked stricken, “Draco, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make you cry!”
Ron rolled his eyes, “Do you remember what you were like in First Year Seamus?” He pulled out his wand. “Look at me! I'm going to turn my water into rum! Weeeeee.”
As Harry walked back to the 8th year common room he debated on whether he was ready to apologize to Ron and Hermione. On one hand he wanted to mend the friendship as soon as possible. But on the other hand he wasn’t sure the friendship /was/ mendable.
“Ginny no! That's not what I-”
“But I thought that was done by a bomb. There was a bombing around here fifty years ago.”
Draco looked down at his left arm. The Dark Mark was still there, clear as day.
Why had Hermione come out to help him?
Draco stood up and moved to sit at the end of Harry’s hospital bed.
“Do you want to know why I hate amusement parks?”
“Ron, I know that your family and the Malfoy family have had disputes, but why can't we put that behind us? What if this case is an excuse to get to know him?”
Draco was so absorbed in watching the sky that he didn’t realize that Harry was watching *him*. When he did turn to look he jumped, “What?”
“I get what you mean.” Harry mumbled, “I hid in my room after the war for months. I didn’t come out, I didn’t talk to anyone, the only living thing I saw was Kreacher. I just couldn’t forgive myself, all those innocent people had to die because I wasn’t fast enough.
His friends tied up next to him.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow, “Why?”
Draco took a deep breath and shook himself, “Your right. I can’t let my personal fears get in the way of my job. I have to forget that she’s my mother and instead think of her as another person.”
“Go back in time 7 minuets!”
“Congratulations!” I say as he sits down and stuffs a roll into his mouth.
McGonagall waved her wand and sheets of paper appeared in everyone's hands.
Harry sighed, “She’s worse isn’t she?”
Draco looks into my eyes, “And the someone that convinced me? That someone is you.”
Enough to make a person cry themselves to sleep.
Malfoy snapped his head up at the mention of his first name. But Harry rambled on.
Harry bit his lip, “But how can yo-” He stopped and his voice lowered, “Oh.”
“Honestly. I think these things might be getting better. Seems old Xenophilius came to his senses after the war.”
“I never did tell you why I could feel Voldemort’s signature, did I?”
“I don’t give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy. He’s vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic.”
“You have gained the respect of many of our highest colleagues.”
“Ahh, owls do that sometimes.”
Harry blinked. “Wow Neville. Thanks for telling me.”
Harry smiled, remembering that fateful day at the zoo. ‘I once sent another snake to Brazil.’
“Why?” Hermione asked.
“Fine, don’t.”
They returned to eating and Harry wondered why Draco looked so disappointed. Didn’t he want Harry there?
TW: None for this chapter.
The den was so big it took all day to paint one coat. “We’ll have to do the second coat tomorrow.” Draco said, yawning. “Thanks, you two for helping us.”
Harry then pulled out a collapsible wizard chess set from inside his robes. “Do you wanna play?” He asked hesitantly, adjusting his glasses.
“Why did you automatically assume I was transphobic?”
Harry waited for her to elaborate, but she didn’t. So they continued to walk in a comfortable silence. (Luna occasionally would point out a specific type of bird.)
Ginny smacks me lightly on the arm and says, “You're one to talk, how long have you been stalking Malfoy?”
‘And he didn't bring up your panic attack at all.’
Harry looked down at his feet, deciding to just tell them what was on his mind. That was the only way to really explain what was going on.
Harry turned, Malfoy was standing behind him. Great.
Draco’s eyes widened. Everyone knew the story about Voldemort's Horcruxes, it was common knowledge. But no one but Harry’s closest friend knew all of the details.
The Malfoy family still had their House Elves, but the Elves had a lot more freedom and were treated a lot better since Lucius left. Draco used to like Dobby because he was one of Draco’s only friends, but then he had been set free and Draco had never seen him again. Until the Snatchers caught the Golden Trio, but Bellatrix had killed him. So Draco’s only childhood friend was dead.
“But do you want me to go?”
His face was dirty, his clothes were ripped and his hair was very, very, long. But big clumps were missing as if someone had ripped them out. But the thing was, all of the other people Draco had seen coming out of Azkaban all looked tired. His father on the other hand had no dark circles under his eyes, he wasn’t gaunt. He was thin but not in a starved way. All in all he looked like he had been out of the wizard prison for a while.
Harry shook his head, “I- never mind. I don’t know why I expected you to get it. Nobody ever does.”
He had baked cake after cake for Dudley when he was only five years old. Petunia had very high standards as well, so if a cake wasn’t perfect, she would lock him in his cupboard for days without food. And when he was finally let out his only meals were the burnt cake from the bin. That was the only thing he had to eat for the next five days usually. He burned things more times than not in his early years, and the punishment was cruel and inhumane. But Harry didn’t know anything else, it was normal to him.
“Your a-”
I step down the stone steps to the dungeon. I have detention with Snape again. Why he gave it to me this time, I don't know. But I'm sure it was a very stupid reason.
Harry chewed his lip, something had been bothering him lately. It was that morning a few days ago with the owls.
Harry snorted and soon the three of them were trashing the entire kitchen with globs of bi cake. The elves were cowering behind stoves and cabinets to avoid the flying clumps.
“Don’t call her that!” I snarl automatically, “Wait, Hermione asked *you* to talk to *me*?!”
“Alright now repeat after me… Expecto Patronum.”
“It’s okay. You don’t have to tell me.” Harry said, pressing a kiss to Draco’s chapped lips.
“Again with the posh talk, mate!” Ron huffed.
“We all make mistakes. Yes yours were pretty big, and they affected a lot of people, but they were mistakes nonetheless. A very wise man once told me: ‘It’s not our mistakes that matter, Harry, it’s how we fix them.’”
“Are you sure about that?”
“Draco, you seem to think about this boy a lot. So much that you should be there when I kill him! But for now you will stay here and suffer while I punish you.”
Harry’s face was stony when he suggested, “Why don’t we look around for any source of magic. This place looks like it hasn't been in operation for years.”
“Whatever.”
“Whoa, whoa whoa! Break it up! Break it up! There’s a small child here!”
“Yeah.”
“Hey!” He shouted, with a sudden burst of fury and confidence. “Leave her alone!”
On one hand he didn’t want to stay at Grimmauld Place any longer than he had to. It brought back too many bad memories. He was only staying there because Ron and Hermione were, and he had nowhere else to go. They had been there since the end of the war, and quite frankly he was getting sick of it.
“No but-”
I pause, listening. “Filch’s muttering. My breathing and y-your breathing.”
“I would appreciate it if you would please move, you're blocking the hallway and I need to study.”
Draco burst out laughing. Harry’s face was red and his shirt was soaking.
Kreacher shook his head, “Master has never asked for a cake before.” he mumbled, “What kind of cake does Master require?”
I regain my balance and smile, “Great.”
“When we did finally get down, my aunt and uncle fussed so much over Dudley. They even bought him a really expensive dinner. They didn't care about me though. In fact, they blamed me and I didn't get a proper meal for weeks.”
“Master Harry has summoned Kretcher to the most Noble and Ancient House of Black. What service would Master require?” His voice was scratchy.
“Yes?”
No matter what this world throws,
Harry seemed to notice his tense posture, and put a hand on his leg. “It’s going to be okay. I promise.”
“What are we?” Seamus said scornfully, “A bunch of First Years? Playing Truth or Dare in a circle on the rug?”
Draco never got a chance to ask what exactly was so enjoyable because Harry was already whipping out the case file.
He instantly knew that that was the wrong thing to say, for Ginny’s eyes were now blazing.
“I’ll think about it.” Was Harry’s only response before shutting the door in her face.
Harry’s eyes narrowed as Lucius put his hands in the air, surrendering.
It’s a person.
“Now I want all of you to find and partner and practice Vanishing. If you need help, help each other. This is why I like partnering up. Off you go.”
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy!” Said a falsely cheery voice, “Just the man I wanted to see!”
Neville cast a 'Tempus’. “Right now, actually.”
Ginny nodded, “Yeah, I kind of realized it a couple of weeks ago in potions. Do you have a crush?”
“Harry Potter.”
Draco looked around, he had never been to this part of the wizarding town and was rather intrigued by the small building in front of him. It seemed like a cozy spot to spend a date, a rosy glow was lighting the windows in the semi-dark night.
“C’mon! You don’t mean that!”
I'm not goin' down that easily,
“Hermione, Ron and I are going to a pub in Diagon. I was wondering if you would want to come.”
Harry rolled his eyes, “Whatever. I don’t normally play the ‘Saviour of the World’ card, but it seemed like the only option.”
I'm not giving' up, givin' up,
Quinn smiles, “Thank you for noticing my talents, but no. You were all there when Hermione charmed the bet so that no one could cheat.”
Harry wrote his name. He hesitated then wrote: ‘Trans rights are human rights. Stay strong!’
He looked back up to see Harry smiling, his eyes bright.
“Uhh. Anyway, we should probably check the wards around the Manor.”
As they set up the chess game on the bed, Rose tugged on Draco’s sleeve.
At that moment Ivy returned, “We have several tins of paint in the cellar.”
Lucius Malfoy was standing right behind him. His wand pointed directly at Draco’s throat.
“Malfoy.” I reply, holding his gaze. His eyes are like storm clouds, all grey and foreboding.
“Draco…” hissed a voice. A voice so menacing it could hardly be real.
Malfoy stared at him. “That was a fun little speech. But it doesn’t help anything, besides, what do you know?”
“Trust me it gets better! And I also have an idea to break the ice!”
And wait for yours to interlock,
“Sorry!” Harry said, bending down to pick up the person’s book. As he stood back up, he realized he was face to face with Draco.
He raised his eyes to meet Draco’s. “You did your best.” The blonde said, “Without you the Dark Lord would still be in control..”
“Why did you say it like that?” Sadder asked, picking up on Harry’s tone.
Harry’s blush increased.
“It was just a memory.”
Harry sighed, “You felt two different magic signatures right? And you said that one of them felt like mine?”
Draco knew that his mother wouldn’t be at this hour. He could get away with murder. Not that he would have the guts to actually take someone's life.
Ron’s eyes widened, then he smacked his forehead. “It’s Luna isn’t it?”
“Harry… what is this?” She asked quietly.
Narcissa’s voice was sharp, but her eyes were concerned. Draco groaned. He hadn’t eaten for the past two days, but that was hardly important.
Ginny stood up, “I don't know Harry!” She spat, “Are we? You never really made that clear. I’ve waited for you an entire summer! And I get it, the war has left us all trying to find our feet. But while you're sitting here moping I’m trying to fix my life! And you're also forgetting that I lost a brother!”
Draco handed Harry a letter. Then he picked up Errol, “He can stay with my owl for a while.” He left the room with Errol cradled in his arms.
Fuck.
“But I let him die!” Harry whimpered, “If I had paid more attention to Snape, Tom would have never gotten inside my head!”
“Then why bring me?”
*End of Flashback*
Ivy, Cosmo and a third house elf named Coco came out carrying dinner. They ate in silence for most of the time, until Draco broke it muttering, “This place has so many bad memories.”
Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair, “Well, we’ve all made mistakes.” He mumbled, “And Malfoy’s only human.”
“Hey,” Harry said, as he was about to start on the last wall. “Why don’t you paint a landscape on here?”
Hermione’s eyes suddenly went wide, “Oh my gosh, Harry!” She squealed, “Do you have a crush on Malfoy?”
I smile and lift my head as well, “Yes. Yes we will.”
I bury my rapidly reddening face in my hands. I can't believe these people. They’re supposed to be my friends. You know, with my luck, and dramatic tension for readers, Malfoy would show up right about-
Harry also noticed that Draco spent a considerably long time in the library, making sure the paint was perfect, and that all the books were in order. When Harry asked why he explained that is was his mother’s favorite room.
He got to the ward where Draco was being kept and paused. He needed to pull himself together. Draco wasn’t going to magically awaken, and he wasn’t going to spring up and greet Harry with his usual snarky tone. No. None of that was going to happen. Harry was there to say goodbye.
Although Draco never talked about his mother, Harry knew that she wasn’t doing any better than before. Cosmo, Ivy and Coco never talked about her either, so it was obvious that Draco had ordered them not to say anything.
“Who?”
Okay, so I’ve had extra time to write. So I am posting this on Saturday! Yay!
Harry hadn’t noticed that he had stopped until he felt someone bump him from behind.
“I'll reach my hands out in the dark,
Beside Ron, Hermione’s face lit up. “No way! Ginny you too? Good for you!”
“Potter. Harry. Listen to me.” Malfoy says. I focus on his voice, my breath coming in short gasps.
“Draco… you are no assassin.”
‘All your fault. It’s all your fault.’ He thought.
Harry took a deep steadying breath; this was going to be hard. “So, after you two left… I guess it got pretty awkward. I wanted to defuse the tension, and I was also pissed so I took Draco to a place only I know about. It’s a tree. I planted it in Cedric’s honor.”
When they got up to the school Luna and Harry put their stuff by everyone else's. Harry slung his Invisibility Cloak over the both of them, and they were able to sneak into the Great Hall with no trouble.
“Just make sure that everyone’s secrets are kept.”
The Slytherin looked up, surprised, “Did I say that out loud?”
“Potter! I’m fucking sick of this!”
Harry’s jaw dropped, and Draco smirked knowing to make him even more shocked,
They spent the rest of the day checking the wards and lounging around Grimauld place. As moonrise drew nearer they grew more and more tense. Finally after hours of waiting the moon rose.
“Oh fuck you.”
“Good, for I have assigned you to find this culprit and arrest them.”
‘NO!’
“Plus, Ginny saw you fighting on our side at one point, and she made sure that everyone knew that.”
The second one laughed, “Faggot! You have a fucking rainbow patch! Your demented!”
What?
Even when I'm down to my last breath,
They continued around the circle until it got to Seamus. He was already tipsy when he announced: “Never have I ever been gay.” And downed a shot.
How was he even worthy of her help?
But on the other hand, Harry wasn’t sure if he was ready to face Hogwarts again. So many things had happened in the past months that it would be hard to go back. He would have to see all his old teachers and all his old friends. He had had no contact with the outside world since the battle, and he had gotten several letters from his old friends, but going back to see them in person after he ignored them seemed so tactless.
'Because… I’ve lost sight of what love actually is. Dumbledore would always say I would know when the time came. But lately all I feel is hate, rage and sadness. Maybe I’m broken. There’s definitely something wrong with me.’
Draco looked at him in shock, “You feel guilty? Potter, you literally saved the entire wizarding world! How can you feel guilty?”
I cross my arms as he continues.
Draco’s mother was allowed her wand back, but all the spells were being tracked. Draco got a new wand from Ollivanders, and his spells were also being tracked.
Everyone nodded, “Alright! Let's go! Umm, coffee. Dean next.”
The Slytherin rolled his eyes, and huffed, “Real mature, Potter.”
“I mean, I haven't really asked them. The subject hasn’t come up. But why are you asking me these questions.”
He reluctantly stepped back from the hole and made his way back through the castle. Back to the Great Hall. Back to suffering and sorrow. Back to Ginny. Back to reality.
But as Malfoy swung onto the back of his broom a flaming Griffin fastened it’s claws around the blonde and pulled him back into the raging flames. The last thing Harry saw was his petrified face as the flames swallowed him whole. Then he was gone.*
I narrow my eyes, “Admit it Malfoy! You're a Death Eater.”
Thanks for reading. I think there's only abut one or two more chapters so... yeah.
That just made Harry crack up more. Once he had recovered from his momentary laughing seizure he turned to Ron.
‘But-’
When Harry was adding the crushed caterpillar skin, his sleeve slipped up revealing the bandages. He dropped the skins in, and quickly tried to cover them.
With that Harry grabbed Draco’s arm and pulled him into side-along Apparition. Before he knew it Draco was zooming through the wormhole of the wizarding world.
“Potter.” Draco said affectionately, walked up to him and sat down in the only chair.
I approach his office, but I stop when I hear hushed voices.
“Maybe you should listen to her, she has a point.”
“Love you too.” Draco rolled his eyes.
Then they were on the Hogwarts platform:
Even when I'm down to my last breath,
“Stop playing hero, Harry! I can handle an Unforgivable. You forget I was a Death Eater. Voldemort knew the Imperius Curse, so I had to be a skilled Legilimens.”
“No. Nobody else! I think we just lost feelings that’s all.”
“I’ve been planning it for a while.” She said. “Tonight was the perfect night!”
“Yes. Yes I took the Dark Mark. But I want the Dark Lord defeated as much as you. And your- you're the only one who can stop him.”
Harry rolled his eyes, “Just tell me what happened. Get it off your chest.”
“Relax Potter!” Draco huffed, “Your forgetting that I happen to be a Malfoy. The Manor is Unplottable, only people who know about it can get in.”
Dean looks up from where he’s sitting, “C’mon! Really! The PDA? Right in front of my salad!”
“Oh, yes I would.”
“What if we remodeled it?”
He heard the blonde sigh, exasperated, “You know exactly what I mean. Do you or do you not, have a crush on me?”
Harry blinked. He’d never really thought about it that way. A memory came back to him from the night he wanted to run away from the Burrow…
Harry and Ron laughed at his embarrassment.
Hermione sighed, “I suppose. But I honestly have reason to believe that he doesn’t want to get married.”
Ron just rolls his eyes and turns to Quinn, “Did you finnish the Potions essay?”
Draco snorted, “Well, I mean, I wasn't exactly nice to him in school. Or any of the Weasleys for that matter. So I don't blame him.”
Harry was running alongside the carriage trying to keep up. The threastals would /not/ slow down. He heaved his trunk and threw it at Ron, but not before tripping and face planting in the mud. He heard the thump of his trunk as it missed Ron’s outstretched hands, and the carriage sped away.
‘Ginny didn’t deserve that! Harry, you love her, why would you do that! If you love her why treat seeing her like a chore! Why did you drag yourself to go and talk to her?’
Harry stepped aside, revealing the cake, but not daring to look at Ron and Hermione. He was still ashamed and looking down at his feet.
“Doesn’t matter.” He said gruffly, “Now, are we going to do the next one or not?”
He took a deep breath and tried to work up the courage to say something. While he was standing there like an idiot, Pansy noticed him.
“This is a muggle amusement park.”
Draco hesitated.
He left Harry standing there and climbed stairs. The attic had a heavy wooden trap door that was almost too heavy.
“We got on and at first it was really fun. Because this was the only ride that my aunt and uncle let me go on. And we weren't really up that high yet. But then Dudley started rocking the little platform we were on. If it hadn't had walls we wouldn't have survived. When we got to the very top I was so scared. I remember it like it was yesterday.
And my heart breaks.
Once Draco had his dress robes on he reached under the sink to retrieve a small stack of letters. He swished his wand once and they dissolved into thin air. Satisfied he left the bathroom.
They stayed like that until dawn. It was Harry that was the first one to break the silence.
I'm not giving' up,
Harry knew that those words from anyone else would have gone in one ear and out the other. But coming from Draco Malfoy, they meant the world. And he couldn't explain why.
Hope you liked it! Comments, kudos and constructive criticism is always welcome!
He glared daggers at Hermione who just laughed and said, “See how bad this can get? Who’s next?”
Pain pierced Draco like an oxen's horns. It ran through his body threatening to push him over the edge. Then it stopped and Draco collapsed once more. Harry rushed over to him.
“A little more than rough!” Seamus piped up from his place beside Dean.
“Whatever. I have to go study.” He hesitated, “I’m glad you're out of bed.”
“Let’s go tell Quinn!” Dean says.
“Welcome back to a new year at Hogwarts! I would like to remind everyone that the Forbidden Forest is /off limits!/ I think some of our older students should be reminded of that. Mr. Filch has posted the full set of rules on his door, and would like me to remind everyone that products from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes are strictly prohibited. Heaven knows that you all will probably find a way to sneak them in anyway.”
“Your parents might meet a sticky end.”
“I appreciate the apology Harry. But I know it’s been harder for you than anyone else. So I didn’t really take any offense. You were going through a tough time, and when you were ready you talked to me. That’s all that really counts.”
Eventually Draco came back to the present world, he uncurled his hands from his hair and sat back up. Harry felt as if he were about to cry with relief.
Harry was looking around and… crying?
“Magic.” Hermione said, smirking, “And now I am placing a spell on this room that binds you to your dares. It is a spell of my own making, so there’s no loopholes.”
Harry tore them both open to find the words ‘you’ and ‘ready’. Draco was amused; he had never seen his boyfriend more confused.
“Hey!” Harry looked up, Seamus was walking backwards looking back at the group. “Do you all wanna play a game?”
When Harry woke on Christmas morning three thoughts flitted through his mind.
Christmas Day
Harry pulled him into the place, they checked in and sat down at the window table.
Draco shot him a glare, but accepted the package Molly was holding. It was wrapped in bright orange paper with little Golden snitches. He carefully undid the wrapping and almost dropped it.
“Oh come on! I know you practice when you're off work and I’m not.”
“Do you want me to go?”
‘No.’ Draco responded easily keeping in the right headspace. His Occlumency lessons were starting to pay off.
Harry slapped his arm, “NO! I was talking about the war. The war is the bad thing in all of our pasts. As well as my parents' deaths. I was also talking about you! You're the good thing in my present!”
‘What is he up to?’
Harry nodded.
Harry’s eyes went wide, “Of course not! Why would I hate you for being pan?”
Narcissa looked at him sadly, “Is that what you think?”
“Oh here we go…” Bill muttered. “Honestly, I still don’t get why you and Percy aren’t an item. You would keep each other busy all day with your speeches.”
“An unbreakable vow?” Harry asked, “With Pansy? What is she talking about?”
Tears were streaming down Malfoy’s face. And that’s when I realized: he’s still human.
“What?” He heard Ron ask.
Harry turned to the girl, “Are you okay?” He asked.
“Just as someone convinced me that the Order really can win the war. Someone convinced me to stand up to Severus. Someone convinced me to apologize to Hagrid. Someone convinced me to forget my sexist, racist, homophobic past, and change. Someone convinced me that Hermione really is the brightest witch of her age, and that the Weasleys really are wonderful people…
Hermione rolled her eyes, “Sexual tension!”
Hermione raised an amused eyebrow at him, “Where did you stay the night if you didn’t go back to the Manor?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I think I can handle my mother.”
Inside was a tiny silver clasp. Like a crest. But it wasn't. On the silver there were two small blue animals, a dragon and a ferret. They were twisting around each other in endless circles and their eyes were a glowing white.
Harry creased his eyebrows, “Alright.” He got up from the table and made his way to the back of the house. He opened the back door, Arthur was indeed standing in the South Garden, but someone else was with him.
Malfoy sounds panicked. But I couldn't care less.
What was he going to do about this case?
Draco averted his eyes and mumbled, “Idonthaveone.”
“Alright, alright! Just get this blasted charm off of me!” Draco wheezed.
Harry watched as both their eyes widened in dismay upon seeing the cuts. He turned his head away.
He sighed, “Yes. I have a crush on Draco.”
“When did you find out?”
“So you're not annoyed at me for the whole patronus thing?”
Harry scrambled up knocking over the chess board in the process. “Ron! Wait. It’s fine we were just playing chess.”
Harry sighed. Everything was going wrong. He heaved himself out of bed once more and left the room for a drink. Just as he was about to walk down the stairs he heard voices.
Malfoy seems to know that too because he says, “Don’t think I don’t notice it Potter. Always sneaking around under cover. With that cloak of yours. But your still noisy as fuck.”
They represent every night in 6th year when we would spend hours looking up at the stars.
Harry let out a dry laugh, “Trust you to make a serious moment competitive.”
The second receptionist whispered to the first, her eyes widened. “Umm, of course. Come this way Mr. Malfoy-Potter. Your husband is on the fourth floor.”
Draco sat there lost for words. But Harry wasn’t done. (But at least his magic was going down.)
‘Still-’
Everyone was already in there sitting on the couches. It seemed as if no one was tired.
“For the last time-”
Being gay wasn’t widely exepted in the Wizarding World. And even places that it was, people still had to keep it a secret. Harry had long ago suspected that he had an attraction to men. But had kept in under wraps in fear of anyone finding out. Especially the Dursley’s. If they suspected anything that would have done unthinkable things to him.
Harry punched Ron a little harder this time.
Harry spoke up beside him, “Will everything be okay now?” His voice sounded a little fearful, and Draco guessed what he was refusing to.
They both whipped around, Ron was standing at the door with Hermione and Rose.
Draco lay limp in Harry’s arms and finally finished with the story. And Harry buried his nose in Draco’s hair.
“Yeah. Wait…”
This time Malfoy reacted. He spun around and sprinted toward Harry, slamming him into the wall. He pinned the brunet’s arms by his side, and Harry could feel the Slytherin’s hot breath on his neck. The Gryffindor’s eyes widened in shock.
“Not to worry, not to worry!” Slughorn chortles. With a flick of his wand the mess is gone.
“And how did you get past the Manor’s wards?”
Harry smiled and turned to his own pile of presents. He opened them one by one, Bill had gotten him a miniature replica of the Sword of Gryffindor, Charlie and Ginny had pooled their money, and gotten him a brand new pair of dragon hide work gloves.
Draco opened his eyes. Sunlight was filtering in through the window. He immediately felt the absence of something beside him, and stiffened. Until he heard the sound of a muggle machine whirring downstairs.
“Expelliarmus!”
He walked down the creaky stairs trying not to wake anyone. The kitchen was bathed in moonlight. He padded out of the black door and into the garden. The grass felt cool and soft betheath his bare feet.
Draco stared numbly down at the food placed in front of him. His appetite had been absent for three years. He had only eaten because his mom had told him to. He didn’t see the point. No one would care if he starved, except his mom. The only reason Draco still lived is because he knew that if he committed suicide his mom would become utterly broken.
He had made the Weasleys’ life hell. They should have yelled. Kicked him out. Screamed in his face. And yet they didn’t do any of those things. They had forgiven him. Hell! They had even given him a Weasley Jumper.
He put a hand on the doorknob and tried to turn it. He couldn’t. It was locked. He cast an Alohomora that didn’t work. He was about to run and get the healers when he heard excited shouts from within the room. What was going on?
Harry nodded numbly and tried to think of a happy memory. It was hard, but the one he chose was of him and Draco on the tree that one fateful night. “Expecto Patronum.”
Harry’s fingers relaxed, and he seemed at ease. Until Draco saw him take in the space around them.
The time in the tree:
Hope your winter break is going well! Molly was pretty upset when you didn’t want to stay. But she got over it. She told Ron and I to invite you to Christmas.
“Fine. It’s probably been the worst year ever. But we can still look ahead! Right?”
“Alright, alright. Maybe Potter and I had a little bit of tension. But we’re just friends, er, partners now. Nothing more. Are we going to continue this childish teasing like we’re in 1st year? Or are we going to act more mature?”
When they were leaving the restaurant, Draco heard Harry’s mobile phone ding. Harry took it out and sighed, “What the hell?”
Half an hour later they were all sitting in a train compartment and snacking on chocolate frogs and licorice wands. Hermione had the new assigned textbooks out and was flipping through them looking for spells they had yet to learn.
Everyone froze, as they watched Dean take a shot as well. Harry muttered a quick spell under his breath and watched as his shot glass faded back to its original clear color.
The blonde smiled and handed the tiny creature his trunk, Cosmo carried it with surprising strength. “I’ll be back for yours Master Potter!” He said, and Apperated away.
But Harry thought nothing of it at the time. So he leaned into Draco’s touch. The two stayed like that for a while, and Draco had to resist the urge to run his hand through Harry’s ebony hair. It looked quite soft.
Draco shook his head, trying to comprehend what Harry was saying.
Cosmo and Coco nodded, looking dead on their feet. As they slumped back down the stairs at the kitchens, Draco turned to Harry. “I’m going to check on my mother. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Lucius glared down at him, but recognized his defeat. Harry thrust Lucius’ wand back, but kept his own firmly fixed at Draco’s father’s chest.
But Malfoy ignored him and walked down the steps toward the door. Casting an Alohomora.
Hermione looked over her shoulder startled.
“Are you okay?”
Harry had seen Luna and Nevil going on the train. And of course Ginny was going. His Ginny. Well. He couldn’t really call Ginny his anymore. They never really got back together. And he’d never been there after the war. He’d holed himself up in his room.
Harry swerved around a Horned Serpent and dived for the tower where the Slytherin’s were hanging on.
“Yeah, um. Never mind.”
Draco looked at him oddly, “What else did Dumbledore teach you in your private lessons? How to speak in tongues?”
Harry grabbed Draco's wrist and dragged him into the living room. “C’mon, let’s give him some space.”
‘You saw him say ‘fuck you’ to Snape. That should count for something.’
“I-I can’t be sure.”
Draco smirked a trademark smirk, “Oh, I think it’s quite fair.”
Oh, so it was Sirius this time.
The time when Granger punched him:
“Are okay?” Draco asked, turning to him.
“Ron-”
Draco froze. Harry was about to find out the truth. You know what... As long as he thought that he only was a schoolboy crush, it was okay. “I might have.”
As Harry walked along the rows of bookshelves he remembered what happened with the transgender girl last time he was here. He kept his eyes peeled for the three bullies.
Harry looked at him in shock, how did he know that Dumbledore would always leave him in the dark? “Th-Thanks, I guess.”
Harry rounded the corner, he didn’t even know where he was going anymore. He was just trying to escape the flapping wings behind him. He passed a tapestry and realized that it was of Barnabas the Barmy.
I raise my eyebrows, “Did you just manage to compliment Hermione and be civil to me in the same sentence? I’m impressed.”
“A question you still haven’t answered.”
Harry pursed his lips. “One: how do you know all this? And two: why does that have anything to do with whether or not I’m in the LGBTQ+ community?”
But Kreacher was already gone. Harry sighed. He should probably go see what Sadder wanted.
He opens the door and we bundle in. Pressed face-first against a wall, I hold my breath and wait for Filch’s footsteps to pass. When I hear him muttering about Peeves I know that it’s safe to start breathing again.
“Um, okay…”
“Hey ‘Mione.” Harry said not seeming to notice, “Did you order drinks yet?”
“I’m fine.” He said nonchalantly, “That was one strong Curse Potter. Did you have practice?”
I start shaking.
“Murderer? Monster? Killer? Potter. I have not committed any murder. And never will. I am not completing the task the Dark Lord sent me to do. Something changed my mind. Or, someone.”
“What is it?”
“I’m not noisy!”
Harry kept walking until he came to a compartment with a certain blonde haired Slytherin.
“Hullo Harry, Neville.”
The man whipped around, “Crucio!” Draco was lifted off his feet and thrown back by the force of the spell. Luckily Harry had intercepted with a Shield Charm and blocked the worst of it. Yep. This was definitely the real Lucius Malfoy.
“Ah, come on!” Ginny said, “There’s no need to be so proper! We’re the Weasleys!”
His mother must be pissed.
“Yep.”
“Neville? Did you have something to tell me?”
Harry plopped his butt down on the couch as Draco sat down gracefully. “So,” he began, “Tell me everything you know about where we were yesterday.”
“Draco! Look at me!”
The voice was getting louder, but Draco just kept staring at his book. A Muggle book.
Everyone laughed at that, but there was still a seriousness in the room at the mention of Fred’s death.
Harry reached for his wand but the blonde was faster. He pinned Harry’s arms by his side. “I told you I was going to get my revenge. I believe my exact words were: ‘Just wait, it’ll be you squirming on the floor next time.’ And here you finally got what was coming for you.”
“Qu'est-ce que j'aurais dit à Granger et Weasley?” Malfoy was pacing about the room now, speaking French.
The next morning Harry was walking down to the Great Hall, when Luna came up to him.
“What?”
“He’s human. Just like everyone else. We make mistakes.”
“Are you going?” Ron asked.
“Will you bake a cake for me?”
Draco tensed. Of course his father meant Crabbe Sr., but it was still unnerving to hear the name of his dead friend.
Harry was still grinning like the Cheshire Cat when he handed something to Draco. “This just arrived.”
Draco sighed and leaned on Harry's arm. This was just great. Just absolutely amazing.
She stood up and announced, “Let’s do another ice breaker!”
And if that meant throwing away your own feelings, so be it.
I collapse on the ground and then he’s there beside me.
Harry nodded and Ginny got up and they walked out of the Gryffindor common room. He followed her outside and they sat by the lake watching the sun set. It would have been romantic if this were any other time.
But Hermione had seen everything. She grabbed Harry’s forearm, (which made him wince in pain) and wrenched up the sleeve.
Harry turned, Neville was walking up to them.
“No. I had a friend.”
Okay, so, I have a tight schedule now. Even during this epidemic. So I promise that I’ll  be posting every Wednesday. It could be more frequently, but we’ll just have to wait and see.
Draco gaped at him, “So you’re telling me that a little piece of Voldemort was in you for all those years?”
“I can make you go, you know. I notice you don’t have your wand on you.”
“Hello Potter.”
Draco’s eyes widened in understanding and surprise. “So are you-”
Harry paced around the Grimmauld Place kitchen, “‘Mione! Please stop! I know he’s going to make it out of this!”
Kreacher stepped out from behind a fairly large crockpot, “Of course master.” He pointed to a table behind him. On it sat a large vanilla frosted cake.
“Potter.”
It won't shake me loose,
Harry’s jaw dropped, “No way!”
“But-”
“Never mind. Just go on with your story.”
Harry froze and glared at him. Then he raised his wand, “Rictusempra!”
Harry nodded again.
That was Potter.
He dropped the pastry.
Hermione nodded and said mischievously, “I might have to tell Ron that you fancy Harry, but don’t worry. Your secret's safe with me.”
“Thanks.”
What happened next the blonde would never be able to explain. Why would he do such a thing? What made him do it? Why didn’t he have the ability to think anything through? Regardless of the questions Draco did something that he would always ponder.
“If we must, Potter.” Draco’s expression was exasperated, but his eyes would surely betray him.
“We could Apparate over there right now! You're on to something, this is why I like being your partner.”
Draco nodded.
Draco and Ron both looked at him as if he had sprouted antlers. “What?” Harry said. “I'm sure your family will be fine with it.”
“Did you do it on yourself?”
Harry quickly turned his head to check. Yep. Malfoy knew where they were. He was standing rigid, hands clutching his paper, eyes glazed over. And Harry knew he was back in the flames.
“Yes?”
I nod, confused. “I c-can see the door. The s-stone wall…”
“You're staring loudly.” Harry said, looking up.
He takes my silence the wrong way, “Oh shit, I thought this was a good idea. I thought you would- wait never mind. I should go-”
“I know what’ll cheer you up!” Rose said, holding up a wizard chess game board.
Harry looked around in confusion and then noticed that the table he sat at consisted entirely of people in their ‘8th’ year.
Harry brushed off the thing poking him in the arm and sat up. “What?” He said groggily, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.
They continue, “We’re having Apparition lessons!”
“Great.” Harry rubbed the back of his neck nervously, “Hey, so you want to get a Butterbeer or something?”
“Okay. Go ahead.”
“Father, I assure you that it was nothing more than a schoolboy crush.”
“I’m not pining!” I say stubbornly.
When Harry entered the 8th year common room the first thing he noticed was the explosion of color. It seemed as if an entire rainbow was smashed together and stuffed in there. The room was in the shape of a square. Each corner had a different house color. They all met in the middle on a pinwheel carpet. It was an eyesore.
Harry blinked and looked down. Coco was standing beside his bed with a towel.
“Alright, but only if I get to be Harry this time.”
Then Harry heard heavy breathing. The ruffling of sheets. And pacing.
“Hermione’s gotten me a broomstick!” Ron tore off the brown paper to reveal a shiny new Nimbus 4,001. He held it against the light admiring it. “I love that woman.” He whispered, probably more to himself than Harry.
Draco shut his eyes tight and focused on his memory. A memory he had just made while kissing the raven haired man.
“I also have a giant poster of your face above my bed, so that you’re the first thing I see when I wake up, and the last thing I see when I go to sleep! There’s also a picture of you on my pillow, so I can kiss you goodnight.”
“And, I heard from Pansy that he slapped a seventh year for calling a muggle-born Slytherin a mud-blood. Harry I really think he’s changed. Give it a shot.”
Draco glared at her, “I swear I will get you fired if you don’t tell me where my husband is.”
The stairs. And the cupboard under them.
When Harry heard the slam of the door, he slid his back down the bathroom wall and burst into tears. And the worst part was: he didn’t even know why.
Harry stuck out his tongue, “Maybe I am.”
Draco looked up. Mr. Border was sitting at his desk, shuffling through papers.
The words play in my brain like a broken record.
I shake my head and rub the back of my neck.
“Harry,” Draco whispers, “I promise you're safe. I’m not going to let anyone hurt you, love.”
He exploded, “YOU CAN STOP YOUR HEROICS POTTER! I DON’T NEED YOUR HELP, AND STOP GUESSING WHY I DON’T WANT TO DO IT! HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED THAT MAYBE IT’S BECAUSE I DON’T HAVE A SINGLE POWERFUL HAPPY MEMORY?”
“Yeah.”
He burst into tears, and Draco went rigid. This was not his intent, he had just wanted to tell the truth and now he had made Harry cry. Oh, fuck him!
Malfoy lets out an exasperated sigh, “What else do I have to do to convince you that I’m not going to kill you?”
“By the way,” Harry said, “I don’t hate you. I can tell that’s what you're thinking right now. But I don't hate you.” He paused, then murmured, “I don’t think I ever did.”
Harry looked up. Malfoy was glaring at him from the doorway.
“Good morning Draco. The house elves prepared your breakfast. I know you have to get to work but please eat something.”
“Of what?” Harry prompted, he wasn’t about to let Draco go on hurting alone.
Is black and blue.”
They both burst out laughing.
“Yes, just a tad tired.”
Harry took a deep breath, “Have you… have you told anyone that I’m bisexual?”
He whisks away and I am left standing behind the tapestry. It’s weird. Maybe I was imagining it, but there seemed to be a concerned tone under the sneers and insults.
They Apperated right outside of the Three Broomsticks’ door. It was especially chilly for November and all three of them didn’t have coats.
“No not really, I just wanted to talk to you.”
The Wizengamot had believed him (of course) because he was the world's Golden Boy. That’s how Draco ended up still living, although every day he thought about ending it all.
Draco glanced at him, “What? What do you mean?”
Harry broke down into tears, “I’m so sorry. I should have been more thorough with the Dispeller spells! I should have added extra ones. But no! I was being stupid and now your here. It’s so hard to look at you and know that it was my fault! Hermione wants to know why I care so much and I told her it was because you were my friend. But then she said that ‘friends don’t stalk each other.’ And then she pointed out that I probably had a crush on you way before this case. And I mean she’s Hermione, she knows fucking everything!”
Harry’s legs obviously felt the same way because he collapsed on the platform. The file fell from his hands and dropped all the way to the ground fifteen meters below.
“I’ll apologize when I’m ready.” Harry snapped.
So don't give up on me.”
“Well, I'll let you know that no son of mine will do anything with a boy.” Lucius spat the words with venom.
“Good morning, mother.” He said.
“Two: I know that these past years have been rough-“
“Oi Harry!” She shouted, “Malfoy over here just admitted that you two had a crush on each other in school!”
When he was rounding a corner, a sharp voice dragged him out of his thoughts.
“What do you want Potter?”
“Kreacher?” He asked.
Harry did a silent fist pump. “We could also ask the house elves.” He suggested. “I’m sure they'd love to help.”
They appeared in the Manor and Draco felt his heartbeat quicken even more. “We have to find my mother!” He gasped.
And wait for yours to interlock,
“Except for right now. You have an inner conflict I see. What’s been bothering you lately?”
That answer was also waiting for him.
But most of all, they represent ‘good-bye’.
Harry and Draco spent the rest of the day with the Weasleys, eating Christmas food, opening Christmas presents and having a few drinks. One particularly memorable moment was when Ron drank so much that he took off his pants and ran around the kitchen half naked.
“Then that’s stalking.” Pansy says. Then she sits herself down next to Quinn and gives them a kiss on the cheek. “Who’s room tonight?”
“Someone who was and still is /wholeheartedly/ dedicated to Tom. The ones he gathered at the end I don’t count because they weren't as dedicated as, let’s say, Bellatrix!”
Potter nodded, and Weasly clenched his jaw. “Watch your back Malfoy.” He snarled and then swept out of the office.
Draco smiled down at it.
“No ‘buts’. He would have gotten caught by the Ministry regardless. I think he would have rather died defending you, then spent the rest of his life in prison.” Draco wrapped his arms around the raven haired man, and squeezed at tight as he could.
They both said their goodnight’s after dinner and went to their respective rooms. Harry fell asleep excited for the next day when he and Draco would be re-decorating the entire Manor. It was a daunting task, but an exhilarating one.
His heart flipped and he spun around.
So he sped past the door and kept on running. Then he noticed another door. It was the door to the Astronomy Tower. He dashed inside and slammed the door shut, hearing the sickening thuds of bodies hitting wood. He winced as he got faint flashbacks of the battle.
“I kind of insulted his family.”
“I’ll tell you if you can sit still and listen to me.”
Harry spent the whole train ride with his friends. People he could trust. It felt amazing, he hadn’t had this much fun in two years. You know, it’s a little hard to have fun when an evil wizard is trying to hunt you down and kill you, while /you/ are trying to kill /him/.
When Slughorn was done giving directions Hermione got up to go get the ingredients. Harry squinted at the chalkboard, adjusting his glasses.
Harry hid his rapidly reddining face in his hands. Hermione gave a very girlish squeal that was very out of character and Ron just said: “Bloody hell, mate.”
Draco didn’t hesitate, he took off down the long corridors and practically threw himself down the staircases. Harry was close on his tail.
Ron shook his head, “No mate, we’re not. Why would you do that?”
Draco chuckled, “Well if you’re sure-”
“What do you mean?” Harry said, “I’m probably going to the Burrow.”
“Harry? Harry will you please come out of your room? We just want to talk to you.”
I'm not giving' up, givin' up,
Draco sighed, “Yeah… No…”
Why had the Healers been shouting? It sounded as if something good had happened. Had Draco woken up? No. If he had, the Healers would have opened the door to let him in.
Draco didn’t say anything, he was too busy trying not to give himself away. He knew exactly what Pansy was talking about.
“You know, like you did in our eighth year.”
“Mr. Malfoy? Mr. Malfoy? Hello?”
“Wow. You really had this planned.” Draco commented, opening his menu.
“Well, I’m the ‘Savior’ I can’t get in trouble.”
“But then came Hogwarts, I thought it would be better to be away from those dark halls, but it was even worse. People stared at me in the hallways. It was unbearable. So, I tried my best to-”
The sound of a crash startled Harry out of his thoughts. He got out of bed and walked over to the door. Pressing his ear against it he heard nothing. Against his better judgment he turned the knob and softly opened it.
I don’t have to answer because at that moment the whole Hall gasped, I turn, confused. I notice what they’re all staring at.
“Yep.”
“Want to talk about it?” Harry reached up to wipe tears of Draco’s face that he hadn’t known were there.
“Can you sing something?”
“Who else is here? I heard you talking!”
“Yes, I did.” Harry said warily.
Harry was starting to get worked up; he had jumped up from his seat and was now pacing the room.
Both Ron and Harry’s eyebrows shot up.
‘And you have to admit, he looks real hot in his Quidditch robes. And with that rainbow hair… Damn. Just admit you have a crush.’
“Aww c’mon! I didn’t mean that!” Ron protested.
His wards were strong, but some people spelled their owls to make it past even Hermione’s strongest spells. The charms they use were most likely illegal.
Harry’s brow furrowed. How was he supposed to know this!? Slughorn had given them too much homework. How was he was supposed to write an essay about the 181 uses of doxy eggs in potions, when he had no idea what half of them were?!
“Draco, Draco, you're not alone…”
“Screw off, Potter.” Malfoy said. He sounded tired.
‘Oh,’ Harry thought, ‘Of course he only cares about himself.’ He told himself that it didn't matter whether Malfoy cared about him or not. But then why did it hurt?
He turned back around to see the girl step out of the alcove, but in front of her stood three older sixth years. They looked like they were cornering her.
Draco looked at Harry and slowly nodded, “There are certain rules, but that might work… I was thinking about it, but with my reputation I can’t do any of them.” He spat bitterly, “The Ministry would have me shipped off to Azkaban the second I even suggested the thought of doing it. But you being the Golden Boy, you can do anything, and the Ministry would still be kissing your arse.”
Lucius Malfoy was standing in the middle of the room.
Harry looked at him skeptically and then nodded.
“Still you.” Draco said, flying down as well and casting an amused look at his boyfriend. “I’m not the one sticking my tongue out.”
“Gay. Maybe. I mean I think so. All of the girls I've dated…  well it just didn’t feel right I guess.”
Harry opened his mouth and tried to think up a lie. “I was visiting Kreacher in the kitchens. I wanted to see how he was doing in his new home.”
And not just any person. It’s Draco Malfoy. Of-fucking-course. Always the center of attention.
“Okay. Just know that you can tell me anything.”
But then again, I’m not too worried. Malfoy seemed like he wasn’t actually going to do it. I don’t know why but I have this feeling that I can trust him. And I tend to trust my gut over any actual evidence.
“Nevil wait!”
“What is that sir?” Draco queried, trying to keep the surprise out of his voice.
As Ivy disappeared, Harry glanced at the Slytherin. “Are you going to paint it the Muggle way? Wow, younger Draco would have never done that.”
“I don’t care! Hermione, do you really think I’m going to ask out someone who’s engaged? I’m not that stupid.”
Rose jumped up and down almost dropping the game, “Yaaayyy! I’ll be daddy then!”
‘That must have been tough.’ He thought. Out loud he said, “Well, that must have been why I hated you.”
They began to play.
Twenty minutes later Harry was walking down the stairs, desperately trying to flatten his semi-dry hair. (As usual his attempts were fruitless.)
Draco focused all of his remaining sanity into giving Harry's a death glare. Harry looked away, sighed and said the counter jinx.
“Fine, but only because we’re on a case. We will come back to this later.”
He gave her a tight smile and stepped out of the alcove, returning to his search. That’s when he heard a whimper.
There was a knock on the compartment door as the train started up, Harry turned his head. Ginny, Neville and Luna were standing there. Harry stood up and let them in.
“You don’t have to go you know.” Harry whispered into Draco’s ear.
He sat up and sighed. He hadn’t had that dream in a while. It had plagued him all through the summer and the start of eighth year, but he thought it had gone away. Except it was back.
We finally pull away and rest our foreheads on each other's shoulders.
Even though his body was tired. His mind was buzzing with questions:
Draco just looked at him desperately. Harry’s eyes looked confused for a moment, then he came to a conclusion. He grabbed Draco’s hand, “Draco! Look me in the eyes.” Draco did. “She’s going to be alright! You just need to calm down. Our mission here is to stop the culprit and make sure your mum’s safe.”
“Ronald.” Hermione said sternly, “Stop being so mopey. Harry is his own person.”
“He asked ‘Are you quite sure that you dislike Mr. Malfoy.’ I told him I did and he just said, ‘By the looks of this case you don’t.’ Then he kicked me out of the shop!
Draco looked around, “Haven't you noticed the spell damage on those train tracks?” He asked.
With Harry’s help, they moved the couch and several chairs out and into the other guest bedroom. Then they got to work painting the walls with big rollers.
Ginny sighed, losing her flame. “I don’t know Harry. I don’t know. But maybe I’ll stop caring about you sooner or later.”
Draco watched him go, thoroughly uninterested, and not at all surprised at the less than warm welcome.
“I was summoned by the Master.” he said, in his scratchy voice.
Draco cleared his throat, “I’ll, um, I’ll go sort out whatever’s in your attic.”
“So difficult!”
‘Very funny, Hermione.’
“Harry! Hurry! Throw me your trunk!”
Draco shrugged, “Of course. If we’re… friends now. I feel I can tell you a few things. Your personality is quite,” he paused and tried to make his next words as sarcastic as possible, “quite, charming. But your taste in clothing is another thing all together.”
“Mr. Potter, I believe this is for you.”
Harry sighed and his shoulders relaxed, “Your right. No need to get so worked up. But we should still be ready just in case. Can you owl your mum and tell her that we’re coming over for special Ministry business? You can borrow Mudpie.” He gestured to a quiet tawny owl in the corner that Draco had not noticed before.
“What do you mean.”
“Attacked you?”
Draco and Harry exchanged a look. “You could say that.” The Slytherin replied.
Thanks for reading! Constructive criticism/kudos/comments are always welcome!
(“Getting drunk on our first night here is such a Gryffindor thing to do!” Terry Boot of Ravenclaw muttered.)
Narcissa glared at him, “Don’t ‘good morning mother’ me!” She snapped “Were you about to leave without breakfast!”
Everyone laughed at that.
Harry turned, Malfoy was leaning on a shelf behind him. “How long have you been there?” He asked, surprised.
I’m about ready to punch him. “Either you tell me why I’m here or I hex your balls off!” I pull out my wand and point it at him. But it flies out of my hand. It’s an impressive display of wandless magic, and only in our fifth year.
Draco was the first to Apperate off the platform in the sky and get his feet on flat ground. But he noticed that Harry stayed up there long enough to dry his tears before Apperating down.
Well, he couldn’t worry about that now. He had a letter to write.
Draco sat there staring at Harry, stunned. But Harry wasn’t done.
Harry was finally struck with an idea.
Harry rounded a bend and came into view of the lake. He saw Ginny sitting on the edge; he hadn’t seen her in a while and it seemed as if her style had completely changed, she wasn’t wearing as much makeup as before and her hair was up in a messy bun.
“I feel like this is my fault. Maybe I let him believe that he isn’t worth anything.”
Harry walked over to stand beside him, “What? What’s impossible?”
“I think I’m going back to the Manor.”
“Good, and by the way it’s Harry.”
Malfoy took it from him with steady hands. “Uhh, thanks Potter.”
Malfoy looked up surprised, “Did I say that out loud?”
Harry gave a small smile and sat down opposite him. They stayed like that for a long time, sitting in awkward silence. Harry examined the Slytherin. He was sitting rigid on the edge of his chair. But his face was relaxed and he was looking out the window at the rolling fields.
He turns, startled, “I do have detention as well. I assume you didn’t do any cleaning.”
They represent all of those times I had feared for Draco’s life a hundred times more than my own.
He stayed silent as an elf ran over to clean up the mess.
“Then Ginny confessed /her/ love for a certain Ravenclaw.” Harry said.
“Well,” Ginny said, “This prat here didn’t talk to me the whole summer. I got mad at him, and then he said all the wrong things. He doesn’t know how to talk to girls it seems.”
It was weird to think about Draco Malfoy, the stuck up git who had bullied him in school, was now his boyfriend. Of course, no one was at all surprised when Harry had announced that they were dating. In fact, no one even batted an eyelash.
Out of all the people who had to be here. It had to be him. Of-fucking-course. Shit.
“Okay.” Ron said glumly.
I look up at him in shock, “I have a crush on Malfoy.”
Harry looked at him and then his father, “I’ll go get your mum.” He said to Draco.
Draco sighed in relief as the lady led him over to the lifts. She took him up to the fourth floor, “He’s two doors to the left.”
“Yes, as well as Occlumency. Now please! Can we get on with it?”
“If you want me to go a different way-”
Harry shrugged, “Well for one, I prefer cocks. And umm… I think I had a little thing for Cedric back in fourth year, but we all know how that ended…” He trailed off, avoiding Draco’s gaze.
‘What professors are going to fill in all the slots? How would they find new people?’
The blonde inhaled; he knew the question was coming. “I don’t really want to talk about it.” He let his arms fall back to his sides, and instantly missed Harry’s warmth.
Harry handed him the thin folder. “Still don't know why we need them. There's nothing in there anyway.”
He sat down beside Harry. Not daring to breath. They just sat like that for a long time, Draco knew that sometimes people just needed time and space. He was willing to sit here for as long as Harry needed. Then Harry broke the silence.
“That was for my father. Enjoy the ride back to London.”
Dean looked thoughtful for a moment before saying, “It wasn’t too bad, I mean, I was kinda forced to by the drink, but nobody was mean.”
Ron and Harry stared at her for a moment before bursting out laughing.
You can’t do that to Mother.
He shook himself; now was not the time for sappy shit. “Ron and Hermione told me to say…” Harry could not bring himself to say the word. Instead he said, “They uh, they also saw my new patronus. I know you're probably wondering about it too. I honestly don’t know why it changed.”
When McGonagall finally called everyone to a halt he was grateful and ready to flop down on his bed. Then he noticed where they were. The seventh floor corridor.
“Ms. Pansy Parkinson.”
Ron nodded, “Yeah mate. You did some serious damage to yourself.” His eyes glinted, “And your mum from the sound of it.”
Then he whispered a spell and the toothbrush magically turned into a razor.
‘But they’ve never been this sincere before.’
“Hey, there’s this new book that I really wanted.” Neville said, pointing to Tomes and Scrolls.
When Harry finally blinked open his eyes, sunlight was filtering through the window. He sat up groggily and found he was in his bed. He reached for his glasses, and put them on. That’s when he noticed the bandages. Then everything that happened with Malfoy the night before came rushing back.
He didn’t know what compelled him to go in, but he was already sliding the door open.
Draco smiled mischievously, “How about a Seeker's Game?”
Nevil seems nervous.
Draco’s voice was getting weaker.
They represent the pain and agony we both went through to be together.
‘No!’
“Crabbe.”
True to his word Cosmo came back and took Harry’s trunk too.
“Ready love?” Draco asked, pressing a soft kiss to his boyfriend’s lips.
“Serpensortia!”
“It’s from Hermione!” He exclaimed excitedly “Fluer has decided on a name! Winter!”
‘Yeah, but-’
“What- what are you doing here?” I splutter feeling my heart flutter. “Have you come to try and kill me in a dark passageway? So that no one would know?”
Hermione held up her hands, “Okay okay, you win. But just keep what I said in mind.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Kreacher scowled at him. “Master.”
Narcissa waved her wand and a plate of food appeared on the table.
Draco cleared his throat, trying to calm his nerves. “Are you ready to make the unbreakable vow?”
Draco rushed out of the bathroom to find Harry standing in their room, holding another letter.
“Didn’t feel like it!” She said, harshly, “I was worried sick! Do you know how it feels to have someone you care about just ignore you?”
The dark room became partially lit but he couldn’t see everything.
Harry was cracking up. Tears were forming in his eyes. “Merlin Draco!” He exclaimed, “I love your mum.”
Harry stared at her in horror, the teachers would kill him! But he was bound to the dare so he used his wand to cut uneven slits in his sleeves.
Harry was confused. “I’m what?”
Both Harry and Hermione laughed through their tears. Harry walked over to the cake. Under the white frosting there were three layers: a pink one, a purple one, and a blue one. It was a bisexual cake.
“Hey!” He said, trying to shake the hand off of his arm. “Let go.”
“My h-hands. Y-Your hands. And… the doorknob-b.”
“I. Don’t. Have. A. Patronus.”
“Draco?”
Harry stepped through the door. Professor Sadder was sitting at his desk, which was dark blue, much like everything else in the room.
But why?
Draco scrunched his face, “I did not need that comparison. But, if you're too much of a coward, I suppose I’ll have to deal with it.”
Then he noticed a note at the very bottom.
“The Fallen Fifty wouldn't have fallen, if I had just been faster. Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Dobby, Hedwig, Mad-eye, even Cedric. They would all still be alive if I had been faster.”
“We don’t take orders from the 'Saviour!’” The third one said, high-fiving the first one.
“Yes, but I’m sure they’d understand.”
“Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping in return she would give a cursed necklace to me? Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison?”
Harry adjusted his glasses, “Well, it’s the only thing I can get right these days.” He mumbled.
“Drop a toaster in my bath, and watch my mum and dad laugh. See a thousand volts go through the son they wish they never had.”
Next chapter right on schedule!
“Why?”
Sadder sat down again, and his voice gained a more serious tone. “I also found out that there are 8th year games. Is this true?”
Harry suddenly felt very small. “Oh, that… Ummmm… you guys should come in.”
Then both men seemed to remember who they were cuddling with. They both got up at the same time, and Draco had to turn his face away so that Harry wouldn't see his cherry red face.
Harry turned.
“I was walking to class the other day, and I heard Crabbe and Goyle badmouthing some first year muggle-born. Draco actually stood up to them. It was impressive.”
“Fine, then stay here I don’t care.” Malfoy stood up and wiped the tears off his face. “But don’t you dare tell anyone about this.”
“You need to or else…”
What was he going to do about his future wife?
“To Winter!” Everyone shouted and raised their glasses.
“Good.”
“Potter. Stop calling me cute this instant.”
He just lay there eyes wide staring at the ceiling. Until he heard soft footsteps in the corridor. Narcissa opened his door.
Harry smiled a bit at the thought and fell into step beside her. “Hey Luna. What happened to you? Did you not find a carriage?”
Draco sighed, “Your right I don’t. She was the one person that helped me at the bar. She really is the brightest witch of her age.”
“It said to RSVP a day ago!” Lucius spat, “I assume you're going. So I can just take that back.” Lucius reached for the letter, but Draco held it to his chest.
“How about detention. Right here, right now. I'm sure you'll be pleased to hear that Mr. Potter has it at the same time.”
I always do until my heart,
“I think it might have something to do with the Horcruxes.”
“How’d it go, mate?” Ron queries.
“Look who’s finally up.” Harry said, turning to face him, “I thought you would never wake.”
“Just because it’s the weekend does not mean you can sulk in your room all day. You have homework! And have you eaten anything yet?”
Harry rolled his eyes, but he had a smile on his face. It did feel good to finally tell someone.
“Mr. Potter, why are you so late to class, may I ask?”
“I’ve given plenty of time. He needs to learn to live with it. None of the rest of us are staying up in our rooms avoiding human contact!”
“Oh hey!”
I jog down the stone steps to Hagrid’s. It’s been a while. Hermione and Ron didn’t want to come. But I thought it was a good idea.
“It just says ‘Are’. What the hell?”
Harry felt a tap on the arm he turned to see Dean standing there. “Hey, you wanna work together? Seamus is out sick.”
Harry’s eyes lit up, “That reminds me!” He pulled a small cardboard box out of his pocket. “Here, I got you something.”
Draco’s heart seized. He stood there dumbly not doing anything. Awful memories flooded his head.
Ron tilted his head, thinking. “Was he in D.A.”
“Why so tense Potter? My father and I have a bet you see, I don’t think you're going to last ten minutes in this Tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last five!”
They appeared on a grassy hillside. The wind was whipping and Draco knew that his hair would be a mess after this.
Being careful not to show his disappointment Draco said, “Whatever floats your boat Potter, I’ll wait in the living room.”
“Malfoy?”
‘Did Harry just say what I think he said?’
“I just performed an Unforgivable on you, and you're still teasing me. Unbelievable.” Harry let out a shaky sigh. “Why must you be so difficult?”
Harry, not knowing what else to do, walked up the stairs to his dorm.
The bushy haired Gryffindor girl got everyone to sit in a circle on the pinwheel carpet, and she began.
Squeals of shock were made by almost everyone in the room.
“It’s not as if I don’t like this girl. I do. But as a friend. She- she can be a bit manipulative at times though. I fear that I will end up not happy with her. My father is convinced that she will be a good match. Except the more I think about it the more I know that I *don’t* want to be with her. But, if I refuse to marry her, I’ll get disowned. I really couldn’t care less about the family fortune, but there are rules and charms that bind me to the Malfoy name. If I don’t marry this girl, I won’t be able to contact my family again. And I couldn’t do that to my mother after everything she’s done for me. And the only way to not marry her, is to get my parents to undo the bond.”
“Or that duel in second year.”
“Just give him time, Hermione.”
“Hey ‘Mione, Ron. I need your help.”
“There is something else here…” Draco’s eyes widened, “But that’s impossible.”
Ron punched him in the shoulder, “Shut up Harry.”
No, not yet,
As I near his front door I hear voices from inside. Weird. He usually doesn’t have any visitors. And when he does, it's usually for a bad reason. I shudder at the memory of Aragog's burial.
She nodded, “Thanks for standing up for me. They’ve been doing that for a while.”
-Hermione’
But I can’t.
How would Malfoy react? Would he tell anyone? If he did, how would they react?
Harry thought about it for a moment then muttered, “Shit.”
“So you blasted a stunner at them? Such a smart move.” Malfoy’s tone was sarcastic, but Harry could tell he was grateful.
Dear Hermione,
He let a small smile slip on his face as he continued up the steps.
Harry glanced up from his book. Neville was standing there looking rather nervous.
“... Good morning to you too.” Harry grumbled.
“I’m sorry.” She said. “I thought you were someone else.”
Hermione rolls her eyes, exasperated, “Malfoy! You've been stalking him. And watching the Map for him. Ron’s told me. You've been up almost every night! Your grades are going to slip!”
“Yeah, but it’s kind of a tradition at this point.”
“Mother, I ate at the Ministry.” He lied.
So we hope to see you there! (Bring your boyfriend too!)
“Scared Pottah?”
Hermione and Ron followed Harry into his room. They all sat in a circle on Harry’s bed like they were 2nd years about to play Truth or Dare.
Krecher looked down at the parchment and then back up at Harry, “This is an ambitious cake, Master. And I can tell that it’s an original. But the directions here are perfect, how did you know how to make it?”
Harry put a hand on the door knob, but Draco put a hand on his shoulder.
He told his mom that he would hopefully not be back that night, and Flooed to Grimmauld Place.
“So Draco.” His father's voice snapped him from his trance. “How is it that you're working for the Ministry after all of the horrible things you've done?”
