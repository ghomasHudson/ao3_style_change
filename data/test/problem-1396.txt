getting worse. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you this morning that you haven’t been sleeping again. It’s not…”
The door slammed fully closed in Harry’s face, one of the metal bars on the small window colliding soundly with the bridge of his nose. As he leapt backwards, hands scrabbling to stymie the river of blood flowing from his nostrils, three deafening knocks resounded from the other side of the door.
Look, YOU’RE the one drunk messaging ME at all hours of the night looking for a shag!
Harry has never felt happier. He’s loved Draco for so long, and now,
Harry looked desperately into Draco’s clever, grey eyes, trying to read his response.

“Many people are frightened by handguns, and for good reason,” Potter said casually. The crowd was silent, hanging on his every word. As rehearsed, Potter and Malfoy slid out of their jackets at the same time and rolled up their sleeves. “There are four rules for handling a firearm that, if universally followed, would ensure no one was ever accidentally injured by a handgun again.” he finished.

--he thought, finally, he might sleep well. He was being gently lulled by hazy dreams of their future wedding and flashes of their friends’ faces until…
“Draco…” she rasped in the same, grating voice that had haunted Draco’s sleepless nights for nearly half his life.
“In fact, the men had already taken back their property, long before the kings set their watches that night,” Malfoy felt the right pocket of his jacket sag under a sudden weight. He tipped Potter a gentle wink as he handed over the four kings, then waved his free hand over the deck. Malfoy used both hands to fan the cards, face out. They were blank, every one. The audience began to murmur, ladies’ fans fluttered and men gestured with their now-empty glasses. “Your Grace, I believe this is yours?” Potter said, handing him the king of hearts.
“Yeah, Draco, don’t be such a buzzkill!” Harry echoes. You glare at him as you respond to Teddy.
“What changed?”

When he finally picks his way up the crumbling front steps, he finds that the stately front door is cracked open. From the look of it, the lock fell from the moist, rotting old wood at some point.
Malfoy produced three differently-colored felt-tip pens from his breast pocket. “If you please, choose a pen and write your three initials on the tip of the bullet–one on each side and one on the very tip,” Malfoy instructed, extending his arm so the wiry gentleman could also take a pen. “Write clearly and boldly, the next time you see those bullets you may be a little…out of sorts.”

Draco couldn’t move. He couldn’t even breathe. He had always known, in the back of his mind, that
“Well, first of all, I could never let you run off to a place like this without--”
Harry’s voice softened, “...I mean, is it the same as before? You said you’d taken care of that. If you pass out on me in this death trap I’m not hauling you out, I’m leaving you here to fend for yourself.”
Draco looked at him for a long time, eyes flitting over his face and his chest.
has been living here in a long time.
“You promised you weren’t going to pressure me, Harry,” Draco snaps as he drops their dinner plates into Harry’s sink with a clatter.
“Harry, where is this going?” you hiss as Scorpius climbs into your lap. Harry flaps the fingers of one hand at you dismissively, and you have half a mind to bite them.
, point a gun at anything…unless you intend to destroy it.” Potter finished, making eye contact with every audience member he could see.
“Fuck’s sake—” Harry hisses, beginning to pace across the hearthrug. “I know you don’t like me, you wish Draco were with someone else, whatever—can you
“The fourth king, however, thinks himself cleverest of them. He sets his guard on the roof of the palace.” Malfoy lifted the final card, the king of hearts, and placed it gently on the top of the deck before holding it out in front of the Duke’s chest “From his vantage point, he can see everything: the portcullis, the palace walls, the windows in the highest towers, the lands surrounding the palace. He will watch closely and raise an alarm as soon as he sees movement in the dark. He can gather his brethren so they can rain arrows, stones, and boiling fat down on the intruders before they ever breach the palace walls.”
“Without crossing,” Malfoy interjected, laying a length of rope down to bisect the stage where the little table stood, “this line.”
you looked in my bed, drinking tea in my kitchen, complaining about the way I sort my laundry. I wanted to ask you to move in, but I was terrified you would say no. We hadn’t even been dating for very long. But you just said it, like there was no other option. You said--”
oh my god
He handed the camera off to Harry so he could take his wand in hand and light it before turning the doorknob.
Pansy eyes him sharply over the rim of her rocks glass for a long moment. “No, I don’t think you do, really. Not the whole of it, at least.”
Stop doing that
“Well, who will volunteer?” Malfoy asked more quietly, his arms thrown wide, revolver pointing toward the ceiling. The room remained silent.
Who is this? I’m blocking this number. I’m going to ask Pansy how to block a number.
“A HOOK! HANGING FROM THE DOOR HANDLE!” Harry shouts.
Harry throws his hands up, frustrated. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“The third king knows that the treasure has been stored in the vaults on the top floor of the palace, he intends to set a guard there and catch the thieves red-handed.” Potter slid the king of diamonds into the deck just below the top.
Draco made a choked, watery sound. He was

explain why he’d turned up at Draco’s flat at 7 o’clock that morning, equipment bag in hand. At the time he told himself it was because he knew Draco needed the camera, but would never ask for it.
! You’re a presumptuous arsehole--take that five galleon word, eh?” Draco’s voice trembled, and Harry thought he might start crying. Instead, he turned away quickly to unpack one of the equipment cases.
“Oh, stop fussing, Draco. I’m an old lady I can do what I like,” comes Narcissa’s high-pitched, croaky voice.
For the love of Merlin

And for the record, I knew something was up. We may not be best mates or anything but I know you wouldn’t use emojis like that.

“What?”
Never pegged you as the type to get sloshed and text your ex-childhood-nemesis for a hookup
Harry leans over the little conjured flame, shadows playing across his face and his eyes glinting behind his glasses.
I…could do dinner.
“You think I don’t know that?”
And if you must know, Potter, I purchased a mobile years ago to stay in contact with my cousin, Teddy. Teddy Lupin. I think you’re acquainted? The little brat refuses to owl, apparently it’s “sooo medieval”.
“This is a story about time...and greed; about four kings driven by selfishness and consumed by avarice.” Potter paced the length of the stage with the four cards splayed in his hand, slowing here and there as an audience member leaned in for a closer look. He stopped to the left of the Duke.
The light from his wand only illuminated a three-foot radius, everything beyond that remained shrouded in shadow. Draco climbed the rickety staircase and paused on the last step, listening hard for any noise.
“Pans—”
The desperation and terror that had settled heavily in the pit of his stomach over the last three days bloomed, cold and urgent, up through his chest. His mind echoed with the muffled sound of his mother’s sobs--as if he were back at the Manor in the days after his father’s conviction, unsure of whether to enter his mother’s room to comfort her or leave her to grieve alone.
Draco, wait
Draco let Harry step close and place a hand on his cheek, but kept his eyes focused on the floor.
“Oh great, if I get stabbed by a squatter or crushed under a falling beam at least you’ll catch it all on film.”
Even Harry wasn’t too dense to connect the dots; the mere fact that they were still at it, years later, proved that Draco had yet to succeed.
He pushes the door open more fully and is with a wave of the thick, sickly-sweet scent of decay. His shocked brain finally jumpstarts into action. He jogs into the foyer, the clacking of his dress shoes muffled in the thick layer of dust on the floor. Despite the blood rushing in his ears and his short, wheezing breaths, he can hear the sounds of voices coming from a door down the hallway to his left. He recognizes one as Draco’s.
“We’re going to move a bullet from this side of the stage,” Potter said calmly, pointing to his right, “to that side of the stage,” he pointed to his left. “We’ll move a second bullet from this side of the stage,” he continued pointing to the left, “to that side of the stage,” he finished, swinging his finger back to his right.
bloody smart, and funny, and even when you’re in a foul mood you always remember to make my tea how I like and ask about my day. You’re my family, Draco. I’m sorry that I didn’t talk to you first.”
Potter and Malfoy paced around a small wooden table in the center of the stage, as if sizing each other up. They opened the chambers of their revolvers to show each other and the audience they were unloaded before setting them down on their respective sides of the table.
…among other reasons
“I’m hearing all sorts of noises right now. This is an old building, so of course it’s going to be creaking all over the place.”
Harry was interrupted by the sudden, high-pitched shriek of rusty door hinges. Draco froze where he stood and watched the door at the far end of the hall swing slowly open.
Harry backed Draco slowly out of the room, not turning to face him until he’d pulled the door firmly shut and secured it with a locking spell.
“What, love, afraid of the dark?” Harry teases against the nape of your neck.
can’t envision a future where we move into the Manor together.” He shivers involuntarily.
was must have moved on. He just felt tired...and happy.
Harry was thrown backward by the force of Draco’s incantation. He had to cover his eyes with his arm, the shine of it was so bright. When his eyes finally adjusted, he blinked owlishly into the face of a brilliant, silver stag.
“Oh no….ohhhhhh no, no,” Harry says, shaking his head and completely ignoring the unamused look on your face.
If Harry were honest, he’d tell Draco that he literally didn’t know what to do with himself at the weekend anymore if they didn’t have an investigation planned. If Harry were
Draco collapsed against the wall, sliding into a crouch. “I did, Harry. For a while, I did.” He said in a small voice. “That wasn’t really her, you know that.”
Harry sighed and scrubbed his face with a sweaty palm. “I know...I know that, love.’ Draco flinched at the easy term of endearment. “I’m here, aren’t I? I’ll always be here.”
Even though Draco had told Harry not to come back just three days ago, he hadn’t seemed surprised to see Harry when he opened his door that morning looking like hell, with deep, purple circles cradling his eyes. He had greeted Harry with a sleep-roughened grunt, taken the camera bag off of Harry’s shoulder, and barked some Apparition coordinates before turning on the spot. Harry hadn’t hesitated to follow.
“Leaving.”
As they walked back down the long, gravel drive that led up to the front door of the hospital, Draco stopped to take one last look.
, Harry?” Scorpius whispers, as if he’s trying to respect Harry’s request for silence but he
“Yeah, Scorp, the doors are locked, calm down you big baby!” Teddy teases.
” He shouted over the cacophony of boos, waving a revolver in the faces in the front row. His brows were pinched in anger, eyes glinting dangerously in the low lamplight. Potter reached slowly into his jacket for his own firearm and watched as the crowd shrank back. A gasp, then a hush fell over the room.
He opened his mouth to issue what was sure to be a clever and biting retort before a series of thumping noises echoed from a room halfway down the hall. Draco turned to look at Harry with his eyebrows raised.
“Well, fuck you, because I can make my own choices…” Draco said, tearfully, after a long moment.
Not drnk
The walls of the wide, cavernous attic were coated in an oozing, black slime shot through with what looked like veins, thick and pulsing. The grotesque web was punctuated every few meters by a twitching mass, an oozing sac that roiled and bubbled. They had stumbled into a Dementor colony.
He knew he was exhausted, and that his mind was likely playing tricks on him, but there in a window on the second floor was his mother. She was smiling, her cheeks rosy, one hand pressed to the locket she always wore--the one that held Draco’s picture.
“Oi! I don’t sound like that!” objects Teddy. You hit him with another well-aimed marshmallow.
Harry sighed and scrubbed his face with a sweaty palm. “I know...I know that, love.’ Draco flinched at the easy term of endearment. “I’m here, aren’t I? I’ll always be here.”
Merlin. Thanks.”
The light from Draco’s wand only illuminated a one-meter radius, everything beyond that remained shrouded in shadow. Draco stopped at the bottom of the staircase and closed his eyes, listening hard for any noise.
You roll your eyes, despite your still-leaping heart and rapid breathing, and jump as the lights flicker back on. The boys both groan in disappointment, but Scorp has one fist clenched around your wrist and the other still stuffed between his lips.

“Why?” asks Teddy.

Maybe it’s selfish, but I wanted to tell him that you’re happy, that in spite of his best efforts you’re,” Harry’s voice broke over the tears that were now spilling down his cheeks, “the most incredible person I’ve ever met. You’re kind,

“Scorp, for Merlin’s sake, don’t shout!” you say, wrapping your arms around his middle to urge him back to sitting. He stuffs one small fist in his mouth in what you know is a self-soothing gesture.
“Lumos…” Draco whispered as he stepped over the threshold.
“Why?” Draco whispered, and Harry’s heart broke.
that easy, Draco. Living with you, loving you--it’s always been that easy. You may be the most difficult human being in the world--” Draco batted his hand away with a grin on his face, and Harry continued, “but loving you is the easiest thing I’ve ever done. I’m so sorry I went behind your back.”
Harry can’t take it anymore. He takes a deep breath, sets his shoulders, and moves around the doorframe to face them.
Potter and Malfoy began to walk backwards, slowly, toward the vanishing cabinets. “As I mentioned, this story--like so many--is about greed.” Potter said loudly over the cheering audience, “More specifically, this story is about what happens to men so eaten up by greed that they no longer care who they hurt in their pursuit of power.” The king of hearts burst into flame in the Duke’s hand, drawing another collective gasp from the audience.
Apologetically, Draco L. Malfoy
Draco fell against the door, trying to see something, anything, through the small window. Harry had dropped his wand, plunging the room back into darkness, save for a faint, white glow coming from something that Draco couldn’t see.
“I wasn’t certain about your feelings, but I knew mine,” he replied with a blush. “It’s why I ate the apple. It was partly to piss off Umbridge, yeah, but I saw it and couldn’t stop thinking of you. It was practically taunting me throughout detention. You’re always snacking on them and you adore apple tarts and apple crumb cake. Anything apple, really. I can’t see the damn things without thinking of you,” he admitted shyly, forcing Draco to smother his pleased grin in his shoulder.
“Good,” Draco growled, relishing the way Harry arched into him, seeking,
“As you wish, Mother.”
protect you as I would any of my snakes. I will not treat you like a simpleton or dismiss your concerns as the Headmaster is wont to do. I will
“Do you think it’s —”
I introduced myself,” he asked casually, though his gaze was flinty.
The blond wasn’t what he expected—none of the Slytherins were—and no matter how difficult things were bound to be in the future, Harry wouldn’t change his new House placement. His cheeks flooded with heat when he flicked his eyes to the boy who remained staunchly by his side despite the madness that dogged his steps, inordinately grateful the surrounding ruckus hid the true cause of his embarrassment.
“You know, carbonated water is nothing new to wizards,” Draco smiled. “And this brand is French, which is where my family has its roots, so of course it’s a favourite of ours. Plus, seltzer is known to aid in digestion. Probably why Mother insisted the elves pack it since we’re swimming and eating at the same time.”
Severus paused outside the curtains when he noted the abnormal silence and cautiously peeked around the barrier in case they had a privacy spell in place. What he found broke his heart. Draco was curled protectively around the other boy, his aristocratic mask absent in the face of fear and uncertainty, while he consoled a trembling Harry.
“Thank you, sir.”
“Yeah, Theo. Thanks,” Harry said to the floor, missing the furious glare that passed between his friends. Tapping his shoulder to get his attention, Draco hovered a hand over it in question. Harry happily nodded his acceptance, letting the warmth from his palm chase away the lingering chill in his bones.
Tears glimmered in Draco’s stormy eyes when he croaked, “Be that as it may, I’m sorry. For that day in Malkins and every day since. You didn’t deserve any of it.” Gritting his teeth, he lowered his gaze to his lap. “You should’ve been here—where you belong. None of this shit with Weasley would’ve happened...we might’ve been friends sooner,” he whispered. “Fuck, Harry. I’m so terribly sorry.”
Theo nodded absently as the group of long-time friends chewed on his words. They knew there was more to the story, but they were also aware Draco scrupulously held his friends’ counsel. If Potter didn’t want them hearing the details, then it would never pass Draco’s lips. While it was a frustrating attribute, it was one they respected, considering they benefited from his reticence, too.
To be honest, Harry liked the idea of being the only person to see the private side of Draco. It made their bond more special to know they bared their souls for no one but each other.
Licking his lips nervously, Draco cupped his face with his free hand, memorizing the softness of his skin against his palm and the peaceful expression on his face, in case this was the last time he was granted permission to be this close.
The man in the portrait opened his mouth with a sneer, but she snapped her fingers and his hands flew to his neck as his tongue tied in a knot. “You will be silent until my Master wishes you free and you will be deaf since you cannot be trusted.” Teekey snapped again and his eyes widened in surprise when a thick layer of oil paint covered his ears.
“What form does it take?”
“Fraternitas,” Pansy whispered.
As the light washed over the page, it revealed Snapes’s spidery handwriting in lilac ink and Harry huffed a laugh at Slytherin ingenuity.
“Infirmary,” Fred mumbled while rubbing his neck. “I’ll take you there,” he offered, laying a hand on her shoulder.
“Fuck that,” Draco growled, wrapping his arms around him and anchoring himself to the moment. “I’m not about to let you die, Harry, Gryffindor or not. Despite rumours to the contrary, I’m not that callous.” Softening his tone, he murmured in his ear, “You’re not alone, remember?”
“Narcissa, even if such a match were advantageous to us, we couldn’t push for it. There are no magical guardians in Harry’s life who would sign papers for an alliance.”
When he regained the ability to speak a few moments later, Harry whispered, “I still have it. The button from the Cup.” Draco’s eyes shined brightly and his mouth curved into a small smile. “If anyone asked me at the time why I kept it, I couldn’t have given them an answer. But every time I picked it up, I saw your fear and heard the plea in your voice, and I...couldn’t throw it away. When I saw you on the far edge of the platform at the start of term, I realized I kept it because I was sure it’d be the only token of yours I’d ever have.”
“I certainly would,” Draco quipped with an impish grin.
“About as well as one who’s been utterly abandoned by his adopted family can be,” Draco said, raking a hand through his hair with a sigh. “I managed to get him to rest for the entire afternoon and he ate well at dinner.” Severus’ lips twitched with the reminder of his Slytherins fawning over the boy, piling his plate with food and topping off his juice when he wasn’t looking.
Nodding crisply at his insistence, she flicked her wand to seal the scroll and sent it whizzing to her office. “I’ve locked it in the safe with my other highly personal case files.” Pinning the man with a stern glare, she whispered, “I imagine you have a plan?”
“Salazar,” Pansy gasped. “What have they done to him?”
Grey eyes sparkled with mischief and Harry sagged in relief as the world righted itself in the teasing curve of his lips.
Reaching in his pocket, Harry pulled out a shimmery cloth that with a muttered
“Obviously,” Blaise snarked, earning a round of muted laughter, forcing Harry to cover his mouth to keep a snort at bay.
him—faults and all—and still cradled him as though he were something precious. Brilliant Draco with his barbed tongue and fierce loyalty, gorgeous Draco who rivalled him for power, staring at plain, broken Harry like he was worth his time.
Once Dumbledore disappeared, Harry called for Dobby and requested he bring anything Draco needed without being seen. Moments later, everything of import was shrunk down and shoved in his messenger bag.
His giant ears flopped when he nodded. “Yes, Harry Potter is a good friend to Dobby. Dobby is a free elf, but I is liking to work. The Headmaster is taking me in and giving me a job.”
Rubbing his hands over his face in frustration, Severus levelled Draco with an intense glower. “Find Potter. We must fix this. Extend your offer of protection, else he’s liable to waste away into despondency and die before the first task.”
“May I ask why?”
“You’re welcome,” she smiled. Tilting her head in entreaty, she asked, “Would you like me to go with you?”
“You’re right,” Draco grinned broadly. “That’s definitely us.”
A few days ago Harry would’ve said yes, but now Snape knew more about him than anyone besides Draco, and he didn’t feel comfortable sharing his sordid history with Molly Weasley or Professor McGonagall. Snape supported his wish for a re-sort and stood toe-to-toe with Dumbledore to make it a reality. After agreeing to set aside their differences, he realized he no longer hated the man, and like the other Slytherins, he trusted him to do what he could to guard his secrets.
“No, but I might, if Father has anything to say about it,” he spat bitterly.
“Buff,” Cedric replied with obvious amusement.
Harry winced as longing sliced through his heart like a knife. Much as he disliked the potions master, he understood the bond between godfather and godson and he wouldn’t stand in the way of Draco’s relationships. Except Lucius, of course; that one he planned to set alight.
“All of my friends are from prominent families,” Draco said. “Our parents decided when we were young to set us up on play dates, but we weren’t actually allowed to play. Instead, we took etiquette and dance lessons with tutors who rapped our knuckles anytime we giggled.
“Because I had to keep up appearances,” Draco explained with a grimace. “Everything gets back to Father, in the end. But I can’t do it, Potter, I can’t. Not after what I’ve seen. I won’t be them. I won’t be like...him.” They shivered, imagining the horrible things Draco would be forced to do if he followed in Lucius’ footsteps.
“What would you suggest?”
With a spin and a crack the couple disappeared, leaving a hall of cheering students and stunned adults in their wake. Neville and Hermione high-fived, Dean slipped Seamus a handful of Sickles, and Luna giggled as the Weasley twins squished her in an exuberant hug. Ron blinked at his friends, wondering if they’d all gone mad, and Hermione rolled her eyes.
“Fine,” Fred grumbled in defeat. “We used the poison apple idea from Snow White. The difference is our combined potion-spelled apple attaches to a person’s magical core. The only way to wake our boy up is to have his true love kiss him.”
“I offered him Sanctuary first,” Draco said, a jolt of satisfaction zinging through him at the Hufflepuff’s sharp look. “The re-sorting was something we stumbled on and took advantage of, but it wasn’t planned.”
“Tea?” he asked. Draco nearly declined, but noticing the tension coiled in the boy’s shoulders, he decided a bracing cup after his scare wouldn’t go amiss.
“Shit,” Goyle muttered. “Dark magic, you mean? One of the old patriots looking to settle a score?”
3 years - sprained wrist (R) [untreated]
“You can and you will,” Narcissa hissed. “We have magic, for Merlin’s sake! Your precious legacy isn’t in danger, but Draco’s heart is. Hasn’t our family been punished enough for one lifetime? Would you truly subject your son to an arranged marriage that will make him miserable? I believe we owe to future generations the freedom to take hold of happiness with both hands.”
Forcing down the bile rising in his throat, Ron murmured, “You could be right. It might be someone we’d never expect or worse, he’s not in love with anyone, at all. But have you considered those closest to him?”
Bobbing into a quick curtsy, she said, “Because they respect Master too much for his care of Slytherin House to undo his orders, sir. They know your actions are to protect, not harm.”
Lowering his gaze to escape Draco’s soft expression with a hushed word of thanks, Harry broke through the crust and brought a bite of the custard underneath to his lips.
loves.”
“I’m so sorry, my dear,” McGonagall said, voice wavering with heartbreak. Hadn’t her students suffered enough? Would it never end? “Nothing I say will ever make it better, and my words seem paltry at best, but I am so very sorry. I’m here if you ever need to talk, Ms. Chang. Day or night, my office is always open.”
“Thank, Merlin,” Draco sighed before their lips met in a tender kiss. It said far more than either of them were willing to admit. Later, perhaps, but not yet. They parted after a few moments but didn’t go far, resting their foreheads together as their combined magic thrummed with contentment.
“With me.” Severus bit his cheek as Draco floundered when he realized how that statement could be misconstrued. “Not like that! Merlin’s arse! Why does everyone automatically assume…”
Soft grey eyes met his when slender fingers wrapped around his hand in a strong grip. Harry’s cheeks instantly pinked and his heart flew into his throat with the alarming revelation that he enjoyed Draco’s larger palm swallowing his hand.
“Give them hell for me, darling. I expect to hear all the details when you boys return.”
A humourless laugh escaped him as he sat up and raked his hands through his chin-length hair. “My apologies,” he said, addressing the far wall instead of his students. “I live with constant regret, though I fear some guilt is eternal.”
A flurry of hexes flew his way, but Draco flicked his wand almost lazily, casting an impressive shield as the others encircled him while Crabbe maintained a shield at their backs. Harry gaped at their proficiency before guilt settled like a boulder in his gut with the realization he was partly responsible for their well-practiced defence tactics.
Shoulders slumping in relief, Harry joked weakly, “Oh, good. I have one person on my side, but I’ll take it.”
Colin squeaked and hurried away, deciding that as Harry had an escort, his presence was no longer needed. Draco and Harry nodded to their scowling professor as they exited, wincing when the door slammed behind them.
“Yes, sir,” Theo said, heading straight to the dungeons.
“Hello, handsome. Long time no see, eh? I’m not sure I ever thanked you for crying on me in the Chamber.” Fawkes’ bell-like trill echoed off the stone walls, pulling a bright laugh from Harry. “Oh, I did? Well, it can’t hurt to hear it again. Thank you for keeping me alive. I’d have died without you,” he murmured, clearing his throat to disguise the catch in his voice.
“How do we do that?” Harry asked.
‘Our friends….nothing will happen to you.’ The sincerity of the promise played on repeat in Harry’s brain, allaying his fear as he stared at the floor and prepared himself for whatever came next.
Extending her hand, she said, “It has been an honour and a privilege to be your Head of House. I am sad to see you go, but I believe the Hat was correct. You will make a fine addition to Slytherin House and I wish you all the best there. Please know you can still come to me with anything, day or night. Unfortunately, I have business to attend to in Gryffindor Tower, so I relinquish you into Professor Snape’s capable hands.”
“Mr. Malfoy,” Severus intoned gravely behind him. Draco smothered a groan as the man’s presence brought his rushed decision to track down the lost boy to a halt.
With a sigh, he closed the boy’s curtains and returned to his bed. The others watched him intently as he fluffed his pillow and adjusted the sheets to his liking, patiently waiting for whatever bone he might throw them. Sliding his wand from under his pillow, he swallowed hard and flicked sad grey eyes to his friends.
The silence that welcomed him was deafening, and he knew without lifting his eyes from the floor he was the topic of conversation. Crossing the room, he took the stairs to the boy’s dorms two at a time with a chorus of jeers behind him. Stepping into his dorm room, he looked up and gulped as the four boys he roomed with pinned him under a unified glare.
Scoffing slightly, Draco said, “Of course I was. What’s the point of saving your arse only to find you keeled over in the castle kitchens a few months later? I mean, honestly Potter, where’s the ingenuity?”
Without waiting for an answer, Draco steered Harry to the bed and conjured a glass, filling it with an
Groaning as his cheeks flamed, Draco buried his face in Harry’s neck. “Shut up,” he groused. “I’m gay and you’re my soulmate. Obviously, I think you’re cute.”
“Alright there, mate?” He kept his voice light, but Harry could see the worry creasing his eyes.
Huffing a weak laugh, Draco cautiously straightened as the wave of nausea passed. “No. I just…” Closing his mouth with a snap, he spun on his heel and presented his back to regain his composure. “I won’t be like him,” Draco gritted out.
As they crested the dimly lit stairwell to the main level, Harry breathed deeply and straightened his posture to give the illusion of confidence. However, by the time they reached the third-floor turret belonging to the Headmaster, maintaining the façade had become a challenge.
with my actions, things do not go well for me.”
“First, I think I speak for all of us when I say we’ve all been pricks. There are no blameless parties in this room, so if you can forgive us, then of course, we forgive you. Second, it’s Gryffindor’s loss. If they can’t decide whether they prefer The Boy Who Lived rather than who you are, then they don’t deserve you. Third, what the bloody hell do you mean you
Draco and Theo shared a wild glance before diving for their trunks and pulling out two battered copies of Hogwarts: A History. Barking a startled laugh at the irony of the situation, Harry freed himself from Pansy’s embrace and stumbled to his bed as they furiously scanned the pages.
The Slytherins listened with rapt fascination as he described their world through Muggle-raised eyes. As the only life they’d ever known, it dawned on the purebloods how much they took for granted.
“Why do you hate him? Harry, I mean,” Draco asked. “You hated him before you even met him. At least I had the decency to start a feud
They stripped down to their pants and dove off the bank into the crystal clear water. When they broke the surface, Dobby was laying out an assortment of sandwiches and pastries and chilled Perrier. Swimming to the bank, Harry selected an orange-flavoured water while Draco chose lemon to go with the club sandwich they split.
“Scared,
He shook his head and sputtered, “I can’t take this from you.”
, but not pitied.
All eyes turned to him as he settled at his new House’s table, but Harry remained outwardly unruffled as he filled his plate and buttered his toast. He was a Slytherin. He had an image to uphold, and with his friends supporting him, he would weather the storm.
Moste - ME spelling of “most”
Draco followed him as far as the entryway and propped on the doorjamb, narrowing his eyes warningly to anyone who passed Harry as he slipped into the bathroom. When he glanced toward the commons, it did not surprise him to find the lads and Pansy huddled at the mouth of the hall.
“Draco,” he huffed, “you should know by now that I gladly give my all to those I care about, and despite our history, I’ve always had a soft spot for you. If it’s within my power to grant, it’s yours. And guaranteeing you and your family protection is one of those things.”
“Harry,” Severus said, calmly turning to the speechless boy. “Is there anyone you would prefer to replace me as your guardian?”
“Draco,” he said hoarsely, a small smile tugging his lips.
Slipping his hands under Draco’s shirt, Harry tossed him a grin in all its lopsided glory. Draco’s lungs stilled in the face of his signature smile, the one the Golden Boy only bestowed on his friends, while large, calloused palms mapped his torso with something that could only be called reverence. Sweet Salazar, this man would kill him yet.
In a hazy part of his brain, he heard a soft voice counting his breaths and felt thumbs rub soothing circles on his biceps. It slowly drew him from his near panic and brought the room into focus once more. Blinking dazedly at Draco’s concerned face, he smiled faintly as his vision cleared.
Snorting quietly, Draco replied, “Yes, Father was livid. He ranted about losing Dobby for months after. It was a stroke of genius, actually. Cheers,” he toasted with a smirk.
She stepped back with a pat on his cheek and a hushed promise to see him in the morning. Bobbing her head goodnight to the other boys, she spun on her heel and headed toward the girls’ dormitories. Blessedly, Crabbe and Goyle followed her lead and left the roommates to their own devices.
“You’ll walk in with me,” Draco said, his voice unruffled despite the rosy tint high on his cheeks. “A united front. They won’t believe it if they don’t see it. Just remember: they’re all talk, so don’t listen to a whit of it. Our friends will be right behind us. Nothing will happen to you, Harry, I swear.”
Harry’s cheeks warmed from the safety of the bed in reaction to his unwavering protection. No, he didn’t regret allying with the Slytherins, specifically with the blond Prince.
Pansy gasped audibly while the boys let fly a truly incredible array of curses under their breaths. From the corner of his eye, Harry saw the incensed glare Draco shot his godfather and didn’t protest when cool fingers tangled with his in support.
From his periphery, Harry watched the blond become more animated as he discussed the pros and cons of each plant, marvelling at his intelligence and ability to pull an almost-smile from Snape as he argued his point.
The Gryffindor patch on his school jumper instantly changed to a silver snake on a green background and he sagged in relief. Severus removed the hat with a smirk, his dark eyes shining with approval when Harry mouthed his thanks. Theo stuck out his hand with a grin but huffed out a chuckle when Harry tugged him close and clapped him on the back.
“Harry will be staying in the Slytherin dorms this weekend with Blaise, Theo, and I, but he’s rather tired. Would you mind fetching him some comfortable clothes and pajamas for a few days and bringing them to my room?”
. That’s a hard line. I swear to Merlin if one of you tossers loses your temper with him, you’ll answer to me,” he growled. “Don’t loom over him or act threatening: no raised fists or hands that give the impression you’re about to strike him. Don’t touch him unexpectedly; he might punch you on reflex and spend the rest of his life apologizing for it. Don’t surprise him from behind for the same reason.”
“Of course, Professor. Thank you for everything and for supporting me on this,” Harry said thickly, squeezing her fingers to convey all the things he couldn’t say. She patted the back of his hand with a sad smile before releasing him.
A prod to his back told him he’d stayed silent for too long as he waffled on how to respond.
“I shouldn’t have to tell you both to see the Headmaster immediately,” she snapped. With curt nods, they shuffled out the door.
Clicking his tongue, Draco replied, “No, I don’t mind or I wouldn’t have offered. And neither will the others. You’re one of us now.”
Pansy squeezed next to him in the centre of the circle and slid a plain leather bracelet onto his wrist with a cutting smile. “It’s imbued with shield and misdirection charms. Nothing people throw your way will hit you. Wear it day and night, darling.”
“On my honour, sir.” Moody's magical eye rolled with his scoff and Draco stiffened. “On my
Frowning slightly, she asked, “Well, who would be his type, then?”
Unwight - Middle English word meaning “Grotesque, frightful”
Snape caught the outraged expression on Harry’s face and mentally congratulated him for putting the pieces together.
His empty plate disappeared, but before Harry could reach for any pudding, Draco passed him a ramekin and a dessert spoon with a warm smile. “If you liked the gravy, you’ll love this. It’s not treacle, but I dare say it’s better.”
“You can wait outside then, boy,” Moody said, pointing his gnarled wand at the door. “We can’t have you spying and reporting back to your
Wearily pinching the bridge of his nose, he continued, “Yet, Potter has proven time and again that he is not his father. He is undoubtedly arrogant, but no more than you or I. And now, knowing what I do of his life before Hogwarts, I can’t find it in me to dislike the boy any longer.”
“Thank you, Minerva,” she replied with a tired smile. “I’ll keep trying.”
Swearing colourfully in frustration, Harry shook his head and removed his hands, leaving scorch marks on his skin. “No, baby. Not here. Fuck, I want you, but I’m not letting our first time happen in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.”
“Yes, Master Snape. Headmaster Dumbledore is informed of everything about young Harry.”
By midday, the entire school heard the story of Harry swiping Umbridge’s apple from her desk after his detention and collapsing outside the DADA classroom with the first bite. Padma Patil found him during her Prefect rounds and immediately levitated him to the infirmary, running into the Weasley twins on the way, who realized their mistake and bolted to Gryffindor Tower.
list every character. I will mark Ron and Dumbledore, but I personally hate flooding tags with unnecessary anecdotes, so I will not be playing that game.
Sighing heavily, Draco lowered his gaze and flicked an imaginary piece of lint off his trousers, wondering how forthright he should be. “I believe you, you know...about the Dark Lord and all the times you’ve faced him. This summer was merely a taste of what’s coming and despite my attitude over the years, I don’t believe all that blood supremacy nonsense. Not anymore, at any rate.” Swallowing hard, Draco peeked at him and fidgeted under his scrutiny.
“Slytherin is constantly misrepresented, but let me remind you that the other Houses do not hold a monopoly on loyalty, chivalry, and creativity because they are found in abundance among us. Nor are cunning and ambition character flaws, but we are not so one-dimensional, either. Slytherins are determined, clever, and resourceful, but most of all, we are adaptable. Never forget: Slytherin belongs to Hogwarts as much as Potter belongs to us.”
Dumbledore sat perched at his desk as though expecting them, which, considering his extensive spy network in the castle, didn’t surprise Harry.
“Yes. Dobby is paid for his service.”
Cursing his fair complexion as his cheeks grew hot under Harry’s piercing gaze, Draco huffed a weak laugh. “Yes, seems so.”
“Good evening, young masters. Teekey is here with Harry’s potions. Where should I be putting them?”
Gritting his teeth as she returned to her fawning friends, he caught a flash of platinum blond hair ducking out of the Great Hall and crowed to himself in triumph. Turning tail and running as soon as he laid eyes on the formerly cursed girl standing healthy and hale spoke of a man with a guilty conscience.
Their professor nodded gravely. “I met Lily as a child before Hogwarts. I was the one who explained the ‘weird’ things happening around her were magic. I told her she was special and shouldn’t listen to the cruel things her sister said.”
The room was square and spacious, if a bit chilly being subterranean. A bookshelf crammed with tomes and crumpled parchment lined the back wall, but the rest of the chamber was immaculate. There were only four poster beds, as opposed to five in the Gryffindor dorms, but Slytherin was the smallest house, so that wasn’t surprising. The beds were also larger owing to the additional space, Harry noted with a twinge of jealousy. Yet, while there was an even number of beds, there were only three silver nameplates: Zabini, Nott, and Malfoy.
Malfoy was going through the motions, but his spark was missing. She was fairly certain it matched the description of a green-eyed boy in the infirmary, likely dreaming of blond hair and sarcastic witticisms.
Her eyes shone with excitement. “Like Sirius’s mirror?” Harry flinched, and she instantly became contrite, but he waved away her apology. Studying the coins as she considered the options, she finally nodded in satisfaction.
suggesting an alliance with Potter for practicality’s sake and nothing else?” Draco’s fair skin turned scarlet and Severus smirked. “I thought not, though your true motivation matters little. He’s an honorary snake and we take care of our own.”
House the Sorting Hat meant to place Potter when he sat on the stool in the Great Hall, but Dumbledore’s bias (in the form of one Hagrid and a passel of Weasleys) prevented from the onset.
“If your editor asks, tell them his official response is ‘no comment.’ Now, if you’ll excuse us, we have a class to attend.” Closing ranks around the newest Slytherin, they hustled through the hall to the potions lab.
“Welcome to Slytherin,” Theo chirped as he exited the showers in a towel. Snatching his wand from a nearby cubby, he cast a drying charm on himself and set about getting dressed.
“It doesn’t matter,” he whispered, tears streaking across his gaunt features. “He’s going to kill me and my parents for failing my task. It’s intentionally impossible. He means for me to die, to punish my father before he destroys us; to show his followers what he will do to any who disappoint him.”
“Smothering you is how they show they care,” Blaise winked.
When they reached the gargoyle guarding the Headmaster’s office, Harry gave the password and hesitated when the wall opened so Draco could slide around him. As the wall closed, leaving them on the curved stairwell glowing with soft torchlight, Draco removed the cloak and passed it silently to the man behind him. Instead of taking the offering, Harry wrapped his hand around Draco’s with a pensive expression. Squeezing Harry’s fingers briefly as he pressed the silky fabric into his palm, Draco hastened up the stairs, blood pounding in his ears.
Besides, it wasn’t simply vanity for vanity’s sake. It was about taking pride in one’s appearance and controlling one’s perception to the world at large. Harry’s makeover on his first night as an honorary snake was no different. It was a message of superiority and nonchalance to those who believed the lies about him churning the rumour mill.
Chuckling softly, Harry tipped his head toward Draco. The elf’s eyes widened comically when he recognized him, but Harry laid a gentle hand on his bony arm. “He’s a friend, Dobby. Would you mind getting us some tea, please?”
He startled when her voice cracked, and he realized she was crying. “Mione, it’ll be alright —”
“Dinner is in four hours and I expect each of you to represent Slytherin House with all the prestige afforded to it,” Snape warned. No sooner had the affirmatives left their mouths than he nodded curtly. “Then I shall take my leave.”
“Let me help you, Draco,” Myrtle pleaded outside of Harry’s line of sight. “You can talk to me.”
Harry nuzzled their noses, earning a chuckle from Draco. “Boyfriends?”
A stunning blonde girl in powder blue stood with a smile to loud applause. Hermione rolled her eyes as most of the male population watched her cross the hall to stand in front of Madam Maxine.
Draco attempted a reassuring smile, but it was more of a grimace, though Harry appreciated the effort. “It’s...not great, but if Uncle Sev has a plan, then it isn’t unsolvable. We’ll see what he has to say about it when we get to his room.”
Rolling his eyes, he waved them away when the bathroom door opened. It was a testament to their cunning that none of them left, instead casting disillusionment charms on themselves. He didn’t bother laying into them about their blatant eavesdropping since he wasn’t planning to sate their curiosity.
“Harry, I must ask you to leave now. I can’t reveal Draco’s location to anyone if we’re to keep him safe from Voldemort,” Dumbledore said.
The distraught boy on the couch with him was not the same one who spent three years insulting him or bought his way onto the Quidditch team to taunt him in the air. This boy was heartbroken and riddled with guilt for the lost opportunities between them. It was a sentiment Harry shared.
“All this time, I thought Harry had everything,” Draco croaked. “That he basked in fame and sought it out, but none of it was true. He slept in a bloody cupboard for eleven years! I was so wrong and I don’t know how to amend my mistakes,” he finished despairingly.
Please, leave kudos and comments! They give me life and encouragement to keep the story alive!! Love you guys! Thanks for reading!!
He looked at each of the Champions and none of them missed the regret shadowing his gaze. Guilt weighed heavily on the three wixen for their hasty judgement of the younger boy the night of the Feast.
He rolled his shoulders casually, but she could see the tension in them and knew she’d have to tread carefully. “Well, you were right about me, perhaps. Can’t say for sure if Potter feels the same,” he admitted softly.
“Oh, yeah? Enlighten me, Oh Gracious Protector,” Harry said with a mocking bow.
“Professor Snape, what is the meaning of this?” she demanded.
The offer was a balm for his soul. Draco hadn’t realized how much he wished Harry would come to his rescue until the possibility stretched before him. It seemed ludicrous to expect the Chosen One to give a damn about him, much less return his deeply buried affections. It was a childish dream that crossed his mind only in the safety of his subconscious, kept under lock and key behind impenetrable Occlumency shields. Yet, it didn’t seem quite so impossible as he drank the earnestness in the stubborn Gryffindor's gaze like a man dying of thirst.
“Of course,” he agreed. “You’ll be the first to know once it’s handled.”
Stomping to Fred, Ginny demanded, “So
He had no answers, but he had plenty of hurt and resentment to spur his tongue into action.
“Thanks. I appreciate it.”
for you, Harry, as I should have from the start. You are Lily’s son, the only piece of her left in this world, and I promise not to let either of you down again. I hope you can forgive me in time, but if not, I at least hope you can trust me.”
Shaking out the shimmering fabric with a smile, Harry held it open in invitation. “Now come on. Let’s get going. The sooner the better, yeah?”
Pansy’s brow furrowed quizzically when she followed his eyes. “What’s all that about?”
In a furious swirl of his robes, Snape rounded on the Gryffindor with a hiss. “Are you telling me how to handle my Slytherins, Mr. Creevey?” The boy blanched and fervently shook his head, suddenly incapable of speech. “You would do well to remember that Potter is one of mine now and, as such, follows my House edicts. Get out of my sight before your disrespect lands you in detention with me for the foreseeable future.”
” performed by the “
“I’m not letting you go in alone,” Draco murmured with a gentle squeeze. “Unless you don’t want me to, of course.”
“Oh, shit,” Crabbe mumbled.
Severus tipped his head formally but didn’t conceal his tiny smile. “Quite alright, Ms. Parkinson. You needn’t hide in here.”
“How is Potter doing?” he asked carefully.
“Long enough to know you thought I was dead and seemed genuinely concerned about it,” Harry said as he sat up and adjusted his glasses.
“He isn’t normally,” Draco said, remembering Harry’s previously blasé attitude in the quidditch locker rooms whenever the teams switched possession of the pitch for practice. He hadn’t been one to display his own body, but he hadn’t been bothered by the nudity of his fellows, either. “Something’s wrong.”
“Wait here while I fetch Madam Pomfrey,” he ordered.
Smiling gently to her friend, Hermione said, “Come along, Gin. I’ll take you to Harry, okay?”
They shared a chuckle at the apt description.
“It’s just a general health exam,” Draco said, abruptly reminding him where they were and why. “Uncle Sev and I can either stay or go, but it’s pretty basic and I swear it doesn’t hurt. Madam Pomfrey is simply going to run a few medical scans and we’ll head back to the common room, okay?”
Rolling his eyes in irritation, he said, “A room that only appears when you need it and provides whatever you ask for. Hence, its other name, the Room of Requirement.”
Harry launched out of the curtains and scooped Pansy in a tight hug with a wet chuckle. She buried her face in his neck, dampening his collar with her tears as the others hesitantly shuffled closer. He waved them to join, and they wrapped the duo in a group hug with wobbly smiles and murmured reassurances. Catching Draco’s eye over Pansy’s shoulder, he mouthed his thanks and basked in the brilliance of his smile.
“Nor do I,” Fleur said as she strode toward them on long legs. Draco bowed and kissed the hand she presented before the witch linked their arms together and waved Harry to follow. “Come, cousin. Must you always make a scene wherever you go?”
Fleur smiled genially at Draco. “Not by blood. The Malfoy line was originally French and somewhere in the 1600s, the Delacour's called upon the Malfoi’s still in France for aid against a rogue sorcerer who nearly revealed the existence of our world to the Holy Roman Empire. They swore a family pact and promised to never raise wand or blade against one another in return for their help. Naturally, the wizard was defeated and our secret was saved. When the Malfoi’s died out, my father’s family maintained our vow with the English line. We have been ‘cousins’ ever since, though we do not follow the tradition of marrying one another.”
“Yeah, or you could be like Ginny and be head over heels for the tosser and he won’t wake up if he doesn’t love you the same,” he shot back.
“Let’s think,” Ron said. “He’s athletic, so he’d probably want the same, right? I mean, Cho and Ginny are both Quidditch players.”
“Yeah, yeah, I’ll be fine.” Draco cocked a disbelieving brow and Harry blushed. “Okay, maybe I’m still a little shaken by our run-in with Skeeter. Honestly, I’m looking forward to heading to the common room after this meeting and doing
Whipping his head around to his godfather, Draco blurted, “Dumbledore is using the house-elves to spy on Harry, which means he
Walking Harry backward as he peppered reverent kisses along his neck, Draco hoisted him easily and perched him on a desk, slotting himself between his legs and resealing their lips.
Draco’s brows furrowed in confusion. The Old Ways promoted the balance of magic by ritually communing with the gods throughout the year. Love was love, no matter who you bedded. That Muggles would find men sleeping with men or women with women objectionable seemed ludicrous.
A rather insistent knock interrupted Severus mid-marking, and though he was grateful for the break from second year essays, he couldn’t fathom who would be demanding to see him at half eleven on a Sunday. When he opened his door he could say with certainty he hadn’t expected to find seven of his snakes crowding the hall.
Wow, okay. Draco was incredibly observant and scarily accurate with his assessment. Though Harry couldn’t help worrying how much of what he mentioned was from personal experience with Lucius or dealing with the other Slytherins’ unhappy backgrounds.
Harry gasped when the dragon on his chest beat its wings and roared, and Draco responded in kind as the phoenix trilled through the pulse of their bond. Taking the opportunity afforded him, Harry slipped his tongue into Draco’s open mouth. His knees almost buckled when they slid and curled together as though meant to, which he supposed as soulmates, they were.
Sighing heavily, she hung her head. “It pains me to ask such a thing, but it’s been nearly a week now and neither the cursebreaker nor Professor Snape has had any luck and Madam Pomfrey has run out of ideas. I waited a few days before approaching you after learning about, well…” she trailed off, cheeks pinking alongside Cho’s.
,” Theo hissed, leaning so far out of his armchair, he nearly toppled onto Blaise. “No wonder you fit in. You’re meant to be one of us.”
are true Slytherins and right now the safety of one of our own is at stake. We must close ranks. Do I make myself clear?”
A gentle hand rubbed his back, and he instinctively leaned into Draco’s grounding touch, his tense muscles unbunching under soothing fingers.
Blinking out of the haze of memories, Malfoy’s expression turned contemplative and Harry realized he’d been fiddling with a button of his uniform under his loose tie. Instead of sneering, the corner of Malfoy’s mouth curled in a faint smile, and he dipped his head in acknowledgement. Harry returned it with a lopsided grin before ducking his head to hide his flushed cheeks and rejoined the conversation taking place around him.
“Kitchens. Okay.” Draco cleared his throat hesitantly. “Where are they exactly?”
“Mmm, you did, darling. Though I’m inclined to forgive you since Harry is such a dear,” Pansy replied from her lounged position against Goyle’s broad chest.
“And you’re not?” Harry shot back.
“Yes, Master Snape?” she asked with a muted pop of apparition.
Taking the disheartening information in stride, he forced a lazy smile. “Well, there is a silver lining, if you think about it.” Draco smirked as he waited for the punchline. “I’ll just have to put your absurd height to use and make you reach the tall shelves for me. Hope you don’t mind,” he teased with a genuine grin.
Despite the bone-weary exhaustion making him feel decades older, it had been worth it. Glancing around the Great Hall, Harry took stock of how many of them survived the night. Though the casualties on their side had not been many, they’d lost good, brave people who could never be replaced.
“Thanks,” Harry murmured, rocking their knees under the table with a shy smile.
Picking up on his shift in mood, Draco set aside their drinks and turned to Harry with a quizzical expression. “What’s wrong?”
Cupping Draco’s cheek, Harry gently steered his face and felt guilt wash over him anew to see tears shimmering in his terrified eyes. “I’m so sorry he forced you to make that choice, but I understand completely why you did. I would have done the same in your shoes. You were protecting your mum, Draco; that’s commendable.”
“Alright, boys,” Dumbledore said, startling them from their embrace. “Tonight, Draco, you’ll go to a temporary safe house while we finalize arrangements for a permanent one. We should have everything sorted by tomorrow.”
Tossing back the last of his drink, Severus sighed, “What do you want to do about it? You know what’s expected of you.”
“Let me see that,” Draco whispered urgently.
Draco might physically resemble his father and (seemingly) reflect his values, yet at his core, he could not be more different. Harry wanted to study each of Draco’s facets and learn who he was under the pureblood polish. He had a long history of observing him, but he hadn’t realized in what capacity he truly desired to know Draco until recently.
since they don’t hold your heart.” Exhaling raggedly, he choked, “I’m certain I don’t either. I definitely don’t deserve to. There is an entire castle of those far worthier and I’m terrified of getting my hopes up only to see them dashed, but I have a massive chink in my armor when it comes to you. So, here I am.”
“No idea,” Harry said. Deciding to put the professors’ strange behaviour from his mind, he focused on his coq au vin and his housemates, determined to enjoy the good food and even better company on his first (secret) night as a Slytherin.
“Please, Mione,” he scoffed. “Even if Harry is into blokes— which yeah, I can see that, and no, I don’t give a shit —I wouldn’t be his type.”
Draco’s mouth fell open as he mentally worked out the probability of success while Snape assessed Harry shrewdly. “Mr. Potter, I’m tempted to award you House points for that brilliant suggestion which, frankly, I once believed you incapable of. However, I don’t wish to grant Gryffindor any points for their current treatment of you, I’m afraid.”
“Please,” Draco whispered.
“Right away, young Malfoy, sir!”
“Thank you, sir,” they chorused, happily falling in behind their professor as he strode purposefully out of the Headmaster’s turret.
Harry held his gaze with an intensity that should’ve been terrifying, yet felt oddly comforting. “Yes, I will. Though I won’t lie, your loyalty and theirs might be suspect without a vow.
Draco nodded curtly in acknowledgment, though he still couldn’t meet Harry’s gaze. What if this was a figment of his imagination? A hallucination brought about by despair? He couldn’t bear to look up and find none of it was real.
With a choked cry, Harry clutched his shirt as though he was the last port in a storm, clinging desperately to him as his whole body shook under the force of his sobs. As his own eyes stung with heartsick tears, Draco held tight; a willing anchor against the maelstrom of emotion attempting to drown the boy in his arms.
Harry spread his hands with a bitter smile. “There isn’t one. If your name comes out of the Goblet, you’re magically bound to take part or you become a Squib. Period.”
Harry dipped his toast in egg yolk and took a bite, pointedly ignoring the gawking Hogwarts students and curious glances from the foreign guests.
“Says the man who takes twice as long on his bloody hair,” she tossed over her shoulder. Blaise and Theo followed the others with a wink to Draco, not so subtly giving the boys a moment alone.
“And intelligent,” she pointed out, causing Ron to shoot her another glance. “Stop it! Harry is not in love with me, for pity’s sake.”
“And? Can we?” Draco wondered, breathless with hope, yet taut with uncertainty.
“Good idea,” Severus agreed. Checking the time with another swish of his wand, he said, “It is late and you must return to the dorms to check on our guest. Where is he staying?”
Severus rapped his knuckles smartly against McGonagall’s door, swooping into the room with a self-important air when she bade them enter. She remained unfazed as the Slytherins filed into her room until she saw Harry sandwiched between them. Jumping from her chair in alarm, McGonagall sputtered when the letter was shoved unceremoniously in her face.
The tables groaned under the weight of a variety of dishes, including regional fare for their foreign guests. Blini and caviar, duck à l’Orange and gougères stood out amongst the less ostentatious shepherd's pie and Yorkshire pudding. Sharing an eager look, Harry and Ron wasted no time piling their plates with delicacies.
“Of course not,” she simpered, releasing Harry to bestow perfunctory kisses on Draco’s waiting cheeks. When it was Harry’s turn, however, she wrapped him in a tight hug and murmured, “Welcome to Slytherin, darling. Let me know if you ever need anything, and I do mean
“I need you to ward the portrait. My spells would be counteracted immediately, I fear, and my students’ desire to have a conversation in private.” Severus emphasized the last word and shot a scathing glare to the man whose calculating gaze hadn’t left Harry since his arrival.
Draco’s features pinched slightly and Harry was hit with an urge to kiss away the crease in his forehead. Instead, he pressed a cheek firmly into the palm resting on his face. “We’ve always been on opposite sides. I thought you were out of reach. I’m very glad that’s not the case,” Harry finished.
“Owing to Mr. Potter’s unique circumstances, I have changed the password.” With a flick of his wand, a crisp piece of parchment with the new password stuck itself to the message board. “I will personally change it weekly, as opposed to bi-weekly, for the time being. I also strongly advise
“But something strange happened when I told him I was coming to see you.” Draco studied him with calculating eyes. “I told him you were my godfather, and he shut down. I can’t figure out what caused his reaction, but I wonder if you might.”
He chuckled as he left the gobsmacked Prince to deal with his errant subjects and headed to the bathroom for a cold shower.
Anxiety thrummed in Harry’s veins as Draco’s grey eyes remained unfocused, the pupils mere pinpricks as he fought imaginary demons. All too familiar with panic attacks, Harry took one of his limp hands and pressed it over his heart.
Nodding slowly, he said, “Yes, you can show him. Thank you, Draco.”
Clearing his throat, Harry said, “Look, I have a meeting with Dumbledore right now. I’ll catch you in the common room afterward.” They nodded and offered him fleeting smiles as they turned to leave, but they hadn’t gone far before Harry snapped his fingers.
Immersing himself in his Charms homework, he then moved on to revising his History of Magic essay until it satisfied him before he lost himself in translating ancient runes. Double-checking his planner, he ticked off his completed assignments and reached for his Transfiguration book when the alarm sounded. Draco blinked out of his study session and verified the time with a flick of his wand, surprised by how rapidly the afternoon passed.
that we believed might help Harry with his predicament. It led to a discussion with Professor Snape and brought us here.”
“Yes, darling. You can count on us,” Pansy mumbled against his shirt. “If only there was a way for you to switch houses so you didn’t have to leave.”
Closing the gap between them, Draco traced Harry’s bottom lip with his thumb. “What did you want to know, Harry?”
An ear-piercing shriek rent the air and silenced the furor in the hall. Lowering his wand, Dumbledore rose from his place at the Head table with a serious expression.
“Good,” Severus said. “Once we’ve spoken to her, we will go to the Headmaster, but I will handle him. You do not have to answer any questions you do not wish to. It doesn’t matter how much he dislikes the idea of re-sorting you, it is your choice and we have precedent to support your decision.”
Harry blinked owlishly at everyone’s shocked expressions and ducked his head to hide his flaming cheeks. “I guess that’s not common, is it?” he whispered to Draco, peeking nervously over his knees.
Draco flashed him a roguish grin Harry couldn’t help returning as he watched aristocratic fingers work his platinum hair into a rakish quiff. Since summer, he’d moved past slicking his entire head into an immobile fixture, choosing to keep it short along the back and sides, but long on top. It was a sophisticated style that suited his angular features.
“Who else?” Draco huffed wryly as he thumbed gentle circles along his spine. “It’s always been you, Harry.”
Draco stretched his legs along the bed and crossed his ankles, shooting his bickering friends a smirk as he rubbed the excess lotion into his hands before leaning back on his elbows to allow it to sink in. His gaze shifted sideways and caught Harry nibbling his lip by the foot of his bed.
Patting her shoulder gently, she said, “Even if he doesn’t wake, I very much appreciate your willingness to help. It is more than we could hope for.”
“I didn’t feel safe,” he said, wringing his hands. “At that moment, Professor, I didn’t trust anyone in that room enough to sleep next to them in the dark. After I came down from my panic attack, I left the tower and roamed the castle. I ended up in the kitchens around three in the morning and slept on the floor there overnight.”
“No! Gods, no,” Harry exclaimed. “I didn’t mean it like that. I just wondered,” he cleared his throat, “how someone discovers they aren’t one hundred percent straight?” he asked timidly.
“I should wake him so he doesn’t miss dinner,” he replied woodenly. No one mentioned there were three hours until dinner as he swept out the door, leaving his friends with more questions than answers.
“Gods, yes. I’m sweltering,” he groused.
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose with a weary sigh. “Nothing like that. He was literally sleeping because the Gryffindors turned on him. He didn’t feel safe staying in the tower overnight and ended up somewhere less than hospitable. When I found him this morning, we started talking and called a truce. I granted him Sanctuary and insisted he come here to get some decent rest while I caught up on homework. By the way, Theo, I figured out that tricky bit from Ancient Runes. I’ll explain the translation later.”
Harry met him on the landing and gallantly held open the door, and he refrained from kissing the handsome idiot through sheer willpower. Stepping into the impressive abode, Draco gawked at the portraits of prior Head professors and magical artefacts displayed among the books and rich decor.
Sighing heavily, he nodded in understanding before pressing a lingering kiss to Draco’s cheek. “Take care of yourself. I’ll find you when it’s over,” Harry whispered.
He hung his head with a dejected sigh. He couldn’t say the information surprised him. After years of intermittent meals and subsisting on junk food stashed under the floorboards of his room during summer break, there wasn’t much chance of him catching up to the boys his age. Honestly, he expected worse.
“Which means we aren’t dealing with a student out to humiliate Harry. We know the tournament has a high mortality rate. He was targeted,” Draco continued, turning Harry’s blood to ice as his worst fears were confirmed. Another year, another person out to kill him. Merlin, couldn’t he catch a break?
“Perhaps,” she agreed. “In any case, I’ll not learn anything lollygagging. I’ll be in touch, Poppy.” Tapping her fingers lightly on her desk with a smile, McGonagall said, “Thank you for all that you’ve done and continue to do.”
They shook their heads.
When the couple emerged from the gardens, giggling and blushing with fingers entwined, Narcissa watched them cross the lawn from the second storey with a warm smile. Yes, the boys would be happy in this new age, without blood prejudice or antiquated ideals tarnishing their connection.
Nodding slowly, he said, “That’s fair. Of course, this is all moot if he doesn’t wake up, but I appreciate the advice, nonetheless.”
Draco’s expression was stern as he raised a finger and started ticking them off. “No yelling
“Like who?” Harry asked softly.
Yet, the more he thought about it, the less crazy it seemed. Draco despised the Boy Who Lived persona as much as he did (if not more, truthfully) and he sure as hell didn’t need Harry’s money.
They nodded as Draco swept out after him, catching him shoving textbooks and potion vials in his bag. Draco noticed there was already an empty vial in the first slot and choked down the bitter tang of sorrow and anger rising from his craw.
that’s not who you are, Draco.”
Harry blanched at the insinuation, and he waved his hands frantically. “Merlin, no! I don’t know how it happened. It wasn’t me. Why would I want to sign up for a suicidal tournament, anyway?”
Tutting sympathetically, Draco wrapped him in a hug, murmuring apologies and words of comfort in his ear as he sagged against his chest—tired and defeated. Draco’s heart clenched when his shirt dampened where Harry’s face rested and he buried his face in messy hair as he tightened his hold.
“...hear me?”
He shook his head frantically and glanced at his friends, only to find them all either glaring at him or the table. Swallowing hard, Harry stumbled off the bench at Hermione’s furious shove. Keeping his head down, he avoided the angry glowers of the other champions and their headteachers, completely blocking out the rest of Dumbledore’s speech in his stupor.
It took a few minutes, but eventually Harry’s breathing slowed and the fog blanketing his mind lifted. His senses gradually returned, and he used them to ground himself as they came. First, he focused on Draco’s patient counting, then the thumb rubbing circles along his knuckles, the spicy notes of expensive cologne and sharp antiseptic, the sour tang of fear in his mouth, and finally, when he opened his eyes, the warmth in heavenly grey.
Krum and Cedric shared an incredulous glance, but it was gone so quickly Harry couldn’t say for certain it ever took place.
“No, it makes sense,” Harry said thoughtfully, tossing him an impish glance over the china rim.
Lucius nearly scalded himself as his head swivelled to his wife in shock, watching aghast as she genteelly nibbled on a cress sandwich. “You did this without consulting me?”
A chorus of agreement echoed around the room, and Snape nodded in approval. Clasping his hands behind his back, his normally stony gaze glittered with intensity as he continued.
Harry hesitantly leaned toward the man and whispered, “Professor, are you alright?”
A faint scuff outside caught their attention and Draco jerked his head to the door with a wink. Harry waggled his eyebrows mischievously as the blond tiptoed to the centre of the room.
Exhaling sharply through his nose, Harry said, “Remember the day we met in Madam Malkins? That was my first time in Diagon. I’d only known about the existence of magic for maybe twelve hours. Everything was new and shiny and bright: pictures that moved, chocolate that hopped, goblins running a bank, and owl post! It was, for lack of a better word,
“Me?” Harry squeaked.
His steps faltered as she led him toward the curtained bed tucked at the back of the wing. Laying a gentle hand on his shoulder, she whispered, “I’ll leave you alone. I’ll be in Madam Pomfrey’s office if you need anything.”
Leaning back in her chair, Pomfrey shook her head sadly. “I nearly refused, because I hadn’t heard about the apple yet, but Ms. Granger said she was simply distraught and asked for a moment of privacy. I couldn’t deny the poor thing. Not two minutes later, she fled the ward in hysterics with Ms. Granger on her heels.”
Tilting his head up to compensate for the inch or two Draco had on him, Harry forgot to breathe for a moment as grey eyes turned dark when he dipped to meet him. His eyelids fell shut when sinewy arms wrapped around his back, and blood pounded in his ears when a puff of hot air fanned across his lips a split second before they touched.
Burrowing into his neck, Draco hid his smug grin. “Nor I you. We’re a team now, Harry. I’m afraid you’re stuck with me.”
“Hey! Nothing wrong with giving everyone a chance and wanting a fair game,” Harry protested.
Neither boy was stupid enough to argue as they crammed their books and parchment in their bags, but Colin didn’t have their good sense.
“Probably a good idea,” Theo said. “By the way, you’re officially our fourth roommate! I checked when I arrived,” he grinned.
As it was, everyone they came across on the lazy Sunday gave them a wide berth with Snape’s long stride leading the way, robes billowing in his wake. To outsiders, it looked as though the notoriously snide professor was leading Harry to his doom. He didn’t miss the nasty smirks and excited gossip spreading at the thought of Harry getting his comeuppance.
is to wander the hallways alone once this becomes public. Until our new housemate is familiar with our ways, I fully expect you all to provide information or guidance, as not all the Houses follow the old traditions.”
“Even though someone entered your name in a killer tournament to make it a reality?” Draco joked to distract from the rosy hue spreading under his collar.
Ron tugged his hair desperately as he poured over books with Hermione in the library. It had been two weeks since Harry ate that blasted apple and fallen into a sleep that even Bill couldn’t undo. Rubbing the heel of his palms against his eyes, he willed the tears not to fall. If he fell apart when he was supposed to be researching how to fix his brothers’ mess, they might never wake his best friend.
Draco smiled and muttered a muffling spell around them. The older teens shared a look and shuffled closer to better hear what he had to say.
“Oi! He’s not dead, you idiots!” Silence descended again and he cancelled the charm but made sure his voice carried through the room. “We’re not that stupid, you know. Merlin, give us some credit.”
His sharp features softened when he stroked Harry’s cheek. “Madam Malkins. I met a boy with wild hair and brilliant eyes and I was lost, but I didn’t realize what those traitorous feelings meant until fourth year.” He quirked a brow in silent question, and Harry chuckled.
Grabbing his favourite joggers and a loose t-shirt, Harry concealed the rush of conflicting emotions with a shrug.
Blaise flicked his wrist dismissively from the plush rug in front of the hearth. “You’ve had a lot on your mind, Draco.” Turning his head toward Harry, he said, “You’re welcome to stay here anytime and for as long as you want.”
on the desk before flying to Harry’s shoulder. Theo and Draco openly gawked at the Gryffindor when he casually scratched the phoenix’s head, who ruffled its plumage and crooned in greeting.
“Because I’m the Chosen One, and you’re the brains behind the trademark scar,” Harry snickered as Ron rejoined them with a snort.
Did all childhood enemies study one another with the same single-mindedness? The Gryffindors would have found the revelation of Draco’s interest horrifying, yet discovering he ranked so high on the Slytherin’s radar had the opposite effect on him.
“You’re alive, you’re alive. Thank fuck, you’re alive,” Draco murmured thickly.
“Holy
Harry chewed his lip as his perception of the brusque Slytherin shifted further. In light of Draco’s confession, he understood why he acted the way he did. Why he tried to mould himself into his father’s idea of the perfect Malfoy to avoid the man’s wrath.
“Harry,” he corrected, glancing at each of them in turn. “Call me Harry.” The cadre of Slytherins grinned as they introduced themselves, and he felt a weight fall off his shoulders.
“I don’t hate Potter,” he bristled. His godson arched a disbelieving brow, and he regretted ever teaching him the art. Sinking into his chair with a tired sigh, Severus stared at the fire when he answered.
The logs in the hearth snapped and crackled in the background as they gawked at him in open-mouthed astonishment.
Cedric nodded sagely. “It is, but I will explain later. It seems Mr. Ollivander has arrived.”
“It’s always been you, Harry. Since we were eleven and hated each other, at twelve when I admired your bravery in the Chamber from afar, at thirteen when I realized what my true feelings were and ran like a coward in the other direction. Last year during the tournament, I was certain you aimed to kill me with your foolhardy stunts during the tasks. But Merlin, Harry, I didn’t think my heart could break more than it did when I heard about the damn apple. Don’t you know better than to eat untested food or drink?”
“Merlin, Harry, so do I,” Draco confessed before resealing their lips in a desperate clash of teeth and tongues and hunger until he wrenched away with a gasp when his lungs begged for oxygen. “When I saw you in the mirror, I thought you came to kill me. I would’ve let you. A convenient loophole in the Dark Lord’s plan,” Draco smiled grimly.
“No,” Draco snarled. “I do not uphold the fascist ideologies of my father, as you well know. How could I when you’re my godfather? Do you really believe I see you as inferior? Or Granger?” The man startled, but Draco rolled his eyes and waved a hand dismissively as he leaned back in his chair.
“I-I can’t believe he would. And if that’s the case, you’re just as likely a candidate,” Hermione argued weakly.
Silence reigned as another piece of smouldering parchment floated from the goblet and Dumbledore’s fingers deftly caught it. Dread coiled in Harry’s gut as the Headmaster squinted through his spectacles before reading the name.
“Are you alright? You don’t look well,” he frowned, sweeping his mercurial gaze over him.
“We’re here for you, Harry,” Blaise said gruffly when they released them.
. They could feel the similarities and the differences of their auras melding into something more powerful with every shared breath.
Draco smiled, his thumb skirting across his hand before letting him go. “Come on, then. The sooner we go inside, the sooner we can have this done.”
“We have a Champion. We don’t need you,” he hissed. Spinning on his heel, Ron climbed on his bed and spelled his curtains closed. The others followed suit and noxed the light, leaving Harry curled in a ball with his terrified panting the only sound in the darkness.
Shuddering violently, Draco said, “No, thank you. I love you dearly, but only as a friend, I’m afraid. Nor do I wish for my father to make any decisions regarding my life ever again.”
He’d always believed the Slytherins, with their perfect pureblood upbringing, were too entitled to ever understand him or his problems. Yet in forty-eight hours, they’d proven better friends than those he once called family. The perfection they displayed was a façade. With their walls down, Harry saw who they really were, and he realized few in the world could ever truly understand him the way they did. Pain was, unfortunately, a great equalizer and they’d all seen their fair share.
Everyone, except Draco who couldn’t tear his awed eyes off Harry, shared a look. There were half-bloods and ambitious muggle-borns in their House, though admittedly, they didn’t interact with them much. Of course, that could be changed. Nodding in unison, they agreed to make more of an effort and break down the barriers keeping them separated.
A wet thumb stroked his cheek and Draco’s stomach flipped in response to his tenderness. “Can I kiss you?” Harry asked, trepidation flickering across his face.
“Harry,” he breathed.
Snape’s robes hadn’t even billowed out of the exit before they bombarded Harry with well-wishes. Thankfully, his friends stepped in, acting as a barrier between him and his enthusiastic housemates so they couldn’t swarm him. Crabbe’s sharp whistle pierced the mad chatter, freezing everyone in their tracks.
The taunts and jinxes en route to the Hall were expected, but thankfully none of his detractors were aware of Harry’s new House yet. The others unanimously decided not to wear anything obviously Slytherin to dinner, sticking to the neutral pieces of their uniforms, while Harry chose his favourite worn jeans and equally well-loved blue cotton tee. It felt odd to not see a hint of green or silver among them, but he appreciated his friends granting him a small reprieve. They were all too aware that his appearance at breakfast tomorrow in his new colours would incite a riot.
Taking Harry’s hand, they shouted their goodbyes and headed into the gardens. They shrieked when they stumbled into a gathering of Lucius’ famed albino peacocks, racing to escape the disgruntled peafowl trying to peck them. When they reached the pond, Harry bent over his knees, while Draco sprawled on his back and flung an arm across his eyes.
“So what do you want to do about it?” Harry asked.
“Goddamn it,” Draco grumbled.
Draco nudged him lightly with his elbow. “That’s where you’re wrong, Scarhead. You have me
Standing outside the office, Hermione and Madam Pomfrey shared watery smiles before scurrying off to inform McGonagall and Dumbledore of the news. And if their absence gave the pair a few extra moments of blissful time alone, then all the better. There wouldn’t be much of it for any of them in the coming days.
“You trust me not to run when I’m out of sight?” Draco asked.
Theo pressed a hand over his heart and held Draco’s steely gaze. “I don’t care what colour uniform he wears; he’s my brother now. Same as you and the lads.” Draco nodded and shot a glance at Blaise, who flashed his palm in agreement.
Chuckling bitterly, she hooked her arm through his. “Oh, sweet Potter. I have one for every outfit. Keep it. It’s a gift.”
Resigned that it was time to deal with the aftermath of yesterday, he sat up but paused with his fingers on the curtain when he heard whispers in the room and craned to hear.
Draco blinked as Harry raked a hand through his messy hair to center himself. His throat clicked loudly in the deafening silence when he swallowed the lump threatening to unravel the threads of his composure as he fell into mesmerizing silver pools.
The leather creaked when the Hat’s grin stretched to match his wearer’s. “Well then, I’m glad I can finally say: better be SLYTHERIN!”
.” Clenching his fists, he forced the words through his teeth with difficulty. “It wasn’t by choice. The options were: take the Mark to make up for Father’s mistakes or let Greyback have my mother.”
Slowly the darkness receded from his vision, and Draco made out Harry’s concerned expression. “Harry,” he sighed, his muscles uncoiling as oxygen flooded his system.
Closing her eyes in concentration, she snapped her fingers. Both wizards startled when they flew open a moment later, revealing pupils blown so wide they obscured all the colour in her enormous eyes.
Harry’s chest tightened uncomfortably, aware he was likely right. Whatever mission Voldemort wanted Draco to complete weighed heavily on him. Hell, he was half-dead already.
The portraits tittered amongst themselves at his insubordination, but Harry silenced them with a mere flick of his wrist; his furious gaze steadfastly trained on the man rapidly losing the last vestiges of his respect.
After deciding that he’s given them enough warning, he apparates to Wiltshire.
Jones had managed to procure them each a second-hand tuxedo, fine enough that they wouldn’t insult their hosts by their mere presence, but not so fine as to suggest they didn’t know their place. Draco thought Harry looked quite dashing in a tailcoat. He might tell him later, if they ever found one another again.
Harry’s desperate warning was drowned out by Draco’s startled shout and the clang of the heavy cabinet tipping over onto the floor.
“Harry...we need to go in there…”
. Never, and I mean
, Teddy tells Scorpius,
As they walked back down the long, gravel drive that led up to the front door of the hospital, Draco stopped to take one last look.
“You see, these kings,” Malfoy continued, coming to stand opposite Potter, “have stolen something that does not belong to them. Something priceless and very important. They are under the mistaken impression that this item will bring them wealth and influence.” Draco turned to face the Duke, holding his eye contact.
“Well what else am I supposed to call you? You’re jumping out of your skin at the slightest breeze through a clearly open window. You’re seeing corporeal apparitions around every corner that turn out to be curtains or furniture! If I didn’t know you better, I’d suggest you’ve taken up the wrong hobby.”
there was more to the decision.
Potter held up a silencing hand, never taking his eyes off the Duke’s face. He waited until the room fell quiet once more. “What the fourth king failed to consider was that the men--back to retrieve what was rightfully theirs--had been inside the palace all along. They divined the kings’ plan before the kings themselves concocted it.”
The air in the small room was hot and sour, like the exhalation of some great monster. The light from Draco’s wand fell across the low, metal cabinet pushed against the windowless wall. He watched it shake and rattle, beating out the same thumping rhythm they had heard from the hallway.
The walls of the wide, cavernous room were coated in an oozing, black slime shot through with what looked like veins, thick and pulsing. The grotesque web was punctuated every few meters by a twitching mass, an oozing sac that roiled and bubbled. They had stumbled into a Dementor colony.
Harry’s blood ran cold at what he saw.
“Bloody Merlin,
That night, as Draco lay in bed--loose and buzzing from champagne and love and Harry--he thought, finally, he might sleep well. He was being gently lulled by hazy dreams of their future wedding and flashes of their friends’ faces, until…
Now that he’s here, watching Draco pick his way cautiously up the rotting staircase, he admits to himself that
When Harry had knocked loudly on the front door at 7am, Draco yelped. He thought his heart had finally stopped. It took every ounce of energy he had left to walk to the front door, open it, and Apparate away. He was stunned that he didn’t splinch himself in the process.
“Oh, well. Don’t tell him I told you, but I think he’s going to propose soon!” Draco replies, soundingpleased.
.” Harry said with a laugh. “You brought me breakfast in bed. I was half-joking, but then you said--”
“Mmm, we should turn the lights off more often, dad!” says Scorpius sliding several sticky fingers between his lips. He’s chosen to entirely ignore Harry’s careful s'more making instructions in favor of fitting as many charred marshmallows into his mouth at once as he can manage.
“What?”
“Nevermind, look. It’s about Draco…”
Look, about that, Malfoy…
“Sap.”
“It changed a long time ago,” Harry said softly, one hand coming to rest over Draco’s heart.
,” he muttered to the floor, “and I think we’ve established that you don’t really ‘know me’ at all. Now, finish separating those wires and let’s g--
Whatever, the point is I’m mad for you and I never told you because, well, there was the whole war thing and then the whole trial thing, and since then I’ve become a bit of a self-righteous coward. Also, I fancy myself something of a martyr. I think the constant pouting makes my mouth look more kissable, don’t you?
“Yes, Harry dear, Draco has told us so much about you, please sit. There’s so much we need to talk about. To clear the air.”
.” Draco let Harry rest a hand along his jaw. “Like it was that easy.”
Draco shoots to his feet, a soft, pleading look on his beautiful face. He moves toward Harry carefully, extending pleading hands until he can grasp Harry’s shoulders.
Potter bent at the waist, extending the deck out toward the Duke. “If you please, Your Grace, examine these cards and confirm for us that this is a complete and unaltered deck.” The Duke took his time. He fingered every card, turned them this way and that, counted silently. After a minute he looked at the audience, “Yes, this seems to be a perfectly normal deck of playing cards.”
Your offer to take me on a date.
“Lumos…” Draco whispered as he stepped over the threshold.
Draco flinched hard as the warped floorboards creaked under Harry’s foot.
Harry sighed and scrubbed his face with a sweaty palm. “I know...I know that, love.’ Draco flinched at the easy term of endearment. “I’m here, aren’t I? I’ll always be here.”
“Pansy, you don’t have a job.”
“Yes, Harry Potter. You
just take this seriously for like, one second. Please.”
Harry just grins at you like the insufferable bastard that he is.
“You just called the Manor your home. I thought… I’d hoped you considered this your home.”
“Ummmmm, I don’t know. He thought it would be cool, like Teddy does.”
The plaque above the door read ‘boiler room’.
Without thinking, Harry leaped in between Draco and Narcissa, shoving Draco back toward the door. Draco shook his head and watched, frantic, as the Boggart slowly morphed into…
He moves quickly but cautiously toward the sound, pausing just outside the open door.
“I mean. Fuck, this is
Harry’s snake Patronus slithered weakly from the end of his wand, forcing the Dementor to tumble clumsily back, away from Draco who gulped in lung-fulls of air as he tried to regain his feet. The silver light from the spell fully illuminated the room.
Draco’s ghost shrunk and twisted, withering away to a small shape on the floor.

“It’s nothing. I mean, I guess it’s not nothing, but it’s small. It was the morning you asked to move in with me. Well, you insisted, actually.” Draco laughed, the tension melting from his body. “I’ve just...always loved you best in the morning, when your hair is even worse than it usually is. Your eyes were so green in the morning sun. I remember thinking how
“Harry…babe!” you call, trying to catch your oblivious boyfriend’s attention. He was the one who insisted on moving into this
“...they turn around to find….”
As time wore on, Draco was forced to admit that something...or
harry
“Yes. I swear, Draco, I won’t keep something like that--like anything--from you again.”
Draco let Harry kiss him, soundly, and Harry felt Draco’s exhausted body sag against him.
“JUST THEN,” Harry shouts across the giggling and shouting, causing everyone to fall silent, “both boys heard the faintest scratching noise just outside the driver’s side window...almost like...the sound of a hook...scraping across metal….” Harry waggles his eyebrows.
Draco had confided in Harry about his
“Mother, I’ve told you a hundred times, you can’t have milk in your tea anymore. It upsets your stomach for days. Here, let me—”
Draco’s face fell. He closed his eyes and swayed on his feet. Harry thought he was actually going to faint. He took two quick steps before Draco stopped him with an outstretched palm.
! Like that!”
“Fine. We go as far down the stairs as we can without breaking a limb, give it a quick scan, and get out. I’ll even leave an audio recorder down there if it’ll make you feel better.”
You’re clearing up after dinner when the lights start to flicker. The mid-summer storm outside has been raging for the better part of an hour and shows no signs of slowing.
“There were...some things I needed to say to him. To his face. I needed to say them so that I could finally put him in the past where he belongs. I just...want to live fully in the present. With you.”
“Stop avoiding the question, Draco. You know as well as I do that it isn’t safe--not because I think that whatever’s keeping you awake is going to...I don’t know,
, huh? I tell you not to call me a scaredy-crup once and you go and swallow a dictionary just to insult me.”
Potter stepped forward from where he’d been leant against the vanishing cabinet situated on the far left of the low stage, opposite the second cabinet on the right. “We’d like to tell you a story,” he said in a soft voice. The thick blanket of stale air seemed to ripple with the low, wooden creak as the audience leaned forward as one. Potter flicked his wrist and a deck of cards appeared, pinched between the pads of his thumb and first two fingers. A woman in the third row gasped, softly. He fanned the cards out and extended his arm, moving it first to the left, then to the right.
The air in the small room was hot and sour, like the exhalation of some great monster. The light from Harry’s wand fell across the low, metal cabinet pushed against the windowless wall. He watched it shake and rattle, beating out the same thumping rhythm they had heard from the hallway.
Even if I believed you, I’ve never given Draco Malfoy my number. My *muggle* mobile number.
“Harry, wait... I think that’s a--”

is pretty fucking unnerving, but...that’s not why the boggart turned into her.”
“Sshh, Scorp! I want to hear more about the guy with a hook for a hand!” says Teddy as he flicks Scorpius on the shoulder.
Draco…
Draco’s enigmatic expression breaks a little. “Oh, Harry, love. You know I want that. Of course I want to build a life with you. It’s just… I know I complain about mother and father, but they’re getting old. They need me. I’d… I’d worry about leaving them all alone in that big old Manor.”

. I know you love him very much. Perhaps now you can invite him to come live with us? We’ve got more than enough room, you know,” Narcissa’s reedy voice cracks a little, and Draco clears his throat.
“OH NO! THE MAN WITH THE HOOK! HARRY!” Scorpius shouts, nearly bursting your eardrum.
“What was that? Do you want to speak up a little,
Harry was thrown backward by the force of Draco’s incantation. He had to cover his eyes with his arm, the shine of it was so bright. When his eyes finally adjusted, he blinked owlishly into the face of a brilliant, silver stag.
“Harry, you know how this goes, none of this should be new to you,” Draco sighed, turning fully towards Harry and resting one hand on a cocked hip.
how I envisioned this going. I...was going to--
Oh. You’re drunk.
“Oh, fuck you, Potter,” Draco breathed, looking at the little, white ferret now snuffling at Harry’s shoes.
bloody hell, who is this??
So you see, Potter, it is in fact I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, confessing my love and “hitting you up for a shag at 1am” as you so elegantly put it.
“Scorpius, what have I told you about calling people names?” you say, exasperated and ready for this whole charade to end. “Harry, is that the end of the story?”
“I mean. Fuck, this is not how I envisioned this going. I...was going to--am going to--ask you to marry me and I just...needed him to know that I love you and that I intend to love you for as long as you’ll let me. Maybe it’s selfish, but I wanted to tell him that you’re happy, that in spite of his best efforts you’re,” Harry’s voice broke over the tears that were now spilling down his cheeks, “the most incredible person I’ve ever met. You’re kind, so bloody smart, and funny, and even when you’re in a foul mood you always remember to make my tea how I like and ask about my day. You’re my family, Draco. I’m sorry that I didn’t talk to you first.”
“Ladies and Gentlemen,” Malfoy’s deep voice resonated around the cavernous space. “I’m afraid the time has come for our final act. It is a simple, but elegant, illusion.
...here.
Before Draco could finish his desperate warning from where he stood on the threshold, the door slammed shut in his face. His hand shot to the doorknob, but it wouldn’t even turn. He shouted a few frantic unlocking spells at it, but nothing worked.
“Oh...well I—”
“Coooooool…” interjects Teddy.
Oh, so you were drunk
Harry stepped gingerly over a pile of insulation that had fallen from the ceiling. It was probably riddled with asbestos.
Harry’s blood ran cold at what he saw.
“Hmm...I have a better idea,’ Harry says. You recognize the look in his eyes, it’s the one that always precedes mischief.
“Nothing, just...watch that stair, it looks ready to crumble.”
“Okay, sure, Harry, but I don’t think old buildings have a sense of rhythm. Look, I think we should just head up there and check it out. We need to finish setting up the rest of the monitors anyway.”
“No….” Draco whined weakly as he stared up from his knees into the pitted, rotting face of his mother.
Hang on, Teddy isn’t a brat. I thought you two got on rather well…?
Narcissa hissed, again.
Malfoy fluttered the long fingers of his free hand over the deck before lifting the top four cards. A wave of surprise rolled through the audience as they realized that he held all four kings. They began clapping, hesitantly at first, then more enthusiastically.
“No, he isn’t a wizard so he can’t see the Healers.”
“Dad, dad, dad, dad…”
Bloody…Potter, that wasn’t MY offer!
“Draco…”
He stood, paralyzed, for what felt like a century--listening to the small, desperate sounds coming from Draco. He lifted his wand arm, sure that it would be the last move he ever made.
What offer?
“...Draco?”
“What would you have me be concerned about, Draco?” Harry deadpanned as best he could while his breath returned to him.
“What?? That’s what you’re concerned about right now? We were almost just kissed by a horde of Dementors and you want to know when I learned to cast a Patronus?!” Draco growled, stalking unsteadily away from the boiler room door.
And thought that…pretending to be Draco Malfoy, of all people, would entice me to meet up with a total stranger?
Harry collapsed against the wall, sliding into a crouch. “I...yes, and no.” He said in a small voice. “It’s...more complicated than that, I think.”
Harry says, lowering his voice to a register far deeper than you’ve heard any five
“Harry...is that what you think you did?” Draco placed a hand over Harry’s where it lay on his chest, the other coming up to rest on the nape of Harry’s neck.
He felt certain now, staring into the milky white of her dead eyes, that he was responsible for her death. He hadn’t tried hard enough, done
“Do you see it?”
, Harry! Haven’t you heard of elder abuse? How could I do something like that to them?”
…” Draco’s head snapped up toward the ceiling.
“The second king thinks that the thieves can’t be so stupid as to walk right in through the front door, so he sets a guard on the second floor of the castle. They will scale the walls and enter through a window, surely!” Malfoy slid the king of spades into the deck just below the middle.
How exactly did you get my number?
” It was the same, grating voice that had haunted Draco’s sleepless nights for nearly half his life.
Their only warning was a sound like a rustling cloak and the sudden, overwhelming feeling of absolute hopelessness.
exactly. She--
had visited him for the first time three nights after his mother took her own life, only hours after his father had been carted off to fester in Azkaban. He knew, even through the heavy cloak of grief and panic that smothered him back then, that
“I don’t want you to stay.” Harry said softly, one hand coming to rest over Draco’s heart.
“What would you do,” Potter said as he, too, turned to face the Duke, “if someone took something from you, something precious? Would you...call the police? Confront the thief? Would you ask your neighbors for help, or keep quiet out of fear and shame? Would you do whatever it took to get it back?”
“Why?” Draco whispered, and Harry’s heart broke.
“Once upon a time,” he tries again, “there were two boys who were driving home from the movie theatre.”
Scorpius wriggles on his cushion next to you, giddy from the sugar high and hanging on Harry’s every word. You place a hand on the top of his head to settle him.
“...What?”

“He’s never asked me to go home with him. I haven’t… I haven’t been to the Manor since the War.”
Harry
“I have not been
” Draco snarled, derisively. “These places were important and impressive once upon a time. You know that, but you’re just being obstinate and contrarian.”
Draco’s face twists into an ugly frown. “
You could “do” dinner? That’s all, after everything I’ve just said, you can “do” dinner??
Then Harry sobbed, loud and broken.
, jarringly pretty among all this rot. Draco places a soft kiss on Harry's trembling lips.
“Right--you get the camera, I’ll get the wires...I think we’ve spent more than enough time in this horrible place.” Harry said, firmly.
What do you mean, who is this? I thought muggle mobiles know who you’re talking to already.
Draco shook himself and went about clicking the digital camera into its tripod. He turned it to face the open door to the hospital’s former administrative offices. Rumor had it that the first director of the institution had taken the life of his secretary, and then his own, right behind the big front desk. If they were going to capture any EVPs or orbs, this would be the most likely location.
It’s then that Harry looks to Lucius and Narcissa, seated in chairs on either side of Draco.
“We couldn’t afford to pay the elves, after the trials. We had to let them go.”
“Harry, why does he have a hook instead of a hand?” Scorpius asks.
...what--I mean, can you tell me?”
“Harry. Please. Join us.”
, to protect his family. Not even the love of her only son had convinced her to stay, to fight….to live.
“Draco, wait... I think that’s a--”
You expect me to believe Draco Malfoy is confessing his love and hitting me up for a shag at 1am. On a *muggle* mobile.
dangerous murderer and won’t hesitate to kill anyone he encounters.”
They opened the doors of the vanishing cabinets at the same moment. Harry turned to face Draco, his gaze hot and pleading, tears stinging his eyes. Draco nodded quickly at him, his smile watery and wavering, before stepping inside. As Harry pulled the door closed behind him he heard the unmistakable sound of a body hitting the floor, followed by a high, piercing shriek, before the dark consumed him.
Malfoy…
“Can’t be, Harry won’t teach me how to drive,” Teddy huffs.
of the door echoes in his ears as it’s spelled shut behind him.
“And?”
. Harry--”
“Potter. Draco’s relationship with his parents is… complicated.”
“Jones, my good man,” Draco shouted jovially, removing the bullet from between his teeth, “tell me, are these your initials here?”
“There were...some things I needed to say to him. To his face. I needed to say them so that I could finally put him in the past where he belongs. I just...want to live fully in the present. With you.”
“Oh, here we go..” you say, as two sets of small feet thunder down the stairs and through the sitting room. You wonder, for probably the millionth time, how two such small creatures can be so very loud.
didn’t need you to set up the AV equipment I’d suggest you leave me alone and never contact me again...
“Yes, but that doesn’t mean it’s any less idiotic
It really would be much more efficient if you just let me demonstrate
“No, Harry, why did you do it? Why did you visit Lucius? I told you--from the beginning, I’ve told you that neither of us was to ever speak to him again. If anything good ever lived inside that man, it’s been dead for a long time. My mother--”
Harry could see that it was slightly ajar. As he crouched and peered through the little window he could vaguely make out the shape of a bare, metal bed frame to the left and what could possibly be a small wardrobe or trunk on the far wall.
Harry insists you all forgo the perfectly good couches you spent days picking out and sit on the cushions he’s conjured on the sitting room floor. He arranges you in a circle around a conjured flame, floating in a shallow bowl.
See, I can do the sexy insults thing, too :*
Potter and Malfoy’s first few tricks were received with a barrage of insults and empty bottles. The pub’s patrons had no interest in simple card tricks or disappearing handkerchiefs. No, tonight Potter and Malfoy would have to pull out all the stops if they hoped to get paid.
Maybe just a shag, then?
tall hill overlooking the city.”
Harry chuckled.
…” Harry murmured.
Draco…?
“Yeah,” Harry laughed loudly, pulling Draco in to kiss him soundly. “You can.”
Fine. Look, if you accept full responsibility, does that mean your offer still stands?
--I’m so happy I came back, Draco. To you.
Draco
He rose to his feet and followed her obediently like he had done countless times in his life. She led him to the far end of the hall where a narrow door stood half-open. Draco could barely make out the steep staircase rising up into total darkness.
I’ve been hopelessly in love with you since we were sixteen, won’t shut my bloody mouth about you actually, can I take you on a date? I’m still very rich, all things considered, and know all the best restaurants in Wizarding Britain.
Yes, Harry? ;)
Scorpius shrieks and flails in your lap, overturning the bowl with the little conjured flame. The rug catches fire quickly.
“You see,” he says, leaning in again and lowering his voice to a whisper. “When the two boys finally arrive home safe and sound, they step out of their car…”
Draco
When he pulled back, Draco wiped the last tears from his cheek.
If you don’t want to date me or shag me just say so, Potter. No need to play hard to get and toss around insults
Draco’s rising voice was cut off as the thumping started up again, more insistent this time. Taking small, silent steps they approached the door from behind which the noises seemed to be coming.
Draco, I’m serious.
Dear Harry,
Harry dropped to his hands and knees, panting, while Draco leaned against a wall, head bowed so low it was almost between his knees.
“So, Draco, my boy. How is your Mister Potter?” Lucius asks. Harry had forgotten how alike he and Draco sound, though Lucius’s voice is a touch deeper.
“Well, first of all I could never let you run off to a place like this without--”
Harry tightened his grasp on his wand and muttered a soft Lumos Maxima before turning the doorknob.
“Ted, you’re twelve, twelve-year-olds can’t even get their permit…” you start.
No. It doesn’t, whatever it is.
“Okay, okay, everyone shh…” Harry cuts in. “I’ve got a story for you.”
It’s true that I’m still rich, all things considered, but you’re paying

What follows are possibly the most chaotic ten minutes of your entire life.
“Did you hear that noise? It sounded like footsteps on the floor above us.”
Draco was chasing strange ghosts to try and put his own to rest.

“Edward, I don’t know where you pick up these phrases, but I assure you I am

“I don’t know, our close brush with a fate worse than death? Your own bloody well-being, for once?! You’re so...I can’t believe I ever--and you say I’m the reckless one!”
“Isn’t it always?”
I do not watch you, DRACO.
“Yes, Scorpius says to Teddy:
Draco couldn’t move. He couldn’t even breathe. He had always known, in the back of his mind, that
“I… I know that. I do. I just feel so guilty, sometimes…”
Harry felt the very last of his resolve evaporate as he watched another, and then another, Dementor float out of the darkness towards them. He heard a sob tear through the air and realized it had come out of his own mouth.
The second night, he had been determined to get ahead of...whatever it was. He warded his bedroom more heavily than normal, complete with a series of complex silencing and stasis charms to keep any noise, or people, out. It didn’t work. It had never worked.
Draco moved to follow Narcissa obediently like he had done countless times in his life. She turned and disappeared into the gloom.
“Oh.”
It had started like it always did: shadows in his peripheral vision, the feeling of being watched, the temperature in his flat dropping suddenly, out of nowhere.
“Fine, but you’re leading the way...I’m fucking sick of always handling your mess,” Harry muttered under his breath.
Draco…Malfoy?

“That was the first time I’ve cast a Patronus successfully--let alone a corporeal one.”
“You know it’s more than just a
A manic laugh rips from Harry’s throat as what he thought was Narcissa’s voice drips out of Draco’s mouth like the chime of discordant bells. He takes several stilted steps backward toward the door.
“I know, but...if that’s what the Boggart became for you, it must mean you’re still seeing her. She--whatever she is to you now--is your worst fear.”
“So, Draco Malfoy, will you? Will you marry me?”
“We aren’t
thought Harry as he lifted his hand to his mouth.
“And...the Healers couldn’t regrow his hand?”
“What?” replied Harry, sounding entirely unconcerned...and a little bored.
“It’s just that you’re so...I can’t believe I ever--and you say I’m the reckless one!” Harry shouted, cutting Draco off. “I wouldn’t even have to worry about shit like that if it weren’t for you and this stupid fucking hobby!” Harry panted--from anger now, instead of fear.

“Fine. Make it quick.”
The sound of Harry’s breath was loud in his ears as he and Draco stared at one another over their revolvers. Harry tried to communicate to Draco with his eyes that if this
“Well, first of all, I could never let you run off to a place like this without--”
He allowed his mouth to fall open as Draco did the same.
“Yeah, why wouldn’t I be alright? That was wicked, Harry! Nice one, Scorp!”
“Have they? I hadn’t noticed,” you respond, drily, plopping Scorpius firmly back onto his feet.
“I know. I know, Draco, and I’m so sorry that I didn’t talk with you about it first. But...you aren’t the only one who has a complicated relationship with your father--no, no, I know it isn’t the same.” Harry took a tentative step closer to Draco, and when Draco didn’t object he moved to look him in the eye.
Harry’s stomach flips, despite his overwhelming unease.
Always so preoccupied with blood purity, Potter, haven’t you learned anything?
“Harry...I think we need to go down there…”
Bloody hell um…okay…
“Oh, sod your bloody
You’ve practically been the center of my universe since I was eleven years old, for Merlin’s sake. I think about you all the time. I miss you all the time, even when we’re in the same room.
“Careful, cub, stop running--you’re going to run straight into the table, or a wall…” Harry says, gripping Teddy by the shoulders to steady him in the dim kitchen. The only light comes from the streetlamp in the alleyway out back and the rapid flashes of lightning slicing through the sky.

“I don’t… I don’t think I can do that, Pansy.”

You summon your wand, but Harry has his at the ready with a hastily muttered
“Harry! Harry, say something! Talk to me! Harry...pick up your wand, you have to--”
The stale air rushing out of the black cavity was icy cold and damp. He stretched out an arm and his hand completely disappeared into the darkness. The doorway was like a greedy mouth, swallowing down the scant light and warmth from the scattered emergency lights dotting the upstairs hallway.
Draco slanted his narrowed eyes at Harry. “Coward,” he muttered, before taking a few steps forward and placing his hand flat on the door. It was warm under his palm.
was her.
“Why, then?” Harry growled. “I’m really trying to keep up here, Draco, but you aren’t exactly giving me much to work with. Dragging me off to these shitholes all the time, chasing after something. We wouldn’t even be here right now if it weren’t for you and this stupid fucking hobby!” Harry panted--from anger now instead of fear.
They turned to face one another across the little table, reaching for their revolvers at the same time. They held the guns before their chests, muzzles pointed upwards. As if on cue, they spun on their heels and began pacing slowly to either side of the stage. “Fair warning,” Potter said, not taking his eyes off of Malfoy as he spun back around, “this will be quite loud.” Each man extended his arm, aiming his loaded revolver at the other.
Their bodies are stiff and cold-looking. Their skin is waxy and grey, and both of their skulls are swathed in wisps of white-blonde hair that looks to have been tacked on with a hasty sticking charm. Harry shifts one step to the right, enough to see that Lucius’s eyelids are gone and his eyes have been replaced with shiny, black marbles.
Harry rolled his eyes and chose to ignore that last bit.
Perhaps not, but I’ve seen the way you watch me when you think I’m not looking…Draco.

“You know it’s more than just a
Draco ;)
The simultaneous shots echoed riotously around the small pub. Rose screamed shrilly and the rest of the crowd burst into shouts and jeers of disbelief. For a moment the room was hazy with gunsmoke, heat, and crackling energy.
“Please, Pansy. You know I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t serious. I...need your help.”
“What…” Scorpius whispers back, fist firmly situated in his mouth.
“Harry—” Pansy says, stopping him as the flames flare green. “If you really love him—”
Pansy draws her worried eyebrows down between her liquor-glassy eyes. “Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”
“Why?” Draco whispered, and Harry’s heart broke.
,” Harry whispers back. “So, Teddy and Scorpius decide to drive up to the top of a

He realized he had drifted off at some point when he woke suddenly to the feeling of his duvet wrapping tightly around his body, locking his arms to his sides and collapsing his windpipe. He froze, paralyzed, before being jolted into action by the feeling of something moving against his foot. He had turned on all the lights and didn’t try to go back to sleep.
Harry dropped to his hands and knees, panting, while Draco leaned against a wall, head bowed so low it was almost between his knees.
Pansy exhales an exasperated cloud of spicy smoke into Harry’s face and sits up straight.
“Merlin, Harry, get the

As they walked back down the long, gravel drive that led up to the front door of the hospital, Draco realized the heavy, hunted feeling he’d been carrying around for days had lifted. Whatever It was must have moved on. He just felt tired...and happy.
Draco
He watches the shutters fall behind Draco’s eyes, like they always do when they have this conversation. He’s tried so hard to respect Draco’s request for time and space, but lately it’s like a chasm has opened between them, and Harry doesn’t know how to bridge it. His gut reaction to the feeling of impending loss has always been to hold tighter, to grasp and pull. He knows how suffocating that can be for some people, but he can’t help it.
“Ladies and gentlemen, Potter and Malfoy’s…
I’m sorry, if I said something…
Honestly, Potter
twelve year old speak in. Scorpius just giggles and squirms about in your lap.
“I’m not happy about it, but...I suppose I understand why you did it. And it’s done now? You’ve resolved whatever it is you needed to resolve?”
Harry watched Draco fall to his knees in slow motion. His wand dropped from his hand and rolled away, taking the light with it.
Draco hums tiredly in response, hands stilling in Harry’s hair. “‘Spose we can tell everyone to settle their bets on whether we’d make it to a year or not. I think Longbottom is the only one who went in our favor.”
You realize you’ve clutched Scorpius to your chest in a vice-like grip when he starts to pull at your sleeve and choke out, “
The hall stretched far away from them into the quiet darkness. It was lined on both sides by a series of single rooms. Harry noticed a small, barred window in the very center of the heavy door to the first room on his left and shuddered.
“Why is it a hook now, though?”
Draco glances up from the opposite side of the small table, startled. He looks like a rabbit caught in the gaze of a hungry dog--hunched and shivering, eyes wide and darting erratically. But then a smile cuts across his pale face. His pink lips curve up at the edges, but the expression doesn’t reach his eyes.
“Well, first of all I could never let you run off to a place like this without--”
A series of emotions passes over Pansy’s face as she eyes him. Amusement, then scorn, then sadness, and finally pity.
“Did you get that on camera…?” he asked Draco breathlessly, ignoring the searing pain in his face and the tears streaming from his eyes.
“Come with me…” she said, her voice clattering like a spill of dry bones or the wind through dead grass.

“Next time, let’s just light some lamps and make a Lego dragon, yeah? Or better yet, fix the bl--fix the lights!” you hiss.
The sound of Harry’s sobbing faded away as Draco turned his head slowly to meet his mother’s eyes. She looked exactly as she had the last time he had seen her, hours before she took her own life. Thin and pale, but breathing. Alive.
but he hadn’t found what he was looking for yet.
“Forget it. Look, I just need some space. I don’t want to say something in anger that I’ll regret later. Your feelings are valid, I just...feel a little hurt right now, to be honest. I’m going to Ron and Hermione’s for the night. Feel free to stay. Or not. Merlin knows you never do.”
Teddy starts chanting Harry’s name over and over and pointing at where the flames lick at the cushion he was just seated on.
Draco’s face fell. He closed his eyes and swayed on his feet. Harry thought he was actually going to faint. He took two quick steps before Draco stopped him with an outstretched palm.
“Anyways,” Harry says firmly, planting his palms on his thighs. “The man on the radio tells everyone listening that they should alert the authorities
“I wanted to tell him that I’m going to marry you!” Harry shouted over Draco, silencing him.
“I couldn’t...not until you--”
“What do you want, Potter? I’m terribly busy.”
“You sir, what’s your name?” Potter pointed to a small, wiry gentleman just behind the first row of patrons. “Jones,” he replied. Potter approached the man with his palm outstretched, several bullets resting on it. “Jones, pick a bullet, any of them will do, they’re all the same. Give them each a thorough inspection if you like.” Malfoy did the same on the other side of the room, approaching a young woman whose name was Rose–she looked terrified to be singled out. The volunteers each selected their bullet.
“The lights have gone.”
, together
“Ugh, okay, fine. But it’s really way too early in the night for you to start getting so...reactive.”
That night, as Draco lay in bed--loose and buzzing from champagne and love and
“Sorry, Scorp...Ted, alright?”
“Yeah,” Harry said breathlessly, pulling Draco in to kiss him soundly. When he pulled back, Draco wiped the last tears from his cheek.
“I don’t know, our close brush with a fate worse than death? Your own bloody well-being, for once?! You’re so...I can’t believe I ever--and you say I’m the reckless one! We wouldn’t even be here right now if it weren’t for you and this stupid fucking hobby!” Harry screamed, still panting but from anger now, instead of fear.
He knew he was exhausted, and that his mind was likely playing tricks on him, but there in a window on the second floor was his mother. She was smiling, her cheeks rosy, one hand pressed to the locket she always wore--the one that held Draco’s picture.
He screamed then, high and loud, as she extended one grey, moldering hand toward his face.
one night, before they’d even started properly dating, drunk on good firewhisky and the rush of growing infatuation. He had promised Harry that he’d taken care of it ages ago.
He had never been more afraid in his whole life.
Oh, bugger off, Potter you had no idea it wasn’t me. You were ready to spill your innermost desires to a stranger on your mobile! Stupid Gryffindor.
Draco, I can tell that you didn’t block my number.
Potter and Malfoy walked around the Duke in a slow, tight circle, heads bowed to the floor as if contemplating their own answers to the question. They came to a stop in their original positions, making eye contact with one another. “The kings have learned that the rightful owners of their pilfered treasure are planning to break into the palace,” Malfoy said gesturing with his free hand at the kingless deck he held in the other, “and steal it back. They form a foolproof plan to thwart them.”
Harry never received a reply to his owl to Lucius and Narcissa asking if it’d be alright to visit that afternoon. He isn’t surprised; he knows there’s no love lost between them even now, even after he’s been with their son for years.
“Oh.”
Draco let Harry kiss him, soundly, and Harry felt Draco’s exhausted body sag against him.
The flames hiss as the water douses them, replacing the bright-hot fire with black smoke that has you all coughing into your sleeves.
crying now.
“...What?” Draco’s eyes were wide, searching Harry’s face.
“No, Harry, why did you do it? Why did you visit Lucius? I told you--from the beginning, I’ve told you that neither of us were to ever speak to him again. If anything good ever lived inside that man, it’s been dead for a long time. My mother--”
“Happy anniversary, love,” Harry pants into Draco’s wet, open mouth. He thinks he can make out the chirping of morning birds over their slowing breaths, and the warm lamplight in the room is slowly being suffused with cool grey from the dawning sun. They hadn’t slept at all that night.
“So, Draco Malfoy, will you? Will you marry me?”
“We don’t need to do anything, actually. If the front hallway is this bad,” Harry gestured to the rotted beams lying about, bristling with rusty nails and screws, “I can only imagine what sort of death trap the boiler room--”
“Oh, yeah! The doors are locked!” Scorpius mumbles around his fist. Harry nods, but the firelight glinting off his glasses makes him look positively sinister.
? What the fuck does that even mean, Harry, what could you possibly have to say to that man that you needed to--”
Draco’s face fell as he stood. He closed his eyes and swayed on his feet. Harry thought he was actually going to faint. He took two quick steps before Draco stopped him with an outstretched palm.
“I wanted to tell him that I’m going to marry you!” Harry shouted over Draco, silencing him.
“What was that?” Draco hissed, head whipping up toward the dripping ceiling.
“Your home…”
!” Harry says, raising his voice about ten octaves. You wince as his voice cracks on the word
Admit it.
“Who was it??” squeals Scorpius. “It’s me and Teddy, right??”
The entire house seems to sag. The stone walls are covered in a thick layer of black muck. The same ivy that threads through the front gates has all-but consumed the lower half of the building, making it look as though the Manor is scrabbling up from the depths of the earth. All the windows Harry can see are coated in a thick layer of dusty grime; some are broken and grimace at him like mouths full of jagged, glass teeth. The once-resplendent gardens are now buried under thick snarls of thorns and wild, venomous tentacula that wave menacingly at Harry, welcoming him. To what, he doesn’t know.
“We need two volunteers from the audience, please,” Potter said again, scanning the faces he could see with a detached expression. Finally, hands went up across the crowded room.
Draco. The one who kept his true self hidden to prevent his enemies from exploiting his vulnerabilities. The one with a fiercely protective streak and a wealth of compassion and gentleness secreted beneath his aristocratic veneer.
Draco squared his shoulders and tipped his head. “You have my word as Prince of Slytherin. I have no need to lie to the true Hogwarts champion.”
“Welcome,” he said. “How may I help?”
“Mr. Nott, this is where we must separate for a time,” Severus said in an undertone. “If you would return to the common room and inform the others that we shall return presently. There is one last stop we must make.”
Blinking out of his daze, Draco shrugged. “I developed a crush on a boy, of course. Then I spent an absurd amount of time agonizing over it in my room, and wondering why every time I thought of replacing him with Pansy, I felt nauseous. When I finally broached the topic with my mother over tea, she told me she and father already knew and didn’t care.”
“Um, Professor?” Harry asked, fiddling with the hem of his jumper. “What’s going on?”
“Thank you, Teekey,” he said with a wan smile, unable to control the embarrassed flush that crept up his neck. “Please tell Professor Snape I’m grateful.”
“Right, that’s enough,” Draco declared, crossing his arms over his chest with a scowl. “I’m certain Harry appreciates your support, but it’s been a rather long day, so kindly let the man breathe. Thank you.”
Draco's eyes widened when he realized the cloaked figure who usually occupied the canvas was absent. “Shit,” he hissed. “I’ll notify everyone to censor what is said in the common room, then.”
Outfit in hand, he snagged Draco’s sleeve as he passed and whispered in his ear, “I want everything, Draco.”
“No,” he said decisively. “I don’t want anyone to later claim someone coerced or falsified this. I want witnesses.”
“Come on. You need more sleep, but your idiot dorm mates are probably holed up in the tower. However, I have the solution to your problem,” Draco smirked, aiming to lighten the mood.
“Skipping the Samhain festivities, I see? This must be about Potter then.” He harrumphed when the boy nodded curtly. “I can’t do anything about it. It’s a magically binding contract. He’ll have to compete or forfeit his magic, though I can’t figure out how he managed to get his name in or trick the Goblet into a fourth champion.”
“Very well. You have my support—secretly, of course.” Draco exhaled in relief and Severus bit back a smile. “Approach Potter and make it known you don’t believe he put his name in the Goblet and that you intend to help him with the tasks. I’m sure I needn’t tell you to do so quietly, in case the fool tries to make a scene.”
Ginny’s freckles stood in stark relief across her ashen features. “Where is he?” she asked woodenly.
The redhead charged forward, and Harry instinctively shrank against the door, but Dean caught his shoulder before he reached him. “Don’t lie to me! Fred and George couldn’t get through, but you did.”
Clearing his throat awkwardly, Fred opened his mouth, but George answered across the room. “Well, you see, darling sister, there is also a love potion component. Which was why it was perfect for Umbridge! No one could ever love the toad and she’s brimming with hate, so there wouldn’t be a way to...wake her.”
Draco quivered with rage, his muscles twitching under his skin with the effort to remain calm. There was so much to process, he didn’t even know where to begin.
The ghost smiled. “Of course, lad. Turn left at the top of the corridor.” Ducking through the wall opposite, the friar disappeared and Harry wasted no time following his directions.
“Headmaster,” Severus said, his impatience apparent when he looked pointedly at the Hat. Dumbledore sighed, and the professor took it as permission, snatching the artefact and placing it on Harry’s head. The comfortable tingle of the Hat’s magic seeped into his mind, but its raspy voice spoke aloud, surprising everyone.
“Of course,” he said. “I plan to speak to him tomorrow after breakfast.”
Champion,” Snape drawled, his tone dripping with condescension.
“Look, I’ve lost...enough people to that bastard. I can’t...I can’t lose anymore, goddamn it.” Forcing himself to maintain eye contact with the other man through the sting of salt water, he confessed, “Not even you. Maybe...especially you.”
“Wake me for dinner,” Harry said, dropping his glasses none too gently on the nightstand.
“Your schedule, Mr. Potter,” he said, handing him a piece of parchment. “Your classes have remained the same, but a few times and days have changed.”
“Shh, Harry. I’ll speak to my parents. They’ll fix this. I know you don’t care for my father, and I can’t blame you, but he has sway in the Ministry. He can get things sorted with your relatives, alright?” Shoving aside his anger at Harry’s mistreatment, Draco poured care and compassion into him with each heartbeat. But a fresh wave of icy terror flowed through the bond and Draco shuddered.
Granger’s words echoed in his head.
Her Scottish brogue was noticeably more pronounced when she spoke. “You are demanding a re-sort, Mr. Potter? You are unhappy in your House?”
“Is that why your House took Harry in?” Cedric asked. The boys nodded and Cedric tapped his thigh with a forefinger as he ruminated on the information.
he thought, stealing glances at the blond over the rim of his glass.
Crumpling the parchment nearest her, she threw it at his head, but it arched over him and sailed into a far aisle. “No, Ronald,” she hissed. “I haven’t found anything. At this point, I’m not sure we’re going to.”
“Guys!” Harry interrupted impatiently. “I’m fine. I just needed some time to think.”
“Yes. Is...that okay? Will you accept me and any other Slytherins who do the same?” Draco asked, drumming his fingers on his knee.
Reaching for the hand nearest him, Harry laced their fingers together. “I was starting to think you’d never come.”
Peeking at him from under his arm, Draco smirked. “Hedwig is more than an owl, though. She’s your familiar. Of course, you two get along.”
Krum’s heavy brows drew together as a thought crossed his mind. “Vhy didn’t they find a...vhat do you call it?”
Pausing outside of the second-floor girl’s bathroom, Harry steeled himself for whatever he might find behind the door. An ambush, maybe? It was unlikely Malfoy reopened the Chamber since he wasn’t a Parselmouth; not that it would matter if he did, the only creature that could aid him was long dead. Still, he was a Slytherin through and through and it wouldn’t do to walk into a trap.
Guilt slammed into him when he saw Remus and Tonks alongside his parents and Sirius, hastily stammering out an apology that he wouldn’t be around for Teddy. With gentle smiles, they reassured him their son would be fine. There were plenty who would care for him in their place. While it was true, it didn’t hurt less to know he wouldn’t see his godson grow up. To know the dreams of he and Draco spending holidays with the Lupins or teaching Teddy to fly while Remus laughed in the background would never become reality.
Releasing a long breath, Harry straightened his spine and slowly closed the distance between them. “I’m doing something I should have done a long time ago,” he answered, extending a hand. Draco gaped at him in astonishment, his arm falling to his side in shock.
“No, it’s that you still harbour prejudices long antiquated.” Lucius pursed his lips under his wife’s steely glare, unable to refute the truth. “We fought a war based on such ideas and
,” Draco said, smirking when Harry shivered with the use of his given name. “Why do you need protection from Muggles?”
Resting their foreheads together, Draco whispered, “I don’t want to lose you or this. I’ve wanted it for so long.”
“Remember to crouch a bit and stick close to me, alright?” Draco promptly slouched to cover his shoes, and Harry grinned. Checking the hall for people, Harry led them from the bathroom toward the Headmaster’s office, but they were quickly waylaid.
“I thought I hated you,” he panted against Draco’s bobbing Adam’s apple, “but it turns out I really don’t, and I much prefer this to hexing you.”
“Thanks,” he mumbled, unable to meet anyone’s eye as he ran out the door.
“Yes. We know things are moving, have been for some time. The revel at the World Cup was just the beginning. This could be the next phase.”
Seeing Draco so unguarded, so
She tossed him a wicked smirk. “You may blame it on my nature if you wish, but I think most would agree it is simply who I am.”
“Definitely,” Harry replied with a smile—reassurance and a promise in one. His stomach flipped at the naked relief on Draco’s face before he took a seat with Blaise a table over.
“Oh,” Draco whispered, swallowing loudly in the deafening silence. “I nearly forgot. He’s very likely claustrophobic, so no small, enclosed spaces if you can avoid it. If you can’t, expect him to have a panic attack afterward. And no, I won’t fucking tell you why. I’m taking that lovely tidbit to the grave.”
Though, with the possibility of Harry being attracted to boys, she began surreptitiously observing likely candidates. Ernie Macmillan was a Hufflepuff, and fairly good-looking, but kind of an idiot. Anthony Goldstein or Terry Boot, maybe? They were both Ravenclaws and therefore, not stupid, but they weren’t engaging enough to catch his eye. No matter how she tried to deny it, Malfoy was at the top of the list.
“Then yes, I know exactly how you feel,” Draco said hoarsely, cupping Harry’s cheeks with shaky hands and lifting his head to meet his gaze. Pools of molten silver seared Harry in place as thumbs brushed aside his unnoticed tears with a tenderness he felt unworthy of but didn’t want to deny.
Ron swallowed hard when she fisted her robes directly over her heart. “What if there is someone he loves and we don’t know about them?” she continued. “It could be a guy for all we know, which widens the pool by an
Draco furrowed his brow but reluctantly released him, leaving his hand hanging uselessly in the air as Harry fled.
Chuckling to hide his sudden nerves as they left the kitchens, Draco said, “One thing you’ll learn about Slytherins: we protect our own. We give even honorary snakes full membership privileges.”
It was rather early to go to sleep, especially considering the nap they’d taken only a couple of hours ago, but neither Draco nor Harry had the energy to care about circadian rhythms. Sorting through his trunk for his most comfortable nightclothes, Harry plodded to the bathroom to ready himself for bed.
Scurrying to the commons, Draco collapsed in an empty armchair, limbs akimbo. Gulping air into his oxygen-deprived lungs, he tried to banish the vision of wiry muscles and emerald eyes brimming with gratitude. In all the years he’d imagined Harry looking at him similarly, he never expected it to be more than a fantasy. Of course, his friends descended on him in his moment of weakness, and he suppressed a groan.
“Harry,” Draco murmured as he arched into Harry’s hand, chasing a firmer touch. “There’s nothing to forgive. You couldn’t have prevented this any more than I could have, but you’re here now and giving me more than I dared hope for.”
Sorrowful green met tired grey and a silent apology, weighted with cursed understanding, passed between them—confirming Harry’s suspicions of Lucius Malfoy’s parenting style. His stomach twisted to know that while their experiences might be vastly different, they empathized with one another as only those who suffered could.
“Right,” Draco mumbled.
“Stay close today,” Draco murmured, the fingers of his free hand trailing along Harry’s arm, leaving fire in his wake before tangling with his. “If I’m not with you, stick with Pansy or the lads. Do not go anywhere alone.”
“I require a moment of your time. Follow me,” Severus demanded without waiting for an answer.
“Moody,” Dumbledore chided. The man curled his lip as though something stank and took an angry swig from his flask, but he reluctantly backed off as the Headmaster approached.
a Slytherin, which meant he had cunning and ambition in spades. If his “seal it with a kiss” idea didn’t pan out, he’d simply devise a long-term plan to make Harry his. Some things were worth waiting for.
Pressing their shoulders together in commiseration, Harry nodded. “I get that. So you’re making your choice then? You’re choosing to side with me?”
Smoothing his robes with a huff, Lucius snapped, “It seems you’ve decided for me.”
“I sometimes forget he was also your house-elf,” Harry snickered as he doctored his drink. “I always see your father’s face when I freed him and forget he lived at the Manor with you.”
Resting his elbows on his knees, Severus questioned how many of Harry’s supposed interactions were truly happenstance. With Dumbledore in the mix, he had a feeling the answer was zero.
It was a chaste press of lips, both too afraid of making a mistake to move them, but that didn’t stop their arms from circling each other. They parted a few seconds later, cheeks flushed and eyes wide, matching smiles blooming on their faces.
Pride bubbled in Draco’s chest and he reined in the urge to hug the stupidly brave boy. Instead, he defaulted to what they did best and shot him a playful smirk.
“You wish,
Draco waved away his objection with a scoff. “If I ever make you feel unworthy for something outside of your control, I will bloody deserve anything darling Pans sees fit to throw at me. And I’d take it without complaint.” Brushing Harry’s damp fringe across his forehead, he murmured, “Some things are special and should be treated as such.”
“Oh, Malfoy. I’m sorry,” Hermione whispered, wringing her hands in chagrin with his honesty.
“Try telling Harry that and see how well you come out of that argument,” she said dryly. “Malfoy, even if he isn’t in love with you, he
“Alright,” Draco said quietly, his stomach swooping with the boy’s admission.
Though, perhaps, that was the place to start: acknowledging that the list was far too long for a fourteen-year-old. No boy—no matter how rough and tumble—amassed such a sheer volume of injuries without “help” and he had a pretty good idea which of Harry’s relatives had been so inclined.
Vain? Perhaps. But there wasn’t anything wrong with enjoying simple pleasures or caring for the only body a person had.
Blood roared in Harry’s ears at the thought of being left alone. Images of Snape’s patronus, his uncontrolled magic in Dumbledore’s office, and everyone’s shell-shocked expressions after his medical scan cycled on a continuous loop through his head. Draco was right—a lot had happened, too much to settle himself on his own. All the heightened emotions bubbling under his skin were apt to send him spiralling without someone to ground him.
She hadn’t wanted it to work because she didn’t want to find her long-time friend was secretly in love with her. Yet part of her hated that it hadn’t, because it meant she failed him and continued to with each day that passed.
Whirling on the Headmaster in righteous fury, McGonagall snapped, “You mean to tell me that one of my lions spent a night in the kitchens, sleeping on cold stone floors, and you did nothing? You willfully neglected to inform me as his Head of House? Albus, I knew nothing of this until half an hour ago!”
“We tell my parents, first of all.” Harry opened his mouth to protest, but Draco held up an imperious hand. “No, listen to me, for once. Soulmates are not taken lightly. Our magic called to each other and marked us before we were born. That is
It was a real question, Draco knew, and when he pinned him with quicksilver eyes, he hoped Harry read the honesty in them. “Whatever you want,” Draco said, low and deep and entirely too sultry.
He wanted to argue he hadn’t put his name in the Goblet. How could he? Not even Fred and George bypassed Dumbledore’s spellwork, and they were devilishly brilliant. But the words stuck in his throat, leaving him mute and trembling under hundreds of judgemental eyes, wishing the ground would open up and swallow him.
“Well, well. The Prince of Slytherin and the Golden Boy,” Theo murmured. “Can’t say I’m all that surprised, honestly.”
They shared a glance before Draco gave her a curt bow. “Forgive me, Mother, but we were hoping to cool off in the garden pond.”
“Dobby,” Harry called politely. Draco didn’t have time to question the name before his old house-elf appeared beside them.
Dashing after Draco and ignoring the frantic calls behind him, Harry pulled out his cloak and map and set off after the git. He’d get answers today. The bastard had been shifty all year, and the term was almost over. He didn’t have time to play nice anymore.
Harry caged him against the wall with a growl and glared at him. “Fuck, no, Draco. I wouldn’t...you drive me mental, but I hope I have more self-control than that,” he said, mouthing kisses along his jaw. “You’re so fucking arrogant, so bloody pompous, but fuck if I don’t love your posh accent and your damn smirk.”
Chuckling to himself, Harry glanced around the room, noting the usual House rivalries seemed to have waned. From the moment of their arrival, Durmstrang made themselves at home with the Slytherins, while the Beauxbaton delegation favoured the Ravenclaws, but the random pops of scarlet or yellow scattered amongst the other Hogwarts tables didn’t go unnoticed. Whether it was to keep up appearances for their guests or because whoever the Goblet chose as Hogwarts Champion would represent the entire school, Harry didn’t care.
Lucius followed her gaze and swallowed hard as he observed the subtle signs of infatuation growing between his son and the boy who ended the Dark Lord. The lingering glances, the casual touches, and blushes that extended beyond a spin on a broom. Draco was smitten from their first encounter, which at the time Lucius foolishly attributed to being star-struck. Yet after a year sharing a dorm and getting into all sorts of mischief at Hogwarts, it seemed Harry reciprocated Draco’s romantic inclinations.
White-hot rage exploded out of Draco before he could contain it. Harry watched his untamed magic whip around the room in fascination, his heart tripping with delight and something else he hesitated to name. Reining in his fury with deep, measured breaths, Draco squeezed Harry’s biceps in reassurance.
“If you don’t mind removing your shoes, I’ll start with a simple scan to determine your height and weight.”
The other Champions stared at him in horror before once again erupting into three different languages. Though even Harry, with his limited knowledge of linguistics, was able to pick out a few choice words when they were repeated so vociferously.
Rattling the frame in anger, he opened his mouth to tell her off, but no sound passed his lips. Swirling his cloak behind him in a manner very similar to their professor, he stomped through the forest and out of sight. The elf turned to Severus with a too-innocent expression, sending his astonished guests into a fit of giggles.
Tapping a coin with his wand, he brought it to his lips and whispered a short phrase. She grinned when “Mione, you’re the best” circled the edge of the second Galleon. Repeating the process on the other coin, her reply of “Thank you, I concur” garnered a round of chuckles from the trio when it flashed on the first coin. Pressing the enchanted coins in his hands, she squeezed his arm and shooed him toward Dumbledore’s office.
Tracing his scar with a grimace, Harry reminded himself people had a habit of seeing what they wanted to see. The public loved putting him on a pedestal and praising his feats of daring, instead of recognizing that it was actually a reckless disregard for his life because he had no self-worth. Those who loathed him now would congratulate him in time—they always did—until then, he just had to keep a stiff upper lip. And with Slytherin House supporting him, it might be possible to survive the backlash.
Before he could reply, Harry cleared his throat and Draco immediately straightened. His forehead creased as he skimmed the boy in concern, but Harry shuffled through his inner circle with a faint smile.
The taunts on the tip of his tongue that Draco would normally let fly without remorse withered in the face of Harry’s terror. It no longer felt right to harass the boy—his soulmate—about something that made Gryffindor’s bravest lion quiver with fright.
His whisky glass froze halfway to his lips as something else niggled his brain. “Draco, have any of the Gryffindors come searching for him? Prefects? His former friends? Professor McGonagall?”
Harry spent a few quiet moments cursing the ancient magic that believed he could have a civil conversation with the Slytherin Prince; much less accept him as his soulmate.
Harry growled in frustration when Katie Bell told him she had no recollection of who passed her the necklace. He didn’t blame her for the memory lapse, but it didn’t help him narrow down the list of suspects, either.
Tears spilled across aristocratic cheeks and Harry tenderly brushed them aside. “Please, Draco, say yes. Let me keep you safe.”
“Thank you, Lily,” he said quietly.
Rita Skeeter’s smile oozed duplicity and Harry recoiled slightly, but instead of letting go, she tightened her grip and tried to pull him closer.
can’t a cursebreaker wake him up, brother dear?”
Stepping back with a nod, Cho smiled tightly. “Thank you, Professor. I’m ready to try. I hope I’m able to help.”
Terrified green eyes welled with fresh tears, and Draco’s heart clenched painfully. “Sometimes...sometimes he
Pursing his lips around a grin, he retorted, “Wouldn’t dream of it.”
Neville clicked his tongue in aggravation, and Dean rolled his eyes. “Because you’re Harry bloody Potter and rules apparently don’t apply to you,” Dean snapped. “We’ve been here from day one. Always taking a backseat to your adventures and watching the Headmaster make one excuse after another for you whenever you skive off to do whatever the fuck you’re on about.”
Severus hummed thoughtfully. “That may be, but it’s a key component. Fairies’ ethereal beauty is part of their magic and when boiled out of the wings, it imbues the potion with the signature effect the customers seek.” Toasting his godson with a good-natured smirk, he said, “Though I’m confident you’ll come up with something.”
Draco snorted. “And you call me dramatic.”
It was the ultimate betrayal.
While part of him was admittedly nervous about the students’ reaction, a larger part was excited. Most of the Slytherin classes were solo or held with Ravenclaw, though they still had Potions and DADA with Gryffindor, and Pansy glumly informed him they shared Divination with Hufflepuff, but it could be worse.
Pinning her with a calculating gaze, Draco asked, “You would be seen in public with me, Granger?”
After a brief pause, Harry faced him directly and asked, “Why are you here, Malfoy? How did you even find me?”
Hiding his pleased smile, Harry replayed their previous interactions over the years and realized most could be seen as a strange form of flirtation. He was even more startled to discover it wasn’t simply on Draco’s end, either.
“Potter...what? Have you gone mad?” Draco demanded, voice cracking in surprise.
“Gentlemen,” she intoned formally as they bid her a unified farewell.
“Please, sir,” Colin pleaded, wringing his hands. “The Headmaster says he must come. Mr. Ollivander is coming from London and —”
“Are you alright?” Draco murmured out of the corner of his mouth. Lowering his head to hide his smile at his constant attentiveness, Harry mumbled an affirmative and pointedly ignored Crabbe and Theo’s lighthearted snickers behind him.
“Don’t be,” he replied with a wan smile. “You kept your word to me. My parents are their own people and I can’t force them to leave. It’s...a hard truth, but a truth all the same.”
“Thank you, Harry,” Cedric said, clapping him lightly on the shoulder. Fleur scooped him in an overwhelmingly floral hug, still prattling in her mother tongue, while Draco and Cedric tittered behind them. When she released him at last, Harry sucked in a blessedly unscented breath and discreetly shot two fingers at Draco, which only made the boy laugh harder.
“Hmm. And were you
They shared a fleeting, timid smile as Harry shrank his cloak and stowed it in his pocket.
“What the hell did you two idiots do?”
Snape taunted him because he was envious of his father and Harry was the spitting image of a young James Potter. He’d loved Lily, and the shock of his arrival at school a few years ago must have cut deeply. While it didn’t excuse his actions toward Harry in the slightest, it explained why he did it. Which, strangely, made Snape human. He was a flawed being, but he was also capable of change.
“Before or after I eviscerated the foul man for disrespecting me?” she asked, while casually inspecting her nails.
“Because I could see how much you wanted to kiss me.” Draco’s head jerked up in astonishment and his blush trailed to his exposed chest. Rolling a shoulder in a casual shrug, Harry tore his gaze away from the intoxicating sight of Draco’s torso, and said, “And I wanted to know.”
Harry squeezed his hand. “I won’t. I may be reckless, but I’m not completely stupid. I’ve no intention of attracting any more attention than I have already.”
“Harry, I will have your new timetable ready at breakfast. Do not be late. You’ll also start your nutrition potions tonight. I’ll have Teekey deliver one while I brew a fresh supply this evening. Take it either an hour before meals so you aren’t too full to eat or an hour after, should you forget. Start with small portions at meals and work up to larger ones as your appetite naturally increases. Any questions?”
Thank you for all the love and continuing comments and kudos! You guys are the best! Hope you like the next installment. xx
Draco shivered and buried his face against his neck, dampening Harry’s shirt with saltwater at the terrifying admission of a near-death experience. He knew there had been a few such moments over the past year since Harry was always especially chatty those nights, needing Draco to distract him from the reality of war. But he had a feeling there was more to this story, though he didn’t doubt Harry would share it when he was ready.
Waving her hand airily, Narcissa replied off-handedly. “This way they have time to secure a better match for their unfortunate daughter, don’t you agree, dearest?”
Picking up his utensils with a nod, he savoured how well the richness of the duck paired with the squash and carrots. The house-elves had outdone themselves for their foreign guests and Harry couldn’t be happier.
The sentiment went unspoken, but not unsaid. Betrayed by their body language, Harry unconsciously leaned into Draco’s hand, chasing more contact which the blond gave willingly, pressing his palm flush to the centre of his chest.
She stole a peek at the best friends as they took a moment from their aerial acrobatics to breathe. Harry’s hands gesticulated wildly as he talked and Draco’s shoulders shook with mirth, knees knocking whenever the wind shifted them.
“What just happened?” Draco whispered dazedly.
The sound of his voice was all it took to snap Harry out of his stupor and send him running. Uncaring of the tears streaking through the dirt and blood on his face or the wands directed at the blond in the doorway, he launched himself in Draco’s arms with a cry of joy.
Swallowing hard, Draco settled on the bed and took his limp hand in his own. Tears pricked his eyes when there was no response to his touch, no sign that Harry knew or cared he was there.
“Gentlemen,” Severus said, finally announcing his presence. Pity flashed across his features for the briefest moment to see tear tracks on Harry’s cheeks when they parted. He pretended not to notice as the boys hastily dried their faces and scourgified the wet spots on their clothes.
“It’s okay. I’m not angry,” Harry murmured, squeezing his hand in reassurance. Draco tried to free himself, too ashamed to accept his comfort, but Harry tightened his grip and tugged their joined hands in his lap.
Closing his eyes to stem the fresh wave of tears welling in them, he covered his face with his hands when they spilled their banks. A sick sense of dread weighed down his heart, knowing that on top of all that Harry suffered at the hands of his relatives, he was unaware he housed a piece of the Dark Lord’s soul.
Is this what his life would’ve been like if he’d let the Sorting Hat have its way? Did he really belong with them? Had he made a mistake choosing Gryffindor because of prejudicial remarks about an entire House? He was eleven when he decided, and he couldn’t say for certain anymore he made the right choice.
“I don’t know,” Harry muttered self-consciously. “I think Muggles make a big deal about it because of religion, but I’m atheist, so I can’t say for certain.”
“Dumbledore,” Harry declared firmly, though Draco didn’t miss the disappointment flickering across his face with the abrupt shift of objective.
“Thank you,” she sighed, leaning briefly into Blaise’s comforting side hug.
Shrugging half-heartedly, he said, “You might feel that way, but does Harry? How can you be sure? What if the reason he hasn’t said anything is that he doesn’t want to ruin anything between you two?”
The students listened in awe as the man widely believed to be cold and callous emerged in a new light. Harry studied the professor closely, recalling what Draco said about Snape helping discover who put him in the line of fire. It made sense that like the younger Slytherins, there might be more to him underneath his public persona, and he supposed Snape couldn’t be all bad if he had Draco’s respect as a surrogate father.
of us. I care not for your personality clashes and petty squabbles. You can hash them out in your own time, in the privacy of our common room. But out there”—he waved his arm to indicate the castle at large—“we guard our own. Remember, travel in pairs or large groups;
“As your friend, I feel you should tell me why you slept in the kitchens instead of your dorm. It’s only fair since I poured my heart out to you, after all,” Draco said, unable to disguise the worry tugging the corner of his mouth into a subtle frown as he released him.
