Discussing with Draco was one of the things Harry loved to do when he wasn't with his mistress, Arabelle. Really, Harry truly admired Draco's brain, which had many unique solutions to all the questions he asked.
For starters, Draco planned to dip his long legs into the river. Draco's hands moved to lift his simple dress a little high so the river water wouldn't get it.
The door opened, and Alden entered. "Ready?" The cold-faced bodyguard raised his eyebrows slightly at Draco's appearance, but his face remained flat. "Master Harry is waiting downstairs."
Draco immediately withdrew his hand in panic. Will Harry, in his dream, turn into wicked Harry again in the real world? Apparently not, Harry, in this dream, is very gentle and full of kindness. The man took Draco's finger and put it back on his cheek.
Ares didn't respond other than taking a sip of his wine. He let Aphrodite rest in his arms, but his thoughts were focused on Draco. He still remembered the last time they met where the young man had rejected him. He remembered the frightened expression on his young wife back then when he was acting mean toward him. Ares regretted it a little and until now was reluctant to talk with Draco.
Cedric smirked at the question. Without saying anything, Cedric immediately moved to slam his ass on Draco's side. Quickly, it made Draco pursed his lips in annoyance.
“Ssshh… All parts of your body are mine, Draco. Mine." Harry moved downwards, his breath warm against Draco's hole, where it immediately made Draco moan with pleasure. The pretty blonde squeezes his legs even more so that they clutched Harry's head, which was sinking underneath. Licking, tasting, and sucking the lips of his puckered hole.
Draco wasn't bothered at all to hear Aphrodite visit Ares. He had known for a long time that they were a cheating partner. After all, Draco had no particular feelings for Ares. It's just that inviting a mistress to attend a wedding sounds very insensitive and stupid. But the young man was reluctant to bother criticizing, let alone protesting. What interested Draco now was the contents of Eros' leather bag.
Waiting for Luna as long as Draco waited for himself to fall asleep. It seemed like eternity. Luna is Draco's best friend on campus. They both took the same major, the History of Mythology. Sometimes Draco likes to laugh to himself when listening to their professors talk about mythology while knowing that they are real. And most of those who majored in the History of Mythology were mythological creatures themselves.
"King of Sparta, you chose the hard way. Yet you could have parted on amicable terms. We accept your challenge. What is clear is that you must remember that God Ares will not side with Sparta in your war this time."
Thank you for reading. I hope you guys enjoyed the chapter! Kudos and comments are always appreciated <3
If only he had forgotten about Draco's condition, he might have drawn his sword right at the neck of his ungrateful cousin. He ignored the words that just came out of Cedric's mouth. The king chose to step closer to Draco, who was in Cedric's arms.
"Hmm, how should I explain this… Let's just say we have a long history. You can study it later. Ares Palace also has a library. However, the books may be dusty because the occupants hardly ever go there. Our history here begins with Kronos, who arrived with thousands of Titans about four thousand years ago," Argus said.
The two of them stood face to face, the air between them extremely tense. Silent and hushed, only two eyes staring at each other and challenging each other.
He took vegetables, beef, and eggs. Then he made a lump of meat stir fry with vegetables and a fragrant egg. After pouring the aromatic dish from the pan, Draco poured the hot tea he had brewed this morning into a white cup and put everything on the table. While eating his food, Draco turned on his laptop.
"Oh, you want a kiss?" Ares brought his face closer, but Draco reflexively dodged. "You're avoiding me?" He frowned.
"Nothing. I'm not the type of guy who likes to take advantage of cornered people," Terence replied while shrugging his shoulders nonchalantly.
"We can't talk about things like that here," Draco glanced at a guard standing not far from them. Although the guard was standing with a straight face, he had no interest in Cedric and Draco's business. They knew if the guard was eavesdropping on something that might stir up the gossip world of the members of the nobility.
Draco seemed to blink a few times when he heard Cedric's suggestion. "Yes, of course." The answer was a little confusing.
Draco was embarrassed. How else? It was that feeling that now engulfed him. If Alden's words were true... and they seemed to be the truth... then Draco should be ashamed. All of his grudges all this time, his thoughts all this time, his anger all this time, and his hatred all this time were all built on entirely wrong perceptions. And Harry never even defended himself with all Draco's cursing and accusations.
As Draco descended the stairs, all eyes were on him until Draco felt his hands sweat. His eyes looked around for Harry, but the man didn't seem to be around. Nervous, feeling isolated in the crowd, Draco stood still in the corner of the room near a window, choosing to observe rather than mingle.
racehorse from Turkmenistan, who was famous for being tough. However, he was also over fifty years old, and when he opened his mouth, one could see sharp fangs lined there. Herion eats meat and hates vegetables.
Hearing Draco's reply, Harry turned his head and stopped in his tracks. Obviously, the Alpha was shocked.
For a split second, Charles couldn't take his eyes of admiration away from Draco's beautiful, understated face. Ah, how lucky Harry was to have a spouse as beautiful as Draco. If Charles had sent his proposal letter to the Malfoy patriarch a month earlier, Draco would have been by Charles’s side by now.
"Thank you, Your Royal Highness. You also look very handsome tonight. I'm sure you make many people swoon with your good looks."
It's been nearly two weeks since Draco has been locked up in this white room, not allowed to come out at all. Draco spent his days gazing out of the second-floor window to Harry's yard. Draco was already feeling sick and frustrated with being bored. Harry never revisited Draco after Draco insisting on escaping that night.
Draco's body jumped a little in surprise. He lifted his head and looked at a tall, muscular man who was looking at him from a distance. Draco straightened up as the man walked closer to the spot where he was standing.
Draco clenched his jaw when he saw his father walking back in his seat with a smug look on his face.
"God, you're so kind-hearted, Your majesty. I've never found any person who has a heart as big as yours. In fact, I still remember, when my former empress was still alive, she always tried to pour poison on every concubine I brought into the palace."
A moment ago, he was standing on the side of the road, waiting for the lights for pedestrians to turn green, then in a second, he was hit by a car. He circulated his eyes around the room, thinking that is he dead? Is this the appearance of heaven? That looks like a fancy and magnificent palace?
But on the other hand, Draco was afraid. He was too scared to look at the future that might be chaotic.
At breakfast, Draco didn't talk as much as usual. Maybe it's still awkward. It would have been better if last night he had not said such pleasantries.
"Let him go, Hyde." Harry's voice sounded cold, trying to contain his anger under control. The man was holding the knife near Draco. He didn't want Draco to get hurt more than this.
The tall man smiled with a strange gentleness. Draco didn't know what happened to him, that there was only one way to heal Draco from his pain, and he needed Harry for that. Harry leaned over and brushed their lips gently, finding the beautiful eyes widen in surprise. Harry couldn't help smiling. It was incredible. The combination of innocence and intense passion really fascinated him.
Draco finally took his eyes off the Gryffindor table and glared back at Pansy with annoyance. He felt like throwing the rest of the soup at Pansy's smirking face.
"It's not that easy Draco, remember that I'm a pretty strong man. If you're nice, I'll be nice to you, but if you challenge me, I'll probably hurt you." With one hand still around Draco, the man grabbed Draco's chin and forced a hot kiss on his lips. "When I say you have to shower with me, then you will." Harry pushed Draco into the white marble-tinted bathroom.
Flames burned in Harry's eyes, and it was clear the man was trying to hold back. "Whatever, meet me in my study room later." His voice was more like a growl, then turned back furiously.
Alden immediately shook his head at Draco's question. "No. There is no command from master Harry. Even master Harry seems to keep all this from you," Alden smiled. "I'm just thinking of the ways. Given his temper, he won't explain anything to you. Maybe he will kidnap you again and force his marriage with you. I am only preparing you if that really happens.”
"Woah, this is so beautiful, Your Majesty!" the sound of Arabelle's shriek that was now beside him suddenly startled Draco. Despite his surprise, Draco didn't give Arabelle an annoyed expression.
Unable to contain it, a tear fell from the corner of Draco's eye. Shouldn't a queen like himself feel in love? Even to fall in love with his husband, everything seems complicated now.
"Yes, Goddess of Beauty." The prince nodded his head. He had been preparing for this since a few days ago. He didn't want to be antagonized by Aphrodite so that he would be nice to her. He gets advice from some of the Titans in the palace as well as Hadreda.
He nodded his head hesitantly to answer Arabelle's question with a fine frown still on his forehead.
"You give me gifts too often, even when it's not my birthday, so there's no need." Draco stared at Luna's book, which was full of scribbles. "What are you drawing?" Draco saw a picture of a man with both wings and horns in Luna's book.
"Then explain what you mean by using me as a bet, Prince Cedric? Have you forgotten who I am?" Draco glared.
Draco's body suddenly lost its passion, leaving only anger and heartache. Vlad imagines someone else while having sex with him, and that somehow hurt Draco's heart.
Draco reached into his pocket and found his cell phone as intact as before. He started to cross the street and call Luna. When his call was picked up, Draco asked Luna to meet him at their usual meeting place.
"Your Majesty!" called Draco in a slightly high voice so Harry could hear it, even though it sounded impolite, especially since the man was a king.
Ares led Hera to a closed room and asked Alastair to stand guard outside with his wife. By now, Draco had put his ear to the door, but he couldn't hear anything. Disappointed at not being able to listen to the drama that seemed to be exciting, he sat down on a granite bench at the front of the room, propping his chin up. He yawned because he was bored and sleepy. At the same time, he was worried that Ares would be angry if he went to his room first. Draco still had a hard time understanding Ares's fickle temperament.
Alden fell silent. Actually, he wanted to change his duty of delivering breakfast to a maid, but he knew very well not to disobey his master's direct orders. Based on his master's sudden good mood and satisfied look, Alden was very much aware of what happened last night in this room. Thank you very much.
The prince furrowed his brow in confusion. He was sure that the jewelry was deliberately given to him. The tame vulture was indeed someone's pet.
"At this point, the situation will be a little dangerous, Prince of Sparta. You must not be separated from Attica for whatever reason. Do you understand?"
Draco had permission from Ares to use the kitchen. Only for the next two days. That was because Draco had already agreed to prepare a dinner attended by some of Ares' close relatives. To announce their marriage.
Some of Harry's bodyguards ran towards him with panicked faces and short of breath. "Mr. Potter, Draco is running away from the hospital!!"
Had Draco said that Cedric was the most feared knight in this kingdom? Although his ability was still below Harry's, Cedric's brilliance on the battlefield can not be doubted.
When he spoke, everyone would think he was singing. When he smiled mysteriously, he would make other people who saw him smile too.
"Ares doesn't want to talk to me or see me. Our last meeting ended in a small fight. I'm pretty sure he'll dump me soon," Draco smiled bitterly.
At that time, the King agreed and did not think long. He and the rest of the palace were sure that Troya would not survive. Even though everyone said a poisonous snake bit him—no antidote could cure him. The King took the risk and gave the medicine to his son.
"Accident?" Draco tried to remember everything, but his last memory only reached Harry's scream and the man's tight embrace before it all went dark.
His legs walked on their own to enter the blue flower garden. He couldn't help but smile happily as he watched his feet sink between the blue flowers that looked so fresh. His slender hand moved to brush the tiny blue flowers he could reach.
"Put it on. This is an order," Harry seemed to be starting to get annoyed that Draco hadn't received the clothes.
Alden bowed, and he walked out of the room. Harry then proceeded to get back on his papers for a while. He'll check on Draco when he's done. Harry couldn't wait to carry out the plan he had prepared to conquer his lover.
Cedric turned silent. He did not answer Harry's words because the prince knew that he was the wrong one here.
Even though Draco smiled and looked fine, Natalie could tell that the young man had his own concerns. Whether it was his husband or his mistress or the kingdom or whatever, Natalie didn't want her husband to make things worse.
"What are you waiting for, Draco? Why are you still standing?!" Harry asked in an extremely annoyed tone when he saw Draco put the ointment in his hand onto Harry's desk and stand next to Arabelle.
Draco heard a noise from the kitchen. He knows that his mother must be making breakfast because his mother always gets up first.
. Draco's mind raged. So without thinking, Draco ran towards the window to jump. It was quite a distance and made him slip. He ran as fast as he could, and the man was suddenly in front of him.
"No, of course not. Don't the priests at your temple tell the truth? When a god comes to their lover mostly, it's because they like each other. We don't kidnap or rape. There may have been some before, but believe me, we're all more mature and wiser."
The boy understood, there had to be more effort to build a real bond with Ares. He had to make sure that Ares wouldn't dump him so easily. "I thought you didn't want to talk to me anymore," Draco whispered.
Draco vomited a lot of water and coughed in pain. His lungs were still aching and throbbing. Who is the helper? Was he really not allowed to die? The strong hand continued to press until all the liquid was pumped out of his stomach. Draco's eyes grew blurry, his consciousness fading away as the voice sounded calm above him.
Draco sealed his lips tightly and nodded. He couldn't do anything else. Then the man removed his hand from Draco's mouth. "Are you a kidnapper?" Draco asked.
If he goes back to that house, then his chances to escape will disappear, Draco thought frantically. He can't go back to that house! Draco impulsively grabbed his head, pretending to be in pain.
"I'm going back to the office. Oh yes, Hermione greets you," with a dazzling smile, Ron gave a friendly wink, then turned and walked out of the lobby.
Draco's eyes widened. Price?! What is this guy talking about?! His eyes darted to the glass of Harry's poisoned drink on the table. Everything fell apart
Draco was stunned and blinked when he realized that his eyes were fixated on the beauty of Harry's muscular and tough body. Slender but manly, and all so in proportion to its place as if God created this man with a smile.
He was immediately greeted by tall pillars and a huge statue of the Goddess Athena when he was inside. There was still the smell of fragrance there because this temple was never devoid of ritual offerings. Draco saw Oracles blessed with longevity and wisdom from the gods sitting around. Occasionally they will convey a prophecy or message from the gods to humans who stop by.
When the others had started to get off their horses and pulled over to take shelter under the shady trees in the forest, Draco was still sitting on his horse. His silver eyes stared blankly at Harry, helping Arabelle get off the horse.
With slow, calculated movements, Alden mixed the plain, white powder into Draco's drink. This medicine will make the long-haired man torment and asking for satisfaction. If nothing satisfied him, the blonde would feel his whole body burning in pain, and Alden was sure Draco would plead or even beg for his master tonight.
Ron and Harry didn't say much on the way back to the packhouse. Harry propped his elbows against the windshield, his eyes examining the streets and buildings that seemed to dart in the opposite direction as the car he was driving slashed through the slightly deserted streets.
Draco closed his eyes and tried to enter the dream world. Harry remained in the room and saw Draco seemed fast asleep on the big bed. The young man’s breath seemed to be regular, made Harry dare to get up from his seat.
Draco is standing in front of one of the musical instrument shops. Then he entered and was greeted by the shop owner.
That sentence made Draco's head suddenly feel heavy. The words Cedric had just said disturbed Draco's composure.
Starategos was the position currently held by Hector. He was a respected general of war and often gave brilliant results in ground battles. Sparta was a country known to have a strong military. Currently, they were still at war with Thebes and their allies. In contrast, the city of Athens was more often neutral.
"You see that? One bit I threw you down, the poolside tiles could shatter your head," Harry muttered with anger. “You don't know how to be grateful. It would be best if you thanked me for my kindness to you and your family so that you can still live until now. Do you know that I can easily take your life whenever I want?!"
Harry shook his head. "It would break his heart," Harry quickly changed the subject. "The doctor says he has to be here in a week. You arrange the guard here, don't let anyone get off guard. Only Draco's special doctor and nurse can enter the room, instruct everyone." Harry then walked away, and Alden just stared at his master.
Draco looked back at the driver. "Ah yes, sorry. I'm getting into character for a drama this weekend," he lied so the driver wouldn't think Draco was a lunatic for talking alone.
The glass of the poisoned drink was already on Harry's table, and soon Harry was going to die from asphyxiation. Before Draco could get up, Harry grabbed his fingers and pulled them hard so that he sat down again. This time on Harry's lap.
Ron caught Harry's tossed car key with ease. The Beta knew Harry was limiting himself from driving—except in certain urgent situations.
"No, we just haven't been in a situation like this before. This is probably the first time the Titans have taken humans to Olympus. Usually, gods like Apollo, Zeus, or Ares come to their own lovers. This is their personal business," Attica replied.
Draco gasped, enduring the pain and fear as the cold iron stuck to his neck. Its sharp coating had slashed through his neck, causing a slight sting there.
After learning the painful truth, Draco decided to go home. He couldn't stay in that big room that made him felt breathless any longer. Draco didn't want Alden to pity him any further either. Now, Draco walked out blankly while holding his stomach. Even though his pregnancy was still too young, he was still afraid that it would affect the fetus if his condition were severe.
Although Harry could continue his enjoyment, the sight of Draco's orgasm and Draco's throbbing hole squeezing him, deep inside, made him unable to hold back anymore. Before he could help it, Harry exploded his desire to join Draco in a sullen pleasure.
After Draco grabbed the slightly oversized outfit, Harry didn't turn around. Oh, of course, Draco couldn't possibly ask the man to turn around so Draco could freely wear the clothes. By the way, the man had already shown his authority as a ruler.
Draco, who had studied pharmacy in one of his roles as an actor and was interested in the herbal lifestyle, could recognize some of the spices that Eros had just harvested.
Draco knew that all the attention was weighing him down. Because Troy does not have the same feelings, his father forbids him to be close to Hector. He knew that the king had to have someone watch over them from afar. Even though Draco was walking with a stalker—he wasn't too worried.
Harry saw how the look of concern was evident on Cedric's face. The king clenched his fists tightly. His ego was somewhat hurt when he saw his wife being hugged by his own cousin.
"Maybe. There is another way to make him a Titan without having a god to guarantee him. That is if he can adapt among the Titans. He had to prove that he could be quite useful on Olympus. Not only as your sleeping partner, Ares." Hera said with a slight smirk on her pretty face.
Sparta has often been dominated by men who were firm, disciplined, and tough. They were stiff and serious. Even the behavior spread to the men who were also members of the council. Sparta was different from Athens and Thebes, whose lives were still colored by music, artists, and poets. Such a thing was rare in Sparta. Troya became a kind of anomaly in the palace environment. The people liked him, and the King felt the atmosphere of Sparta was warmer since Troya's birth.
"Yours tastes good." He stared into Draco's still foggy eyes. His tongue moistened his lips. "I wonder if your blood will be this delicious too."
When Daphne dressed him up, Draco was too tired to make even the slightest disobedience. He didn't even ask anything earlier when Alden escorted Daphne to his room, and the woman suddenly dressed him.
Draco was still stunned in bed, then a flash of pain in his buttocks brought him to life. The bloodstain was striking on the white sheet, seeming to laugh at him. How ironic, his virginity was snatched away by the devil-hearted bastard he wanted to kill. Draco's body trembled, filled with a choking mix of feelings as he tried to stand up.
"I heard that you said you wanted to marry a prince, and I just found out that the prince is my devoted follower. What's your plan, Ares?" Athena probed.
"Yes, my Queen. I've been thinking about it for the past decade, and I know that I can't forever be the king of the gods. Leadership regeneration is needed for the titan race." Zeus said seriously.
Moreover, the young man's face was beautiful, and his mind and heart were also very beautiful. Perhaps, this was what prompted Draco's parents to charge Harry such a high dowry so that he could marry Draco.
"You haven't answered my question, Seraphim." Harry turned and looked at Draco, who was thinking. "What are you?" he asked.
Blaise fell silent for a long time, digesting Pansy's simple explanation, which he had difficulty understanding. Pansy even went so far as to explain some other evidence so that Blaise quickly got to the point.
Draco was thoughtful for a moment, watching the other boy's hands still grasping his. "Just so you know," Draco finally began to reply, "As friends, Pansy and Blaise have given their blessing," Draco frowned in disbelief. "Because of my stupidity, they know if I... I like you... too,"
"Of course, Your Royal Highness." Draco reached out with a slow but steady motion to take the crown prince's hand, but before Draco actually managed to land his hand on the palm, a firm hand suddenly grabbed his hand.
A man is walking towards him. The tall, athletic-looking emerald-green man made Draco gawk at him. His black hair was neatly combed back, making his already charming figure very hard to resist the eye. The man with thick eyebrows and stern jaw now stood in front of Draco, observing Draco intensely and making him blush.
With a sudden gesture, Harry pulled his body away from Draco and stared at him tensely. “Tomorrow, Daphne will help pack your clothes, and Alden will drive you home.”
"You are in your palace, my prince. You have slept for ten days, and everyone was worried." Draco was told by a young woman dressed in a simple light dress that seemed just to be wrapped around like a scarf. Draco remembered seeing such clothing in ancient Greek paintings.
Draco sighed tiredly to see his beloved son's room falling apart again with all kinds of dolls and toys scattered on the floor.
A happy smile graced Arabelle's face as soon as she heard Draco's words. This trip was Arabelle's first trip after she entered this magnificent palace. Really, Arabelle didn't think that she could spend time with Harry on her first trip.
Actually, the book was a novel. Not an adult novel! The book was a beautiful romance novel. Draco doesn't know when he was interested in reading romance novels, which gradually brainwashed him, maybe, since Glenice introduced adult novels that contained romantic stories.
Ares slightly frowned upon hearing that. "Are you sure you want to do what they do? Because I believe your father never let you do any of that in Spartan palace. I can prepare many servants for you to make your life as comfortable as your old house," He confirmed.
"Lawyer? What for? I'm not involved in any legal matters," Draco was still peeking through the door, not wanting to open it. He looked at Seamus suspiciously.
The current king of Sparta was a worshiper of Deimos, one of the sons of the God of War. He was a god of fear who was believed to give strength to soldiers who believe they can transform into monsters on the battlefield. But his high respect for the God of War and his children could not reduce the king’s intention to keep Troya in his palace.
Draco turned his head and stared in awe at the man who possessively wrapped his arm around Hermione's waist. He was handsome, with red hair, sky blue eyes, and pale skin. Hermione didn't seem to be kidding when she said that her husband was exceptionally handsome.
"Why were you sleeping there?" Ares looked a little disappointed when he found his young wife sleeping on the floor.
And as if Alden did not suspect him, the man approached and looked at Draco, "You want help to the bathroom?"
Draco's face suddenly turned pale. Worry overtook him. Cedric was well aware of that. The other man's brain moved quickly to think of a way out they should take at this time.
All the guards clapped loudly when they saw Cedric draw his sword from the guard's neck. Cedric walked with a crooked smile towards him. The prince let the tip of his sword graze the battle area coated with rough cement.
"Get out of the way!" Ares said. He had to be a bit louder if he wanted to communicate with the Cyclops. They were big, scary, and so strong. They could uproot trees and their roots with their bare hands. But they were stupid.
Harry wasn't the type of king to shut his ears to the news that spread around his kingdom. Harry knew for sure about the public secret that his wife was the perfect among all the people in this kingdom.
Prang! The sound of clashing two irons filled the void created in the area. All the guards stared in amazement at Draco, who could easily lift a sword that was quite heavy for a slender build like him.
Now, he has learned to understand that not everything he thinks is good will always be good and will not hurt him. Draco had begun to volunteer to let go of what he had always dreamed of; Harry wants to change and be a better man to be with him.
"Perhaps this is a trick of the man who wants Troya as his wife. You know yourself that you have rejected dozens of proposals from nobles, governors and princes, and even kings from neighboring countries. It is not impossible that a man planned all this. Do you remember the Oracle who brought the medicine? He's too young and handsome to be an Oracle!" An adviser to the King added.
Draco walked briskly. He knew that walking fast wouldn't allow him to avoid the werewolf chasing him. So, when he reached the end of the road, Draco started sprinting. Harry, who was at first in front of him, was now behind him. Draco ignored the man and kept running.
Draco started cleaning up the spilled cereal, and when it was all clean, he poured the cereal back into the new bowl. Harry was still watching him, and Draco acted as if he didn't exist. So Draco started turning on the tv and watching his favorite movie.
For some time tonight, Draco sighed again roughly. His head already starting to get heavy from thinking about it. He lifted his face again to look up at the sky, but unfortunately, before he could enjoy the beauty, his eyes were locked on the figure of a man who was standing stiffly in front of his tent while hovering his piercing gaze at him.
Harry's jaw immediately tightened when he heard the words of the girl on his lap. In fact, that man's hands are already tightly clenched. "Just watch. I'm going to shoo those maids away and exile them into conflict territory," Harry hissed.
"I'm fine, father," Draco answered gracefully. He started to guess when the emcee would appear and end this prank? He just realized, if this was a television prank, there must be a camera. He was also worried that his appearance and makeup would be wrong to invite protests from his fans. "Where is the mirror?" he whispered to the young woman who seemed to be always beside him.
Draco woke in the morning to a light shuffling sound and a sizable pain radiating from his tailbone. Harry was standing next to the bed, slowly dressing in his expensive clothes. Draco groaned in bed, making Harry realize that the blonde had awakened from his deep sleep.
"This guitar is the best. It has a nice and clear sound." The shop owner pointed to a guitar beside Draco. "It's 250 Pounds Sterling."
After a few moments, Cedric sat up straight. The man's hand moved gently to tug at one of Draco's currently intertwined hands. He gently stroked the back of the blonde’s hand. Cedric wanted to send a warm feeling on Draco's soft, cold hand.
All eyes stared at the pair with admiration, all ladies looked at the King's handsomeness, and all gentleman looked at Draco's incredible beauty.
Draco felt his hand hurt a little. The female messenger dressed as an Amazonian warrior apologized to him several times. Draco was amazed at how calmly she was facing the dozens of male soldiers while still protecting himself. Apparently, she's not perfect. A spear tip hit her shoulder because she was off guard. Like zombies smelling blood—the soldiers immediately focused on her and attacked her.
Hermione touched Ron's arm again, reminding him, then looked at Draco apologetically. "Gossip spreads fast, even among men," she whispered to Draco, asking for understanding.
This morning, Harry slammed the glass on the table so that the wine was scattered and stained the white tablecloth, simply because the drink didn't match his taste. He called Alden and yelled at him because some of the bodyguards weren't on guard at the front gate.
"Yes. But this place is many times more beautiful and awesome when I bring the person I like with me here." Cedric shifted his gaze from the blue flower bed in front of him to Draco's beautiful face.
"And he just agreed? Wow, you have a submissive wife, Ares. I'm guessing he's quite pleasant in bed," Aphrodite commented sarcastically.
Draco arrogantly cocked his chin. "Yes, I love to read, but the expensive books here are among the ones I cannot afford," Draco frowned.
"You won't! You're mine! You've been mine since the first time you set foot here." Vlad clenched his fists and gritted his teeth. "Listen. I won't let you go even if I have to break your legs. I don't care!"
Harry smiled at Draco's behavior. “You're like a scared rabbit again, Draco. Are you afraid that I will do something evil? Like mixing drugs in your drink or throwing you off the balcony again?" Harry grinned, put down his glass, and stood up, getting closer and closer to Draco.
"May I have your first dance of the night, Your Majesty?" asked the crown prince of the Delion Kingdom politely as he bowed and held out one hand to Draco.
"No, of course not, Your Majesty. But... instead of wasting useless time here, wouldn't it be better for Your Majesty to sleep with Arabelle? That girl has nightmares very often." Draco said smoothly, which made a fine frown on Harry's forehead.
When he got to the front of the campus building, Draco paid for his taxi and brought his guitar. In ten minutes, the class was about to start, but Draco ran to the toilet before heading to class. Harry really pissed him off. He seemed to want to share his sadness with Draco, and Draco could feel the sadness. Draco also didn't know why.
"I've lived too long as a presentation in the palace of Sparta, even though my life is short, but I hope to have a different experience while living in Olympus," Draco showed his manners and once again looked back and saw Ares' face which turned even.
Draco felt sorry because the real Troya didn't get to experience all of this. Their relationship was simple. Ares was just curious about the most beautiful Greek prince and married him. The prince's only job was to please him, at least not to make him angry that he had to kick him out of the palace.
Draco took a deep breath as he stood right in front of the large door made of high-quality wood. The door also gives off an extraordinary luxurious impression. It can be seen from the intricate carvings on the door, which were filled with gold ink.
Zeus leaned back and scratched his chin. His eyes were filled with anger and disappointment. The beard and mustache on his face were a sign that he was a senior generation of the Titan race that was more than four thousand years old because he didn't age like the rest of the Titan race. There was a faint wrinkle on his forehead, but it was not due to aging but a manifestation of the burden of his thoughts for thousands of years leading the Titans.
As long as he stepped into the area where Cedric would fight, all the guards' eyes never left Draco for a second. The way the queen walked firmly, the way he stared intently, the way he kept a small smile, he was truly a blessing to this kingdom.
Ares then took the prince slightly away and whispered to him. "Are you sure? You show weakness in front of them. It's okay to be a little tough here. You may need to do it so they will respect you." Ares advised him.
Harry stared at Draco as dull as ever, but his eyes seemed to show disappointment. Was Draco a precious little toy for him? Of course, Draco wouldn't want to be treated that way. Therefore, it was better for Draco not to have anything to do with him anymore.
"Looks like it's a member of the royal family. Draco, you should just keep walking here and act like you normally would."
When Doctor Jason left, Draco was stunned. Doctor Jason's story confused him. Was it all true that Harry was so worried about his safety? Draco's thoughts were distracted by realizing that he wasn't currently locked up in Harry's heavily fortified house. He was now in a public area, a hospital, which meant his chances of escape were even greater.
Draco's heart skipped a beat when he heard that very sexy voice. Draco suddenly turned his head and stared in horror at the source of the voice. "Your Majesty?!" Draco half-screamed and tucked the vulgar book in a hasty motion under his pillow.
"So how about it, Your Majesty? You won't let them down, will you?" Cedric pointed to several guards. They seemed to be placing their high hopes on Cedric.
As long as Draco looked around the place, he could only catch a bed of blue flowers that looked very soothing to the eyes. Not only amazing, but the area also looks unique because, between the expanse of blue flowers that were very soothing to the eyes, there was also a shady green tree.
Draco carried out his threat. He's on a hunger strike. On the first day, Harry still underestimated Draco's childish threats and laughed at him. But it's been almost two days now, and Alden was reporting that Draco hasn't touched his food and drink at all.
"That's your money," Alden interrupted quietly. "It's your stock of your father's company that master Harry has taken over."
"I just found out that Your Royal Highness has a habit of eavesdropping and stalking other people," Draco said as he tried to act as casual as possible.
The film wasn't exactly a success, but Draco had learned a lot about Greek mythology while playing it. Draco knew one thing about the Gods of Olympus. They were generally selfish and immoral beings. Unfortunately, Troya, the Prince of Sparta, had the bad luck to be presented to the evil God of Olympus, Ares.
Cedric gripped Draco's soft hand tightly in his. Happy smiles constantly graced Cedric's handsome face because, at last, the brunette could find the person who had stolen all of his attention.
"Take care of him," Harry ordered quickly, then his attention was completely focused on Draco. As if he didn't care about his palm cut deeply, Harry untied Draco's hands, and the young man immediately fell into his embrace.
"As I said before, if I find you, you will never be able to run from me again. I will never let you go."
Why did that man save him? It was a question he couldn't answer. Over the years, Draco cultivates hatred in his heart, cultivating a deep sense of revenge, with the knowledge that the evil Potter has destroyed his family. Yes, Harry is evil. But apart from locking Draco up, he treats Draco well.
Draco took a deep breath. Harry glanced at Draco with a questioning look, but Draco ignored him and entered the classroom. Draco thought for a moment. Wouldn't it be great if Harry showed himself? Because if any girl were attracted to him, they would definitely try to get close to Harry. And Draco could bring that person over to Harry's house even before ten days.
"Mr. Potter's most current lover," said Daphne dryly. “Ah, you don't know, right, everyone's talking about you. In fact, your name has appeared on several gossip tabloids and gossip shows, which discuss Harry Potter's mysterious newest lover. They are guessing and looking for evidence that you two have sex. They are curious about how two men are having sex. That's why the assistants were giggling while checking your sheets."
"You seem to like reading," Harry's voice startled Draco. He turned his head and just realized that Harry was sitting in the corner of the room, at his large desk and studying his company papers. The man was looking at him with his green eyes gleaming sharp.
"Not interested? Really? Even Aphrodite admits it. He is... pretty much okay," Aphrodite admitted reluctantly.
Draco was stunned. They all don't know what really happened. Draco is not Harry's lover. He lived in this house not as Harry's lover, but more like a prisoner. Draco was kidnapped and abused by that most-wanted bachelor.
Silence greeted Draco and Cedric. Only the sound of the wind and the rustling of leaves could be heard. He was busy admiring the beauty in front of him until he felt Cedric staring intently at his face from the side. He turned his head to look at Cedric.
"Well, I think I like you, little boy. Do you want to learn from me? I'll teach you everything about how to please a guy. When it comes to Ares, I can teach you more than that. You know what I mean," Aphrodite smirked.
"I want hi—" Harry's words stopped, but then he was pointing at the woman. "I want her." The words were spoken in a calm, lazy tone, but the echo could be heard throughout the room.
Draco's personal maid, Glenice, gasped in surprise. Glenice stared at Draco with wide eyes and shook her head firmly. "Of course not, Your Majesty. A lowly servant like me doesn't deserve to ignore a queen in my own kingdom."
"This isn't interesting. I thought the boy would stupidly come up to us and try to snatch you or something like your previous lovers," Aphrodite commented again.
Cedric directed his hand to tuck Draco's hair that seemed to come out of his hair tie because of the naughty wind in this place. Cedric brought his hands to cup Draco's face after ensuring the hair was no longer covering his beautiful face.
"How dare you embarrass Alden like that, and how dare you try to run away from my house," Harry's big hand gripped Draco's arm roughly and dragged Draco, who was trying to escape.
That's how Draco felt. The feeling made Draco tighten his grip on Cedric's strong hand. Abruptly, Cedric's stopped. A frown crossed Draco's face when he saw the spot where the other had stopped.
There were no surgical marks on his body. Although there was a piece of logic in his mind that firmly said
Arabelle's spoiled seduction that sounded so cute in Harry's ears made him couldn't help but laugh out loud.
Draco got up from his chair. "Yes, of course. Never mind, I want to go to the bathroom." He walked while stomping his feet like a kid, making Daphne giggle at his cute behavior.
Was it Harry's enemy who wanted to harm him? Did they know he was pregnant with Harry's child and wanted revenge? Subconsciously, Draco hugged his stomach. His instinct directly moved to protect the baby in the womb. He then shook his head, trying to calm himself. No, Harry's enemies must have taken care of the matter before deciding to let Draco go. And the only ones who knew that he was pregnant were himself and Potter's personal doctor.
In a dark corner, a telephone was picked up. Tom Riddle was sitting in his big chair, smoking a cigarette. A glass of brandy with its half-full bottle appeared beside him. His cold face with a nose flushed from drunkenness looked alert.
Draco turned his head and faced a beautiful woman in her white dress, who smiled gently at him. Maybe this woman was the only guest at the party who wanted to say hello to Draco.
Draco smiled. Without waiting for anything, Draco immediately placed his hand on top of Cedric's strong hand. They danced with happy smiles on their faces. The faint sound of the orchestra from within the royal hall made Draco feel the newest sensation of dancing.
Hermione frowned, clearly taken aback by Draco's request, her eyes staring questioningly. "What's the matter, Draco? But... Aren't you..."
The man continued to walk towards Draco. When he was entirely in front of Draco, his index finger moved to lift Draco's chin slightly.
"I-I want to vomit... Please help me," Draco pressed his stomach, trying to be as convincing as he could.
What if Draco tells the truth? Could it be that Doctor Jason fell in sympathy and helped him? Or maybe Doctor Jason reported it to Harry instead, considering that this hospital was Harry's.
Draco was afraid of being banished to the dangerous forest of Olympus. He still hopes to return to his old body in the future. He still needs time. He thought everything would be fine, but this time Ares didn't smile at him.
Draco twirled the tall glass in his slender hand slowly to shake off his boredom. His husband didn't even want to open a conversation with him, as the King of the Delion had done to his concubine, Natalie.
Alastair was one of Ares' knights of high rank, and Ares assigned him to guard the Prince of Sparta. He was a Demigod, which meant he had god's blood running through him, but Draco never asked Alastair's father or mother.
"Harry Potter never gets drunk," Harry stepped over calmly, like a lion sneaking up on its prey. "And you... You should have obeyed what I ordered, Draco."
"I am honored, Goddess of Beauty." Draco nodded with a smile. He was determined to keep his attitude. He didn't want to get into trouble with Aphrodite. For example, she could have told Eros to use his love potion to make Draco lust after an ugly Satyr. Aphrodite was able to do it because, in the past, she had told Eros to make Psyche fall in love with animals.
Draco sat on the sofa in the television room, hugging his knees. He pulled the blanket half of his body while looking at the empty room. His thoughts began to return to Abaddon, the demon after him. The creature knows where Draco works, and it could also know where Draco lives.
"Prince Cedric! What other crazy things are you doing?!" Harry's voice rose when the man had set foot into the small house.
The queen of Sparta hurriedly tugged at her son's shirt. "Watch your words, my son. This is the messenger of Ares that we have met. Ares is the God of Olympus who could not possibly lower his status and set his great feet on human land." His mother whispered angrily.
"What about Potter?" Draco asked quickly. The sabotage must have been carried out by Harry's enemies, who had hatred against him.
Harry roughly pushed Draco outside and then pushed him to the end of the balcony so that Draco's head was pointing down and staring with horror at the enormous swimming pool below. The pool looked very clear and deep. Draco shivered. He can't swim. Will Harry push him down? Harry literally pushed Draco's body to the end of the balcony, causing his head to bend downward, Draco's arm restrained by Harry behind him.
Ignoring the screams of Draco and Harry behind him, Peeves had disappeared in the blink of an eye. Draco couldn't help but sigh. If it was like this, he's sure all Hogwarts would know right away.
They had tried every position imaginable, and even some Draco had never dreamed of attempting. Throughout the night, Harry had forced him to plead, to shout his name over and over again until his voice had gone hoarse. He'd made Draco say and do things he never imagined doing, things that would surely leave him sore and ashamed of himself for days to come. In the end, Draco had to beg Harry to stop and give him a break.
Harry's eyes scanned the entirety of his wife's room. Draco's room was the complete opposite of Arabelle's. Draco's room was white and gold to highlight the elegance, while Arabelle's room was decorated with teenage pink.
The person who spoke to Mr. Flitwick earlier has disappeared, and he is most likely the culprit. What kind of creature does something like this? Now Draco was in a complete panic. The culprit must still be in the store, and he should call the police immediately.
Draco was stunned angrily at Harry's abuse of him. How much he costs? Hah! Does he think he's a king who can buy anything he wants? This evil man must be taught that even though many bend their knees at his feet and beg to have him, someone was unwilling to be touched by him.
Draco shuttered against the wall as another cry tore from his lips. His legs trembled. “Wait—! I’m going to—” He gasped again as another finger was added, and Harry curled his finger up, so it brushed against a bundle of nerves.
"Oh, of course, because you want that power for yourself. Besides, I saw you were going to kill me, and I wouldn't let anyone do that to me." Draco's tone started to go up a few octaves.
"I mean the heater. Do I need to turn on the heater?" Harry asked, trying to keep himself from laughing foolishly. Indeed, his wife's flushed face and the look of surprise in his eyes were new to Harry.
However, he decided to keep his mouth shut and not voice his opinion. Seeing the many guards and maids who were already sitting under a shady tree while joking made his heart warm a little. He didn't want to make the people feel irritated.
All need sacrifice. Of course, the price was high. But Draco felt it would be worth the satisfaction he would get later. The satisfaction of killing the man in painful torment, as he did to his father and mother.
"If later I get punished, then I hope you get punished too. You don't forget that punishment in this kingdom binds anyone? Be it commoners or nobles." Cedric opposed in an unfriendly tone of voice.
“You live here in extravagance, treated like a prince, respected like the lover of Harry Potter, and I am fed up with your behavior that always challenged me every chance you got. Now it's your only choice, and you will decide now. You choose me, or you would rather be thrown to my bodyguards?"
"You sound confident," Draco felt his voice tremble slightly. He felt the War God's hair on his neck. They shouldn't sleep together so soon.
"I'm almost certain that this is all a hoax. There is no such thing as a god!" Draco said, a little agitated as he regretted his fate.
Supposedly when Harry harassed him, Draco could hold back and pretend to be an easy woman. He should be willing to sacrifice to hold back his feelings. At least when he obliged, Harry would probably be pleased and caught off guard and drink his drink and die. It was too late. Harry seemed disinterested in his drink and was utterly attracted to Draco. Besides, Draco couldn't pretend to like Harry; his hatred for him was too deep.
Blaise snorted. "I don't really mind if you bring up that stupid analysis of yours, but at least acknowledge me being here,"
A few minutes later, someone knocked on the door, and without warning, it opened. Alden walked in and raised his eyebrows when he saw Draco lying helplessly on the bed with a blanket covering his entire body, leaving his blonde hair sticking out.
"You really are an immoral devil, taking advantage of someone who hates you so much!" Draco hissed in anger, still not wanting to look at Harry. He was sick of seeing the face of that monster.
Draco panicked, immediately controlled his features, and just shrugged, but Pansy's deadly gaze forced him to answer. "Well, I just, you know, a lot of girls want to be his girlfriend, and I'm just taking the girls' point of view." Draco finally answered with a puzzling answer.
He was a little intrigued when he saw Cedric discussing with the royal guards. It seemed Cedric was offering something to the guards. He could feel it from their faces. They looked happy.
The black-haired woman stared in shock as she saw the man who had been the focus of her gaze suddenly disappeared from the dance floor. The dance floor was now filled with Empress Draco, the man's wife, and seems to be having a short chat with the guests.
"Alden," Harry's cold voice from the door made them both turn. Alden's face went pale to find Harry standing there, leaning against the door with an unreadable face. "I didn't really want to bother you gossiping with Draco," Harry's eyes sharpened. "But I need you now. There is something we need to discuss.”
It's useless, he won't be able to get away from Vlad. The man will find him for sure. Maybe from the start, Vlad thought this was just a game, and stupidly Draco was tempted and responded.
He silently cursed himself as he was holding back his frustration. All because he couldn't contain his hatred.
"No need," Before they left the dining hall, several Satyrs looked anxious, trying to talk to Ares. It seems like a guest had arrived late. "What now?" Ares asked impatiently.
Right now, Draco had only one hope, Harry. Hopefully, the man still has a little attention for his wife.
"That's an exaggeration! All I did was marry a human and take him to Olympus. Doesn't he remembers how many dozen humans he's slept with during his time as a god?"
Clearing his throat again because his throat hurt, Draco tried to challenge Harry's angry look and read the meaning between them. Yes, Harry Potter always upholds his dignity. He will not break a promise. After feeling sure, Draco nodded his head.
Accompanied by several Nymphs, Draco walked through the grass and shrubs while carrying a rattan basket. Alastair seemed to be standing guard nearby while taking shelter under a thick tree. He didn't fully trust the Nymphs.
"Lie down, my prince. Your body still can't move. You must be shocked. Calm down, this is all normal." a middle-aged man whispered to him. Draco glanced at the man. For older men, the clothing style was a bit strange and too exposing the skin. He acts like a doctor or some sort of healer.
"I know what's right and wrong, Potter. And this time, I mean it," Draco gave Harry a threatening look. "You only have two choices, let me go or find me dead."
By now, Draco had replaced his dress with plain clothes that was considered lighter on his body. No glittering knick-knacks decorated the shirt, only a small flower embroidered on the neck.
That morning, the first thing Draco did was check his fridge and frowned when he found it full of groceries. This must be that man's job, Draco thought. He refused to mention Harry's name in an attempt to forget him, but Draco didn't want to let this distraction ruin his first day of freedom.
"How many days until he can return to normal?" Harry talks about Draco as if Draco wasn't in the room.
Ares took a deep breath. He knew his sister. She's good at twisting facts and getting people to take her side. Whatever Ares said, she would definitely crush them.
Without waiting long, the King of the Delion Kingdom immediately rose from his throne. The atmosphere that had been boisterous because of the admiration of the ladies and gentlemen over Harry and Draco had now disappeared.
Draco stared blankly at Arabelle, who was sobbing with her legs bent high. Harry's mistress was not wearing shoes on her white feet. Without even approaching her, Draco knew that his husband's mistress's feet looked very dirty.
The man tilted his head. He looked a little confused. "I don't want to know, and you must love me. Unless you will never leave this house."
Without waiting long, the girl mumbled a word of thanks and made a bowing gesture like the nobles she had seen during her time in this magnificent palace. Her thanks were met with a nod and an elegant smile from Draco.
Draco gasped. Father, he said. Does that mean that man was a god? Draco immediately lowered his head.
Ares heard the young man curse while scratching the back of his hand. Did he hear wrong? He should be a meek and graceful prince. Shouldn't he be cowering in fear while crying right now? The Spartan prince was currently walking with annoyed steps carrying a dry wooden branch that was slightly scabs. Ares wanted to remind that the wooden branch was a fire ant nest. But it seems the prince noticed it and threw it on the ground.
Draco sighed bitterly. For Draco, their family was happy, even though his mother was a sickly weak woman, but other than that, she was the perfect mother.
He didn't expect that Cedric, who he knew as gentle and very fond of jokes, actually had a rough figure like this. But... Draco should have guessed this already, considering Cedric was someone who was greatly feared on the battlefield.
Harry then flashed his triumphant smile when Draco was already standing beside him. Then no one spoke. They just stood still, staring straight into the distance.
"God, Draco..." Harry sighed in relief. He grabbed an untouched glass of water, not far from the bed, then sat down beside the bed and helped Draco sit up. "Can you drink?"
Whether it was because Harry couldn't think straight or because the man did have a lot of strength, the man pulled the rope so tightly that the young man wearing the dress let out a soft moan of pain.
"Draco, if you need anything, don't hesitate to call me. I will ride beside your carriage," said Cedric, which made Draco managed to avert his eyes from Harry.
"He's not the Oracle who lives here. I heard he's from Athens. After delivering the medicine he claims to be from God Ares, he leaves."
Draco nodded. "Since I'm your wife, don't you need to ask my permission just to hold hands?" He blushed at saying that.
Alden's words made Draco indeed more curious. What was this really? Was this the answer to why Harry had kept him captive all this time? Draco would chase that answer from Alden. No matter what.
Draco took a step back, aware of the intensity of the anger in Harry's voice. This one-man probably suffers from post power syndrome and can easily get angry with him if he doesn't follow his will, Draco thought to himself.
The man followed Draco's line of sight and smiled. "I'm Doctor Jason. I was the doctor who treated you yesterday when you were brought here. Your head must be hurting, right? You hit it hard enough. I sewed 12 stitches in there."
As Draco recalled, he still had some savings in his account, not much, just enough to survive for one to two months after deducting the monthly payment for this small house contract. After that, Draco had to work to support himself and pay for his accommodation. If Draco couldn't do that, he would be homeless. So, the time to look for work was very narrow.
"Oops, I woke you up," the man smiled kindly. "I was injecting medicine for your wound. I've been trying to be as gentle as possible, but I don't seem as gentle as I thought."
"Arabelle, I don't understand what you're talking about," he said, which made Arabelle flinch and stare at Draco in surprise. "But, spots like that shouldn't be shown. It looks weird." Draco continued softly, tugging at the satin scarf that protected his neck from the scorching heat.
"No need, I'm almost three thousand years old. It would be awkward if my own wife called me Lord or something. That would remind us both of the huge age gaps, right? I didn't want to make you uncomfortable, Troya." Ares said after downing the water in his silver goblet.
But the man was like Harry, suddenly in front of Draco while flapping his white wings. "We need to talk," he said suddenly.
The young man began to worry that his relationship with the War God would deteriorate. He didn't want to be neglected in the circle of the gods alone. He didn't have enough supplies to face the Olympus forest.
Oh God, he hoped it was that easy. The trunk opened slightly, and a glimmer of light entered through an opening that was only narrowly opened.
Who will punish the Gods of Olympus? Only Zeus can do it, but Draco doubted that Zeus would punish his son for the death of a mere human like him. Letting him in and sat on the chair was the sanest decision at the moment.
"A-Ah," Draco finally spoke, but he couldn't meet Harry's emerald eyes directly. "This is the dumbest thing I've heard today, and you look dumb too."
At the sink, Draco lowered his head as if he was going to vomit violently. "Towel... Please..." Draco muttered weakly, glancing at the towel cupboard at the end of the bathroom.
Draco glanced at Harry, in case it was the man who was tricking him. But Draco saw Harry's face that looked quite serious, staring at Professor Trelawney, who was teaching.
"No, sorry I've been rude. No problem. I know Hadreda. She's smart and has a great sense of humor," Alastair smiled.
"How was your visit to Delion?" asked Lucius, looking at Draco, who managed to show his relaxed face.
Harry suddenly turned his green eyes completely black as he had done before. His eyes were on Draco, and Draco was taken somewhere in the past. Draco was in the crowd of war. The sound of swords and swords clashing made Draco's ears feel like he was fighting with them.
I should have written the next chapter of Wrong Passion, but I couldn't resist. My fingers itching to post a new story. I'm so sorry for those of my lovely people who are waiting for the next chapter of Wrong Passion. I'm still working on it. I don't know when I will be able to update ( Ĭ ^ Ĭ )
Somehow the scent of flowers doesn't make him nauseous like the smell of food. It might sound a little strange, but Draco thought he felt a little better outdoors than indoors, which made him feel short of breath.
It was Athena, the Goddess of Wisdom and War Strategy. She was also the eternal rival of Ares because they were both the Gods of Olympus who were worshiped by humans who were going to war. A man prays to be given courage and strength to Ares. Humans also pray to Athena for victory.
"No, Your Majesty! Besides, when we left earlier, His Royal Highness immediately chased away all the maids who were there."
"If I really want to put your idea into action, when and how do I get a temporary mate'?" Harry folded his arms across his chest, one eyebrow raised.
"I know you don't believe it, but we have proof of the offer, which I will show you later. Now I'll continue my story." Alden cleared his throat, seeming very understanding of the various emotions swirling one after another on Draco's face. “Things would have been different if what was offered wasn't you. Given that Mr. Lucius's only child is a boy, I'm sure master Harry will vehemently reject your father. But master changed his mind immediately when he saw your picture."
Cyclops before Ares did not budge. He seemed almost asleep. Then Ares saw something in his hand. There was a rope attached to something. At first, Ares thought it was a wild boar or wolf who had the misfortune to become a Cyclops’ toy. It turned out to be a Satyr, the half-human creature with goat legs.
"No, I promise not to tell anyone about this. It's fun trying new things anyway. We're immortals, Aphrodite. It's natural to feel bored. After all, we've been doing it for thousands of years until there's no jealousy between us anymore. Why are you bothered now?"
Inside the carriage, it was very quiet. Draco was busy staring blankly at the view behind the window, while Arabelle was busy staring at perfect-looking Draco. Even when the blonde did nothing, an aura of elegance and intelligence always radiated from him.
Harry didn't expect Ron to be sensitive enough to notice that. "I can't give you an answer yet." Harry shrugged, caught off guard for a moment. "You think I should come?"
Harry sighs pleasantly. He could not be angry with his baby for too long. He was eyeing Draco predatorily as the boy arches his back, throwing his head back and lifting his chest to show off those pretty tits.
"I will do it," Draco nodded. This was his attempt to survive. He will do anything as long as he doesn't die in the forest of Olympus. Draco has to endure at least until he knows why his soul got stranded here.
Draco's hand looked for a grip, and he got a hand. Harry was holding Draco and staring at him with gleaming black eyes. Draco felt sadness and sorrow as if everyone's suffering turned over to him. Draco grabbed Harry's hand firmly and made his return to the dining table in the kitchen.
"Too bad, I have nothing to offer. I just arrived at your palace today. I'm not even used to the bathroom yet," Draco said a little nervously. His eyes trying to look the other way. He pretended to see the scenery, though, outside his window. There was only darkness and the sound of crickets making quite a noise against the chattering of frogs.
Harry crushed Draco's lips all over, and then his tongue explored Draco's mouth, their tongues interlocking hot and wet. Harry's lips moved against Draco's mercilessly. The man was aroused but still covered in tenderness, and for a moment, Draco lost in that incredible kiss, until then he felt Harry's hard cock pressed against his thigh.
While Draco was still busy assessing his physical appearance—he saw a beautiful deer join in and drink next to him. Then a canary whistled merrily and landed on his arm.
His husband gasped and stared at him with a faint frown on his forehead. Fortunately, it only happened for a fraction of a second so that none of the guests noticed the frown on their King's forehead.
He was eager to get down on the dance floor and join the noble couples. However, the young man's desire immediately evaporated when he saw his husband, who was now standing beside him, emitting an aura of boredom.
The man, the next heir of the Delion Kingdom, Terence, raised an eyebrow at Draco's words. "I wouldn't have been eavesdropping and stalking if Your Majesty and Your Majesty's devotees weren't shouting at each other and... that slap... just incredible." Terence chuckled, which made Draco even more annoyed.
Draco was in a lot of pain and turned to look at his arm. It was already wrapped in a very thick bandage. The pain was still there but more from the deep trauma from the bad experience.
"I'll give you a chance until sunset. When that time runs out, I'll look for you. And if I find you, I'll never let you go again."
"Dead," Harry interrupted, finishing Draco's sentence. "Abaddon smells you. He wants you." Harry touched his face, which Draco just elbowed.
It's been almost an hour since Draco has been locked up in this room. The luxurious white room, the carpet, the bed, all the furniture was even white. Draco was disgusted by the thought that perhaps Harry's previous lovers had also been placed in this room.
"Watching me so I can't hide from you while you can find out where I live? Very funny," Draco responded sarcastically.
He continued to walk and wander until his gaze caught a pair of lovers sitting together hugging each other in a pavilion which was quite far from where Draco was standing at the moment. Without even approaching, Draco knew that the pair was none other than Harry and Arabelle.
Draco cleared his throat, his cheeks starting to turn pink. "You seem to know a lot about flowers, sir..." he lifted an eyebrow.
"Just go back to your room and change into your own clothes," said Harry quickly as soon as they both got off Harry's horse.
Draco took a deep breath. If he wasn't a queen of a large kingdom, maybe by now, Draco was living happily with his little family. But unfortunately, fate said otherwise. Ever since Draco was born into this world, the young man had been destined to be the wife of Harry, the most eminent king for the past few decades.
The place was a witness to his eternal life, which was always hot and vibrant. Not only Aphrodite, who had made love with him there, but dozens of other lovers who were no less beautiful. If he visited his human lover outside of Olympus, then only the lover of the Titans he had ever brought to that place.
The Spartan warriors might have been discouraged if the Oracles hadn't said that Goddess Athena was on Sparta's side this time. But there was something else that preoccupied his mind more than anything right now. An Oracle who brought medicine to Troya said that God Ares asked his son to be his wife in exchange for his recovery.
"Master agreed right away, but he didn't want to rush. According to the agreement, at the age of 23, you will be handed over to master Harry. He never did a take over to your father's company. He only gave an enormous amount of money according to your father's request..." Alden looked at Draco sadly. “But your father worked with incompetent management, and they betrayed him. The money was gone in an instant, and your father's company, instead of being saved, was ruined. Your father then came back asking master Harry for help."
"I already told him that I have you. He promised he wouldn't care no matter what we do," Ares responded flatly.
"Yeah, of course, I wouldn't be so stupid as to compete with the Goddess of Beauty. Ares and I aren't even a couple," Draco replied.
After making sure the doctor was out of the room, Harry looked back at Draco, his eyes sharp as a razor. "What was that?"
After Cedric left, Draco looked straight at Arabelle with a gentle smile. Lightly, he took Arabelle's hand.
"You are very quiet, prince of Sparta. I wish I could hear your voice," Ares rebuked him, who now turned his face the other way. Apart from being afraid of being found out that he was blushing, Draco was ashamed of his current dirty and soil-stained condition.
Draco decided to finish the breakfast that Alden brought to his room, even though Draco feel that he have no appetite for food. All parts of his body ached. Draco couldn't even sit in the chair and chose to lay on his soft bed. He was desperately trying to get the food into his mouth if it weren't for the smell that was so bad for him to inhale. Every time he sniffed the smell of the grilled sausage and eggs on his plate, at that moment, he wanted to vomit. Draco couldn't understand what had happened to his body.
"Okay. Good night." Harry nodded, glancing at Arabelle for one last time before he moved out of the room.
And apparently, his rebuttal irritated Doctor Jason's sentiments. "Not his whore you say? You sleep with him and enjoy it. You accept all the perks from him willingly and pay with your body. From my observations, you are the most preferred and special prostitute in Potter's eyes among his other prostitutes, and I imagine the satisfaction I got when he saw your dead body, covered with knife slices."
"Oh, baby…" Harry tucked Draco's blonde strands behind his ear, staring at the beautiful boy completely. "Should I remind you like this next time, hm? Do I need to fuck you in front of Greyson to show him that you are mine?"
Of course, Draco didn't believe the man's words. He had lived in the royal palace full of guile for five years, and he could see firsthand how the royal servants manipulated each other to get the throne and treasure for themself.
There was an amused glint in Harry's green eyes. "What, Draco? I can't hear you,” Harry did it on purpose, and Draco growled in exasperation.
"Shut up!!" Draco growled, unable to stand Harry's words, which seemed to have been used to hurt him. His head felt throbbing as if it had been stabbed with an iron rod. He grimaced and held his head.
Ares was still watching the prince, who was now saying a lot of strange things. Although a little confusing and made him frown—the prince's behavior really amused him. He was grateful that his new wife was still healthy. No limbs were lost. Even though the dust and dirt clung to his body, his hair was still soft and well-groomed.
"Prince Cedric! What did you do to her?!" An angry shout managed to distract the girl from Prince Cedric's hostile face.
This must be a dream because before going to bed, Draco lay restlessly, trying to erase the memory of his love affair with Harry that seemed to have always appeared in his mind. And because this is a dream, it never hurts to enjoy.
Alden nodded, and whether Draco was mistaken or not, it's just that for a second, he saw an amused glow in Alden's eyes. God damn it. Maybe they all laughed at his fear of Harry.
Harry glared at Draco. "No, yesterday's situation made you known as my dearest. People who target me will definitely target you because you are the weakest. It makes you always have to be with me, under my protection." Harry looked straight at Draco. "You are my weakness."
Aphrodite wriggled her back, tossed her blonde hair that was wavy like golden silk, and ran her fingers through it. Then the Goddess of Beauty fixed her clothes which were embroidered with silver thread. Aphrodite prepared to return to her palace, back to her gloomy husband.
The appearance of gods among humans was not always depicted as dramatic and majestic. Humans may often pass by them without knowing their identity. Like now, Ares rode his gallant black horse calmly.
"WHAT?!" An ear-piercing shout filled the small house as Draco's servant finished her sentence. The shout came from Arabelle. She stood right beside Harry.
He saw Draco start to take steps to attack him. Draco moved so fast, Cedric had no other choice but to point his sword right at Draco's smooth, flawless skin.
"I didn't expect this before, but I don't think I'll stop you. It's just—" The god responded a little doubtfully.
Cedric's jaw tightened, the man's breath hitched when he heard Draco speak to him in formal sentences. Cedric didn't like that. The blonde's words seemed to explain that they had never had a close relationship.
"Yeah, the gods are pretty secretive about this. Ares usually visits his human lovers in the city himself. I don't think he even reveals his identity."
"My lover, Aphrodite... Why should you be angry? You know that I always come back to you." Ares seduced the goddess, showing his servitude.
"About what?" Draco frowned, starting to get annoyed by Harry's interruptions. He was in the mood to savor the rain, and the man always seemed to show up at the wrong time and speak the wrong words too.
Harry's clerk had arranged the things neatly in the trunk, and Alden was already standing by the side of the car, ushering Draco in for a ride home.
A small groan escaped Draco's pale lips. Even though he had wrung his clothes, it didn't make them dry.
"His leg was slightly injured, but not badly. He tried to run away from us, but we managed to thwart him."
"The lovers became frustrated because Aphrodite was always by Ares' side. They never parted, even though Ares is still dating other humans. Their relationship is complicated and confusing. The point is, we don't think you should try to compete with Aphrodite. It will only hurt you," Argus added.
"You know, I think we should head back. You should rest," Ares said nervously, looking away. He was worried about doing something he would regret if they were alone for too long. The Prince of Sparta wasn't ready.
"You like it, don't you?" Harry whispered softly with his breath hot in Draco's ear. "I really like your lips and the soft sensation they have on mine," Harry's hand crept downward, touching the skin of Draco's neck. "Your whole body is warm, baby, as if it made to tease me." Harry's fingers uncover the oversized shirt Harry deliberately put on Draco, playing with the top of Draco's panties and slipping inside, teasing his cock. "Here... The most passionate part."
Draco looked at Harry as the Alpha walking away. The Omega bit his lower lip a little hard, suddenly overcome with guilt. Draco was lucky that Harry wasn't interested in punishing him—Draco's refusing to ask Harry was against Alpha's orders.
If calculated, it's been about an hour. Draco sat on the sparsely cut wood as a seat, and during that hour, Draco thought about Arabelle's words.
"Vlad!" Draco shrieked as he felt the delicious sensation of Vlad's fangs bite into his neck. It hurt, but made him hot and even more aroused.
Draco turned his head nervously and found Alden standing there, staring at him with his usual cold stare. “Who is the woman in the picture, Alden?”
Draco arched his back at the sensation that tormented him mercilessly. In a state of bondage and helplessness, feeling that demonic man fondling him and torturing him with his skillful temptations, there was a strange feeling running through his body. Like a rolling heat, it felt like an electric current flowing from his fingers and became even hotter as it converged at his center.
"How can I not interfere if you disturb my human? I am his guardian angel, and I have the right to keep him away from you," argued Icarus.
"If it's just out of curiosity, don't the gods usually kidnap humans they want?" Draco regretted it after saying that. He used to argue and forgot that the man he was currently with was a god.
Draco and Harry were back dancing as usual until the arrival of a guard from the Shinia Kingdom interrupted the dance. The guard whispered something in Harry's ear, which made Harry slightly startled.
Draco embroidered with such skill and detail. In just an instant, the young man had already managed to finish his embroidery. Now, the soft beige cotton cloth has been decorated with a blue tulip flower arrangement which is very soothing to the eyes.
"My Queen, you are a woman. What do you know about war strategy? I will defend what is rightfully mine. I'm not willing to give in to an Oracle whose identity is unknown." The King has decided.
It's a bedroom. A very feminine room with soft pink tones, almost white. Draco looked around the room and found something that stunned him… and paled.
"Draco," was Harry's voice, and the man called out his real name. Draco's face immediately turned white. That man knew his disguise from the start! "I'm going to open this trunk, but you have to promise to be calm and not rebel." There was a hint of a smile in Harry's voice.
Draco shook his head. "I'm talking to myself. I mean with my imaginary friends, nowadays my imaginary friends often appear suddenly," he replied.
Harry raised an eyebrow, and for the first time, Draco managed to threaten him. He really didn't follow Draco into the bathroom. Draco was ready if Harry had dared to peek at him in the bathroom.
Troya bowed back to Alastair, but the corners of his eyes glanced at his brothers and sisters, who could not hide their delight at seeing the pile of treasure. They laughed, and some shamelessly approached the horse-drawn carriage, curious about its contents.
Draco was exhausted both mentally and physically. He hadn't gotten enough sleep because Ares spent the night with him yesterday. Whether intentional or not, the way to sleep was just 'flirty'. He snored, but his arms wrapped around Draco's slender waist, rubbing his stomach and not wanting to let go. Draco figured he could pretend to be asleep since he hadn't touched any other area. How can a sleeping person choose where he touches?
The King of Sparta never bowed to anyone. He was leading the nation with the strongest military in all of Greece. Therefore, he was not willing to show his weakness. Like most other Spartan warriors—though he doesn't always fight on the front lines anymore—his body is strong, and his palms can still grip the sword firmly. The graying of his hair and the frown lines at the corners of his eyes did not detract from his prestige.
Draco looked at Hermione again. This woman is kind. Maybe Hermione could help him. "Help me..." Draco whispered weakly, afraid his voice might be caught by Harry or his bodyguards scattered everywhere. "Help me out of here."
Harry put on his coat and turned to Alden, who was waiting for him by the door. "What about that last case? Have you taken care of them?"
Thank you for reading. I hope you guys enjoyed this revealed chapter. Kudos and comments are always appreciated <3
My dear... Draco was struck by lightning. That voice, very much like the voice of the man who used to be in his dreams. He felt
"I don't know. We've tried to buy a horse and have someone put it at the foot of Mount Olympus. We've also asked if any mercenaries would help me escape, but no one is willing." The prince complained.
Doctor Jason had already wounded Draco with two bloody cuts in Draco's arm, making Draco grimace in pain and distress in being tied to the chair and almost losing consciousness.
"Prince Cedric?!" Draco gasped in surprise when he saw Prince Cedric, Harry's cousin, walking towards him with an extremely annoyed expression.
"Allow me to guard Troya, my King. I will take him to a safe place and away from your enemies. He has already died once. We do not know what danger he will be in."
"He claims to be the messenger of Ares and has medicine to heal you," The Spartan King spoke with a sad expression on his face.
Five hours later, Draco was face down on the mattress, panting after having just experienced his tenth orgasm at the hands of his greatest enemy.
Harry sat on the edge of the bed and stared at Draco, who was still sleeping because of the drug. Blood transfusions had been carried out, and Draco's condition gradually improved.
Draco flashed his best smile to the guards. "All right. If you remember, I haven't played with swords in a long time,"
The servant's face turned cloudy even though Helios, the God of Sun, was in high spirits today. The boy sobbed. "Your Majesty, you should just run away." He said sympathetically.
"What? No! Look, this was all beyond my plans. I'm not the only one to blame for this. Hermes proposed it. He took us on a bet to get the Prince of Sparta. This is just a game. It's just that Hermes made it so complicated!" Ares took a deep breath before explaining.
"My birthday is in a few months from now," said Harry. "You want to know how I spend my birthday every year?"
Draco never remembered reading Ares' story where he had a legal spouse. It seems like this was a new chapter in the story about Troya—Prince of Sparta, who was unfortunate to be forced to become the bride of the violent God—Ares.
Draco was just about to apologize for his impolite behavior, but the loud thumping of his bedroom door and the voice of a man he knew very well made Draco stop his sentence before he could finish speaking.
A few twigs had scratched his beautiful skin, but Hector didn't care. No matter how much Draco begged and cursed at him, he didn't stop. Then Alastair, with his sword, leaped before them. He looked at Hector coldly and slashed his arm without any warning.
"Are you ready?" asked Cedric, a little nervous as he grabbed the reins of his horse. At this moment, his position looked like he was hugging Draco.
Draco clenched his jaw and sharpened his gaze when he finally got up the courage to look at Cedric's face. He didn't want to appear weak in front of anyone.
Icarus nodded, and the sword disappeared in the blink of an eye. As Icarus said, Draco only needed to summon the sword.
Harry removed his face to chuckle at that, and then dived back in, now scissoring two fingers and his tongue in and out of Draco. With each thrust of his hands, he curled his fingers against Draco’s prostate and pressed against it harshly. Draco’s cock throbbed from the overstimulation. Harry added a third finger, and soon enough, Draco found himself once again approaching orgasm, his whole body trembling.
"Your Majesty, you look very compatible with His Majesty. I hope my daughter can also find a man like His Majesty and live a married life like Your Majesty and His Majesty," said a middle-aged noblewoman who was one of the many nobles who currently surround Draco.
"An easy job like this won't hurt me," Draco said with a satisfied smile as he saw the helplessness of his maid.
Arabelle seemed confused by Harry's attitude. It was unusual for Harry to leave her immediately after the man had reached his peak. Usually, the man would hug Arabelle, kiss her forehead lovingly, and throw compliments that always made her happy and proud.
"Do you think I'm crazy to go in there?" Draco slapped Hector's hand away and fought him. Then Draco saw a glint of anger mixed with obsession in the General's eyes. He was determined even though it betrayed all his titles and struggles as a Spartan General.
"Do you think the people are willing to pay for such large amounts of linen? No, they are thinking of buying linen from other kingdoms. If this happens, of course, our kingdom's economy will decline."
"You stared at the doctor with a dumb, dazzled look like a virgin who saw their first man... Oh, sorry," Harry's smile was genuinely mocking. "I forgot that you're not a virgin, and I'm your first man."
Draco just sat on the white chair in desperation because, after a long period of walking around the room, checking every corner of the bathroom and the windows, there was still absolutely no opening that could be used as his escape route.
Today was Sunday, supposed to be a nice day of rest for everyone. But Harry's moods were awful that morning and spread all over the house. The atmosphere at home was tense. All the servants were talking in terrified whispers, talking about their master, who had been angry all day.
Maybe Draco would be confused if it was the first time the man had said 'hell'. But of course, Draco knew Harry was serious about it.
"Park? Are you kidding me?" Harry's voice parroted. What would Ron and himself do in a park? Sitting around and listening to parents and young people having picnics with small children running to and fro? Harry felt he had better go back to his room and forget the silliness.
The clock showed six in the afternoon. Draco was able to watch one of his favorite movie that came out yesterday before his mother came home. He brought a bowl full of cereal and milk into the tv room when someone's sudden presence startled him. Spontaneously Draco threw his cereal bowl at the man, and all the contents spilled onto the floor.
It felt like Draco wanted to laugh out loud. Harry asks Draco to love him even though he doesn't know him, and now what? A man claiming to be his guardian angel? This world is exceptional.
"Ah, you must have never heard of the outside world," Hermione laughed again. "Gossip is spreading fast in this elite world. You are the most talked-about person these days."
"This is mine," Harry touched Draco's nipples and teased him, enjoying hearing Draco's tortured moan. "Your whole body is mine," Harry kissed the tip of Draco's nipples, smacking it with his tongue. Then Harry's lips moved to kiss Draco's smooth chest, savoring it with his lips, leaving traces of wetness and heat.
Draco walked gracefully, the blonde matching the steps Harry was pulling. Now and then, Draco would pull a faint smile when he heard the various kinds of unfunny jokes the King of the Delion Kingdom made to him, Harry, and the concubine, Natalie.
The Titans were an advanced civilized race. They have technology that surpasses the humans of the earth today but is only used by their race. Zeus made sure all their secrets and technology don't fall into human hands. If there are Titans who betray, they will be given a severe punishment like Prometheus.
Harry was used to being surrounded by people who were willing to surrender themselves to him. No one can resist the charm of Harry Potter. With jet-black hair that slightly grew across the collar, emerald eyes and an aristocratic face were almost as perfect as an angel. If only his eyes weren't so cold, heartless, and harboring deep hatred, terrifying. Harry was like a demon trapped in the body of an angel.
"Uh, the way His Royal Highness stares at his stepmother looks a little different like there's deep longing and love, but there's also hate."
"God Eros, you mentioned Ambrosia earlier?" Draco asked. Eros seemed friendly enough that Draco didn't hesitate to ask.
"Yes, I won the bet, and the prince of Sparta is my prize. It would be rude of me to refuse, would it?"
"I've been thinking about this for a long time. Look, he's always aware that Potter is watching us. And Draco also talks about Potter a lot, I know they're just hated speech, but it's proof that he always cares about Potter. Too bad he doesn't want to admit it." Pansy sighed.
"For you to come back to my house after ten days. Otherwise, the tattoo will burn your wrist," Harry explained, and he immediately crossed the street without waiting for Draco to react.
"I am a demigod, a relative of God Ares the Great. I am his follower and warrior." Alastair explained. He deliberately ignored Draco's question about why his future husband wasn't here to pick him up.
"If you're sick, you don't have to force yourself to come here. You just need to send a letter. I'll definitely accept it."
But right now, Draco couldn't laugh at the show anymore because the Titans who were now escorting him to Olympus—had just confessed that they came from another solar system. At least, that's what the young man concluded.
Draco approached him. Instantly his body stiffened. The man is Vlad, and the one lying weak in his lap is... Draco.
Draco's mind wandered over to those happy moments when he, his father, and mother gathered together at the dining table, eating breakfast with his loving father and mother. Lucius, his father, would talk about his business trip experiences, and his mother, Narcissa, would look at him with adoration. Everything feels so happy. Everything feels so perfect.
"My apologies, Alpha. However, this doesn't seem right." Draco pushed his hand away. "I am not your soulmate."
Draco stepped backward, glanced at the white door, and tried to get as close as possible, so when Harry acted out of bounds, he could immediately escape.
"I don't know what I'm doing here. My heart feels restless if I don't confirm your current situation," said Cedric with a soft smile.
Draco stomped his feet a little and walked over to the sofa. He picked up one of the books on the shelf and sat down, trying to make himself comfortable.
"No, prince of Sparta. Humans only perform magic. Therefore it is strictly forbidden to do it on Olympus. We as Titans only act with logic and science," Argus chimed in.
Annoyed, Draco walked over to Harry and stood in front of him. The man still didn't look at him. "I have a life, I have a family, I have a job, and you must send me back."
"Is that Harry's newest girlfriend?" A cynical voice was heard. Apparently, the owner of the voice was intentionally making Draco hear it.
Now, without a doubt, Natalie will also tell the world that the person currently sitting in front of her was the incarnation of an angel. Besides being beautiful, intelligent, elegant, well-spoken, and polite, Draco also has a very good heart.
"Your Majesty, the dance partner will be changing soon," Draco said simply as a reminder when he sensed that something was wrong with Harry.
Arabelle just stared in disbelief at Cedric. Was it true that this man was the same man who always gave her a scornful look full of anger?
"I am sure that Shinia, who has been in touch with Delion for a long time, will definitely oppose my rebellion. Shinia may send support to Delion. Therefore, I beg Your Majesty to persuade His Majesty not to interfere. Honestly, even though I'm going to rebel, I don't want to let a lot of blood be spilled because of my actions."
Draco saw Harry standing among them, moving on to another person and another. Draco started changing places again. Now he was in a small village filled with children. They were running here and there, but the village suddenly turned dark, and their houses caught fire. Several children screamed, and again it made Draco's ears buzz.
At that time Draco realized that he was not in his room. Everything felt strange and dark because all the windows were covered with thick curtains.
"What if Potter's whore conceived and gave birth to a son? Potter, who loved his whore so much, would adopt the boy as his heir, considering his
"Shit," it's the voice of Greyson Rouvas — Harry Potter's business partner who frequently visited his company because both companies were working on a project.
Cedric chuckled when he saw Draco's confused expression as the young man's silver eyes stared at the labyrinth garden in front of him that looked very lonely.
Draco sat down. Harry has saved him once again. Why did that man save him? Is it true that he is considered Harry's exceptional whore because Draco served Harry with his body? With a pale face, Draco looked away, feeling disgusted by himself.
"Oh, I was wrong. I shouldn't have mentioned Aphrodite's name," Ares broke his touch and let go of Draco.
Ares was an authoritative person who liked to guide his lovers as he pleased. He knows how to make them comfortable and trusts him. Then let it dominate their souls and bodies until their hearts were addicted to him.
The cheating couple had spent the night together. Aphrodite, as usual, visited Ares' palace when her legal husband Hephaestus was busy alone in his workshop making tools or weapons. Their affair was well known. Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love, was not shy about having more than one lover. Not only Ares; she also had a handsome human lover like Adonis. Her limp and unsightly husband was considered non-existent by Aphrodite.
Draco took the god's hand, which was warm and slightly rough. He could see the fresh scars from the grip of the sword. Ares regularly trains and was never satisfied with his current skills. Considering he was nearly three thousand years old, he was probably the best swordsman in Greece.
In late spring, the weather was sunny but not too hot. Usually, Ares would go to the gym to beat up some of his soldiers. But this time, he just lay half-sitting on a luxuriously carved cot in his cottage. The location was by the lake, and as usual, none of his servants or courtiers dared approach.
Draco flinched when he heard the words from the man he knew so well. He turned his head to the side, and he found Cedric sitting on a black horse. Well... his white horse had been given to Draco. Therefore, the brunette decided to use another horse.
“P-Potter... Please, I’m going to—” before his orgasm arrived, though, Harry pulled out completely with a satisfied look.
"What happened to them?" Draco raised his eyebrows curiously. The envoys looked at each other, not immediately answering.
"This is a dream. This is a dream! Hurry up and wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake—" Draco's mouth was clamped by a hand. Draco opened his eyes and saw the man he had seen before or after. He doesn't know. He's so confused.
Harry sat on the end of the bed Draco slept on. He wiped Draco's sweaty forehead, took the young man's hand, and carefully squeezed the limp hand. He brought Draco's hand in front of his lips, then kissed the back of the hand for a few moments before finally releasing the kiss.
After making sure everything was done, Draco immediately moved to meet Harry, standing right beside the dark brown horse that had brought them here.
"Is it because of the Prince of Sparta that you guys feel you have to act like this to me?" She said, annoyed when Alastair and his partner Argus tried to help her get on the horse after a short rest by the river.
Draco just realized, the young woman who seemed to be acting as his servant spoke in a foreign language. Somehow, Draco could understand. It sounds like Greek. Draco concluded that this prank show was set in ancient Greece. Although not as accurate as the general description recorded in the maestros' paintings of ancient Greece, Draco admits that the producers of this show were pretty serious in working on the setting.
"I've never changed. I've always had a crush on you. In the past, I thought that friendship might be enough, but not anymore. I can't keep my feelings hidden in our friendship."
Does this maid know what happened last night? Draco had even tried to wear clothes that covered his entire torso, neck, and lower body. Yes, as soon as he went into the bathroom to clean himself, Draco thought it was his upper body that Harry had so many marks on, but it turned out that his guess was off. His lower body was covered with kiss marks and bites by Harry, especially his inner thighs. It made Draco couldn't stop feeling ashamed of himself and swearing at the other man.
Legend has it that Ares, the God of War, was also involved in the war and was the one who accepted defeat.
Like a shameless person, Draco then decided to turn his back to Harry. Draco knew self-respect and reputation to himself and his father were very important, but it seemed like they weren't necessary anymore in front of Harry.
"They must have thought nothing of it. Your reputation and His Majesty will surely be disgraced," Arabelle looked into Harry's eyes worriedly.
The man turned his head back, and Draco realized another person behind Harry, a small and elegant woman.
"The taste of the wine is amazing. I didn't know the Delion Kingdom had such a precious treasure," said Harry to the King of the Delion as the man sitting right beside him.
Draco knew his husband was waiting for Arabelle, so that he couldn't do anything. He could only gulp down the wine the servant had poured back on him. Actually, he's bored. This was so rare. Maybe it was because Draco felt that this party was a little useless for his prestige.
Draco stared at Harry in silence. Harry's parents had also died, that was what he knew, but somehow, the information about Harry's parents was kept tightly, so far away that no one could dig it up.
They only consist of four men with mercenary-like appearances and a woman with dark brown hair in a similar outfit. Draco originally suspected that the messenger God Ares would have a unique physique like a centaur or satyr. His suspicions were running high, but the gifts he brought were bountiful. Draco doubted that any wealthy aristocrat in Greece could carry such an expensive wedding gift.
He was just about to get up from his seat, but Cedric's strong hands moved violently to press Draco's shoulders so that he sat back down again. Draco was surprised. His eyes widened perfectly.
"Don't make too many excuses," argued Pansy, to which Blaise nodded in agreement. "Honestly, we've both thoughts about it," Pansy's tone suddenly sounded more serious than before.
"I told you I would make you scream my name." Harry panted, laying his head on Draco's shoulder. He began planting light kisses and nips at the skin that had flushed red from their activities, enjoying the afterglow and taking immense pride in what he'd just done.
"What's wrong with seducing my lover?" Cedric asked with a slight chuckle that made Draco sneer at the prince.
Draco tried to snatch his hand away from Harry, but the man continued to grab him. Draco started to feel the heat on his wrist. When Harry let go of his hand, he saw a small black tattoo etched under his palm.
Professor Trelawney clapped her hands. "That's what I want to show you. The purpose of angels and demons is to love each other and have children."
Draco glanced at the mansion. Harry hasn't been around since this morning. The man had gone somewhere early since then, and Draco didn't dare ask Alden. Draco should be happy. He frowned at the thought. But somehow, he wasn't happy. It feels suffocating and depressing. And Draco was holding back tightly at the emotional impulse that made him want to cry.
"Yes, there is a way for humans like you to stay on Olympus. My wife, Psyche, was a princess of the human kingdom. I love her, and Zeus blessed me. Eventually, she drank Ambrosia and lived as a Titan who can't age,"
No matter how upset Draco's conscience was at the sight of the affair, Draco promised not to comment, let alone be angry about it. Ares was now forced to sit next to his wife to separate Draco from Dionysius. Draco looked confusedly at the War God, who was now hugging his shoulder.
In slow motion, he closed Draco's bedroom door. He did his best not to make the slightest disturbing sound. Harry then stepped both feet closer to Draco, who was fast asleep on his side.
Glenice was Draco's personal servant when the young man officially became queen of this kingdom. Five years was not a short time. Glenice has almost understood the intricacies of her queen's life because of her queen's openness to her.
"Now, let me go before you starve. I'll make breakfast for you," said Narcissa, and she let go of Draco's embrace.
"Abaddon? This is bad," said Icarus. "You can't stay close to Potter. He must be the one who made you get smelled by Abaddon. And I can't track you because Abaddon must have been disguising your whereabouts."
Harry couldn't be that cruel, could he? Draco looked into Harry's eyes with terror, trying to find the truth, but he couldn't find anything. This man was cruel, and who knows what he will do.
The order made Draco straighten his chin arrogantly, "I have introduced myself, and I have brought a drink to the honorable Mr. Potter, so I am leaving," Draco replied curtly as he got up from his seat after all his mission was accomplished.
The prince's lips trembled. Draco harbored fears during his stay in Ares' palace. He never forgot that Ares was a God of War. He tried hard to please him and familiarize himself with the residents of his palace, but it seemed that was not enough for Ares. He still hasn't canceled his sentence saying he no longer wants to share the bed with him.
"Dude, my life is cursed enough right now. What could be worse than this?" The prince said a little sarcastically.
"Erm," Draco gripped the white blanket tightly, trying to hide his naked body, which was full of hickeys and Harry's bites. “Can you bring my breakfast to my room? I'll eat there..." he spoke awkwardly.
With the slowest and gentlest motion possible, Harry lifted Draco's pillow a little. The king’s stout hand moved quickly to reach for the book that managed to disturb his composure. If he remembered, Harry had never seen such a prominent blood-red book in Draco's library.
"Get lost! Before I change my mind!" Vlad hit the wall until it was hollow and cracked. Blood dripped from his hand, but the wound closed quickly and healed.
Without hesitation, Harry stepped closer to Draco. He chuckled in amazement as he saw Draco still emitting an aura of extraordinary elegance in his sleep, unlike Arabelle with her sloppily sleep.
Draco turned around quickly, his eyes widening slightly when he saw his husband was a little further away from his current standing position.
Draco laughed loudly when he heard Cedric's words. "You don't have to say words like that to me again. I'm your brother's wife. You'll never get me," Draco said when he had stopped laughing.
After completing the purchase and buying a guitar bag totaled 110 Pounds Sterling, Draco walked out of the shop and thanked the shop owner. Now the destination is his campus because there is no other goal than to go there. Besides, Draco could ask Luna to teach him some chords he wasn't very good at.
The men in suits were seen gathering and chatting in a corner near the fire, and the women were seen in groups with their friends spread out on all sides of the ballroom. A large serving table in the corner serves a wide variety of fine dining.
Dionysius was not as commonly depicted in classical paintings or art sculptures. He has soft reddish-brown hair, amber eyes, and a charming face. Nor was his body fat like his image of a lazy Wine God who liked to lie down and have fun.
He was Prince Cedric Diggory. One of the many royal families openly glared at the black-haired girl with a hateful look.
Draco had a dream. His body felt light as if he was floating. He felt comfortable like a baby who had never known danger. Then he felt her back touch a slightly complicated but cool surface. His fingers touched the soft mat that he recognized. He was in his own room. Draco was refreshed and woke up after realizing that his husband had been carrying him.
"My plan today is to try to be close to you. I think as husband and wife we should spend more time together," Draco reasoned.
Zeus leaned back in thought. He might have to ask another god or some wise advisers around him, but Athena was one of the Goddesses he consulted the most. The goddess never let him down because she was intelligent and conscientious, but Zeus also knows her sense of justice was sometimes fused with her hatred for Ares.
"I'll run away from here as soon as possible. Don't mind me. I'll be home a few hours after your return to the palace,"
"Because I was the man who conquered the Goddess of Beauty, she said I was her best lover," Ares said. The sentence immediately awakened Draco to reality and his resolve.
The Nymphs completely dressed Troya. He wore a golden silk dress and luxurious jewelry. Musk's scented perfume mixed with pine was also sprinkled on his body. Draco suspected it was Ares's favorite fragrance. Draco made sure Troya's body was covered politely. A thin scarf was attached and wrapped around his shoulder. He did not want to publicly show the beauty of Troya's body just like that.
"That's what I want to ask you. Who are you?" asked Harry, folding his arms over his chest. His muscles were bulging from under the shirt he was wearing.
Draco's body froze. A voice with a strange accent suddenly appeared in response to the question Draco had spoken in his head.
He could see Harry walking towards them from behind Cedric's back with a sinister look on his face. The king seemed to have prepared himself to draw his sword at the enemy in front of his eyes.
When he had enough, Draco pulled his legs back over the edge. The young man took the time to turn around and make sure that Harry was no longer there. After making sure Harry left this place, Draco immediately took off the dress attached to his body.
In one corner, the bartender was busy serving guest requests, and waiters dressed in black and white paced back and forth, offering endless trays of dishes and champagne.
"Why do you look happy? You also want to kill me?" Draco asked irritably, but his voice sounded a little hoarse.
Harry looked at Draco in disbelief. "You think I can do anything else?! I promise you can keep my promise. Now, let me help you drink!”
If he really lived in ancient Greece, he was pretty familiar with the stories dating back to that period. As a big movie actor, Draco played Eros, the God of Love and the son of Aphrodite, who fell in love with Psyche, the youngest daughter of a Greek king and queen.
He appeared in public with the utmost beauty in Troya's body. The finest ivory silk dress covered his perfect sensual curves. His smooth feet were covered with sandals made of buffalo skin. Diamond and ruby-eyed gold jewelry was attached to his neck and wrists. Not only that, a musk-scented perfume wafted from his neck and clothes. The nickname as the most beautiful man in Greece was not an exaggeration.
In Draco's time, stories about aliens were very popular. From the story of the first meeting between aliens and humans in the old film titled ET, Men In Black, who keeps the secrets of alien activities on Earth, to the alien superhero named Thor, who was a member of the Avengers in the Marvel universe.
His stomach rumbled, and he felt thirsty. Since lunch, he hadn't eaten because he was too nervous about plotting his revenge on Harry, and now he was hit by the stone. The food's aroma was so intriguing, the scent of sweet and savory dishes.
"N-No... It's not like that... His majesty didn't hurt me... In fact, it feels amazing," Arabelle stuttered because she felt so embarrassed.
Hagrid, who was opening the cloth covering Draco's furniture, turned his head. "I also don't know why. I tried to open it before, but it still can't. Only two rooms can't be opened. The other is upstairs."
Harry narrowed his eyes when he saw four guards standing right in front of Draco's bedroom door. Although he was not the type of husband who really likes to pay attention to his wife's actions and behavior, he knows that Draco never puts a strict guard around him, especially in front of his own room.
The man, who was bending over his body and crushing Draco's lips, was Harry Potter. Harry was crushing Draco's lips, then he stopped and looked into Draco's eyes, realizing that Draco was awake.
Draco stepped down the stairs. The atmosphere that night was busy. It seemed the owner of the house was having a party. Many women wore ancient dresses along with corsets, while men wore medieval suits and cravats.
Harry was stunned when he saw Draco's appearance reflected from his room. It seemed like Draco was standing by the sleeping lamp beside his bed because his shadow emerged from the window curtains like a dark, erotic silhouette.
Draco turned his head towards Daphne, who was also in the room, tidying up Draco's seemingly endless clothes, and kept coming into Draco's wardrobe.
"Tell me one more time?" Ares asked fiercely at his communication device in the form of a crystal plate attached to his arm.
Draco didn't turn around. The blonde, with all his might, tried to free his hand from Cedric's grip. "Aren't you tired of talking about this all the time?" He asked, sighing wearily as his attempts to free his hand from Cedric's grip were meaningless.
Draco turned his head to find Harry standing at the balcony door, staring at him calmly. The man seemed to have recently come home from work. Draco didn't know because from this balcony; the only view was the backyard and the large swimming pool.
"Yeah, and I'm warning you, Aphrodite. Don't think about hurting him as you did to Psyche. I decided to get married myself." Ares looked into his lover's eyes seriously. In the past, Aphrodite was very jealous of Psyche's beauty which was said to be more than her, and Aphrodite planned many evil things to hurt the girl.
Draco was dumbfounded. His twenty-third birthday was coming. Why did Harry know the details of his birthday? Draco was interested, but he will satisfy Harry if Draco follows him. Maybe that was Harry's goal, so Draco wouldn't get in the rain and follow him.
Alastair exchanged glances with his five comrades. Then the female envoy nodded and looked at the terrified Draco. She grabbed his slender arm and drew her sword.
Draco was surprised to find out that Alastair was the real grandson of Ares. Thinking about it one more time had made Draco realize that he was indeed married to a nearly 2000-year-old man.
Well, that might take a long time. Harry frowned at Draco's expression. This boy must always be forced and still tied up, and Harry actually doesn't like hurting anyone he will sleep with. The proof of his desire was clear, and Draco refused to see him. Harry pushed Draco's body into the shower, letting the warm water soak them both.
Draco was ushered into a lower ballroom, and Harry stood there. The man briefly cast a complimenting glance but said nothing. Even in the car, they drove along in silence. Harry apparently intended to maintain the silence until it reached its destination. But Draco couldn't stand it. The only weapon to keep him from falling for Harry's charms was to challenge him constantly.
Draco jumped in shock. He turned his head, and it was Harry who was standing in the middle of the room. The man seemed to be silent, watching Draco, who was staring out the window. Draco automatically clenched his fists, his impulsive reaction when he noticed Harry's powerful aura filling the room. Harry glanced at Draco's clenched fists, and a sinister smile appeared on his lips.
"That's my problem, Troya. You don't have to worry. No one will be able to force you out of here." Ares smiled, but Draco sensed insincerity from him.
A few minutes passed, now Draco began to raise his right arm. It seemed his body was gradually recovering. He wanted to get out of the place immediately. The strange older man was muttering something right now. His wrinkled hands seemed to be stirring something rotten and dark in his earthenware bowl.
"I mean what I said earlier, Draco. I want to be in a relationship with you. I can't stand just watching you from afar." Cedric said as he looked straight at Draco. He stared at Cedric expressionlessly.
Natalie was sensitive to Draco's mood swings. She immediately grabbed the arm of the King in a spoiled manner. "Your Majesty, I'm so tired. Can we go back first?" Natalie asked in a spoiled tone as she blinked a few times at the older man.
Draco had been conquered in the enchantment of Harry's fabulously skillful desire. And now that fear is all over him, what if in the end he gives up and happily becomes a bitch who's willing to be Harry's lover, kneeling at that man's feet like any other woman?
Draco determined as he took Alastair's hand, who would guide him into the horse carriage. Draco thought back, in his time, there was such a thing as a magician. Even Draco had seen David Copperfield's fly in a bubble around the theater without a harness. The vulture that turned giant could be a super sophisticated magic trick.
His plan failed. He hadn't even had time to walk more than six meters. Hector caught his hand and pulled him away.
Draco had to survive, even though now that was doubtful because Draco was in the hands of a very cruel Hyde. Harry will do everything he can to get Draco back, safe, and alive.
Ares couldn't say that to Troya—the Prince of Sparta who had only been his wife for a few days. The young man did not work with his approach. There was something about him that was strange and different. As if he was not part of the humans living in Greece.
"You said this was your first marriage, but I don't see anything special about this. So I doubt if we really are husband and wife?" Draco asked.
The water slid smoothly down Draco's throat, drenching his thirst. For a moment, when the water had completely moved, Harry was still playing on Draco's lips, toying with him.
"I didn't say I agreed. But I wanted to give it a try," Harry replied. "If I don't find the right person, then what?"
Harry followed Draco's gaze and smiled. "I just wanted to take a shower, but it looks like you are more interested in something else."
Harry drew out his fingers and wiped them on Draco's cheek, making Draco's body shiver. "My man make their own decisions and mix the drug in your drink,"
"M-My boss... S-Someone killed him. I don't know who, I'm still in the store. Please, I'm starting to panic," Draco tried to say what he could.
sign. Because of that sign's presence or absence, accidents still happen because when the car in front stops, the back car in the back can possibly bump into whatever is in front of it.
But Ares couldn't force his horse to enter the dense Pine forest and walked around. The prince of Sparta could be dying. Even one second means a lot right now. Ares chose to leave Herion and continued his journey on foot. The over two-thousand-year-old god was confident in his running speed. He walked through the remaining narrow gap.
Both Harry and Draco immediately frowned in confusion when they heard Arabelle's words until her hand moved to lift her flower dress in a trembling motion.
"I think so. I want, every time you see that little bird, you have to remember me," said Cedric in a tone that was full of threats.
Draco's heart was beating twice as fast as he realized the meaning of his string of words a few seconds ago. It wasn't that he was blushing. Instead, there was a feeling of irritability in his mind—sourced from his common sense. Let's say this man in front of Draco is the ruler of all things, but apparently, he's not very good at controlling his own thoughts.
He would never let fear and confusion blind him. After all, Draco was a queen. He had unlimited power in this kingdom.
Harry just smiled, took a white towel, tied it around his waist, and walked away casually. Leaving Draco still transfixed under the shower. Harry was so turned on. Draco didn't have to hold it to find out that the evidence of Harry's cock had stood out shamelessly.
The blond himself was completely spent and couldn't have gotten up if he'd tried. His muscles were sore and tired, his abdomen tense after all the time Harry had forced orgasm from him. He felt disgustingly dirty, having been unable to get up and shower after their…activities. He was covered with sweat and semen, both his and Harry's.
"...Harry!" Draco gasped, repeating the name like a mantra between his cries. His words were muffled as Harry covered his mouth with his own, kissing him heatedly.
The night wind was getting stronger. The wind was competing to blow Draco's long, soft blonde mane. The sound of powerful thunderbolts began to shout at each other.
"What's wrong?" Draco asked when Harry groaned again. His fingers gently rubbed Harry's shoulders and back, which were now smooth with soap.
Draco noticed Arabelle's attitude. He glanced briefly at Arabelle's hand on his husband's arm, then glanced at her in turn.
"Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that. But for now, it all sounds wrong. I'm your cousin's wife. Those feelings shouldn't grow." Draco said, frustrated.
"So, I and some of the best guards out there are going to have a power contest. We're making you a betting target... uh, I mean, whoever will be the victor between us will be given a chance to clash swords with you. How about that, doesn't that sound fun, Draco?" Cedric was excited and full of enthusiasm, like a child trying to persuade his mother to buy him the newest toy.
"We are Sparta! We are not easily defeated. My agreement with Oracle is one-sided. I will demand renegotiation."
Somehow the feeling of shame and humiliation creeps up Draco's mind. What a shame! Could it be that there was hidden inside him a whore ready to explode? Or could it be that Harry is just so skilled at flirting that it almost makes Draco bend his knees?
Draco wanted this horse. He was just about to turn around and announce to his entourage that he wanted the dashing-looking brown horse, but the sound of a horse suddenly shrieking made Draco stop in his tracks.
Even though this time, Draco was wearing a crown that was smaller in size than the royal crown that remained on their kingdom, it didn't prevent Draco's powerful and elegant aura.
When it was still night, Ares relied on the rays of the stars and moon in the clear sky to light his way. He meets his lover Aphrodite in a Greek city that humans also inhabited. Most humans wouldn't have thought that there was a real god that was staying there.
Draco flinched when he heard Harry's words. Did his husband worry about him? Yes, Harry might have been worried. After all, Draco was a queen of a big kingdom. If a queen was sick, of course, the kingdom can't function properly.
"You want to go out, huh?" Harry gripped Draco's arm again, in the same place that Draco felt his arm would bruise later. "Let me take you out!"
"It's useless. Why are we trying to look good in front of people who don't like us? I never thought about it," Ares seemed confused.
The chatty pumpkin only grimly felt neglected as Draco scribbled on his paper with jokes and complaints about the Spartans while chuckling occasionally. Sometimes the prince feels guilty, but all of that helps him stay sane in living in a world without electricity and technology as it is today. So, Draco would think of it as harmless psychiatric therapy.
Draco immediately took another step back away from Harry, his heart racing, and started to feel scared. "Okay, I'll put it on, you get out of here first!" he shouted angrily at being forced to surrender, tears almost dripping from his eyes.
He didn't want to wait for the King to decide his fate. Draco doesn't know how he got to go. Perhaps he would never meet Ares' messenger. The palace of Sparta was heavily guarded, especially since the misfortune that befell Troya. Although he felt free to roam all this time, he always saw a guard watching him. Hector actually didn't need to escort him yesterday.
He looked at a dark brown horse that looked so striking compared to the others. The horse looked so fresh compared to the other horses tied with it as if it had indeed prepared itself to serve its master on this still chilly morning. Slowly but surely, Draco stepped closer to the dark brown horse. Arriving in front of the horse, his hand reached out to gently stroke the top of the horse's head.
"That night, you drained a lot of blood, and Mr. Potter, who happened to be the same blood type as yours, forced us to draw his blood for you. Actually, we shouldn't do it, Mr. Potter also just survived the same accident, but he insisted and threatened. And it's true what they say, no one will dare to go against what Harry Potter says. After all, he is the owner of this hospital. His orders must be carried out."
Draco's starting to think. Because he still doesn't understand the phrase 'originally does not take sides'. "What does 'do not take sides' mean?"
Draco knew that was the time. That's where Harry loses his temper, which is why Draco jumps up and tries to escape to the door. He managed to open the door slightly, before, with a quicker and more silent movement, Harry was already behind him, pushing the door shut again before it could be opened.
Ares took the initiative to embrace and then carry him. Draco struggled for a moment and felt awkward, but Ares didn't care. His high curiosity had made him neglect to be polite. The Prince of Sparta asks about him, so Ares introduced himself.
"If you don't like it, don't watch it," Draco said. "What do you really want? I told you I would bring someone else to learn to love you."
Draco blinked his eyes. "I'm looking for Harry," He showed Alden the envelope, "Here... I want to return these files."
Draco's shoulders tightened, a blush creeping across his face. The silk dress he was wearing shifted too quickly, and Draco screamed in panic when he felt the touch of the War God's hand under his clothes without his knowledge when he did it.
In a simple but beautiful dress, Draco sat in a chair that he had deliberately placed right in front of the glass window of his room in the Delion Kingdom palace. Draco looked up at the beautiful night sky, occasionally decorated by a flash of marvelous lightning.
"All you have to think about now is, you will also meet Aphrodite later. My advice, try to dress more modestly. She won't like it when someone is younger and prettier than her," Eros said half-jokingly.
Draco sneered. He finally returned to his half of the soup. He occasionally stole glances at the glasses boy at the Gryffindor table and quickly looked away when their eyes met.
Even though the king loved him very much, Troya did not grow into a spoiled and annoying prince. That's because when the king didn't see, his jealous siblings often bullied him. Troya, who was afraid of getting more hostile, never dared to complain to his father.
Without realizing it, Draco rolled his eyes. Maybe the people were too dazzled by Harry's good looks, so they're all blind with all his real nature.
"Your Majesty!" Cedric's loud voice was accompanied by his hand moving to throw the sword in his hand.
Draco started thinking that if Icarus doesn't even know, he's in danger, how does Harry know he's in danger?
When Draco was sitting on the horse, to be precise, in front of Harry, Harry quickly spurred on his horse. But a delicate frown instantly graced Draco's smooth forehead when he realized that the horse they were currently riding was turning in the wrong direction.
"Why do you always make me feel like I don't deserve to be with you?" Cedric’s words managed to make a frown appear on Draco's forehead.
"Sorry... Sorry..." Arabelle’s voice shaking vigorously. It seemed that the girl was about to cry again.
"I want you to make this an assignment," said Professor Trelawney, who was tidying up her books. "Find out the purpose of this demon and angel of love for each other, and I will make this assignment your big project, submitted at the end of this semester. Have a nice day, everyone." Professor Trelawney stepped out of the classroom.
"What do you want to do?" Draco asked with difficulty as he felt his hands and lips creep downward more and more.
Draco's already reddened face was getting redder. He felt very ashamed of the wild thoughts that had previously filled his head. How could Harry want to spend the night with him? He already had Arabelle, a mistress, ready to satisfy him at any moment.
"I'm disinclined to comment on the way you fight. But I think that's too cowardly. The female Amazonian warriors fought better than you. Besides, you didn't answer my question, Athena," Ares replied sarcastically.
Draco was still trying to analyze the current situation. Slowly, he was able to overcome the awkwardness and began to think logically. He couldn't carelessly open his mouth. He couldn't joke and laugh as he had with Alastair and Ares' envoy before. He was just a human who had lost his freedom. A prince who was called the most beautiful in Greece but was not immortal. A human who knew nothing about Olympus and its gods and was not yet twenty years old.
"Relax, Ares just told us to wait. That doesn't mean we can't eavesdrop," Draco said. He tossed his beautiful hair to the side to make it easier to hear. Alastair just shrugged and sighed.
"Well, if you don't like him, let another Titan have him. Yesterday you said he was a gift from a bet made by the gods, right? Is Dion also included?"
Lucius chuckled at Draco's words. His words reminded him of Narcissa—Draco's mother, who was very firm in her principles, but unfortunately, now the woman who had given birth to Draco had united with the earth and was slowly but surely, being forgotten by people.
Draco's body stiffened when he saw Cedric seemed to have just come out of Draco's room. The other man looked at Draco in surprise. For God's sake, was it looked that weird?
who worships Athena, being closely watched by an overprotective father, and being a mere display of Sparta's pride with the title of
In the past, they loved each other. In the past, the world seemed to only belong to Draco and Harry. Harry will always be beside him wherever he was, and vice versa.
"I am truly jealous of Your Majesty's heart. How can Your Majesty consider His Majesty's mistress as your own sister? If I were Your Majesty, I would have considered her a pest that must be exterminated." Natalie grumbled subconsciously.
"Why are you looking for me, Prince Cedric?" Draco asked. He straightened his back like a typical nobility.
Even though the forest was still lit up by a bit of light from the sun and the wind that was still blowing sent a chill to the bones, the group of humans remained enthusiastic.
"Prince Cedric, what are you doing?!" Draco pulled the nearby blanket up to cover his body. He doesn't know why he did that. Draco just moved spontaneously.
Hades was the God of Death and was believed to inhabit Tartarus—the underworld where the spirits of Greek humans who have died live. He was there guarding them with the minor god Thanatos and the monster Cerberus, a large three-headed dog.
"I disagree, Zeus! Ares is our son. It would be too pathetic for him to be eliminated from the twelve gods of Olympus!" Hera didn't want to accept it.
Draco narrowed his eyes and saw Harry sitting over there, in the dim light of his room. "Why did you enter my room without permission!?" Draco screamed in surprise, his hands fumbling for the light switch on the wall, trying to shake off the darkness surrounding Harry because he looked even scarier in the dim light.
Alden looked at Draco carefully. "Yes, a ridiculous offer, but it immediately made master Harry change his mind."
Harry couldn't help but smile in amusement as he saw Arabelle wearing a crown of fresh flowers over her thick black hair. Really, his
People who greeted him while bowing and dressed in old-fashioned clothes might as well be paid. They could all be actors. However, as an actor, he knows. No modern era colossal film uses original properties for all its processes. Most of the mind-blowing action scenes were done on green screens and edited using sophisticated computer skills—CGI.
"Arabelle and I have a good relationship. I consider her as my own sister, so... I never feel angry at His Majesty or Arabelle when they are together because they are a couple. They deserve to do that," Draco explained as he understood the meaning of the look of pity and confusion that the King gave him.
"Ah, look at that bird!" Draco exclaimed, shrieking slightly when he saw a small brown bird fall helplessly to the ground with a small arrow adorning one of its wings. Apparently, the bird had previously been used as a target for prey.
"Ah yes, sorry in advance if this question sounds rude. But... Are you sick? Your hands feel so cold. I can even feel it even though I'm wearing gloves," Draco looked at Charles worriedly.
"You changed your mind?" Harry was a little flabbergasted, but he quickly controlled himself. Inevitably, Harry was relieved to learn of the fact that Draco had changed his mind and was willing to be his Mate for a while.
"Thank you for being willing to accept it gracefully. I don't think any other noble will ever accept their husband's mistress in their own residence," said Harry sincerely while looking at Draco's beautiful face.
Ares laughed at his mother's words. "I guess you haven't forgotten how the people of Olympus view me, Goddess Hera. There is Hermes who always faithfully obeys Zeus' orders, there is Dionysius who often behaves well, and Apollo who is popular among the Titans. I won't stand a chance."
Harry leaned against the wall and squeezed his throbbing forehead, his chest aching and hurting. So, this feels like... Seeing Draco in pain almost made him explode in distress, and it was all because his enemies were about to harm him.
With his thoughts running wild, Harry wrapped Draco's scarf, which he had just pulled from the boy's wardrobe, around the boy's slender neck, which was now looking a little pathetic.
The War God smiled faintly. "Unfortunately, I can't do that. If the humans disobey, my job is to punish them," He said.
It looked really sexy from down here, and Harry gritted his teeth fiercely. He was merely ready to explode, and Draco made everything worse by his reflection in the window — even though he didn't mean it — and Harry was really ready to explode in its truest meaning now that his cock is so hard till it hurts.
Oh, God! They looked the same! Like twins separated. The woman in the picture looks elegant and feminine. Draco was stunned. Who was that woman?
It was the most beautiful dress Draco had ever seen. And again, what the hell! Harry told him to wear a dress? Has that man gone mad?
"Is everything all right, master?" Alden appeared. He was indeed on guard duty and was worried to see Harry just leaning against the wall.
"Leave that to me," Ron reassured the Alpha. "Anyone who dares to judge you as a freak—everyone knows who you are. You're an Alpha. Instead of judging you as weird like a lonely stalker, they'll be happy to accept your invitation without a second thought."
Didn't Draco say that he wasn't Mr. Potter's boyfriend? But why did Mr. Potter look jealous when he fed Draco? Doctor Jason wondered, then shook his head.
"Then you have to stop acting like that, understand? If you repeat what you did like before in the garden, staring at Greyson with your cute, innocent face again, Daddy will really show Greyson who has the right of you. This is your first warning, understand?"
Draco never asked his mother to make anything. Because whatever Narcissa cooks, Draco will definitely eat it. "Whatever mom cooks, I'll finish it."
Harry puffed with anger. "That window!" he pointed furiously, then strode across the room and closed the window harshly. He turned to face Draco in a fighting position. "Next time, close the windows tightly at night!!" he shouted in anger.
"My son, love is poison. Sweet poison. In the beginning, it will give you happiness, but in the end... you will even forget how to smile because of the poison," sneered Lucius with a crooked smile.
Demigods were not common in Greece. No one can really confirm it. They could not go to Olympus and force the gods to confess that they had impregnated their daughter. Draco could see that the rest of the palace was now chattering between fear and amazement at the confession. Not one but five people. One of them claimed to be a demigod, then what about the others?
"I'll make a deal with you. I'll give you ten days to come back to your home. And after that, you'll come back here to learn to love me."
"Prince of Sparta, would you like to have a romantic consultation with me? I am the God of Love. I think I can help you,"
After a tremendous upheaval of heart and mind, Glenice finally decided to answer Draco's question. "I was thinking if His Royal Highness and his stepmother were having an intimate relationship, if not... they might have had sex before."
Draco placed his hands on Harry's back, feeling the other's muscles tense under his fingers with every one of his thrusts. He sensed the tension in Harry's body as he approached climax, his breathing becoming irregular and his limbs starting to tremble as the first wave of pleasure washed over him.
"Prince Troya is the favorite of Spartan people. How can you let ordinary guards escort him?" Hector stated firmly. Draco felt a pain in the upper part of his stomach. His heart suddenly mourned when he saw Hector.
Before Arabelle managed to open her mouth to answer Harry's question, the king's emerald eyes had already caught Cedric coming out of the royal guard training area while carrying a young man in his arms.
"Why are you still here? Wasn't your tent prepared by the guards?" asked Cedric to start a conversation between them.
When Draco tried to resist once more, Harry gripped both of his hands tightly against the wall and pressed his body together, gluing the evidence of his desire to the center of Draco's body, making Draco's face flush red.
The smile on Doctor Jason's face never faded until Draco realized the two men in front of him were so contrasting, one was so cold with the dark and gloomy tones that surrounded him, and the other looked so bright, full of smiles as if he were carrying the sun on his head.
