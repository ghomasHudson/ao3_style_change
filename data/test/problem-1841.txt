” Kingsley stressed tiredly, shooting the boy a pleading look. Harry frowned and Draco quirked his lips.
The Slytherin flopped back onto the couch and gazed down at his friend still sprawled on the carpet. “Why are you only in your boxers?” He asked suddenly, raising a groomed eyebrow suspiciously.
Draco cocked his head curiously at the question. “You wouldn’t mind if I dated a Muggle?”
Blaise grinned and rose from the couch, turning to meet the figure his friend was gesturing towards. “Pleasure to meet yo—” The Slytherin stopped and raised an interested eyebrow, an amused smirk slowly drawing its way into his lips.
but you really feel the same as me, is that it?” The blonde deadpanned with the quirk of an unimpressed brow—to which Harry sent his own pouting frown back.
“Ah...” Harry opened his mouth to finally refute the man, but he quickly turned on his heel and stalked away before any words could escape the Gryffindor’s lips.
“Ah. Guess I used a bit too much power. Pity,” The snatcher remarked casually.
Hermione and Ron sat at the table, both somewhat shell shocked at the unbelievable story that they were being told.
"Wanna bet,
“It looks like you’ll have to get leaving in a few minutes. The Department hasn’t given many specifics of this mission, so there isn’t a required time which you need to be out or return by...” The older man stroked his mustache thoughtfully. “If It were me, I’d try to find any evidence of the group of snatchers in question and check the surrounding area—you two should probably only be out for a few hours at most. Once you’ve done that, return back here with a report on your findings.”
"It wasn't there when he was in surgery, correct?" Davies asked.
"Potter and I have lived in this flat together for just over a year now. What you saw earlier was a normal part of a relationship—it's called shagging, not that you two would have any knowledge of that." He cast a cool smirk down at the both of them, and was pleased to note that he saw Ron's facial color go from purple to slightly green.
"I coulda told you that much..." Florence grumbled impatiently.
...,” Draco sniffed indignantly and took a sip of coffee. “My story of course starts differently than his, but I would still say that there are
"I don't want to be known anymore as the pureblooded snob Draco Malfoy, son of a Death Eater and hater of Muggles and Muggleborns."
“I see...That’s a good choice...,” Kingsley accepted with a nod, taking the quill from Harry’s hand and transferring it to Draco’s. “And your request, Draco..?”
“Don’t look so nervous, Potter,” Blaise consoled with a sympathetic grin. “Pans and Theo aren’t nearly as bad as you think they are.”
Harry, thankfully suspecting that his lover was about to do something stupid and embarrassing, was able to tamp down the better part of his reaction—but he still couldn’t fight the slight blush rising to his cheeks. It was nothing though, compared to the full-on rush of blood that went straight to Ron’s face—coloring it a vivid a red.
"Ow...bloody hell..."
“Easy now, just take a seat,” Kingsley gestured Harry back to his chair as he went around the desk and sat back in his own chair. “You fainted while we were discussing your new assignment.”
Kingsley frowned. "While it's true that I am extremely worried for Mr. Potter's well being, Healer Davies, he is not the only reason that I am here." He paused and cast a meaningful glance towards Draco. "Mr. Malfoy was also injured, and I am concerned for both of them. I always visit St. Mungo's whenever any of my Aurors are injured."
The sound of something sizzling in a pan answered his question, and he meandered over to the kitchen—finding his blonde lover already busy preparing food—pots and pans simmering on the stove and ingredients stacked on the counters.
"I tried dating her, but I never truly fell in love with her. I love her as a sister, but nothing in the romantic sense. After that I took a break from dating—honestly I never really tried to find someone to date. But after a while, I realized it was just because I didn't find an attraction to women—I felt myself drawn to men....." Harry tried to explain himself logically, but he didn't know if he was making any sense.
“Draco, honestly...I’m a full grown man, I’m pretty sure I can take it...”
Harry nodded and passed the sheet of parchment back, frowning slightly. “That sounds brilliant...But no offense sir—what exactly does this have to do with
Draco threw a glare over at the dark skinned male. “Oh bugger off Blaise, I don’t wanna hear that from
The small band of snatchers were still holding the chained Hippogriff, but the creature had started to show signs of stirring.
Kingsley nodded in understanding, quietly conjuring a quill and parchment to take notes as Draco continued.
Apparently, that was all that Ron could take.
He shuddered and tried to wipe the memory from his brain. “Ah, so you work with Zabini then?”
Sure enough, though it wasn’t immediately noticeable in the dim lighting, a thin silvery chain was looped several times around the Hippogriff’s neck—the remains hanging limply and trailing behind the beast as it walked.
Polite clapping ensued, with some of the more friendly Aurors whistling enthusiastically as Harry emerged from an adjoining room behind the podium where Kingsley stood—moving until he was in the center of the room and stood facing Kingsley.
Harry leaned up and placed his mouth next to Draco's face to whisper hotly in his ear.
“Well then—I’m sure you’ll spare none of the details, right Draco?” Theo quipped with a knowing smirk, staring down his friend with a mischievous sparkle in his eyes.
"Fine. You're right—I
“I won the wager on whether Draco was gay or not,” He reminded her with a devious smirk. “Didn’t you lose about 50 Galleons on that bet...?”
"....Change...my mind......?" Harry seemed confused at the wording, and repeated the question slowly.
“Ah c’mon, what’s it gonna hurt? Just spill!” Pansy grinned evilly.
“Those jeans were limited edition, 500 galleon, vintage distressed,
Draco hesitated before stiffly nodding. “Thanks.”
"—‘cause it matches your eyes."
"Urg...Knightly...Kingsley?" Harry blinked to focus his eyes, taking in the figures hovering over him. He looked around the room next, catching sight of Healer Davies. "What happened? Am I...at St. Mungo's?"
The older Auror did so, begrudgingly, and resumed his perch a short distance away on the bed next to Draco's.
Harry sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. "
Florence gave a quick glance around. He had successfully apparated them directly outside the entrance to the Ministry of Magic—as close as you could get with the protective wards that were up. “Not bad, not bad! Alright then! Off to the Ministers office!”
Harry gasped and held a hand to his chest. “S-surprised?! Of course I am! Kingsley, I thought you were firing me!” He stood up and exclaimed a bit too loudly.
“That may be so, but I need to see them. Those two were on a mission for the Aurors and I need to discuss the information they retrieved immediately—it’s extremely time sensitive and important.” He wasn’t exactly telling the truth, but he knew that one way or another he had to get in to see them—and he really didn’t like flexing his ‘
Davies cleared his throat and resumed. "After we were sure that both Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy were safe and free of the dark magic that had been inflicting their wounds, we thought that we were in the free and clear. Unfortunately though, we were wrong."
Knightly was the first to break the silence. "What," he whispered in horror, "in the name of bloody hell...was that."
Draco watched as Harry paced around the room, combing his fingers through his hair absentmindedly as he tended to do when in deep thought. There was a deep frown marring his face, and his dark brows were drawn down unhappily towards his emerald eyes- leaving the blonde with the slight feeling a guilt starting to creep its way into his chest.
..please....."
Kingsley nodded solemnly. “When Aurors decide to become partners, their first and foremost priority is the protection of themselves, and their partner. The contract is just to help enforce the seriousness of that.”
“Turn it around?” Harry furrowed his brows in thought before twisting his wand—prompting the blonde to do the same.
and you....you..were......"
"Hmm? Oh, I think 4:00..." Harry glanced at the clock in the wall. "It's 2:00 now, which
"Now, where were we......"
"He's having a nightmare."
Draco took a careful gulp of the cool water before bringing the glass down and holding it with both hands. “Harry and I...we went on a mission together....” He made a face as he tried to recall what had happened. “We...started walking and we saw a Hippogriff....then a group of snatchers showed up....”
Harry struggled and finally removed Draco’s hand from over top his mouth.
“When we got to the spot where they were at—Laimen forest—we found them both sprawled in the ground, unconscious....Harry had a pretty serious gash on his chest, and it wouldn’t close with any healing spells that we threw at it.”

be an arse when they came over,
“Oh you don’t, Eh?” Blaise cut in with a drawl, smirking deviously at the girl. “Then you shouldn’t forget that you now owe
Draco sprinted in the opposite direction of the Hippogriff, dragging Harry behind him, and pulled them into hiding behind a dense thicket of bushes.
"Well, Uh....you were just here....a little bit ago.....before you passed out from the wards......." The dark haired wizard supplied slowly—desperately praying though, that it wouldn't trigger any lightbulbs.
“Well, I hate to break it you Pans, but I actually am. See, doctor outranks nurse, thus I’m a higher rank than you—thus making me your superior.”
“You two did excellent today. I’m glad everything went accordingly...” Kingsley remarked as he levitated a teapot and poured liquid into the mug sitting on the coffee table in front of him.
All Florence could do was thank Draco for being sensible enough to send a patronus message back to the Ministry to him. The silvery-white cloud had flown through the air and into Florence’s office—materializing in the air in front of his desk in the form of a
Harry nodded and glanced to his side to see Draco follow suit.
“You are bloody
“I decided to keep his name out of the department system for various reasons. Mostly because I didn’t want anyone making a fuss before he even started officially working here.”
Harry scratched the back of his neck awkwardly. “Well, I dunno...I just thought it might have something to do with the whole ‘Savior of the Wizarding World’ thing, y’know? People still treat me differently because of it...”
All eyes trained expectantly on Davies as the healer took his place in the center of their group. "Now," he started, flourishing his arms about as he spoke. "I can imagine the great deal of questions you all must have as to the unpleasant circumstances that have brought us all together on this day." He paused, clasping his hands behind his back and pacing. "When Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Potter were brought here, they were both in grave conditions. Mr. Potter was our priority, however, because he had sustained several large lacerations that were bleeding profusely. What we hadn't realized though, was that Mr. Malfoy had sustained just as grave of injuries—only his weren't visible to the eye."
Harry smirked and returned the kiss with one of his own as he rolled off of the bed and stretched his arms over his head.
." Harry's tone took on a teasing lilt as he called the blonde's surname—smirking a bit despite the petulant scowl the grey eyes were directing towards him.
"Just.....promise you'll tell us if he does anything bad to you." The redhead begged with a groan, scowling at the smirking face that Draco returned.
." He retorted instead, balking at the hideous maroon jumper that the other male had just grabbed off of a hanger.
“What do you guys think?” There was mischievous twinkle in Kingsley’s eyes as he turned the parchment around and read each word out loud.
His large body slumped forwards onto the floor, and Hermione reached forwards in concern.
Now at St. Mungo’s—with half of the entire medical staff up and in a tither, trying desperately to mend the two young injured wizards—Florence couldn’t tamp down the immense feelings of fear and guilt that tore at his heart.
Hermione released a shaky breath and held her head in her hands- shaking it confusedly.
The blonde shrugged and made an
“I tried to tell him that we couldn’t take in that many, we were outnumbered....But he still wanted to and rushed out after he decked me.”
“I understand,” He relented with a sigh. “I wish to go see Mr. Malfoy for now.”
Harry could barely nod, already bracing himself for the pain.
Harry exhaled in annoyance and turned his attention back to Davies, who began to personally inspect the wound.
Draco smirked evilly and reached for his lover’s hand. “What’s wrong Weaslebe? You upset because I snatched him first?” The blonde turned and kissed Harry’s hand gently before pulling on it to get him to sit down.
“No you
"Gentleman," he turned to Kingsley and Knightly and made polite shooing motions. "If you would please."
Harry’s heart immediately dropped and his palms felt sweaty. This was the first time Kingsley had ever only dismissed Florence and asked him to stay.
Draco gave the pair of stunned Gryffindors a wink as he leaned over and captured his lover's lips—moving his own against them only briefly before releasing them.
“Come to think of it, you two can never seem to beat me at a bet—can you~?” The dark skinned wizard crooned gleefully, earning scowls from both Theo and Pansy.
“....You really like this show that much?” Draco questioned with a snort, sinking down onto the couch next to the tanned Slytherin.
“Wow, I cant believe you guys actually went through with it and made the Unbreakable Vow...” Blaise commented seriously, his expression giving way to the honest surprise that he felt.
“What? You’ve got a problem with
Harry peered over to where Kingsley and another person who he presumed to be another healer were huddled over Draco's bed. "Is...something wrong?" he asked Davies.
....." Harry groaned and arched his back in pleasure at the sensation on his neck—though that wasn't the only place he was feeling it.
Draco turned a slightly appalled look on his lover. “You invited them here without even telling them who was going to be here, and
“That’s...not true...” She refuted with a scowl.
Ron frowned deeply and glanced around as well. "Your wards knocked us out?"
Seeing as he usually went out for dinner with Ron and Hermione once a week, questions regarding his dating status were frequent—and he had to make up a menagerie of excuses to cover for his actual relationship status concerning the Slytherin. Hermione and Ron were also employees of the Ministry—but being that they were in different departments, they weren't even informed that he and Draco were Auror partners. But, enough was enough—Harry decided that he finally wanted to come clean to them—starting with them coming over to his and Draco's apartment for dinner......
"Doing just fine, eh?" Florence remarked coldly, glancing pointedly at the blood coming through the bandages. "If he's doing so fine, then why the bloody hell is he still losing blood?!"
Kingsley sighed and stood up, patting Florence’s shoulder. “Alright. Thank you, my friend.”
The jinx was uttered and Harry distantly recalled steeling himself for the jolt of pain as his eyes slipped closed and darkness consumed him—but not before he saw a flash of platinum blonde.
“Alright, who wants to make a suggestion?”
Draco quickly snagged his cellphone off of the counter and shoved it into his jeans pocket before navigating to the lower level bathroom.
..I think Florence came up with that one...Of course I think he took it off the contract before they actually swore on it, haha!”
Harry smirked at his predictable boyfriend and retrieved his own wand off of the coffee table to assist in levitating and moving the couch.
Pansy pursed her lips with a slight pout, and Theo sent an unimpressed look over to Blaise—the first actual facial movement that Harry had seen from the male.
“Enter.” Came the deep, booming voice from the other side—and suddenly the doors opened by themselves, revealing the figure of Kingsley sitting behind his desk.
"I'm gonna be sick...." The redhead muttered—then promptly proceeded to faint with a large
Kingsley nodded and pulled another sheet from the envelope, staring at it for a long moment before sighing heavily and finally passing it to Harry. “We received a grievance from one Draco Malfoy about not being able to obtain work, due to his family being a known supporter of Voldemort...”
“Then if we get that chain, it’ll be evidence against the snatchers!” Harry continued excitedly. “There may even be a chance that we could use the chain to track the snatchers!”
Pansy threw an annoyed look down at the dark skinned male and pursed her lips as she sank into the seat next to him. “You’re not my superior Blaise.”
not exactly. But I think we both agreed that that entire situation was
“I do have to say though, this story is turning out to be a whole lot more interesting than I thought it was going to be~” Blaise crooned gleefully.
Harry remained frozen as well, scared of the reactions of his two friends. Before he could even bring himself to utter a single word however, he felt a pair of warm lips suddenly descend upon his own.
Normally they were both above delivering lovey-dovey sticky sweet sentiments to each other—they both openly showed their affections, but usually in not so many words. The shock of having a full blown love confession delivered to Draco was enough for his heart to skip several beats, and he chose to respond by returning the hug—burying his face into his lover's neckline and breathing in his calming scent.
Blaise was still sacked out against the cushions of the sofa as he continued to hurl insults towards the television screen—waving a hand around violently for apparent increased emphasis. Draco sighed in defeat. There was no way that he was going to be able to convince Blaise to leave now that he had immersed himself in the middle of an episode of his favorite show.
“Yeah, for when we do apron play~” The blonde bit his lip and dropped his voice down seductively. “I can watch your sexy naked behind make me breakfast in that frilly apron I bought from—
“Wai—Hold on, Potter!” Draco hissed quickly when Harry took a daring step towards the Hippogriff. He reached out a hand to hold Harry back when he heard subsequent branches snapping. He snapped his head around anxiously towards the sounds before grabbing Harry roughly by the back of his robe.
“Put another chain around its wings so that it doesn’t fly off again,” The fourth wizard advised as he surveyed the other three wizards. He seemed to be the boss of the operation.
"That's just it Blackwell," Davies explained in exasperation. "He was doing fine—very well, in fact. Mr. Malfoy was as well. As soon as we tried to treat Mr. Potter's wounds though, the strangest thing happened."
“Oh just bloody great—more Slytherins...” Ron mumbled under his breath, taking his seat with no great amount of enthusiasm.
“Well, I’m Theodore Nott—please just call me Theo though. Friend of Draco’s since we were kids...I’m now a Healer at St. Mungo’s that specializes in the use of potions for anesthetic as well as for the purpose of healing ailments.”
Harry took a deep breath and swallowed the lump in his throat before nodding. “...I swear.”
“Ah, damn...” She muttered with a scowl, reopening her purse and relocating several of the gold disks into Blaise’s outstretched hand—which he transferred to his pocket with a triumphant grin.
Draco frowned as he glanced around again. “Whe-Where am I?” He croaked with a grimace, swallowing painfully. He grunted and shifted himself into a reclined sitting position—still glancing around apprehensively.
“There you go, 10 minutes,” Draco reiterated to his lover, who nodded in response.
“Oi, who do you think you are—” Ron started indignantly, but shut up when given a pointed look by Harry.
“No matter—no harm done I suppose,” The dark skinned male continued, offering the pair of Gryffindors a bright grin. “Let me fully introduce myself then. Blaise Zabini—best and one of only three friends of the snarky ice prince Draco Malfoy. We went to school together...not that you guys probably remember me since I was in Slytherin, obviously...”
Though he still looked the same for the most part, Draco’s entire demeanor seemed far more mature than it had just a few years ago when Harry had seen him at Hogwarts.
“Ah—Minister!” He hastily stood and smoothed the front of his robes down, doing the best he could to compose himself after being caught asleep by his superior.
Harry cringed and sent his lover a horrified look.
“Well,
"Yes, sir!" One of the nurses squeaked, dashing out of the door.
His protests seemed to fall on deaf ears as Kingsley merely dismissed them with a smile and a wave of his hand.
"Draco, where...."
The impact of the spell actually didn’t hurt that much, much to Draco’s astonishment. It had been enough to knock him over, but other than that he really didn’t feel any different. He looked down at himself and then glanced over at Harry. Neither of them looked any different either. He frowned and quickly resumed his spell chanting, his puzzlement replaced with an increasing worry as Harry’s wound still refused to mend. Draco had been casting healing charms for long enough that there should have been some noticeable difference in Harry’s condition—but nothing seemed different.
"Please do make yourself at home! If I'd have known you'd be dining with us tonight I'd have prepared something a bit simpler to suit your poor tastes." Draco quipped as Ron and Hermione took their seats at the table—both shooting Draco a glare to his back.
"Well I
!” Hermione chastised.
The older man stared them both in the eye to make sure they were paying attention.
Harry and Draco exchanged weary glances at the sudden demand.
“Well I happen to think that’s bloody ridiculous,” Blaise muttered as he reached into his pocket and withdrew his wand. “Step aside,” The dark skinned male demanded with a slight swish of the wrist, sending the unsuspecting blonde sprawling on the floor.
He and Draco had been successfully dating for over two years without telling another soul- and Draco seemed perfectly content with keeping it that way.
“The rest of you—this way.”
my fault,” Harry pouted.
“Don’t worry, it’ll be done and over before you know it,” He assured quietly, removing his wand from the confines of his silk robes and raising it slightly. “Now face each other, please.”
"In the meantime, I think we should apply more of the healing potion onto both Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy's wounds while they're under anesthesia," Davies suggested, turning to Blackwell. "What do you think?"
“That’s probably just because you’re so loud, Blaise,” Pansy interjected with smirk.
Draco reached forwards and grabbed the hem of Harry's boxers, pulling them down and leaning forwards to capture his prize in his mouth.
“Told ya I knew where it went!”
"Healer Davies, I'm not sure I can condone your actions..."
Florence ignored Harry’s under the breath comment and turned to Draco with a gentle smile. “The best advice I can give you is to stick to your instincts. I know what both of you are capable of, and you’ll do just fine if you remember your training and work together!”
"Oh, so this is
Draco suddenly felt a sharp jolt and gasped in pain—his wand falling from his hand. A deep stabbing pain had quickly begun to fill his chest, rendering him unable to remain upright. He fell to the ground, clutching his chest in agony as the unbearable pain seared into his skin like it was being carved by a knife.
“I was honestly hoping that that whole meeting was just a bad dream...” The redhead muttered sourly, throwing the smirking blonde a loathing look.
“Ahh...I see...”
“Ah, will you excuse me for a moment Blaise? I’m gonna go use the loo.”
not to mention that it’s in the middle of muggle residentials, and from what I hear from you, you’re always complaining about your roommate...”
“Weasley...and Granger, right? Blaise Zabini, at your service.” He offered his hand to Hermione, who took it with obvious tentativeness.
"Wha-?
is unexpected...,” The snatcher crooned as he deftly deflected the jinx aimed at him. Draco kept his wand raised, shifting closer until he was standing in front of Harry’s unconscious body—shielding him from the snatcher.
“I can go first then, if you like,” Theo offered with a polite raise of his hand, earning a snicker from Blaise.
“Anything you should know?” Florence paused and cast his gaze up thoughtfully. “I can’t say that there’s anything specific, all the information concerning your mission was written up on that parchment that I read you...”
"There is not such thing as
"You're not making any sense! Just tell us what's going on!" Florence suddenly growled, bringing to attention his presence from everyone in the room. His normally cheery face was nowhere to be seen.
know? For all you know—”
“What exactly does that mean?” Pansy questioned with a frown.
you decided to pair us together as partners?”
you’re a full grown man and they know you can take it that they’re hitting on you...”
Kingsley frowned. "Superficially?"
“Of course you need my help Dray Dray. Love Doctor Zabini is in the house.”
"Mmmm,
"So, after testing Mr. Malfoy and realizing that he too had been exposed to the same dark magic that Mr. Potter had been, we realized that we had to work quickly to find a cure for both of them," said Davies. "Luckily for us here at St. Mungo's, we have several healers who are specialized in the research and healing of dark magic. After some trial and error, we ended up dispelling enough dark magic that we were able to start healing the large laceration on Mr. Potter's chest, in addition to expelling the dark magic that seemed to be sapping away Mr. Malfoy's vitals as well." Davies glanced around to make sure that everyone was still following along.
Kingsley waved a hand around. “Your job, working with Knightly, learning all the tricks of the trade...How are you liking it so far?”
“Couldn’t have said it better.” Draco laughed and brought their glasses together with a
Draco Malfoy.”
snogging.....”
“But since I’m not working with Mr. Knightly anymore...does that mean that I’m going to be assigned another Auror to work alongside?”
Harry glanced at Draco, but he was still in the middle of a bicker fest with Blaise. Since he was the one that had ordered the drinks, Harry didn’t actually know whose drinks were whose.
"It's not a good idea to apply it too much when they're unconscious either," Davies retorted.
“Do you both swear to protect any and all forms of life—whether wizard, muggle, magical being, or other—so long as you are both Aurors?”
, putting them
Silence stretched over the table, and Harry struggled to find a topic that he could talk about.
“Ah, yes....I suppose we did,” Draco replied rather awkwardly, trying his best to restrain himself from grinding his throbbing hips downward. This was made even more difficult by Harry—who was quite aroused himself—moving his hands around to grip the blonde’s ass firmly and ever so slightly raising his hips up jut against the warm firmness of the Slytherin’s butt.
The sudden rustling sound startled the two wizards, and they glanced to the bed in surprise as they saw Draco blink his eyes open slowly—turning his head against his pillow and scanning his eyes around to get a view of the room.
“As I was saying—” Draco continued, glancing between his friends on his right and his lover’s friend’s on his left. “I suppose we should make proper introductions. The whole reason why we decided to hold this luncheon with all of you lot was so we could all get to know each other better. We’re going to be seeing each other much more frequently in the future, so we decided it would be best to try and get things out and in the open sooner rather than later...”
Blaise couldn’t help the incredulous chuckle that escaped as he stared down the pair. “Yes, do enlighten us. What the bloody hell does that even mean?!”
Harry glanced at his wristwatch. “Um...I’m not sure...Ginny never actually replied to my owl, so I’m not sure if she’s actually coming.....Dray?” He touched his lover’s arm lightly to get him to snap out of his staring contest with the wall.
“H-hold on Draco...”
“Hmm, sounds fascinating...” The blonde drawled curiously, taking a sip of coffee from his cup before turning to his partner. “I ordered you some coffee when you left, it should be here in a moment...I don’t know if your friends want to order anything while we wait for the rest of our party to show...”
"See? Not so bad!" Davies responded enthusiastically.
“Bloody hell, to think the day would come...” Harry mumbled under his breath with a disbelieving shake of his head.
“Yes ma’am!”
Ron watched the pair banter with an increasingly sickening expression painting his face. “Bloody hell...you two must be together—or else you must just really like having lover’s spats...”
Draco spluttered indignantly at his lover's particular choice of wording.
The blonde perked up and swooped down to drop a chaste kiss on his lover’s lips. “Don’t worry love—15 minutes and he’s gone!”
"Ready?" Davies asked courteously, raising the dropper from the bottle.
“That bastard is none of my concern,” Draco replied evenly, forcing himself to keep from getting goaded on by the man.
Ron scowled and took the momentary lapse in silence to butt in. “So you don’t have any problem whatsoever that your supposed best mate is dating our best mate?”
Blaise shrugged with an easy grin. “Why would I? He’s obviously happy—the happiest I’ve honestly ever seen him. I would give my blessing to him no matter who he chose to be with—so long as I’m sure that he’ll remain happy.”
“Either we move the couch, or there will be no shagging anywhere in this flat except for the bed.” Harry finally offered—shooting his blonde lover a look that would have made Voldemort shake in his boots.
"Well we've come a ways in our technology so now, while still difficult, it's not a death sentence if you're cursed with dark magic." Davies paused as he finished unwrapping the bandages, then carefully peeled away the dampened gauze to reveal an ugly red slash snaking from the top of Harry's shoulder, down to the middle of his stomach. The wound was weeping clear liquid with drops of scarlet blood glistening at the surface—it's was honestly kind of hard to look at.
The nurse cringed slightly. “Um, I’m afraid that there’s been strict orders not to admit anybody to see the two...”
—" Draco fastened a sleek silver watch around his wrist and walked back over to where Harry stood—still surveying his appearance in the mirror.
Hermione frowned and cocked her head in confusion. “I’m sorry, but I still don’t understand. How exactly are these
“Because there are wards around Hogsmeade, Potter.” Draco explained impatiently. “It’s rare to not find a town protected by wards after the war now. At least it keeps people from apparating straight in.”
Harry nodded stiffly at the explanation. “Alright then. We should start by going to Hogsmeade—maybe we can find some clues about where the snatchers have gone from there.”
“Oi, back off,” Ron interjected menacingly, glaring down the Slytherin until he released his gaze with a chuckle.
After donning one of Harry’s faded band tees and a simple pair of ripped jeans (nothing, though, compared to favorite, white, limited edition, 500 galleon, vintage distressed, custom-fitted, designer jeans mind you), Draco finally made his way to the staircase— not 5 minutes having passed since he left Blaise in the living room alone. The sight he came back to upon descending the staircase back to the living room was pretty much spot on with what he expected.
“Well I wasn’t feeling as anxious earlier, but now...” His eyes swept back to the entrance of the cafe for the fourth time that minute as he strummed his fingers on the table restlessly. “I don’t know why I’m feeling this nervous now...”
"Yes, indeed." Davies cast a glance over to Draco's bed and startled slightly in surprise. "Ah! Young Mr. Malfoy! Awake at last I see! That's good news—although I'm a bit surprised."
"I told you they would accept us." Harry replied with a soft smile, turning to link his arms behind the blonde's neck.
“Ah, apologies...I guess I missed the greetings..” He drawled smoothly, turning an interested gaze to the new pair of Gryffindors sitting at the table.
“Ok, it’s not the
"You want to continue with what we were doing earlier." Draco replied with low growl, guiding them over to the couch and pushing Harry down.
"How so, Healer Davies?" Kingsley asked with a frown.
"You should wear something high quality..." The blonde continued, scanning the shelves in the closet until he found what he was looking for and levitated it down with his wand.
what you’re talking about...”
“As it is stated by the law,” Kingsley continued. “Any person—wizard or witch, who wishes to be inducted into the Department of Aurors, must first undergo a series of training to be conducted by a senior mentor in the Department. Once that mentor has deemed the trainee to be competent in both mind and body while out on the job—he may recommend that trainee to be considered for complete initiation into the Department of Aurors, with a rank of full-fledged Auror.”
Before Draco could even move, the spell hit Harry square in the chest—the raven haired boy’s unconscious form jolting at the impact of the spell. Draco wasn’t sure what the spell had done until he saw a bright stain of crimson beginning to seep through Harry’s clothing.
—Polaroid! I wanna get that stupid look on Weaslbe's face burned into a picture!" The blonde replied in sheer delight—hopping nimbly off of the couch and trailing after his dark haired lover.
finding this funny...." Harry grumbled back petulantly, ignoring the mischievous gleam in the blonde's grey eyes and staring hopelessly at the unconscious forms of his friends on the floor of their living room.
Well, they were going to find out soon.
“Wha—What kind of stupid shit have you guys been betting on?!” He demanded immediately—but his three friends seemed to pay him no heed as they continued.
“Yeah, yeah....I should.....,” The blonde commented idly, suddenly catching sight of his cellphone vibrating on the kitchen counter. “Hang on just a sec....”
That made Blaise’s jaw drop to the floor. He stood open-mouthed and gaped at the remorseless face of his best friend. “You......you.......YOU’VE BEEN DATING SOMEBODY AND YOU HAVEN’T TOLD ME?!?!?”
Florence had gone absolutely pale with fear when he saw the large gash decorating Harry’s chest. Though he and several of the other Aurors had tried to mend it, the wound appeared to be imbued with dark magic, and refused to close. All Florence could do was try to administer superficial first aid that would help ease Harry’s pain and try to minimize the bleeding. Draco, on the other hand, seemed relatively unharmed at first glance—there were no large wounds on his body aside from a few scratches here and there, and he wasn’t bleeding like Harry was. The only problem lay that he remained unconscious. Florence had tried rousing Draco, but nothing seemed to snap him out of his slumber. That was when the Auror then suspected that the boy must have been hit with dark magic as well—something that was keeping him from coming to.
“And...” The dark skinned Slytherin drew out a long pause with an evil grin. “Theo laughed and said that he didn’t believe me, and Pansy said that she’d have to see it to believe it...”
Hermione winced slightly and slowly nodded her head.
. Harry scowled slightly and averted his eyes to keep from meeting the blonde’s gaze.
“Then why are you capturing that Hippogriff?!” Harry shot back angrily.
Draco screwed his face up in disgust. “Do you three have nothing better to do than to make bets on my love life?!”
"You were right in your hypothesis," Davies breathed with a nod.
“Oh...”
“Harry, you don’t have a scar from that wound now, do you?” Hermione piped up, her brows drawn down towards her eyes in deep concern.
"Alright......I'll...get to it then......" Harry hazarded, dragging his feet out of the kitchen and sinking glumly into the arm chair adjacent to the couch.
"Yes, Potter is no longer in surgery," Davies confirmed. "We're still observing him though, as to why he isn't here with Mr. Malfoy."
"And? How is he?" Kingsley pressed urgently.
“Alright, then I’ll go first,” Harry stated firmly, keen to get his own say on a rule before Draco decided on something ridiculous. “How about; ‘
“Ah!—Oh....” The nurse’s expression went from star-struck to crestfallen in half a second. “Those poor boys....I believe they were sent directly to the critical ward....” She paused with troubled frown. “Hang on, I’ll check.”
Ron and Hermione turned as they caught sight of their best friend.
As soon as he was sure they were alone, Draco released an agitated sigh and began pacing around, muttering angrily under his breath. “Bloody terrific...Hardly gave us any information, dumped us in the middle of a creepy forest, tells us to find evidence of a group of snatchers... “observe” the surroundings...”
, and it looks like something she'd wear." The blonde retorted with a shudder, sneaking his wand out of his back pocket and quickly flicking it at the jumper.
going to go through with this
Pansy grinned and elbowed Theo teasingly. “I told you they got hitched!”
“Whenever two Aurors are decided as partners, the first thing that they need to do is to form a contract with each other,” Kingsley explained slowly, conjuring a piece of parchment and quill from thin air. “This contract are the basic ‘ground rules’ for the two Aurors—meaning that neither are allowed to break them, lest they violate their partnership with the other.”
“Ah, well...it seems like he’s going to be here soon so......I guess you’ll have a chance to meet him...”
“What in Merlin’s name are you doing?” Harry finally asked irritably, sighing in relief when at last the blonde came to a stop.
If Harry wasn’t so nervous about this entire luncheon, he would’ve burst out laughing at Ron’s evasive ‘beat-around-the-bush’ type of speech.
Harry and Draco glanced over at Florence, who gestured for them to follow him up to the podium where Kingsley stood.
"So...What now?" Draco asked curiously, surveying the pair on the couch with a cock of his head. "You have a grand plan for breaking it to them when they come to?"
“Anyways, I found out that Dray Dray was dating someone about 6 or 7 months ago, but I didn’t come to find that it was the boy wonder until quite recently, though I did have my suspicions...” He trailed off with a mischievous smirk, and all three Gryffindors shuddered at the lethal sheen in his eyes.
Harry sniffed indignantly and purposefully turned away from his lover, causing Draco to throw a hand in the air in annoyance. “Alright,
“Yes, he does.”
“Good. Do you swear to follow the rules and views of both the Department of Aurors, as well as the Ministry of Magic itself—so long as you are Aurors?”
Hermione cleared her throat slightly. “Ah, I suppose I shall go next then...I’m Hermione Granger—now Weasley. Ronald and I got engaged shortly after the war, and we celebrated our wedding just a little over 2 years ago...I now work at the Ministry of Magic in the department of Intermagical Wizarding Law, as does Ronald...and I guess I’ve known Harry since we met at the very beginning of our first-year at Hogwarts...”
“Alright, Alright...take it easy...”
....."
"1...2...!" Blackwell and Davies both opened the jars and held them underneath the noses of their respective patients. After a moment, they both retreated and Blackwell passed his jar back to Davies.
a pair of jeans, Malfoy.”
Applause broke out in the room and Florence grinned broadly from the front of the crowd, giving an enthusiastic thumbs up to the pair.
"Especially when he's getting ready to meet with his other Gryffindor friends~!"
“Our reservation is already set.”
Harry dipped his head down. "...I'm really sorry."
Harry furrowed his brow suspiciously. “How? Not even the Ministry knows that we’re living together....Well, except for Kingsley—but that’s because he’s the one that assigned us as Auror partners...”
“.....It was
“Wha—you can’t...you can’t be serious!” Draco protested meekly, staring at the script in horror.
"It's alright, I expected as much. If you would've asked me 5 years ago to try Muggle food I would've looked at you like you were crazy......but I'm different now." The blonde replied seriously, matching both Hermione and Ron's looks with a confident one of his own.
“So, I suppose proper introductions are in order then...” Draco raised his voice to get his fellow Slytherins to be quiet—just as Hermione and Ron returned to the table, the latter thankfully not looking on the verge of sickness anymore.
“Ah...no, I wasn’t trying to make it seem...” The Gryffindor flushed and shook his head nervously.
," Harry relented with a small huff—crossing his arms over his chest and finally giving the blonde a softer look. "But this whole thing will go a whole lot smoother if you just try to get along and not be such an arse."
The three snatchers levitating the Hippogriff immediately froze and looked apprehensively at the newcomer.
Draco hesitated for a moment—still looking like he wanted to put up a fight—but eventually relented with a nod and leaned forwards to place a chaste, apologetic kiss on the dark haired wizard’s lips.
Draco raised his hands slightly and shrugged. “Nothing, just surprised that you guys got married so young is all...”
An interested
"Urg...too many clothes...." Draco grumbled in complaint—reaching over to the coffee table and grabbing his wand. With a mumbled spell and a swish of his wrist, the two of them were rid from their clothing, besides their boxers, and Draco happily resumed work- tossing his wand carelessly behind him.
Harry sighed and raked a hand through his dark, unruly hair and paced around the living room of their apartment. When questioned by his friends and pseudo family about having a lover, he outright lied to them......many.....many...
Florence acquiesced with a nod, and Kingsley strode towards the front desk.
Kingsley nodded and continued. “With the verbal affirmation from the two candidates, I would now like to invite both Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy—as well as their mentor, Auror Florence Knightly, to come to the podium and sign the contracted Oath of the Aurors.”
Nobody moved. Nobody spoke.
“Now,” Kingsley raised his wand and slowly began drawing a figure-eight over top of their connected arms. “Do you, Harry James Potter, swear to uphold to all of the terms written on your Auror contract—to do your best to keep yourself and your partner safe, and always do what is truly the right thing in any situation you may encounter while performing your duties as Auror?”
Harry and Draco glanced at each other briefly before each placing a finger on the glowing object. Immediately their fingers were stuck to the object, and the room began to spin as the Portkey transported them.
Blaise chuckled and waved his hand dismissively. “I think you two are both overreacting. These are your best mates that you’re talking about—I don’t think things could possibly turn out as horribly as you’re imagining that they could.”
“But I filled him in, of course,” Draco replied smoothly, raising a fine brow. “There were others as well, they recalled what had happened after they found us.”
The waiter scowled slightly at the blonde before flashing Harry another smile. “No matter—I’d still love have a drink with you sometime~”
Harry flushed at the praise and quickly shook his head. “Oh, no—please. I’m nobody that deserves that kind of praise...”
“Alright now—stay safe and do me proud, boys!” Florence called off with a wave as he retreated back in the office a few feet. On the desk in front of them, a rock shaped paperweight had begun to glow.
“Just bloody brilliant,” Ron muttered under his breath, earning a chastising look from Hermione.
’ the man had disapparated. Three subsequent cracks were heard and the rest of the snatchers disapparated as well, Hippogriff with them.
” Hermione asked with a slightly puzzled look on her face before a flash of dawning crossed her face. “
“Oh can it, Potter,” Draco bit back irritably, ceasing his muttering long enough to throw the green-eyed boy a piercing glare. “I act how I have to in front of the people that judge my standing in the Wizarding World—are you really any different?”
Draco frowned and glanced up at the sky, and then to the tops of the trees.
..." Harry scratched behind his ear uncomfortably. "I forgot to lower the wards before you guys came.....you were a bit earlier than I had expected...."
“Fine, it’s not your fault....but just hurry up and get rid of him. I don’t want to waste our entire weekend together because Zabini keeps coming over here.”
“Sounds like another thing that needs to be solved by hearing both sides of the story,” Theo chimed in cooly.
Harry chuckled and raised his glass. “To friends, family, and finally being out.”
, Blaise,” The blonde sighed with a roll of his eyes. He caught sight of it at the end of the couch that he and Harry were currently occupying, and slowly reached for it while trying to inconspicuously push his lover off the couch. “Ah, you look over there by the Telly—I’ll check if it’s here in the couch cushions...”
"I am
“Well don’t keep us in suspense, Potter!” Pansy crooned giddily, tapping her feet in excitement. “C’mon and tell us what happened next!”
"This," Davies raised the clipboard and shook it a bit. "is some of Mr. Potter's data that we've taken while he was in surgery."
Florence merely watched, knowing how hard Kingsley must be taking the fall of his two newest Aurors. He still blamed himself for the mission gone awry, and staring at Draco’s unconscious form now filled his stomach and chest with even more a sense of guilt and fear. He didn’t know what he was going to do if Draco and Harry weren’t alright. In his 20 some odd years of being an Auror, he himself had only been hospitalized twice—and his longtime partner Eddison once. The first time was actually due to a flub that his partner had made while they had been training together—a spell performed incorrectly which resulted in both of them being flung into walls. Concussed, they later found out when they awoke in St. Mungo’s some hours later. Thankfully there was little recovery time that resulted from that incident—though Florence swore his chronic headaches were a result of that experience. The second time he was sent to St. Mungo’s was after a rogue dark spell had hit him while he and his partner were rounding up a gang of snatchers. The recovery time for that particular incident had been a much longer and more painful process—as he suspected would be the case for Draco and Harry.
Harry heard a dry chuckle come behind Davies. As he and several nurses stepped to the side, Harry was finally able to see over to where Draco lay in his own hospital bed—lounging against the starched pillows with the air of prince resting in his bedroom—not of a patient in a stuffy hospital.
The blonde however, wasn’t listening to the groans of his lover beneath him—too busy instead
Silence once again swept the room.
“Oh no you don’t...” The Slytherin muttered, quickly seizing a hold on Harry’s arm and dragging him back onto the couch beside him.
“Easy, Florence. Let him breathe,” Kingsley reprimanded gently.
Here’s the latest installment of the YDW! Series. Things are starting to get more interesting as more characters are being introduced~
the person that people entrust their children to...” Draco lamented with a disbelieving shake of his head.
Harry rolled his eyes impatiently. “Because. It’s the same expression that you wear whenever you’re about to insult somebody’s clothing at the Ministry—and it’s also the same expression that you make in bed when you’re about to tease me or do something that I don’t like.”
The sound of bed sheets rustling caught the attention of everyone in the room.
“So you two really did get married?!” Pansy asked in shock, her mouth dropping open in aghast.
Draco narrowed his eyes accusingly. “How do you figure?”
“Harry, good to see you mate,” Ron clapped him on the back with a friendly grin.
Draco smirked and took a long gulp of the strong alcohol, savoring in the searing heat that left in his throat as he swallowed it. “Well I can’t wait to see what it is~”
Draco surmised that the spell that Harry had been cursed with must have been some kind of dark magic that was impeding with the healing charms Draco was trying to use.
; either get rid of him, or I’m gonna have to,” Harry finally snapped—redirecting his glare up at the pair of grey puppy dog eyes pleading innocence down at him.
Davies pinched the dropper and the first few drops of the dittany splashed down onto the open wound. Though he had braced himself for it, nothing could have prepared Harry for the excruciating pain that the healing potion caused.
“They are not to be hunted, taken as pets, or illegally sold,” The snatcher replied calmly, nodding his head in acknowledgement.
He stood in front of the mirror and surveyed himself.
“Potter, get your arse over here!”
Kingsley and Knightly immediately jumped up when Harry began to scream. Knightly had already dashed over to Harry's side, but then a second voice joined the screams and caused everyone, even Davies, to freeze.
“Boss! We gotta go, this thing is gonna wake up soon!”
....t-t-that's
“Bloody hell, I think I’m gonna be sick...” Ron muttered queasily, watching Harry with no small amount of mortification on his face.
Draco pursed his lips and heaved an annoyed sigh—swiping the remote control for the television off of the coffee table and turning the Telly off. “Blaise mate, I’m serious. I need you to clear out.”
Draco resisted a groan at the sensation and threw a quick glare down at the tousled Gryffindor—warning him with a silent look to refrain from any further administrations. Harry threw his own scowl back and mouthed something akin to
prat~” The Slytherin reminded haughtily. Harry gave a brief laugh and an assuring nod before said prat dipped his head down to join their lips.
"Well if you're done with your ladies aid, then it's time to eat." Draco commented with a smirk, swishing his wand and levitating different plates filled with food onto the table.
Harry nodded in agreement and glanced around the table. “So, Uh...how exactly should we go about doing this...?”
“But sir...!” Harry protested indignantly. “Past feelings aside—how can you just pair him up as my partner?! Does Malfoy even know anything about being an Auror?!”
"There." Blackwell suddenly placed a finger on the page. "What does that say?
“Have fun you two lovebirds~!” Blaise stepped into the fireplace with a handful of floo powder.
“Yes I do Minister,” Florence responded once again, nodding his head firmly.
Florence fixed Draco with a bemused expression, while Kingsley began to pace again.
Draco, who has been watching the preparation for Harry's treatment with no small amount of smugness, had suddenly felt an indescribable pain in his chest, only seconds after Harry had started screaming. Kingsley immediately dropped to his knees and tried to calm Draco down as the boy screamed and writhed in pain on the bed. Kingsley glanced down at Draco to try and find the source of the pain when he saw something that made him freeze. Blood had started to dot through the thin fabric of Draco's hospital gown, staining the entire area of his chest a deep crimson red.
look.
Harry shook his head and tried his best to keep with the capricious older man as Florence quickly strode through the bustling main floor of the Ministry, quickly navigating into the pristine gold elevators in the back.
happened.”
“Your proof?”
Kingsley turned to Florence. “Senior Auror Knightly was tasked with the mentoring of both Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy. So to Auror Knightly I ask; do you recommend these individuals brought before me be initiated into the Department of Aurors?”
"Yeah...I thought so.......Bloody Gryffindor loyalty...." Draco muttered with a wry laugh, turning to glance out the window again.
“You sure? It’ll be much easier if we just get everything up and on the table—”
"Seriously, what kind of sick experiments were you trying to get away with?!"
“That’s...”
“The partner contract...,” Harry mumbled, suddenly feeling queasy and nervous again.
After a moment, Knightly frowned. "Is something...supposed to happen?"
did I do to deserve that attitude?" Draco asked indignantly, crossing his arms with a pout.
Florence’s heart jumped in empathy and he rested a hand on Draco’s back. “It’s alright now, Draco. We have a team of the best healers here—I’m sure they’ll fine a way to fix ole Harry up good as new.”
He kissed a trail across Harry's jawline and down his neck, savoring in the feel and taste of the other man's skin. Draco couldn't resist the temptation and began sucking and nipping at a strip of the lovely white neck—lavishing his lover's neck and creating a dark red love mark there.
...” Draco mewled lustily, tipping his head back and raking a hand through his hair restlessly.
As for Harry himself, things were going well. After his 20th birthday, he had soon found himself being trained, under Kingsley’s suggestion, to become an Auror. Kingsley had assigned a mentor to him, and ever since, Harry had been training hard underneath the supervision of Auror Florence Knightly—an older and slightly eccentric wizard, though Harry thought him quite charming (and found a great deal of likeness to Mr. Weasley in him). With Voldemort gone, Harry felt like he was finally able to live life like an normal person might—and he strived everyday to do just that.
list....” Harry soothed with a chuckle.
“It depends on the people, really.,” Kingsley responded easily, chuckling slightly. “I’ll admit, there have been some rather atrocious ones in the past—such as;
“Mmm. I understand how you feel Florence....”
He had immediately rounded up a team of Aurors to go find the two—and upon arrival, found Harry and Draco unconscious on the ground. As expected, none of the snatchers seemed to have stuck around—and so the Aurors wasted no time racing the two boys to St. Mungo’s.
"Can we please talk about this? Over dinner?" He asked quietly, pleading with his eyes for the two of his friends to give him a chance.
How was
Draco scowled at the slip of his tongue. “Damn.”
“Then what was with the money from Pansy from just now?” Draco asked suspiciously.
“Yes Minister,” Draco followed suit, nodding affirmatively.
"Ah there it is." Harry mumbled, finally spying his wand on the floor across the room and picking it up.
“You sure are...
“Well we wouldn’t have to be searching for it in the first place if you wouldn’t have let it escape, you tosser!”
Hey guys, hope you liked the first chapter! Here’s the second where a certain devilish Italian makes his appearance! Mwahaha~ If you like what you you read (or even if you don’t) feel free to leave a review~! :D
"Look over here." Davies strode somberly to Draco's bedside and stared at the wound there.
"It's custom made because I appreciate the finer things in life—like getting my clothes designed and fitted exactly as I like them. I picked one up for you and had it made sometime last week when I went to pick up an order." Draco responded as he threw on a black turtleneck and slipped a charcoal grey jumper of his own on top—hiking the sleeves up as he rummaged through his other shelves to find a suitable watch.
Ron and Hermione, on the other hand both openly gaped at the new figure—but before they could get a word in, the Slytherin continued.
“Oh come now—you didn’t expect me to recognize the savior of the Wizarding World? You may have grown, but I’m afraid you’re still a child....”
“Did you just—?!”
"It was at this point," Davies continued, ignoring Florence, "that we realized that if Mr. Potter had been cursed with dark magic, then there was a good chance that Mr. Malfoy has been as well."
“But what about the Auror he worked under?! Surely nobody would just offer to take him!”
Blackwell nodded.
Draco closed his eyes with a slight groan. “We may as well just tell them the whole story...”
“Ah yes, now I have it...” He paused for dramatic affect to make sure he had captured everyone’s attention before continuing the story.
“I know where we are,” Draco returned cooly, glancing around for show and shrugging easily. “Laimen Forest. Not far from Hogsmeade, if I remember correctly.”
“A Hippogriff...” The blonde whispered back tightly, not daring to speak too loudly.
Knightly looked like he was about to faint from shock. "Healer Davies," he whispered. "What is going on? Are my two boys gonna be alright, or not?!"
“Hehe, this is where you’re supposed to give a resounding ‘
“Once a snake, always a snake,” Ron bit out, this time earning a glare from everyone at the table.
“Ah.” Blaise glanced down at Hermione’s hand again, ignoring the furious redhead. “I suppose you’re not Granger anymore though.” He examined the glittering diamond ring decorating the brunette’s dainty ring finger, and released her hand with a smirk.
“He’s....not,” The blonde replied somewhat defensively, though he wasn’t quite sure himself if he was lying or not.
Kingsley watched as Davies carefully removed the fabric—letting out a gasp as the skin underneath was revealed.
Theo scowled slightly, reaching into the pocket of his pants and fishing around before retrieving and pulling into view several golden disks—Galleons, Harry recognized after they came fully into view—and dropped them into the her hand. “I thought you had forgotten about that...”
....." Harry mumbled heatedly—his hands beginning to roam around his lover's lean muscled body.
"Well, I want to test a hypothesis. If Davies treated Mr. Potter's chest wound and that wound showed up on Mr. Malfoy's chest, then maybe any wound—or treatment of wound—that one of them receives, the other receives as well," Blackwell explained thoughtfully.
“You two work at the Ministry as well?” This time it was Draco’s voice that cut in, and he glanced at the pair with an expression akin to honest curiosity.
Kingsley nodded slowly and levitated the parchment, turning it so that they could all read.
basis, hehe~” The waiter continued, offering him a charming smile.
"That prat..."
The three lapsed into silence—Kingsley continuing to pace around the small ward, his face set into hard lines. Florence watched Draco carefully, but the blonde kept his gaze fixated firmly on the sheets covering his lap—his mind drifting off into thought.
Draco redirected the gaze to Blaise with a questioning glance.
sort of look.
"Harry!" Knightly breathed a sigh of relief. "How are you feeling?"
Harry blinked in surprise. She didn’t seem to be acting condescendingly, he noted as she turned back and threw Draco an impressed smirk.
been some close calls on a few of the cases that he had been on—but neither he nor Florence had ever sustained injury needing of hospitalization while out on the job. “I suppose I should consider myself extremely fortunate then...”
“Quite smashingly, if I do say so myself! Potter was excellent, as always Minister!” Florence beamed brightly, clapping Harry on the back proudly.
Harry stared at the blonde with a frown. He realized that it was the first time he had actually been alone with Draco since their impromptu reunion the other day in Kingsley’s office.
Draco stood up for the couch and gestured to Harry behind him, scratching the back of his neck in anxiousness.
"I have the reports, sir!" The young nurse who Davies had instructed to leave had just returned through the doors of the ward—a small stack of parchment papers in her hand.
Harry blinked up at the Slytherin wordlessly, taking several long seconds to comprehend what he was saying.
“Zabini.” He returned, accepting the tanned Slytherins hand with a firm shake.
“Remind me again; why do we need to move the couch?” Draco asked in amusement—his lean body draped over a chair as he watched his lover survey their small living room with a critical eye.
His male partner was none other than the pompous blonde pureblood; Draco Malfoy.
“Sit, Sit. There’s no need to be so nervous, Potter,” Kingsley’s deep, calming voice called out to the boy, and he sunk gingerly into the seat—still not daring to speak a word.
“...Mmm?” Draco blinked and shook his head before snapping attention—glancing over at Kingsley with a slightly glazed-over expression. “...Sorry?”
“Though it may be hard to accept, there’s nothing we can do but hope for the best.” Kingsley advised wisely, clapping a hand on the distraught Florence’s shoulder.
“Dark magic?” Kingsley questioned with a grave face.
“The contract is bound by an Unbreakable Vow,” Kingsley interjected sternly. “Once the terms of the contract are set by both Aurors, they will take an Unbreakable Vow with the other to swear to protect the other.”
“Ah, not to worry Malfoy—I called you up here on purpose. I figured that the three of us should have a little meeting before we proceed with the initiation ceremony tomorrow,” Kingsley stated with a slight grimace, gesturing for the two to follow him over to a small sitting area further in the office.
“Aye, and I reckon we outta muzzle it this time—I don’t fancy gettin’ ma fingers chomped again.”
Draco grit his teeth in annoyance at letting them get away, but he knew full well that he wasn’t in any position to take on the full group of snatchers—especially with Harry unconscious on the ground. The fact that Harry hadn’t roused from his knock-out made Draco slightly more apprehensive of the power of the snatcher in front of him.
Kingsley smiled slightly. “At ease, Florence—I’m here for the same reason you are.” He held his robes and sunk gracefully onto the bench next to Florence—the faint smile immediately disappearing. “I received an informal report from Eddlson about what happened—but as you were the one who received the Patronus message from young Malfoy, I’d like to hear it from you.”
The snatcher paced in front of Harry slowly, speaking with an air of haughtiness.
Draco didn’t let his lover’s lack of enthusiasm derail him—slowly trailing his pale fingers down the Gryffindor’s chest and slipping them underneath the fabric of the faded T-shirt to grope at his firm chest. After a moment, Harry groaned in defeat and batted his lover’s hand away so that he could sit up—effectively stretching his arms over his head and slipping off his shirt in the process.
“Oh! I think they said that they were going to be coming together after work—I guess they picked up an extra shift today...so probably 10...15 minutes..?” The Italian replied after glancing down at his own wristwatch.
“Quick, you two! Grab it!” The wizard said as he aimed his wand at the Hippogriff again. “
“Sorry,” Harry muttered half-heartedly. “I saw that look in your eye though. You were either about to say something mean or dirty.”
“Well, you haven’t in so many words,” Blaise returned with a mild shrug. “It just seems that way from what I hear about him and how you guys live together.”
“Effective immediately, I’m assigning Draco Malfoy as your new partner, Potter,” Kingsley stated firmly, and suddenly Harry’s vision went blurry.
sort of face.
being an arse?!"
Blaise rolled his eyes and shook his head dramatically. “Of course not. The only people who still care about those kind of things anymore are the old-timers; basically meaning our parents and anyone older.” He chuckled mischievously and continued. “I’ve even had the Muggle boyfriend or two over the last few years...”
Harry reached for the closest object he could find—a harmless pair of socks—and hurled it at the smug blonde. He however, nimbly slunk out of the closet before real damage could ensue, and left the boy wonder to steam in the closet by himself.
“What?” Draco glanced over his shoulder. “Oh, he went to loo...”
"Harry!! You were here with Malfoy earlier weren't you??!!" He suddenly exploded—waving an accusingly finger wildly towards his friend.
“But how do we know if what he’s telling us is the truth, mate?” Ron spoke up with a frown. “If you said yourself that you were out of it, then how do you even know what happened while you knocked out?”
"Ah, no! Well, actually..." Davies eyes drifted over to Draco's bed.
Harry barely suppressed a groan. “Sir, I don’t understand—how in the world is Malfoy qualified to be my partner? Or an Auror for that matter?! He’s obviously never been trained in, he’s never even worked here for the Ministry, and, further more, how am I supposed to work with someone that’s hated me ever since we met?!”
Harry didn’t have time to ask what that meant before the older man began scratching away furiously at the parchment, only stopping after he had filled a good two-thirds of the page with writing. “Alright, here’s the basis for your contract...”
Ron frowned but seemed to accept the answer, slumping back into his seat.
He did recognize her from Hogwarts though, he realized after seeing her face up close. Her hair had usually been pulled up into a ponytail, and she was always talking nonstop—she had a bit of a screechy voice, Harry remembered with a grimace.
"But Draco, don't forget....."
The man laughed and clapped him on the back tiredly. “I have to say, you’re gettin’ pretty good there boy! I reckon you’re about ready to take on your own apprentice soon!”
“Your hand,” Kingsley replied, and Draco finally realized that Harry had his own hand outstretched—waiting for Draco to grasp on.
“Can we just.....turn it around?”
to hear the details on how
Kingsley nodded in satisfaction and turned to Draco, still moving his wand over the pair of connected arms. “And you, Draco Lucius Malfoy—do you swear to uphold to all of the terms written on your Auror contract—to do your best to keep yourself and your partner safe, and always do what is truly the right thing in any situation you may encounter while performing your duties as Auror?”
"Alright, I'll give you that one..." Harry replied with a slight laugh, reaching his hands up to hook around the blonde's neck as he hovered on top of him.
He had found, and was currently very involved with his male partner.
He flicked his wand and casted another non-verbal spell. Luckily, Draco had anticipated the movement and was able to deflect the spell with a quick
Draco threw an incredulous look down at his lover—whom was sitting placidly on the couch- as he continued to pace and rant around their living room.
Yes, things had really started to look up for him. That was, until that fated day.
on the bottle's label. He willed his rapidly-increasing heart rate to slow down as memories of Hermione treating Ron's splinch wounds with a bottle of Dittany filtered into his mind. The sound of Ron's blood-curdling screams were filling his head and he could think of only one thing.
“Well, well, well—what do we have here boys?”
“No...that guy performed all of his spells non-verbally. I-I tried to fix it, but it wouldn’t mend....” Draco glanced down at his hands in his lap. “There....was so much blood—I couldn’t stop it.”
Harry sputtered in disbelief. “B-but how?! When did he come here? Who was he under supervision of? How come I’ve never seen him here? He’s not even registered under the list of Aurors!”
“Draco! Answer me! Why?”
“Aah, yes, I can feel the power rushing through my veins!” he yelled, raising his tensed arms into the air in a victorious post.
“But he’s a hero!” Draco cut in. “He saved my
He was in the middle of the desert, just like the last time he had been conscious when Jafar sent him to his verdict. But this time he had no lamp to magically grant him a way to get out of his cage. This time he didn’t have a flying carpet to help him. This time he didn’t have his best friend’s company. It really
“Whoa!” Harry whisper-shouted. “This is your room? It’s more than twice as big as my home!”

He takes out a rather dusty, old oil lamp and though something about it sparks your interest to flower again, you do not let it show.
! And second, I’m not a property that you can just send off. I’m a person with my own life, my own emotions and I should be allowed to make my own decisions!”
All the books are wrong. They say that people are supposed to look like they’re peacefully sleeping when they lie unconscious on hospital beds.
“Because we need to. About Draco.” I make sure that my tone is matter-of-factly, leaving no room for discussion.
She’s the one that brings me Harry’s clothes. She always brings two sets; one for Harry, one for me. I can’t stand wearing my own clothes anymore. I crave the soft fabrics of Harry’s jumpers, the soft scent of cinnamon that always clings to his shirts.
him.” He put his hand on the lamp and rubbed. Just like when Harry did the same, there was a small explosion which was followed by Genie appearing in front of them.
“Did you give it to them?” he asked and got another angry chatter in reply. “Good boy, Abu.” Harry smiled and pet the monkey on its head. “Now, let’s work together and we’ll get another one. Or a watermelon. How about that?” They headed out on the street again, making their way towards the main market street where it’d be easy to snatch a piece of food without getting caught thanks to the crowds.
“He’s right, you know,” Draco said as he sneaked his arms around Harry’s waist.
obvious,” Ron tries, but both Draco and Potter cut in.
Gryffindors are a menace.
“You know why!” Draco was quickly losing the little patience he had left. “Because you want to marry me off to some stupid princess! How many times do I have to tell you that I won’t have that either? First of all, I’m
“I’m sorry.....please don’t be mad~ It’s not like it was my fault that he came over here unannounced....,” Draco pouted and jutted his lip out childishly, trying to rack up some kind of pity points from his lover.
" Draco shot back with a pout, turning sideways to send the dark haired male a look that said
“Alright, so let me go over this one more time.” Florence Knightly pushed his glasses up his nose slightly as he glanced at the piece of parchment he was holding. “You two, Potter and Malfoy, have been assigned by the Ministry to complete your first assignment as Auror partners together today.”
As if on cue, the light tinkle of a bell was heard—and Harry gulped as he raised his eyes nervously to see who it was.
, Draco.”
"Aha! I shall explain momentarily!" Davies turned back to Kingsley. "Minister, I can only assume that the reason for your appearance here is due to Mr. Potter's injuries, yes?"
"As I said—we finished the surgeries and expelled the dark magic—but just to make sure, we then sent both of the boys through an additional scan to detect for any traces of dark magic that could still be lingering in their bodies. And we found some." Davies began to pace again, slowly—his charming face marred by furrowed brows.
Draco grit his teeth together and tried to focus on what Kingsley was saying when he noticed the older man’s lips moving once again. He was finding it hard to concentrate and kept zoning out accidentally.
Draco turned to look his partner straight in the eye—grey locking on emerald.
“The story of how you two started dating...”
“Ah, you’re back. Took you long enough,” Blaise muttered petulantly before nodding his head enthusiastically in answer to the question. “Yeah, I think it’s a really funny show!”
” sort of gesture.
“Harry James Potter and Draco Lucius Malfoy.”
"Here goes nothing....."
" Draco intoned, busy kissing a trail down his lover's neck.
Draco groaned slightly and dropped his head to the table. Well, that was as good as them not knowing then. Blaise patted his mate lightly on the back and turned to the raven haired male that had been quiet for entirety of the 10 minutes that he had been there.
"Figured I'd start cooking and you can wake them up....it'll probably be better if I'm not there immediately." He explained with a shrug, turning back to the stove and stirring whatever it was that was in the pan—Harry couldn't see.
Davies hovered over Draco's still form, feeling the boy's steady pulse. He then pulled his wand from his robes and gave it a quick flick—effectively cutting open the front of Draco's medical gown.
“The point of the contract, is to help build your trust and relationship together—to keep you both
“Thank Merlin for that....ugh, I need some alcohol.”
“Snatchers.” Draco breathed, still frozen stiff next to Harry. “Look at the chain around its neck.”
Draco quirked a brow. “Oh? I don’t think I’ve heard of that department...”
here...?”
“That is....peculiar....,” Florence offered, for lack of better words.
“I just vanished them...” The Gryffindor stated slowly, looking at Draco in concern.
till you hear what happens
Kingsley chuckled and waved his hand dismissively. “Ah, Potter—there’s no need to be so uptight. If there was something wrong with the way you’ve been performing, of course either Knightly or I would’ve said something.” He grinned as Harry sank meekly back into his seat.
“Owww.” Draco meanwhile complained with a scowl, rubbing his shin discreetly as Hermione continued to ramble on about some theory or another that she had. “You didn’t have to kick me that hard!”
“So...you talked to Pansy and Theo, then? About... Harry and I..?” Draco asked his fellow Slytherin hesitantly—almost forgotten anxiety slowly creeping back into his voice at the topic he wanted least to discuss.
” Draco sputtered, his normally calm and composed face turning pale with astonishment.
Ron apparently caught on and scowled slightly. “Is that—er...is your...him, you know...Is
“Mr. Malfoy came in to see me about 2 months ago, filing the claim I told you about earlier, and asking to be considered for a job as an Auror...After taking a look at his test scores and doing a preliminary check, I felt there was no reason why he couldn’t start to be trained in. Like you, he exhibited a great deal of knowledge and instinct on the job, and quickly progressed through the training—as you did.” Kingsley paused, resting his chin in his clasped hands.
“Yes, Blaise, I do like to look at him. Good eye candy, that one.” Draco’s previous icy appearance is gone again and we are back to our usual easy banter. He really has changed with time. When he was younger such a provoking incident would have left him with a grudge that he would hold for
I see Draco open his mouth, and since he’s my best friend I know he’s going to say something incredibly bad, no matter what it is. So I hurry to cut in before him, not thinking about what I’m about to say. “That I like you!”
Mad-Eye.
A young man who, like this lamp, was more than he seemed — a diamond in the rough.
He doesn’t know. He needs to know. I open my mouth to break the news, but no words come out. Instead I feel tears start trailing down my cheeks, an overwhelming sadness filling me up and it gets hard to breath. I sob and cough.
a coward. He is one of the bravest people I know. And I know you, so that’s saying something. He is also very strong. I mean, he braved literal hell, and still kept his kind soul. Yes, it’s tainted from that
Draco stormed through the palace doors, loudly demanding to see his father. When the tall man strode into the hallway, Draco immediately started to rant about what had happened. He told his father about the amazing day he had spent in the city streets, how good it had been until he had been snatched by that awful man. Then he told him about the brave man named Harry who had saved him, going out of his way to get Draco out of the man’s grasp. And he told his father about the residence Harry lived in and the cute — but fierce — monkey who was his best friend. Lastly, Draco told him about how the guards had just barged in and demanded his arrest, ignoring the fact that at that moment Harry had still been the hero of the day.
“Then I shall go and tell that to my father. I will also tell him that you will be joining us for dinner this evening.”
“Hey, that’s cheating!” I hear Blaise shout behind me. I just laugh and continue to run out to the school yard. The rumor that Gryffindors are above cheating is just a rumor after all.
Ring bells!
“Alright.”
Not until then did Harry realise he still held the blade in his hand. Without hesitation, he handed the sword to the guard before pleading tumult — yeah, actually
He made the mistake of meeting Ron’s eye again, and he realised he was the one that was lying to himself. And he hated himself even more. He hurt Draco. Badly.
Much later, with stomachs full of food, they left the room at last. Draco followed Harry to his room, while Lucius went off on his own.
He cast one glance at me, then helped me stand up, guiding me to a quieter room. He fixed a cup of coffee, filled with too much sugar, but that was necessary for me to drink it.
That night was the first of many that Harry and Albus stayed over at the Malfoy’s together. On the anniversary of that first night, one year later, Draco asked them to move in. Harry reminded him about the other two children he had at home, but Draco just smiled. They would never be a problem, no matter how much problem they’d ever stir up.
“I hardly think so. I’m Prince Harry Alibabwa, I come from far away. Further away than you have ever been. I highly doubt that you have had the luck to meet such grandeur as me.”
friends too~"
“While normally I’m against day drinking....what say you we break out the Firewhiskey and settle in for some Telly before we have lunch?” Harry offered with a grin, already reaching for the bottle.
A million thoughts raced through Harry’s head as Florence nodded, patting him reassuringly on the back as he exited the office and the doors swung closed behind him with a solid
“Excuse me.”
“Hey Potter, I think we should—”
“Now now, I’ve left you each a spot at the bottom for one request. As long as it pertains to both members, I’ll allow it.” Kingsley finalized, turning to Harry first.
“...I swear.”
“We really have to make the Unbreakable Vow, don’t we...,” Draco murmured aloud, more to himself than anyone else.
Blaise snickered slightly and cast an apologetic glance over to Ron and Hermione. “Ah. So I see my presence wasn’t made known to you before you arrived.”
How’s everybody doing~? Good, I hope!
The dark skinned Slytherin rose from his perch on the chair and began strolling idly around the living room. “He seems very dominant and controlling.”
"Harry! Oh it's so good to see you, what happened?" Hermione asked with confused smile, glancing around to survey her surroundings.
Kingsley strode back over to Draco’s side, interrupting Florence’s reminiscing.
Harry walked forward slowly and reached up, knocking firmly on the door.
“Of course not! I never forget a bet I make with anybody!” Pansy grinned victoriously, opening up her clutch purse and dropping the Galleons in.
Davies nodded in agreement.
"Easy, give the boy some room," Blackwell cautioned.
The appointed witch scrambled to the cupboard and retrieved two vials, running over to Harry as Davies ran to Draco. She quickly un-stoppered the vial and poured it down a still-thrashing Harry's mouth. She then grabbed the second vial and quickly went to Davies' side—passing it over to him.
The blonde’s face screwed into a puzzled face as he tried desperately to think of what he could say to feed his best friend’s curiosity without revealing who he was actually dating.
Freedom.
“We should probably do that now!”
to be vulnerable because he’ll protect me. Just like he did during the snowball fight. By the end of that night, I was the only one who hadn’t been hit by a single snowball. Because he protected me.
“You are. I promise. I’ve seen enough of that today.” A faint smile crossed Harry’s face, and it once again made Draco’s heart ache. “Hey, how about you stay here tonight? Then you’ll be here when he wakes up. And you can talk about… whatever you need to talk about?”
“Oh yes I did. But not alone. Ron helped me. He cast the spells.”
“Prince Draco!” the first guard cried out. “My apologies, your highness. We did not know it was thee who were hidden beneath that hood.”
“Why don’t you go in there yourself? Wouldn’t that be safest to receive the right lamp for you?”
“Don’t you
“I don’t think so.”
like a prince, and then you can figure out the rest on your own.”
“So,” he clears his throat before crouching before me, “uhm, will you please look at me?”
“That’s fine. It’s my dad’s favourite.” Albus, sighed happily when Draco smiled and started to sing the first few syllables.
It’s really unfair how tall he is. For the first time in… well,
(See the end of the chapter for
The spiders were still crawling around him, atop him. The crippling feeling in his skin was still there. And he knew that somewhere the Dark Potioneer he had been hunting was watching him, waiting for the poison to set in properly, to finally kill Harry Potter off.
It was a grand display, for sure. It felt strange to have so many people staring at him without actually knowing who he was. It felt strange to look down on people. Harry wasn’t really sure if he liked it, but he reminded himself that this was for Prince Draco.
!” I squealed. “Do keep your business to yourselves, I don’t want to know.”
////——\\\\
“You…” he began, letting his left hand brush over his beard. “You are a lot smaller than my last master. Or perhaps my memory has gotten worse.”
Arabian drums beat mysteriously in the esoteric night. A nomad approaches the square you’re standing in as string instruments are added to the song playing. Somehow you notice him even though his face is only partially illuminated by red flames. In time with the music, he sings:
a week and a half.
There is still a long time until he’s fine, until he’s healed. But at least I’m not on my own anymore. And I don’t spare another moment before I ask him to marry me.
Thanks again to Tacky for being a lifesaver!!!
Or maybe, he had entered the room nonetheless because he wanted to breathe in the magical chemicals. He wanted the wizard to succeed in his mission. Why else would he have gone here without alerting his partner, without calling for backup? Without telling anyone where he was going?
They were sitting very close to each other and the presence of Draco made Harry’s skin burn. He was itching to touch him, to be close to him, to be with him forever. It was indeed a whole new world. A new world where Harry’s dreams actually became true. For the first time in forever, he truly felt free. There were no limits to stop him from doing whatever he wanted. But for the first time, he didn’t feel the urge to continue to get more. He was content with exactly where he was, flying next to Draco.
“Not without you,” Harry said bitterly, “or Draco, or Lucius. I
less provocative sides to him. He’s actually a really good person. Even before… everything… he started to change. He wanted to change. He had already changed, but it wasn’t enough. And it was too late. Mayhap, you think that he’s just a coward and a jerk, and yes, sometimes he is a bit over the top, that’s just how dramatic he is, but let me tell you. He is
When I finally realised that this wasn’t true, I cried for days on end. It didn’t matter how many food baskets Mother brought, I wouldn’t eat. Couldn’t do anything but let my tears fall and my sobs shake through my chest.
The rest of the evening, Lucius did everything he could to make Harry feel included and to get to know his soon-to-be son-in-law.
“I would
“Hey, what’s wrong, Al?” Draco had been told by both Albus and Scorpius that they would prefer it if  Draco used Albus’ nickname.
stopping us? What if we went away, a million miles away?”
“Free?”
“I’m not. I just look like one. Because… I wanted to see you. But I couldn’t do that as me.”
Smiling, because Ron and Hermione are now at ending beside us, sharing my love for him.
“What?” I ask bluntly.
I introduce: the world of the Hogwarts Eighth Year world from Ron's perspective. And a lot of thoughts.
“Of course, Draco, my starling. I’d do anything for you. Let’s get on to plan the wedding. We’ll have it tomorrow at the time that the sun sets!”
His laughter dies in his throat as his eyes meet another’s gaze. It’s strange, but even for me time seems to slow down and in the frozen moment it’s just me watching the two boys locking each other in place with their eyes. Then it’s over. Potter looks away first, and I hear Draco take a deep breath.
of the holidays, right?”
“No!” Weasley whispers. “No, it can’t be! He can’t be!” With each word, his voice grows louder and louder until at last he shouts: “NO! HARRY CAN’T BE DEAD!”
At last, his words seemed to have an impact for suddenly he was overthrown by a… flying mat! Harry let out a small laugh as he watched the carpet. It acted so incredibly happy to have met Harry, it made his heart melt a bit.
Genie walked over to the lamp laying on the floor and picked it up. He turned to Harry with it and looked at him expectantly.
For Prince Harry!”
Jafar’s smile was cruel and in his eyes glimmered a fiery hatred. Despite the fear that this put in Harry’s heart, he took a small step forward so that Draco stood slightly behind him, protected.
“Because you deserve better. You deserve a life.”
“Great!” Blaise says cheekily. “Hurry up. Potter and Draco went out ten minutes ago. We wouldn’t want them to be alone out there for too long, now would we? And we can’t really expect Dean or Seamus to split them up…”
“You could stay,” Harry murmured, even though he knew that his request would be rejected.
Too occupied watching as the sunset coloured the palace walls golden, Harry didn’t notice the bitter tone in the man’s voice as he hummed in response. But the man looked out the window and tried to open his heart to the perspective of Harry. He looked at the palace, at its pride and maybe, just maybe he could understand part of it. For someone who had nothing but dreams, he could definitely understand that the palace in its glamour was something of great value.
Fred.
Harry! But how could that be? Jafar had said —
That was what Harry found when he apparated into Draco’s little house. Albus sleeping with a smile on his face, and the notes of his favourite lullaby coming out of Draco’s mouth. Suddenly, it wasn’t just Draco’s heart that had melted that evening.
They had arrived at Harry’s door. Both men lingered at the door, not wanting to part ways.
“But father,” Draco said, but Lucius didn’t seem to notice his son’s interruption as he simply continued to speak in his new, odd voice.
After that Granger ignores my protests and promptly heals the wounds she can, before sending me off to St. Mungo’s.
“It’s not
“Cause… I… I… lo… I can’t say it, okay!”
Draco knew what the silence meant, and he stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him.
Smiling, he tilted his head slightly upwards and pressed his lips onto Draco’s. When they broke apart, Lucius was nowhere to be seen. They were alone. Draco initiated another kiss, and when that ended, another one followed and then another one. Until they are interrupted by some jealous chattering. Beside them, were Abu and Carpet, and they both wanted to know what had happened after Harry had run into the palace to save everyone.
They were in an abandoned hotel room during a stakeout session, when he ended up having Draco shouting at him. And then he was kissing him. He didn’t really allow himself to, but he still found himself kissing him back. At some point, he tasted salt, and he hated himself for making Draco cry.
“Oh, don’t I? You’d be surprised to see exactly how much
There was no use in arguing, because if they did, Ron would convince him he was wrong, and he couldn’t let that happen. Because he didn’t
“True. However, if by the next hour you haven’t talked to him, I
The very moment his dead body falls to the floor, I am hauled back by strong arms, flung to the floor and then I receive kick after kick, hex after hex, curse after curse. But I don’t care. I did it. Nothing else matter than that I made Harry Potter’s dream come true. I close my eyes and take every punch, patiently waiting for the end to come. Maybe I’ll meet Harry there. If this could ever make up for my sins, maybe I will.
Harry stared at the man in disbelief. This was madness!
“Carpet, where’s Abu? Did he fall too? We have to save him!” The mat didn’t seem to listen to him, and Harry grew more and more frantic. “Come on! Let’s go find him! Come on, come on, come on!”
“I’d say something… like
Death.
“Weasley?!” I cough out disbelievingly. “Wha’re you doin’ ‘ere?”
They entered the room. To find it in complete disarray. Clothes and jewellery were strewn all over the floor and nothing was laying in its original place. Quickly, Harry ran through the room, searching for the lamp. But just as he feared, it was gone. And he had quite a good guess of who had taken it.
Tonks.
“That’s what he says as well. But I’m not gonna fight you about it. I said we should talk, so Imma talk. And you should at least wait and listen to me, even if you don’t want to talk to me.”
“Bold of you to assume I don’t already do that. Though I suppose it’d rather be the other way around,” Draco’s grin grows even wider, even as his eyes go darker with… ugh,
Not that anyone here will say otherwise. I’m sitting by a window in our dormitory, and I know none of the other boys will care. Not even Malfoy. In fact, they themselves can be found with watery eyes. They too live with the pain after all. The pain.
Then Draco whispered, “don’t you dare do that ever again, promise me,” and even though they had been fighting about Lucius and war and all the shit he had thrown in Draco’s face, they both knew Draco wasn’t referencing to that. It was about the past months, it was about his death(s).
Abu nodded, but his eyes still betrayed his sorrowful feelings so Harry lifted him off the ground and placed him in his lap.
When they got closer, Harry asked Carpet to slow down. They’d need to sneak inside without being seen, or they’d have no chance in saving Draco and his father. Or the rest of Agrabah’s population for that matter. They had to be extremely careful.
? I know it’s a pureblood lullaby, but…”
!” The disgust in Draco’s voice was almost wearable. “I would
Please, please, come closer.”
“You!” Jafar roared. “How many times do I have to kill you?”
It happened in the middle of a blooming spring. I took my last breath and I took your heart with me to the underworld.
Potter’s grin widens and his eyes darken with devilish determination. It’s not hard to see why he’s the one that vanquished the Dark Lord when he looks like that. I feel a shiver run down my spine and pray to my ancestors that Potter won’t notice it.
He was back. Back where it all started, standing in front of a mirror. Back when his pocket was heavy - he wondered if it was heavy because of the stone or because of the secrets it held. The secrets he had. Back when he first heard that cold voice that still haunted him every night. Back when he had to become a soldier.
“Thank you,” he says. “You don’t have to pay for it, I give it to you for free. After all, that’s the least I can do for a diamond in the rough.”
“Free,” the other man responded instantly.
be something. His eyes fell upon a palace guard standing just outside the circle of people surrounding the scene, talking animatedly with a woman. Harry let a smirk spread onto his face before he told Abu to take off to their home and that he’d meet him there.
Harry grabbed the man’s hand and turned to flee the scene. But. His path was blocked. By the palace guard.
“Shut your mouth, or I’ll do it for you!” I hiss heatedly.
At first, Harry looked confused, but then he seemed to understand and he nodded. Draco instantly moved to make enough space on the bed for Harry to get in.
“I know,” Potter interrupts. When I look at him, he's wearing an almost wicked smirk.
Harry felt his jaw drop, but he didn’t care. In front of him stood the prince of Agrabah! Clad in his famous golden turban as well as beautifully decorated thawb. Everyone knew that contrary to most royal families in the Arabic Countries, the Sultan of Agrabah loved to add swirling streaks of gold onto their otherwise plain thawbs, and the evidence of that was now standing right in front of Harry.
This time, Harry drew in a sharp breath. He had
Draco immediately threw his arms around Harry and pulled him into a tight hug before kissing his cheek. He whispered his thanks over and over as Harry held him in return. Harry watched this prince of wonders and was once again reminded of how deeply he loved him. They were both distracted from these activities, though, when Lucius cleared his throat.
disgustingly much with each other, right in front of me.
He reaches over his right hand and lets it follow the shape of my face. His touch isn’t as light as Potter’s on Draco’s skin, but firm and grounding. Evident, certain to be there. I sigh and lean towards him. With unsurprising strength, he suddenly hauls me to my feet. Intent eyes scour my face, a hand slides through my hair, pushing my head backwards so that it’s tilted to make me able to see him.
Draco Malfoy. The prince of Agrabah. Wasn’t it just Harry’s luck that he’d go and fall head first in love with the one boy he never could have? Maybe it was for the best that he was about to die anyways. At least then he wouldn’t have to live through the misery of unrequited love. Barely had the thought crossed his mind before he scorned himself. He couldn’t think like that! He had loads of things to live for. The greatest of them all was his best friend.
“Trying to save you!”
“Zap, you’re zoning out again,” Draco drawls and snaps his fingers in front of my face. I roll my eyes at the nickname which only is used when Draco wants to tease him.
There was a bang and suddenly Harry’s rags for clothes were exchanged for beautiful silk robes and his head was covered by a grand turban. Around him, the genie transformed grain of sand after grain of sand into whatever he thought could help Harry look more princely. Soon they were surrounded by an entire caravan. Harry quickly jumped up on the back of a grand elephant and then they were on their way into Agrabah.
I don’t know what his hope was, who his hope laid upon, who he believed could save the world. But I know that I was too late to let him see it, to make his dream come true. So I owe him. I’ve made up my mind.
,” Potter growls. Sweet Salazar, these two are going to be the death of me, couldn’t they just… keep me out of their bloody relationship?
“No,” Harry said. “You can do that yourself. Because I told you from the beginning, I was going to use my last wish to set you free. And that’s what I’m going to do. Genie, I wish you to be free.”
Then spring became your least favourite season. It became a time you dreaded every time it approached.
wanted this day to be over.
When they finally were able to stand again, they went back out of the room. They had only gotten a few metres when they heard a loud crash coming from the main entrance hall. Hurriedly, they made their way there. In the hallway stood Jafar, proudly holding the lamp in his hands. In front of him stood Lucius, looking absolutely furious.
Lucius immediately called for his guards to arrest Jafar, but merely had the guards got their hands on Jafar’s shoulders before the man threw a vial at the floor. The room was suddenly filled with smoke and when it dispersed, Jafar was nowhere to be seen.
Harry smiled down at the people that came to the street. He found himself holding a bag full of money which Genie had conjured him. Without a second thought, he pushed his hand into the bag and retrieved a handful of coins which he then threw at the crowd. He did, after all, know very well that there were a lot of people in Agrabah that could do with some extra stocks. He saw the man he had cut the hand off, and made sure to throw a couple of coins his way. Hopefully, it would be enough for him to pay for proper medical help so that his injury would heal correctly.
“Do you know how many dark spells and potions and books I had to dig through and use to get you back?!” Draco’s voice was acidic, it was hard to imagine he was actually happy that he had saved Harry.
each other, they are actually really cute, and Potter clearly cares for Draco a lot. In the way he touches Draco’s shoulder ever so lightly to get his attention while doing homework together, or the way he watches the blond with soft eyes when the latter has fallen asleep on the loveseat in front of the fireplace, it shows that all this isn’t just a casual affair to him. It isn’t something he’ll be sure to drop as soon as he can – or as I first had feared, as soon as it’d hurt Draco the most to lose him. It’s real to him. And to Draco too.
“Have you ever imagined what it’d be like to take off and never look back?”
a menace. And the one Gryffindor I thought wasn’t one? He’s the worst of them all. I mean, honestly, Potter must be the most horrid being in the entire world – wix as well as muggle world – because there is no one else that can possibly be as infuriating as he is.
would be able to fall in love with my Harry?
Dean blushes a lot at that, enough for it to be very visible even against his dark skin. As I make my way to the castle doors, both me and Harry and Malfoy wave back knowingly at Dean and Seamus. Since the two of them now have an entire house to themselves, they
The man simply huffed and occupied himself with inspecting Harry’s home.
“Do you know where he went? Draco?”
Before Harry could react, he was launched into the air by two heavily built guards who then started to drag him out of the building. Harry could hear Draco call after him, but he didn’t get the chance to answer before the doors to the room slammed shut between them and then he was outside the palace. He was thrown into a large cage placed on a wagon behind a horse. Right as he was put in the cage, the horse started forwards and all Harry could do was watch as the palace grew smaller and smaller the further away they went.
It’s been two months since he got “stable”. Since they said all that could be done further on was wait. Wait and wait and wait even more.
He was back. Back where it all started, where he talked to a murderer. Back when he realised he had a connection to a madman and he was blamed for those who turned to stone. Back when he first had to wield his power to the world and it hated him for it.
“Mister Harry Potter, sir. What will your pleasure be? Please believe me when I tell you, you ain’t never had a friend like me.”
A rustle of heavy metals clashing together rang through the empty halls and then the gate was open. Harry followed the man silently, made no move to try to escape for he was certain that he wouldn’t make it anyways.
Mere seconds later was he free and mounted on Carpet with Abu in his arms. Harry listened intently to Abu’s tale about how Jafar had stormed into Harry’s room, trashed the entire place in his hunt for the golden lamp. Terrified, Abu and Carpet had fled the scene unseen, and when they finally found the courage to come back, Harry had been gone, Jafar ruled with magic and Draco was imprisoned.
“Perhaps it is love?” Jafar said. “Isn’t that what all the fairytales are about? How love is the most powerful weapon? Draco! Come here!” he demanded and yanked the chains so that the prince stumbled towards him. “What do you say? I could release you from your slaving duty if you only agree to love me. Marry me.”
am your master now, Genie,” Jafar growled. “And that means that you owe me three wishes.”
And the heat is intense
If possible, everything around him got even darker, he couldn’t see anything. The darkness felt heavy upon his shoulders, crushing him to the ground. His knees buckled, once. Twice. Three times before they gave up completely and he fell to the ground.
I flinch at the name, but quickly collect myself. “I don’t care. It’s not worth living if he’s not here. I don’t want to live without him.”
“Of course, Ron, I can’t imagine anything else. We'll see you on Christmas Eve, for sure.”
get used to hearing Malfoy say Harry instead of Potter, but it’s been going on for weeks, so I’ll just have to get used to it, I suppose. And it’s not really that bad to hear him use the name. He always says it very softly. As if it’s a delicate word that he cherishes more than anything. It’s weird. But he’s Malfoy, he’s always weird, just like every other Slytherin I know. They’re weird, but not
“Not to him.”
All I can do is whisper out, “I’m sorry… I wanted to save him… but I was too late… I’m sorry… I… Iov… I’m sooo sorry.”
The man snorted in response to show his disdain in Harry’s displayed self-confidence, but something in his eye told that he didn’t quite believe what Harry was saying.
“Never mind,” he whispers. “You go ahead and talk to him. I’m going to the library.”
“I– what– no, I can’t. I don’t want to. I don’t even know what you’re talking about.”
Without letting his worry show, Harry looked around the street, evaluating what was in reach and what he could use to help the trapped man. He knew that he’d be no match in force compared to the capturer, but he’s smarter and quicker. There
You realise you’re better off wasting your time elsewhere. Though he evidently has his rather (unintentional) hilarious moments, there are better places to be. Like, in your room in your hotel. You turn around to leave.
“But why did he go to such lengths for... me? We’re just partners,” he asked instead.
This is no ordinary lamp
“But I know he wouldn’t want another soul die. Especially not you. Especially not the one who killed Voldemort.”
“Don’t worry, it was no big deal. They couldn’t have caught me, I promise. It’s not like there were a hundred bad guys with swords… only ten guards with swords! I’m sorry for worrying you, but I do have something to make it up for you.”
“You’d be surprised how talkative he gets when I–”
Seamus is for not having used the opportunity he was given that night in the snow house, because obviously he and Dean like each other, but they’re too blind to realise it. I snicker a bit to myself and roll my eyes because, really, it’s Ron who is too oblivious to realise that they already are a couple, only that their dynamics are such that they’re no different from how they were before they got together. I see a knowing expression on Potter’s face and I know he’s thinking the same as I am. Strange, isn’t it, how similar he and I are in some ways? How alike our trains of thoughts are?
Genie threw a quick glance over his shoulder and Harry nodded encouragingly. He knew exactly what he was doing. Or… at least almost exactly. As long as Jafar accepted the offer, everything would work out just as Harry had planned. And if the evil smile spreading across Jafar’s face was any indication, he was indeed walking straight into Harry’s trap.
“I’m sorry, Draco,” Jafar said, though he didn’t sound sorry at all, “It’s already too late. Harry Potter, the street rat you’re talking about, was instantly sent away for his sentence. I’m afraid there’s no way he’ll ever come back.”
He was back. Back where it all started. Back where he tried to leave everyone behind and go end everything on his own. He didn’t want to, but he had to, because everyone that stayed around him ended up dead. Or hurt. Back when he realised everything was his fault, because he hadn’t actually stopped the Dark Lord when he was a baby.
“No!” I shout. “Stop! I don’t want to!”
Christmas is here, at last, and it's time to meet Draco and Harry some more. And the Weasleys. Merry Christmas everybody!!!
“It’s okay, thank you, Genie.” Harry said. “But we have to get back to the palace. I must speak with Draco, because I’m fairly sure of who did this!”
welcome that. He clung to the pain, in his mind reaching forward to it, not ready to let it go as the pictures started to appear in front of his eyes. The physical pain left him, and he was left cold, helplessly falling through nothing until...
He would’ve loved to help with this, only he and George would surely have built in several unknown traps and other pranks. Then, when it was done and the first person went in…
“Oh, for the love of Salazar, you’re hopeless!” Draco clamours and throws his arms into the air. “Just go talk to him. Tell him. Just, cross this damn room and proclaim your undying love for the stupid weasel. Or I’m going to do it for you.”
Safe.
It had all been very well throughout the day. The boys had stayed in Scorpius’ room most of the time, except when they surprised Draco and came to help him set the table for dinner. It seemed Potter’s son had some rather good influence on Scorpius, Draco thought while the two boys chatted in low voices, and he smiled fondly at them.
He wanted the physical pain to come back, because that was what he deserved. He didn’t deserve to live happily ever after, as they wrote in the newspapers. He needed to pay. He had to suffer.
Harry doesn’t look peaceful. He doesn’t look like he’s resting. He looks... as lifeless as the rest of the interior in this stupid room at St. Mungo’s. His cheeks are sunken in, his skin looks ashen. He looks dead.
But Jafar’s question had made Harry realise something: he wanted power. There was nothing that mattered to this man except power. Now Harry just needed to come up with how to use that against him.
However, now that I am the only one who knows, Potter has made it his mission to drive me mad about it. Constantly. And right now is no exception. We are alone in the Common Room, he, Draco and I. Though, the two of them aren’t sitting too close to each other, knowing that anyone can come in through the entrance door at any time, Potter still fires off enquiries every other minute to hint at what only I know. What’s even worse, Draco has started to do the same! And worse still, they’ve taken to
Harry found Draco in the grand lobby, where he was playing around with Rajah. Without knowing why, Harry was taken over by a strong urge to hug the prince, so he crossed the floor in long strides and promptly embraced the other man. When Draco asked what it was for, Harry just shook his head and kept his hold on him. What would he have answered anyway? He didn’t really
I shouldn’t be here. This is their moment, and now I know my best friend is fine. I turn to leave, but–
Inside, there really wasn’t much. A frayed mattress acted as a bed, covered in several pieces of textiles. Some old, secondhand cupboards that Harry had gotten from an old lady as a gift for helping her buying her weekly supplies for a couple of months. On top of one of them there are a couple of random items; his own collection of things of sentimental value. On the other side of the room there was a window which faced the rooftops of the city and… the palace. Harry’s favourite thing about this place was the view of the palace. It was what gave him the motivation to go through another day.
“Or… come to think of it, it could’ve been. I could’ve helped it. I could’ve
While Draco pleaded with his father, Harry noticed how Jafar’s face showed an even more cruel smile than before and that he was pointing his snake looking staff at the Sultan. The red gems in the snake’s eyes were shining just like they had when Jafar trapped Harry in the Cave of Wonders. Before Jafar had the chance to notice Harry looking at him, Harry flung himself forwards and jerked the staff out of the man’s hand. Without hesitation, he hit the staff at ground, crushing the gems. The spell was broken. Lucius eyes lost its glaze and he looked around the room, clearly showing the confusion he felt.
Fred.
“I’ll take it!” you say. “After all, it is a whole new world.”
“Your highness, it was Grand Vizier Jafar. We can not let him go. He must come with us.”
After dinner, they had all settled to watch a movie. This was when the two youngsters once again surprised Draco. Draco had expected them to argue with him about seeing some action movie with lots of fighting in it that they were too young to see. But they immediately chose to watch
“Albus, stop worrying. It’s okay. I will sing to you. Are you alright with
Bang the drums!
Draco hadn’t even seen the prince who had called for his presence. He hadn’t needed to. It was just another prince who wished to marry him, to follow the constitution. It had angered him to no end that they just didn’t seem to understand that there were more important things than the laws of marriage for royalty. It had angered him so much he couldn’t even appreciate that at least it had been a prince this time and not a princess.
After dinner, I find myself once again sitting at the window in the boy’s dormitory. It’s still snowing. I still like it. It still numbs the pain a bit, it covers the scars. Then I hear Malfoy and Harry enter behind me, bantering as they always do. I turn towards them and smile. Snow may numb the pain, but friends and family heal it. And even with my loss, I have still gained even more. Fred isn’t here, me and ‘Mione didn’t work out, but I’ve got more friends now than ever anyway. After all, I can even get along with Malfoy for ten minutes without cursing him. Who would have thought, eh?
“The key to the Cave of Wonders,” the man answered. “Inside this cave, you will find all the treasure you can ever think of, and I’m willing to give it all to you if you only bring one thing for me. An old oil lamp. If you do that, I’ll clear your criminal record as well as offer you the rest of the treasure within the cave. But I must warn you, there will be many traps in there, and if you do not bring me what I wish for, I will make sure to set them off.”
“Ten thousand years,” the man stated, his voice on the verge of being shrill. “It surely gives you a crick in your neck.” He continued before he seemed to notice the small crowd that was watching him. “Hello there, what’s your name?” he asked Harry.
“Indeed, it is me,” Harry answered hurriedly. “And if you don’t mind, I have to get out of here to help this man to somewhere safe! Before that gora over there is gonna kill both of us.”
//∆\\
A snowball hits me in the back, and draws me back to reality.
They all went to Harry’s room and sat down on his bed. Then Harry and Draco told their stories and ended them with telling their two dear friends that they’d be wed the day after.
“Look at this, yes combination hookah and coffee maker, also makes Julienne Fries. It will not break, it will no — it broke…
“No! But father, I have found someone. I have chosen Prince Harry!” Draco desperately tried to beg to his father, but his eyes were blank, unresponsive. Draco sprang forward, placing two trembling hands upon his father’s chest, fiercely looking into Lucius’ eyes.
“Draco, my darling, I understand that you are upset, but so am I. I, however, am not upset about some incorrect arrest. Right now, I’m mostly grieved by the fact that you
Chuckling a bit over that thought, I answer, “No, I suppose we wouldn’t. That would be quite disastrous. Let’s hope they haven’t hexed each other into oblivion already.”
“What was that?” Jafar bellowed. “What did you say?”
“What?” Harry repeated. “A genie? You’re kidding.”
“But you’re the one who brought it up,
hopeless! And ironic. Almost all his life had been about finding enough food to stay alive, to not starve. He had gotten good enough at stealing to not really have to worry about it too much. And now he was about to die from starvation anyways. Or dehydration. Ironic.
All of it is quite heavy work, but I like it. It feels good to create stuff. It numbs the pain.
Time went on, the sunrays burning Harry’s skin until he felt as grilled as the scorpions they sold in the market. But the closer the day got to night, the less Harry felt the burn. He was consumed by a much greater pain. The past couple of hours, he had entertained himself with thoughts about what Jafar might be doing to Draco and his father. He imagined one horrible fate after the other that Draco could possible be living through, and it made Harry hurt more than anything.
Harry had always known that Draco was fair,  that was essentially the only thing that everyone and anyone knew about him. Harry had also heard that he was fierce, that he threw tantrums whenever he didn’t get what he wanted. But after meeting the man, he had a hard time believing that rumour was true. The prince had shown that he could be demanding, for sure, but he had only shown that side of himself when other people needed it — he never used it for himself.
////——\\\\
Sirius.
!” he snarled, helplessly trying to writhe out of the other man’s firm grip.
They rode for a long time and Harry gave up on pondering what horrible fates the man could possibly have planned for him, and he amused himself with thoughts of the happiness he had experienced until now. He thought about the incredible times he had spent with Abu, all the fights he had picked with other street boys just for the fun of it, only to get a scorning from Abu afterwards. And he thought about the prince. Prince Draco Malfoy.
“Stop! I DON’T WANT TO HEAR IT!” I shout, more flustered than I have ever been before. It’s not that I’m a prude, really, but I
When Harry finally turned to face the other man, he found him looking out the window with wide, wondrous eyes as if he had never seen a view like that which he saw right now. Harry watched him with fascination. The man was hiding most of his appearance with his hood, and the cloak didn’t reveal any of what kind of clothing he was wearing beneath. Yet, there was something about him that made Harry feel all giddy. And safe.
“Hi, Harry.” Draco said when he approached him. As soon as they notice him, the man that was accompanying Harry left the scene. “I’m sorry about before… I didn’t realise… I didn’t realise that it was you.”
Finally, Draco relaxes. He leans into Potter’s touch and I let out the breath I must’ve been holding for a moment. I’m feeling lightheaded and I
Then something else caught his eye. By the end of a table full of food stood Genie. He too was chained, and he couldn’t move more than a few decimeters away from the table leg he was attached to. Carefully, Harry sneaked between pillars until he was standing within whispering distance to Genie.
And the finest merchandise this side of the River Jordan, on sale today. Come on down.”
“Who cares about the law? Draco loves you and you love him. What else can I wish for? And I am the sultan after all. I can just… change the law.”
“Harry?” Draco whispered a while later. They had been quiet for quite a long time, just enjoying the warmth of the other person. “This is really lovely, but… you know we have to go back right?”
Forgiving.
“Bloody hell,” he muttered. He didn’t say anything else.
Everything was crawling. Around him. On him. In him.
“Draco!” Harry cried out. “Hurry, Carpet, we must save them!”
“I know I’ve only met him once, but it’s something special about him. I think… I think I’m falling in love with him.”
Fred.
He was back. Back where it all started. Or where it ended. The dark forest towered around him, casting frightening shadows upon the way he was walking. Back where the green curse hit him, the pain that followed, the death that wasn’t enough to save everyone. Back where he sacrificed himself but didn’t save
“Well, he did ask for you,” Draco hummed, “but it took some time for you to come, so he asked me to sing. I didn’t know that… you never had anyone help you through your nightmares…?”
Harry shook the memory out of his head and focused on the young brother and sister that were still watching his bread hungrily. He didn’t need any more pondering. He cooed gently to the two children, reassuring them that he would do them no harm, and he offered his piece of bread to them. Next to him, he could hear Abu chatter disapprovingly, just like he had always done whenever he saw Harry giving away his food. Harry ignored him, and firmly gave it away before walking out of the alley.
“Hey, come here, I’ll get you outta here.”
It was a dumb question, really, for Harry could see the fruits laying on the table below the windowsill, but he still asked in an attempt to soften Abu’s mood. The monkey just huffed annoyingly and snatched an orange which he began to peel, ignoring Harry’s sorrowful looks. Harry hated to upset his best friend. But for now, there really wasn’t much he could do. So he turned back to their new guest.
“I still don’t believe you,” Harry said. “Nothing of what you just said is possible. It’s more impossible than a magic carpet!”
“We are here because we’re searching for something. An old oil lamp. Do you know where we can find it?” The carpet nodded frantically, happily waving for Harry to follow him before speeding off further into the cave. Then it was gone. Harry sighed to himself, before shouting into the tunnel for the mat to come back.
“Would you really do that, father?” Draco asked incredulously.
too smug about the situation. “Draco, please do something about your boyfriend, he’s getting out of control. You should probably put him on a leash or–”
Abu started off on an angry but hushed rant of chatters the moment he was by the side of Harry, but Harry couldn’t be bothered to tell him to be quiet. He was just relieved that he wasn’t alone anymore. While smiling softly, he let Abu tell him off for ending up in jail. When the monkey gradually grew silent, Harry noticed that Abu’s words changed from anger to sadness.
“Wrong,” Genie said, and when Harry raised his eyebrows at him he explained. “You are not falling in love with him because you
The further into the street he got, the more the stands sold more common goods for the city’s population’s everyday needs. It was a wonder to see these normal folks walking about the street, stopping and greeting whenever they saw someone they knew or loudly bargaining with each other over how much a certain honey melon should cost.
“I have decided upon a suitor for you.”
You know I’m no good on my own.
“Do you swear that they were trained to Department standards, and taught with the knowledge of the goal that we here at the Ministry strive to achieve?”
“Well......he’s a guy for starters...” Draco offered hesitantly.
"That's
"Oh, I dunno. Maybe being a sarcastic asshole and calling them wankers the moment they walked in the door." The dark haired male deadpanned, shooting his lover an unamused scowl.
The leader waved his hand in a “
“Right here, Draco.”
The two figures magically floated upwards, and Harry maneuvered them sit onto the couch before releasing the spell.
“I suppose, that makes sense...” Draco drifted off quietly, suddenly staring at the wall in deep thought.
“I’m sorry Mr. Potter, you’ll have to understand that this isn’t personal—I just need to make sure that you won’t follow us....”
" Davies murmured as he read.
“Minister,” Draco started cooly, glancing at Harry quickly before returning his gaze to the older man in front of him. “Can you at least tell us
"What time did you tell them to come over at...?"
Blackwell followed his gaze with a frown, and froze when he saw the gash. "That's...how on earth?"
’ unless the situation proved dire. It was heading in that direction, though.
“Mmmm, got it....,” The Gryffindor replied with a chuckle, reaching up to help the blonde out of his own T-shirt before their snogging resumed.
Florence paled as he watched his two young protégées being levitated through the hallway—both boys lain on crisp, white linen stretchers. Their bodies were completely still—a stark contrast to the many people bustling frantically around them. The staff entered through a set of wide doors, and Florence knew he wasn’t allowed to follow them. He watched the two stretchers until the doors swung closed behind them, and he could see them no more. Florence sunk down onto one of the benches lining either wall of the dim, sterile hallway—cradling his head in his hand with guilt.
Harry distanced himself from Draco who lay sprawled on the ground, holding his side with a grimace.
Draco would always revert to calling him
"And why's that?" Knightly settled his hands on his hips defensively.
“Was that when you sent me the patronus message?” Florence questioned gently.
“Mmm....
"Well you do that quite often, mate." Harry joked nervously.
Harry knew he’d regret saying those words, and though they hadn’t yet been put to the test—he had the unnerving feeling that they were going to be.
Ronald! I told you, Harry said to meet him at 2:30, not 3:00!" The unmistakable voice of Hermione Granger quipped shortly as she suddenly landed in the fireplace—bending down to quickly dust the excess floo powder off of the bottom of her coat.
“He’s not gay, is he?”
“Is how you and Potter started dating...” Theo finished with a small quirk of his lips.
"I'm...not sure."
Again, Harry and Draco both nodded their heads—oddly quiet.
Florence paled slightly and his hand fell. “We’re...actually not sure...”
Draco froze and Blaise’s grin only grew all the more.
"Apparently this hadn't gotten to my desk yet," he mumbled.
Blackwell gazed at the wound on Harry's chest, then turned to Davies with a raised brow. "Yes?"
“...Tomorrow...?” Draco continued, his voice barely above a horrified whisper. He gave Kingsley a look that made it seem as if the older man had suggested he marry a hippogriff.
. Now we can watch from the couch comfortably.”
the one who's gonna start shit!"
Blackwell's eyes widened slightly as a wave of understanding crossed over him. "If they were each hit with a dark curse, and that curse left dark magic in both of their bodies..."
......?"
Harry, instead of reminding him for the hundredth time that he was perfectly capable of apparating himself back to the Ministry, simply indulged the older man’s request and grabbed hold of his arm. The familiar, but still unsettling feeling of being stretched like a piece of taffy traveling a hundred miles an hour came and quickly passed, and his feet made contact with the ground once again.
One of the men produced a wand from the inside of his robes and pointed it at the Hippogriff.
"Well that—" Draco stopped and sent a trademark smirk to the dark haired male. "—and I can't resist dressing my Gryffindor lover up in Slytherin colors~"
“Yes?”
The figure pranced closer to the tree-line until it emerged in front of them—gold and brown feathers glittering slightly in the dimly lit forest. It clicked its beak at them and slowly paced back and forth—eyes never leaving them.
“Ah, please sir. I’m nowhere near ready,” Harry refuted humbly, his face flushing in color at the high praise from his mentor.
“What am I doing here? It’s Sunday, mate! I always come over and we watch the people in the muggle box on Sunday!” Blaise retorted indignantly, thankfully not catching on to anything strange yet as he perched himself on the arm of the nearest chair to the fireplace.
“Dray...?”
“Insurance,” He replied flatly, not meeting either of their gazes.
“Aha, found it mate,” Draco announced quickly as Harry crept onto the first stair of the staircase and dashed up. “Like I said, between the cushions.”
“Don’t be shy, just spit it out.”
You're telling
Harry chanced a glance to the opposite side of the couch and immediately quirked a brow.
“Hold on now, how do
Hermione actually quirked her head interestedly. “I’ll admit, even we haven’t heard this story yet Harry.”
“Ah Potter, what time can we expect the rest of our company to arrive at?” Blaise cut in suddenly, trying to steer the mood away from quiet and depressing.
Ron raised a brow incredulously and gave his friend a strange frown- ignoring the blonde in his peripheral. "Seriously mate? You don't have a thing for girls at all?"
’, Harry and Draco fell from the sky, landing hard on the ground of a dim and quiet forest.
Harry flinched and gripped his wand tighter, causing the man to let out another deep chuckle.
trying to find some sort of relief in grinding against the body heat of his lover.
“You know we’re technically not related to houses anymore,” Theo interjected pointedly, earning a shrug from the Italian.
“Ah, well...”
, don't ignore me!" The blonde protested, and climbed the staircase after him.
He trailed off, and Harry’s eyes widened slightly as the puzzle pieces started to click together.
“Well obviously mine. I told you—my story is definitely closest to the truth,” Draco stated firmly.
Draco stopped speaking and let the ominous tone sit in the room for a bit as he took a languid sip of his coffee—all remaining eyes at the table trained fixedly on him.
Harry glanced up and met his gaze in surprise. Apparently the strange reaction caught him off guard. Draco shook his head slightly and diverted his attention as the fingers gripped his arm firmly.
"Oh, Minister!" The wizard at the front of the group started in surprise. He evidently hadn't expected any one else to be in the room—much less the Minister of Magic. He walked further into the room, still flanked by a group of several other wizards and witches dressed in similar white robes. "What an absolute privilege."
“My new...? Oh...” Harry closed his eyes and rubbed at his temples. “I thought that was just a bad dream...”
"That Muggle box...What's it called? The thing that takes the pictures that don't move."
The woman picked up her wand and flourished it a few times, muttering spells under her breath. Two clipboards with a hefty stack of paper on each suddenly came zooming from a hallway behind her—landing on the desk in front of her with a solid ‘
“And that was pretty much it for the beginning of the story,” Harry concluded, flushing slightly at all of the eager eyes fixated on him.
"Ron?
"Oh, don't get your knickers in a twist—we've got plenty of time to get things ready. Just
Draco glanced briefly at the eccentric older man, seeing his face slightly stern and serious for the first time. For some reason it made him feel even more nervous—as though now everything he did would be brought back to Florence due to his training. He shook his head and tried to pay attention as Kingsley’s voice boomed through the room again.
"Uh, fine I think...?"
“It’s a newer department that Kingsley had established when he became Minister of Magic after the war. Our job is basically to evaluate the current laws around the Wizarding World— some that have to do with the safety and protection of magic from Muggles, some are just the laws of magic themselves. We then decide if the laws are working, and if they’re not what we need to do to change them and make them effective...” She trailed off and her cheeks tinged pink when she realized that she had started rambling, and quickly looked away to avoid eye contact with the Slytherin.
She stepped around the desk and gestures down a hallway.
"I thought you said they were coming at 4...." The Slytherin drawled in amusement, causing Harry to snap out of his frozen state and turn a miserable look to the blonde.
“So...what exactly are we supposed to put in our contract..?” Draco asked with a quirk of his brow, looking somewhat disturbed.
Harry had the grace to look slightly bashful as Ron threw an accusatory scowl over at his supposed best friend.
“Wonder what his problem is.......,” He mumbled with a frown, finally directing his gaze up towards the screen mounted across from him on the wall. “Ah yeah! I love The Great British Bake Off!”
Harry rolled his eyes at the dramatic statement. “Honestly Draco, what’s the worst that could happen?”
......"
“Because...,” The Gryffindor replied monotonously, tapping his finger on his lips in thought. “I will not accept another incident happening like last time....”
“Hey, I’ll have you know that those children love me!” Blaise exclaimed with a pout.
The girl stepped in front of Draco and peered at Harry curiously, raising a manicured eyebrow as she inspected for...
“Over there,” The nurse directed softly, gesturing to the last bed in a row against the wall before bowing her head and leaving the room. As the doors closed, an eerie silence immediately feel upon the room, leaving Florence with even more a sense of anxiety.
“Alright, alright already! I wanna hear mooore! What happens next?” She asked enthusiastically, practically bouncing in her seat in excitement.
“...You do what...?” Ron scrunched his face up in confusion.
Draco crossed his arms over his chest and stared Harry down. “Alright then savior of the Wizarding World—what’s your plan?”
Draco groaned in annoyance and threw a loathing glare at the door when he head Blaise yelling at the Telly from downstairs. Harry bore an equally put-out expression as he raised his head to look for the source of the commotion.
Draco contemplated Harry’s words with a cock of his head. “I was wondering along similar lines...I don’t want to say that it seems reckless and irresponsible to send out two rookie Aurors together to work on cases when there are plenty of senior Auror pairs that do the same type of cases, but...”
“Ron.” He grinned back with a nod.
“Oh well...” Harry fumbled over his words as he tried to think of the most tactful way to explain to his friends about the purpose of this luncheon. Against his better judgement he had invited the three of his friends with an invitation that only gave the vague notion of having lunch together.
Davies groaned and rolled his eyes as the squabbles—mainly of Draco and Knightly—filled the room with incessant noise. Suddenly a movement caught his eye, prompting him to snap his fingers. "Shush, shush. Look."
“So...what exactly do we need to discuss...?” Harry asked dryly, clearly still not on board with the whole idea of getting along with Draco.
“Well, as to your question about a new Auror partner...,” Kingsley stated the topic gingerly, and suddenly started to avoid Harry’s eyes.
“Details, Draco! Details!” The dark skinned male demanded, eyes glittering with excitement at this new found revelation.
time. But it’s the first time you’ve tried to hide it from even me and Mione!”
Harry’s eyes widened in slight horror as he listened to what Kingsley was saying. “But why do we have to make an Unbreakable Vow?! That means that we’ll die if we don’t uphold the contract!”
“Malfoy, what the bloody hell—?!”
“No,” Harry returned angrily, balling his hands into fists in irritation. “I just figured that it would be better if we formulated some sort of plan instead of wandering around in circles. Knightly has been gone for almost 15 minutes now and we haven’t moved an inch from where he dropped us off at.”
what you did.”
“I think I’m sick.”
“Something like that,” He mumbled.
happened, each of us has our own interpretation of what actually happened...but...”
“You and Harry both?”
“-Oi! Draco!” Harry protested as he was successfully tugged backwards and fell back onto the couch. The blonde wasted no time in quickly capturing his prey—climbing on top of the Gryffindor with a seductive smirk.
Hermione stared strangely at the bizarre behavior that the normally snarky and cruel blonde was displaying, but shook her head with a slight frown. People don't change that easily.
"From what I heard, you met a nasty jinx in the form of dark magic," the healer responded, carefully unwrapping the bandages.
“Huh.....I don’t know why you stick around here,” Blaise muttered idly, wrinkling his nose slightly in disdain. “This apartment is so
, and expecting them to get along without trying to tear each other’s throats out...” He deadpanned with a dramatic wave of his hands for emphasis.
“I think there are a lot of people that are taking life seriously after surviving through the war...if another experience like that ever comes up...Well, I think people are done taking their loved ones for granted...” Harry offered wisely, and the blonde’s expression softened in understanding.
“Our first mission...?” Harry questioned in a tone of dread.
Blaise shrugged innocently and swished his wand a few times, sending the couch up into the air before spinning it around and dropping it back to the ground. “
“How have things been going?”
“Knightly....Knightly?.........Florence!”
“Oh—you mean this little sum~?” Blaise grinned wickedly and jiggled the Galleons in his pocket. “I told Pansy that our innocent little Draco had gotten himself a lover, and it turned out to be none other than dear old Saint Potter himself! Well, of course she didn’t believe me, and I bet money on it...So, to the victor go the spoils~!”
"...Draco...?" Kingsley called gently. He was the closest to Draco's bed.
“You don’t
“Hmm? Kingsley?” He questioned confusedly, finally sitting as he saw the dark skinned male hovering over him. “Am I...? Laying on the floor...In your office?!”
As Blackwell shot Davies a questioning look, Davies coughed lightly. "Blackwell, this is Minister Kingsley." He gestured to Kingsley politely while eyeing Blackwell pointedly. "Minister, this is Blackwell—one of our healers who specializes in the research and treatment of dark magic."
She stood up and braced an arm around Ron’s back as she led him back to where the restrooms were supposedly placed—indicated by a small sign.
“Initiation day,” Harry huffed impatiently, drawing a smirk from the blonde.
“Of course, love.”
” He stressed tiredly. “The terms listed on the contract only hold if they apply to both members of the contract—you can’t just list any silly whim you want the other to obey.”
The blonde shrugged his shoulders with a slight roll of his eyes. “Yeah, I guess. He wanted a change, so....”
The blonde scowled but did as he lover bade and slumped down onto the sofa with a huff.
When Draco finally reopened his eyes, the color that he saw first was not the pale blue of the sky above him, but rather, a blur of white. He blinked slowly, trying to make sense of things. He heard an insistent buzzing in his ear, and he wanted nothing more than to make it stop. He maneuvered his head slowly, trying to press his ear down into the pillow.
“See? So now it’s facing the kitchen instead of the fireplace!” Draco happily stated the obvious, looking quiet proud of himself for some reason.
Without a word, Kingsley slowly strode over to the bed—his feet shuffling softly against the linoleum. Florence followed a few steps behind, nearly holding his breath as he finally reached the side of the bed.
Draco looked down at the parchment and hesitated slightly before bending down and signing his name.
Pansy sent him another loathing glare while Draco’s eyes widened and his pale cheeks dusted over ever so slightly with pink. Apparently that bet was news to him.
"So basically that told us nothing," Knightly deadpanned.
A feeling akin to burning fire crawled over the sensitive flesh of Harry's chest. He let out a scream, immediately thrashing to get out of reach as his skin continued to cry in excruciating pain. Davies, as though anticipating this, calmly gestured to a few of the larger male nurses. They stepped forwards and caught Harry's arms—effectively pinning him to the bed.
“Hey mate—look, I hate to ruin your day, but something just came up suddenly so I’m gonna need you to scram,” He tried bluntly, not bothering to sound remorseful when he knew full well that his shag with Harry was on the line.
...."
“You’re such a prat...,” He muttered in annoyance, slipping an arm around Draco’s lean waist to anchor him in place on his lap.
to try and not be such an arse? What about
“Well, take a good look at it now. Tomorrow you two are going to sign this contract, and vow to keep all of the terms listed on it—lest you face the consequences for defying...”
Harry's brow twitched and he had the urge to chuck something at the blonde's hard head.
Either Blaise didn’t hear him, or merely chose to ignore him (the blonde bet the latter), for the dark skinned Italian paid no heed to the words directed towards him and chose to continue watching his show—throwing another few taunts at the screen happily.
“Ah..
“Wow~” Pansy breathed excitedly, her face giddy with what she had heard so far. “Hey, is that
He and Draco had arrived first at the quaint French cafe that they had agreed to set their luncheon at, (per Draco’s request), and sat at their table while they waited for their other guests to arrive. Blaise had been the next to arrive soon after, all smiles and not seeming nervous at all about the whole meeting. Seeing as he had been the most accepting of their relationship so far, his presence actually helped Harry to relax a little—lightening the atmosphere at the same time. A few minutes of talking with his best mate, and Draco’s anxiety seemed to lessen substantially as well.
Before Harry could even mutter a counter-curse, he was sent flying backwards, hitting the ground hard. He groaned at the immediate jolt of pain, tasting blood. He didn’t know what sort of jinx the snatcher had used, but his body felt heavy—pain clouding his thoughts.
"Urg, my head hurts.....what happened..?" Ron blearily opened his eyes and glanced around in confusion—eyes darting quickly to the figure leaning against him.
Ron glowered at the dark skinned male a raised a fist threateningly. “Y-you! Leave her alone you no good!—”
"Young Malfoy's wound...it's healing..." Blackwell darted over to Harry and surveyed the wound. "Both wounds are healing at exactly the same rate..."
" Hermione cut in, her face becoming one of horrid realization.
that the two of you aren’t children that I’m not going easy on you. Believe me, I’d like to get away without harming either of you, but....”
Just as Knightly was about to raise his voice at the lack of "waking up", there was a groan that emitted from one of the beds.
Mean.” Draco pouted with a glare.
“P-pleasure.” She responded nervously, and Blaise took that chance to bring her hand to his lips, gently kissing the back.
, it means that we need to get stuff started for dinner!" Harry retorted indignantly.
A loud banging suddenly filled the room as Kingsley knocked his gavel against the podium, and a hush grew across the room once again. All eyes turned to the Minister as he held up the contract for all to see.
“On it!”
“So after our initiation, Kingsley called us both to his office to have yet another meeting...”
Blaise grinned and released Harry’s hand, turning to the slightly cringing face of his best friend. “Naughty, naughty Dray Dray. Did you really think that you could keep this a secret from me~?”
“Ah yes—where were we now...?” Draco contemplated with a sigh, as if having to search through his memories to think of where the story was going.
“C’mon, I’ll show you to our table,” The raven haired male replied instead, gesturing for the pair to follow him further back into the cafe.
Kingsley chuckled. “The job of an Auror is often unpredictable—so even the best can quickly find themselves in an unfavorable position. This is one of the reasons why we always prefer Aurors to work in pairs...” He paused, as if mulling something over in his head, and Harry frowned slightly.
Harry flushed slightly with a scowl. “Hey, it wasn’t
Harry grimaced and blinked a few times to get used to the sudden bright lighting. There was still a dull pain in his chest, but it was hardly an ache compared to mind-numbing pain that he had felt before. "Did I...pass out?" he asked hesitantly. That was all he needed—for everyone to think that he was some baby that passed out from a little bit of pain. The last thing he could recall before everything went black was the sound of someone screaming.
Both Harry and Kingsley stared in slight shock at what Draco had written.
It was days like this that made him all the more grateful that he had defeated Voldemort and survived through the war. The war had come and gone like the passing of the wind—some days it felt as though it were just yesterday, yet others still felt as though it had all just been a bad dream.
"It looks like something your Great Aunt Agatha would wear."
"Davies—what's going on?" The new healer, Blackwell, wasted no preamble as he strode over to where his colleague stood amidst the hospital beds. Upon inspection, he realized that both boys were unconscious. He frowned.
"Maybe we should just Obliviate them and send them home—then call them back over and do that all again?" The Slytherin suggested gleefully, finally getting up from his place on the floor and flopping down on the couch beside Harry.
Harry knew not what. He tried not to flinch away from her piercing gaze.
? Are you now trying to shove the blame over to
Harry watched in horror as she too collapsed on the floor, falling closely beside the large redhead.
“It’s simply
...Draco....stop,” Harry protested weakly despite throwing his head back in pleasure at the sensation. Draco’s administrations were sending heat pooling straight to his groin—and if he wasn’t careful he was going to end up losing control already.
“Bring it, ferret-face!”
“Ah, right...”
“Ron...” Hermione chastised with a frown, but even she didn’t try to hide her apparent displeasure at seeing the blonde Slytherin again.
. You're not wearing
Hermione muttered something under her breath akin to agreement, but Harry decided to ignore the snarky quips from his fiends for the time being as he turned back to his lover.
“Yes Minister,” Harry declared resolutely, and Kingsley nodded—turning to Draco.
look. Harry's glare cut through, and Draco relented with a sigh, turning back to the stove with a pout and a slight drop of his shoulders.
He turned back and went to Draco's bedside, where Davies was surveying the other boy's appearance.
times. But today he finally decided that he just couldn't bear the guilt of lying to his friends over and over again—it was really starting to eat at him.
Harry shook the outstretched hand before Knightly shooed Davies away again.
“I wonder how well you can protect yourself, though....,” The man paused, and again his eyes drifted towards Harry’s form. “...while you’re trying to protect him...?”
Blackwell rubbed his chin in thought. "I think that we should try waking the two of them up now, and see if we can get some more answers to help us solve this puzzle."
Harry pulled back enough to stare Draco in the eye. "I promise...."
. I’ll tell this part of the story.”
measures.”
“...No, no. I, uh....don’t think you would know him.....,” Draco lied with a shrug.
Draco's normally pale face was flushed and beads of sweat glistened against his forehead and neck. His eyes were still closed but he was stirring—tossing his head back and forth and mumbling aloud.
Blaise narrowed his eyes suspiciously at his friend. “Uh huh.....On another note though, you should really introduce me to your roommate sometime! I mean, you’ve lived here for sometime now and it seems rude to keep coming over without introducing myself!”
“You know
“What time will Nott and Parkinson be here?”
Harry’s head spun at the rush of information, and he held a hand to his temple as he tried to process it all. “So basically...You and Mr. Knightly had us trained, and then conspired about making us partners...
“Malfoy,” Harry grit out.
He grinned to himself as they returned doubtful stares.
The pair continued their languid snogging and groping for another few minutes before Draco finally released his lover’s lips with a groan.
“So you can tell me to man up and be brave and pretend to use your
“Oh don’t you look at me like that, you’re not dragging me into this,” Draco refuted resolutely, ignoring Blaise’s set of amber puppy dog eyes directed at him.
Harry stiffened beneath Draco and shot a glare up at the blonde—who ignored it in favor of keeping an eye on his friend.
“Ah. A quick study I see.”
“We’ll go shopping tomorrow,” Harry promised, doing his best to try and soothe the put-out blonde. “I’m sure we can go back to whatever fancy-ass store it was that you got them from and order another pair.”
“Since we never had an eyewitness, we’ve always argued about whose perception of what actually happened was the right one...,” Harry finally finished.
Harry made a noise of protest, but the Slytherin was already on his way.
The leader sighed and shook his head. “Things can never be easy, can they?” He stared Draco down as he called back to his cronies, not taking his eyes off of the boy. “You lot take that creature back to headquarters—I’ll catch up with you.”
Draco jerked and snapped to attention at having his full name called so loudly.
Draco paled slightly and side-eyed Harry. The Gryffindor didn’t look any less nervous than Draco himself felt—but he wasn’t so sure if that was a consolation or not.
“What’s it to you Malfoy?” Ron glowered back as Blaise returned to his seat next to the blonde.
“Leave that Hippogriff alone!”
"You're embarrassing." Harry muttered grumpily, but felt himself smile all the same.
Hermione gaped at the blonde in clear confusion, while Ron settled for merely giving the Slytherin a dirty look—following his every movement as he pulled out a chair next to Harry and sat down.
“Sorry, it’s just that you’re the only one of Draco’s friends that I’ve actually met yet...I’m still kinda nervous about this while thing...”
“Uh, Blaise! What in Salazar’s name are you doing here?” The blonde called quickly, immediately stopping his movements and dropping his hand out of his hair—trying his best to sound even-keeled with his precarious position perched on top of his lover’s hips. Thankfully the new couch position, being turned away from the fireplace—hid the length of Harry’s body, but still left the upper half Draco’s body visible due to his upright sitting position.
“Knightly, you may be dismissed.” Kingsley turned to Harry. “Potter, you stay here. I’d like to have a word.”
The three wizards restrained the barely—conscious Hippogriff and bound it with two more of the silvery chains that Harry and Draco had seen around its neck earlier. Then, one of them produced a leather strap which they used to firmly clamp shut the Hippogriff’s sharp beak.
“That’s a lie! I saw you and your goons jinx it before tying it up again!”
“Why not apparate then?” Harry questioned.
Davies exhaled shakily, running a hand through his normally-impeccable hair. What the bloody hell is going on here? Where on earth did this wound come from? Draco came into the hospital with little to no physical wounds on his body—and there certainly wasn't a matching wound like the one on Harry's chest! The only major concern in young Draco's case was the internal injuries that he suffered from...also the fact that there was so much dark magic left in his body even after we took care of the stuff that was actually causing damage to his body...Unless...
Blackwell nodded and turned to Harry's bed, the closest of the two patients to him. "He was stable when he came out of surgery—what happened?" He examined Harry's face and took his pulse, pausing at the elevated beat beneath his fingers.
“I’m sure you would...” Draco replied with a mischievous look, turning to murmur something to Theo next to him.
Harry glanced down at himself with slight surprise. He hadn't even realized that the bandages were there until they were brought to attention. Harry gently felt the wound through the layers of carefully wrapped bandaging with his fingers. It didn't really hurt, surprisingly. He grimaced. "...It's fine...I think. But how did I get this?"
5 Galleons on the bet that
“So, how did it go?” Kingsley asked seriously, wasting no time with preamble.
The snatcher placed a hand on his chest as if offended. “Capturing? No, no—you misunderstand. We saw this poor Hippogriff knocked unconscious and tangled in chains, so we came to its aid! We’re going to bring it back to our headquarters and take care of it before we release it.” The man smiled smoothly, a mischievous glitter in his eyes.
Draco had finally begun to stir.
“Yes?”
Draco bit his tongue.
“Not...exactly,” The Minister answered hesitantly—standing up from behind his desk and turning to pace around the room slowly, clasping his hands behind his back and frowning slightly as he collected his thoughts.
"They can wait. I reckon I need at least a month for things to go back to normal before
Blaise rolled his eyes at the meaningless information.
“It’s...been going well.” Hermione offered with a slightly strained smile, glancing at Ron for comment.
“You already introduced yourself, Blaise,” The blonde replied with a roll of his eyes, glancing over at Hermione. “Granger, er...Mrs. Weasley? No...Bloody Hell, this is gonna get too confusing...”
round~" The blonde pulled his lover over to the couch and pushed him to sit down, sinking down to straddle his lap.
“The story...”
“Thanks,” Draco responded quietly, oddly pensive at the moment.
“Alright,
“Does Malfoy know? About us...being partners...?”
“Well, that’s..,” Harry trailed off uncomfortably and glanced at his lover for help.
Kingsley swept a gaze over Draco’s listless form and sighed deeply, taking a step away from the bed and beginning to pace—hands clasped firmly behind his back.
Harry's heart filled with emotion and he quickly strode over to his lover- embracing him and pouring all of his feelings into the hug.
After the initiation had finished and the formalities were over with, Kingsley had promptly ushered both Harry and Draco up to his office—where they now awkwardly sat while they waited for Kingsley to get on with their meeting.
Florence bounded forwards and signed the bottom of the parchment with a grin. He handed both quill and parchment back to Kingsley before guiding the boys back down to their place in front of the podium as Kingsley took one final look over the paper in his hands.
..each other..?”
"No, no, we...had to anesthetize you..." Davies explained slowly.
“This prick works in the Pediatric ward at St. Mungo’s...” The blonde supplied tiredly, rolling his eyes as Blaise puffed his chest out proudly.
Acting before his lover could deliver what would no doubt be a clever and witty remark to turn Hermione’s statement, Harry quickly kicked Draco in the shin—silencing any retort on the tip of his tongue.
"Ah, yes. Thank you, Greensberry." Davies snatched the parchment without hardly a second glance at the girl. Blackwell's tall frame peered over Davies' shoulder as he turned and examined the pages. Together, both wizards read through the surgery notes.
“Florence.”
"Harry, mate......How could you.....?" Ron asked with a scowl, though it didn't stop the hurt from bleeding into his voice.
“Fine. But I swear, if I don’t get shagged tonight I’m gonna go crazy,” Draco complained as he flopped onto the couch with a huff.
Healer Davies merely grinned. It was an infuriating type of grin that seemed to hint towards the man's arrogance. "Perhaps it would be better if we have Mr. Potter in here as well. Then I'll only have to explain this once."
"Alright, 'Mione......" A second figure, Ron returned with a slight roll of his eyes, as he too landed in the fireplace—again, bending down to haphazardly sweep the powder off his own coat as well. The redhead took no more than one step out of the fireplace before lifting his eyes and suddenly processing the scene taking place on the couch directly in front of him, barely 10 feet away.
"Custom-made? How'd you know my sizes? Why'd you buy me such an expensive jumper? And what made you pick green?" Harry called in question as he walked back over to his side of the closet and threw on an undershirt before slipping his arms into the soft, silky material of the green garment.
“Shh, Shh! Don’t move, Malfoy,” Harry suddenly hissed, squinting at something off to the side in the tree-line.
"I said I
Though Draco had originally been against integrating many Muggle objects into his and his lover’s flat, Harry had finally convinced him that there were quite a few different Muggle inventions that were quite beneficial for day to day use. The Telly for example. And another one of his recent favorites; the toaster. While one certainly could use magic to toast a piece of bread to the perfect stage of golden-brown-crispy-crunchiness, there was just something so fascinating about putting a piece of bread into that silver box and watching it pop out minutes later.
“I am
Blaise grinned like the Cheshire Cat, obviously immensely enjoying himself.
Florence nodded with a sigh. “I believe so...”
“Tsk, tsk, tsk.....Naughty children should mind their own business...” The snatcher purred silkily, pacing in front of Draco slowly. His eyes drifted down to Harry’s listless form and Draco instinctively side-stepped to cover his view.
He was still a bit peeved at the attitude that his lover had already chosen to adopt as soon as Ron and Hermione had entered their apartment- even after Harry had begged him ahead of time to be on his best behavior.
Draco frowned and shook his head again, avoiding Kingsley’s probing stare. “No...I’m fine...”
"Only one?" Kingsley frowned. "Why?"
“Well obviously Dray. I couldn’t have been more surprised than if you told me you were dating a Hippogriff.” He returned sarcastically—waving his hand for the blonde to keep dishing out information. “Wizard, or Muggle?”
The raven haired wizard floundered awkwardly at the waiter’s insistent invitation, and opened his mouth repeatedly as he struggled with what to say.
