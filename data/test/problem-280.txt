"You're dating Harry Potter. The darling of the wizarding world." He shook his head. "Fuck, we all thought it was just a ploy, getting your kids to be friends. Teaching your kid how to get in with the right sort of people."
What follows is an excerpt of my interview with young Mr. Malfoy. Please note that, while we are aware that the wizarding world is keenly interested in knowing some of the more intimate details of their marriage, out of respect for their privacy and consideration of the fact that both of them are still very young, I did not question Malfoy on those details.
Hatred. It was far too easy to feel, and they all knew they would have to control it if they didn't want it to get out of hand.
He felt his heart stop as the room fell into stunned silence again, and a rushing, sick feeling spread through him like a flash flood.
Actually, he's not. He's too relaxed, too self-assured, doesn't look like Neville at all. For one thing, Neville had no idea his own face could ever look at anybody with as much disdain as he sees there now, as he tries to imitate Malfoy's body language and Malfoy rolls his eyes in impatience at his feeble efforts, just like Grandmother often does.
"Well, Granger said she would offer to clear out of our place for the night, but pointed out that we'd run into her and ourselves if we went back there tonight. Don't forget, right now you're going to bed alone and I'm staying up with my Pepper-Up potion. Or maybe I'm already talking to Granger."
"Can we sing that song we're singing with your choir?" Alec said. Ben rolled his eyes, as usual not overly enthused about music, but willing to sing along anyway.
"Shut up," Harry said impatiently. "We're under pressure from everybody and from ourselves, and even though you're taking a patience potion, it's not enough to cope with how you feel about me or my friends, and your school work on top of that."
Harry froze. Draco looked up to see green eyes warily regarding him. He propped his chin on Harry's stomach, and they gazed at each other for a moment. Harry made a questioning sound in his throat.
"Well if my family's too much for you, why don't you go back to yours then, Anne? Oh I forgot - they're almost all still in Azkaban, aren't they?"
"Come on, Alec," Draco leaned forward and smiled at him, and Alec blinked at him drowsily and stopped squirming.
Draco could already be damaged beyond repair, burned alive by the force of malevolent magic that had just been pouring out of all of them in the last few minutes
world, Harry," Draco said, his voice strained. "I've made a life for myself and Ben here. I'm a respected teacher. People know my name, and it doesn't make them flinch or hate me. They don't know what this means," he said, baring his forearm, with its snake and skull tattoo. He gazed at it dispassionately, then looked up at Harry. "You can't even look at it."
He took a calming breath and straightened himself up, levitated a few of the dirty dishes towards the kitchen, and waited for Arthur to finish casting washing up spells before clearing his throat.
He came back into the kitchen and there was Anne, sitting at the kitchen table with her hand covering her eyes. The fragile peace Fred had found in Robbie's sleepy weight on his lap disappeared.
All of them on edge, despite their extreme fatigue, from the after-effects of the near-disaster and with uncertainty as to whether or not the spell had worked. Whether or not that last pairing had done more harm than good.
"Figured that'd be the death-knell of yer little affair, didn't ye? He'd break up with you in a heartbeat."
The second Auror opened her mouth but the first Auror touched her arm and shook his head, showing her something written on one of the parchments before him, and she sat back.
"Malfoy ditched him," Ron said. "Worried about being seen with him. Trying to shield Ben from bad publicity."
Hermione remembers a Healer asking Snape if he had any thoughts on what might help Malfoy. She remembers that Snape talked for about an hour about the Dark Mark, answering every question the Healer asked, and ended up filling several parchments on the subject, much of his information based on firsthand experience. Remembers also that he didn't even flinch when he saw her reading the parchments.
Ron opened his mouth and Harry put up a hand. "Ron. Don't." He took a deep breath. "Maybe we should just not talk about this anymore. There's been enough bad feeling over it to keep us all arguing forever otherwise." And he firmly closed his mouth and started to head indoors.
"Oh. No, that must've been after--" Draco cut himself off before saying "we broke up," but there it was, floating among them.
"And as for Ginny," said Ron, "remember you two joked you'd start your kids' names with A, and see how far down the alphabet you'd go?"
"I make business connections at concerts. What do I do if somebody sees me conducting, asks a friend how they can get in contact with me, and the friend can't tell them? Musicians and directors work through word of mouth, you know, especially in a small scene like Dublin."
"Oh thank God. I've got a headache," said Anne, Fred's normal cue to bring her her headache potion. He tossed The Prophet onto the table instead.
We were told that the suddenness of the bond - you know, feeling each other's feelings and all that - was too big a shock. Especially because of how the bond happened. We were arguing, and we walked through a door, and that set it off. It was completely unexpected.
Ben's eyes. His eyes as he watched cuffs go around Draco's wrists. Clinging to Harry as Draco was taken away. His small face going blank, as his memory of his very first day in the wizarding world was utterly wiped out. His excitement at seeing magical instruments, singing with Alec before a small audience of wizards, eating charmed sweets, going to broom shop with Harry - all gone. And all because Draco had been an irresponsible idiot and let himself believe in hope, and in Harry.
"You know, if they'd said no, you still could've gone," Harry chuckled, leaning closer and speaking low into Draco's ear, and an unexpected shiver ran down Draco's back. "Been the Green Man again?"
You know what you want. You know what you need, Ron says, as if it was the most normal thing in the world. His rook nods vigorously, and winks at Harry's queen.
Three incidents at Draco's flat so far, in the form of broken windows and ugly words scrawled on the door. Plus at least a dozen nasty letters and three Howlers, two at the hospital and one at home. And now this rubbish on his window; apparently the vandals hadn't been able to get past the ward Harry had put on Draco's door.
Somehow sometime in the last few weeks he's lost all interest in cleavage. Now he's got an obsession with Malfoy's lips, his hair, the way he moves, all grace and strength, and fantasizing about what Hannah Abbott's small breasts feel like has ended, and he kind of misses it. It's been replaced by wondering what it would feel like to pull Malfoy close in passion, not just the innocent embrace they regularly fall asleep to. Really feel him against his body, all heat and hard angles, and he can't hold back a moan, this is way too fast but he's so close, Malfoy's arms are pulling him closer, and he's whispering in Harry's ear, things Harry can't really make out because the heat from Malfoy's body - and his own - is kind of overwhelming, what the hell is he DOING, they've become used to touching each other all the time but this is different. He's pushing against Malfoy, rubbing against him and Malfoy's either going to kill him or burn him up. Malfoy's grinding against him too, gasping, hard as a rock, then his hand is - oh god - and what little Harry can hear has something to do with Not even a Death Eater, I wasn't going to, I love you, and besides, the war's over, and Harry draws back, dizzy, and frowns at Malfoy.
"I think it's supposed to do that, Ben," said Kara. "Let's go see if your dads and Bill are done, all right?"
He shook himself mentally. No, that wasn't the right attitude. His life, god help him, included Weasleys now, and he'd best get used to them. It wasn't that hard. Ron and Hermione - they'd even progressed to first names, and not just because calling Ron "Weasley" would be confusing - were at his place about once a week, so far with no casualties, and Harry's parents-in-law were fairly inoffensive. The other Weasleys, he could do without. Bill and George were friendly enough, but he still couldn't look at Bill's scars without a humbling sense of shame. And there were far too many unpleasant memories attached to George Weasley, the very least of which was the beating Draco had endured from him in his fifth year. The glasses and the stammer always made Draco think of his own father's crimes, and they weren't pleasant thoughts.
"What was he doing, anyway?" Blaise asked, and rolled his eyes as Harry and Hermione exchanged an uncomfortable look. "Never mind, I didn't ask."
"No, I want to listen to the last song," he said, and Draco and Harry glanced at Ben, sleeping soundly in Arthur's lap, and shrugged.
However. Doing this closed off many possibilties, such as scenes that couldn't happen on the same day but might be pretty important, or missing points of view that could shed a lot of light on what was going on in the background, or in the main character's heads. I really wish, for example, that I'd been able to find some way of showing Draco's interrogation under Veritaserum.
All right, that's enough, he told himself sternly after a few minutes, getting control of himself and wondering at the euphoric feeling still flooding through him. Probably due to lack of sleep; the encounter hadn't actually been that funny. But it was all right; he could laugh, there was a
Although maybe it actually was a move on her part. Maybe she was going to try to defect soon, or knew her group was going to be tracked down soon, and was hoping to remind Draco that he'd promised to be her contact on the other side, should she ever need one. As if she needed to remind him.
Harry blinked, his face becoming expressionless, and Hermione could almost feel him shutting down. Ron closed his eyes and put his head down, breathing deeply.
"Oh for heaven's-" Draco muttered a couple of things under his breath, and a few moments later he and Harry were done cleaning, and Alec was eating his chips contentedly.
A what? Harry tried to catch his breath, trying to figure out why they'd stopped. He - they weren't in their room, they were in the Gryffindor dorm - wait, was
Kara looked around the door and stifled a snicker. Ben and Alec were peeing together and very seriously comparing their penises.
How much of that had to do with Draco being back? He pondered the question once more as he dug into his kidney pie. It hadn't been easy, being around the Weasleys the day after George and Molly and Percy had walked in on him and Draco... reconciling. He'd had the uncomfortable sense that he'd let them down - well, most of them, anyway, even though nobody had said a word to that effect. Oddly, Ron and Hermione and George had been openly happy for him. Bill had seemed fairly non-judgmental about it, and Fred... well, Fred was unreadable these days.
Ben scowled at her, but Alec and Draco ignored him and they all started to sing. Harry blew out his breath and went to sit with Ben, taking out
"It's funny, this is what I was afraid of all along," said Draco thoughtfully. "That people would find out. That Ben might get hurt. And that... is exactly what happened."
"You think breaking up with somebody Ben thinks of almost as a father is doing right by him? Having him bounce back and forth among
* Esposito actually means "little husband" in Spanish. Not being a native Latin-speaker, I have no idea whether or not it means the same thing in Latin ;)
Since the day after their divorce, rumours have circulated alleging that Harry Potter and his ex, Draco Malfoy, have become romantically involved again. Now, for the first time, pictures taken on Hogwarts grounds and sent to The Prophet show those rumours confirmed by solid visual evidence.
Malfoy looked at her blankly for a moment. "Kara. No, we were... we weren't sure what was going on..."
"Mr. Potter - oh!" said a mediwitch, entering the room. She smiled nervously at Draco, a bit flustered. "Erm. Mr. Malfoy. Pleased to meet you."
Ron nodded. "You should, erm... you should go to him." Harry's eyebrows went up. "Give you both a bit of time to just... be happy, before the rest of us come raining on your parade." Ron nodded at an upright freezer in the corner of the shed. "Go on, I'll cover for you. That freezer's actually a weird unlicensed Floo; Dad confiscated it last year." He took the parchment from Harry, gave Harry a small smile, and nodded at a breadbox next to the freezer. "Floo powder's in there. I'm happy for you, mate. Really."
He gently pushed Harry onto his back, and Harry waved a small bottle over towards them. Draco took his time, rubbing lube on and gently relaxing Harry to take him in. He recalled their first time together, how tense Harry had been, how Draco could almost feel his pain despite the obvious pleasure Harry had also felt. So different from now. Their dance now was familiar, warm, comfortable, and more than Draco could've imagined he'd ever have, a year ago.
"You came back at Alec's bedside, in the middle of - I'm not putting him through that kind of shite again, all right? If you're going to walk out again, just bloody well do it!"
Harry fastened his cloak and entered the living room, stopping short at the sight of George and Charlie next to the Floo, also wearing traveling cloaks.
"We're doing our best, sir, but... the spells that hold up the stands are very powerful. Having them hit a small child like that, it's..."
It had just come out. He'd never thought it, never let himself think about it - it was part of a little box labeled "do not open," because they were just seeing how it went, and seeing where things led them, and seeing where they ended up, and a million euphemisms for Not Serious Yet and yet here he was and he'd said it and it had to be true, and the first time he'd said it - or even thought it - it was in a room for of hostile, suspicious strangers.
Bill chuckled. "Harry, even if they wanted to, I very much doubt vandals who spell Death Eater with two t's could cast anything more complex than a Sneezing Hex."
Draco and Potter, sleeping in each other's arms, Potter nestled into the curve of Draco's neck, Draco's white hair contrasting with Potter's black, who knew where that image came from. Lucius turned away in distaste at the peace and contentment the image showed.
"We should've thought this concert thing through better" said Harry. "It's over far too late. The boys'll be exhausted for tomorrow."
It's just like any other marriage. It doesn't matter what we were like before the bond, we're there for each other if we have to be. Like I said, we're friends.
They weren't going to get detentions. What had happened had happened because they were both far too tense to be able to deal with each other rationally, and that tension was there because they weren't doing what the bond wanted them to do. The easiest way to make the tension go away was to give in to the bond, and the easiest way to do that was to...
I spoke to young Mr. Malfoy in the Great Hall at Hogwarts, and while he expressed some discomfort at being involuntarily thrust into the spotlight, he was forthcoming and candid with us. And although Harry Potter did not agree to be interviewed, and Malfoy declined to speak for his spouse, Potter was present while I conducted the interview, doing schoolwork at a nearby table. At one point, when I asked a question that made Malfoy uncomfortable, Potter glanced over, obviously highly attuned to the discomfort that his spouse was feeling. He started to rise from his seat, but Malfoy merely shook his head and gave him a reassuring smile and he sat back down. It was a small thing, but showed, better than words ever could, the rapport that has grown between the two.
Gobbledegook, in case anybody's wondering, is the language of goblins. I know swear words in half a dozen languages I don't otherwise speak; I figure Harry might be the same :)
"I don't think that shrivelfig Pepper-Up was brewed quite right," he told Draco, and Draco turned from his perusal of the street.
"Pass the jam, please," Ben said, and Trina passed it over with a smile. That was one point in her favour - she really did like Ben. Not that she'd seen him all that much, but what time they'd spent together had been positive. Unlike Teresa, Kara's most recent ex, who had always looked like she didn't know what to do with her arms and elbows whenever Ben was around.
Hermione shook her head, looking around at the families in the waiting room. "Malfoy," she said suddenly, "have you contacted Kara?"
"Oh thank the Goddess," she sobbed into his hair. "I thought... it's stupid, I know, they said he'd be all right and I trust them, it's just..."
"New masonry spell gone wrong, far as anyone can tell," said Ron. "There were about fifty people buried under the rubble. It's a miracle nobody was killed."
"He really responds well to you, doesn't he?" the mediwitch said, once Alec's potion was downed and Alec was mostly back to sleep.
Harry nodded quickly, eyes closed tight, and lay back down, the strength in his arms giving out. Clapped a hand over his own mouth, biting down hard, a soft keening sound of delight getting past his clenched jaw.
And it can't help that he can probably feel how upset we all are over... all of this. It can't help that his home is being vandalized and we're all starting to fear for his safety, and his dad's.
"Right." Poor decisions. Yeah, that was one way of characterizing Draco's life before the end of the war. Though it seemed odd for Kara to say that the Goddess needed apologies. It seemed to Harry that Draco had done enough apologizing and atoning in the years between his crimes and now, but maybe the Goddess needed things more personal. Harry certainly wouldn't have been able to say anything on the matter; everything he knew about Wiccan customs and beliefs could probably be painlessly tattooed onto his eyelids.
Tea. Tea might be a good idea, a good way to rein in his almost overwhelming desire to go upstairs right now, send the kids away, and have it out with Anne over the picture in The Prophet. He was far too angry to think clearly, and didn't particularly want to deliberately pick a fight; his fights with Anne sometimes left all four of them scared for days.
Draco sighed deeply, shivering as Harry's tongue began to caress him. Merlin, he'd forgotten just how amazing this could feel. How could he have forgotten? Or was it actually better than it had ever been, because of the bond?
"All right, we're ready to begin," Esposito said, once all were gathered in a small sitting room next to Dumbledore's office. Harry started to stand up and Esposito waved him back to his seat, fixing him with a kind but firm look. "Not you, gentlemen. You are in no shape to contribute to this discussion. We will decide what to do, and you will abide by our decisions. You may as well get comfortable." She gestured around at the small room as the rest of them started to move into Dumbledore's office.
Fred nodded. "I know. But... maybe you should be." He stopped, grimacing at his own words. "Look, if you broke up because things just didn't work out between you, that's... that's too bad. But if you broke up with him because you didn't want publicity, or you didn't want to deal with our family..." Fred paused, shook his head. "Look, you don't understand. Harry's going to be a mess over this. He won't know what to do if Alec's permanently injured. He'll need all the help he can get, and if you're part of that and that helps him, so be it."
And they were going to wake up the boys. They hurried out of the bedroom, and Harry leaned back against the wall, letting go.
"I'm not that noble," Harry whispered breathlessly. Draco closed his eyes as a shiver ran through him and Harry threaded his hands through Draco's hair. "I'm here because I want to be too. And damn you for thinking any different."
Potter and Draco stumbled into their quarters and practically fell onto their couch, laughing together, followed by a worried Weasley and very amused Pansy
"I don't think you do," Draco interrupted mildly. "I know what you've told Harry, but I don't think you understand that this is not something to just brush aside. We know he's doing much better than before, but please don't minimize our fears."
"Yeah." Lindsay smiled at him. "My dad had to go to Azkaban, same as yours. He was just lucky that he wasn't as famous. But there've still been a few silly buggers who've tried to make trouble for us." She lifted her chin. "We don't let 'em."
, no. The last thing he needed to do was piss off any Aurors, or get them arguing amongst themselves.
"Just answer yes or no," he'd told Draco as they left his flat. "If it's no, I won't bring it up again, I promise."
The last thing Harry remembers is that he'd been laughing at something Seamus had said at dinner. They were at the Gryffindor table, for the third meal since they'd been bonded again, and Harry had stopped worrying what Draco was going to do with no friends or house around him because there was no point thinking about it. He'd cast his lot in with Harry and his friends, and there was no point trying to pretend anything different. He wasn't being terribly friendly to any of the Gryffindors, but that was all right; they still hadn't heard from his father, were waiting for the axe to fall in the form of yet another Prophet headline, and it was understandable that Draco wouldn't want to talk very much right now.
"So did you teach him how?" Flint asked, and Draco looked at him questioningly. "Potter. Did you teach him how to suck you?"
Both Pansy and Snape - and quite a few other Slytherins - remember the bitterness of knowing that the only reason Aurors were frantically looking for Lucius was that Draco's suffering was affecting Potter.
"Draco? When do we go on?" asked Alec, and Draco suppressed the urge to snap at him. It was only the fifth time he'd asked.
"Right, Mum's finally gone round the twist," said Fred, entering the kitchen. "Dad wants to do a kid's craft that involves newspaper and glue, and Mum thinks it'll be lovely."
Harry's tried so hard to not look at him very much, especially since they share a bed and he regularly sees Malfoy wearing very little. He doesn't know when he went from extreme interest in girls' cleavage, once even growing pink when
I know. It's very sad. Because they're no longer in the same classes and they miss - wait. Did you mean it was very sad that I went to the trouble of making and rearranging class schedules for fictional characters?
"We call upon heat and upon cold," said Esposito, and Lucius breathed a sigh of relief as he recalled the heat of a Muggle-born Auror's house burning to the ground, and the satisfaction of knowing that she would never track down another Death Eater again.
"She's quite talented, isn't she?" said Hermione, leaning over to speak to him. "My mum saw an advert for her next show."
Draco's last memory is of tepid pumpkin juice, and an irate thought that Malfoy house elves would never allow pumpkin juice to sit until it got warm. Or perhaps he'd just noticed for the tenth time that it was odd how, even though he didn't belong at the Gryffindor table, he felt a damn sight more relaxed here than he had in the three weeks that he'd been a pariah at Slytherin. Feeling like a long nightmare of exclusion and fog that had begun the day his father had disowned him was finally lifting.
Damn it, he was getting hard. He didn't want this, his whole being rebelled against it, he wanted to keep fighting it with all his strength... but part of him actually wanted to be forced into taking whatever would do the trick. Because he'd
Cornfoot licked his lips, whether from nervousness or anticipation Draco couldn't tell. "Tonight after dinner? There's an unused classroom Ellen and I used, fifth floor, near Boris the Bewildered-"
Flint sat back, annoyed. And Draco was struck once again by the thought that Flint wasn't evil. This wasn't even personal to him. He'd just been bored, and looking to have some fun, and now he looked a bit like Ben did when Draco took away one of his toys.
They'd discussed oral sex, before, with Esposito. Harry had been (predictably) squeamish at the thought. And it really hadn't come up again, as they were both normally too eager to bother with anything slower than mutual pleasure. But maybe it was high time Harry got over that particular hang-up...
"They may not, you know," Malfoy said, almost gently, and Harry shivered, crossing his arms defensively. "Potter. You're panicking again," said Malfoy, and Harry felt, like a physical touch, Malfoy projecting calm at him.
"Well no, but I was starting to like you and that really pissed me off. I'm really sorry the papers said you were abusive. When did you?"
Draco shook his head. "We've got the NewFace amulets. Thanks, by the way. Besides, I did the job last year with no serious problems."
"The only cousin to know anything about papier mache," Ron said, chuckling. "Who would've ever believed someday Malfoy's kid would be teaching ours the finer points of a Muggle craft?"
No, but it wasn't that big a problem. I mean, the bond takes care of that, doesn't it? Plenty of gay wizards marry somebody of the opposite sex and manage all right. Besides, the fact that it was him was a lot more difficult than the fact that he was male.
"See, it's all in keeping them off-balance," Flint said to Ellis, "so they can't even hope to control their answers." He turned back to Draco. "Your son? What does your son have to do with you falling for Potter?"
"That's OK?" Harry asked quietly, and watched a shiver run through Malfoy, watched his pulse beating wildly in his throat. Malfoy brought a hand to Harry's face and he leaned into it, impulsively kissing Malfoy's palm, startling a bit as Malfoy pulled back - damn, that had been the wrong thing to do, apparently-
"You can have a better time. You can take the time to celebrate one whole year together without killing each other. Celebrate being happy together." He paid close attention to his meal, realizing he was cutting the duck with the same precision he usually saved for slicing frog entrails.
Pansy remembers starting to develop a hex to work on Lucius. It had to do with rather a lot of pain, both physical and emotional. She didn't finish it, but still has her notes, and every so often, when she remembers Draco's ashen features and the way his sweat-soaked hair clung to his forehead as Potter held him through the worst of it, she fiddles around with her curse some more.
They glanced at each other and subsided into silence as the adults bustled about. Remained silent as Esposito, Lupin, and the Malfoys were contacted and a time and place was set for an emergency meeting about their "situation."
Things were going well with Draco. They had been slowly getting back into a friendship of sorts in the last few days, relaxing a bit in each other's presence, even teasing each other sometimes. Was that going to change now, after today's article?
"Yeah, he's so good at it that he may have saved Alec's life, in a public place. And then spent two hours in here with Harry, knowing there's reporters around. He didn't have to, you know. He could've asked to go somewhere more private to wait with Kara, I'm sure the staff would've agreed."
"Oh. Erm... not sure." Uncomfortable pause that Draco didn't seem to notice. "Erm, I dunno, sometime around when we slept together that first time. I think."
"You're sure?" Harry asked, feeling the knot in his stomach loosen slightly. He glanced back as the boys burst into yet another argument over Lego pieces, turning back to Bill as Kara moved back to adjudicate.
Ron sat down at the foot of the bed, smiling as Alec rolled over in his sleep. "Good. Getting ready to go back to work."
The spell began and Lucius watched impassively as the three 'neutral' members of the inside circle linked their magic together. Soft lights glowing from all three wands, Esposito's, Pomfrey's and Dumbledore's, slowly coming together and mixing in the middle.
"Oh, come, Weasley, stop the hysterics-" Parkinson begins impatiently, stopping as Malfoy covers his own mouth, eyes watering slightly from the foulness of the potion.
Draco gave a sigh and leaned forward, taking Alec's hand and murmuring to him reassuringly. Harry sat back, glancing at the paper as Draco began to sing softly.
again!" he shouted at the startled boy. He turned and practically dragged Remy into the house. "You and I are going to have a long, long talk about this. And then you are bloody well going to apologize to Ben! This is
The magic was out of control was going to kill his son if it wasn't stopped it came from them and through them and drew its power from Lucius' hatred, from all of their hatred
I've a late meeting with an orchestra so I'll have to drop Ben off at 6, which I know is when the game starts. We'll meet you at the stadium. Please wear amulets.
"Mrs. McClachan?" said the Healer, and an elderly witch rushed to the door. Hermione recalled that the Healers had not seemed very reassuring when they had last spoken to her, but her heart still sank as the Healer spoke and the woman gave a low cry and closed her eyes, covering her mouth. Hermione could feel the fear in the air getting thicker as all of those left in the waiting area desperately tried to hold on to hope, and the old woman began to cry. Harry had gone pale, and he approached their chairs and sat down, his breathing shallow.
"What?" For a moment the juxtaposition of Charms class and McKay and Cornfoot's statement made so little sense that Draco literally couldn't understand him.
Harry felt a touch on his shoulder and he and Draco carefully made their way around the last of the first years, and through the side door that Neville had left open for them. They waited until they were out in the corridor before Harry removed his charm and Draco removed Harry's cloak, and they swiftly made their way out of the building.
They both wanted this, so damned much. With every fibre of their being, they both needed it. Malfoy moved forward, so very slightly, and Harry drew in his breath as their emotions spiralled out of control - and he bridged the last tiny distance between their mouths and hesitantly touched his lips to Malfoy's.
Concentrate, he told himself, and conjured the image of his father. Cold, stern, and strong; a worthy role model for anybody. And Narcissa, the epitome of all that was feminine grace and refinement.
"Your dad's still just a stupid Death Eater!" Remy yelled at Ben, and before Harry could react, Alec had hit the older boy, who looked literally gobsmacked for a moment before pulling his hand back to slug Alec right back - and then Ben and Michelle started to move - and suddenly about a half-dozen voices were crying out and parenting spells were flying across the yard.
Harry remembers Draco finally breaking down around the fourth day, and remembers not being able to stop his own tears. He remembers both of them sobbing tiredly in each other's arms, and it wasn't cathartic and it wasn't cleansing and it wasn't a relief, it was just painful and exhausting and hopeless.
They both remember Pomfrey taking Draco's wand away during one of his more lucid moments on the fourth day. Only Harry remembers Pomfrey and Hermione and a couple of Order members whispering about giving Draco some kind of potion to dampen his magic, as his emotional control got more and more fragile and his magic started to manifest itself randomly and increasingly destructively. Thankfully, Snape was able to convince them to just keep trying to contain Draco's magic safely. Informed them, moreover, that dampening potions might make the rest of them safer, but would take away any defence Draco had against the effects of the mark.
Draco took a deep breath. "All right, this is going to be... interesting. Not all of it will make sense, but." He took off his glasses and polished them. "I have to give you a bit of background first." He paused, putting them back on. "And actually, the background is probably going to explain some odd things you may have noticed about certain little... accidents Ben's been having lately."
"Trainee Healer Webster," said the older Healer calmly. "One of the things you need to work on is proper bedside manner with relatives of patients, and one thing that is very clear is that you do not address them in such a tone no matter who they are, even if you believe their question to be a stupid one. Which that one was not. Now, please go and wait for me in my office." He turned to Malfoy, not bothering to see if the startled Trainee Healer had done so. "No, Mr. Malfoy, it is not advisable right now, although we will allow you to record a message to him. I will ask for an aide to bring you a recording scroll."
He had planned on remembering his own pleasure at mastering Unplottable spells, some of the most difficult he had ever attempted. The feeling of his father's rare pride in him, his father's sureness that the family would be in good hands once he passed away. But that probably wouldn't be enough either. The images coming from the other members of the circle all seemed rather more intense than that.
"I still can't believe I like Muggle Scotch more than Icegin. My father would probably eat his own spleen if he heard me say anything like that."
This was one of the last Ember to Ember DVD Extras written, but second in chronological order in the story. It sat like a quivering pile of jelly for many moons, until I got into a Fredless George kick and Fred eventually politely asked to be written not-dead for once. Not sure he'd appreciate the treatment he gets in this ficbit, but still. Undead Not-Dead Fred.
our b-boys?" he asked with a resigned sigh, as he let go of his son and moved to gather up newspapers.
He settled over Harry again, breathing hard, bringing them back to where they'd been when Harry had so rudely interrupted them, panting as they reached for the summit together. Catching his breath at the sight beneath him, Harry's muscles working as his strong body writhed under Draco, he captured Harry's lips and gasped as Harry cried out, a warm wetness covering their stomach and they both came in the middle of a kiss, the brightness of their climax shining on and on, both gasping into each others' mouths and holding each other tightly.
"Oh for fuck's sake, Anne," he snapped, tired of biting his lip till it bled. "Don't bloody well start that shit again!"
This was bad. This was very, very bad, and he needed to do something about it. He needed to find some solution to this "situation", before he was forced to accept any solution from the adults. He needed to find some way of maintaining control over his life.
"I'm not leaving you! God, you're impossible." Draco shook his head in disbelief. "Look, I came back, all right? Just two days ago. Why would I--"
"The colour spell's finally almost gone, isn't it?" Harry said, running a lock of Draco's hair through his fingers, utterly breaking the nascent mood.
This part of an interrogation was always so bloody embarrassing. He'd trained himself to feel comfortable around Muggles, and honestly wasn't a danger to any of them, but he would probably never be able to trust them as much as he trusted wizards and there wasn't much he could do about it. With his upbringing, he reminded himself, just being able consider them human had been a major accomplishment. And there was nothing for it but to just ride out the questions, try not to react to the inevitable glee of Aurors who thought they'd be able to embarrass him with his own involuntary prejudices, and hope it ended soon.
"Generally people don't spend half of their first year married tracking down all sorts of Death Eaters," Harry pointed out. "Or in hiding. It's not that big a deal."
"I remember every child I've ever Sorted," the Hat said firmly. "So, lad. Gryffindor, like your father and your mother?"
Sensible didn't mean easy, though. And while Malfoy seemed fine, Harry was devastated. Hermione hurt for him even as she reminded herself that this was for the best.
"Because I didn't want it to," Draco said, his heart sinking. Oh God, no. No, this was - he couldn't - this was too bloody painful and raw to deal with it with Flint. He pressed down panic, focussing all his will on his answers in a desperate ploy to keep Flint at bay until the others came back-
"He's good at imitations, Finnigan," says Parkinson, pushing Seamus out the door after making sure that the corridor is empty. "Does McGonagall so well you can almost see her glasses quivering on him."
(interview with Draco, done by a reporter with "discreet ties" to the Malfoys (i.e. a well-placed payoff))
They quickly came forward. "Ben's doing well," the elder Healer said. Malfoy and Kara breathed out simultaneously, and Kara reached for Malfoy's hand. "He's responding very well to the counter spells. He's going to be groggy for the next two days or so, and he'll have to stay in isolation, but he'll be fine."
And Draco. Clinging to Draco for strength, barely hanging on until he could see his son again. Finally seeing Alec again, feeling gratitude flooding every fiber of his being at the soft, slow rise and fall of Alec's chest.
"You're not. You need to sleep, eat, and take a shower. And shave," he said, running a finger along Harry's jaw.
"Harry, dear." Hermione looked up to see Molly hurrying towards Harry. Behind her, Arthur, Kara, and Malfoy were entering the waiting room, Kara looking too frightened to be properly aware of the strangeness of the place. Molly hugged Harry, hard, then drew back and looked at him worriedly. "Any news?"
"We call upon male and upon female," Esposito said, and Lucius noted that most of the others had images of parents and spouses. Arthur Weasley, how charming. And he wasn't entirely sure if Weasley Jr. thinking of Granger was more or less distasteful than thinking of his frumpy mother would have been. Though at least she apparently cleaned up rather nicely; that memory had to be from the Yule Ball held during the year of the Triwizard Tournament. Pity about the teeth.
Draco Malfoy's eyesight is not quite as keen as his own, Ron realizes immediately. He can't see the details of the medicine cabinet across the hospital.
It wasn't necessarily a bad thing, he reminded himself. Maybe this could help him stay out of Azkaban. Give him the chance to give the Aurors reasons to trust him.
With a shudder he silenced the voices. Ruthlessly pushed down the threatened tears, the trembling. Grabbed and held on to his Malfoy pride.
"I know what I saw," said one student on condition of anonymity, "Potter punched him in the face, right in the Great Hall. And nobody did anything about it, just sent them off to be alone for four days."
George looked up from the small aqua-blue boy wriggling on his lap and sighed as Fred stepped out of the Floo. He nodded at Demelza, who got up from the couch and picked up the little boy - Graham? Frank? Fred could never tell, and the blue colour didn't help - and started to head off with a small smile at Fred. She paused, frowning, and flicked her wand at him. Fred felt warmth on his face - healing charm, no doubt - as she headed off to her sons' nursery.
And what would happen if Draco came back to find Harry had changed his mind? That he was finally going to listen to the Weasleys, and break it off?
Shite, they were in trouble. Really, really big trouble. Harry wasn't quite sure why, but he'd rarely seen either McGonagall or Pomfrey so angry; though both were often annoyed, they seldom went past that. But now... even Dumbledore looked sombre.
You twit, whispers Malfoy urgently, it's been over for years, and I need you, I need you so fucking badly, it's been years, please, and Malfoy's pleading with him, saying things Harry didn't know he could say, so hungry for him it's making Harry lose all ability to breathe or reason, and he can't quite believe what he's doing, he's lying back on the bed and drawing Malfoy on top of him Don't forget what the Healer talked about, Pomfrey tells Malfoy sternly, you're going to need to prepare a little more than that.
I've finally caught up and am posting on the day of the story, so this will be February's post. Will be catching up on the Ember to Ember DVD Extras in between postings here until it's all done :)
Oh god - how is he supposed to pull this off? Malfoy has always seemed the epitome of arrogance and self-confidence to Neville, since first year. How can Neville mimic that? Malfoy is never nervous, he never feels small or insignificant. Even now, wearing Neville's own homely face and body, and he doesn't look stupid or awkward or shy. Somehow he's pulling this off.
"--hardly appropriate for a shop on Diagon Alley, don't you think?" Molly was saying, and George and Fred laughed.
It was... it was pretty difficult. We had to leave our dorms, move into our own quarters, which was a bit of a shock. Switch a bunch of our classes so we could attend together, and we both had to drop out of Quidditch.
Fred shook his head angrily even as he admired her fire and spirit. Anne was beautiful when she got like this; like fireworks, but far more dangerous and unpredictable. Not for the first time, he briefly wondered what life would've been like if he'd chosen a wife like George's, someone who could be counted on to bring serenity and reason into difficult situations, instead of Anne, who continually forced him into the role of rational peacemaker. Not exactly his forte.
Blaise remembers that as the moment he decided where to cast his vote. Not so much because it was oh so romantic that dear, heroic Harry Potter stood up for his spouse and demanded he be treated with respect, but because Potter's furious involuntary magic shook the beds in the infirmary, put out a couple of candles, shattered a glass vial, and scared the living hell out of the sanctimonious Auror - and Blaise, actually - without Potter even noticing what he was doing.
Draco decided to leave his eyes closed and gratefully remembered that the light was low so that Harry couldn't see his blush. "Mm. You're welcome."
She could've done much worse than bringing into the world a wonderful little boy who loved her, but who seemed to prefer being with his father. The father she'd chosen for him was worth it. And the two of them shared a bond she didn't truly understand, but couldn't deny.
Harry remembers wishing desperately, many times, that he hadn't let Draco re-enter the bond. That they'd waited just a little longer for the Healers to find some way of helping him without putting Draco in danger. He remembers being afraid to ask Draco if he regretted his decision, and rationalizing his own silence as plain common sense, because it didn't matter what Draco did or didn't regret. The decision had been made, and there was no going back.
"It would make more sense from a security perspective," said Bill. "And Alec, I think this was supposed to be something that the grown-ups were going to decide in a bit. It's a big thing, moving in with somebody."
"At home, resting. She said it would be all right if Ben had a sleepover here, as long as you weren't alone. She didn't want to saddle you with an extra sick kid. I'll let her know Molly will be here."
Kara choked on her drink. "Pumpkin juice?" she said, laughing, and caught a quick glance between Harry and Draco. Alec frowned at Draco and jutted out his lower lip at the mess on his plate.
In his condition, Draco wasn't to blame for choosing to trust Esposito more than Lucius' unknown Healers just because those unknown Healers worked for their family. He certainly couldn't be expected to see that Esposito, for all her supposed expertise as a Bonding Spells specialist, was just an old quack with no real backbone, and a disgrace to Slytherin house. As if any self-respecting Slytherin would ever try a solution this stupid when there were perfectly workable alternatives that hadn't even been tested.
Draco snickered. "Not likely; I've a vested interest in some of those vital parts. Besides, there's nothing Gryffindor about being randy and tired of petting."
He wanted it, more than he'd thought possible. It hadn't occurred to him much, before, but now that it had, he wanted it with all his heart. Draco and Ben, living with him and Alec, the four of them forming a real family together. A home for all of them. And not just for the purpose of helping to keep Draco and Ben safe, but to give himself and Alec what he had wanted for Alec when he and Ginny were expecting him. What both Alec and Ben deserved.
"Oh bloody buggering--" Anne bit off a curse as an explosion of multicoloured sparkles suddenly flew off her daughter's head and a loud MOO echoed around the room, and the entire table turned at once to deal with the resultant chaos among all of the children and adults and glasses and plates upended. Harry reflected, as he tried to shield Alec from the random sparkles and bits of pudding flying about, that this was probably the first time he'd ever been grateful to Michelle for causing a commotion at a Weasley dinner.
He could have Draco in his life, for good, going to bed with him every night, waking up with him every morning, making Harry feel so alive, making him feel anything was possible--
"You're awake," murmured Draco, settling into the chair next to him and holding out a tray with two teas and a plate of biscuits. Harry automatically took it, feeling almost awake.
Happily, Alec didn't seem to notice the hovering, much less mind it. Harry smiled as Alec carefully spread jam on his toast; smoothed down Alec's hair and straightened the small glasses Alec now wore, the only possibly permanent aftereffect of the spell damage he'd suffered. The Healers were cautiously optimistic about the chances of Alec's eyesight eventually correcting itself. In the meantime, Alec could see well enough without them, but needed them to see details, such as music on a page.
"Then he might not be a good fit." The Hat seemed to clear its throat. Did the Hat even have a throat? "We're supposed to be thinking about where
"Bloody hell, Finnigan," snaps Parkinson, and Malfoy looks over at them. "We don't have time for a pep talk."
He does look incredible, and Harry's been wanting to touch him for so long, and he's been so hard for so long he's slowly going insane. And the pointy-faced git just sits there, looking like he could just wait for Harry forever. Harry can't help feeling a little angry at him. Maybe it's not fair, but the thing is, Ron's not acting normal. There is no way that Ron should be smiling at Malfoy and clapping him on the back and nudging him over to where Harry's sitting. And there's no way Ron should grin at Harry as if to say, See? I told you this would make you happy. Somewhere pigs are doing aerial cartwheels through hell, and dodging snowballs.
The moment wouldn't stop replaying itself, over and over again, Harry thought wearily as he brushed Alec's fine ginger hair back from his forehead. He watched Alec's chest rise and fall as he slept peacefully in Harry's bed, and marveled at the miracle of it. And thought, for about the hundredth time, that he should really get some sleep himself.
Trina looked rather offended, and Kara bristled. "All she's saying is dinna give up hope," she said. "No need to take her head off about it. There's always hope."
Draco doesn't remember much about one potion they were warned would "probably cause some regression, disorientation, loss of inhibitions," and a string of other side effects. He doesn't remember agreeing to take it, because he didn't. By that point he was in no shape to consent to or refuse any kind of treatment, and Harry was making all medical decisions for him. He does remember that the world lost all its hard edges, and he said quite a lot of things, and Harry was there.
"No, not really," said Draco, once again feeling a small spark of amusement at their baffled expressions.
Robbie's giggling died down fairly quickly. He was evidently still worn out from crying over the prank Michelle had played on him, and it was far past his naptime. Fred smiled down at him as he fell asleep in Fred's arms.
He resumed his path down Harry's stomach, down to his groin and stopped, abruptly a little nervous. Right. Somehow he'd momentarily forgotten exactly what oral sex entailed. This was... he braced himself and made himself ignore the little voice in his head that perked up to tell him he'd never done this before, and that touching another boy with his hands was just a tad different from taking him into his mouth, and what if this was disgusting and what if he wasn't very good at it or-
"I don't know, several of your letters saying so might have tipped me off." Harry shifted closer on the couch and Draco took his mouth in a kiss. Mm, yes, very nice, the sharp taste and scent of Scotch blending with their kisses.
"Harry and Malfoy broke up," Ron said flatly, and George and Fred stopped in their tracks. "About a month ago."
Fred, and the other Weasleys, had accepted Draco being back, for now at least. How thrilled would they all be, though, if they found out that he and Draco were thinking of moving in together?
"Erm, I'm-" he began, and faltered as the adults all looked at him. He swallowed hard. "We... it was just a fight-"
Later. Not right now. Right now was a good time to drink in the relaxed atmosphere, enjoy his Magret de Canard, and appreciate the way that Harry's initial nervousness had melted with the wine and the Braised Veal. Enjoy the way he blushed slightly at Draco's sotto voce suggestions for after-dinner activities, which Draco kept dropping at carefully calculated intervals in their otherwise perfectly socially acceptable conversation.
"Thank god." Draco let his head fall back against the couch as Harry rubbed the back of his neck, apparently trying to comfort him, and succeeding remarkably well.
"Not a problem," said Bill, turning to Draco. "And I'm glad you called me. Gives me a chance to ask again about the Secrecy Charm on your job."
And what if they didn't? What if all of this broke on the front pages of the Prophet, and Ben was targeted, and Draco's own life was exposed, and Harry himself got publicity? Harry hated publicity with a passion, and he would have to face it all without Draco there to help him, and without Draco there to counteract whatever other people said about him, or them. Without Draco there to remind Harry why they were together, despite what anybody else thought, despite what Harry's own family thought-
"Come on." Harry took his hand, and they walked around the flat together. They looked into the kids' room, set up with a bunk bed. The guest room, which could become a bedroom if the boys decided they wanted separate rooms. The living room, dining room, study. The place was a comforting mixture of furniture from both of their flats, though less from Draco's, as his would still need the appearance of being lived in until the school term ended in Dublin. Muggles, having no Floos, would be unable to understand Draco commuting from London to Dublin to teach every day.
Malfoy gazed at Harry worriedly and sat down next to him, a comforting hand on his shoulder, and Hermione watched them as Malfoy murmured to him quietly.
nimue_8: Also, the interaction between Draco and Alec (and Harry and Ben as well!) as the kids are on the mend. How Draco being there and encouraging the kid helps Harry. (A/N: Not sure how much encouraging Draco was doing, but they were interacting... ;) )
"They dinna look anything like each other, Draco," Kara said as soon the little boys were effectively distracted.
"Draco, I really think maybe you should read this," he said slowly. Draco looked up at him expressionlessly, then let go of Alec's hand and switched places with Harry, taking the paper. Harry settled himself down next to Alec, who'd subsided into peaceful sleep a while ago, and let his mind drift again as Draco read.
It felt right. It felt like home, like healing, and it didn't matter what had happened before now, or why Draco had left. He caressed Draco's cheek, noting the roughness of stubble there, holding him close. And it was heaven, feeling Draco breathing against him, drowning in his scent and his warmth, the low hum of his magic caressing Harry's senses.
So that's what white skin looks like from the point of view of the wearer, Dean thinks dazedly as he looks at his own hands and Malfoy and Parkinson exchange a bit of last-minute information. It's startling as hell. Like every time he catches a glimpse of himself, he's surprised. He feels like he's been... highlighted.
"Think of the Malfoys for a moment. D'you think they'd have anything left if every time a Malfoy spouse got fed up, she took half the family fortune?"
"HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the Hat a moment later, and the girl gave her brother an apologetic glance before moving to her new table.
He starts to gag and claps a hand over his mouth to prevent himself from spitting the foul stuff right back up.
This is a DVD Extra for Bongo Monkeys, who said, I would be interested in seeing maybe a one shot, about 6-10 years later, saying what houses the boys were in, how Harry and Draco's relationship has done over the years, and so on.
There were only three groups left in their corner of the waiting room. Two men waiting for news of their uncle, a witch with three grown children, waiting for news of her husband, and Alec's family. Hermione rubbed her eyes and stifled a yawn, glad that Malfoy had finally been able to persuade Harry to try to get some sleep. Harry was moving restlessly in his chair and there was a small line between his eyebrows, and it didn't seem a particularly peaceful slumber, but it was at least better than the endless pacing that had preceded it. Malfoy sat beside him, his own eyelids drooping, and Hermione wondered what was going on inside him. What he thought about what Fred had said. What he was thinking about Alec. About Harry.
Malfoy's started to talk to Harry, dismissing Seamus entirely, and Parkinson tugs on Seamus' sleeve.
"Wondering what the fuck I'm still doing with you, as a matter of fact. Missing the Twins' pranks alone sounds heavenly."
Living together. Waking up together, getting in each other's space. What he'd had with Ginny, with all the joy and frustration, the big and the little - cluttering up each other's washroom counters, casually chatting whenever they wanted, taking each other's presence for granted. Arguments and reconciliations and cooking together and getting Draco's coffee every morning. Draco's music intermingling with Alec's, Ben's art projects strewn about their home. The eventual death of ardent, exciting, unpredictable romance, replaced with comfortable warmth.
"Not the same." Harry tilted his head as Draco's hand moved to the side of his neck. "It's not the same. You're the closest thing Alec has to another parent. He's woken up and seen you with him, and he's smiled because you were there. You've told the Healers not to minimize the hearing issue..."
Malfoy was finally moving, very carefully drawing Harry closer, and Harry tried so hard not to shake, but it was almost impossible. It was too much. Malfoy's breathing was laboured, his eyes clouded and unlike Harry had ever seen them. No mocking or superiority, just knife-edged desire and intense anticipation.
Draco snorted indelicately. "I think I had enough of that last year, what with the Prophet reporting every event and speculation and sneeze from either one of us for most of the year."
Draco closed his eyes, answering mechanically, trying to take himself away. Far away, where it didn't matter that Flint was asking, and Draco answering, all these questions. Draining his memories of their magic. Reducing the thrill and the joy and, yes, the love in them to Flint's idle curiosity, Draco's helpless recitation, and Ellis' mortified witness.
Flint gave a harsh laugh. "The one thing you've done right? He's the half-blood bastard of a poofter exile, who doesn't even live with his mother. If that's not bad enough, I've heard that in the Muggle world being black is almost as bad as a Death Eater or a half-blood in our world. Why should it make any difference what else you do to bugger up his life?"
And then he was lost. Like his first time flying, every emotion so powerful and scary and wonderful and overwhelming.
She narrowed her eyes. "You think I did this?" she asked incredulously, looking back at the picture of Harry and Draco embracing on the cover of the Prophet. "How dare you--"
"Things don't always work out the way we picture them," he pointed out. "I mean... Ginny and I hadn't planned on our wedding being the way it was, but... it was still good." He thought briefly of the frantic last-minute preparations, the considerably shorter guest list than Molly had wanted for her only daughter's marriage, the slight bulge that was Alec in Ginny's middle. "It didn't make our marriage any less valid just because we didn't do it the way we'd planned." Harry cleared his throat, noting that the ache of his too-short marriage was no longer as sharp, somehow, as it had once been. "It was good while we were together. I think it could've been very good in the long run."
Esposito took a deep breath, and allowed them all a few moments to breathe and settle down and take comfort from the wandlight glowing benignly above them all.
This didn't even have anything to do with Harry or Malfoy any more, he was able to think in the brief space between one savage verbal attack and another, both of them holding little back as Anne ripped in to him over his mixed signals to their daughter - the unmistakable admiration he felt for her spirit making it difficult to discipline her - as well as his supposed neglect of their son, and he flung back at her his disgust at her amazing ability to hold on to every grudge and grievance, and her charming Slytherin dishonesty, and her constant whining about missing her Charms work, despite the fact that she'd agreed she'd leave her career on hold while the kids were little, and--
"I'm not hom-" Seamus suddenly remembers himself and lowers his voice as a group of fourth year Ravenclaw girls walk past them, loudly arguing over an Arithmancy exercise. "I'm not homophobic," he says firmly once they're past.
The same vulnerability as Harry Potter. There were no words for how much he loathed that boy. There were no words for his rage and bitterness at his own helplessness, no more control over what was going to happen than the lowest Muggle.
And did a hell of a good job at it, too. "Oh... ooh god..." he breathed, unaware that he'd spoken out loud until he heard and felt a chuckle from Harry, and caught his breath. The effect of the murmuring laugh, while Draco was deep inside Harry's mouth, was dizzying.
"All right." He closed and leaned back against their door, letting Harry run soft lips down his neck. He reached back and untied Harry's hair, enjoying the silky feel of it running through his fingers, black and silver strands tumbling in a wave down Harry's back. He drew in his breath as Harry knelt down, undoing Draco's Muggle trousers, pulling aside the black shirt he'd worn for the concert. There was something incredibly sensual about a lover's hands undressing you. Especially when they were so slow and gentle, so familiar. He groaned as Harry took him into his mouth.
That one was less difficult to misinterpret, and he laughed inwardly at Ron Weasley's instinctive recoil before once more taking control of his thoughts and clearing his mind for the next pairing.
Wait, stop, Draco wanted to ask. Am I going back to Azkaban? For how long? Can I contact my son? What's happened to him? Can I speak to a lawyer? Where's my wand? Did you snap it like you snapped my first wand? Can I contact Harry?
"I'm scared," Harry blurted, wincing but forcing himself to not withdraw. Better to talk about this with Malfoy than with his father.
You're not going to Azkaban. Even if you do, it may not be for long. You Obliviated two people who were being hostile; you didn't start it, you didn't hurt them, you've done nothing wrong other than the Obliviate, and you have Harry on your side.
They could do this pretty well, though. They could certainly communicate to each other every apology and every forgiveness and every longing thought they'd had since they'd broken up. He could show Draco every night he'd wished Draco would say exactly this, every time he'd thought that if Draco came back he'd never let him go again, because this losing loved ones routine was just not on any more, and every moment he'd thanked God that Draco had been there during the accident and afterwards...
Dean gulps as Parkinson gives him a curt nod and he picks up Malfoy's schoolbag, startling himself again with the sight of his blindingly white skin. Parkinson smirks at him and Dean wonders if she just caught him flinching at his own hands.
"That's because the Crown Jewels were kept in the same wing," Bill said. "I told Garpek that it wouldn't work."
Harry's pretty sure he knows what Draco thinks and feels about all of the above. But he's never asked, and probably never will. Some things don't get better when you talk about them, some memories are best left unremembered, and some wounds can only be healed by time.
"She'll be at the Muggle entrance in a few minutes," she told Malfoy as she rejoined the three men. "She was at Windbourne. It's just taking a bit of time to arrange for the Dublin-to-London part of the trip. The Help Desk witch's assistant will tell us when she's arrived at the building; should be any second now. Do you want me to get her?"
Come on, Alec, you can do this, Ben thought as Alec sat down on the stool, his freckles dark against his pale skin. Don't drop anything, don't fall off the stool, don't think about the fact that there's hundreds of people staring at you. Just relax and let the Hat do its job.
"You're being an idiot," Malfoy comments. "You know Weasley and I are both willing to go till tomorrow."
Harry nodded. "I know. But it would also make life a lot easier in a lot of ways." He looked down at the floor. "And I wouldn't mind the difficulty."
"D'you want me to... erm..." Draco began reluctantly, not knowing how he'd return the favour if Harry wanted him to.
Besides, what would happen after that was going to happen anyway. As sure as the sun came up in the morning, as sure as Hermione could be counted on to quote
Neville remembers that during one of the times Malfoy felt relatively fine, he played Dragon Rummy with Neville while Harry slept, exhausted from being up all night. And at one point Malfoy had winced and caught his breath, Neville asked if maybe he should wake up Harry, and Malfoy shook his head impatiently.
He tried to get himself under control again, and suddenly had a vivid image of holding Draco close as he cried after telling Ben about his past, before Draco had gotten himself back together again and pushed Harry away.
"No, Harry, it was not," he said quietly. "If you were still simply classmates, this would merely be yet another example of your mutual hostility, and you would no doubt have earned yourselves several detentions and loss of points or privileges." He paused, his blue eyes deadly serious. "You are spouses. You broke bones and damaged school property. If you hadn't been stopped, you would have hexed one another. This is serious."
They picked up their brooms in silence, and impulsively Harry pulled Draco close for a quick kiss. Draco smiled and tightened his arms around Harry, not letting him go.
"Malfoy," he said, and cursed the unsteadiness of his voice. Malfoy looked up warily, and Harry cleared his throat. "We're in trouble, aren't we?"
Back to class after Christmas. Gryffindors and Slytherins getting along well, Malfoy family doing better, Death Eater activity rising.
It is possible that Potter and Malfoy simply opted to dissolve the involuntary bond but remain together until they decided to go their separate ways or re-bond voluntarily. And while normally it would be premature to speculate on whether wedding bells will ring for any couple that has only been together for a few months, we must remember that these two young men have already experienced a successful marriage. It won't be surprising if they do decide to remarry, this time of their own free will. They would likely have the support of many of our readers who have expressed a fond desire to see them reunite.
Minerva McGonagall, still the same stubborn humorless old bat she had been since Lucius' own schoolboy days.
had joined him, pulling Lucius back too, Lucius inwardly burned with rage at this betrayal, and he could probably fight Severus too except that now Severus was joined by Dumbledore and McGonagall and Parkinson's daughter and Narcissa-
There is now an "Extra" attached to this chapter. It takes place immediately after the chapter, and can be found at
Although, if Fred had talked to Draco, urged him to go back to Harry and apologized for his actions... Harry supposed anything was possible.
Anne spluttered, livid fury making her colour rise even higher. "You have no right!" she shrieked at him. "No bloody right!"
He'd really thought girls would be a good antidote; he'd always liked them before, and they definitely didn't remind him of Harry. But maybe what he needed was another boy to take away memories of Harry. Drive Harry out of his thoughts and fantasies.
"She came earlier, but Alec needed to be put back into sleep again for a treatment, so she took her twins back home. Besides, they were wearing Alec out."
Draco was in the living room as well, staring out the window pensively, and Harry came up behind him and put an arm around his waist, leaning against him. Draco shrugged slightly and Harry let him go.
," Draco said absently. "The parole officer who gave it to me when I explained about Ben couldn't stop smirking about it."
Bill was busily flipping through a ward charm text, Kara had taken the boys to the kitchen for sweets, and Draco was staring at his keyboard, trying to figure out where to put it, when Harry approached him quietly and made himself speak before dwelling on all the reasons he probably shouldn't. "About what I said back there." Draco's body became absolutely still. "You know... Kara wants to move to London. Ben and Alec are going to require a lot of care. I'm worried about you. I know it's soon, but I'm offering."
Harry started to pull back, mortified. "Don't," whispered Draco, tightening his grip. He hesitated, then plunged on. "I'm... a bit of a mess too." He laughed shakily, uncertainly. "D'you think we can put ourselves together? Your mess and mine?" He pulled Harry closer. "I... I love you. I told you, I'm not going anywhere. Not again."
"Longbottom," Malfoy barks at him. "Pull yourself together. You can do this. You were there for Harry in the Department of Mysteries, you can do this for him now." Malfoy's voice is hard and uncompromising, but there's not a hint of contempt or condescension in it, and that shocks Neville into silence. "You are not going to let him down now; you never have." Neville takes a deep breath, firmly pushing down his hysterics as Malfoy goes on. "He told you once that you were worth ten of me. Now fucking well prove it!"
"Ben's certainly made himself a place among them, hasn't he?" Hermione said a while later, smiling at the unbelievably filthy horde of glue-covered children in the backyard. Arthur was sitting among them, surrounded by misshapen papier mache animals and grinning like some demented glue elemental, soggy newspaper stuck to him in the oddest places, culminating in a tower on top of his head. Molly stood horrified at the back door.
"Good for you, Laurence!" she shouted, and the boy moved nervously towards the Ravenclaw table. There was a pause as a small house-elf appeared and tugged on the sleeve of the professor in charge of the first years.
"It... it would make sense," Harry said nervously. He swallowed and tried for a more casual tone. "For warding, at least." Ugh, too casual. This was about making a major life change, not choosing a new pair of socks.
He fought back the thought being away from Ben for a month. Two months. Six. A year. Missing irreplaceable time from his son's life. Coming out to find that Ben didn't need Draco any more, that he'd been replaced, that Draco didn't know what books Ben liked or what his teachers thought of him or what food he'd become fond of or what Ben's favourite show on the telly was-
Harry remembers Draco pulling him close at one point, possibly on the third day, kissing him and fumbling with his jumper. He remembers Draco choking out, "Blow me, fuck me, I don't care which, just - God, give me something else to think about," and he remembers not hesitating before portkeying them both to their bedroom, not even bothering to say anything to Ron and the two startled Aurors who were with them in their sitting room, slamming the door shut with wandless magic, grabbing Draco and pushing him back onto the bed and proceeding to do anything and everything Draco wanted him to do. He remembers how Draco was in pain through the whole thing, how rough they were with each other, how Draco didn't even bother to prepare him before shoving into him, how much it hurt and how little he cared, as he urged Draco on. How good it felt to be with Draco even for a few moments while Draco had something else on his mind other than pain.
None of them remember the last time the torment stopped, because it had stopped so many times. Stopped, only to return again, and in some ways the return was worse for the respite. Draco remembers just closing his eyes and going to sleep, knowing he'd be awakened when it began again. He thinks he was in the Gryffindor common room.
A sniveling child, hiding in the dark, Longbottom no doubt, and Lucius' lip curled in a sneer. Except... no, the child was - his heart gave a lurch.
"Poppy!" McGonagall called out, and Pomfrey looked up from the scroll she was writing on and blanched at the sight before her.
"Here, let me get that for you," Harry said, taking Ben's roll and the jam. "Little boys and jam," he said to Trina. "Bit of a mess if you leave them alone together."
Draco shrugged. "Better now than later." He left the room, and Kara wandered numbly back to her kitchen, gazed at her dirty dishes and wished she could do magic too. Magic to make this better, take away the pain Ben was going to feel... or at least make Draco see that he was wrong.
"You showed more bravery than any of those people thought you could. That's why they changed their minds about you. It has nothing to do with whether or not you were directly responsible for saving anybody's life."
"Yes," Malfoy said. "Yes, that would be good. I'm not sure where she is right now.... probably at Windbourne records. Erm..." he blinked, frowning slightly.
"That kid! Is that kid more important to you than Alec? Than Ginny? Do you even remember what you swore to him the day he was born?"
Draco's mobile phone rang, and he gave them all an apologetic glance and went to take the call in the living room.
"But I was saving the chips till the end and now they've gone all soggy!" said Alec, glaring at Ben.
"She dated me," Cornfoot shrugged. "I think we were both hoping we could still, you know, marry, provide pureblood children to our families, that sort of thing."
"You know," said Anne, "it's not exactly kind of you to get this amused when George is dealing with their mischief."
"All right," said Auror One to Flint. "Shacklebolt says we can continue the questioning, but everybody's to get a Confidentum spell after we're done."
"Well, I can't help you on the breasts part of it, and romance between two men isn't the same," Draco admitted. "But it does exist."
"That wasn't Tonk's fault, you know that. The spell usually only lasts one month. She'd done it before to other people being hidden by the Order."
Fred nodded. Business as usual; whether she agreed with Anne or not, "Wives of twins need to stick together," Demelza always said, and maybe it was true. Fred even knew what she'd likely write, having seen her notes before:
Draco smiled, amused at how Harry, now perfectly at ease with sex in general, still reverted to shy awkwardness whenever something new came up. "Yeah, plenty of times."
"It's a wizarding building. Might support expansion spells. And if it doesn't, I'd be willing to move."
Narcissa was out, and he couldn't meet her eyes. She would never forgive him. Oh, she would say she did - she was as well-versed as he in diplomacy, manners, and surface niceties. But down in the heart of their bond, where it mattered, she would never forget and she would never forgive.
"This... the expensive dinner, the Time Turner - I'm really, erm, touched that you did this, but I wasn't - that wasn't what I meant yesterday when I asked - I mean, I don't need-"
Whether Malfoy's family will echo the support of Prophet readers is difficult to tell. Convicted Death Eater Lucius Malfoy, father of Draco Malfoy, who was shown these pictures prior to their publication, appeared shocked but had no comment about his son's renewed romantic relationship with Potter. At the time of the divorce, Lucius Malfoy expressed a desire to see his son's "friendship" with Potter continue, but clearly seemed to expect it to remain a friendship and nothing more.
"Mm. Suppose so..." Harry ran his fingers through Draco's hair and slowly moved his lips down the side of Draco's neck and behind his ear, pressing closer, half on top of him now, and Draco thought vaguely that, sweat-damp and sticky as they both were, this should have felt awkward or faintly disgusting. But it didn't. It felt right. More than right, as a matter of fact - more like bloody brilliant, and his body was beginning to let him know just how brilliant. Amazing, what a bond could do.
Harry nodded, and opened the freezer door, feeling a bit foolish as he took a handful of the powder. He glanced back at Ron, a grin coming back to his face as he called out Draco's Floo address. And the last thing he saw as the green flames whirled him away was the parchment in Ron's hand, with its single message from Draco.
Which was all right, he told himself. This was one of the only good things about the bond. He could certainly take advantage of Malfoy's clearer head over this part of their dilemma, if it helped him feel steadier and helped them work together.
"To give me some potion or something to - to make me not fight this any more," Harry felt his face heating and turned away.
"What?" Draco asked, squinting at his Shrivelfig and trying to decide whether he needed to order more.
Bloody hell, this was not the way he'd wanted this discussion to go. He hadn't thought about taking this step before - much - but when he had, he'd thought about taking Draco to a nice restaurant, slipping the idea of moving in together into the conversation, seeing how it went, giving themselves some sort of vague timeline for making the decision... Something slow. And pleasant, and romantic.
"He's already answered a great many things that I'm sure he would've kept quiet about if he could have," said Auror One.
Dean had wanted to tell her about the Polyjuice Squad, because it really didn't seem right to participate in something like this and not tell her, but he was outvoted by the others. Dean doesn't blame them; Tracey's a Slytherin, Dean hasn't been dating her that long, this is deadly serious and there's no urgent need for her to know... but it still feels wrong to keep it from her. She's nothing like what Dean always thought Slytherins were like. She seems aloof and cynical from the outside, but in private she's warm and caring and things have been getting serious between them and it's just not right, that Dean should go around impersonating one of her own housemates without even letting her know. It's even less right that he allow one of her housemates to impersonate him without telling her.
Pansy scooted a seat up, fingers lightly waving in the direction of a new potential pull of the evening, and Draco sighed.
Harry only watched as the conversation moved in a different direction as Draco went on, speaking on the new law the Ministry just enacted with an air of distaste as he read from the
As Harry spouted on, explaining the dos and don’ts of the particular statute they have in place, and the many updates that could be done to improve the lives of house-elves; Harry felt Draco’s hands move upward ever so slightly, running light fingers around his ankles and now massaging his calves.
“Yes, I see how you are. All about yourself,” Draco teased. “But no, he and I are good, I think. I told him about this French Quidditch player I know who is newly single. That piqued his interest.”
He watched as Potter breathed out a long breath, and bit his lip, considering the man hovering over him. “You might as well stay. Even if this was a huge accident, might as well have some fun while you’re here?”
When Harry was able to catch his own breath finally, he peeked through and saw Malfoy still tugging on his cock; the end of his orgasm must’ve lasted longer than usual this go-around. He looked like he was currently attempting to inhale as much air as he possibly could; the steam must have got to him this time as well.
“I’m sure he did,” Harry muttered indignantly under his breath as he placed the items on the counter to get rung up.
That was enough permission for Harry then, as he dove down and nosed Draco’s trousers, sucking lightly on his already leaking erection popping through his jeans.
It was a hole, and by the looks of it, it went straight through to the other side, into the other room, and Harry grinned in triumph.
It took Harry a second to catch on to what she meant but then sighed, realizing he had forgotten all about the history book he stowed in his suitcase at the end of his bed.
Harry had a pained look on his face as he tried to convey to Ron that he didn't need any vacation and that he was perfectly fine, but of course, Ron just stood up from his spot at the table and pecked his wife on the cheek.
Malfoy’s shocked face should have come as no surprise to him, but it was still nerve-wracking nonetheless. Forget the people watching; it was the man he was singing with himself that made Harry want to curl into a ball.
He managed to get his mind off of the task at hand and those talented hands on his back for a little bit, thinking about the latest Quidditch scores right as Malfoy’s hands reached down into the dip of his back.
I would ever be infatuated with the Chosen One! Don’t make me vomit. I only forced you to come up to my dorm because I didn’t want to face being around your filth in your Merlin knows how disgusting room!”
Smith then dived into some more of the rather nasty looking cheesy chips the bar sold. Harry thought he had seen the bartender take the cheese from underneath the bar before drowning said chips in them, then putting it back on the ground.
Draco ran his long fingers through Harry’s ragged hair a few times before pulling on the strands as Harry involuntarily pressed his hips down into
Harry spent the rest of his day in his room in proper form, moping about until sleep finally got him.
Potter turned around at that, his eyes bright behind his glasses widened in shock when he recognized him.
Hiding a smirk, he grasped his wand from his holster and cleaned them both with a quick wave of his wand.
He opened his mouth to ask Malfoy if he thought he had changed, his curiosity getting the better of him like always when Malfoy cleared his throat, and Harry coughed instead.
He peered down at the book in question and groaned; it had to be upwards of 900+ pages. He read the title:
"It'll be okay, Harry." Ron patted Harry's shoulder as ornaments whizzed and spun all around them. "Bill's sorry he can't come himself, but he swears he's sending the best cursebreaker he has."
Both of Draco’s brows raised at the promptness but he nodded slowly, his eyes tracking over the body below him, taking in every single piece of him, not knowing if he would ever get this chance ever again.
Malfoy groused something about him not being a good enough excuse to pop out his favorite whiskey on the way over but didn’t say no, so Harry considered it a success.
Draco intentionally loosened his tie even more from when he did earlier when he was overheating. That was nothing compared to how he felt now, with Potter’s hot gaze glued to him.
Before he could decline, Hermione was already searching through that sodding bag of hers, humming as she searched for the particular potion.
Harry grasped him by the back of his head and pushed up, lips catching his to stop his incessant droning.
When Draco came to, he gazed down at Harry with a look of pure awe and other emotions swirling in his eyes that Harry had no idea how to process.
“Oh! That would be the nargles. I knew they would show up,” Luna replied with a dreamy expression on her face that didn’t quite equal the feeling of confusion in the air as everyone in the room stared at her with looks of bewilderment and frustration alike.
, he was either on page 3, smiling with youngsters, as it spoke of him donating large sums to orphanages nationwide. Or pasted on the front page, him and some new pull of the month hand in hand at some Ministry function or another.
And that was almost enough of a reason for him to forget this night ever occurred and make his way back to bed.
Happier than even the glimpses he got at Luna’s parties recently, and for some reason that made Harry happy.
The man strode up quickly towards Draco as he stood his ground, eyeing him with discontent, “I could ask you the same question.” Draco felt relief when his fingers circled his wand under his robes.
He could have sworn he heard Ron muttering under his breath to Hermione about oblivious wankers, but wasn’t sure, as Harry was still watching Malfoy out of the corner of his eye as he stirred the potion.
Malfoy must have made his way back over, as Harry looked across the bar and watched as Malfoy eyed the bartender with an air of distrust.
The stage version of the Slytherin was unyielding with a different kind of power that could bring men and women to their knees.
Draco just huffed and rolled his eyes at the display before going back to his readings on the proper way to brew Alihotsy Draught when he heard it.
“Yes! Oh god, yes - yes.” Harry kept up his babbling, and Draco groaned in reply, his hips thrusting forwards into him faster, chasing his own completion and knowing he wasn’t going to last.
Draco watched as his boyfriend settled into his seat and wondered how it was possible that this man chose him of all people in the world to be with and spend every day with?
“It won’t allow you to leave or touch anyone until the two chosen participants kiss,” Luna affirmed.
Instead of responding with words, he twisted his head to the side, showing more of his neck, and grasped at Malfoy’s hold on him, pushing up against his touch, practically humping the air above him.
He knew it was most likely because he hadn’t wanked in about a week since he had been too busy with Typhon and his and Malfoy’s potion assignment.
He rolled over onto his back, thankful for the separate rooms all the eighth years had this year and pulled his pants down over his already leaking cock.
Harry must’ve realized this, as he sunk back down onto the bed with a cry of defeat, Draco still pistoning the toy in and out of him. His boyfriend always was a sucker for torture, and apparently, his mind wanted to torture him for a bit longer and then give him what he needed.
Sometimes, Hermione noticed and threatened to hex him if he didn’t stop it and pay attention during lessons.
After Draco met with George one afternoon at WX3 (their newest line of sexy products), they could replicate precisely what it was Harry was feeling into the toy. So anything he wanted, he would get.
Draco looked down at him one last time, the flush on his skin, his mouth wet and red from biting his lips and couldn’t hold it back any longer.
Seeing as Draco had Justin in his life, well, that made things a tad more complicated. Every time he asked him to come over and hang out for a bit, the blond always had some flimsy excuse that always included his boyfriend.
Malfoy motioned to the left, where Pansy was standing by the music contraption. She raised one brow back in understanding, and with one short nod, the music started.
As a matter of fact, he looked downright territorial and unabashedly furious at Draco after that small moment and dragged Potter off to some dark alcove, and that was the last Draco saw of them that night.
Like after a heavy rainstorm, the smell of trees assaulted his senses, along with the familiar scent of the delicate sweetness of treacle tart.
Harry scrunched his eyebrows in confusion, a tad weirded out at how nonchalant Malfoy was being after calling out his name during orgasm.
He took a deep breath to get his wits about him, and for a split second, his conscience told him not to enter the parted doorway, that he’d be better off mentally without it.
Even if she had tried, the girl in question couldn’t have seemed more thrilled that Harry had even looked at her, let alone spoken words directed to her in particular.
Mentally though, Harry was more than ready for a long soak, a nice glass of firewhiskey, and twelve hours of sleep.
Malfoy was staring his way with an arched eyebrow, and for some reason, Harry had a feeling that he had been watching him since he came through the entrance.
At work, there was always something too. A new case or issue arose each time, and Harry could never find the right occasion to bring it up.
The letter in question had been haphazardly dropped on his dining room table by a tawny owl in the middle of breakfast one bright Sunday morning, with nothing written on the black envelope.
Harry was met with the sight of one enraged Pansy Parkinson right below him, arms crossed, her manicured nails tapping incessantly at his elbow.
Biting his lip, Harry took a long sip from his coffee cup as he stared across the table at Draco. And Draco could swear he could feel his heart tear apart at the seams just from the deadly silence alone.
Harry’s mouth softening around a soundless O, his eyes went sightless, and his mouth opening soundlessly around the silent cry of pleasure he managed to hold back.
All of his breath left him in a whoosh as the plug finally entered him, and Malfoy played with it, pulling it out a bit, teasing him with it until he pressed it back inside, the toy barely nudging against his prostate, not quite where he needed it the most.
Ginny was an obvious no. If Harry were to even think of asking her if she was Typhon, she would hex him so hard with the worst Bat-Bogey he could imagine.
The green-eyed git looked up at him, pink-cheeked, wide-eyed and confused, his hair in even more of disarray than usual. “Huh?”
“Malfoy. You can follow me, erm, if you want.” Potter just turned away, muttered the password, and walked through the portrait hole, obviously expecting Draco to follow.
Harry smirked at that before raising both arms and wrapping them around his taller boyfriend, looking him directly in the eyes.
His mind was stuck on the Malfoy from last weekend, all free and wild, uninhibited on the stage. His tight leather trousers and the way they seemed to have been painted over his -
It was nothing against him, per se. It was just the simple fact that in life: there were some people that you just simply don’t get along with.
His eyes found the slender man at one of the front tables in class, as he was meticulously chopping his ingredients, the knife shining against the low light of the classroom, his fingers delicately moving the chopped ingredients into neat piles.
It probably didn’t help his mood that the past few lyrics he had received had been on the more morose side. It made Harry want to just lie on the Quidditch pitch and stare up at the sky, contemplating life’s very existence while the musical chords reigned in his ears as he took notes on the side in his notebook, pondering who Typhon could be.
Draco loosened his grip and began to move his arm away. Harry and his Seeker reflexes caught him before he could escape, however, and brought his arm back around him with a sigh.
His brain helpfully provided a few other ways that he could get a sore throat that wouldn’t be so terrible with Malfoy’s help, and he choked on his saliva, tuning out those thoughts to the best of his ability.
Last year, the sex toy was the icing on top of a rather dreadful and embarrassing cake full of pining and unanswered questions.
Watching Harry pulse around the dildo as he came was almost enough to push him over the edge himself.
Harry pursed his lips, eyeing the floating paper as if it was seconds away from exploding into everyone's faces. “What is it?”
In the middle of the room was the man of the hour, wholly nude and laid out, bound completely, and face up on a bench of sorts that couldn’t have been comfortable. Especially with the way his legs were pulled taut apart, tied up by what had to have been magical ropes by the way Draco could see them shimmering from a distance.
Rather than his usual prattish demeanor, Malfoy seemed much more at ease this semester. Calmer. Less likely to poison or
But Harry certainly wasn’t complaining; after all, he had Draco’s six-hundred thread sheets to (moan) sleep into tonight.
“Perhaps we should take this conversation elsewhere?” Draco nodded to their surroundings, and Harry noticed a few side-eyes from several patrons and nodded in agreement.
"I hope so," Harry said, as he ducked to avoid another flying ornament. "This is getting out of hand."
He spent a good chunk of the day on Wednesday doing exactly that until a quaffle smacked him upside the head thanks to an unassuming third year practicing their technique.  Rather poorly in his opinion.
He sat atop his face, and Harry closed his eyes immediately, breathing in deeply as if this was the last time he would get to have this.
McGonagall and some of the other professors thought it a good idea to give out Muggle-type phones to all the students this year to help facilitate a new hands-on learning process for the students and bridge the gap between the Muggle and Wizarding world.
He figured he was already pushing Malfoy’s patience as it was. He knew how desperately Malfoy himself was craving a glass of whiskey, and knowing the prat, he will wait till Harry is out of the shower to open the bottle.
Harry managed to look a tad guilty at that. Right at that moment, Ron came back into the kitchen, eyeing them both with his particular brand of exhaustion. “Leave the poor bloke alone, Hermione. You’ve been badgering him about this for two years straight now.”
Malfoy straightened in the water, eyes staying stuck to Harry as he moved even closer, and Harry didn’t realize how close to the edge of the pool they were until his back hit the concrete wall.
The urge to come back down later hit Harry, if only he knew the other man’s schedule when he got off from work. It had been a while since he had pulled anyone, and he wouldn’t mind some extra company tonight.
Potter nodded, his eyes hooded, and Draco swallowed heavily, tongue swiping his bottom lip as he stared the other man down.
Even in the dim light of the bar, Harry could see as Smith’s face lost most of its color, his eyes widening in shock. He obviously wasn’t expecting the Chosen One to take up for an ex-Death Eater.
"Perhaps then you scared them off?" Iain asked through gritted teeth, eyes staring daggers down at Malfoy, and Harry nudged him in the arm.
A few hours into the party found Harry standing awfully close to the drinks, eyeing the attendees of the party as he drank glass after glass of some concoction that Charlie brought with him, swearing that there was some sort of Dragon substance that made it glitter.
Luna’s party rolled around like clockwork that year, and of course, Harry wasn’t prepared in the slightest for it on Christmas Eve. He found himself lying in bed, contemplating his life choices and wondering if he should even bother showing up.
himself, Draco knew he would still have the memories stored in his Pensieve in his bedroom, as that was the first thing Draco did when he left that night.
“I wouldn’t put it past you.” Draco thought for a moment, even placing a finger on his chin in mock consideration, “Well, you are a
“Fuck - oh, I’m going to come!” he cried out, not realizing his voice had gone back to its familiar timbre. Potter raised his head as much as he could from being pounded into, his head tilted as Draco froze, coming inside him, pulsing for what seemed like an eternity.
“Erm, brilliant. Listen - I was wondering if you had sent me any songs this year. I have some lyrics written up.” He tried to hide his blush because when Seamus had found out that Harry had been keeping the lyrics he related to the most from his songs in a journal, he'd thrown a fit and screamed about it for days on end.
He felt Draco’s cock brush up against his prostate with each plunge, and Harry didn’t know if he wanted to murder his boyfriend with a knife or kiss him until his lungs gave out. Unfortunately, neither was an option, as he tried his damndest to pull a neutral face to the meeting’s participants before him, but looking at Ron’s quirked eyebrow, he wasn’t doing a great job of it.
He set up his little beach chair and lay down once again, practicing the breathing exercises his therapist taught him.
He could feel himself growing harder, and the need to come hit him like a bludger to the stomach, except much more enjoyable.
too long for him, as he made another embarrassing groan that was about two pitches higher than his actual voice.
Then like a bludger to the head, the realization of where they were hit him. “Salazar’s bollocks, Harry...what you do to me…”
He had managed to get Hermione to help with researching for a bit, to Ron’s exasperation, investigating as much as she could on the name. At one point, Hermione had a look of pure exasperation on her face as she sat across from him.
Draco wasn’t deterred, as he delicately opened it, after casting a few charms to ensure there was no foul play afoot, and read it through a total of twenty-seven times before he had to get up and migrate from the Earl Grey he had previously been sipping on to some of Odgen’s oldest firewhiskey batch. He didn’t care that it was ten o’clock in the morning.
Rodrick recognized him and raised an eyebrow but greeted him all the same as he ordered a rum and coke, staring down at the beach where Malfoy was causing the young boy to giggle at something he said.
Seamus was harder to convince - considering the previous night, he and Dean had decided to pull out the bottle of firewhiskey they kept for special occasions and took it upon themselves to down the whole thing.
Harry could only nod his head frantically, moaning loudly, and Malfoy grabbed him by the throat, his voice gravelly, “Answer me, then you can come.” He then grabbed the base of his leaking cock, and Harry sobbed.
He remembered going home that Christmas, telling his parents about his revelation. Well, suffice to say it went over as well as he expected it to, and he spent the rest of his holiday at the Parkinson’s Estate.
Draco stiffened, even though he knew it was coming. He had gotten worse at hiding his emotions since being with Harry, the sodding Gryffindor, and his sentiments.
Dean managed to transfigure an old tattered book into an old ragged...piece of wood set up by one of the outer Hogwarts walls. Harry added some stone steps and charmed the wood to hover off the ground a few feet.
Malfoy stripped himself of his swim trunks, giving Harry a perfect view of his perfect body before he then surged forward. He leaned over before him, mouth beside his ear, “I'll give you two options: do you want my fingers in your arse? Or do you want this plug pushed in with no prep?”
Harry wasn’t paying them much mind, as he looked up from his butterbeer, watching Malfoy levitate a plate full of multi-colored shots to another table where his Slytherin comrades were waiting.
Harry was legitimately surprised that this was the first time he noticed it since he had been in there at least ten minutes since he started his shampoo massage. Goes to show how exhausted he was from the long day.
The inside of the resort toed the line between incredibly extravagant yet cozy simultaneously; an array of blues and greens covered the space where folks could sit and wait for the hotel staff to finish finalizing their reservations, while others could sit at a snazzy bar located around the corner.
"I'm telling you, Hermione, it's out to get me." Harry poured two cups of tea and passed one across the kitchen table.
But before Malfoy could respond further, Roddy started in, "Harry, my man, you don't have to worry about that. Draco here just likes to flirt with me. He knows I'm not his type. And vice versa." The bartender then eyed Harry up and down like he did the first day, "There are a few others here like might fit that category, however..."
After the Gryffindors had all (mostly drunkenly) made it back before curfew, Harry lay in his bed, his thumb tapping impatiently on his phone as he fell asleep, waiting for a new song to appear.
He must have just shagged someone, that explains the whole outfit tonight, and at that realization, Harry felt disappointed. Surely he wouldn’t be in the mood for some solo time tonight then.
"You wanna come on my cock?” Malfoy asked, his voice raspy and full of tension, and even in his delirious state of mind, Harry knew Malfoy wasn’t far off from finishing himself.
Complaints that quickly turned to soft moans, as Harry took more of him into his mouth. He slowly moved back and forth, each time getting the tip of his cock further into his mouth and closer to the back of his throat as his eyelashes fluttered shut at the feeling.
But instead, he forcibly pushed himself back into his seat again, wincing slightly at the stickiness, not even noticing how he had been practically dry humping his desk before, and a wave of embarrassment overtook him. He absolutely knew his face was as red as the Weasel’s hair by this point, and he was desperately going through any escapes he could manage, when --
Harry scoffed, digging his fork into a poor clump of spinach a tad too harshly and cracking the plate with it.
Harry somehow managed to wriggle off the shorts without the help of his hands, he felt another wave of arousal hit him as well in embarrassment as he shuffled his arse around enough to slide the trunks off most of the way.
He should just turn back around and finish up cleaning the rest of his body so he can get out and enjoy some old Ogden’s with his friend.
Harry wasn’t quite sure what was going to happen, and he had a sudden chill of embarrassment for Malfoy who hadn’t even begun singing!
He always made the trips with him to the stores, just to hear for himself the catch in Harry’s breath and the darkening of his eyes each time they walked past the line of dildos.
The smells of the soaps Malfoy used were also incredible. It immediately made Harry want to snuggle up with the man with a hot cup of cocoa by the common room fire, inhaling his spicy and fruity aroma.
Monday came around quickly, and though Harry still didn’t want to admit it to himself, he had grown quite fond of his time with Malfoy. Knowing it was coming to an end was a bit sad.
He rubbed a thumb over his knuckles, and he slowly felt the frustration ebb away from his boyfriend, as he felt him take a deep breath and release it.
Harry watched as he pulled his cock almost all the way out of the toy and slammed it back in on a low groan, eyes staring down at the see-through material, desperately hoping the wet sounds couldn’t carry outside of the bathroom to his current house-mate who was probably still stewing away, jotting down notes about their case, and waiting for him to come back to help.
“Later, I will explain to you proper BDSM protocols, but for now, all I want you to do for the remainder of the night is to say your pathetic ex’s name anytime you want me to stop. Does that sounds reasonable?”
“That’s not how Seer’s work, Ronald. I’ve told you this before,” Pansy answered dryly, taking her hand from her boyfriend’s back as she grabbed her shiny purse from the back of her seat where it hung.
Ever since that encounter in the bathroom at the beginning of this year, the taller boy had known something was off with Malfoy. He'd been suspicious, at first, and angry, memories of Sixth Year flooding to the forefront of his mind as he watched the other boy sullenly make his way through classes and nibble at his meals. Hermione kept telling him to leave it alone, let the Aurors handle it for once, but Harry just couldn't shake the feeling for the past few weeks that something was wrong. He'd just never considered that the person in danger would be Malfoy himself.
The last time he'd awoken to unfamiliar surroundings had been the week before his trial, when he'd blinked his eyes open to find the dark stone ceiling of the Ministry holding cells and a throbbing ache behind his eyes. This wasn't the Ministry, but that did nothing to ease his fears. Had someone finally decided to give him the punishment he'd so narrowly avoided earlier that year? He scrambled backwards on the bed until his back struck a wall, heart hammering in his chest. His blurred vision caught sight of a tall figure looming at the other side of the bed, their arms extended towards him, and he panicked. They were going to torture him. He couldn't - he couldn't take that; not again, not after the Dark Lord
Potter halted, but only tightened his grip as the blonde continued to struggle. "What is it, Malfoy?" he sighed.
"You're ill." Potter's voice was loud and clear in the quiet hall, tinged with an almost accusatory tone.
Black spots began to swim across Draco's vision, and he felt his grip on the Saviour's robes slowly slacken before his entire body eventually began to droop in Potter's hold.
"Why do you care?" the blonde mumbled dazedly, and then winced as he realized what he'd said. He steeled himself for the moment when the other man would finally remember just
"ixch! tsh! kch! ksh! tsh!" The desperate bursts spilled mercilessly from him with barely any time to draw breath in between, and he gasped for air when the fit was finally over, head falling back against the wall as he fought to keep his breathing under control - the last thing he needed at this point was a coughing fit.
Draco sighed, sagging back against the wall and closing his eyes as shivers continued wracking his body as aftereffects of the fading panic attack. He didn't know how long he remained like that, gentle waves of magic continuing to pulse from the touch on his chest and neck, but when he finally gathered the strength to look up again, he found himself face-to-face with one Harry Potter. At least he wasn't surprised, this time.
Draco took the offering, sipping carefully at the cool liquid. Severus would be appalled at Draco's failure to check it wasn't poisoned, but at this point he couldn't really be bothered to care. He just wanted to sleep.
ended well for either party. As the other man continued to sob and whimper before him, though, Harry knew he had to do
breathing down his neck without succumbing to the roiling waves of fear washing through him. Alas, he supposed Occlumency shields could only get you so far, and the constant glares and hexes flung at him in the halls had him spiraling down into a sobbing, hyperventilating mess more often than he cared to admit.
The blonde spluttered, face flushing a darkly as he shoved hard against Potter's chest (the arsehole didn't even budge). "I fucking do not," he grumbled, and Potter just chuckled, readjusting his grip around Draco before continuing their walk down the abandoned corridor.
Everything was too bright. And cold - so very, very cold. Ever since Potter had helped him back to his room the other day, Draco had been feeling exceptionally off-kilter. His fever had spiked, pushing him into a vicious cycle of alternating chills and hot flashes; his head ached constantly, and the prickling shivers that raced through his body were so closely reminiscent of the Cruciatus Curse that he'd had no less than five panic attacks in the past three days. To top it all off, that Seventh Year Ravenclaw wouldn't stop hexing him, the bruises and welts she caused only adding to the pain that raged through his body. He'd taken to cutting through abandoned wings of the castle in an attempt to avoid her between classes. The memories provided by those dusty corridors were harsh, but he was desperate.
“Ah ah, hush now. I’ve got you.” Malfoy stood up then, sauntering over to Harry’s suitcase that was still lying on the floor, wide open. He hummed to himself, busying himself with going through his things, as Harry lifted his head up as much as he could to watch.
He’d have to thank Ron for this year at Christmas, but this time he had a feeling Draco would be right next to him all the while.
Draco then moved his left thigh upwards, removing his weight from the man below and acting as though he was leaving, and he heard Potter’s small, barely audible whimper and smirked.
It was slightly awkward, as he was on his hands and knees, his view was beneath everyone else at the table. Hermione, who had been greeting everyone, noticed this and charmed the table back a bit so Harry could have a good view of everyone in attendance. He smiled in thanks as he pulled his arms through, along with his notepad and quill.
Maybe this was why Draco was showering this late at night. He needed to get away from everyone to let go and make whatever sounds he wanted when bringing himself off.
Walking further into the room, he noticed there were Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws in the midst as well, and to his surprise, there was even a group of Slytherins. They were eyeing the ruckus with varying levels of interest/concern/hilarity from the corner.
But then again, this might be the first year where he can have a good time, and be outrageous and fun, and a little immature for the first time in his life.
“Ah, ah, ah Draco, my love. Not today. I cannot have you and your ministrations messing me up on one of the busiest days of the year.” the dark-skinned, burly bartender reprimanded Draco as he shook two mixed drinks at once like he did earlier with Harry, his biceps jiggling with the movements in the same way as before.
A few seconds and Harry was thinking back to Draco, wondering if he bought all of the silk scarves Switzerland offered on his shopping outing, as Harry had noticed his recent penchant for them.
Harry’s eyes widened, and he felt an overwhelming sense of need thrum through his body, wanting nothing more than for Malfoy to take complete charge over him. “I want it,
His jaw ticked in annoyance before blowing out a long breath and turning back to his reading once more. He thought to himself how it wouldn’t hurt Potter to get a haircut, the brute. It was currently getting long enough that it curled around down his ears, close to reaching his neck in the back.
Harry bit his lip, hoping he didn’t sound too enthusiastic and that he came across as just wanting to be done with this assignment once and for all.
A wave of admiration towards the other man hit him because he was able to stay on top of all his classes and still have what seemed like a stable social life.
Not that it mattered, because he knew he was already close to the edge, watching Malfoy as the steaming water fell onto his chest in ringlets, down the drain. He cursed internally at the sight of Malfoy rubbing his thumb to his cockhead similar to before, a low groan emitting from his wet, reddened lips.
“Are you trying to kill me, Potter?” Malfoy drawled as he eyed the man before him with a particular glint in his eyes, “Do you know how sexy you look in those trousers. I bet it took you ages to get them on before coming out here.”
“How eloquent.” Potter grinned for the first time that night, and Draco had to hold himself back from launching himself at the shorter man.
Draco reached up and grasped his hands to Potter’s flushed face, and kissed him deeply, their bodies flush together.
, Potty’s feelings are hurt. How awful. Should I send for Headmistress McGonagall to wipe your tears for you? Surely she’ll have a tissue worthy of The Boy Who Lived.”
The chill of the winter wind blew harshly against Draco’s face, and he shivered minutely, escaping his hands from his pockets only to raise his scarf to cover his nose before moving to hide them back inside his coat.
The two were seated at a table by the window. Silence quickly permeated the air; the only sounds coming from the light conversations from other tables. Harry tried desperately not to twitch in his seat to no avail. He blamed it on his sunburn.
Harry huffed out a laugh at that, but Draco raised a brow at the clear blush darkening his cheeks, his cock leaking more than before at the idea.
"I think putting the rug back in order would go a long way of showing the house that you respect it and its ancestors."
It all suddenly came together in Harry’s mind, Hermione’s earlier explanation and Luna’s description of what was happening. And he truly wanted the ground to swallow him whole at that moment.
Kreacher bowed to Harry and clicked his fingers. The Oriental rug wriggled a bit, then flattened into place as if nobody had ever tripped over it.
Harry huffed in amusement before a particular thrust had him melting into the bed, “Fuck Draco! No offense, but I don’t particularly want to think about any Weasley while in bed with you, ah, pounding my arse.”
Taking a deep breath and slowing down to a stop, Harry decided the best course of action would be to just finish off with his hand and call it a day.
Caught unaware, Harry blinked once, and the side of Malfoy’s mouth tilted up as if he was trying not to smirk before he caught himself and turned around in his seat.
As he finally made it to where he knew the peephole was, he sat down crisscross and inhaled deeply, before glancing through to the other side.
“People are known to change. Some for the better, some not so much.” Malfoy straightened up from where he was leaning, brushing the imaginary dust off his midnight blue dress robes that fit him well.
Draco sucked and licked Harry’s arsehole as if it was one of his favorite ice creams from Fortescue’s. Harry bit his tongue so hard to keep it from erupting in pure wanton moans; he could taste the blood in his mouth.
Something about Malfoy this year made Harry lightheaded. His whole aura -- the way he lightly sat on his bed, his textbook laying on his delicately crossed legs, one precise eyebrow raised as he wrote down notes in his potions notebook -- was completely different than the version Harry saw on the stage.
Hips bucked up, practically throwing the lithe man above him off . But Draco bit his lip and re-situated, making sure to hold him down between his legs, to Harry’s sorry-sounding whine of defeat.
After the Iain debacle, Malfoy seemed more inclined to shut his mouth and relax, which Harry was desperately thankful for, the only sounds for the next few hours were the few people around them in their own small talks and the faint sounds of the waves crashing at the beach.
Harry turned to Ron, who looked as perplexed as he felt and actually almost laughed this time. Hermione was always buying people gifts that were supposedly from both of them without informing her husband first.
Harry leaned forward, inhaling Draco at the base, mouthing around it and wanting nothing more than to stay there forever, with Draco’s hand in his hair and his oh so perfect murmurs of approval he was whispering down to him.
“Are you going to completely entrench yourself in the potion, or are you coherent enough to finish the project?”
Hermione pulled out her wand and tried the same incantations and a few more Harry had never heard of, but she got the same result. Nothing.
Harry allowed himself to stare for a few more seconds, taking in his slouch in his booth seat. He could hear Pansy’s squawking at him about something or another. That was enough to make Harry snort under his breath, especially at the glower Malfoy was currently aiming her way.
Harry eyed the drink menu and decided on a Mai Tai, never having tried one before, and having heard from Luna that it was a rather good Muggle drink.
Harry turned the rest of the way around, ignoring the shots placed before him to look at Malfoy, who was currently strutting up on the stage as if he owned it, his gait strong and sure, as if he hadn’t just downed three lemon drops in a row.
And that particular thought only reminded him further that he genuinely needed to ask Hermione’s advice on Mind Healers soon.
Brooding, Harry eyed Roddy for a few seconds and shrugged. “I’ll survive. Thanks for asking, though.”
Draco didn’t think about the fact that Potter was still wearing clothes before he tied him up, but he shrugged and waved his wand once more to vanish all of his garments.
Blaise rolled his eyes so far up in his head, Harry was afraid they might get stuck up there. “No, you twat, that wasn’t it.”
Harry felt suddenly irrationally angry at his friends for talking about him, but the feeling vanished as soon as it arrived. “Er - yeah. I’ve had no one - I mean nothing to do. Besides work. So yeah.”
He wasn’t sure what to do with this and gave Draco a wide-eyed expression behind his apparently touch-starved boyfriend, who seemed very inclined to physical touch, especially with people they just met.
But Potter’s expression was far too sly for his liking under the lights of the club, his green eyes knowing.
If there had been any doubt from the last time, there was no mistaking it this time; Malfoy’s gaze was directed solely at him.
Sighing and muttering under his breath, Harry fidgeted in his seat, desperately trying to think of any other reason why he would be staying here later than usual.
- Harry was more than amenable to having a calm and relaxing eighth year, and doing whatever the hell it was he wanted to.
“It was only that ugly vase you got from Molly last year, and I repaired it immediately! Plus, Hugo got a big laugh out of it.” Harry gave his friend a small but hopeful smile, but she wasn’t falling for it.
“I don’t embarrass,” Harry answered easily, pulling Draco closer until they were inches apart, one hand grazing the back of his head while the other held the man’s hand rather tightly, his actions not fitting with his words.
Harry’s toes curled at the image that brought into his head, and bit his bottom lip until he tasted blood at the feeling of Malfoy pressing his cock inside him,
He knew of a few younger girls (and boys) right off the bat who would love nothing more than to spam his phone with love songs and extended essay formatted messages daily on how cherished he was to the wizarding world.
The toy’s tip became wider, and Harry’s open mouth of realization of the toy’s capabilities was so stunning, Draco wanted to frame it for everyone to see.
Potter threw his head back in a raucous laugh, and Draco had stared, as he usually did when Potter was so uninhibited after a few drinks.
“Is that so?” Potter lifted an eyebrow at him; his mouth turned up his a slight grin. “Well, I do appreciate it ever so Malfoy, but -”
They continued working in a stilted silence, the only sounds being the sounds of their breathing, Malfoy’s urgent quill scratching, and a light tune in the background.
“Potter. Need I remind you that we are both in bed, naked. Together. Not sure how it gets more intimate than that, but please feel free to explain further as you’ve done such a marvelous job thus far -”
After all, he didn’t have Pansy here to keep him company or gossip about how delectable Potter looked in his burgundy tinted dress robes.
But here he had Malfoy, nodding for him to get on the bed again, a glint in his eyes. Harry wasn’t sure if it was the drinks he downed earlier or the absolute need to get the aloe on his burnt skin, but he slowly shed himself of his shirt and laid on the bed on his stomach with a grimace, as the blanket on the bed rubbed up against his tender skin.
Harry wasn’t sure why he said that last bit, but sometimes his mouth was quicker than his brain. Malfoy choked on his drink, coughing up the remains of that horrid red drink.  Harry didn’t bother helping him out in the slightest.
Harry eyed the attractive greeter with an air of curiosity, but neither he nor any other hotel staff seemed to have any urge to gawk at him. All of the staff smiled pleasantly as they continued to greet other guests as they strolled in behind Harry. He let out a breath of air and felt about five pounds lighter at that fact alone as Mr. Good Looking took his luggage from him and nodded his head for Harry to follow him.
Harry found his heart had picked up speed, and his palms were sweatier than they were before Malfoy started in on his song of the night. He couldn’t even pick up his glass as the condensation on the glass made his hands even more slippery.
The Slytherin huffed at that, his arms crossed over his chest in some semblance of control over the rapidly shifting emotions in his chest.
“Answer me,” Draco brought down a hand and squeezed it around the base of Potter’s cock, groaning at the feeling of wetness on his hand from where he had been leaking the whole time.
Harry twitched at the sound of Nott cracking his knuckles, but at least Nott managed to look apologetic about it when he realized he nearly scared the living shit out of the Gryffindor.
Having an ample opportunity for embarrassment and possible blackmailing of the git would have made Harry over the moon with excitement. He might have even taken photos of the event,
Er, no. No, not at all. I may be married to a Gryffindor, but I'm still a Slytherin. I wouldn't want that to change.
Hermione remembers only a slight worry over her Arithmancy test the next day, and then Malfoy suddenly gasping and a shattered glass on the floor and Harry moving lightning-fast to grab Malfoy as his eyes closed tightly and he drew in on himself, hand to his chest, Harry's arms encircling him.
"A bit. Once Ben started doing magic, I knew it would only be a matter of time. There's only so many ways you can explain away all the things kids do at this age..."
Potter, Blaise decided, was scary as shit. And had maybe had more than just sheer dumb luck on his side all those times he'd beaten the Dark Lord.
He rubbed his forehead tiredly. Why was he worrying about the Weasleys' reaction? He didn't even know how
"What?" Ben's face lit up too, his ongoing squabbles with Alec totally forgotten. "We could live at Alec's house? That's
No, that's not what happened at all. Not sure how people got that idea. I mean, there were at least five witnesses right there when it happened.
He was a lot like Alec, actually. Gentle, and sweet, and needing so much more protection than Fred could possibly give him. Although at least all Robbie had to be protected from so far was his older sister, and occasionally his parent's fights. Not bloody
Harry turned, a bit surprised to see Draco this early in the day. "Has Ben already been released? Thought that normally happened in the afternoon."
"Oh good," Esposito's cheerful voice broke through the haze and Harry nearly had a heart attack. She chuckled at their startled reaction. "I thought you were never going to come up for air."
Ben shook his head, his eyes wide and his mouth starting to tremble, and Alec patted his back as Harry's heart sank. What the hell could he say, how could he make this better...
Their bedroom door was open and he gazed in at Harry, sleeping peacefully. Then he picked up Ben's little goddess figure, sitting next to their pictures on the shelf.
Parkinson sneers at him. "Oh, go ahead. Go back to the hospital wing, stop trying to hide the fact that Draco's in there with Potter. See if you can get him into even bigger trouble than he's already in, why don't you. I'm sure it'll make your day. You've probably been itching to do this for years."
"Draco?" Kara asked, and Malfoy glanced at Harry, who nodded, before joining Kara. Molly blinked, a bit startled, but merely nodded at Malfoy, and they set off.
Kara wants me to remind you about lunch at her place this Saturday, celebrating the CD launch and meeting her flavour-of-the-month.
"I have a life here," Draco said quietly, but there was something in his tone that... it wasn't a rejection.
"Let me show you," Draco said, and smirked as Harry hesitantly nodded and lifted himself onto his elbows, licking his lips unconsciously as he watched Draco.
"Draco," it said, speaking to the spot where Draco was supposed to be. "Congratulations on your son's Sorting." Harry realized he was no better to able to read Snape's emotions now than he had been when Snape was alive. He wondered if even Draco could tell whether Snape was being condescending or sincere.
Cornfoot took a deep breath, clearly summoning patience. "Because there's roughly eighty students above the age of consent in the school, and only forty are male, only six of those are gay or bi, and frankly most of those are just not to be countenanced as sexual partners." He paused. "Also, I'm gay," he said clearly, just in case Draco had missed that one.
"I'll arrange for transportation for her too," said Hermione, glad to have something to do, and went to the Muggle Help Desk, grateful that such a thing was finally available in the wizarding world. Grateful to spend the next fifteen minutes or so working with the witch on duty, getting a hold of Kara and arranging for transportation to St. Mungo's for her.
And Harry felt the same way, which wasn't right, but it was so hard to hold back, to go against what his body wanted. And... and holding back hadn't gotten them anywhere so far. Other than here, in Dumbledore's office, while the adults decided their future and the portraits gossiped about them.
Draco shook his head as he opened the small envelope. "It's got your name on it too, Harry," he said as he opened it up. "Fuck!" he exclaimed, and Blaise looked over his shoulder immediately, his mouth dropping open.
"It would, yeah," Alec said, and his heart beat a little faster. His father, and the cousins already in Gryffindor, and the ones who were sure they'd be in Gryffindor, and Granddad and Grandmum, and the uncles and aunts, and--
"I'm talking about you making decisions without me again. I can't - you--" Harry broke off, realizing his anger at Draco was totally out of proportion, but still incensed at Draco's baffled expression.
Ben nodded, but his mind was very obviously far away as his eyes darted around the yard and he jiggled up and down while Harry spoke.
." She drew in a shaking breath. "If it hadn't been for Ronald Weasley, Draco would have died. Because of
Pain was easy, though Lucius wasn't terribly eager to call up that memory yet. Pleasure, however... there was pleasure in fine wine, in power, in literature, and Lucius had contemplated thinking of any of those, especially as he would be tied to Weasley during the spell. But the images and memories he conjured had to be powerful and wine would not do it.
"Ben, sit," said Ron, as the audience laughed and clapped for the end of Kara's song. "Your mum'll be along soon."
He swallows hard. The Gryffindor Polyjuice Squad seemed like such a bright idea yesterday, when Ron and Hermione first proposed it. And both Ron and Neville appear to have pulled it off without a hitch. But suddenly the whole idea seems insane, because no matter how much knowledge all four of them have crammed into themselves about Malfoy's life and habits and vital information, they're crazy to believe they can pull this off without exposure for more than a day.
"Yeah, she is. Brilliant lay, too. Hope this lasts. So," she said, putting all her energy into making her voice as casual as possible. "Windbourne's rather pleased with me."
There was a brief silence, and Hermione wondered how many of the others were also desperately trying to think of something encouraging to say to Harry.
He turned away, only to be shocked to find the two boys again, far more involved - he flinched almost physically at what they were doing, then sternly pushed his embarrassment away and took amused comfort in Weasley's squeamish mental whimper at the scene.
"Can I help?" Hermione asked, pushing down her fear. "I - I've worked with Healers before, I have some experience-"
Harry cleared his throat. "Kara... we've tried for eight months," he said slowly. "If it's not going to work, we may as well face it and end it now."
"Muggle entrance is through the Floo on the left side of the main entrance doors, sir," said the witch, and turned back to Harry as Malfoy hurried away. "Sir, there's a few people here asking to come in, but we've sealed off the area-"
Somebody said Esposito means "little husband" in Latin*. Which Harry's pretty sure isn't true, for all that his Latin is mostly confined to magical terms. Still, funny that she should be dealing with two little husbands, though Fred says the correct term for spouses of the same sex is "spouse," not husband or wife, no idea why. Funny that the wizarding world would have terms like that.
"When you weren't racing off to the loo whenever Draco and Potter got within arms' reach of each other."
"Right, then, let's do it," says Ron, and pulls out a hair, handing it to Malfoy as Malfoy does the same. They silently add the white and pale orange hairs to each glass and watch them dissolve.
, so you don't have to worry about what to say to Alec. Or Ben. I'm just..." he paused and then spoke slowly, choosing his words carefully. "I am just bloody well frustrated, and trying to figure out what the fuck to do next. Is that allowed?"
"What? Oh, that. Yeah, we'll probably finish that later. Just get him booked and locked up for now." He started back out the door. "Don't forget to put an extra guard on him, yeah?"
Oh, wonderful, he thought as he got to the loo and found Fred Weasley already waiting in line there. There was a short, awkward silence.
He glanced at the centre of the circle, his view of Draco obstructed by Pomfrey but his view of Potter clear. Harry Potter, the little brat who had been gracelessly defeating the most powerful wizard in the world since babyhood. Luck and the skills of others had saved him time and time again, triumphing against the Dark Lord's brilliance and power. The urge to cast one swift, deadly curse felt like a low burn deep inside Lucius.
"So far there's only been two incidents that could've been dangerous if they went wrong," Bill said. "Of course we're keeping an eye out for deliberately harmful stuff, but so far there's been nothing. I think most people got out their anger with letters to the editor."
"No, of course not," Parkinson says scornfully as they head down the corridor, and Seamus frowns at her.
Harry made a rude gesture at the portrait, feeling a little silly even as he did it. Not like the portrait could see through his Disillusionment charm. It could probably sense what he was doing, though, as it sneered in his general direction.
"It looks here like you were canceling your plans. You wrote 'Sorry, playdate's off,' and then 'Too bad. Maybe next weekend.' That sounds as though you weren't meeting each other that weekend."
"What's this?" asked Anne, taking the paper. Her eyebrows shot up. "Good Lord. That's Harry," she said, looking closer. "Bloody hell. When did this come out?"
"Not much, any more. They're doing a lot better," said Demelza. "It was just... interesting, for a while."
"You're not quite the blushing virgin I married, are you?" Draco smirked, and Harry felt around for a pillow to hit him with.
Seamus had just finished the punchline to his hag, hippogriff and selkie joke, and Harry had laughed and turned to Draco in time to catch a half-amused glimmer in his eyes before Draco suddenly gasped and put a hand to his chest, dropping his glass of pumpkin juice. Harry felt the shock and grabbed Draco's hand, and instinctively pulled Draco to him as if he could physically take the pain and transfer it from Draco to himself.
"I've a very good idea," Malfoy said tensely, and continued in a voice that was so different from the voice in his dream that Harry started to get dizzy and he clapped a hand over Malfoy's mouth without thinking.
"Ginny was our favourite sibling, you know," he began abruptly. "George's and mine. She was - she had a hell of a sense of humour, and even though she was the baby, she could put us in our place." He took a deep breath. "When George was cursed, she was all that kept me from going insane. I don't know what I would've done without her." He took another deep breath. "When, erm, when she died, it was fucking unfair, you know? The war was over and somehow we'd all survived, even though all of us had been in the Order. We weren't supposed to have to worry about our safety any more. And then all of a sudden she was gone."
Draco nodded, and sniffed his jar of murtlap, deciding to add it to the list as well. "What are Muggle weddings like?" he asked curiously.
Now, if you want to see pictures drawn by somebody who's not trying to figure out which end of the pencil is pointy but who actually has talent, here's a few. Chibitoaster read and liked Bond, and asked if she could illustrate. After I picked my jaw off the floor and said yes, she started drawing. And so far, here's what she's come up with:
"The part where it's past noon and we've still not got dressed but we've already shagged twice and... well, done this." He grinned. "I could think of worse ways to spend the holidays."
"You think risking what happened last August is the right thing to do?" Draco asked her. "You don't understand just how famous Harry is. Or how infamous I am," he said bitterly. "Besides, it's been pretty obvious for a long time that this was coming. Better to just... get it over with."
"If you really believe a bond is all that's got Harry with Draco, you're even thicker than I thought you were."
"It's a Weasley birthday party, Alec. Everyone will be there," Harry reminded him, making himself sound cheerful at the prospect.
"All right, stop there," said Auror One abruptly, standing up. "We're flyin' blind here. We'll get the boss, let him know what's going on, reconvene once we've got our act together. And get more Veritaserum." He headed out the door, motioning the others to follow him. "Flint, you stay behind," he said to the only Auror who hadn't spoken up yet.
"Draco, I'm a cursebreaker. My place is already Unplottable and under a goblin form of Secrecy as part of my contract with Gringott's. And I've got Bill - hell, the entire Weasley family - to help protect me if I need them to." Draco stared at him. "They'd do it for you too."
The one in charge was the one currently getting pounded into, breathy moans turning slowly into sobs as Draco never slowed his maddening pace.
By some magic, he was able to keep a hold of himself above Harry as he finished, biting down on the tender flesh of Harry’s bruised neck, and he slowly lowered himself to lay down atop his sated and sticky boyfriend.
With that thought in mind, Harry smiled broadly as Justin cheered him with his glass from across the room.
“Now, you’ll be off, I presume? Unless you have anything else, you would like to muck up?” The man’s dark eyes never left Draco’s own, and Draco turned back to face Potter, who was struggling against his restraints. “After all, you’ve had your turn,” Jakob looked down disgustingly at the bulge in Draco’s pants and back up, his eyes glinting. “And it’s my turn now. Go.”
. You seem to be mistaken if you think that I will be taking any orders from you.” The blond’s grin stretched across his pointy face, “No, I’m afraid that’s not how I operate.”
“A kick to the teeth is good for some; a kiss with a fist is better than none?” Hermione repeated the lyrics rather loudly, as Harry shared one of his earbuds, wincing at her volume from where he sat beside her in the Eighth Year’s common room.
He reached down again for Harry’s cock, but his fingertips barely grazed his tip when he came hard, all over his hand and the front of both of their dress robes, screaming Draco’s name.
Harry’s hands grabbed the wall in front of him, his fingers scratching against the stone in a desperate attempt of balance as the fleshlight’s suction was immediate on his prick.
He looked back one last time at Potter, who had stopped twitching around but was staring at the door as his so-called boyfriend spoke down at him, asking him to calm down and that everything was fine now.
Accompanying the new thought of Malfoy, came another vision of the blond using this particular sex toy enveloped his senses. Harry had to lean his forehead on the resin shower wall to calm down his accelerated heart rate.
Harry gritted his jaw as Roddy poured him another glass of water and poured Malfoy one of his ridiculously colored mixed drinks.
“As much as I am enjoying your clear bewilderment of my gramophone, I think you’d best get back to work so we can be done with this sooner rather than later.”
Malfoy paid him no mind, however, only laying back further in his beach chair, stretching out his long, pale legs on his ridiculously fluffy towel.
Instead, he looked like he would rather jump in the pool and strangle Malfoy, which in all honesty, he couldn’t blame him for. Considering the Slytherin was currently biting Harry’s hand to stop him from cursing him out even more.
If his wide eyes were anything to go by, the Slytherin clearly didn’t know whether to stay or flee, but he hadn’t seized his hand back yet from where Harry had a firm grip, so Harry took that as a good sign.
“Have you thought of placing a cooling charm on your skin, or maybe a healing salve?” Harry’s frown deepened as Malfoy’s eyes traveled the length of his body, what he could see of it anyway, from his spot at the table.
"I guess so," Harry said thoughtfully. Paying this particular bill might require a personal visit to Malfoy's office at Gringotts. Next year. Very early in the next year. But now it was time for – "Let's get the turkey ready for... Christmas dinner!"
Roddy, much appreciated.” Draco hadn’t taken his eyes off the bartender, even in his short greeting to Harry.  The blond’s eyes were taking their time raking down
The man in question whined softly but immediately went to work, closing his mouth around his boyfriend’s cock, sucking it like it was his lifeline, tongue circling it mercilessly, as Draco began fucking his face with intent, drawing out the most delicious moans from Harry.
“HOW DARE YOU SPIT ON THE BLACK LEGACY WITH THIS HORRENDOUS EXCUSE FOR THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT! AND INVITING A MUDBLOOD OVER NO LESS -!”
Hermione huffed under her breath and muttered something Harry couldn't hear before standing up from her seat. “I’m quite finished for the night; I would recommend reading this when you get a second. I think you will find it...enlightening.”
Harry grimaced as his mind was whirling with all the possibilities of Malfoy’s bed partners, when he saw the man start to slowly strip the robe off his shoulders, allowing it to fall to the ground of the lavatories.
But at one point in the night, the singers became less funny and more obnoxious, and Harry had a strong urge to pull out his wand and stun his eardrums clear out of his head as the next few singers stepped up.
Draco only raised an imperious eyebrow at that and watched as Potter’s eyes left his own to drag down the rest of him, obviously stopping at his crotch level. Draco almost put a hand in front to cover himself, worried about the stain that might be there from earlier.
As Potter spoke directly to the Minister for Magic of the recent Auror missions he had been sending his recruits on, Draco couldn’t help to survey Potter’s neck for any unfortunate marks made by any other person. He felt a twinge of ease when his neck seemed free of any lewd blemishes.
Malfoy had then begun moving his hips into his waiting fist, his other hand holding himself upright against the damp tiles of the shower as the water still cascaded down his back.
A few minutes later, or it could have been hours, Draco wasn’t sure; he took his hand away, and Harry grumbled something under his breath, and Draco tutted.
“Yeah, but,” Harry swallowed and took a deep breath in before continuing. He knew this was the moment, a moment that needed to happen between them. And whatever happened from it, well, at least he can finally tell Ron and Pansy that he tried.
Harry leaned further into the cauldron to get a better sniff and almost moaned aloud. He wanted to smother himself with it, wanted to jump into the cauldron, and bathe in it. The smell was so enticing, it was making him want to -
He managed to make himself a tad bit more presentable after a few moments and eyed Draco beside him mischievously. “Well, if you ever need a hand in that area. I could be of assistance.”
Malfoy cleared his throat. “Yes, thank you oh so much, Kreacher. As much as I would love to hear more about Potter’s indiscretions, I have a job to do. Now, the rug?”
Harry shuddered as the other man’s voice becomes a timbre lower than usual, and he took a final step inside the shower until he was standing right behind him, still dressed in his Auror uniform, not seeming to care.
Harry let out the breath he had been holding and a sigh of relief as he began to stuff himself back into his trousers, keeping his eye on Malfoy’s retreating form, his arse moving back and forth mesmerizingly.
Harry groaned into Draco’s skin, causing goosebumps to appear over him. Draco pushed down, rubbing along his reddened lips from the activities prior, gritting his teeth from the sensation.
“Do you want this?” Draco said as he rubbed his cock against Potter’s hole, observing his expression carefully. Potter nodded his head, so fast Draco was concerned it was going to pop right off from the speed. He chuckled, hating the lower timbre of his voice. It felt so false, to be so intimate with Potter while covered by a façade. But still, he wanted to pinch himself to ensure this wasn’t all a dream. If it was, it was the best dream he had ever had.
Nodding his head, Harry moaned around the plug still in his mouth. "You make such a pretty sight. I do love the color you chose for this beauty."
As soon as he was fully sheathed inside, he let out the breath of air he was holding, his hands still glued to his sides, unsure what to do with them.
Harry chuckled at the image of Neville’s swim shorts falling off in the ocean as Malfoy dramatically told the story. And that’s when Harry realized the man wasn’t as terrible as he had led himself to believe.
Harry felt a tug in his chest as he realized the lyrics to the music playing overhead came from the same song that Typhon sent him earlier that week.
Draco snorted under his breath, realizing his smart, bratty mouth was most likely why Potter had been gagged in the first place before he thrust into Potter harder than he had done before, and the man groaned in relief. Draco didn’t stop this time, his thrusts getting harder and harder as he kept up his pace, never relenting.
And there he was, down by the shore. Harry almost stood up to stop whatever he was doing to the other man, but he slowly realized he helped him learn how to use his board.
When they walked through the doors of the place, he certainly was not expecting to see Draco Malfoy taking shot after shot at the bar, surrounded by Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, and a few other Slytherins that Harry didn’t recognize.
“Pl-please! Ah, ah! I want to come on your cock, ah -!” Malfoy’s thrusts were hard enough that the bed itself pushed it hard enough to break the plaster on the wall.
“Yes, well, I am more than certain there are many things about me you are not privy to, Potter.” He raised an eyebrow at that, a smirk playing at the edge of his pink mouth.
To his frustration and relief, Malfoy walked over with the same sex toy from the other day. The one that practically called to him when it rolled over to Malfoy the first day he came over to Harry’s room.
Draco adored the differences between them, his pale skin versus Harry’s darker color. Yet, he was still able to mark Harry up for days onward, and he could even see the reddened blush scattered on his skin from the teasing Draco loved to give him.
Nah, I think I like the idea of the chase. I think I’ll stick to the songs they’ve been sending, for now, try to figure out who they are from that.”
“Hop up onto the stage and make a complete arse of yourself?” Theo added from behind him, oh so helpfully.
“I feel like out of the two of us, you would be the one less inclined to dabble with that kind of thing. No offense. I know you’ve come to a new realization or whatever that you like Muggle things, but I do remember you being a prick back in the day about them.”
At some point in his research and fervent listening to all the songs, Harry knew it all came down to this, and he was going to find his person tonight.
He contemplated telling Malfoy about Typhon because maybe he knew where that name came from; perhaps it was some pureblood nonsense he would be privy to.
Most, if not all, of the people sitting at the table, turned their heads to where Draco Malfoy was sitting with some other Slytherins, finishing up on some homework by the looks of it. Harry, not paying a speck of attention, kept his eyes solely on his phone as the song played out to the end.
Slughorn eyed Harry with a crooked grin, and Harry only nodded tightly back. He could feel Malfoy’s gaze on him as Slughorn left them all to it.
“Well,” he cleared, “Perhaps...we both have been a pair of twats?” Grey eyes found green in pure mirth, and Harry scooted closer to the man, wanting to drown in that look.
He tried swallowing but found that difficult as well, his mouth too fucking parched for anything but his stilted, heavy breathing. His head was spinning, and he couldn’t concentrate on anything except the body’s smooth lines in front of him.
“You know - you could just send them a song back,” Dean offered as he played his turn in Exploding Snap back in the common room later that evening.
Harry muttered a good riddance as the house-elf took the portrait off the floor and vanished with it, no doubt Apparating to a place somewhere else in the house to haunt Harry later.
“This was a great choice on your behalf, Mr. Potter, as this is one of our most popular floors, as it’s the very top of the condo. You have a perfect view of the ocean from your room in particular.”
Harry cleared his throat, “So - erm….I was wondering if you, uh- ever played around with that music-”
Malfoy opened his mouth to reply, but Harry wasn’t waiting around to listen to any more of what Malfoy had to say. He fled the classroom, careful not to slam the door on his way out.
Draco thrust a few more times before responding, “A new innovative invention. You can thank George Weasley for it. It’s a part of the company’s new line.”
He grits his teeth at the feeling of Draco’s fingers touching him everywhere but where he needed it most, and he felt a bead of sweat start to trickle down his forehead from holding himself back from screaming in agony.
Looking down at his drink, Harry wasn’t sure if he was fearful for the night to come or looking forward to the atrocities of what could only be drunk Hogwarts students singing off-key as if their lives depended on it.
A few moments passed then, and Draco sadly figured it was time to ready himself, as he did up his trousers and stuffed his wand into the pocket of his robe.
He hadn’t seen the git since the trials three years prior; he recalled as he hovered over mere mortals like Draco himself, giving his two cents - which allowed Draco to walk free.
Minutes passed, though it could have very well been hours; Harry wasn’t entirely sure. But he finally came to and was met with Malfoy beside him; arms wrapped protectively around him, Harry smiled softly into the hold.
Before Malfoy could argue with him in his current state of content, he reached up and lightly showered his neck in kisses. “I must admit that I do appreciate your sudden interest in mine and Hermione’s relationship; however, I can assure you it is strictly the non-sexual kind. No offense to her, of course.”
He figured there had to be other things to do besides lounge by the beach and get as drunk as the fishes, but for some reason, something kept pulling at him to go down to the sand.
