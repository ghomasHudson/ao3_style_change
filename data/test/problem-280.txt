The others go silent for a moment then break out in cheers. Draco smiles slightly. If he's going to be married then at the very least he can go out with a bang. Blaise sits down with a mischievous gleam in his eye. "We'll use the ball as a cover!" He exclaims then quickly quiets himself to a whisper leaning in close. "If we slip out near the end people will be too drunk to notice" the rest of them lean in close. "How long will we be going for? We'll have to get everything ready" Goyle says nearly vibrating with excitement. They look to Draco and he shakes his head "I don't intend to come back" he hadn't even realized this was his plan until he says it but once it comes out it feels right. "At least not if I'm to marry a stranger" his friends look at him with shocked expressions.
But the group has seemingly made up their minds already. They start to close in on him and he knows if he's going to escape that this is his only chance.
"Seriously, have you ever met Hermione?" Ron retorts laughing slightly which doesn't help Harry's mood. Even Draco who has had very few interactions with her knows she is brilliant but extremely stubborn. Ron looks over and seems to have just noticed him there and shoots him a glare which Draco returns. He huffs and quickly turns back to his potion, not wanting to get involved but still being too curious to leave.
"Mate! Calm down!" Crabbe yells swooping over to Draco nearly missing a pin as it flies over his head. "Draco!" Crabbe yells but Draco refuses to look up as he tears out the pins halfway up his trousers. He's crying and it's too hard to see the pins anymore. They prick his fingers drawing blood but he can't bring himself to care. He doesn't even realize when Blaise grabs the front of his broom guiding him down to an empty field. Not until he feels the rough grass around him. He breathes in big sobbing breaths and his hands clench around fistfuls of grass and he rips them out of the ground cursing.
It takes several rewrites to leech out every ounce of desperation, the near pleading of his words for her validation. He would hate for her to see him waver. Its just that he doesn't entirely know who he is or what he is supposed to do. But he knows he loves his family, that they sacrificed everything for him. Surely he just needs her reassurance then all of his worries will go away.
"You don't have to go that far" Blaise says, for once trying to be the voice of reason for Draco as opposed to the other way around. "You'll lose your inheritance, you know how strict your parents are." But Draco shakes his head resolutely "I don't want their money if it means I have to live my life by their terms." He looks around the table and the excitement has turned into worry. "If you're truly my friends then you'll help me get out." His voice breaks slightly and the desperation behind his words is apparent.
"And what if she isn't better by tomorrow? Do you think we'll be blamed?" She asks and he shrugs, her head jostled as he does. "They'll blame me, and if that happens then I've never heard your name in my life." He says seriously and she grins. "I can talk to that little reporter if you want, I'm very convincing with a wand in my hand." She says and he reaches a hand over to pat her head "Thanks Pans, you don't have to do that though."
"Made you a healing potion just in case Weaslette attacks you again." He says and she looks down at it for a moment. "Is it just because I'm mad at you?" She says haughtily, still acting as though she won't take it even though he knows she can't refuse a gift to save her life.
Draco Malfoy is not the type to rebel, he listens to his minders, and when he is asked to do something, he does it without question. It isn't that he never gets the fleeting fancy to run off with his friends and get drunk on commoner's wine. Though from time to time he allows himself to do just that if the risk of being caught is slim. The thing is that he has more to lose than they do. If they make a mistake there is someone else to take their place. But Draco is the lone heir to his family's legacy, the only legitimate heir at the very least. He never allows himself to go out and flirt, or dance, or make a scene and it irritates his friends to no end.
"Dreamless sleep" He says by way of explanation scooting it closer to Harry. He looks at the vial for a moment then pushes it away. Without any further discussion he rolls over. Though he can't help but notice that he keeps his glasses on and his wand clenched under his pillow.
There are very few times in a young noble's life that they are able to cut loose from their parents watchful eye. More than anything the scrutiny of others is hardest to escape, because regardless of how sneaky you might think you've been, there will always be rumor that reaches back to your family. But while growing up, it is nearly as much a need to rebel as it is to breathe. Even if it is only in the smallest of ways. It's not all late nights and drunken stupors, at least, not for Draco. The ways in which he rebels are small and seemingly silly to his friends. Perhaps leaving the first few buttons of his shirt undone until someone tells him to do them up, sleeping in later than he should, or mucking about with the servants, and once in a blue moon traipsing off to a friend's house without telling anyone.
He has seen her stabilize multiple hexed students by now, it's the same process everytime. Without thinking he hurries to the supplies puts on a pair of gloves and grabs an iv, syringes and bandages for the boy's head as Pomfrey collects the medicine. He sets to work arranging everything and when Pomfrey returns with his papers and medicine she looks surprised for a moment before her attention moves back to the boy. She flips through his file and readies the gauze. "No preexisting conditions, so he must have been hexed like the others." She sighs pressing gauze to where he is bleeding near his ear.
"Yep!" She says with a pop of the p, "It's great isn't it?" She says grinning "I couldn't get them to drop the whole
She shakes her head swallowing a mouthful of food. "My dearest dumb Draco" She says on a sigh. "You didn't even read the whole thing. I told them to put in that you denied their interview, you have complete culpability. Its not
Harry stops to check the map and Draco peers over his shoulder confused when he sees the names of people milling about but Harry stows it away before he can get a proper look. They walk quickly through the now empty corridors and Draco can't help but notice his palms have grown sweaty and his heart refuses to slow down. With every single breath he can smell Harry's shampoo. He wants to be angry, he should be. That's the person he was told to be. But Harry came to save him even after they fought. He'd always thought Harry's gallantry was idiotic, but being on the recieving end it feels different.
"No I-" He started but was promptly cut off by the opening of doors. Immediately Draco's back straightened in his chair, hoping that it wasn't his parents. But to his relief it was only one of the servants and so he slumped back in his chair.
Not that he doesn't love his family and friends just that he has never known romantic love. He had shortly forced himself into a relationship with Pansy that neither of them seemed to enjoy. Their parents would have been thrilled if the two of them one day got married though. He shrugs off the memory and takes a seat next to Mary.
As he walks back he takes several wrong turns, most of them intentionally to waste time. If he has to deal with the golden trio right now he might just pull out his own hair. With the approaching curfew there are only a few people scattered about the halls and he walks by them swiftly hoping not to be recognized. When he arrives back at his dorm thankfully the room is empty. He can hear the shower running in the attached bathroom and he sighs with relief. He falls onto his bed happy to be alone even for a short time. He stares up at the ceiling and takes a moment to breathe.
"We don't take kindly to enemies on our land." Says the one in the middle, who he assumes is the leader. Draco swallows hard, his nerves getting the best of him. "I'm- I'm not an enemy" He stammers and there is a scoff from the centaurs. "I've left the ways of the dark lord!" He says even though this isn't entirely true.
By the time he finishes all of his classes and is trudging back to his dorm he can only hope that Harry and his gang are gone. In his corridor he feels a tap on his shoulder and he startles spinning around. Pansy is looking at him haughtily, her arms crossed over her chest and her nose in the air. "Not that you deserve to know after abandoning us but Crabbe and Goyle are leaving school." She says and it takes a moment to register with him.
He can hear his friends laughing when he returns but upon seeing his stricken expression they sober. "Has someone died?" Crabbe asks looking at him slightly startled. Draco's expression is far off as he speaks still not truly believing the words as he says them. "I'm....betrothed" Draco says and there are exclamations of indignation from all of them. They speak over one another and Draco sits heavily in his chair feeling both numb and ready to burst in the same moment.
He looks different than when they were younger. Even just a year before he seemed more of a child. But war has a way of forcing you to grow up. He has more scars, some of them more evident than others and he looks stronger as well. He has always been wiry and gangly but it seems he has grown into himself.
Draco can hear Blaise mutter to Goyle "What the fuck is a cargo short?" To their mutual confusion. But Pansy looks at them pointedly and says "It's ugly, now go!" and they quickly split up to search for clothes.
"From him! I've already told you I'm trying to stay out of trouble." Draco says shaking his head as he eats. Crabbe looks at him wide eyed "I thought you were joking about that!"
With a clipping from the daily prophet talking about how he'd "saved a muggleborn's life." And his potion to rid him of his dimples. The note ends up crumpled in his trash and set aflame in a fit of frustration. And he made potions nearly the entire night.
"No!" Draco says frantically shaking his head. "Please, Merlin no! Which way?" Draco asks looking around for a way out.
He can't help but think of his own friends, two of whom would soon be leaving. At least with them still at school he can delude himself into thinking he might be able to fix things after his mother's plan plays out. He hears a tap at the window and Neville opens it only to be greeted by Draco's owl. He assumes Harry tells him so much because Neville glances to Draco then goes back to his place among the pillows on Harry's bed.
To lose a war is a terrible thing, particularly when everyone you have ever loved loses alongside you. If he could go back he wouldn't waste his time scheming ways to insert himself into the battle. He should have protected his family and friends, though they would undoubtedly refused to have listened. He and all of Voldemort's other supporters  were childishly hopeful that he would carry them to an idyllic future. Draco wanted his approval so desperately but the dark lord trusted nobody. It seems the harder he tried the more that he was hated.
When he returns he sees Harry with a brush in hand splattering his nameplate with colors. He sits staring at his own for a minute before Harry looks over at him. "I'm surprised to see you here." Harry says with a quizzical look. "Why are you taking muggle art?" He asks and Draco shrugs trying to figure out how to open one of the tubes. Harry reaches over taking it from him and pulls off a little plastic tab then repeats the same for the others.
"Draco! You absolute idiot!" She says laughing "You're trying to tell me that when you would stare longingly across the great hall you didn't have a crush on him?" She says in a disbelieving tone. "I've never stared longingly!" He huffs.
Each time he manages to fall asleep he is jolted awake by the wind whistling, a branch tapping against the window, or the deep seated fear that he might be attacked in his sleep. Eventually he is awoken by the pattering of rain which refuses to let him drift off again so he gives up and trudges over to his desk.
As soon as the group passes through the door Madam Pomfrey points them toward a bed. "Name and what happened?" She asks in a clipped tone looking frazzled, which isn't common for her. Draco can see that multiple curtains are closed, each one with another comatose student. As the boy was laid down he recognized him from his arithramancy class and one of the boys in the group starts to speak. "Thomas Bader, he..I..I don't what happened" He says then sniffs his eyes growing teary. "He stood up to do a presentation and then just passed out." Says a girl as she and all of the other ravenclaws buzz around his bed. Pomfrey has to fight to get past them.
They would often bring him tales of wild nights and misadventures in an attempt to make him join in on their shenanigans. Crabbe would speak of a girl he nearly bed, and Goyle would speak of the wine and dancing he'd missed, while Blaise would weave a tale of some fantastical near miss with death or the law. In all honesty it was tempting, sometimes he wished they wouldn't tell him these stories if only to spare him the slow and agonizing passage of his youth. It felt like he was living vicariously through them, yet missing every opportunity to have adventures for himself.
"How do you do that?" Draco asks a little stunned. "You're not worried that they'll be pissed or cut you off or something?" Draco asks and Crabbe shrugs.
An awful plan and an even worse announcement
"She fell into the fountain and hit her head." He says again watching as she is floated away. "We'll have her treated and she'll be up and dancing in no time" His mother says smiling though it is more to reassure the guests than him. "Go dry yourself off" she says taking his arm and guiding him away from the crowd but once they're out of earshot she hisses "If I find out you pushed her into the fountain-" but he didn't let her finish. "I didn't" He says firmly but her expression is skeptical.
He jumps when he hears the door open behind him and he quickly drops his hands. Harry flops down on his bed not paying any attention to him. Draco starts to flip through his runes textbook when Harry rolls over to look at him. "Wanna be my model for like ten minutes?" He asks grabbing the skecthbook Professor Fletcher had given them for their portraits.
But instead of looking at all defeated Pomfrey's expression only grows more defiant. "If a child dies due to lack of medicine, that will be entirely your fault." Pomfrey says clearly angry. But instead of responding Umbridge just tuts and shakes her head as she turns around and leaves.
"Pansy I'm being serious!" He says and she sighs rolling her eyes. "Fine, what is it?" She asks closing the door and plopping down on her bed. He suddenly goes silent wondering if he should actually go through with telling her. He looks around the room again and fidgets for a moment "My roommate is gone, happy? Come on, spit it out."
"With Umbridge here we won't be getting an education anyways! You remember how it was!" Harry grumbles but Ginny steps between them with a gleam in her eye. "I've got an idea" she says with a mischevious grin. After a moment she jerks her head in Dracos direction who had been sneaking a look. He quickly fixes his eyes on his cauldron again, pretending he hasn't been listening the entire time. Then with the muttering of muffliato the room becomes silent once again. Only the bubbling of his cauldron and every so often the shuffling of feet break through.
"For what exactly?" Harry asks through gritted teeth turning back to hit the dummy even harder. "For, um, for-" He tries but he swallows hard when Harry's fist connects with the dummy. "For saying uh mud..you know" Draco says awkwardly knowing if he says mudblood again even to apologize it will only make Harry more angry. But Harry turns to him his expression furious. "You're sorry?" He scoffs taking a step closer. "Are you really? It definitely doesn't seem like you are if you're in the papers pretending you weren't the dark lord's lackey" Harry spits.
"Why did you-" Draco starts but Harry cuts him off with a shush. The hand on his hip feels as though it's burning into him. There are several more moments of silence before Draco pushes his hand away.
"I understand that many of you have faced some difficulties," Draco almost wants to laugh at what an understatement this is. "But it is my job as your headmistress to guide you toward a better future. Setting in place sorely needed structure to aid all of you in the wake of such troubled times." She continues on to talk about the investigation that the ministry has launched within hogwarts, how they plan to reform the school, the safety precautions they will be adding to the school. It all sounds wonderful, but it is difficult to extricate the truth from her words.
He looks down at the girl then to the headmistress "Why did you bring me here?" He asks feeling his chest constrict slightly around the words. Mcgonagall looks at him for a moment longer. "This is a warning and an extended hand. Dumbledore told me before his death-" Draco flinches slightly at the mention of dumbledore but Mcgonagall continues. "He told me that after the war is over and Voldemort is dead that there are still battles to be won. This," She says gesturing to Mary who hasn't opened her eyes nor moved a muscle. "Is one of those battles. I am asking regardless of whether you were or were not a part of this attack, what do you value and what side are you on? That is entirely your decision."
They stop before they're in sight of the manor doors again "Did you fall for a servant?" He asks curiously and there is a pause of silence between them. "You could keep him if we married, only if nobody finds out and I'm given the same courtesy." He says trying to bring back her good mood. But with the manor looming so close it feels impossible.
Purebloods view dimples as weakness a sign of weakness and dirtied blood. If tou have dimples then it is simply assumed that you are a blood traitor. Knowing this would ruin them Draco's parents taught him not to smile. Even when he is dosed with potion if he smiles he is scolded fiercely. He didn't even realize this was abnormal until he met other purebloods and found that they freely smiled. But he had to think of his family, if another pureblood saw him their family would surely be disgraced. As the sole heir of his line he holds the weight of his family legacy on his shoulders. And the mistake of forgetting his potion just once could ruin everything they worked for.
Beneath it is a picture he wasn't even aware had been taken of him leaned over the witch last night looking panicked as he tried to get her to breathe. Just as Madam Pomfrey rushes into frame and he looks up at her the picture loops back to the beginning. Under the picture it reads
"Who?" Draco asks and Harry scoffs. "Seriously couldn't tell if you're joking if someone paid me." Though Draco wasn't joking at all. Even though most of the class had been about DaVinci and the Mona Lisa he had been far too distracted by Harry merrily mixing paints next to him. He bites his lip remembering his mother's advice then before he can talk himself out of it he sits up and smiles. It feels entirely wrong, particularly to be smiling in front of Harry. When Harry looks up his mouth cracks into a goofy grin that makes his heart jump up into his throat. He swallows nervously his smile quickly falling away.
Draco and Pansy sit together for a long time either studying or in amicable silence. Draco can't quite find the guts to return to his own room and Pansy doesn't seem eager to force him to leave. It's only after Ginny returns with Luna on her heels that Pansy suggests they go for a walk. And by the glares the two of them throw at one another Draco knows he isn't going to want to argue. They walk in silence and the feeling is comforting in a way that he has missed dearly.
"You're supposed to smile in pictures" He says looking up at Draco then down at his picture as he furiously starts erasing something. "That's kind of the whole reason Mona Lisa is famous"
From experience he knows that if he goes after her she'll be angry with him no matter what he says. It's better to let her cool down then give her chocolates as an apology. Draco sighs running an hand through his hair feeling guilty. It's not as if he doesn't feel for her, they're going through the same thing right now. But eventually people will remember that not all slytherins were helping the dark lord. But his family was, and that will follow him for the rest of his life.
fault that they just got their incorrect information from the prophet like everyone else." She is smirking and he shakes his head "You're kind of a genius and truly just so very slytherin." And she beams at him "Thank you!" She says happily then stands from the table to go to class.
"I don't wish to discuss it" She sighs and after looking toward the manor for a moment she turns to him "I've hit my head and it aches terribly so I'll need a firewhiskey and a quiet place as far away from the party as possible" She says and he hardly has time to nod before she flings her arms around him and with very little warning throws her feet in the air for him to catch.
He stands not wanting to wallow any further and he picks up his book to go check it out. The librarian is an old witch and she smiles gently. He is taken aback for a moment as this is one of the first smiles he'd recieved from a stranger in quite a while. It made him want to smile back but the potion that keeps his dimples away only lasts for so long. If he were to smile there's no telling if they would poke through or not so he simply nods and takes the book with him.
Draco sits on his bed horrified and trying to calm down. Why did his heart seem to flutter anytime he thought about Harry? He is holding one of his textbooks moreso looking through it than at it. His heartrate suddenly triples when he hears the door open and Harry walks in. He's silently trying to figure out a way to leave without looking like he's avoiding Harry. But with the incident last night and the article this morning he has to clear things up.
"Pansy Parkinson" He says with a nod "I actually didn't know about you until earlier this afternoon." She sits up looking at him utterly shocked. "My parents have been pushing the idea of marrying you for months and you didn't even know I existed?" She asks a harsh laugh bubbling out of her.
He has taken to helping her with some of the students that come in with minor illnesses and injuries. Though he has to convince her every single time. He figures it will look food on his resume when he's trying to become an alchemist, or at least that's what he tells himself. He tries to ignore the satisfaction when he is able to correctly diagnose a student. He already knows his path and nothing will derail him.
His things had long since been packed and Crabbe had come to hide them in the stables. It still doesn't feel quite real and perhaps it won't until he has left. But he puts aside his thoughts of escape and marraige to keep himself from trudging his way downstairs. He is careful of his posture not wanting to give any reason for attention to be drawn by his parents. He can hear music playing softly in the ballroom and its hard not to roll his eyes at the familiar tune. It's played at every single ball they've  had since he was a child. He knows every step, every turn, every breath of the dance that goes along with it and when he enters the ballroom he can see those who have already arrived moving in unison. There is even a young boy practicing in the far corner of the hall and Draco wishes he could warn him. It makes his heart ache knowing that he did the same when he was young. He has always been so eager to please his parents and he has always trusted that they have the best for him at heart. But with the slow familiar ballad he can only imagine it as a song of mourning.
"What do you mean? What are they planning?" Draco asked confused and annoyed that they aren't listening to his refusals.
As a group they would always gather at Malfoy manor, as it was the largest of all of their homes and there were never any siblings around to pester them. There weren't nearly as many listening ears and mouths willing to snitch on them and their exploits. Though there were servants, but they could always be bribed. It's not as if Draco had anything more than a handful of passing flings and drunken nights to be exploited as it is. But it is best to have any rumors contained, especially when his friends are often such scoundrels. They are pureblood aristocracy too after all, and it would be tragic to tarnish their reputations.
"You would undoubtedly die a horrible death, you couldn't possibly charm your way out of an entire angry mob" Draco retorted, hoping the challenge might shift the topic away from him, or at least away from the party.
He sighs resting his head against the wall for a moment. It's cool against his skin and he tries to calm himself. If he had just been put with the slytherins he could skate through the year with relative ease. He could keep his head down and have a safe place to come back to each night. But now he has to worry for his life at all times. Though it seems a fitting punishment for his part in the war. He pushes away his thoughts knowing he can't worry about everything at once. And after a minute he curses under his breath and goes to take a shower.
He has buried every grain of kindness in himself so deeply that even a simple statement like this feels as though he has exposed himself. Seeing Harry's face has only made him embarrassed, wondering whether he should have said something biting instead. He quickly takes a seat at his desk and his shoulders curl forward wanting to bury himself away again. He tries to go back to stirring but he is far too aware of Harry's footsteps behind him.
He feels the corner of his mouth twitch up, followed immediately by the fear that one of his dimples had shown. Undoubtedly the potion had worn off by now. Draco swiftly turns away though Harry doesn't seem to notice. Without trying to be suspicious he opens his trunk and snags a vial from inside hiding it in his pocket. "It looks like the walls of a child's bedroom." He says and it sounds far less lighthearted than he'd hoped and Harry immediately stops laughing and instead huffs turning to look at him.
"What happened?" A second year boy asks, looking to Draco with wide eyes "I..I don't know" He says peering at the unconcious girl. Before he can get a better look Madam Pomfrey is rushing her away and he is left in the crowd of students. He and pansy share a worried look, not only for the girl but for themselves. If she was hexed there is no way that one of them won't be blamed.
"And the other parts?" He asks and Draco looks away trying to think of a way out of this conversation.
Draco glares at Ginny, deciding to ignore Luna entirely. He so desperately wants to argue but he bites his tongue. It only takes a minute of halting conversation as the group tries to get around revealing anything with Draco in earshot before they give up and cast a muffliato. He can't help but be curious and he finds himself continually glancing over toward them. He caught the top of one of the many papers to read The Hogwarts Journal followed be in decipherable handwriting.
Harry leans over to him making Draco's heart suddenly speed up "It's a projector" Harry whispers and he can feel the breath against his cheek. When he looks over his stomach seems to tie itself in knots with Harry so close. He's pointing to a little black box connected to the ceiling but Draco is far too preoccupied with the fact that Harry is in his space to care anymore. So he simply nods and slumps in his seat trying not to wonder why he's so flustered.
and she hits me with a jelly legs jinx!" She says and Draco scoffs.
He folds the letter and tucks it away into the pocket of his robes. He doesn't have to think about where he's going, he just calmly stands as not to attract the attention of the group across the room and heads for the door. He needs advice even if the only people he can trust are those he is forbidden to speak to.
Draco couldn't retain much during the class. It felt like everyone was watching him and every so often he would get distracted by Harry painting and repainting his nameplate. To his horror they were assigned to paint portraits of their deskmate, meaning Harry. He was near pounding his head in the table. As soon as class was over he took his things and bolted for the door. Two hours of curse breaking was exactly the distraction he needed. He could focus on problems right in front of him instead of worrying about anything or anyone.
"I'm...betrothed?" He repeated sounding bewildered even to himself and his mother nods to him. "To who?" He asks, his voice rising quickly into hysterics.
Even in their dorm Draco has seen less of Harry these days as some nights he doesn't return, and even when he does it is far after curfew. He assumes he is staying with the weasel, though he isn't going to question him on it. During the night regardless of if Harry is there or not he can hardly sleep. He has often found himself brewing potions through the night. With each of his worries that mount it takes increasingly complex potions to keep his mind occupied.
"I'm not sure, it wasn't any hexes that I know of." He says and Pansy is quiet for a moment. "Who do you think hexed her?" She asks but he knows the real meaning behind her words. An innate fear that has prickled in the back of his mind from time to time as well. "It wasn't him, you know that just as well as I do. We watched the dark lord die." She nods quietly then sighs and rests her head against his shoulder.
Not to mention those who were imperiused are viewed by purebloods as weak willed. She's risking their standing with purebloods for a ploy that might not even work. As he gets closer to the end she mentions him. Calling him resilient, strong and brave, all things that he isn't. She gave him credit for breaking their supposed imperius curse.
"Let's just say my relationship is the reason my parents wish to marry me off so quickly." She sighs looking out at one of the fairies bouncing along the bushes.
"They could be the ones to leave." She says pointedly glaring as Draco drags her past them. When the door closes behind them he turns to her and crowd s his arms saying. "As much as I'd love to fight with them, you know as well as I do that we have to avoid trouble this year." And at this she sighs heavily. "You're  right." She grumbles starting to walk with him down the hall "But staying out of trouble is no fun."
It feels like he is missing a million things, but surely anything of true importance he would have remembered by now. Draco carries with him his wet clothes just in case they need a reason to be out in the halls. But they are for the most part empty. Other than some house elves who scurry away at the sight of them they don't see anyone along the way.
"Is it so obvious?" She sighs tugging at the sleeves of her dress the lace on one side snagging against her ring which makes her curse under her breath.
His mind races as he walks through the halls and servants rush around him. There is a  weight in his gut like a rock dragging him down to the bottom of a river. But as he stands in the doorway of the ballroom and watches servants arranging flowers for the meeting of his future wife a fire is lit within him. He never asked for this life, it was simply thrust upon him. He has been careful his whole life and this is what it has gotten him? His heart beats fast like the wings of a bird trapped in a cage. His stomach twists and he suddenly turns from the hall running as fast as his legs will carry him.
"Where is everyone?" Draco whispers, wary of the quiet streets populated only by the occasional muggle. Pansy waves him away "The party" she says as if this should be obvious. "The hotel will be filled once people start to grow tired of sleeping on the floor of the manor" He looks at her incredulously but before he can say anything with the flourish of her hand she says "I found it!" And a very muggle looking shop sits in front of them.
In truth he did very little during the war. At the time he felt that he should have been doing more. But every assignment he was given, he failed. He never went through with killing Dumbledore and his biggest contribution was sneaking a few people onto the hogwarts grounds. If anything, his involvement had been a detriment, by dragging his feet in killing Dumbledore it allowed him time to search for horocruxes. He rubs his eyes and sighs heavily as the moment of his death flashed in his mind.
He curses searching for his wand but it's missing. A scream of frustration threatens to bubble up inside hin but he pushes it down There are plenty of dangerous creatures in the forbidden forest and any noise could draw them to him. He has to force the image of Frerin Grayback sitting at their dinner table picking flesh out out of his teeth from his mind.
"Sleeping curse pact?" Draco asks and she nods holding her hand out to him without lifting her head "Deal" she says and he rolls his eyes. Grabbing her hand he stands and pulls her up from the table. "Come on we've got alchemy" He says and she groans trudging behind him.
Draco can't help but be curious why she would want mens robes but he can't question it in front of the shop keeper so instead he says "I'd like a suit of the same cut just a darker fabric when you're finished" And he shoots Pansy a look which she pretends she doesn't see. After some time her suit has been sewn and Pansy smiles at herself in the mirror. "Tell your brother I will tailor eet for a good deescount" She says and Pansy nods smiling but as she is about to speak there is a loud scuffling and muffled voices from the front of the store. "Of course" pansy says quickly then bolts toward the front.
"And I'm sure her dowry is very impressive!" Draco huffs, and their silence was only confirmation. It didn't matter who she was or whether or not they're compatible, all that matters is that she was from a rich family pureblood family and has a big dowry. There was so much anger growing inside him that he was tempted to throw something across the room and his father's ash tray was within reach. But instead he turned, storming out of the office and fumed his way through the halls.
Curses are easy to understand, they all have patterns and logical solutions. It's humans that are complicated. If people were like curses or potions with a list of rules where every action has an expected reaction life would be so much simpler. Three tablespoons of dried magarth and he could fix the perception people had of him. Or a pinch of jorlin and he could figure out why Harry makes him so jumpy and nervous. But it's not rhat simple.
There seems to be an endless array of clothing. Pansy turns to address them as if they are her troops. "Listen up! Crabbe I need you to take the shirts, Goyle you take the trousers, Blaise you look through the accessories. If you find anything that looks decent then bring it to me." She says pointing them to their respective aisles. "The faster we finish, the faster we get to the party!" She turns for a moment then quickly turns back "If anybody brings me cargo shorts or a polo I will genuinely hex you"
"I never asked to be a hero!" Harry yells back his face growing red with rage.
He is dragged back to reality by Blaise's voice "You alright there, Draco?" He asks and he realize Blaise must have been trying to get his attention for a while. "Yeah I-" he starts but the weight of the lie feels immense. "No..no I'm not." He says and it feels like the world has suddenly been lifted off his shoulders.
"Good afternoon, Sir Malfoy." She said quietly bowing slightly at the waist, Draco couldn't remember her name even though she had been working in the manor at least a month. Though he was gratefully spared as she continued on "Your parents have requested your presence in your father's office." Draco restrained himself from groaning, though his friends didn't do the same.
There is a moment of stillness between them and just as quickly as he had been filled with hope does it leave him with a pit in his stomach. She pulls back, the smile gone from her face. "I only hoped.."Draco trails off looking away in embarrassment.
He's struggling to float an ivy up to balance on top of the shelf when the door swings open and he jumps nearly flinging the plant at the door. But instead of an irate Potter he is met with a smug looking Pansy. She managed to catch the plant with her own floating charm just before it hit her and Draco huffs and pulls it from her charm shoving it onto the shelf. "Somebody is a little jumpy!" She laughs "I was coming to see if you and Potter have killed one another yet but I wasn't expecting to be attacked by a plant!" She says with a grin.
"Well, you'll have to" She says with a shrug.
For a moment the image of his father in a cell pops into his brain and he quickly pushes it away. Thinking of his father in Azkaban does nothing but make him sad. He would much prefer to think of his father before the war, when it was just him and his parents. They seemed so in love when he was young. He couldn't have imagined anything ripping them apart before the war. But now his mother is all alone in the manor with only the house elves as company. They'd lost nearly all of their friends after the dark lord's death. People immediately wanted to distance themselves and pretend that they were never associated with them or the dark lord. It was hardest on Narcissa as she had always enjoyed throwing lavish parties for purebloods, but nowadays nobody shows. The last one was tragic to say the least and she refused to come out of her room for several days after. Mentally he reminds himself to write to her.
They choose a modest little inn for the night which everyone tried to gripe about as little as possible. All of them are used to luxury as a standard so even some of the nicest inns on diagon alley would have been considered subpar. Every single one of them tossed and turned all night though this was partially due to the fear of being caught. To be caught  even before they got to the party would be devastating. They desperately need faster transportation first thing in the morning. The carriage can only go so fast and if they don't want to get caught brooms would be their best bet.
He tells his mother about how he saved the muggleborn girl, how they put in the paper that they said he was imperiused. He wrote that he would double his efforts to fix their legacy, he would do everything she said, he would smile at muggleborns and be as friendly as he could possibly be.
"Can't I just wear my own cloaks? I've got spares in my trunk." He says tapping his pocket and for a horrifying moment he doesn't feel it only to check his other pocket and feel the small lump.
e in and-" She starts sarcastically but Draco cuts in.
Draco shakes his head and drops himself onto Pansy's bed "Diabolical" he says reaching for the firewhiskey, the letter in his pocket for the moment forgotten. He takes a drink, the liquid burning down his throat.
He'd never been rejected by anyone until that first day of school when Harry decided he'd pick that freckled faced blood traitor over him. It was unthinkable to him that he would do something so foolish. He'd believed that Harry would come around, but he never did. It was strange  to watch him over the years.  Harry nearly died numerous times and somehow he still seemed undeniably happy. He smiles so easily and Draco had always been envious of that. He always found himself searching for Potter at meals and he seemed to always be smiling or laughing. It made him jealous, though he would never have admitted to it out loud. He's never been that carefree for a single moment in his life. His restraint has been ingrained in him every day of his life. It's not as if he refuses to be happy, it's simply that after all these years he doesn't know how.
"I'm going to take a shower. You should..fix that" He says gesturing toward the wall and internally cringing at himself. As he passes his desk he shuts off the heat for his potions before he slips into the bathroom. He can feel Harry's eyes on him and if he could just hex him this would be so much easier.
He was assigned his room first and dismissed from the great hall and he waited anxiously for his roommate, still holding out hope that it might be one of his friends. But  as soon as Potter walked into the his heart sunk. There was an immediate palpable tension in the air. His fingers itch to grab his wand, to strike first, but he holds back. Harry hasn't attacked him and he can't act as rashly as he has in the past. Without his family's power behind him he has to tread carefully.
It doesn't matter if he was the worst deatheater in the world, he was still a deatheater. Anybody that saw his arm wouldn't see how he was manipulated and forced into hurting people to protect his family. They wouldn't know the constant fear of having the dark lord living in your own home. They would only see a soldier for the dark lord.
"Draco, it's okay. You're far away from home, you don't have to be perfect." Goyle says sitting next to him in the grass. He tries to take control of his breaths and he scrubs his palms against his eyes. "Sorry" He says quietly feeling ashamed of himself. "Don't be. Come on, we'll go find an inn and make the rest of the trip in the morning." Crabbe says pulling Draco to his feet. He nods quietly refusing to look anyone in the eye as he crosses his arms over his bare chest.
Instead of going to his last class of the day he skips hoping he can beat Harry to their dorm and be out before class is over. As soon as he closes the door behind him he throws himself onto his bed. He's ready to sleep, preferably through the rest of the year. He sighs flipping over to look at his plants hanging above him. Some of their leaves have started to wilt from lack of water and he feels mildly guilty. He's been so caught up with everything that he's neglected them.
Clearly not wanting to admit having not gone through any paperwork left for her Umbridge smiles and nods. "Of course." She says then turns her attention to the unconcious child wanting to quickly change the subject. "It seems clear the diagnoses here." She says and Pomfrey nods. "Clearly he has the illness. He is stable now but-"
As he gets back to his dorm he's grateful that Harry is nowhere to be found. Instead there is a familiar grey owl perched on his windowsill. He pushes the window open to let in his mother's owl who has a note and a package attacked to it. He digs through his trunk until he finds a snack and tosses it to the bird. Then quickly he unties the letter and present.
Crabbe sighed and when he finally looked at Draco his expression was steely. "We talked about it on the way over and he may be a drunkard, but he's right." This pushed Goyle to speak up too.
"You know pureblood rules." She says shaking her head. "You can't be with him." And something in her voice makes him look up. A certain yearning that makes him feel a little less alone. But just as quickly as it appeared does it disappear. They look at one another for a moment and Draco tries to figure out if he had truly heard what he'd heard. "Who is it?" He asks but herexpression has turned stoney. "You know your place and I know mine." She says sternly.
He tries to focus on the book but his mind won't stop racing. No matter how hard he tries he feels fidgety and anxious. He bounces his leg trying to force himself to read but it's no use. Even under normal circumstances he disliked studying in the library. It feels far too open, as if someone might sneak up on him from anywhere. He much preferred reading on his bed surrounded by his plants, though that was far more relaxing when he was with other slytherins.
This is an all consuming question. He can't so much as glance in Harry's direction without feeling his face heat up. To his overwhelming embarrassment he catches the eyes of a muggleborn girl staring at him. He instinctually wants to cover his cheeks but instead he lies his head down on his resk hiding his face. His stomach churns and he wants to scream but he can still hear the piano and the picture of Harry playing won't leave his mind. It bothers him, he shouldn't be feeling anything but hatred for Harry. They're enemies, they always have been. But for some reason Harry won't leave his head. As soon as class is done he bolts for the door, needing to be as far away from Harry as possible.
He looks away when Harry circles to his side pretending as if dropping in his lavender buds needs all of his attention. "What are you making?" He asks and the overwhelming suspicion that is normally in his voice is only slightly present. Though he's thankful that Harry doesn't want to talk about the fact that he'd said something nearly human it feels strange to hear him speak so casually.
He stands beginning to pace across the room "Pansy! I liked him the whole time! What the fuck?" He cries running a hand through his hair anxiously. "Draco, relax." She says standing with him and grabbing his arm to keep him still. "If you've liked him so long then what's one more year?" She asks pulling him into a hug. He slouches resting his head on her shoulder. "I'm an idiot." He groans and she sighs patting his back.
"You had it this whole time?" He asks feeling his temper flare. He snatches his wand back and Harry shrugs. His nonchalance at the whole situation only fuels his anger more. Harry grumbles something in a bitter tone then falls into bed. Draco wants to say something, maybe get a rise out of him. But that hadn't ended well last time. With a sigh he goes to lie down in bed wishing the school year could already be over.
As soon as the sun starts to rise and the shops along diagon alley begin opening each of them roll out of bed. They griped every step of the way complaining about every minor inconvenience but upon arriving at the shops they split up in different directions. Blaise went to get shrinking trunks, Crabbe and Goyle split up on the hunt for food while Draco went for brooms and Pansy headed to get them all different clothes. They were supposed to meet up with Pansy as soon as they were finished to be properly fitted.
It's a relief to find that nobody is waiting for them back at the inn. But surely they would get there quickly "Whose parents do you think sent them?" Blaise says with a rueful laugh as he pulls himself through the window of their room and nearly falls to the ground.They had thought it better to climb in through the window just in case there were people waiting to attack them. But now knowing there's nobody inside it feels silly to do so. "Not mine." Crabbe says trying to pull his broom in after him. "Mine either." Goyle says scrambling inside and throwing his things into one of the shrinking trunks. "That leaves the happy couple." Blaise says looking to Draco and Pansy.
He moves to the window absently handing a treat to the owl. He was hoping it might be Crabbe or Goyle saying their goodbyes but instead it's his mother. It is a letter scrawled quickly, he can hardly recognize her handwriting. Where it is normally curling with care it looks messy and almost haphazard. She has continually grown colder towards him and were it not for her name on the envelope and the familiar slant of her letters he might think it was forged by someone else.
"Yes, a convention!" She says smiling and nodding even though she doesn't know what that means. "We're just passing through" She says reaching into her robes for her wand. Then before the poor guy knows what has happened she casts a memory charm on him and leans over the desk to grab a key before he comes out of his daze. She snatches a map off of the desk and hurries everyone away before he realizes something is amiss.
"I can't help it! Just all of a sudden-" She suddenly laughs and he glares daggers at her "What are you talking about? You've liked him for years!" She says and he shakes his head "No I haven't!" He says crossing his arms suddenly defensive. "I just saw him playing piano and he was shirtless and I-"
Harry Potter is the last person he expected to be his roommate. He'd dared to hope for Pansy, Blaise, or Crabbe as they were of a very small portion of students that could stand him. But upon arrival they were informed by the newly appointed Headmistress Mcgonagall that due to the fact that so many students were unable to finish their OWLS and NEWTS last year there was a spike in students. Paired with the fact that many rooms were still under construction, they were forced to convert some of the unused rooms into temporary dorms.
Now that he's aware of it he can't stop thinking about it. Each time Harry turns or speeds up even slightly he can see where whatever it is that he's using to keep them concealed drag up and reveal their feet. He has to keep scurrying forward because the idea of getting caught is nearly as bad as the thought of centaurs capturing him.
He should be rethinking his plan to run away, but the more thought he puts into it the more he's sure of his decision. Splashing water over his face he looks at his reflection in the mirror for a moment. He is tempted to muss his hair but his mother would fuss about it for at least an hour if she saw him. There's no need to draw unnecessary attention to himself anyways. He brushes it back then goes to pack his things.
Ron stands suddenly from his seat. "They haven't thrown you in azkaban yet?" He yells angrily but she continues to smile. "This detention will be a family affair I see. A detention for you as well Mr.Weasley." And she is just about to speak again when another voice breaks in. "Maybe you'd prefer a walk through the forbidden forest!" And although Harry seems to have disappeared Draco has fought with him enough over the years to know his voice. This one seems to rattle her and her smile dims for a moment before it is forced back. "Who was that?" She says in a clipped tone and when nobody steps forward. She says tersely, "The forbidden forest is forbidden for a reason!" Then her smile returns brighter than ever.
There is a long silence as they look to one another they come to a collective agreement. "We'll help." Goyle says and Draco breaks into a grin. It's then that the sound of footsteps reaches the room and each of them quickly sit down again trying to look innocent.
Of course the dark lord was framed as the hero in their version, and the boy who lived, the villain. He was seen as a destroyer. He killed voldemort, he ruined all they worked so hard to build. He brought filth into the pureblood world. He'd believed it for a long  time, and even as he got older he resented Harry. He was admittedly obsessed the first few years of school. He wanted to hate him with every fiber of his being. It felt as though it should have been as easy to hate him as it was to hate the stories of him. But putting a face to a fairytale villain makes them a lot less scary. Particularly when this villain is just a scrawny kid whose best weapon is a sharp tongue.
He'd never been able to cast a patronus, not even a whisp. But standing before him is a fully grown stag that Harry conjured as if it was nothing. He is almost tempted to say something complimentary but when he opens his mouth Harry snatches his arm and begins dragging him back to school.
"What about you? How'd it go with Potter?" Blaise questions as Crabbe rubs the back of his head. Draco shrugs, he'd truthfully expected to end the night in a duel. "It was surprisingly uneventful other than a single hex." He says "From him, or you?"Blaise asks with a sly grin.
He isn't one to apologize but he knows he should. Especially considering Harry might have just saved his life. "Potter-" He says quietly but Harry cuts him off "Shut up" Harry says pushing Draco's hand from his waist as they reach the stairs. Draco's jaw clenches with annoyance but they walk up the stairs silently. Once they reach their room Harry carefully opens the door and upon entering he reaches into his pocket. "Your wand" he says holding out Draco's wand.
The shop keeper looks haughty as she pins Pansy's cloak. "It's a simple request, I'm just asking you to cut the cloak in a mens pattern." Pansy huffs but the shopkeeper shakes her head. "I vill not." She says in a thick accent "You are a lady, so you vill dress like a lady." She says firmly and Pansy sighs "I'm not paying for a women's cut!" She huffs tugging at the cloak where pins are lined. The shopkeeper smacks her hand away. "Trust, you vill be so preety" She says and smiles though Pansy doesn't smile back.
"I never said that!" Draco huffs trying to keep the defensiveness out of his tone as he stands from his bed. He sighs running a hand through his hair unsure how to remedy the situation. "I'm watching you, Malfoy. " Harry growls moving in close to whisper "If you try anything then I won't hesitate." A strange mix of fear and desire washes over Draco followed by overwhelming confusion. He looks into Harry's eyes his jaw clenched as he forces himself not to look away.
"I'm absolutely terrified. But I've gotta start making decisions for my own life at some point." They talk amongst themselves about the future but Draco can't seem to bring himself to speak. If he let himself choose his life then what would it look like?
"Did you bring alcohol? We're nearly out." Pansy says pouting as she pulls out a bottle of firewhiskey that had been haphazardly hidden under a pillow upon his arrival. When he shakes his head she groans dramatically and falls back onto her bed. "You ignore us then don't even bring firewhiskey?" She grumbles clearly already drunk."I..uh, I'm sorry about that." He say haltingly. He's always hated apologizing but the situation warrants it. "My mom told me to stop talking to you guys-"
"Oh yes of course I just have a few more questions." He says pushing even more. "Do you know the girl, or did you see any-"
"Come on Pansy" Draco groans but she crosses her arms turning up her nose at him. "You're a selfish inconsiderate prat who has no concept of-" She stops when he slides the vial in front of her.
"Yes, of course I do" He says, genuinely troubled and when he reaches out to touch her arm she glances over at him and sighs. "How am I supposed to be mad at you when you look like a wounded puppy?" She grumbles pulling her arm away. "Whatever. I told you, so whether you're going to say goodbye to them is your choice." Then she turns and storms off. He sighs trying not to feel guilty but failing miserably. It isn't until he pushes open his door that he remembers why he was wary to go back to his dorm.
"We can only hope it won't backfire." She says with a shrug folding up the paper. "She didn't tell you?" She asks and Draco shakes his head. "Typical. We fight in a war and we're still not considered grown up enough to hear our parents plans." She huffs and Draco looks at her curiously, eager to push the article out of his mind.
"What's that?" He asks looking curiously at the potions. He's always loved potions and if anything can distract him then this is it. "Drimuff" She says double checking before putting it into Mary's iv. "Isn't that to ward away dreams?" He asks and she nods. "That's right." She says flicking the next one she has to wait for the last of the drimuff to drain before she adds it. "It'll help keep her from falling too deeply into sleep and hopefully wake her in time."
He often found himself holding his wand in the same way in when the dark lord was living in the manor. Every noise in the night made him jump and even after he was defeated it still plagued him at times. Draco had to wonder if he was the reason Harry was doing this. He decidedly left the potion just in case he'd take it and went back to bed.
The table is only brought out for the worst of offenses. If there is a chance they might be disowned arrested or killed the plan was always hatched around the table which has been lovingly dubbed Cunt's Counter. Tonight's suggestion is particularly heinous, not just because it was worse than most things they'd done before, but this time they have refused to let Draco bow out.
"The Weaslette has always had a temper." He says with a dry laugh "At least it wasn't Granger." He says with a shrug, and Pansy chuckles looking back at Draco. "I wouldn't want her to punch me" She says laughing and Draco sighs in exasperation. "That was ONE TIME!" He huffs but Pansy continues to laugh.
They smile politely at one another though they both know it's only a facade. Draco extends his hand to her under the watchful eye of his father. "Would you care to dance?" He asks with a bow and lightly she places her hand in his "That would be splendid, thank you" She chirps and it would have almost been convincing if he didn't know she was just as trapped by this arrangement as he is.
He looks around once more and starts in the direction he thinks he came from. Everything looks the same and with every step twigs crack underfoot and he's certain he'll be attacked. He can hardly breathe as he moves through the forest. His eyes trace along what would be the horizon were it not for the gnarled trees surrounding him in every direction. There isn't a trace of light to tell him the way back to hogwarts.
"Potter" He says by way of greeting and it sounds harsher than he'd intended. He is met with a scowl and a disdainful "Malfoy" spat back at him. There is a moment is silence and it feels as though his wand is burning a hole in his pocket. "I'm unarmed, if you intend to hex me then get it over with, golden boy." He says trying to keep him tone flat though there is the hint of a snarl that he can't quite rid himself of.
This year however, is different. He can no longer follow in his father's footsteps and instead has to forge his own path. In the time between the end of the war and the start of the school year he settled upon the job of potioneer, specializing in alchemy. He's always been gifted with potions and alchemy is highly respected. It's difficult enough that there won't be much competition and if he were to make a breakthrough there is the possibility that it could outshadow his past.
"Draco could undoubtedly annoy him into leaving. Merlin knows he's always such a prat." Pansy says but at this Blaise brightens. "Do you think you could?" He asks and Pansy smiles smugly.
"Hey! No fighting! We're leaving tomorrow so can we be civil for one night?" Crabbe says waving an arm between Blaise and Pansy.
They don't speak through three more dances but Draco's feet are starting to ache and surely hers do as well. He smiles politely and holds out his hand once the song is finished. "Would you care to join me for a stroll in the garden?" He asks with a falsely chipper tone.
"If it makes it any better, they were probably aiming for me." Draco says leaning back in his seat. "You're a slytherin, but you didn't directly aid the dark lord." He says looking over at the books along the shelf.
As he went back to his room he wondered if she had ever considered running away. Though even if she had there's no chance she would ever admit to it. He quickly changes out of his wet clothes and into a another suit. It's just as stiff and uncomfortable but it won't draw attention to himself. Just as he's throwing on his cloak he hears his door open and is unsurprised to see Blaise slip inside. He is grinning "What a perfect diversion!" He whispers delighted and it makes Draco smile. It wasn't intended to be a diversion but it's genius nonetheless. "Everything is ready, we should head out before anyone comes looking for you." He says peeking out into the hall just to be sure he wasn't followed.
There were several snide comments thrown their way. Draco had to grip Pansy's arm to keep her from replying. But when a hex whizzed between them they quickly decided to take refuge in the library. Just a few halls away they slip between the shelves to find a table hidden away from the rest. They sit heavily on the chairs, already feeling tired. "That's the second hex today" Pansy huffs dropping her head in her hands. "I don't know if I'll survive to the end of term."
Surprised by the outburst Draco stuttered looking shocked "I- well- you know I can't-" Draco said haltingly, but Crabbe cut him off.
It's a long letter which shows just how lonely she is at home. Nearly three pages of almost nothing but complaining about the house elves and questions about school. However she does say near the end. "I know for a long time your father and I told you not to smile. I don't want you to worry so much about your dimples showing through. I found a stronger potion for you that will last longer." This is followed by several lines complaining about the house elf who took so long to get it. Then she ends the letter by saying "I want you to smile more, particularly with our enemies. Let them see that the war ending has not phased you. The mudbloods want to see you miserable and I simply won't allow it. You want them on your side so you should distance yourself from your friends for the time being. Instead smile at mudbloods, smile at blood traitors, smile so much that your cheeks begin to hurt. Because you my love are the shining future of the pureblood legacy." He opens the box to reveal two pearly potions tucked inside. It's unclear to him whether to feel happy or be crushed under the weight of his mother's expectations. The idea of her encouraging him to smile feels ridiculous but his mother's name is at the bottom of the letter in her swooping signature.
"Only around you" He says and Harry stops drawing for a moment to squint at him. "I honestly can't tell when you're joking." He says and at this Draco shrugs. "It's an art"
which would have made him far more comfortable. Harry leans down and sniffs the sleep potion "Smells nice" he says a bit awkwardly and there is an intense urge to shove him away. He needs to be far away from Harry. His heart is beating fast and his palms have grown sweaty. Everything in him is screaming to grab his wand and hex him.
"Studying" He says absently trying to wave Harry away. "Homework" He says stretching over to poke Draco in the arm with the end of what Draco has learned is called a pencil. "You can do your portrait next" He says and Draco sighs turning toward Harry "Fine, ten minutes." He says turning toward Harry.
"Maybe I'll just go cry about it to moaning myrtle because you've got the emotional intelligence of a toddler." She shoves her chair in and there is a loud shhhhh in the distance but Pansy pays no attention. "A basic level of empathy is all I'm asking for." She hisses then storms away.
There is an uproar from the students but Draco can only feel relief that his mother's plan doesn't involve murder. He turns intending to share this with one of his friends but he deflates when he sees sitting beside him instead a second year he hasn't spoken to more than once. He feels a pang of regret in ignoring his friends, but if he were to try to talk to them now then they'll want an explanation that he doesn't have. Mcgonagall waits until the student body quiets, her eyes scanning over the crowd. Draco isn't sure if her eyes linger on him for a split second longer than anyone else or if he is just imagining it. There are still murmurs but she speaks above them. "Due to the number and severity of injuries on hogwarts grounds I have been forced to step down from my post. The ministry has sent a replacement and I hope that all of you will take this news in stride." The last portion has to be spoken loudly to be heard over the students.
"Thank you for covering for me." Draco says trying to shift her attention slightly from her frustration. Pomfrey shakes her head slightly "It's not a cover. I fully expect you to be my apprentice, I'll draw up the papers as soon as I'm done here." She says tapping the boy with her wand to check for any other cuts. She flits her hand in front of Draco and he pulls his hands away from the former gash. It is mostly healed over by whatever potions she gave him and she leans in to inspect it. "I didn't realize you were serious..I- I have classes and lots of studying and-" He says trying to think up an excuse but she holds up a hand to cut him off. "You'll live. And it'll look good on your resume if you want to be an alchemist, though I still don't think it's the most practical use of potioneer training." He is quiet for a moment thinking it over.
"I'm pretty sure you could give me your entire inheritance and it still wouldn't be enough." She says laughing and he groans grabbing his pillow and chucking it at her. "What are friends for if not to pretend to be you when your life is hard?" He says jokingly and she juts out her bottom lip in faux pity before throwing his pillow back and flopping down on his bed as well.
"Keep quiet and stay under the cloak" Harry whispers grabbing Draco's arm and pulling him up. He inspects a paper for a moment
"What if..what if maybe I liked someone that I probably shouldn't and-" He says fidgeting as he speaks but she cuts him off to say "You like Potter don't you?" And his horrified silence only confirms her suspicions. "Draco, why now? Do you enjoy making things harder for yourself?"
He has decidedly chosen to ignore how close Harry and Ginny are sitting. It makes his stomach twist with jealousy, which he refuses to actually acknowledge. But it's not just jealousy of Ginny, but all of them. Even when he was at the height of his popularity he couldn't claim he had so many friends. There were people who wanted to be close to him, use him for his family's power. Or they had the misguided notion that he could somehow protect them from the dark lord. But aside from Crabbe, Goyle, Blaise and Pansy he couldn't claim a single other friend. He watches from over his textbook as the group talks animatedly, big smiles plastered across their faces.
"No! I already told you, your cloaks are too expensive we wouldn't even be allowed through the gates." Pansy says as they make their way down the hall of identical doors.
"Are you alright dear?" Draco's head snaps up suddenly alert, ready to fight at the drop of a pin. But Madam Pomfrey is looking at him worriedly and he swallows down his anger and all the emotions within himself. He lets his expression glaze over to a cool neutrality and says as evenly as he can manage "I'm fine, thank you." Though his voice catches on the last word he turns to flee.
Draco avoids the golden trio like they're the plague all day. There seemed to be a bit less hatred for him today and he dislikes the idea that it could be because of the article. It feels as though everyone should realize that its entirely lies. He willingly took the dark mark, just like his father. He did what he could for Voldemort even if in the end it wasn't much. To think anyone could misconstrue that feels wrong. He did what he did and though he is ashamed there should be no reason for him to deny it.
"She's good company and she seems to be just as unhappy as me." He says hoping it will end there but knowing it won't. The three of them walk down the halls and Blaise whispers "Are you mad? She'll turn on us in a heartbeat" and Draco looks up over to her and she is grinning marching down the hall with purpose even though she has no clue which way to go.
He didn't really want to say that his mother had forced him to attend these classes even though it was the truth. But as he is about to answer a light shines across the room and Draco jumps going for his wand until he realized that the light created a picture of a woman on the board in front of the class. He twists in his seat trying to find the source but he hears Harry laugh and he turns back glaring. The professor starts talking about someone named Leonardo DaVinci, a very muggle name, and Draco slumps in his seat annoyed.
"Electricity, gravity, there are counter weights or something." Pansy says with a shrug as it dings for the second floor. "It's safe, promise." She says looking back at her map. When they reach the third floor she folds it up with a sigh. "This town is truly muggle, I'm not sure what we can do about your cloak." She says stepping out of the elevator only to have the others rush out around her still slightly nervous about the safety of the elevator.
But as luck would have it just ad he reaches the doors to the kitchens a hand clasps around his shoulder. Dread settles in his stomach but he plasters on a neutral which is truly as chipper as he can manage as he turns to face his father. "Pansy Parkinson has just arrived, you're  to be a gentleman to her" He says adjusting Draco's tie. "This is an important arrangement for our families. It will keep our bloodline pure and it will be good for business." At this Draco wants to spit back a protest. He wants to ask if that is all he is worth? How long has this been planned without his knowledge? But instead he simply says "Yes father" quietly.
"Shut up, you're not forgiven." Harry hisses. "Just because I don't want anyone else to die doesn't mean you can get away with whatever you want." Harry says pulling Draco roughly as they weave through the trees. As he's pulled this way and that he stays silent, aside from the occasional grunt as his shoulder as he is dragged into hitting a tree. He has a sneaking suspicion that most of these are intentional.
He already knows he will get a letter from his mother telling him he should let her take him under her wing. What better way to get ministry support than be well liked by a ministry official, particularly one who is so gifted with bending the truth. He can only hope for his own sanity that that letter will never arrive.
Harry has always seemed out of reach. He was always too noble, too honest, too brave. But he can see the small smile turning up his lips and he can feel his own face growing hot. He swallows, quickly looking away but his eyes continue to flicker back. He can feel himself smiling but he can't stop it. Even if he could, he wouldn't really want to. He doesn't have the words to explain why his heart is beating so erratically or why he's smiling but it feels right.
He practices his smile as he puts on his suit, though it feels like shackles. Once its all on he looks at himself in the mirror. He is handsome, but it doesn't feel right. He tugs at the sleeves wishing he could leave right this minute. But he sighs and puts on his favorite cufflinks preparing himself to feign happiness. There's no way he could do this for the rest of his life. He would be miserable, and if he's being honest with himself, he was always miserable.
Harry glances up from his papers not even acknowledging the piercing glare from Draco. "Ginny, Luna" he says holding up a notebook. "Gimme a hand?" He asks and Ginny sends Draco a scathing look before she gathers up her papers and crams herself onto the bed next to Harry. Luna on the other hand looks at him for a moment then says "You really should do something about all of those frimbles" She says in her dreamy voice before she moves from his bed.
The servant girl scurried off to the kitchens and he was left alone. As he walked he noticed just how busy it was around the castle. Servants were running about everywhere and when he passed the main ballroom he realized that it had been cleaned top to bottom. There were currently candles being spelled to hang midair and a little house elf was furiously scrubbing the marble floors. How blind had he been not to notice? A young man came running through the hall, so focused on his destination and not dropping the wine glasses that he was balancing on trays of each of his arms that he nearly ran straight into Draco and he had to dodge out of the way. He murmured an apology before rushing off down the hall. Draco grows increasingly curious as he approaches his father's office.
that was just friendly rivalry?" She asks incredulously. He stares at her a moment ".....Yes?" He says slowly beginning to feel unsure himself. She gives him a pointed look and his brain seems to sluggishly click things into place. "Oh god...I...I've liked him the whole time" He says horrified as he thinks over the last few years. All the times they've fought and the way his heart would race whenever Harry was around. It's easy to pretend that it's anger, hate, maybe even fear, because having a crush is pretty forgein to him. It seems to mundane, such s simple and pure thing that is oh so dangerous.
Once they're out of sight she stops in front of a set of doors and presses a button. She quickly unfolds the map looking over the shops scattered around. When the doors open she steps in without a second thought only looking up when she doesn't hear the others behind her. "Come on" She says waving them in and when they loiter just outside of the doors she sighs putting her hand out to hold it open. "It's an elevator. Just get in." She huffs and they slowly shuffle inside. She looks down at the room key then presses the third floor. "It moves, don't freak out." She says in a bland tone but as soon as the doors close and they start to move the rest of them clutch at the railings in a panic.
"Do you really think being expected to save the wizarding world didn't come with pressure?" Harry spit back back at him suddenly matching Draco's anger.
He sits for a moment turning the bottles over in his hand and he sighs. Not only does she expect him to befriend muggleborns but she also wants him to distance himself from the only friends he's ever had. He wants nothing more in this moment than to have Crabbe and Goyle over like old times. But with Goyle dead it wouldn't feel the same." He sighs and burns his mother's letter, something he grew accustom to during the war. She has always had his best interests at heart and at great cost she has tried to protect him. But right now there's no way of knowing what the right thing to do is. Everything he has been asked to do goes against everything he was raised to be.
Young men of a certain gentry are expected to act in a manner that will reflect well upon their family. The heir of an aristocrat does not live a life that is their own. The eldest daugters of nobility are married off for money and land, they are expected to bear pureblooded children, preferably sons. Eldest sons are to be perfect imitations of their fathers and they are to marry noble girls that they may not like, who often do not like them in return. He will marry for her dowery, and she will marry for his nobility. Then they have children and their children marry people they do not like out of familial duty and so on and so forth. Each of them carry the burden of not only their own life but the legacy of their family as well. It is a blessing in disguise to be the heir to a fortune. When you are an heir you are treated to the best food, the best wine, the best clothes, yet expected to perform perfectly in every aspect of life. You must be well read, well spoken, cultured, poised, all while keeping your wits about you.
"What are you doing here?" He hisses hearing the hooves drawing closer. He looks nervously back wanting desperately to run.
He closes his door with a sigh and everything grows silent. If he simply stayed in his room he could pretend that none of this was happening. But the clothes laid out on his bed refuse to let him forget who he was and the obligations he had to his family. He lifts the coat looking over the fine silk lining the inside. He touches it gently running his thumb along the seam. They're truly beautiful clothes and it's a shame that they're going to be marred by such a gruesome occasion.
"I can't see properly back there." He says tapping the kid who sighs with relief and snatches his things and switches seats with  murmured thanks. The teacher watches for a moment seeming confused as to what just happened. But after a moment decides to start the lesson.
"I don't know how we're going to live together." Draco sighs slouching down onto his bed. "We've never gotten along, and I don't see it starting now."
"Maybe a little, but you've got one more year and that's all." She says again backing away so that he'll lift his head to look at him. "One more year and the most interaction you'll have with Potter are a few awkward words in passing." Draco is silent for a moment and her smile is so warm and open that he has to look away. The thought of Potter, someone who has spent his years obsessing over, someone who is brave and strong and everything that Draco isn't makes his heart ache. "What if I don't want that?" He says quietly and her smile falls.
He's always been able to avoid muggle studies. Every single year his parents would find a way to get him out of it, which was welcomed at the time. But this year she'd said "The dark lord is truly dead, so you have to win the trust of the mudbloods." She left no room for argument as she continued. "You need to understand them if you ever intend to use them." Which as foreboding as it may sound made absolute sense to Draco. If their name is to rise again then he'll have to play nice with muggleborns to get there. Though, it feels wrong that she was the one pushing him toward muggle subjects when for years his parents forbid him from so much as thinking about anything muggle. As a child he didn't even believe that they existed. He'd never even had more than a minute of conversation with a muggle as far as he knew. Though this had once been a source of pride it now only feels like a detriment to him.
"Meaning you were bigoted" Harry says in far too casual tone. It takes him by surprise and Harry watches him with a calculating gaze. He can't help but squirm uncomfortably. It's strange to think about his beliefs and how harmful they have been. He wants to hold on to his family's values but the undeniable truth is that they are rooted in pureblood supremacy.
Though after the war, something he had never considered was how their relationship might change. He'd expected Harry to take a job as an auror and that in the future they would only interact in passing. Perhaps an awkward conversation or two. He would see Harry on the streets and either they would avoid one another or perhaps a small nod would pass between them. At the very least he expected not to see him during the entirety of his seventh year. With his parents in azkaban he had to do everything in his power to recover their reputation, and the lack of distraction was a welcome change. But something he didn't expect was to get to hogwarts for his seventh year only to find that Harry Potter is his new roommmate.
He's never had to pack for himself, he'd always had the servants do it for him but now is as good a time as any to start. He grabs two bags that are small enough to carry and sits them on his bed beside his suit. Then he quickly begins filling them. He has to pack and repack three times to decide what he should be bringing with him. It consists of mostly clothes and money though there are a few trinkets he can't bear to part with. Looking over the bags he nods in satisfaction then hides them under his bed. He'll have to ask Crabbe hide them near the stables before the party.
"I thought I was the hero!" Draco screams, his wand pressing into Harry's chest and his voice is shaking with anger and unshed tears. "They told me I would be a hero! That the wizarding world would be safer without mudbloods-"
He's so wrapt in his own spiraling that he only realizes the teacher has asked a question when several hands shoot up. She waves over one of the students and gestures to an old piano near him. He's familiar with these and had always assumed they were a wizard invention, though they simply played by themselves in his own home. It seems for the best as the boy struggles through a simple song and quickly runs back to his chsir with a bright red face. The teacher seems unbothered though and simply waves up the next student. She plays another song he's unfamiliar with it's not bad but her face is strained as she tries to rwmeember where to place her fingers.
"That's not-" He starts but Pansy cuts him off "Men are so typical!" She hisses as she forces her shoes back on. "I only kissed you because I'm scared" He says so swiftly the words seem to bleed together "I'm just scared" He repeats and Pansy turns to look at him with a calculating gaze. And after a moment she nods "I would ask what it is you're afraid of but I suppose I already know" She sighs then she frowns at her pinched feet. "You owe me your arm for kissing me" She says waving him over so she can take his arm and pull weight from her feet. "You don't seem to be afraid." He says thankful that she doesn't seem angry with him. But it's clear to him that his interest in her isn't romantic nor sexual by nature.
"How is it doing that?" Goyle asks backing himself into a corner.
"Draco," She says when she has gotten comfortable. "What do you think happened to that girl?" She asks and Draco sighs tugging at a loose thread in his sheets.
"You may be shocked to know that I'm not an awful person." Draco says, though he isn't sure of that but he sidesteps again and Harry moves with him. "I didn't do anything wrong, so just leave me alone." He side steps again now close enough to the door. "Now if you don't mind, golden boy" he spits the name like it is made of venom. "I'll be going" he says quickly grabbing the door and slipping out smoothly. He walks quickly down the hall just in case Harry decides to follow.
To think his mother would do something so drastic without so much as informing him is unsurprising. He's never been kept in the loop when it comes to his parents plans. He hardly even knows how they make their money much less what they plan for his own life. You would think he would get some say in it but that has never been the case.
"You will meet her tonight, at the party, and we plan for you to be married within the month." His father said in an even tone meant to calm him, but he has never felt less calm.
"Saving you, you ungrateful little git" Harry spits holding his stomach as he straightens himself. "I think I'll leave you here instead"
She goes back to flip through clothes and he sighs looking with her. "What about this?" He asks pulling out a black piece of clothing he doesn't quite understand how to wear but he's already tired of shopping. "You want to wear that?" She asks seeming surprised "It would show your knees! The scandal!" She says laughing. He looks at the fabric confused. She shakes her head "It's a skirt, it's kimd of like the bottom part of a dress." She says laughing once more
As she frees her hand he shakes his head "The miserable recognize the miserable, I'm sure you noticed my own lack of enthusiasm." He says unsure whether she will find it funny or take offense but she scoffs shaking her head.
"I'm sorry, I didn't address you." She says, her smile never wavering. It's disconcerting and Draco has to wonder if this is how he makes people feel at times. "Five points from ravenclaw for each of you." She says shooing them away from the bed and she then turns to Draco as the group of ravenclaws leave, several of them still looking back toward their friend.
"They're leaving?" He asks feeling his heart has sink to his stomach. Even though he has done little to interact with them at his mother's request to know that they're leaving still hurts. "When?" He asks and she rolls her eyes. "Do you really care?" She huffs still refusing to look at him.
But when he stops to listen his heart sinks. The hoof beats seem to draw closer and a panic grips him. Instantly he begins scrambling away from the sound, moving as fast as the roots jutting up from the ground will allow. He can hear the numbers grow, more and more hooves pounding against the ground as he struggles to keep from falling in the dwindling light. He rips through the forest but the noise only grows louder like thunder descending upon him.
Upon looking over the shirt he decides the color isn't horribly offensive to the eye. It is a soft pink button up shirt. He tries not to look too closely at the stitching or the lessons his mother had given him on the importance of cloak stitching will return to him. Instead he drapes it over his arm and walks along the aisle. Eventually he finds another shirt which he doesn't absolutely and brings it to Pansy who nods and says "I'm not opposed to it" instead of approving.
"You hardly even helped." She grumbles and he glares at her. "It doesn't matter what I did or I didn't do." He says as he grabs a book. "I'm going to be seen as an accomplice no matter what. I'm the one with the dark mark, remember?" He says tapping his sleeve where the mark resides.
Lucius stops in front of an ordinary looking girl with brown hair pinned intricately atop her head. When she turns he had hoped momentarily that there would be a sudden love for her. That somehow he would be so taken by her beauty that he would have a change of heart. But she could have been the most beautiful girl in the world and the urge to run would already have settled in him.
There is a hesitation before he gets up but quickly he searches through his trunk. Harry turns to look at him and then he finds it. A little vial of dreamless sleep potion. He takes the potion and places it on Harry's bedside table. He's always found it easiest to apologize with gifts. It may also be a 'please don't tell anybody that I cried and then you had to save me from centaurs' bribe. It's quite a small gift but it will have to do.
Crabbe and Goyle are both dukes with important family ties and money to spare. They're somehow loosely related to the Malfoys though neither side could quite tell you how. They've got the same sharp nose on them and have got to be at least distant cousins. Blaise is a first born although not a sole heir, he has five siblings as well as six half siblings. His father has mistresses to spare and Blaise takes after him in this regard. He could charm the clothes off of nearly anyone and he uses it to his advantage at every turn. It only makes it worse that he is atrociously handsome. He has said time and time again that if he is ever cut off, which is very likely considering how shameless he is, that he will simply find someone willing to pay for his lavish lifestyle in exchange for a good fuck. It's hard to tell whether or not he is joking or not.
"If you're not going to get to the point, then I'll tell him." His father cut in and Lucius looked back at him and he seemed strangely resolute, as if he was about to give his final offer in a long winded deal. "You have been betrothed." He says stiffly, and for a moment Draco is tempted to laugh. But when neither of his parents crack a smile a sense of dread fills him.
They walk slowly as Pansy tries to read the map. She turns it several times but insists that she knows where they're going. Having lived in London for so long the little town feels eerily quiet. Even the streets which are beautifully kept seem entirely devoid of muggles.
"Why on earth would we be kicked out for being too rich? Crabbe laughs but Pansy is entirely serious. "The whole point of the party is that anyone can go and be accepted. If people were allowed to flaunt their family wealth it would automatically create a hierarchy. People are allowed to wear anything from costumes to almost nothing and it's allowed but show up in a well fitted brand name cloak then you'll be turned away at the door." She says and stops in front of one of the doors and she quickly slides the card along a little machine and there is a click. "I doubt you have anything that's worth less than a small house." She says looking back at Draco as she walks inside.
"You should really be getting your rest after that fall I think-" Blaise starts but he stops at the sight of Pansy tipping back her glass of firewhiskey. He smirks, watching her and she promptly kicks off her heels. "There's no time to waste!" She says with mischief in her eyes as she grabs up the hem of her dress and pushes her way into the hall. Blaise looks at Draco as if he's mad though he seems taken with her brashness. "You intend to bring her?" He asks of Draco and he nods hurrying back out to the hall not wanting to argue about it.
It is squat and the door is painted a ghastly shade of orange. With trepidation the group of them follow behind Pansy. Lining the walls are clothes of different colors and sizes. In a cloak shop you get the choice of three silhouettes, several muted colors, and perhaps a few accessories. Other than cufflinks and a nice tie cloaks were meant to show craftsmanship. The soft materials, the perfectly stitched lines, it was the tiny details that mattered. Even with girls cloaks they were nearly the exact same, though they at times got to skip the cloak and opt for a gown for special occasions. But it seems these muggle clothes are full of color and every single thing is different.
He sighs and pens a letter telling her about his new classes and the irony of being roommates with Harry Potter. She'll likely tell him to try to befriend Potter at all costs, but if he were to omit that fact then it would feel like he was lying. And after thanking her for the potions and sending his love he rolled up the letter and tied it to the owl's leg.
Blaise and Draco exchange a confused look. "Did you know that?" Blaise asks and Draco shakes his head. "I knew there was someone but I had no ckue she was engaged" He says with a shrug. Crabbe and Goyle fly out of the window next. Then as Blaise climbs onto his own broom to leave there is a banging on their door. "We know you're in there! Come out now and we won't hurt ya!" The men say and Drack curses as he quickly shrinks his trunk and Blaise pushes himself out of the window waving for Draco to hurry. There is a loud thump on the door as the two men try to kick it down. There is another thud and there is a terrifying sound of wood beginning to splinter.
Pomfrey grumbles under her breath angrily as she continues her treatment of the boy. "Would she really..." Draco starts to ask but then trails off knowing that her threats aren't empty. "She would" Pomfrey huffs "I have cared for the children of this school for years and this-" her words devolve into more grumblings.
But when he peers past the door he curses under his breath seeing several large men trying to grab his friends. He hesitates a moment but if it weren't for him none of them would be here. So he takes a steadying breath grabs his wand and runs forward shooting spell after spell. He manages to jinx one of them and he can see Crabbe snatch up a broomstick. Blaise disarms another and as he scrambles for the wand he snatches up brooms for himself and Pansy. They start pushing out of the door onto the street. Goyle stuns one of them and manages to grab a broom as he hustles out. And with a quick accio the broom zooms into his hand and he ducks under the swing of a fist and out the door.
As they walk he spots Harry in the hallway and the forgiveness that he desired has vanished. Harry absolutely knows the article in the prophet is entirely lies. Forgiveness can wait for another day. He speeds up nearly dragging Pansy with him.
"Will we really?" Draco asks hating the idea of looking like a commoner. He has always looked regal or at the very least unattainably wealthy. But he is already in a carriage barreling away from his home so that life has to be behind him. "You still haven't answered how you know about Potter's party." Blaise says eyeing Pansy curiously.
"That was my mother's idea, I was just as surprised as anyone else" Draco says trying to look at Harry's face instead of his chest. "Oh of course!" Harry says sarcastically "You're never to blame, are you?"
It only takes a glimpse over the rack of clothes to recognize the men. They tower over the muggle shopkeeper and Draco gasps sharply tugging at Pansy's arm. When she spots them she curses under her breath and the both of them crouch down to hide. "How did they find us?" Draco hisses but Pansy shakes her head. "We can worry about that later, right now we've got to get out of here." She whispers and the two of them rush off to find the others.
They jog the rest of the way there to catch up. Upon arriving they can immediately tell this town is entirely muggle. It's entirely devoid of a broomsticks propped at doorways, of house elves scurrying around to do chores and the lights in the houses don't have the flicker of flames lighting them from the inside. They look curiously at the little houses as they pass every once in a while seeing the figure of a muggle through a window. Pansy rolls her eyes as they point out things that would be normal to muggles.
"To who?" Blaise asks standing with a huff. "You've hardly even started courting!" He cries and Draco nods slowly. He is more surprised than any of them but it has yet to settle within him. "Her name is Pansy and we're to be married within the month" And this statement is met with even more indignant yelling. They talk over one another about the injustice of it but Draco's expression turns resolute as his numbness begins to subside and he is only left with burning rage. "We're hosting a ball tonight and I'm supposed meet her-" there is a rise of chatter but Draco speaks over them. "That means one of you needs to ready the horses, we'll be heading to that party before the end of the night"
He goes to clean up the vials and in that moment he realizes that for the first time in a long time that he's happy. It's a conflicted happiness, but happiness nonetheless. When he returns Pomfrey is checking through paperwork. "I need all the help I can get, so as soon as you're cleared to be my apprentice then I want you here at the very least twice a week for several hours." Draco nods looking down at the unconcious boy in bed. "You'll probably see me before then" He says and when she looks up at him she smiles. "I know." And something about it makes him feel a pinch of pride. "You should head to class now" she says and Draco shuffles his feet not really wanting to leave. He shoves his hands into his pockets surprised when he feels his hand brush against a bottle before he remembers he'd made pepper up potion.
It's a relief to have them beside him, after all these years they still haven't abandoned him. He follows the servant girl as he tries not to look at the polished surfaces along the corridors. The manor is always at it's best right before a ball. Everything is polished until it's nearly blinding. "Will you be needing any assistance?" The servant asked as she opens the doors to his room and when Draco shakes his head she seems disheartened that she won't be able to escape from preparations even for a short time.
"There's not enough time!" He says looking back out into the hall where Blaise is approaching. Nobody else is around thankfully. Hopefully their absence is still unnoticed by partygoers but most notably his parents. She looks at him perplexed but he grabs her hand pulling her to her feet, this time actually sloshing firewhiskey onto the floor. She seems disgruntled and she scowls standing firm. But after a moment she seems to notice the wild look in Draco's eyes and her expression turns curious. He looks at her seriously and says "I'm choosing to be happy in this moment" echoing her words from earlier. She raises an eyebrow, her interest suddenly piqued. "What are you planning?" She whispers with a gleam in her eye.
"Draco" she says nodding to the gauze and he quickly moves to the edge of the bed to press on the wound. "Did you see who hexed him?" Pomfrey asks checking his vitals. But the girl at the foot of his bed quickly says "He wasn't hexed! He was in front of the class, everyone would have seen!" This makes Madam Pomfrey pause. "He wasn't hexed?" She asks again and several of them shake their heads. "He was having trouble with his presentation then he just fell and his head hit a chair on the way." Pomfrey looks at the comatose boy quizzically as if he is a puzzle that she can solve. She is listening to his heart when the door to the infirmirary opens once again and behind them is Headmistress Umbridge.
"It's charmed to only be accessible by broom if you're magic." She says and they look at her confused "If you're magic? Do you mean they let in muggles?" Draco asked, utterly shocked by this news. She rolls her eyes at their incredulous expressions "Only muggles who already know about the magical world like family of muggleborns."
"Shut up!" Harry hisses his hand gripping tightly against Draco's hip. It made his heart race and he fell silent as the centaurs draw closer. He is shaking slightly even though Harry seems completely unbothered by their imminent capture. His heart drops as hooves pass right beside him. He waits to be dragged out from under the cloak but the centaur passes, then another, and another. As the clopping of their hooves grows quieter Draco shoots Harry a confused look. But Harry is paying him no mind just listening intently for any more centaurs.
He fully intended to go to class, that is, until he was nearly run over by a group of ravenclaws. They plow right past him with a hexed boy bleeding and passed out levitating above them. Draco looks back at the stairs knowing he should head to class. But he can't help himself and instead he quickly begins to follow them toward the infirmirary.
He manages to grab her though he stumbles back and she promptly lets her body go limp. He hesitates but after repositioning her in his arms he rushes toward the open doors. She's hesvier than he would have thought and by the time he crashes through the doors he doesn't have to pretend to be winded "Lady Parkinson has fainted!" He says satisfied with the panic in his tone and the flurry of motion at their arrival. There are suddenly worried eyes turned toward them. His mother comes rushing forward "What happened? Oh poor dear!" She says waving over a house elf. "She fell into the fountain and-" but before he can finish Pansy is being lifted by magic from his arms. He can see her stiffen slightly but only for the fact that he knows she hasn't truly fainted.
"The Weasley girl." She snarls crossing her arms over her chest. "I insulted her family
"You haven't been caught once! What's the worst they could do to you?" Draco took a breath in, intending to list a dozen things that could potentially go wrong. But before he was able to Goyle slammed his fist on the table and it shook so violently, that it felt as though it might topple to pieces. "Be bold, Draco! For once in your life!"
The Hogwarts Journal which hardly anyone had even read until this morning was all anyone could talk about. Were it any other year Draco would have basked in the attention. But this year all he wants is to get through school with grades good enough to get him an alchemy internship. No unnecessary attention, no drama, no death, just good grades and a future with a stable income. But of course that isn't what he's going to get.
"I don't know what sort of hex I'm trying to counteract which makes it difficult to find an antidote." She says wiping at the witch's forehead which has grown sweaty even though she remains deathly pale. "There is always a solution." She says and something in her voice makes him look up to see her brow furrowed in concentration as she scribbles something down on a clipboard. She has saved so many lives through the last two wars it is hard to believe she couldn't heal one hexed child which brings him a small comfort.
"Her." She confirms and he goes quiet. "How does that work?" He asks and she makes a face. "Like I'd tell you about my sex life?" But he shakes his head "That's not what I meant!" He says quickly but falls into silence again trying to figure out exactly what it is that he wanted to say. "You..um..you love her?" He asks and Pansy smiles nodding. "I told you I have a fiance before, that's not entirely the truth but I really do intend to marry her. I went to pick up her ring while we were in diagon alley" she says which only shocks him more. This news shakes him and the thought of doing something so bold fills him with fear. Even being caught in such a relationship would be social suicide for a pureblood heir. He had to wonder if his parents knew they had been setting him up for an entirely hopeless and loveless marraige. He is silent trying to mull this new information over when there is the tinkling of bells as someone else enters the store.
Draco is running as fast as his feet will carry him afraid that if he stops his tears will return. That Harry will be behind him with a hex, or the dark lord sneering at him with a threat on his tongue, or even his parents who mean well but have controlled and pressured him from the day he was born. It feels as though he is running away from everything. Or maybe he is just running from himself, and the repressed emotions inside of him. There is an overwhelming shame in him that he'd broken down and cried in front of Harry. The person he'd always considered his enemy is the only person that has seen him cry in years.
He vaguely registers running out of the school but feeling his shoes hitting the ground is the only thing that is keeping him together, so he just keeps running. There are tears streaming down his face again amd he trips and scrambles up only to keep running. He wipes at his eyes but slowly realizes there's nobody around to see him. Instead when he stops there are only trees looming high above him. Fear instantly grips him as he turns to search for a path out, but there is only the ominous noises of the forbidden forest surrounding him.
"How do you know about Potter's party?" Blaise asks surprised and Pansy only grins wider. Though from across the stable scrambling and cursing can be heard as Crabbe and Goyle shove things into the carraige. "What are you doing out here?" Crabbe says nervously approaching them as Goyle slams a bag into the back of the carriage. "I invited her." Draco says and after a moment of conflict they both seem to decide that time is more important at the moment. "Fuck, fine. Just get in." Crabbe says waving them inside.
By the time he leaves it's nearly curfew and he feels far lighter than he has in a while. He still has the same issues he had several hours prior but with herb correspondences floating in his head it feels as though his problems are far more inconsequential. As he passes a boy in the hall he even manages to smile at him. All he has to do is stay focused. He is here to make his family proud and if that means smiling and getting good grades then so be it.
"I don't think so, just trust me." Draco says and Blaise sighs shaking his head. "I didn't realize under all of that pompous attitude you were hiding a complete lunatic" He laughs and Draco can't help but laugh with him Then at the end of the hall they catch up to Pansy and he points her to the left where the door that lead out onto the stables await them. "Is it Potter's party that we're going to?" Pansy asks entirely giddy as they push through the doors.
Through the war he tried to be strong, he tried to follow orders. He wanted to show his parents that he is capable of carrying on their name. But he failed time and time again and after they lost the war he had to look back and wonder if what he'd done was right. In the moment he'd always believed that he was on the right side. He had the support of family and friends and he had never known anything else. He was always told that the dark lord would bring peace and prosperity. His life had already been laid out for him the moment he was born, even with his unsightly dimples. He knew who he was and where he belonged and he never questioned it, that is, until Potter came along.
"You'll be cut off!" Crabbe exclaims and Goyle promptly shushes him just in case someone is listening in. "Have you lost your mind?" He asks in disbelief. "I'd expect this from Blaise, but from you?" Blaise looks like he wants to object but stops himself.
He watches Harry over the top of his book as he pulls something out of his trunk. Then he quickly uses a spell enlarging it to reveal a training dummy. He starts pushing things around to make a bit more room and Draco wants to ask why but talking to Harry casually is probably the last thing he should be doing. Harry hasn't so much as looked his direction but the spite and anger he can feel in the room is overwhelming. He waits until Harry has stowed his wand in the pocket of his trousers before he takes a breath in, steadying himself to speak.
Upon opening the doors he can see his father standing behind his chair and his mother was looking prim beside him. It's as if they were statues standing there among the books around them and the window back lit them making them appear almost as shadows. He had seen them do this before but mostly as a precursor to important business transactions. It was meant to intimidate and Draco had to admit that it was in fact intimidating, even more so, as both of them are taller than Draco making them feel as though they are glowering down at him. Immediately he was on edge, surely he hadn't done anything dire enough to be deserving of punishment. "Good afternoon, Mother, Father." He bowed slightly and took a seat, they stayed standing for several moments more and it only made him feel smaller.
"Well that explains it." Draco said as if the matter had been resolved. "You'll sober up and let me off the hook, I have no reason to go and we would surely be caught." He nodded to Crabbe and Goyle expecting them to back him up like they normally do when Blaise thought up something insane. But when he looked over neither of them were quite looking him in the eye.
Draco ducks into an alcove when he sees a flash of red hair and he waits as the female Weasley passes. It's tiring to continually hide like this but it feels preferable to being hexed into oblivion. She has a nasty jelly legs jinx that makes your legs ache for days afterwards. And if just one of them knows then surely all of them know.
"You never told me why you're studying muggle art." Harry says scribbling then erasing. Draco tries to peek at the picture but he can't quite see. "I couldn't before" He says which is true. Harry nods silently then after squinting at him asks "Because of your dad?" He asks and Draco stiffens feeling as though he's under a microscope.
He should act far more indifferent, as if Potter's suspicion doesn't bother him. But he has never been good at holding in his irritation, especially when it comes to Potter. You'd think it would be easier after the years in which he'd been trained to hold in even the slightest amusement. But holding everything in, it only makes it worse. It's hard to acknowledge anything that doesn'tfall between anger and fear. Draco has never been soft spoken or held back his words and before the war he had no reason to. With his family behind him he was untouchable and insults lived on the tip of his tongue. But with his father in Azkaban he can only throw around empty threats and insults that feel empty
Draco falls in and out of sleep, even the slightest noise jolting him awake. He's used to sleeping in the silence of the slytherin dorms which are built underground. There is only ever the occasional chatter of merpeople as they pass the windows that look out into the lake. And at home, where the manor is so expansive and shielded by charms, hardly even the wind can get through. As he tosses and turns it feels as though there is noise everywhere, though one that continually worries him is the soft breathing from across the room.
"Take your time and write your name, I've got to get to know everyone. And don't worry it doesn't have to be perfect. Mistakes are a part of the journey." She says her smile never wavering as she looks at him which is strange. Normally he'd sense at least a bit of scorn, but she seems excessively chipper.
Draco decides not to answer and instead questions the next vial. "What's that one?" Pomfrey holds up the thick golden liquid to the light where it shines at the bottom of the glass. "Honey and acacia extract." He tries to think of the use this one might have. "Iets general healing?" He asks and she shakes her head "Not quite. "Alone they can heal minor wounds. But together," She says tapping the vial. "They create a potent healing salve." She says taking a bit and smoothing it across the girl's forehead then she gently presses some sort of leaf against it.
He shrugs with a noncommittal grunt and she rolls her eyes. He couldn't very well tell her that the thought of marrying her drove him to planning an escape. Though she truly has very little to do with it, it is more that he was not given a choice, and he never has. However his silence only seems to interest her further. She seems more alive than she has all night and before he can figure out how to make her think he isn't up to something she suddenly turns and climbs onto the edge the fountain, her bare feet shuffling to balance on the edge.
And as he rose to follow her out the door Blaise called after him "Consider it, mate!" before the door closed with a dull thud. They really were more trouble than they were worth, though their insistence on dragging him into their schemes is a great source of entertainment.
"What the are you doing?" Draco asks standing to his feet. But she only smiles grabbing her dress then climbing into the water. He watches her perplexed then she grins and drops the hem of her dress which quickly  sinks into the water. She smiles and stretch her hands above her head. Her carefully placed hair has started to free itself and has created a soft halo of moonlight around her head. It is a wonder to see someone so carefree, it is hard to imagine that he has ever felt that way. "What I'm doing," She says closing her eyes and turning her face towards the full moon, "Is choosing to be happy" She says and she takes in a slow breath and smiles. Then before he can decide whether she is amazing or insane she looks over at him with a mischevious glint in her eye. There is something in her gaze that screams rebellion, the same fire he'd felt upon planning to flee. "Join me" She says holding out her hand.
It only takes a single look between Pansy and Draco for both of them to silently agree that it's time to flee. Even though they haven't done anything, the desire for self preservation prevails. Draco jerks his head down the hall and she quickly moves toward him. The first year however is stands in front of him with a curious expression. "Are you Draco Malfoy?" He asks and seeing no way to ignore him without appearing incredibly rude he simply says "Yes" and nods slightly. The boy breaks into a grin grabbing a small notebook from his pocket. "And you were trying to save that girl?" He asks looking entirely enraptured, his pen poised to write.
There is flowery language that doesn't sound at all like his mother, cooing over him. She's painted him as a hero even though he has done nothing to deserve that title. She was saying things like"Draco was strong enough to break the curse." And "If it weren't for him we wouldn't have been able to escape the battle." He sets the article down and anxiously runs a hand through his hair. "Nobody is going to believe this" Draco whispers and Pansy takes back the paper.
There is an unsettled feeling in his gut even though he should feel overjoyed. But Crabbe says again "So is it true?" And Draco nods silently wondering if the girl is still unconcious this morning instead of acknowledging the sinking feeling in his gut. "I don't know anything really, I didn't even know her name." He says feeling empty though unsure as to why.
She twists a piece of her hair which has fallen loose around her finger and she sighs looking down at the fountain "Happiness is for those who have the choice. We have duties do we not?" She asks wit disdain and she looks down at her dress with a huff "These shoes are killing me" she sighs then hikes up her dress to kick them off. She sighs grateful for the relief as she wriggles her toes.
"I thought you were a goner!" Goyle says as Draco reaches them. "Let's get the hell out of here!" He huffs still trying to make his heart slow "This way" Pansy says pointing off in the distance and she quickly takes lead.
"LIES!" One of them calls and Draco takes a step back the booming voice seeming to shake him to his core. "I just want to go back to hogwarts! I don't have my wand!"
"I've gone the last several years but I couldn't manage to sneak away this year." She smiles looking out the window "My fiance will be there" She says with the biggest goofiest grin. Though after a moment she seems to snap out of it. "I won't bore you with the details" She says seeming to draw back slightly. "There's an inn off of diagon alley that would be a good place to rest and we could buy different robes."
Once they sat his father steepled his fingers in front of him and his mother sat straight backed with her hands in her lap. Still they seemed statuesque and he tried to mirror them, his back straight and his hands folded in his lap. "Draco, we have some news to discuss with you." His mother started, her tone light. Draco nodded feeling a growing tension in the room though he wasn't sure if he was only creating it in his mind. "Well, we'll be hosting a party tonight, your clothes are laid out for you and-"
He shakes his head about to protest but truly he doesn't know how much his wardrobe costs. It has always been his parents that buy his clothes. "If everybody is welcome why exclude rich people, that doesn't seem fair." Goyle says looking around the little room curiously.
As he looks up the golden trio is standing in the doorway. He decidedly clamps his mouth shut. Weasley is glaring a hole through him so he leaves the rest of his plants to be put up later then grabs Pansy's arm. "Come on, we're going somewhere else." He says and she glares right back at the three of them.
"I have to wonder, if she was not hexed there, then where was she hexed? Did her attacker move her body? If so then how did they move her without being seen by others?" She says slowly and Draco nods silently as they reach the doors to the infirmary. "I don't know if you can answer my questions but I would like for you to see her regardless." Then she pushes the door open nodding to Madam Pomfrey as she makes her way to a bed in the back of the room. He can't understand why she wants this, especially if she doesn't think it's him but he follows behind her until she moves aside a curtain to reveal the young witch.
The lot of them lounge about a table which is scratched, dented, and beaten to hell. They hide it whenever the Malfoy parents are about so they won't toss it out. It was a memento from the time they'd gotten wasted, this time Draco included, and stole the ugly thing from a pub. It is still sticky and horrendous to look at regardless of how many times it's been washed and buffed by the servants. Even magic couldn't make the tragic thing look presentable. It's a ratty old pub table and it would stick out like a sore thumb among all of the grandeur of the Malfoy manor regardless of how it is dressed. The juxtaposition of it makes them look like a band of misfits who only stumbled upon luxury perchance and they're all rather fond of the idea.
"Sleeping potion, healing potion" He says pointing to the two simmering pots. He holds back an
After the war was over Draco realized that in all the time that Voldemort lived with them he had never once smiled. This fact often woke him late at night with a cold sweat prickling his skin. It's horrifying to acknowledge that he is far more like the dark lord than he is willing to admit. This would have been something that he would have celebrated hardly even months before the war had ended. But once the dark lord was gone he was able to see him for what he was. He was cruel, vengeful, devoid of love or happiness. It is a fate he wouldn't wish upon even the worst of mankind. However it would seem that is who he was trained to be. So he has to question whether he deserves it. He was so much like the dark lord, they shared the same ambition, ruthlessness, and bigotry as much as he hated go admit it. And yet the only thing that stood in his way was his cowardice that kept him from killing.
He tries to read further but it makes him feel slightly ill. He only manages a third of his breakfast before he gives up. Pansy comes into the great hall smiling and says "Did you see the article?" She asks grabbing a strawberry from the middle of the table. "You're welcome!" She says in a sing song voice before popping the fruit into her mouth and taking a seat next to him. "That was you?" He asks still unsure how to feel.
With each hexing and every passing day without word from his mother he's sure that there must be a resurgence afoot. Even though she hasn't written him she seems to be on great speaking terms with the prophet. Every other day there is a new story or interview. She has always been charismatic and quick witted which lends itself nicely to bold faced lies. The prophet seems to wholeheartedly believe her and the support of his family continues to grow.
When he glances back he can see their mouths moving but there is no sound. He curses himself for never learning to lip read. He tries to ignore them and go back to his potion but every movement catches his eye. By the time he's done they're huddled over Harry's desk whispering and writing. He momentarily tries to peer around them but decides three against one aren't good odds if he's caught. He puts a stopper on his potion and starts heading toward muggle studies. The few classes he'd attended were confusing at best and he had been sort of thankful for the excuse to skip them. But with Harry plotting whatever it is in their dorm he can't really stay there.
The next letter he gets from his mother says
"It was thunder!" He yells scrambling to the furthest corner of the room. "It was only thunder!" He says again holding out his wand toward Harry ready to cast a bind on him if necessary. He is already worried simply disarming him would get him a detention at the very least. But thankfully Harry stops still looking dazed and he says "Thunder?" taking a moment to look around the room. He stands up straight and sighs heavily seeming to come out of the fog of sleep. "I'll have my wand back." He says holding out his hand and after a moment of hesitation and a scowl from Harry Draco hands back the wand.
"How?" Draco asks holding the cloak around him closer even though there wasn't a gust of wind to give him a chill.
"I won't, you just seem..I don't know.." He sighs scrambling to climb out of the fountain after her. "I am intrigued by you, but I don't wish to marry you as terrible as that sounds" He says and it feels like he's digging himself into a hole
He's managed to make it most of the way through the day without running into any of them. He has one final class then he'll have to figure out how to avoid Harry even though they share a room. As his class is a muggle subject he's not looking forward to it very much. It always seems that they speak in a forgein language. The teacher will at times say utter nonsense and nobody else seems at all bothered. It feels like some sort of elaborate prank.
Quickly though his mother breaks the silence,"She is beautiful, well educated, and from a good family, she is a lovely girl andwill make a wonderful wife." and she says it as if she is talking about a particularly nice roast.
Two weeks have passed before he receives a letter from his mother, but instead of the reassurances he'd wanted from her or an explanation there is a short note that says,
"If we keep this pace we'll make it to the party before dusk and-" Pansy starts but Draco quickly cuts in. "BY DUSK?" He yells looking around at the others "I'M NOT WEARING THIS THING TIL DUSK!"
o, pl
Not wanting to think think about his father he heads to his trunk deciding that whatever happens it would be Harry that requests to change dorms, not him. The room is cramped and lacks the grandeur of the slytherin dorms but if he is going to make it through the year then pure obstinance will see him through.
"Potter and company have been crowding my dorm all day." He says handing off the bottle to Goyle. "I knew Ginny was up to something, she kept whispering with Loony." Pansy says and Draco looks at her surprised "Did you really just call her by her actual name? That's two points from slytherin!" He says and she sighs "She hexes me every single time I call her Weaslette! What am I supposed to do? I'm losing my edge!" She cries slumping down and scowling at the empty bed on the other side of the room.
As they walk to the middle of the ballroom he sees Crabbe standing at the edge of the room and he nods minutely. Nerves suddenly rush through him knowing that before the night is up this will no longer be his life. He will never have to sit through silent dinners with his parents or suffer through another one of these parties. He could almost felt pity for Pansy, surely she would be scorned and blamed for his running away. They will say she was not pretty, that she was dull, and the worst is that it would likely be his own parents fueling these rumors. They would do anything to protect the family name even defame a girl who is entirely blameless. He would have been an awful husband, undoubtedly so. She will in time find another suitor, likely below her station if rumor surrounds her. Perhaps she would be just as miserable with someone else. But he has to think of his own happiness though it makes him want to apologize for the burden he would become to her by the end of the night.
The ground seems to shake and his heart matches the erratic pace but he refuses to stop running. His heart is hammering against his ribs and as he tries to sprint forward his foot catches on a root and he goes sprawling to the ground. The hooves are nearly deafening and he flips over wishing he had his wand as he is met with a group of centaurs surrounding him.
and he starts to pull out small plants. The room is smaller than he was used to and even in the slytherin dorms he would often take up more than his fair share of space. On each side there is a window, a bed, a desk, and a bookshelf. Draco sets to organizing his things. Placing books about potions, alchemy, and herbology, across the bookshelf. Then along every other available surface on his side of the room he starts to cover it with plants. He has used them to practice potions for years. Ever since he was a child he wanted to be an alchemist and potioneer. Several of his plants are nearly ten years old at this point.
As he reaches them he hears Blaise hissing "Fucking longbottom!" And Draco quickly sits grabbing a plate. "What happened?" He asks and Pansy quite dramatically huffs and turns away from him. "I'm convinced that he's trying to annoy me into changing rooms." Blaise says shaking his head "He won't fucking stop talking about plants! He's worse than you Draco, I swear it!" He says slumping in his seat. "He talked about some muggle plant for three hours! THREE HOURS!" He yells and people at the neighboring table look their way. He grumbles under his breath and glares at them.
"Who the hell is Pansy Parkinson?" He nearly shouts, and he has the urge to stand, perhaps slam his hands on his father's desk or storm out of the room but he manages to restrain himself though he grips the arms of his chair tightly.
"I've never met a muggle!" Crabbe says entirely stunned. "I've heard that they're wild! Someone told me they saw a muggle jump off of a bridge with only a string holding them up!" Crabbe says laughing and everyone but Pansy laughs with them. "That's bungee jumping, they do it for fun." Pansy says with a little smirk as they break into a disbelieving frenzy of questions.
"That would be quite the miracle" Blaise says laughing. "Do you two know what you're doing when you leave?" He asks looking to Crabbe and Goyle.
She doesn't wait for him to answer, instead she nods to Madam Pomfrey and turns to leave. He watches as she goes and he can't quite decipher how he feels. He looks back at the girl in her corpselike state and for some reason he wants to cry. He grasps for something solid within himself as he stand motionless. The idea that this attack might be from Voldemort's supporters fills him with an overwhelming fear. It has been easy to pretend that the war is behind him, but there is no better motivator than the death of a leader. If there is a resurgence then where do his allegiances lie? It is a question he hasn't wanted to think about.
"He's been buzzed since noon." Goyle said with a small laugh and Blaise grabbed a coaster off the table and chucked it at him. It missed by half a foot without even a flinch from Goyle. Blaise sunk back into his chair sulking.
she turns to Draco grabbing swatches of fabric to show him. He's never liked shopping for cloaks. It has always just been his parents dragging him around to stores and him standing agitated as he is poked by pins. He also has a tendency to squirm which doesn't help. He picks out a dark fabric with a subtle design and as scissors and pins fly around him he tries his best not to move. Just as scissors zoom past his ear there is another loud noise at the front of the store and the blades nearly catch his cheek. The shopkeeper looks alarmed now and the pins drop from around him. She quickly moves to look and his curiosity gets the better of him and he quickly follows behind her trying to ignore the scissors trying to follow behind him.
"It's how I was raised." He says feeling the need to defend himself. Harry shakes his head and sighs seeming disappointed.
"No, not at all." She says with the shake of her head. "Alchemist is a difficult profession." She says which only makes him feel even worse. "So you're saying you don't think I could?" He says ready to up and leave the infirmary altogether. She glances over at him and shakes her head. "You could, I don't doubt that. You're a talented and driven student." The compliment takes him off guard and he stares at her wondering where this is going. "The prestige of the title is very alluring and looks good to the public. Or am I wrong?" She asks and he quickly looks away knowing she has realised he is only chasing the title solely for that reason.
"I'm not a fucking saint! I never was and never will be!" He yells angrily ripping at the buttons of his shirt and it whips back behind him. "I refuse to go another moment with my father's voice in my head telling me I'm not good enough!" He screams starting to pull pins from his trousers.
In pureblood culture you are taught that you must always be strong. You must be strong of will, strong of mind, strong of character. Above all else your standing in thee community is determined by how much power you are percieved to hold. This percieved power can be effected by many things, from your wealth, your intellect, the loyalty you command from others. All of these can be improved upon but there is one important aspect of pureblood strength that cannot be easily changed, and that is your appearance. It can be twisted through makeup or magic but inevitably all changes will require maintenance. That is why from the moment of Draco's very first smile, when dimples tugged at his chubby cheeks his parents started giving him potions to fix them. As he grew older they hoped that his dimples would fade, but to no avail.
Draco keeps his head down all day, not wanting to draw any added attention to himself. He still isn't sure that he's fully processed his conversation with the headmistress but it continues to replay in his mind. Though it is a welcome reprieve from the face of the hexed girl. He manages to avoid any contact with the golden trio as the day continues. Even when they have classes together he purposefully sits entirely across the room and essentially runs out of the classroom as soon as they're dismissed.
"How long do you think it'll take to get there?" Goyle asks attempting to maneuver around Pansy's dress to get comfortable. "It'll depend on the thestrals." Blaise says with a shrug but by his nonchalant tone they all know it'll be longer than any of them want.
She seems giddy to have someone join her and she smiles and stands raising her arms again and spins her dress flowing under her. As he watches her smiling he thinks perhaps marrying her wouldn't be so terrible. She doesn't seem vapid or dull and she has a wonderful laugh. She is a beautiful girl and perhaps he could grow to love her. His heart beats fast unsure whether it is this sudden freedom or perhaps some sort of rise of feelings. There is a small hope that he might still hold onto his life. Running away would be abandoning everything he has ever known. But with her, maybe he could stay. When she spins to him again he reaches out wrapping an arm around her waist and he pulls her toward him. And with his heart beating frantically he pulls her close and kisses her.
He quickly downs the potion trying not to worry whether or not he'd just been caught. Surely the smile hadn't been big enough to expose him. But either way there's no way of knowing how Harry will take his unintentional jabs. It's not as if he was throwing insults like they would when they were children but it seems they have a fragile and unspoken truce. If he's just broken it then the rest of the year will be hell.
The forest seems to be getting darker with every minute and the thought of being stuck out here at night is truly horrifying. There is a pit in his stomach thinking about how the dark lord lived in these very woods before coming back into power. He tries not to think of unicorn blood spilled across the roots around him. When the images of gnashing teeth and flesh fill his head he believes he's made up the sound of hooves in the distance.
"Shut up" Draco says throwing one of the inn's bars of soap at Blaise's head. He yelps and quickly ducks out of the way. "Am I wrong?" He says finally managing to shove his bag into the trunk and quickly shrink it down before shoving it in his pocket. "We're not a couple!" Draco and Pansy say in unison to the delight of Blaise who can only smirk at them "You sure?" He asks as he gets back on his broom. Pansy shrinks her trunk as well and climbs onto her broom in one swift motion "I already have a fiance, and it's not him!" She huffs then she zooms back outside.
"No! You look nice when you smile!" Harry protests which only makes Draco's face heat up. He looks away embarrassed but Harry says "I'm not done! Just give me two more seconds of smiling" He says but Draco shakes his head his face returning to his normal impassive expression. Harry huffs but continues to draw.
She simply nods silently, the shy smile returning to her face and together they leave the crowd. The garden is lit by fairies who emit a shimmering white light. And against the dim lights he can see her smile once again fall away. If they were to marry she would clearly be just as miserable as him. If only they could be happy, or at the very least accept their unhappiness their lives would be far easier.
"I didn't do this, I couldn't." He says unable to look away from the girl's face. "I was trying to help, that's all." He jumps when he hears madam Pomfrey speak next to him "And you did dear, I don't know if she would have survived had you not found her when you did." She says carrying potions to the bedside table. He is quiet for a moment "But she will survive? She'll wake up won't she?" He asks and worry slips into his voice. That worry only increases when she doesn't answer immediately.
