"It will be over before you know it," Harry said, studying Ron's face. "Just a few more minutes, and then you'll be married, and it will be brilliant. You'll see."
"I'm not sure, exactly. And I, uh, don't know his name. He's another client like me, so his personal information is kept confidential. We've decided to keep our identities a secret until we know each other better," Harry said, suddenly aware of how silly that sounded.
," she said, shooting him a disapproving glare. He blushed, waves of mortification washing over him again at the memory of George asking him about the charmed cock rings – in front of Hermione – at the brunch Molly had thrown for the couple this morning. "You said you'd help. We've got more than 100 left to do, so get to work."
? So he'd lost a good pen pal – so what? Because really, had Sly been anything more than just that – someone to casually email back and forth with?
"We're here, and it's where we want to be. We couldn't have stayed there knowing what that idiot Smith was playing at. Did that b-" Ron broke off when Hermione cleared her throat meaningfully, inclining her head toward Teddy, who was listening avidly. "
"You'll never believe this, but I got the idea from Sly. We've been trying to get to know each other, and it turns out he had a Crup named Argyle when he was a boy," Harry said sheepishly. "I was thinking about him when this ending just fell into place."
Harry watched him through heavily lidded eyes, a strong wave of lethargy sweeping over him as he came down from his climax. He collapsed against the sofa, his hand still wrapped around his spent cock as he watched Draco recover.
"It's old-fashioned romance," Pansy said simply, dragging a hand along Oliver's jaw fondly. She turned back to Hermione, frowning. "It's not a one-way street, either. After accepting fourteen of the suitor's gifts, the person being courted has to give a gift in return. One that signifies whether or not he or she is willing to go on with the courtship."
They'd chosen not to sleep in the delectable silk pajamas Harry had purchased, preferring as much skin-on-skin contact as they could get to keep the bond happy. Even in sleep, Draco stirred, wrapping an arm tighter around Harry's torso and hooking his foot around Harry's leg.
He swallowed, his hand trembling as he ripped away the simple brown paper. It couldn't be, could it? He had been certain the Ministry destroyed it years ago. It hadn't been listed among his other possessions when he'd been released from his brief stay in Azkaban nearly ten years ago. Of course, it hadn't
A powerful pulse of energy rippled through the room. At its epicenter, Harry and Draco both gasped, their bodies literally pushed together by the force of the magic. Face to face, they exchanged a startled glance before Harry broke into an enormous grin and brought his mouth down on Draco's.
Harry took another swallow of wine to curb his sharp retort. He knew Ron and Hermione were only looking out for him, but he didn't want or need their advice on this. It felt right; he couldn't describe it, and he didn't want to sully it by trying.
"It looks like he's made more than enough for one," Harry said, looking up at Pansy. "Would you like to join me?"
"I'll leave you to rest, Mr. Malfoy," the Healer said, regarding him sternly. "You're to do whatever Mediwizard Finnigan asks of you."
Draco flushed, shaking his head. He hadn't known, but it wasn't a complete surprise, either. He looked up at the portrait, pressing his lips together so he wouldn't laugh.
She unbuttoned the first few fasteners on her robe, letting it slip down over her shoulder to expose the sheer fabric of her blouse. Hermione heard Theo gasp, a slow grin spreading across her face. They were alone in the library; not even Madam Pince lingered that late on a Saturday night. Seventh years had a special dispensation to remain in the library after it closed, since ostensibly they could be trusted to behave and they needed the extra study time.
The silence that was between us except for the small tinkering sound of Tiffany, then finally, Malfoy let out a single sigh.
Your no god, Harry. That's why don't blame your self always. Remember, you are Harry. A wizard. Stubborn and cute. Awkward teenager or the brave hero but foremost, what is important is: Harry is Harry. That's who you are. Don't forget it.
As minutes pass by, it became clear to him my so obvious clueless state as he sighed heavily at me, in mixed frustration and sarcastic sympathy.
I laughed in a delirious state.  Imagine, a pureblood, bully, and a Slytherin is now taking care of a Muggle-born, a lowborn, and a Gryffindor. Ron will have a fit if he knew. Sadness crept in as I remember him.
"Why are you here, Malfoy?" I asked coolly. Looking at him, his face was so pale, and had a weary look on him, like he was very tired, harassed maybe. Unlike the last time, I saw him. Malfoy just made a small movement as he peered at me with that cold look, as if he speaks to me with his eyes to 'shut up.'
We laughed at our banter, lighten the intense mood. I felt relaxed after our conversation but then Draco seems to think more deeply as he raised his head.
"Better?" I asked, reaching out for the strayed strand of her hair and tucking it under her ear. As I did so, she blushed, adoringly, making her more beautiful. She seems had forgotten her own question as I raise one of my eyebrows to urge her to continue but when she didn't say anything. I smirked at her.
"The result of our experiment meant you are most likely to hunt and eat beings that have high magical power, as the soup was from a horned rabbit, a magical creature of the east. That would also include us, wizards, and witches along with other magical creatures." Draco replied with seriousness in his voice. "With it, we also concluded what creature you might have become."
The light from the window was the first thing that had greeted me in the morning as I woke up from my sleep. It is the first time I had ever felt refreshed from waking up and it left me to confuse.
My sanity was questioned by many. I shuddered, remembering the look on the faces of the people that surrounded me upon the discovery of my transformation.
"Granger, wake up!" a loud and annoying voice called out. "Do I have to say 'please' just to wake you up?"
Message: I am so SORRY for the delayed update. Writer's block. You get them once in a while and I have been doing other things to inspire me.  I am thankful for my small collection of novels and the music on the internet to be my source material for inspiring me. So let's get on with the story...
"Hmmph." He smirked evilly at us. "Being a Golden boy really has its benefits. When you need something you think that it will be granted immediately without giving any request first because you think you too important and eventually it will be granted anyway because it's your privilege. Really too arrogant, just like your father."
Snickers and whispered voices came about from Michael's group as they're eyes that look over me, are watching with much judgment.
"Mr. Malfoy, bring a weapon is not allowed." Hagrid tried to intervene as he reaches out to take the blade from Malfoy's hand.
"Thank you, Sirius, but call me Molly" Mrs. Weasley automatically responded with her motherly affection.
"Harry, dear." She sobbed as her grips tighten. "Where have you been? Are you hurt? Are you hungry? We were worried about you!"
Ginny's whole body tensed up then a whimper escaped from her. Turning her to face me, I saw her face painted with so many emotions - pouring out of her as her unrestrained tears fall from her eyes. A whole new feeling was born from within me upon seeing her in so much pain. A scourging heat of dark emotion. Hatred, that's what emotion bloom inside my chest.
Hermione's hand gently laid on my trembling hand, patting it slowly. I stiffened but did not flinch from her touch. She meant to comfort me. "It's alright, Harry. I am here."
Author’s notes: This tale focus on the darker aspect of life, such as blood, flesh, temptation, betrayal, hatred, and revenge along with it is hope and love. You have been warned!
I stood up slowly with quiet resolved under the dusky sunlight, then strode towards my intended prey. Hermione grabbed a hold of my shirt as she shook her head trying to convince me to stop but I gently shook her hands off and silently signal her my determination which eventually made her understood as she sighed and nod.
"You should listen to her, Potter. As much as possible, we want you satisfied and full - all the time." Draco reminded me, lightly.
"Let's just say, I have some experience and theories." He flipped a page and took a sip from his coffee.
The station that she turns into was airing an old classic song, with its flute, piano, and drums - it was a lively one. Maybe because of the drastic situation that we are in, had made my brain gone hare-wire, I took Hermione's hand and pulled her in the middle of the tent.
“Yes, Harry… Call me, Draco.” He said in a very savvy tone. “Of course, that is if you don’t like to?”
I slowly sat up as Mrs. Weasley went over to Ron to wake him up next. I almost forgot to put my glasses on since my vision got cleared up. There was no to little light that is passing through the window's curtain as I got dressed in my old pair of jeans and oversized faded red t-shirt, courtesy of Dudley; We would change to our uniform in the Hogwarts Express within the duration of our travel.
"Wicked!" Ron gasped loudly as his mouth open wide with awe and eyes bulging from amazement. I grinned back at his comment. Indeed it is.
Even though my situation is very dire, I was able to laugh at Hermione. Then Hermione joined me in laughing our worries away.
"But all these options and solutions will still depend on you two, Harry and Hermione. After all, it's your lives." Draco slowly looks at me.  "Just remember your not alone. Well?"
Author's message: I am grateful for the music of Beauty and Beast's EVERMORE by Dan Stevens for inspiring me with  new ideas to put into this chapter
"Harry, what are you doing dilly dally on the corridor? March to the field, Potter!!" He shouted at my right ear. Pain erupted in my ear as his voice had seemed to have broken my right eardrum. Hermione tried to fight the hold that Oliver had on me. Both of us protesting but can't seem to reach the determined Oliver as he shouted more to us "We have matched to WIN! So stop whining, Potter! Granger!"
Weak and tired, I laid down on the soft grass. Panting from exhaustion, I felt that I have released all the pain, fear, and anger into the wind. It felt good.
Another name was called out but I didn't pay attention to it anymore. I was more intrigued by what I saw. And it seems to me, I was the only one who had noticed it since no one had commented on it.
A resounding sad sigh was heard from somewhere as I slowly realized Draco sat beside me as his hand rub my back comfortably and hypnotically that slowly smooth my sorrow. How long did I crumble down? I did not know. Long enough for Hermione to be asleep, as she was still kneeling and her head lays on my lap, her cheeks stained with tears. I slowly unfold my body trying not to jostled her awake. I straighten my back, my spine cracks, stressed from bending. I grumbled as the pain shot from back to my waist. My eyes sting and swollen, as I tried to open them.
My black hair was messier than before, my face looks like lost its tan color instead replaced by a sick pale color tinged with green. And most of all, green eyes that were so tired and packed of eyebags.
I closed my eyes, praying to anyone that he could be saved. Be it an angel, a god, or the devil himself!
Malfoy stood there, dressed with a white loose shirt and soft-looking dark brown khaki pants that fitted him like gloves, with his hand holding the stirring spoon and his other hand on his waist, emitting that calm, elegant, and mature aura that looks so temptingly sexy.
"HUSH!" Malfoy said in an indifferent tone. I couldn't even sense a hint of pain in his voice as the blood trickled down from his hand but all the worrying in me vanished as the smell of his blood hit me.  His scent hit me like a charging bull. There were no words that could describe what happened to me at that moment.
"What you do mean 'We killed him'?" I asked her. She giggled then pointed at the chunked meat at the bottom of my feet. I can see the white-cloaked fluttering, that had been soaked by the blood, that had almost had turned red.
"Lucian, my older sibling," Malfoy muttered with a somber look in his eyes. I recognized the name that he speaks of, from the conversation we had with Mr. Weasley and Mrs. Weasley. "Lucian's grave got..." Malfoy halted as his words seem to get stuck in his throat and pain was evident on his face. "Somebody disintegrate his grave and stole his body." He finally said.
"Really, Granger. You forgot to ask him when you have been with him for more than two hours." Draco grumbled as he sarcastically jabs at Hermione.
As agreed, after finishing our breakfast, we went out to try out some of the theories that Hermione and Draco have formulated on the past few days when I was still was knocked out.
My head tells me to be cautious but I know within me- my guts tell me to trust him. I wasn't so sure anymore of anything.
"You!" Shocked was carve out from her face then a force seems to have pushed her back away from me and she disappeared.
"Yes, I will file a case against her in the old ways." Malfoy said as he started to calm down. "I will take it up to Britain's ancient council of wizards and witches."
"Malfoy, I don't mean to rude to you but is it really okay for you to have a house-elf eating with us? No offense. I am okay with it but for you as a Malfoy to..." I asked but gradually losing words to describe what I am actually seeing.
"Don't you worry, Professor. No one will be harm except me." He said in a bored tone and brought down the blade on his palm, slicing it diagonally.
And even though, I haven't decided on accepting his help, I still wish that I could thank him for saving me from going insane with hunger. I just couldn't think of anything or anyway to show my gratitude to him. It's gonna be awkward if I just pop out of nowhere and act friendly with him, right?! Not the mention, embarrassing to just say 'thanks' upfront to your rival.
Suddenly, there a rustling sound above us, and hundreds of owls soar through the open windows carrying the morning mail. In an impulse, I started to search for Hedwig among the owls of brown and gray. But there was no sign of a white owl. Thus disappointment spread through my chest, as a small ache pang.
Rolling his eyes at me. "Really, Potter. Even the Weasleys should have known about it. They forgot their purebloods. Your Godfather should have told you. After all, he is black."
1. Heighten senses (Hearing - I can hear very clear, eyesight - I don't need my eyeglasses anymore, smell- I guess?, taste- ??? by Harry) (Hearing and eyesight: not yet measured properly but had been improved greatly smell: more detailed than an average human and needs more information, taste: N/A)
"Come you all, These little buggers can't harm you." Hagrid chuckled with good nature than for a minute turn to Malfoy with a bit of doubt. "Right, Mr. Malfoy?"
Ron gulped loudly as he back away from the tunnels that he courageous almost marched on the earlier minute. "That's just statue, right? It can be that there's one here?"
After the incident yesterday, she suddenly disappears from my mind and had not spoken until I went to bed and strangely, I also didn't have a nightmare last night.
I turned to the headmaster Dumbledore and spoke about our summer's adventure with the Gulon and the dreams - the nightmares.
"No. You're absolutely wrong about that." Malfoy suddenly spoke as he was silent awhile aback. "You can't disqualify them from the game."
"Sexual way?" He teased as he leaned closer and slowly breathed over my ear, making me, shivering in anticipation.
I don't know how many hours that Hermione and I had stayed like that - lock in each other arms. I needed her support and she needed my courage as we had each other's backs.
Draco was wearing a black satin bathrobe that seems cling to the shape of his body as the belt loosely tied around his waist making it possible of a gap between the robe, showing a  bit of his flushed white chest while he gently rubbed a white cotton towel over his hair which was still wet as I could see droplets of water on some the strands of his hair.
"That monster run away from something, Ron." I snapped back at him. "Its means that in this area is a crea-"

"I-is he dead?" Came a voice that had to cause my blood to boil, Michael. His scent makes me wanna puke as he smells bad like he was drenched by something, like a heavy emotion - fear.
"I think I'm going to be sick" I got up immediately and rush into the nearby bathroom as fast as my two feet could bring me. After me, Hermione trailed behind. As I reached the bowl, I gave a heaved and all of my dinner from last night came out. Hermione diligently patted my back as I vomited. The mixture of sour and bitter after taste of my puke still tangle inside my mouth as I slide unto the floor, resting my head onto the cool wood pane of the wall.
My nerves had been going nuts inside me. The inside of my body feels like it had frozen from my flesh to every vein to every drop of my blood. Sweat pours down my forehead and my heart thumps hard against my ribcage. I could taste the bitter bile inside my mouth and the shrinking feeling inside my stomach.
I burst to a run, without anything on my mind as I leaped away. My only thought is to seek safety from the hypocrites that ones had called themselves as my friend. Focusing only on running far away from where they couldn't follow me anymore, in where I can't hear their voices that scream 'Monster' nor where I can't see their faces that show disgust and fear.
"Harry, run!" Draco snarled as he cleaved another Hobglobin with a spell. The creature in front of me roared and swung his club with great strength. I jerked back as the club missed my head within an inch. I spun around as I grab my wand which I had accidentally let go when I dived and grab the hobgoblin.
"I take it, with your purring over that bowl of soup, that you are enjoying my recipe," Draco uttered as he was observing my reaction. "I guess, our experiment is a success, Hermione."
"What do you mean, Malfoy?" Wood stared at Malfoy as if Malfoy had miraculously had grown two more hands.
"Harry. I prefer a 'thank you' than of 'a sorry'," He said, titled his head down as I look up at him.
A heavy silence came on us with what Malfoy had told us. Both our teams and Ravenclaw were thinking of the options laid out for us. Smiling, Malfoy bid us all goodbye before walking away from us.
Sobbing and growling as I snap my jaws, as I force my body to twist against the ropes, breaking my skin and making me bleed. Raking my claws against the tree as they got tore.
"And under the ancient wizardly law, it is the right punishment that the owner of the locket of inheritance should do. If Draco did not do so, then Ms. Vane should have been called to a court to be imprisoned in the Azkaban for, let say 5-10 years." Snape spoke in a droning manner.

An unfamiliar room. I try to search through my memory for any clue as to where I was. For the moment, I was safe but panic started to erupt in my chest as an urgent question pop out from my head.
Harry smiled grimly, shrugging. "It was the only path he saw," he said softly, gripping Draco's hand when the scene swirled around them again. Neither took any notice of the new memory, their attention focused on each other.
are. I've been giving you the same advice for two weeks now, and you keep asking me the same questions."
," she said, nodding her head politely toward Harry and Draco. "Our readers would like to know what you've been doing since the war, Harry. Have you simply been living off Mr. Malfoy's – er, Mr. Potter-Black's – money?"
"Until my eleventh birthday," Harry murmured, and he could tell from his expression that Draco was imagining Cal living in conditions like those.
Draco blushed slightly, meeting Kingsley's eye. "Kingsley, then," he said, his eyes widening in surprise when the man tugged on his hand and pulled him into a loose hug.
Teddy cleared his throat, straightening his shoulders. He'd definitely inherited Tonks' flair for drama in addition to Remus' brilliant mind.
"Are we?" Draco gasped, rolling his shoulders under the scalding hot spray. Every muscle in his body ached.
"It must not be working," the older man spat, kicking the other man's chair. "Go get another bottle. Test it on yourself, then bring it to me."
Even Blaise had turned out for Harry's birthday, and Grimmauld Place was teeming with people. He'd wanted to keep it as low key as possible, so Harry had opted to have the celebration at home instead of out at his favorite pub, as he normally would have.
“Er, you’ve plenty of time to master it,” she said, hoping to cheer him up. “I think I’ll head back down to the party. It’s still going strong, if you’d like to go.”
Hermione's expression softened slightly. "I'll pick out some clothes for you. We're leaving in 15 minutes, so you'd best hurry."
"If you were going to hex anyone, it should be Smith," Blaise said, his lip curling in distaste. He hadn't liked the man at Hogwarts, and he liked him even less now. "Sycophantic little wanker."
Draco's hand slipped over his stomach, sliding over well-defined abs and lightly tracing down the ridge of muscle just above his pelvis, his manicured fingers just barely ghosting over his throbbing erection. The humor in his expression was clear as he arched an eyebrow at Harry, his lips quirked as he held back the breathy moan that threatened to escape.
"Do you Harry James Potter, Head of the House of Black, Head of the House of Potter, swear on your magic that you have no other bonds or entanglements that would prevent you from legally wedding Draco Abraxas Malfoy?"
It took for a while for all of us - to realize that the Gulon already gave up chasing us. Sighing in relief, Ron weakly fall to his knees and Hermione slumped her bottom to the ground as she was trying to catch her breath but even with the Gulon gone, I couldn't help but feel intense fear. The Gulon didn't leave because it gave up chasing us but instead, it runs away from something else that was inside this part of the cave. Something so frightening that scare the shit out of that said monster. Meaning this something is far more dangerous than the Gulon itself. The hair on my whole body started to stand as I search for that creature with my weak eyes.
"Ms. Granger." He said in a bitter tone as he looks down intimidatingly at Hermione. "Do I need to remind you not to run along the hallway? Apparently, even being the brightest witch in your year, you were not able to learn the simple rules in Hogwarts."
Message: I sincerely apologize for the long absence and the late update, I was preparing for my written examinations and simulation test, and I couldn't lend time in typing my story. Super Sorry!
"Like what you see?" He suddenly told me as he smirked at me apparently he caught me staring at him or more like ogling in a perverted way.
Author’s notes: This tale focus on the darker aspect of life, such as blood, flesh, temptation, betrayal, hatred, and revenge along with it is hope and love. You have been warned!
Desperate, she took a hold of his jacket and yank it. "I'll do anything for my best friend." she said in a tone that was hard and strong.
"Your complexion is better than in the past two days. You don't look like you're going to fall off anytime. You're in a good mood compared to you being grouchy all the time." She continues as she listed all the things that she had observed. " Better, even you still not eating that much."
"I see." He said sternly. "You all shouldn't be here. After all, the quidditch field had been scheduled to be preserved to us Gryffindor for our practices. If you wish to confront some issues. You should do it in another place."
Unwilling, my body started to shudder and there was a heavy feeling in my chest, so I gasp out for air and as it filled my lungs, the scents hit me hard - Hunger, that was the first thing I could think. A rumbled came within me, like a snarling wolf. My mouth filled up with saliva and my teeth sharpened. I don't know what was happening to me but I know that I am hungry and their food out there to eat.
"HARRY JAMES POTTER!!!" Hermione shouted at my ear. "I will NEVER abandon my best friend for my own safety. Remember that!"
Draco looked at my eyes as he seems to search for answers but I couldn't wait for any more seconds, I just want his lips on mine then I pull him and devour those tempting lips.
"What's this? Trying to escape already with another girl, Potter?" Michael smirked as he walks up to me.
"I wish we could forget the outside world. Stay as we were." Hermione muttered as she flips the pages of the book without actually reading it. "Grow old, the three of us. Together."
Ron charged like a bull, lunging with his fists and kicks but was hindered by a group of Ravenclaws that came to save Corner. After seeing their brother being gang up by a couple of Ravenclaw players, the twins came charging with their snarls and battle cries.
Ron sat heavily, rolling his eyes to us. "Your welcome. Glad to be comic relief to the both of you." He grumbled. "So as you were saying 'she spoke'?"
"Don't call me that." I scowled at him, indignified from being called cute. "...And stop hugging me, it might lead me to assume something else," I whispered the last part.
Draco took several gulps of air before continuing. "And Ms. Vane did not even stop from that. This morning, she went too far. She steals something from me, that had once belonged to my brother."
Before Hermione could reach me, Ron came in front of her, trying to protect her from something. As Ron's eyes blazed, I realize that he was protecting Hermione from me. Me!
Dazed by what is actually happening and looking like a fool as I am standing on the side. When I heard Ginny's hurt voice spoke loud at Michael. "Michael, are you calling me a bitch? Is that what I am to you?"
Summary: Harry Potter's life changed drastically, turning around 160 degrees completely. In an accident, he turned into a creature of the dark, feared by all. When the temptation for the call of the blood and flesh becomes too much for Harry. He becomes desperate and seeks help but many of his friends and colleagues turned away from terror and disgust. True bonds are revealed. Friendships are tested. Draco Malfoy, an old enemy, unexpectedly, becomes the light of Harry's dark world.
As we all have reached the Burrow, home of the Weasleys, after an exhausting day at Diagon Alley. Obviously, almost all of us were all unbelieving of what happens between the Malfoys and us.
Then, suddenly my ears picked up a rustling sound. I stood up, alarmed. "Guys, I think it's not the right time to think about this stuff right now."
"I think, Harry" Hermione, with her bushy brown hair, paced in front of me, back and forth. "We should tell this to Sirius when he gets back from St. Mungo. He might know something since these all started after that incident"
"The result of our experiment meant you are most likely to hunt and eat beings that have high magical power, as the soup was from a horned rabbit, a magical creature of the east. That would also include us, wizards, and witches along with other magical creatures." Draco replied with seriousness in his voice. "With it, we also concluded what creature you might have become."
"Geez. Thanks, Hermione for the whole work-up." I sarcastically murmured as I gave her a sardonic smile.

As I gaze upon them, gasps could be heard. Fear tingle my senses, a particular scent had gotten my attention.

You look awful, Harry" George said as he sat near us in the Great hall. We were all eating for breakfast that morning before our first class. Well, to be exact, They were eating while I was trying to eat, putting all my effort not to puke.
'Of course, Harry dear. Didn't they tell you? Life is not fair.' A familiar feminine voice spoke, suddenly.
"Hey! That's unfair. I have lived most of my life in the muggle society and don't compare a genius to me." I said in defense. "No offense, Hermione but you are really a genius." I continued as I saw Hermione started to open her mouth to deny my statement.
As I open eyes after finishing that delectable dish, I realized everybody was staring at me, with an exception of Tiffany, with a mixture of relief and amusement on their expression.
1. The time zone of this tale is between the end of the 3rd year and the starting of 4th year, obviously, the Triwizard Tournament didn't happen in this universe.

Ron dived to grabbed the plates of food and he took a huge bite on one of the chicken legs. Meanwhile, Hermione was scolding him for shouting while her face was red - clearly embarrassed by Ron praising her. Really, if the two of them could stop dancing around from each other. It will be a lot better.
Hermione looked up from her work and must have seen the disbelief in my eyes. She started to giggle. "I know it's hard to get used to it. Seeing him like that. Believe me, on my first day here, I was also too shocked to move when I saw him being nice to his house-elf and cleaning the house, voluntarily." She smiled at me as her gaze returned to Malfoy as he was now stirring the hot pot of soup instead of his house-elf while the house-elf started to open the oven and took out the freshly baked loaves of bread.
A terrified voice spoke. "Call Headmaster Dumbeldore from his office." It was Professor McGonagall. "I don't care if he is in a meeting with the officials. Tell him that a student is down!"
Draco's poised posture and his elegance made me swallow as my mouth, which was full of spit as I was salivating from the site that I was seeing. Then, suddenly, he took a sprint - his steps were so light and soundless - and on his hand, he has his wand ready to strike at any time - like a sharp dagger.
"Yes, I still do have them but they have to less compared to before," I muttered as I pretended to be busy with my stuff.
Hermione stood there as she came stumbling towards me and grabbing my shirt. "Draco is fine now. Please stop."
Draco looked up and stared at me, intensely. I huddled down inside my oversized pajama, which I forgot to change when Hermione and Draco were both insisting on me to eat first. I need to find better clothes to wear if I were to live with Draco, even for a short period of time. I don't want to look bad.
“Master, the bread from the oven is already baked.” The house-elf called out. Saving me from further embarrassing myself as the awkward moment vaporized.
"Ah, what?" Ron said as he eyed the statue with disgust. "Whatever it is, it does look a bit like Crookshanks."
“Sure,” I muttered as I hop towards the drawers to grab some clothes. Pulling out a fresh pair of undies, a woolly fitted pair of black pants, and a faded red turtle neck sweater matching it with a pair of black rubber shoes. Then finally, checking myself in front of the mirror as I try to fix my helpless hair. It took me 6 minutes to finally give up on this bird nest hair of mine. At least, I am decent looking. I wouldn’t want Malfoy to think less of me; If I am wearing something sloppy. I went out of my room as I descended the stairs and walk with a skip in my feet as I slowly approached the kitchen.
"I am not an idiot, Granger. Please do be reminded of that. You might be the most intelligent witch in our year but I am the most cunning wizard of our batch." He spoke in a smug manner as he arrogantly eyed me. "I know Potter was turned away from Hogwarts. If not, why do the two of you have been hiding in the forest away from Harry Potter's so-called friends and protectors?"
Snapping me from my day-dreaming, I searched for the source of the voice. There, from the far corner of the room, a female house-elf stood. A flash of anger blooms in me as soon as I saw the little creature.
“Wow. Moine is right. That outfit looks good on you, Harry.” Malfoy's gaze held appreciation as he turns off the stove and walks towards me.
A bird screeched, cutting the silence. No one relaxed until the bird flew past by. After a few minutes of wandering in the forest had turned into hours. I smell a scent tantalizing this time. Excited, I signaled at Hermione and Draco to get ready, my whole body vibrating. Like it was getting ready to hunt, different in the way I respond to the great moose that Draco killed. I heard the rustling of the bushes and creaks of the branches that broke from being step on. A faint shadow emerged from the darkness and advanced down the thick trees.
"Then, Potter would have more surprise and would be angry at us for not telling him anything." Draco nagged at us as he continues his breakfast, with poise and grace.
Everything had been going well for me, these past few days. With the regular drinking of the dreamless potion, I wasn't able to dream about HER again. And I was also grateful for the small leather pouch that Malfoy gave me. The blood pebbles did a great job in curbing my appetite but it still unable to fully satisfy me. Well, it's better than having none, right?
“What it is?” I asked as my mouth watered from the appetizing smell and the meat looked so juicy and tender.
Waving our wands to shrink everything into Hermione's beaded bag that was charmed with Undetected expansion spell. In about ten minutes, we were all done and we move out of the area to a different location with Disapparation.
"Tell me, Granger. What is Morgan's name that did happen to Potter to make him...like this? Or do I have to pry it out of you? Because seriously, I really could use a bit of information and a reason, on why should I let Potter here live." He continued as he tried to encircled around Harry with a knowing look in his eyes.
Then the back door open with a slam, Mr. Weasley almost run into Mrs. Weasley in rush, his face was pale and beads of cold sweat trickle on his forehead, but what was so prominent in his feature and expression is full-blown panic.
Ginny step closer to her mother, as she sensed her mother's distress and hugged her. "Of what, Mom?"
"I heard from Hermione that you were still having the nightmares?" Remus asked.  As Remus moved to sit on the bed. It made a squeaking sound and the slight trembling was felt.
'Live?' She asked. 'Can you hear your heartbeat? It's becoming weak. Your breath, can you feel yourself gasping? Are sure you're going to live, Harry - darling?'
The grey sky grew darker as it restlessly grumbled. The clouds were thick and blackened as they float above the sky, they struggle to withstand the heavyweight as they held the rain, which was soon to fall. Then the rain poured down; the drops fell on the leaves and to the ground.
"I'll take care of him" Ginny steadied me as I stood. "You should rest for the meantime, Harry. Lie down on the divan."
If the situation wasn't too dire, I would laugh with Hermione's panicking - her facial expression and her worrying like mom. I almost crack a smile.
"Stop this Mr. Potter. This is immaturity!" Alastor Moody bellowed as he marched up to me with a wooden leg.
Author’s notes: This tale focus on the darker aspect of life, such as blood, flesh, temptation, betrayal, hatred, and revenge along with it is hope and love. You have been warned!
Nothing mattered. But my hunger and his blood. My mouth watered and my throat burned like fire. My stomach twisted and my muscles coiled ready to spring at my prey.
"I don't want to know your nightly escapades, Potter. Please spare me from the details. I don't want to vomit early in the morning." He drawl at me while looking away.
Draco Malfoy stood behind us as the rest of the Slytherin had arrived. Crabbe and Goyle behind him were glaring menacingly at Ron.
Malfoy slowly walk towards Angelina and reached out to a small notebook that had a blue hue cover. Michael reacted almost immediately as he made to snatch the small notebook but unable to grab it as Malfoy avoided his hands.
Malfoy took out a bag and open it, taking something out from it then he suddenly threw it out the air - tiny beads and as the light reflected on them, it shines red in color. Then the Darah Nagas came taking one bead at a time, that when it registers in me - that was their food. I tried sniffing and I did smell it - the faint fragrance of blood.
"Okay," Hermione uttered. "After all, I feed you almost half of the supply I had. I think we should really consider what is most of your diet? how many hours or days before your next hunger strike? or Can you still eat other things?"
Both Ron and Hermione's faces had gone pale as they indeed recall it. They slowly both nodded, knowing that I am to say something very serious and terrifying. Especially, Hermione. Since both I and Hermione were the most affected ones in that accident.
5. Appetite (Not an ability, Hermione!) (Harry, stop it with the comments) (Raw animal blood, Raw animal meat and needs more information by Hermione)
"Me, too," Seamus whispered back to Dean and faced Ron. "The Irish's fan, that's me" Seamus grinned back. "Let's see who will win in the tournament!"
Before me,  was a shocked Hermione as she realized that I was awake. I felt extremely awkward and scared as I remember the way I have singularly chased after my best friend to murder her and, even I want to justify myself as I was not in my right mind when I did it. I still did it intending to harm her. I felt ashamed and disgusted with myself. Lowering my head as I couldn't bear to look at her, in guilt.
With nothing else to do, I roamed for a while. Walking onward, through the veil of snowflakes when suddenly a rush of strong cold wind blew past me, it ruffled my hair and fluttered my clothes.
Following the little creature to the kitchen, what I saw there gave me an illusion that I might have been dreaming after all. Freaking Draco Malfoy was actually cooking while his house-elf was there! Malfoy must have heard as he turns to us and saw my ridiculous expression, choosing to ignore me - he called out. "Tiffany, help me. Start the oven would you?"
The hair on my skin raised as a premonition of the danger of that action, by instinct I avoided the hit as I skid to the other side.
Malfoy didn't speak but reached for his pocket and showed a locket, that was silver and had the most beautiful design of vines and roses, embedded with diamonds. No wonder Romilda will steal it. She was after all, into beautiful, expensive, and luxury things.
"Try drinking this moose's blood." He said as he tilted his head to look at me but my vision strayed unto his pale neck that wasn't covered by his winter coat. To me, his neck was more tempting than the moose's blood.
"But I do agree with him on this one, Albus." A woman's voice said with apparent anger in it. Professor McGonagall came in with strong strides.
Malfoy, who was still inside our compartment sighed in annoyance as he rolls his eyes. "They're overreacting. I was gone for only 2 minutes."
I become dizzy and almost fainted on the spot if not for Hermione gently breaking down the facts and details when she got to the part that I might transform my features into what was describe as a monstrous being - a mixture of a wolf, bat, lizard or even a scorpion - that Hermione has to stop as I almost fell out from my chair.
Slowly glancing at the other person in the room, as my curiosity and my short-lived courage urge me, my body froze as soon as I caught a glimpse of him. He was staring at me with such intensity and a lazy and pleased smile appeared on his pink and plum lips. A hot rush spread throughout my body, I felt too warm underneath my skin and a chill electrifies me to the bones. I told myself to breathe as I become nervous and giddy at the same time.
A red-haired boy, with freckles across his two cheeks, was peeking from the gap of the door. Ron, my other best friend, was giving that suspicious look, shaded by the color green of jealousy. I had to stop my eyes from rolling. Seriously, up until now, he still thinks that I would take up an interest in Hermione.
“Yesssh…” He smirked at us as he slowly answered, prolonging the ‘s’-sound of the word, making me gulped hard. He trudged through the forest path and we hurriedly follow him.
Then the next thing that had to happen scared the wits out of me as Malfoy laugh in a spine-chilling manner and when I saw his eyes, sweats started to broke out from my body. His eyes had madness in them, that I am sure everyone could see as Professor McGonagall took a step back, Snape changed his stance into a guarded one, and the three of us stood from our couch ready to do anything if it is necessary. The only one who was not affected is the Headmaster, himself.
The voice replied at last. After a minute, the cave shook as a pounding of something came from the direction of where we came from. The dust and the drips from stalagmites started to fall over us.
"I- I was- I mean we were-" I started but could not say anything to salvage the situation. Being walk-in by your best friend, who is also the mutual friend of your girlfriend while making out with your ex-rival is not on my wish list!
The cave was enormous and intimidating - with impenetrable darkness at its entrance. No plants grew near it but what surrounds it is a jungle. The black and gray rocks formed the mouth of the cave and stalagmites at the ceilings the floor made the cave look-like a sleeping beast with its toothed-mouth open, waiting for its prey to willing walk inside to be devoured.
"Stop it, Guys!" Ginny intervened beside me. "If you, two continue with the contest of evil smiles. Then everybody especially Ron will be shaking in fear."
"Not really, Mr. Corner" Hermione said in a determined voice. "Yes, it is true that you are injured because of Harry, a member of our quidditch team but you also inflict the same injuries on Harry. And Mr. Corner, you are also a member of the Ravenclaw quidditch team. Thus both will be disqualified from both respective teams. And let's add that evidence (small notebook) that you have been spying us - that may lead to another thing which also bad for your team."
"I'm fine, Ron." I said as I leaned away from him. To avoid being spit on. "She just spoke that's why the pain came."
"I guess, the days when I didn't eat much had a bad effect on me." I, timidly, scratch the back of my head. Trying to reason out of what is happening to me. "That's why my body is trying to compensate right now."
"Harry." The blonde said in a gentle tone that took all my attention. "You don't have to suffer anymore. You can eat my flesh and drink my blood. Go on, eat."
Hermione was still standing in-front of me with her hands stretched out towards me, wary and determined - I froze, appalled of what I was about to do, and what was I doing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Her face turns red again from embarrassment. Then I slowly bowed my head to her face as I did so. She tiptoes and closed her eyes waiting for me. I let my lips touched hers. I felt a chill travel around my body as we kissed.
My heart is hammering inside my ribcage. I could hear my heavy breathing and the sweat had soaked me, was enough to fill a bottle. But I could still feel her presence as she runs the chilling knife around my neck, digging deeper as it slides over my skin - even though the nightmare already ended. I shivered as I remember the way she took the knife and show it to me then she made me hold it with both of my hands, guiding me to slice a piece of flesh from the chunk of meat in front me. Oddly, the upper part was cover with a cloth. And as the flesh was cut off, my demon took the fallen piece and slowly made me open my mouth, to shove the meat inside.
Blushing, Hermione shakes her head. "I'm sorry, Headmaster. It was too dark so I wasn't able to see it clearly."
"You're telling me to calm down when Sirius has been missing for THREE MONTHS! THREE MONTHS!" I snapped at the Adults, who were under the Order of the Phoenix. "And they did not even tell me once!!!"
As the three started to move out, a loud rumble sounded out. Shaking the ground with ferocity, making us fall to the ground.
But instead of bullying me as usual, Draco just stared at me, from my feet to my thighs then to my face, that had made me feel so squishy inside and I fidgeted from his leering.
Trying to recover, Michael lookup. "I-I going to tell Professor Flitwick this. So you all will be disqualified."
Sighing, I surrender in with their sound arguments. I followed them obediently out of the room, in which I am staying in, going down the stairs to the kitchen. Upon arriving in the kitchen, the warm aura and wafting smell of the cooked meal spread throughout the room, reminding me of the warmth that I have missed from the Weasleys' home. The kitchen itself was not grandiose, unlike what I have imagined that a Malfoy would own but it was still elegant, the walls were made of fine white wood while the cabinets and cupboards were made up with light brown pine wood, the floor made of white stones and, tables and chairs made of warm brown Narra wood. On the stove, a steaming pot was being stirred by a small being that was trying not to fall-off from the high chair, it was standing on.
'Shit! Stop admiring.' I scolded myself but my eyes were still on him without any intention to shift my gaze as I was afraid that I would miss anything.
"Are going mental, Harry-mate?" Ron said with a slacked jaw as he stared at me, making his blue eyes larger than the original size.
Then she stops suddenly. Still coughing and trying to inhale as many airs as I can, I watched her as she froze in place staring beyond the horizon. She whispered. "Someone else is here"
"Harry!" She weeps as she walks weakly towards me then abruptly running towards the blonde male. "Malfoy, what should I do? I have done all the things that the books had to describe, the ones that I got from Hogwarts. Some of their suggestions have work. But this...I just don't know what to do. Please Malfoy help us!"
Trying to calm down my instinct, I kept myself from fighting the chains but instead settled down to sit up as I tried to gaze upon Hermione, now my only friend. "It's alright, Hermione. I understand."
A stoic man, long pale blond hair, dressed in what seems to be expensive black dress robes, Mr. Lucius Malfoy and behind him, was a mini version of him, shoulder-length and almost white hair, also clothed with expensive robes but instead of black, his was White to silver in color, Draco Malfoy.
I was a bit disappointed with Hermione's answer but it was reasonable. But I couldn't stop myself from expecting more. More of what? I don't know. I just want more...
“Yes, I guess here in our country, such creatures are rare but in the warm climate continents, they are mostly seen. The frustrating part is that the meat on your plate is from an old one. We can’t buy the young ones because that would be breaking the protection act on these guys but since eating it has good effects for the magical development of a wizard that’s why even old beasts are still popular within the wizardry community. Don’t worry it’s not that expensive. Father bought it from the black market, which was sold at half the original price.” He explained as he took a bite from his cut croissant.
I set aside my feather from scribbling my charms' answers and straighten up from my seat - looking around if there were still people around. The common rooms were empty except for us- sitting by the fire. Hermione took her wand and perform a private bubble spell. I look back at Hermione, who just smiles at me, and Ron, who was confused but was waiting.
As she spoke, I ran up to the mirror to look at my eyes, especially my pupils. I didn't want my eyes to become like hers, colored in dark red. When I have seen that nothing changed even the color except that my eyes were more vivid than the dullness in them because of my blurred vision. I sighed a relief.
Malcolm Baddock took off the hat and went straight to the Slytherin table where the occupants applauded as he took his seat. I could see Malfoy clapping in a regal manner as Baddock joined them but something was odd. The way that Baddock head first to Malfoy, giving him a slight bow was kind of...unnerving. Maybe in the Slytherin, you have to acknowledge the senior first before you can be a part of them but that would be nonsense since if that is supposed to be then why Malfoy? It should have been the 6th years or even the 7th years, that Baddock should offer his respect, right?
Blood was trailing over my footsteps. Trembling, I look down at myself. I was soaked entirely. Assaulting my senses and invading my thoughts.
As I was following her, I realize the she-elf was wearing a cute blue dress that surprises me to no end. Usually, house-elves are dressed in rags - the best example that I could think of is Dobby, who was also was once a house-elf serving the Malfoys but now, a free elf.
"Remus, it's good to see you," I uttered as I move away from Sirius to hug the said man. "I miss them" I, vaguely, though.
Malfoy sighs. "Alright. but be prepared, it's a good thing you're a Gryffindor because this is not a pretty sight to see." He warns me. "I want you to be ready with anything I ask for, Granger. Anything." He emphasizes.
"You caught that,  Ms. Granger," Malfoy said, still with a cold smile. "As I said they are harmless as long as they didn't evolve. The thing is they are called Blood Dragon and it is not just a name. In every place, situation, or climate change, they have the capacity to transform can survive. They are the ever-evolving creatures."
Then, a burst of well profound laughter sounded from him as he found my situation funny, clutching his side from laughing too hard.
"Hear, Hear" Both, me and Ron uttered loudly as our plates were filled with different kinds of food and our goblets filled up with pumpkin juice.
Then, he raised his head to separate our lips as he heard me.  I gasp and whine with the sudden interruption of this addictive feeling.
With my enhanced magic abilities, the two Hobgoblin went flying as high as 10 feet before falling down the ground with a loud thud sound. I rushed back to Draco and Hermione.
A few of our friends came looking for us as the afternoon progressed. Neville Longbottom, Seamus Finnigan, and Dean Thomas sat with us talking about the latest Quidditch games and the recent updates.
Unwilling, my body started to shudder and there was a heavy feeling in my chest, so I gasp out for air and as it filled my lungs, the scents hit me hard - Hunger, that was the first thing I could think. A rumbled came within me, like a snarling wolf. My mouth filled up with saliva and my teeth sharpened. I don't know what was happening to me but I know that I am hungry and their food out there to eat.
After a few minutes of him reading, he finally looks up at me and slowly smirks in a lazy but sexy way as he found out my ogling. Out of embarrassment, I just fake cough and turned away from him, hiding my reddening face.
"Ah. You meant this beauty?" Malfoy smiled for the first time. A true smile. It was beautiful on him. "She is the queen."
I closed my eyes and slowly breathe in through my nose and breathe out through my mouth as I tried to collect my thoughts and do recreate the expression on my face that I know might be blushing from my excitement. There were so many things that I wanted to ask but  I couldn't find the opportunity to inquiry about because of him being a great distraction for me.
It has been two days since my last encounter with Malfoy. But I still haven't come in terms of asking help from my rival or should I call him ex-rival?
Shrieking and growling as I snap my jaws, as I force my body to twist against the ropes, breaking my skin and making me bleed. Raking my claws against the tree as they got tore.
I felt chills run on my back as his warm breath tickled my face. Soon I realized the words that he had said, I tried to inhale and exhale slowly to composed myself in able to hinder the change in the colors of my eyes.
'The boy who lived, Mr. Harry James Potter, son of the late Mr. James Potter and Mrs. Lily Evans-Potter might have a secret that finally been discovered when he accidentally transformed into a hideous dark creature triggered by his injured during the last Quidditch match of Gryffindors vs. Ravenclaw. Some say that Mr. Potter's true-form was the reason why he had defeated the Dark Lord as he was the next Dark Lord to rise!'

Snarling, Sirius stomped as he strides to confront Mr. Malfoy. "Yeah, too bad ain't it  because then no one is going to smack that mouth of yours."
Professor Sprout, the Herbology teacher and the head of Hufflepuff house, a squat little witch who wore a hat over her flyaway hair, was also with a deep conversation with professor Hooch, the flying instructor, who had a short, grey hair and yellow eyes like a hawk and Professor Trelawney, who teaches divination, is a thin woman with thick glasses that magnified her eyes and was drowning in her shawls and cloaks and bangles.
My run had slowed down as my blood slowly gushed out from my wound. Cold-sweat poured from my forehead if I could only let Hermione escape to safety. "I'm f-fine" I rasped out, wincing from the pain.
"Shut up, Granger." He said then brought the knife to his left hand and slice across. The blood from his hand was dripping fast and as its scent hits me, I started to struggle more. But the lad didn't panic or flinch away from me instead he walked slowly towards me. A very unusual sight that had made me stunned as I cease from moving and fighting my ropes. And upon reaching me, unexpectedly, he raised his wounded hand and place it on my lips.
"Thanks." I took the cup with both of my hands and took a long sip. As take the hot chocolate it warms my body as it passes by my throat to the pit of my stomach. I release a sigh of relief.
"My nightmares..." I grunted out. Trying to calm my fear inside of me. Fear of being rejected and fear of accepting my current situation as true. "My nightmares had been getting worse."
After we escape from whoever was trying to break into our camp that morning, Hermione and I were able to set-up our tent on another site that perfectly hides us from animals and humans, alike. Under the concealing charms, anti-detection charms, alarms set around the camp, and add to that- the camouflage that both of us created from the leaves, branches, and bushes, I think we'll be safe for now.
"Harry?" Hermione asked as she looks at me, with curiosity, along her Ginny was worriedly watching me. "Is something wrong?"
"That's the thing. We don't want to study too hard" Ron muttered in his breath. I chuckled as I heard him.
Draco Malfoy entered, without a word, and shut the door, abruptly before leaning on it. Apparently, Malfoy is all alone since Crabbe and Goyle weren't following him behind.
After a good minute, I finally come to terms with my inner struggle that this is really happening. I slowly took out a chair from the dining set and sat in an abandoned way as the chair creak from the forceful way, I sat down. Hearing the creak, I could hear Malfoy grumbled, quietly.
"Yes, you are." He said suddenly that I snapped my attention to him. "YOU. ARE. A. BITCH!" He gnarls at her.
"No, I mean. Instead of being at Hogwarts, why are you here in the forest?" I sighed and politely asked. "Not that I am not grateful for you being here with us, it is just-"
"I was just thinking if we ever could go back to the way it was before," I muttered with a regretful sigh while casually taking a sip of that hot chocolate which I assume Hermione already did the privilege of adding drops of her blood.  "Before all these happen."
"Knock. Knock. A knut for a thought?" A feminine voice sounded out from the direction of my open door. Hermione stood there holding two steaming hot mugs with I suppose to be chocolate, I could tell from the smell.
"You know very well, that endangered magical creature cannot be kept as a pet, Malfoy," Hermione said as she gritted her teeth.
Summary: Harry Potter’s life changed drastically, turning around 160 degrees completely. In an accident, he turned into a creature of the dark, feared by all. When the temptation for the call of the blood and flesh becomes too much for Harry. He becomes desperate and seeks help but many of his friends and colleagues turned away from terror and disgust. True bonds are revealed. Friendships are tested. Draco Malfoy, an old enemy, unexpectedly, becomes the light of Harry’s dark world.
A minute has gone by after I spoke. Maybe, both Hermione and I had not thought of any option regarding the proposition of Professor Dumbledor's letter that causes me to be speechless in the said matter.
"That's another thing!" Hermione hollered suddenly. "And those men that were following us, who they were?" Realizing that she was shouting at the top of voice, she blushed then turns to me. "Sorry... I just got a bit of..."
After all, I'm to blame as I have been ignoring the signs that there was indeed something happening to me.
I’ve become too conscious upon discovering my new profound emotion towards my so-called savior, a long-time rival, and now my ex-enemy. I subconsciously, glance towards him and couldn’t stop myself from fidgeting about my appearance and I, even, watch out on how I should act in front of him, despite my reluctance to accept that – this is happening to me at this point of my life.
"Yes, let's do that." She said as she took my hand ushering me away from the whole group. "To Headmaster Dumbeldore?"
Shutting my mouth closed, I continue to stare at them, trying to snap out from my dream. This is a dream, right? A weird dream, where Hermione and Draco are having friendly banter in front of me about my health. Maybe I should also check my mental health.
He drew his fist back again and came charging; for a brief instant, his eyes widened as I dodged his fist before he managed to tilt his head back and slam it into mine. Blood erupted from the cut that was made from the impact on the side of my head, right above my left ear. As we stood apart from each other, I realized that all of our teammates were surrounding us. Hermione and Ginny shouted in vain to stop us. The Professors were coming towards us, yelling words of promised punishments, if we don't stop from our fistfight, right now.
"But?!" Ginny's hysterical voice sounded out. "BUT WHAT?!" I can still feel her hands gripping my right hand. She was desperate and her tears keep on falling onto my knuckles.
"How do you feel?" A quiet masculine voice whispered in my ear. I turned to Draco as I heard him asked.
I didn't know who threw the first punch, but suddenly my fist was slamming into his face while he plowed into my stomach. Blood surged from his mouth as I gagged from the pain erupted from his hit. We stumbled apart for a brief second to catch our breaths before diving back at each other. He threw his body weight behind the fist that edged closer to my face, it hit my jaw with such force, that blood pooled into my mouth, pain erupted from the point of impact. Stars burst in my vision but I shook it off, blinding throwing a sloppy kick. He stepped back, easily evading the kick.
"NO!!! That's mine." Michael shouted as he losses his temper and made a charge towards Malfoy. Making an angry sound in his throat as he went for the dive.
"Harry!" Hermione came. She was trying to enter the crowd as she elbows the twins with much strength. Her face was still worried but yet she was grinning as she was captured by the happiness that had erupted in her housemates. "Congrats."
"What was it?" Ginny sat beside me as she looks up to her, waiting for her answer. Hermione then sat across me and began loading her plate with a piece of bread before paying attention to the conversation.
Malfoy also rose from his seat and did something that shocks the three of us, he did a half-bow towards Professor McGonagall. "My apologies as well for not reporting first before doing my actions. It is, after all, my responsibility as a student to let the professors do their duty as our guide and protector."
I took him in my embrace in an eager, passionate way and my tongue seemed to disappear inside his mouth as he let my tongue slip past his redden lips and I dive desperately as if I needed a part of him to breathe.
I tensed as I heard him. My heart slam against my chest and my throat dried up, almost immediately. "What have I become, Draco?"
Clutching my abused head as kneeling on the floor, crying out. Nursing my injury, I glared at Draco with all my might.
As if remembering that we are wizards and not muggles, Michael took out his wand and pointed it at me. Coward! Since he can't win by duel of fists or duel through Quidditch, he would cowardly use his wand on an opponent that doesn't have any weapon of some sort. Malfoy was far better than him. At least, he would wait for me to draw my wand. Challenging me, a respectful rival. Michael started to yell words to attack me in rage, forgetting that it might result in his expulsion. He yelped out the Entrail-Expelling Curse.
She tapping her left foot as she was patiently waiting for more while her hands were so busy with the plant that we were fertilizing.
"What about them?" Sirius asked as he looks at me. I was quiet for a while as I gather my thoughts on how I could explain this to Sirius. My reasons are kinda off.
She got up from her seat, coming to me and tug my sleeves. I frowned at her as I was still angry at her for that incident.
"It's n-not Harry's fault" Still trembling, the female said. "He just went out of control from the Acromantulas' attack."
Flabbergasted, I kept on staring at him even Tiffany, the she-elf took the tray from me and have been giggling non-stop at my antics.
"Harry, Is sleeping?" I uttered in a puzzled state but, that's impossible! Harry, ever since he had been turned, he was never able to sleep.
“I want to compare them from the previous data, there might be another development in terms of skills or feature that might have to escape your notice.” He explained in his cool and alluring voice.
"But," I whispered. As soon as he heard me, he looks up with intense grey eyes, waiting for me to continue.
'They will save me. I know they will do.' I argue back at her. 'I am not going to fall into your trap.'
All the adults shared that look as they stared at each other then finally Mrs. Weasley spoke. "Lyra." She sighed.  "Lucian Lyra Malfoy. Draco Malfoy's older sibling  and supposed to be the heir of the Malfoy family."
I turned to the headmaster Dumbledore and spoke about our summer's adventure with the Gulon and the nightmares.
Another shiver runs all over my body as he spoke my name. I was filled with anticipation. That’s when I know I had it bad.
Then a roar was heard - like a lion with a bark of a vicious wolf. I saw it as it had reached us at last. From where the tunnel that we came from was ahead of a dog with the cat's ears and eyes, along with three horns on the top its head was peeking - as hideous it was and frightening - it was nothing against its expression it showed when it finally saw us. Its face turns into a gleeful look - eyes that held hunger and absolute happiness as its mouth warp into a human-like smile and inside its mouth were three rows at the upper and another two rows of razor-sharp teeth at the bottom part. I held my breath as chills run up and down my body. I could move from my spot along with Ron and Hermione.
"Let's do that," I said as I hurriedly march in front of her, trying to find an area to camp as soon as possible.
A booming bell echoed through the castle signaling the start of the classes, the three of us, went to our first class, which is Care of Magic Creature. We headed to Hagrid's small wooden cabin, which stood on the edge of the Forbidden forest.
"I..." Sighing as I try to think of any ideas that pop out of my head. "To be honest, Hermione. I am not sure as well."
"Guys, it's okay to express your feelings with one another but I would appreciate it if you do it in the privacy of your bedrooms." She said in a completely amused tone. "Next time."
"Let's move Hermione to her room." He said casually as if he didn't just make me feel like a hundred butterflies are flying inside my stomach. "I'll bet she'll complain of back-ache in the morning if she keeps sleeping in that position."
“Yes, master, with pleasure.” Tiffany bounces from her sit as she was in the middle of her biting her bread and zoom towards the sink near the stove, coming back with a plate big slabs of meat semi-cooked to Draco.
"I can and I will. After all, I am to be expelled. I am simply taking it to my own hands so I can achieve my rights against your unjust decision on my part in this incident." He said as stood up ready to leave the premises of the office. "Then I will be leaving to pack. After all, this meeting had already concluded my fate in this school."
"Potter." Said a quiet, calm, and confident voice behind me. As I felt the tug on my shirt, I turn towards Malfoy, who was standing near me.
A hearty laugh came out of Mr. Weasley as he also took Sirius' hand and shook it. "Sirius, I told you to call me Arthur and it is also good to see you."
It's a good thing, Billy and Charlie were both home and had some sort of vehicle to help us be transported to our destination. A small car from Charlie and a motorcycle from Billy. Of course, all the trunks were put in the car while the twins immediately took the sit on the motorcycle and all the rest got jammed pack in Charlie's car even with the help of magic to make it spacious.
"I'll be fine." Mrs. Weasley said, softly. "Just take care of him, even his wife. She might also be in shock of what did happen to her child."
A scent of a familiar person's blood spread throughout the area before I heard Hermione's frantic shout.
"Ah..., that was fun." He snickered at me. "Right, Tiffany?" He asked his elf as he turns his cup towards it and Tiffany dutifully refills the cup. "Yes, Master. Young miss Granger is funny." It said happily as it giggled, innocently. But I won't be fooled by that naive act and face.
“Give it to me.” He said as he took look at my face. Maybe, he saw the defeat on my expression as he whispered to me.
But as soon it paws reach inside the dark concave tunnel, the Gulon's whole expression turned to 180 degrees change - its smile melted and formed into an unexpected expression - terror. Its eyes widen, pupils dilated as it searched the concave walls - like it was expecting something else. Then surprisingly, the Gulon run away from us as fast it can. Leaving in a hurry.
“No…no, no, no” I frantically repudiated. Like I was more like trying to convince myself instead of the stranger in front of me.
Could I really die in my sleep? Will this ever stop? Could I still wake up? Will I ever have peace? Please stop. Please.
Beside him, Charlie guffawed at my embarrassed face. Growing red at every minute that I spend with them, even Remus apologized, which made the others laughed more.
"As for the reason." Malfoy intervened whatever Hermione gonna say. "It's personal. Ah... Well, you are going to know about it anyway might as well say it on your faces so I can see your reactions. And I got to savor your taunting."
"Harry?" A red-haired girl called out as she slowly stood up from where she was, timidly. A male was beside her, with the same red hair. My guess, they were brother-sister. And another female, who was on guard,  with busy brown hair.
"Here." He reached out then took my hand placing a small pouch. "These could help you to curb your hunger for the meantime."
Immediately, Ron's worried face brighten up at the prospect of food. "That's right, Harry. I'm also hungry." He followed me with glee. As we both went to the Great hall and reaching the Gryffindor's table, Hermione was already there, eating salad. Upon seeing us, Hermione waved, urging us to come and join her.
Grimace started to invade my face as I heard his words. "You forgot Ron, Malfoy. He is still Harry's best friend and Ginny, who is his girlfriend. Also, there are many more who are friends and who cares for Harry." I retorted.
"A Hemotropic butterfly is a crimson-colored butterfly that lived in the deepest part of the forbidden forest or could be found in Zevil Island. They are harmless insects that are attracted to the scent of blood and feed on the wounds of bigger creatures." Hermione said in an exasperated voice.
"Maybe. I should really stop, Harry. You don't look so good." She mumbled as she looks at me in concern.
A wave of raging anger flushes out of me as I remember how my friends turn their back at me. The memory of it was so strong that I snarled. "What about them?!"
Harry fidgeted nervously in the small room behind the staff table. He could hear the Sorting begin out in the Great Hall, his body rigid with anxiety as he waited for his son's name to be called – and the uproar that would likely follow.
"I didn't know," he said softly when the potion forced a response. "I don't approve of the things my father did."
, he thought, his eyes narrowing as he looked over at Draco, who was hidden from Snape's view by the back of the chair. Snape had just watched
"Sorry?" Draco echoed, squeezing his eyes shut when Harry's hot lips skated over his exposed collarbone, pressing a trail of kisses across his firm chest and licking the defined valley between his pectorals.
“Right then,” she muttered to herself, smoothing her hands over her short leather skirt. Her hands followed the curve of her arse, admiring the tight leather that stopped almost indecently high. She threw her robes over her nearly sheer blouse, covering up the fact that she had forgone a bra.
"Everything is in order," he said, his voice taking on the slightly officious tone he used for Ministry business. "Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy, please take your places here," he said indicating a tall table Harry had placed there earlier for that purpose.
Resolved to get it right this time, Theo concentrated fully on the parchment, envisioning it as a strong sapling with vibrant green leaves. He leveled his wand and cast, pouring his vision into the words as they passed his lips.
It was true, partially. The wards needed to monitor the health of the grapes had been extensive, and it hadn't truly been much more work to embed a few additional spells that would alert Neville or one of the others in the big, rambling chateau to trespassers. In his own way, Neville was as fiercely protective of Cal as Draco and Blaise were. He did everything he could to safeguard the boy, knowing Draco trusted him to watch over both Caleum and Narcissa when he was away.
"Bloody hell!" he yelped, instantly drawing his wand in defense. A whiff of a familiar floral perfume had him sheepishly returning the wand to his wrist holster.
Pansy gave him a small smile. If Draco really had made that food, there was no question it would taste marvelous, and she'd bet her company that there were a few bottles of excellently paired wine inside that seemingly bottomless basket as well.
Draco swallowed, unsure of what to say. Neville grabbed Harry by the robes, forcing him back onto the sofa while he tipped a vial of potion up to his lips.
“H-haven’t been h-having much luck with the s-spell,” he stuttered, his entire body tense from pleasure and fear of discovery.
Harry tried to look stern, but a grin broke through. He threw a pillow from a nearby chair at Hermione.
Teddy opened the magically sealed envelope carefully, prolonging Hermione's anguish. He had a pretty good idea what the solution was, and she was off by one important point.
"Alright," he said equably, laughing when she gaped at him in surprise. "We're all adults now, Hermione. We're hardly going to hex each other on sight."
"What?" Ron shouted, his hand automatically going for his wand. Harry grabbed his wrist, forcing it down.
"Don't be stupid," Ron answered, digging around in the familiar diaper bag to hand Harry the charmed bottles Ginny always prepared whenever she left the girl. He'd been around Freddie enough to know the signs of a hungry baby, no matter how oblivious everyone assumed he was.
Blaise grabbed Draco by the shoulders, ducking his head slightly so they were eye-to-eye. Draco had filled him in on the messy business of Gryffin actually being Harry Potter the day after the wedding. It had taken Blaise a bit to wrap his mind around it, but now he was positive Potter would be perfect for the blond. He just had to get Draco to see it, too.
Blaise gave a cursory rap against Draco's office door with his knuckles before entering. He sprawled inelegantly on a chair in front of Draco's desk, arching an eyebrow.
Harry wrinkled his nose, clicking around to see if there was a way to disable the notification. He wasn't technically available for chat – he only wanted to talk with Sly. He'd arrived in the chat room a few minutes early, and he wondered if that had been a mistake.
Harry frowned in confusion. "Well, yes," he said slowly, looking over at Draco. He looked confused as well. "We
Harry snorted, shaking his head. "Glad I left the Harry Potter part off, since his reaction to James Evans was bad enough."
Tentatively, Draco grasped his own cock, only slightly surprised when he didn't feel the motion. His hand became a blur as he quickened his strokes, sure Gryffin was feeling the sensations, just as he was feeling Gryffin's hand as though it was moving over his own aching erection.
"Of course," Theo said, Ginny disappearing. Draco could hear the thin wail of a newborn, and figured it must be time for Freddie to eat. "It's nothing serious. Just a precaution, really."
The Auror smiled, and Draco didn't care for the feral light in his eyes. His heart hammered in his chest. Everything he'd worked so hard for, all those years of hiding Cal away in France, his failed marriage, it was all for nothing. He could tell he wouldn't be leaving this room until the Auror had completely stripped him bare.
"Carina Luna Potter-Black," Draco said, his voice clear in the silent room. "Heir to the Potter family name. I think it suits her."
It seemed like a night that called for it, he mused, taking another sip from the leaded crystal glass.
"It's hardly your fault, Malfoy," he said, his voice laced with sympathy. No one down at the Ministry actually believed the charges that had been levied against Draco and his company, but all formal complaints had to be thoroughly investigated. "I'm sorry for the disruption this is causing. We'll be out from underfoot soon."
Draco didn't even pause to think before enveloping the larger man in a tight hug, squeezing him hard.
Ron's eyes flicked away, and Draco's suspicions grew. The redhead obviously knew something, something important.
Harry felt like he was on an emotional rollercoaster. He'd initially been giddy to hear from Sly, then angry that the other man hadn't had the consideration to email him when his trip was extended. That segued into the warm, fuzzy feeling he got while reading Sly's playful answers to his questions, which became a slight tingle of anticipation and desire when he read Sly's questions. And then, of course, irritation, since Hermione came back 10 minutes after Harry had finished reading (and re-reading) Sly's message and forced him to close down his email altogether so he could write without distraction.
Hermione hadn't heard that yet. She didn't think Harry was doing very well, if the point was romance. She hadn't understood the first or second gifts – albums and memorabilia from an American Muggle band? – and today's gift was equally odd, a book on the natural life cycle of the Magnolia tree. Clearly, Harry needed some help in the romance department.
The dark-haired wizard took it gratefully, wrapping it around himself toga-style and grabbing his clothes from the sofa. He sent a hard look at Draco before stalking across the floor, opening what he assumed was the door to Draco's bedroom so he could dress in privacy.
Harry's wand tip glowed bright silver when he finished, and runes appeared on Draco's skin, etched in silver over the places Harry had tapped his wand. Hermione strained forward slightly to read them, smiling as she recognized the symbols for intellect, heart and soul.
Harry shoved at the taller wizard, trying to get past him. Ron had just Fire-called with the news that Draco had been admitted to St. Mungo's, and he'd come as quickly as he could.
Ron shook his head, his expression still shell-shocked. The story Harry was telling him about his online mystery man had just meshed with something Hermione had told him yesterday. Something about Harry's odd reaction to something in the paper.
Hermione frowned, squinting at Harry's image in the mirror in front of them. The stylist hovered nearby, scissors raised, waiting for the verdict.
Draco roused himself out of his near slumber, mindful that he was still fully dressed and hadn't responded to the rather large pile of urgent owls that had accumulated on his desk down the hall. He'd been up all night with Caleum, neither wanting to waste any of their precious little time together. He'd finally left him just before dawn, tucking the covers around him and kissing him gently before spending another hour giving instructions to the staff about how to deal with the mood swings and tempers he knew Caleum would have when he woke to find Draco had left.
"A few weeks," he said lamely, shrugging. Sly couldn't meet before then, and Harry was busy with things for the wedding and the book, as well. There would be no point in trying to move up their meeting.
She heard a low groan from the kitchen, quickening her pace until she found the source – Harry, head down on the table, a mostly empty bottle of Ogden's Best and an overturned glass next to him. Her concern turned to anger, her lips tightening as she took in the scene in front of her.
"Wait," Seamus said, thumbing through the pages in the small notebook. "He said one other thing. Made even less sense than everything else. I'm a bit worried about him, to be honest. He said: Tell Draco he's amazing, and I'll do what I need to do to keep him safe."
"I just thought he might," Harry said easily, returning his emerald gaze to his son. He was already dressed in his Hogwarts robes, too excited to wait until he got on the train to change. He had a small cage with a tawny brown owl, a large trunk filled with books he couldn't wait to study, and all the supplies he could possibly need.
to marry him. He shook his head. He loved Harry like a son, but the man had such an infuriatingly black and white sense of right and wrong. He'd cut off his own leg before letting someone he loved make a mistake, and Kingsley was sure Harry was outlining all of the possible negative consequences of a union between himself and Draco. Of course, that was just Harry.
He heard others on the dance floor giggle, probably laughing at the fact that it appeared as though he couldn't take his eyes off his bride even for a moment.
"Go say goodbye to Cal," Blaise instructed, shooing the angry wizard out of the room. They had an hour to kill before they could Floo to Harry's house, and he might hex the blond if he stayed underfoot. "I'll go down and get Nev and Daphne."
Harry blushed slightly. He had no idea how old Sly was; he certainly hoped he was around his own age, but he tried not to think about it overmuch.
"I brought Ron because the bond will accept that we are not a threat since we are married," she said, receiving a tight smile and nod from Draco. "We still won't stay long. If what I've read is true, you two are physically uncomfortable in the presence of others, yes?"
Heavily lidded eyes blinked slowly as Draco's hand snaked around Harry's hip, roughly fondling his balls before pressing a knuckle against his perineum, making him gasp out loud again. He was transfixed as he watched a pale, slender finger disappear, his eyes finally drifting shut as he felt it trace a gentle pattern around his entrance. The finger was slick – Draco must have cast a wandless Lubrication Charm. A thrill rippled through Harry at the thought of having such a magically powerful partner and he cried out when not one, but two fingers slipped inside him the faint burning enough to stave off the climax that threatened just moments before.
Hermione wrinkled her nose as she stepped out of the Floo, the smell of stale whisky immediately evident. She stepped around what looked like part of a broken bottle of Butterbeer, careful not to touch it – or the puddle of liquid next to it – with her shoe.
Harry, he thought, swallowing convulsively to bite back his terror. Harry knew about Cal, and knew that Blaise and Neville had gotten him to safety. The Healer cast a few diagnostic spells over him while he watched the tall, sandy-haired man observe silently, his arms crossed as though waiting for Draco to act out again.
He eyed George speculatively, enjoying the opportunity to tease the infamous jokester. "Or maybe not," he said, shuddering slightly at the thought of another possibility – some sort of potion or spell that would give Angelina a temporary penis. He grimaced, the image completely killing the erection he'd been sporting.
A slow smile spread across Hermione's face as understanding dawned. Ron, who had been looking away in his perusal of the restaurant patrons, turned back toward them, a huge grin on his face as well. All descendents of the Families were well-schooled in those archaic rules that applied only to them. No one had ever entered into a courtship as public as the one Harry and Malfoy were about to, though, so no one had used the old law in more than a century.
Ron sidled up to the sink holding a dish cloth, drying the pieces Hermione handed him without a word. Years spent in his mother's kitchen had trained him well. Harry beamed at his two oldest friends, wondering if life really got any better than this.
"Harry Potter in the Chamber of Secrets with the Sword of Gryffindor," she said after a long pause, nodding confidently.
"She's just brilliant, Gin. Well done!" Theo had caught him on his way to the room and taken him to the nursery to see their daughter, Fredricka. Harry could hardly believe how tiny she was.
Ward," he continued, noticing when Draco's posture relaxed. The wards would form an invisible barrier between them, ensuring they couldn't touch even if they got carried away in the moment.
Which wouldn't happen, because Oliver was in no way interested in Potter, Draco assured himself. His fists clenched harder as he quickened his pacing, glancing up at the large antique clock over the mantle. They were late.
"Cousin?" Ginny asked, earning herself a slap on the wrist when she snaked out a hand to grab a hot mushroom.
Draco busied himself pouring the drinks, the easy camaraderie he'd felt all day morphing into something different – something tight and hot in his belly, a sudden nervousness that had him struggling for composure. It was ridiculous, of course. This was Harry. There was no reason to be nervous. Then again, this was
"I was shocked, to say the least," Draco said, remembering his outrage. "After Cal was born, though – well, I wouldn't trade having him in my life for anything."
The dreams had been increasing in frequency for weeks now, but the intensity hadn't started kicking up this high until last week, when Draco agreed to accept Harry's courtship. He grabbed his wand, but hesitated before he could cast the spells he'd come to rely on almost nightly. Really, wet dreams at his age? It was mortifying.
He, suddenly, laughed softly. "Harry, wait." He said as he walks towards me with an amused smile plastered on his face.
First things first, I have to apologize to Draco and then to Hermione. I was too careless and overestimated my abilities which resulted in us, almost dying out there.
That was the last I heard before Mr. Weasley went outside for privacy. After 5 minutes, the twins came down from upstairs, still pale and sleepy.
"What more do you want to ask?" Malfoy grumbled as I again interrupted his time with his butterflies.
Malfoy raised both of his eyebrows in disbelief clearly shown on his face. There was an awful one minute of silence before Malfoy sighed.
After finishing her speech, a deafening silence reign over us throughout Malfoy's kitchen, as I began to contempt the idea of becoming not a Human.

"Hmm..." Draco hummed then he raised both of his hands as he cupped my face and his thumbs caress my cheeks in a lovingly way then he slowly leans closer making my already cold and tired body, ignite in flame, his lips lightly touched mine then he raised his head away from me. "Not at all."
"Hold your horses there, kid. I don't want you hurting yourself" He laughed as he took a hold of my shoulders and embraced me, gently.
"No." I answered. "Sorry, Hermione but we need to out-run them as fast as we can and this is the only way I can think of."
"Yes," I answered again. Sadness dwelling inside of me. Silence then ruled over us as we tried to nurse the growing pain inside of us. Only the birds that tweets as they passed us by and the rustling of the leaves on the trees as it sways from the gentle breeze were heard.
Hermione raised one of her eyebrows and send Ron a nasty look then she turns to me. "So Harry... about this morning?..." She halted waiting for me if I would like to open up regarding this morning's incident.
I couldn't mask the pained expression that had surfaced from my face as I was also attacked with remorse and sadness as I remember the way - Ginny, Ron, and everybody's reaction to Harry's transformation. I couldn't defend them to Malfoy's accusation for I know too well that they did push Harry away.
"Diffindo!" I cried out and the spider that was near me was hit. I blinked rapidly, staggering to my feet as I strained myself to stand and shaking away the pain that is pulsing on my shoulder from the attack of the smaller acromantula and from the hunger pains that are steadily erupting in my stomach.
Honestly, I think I am still shaking like an infant, never have I felt this terrified. I was sweating like a pig and there was an awful feeling within the pit of my stomach.
"I mean I'm having an affair here with Draco, a man," I answered in a more stupid way that I almost wanted to hit myself into the wall for my stupidity.
"Hermione, I'm sor-" I mumbled but was cut-off abruptly as Hermione had run with her arms spread open and she embraced me strongly. Her arms tightened around my neck and she sniffed and sobbed.
English is not my first language and this is my first fanfiction, so please be patient with me. I haven't found someone that could help with the editing.
"I see..." Hermione finally said after a long silence reign between us. Then she suddenly snapped out of it. "I have a theory for that but before anything else, Harry. Let's get out of here."
' You'll find out very soon, Harry - darling! Soon you will.' She giggled, dark as it sounded. 'For now, open your eyes, Harry. And have a feast, fill yourself to your heart's dark desire.'
4. Stamina (I didn't get tired with a three hours hike by Harry) (Increase stamina with no signs of being tired after running with a speed during three hours by Hermione)
I heard him laughed as his eyes gleamed wickedly and his arms reached up and wounded them around me, pulled his body, and settled down on my lap. Perfectly, comfortable as he settled down and smiled at me. "Do you?"
' Never judge a by appearance, what house they belong to, or their manner of speaking. I guess a Gryffindor can also become friends with a Slytherin.' I thought as I stared at Draco's face.
Headmaster then turned to Hermione and Ron. "When the two of you have found Harry did you notice anything?" He asked.
"Okay," Hermoine apparently let it go as she had gone back to her conversation with Ron and Ginny with her Mother.
"Oh my, Mione. I do not spit that is so uncivilized but I do love the idea of you dying to know what I have in mind." His eyes curved more as he smiled deeply, his teeth showed as he snickering evilly at us. "It's not every day that the smartest witch and the golden boy hungrily await for me to speak."
"Then it is my responsibility to also explain to the Vanes. To let them understand the situation." Professor McGonagall spoke in a regal manner. "And Mr. Malfoy, please tell us first before doing any action so that there will be no trouble in your part. Some families and people do not understand the old ways now. Please be more understanding."
I screamed in my head as hot tears fell from my eyes as hatred, anger, and remorse flooded and almost sweep me away. This is not fair, my life and everything!
"I thought I stop caring, Hermione." I sobbed as I enclose my face with both my hands, unable to stop the painful assault of the unexpected emotions that just burst into my chest, like a shotgun - fast and deadly. "In all of those years, how can they leave me because of a single moment? Was our relationship was up to this point? Replaceable? Meant to be abandoned? Was our friendship has an expiration date to suddenly disappear just like that?"
"Gulon can control-l its shape...hah..hahaha...and size to...enter any spa-space." Hermione huffs her sentence as her breath was still ragged and gasping for air.
Who is the real Draco Malfoy? Cold to every stranger, a kind brother to his dead brother, obedient child to his parents, and brutal and cuel to his enemies...
"Potter, it's given willingly and not taken forcefully." He said as he took my hand and placed the warm tea. "Just think of it as blood donation or to humor yourself, think of it as how a donor mother gives her breastmilk to another child." Then he took off as I laughed at his sarcastic comparison of my situation to a mundane matter.
I know that my actions were childish but they should have known better than to hide it from me. No person that wouldn't be fire up if one of their loved ones is in danger.
Plus, it might not work that way, that is because I could feel that Hermione is happy with the relationship I have with Draco and might even encourage me to turn it in a different direction. A direction, that I am trying to avoid.
Sighing, I slowly got up and followed after her. When Hermione is determined, no one can stop her. Upon arriving at Myrtle's bathroom, we entered. It seems to be Myrtle wasn't there to bothered us, I went to a stall and open my shirt, to see if there was still damage but as I reached the buttons in the middle of my shirt, I froze and started to gasp as I panic. My gasping was heard as Hermione pounded on the stall's door.
"Go on" I urged him. He seems to have gotten my message, hesitantly, he slides towards the door. "Are you already alright?
Uncertain with what I am actually experiencing or what could Hermione's reaction be, I mumbled out. "I can...actually hear them. Those people... T-the footsteps. The rustling of leaves... Their breaths. Hermione, I can hear them, loud and clear."
"What!?" I stood up from the bed with a mixture of shock and panic. My face became blazing hot red as I shook my head. "What are you talking about, Hermione?!"
"CORNER!" I growled as I landed with a loud thud, two meters away from them. Surprising them, with my sudden appearance as they jolted with panic upon seeing me. They haven't expected to be discovered by someone as they look like deers caught in the middle of the road by a rushing car.
"Are you sure about this, Draco?" Hermione asked as we trudged the wild bushes and the ancient trees of the forest. "Should we just hunt in the meadow, like the other day?"
"That's right!" Ron brightens up as he heard the word then turns to Hermione. "We can't possibly pass those subjects"
After being lost in thoughts as I gazed over the professors, I glanced up the ceiling. It was enchanted to look like the sky outside that is now stormy. The clouds swarmed and block any light from the sky, with its darkness.
I rose from my slumber trying to leap up and twist to turn away from her but my body wouldn't budge from where I lay. As I open my eyes, I saw thin silver chains had a wrap around my body, which was hindering me from moving.
"Spit it out, Draco. Don't kill us with anticipation." Hermione rolled her eyes as soon as she saw his childish expression.
"We need-d to secure a pla-place where-e we can... conceal ourselves-ss and put up-p a ba-barrier." Hermione wheezes out her words as we came to another turn - a tunnel more narrow and engulf by darkest without a hint of light.
Then a roar was heard - like a lion with a bark of a vicious wolf. I saw it as it had reached us at last. From where the tunnel that we came from was ahead of a dog with the cat's ears and eyes, along with three horns on the top its head was peeking - as hideous it was and frightening - it was nothing against its expression it showed when it finally saw us. Its face turns into a gleeful look - eyes that held hunger and absolute happiness as its mouth warp into a human-like smile and inside its mouth were three rows at the upper and another two rows of razor-sharp teeth at the bottom part. I held my breath as chills run up and down my body. I couldn't move from my spot along with Ron and Hermione.
' That's fine, Ms. Granger." Headmaster Dumbledore assured her. "You were there and had been traumatized so I can't blame you if you not to recall all the details."
From the distance, I could hear Ginny crying for me. Hermione's screams of horror. Ron's shriek for my safety. My teammates' panic chatters. Professor McGonagall's strict instructions as her voice waver from I suspect fear. And I could hear the coward Michael Corner stuttering as he says 'I didn't mean to-'. I was coughing out blood. My head was buzzing like static on the radio. My consciousness was fading. I... I don't want to die yet...
Under me, I could hear Draco snorted as he was amused by how I am making a fool of myself. "Very intelligent of you to say. Harry, my dear. Also very original as well." He snickered. "Actually, Moine isn't blind. You're the only one who oblivious to it."
"Sorry! I was kind' an off, yesterday." I said sheepishly at her. "I was too relief to actually think about that stuff that I end up sleeping during our conversation."
' Just as I said I am seeing the things that you see through your eyes' She said in a bored manner as if she was explaining something to an elementary child.
Standing straight with the aura of a regal prince, Malfoy merely turns to me."What benefit would I get out of this and why should I help you?"
"Harry, do you have a minute?" Remus stood against the door, as he was looking at me. I was packing my things in my trolley, a day before our departure to Hogwarts.
"Blood! Where did that blood come from? My eyes! What did you to my eyes, YOU DEMON?!" I shouted at myself through the mirror.  "SPEAK DEMON!"
I don't even know that I would react like that. It's like a dam, which was full of water, had broken down and all the emotions that I have been keeping just flowed in and drown all the rational thoughts in my brain.
"To the Headmaster," Hermione whispered as she let go of me to speak and explain to them what was going on but alas someone else took their attention. Michael Corner appears with a crunch up expression.
It smell so good that my mouth watered a bit. Distracted, I didn't recognize that one of Malfoy's butterflies found me as it landed on my bandaged hand. As soon as it had landed on me, I panic and flinched away - making me reveal my location as I accidentally step on a branch and it cracked as it broke under my weight.
"That's good to know." He smiled as he took out his wand and whispered a warming spell onto the pot of chocolate. "Here." He handed me my cup. "That will help."
As soon as, Malfoy uttered those words to Harry, my best friend; who was so good, caring, and one of my important people in the world and who have suffered from alienation, fear, and rejection - I cried as I look at the scene in front. No matter how disgusting or disturbing it might look from the other people's perspective but for me, it is something warm and a hopeful scene unfold in front.
Professor McGonagall raised her hand to pinched between her eyebrows as if there was an incoming headache, then she sighed deeply and raised her head. "Very well, Mr. Malfoy as you wish."
Another voice came with a hint of spice and smell of dry pages of books. "HARRY, please don't leave us. Wake up!" It was Hermione.
A smile managed to slip out my lips as I grumbled at myself because even I want to prevent myself from investing more feelings for him because of my non-closure relationship with Ginny but I guess I already damned to be a sinner cause I know I already deeply interested with Draco.
I roll my eyes. A Malfoy is still a Malfoy. A Slytherin is still Slytherin. And he is both of those.
"I know, Harry. I know you didn't mean to hurt me." Hermione chanted as she still stayed in our embrace. "I know."
I turn to my side as the sound of whimpering captured me. Ginny stood there, shaking. I slowly walk towards her - knowing that she might understand me but I stop from tracks as she started to step back and fell to the ground, screaming in fright. "NO! GET AWAY FROM ME!"
The voice replied at last. After a minute, the cave shook as a pounding of something came from the direction of where we came from. The dust and the drips from stalagmites started to fall over us.
"Eight meters away from us?" I asked in shock. Then why could I hear them as if they were very near?
She waited for me to nod my head before continuing. "I'll start from when Draco found us in the forest."
Laughter invaded the whole common room as relief and gratitude spread in my chest. I'm really blessed to have them.
It's kinda hard to visualize that once a good relationship could change drastically. Losing someone is cruel. All that sadness, guilt, bitterness, hatred, and pain.
"And you believe everything she said." Malfoy snapped with a wild smile on his face. "HHAHAHAHAH...."
'As that would work, Dear Harry!' My demon teased as she added Mrs. Weasley's endearment as an insult. I ignored her.
It was a male. His white - silver like hair covered his face. He laid a hand on my demon's head just as he did with Sirius' hand, that morning and said in a voice that I am very familiar with. "Go."
But the last words that he left, still linger in my head. "Just because her nature is to eat flesh and drink blood, should I abandon her? Even if she never inflicted any pain to others, should I fear her? It's just a part of her and not her whole being."
I stared at my cup as I swirl the liquid while I trying to gather my thoughts on this matter but I couldn't think of anything at this particular moment. "I don't have a plan, Draco," I admitted. "I don't have an idea of what to do."
for the last few years took on a new meaning. He'd assumed it had been speculation and gossip, but maybe not.
Harry snuggled down further into the bedclothes, pulling the duvet up higher on his chest. He'd climbed into bed with his laptop to respond to Sly, but he wasn't sure what to say. The dinner he had sent over had been an incredibly sweet gesture, as had the hand-written note that had accompanied it. Harry reached across his pillow to grab the now-wrinkled note, written in firm, neat strokes on heavy cream parchment.
He looked up at Ron, a brilliant smile splitting his face. "Thanks, mate. Looks like I owe you one."
No matter what the Slytherin was hiding, though, Harry was confident he could handle it. Prison time in another country? No problem. Mental breakdown? He seemed fine now, so that was alright too. Rehab for Potions abuse? A common enough occurrence, and one Harry could easily deal with.
"I'll keep you safe," Harry announced, slamming down the rest of his beer and putting the empty glass on the table. "Protect your virtue and whatnot. No worries,
Pansy nearly swallowed her tongue – Potter had confessed who he was? And Draco was still accepting gifts from him?
They both turned to Kingsley, who had Summoned the marriage contract from Harry's desk in the study, looking over it and nodding his approval. The two wizards had successfully completed all of the contract's stipulations. He saw no reason their bond would be rejected, nor any reason that the couple couldn't keep claiming rights under
He nursed his club soda, resolved not to drink at all tonight. He'd only just rid himself of the headache from last night's over-indulgence, which he was in no hurry to repeat.
"By all means, Potter, tell the lady exactly what you mean," Draco said, his polite smile not quite reaching his stormy grey eyes. "Or is that why you prefer online dating? Find it easier to write than to speak?"
"Thank you for coming today," Harry began, glaring at several reporters who started shouting questions about Cal. "I have a statement to give you, and after that will be available to answer a few questions. I will only answer
Harry looked around, distressed to realize that everyone else was taking their seats. He gestured toward the sparsely populated table at the side of the room, following the blond's lead as they claimed their chairs as well.
"Leave it be, Madge-pie," Blaise said as he rounded the corner. Draco could have sighed in relief. "The boss-man must preserve some of his secrets, yeah?"
Harry shifted Teddy's warm weight in his arms, pressing his face into the curve of his sleeping godson's neck. He wasn't sure what had caused Malfoy's sudden departure, but he was sure about one thing: there had been an air of finality about it that made something inside of him clench and throb. Harry blinked as he felt the hot prick of tears behind his eyes, and he swallowed thickly, unwilling to let himself think about the fact that the burning he felt in his chest was unlike the emotions Malfoy usually stirred in him. He wouldn't think about how his heart had lurched when he saw the Slytherin in the shadows, or how that joy had turned to something much more complicated when he'd seen the naked hunger in those smoky grey eyes. Most of all, Harry wouldn't think about the burning, tearing pain in his chest when Malfoy turned away, which had felt remarkably like his heart shattering. Because it wouldn't do any good to think about any of those things, Harry's rational mind insisted, since he wasn't attracted to Malfoy in the first place.
"Tell them I took this to the Ministry to file," he said, pointing the scroll over his shoulder at the entwined couple. "I'm classifying it with top-level clearance, so it will disappear after its legitimacy has been registered."
He watched her warily, knowing she'd wait until they were alone before laying into him. So he was surprised when she moved past him to step toward the Floo. He always went first to open the wards at Grimmauld Place.
"You look beautiful," Ginny said, pressing a careful kiss to Hermione's cheek, taking care not to smudge their make-up.
Harry helped Cal to his feet, dusting the snow off the boy's back and legs as he steadied him on the skates. "You ready?" Harry asked both of the Malfoy men.
Draco didn't notice three sets of eyes watching him, the most conspicuous being the matron of honor, whose gaze flicked between him and Harry several times before settling on her brother, focusing on the words being spoken. Neville shot Pansy a small smile, both of them easily following Draco's gaze, which still rested on Harry. Maybe everything would work out, after all.
She heard the water shut off as she dug around for a pair of socks in his bureau, her curiosity raging. What could have upset Harry so much? She had a sick feeling it had to do with Sly, and Harry's confession. Had he told the man everything, or just that he was James Evans? Guilt nagged at her. After all, she'd been the one to insist he come clean.
Teddy quirked an eyebrow, and Ron laughed at seeing such an adult expression on his face. He was still a year away from starting at Hogwarts, but he was clearly magically and emotionally mature enough to go. Harry and McGonagall had already intervened with Andromeda, begging the woman to let her grandson start in the fall, but she'd steadfastly held her ground. She wanted as much time with Teddy as possible, which meant no going away to school early.
Draco, and there were further restrictions about being alone with each other – a big taboo – and touching each other – an even bigger taboo – for another few weeks after that.
Harry was staring at Cal, and the two of them were absolutely beaming. No one in the room could doubt the affection they felt for each other.
Harry knew it was a lost cause, but that didn't stop him from settling in for the night with his laptop, intent on tracking Draco down. His Owls to Malfoy Manor had been returned, unopened, as had the missives he'd sent directly to Malfoy Industries.
, he thought, not even bothering to read past the headline. This was definitely going to complicate things.
Oliver laughed dryly, tossing back his Firewhisky in one gulp. "I can just imagine the headlines tomorrow. 'Malfoy revealed as party of Wood's secret harem – Potter crushed'," he said, shaking his head. "Pans stayed home. She just wasn't up to going out. Those idiots have taken to ringing the bloody bell at all hours of the night, hoping to get one of us to open the door."
Draco gulped the potion Neville handed him, sighing in relief as the cool liquid soothed his raw throat and settled his roiling stomach. Another calmed his jangled nerves, and yet another relieved his throbbing headache.
Neville shook his head, casting a few diagnostic spells over a plant on Harry's table. It would be so much easier if he could just take Harry to see Draco, but he couldn't. Complicated wards and protections – similar to the Fidelius Charm – blanketed the chateau, and Neville was bound by an Unbreakable Vow not to speak of it or anyone who lived there. Everyone who knew about Cal had taken a similar vow, not that any of them would have divulged any information about the boy's existence. Not even to Harry.
"James Evans, yes," Neville said, realizing Pansy's problem. "It got even worse. When he'd finally reconciled the fact that he'd been writing to his favorite author, he said 'at least it isn't Harry Potter', or some rot like that."
"Er, Hermione?" Harry winced, wondering what she'd seen in the paper. Had there been any reporters there last night? He grimaced.
Draco raised his wand, casting Locking and Silencing Charms on the room. He moved to a nearby chair, waiting, his eyes trained on the fireplace. It was 8:30 p.m. and Harry was officially late. Only ten minutes, and Draco himself had just that moment returned from putting Cal to bed, but still.
"Were you in on the scheme, Malfoy?" The Auror sneered, his expression full of disdain. "An innocent guy like Atalier couldn't have come up with this on his own. What was your cut?"
"No, it's fine," Harry said, wheezing slightly when his sudden laughter made his chest ache. "I just had a thought about what the press will make of this." He wrinkled his nose, rolling his eyes in disgust. "Harry Potter: The Boy Who Lives and Lives and Lives."
Hermione sat back with a thoughtful look. The writer sounded a bit pretentious, but his interests – and requirements for privacy and solitude – matched Harry's nicely. The bit about children, though, gave her pause.
Draco huffed angrily, following Blaise through the chateau. He was surprised when they turned at the entryway, heading down the stone steps toward the grounds. Draco craned his neck, looking for his son's dark head. It was a nice day – perhaps he was out flying with Neville or playing in the gardens.
Harry thought, smiling when his son walked into the room with Narcissa. He came straight to them, pressing a soft kiss to his sister's downy head before doing the same to both of his fathers.
was still there, but it seemed to be weaving the two auras together, combining them until none of the colors were distinct.
The bird nipped at him impatiently as his sleep-numbed fingers struggled to untie the scroll on its leg. The owl clearly wasn't any more pleased with its early-morning task than Harry was; he'd only gotten to sleep an hour earlier. He grumbled at the bird darkly before letting it go, slamming the window shut without watching it soar away into the inky blackness outside his window.
"No. I  haven't any. Thanks to the Dreamless potion." I replied. Instead of nightmares, I was having another problem.
"We are tampering your food to finally see if all the theories we had come up with, so far, were true and as we saw your reaction to the soup that you are eating then that concludes that our experiment is a success." This time, Hermione answered my question.
Grinning at him, I slowly roll my question in my tongue. "Malfoy, I having dreams with a female creature..."
"I already voice out my opinion on this matter, Harry. When you disappeared from Hogwarts and I was left behind, I saw their reactions towards you and I was completely baffled on how they seem to treat and abandon you even of all those years being around you and being your friend." She was in a rage as she stomped her foot and clench her fist in anger. "Ginny and Ron were unbelievable! How can they do this to you?! It's a good thing the twins were on your side as they were the ones, who help me escape Hogwarts."
'Whoa!' I blinked in dazed then shake my head to snap out of it as I began to sink in adoration and admiration for Malfoy 'This can't be happening.'
Suddenly, warm hands embraced my clenched fist, I look up. Hermione was staring at me - on to my eyes. "I know this might be difficult for you and I don't know to what extent, Harry but..." She inhaled and exhaled slowly and deeply. "If it helps, I'm still here for you, Harry. I'm your best friend."
Pansy went beside him and offered his bag. Malfoy took out a small ancestry knife and held it, in front of us.
"HARRY!!!" She screamed in terror as she tried to block the hole that the spider was able to punch thru my shoulder with both of her hands. "OH GOD!!!"
As the stall opened and Hermione gazed upon my stomach, horror wrapped her face as she suppresses a scream.
After my sanity has slowly come back to me, I saw the sun shining brightly at me as it warms me up with acceptance.
"A strigoi, Potter and that's just a guess but the convincing out of all our theories," Draco uttered once again as he intensely stared at me, waiting for my reaction as patiently as his expression showed. Unfortunately for him, I am not familiar with that word nor the about said a creature that he is speaking about.
"Did Ron passed his pig-virus on you?" Ginny said with a disturbed look on her face. "Because that would be bad."
A too familiar voice shouted as ropes shoot up to entangle Harry and he got tied up to the enormous tree that was nearby. Snaring and crawling, the enraged Harry as the spellcaster has to continue casting a more inforcing spell to strengthen the ropes, ensuring that it won't break even with Harry's sudden development of super strength.
"Bastard! That's not want I did last night." I retorted as the heat swept into my cheeks as he suggested those things.
A frown appeared on my face as I remember and learned never to judge by the appearance of any creature, be it a human or an elf.
Appalled by Oliver's attitude of unconcern for Malfoy's safety, I struggled to understand her logic. For him, Malfoy is someone unworthy of his attention because he was not His friend, not Gryffindor, and not beneficially to him in winning in our upcoming match thus he doesn't interest him to save him. Simply as that.

The terrifying experience had a large impact on the three of us. For the past month, Hermione wasn't able to sleep alone as she needed someone to be beside in her bed, while Ron was guilty of being useless during that time and as for me, I was swarmed by nightmares that troubled me in my sleep, affecting my daily routines to an extreme extent. Everybody was all worried about us. It was a good thing, after a while things gotten better for almost everyone except for me, who is still plunged by nightmares to extent that it manifests into a character, my demon - the black-haired girl invading my mind even in my waking times.

"BASTARD!" Michael growled at Malfoy, tensing with every muscle in his body. I can see that he really wanted to attack Malfoy if it weren't for the damage he received from my punch.
Trying to calm down my instinct, I kept myself from fighting the chains but instead settled down to sit up as I tried to gaze upon Hermione, now my only friend. "It's alright, Hermione. I understand."
As I have scanned the whole list, I felt that we have many clues on what creature I have become but we never got the answers and List on what are the abilities that I might have attained but for the other questions that we have noted on the very end of the paper, we still have no answers.
"Really?" Malfoy slowly rolls the word in his tongue as he glanced with a peculiar glint in his eyes from the Headmaster to Professor McGonagall then to us. It was suffocating to be under his gaze, the pressure was too much - that I started to believe that Malfoy could do something bizarre.
"What? I'm not going to go out there to be chased by that monster." Ron shouted at me while his eyes glared. "Are you crazy?!"
Mrs. Weasley walked up to them.  "Can you stop being childish, Sir? Step away as far as you can. This becoming unpleasant since you have arrived."
That morning, the sun came through the clouds lighting the window of the Great Hall as we descended and arrived at our table, examining our schedule at breakfast. A few seats from us were the twins and their friend, Lee Jordan whispering secretly about something - maybe about their new planned prank that we are going to find out sooner or later.
I tried to breathe slowly as I push the boiling feeling in my stomach and clench both of my fists to prevent me from grabbing on to Draco because I might just lose it and just ravage him right here and then.
"Harry!" Remus called out as soon as he saw me. I already forgotten my distress, I flew to hug Remus.
"Malfoy, What are doing here?" I grumbled as I hid my injured hand and peeked at the broken mirror to see if she was still there. Luckily, she was gone.
Professor McGonagall slowly stood up and went in front of Malfoy. She slowly did a half-bow as she spoke most humbly. "My apologies, Mr. Malfoy. I have judged too early before actually hearing your side and as a Professor, it was too conceited of me."
"Not just us!" Cal piped up, hopping further down the corridor. A door creaked open and Percy's oldest daughter, Molly, hopped out. The seven year old bounced down the corridor to Harry, her tight red ringlets jumping with each movement.
Kingsley shook his head, refusing to release Draco's hand. "Please, call me Kingsley," he said, winking at Harry. "I've heard Harry speak of nothing else for weeks – I feel like we are already well acquainted."
Harry shook his head, ducking out of the restaurant and into a nearby alley. Ron followed, casting a quick Notice-Me-Not charm so they could talk without fear of interruption.
Draco bit his lip, unsure why he was so upset that Harry had Disapparated before he could explain. What was Potter to him, after all?
he thought, teeth gritted, as he wrapped the cock ring tightly around the base, his eyes sliding shut at the sensation.
She frowned, collecting the crystal stemware Sly had sent along with the wine. She and Harry cleared the rest of the table in silence, carrying it all to the kitchen. Hermione looked around, watching as Harry discretely fingered the delicate neck of a wine glass. Sighing, she aimed her wand at the sink and filled it with hot, soapy water.
Draco nodded absently, locating the message from the stern wizard in question. Abraxas Wedgewick. The man was an absolute snob, and Draco had a feeling his family name was greasing the wheels for their proposal – a nice change, since usually it worked the other way around. He made a note to have Madge send the wizard a complimentary pass to his club, an exclusive society where the pureblood (and half-blood, as of a few decades ago) elite met to play cards and smoke. He never went there himself, and he only kept up his family's membership for moments like these. He had no use for old fools who put too much stock in blood purity and old money.
Harry cast a quick Cushioning charm on the bathtub, hoping it helped make Ron more comfortable. He didn't doubt there was a good reason his friend had decided to sleep there, and he was reluctant to move him until the redhead had something to settle his stomach.
“Hermione!” Theo glanced around, double checking to make sure they were the library’s only occupants. But Hermione had, as always, done her research and chosen her moment well. She knew every other student in their year would be in the Slytherin common room right now, and any professors out on the prowl for rule-breakers would be congregating in the dungeons, too, hoping to catch a drunken student or two.
Harry shrugged, taking a small sip of whisky. He savored the rich flavor, letting it roll over his tongue before swallowing. He didn't intend to indulge in more than one glass since he was having a hard enough time resisting Draco without the lowered inhibitions another shot of whisky would bring.
the effects to know you were up all night," she hissed, leaning in closer so they wouldn't be overheard. "Just
Harry nodded, settling Cari on his hip. He looked around the platform, wondering if Draco would make good on his promise not to come or not. He couldn't imagine not being there to see Cal off, but he knew they had said a private goodbye earlier that morning.
"No, I did," Harry said absently, raising his hand to catch the shop keeper's attention. "Can you tell me a bit about this?"
"Should be –" Harry threw his head back, losing his train of thought when Draco ground against him, the heat of his erection evident even through their trousers. " – romantic –" Harry gasped when he felt Draco's hands slide down his bare back, slipping beneath the waistband of his trousers and cupping his bare arse. " – the first time."
, Gin," Neville greeted her, smiling and nodding as she asked if she could step through for a moment.
Harry looked up, rubbing a hand over his face. He knew the glamour would cover it, but he was exhausted. He hadn't fallen into bed until after 6 a.m., which left him less than two hours to sleep before he needed to wake for his 9 a.m. meeting. He looked at the long conference table, scattered with soggy boxes of half-eaten, empty coffee cups and discarded parchment. They'd been at it all day.
Everyone was having a mixed reaction with what Malfoy revealed, some are with disgust, some are with awe while others have no idea how they could approach this.
"I'm sorry." I can only offer an apology. I heard a sigh from across the room, I fidget as blood drips from my hand.
I stood immediately, surprising Hermione, who was beside me as I ran across the room to Malfoy and grabbed his left arm. Raising it, I was overcome with relief and confusion as I saw a perfect hand since I was sure that Malfoy did cut it off and fed it to me when I was still...Out of control.
It had been hours before the tears in our eyes has finally stopped from flowing. We settle ourselves on the edge of the queen-size bed. I was informed that I have been unconscious for straight three days which had made Hermione worried.
The Great hall buzzed as the whole student body chatter at the same time about what just had happened as soon as Malfoy exit. Some were so loud - wondering and confused as I am. I know I should be bothered but I was still too busy, trying to clear my head with all the commotion also I was still greatly affected by HIS smile. That was the one that was really bugging me out.
As I grew accustomed to the fleeting sensation of peace within me when the memories slowly immersed from my cerebrum - like an old telly flips its scene before me.
According to Hermione and based on the books that they have researched on, along with Malfoy's apparent testimony with the pureblood's heritage, a Strigoi is a creature that has risen from the dark side, akin to the ancient vampires and werewolves as they have bottomless lust for blood and flesh of any being and losing their sanity for the unbearable hunger that curses them.
Come in and play! You'll run and I'll chase you... Just don't let me catch you or else you might end up in my tummy hehehehe...
Sighing, I slowly got up and followed after her. When Hermione is determined, no one can stop her. Upon arriving at Myrtle's bathroom, We entered. It seems to be Myrtle wasn't there to bothered us, I went to a stall and open my shirt, to see if there was still damage but as I reached the buttons in the middle of my shirt, I froze and started to gasp as I panic. My gasping was heard as Hermione pounded on the stall's door.
An arm slowly draped on my shoulder and his smell assaulted my senses, my nerves all relaxed in an instant as I turn to him, Draco.
"Like it? Bullshit! Who are you? And what do you want? Why me? Why are you doing this to me? ANSWER ME!" I gritted with so much revulsion engraved in my voice. My chest was burning with hatred. My eyes sting with tears that freely flows. I want to hurt her. Punch her with all my might for making my life miserable.
"Harry, mate. Are you alright?" Ron asked as he entered the room. I look up to him from my staring, out the window. I could see his pale face, freckles standing out as he looks at me with concern.
"Sorry about that,  Harry. I want to make sure to keep us both safe. Don't worry, I will remove those chains when I am sure that you are in full control of your urges." Hermione said she came sitting beside me.
"What do you think I am saying, Idiot?" Michael said with much ignorance. "Everybody knows that you're too jealous of Potter's fame. We don't know if you're too into that for you to do such an underhand method!"
"It looks like a huge cloud. So, it's... it's either Harry will have bad luck on his Quidditch games this year for maybe... hmmm... thunderstorms or its just bad weather?" Ron shrugged at me. We really don't suit for Divination.
"You look better." Ginny commented as she stared at my face. She looks so beautiful. Her chocolate brown eyes to her cheeks adored by freckles - a trait that eventually is handed down to all Weasleys. Her flaming red hair that she keeps long.
Fear started to struggle with me, cutting off my breathing. A coldness swept in. I wipe my sweat that started to form on my forehead with a trembling hand. I could hear my heart quickens like it was vibrating through my body. 'Calm down, Harry. Calm down!' I thought to myself.
The girl then went on a series chattering that I was not concerned about as I was still bound in these ropes. I growl in frustration and hunger as the pain keeps pulsating inside my head and my body.
"What?!" Ron bellowed as he stood up and stared at us in disbelief. It had been a while before both Hermione and I could stop our laughter. As I took a breath, Hermione was also wiping a  tear from her eye from too much giggling. Ron was still standing with a red and pouting face.
“Tsk, tsk…Oh, Harry, you’re such a liar.” She accused as she giggled and glide around me. “I was watching you as you got drunk by the marvelous taste of what I have an offer you, surely you can’t deny it?
I suddenly felt the urge to kick his ass. That evil thought came to me again.  My desire to make him bleed. To kill him. Shit! I hate HIM. I want to hit him. I took my fist and balled it. I took a swing making it hit his stomach. As I hit him, he shouted with pain. Coughing as he couldn't recover from my punch. He wheezes on the side as I took the opportunity to stand up and back away from him. As I did so, I tasted blood in my mouth as his punch did cut the side of lips. I spilled the blood on the ground near him.
"I suppose you are right. Then, Harry what do you want to do with this opportunity?" Hermione asked sincerely at me.
"Hermione, I need you to run as fast as you can when the barrier disappear" I breathed, aware of a suffocating urgency. And in that instant, Hermione was alert and ready to fight me with my decision but I spoke as fast I can to hinder her from having a say on this matter. "Hermione, listen to me. I can't escape with you. I-I am not in a position-n to be near you. It's... already overpowering-g me. I don't know if... if I can control myself."
I swallowed painfully as my throat dried up from this unexpected intense questioning. The fact that I absolutely have no idea is also painfully.
"My nightmares took a sudden turn these last few weeks. Recently, a demon had invaded my dreams." I whispered.
"Really, Draco! Do you need to say it like that?" Hermione grumbled at Draco, a scolding tone. "Thankfully, it was a success."
A fire rose as the flames formed a shape of a giant serpent, its mouth was wide open as it swooped down the running hobgoblins enclosing them within as its fanged pierced them, one by one until there was no more of them. Their screams please me as I laughed like a lunatic. I watched the flames roaring and burning the surrounding trees as well.
Cheers erupted from my teammates. I can Ron calling out to me "Good job Mate!" while Hermione shouted at him. "Stop egging him, Ron."
I let that comment go. I knew it is really atypical. Dreaming about that strange girl that I have never met is definitely not a definition of normal. I must admit I have never seen anything like her. She was beautiful than any other girl I have known but at the same time, there was something eccentric and exuding of coldness in the way she speaks and moves.
He looks at me as if I was not sick of fever but instead, I have become mentally from all the things that had to happen to me.
The grayish creature pursued me as he called out for another to chased me down. I desperately thought of a spell as I turned and shouted, "Expelliarmus!"
"I would suggest you not to do so, Mr. Malfoy. The elders in the old Britain council punishes harshly and they will not bend the rules for a child." Headmaster Dumbledore spoke gravely.
Remus released me as he also greets Mr. Wealsey. "Sirius, Remus. You both came" Mrs. Molly Wealsey had just arrived. A woman with the gushing of motherly aura, clothed with a duster and Home-made sweater from colorful yarns, reddish hair just like Ginny.
That knowledge seems had clogged inside my brain before I could process it. That when Hermione asked her, I barely heard it. "Supposed to be?"
“Thank you, Tiffany.” He spoke with such gentleness. “Let’s eat.” Smiling at us as he led us and took out some plates while Hermione also arranges the utensils on the table. I went on by helping by setting the mugs.
I stared at the steam from the cup of tea then eventually took a hold of it, with both of my hands. It took me for a while but the first question that came out from me was - where was Harry?
A pang of guilt that I have confessed to Hermione for causing her to jeopardize her life for me in which she denied forcefully.
I blushed as I heard him then I just cleared my throat but didn't deny his accusation. He seems to like my silent yes to his question as he smiled brightly at me and slide towards me, making it that no space was between us.
"Let me see." Professor Trelawney said she took the cup from Ron's hand. She turned the cup and push her slipping eyeglasses towards her eyes for better vision but as she moved the cup closer to her face, her eyes larger. It even doubles in size in appearance because of his magnified eyeglasses.
I saw uncertainty in Michael's eyes as he gazes upon at Ginny's pained expression but soon disappeared as he saw me walking up to Ginny's side and wrapping both my arms around her waist to comfort her. He growled as soon as Ginny snuggled at my neck. His face morphed into something else, a mixture of anger and jealousy.
'Harry' She called out once again, with a different tone - gentle and kind. I know that it was only to trick me.
I sat, unnerving, as my thoughts run wild - my first class with the Slytherins, this morning took a different twisted turn in my life. I, desperately, am trying to find a way to rearrange my ideas inside my confused mind as I, with the rest of the Gryffindors have entered charms, our second class.
'Then accept me, Harry.' She said in her most seductive tone. Tempting me in giving in to her. 'If not, you're going to die. As every blood is dripping from your body and your insides spill out for the world to see.'
I look up at the mirror, to see the damage. What I saw had me in a fit of panic and made my heart stop. It was the face of a monster, my face - in the mirror mocked my sanity.
Then, unexpectedly, a knock comes from the door, which eventually snapped me from my worrying. As the door opens, Malfoy steps in as he looks up to me.
Smirking at my full-blown panic expression as he sniggered at me, which earn him of being elbowed by Hermione, who was glaring at him.
"Don't go gussy up about those snacks. They are not that good" Mrs. Weasley abashed by those words of compliment.
"The little plain crimson ones won't attack anyone. They will feed on blood but only on open wounds or the ones that are scattered." As Malfoy said this, many relax and breathe out relief. Then Malfoy faced us. "Seamus, to answer that question of yours: Do they have any use except on beautifying me?" He dramatically halted as many laughed and Seamus blushed in embarrassment. "Yes, they do. To prove that, I will demonstrate it to you."
"Yes, It is a symbol of Gluttony. It is vicious and is said to kill prey larger than itself and gorge until it can't possibly eat any more. It feasts on meat be it from a corpse or being ripped from a living." Hermione said in a monotone voice like recited from a book. "It is said that no leftover of the victims as it is a feast upon by the Gulon."
"Yes," I answered as I refocus my mind on Hermione, away from the negative thoughts that have entered my head.
My heart was like a wild animal that was running at 100 kilometers per minute as I began to feel dizzy while my body is burning up. I trembled with excitement and almost growl with my growing arousal.
Embarrassed, as I was caught off guard by the one and only Malfoy, I, immediately close my mouth shut and started to look at our surroundings as we are still in the forest.
With that, all the girls within the room burst into a fit of giggles and were swooning with the mere idea of romance. My jaw slacked open in disbelief then I rolled my eyes in annoyance. Because my death predictions were getting old so it moved on to my love life. Really!!!

“No, this is not true...” I screamed. I was frightened of my lust and hunger. “This is only a dream. A bad dream.”
Seeing him uptight with my inquiring, a dreadful feeling bloomed inside my chest. My ignorance of the situation hurt his feelings. "I didn't mean to upset you. It's just very unusual."
"What?" I dumbfounded uttered. Then I realized that my legs were shaking and Harry was already laid on a white soft-looking couch.
"You have researched well, Granger," Malfoy spoke suddenly as he strides toward us with his amused smirk that didn't touch his cold grey eyes.
"Hmm" was all Mr. Weasley could say as he disapparated. As he vanished, Hermione and Ginny entered the kitchen, well dress and awake.
"Hermione and I decided that your diet must be completely be changed but we have to find out what is your preference in terms of food," Draco explained. "Basing from Hermione's findings and the recent incident that involves you from changing into an uncontrollable creature. We have listed down what are your basic food and a list of what you might have become."
I squinted as the brilliant light from the sky had almost blinded my eyes and yet, I felt no pain from being dazzled by the sun's rays but instead the pain in my stomach was unbearable as it catches all my attention, leaving no other room for any other thought.
"But an insult towards My family, especially to my dead brother, Lucian is not something I will never let go." He continues with much hostility in his way of speaking. "Ms. Vane repeatedly flaunt to everyone, to me on how my brother's death had happened. On how Lucian was a stab to death by a group of muggles and left to die in the woods. On how before his death, he was-"
"He can't breathe if you suffocate him in your bosom, Mom." Fred teased as he too appears next to his brother.
