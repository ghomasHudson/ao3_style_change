“Harry. I didn’t know you were in this house” Cedric simpered, ignoring Ron entirely. He lewdly dragged his eyes down Harry’s bare chest, where the duvet pooled around his stomach, and Harry resolved to start wearing t-shirts to bed from now on.
A tear slid down Draco’s cheek at those last words, but he only nodded once, and left to go and apologise to everyone else that deserved one.
(Draco, 2:30)
“yeah” he said, leaning back into the sofa cushions. He put his legs over Draco’s lap, and put on Disney’s Hercules. Something light-hearted, and sweet. And he knew Draco did classics, and wanted something that would interest him too.
Let me in your world, you know what I spy
“of course not. We’re all good. And we definitely got the point across to Cedric. He was staring at us for the rest of the night. especially when we left”  she giggled.
Swept up in his debate with Hermione he didn’t notice the hours passing until he saw that it was dusk and everyone was packing up around him. Ron and Harry had returned at some point, Harry looked calmer than Draco expected him to be given the way Bryn had talked to him, but there was a tension in his body that belied his true emotional state.
“do you want to stay for dinner?” Draco said all in a rush, not looking at Harry lest Harry see the desperation there.
Hermione nodded sympathetically, reaching out to hold his hand.
English passed okay. They spent the lesson on poetry, and his homework was to research Shakespearean sonnet form, pick the Shakespearean sonnet that he considered to be his favourite, and write a bit about why. Nice and easy work for the first day back.
Harry was awoken by Teddy’s cries, early enough in the morning that it didn’t make sense to put him back to bed, so harry wandered down to the living room bleary-eyed, and lay down on the sofa, settling the baby onto his chest. He was on the brink of sleep when he heard tapping at the window, and he waved his hand to let the owl in.
“i don’t. I cant. Don't make me go to school” he said into Sirius’ chest.
Draco watched him, memories of being silently held by the saviour the night before floating around in his head. It was curious, the blond thought, that Harry hadn’t said anything. No soothing words of understanding, comforting sweet nothings whispered into the darkness, just strong arms, long hair and silence.
“Hey Malfoy, Ron is coming out of the hospital wing tomorrow, and I was hoping you would be okay with us having a little welcome back party in here? It would just be the two of us, Luna and ‘mione, Ron, Dean, Seamus and Neville”
“no, but I am Teddy’s” replies Harry, matching Draco in intensity, if not volume. “don’t you get it Draco? Teddy is all I have. Of course you don’t understand, you’ve always had a family, but I have never had one. Now I do.” Harry’s voice is low, and dangerous. In his green eyes Draco can see the conviction that killed Voldemort. Harry’s words suck all of Draco’s anger away and he’s stuck feeling like the bully he was trying so desperately not to turn back into.
“Two more and then jobs a good ‘un I reckon” said Remus, and Harry nodded before standing.
“Say lads” came a voice from behind them, sounding really quite serious.
You spin me right round baby right round
The only people he would willingly join were Ron and Hermione, and Molly Weasley. He found her maternal presence comforting, and she took him to her bosom much as she had done Harry, coming over with chicken pie and fussing over how skinny they both were and were they eating enough, and did she need to come over to help more and how they should let her look after Teddy more. She was overwhelming in the best way, and Draco could see how she had become a sort of lifeline for Harry while he was still stuck in an abusive household. Draco was surprised to find he was very happy at Grimmauld. He found himself often surprised in Harry’s company. The boy completely subverted expectations. He was a war veteran, a war hero, the saviour of an entire society, yet here he lived, in relative obscurity as a full-time father at just eighteen years old. It was endearing to see how he had healed, how he continued to heal with Teddy by his side. Draco loved it when he woke up late and would come down to the living room to see Harry lying on the sofa, the paleness of Teddy’s skin stark against the darkness of Harry’s as Teddy lay nestled into Harrys chest, as the two watched muggle cartoons on the television. Draco found himself comforted by the bizarre domesticity of his new life. It was so different to anything he had ever known in the best way conceivable.
Unsure of how to react to the knowledge that Ron was naked in front of Harry- despite the six years of boarding school, Draco had never had that experience with a roommate- Draco dithered in the corridor until the door opened.
Silence filled the space again, until he heard rustling and looked over to see Hermione curl up on Luna’s lap now, looking up at Harry with mournful brown eyes. “can you do the one you don’t like? The one about lost love, for me?” she whispered, and he saw Harry’s eyes close and pain flash across his face before he opened his mouth and began; “hey my love, I buried you a month or two ago. I keep thinking that you’re standing on my floor, that you’re waiting there for me’
“Thats- thats okay. I understand, I think. And honestly if it had been the other way round and Harry had come to my house and wormed his way into my life there indefinitely, I would have acted like the bratty private schoolboy I very much used to be.” Draco said, trying to be reassuring. Hermione sighed, but her facial expression settled into one of calmness, which Draco took as a win.
“Look, Draco, at the risk of sounding like an arsehole and viewing you as an object, as much as it's not important to you, it's important to me, and especially Remus and Sirius that Harry isn’t like this. He had a lot of issues when he was younger surrounding his parents and then it all settled and I think Sirius at least saw you coming as a bit of a test to see if Harry was really as… well adjusted as we hoped he was. And I know that sounds awful, and Harry clearly isn’t doing too well, either.” Hermione said, looking guilty as she spoke.
He finds what he’s looking for and withdraws a small, navy velvet box before climbing up onto one knee.
“careful Pansy, if he looks too good Draco here may combust”
The black girl sniffed and nodded. She then closed her eyes and waved her wand and Harry’s bed magically expanded to fit three. Harry gave her a t shirt and she went into the bathroom, the sounds of her sobs muffled by the sound of running water.
Draco tried not to think about what Harry and Luna had been ‘finishing’
I have made Hermione Trinidadian in this because I am Trinidadian and I wanted to bring some culture to Harry Potter due to the horrific lack of diversity in the books and films. I also saw wining (a cultural dance in Trinidad that is often misconstrued as sexual) as a great opportunity for a tiny bit of angst. the songs are a type of music called soca :)
She was dressed in muggle sports leggings and a zip-up hoodie, looking for all the world like a model for that muggle sports shop names after the Greek goddess of victory. As was his norm, as he arrived in the hall his eyes immediately searched for Potter. That was another anxiety/safety response. After the events involving the room of hidden things and the fiendfyre, and despite, surprisingly, the events that occurred in the bathroom in sixth year, Draco automatically felt safer in a room if Potter was there, and since then this feeling had only intensified.
Harry gingerly sat on the edge of the bed, cross legged rather than stretched out like Draco. Draco picked ‘how to train your dragon’ because it was a sweet kid’s film that he had seen before, and he didn’t want anything too heavy.
In the low lamp light I was free
Draco entered his room and was immediately accosted by the sound of loud music and, surprisingly, Harry’s voice, clearly blocked by the door and a heavy-duty silencing charm.
I had a thought dear however scary
“it’s my godson’s. I just moved here, and my proper one got lost in all the boxes. I’m Harry, what’s your name?”
“fuck ‘mione I barely know. Me and pansy had a lovely day shopping. Don’t give me that look, Ron, I had fun. Anyway, great day and then Teddy was fussing so we watched a film and then Pansy wanted to help me put him to bed and so we went up and we were chatting and then my childhood came up because I accidentally said I wasn’t allowed to watch films because I’m a fucking idiot and I forgot they don’t know and then she asked why and you know I have my policy about not lying because it’s part of me and I shouldn’t feel ashamed about it so I told her the barest bones and she had a breakdown about how she used to treat me. She hugged me and started sobbing, like proper crying, so I sat on the armchair and let her sit on my lap so she could cry on my shoulder and she kept apologising and crying and crying and apologising and you know I don’t like that.”
“If you would just kiss me Harry, and then try and tell me you don’t like me” Ginny responded, sounding both desperate and obstinate. Draco pitied her as much as he disliked her in that moment. He couldn't help but meanly think that she should preserve her dignity and just walk away, rather than begging for something she had already been denied.
Oh lei oh lai oh lord
The second showed Harry with a baby in his arms. The baby was clutching Harry’s little finger in one of its chubby hands and Harry was looking down at the baby with an expression of muted elation on his face. The caption read ‘Teddy bear’. Some girl named Ginny had commented ‘daddy Harry’ and Draco felt an embarrassing surge of jealousy.
“would you like to hold Teddy, Mrs Malfoy?” asked Harry, holding the small boy out towards her. She smiled, and scooped the boy up before cradling him close to her chest. She lost herself in cooing at him, and playing with him, and it warmed Harry’s heart to see Teddy gain yet another doting aunt figure. Harry turned away, jolted out of his reverie when Draco cleared his throat.
“oh. That’s, uh, that’s a lot” said Hermione, stepping back from Harry’s embrace.
“ however other than that you will be magic-less. We have tried to organise at least muggle-born in each group as we understand those from wizarding families may struggle somewhat. Enjoy your evening”
He withdrew his phone, and to his drunken delight, saw that harry had accepted his request and requested to follow him back. grinning like a fifteen-year-old girl, Draco goes to look at the pictures. Unfortunately, he was seeing everything double, and so resolved to do some thorough stalking in the morning, when he was just a tad more sober.
“These things take time, you know? And we need to have a friendship that is free of that childish resentment before we can start anything more than that, and we’re just not there, you know? We need more time to trust each other as friends and Harry knows that, but whenever he’s mad at us he keeps insisting we just need to hash out all the old stuff and then jump each other.”
Draco gave him a cocky smirk and opened the box.
"Why should you apologize? You did nothing." Draco moved his hand to close the door.
"You're very advanced with transfiguration. Hermione told me once. So why not try to make a little change to the wand's appearance?" Potter said before he drank the water.
Draco presumed two hours had passed since he'd been petrified. He'd heard no noise outside the door. The tower was completely deserted, which meant it was dinnertime.
A female voice surprised them both. Automatically they dropped their hands down and looked toward the voice.
"You... Sleep here tonight?" Draco asked suddenly, before he voiced his previous thought aloud.
Draco estimated that the area where Potter was headed was not far from the Thestral clearing. Draco had never visited the place before. This particular area of the forest was quite dark and bit wild. Plants and bushes were scattered around in disarray. Wand in hand, Draco entered the forest. He couldn't spot the Gryffindor anywhere. He opened his mouth, ready to call out for the other boy. But as his mouth opened, the scent of spring and fallen rain was drawn into Draco's mouth.
Draco was taken aback. If Potter distracted him, it meant that he was something for Draco; that he affected his concentration. Swearing at his slip of the tongue, Draco gave Potter his back. The blond resumed practicing his Patronus Charm, ignoring Potter's presence entirely.
"I haven't talk to Professor Slughorn. I don't think that it's his concern… And maybe it's not yours either, professor." Draco's face twitched.
"Ah, yes. Fifty points from Gryffindor and fifty for Slytherin!"
"What we want, young Malfoy," the Auror crooned, coming closer, "is you."
"Where's Potter?" Narcissa asked as they ate dinner.
"Whoa, that's bizarre!" Potter repositioned himself so that he was leaning against the headboard, and started with reading the first page of the novel. Draco snorted at the boy's antic. Soon they were both deeply engrossed into their respective books.
"I— what?" Draco honestly didn't understand. He hadn't seen anything even close to an animal form in the
Wait. No, not adorable. He meant annoying. Yes, annoying gesture! Definitely annoying!
so well that Potter hadn't felt him penetrating his memories. After some minutes, Draco was finally able to hold his guts back. Though images of frightened beaten little Potter with broken bones and ribs still flashed in his eyes, Draco stood up, balancing his posture.
"Thank you for fixing my mother's wand." Draco smiled at the blushing boy before him.
"Your face!" Potter managed to say in between two bout of hysterical laughter.
"Fine!" And Potter waited until Draco dropped all the three pieces of his broken wand from the pouch to the ground. "
"Potter," Draco said, but he couldn't make any more words. He wanted to assure Potter that it was all right, that it was a normal thing. But it wasn't normal, and at the same time it wasn't something bad either. It was…special.
"No. Better not worry the Headmistress. They probably know we're not in Hogwarts. We should go back soon, after we hand these rats over to the Ministry." Draco looked back to his mother.
"Malfoy. Heard about yer wand yesterday. Guessed yer upset, eh." Hagrid nodded his head.
By the morning, Draco was grateful for waking up, as it meant some time last night the pain had abated so he fell asleep. It still hurt though, but Draco was able to bear such pain.
Potter released Draco's hand and replaced it to Draco's right hip, clutching his jumper hard, showing his excitement.
"Why did he call me master?" Potter asked as they waited for the house-elf.
They enjoyed their sandwiches while talking about Quidditch. When they finished their dinner, Draco wrote on a piece of parchment and put it into the box with the empty plate.
"I forgot to ask your answer for the Greengrass proposal. But I see why you've been holding it back for two weeks." Narcissa said flatly.
"That's enough!" Professor Dakarrt barked. "This is a class and you must behave yourself, Harper! Let what happened in the past stay in the past. Ten points from Slytherin for impoliteness in my class and for hostility to a fellow student! Class, continue your practice!" Dakarrt gave Draco a consoling look before returning to assist his students.
"Mm…dunno.." And that was the last reply Draco got from the boy before Potter fell asleep.
"I'm fine. Just bit cold," Draco lied. He hadn't realized he did that. The pain in his arm was heightening.
Once he'd finished dressing in the bathroom, Draco took out the Render box and sat on the unoccupied bed. Pulling out a box of truffles, he heard Potter gasp and a second later the boy was planting himself right beside Draco. Trying not to smile, Draco placed the box between them. Not even waiting for an offer from Draco, Potter pulled out another box of assortments from the Render box and proceeded to shove the sweets into his mouth, chewing eagerly.
"Sorry. I just don't want to meet her right now." Potter watched the label of Ginerva Weasley floating in their common room.
Their eyes met with the proximity.
This Friday, though, Harper once again contributed to Draco's stress. In class the professor had decided to see the students' progression on the charm. Draco wasn't in a good enough mood to do the charm, so he decided to lean against the wall and just watch other students struggle. He tried to be make himself invisible, but of course, Harper easily spotted him.
To stop the annoying boy from repeating himself, Draco concentrated hard on the memory of when he had pulled out his Render box and Potter had gasped at it. Successfully showing off and amazing the Gryffindor never failed to make Draco smug and happy.
"Think I got it from you, Potter. You're a bad influence for me."
"The cave wh-" Potter scratched his head, "The cave. Hidden behind the snow. Somewhere in this mountain."
Draco felt there was something he had to do after returning from the Manor, but waved it away. Maybe it was only the urge to murder Potter for troubling him at the Manor.
"Potter, you said you're this wand's master. Is this…the Elder Wand?" Draco asked in a low voice.
"Mr. Weasley, I believe it is not against the rules for Mr. Potter to sit at the Slytherin table. Have you forgotten my words about House Unity at the beginning of this term?" McGonagall stood tall from her seat.
Great. Now he was locked in the class, totally petrified. The class would be in use again Thursday noon. That meant he had to wait for two days until someone freed him. Unless his junior's spell wasn't strong enough would he be freed of the spell's effect in an hour.
"No – there must be a mistake. I-" Draco's sentence was cut by the other dark wizard.
"Huh?" Potter stared up at him with that stupid look.
"I wondered when you would realise it. You're so slow,
(See the end of the chapter for
"And how is this matter of Saint Potter any concern of mine, Granger?" Draco raised his head, looking at the Gryffindor girl from the tip of his nose.
"What's that?" Potter eyed the box.
Once in a while Draco heard Potter made noises and comments at the magazine. It was like reading with Pansy and Blaise back then. Draco paused his reading. Blaise and his mother had moved to France. So had Pansy. If they'd stayed in England and had returned to Hogwarts with him this year, they would probably be busy plotting revenge on Harper right now.
"I can't do it!" Draco flung his hands down to his sides, fists tight. "I can't cast a
"You can see them?!" Potter sounded surprised.
"Um, why would you want it back?" Potter asked, though both of them knew it was a stupid question. Potter's back hunched protectively.
"I don't want to ask why you're here, Potter." Draco walked toward the other boy. "What are you doing?"
"You look pathetic yourself, Harper. How long did you have to wait for this opportunity? Only dare to confront someone when you are positive they can't defend themselves?" Draco stood fearless.
Wait, why was he blushing?
Draco blinked.
"Wait, wait, Harry. I think we should wait—"
"Oh, all right."
Mentally, Draco didn't know for sure what had caused them to exchange intriguing smile to each other. But for sure, he enjoyed the impromptu.
Friday and Saturday, Draco worked in his potions lab and ordered Potter to fly and play outside and avoid meeting his mother. He also asked Tippy to spy on his mother and report if the house-elf found his mother did something suspicious involving Potter.
Potter smirked.
"But, Draco, you know what artefact that is." Narcissa looked up at her son, her brows drawing together, and said, "You have to own Potter to be able to take the necklace back."
When he arrived at his favorite spot in the forest, Draco checked his surroundings.
Draco was between wanting to kiss Potter because the boy seemed to treasure his scarf, and at the same time, wanting to break down in fury and run to the Gryffindor Tower and throw a nasty hex on the Weaselette. But his focus was on Potter. He had to calm him down again.
"I showed it to him once. He liked it and he borrowed it." Draco lied.
As Draco finally arrived in his room, he stared at the pouch in his hands. He kept staring at it motionless. And then he moved toward his trunk and put the pouch in it with care.
Draco hesitated, but decided to stay – mostly because he was attracted to Potter's magic. He hadn't known that magic had a scent and a taste. He'd never noticed any before. Draco only sensed people's magical signature, his own magic signature – up until now. He had never found anything to indicate that magic had a taste and scent. So why he could taste Potter's magic?
(See the end of the chapter for
Unexpectedly, Potter slapped Draco's hand away.
Draco hoped the ex-Death Eaters weren't making their way toward the Manor. What if they planned to attack his parents? He still had his mother's wand on him! Forgetting his breakfast, Draco dashed out to the castle's gates. But wait. If the ex-Death Eaters were invading Hogsmeade, the gate must be closed and guarded and he wouldn't be able to Disapparate to the manor.
From the beginning of their Hogwarts year, all this time, he and Potter had always been sitting facing each other in the Great Hall. It was a purely innocent act, because he never noticed it nor intended to do it before. Had Potter noticed about this, too? Then Draco had a second realization. This whole time, in his Hogwarts years, never had in his mind, even for a second, strayed from Harry Potter. He had always compared anything and everything around him with Potter. He had always thought, 'what would Potter do if,' 'what would Potter think if Draco did something?'
And oh Sweet Merlin, Potter had one too!
"Tippy will do, Master Draco, yes!" The elf nodded enthusiastically.
His mother would gather him in her arms.
"Tippy is a free elf! Her loyalty is to Master Draco Malfoy!" The house elf nodded and fisted her hands. Then Draco saw Potter cast a
It only took milliseconds for Draco to process what was happening. Potter thought he hadn't wanted it and was angry at him for it.
"The Patronus Charm is an immensely complicated, very difficult spell. To successfully cast the spell, you're not only summoning the happiest memory you can think of, but you are also balancing your mental state and centering all your concentration on your magic." Professor Dakarrt looked at Harper from below his lashes. "The vast majority of witches and wizards are unable to produce any form of
"Don't you have me?" Draco licked Harry's lips.
"What? Of course I'm fine." Draco was confused by the question.
"Harry! Boy, good to see you." The Minister of Magic shook hands with Potter.
"I thought you said to prepare with the warmest outfit for today. Why are you only wearing…is that jean jacket, Potter?" Draco narrowed his eyes. He walked approaching Potter.
Draco felt his stomach flip. He was in panic and terror.
What was he thinking? Draco slapped himself mentally. He better concentrate on his apple pie.
Draco tried again and again to conjure up the silvery mist. For each new try, the duration of his
…" He moved his wand clockwise seven times.
"Potter," Draco called when the other boy opened the door.
Draco felt a strange feeling bubble up inside him. The gentle treatment Potter was giving him, and that soft expression on his face, made Draco want to forget about everything and focus his mind and body only to the boy beneath him. He wanted to get rid of everything that could take that look on Potter's face away from him. Unable to take in this new and intense feeling, Draco broke the kiss and buried his face into Potter's neck. He rubbed his nose into the warm neck, and then placed his lips against it. He trailed open-mouthed kisses on Potter's neck, up to the jaw line, then to the flushed cheek, then broke apart and stared down at Potter. Draco gazed in adoration at him; the person who had melted his cold heart. He wanted to know what the other boy was thinking right now. But he guessed Potter wouldn't appreciate it if he tried to pry inside his mind, so he kissed Potter's forehead instead.
As he walked to his bed, Draco heard the door he had just closed open again, and he spun around.
"Why?" Draco looked in the common room direction.
Wait a minute.
"It worked."
"You smiled." Potter blinked. "You actually smiled."
"Harry, I think you're mistaken your nightmares with terror of the past." Draco reached out to caress Harry's arms, "Remember when the ex-Death Eaters visited the manor? You were so eagerly wanted to go with me and when we arrived, you showed natural respond of firm readiness and determination to enter a battlefield. So those dreams, love, I think they were telling you that you missed the battle." Draco had Harry turned to his side and was facing him. He stroked Harry's hair tenderly, comforting. The dark hair boy staring at Draco, and then he closed his eyes, feeling the alluring touch on his hair. Draco gathered the boy into his embrace and soon following him chasing dreamless slumber.
"Malfoy, stop being insufferable for just this once. Why is Harry wearing a Malfoy ring on his finger?" Granger moved one step closer.
"What are you doing, Potter?" Draco asked, slightly annoyed.
Perhaps due to the kiss and Potter's dazzling smile, and with the addition of his recalled memories, Draco's head felt light. A moment later Draco found his hand carded through Potter's hair, and he was kissing the other boy deeply. In response, Potter wrapped his arms around Draco's neck and pulled him closer so that they were connected from head to toe. Then Draco wrapped his right arm around Potter's waist, his hand still holding his wand. Their kiss was deep and slow and it sent an electric wave down Draco's spine. Stroking Potter's upper lip with his tongue, Draco separated their mouths carefully. With his face hovering Potter's, the Slytherin's eyes bore into emerald orbs.
"And do you remember why I gave it to you?" Draco was starting to feel his stomach ache. He hoped Potter didn't think that he'd really given it to him forever.
"Are you always this lazy, Harry Potter?" Draco tilted his head backward. "Well, fix yourself. I'm taking a shower."
"Well, it was supposed to be hidden and unable to be found easily!" Potter replied Draco's sigh.
"Wow, Draco. This place is absolutely brilliant! I've never seen something beautiful like this…" Harry with glassy eyes thanked Draco by a big nod.
Sated, Draco put back the wooden box into his trunk. Discarded assortment boxes were Evanescoed by Potter.
"I just what, Potter?" Draco spun to face Potter. He hoped he hadn't done something bad or stupid. Oh Merlin, was his
"Holy Merlin! You have a Quidditch pitch!" Potter stared in disbelief at the green field before him.
On Saturday morning, Draco intended to visit the Trophy Hall where Peeves the Poltergeist was usually around. He walked out of his room at eight, when most of the students were just deserting Hogwarts for Hogsmeade. As he closed his door and walked toward the common room, he saw Granger sitting on the armchair.
Hesitantly Draco raised his left hand and touched Potter's hair. He couldn't stop thinking about how that messy hair could be so soft to his touch. Slowly, Draco started to stroke the hair that was nearly as smooth as his. When the boy woke up later, he had to ask him what hair product he used to tame that wild hair. If there was that good a shampoo sold out there, then he wouldn't have to brew his own shampoo formula again to make his hair silk-smooth and shiny. Feeling drowsy, Draco slipped his right arm beneath Potter and the left one around Potter's waist. It was Sunday after all, so he had the right to fall back into the world of dreams.
"Oh, so the proposal was a marriage proposal with Daphne?" Po- Harry joined the whispers.
"How long have you been standing there? And how did you find this place?" Draco pointed his wand at Potter. Salazar, he swore he would hex Potter if the boy had followed him here and had been watching him the whole time. But when Potter grinned and waved the Marauders' Map, Draco rolled his eyes and lowered his wand.
"What? No, I'm not cold. Why would you think I am?" Draco furrowed.
Draco followed behind, still confused as to what in Merlin's name he thought he'd been doing just now.
"But, mother…" Draco reflexively hid his right hand behind him. He couldn't give it to Potter – it was meant for his intended.
They blinked in unison.
The younger wizard cleared his throat.
"Draco…oh gods…nnnhhhh…I…I…oh gods, Draco! Ahhh!" Harry tensed and then he came, pouring his honey to their flushed skins. Muscle clenched tightly as he climaxed, bringing Draco to the edge and came almost simultaneously.
"Ask nicely, Malfoy," Potter said in singsong.
"Potter, you are avoiding you friends." Draco saw the other boy flinch and lower his head. "I know it's not my business, but after the battle, I noticed that you were retreating from everyone, from the world, Potter." Draco saw Potter lift his face and look at him from behind his spectacles. "You don't have to answer. But you look unhappy and it…bothers me…" Draco looked away. He could feel his pale face flushing irresistibly.
"What else did your muggle uncle do to you when you were small?" Draco emphasized his every word by tightening his grip on Potter's arm.
Salazar! Harry Potter had been a constant presence in Draco's thoughts – for the last seven and a half years.
"How deep were you in the forest?" Potter asked.
"You survived being in the same room as me and managed to sleep well with me." Potter reminded him.
He felt like a squib attending a magical school.
"God! This is so embarrassing! How many times had we got caught by your mother?!" Harry released his arms from Draco and both boys laughed in unison.
"Are you all right, mother?" Draco hugged back.
! Damn it, Potter, I can't! I've been under the dark for too long! I can't. Cast. A
"Um, Mrs. Malfoy, I accidentally made Walburga Black's portrait mad and uh, she provoked all other portraits to scream and fit…" Potter was fiddling his thumbs.
"So, Potter. How are you going to fix my mother's wand?" Draco turned his body so he was facing Potter properly.
"What?!" Draco raised his head to look at his mother in horror.
Feeling fear for the Unicorn, and somehow a little pity, Draco made a risky decision. Unicorns were able to heal themselves naturally, thanks to their extremely powerful regeneration ability. The sooner the wound healed, the sooner the Unicorn could save itself from the predator. Strengthening his resolve, Draco took the wounded leg into his left hand, held it tightly, and with a brief warning to the Unicorn, Draco pulled the branch out of the leg and threw it far inside the forest, hoping the beast behind him would run off chasing the bloody branch. Well, it wasn't a dog, but worth the try.
"Wait, Professor!" Potter called the portrait but it went into a false sleep once again.
The next morning Draco woke up before Potter, the latter still sleeping in his arms. And on waking up, he was finally clear-headed enough to process the big revelation about the Boy Who Lived last night, which had surely changed Draco's view of Harry Potter. Draco recalled all the taunting he'd thrown toward Potter in the past seven years and he felt sick with himself. He couldn't imagine being in Potter's place. Being alone, neglected and abused since he was a baby. Oh Merlin, he felt a sudden rush of great affection toward his parents and – finally Draco accepted the feeling – toward Potter. He tightened his grip around the other boy protectively.
"Er..your wand."
The silence lengthened.
!" A silvery mist-like light whipped out of the end of Draco's wand. Draco gasped, blinking several times until the silvery mist disappeared.
"Oh Draco, I'm sure we will be all right. I have my wand now." Her mother held his arm. "Will you be back here before you return to Hogwarts?"
"Potter, you can take your robe off. It's not cold here," Draco told the dark-haired boy as he wrote something on a small piece of parchment and then put it inside the box before he closed it again.
Draco stared at Potter's back in horror. Was he serious? Had the great Boy Who Lived gotten purposely starved in his childhood? In a split second Draco was on his feet and he grabbed Potter's left arm and spun him around.
"Potter! How did you get the necklace?" Draco hissed at him.
Draco tried to think of his previously recalled memories, making a hard blush come to his face.
"I thought you weren't hungry."
A magical string whirled from the wand's tip and twisted around the broken wand, wrapped the split point and then the broken wand was straightened, repaired. Draco dropped his jaw.
They both had talked about Quidditch, Muggle football, potions; Draco had even updated Potter with all the gossips around Hogwarts he got from Peeves the Poltergeist. They were quite tired now. Two boxes of assortments had been consumed within those hours.
"Well hidden!" Potter laughed.
"Potter," Narcissa greeted him, inviting him to sit. Draco sat on the same sofa. "So, how did you stray here?" she asked, to the point.
"Harry? Did I say something wrong? I did wrong?" Draco held the boy close.
He'd never realized it until now.
"Yes, Professor." Draco looked straight back at her.
Instantly Draco released his grip on Potter as Potter simultaneously pulled his arm away. Draco looked down at Potter. What he saw made him flinch. Potter was staring at him, pure fear in his eyes. "Potter? Are you all right?" Draco asked again. He reached out to touch Potter's shoulder, but the boy jumped backward with a gasp of shock. And then, making Draco wish he hadn't seen it, a tear slipped out of Potter's eye and trailed down his cheek, his chin, threatening to fall to the ground.
"Malfoy, I'm sorry about your wand."
, informing him that it was two in the morning. Draco got out from his bed and opened his door with some resentment at the interruption. Resentment turned into concern when he saw Potter.
"Yeah. It's Hogwarts map." Potter unfolded the parchment and showed it to Draco.
Draco's well-torn wand, in pieces.
"If you really cared about him, he wouldn't be hiding from you now, would he?" And with that, Draco closed his door, ignoring whatever Granger and Weasel were about to say in their defense. Draco casted Tempus and was surprised at the time shown.
"I'm positive your wand is unrepairable." Potter tried to free his hand from Draco's strong grip.
Draco saw Potter standing near the hall's doors, just staring at him. Holding himself upright, Draco returned to the Great Hall and Potter dutifully accompanied him to the breakfast table.
"Mischief managed." Potter touched the map with the tip of his wand, and a moment later, the map became a blank parchment.
"Some Unicorn blood splattered on my arm a few days ago," Draco explained.
Potter swallowed loudly. Draco's eyes almost popped out of their sockets.
When they arrived at the eighth years' common room, someone called Potter.
When they'd finished their lunch, Potter vanished the basket and the cloth.
"Potter, can you hear me?" Draco saw Potter nod. "Good. Now listen to me. Because of your stupidity, you've made yourself fall into an eternal sleep. I can free you from this, if you are willing to submit to me. As soon as you awake, I will free you. Understand?"
"What exactly are the dreams, Harry?" Draco intrigued.
What was that! Draco had never seen anything like it before! Not even in the Care for Magical Creatures class. Hippogriff? No, it wasn't. Though, it had the same pointy beak. Oh Merlin was the thing going to eat him alive? Thinking quick, Draco did what he hoped was the right thing to do. He lowered his torso and gave the beast a respectful bow, while keeping eye contact. The beast cocked its head and then looked away.
Draco leant forward a bit. He checked Potter's neck which was hidden underneath the Hogwarts robe. There was a hint of green inside. Draco didn't know where the feeling came from, but he was pleased by it.
"What?!" Draco made a face.
Potter stepped out of the bathroom with a puff of steam from his shower.
"Nope. Unicorn is a pure creature. Doesn't do harm." Hagrid answered.
"What?" Draco flushed red. He'd been watching the Gryffindor the whole time. He hoped Potter hadn't noticed.
"No. I'm not engaged to someone yet, idiot! Put that back on!" Draco was panicked at the mention of his future partner. He couldn't think of any person he could bear to live with. So, really, he didn't mind if Potter wore it for the moment. Just to take his mind away from the thought.
"What? I am capable of showing emotion, Potter. Malfoys are able to feel emotions, too." Draco furrowed his brow in mock affront at being insulted by a stupid Gryffindor.
After a brief talk with his father about the vanished Dark Mark on his arm, Draco and his parents enjoyed their dinner in the master dining room. When the desserts were laid out on the dining table, they felt the Manor's ward vibrate.
"Awesome! That was definitely a great start, Malfoy!"
"Malfoy, I said go away or you'll get hurt!" Potter yelled at Draco.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Ouch!" Potter dropped the wand back to the ground.
Render Box." Draco said softly. A moment later the trunk opened and the bless box floating toward them and landed on the empty bed between Draco and Potter.
"I don't have a hero complex! Look, you need the wand, don't you?"
"Five more minutes, Draco.." Potter murmured against Draco's chest.
From the corner of his eye Draco could see Potter tilting his head. Apparently the other boy was also bewildered by their
"What? Where are we going, Malfoy?" Potter followed him anyway.
"Not very far from the edge of forest. Maybe the Unicorn got lost or didn't realize it had strayed out from the inner forest." Draco's brow furrowed.
"You watch your step, Harper!" Potter shouted. Everybody's eyes were on Potter. "Okay?"
"Thank you," Draco said and then dashed out toward the caste. He heard Potter laughing behind him.
Draco shifted on his feet.
As Draco stepped inside, stopping one foot from the threshold of Potter's room, he noticed there was only one occupied side of the room.
"I don't know if I can go back to the manor, Draco…" Harry raised his head few inches to see Draco.
"Don't say sorry for what you didn't do, Potter!" Draco snapped. He often heard Potter apologize to people whose damages weren't even caused by any of Potter's actions. Draco felt disturbed by it somehow.
"So, you don't mind?" Draco squeezed Potter's hand, wordlessly comforting the boy.
"What?" Draco snapped.
The waves in the sea sounded so relaxing. Being with Harry made Draco happy.
What they saw when they stepped in the wide room made Draco angry. His mother and a house elf were petrified and on their backs on the floor, and his father was being
"Er…I also locked your door and cast Silencio so she won't hear me here."
At breakfast in the Great Hall Draco got an owl from the Ministry approving his proposal to give them all of the Malfoys' dark artefacts, which were to help the Ministry to reduce the expenses of the Wizarding World during the second war – which was more than enough. In return, Draco had demanded for the Ministry to clear the Malfoy name, and for them to stop sticking their noses into the Malfoys' fortune and seek dirty ways to demand nonsense retribution from his family.
"Don't want to cause any more trouble for it. It has taken more than enough lives. Besides, I'm quite content with mine." Potter tipped his wand.
"I believe you and Potter are in the best of a friendly relationship now." Narcissa lifted her eyebrows. Draco and Potter choked in unison.
"Oh, I could get use to this." Potter hopped to the bed with a big smile on his face.
"We're waiting for news from my parents first."
"I don't feel like going inside," Draco told the Gryffindor weakly.
Draco checked his pocket watch. Thirteen minutes had passed. He looked inside his cauldron. The color was now silver. All right, this was it. One movement from his wand and the color would turn into transparent silver and then he was done with the potion.
Muffles against Draco's neck and nail-scratches on his back were signaling a reach toward a climax of the writhing boy beneath him. Draco slipped his hand between their bodies and moved down, wrapped it around Harry's member. Gasp of pleasure came out from Harry's open-mouth as Draco stroked the throbbing member.
"Expecting you will stand on the aisle and take their daughter's hand seems to me more like a demand than a simple wish, Potter." Draco tilted his head to him.
"No! Ginny, stop it!" Potter tried to free his hand from the girl's grip. Draco watched closer and finally he could see clearly what the girl was trying to pull off of Potter's finger; Draco's ring.
"Hey, Malfoy. If you have this box, why bother the owl to send letters and packages?" Potter asked.
"The cupboard. What was it?" Draco asked as Potter stood in front of him again.
They both stepped on it.
A minute later the headmistress walked down stairs from her room and stood on the landing.
"Don't spoil your night with this git, father. I'll take him to my wing and…take care of him." Draco bid his parents goodnight and dragged Potter from the entrance hall to the left wing of the Manor.
"What has all this to do with me?" Draco pulled their attention toward him again. Trust Potter to cause a scene at the worse of times.
"I distract you?" Potter raised an eyebrow and folded his arms over his chest.
One minute had passed and the potion hadn't showed its effects. His skin still hurt and the scar burnt red in anger. Draco gritted his teeth. The pain was getting worse every time and the duration was increasing. Was he allowed to panic now? But…no, Malfoy didn't panic. He had to endure the pain until it was gone. Would it leave at all anyway?
Potter was trashing wildly in his sleep, crying. Between the sobs and moans, the boy gasped some vague words that sounded like "no," "don't," and "leave." Potter was having a nightmare. Draco rose and approached the boy in panic. What should he do? His mother would wake him and hug him when he had a nightmare. She would comfort him until he calmed down and went back to sleep. Should he do the same to Potter? A heart-wrenching shout from the dark-haired boy took the decision for Draco.
"Thank you." Draco took over the strap, brushing his calloused fingers with Potter's.
Draco grabbed his bag on the ground and started to pick its contents which were scattered all over the floor. Potter handed him the last item of his possessions. Draco stared at the dark-haired boy. He wanted to say mind your own business, I don't need your help, or maybe thank you, but honestly he didn't know how he felt about all that.
"Wow, Potter, for a second I thought it looked like the remnants of my wand." Draco's voice was very flat.
"How is that…Wait. Potter, are you saying that there's a wand master who can fix broken wands out there? If that's true, Potter, in case you're completely ignorant about your surroundings, no wand masters accept Malfoys in their shop now. Our name is ostracized from their shops."
always right." Draco entangled Harry's hair and tugged it.
"It means, Harry, that from the moment Draco disarmed me, he possessed the mastery of the Elder Wand and has not lost the claim since then." The portrait moved his eyes to Draco.
Draco frowned. It was very unusual for Potter to let him enter his room. Why would he have to follow Potter for his wand? Potter could fetch it for him.
Draco was panicking inside. Potter was kissing him! It made his body hot! Blood pumping through his vein with blinding speed! He couldn't breathe! His mind was closing down! Sweet Merlin!
"Now try it," Potter told Draco.
"Turn around this instance and get your arse in this bed, Potter!" Draco ordered Potter when the boy started towards the White Room.
Potter liked him.
"Hush you two, go back to your cauldron now. And no, Mr. Wallader, Miss Granger, it's supposed to be marigold before it changes into aquamarine. Not muddy blue." Slughorn moved to check other cauldrons.
Draco looked around and saw Potter standing by the audience tower. Draco walked on, approaching Potter.
As they entered the Great Hall, words about Potter wearing a Malfoy ring were resonating throughout the hall, but it went silent as soon as he and Potter came in. Potter must feel uncomfortable with everybody looking at them like that, Draco thought. So he released Potter- no, Harry, because it was Harry now, slowly. However, a second later Draco smiled smugly and walked to the Slytherin table with Potter gripping his hand firmly.
It was too late for Draco to be surprised at the memories his mind had pulled up, and when he casted the incantation, a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the tip of his wand. Astounded, Draco stepped backward, only to have his body held by Potter behind him. The shadow disappeared as suddenly as it had come, his concentration broken.
"Harry! Where have you been, mate? We've been waiting for you for ages!" said the Weasel, before he spotted Draco. "What are you doing there Malfoy?"
"T-thanks." Potter didn't remove his hand from the scarf, nor asked Draco to take his hand off of him.
Draco moved his eyes to the map again.
"Wait!" Draco held Potter's wrist.
"Your—"
"What's this?" Draco eyed the forest. Between the musty breezes, the fresh scent flowed in from the east side. Curiosity being a Slytherin trait, Draco walked to the east side, to the deeper forest. And then he saw Potter, standing against a tree, his head touched to the trunk. Draco walked closer.
"Now what?" Potter asked the blond.
The situation repeated on Friday. The pain on Draco's arm became harder to bear. Potter joined him at mealtime and was apparently still avoiding his friends.
"You're welcome." Potter plucked his favorite dessert with the fork and put the big chunk to his mouth. "Mm, so good, Malfoy."
"What did you say?" Draco swallowed. There was something. The gears in his head were spinning.
"Perfect is natural to me, Potter," Draco said proudly.
With a deep sigh, Draco took off Potter's shoes and robe magically. He removed the round spectacles from Potter's face and put them on the nightstand. Feeling that there was nothing left to do, Draco proceeded to undress himself and then followed Potter to enter the dream world.
"Mister is not taking Master Draco without his willing!" Tippy cried and then threw the dark wizard holding Draco to the floor. Draco took that chance to pull out the Elder Wand from his pocket, and disarmed all four intruders. Potter took his wand from Draco's hand and casted
Potter gasped.
"What do you want?" Draco seethed.
"What's wrong, Malfoy? Giving up already?" Harper's voice echoed loudly, stopping the entire class in whatever they were doing. When Draco gave him his trademark annoyed sneer, Harper opened his ugly mouth again; "Can't make it, eh, Malfoy? That's because you've been marked! A dark wizard is what you are." Harper snorted.
Draco looked up to the cloudy sky. It looked like the day had passed its peak. Not that he could see the sun, but Draco knew this side of the forest well. From the movement of leaves and the forest's unique atmosphere, Draco could tell that it was past noon. Around four o'clock, perhaps? Draco decided that his complete-fail of practices were enough for the day. Walking out of the forest, he took the lawn route to calm himself. When he walked to the damped grass, Draco felt a breeze on his back, and the hairs on his skin sprang up. Draco turned his head around, just soon enough as to see Harry Potter enter the forest. Intrigued, Draco followed.
"No!" Potter made a horrified face.
"C-chat." Potter stared wide-eyed at him. His face was blushing furiously.
"Er…here. I brought the parchment." Potter waved the item he held and walked to the unoccupied bed.
"Potter, can I ask you something?" Draco's sentence sounded more like a demand than a question.
Draco was astonished. There were intruders, and they had to have broken the ward to get inside, yet here was the ward, working as it was supposed to. Either there were no intruders and the gate's report had been wrong, which he doubted, or the broken ward had restored itself or been re-set by his parents. If the ward had restored itself, it meant the intruders had been at the manor for quite a long time, enough time for the ward to reform again. Draco then invited Potter in, letting the ward know that Potter was an approved guest, and then he dashed toward the manor.
"Was it, Draco?" the portrait asked Draco.
"…Well, that was…not so ordinary…" Draco fell back to the ground, feeling his legs weakened by everything that had happened. He felt a slight pain on his left arm. His arm covered with the stick silver blood. He wiped off the blood from his arm and cleaned it with his handkerchief. This was the arm with the scar of his Death Mark, Draco remembered. The skin there had reddened considerably.
"Oh, that's all right, dear. You better go now, then." Narcissa gave Draco a motherly hug. "And thank you, Mr. Potter."
"Dumbledore?" Draco suggested.
"Merlin," Draco sighed softly, "I had to put it on your finger because you were cursed by a dark artefact, and I forgot to take it back once I freed you from the curse." Draco explained.
"Professor Hagrid, can I talk with you for a moment?" Draco stopped the Care of Magical Creatures professor on his way out the hall.
"We're late, Potter. Hogwarts?" Draco patted the boy again.
"Um, Malfoy, do you know where Harry is?" Granger asked nervously. Behind her was her boyfriend, Weasel.
"Uh…Hagrid never showed them to us before…" Draco sounded unsure.
"Um…can we talk to Professor Dumbledore's portrait? We need to ask him something," Potter asked directly. She studied them first, and then nodded.
That made Draco burst out laughing.
"What? Where?" Draco brushed his face randomly.
There was most definitely a deafening silence.
As Draco threw himself toward Potter, the dark-haired boy bolted up and gripped Draco's arms so tightly that it cut the flow of blood there. Potter was looking at Draco's eyes with his own wide orbs. Breaths short and fast, his heart was beating at a too rapid tempo.
Silver blood rushed out of the flesh, running down the earth. Some of the silver liquid covered Draco's left arm, the one that was holding the wounded leg. Draco hissed. The silver blood felt hot on his skin, nearly burning by the blood's contact. He recalled the lesson about Unicorns and found nothing about the effect of Unicorn's blood when it made contact with human's skin. Draco looked at his arm. The blood was now covering all the surface of his left forearm. It felt so hot. He released his grip on the Unicorn's leg and watched as the furry white open flesh magically closed.
Without a word, Draco wandlessly hit Potter with
"Alright?" Draco paused as the boy beneath him squeezing his eyes shot. Harry bit his plump bottom lip, whimpering in uncomfortable fashion. "Harry, this is your first this way?" Draco stopped and carefully tried to retrieve his finger back out. Mentally Draco slapped himself for asking such stupid question. Of
"Show it!" Weaselette barked at the centre of the class. Potter's jaw dropped, and he looked at her with a horrified look on his face. "If you were not a Death Eater, show us your left arm!" Weaselette walked quickly toward Draco and without a word she grabbed Draco's left wrist and yanked up his sleeve, exposing his flawless pale skin. The whole class gasped at the revealing.
Potter then pulled out a velvet green pouch. He walked closer to Draco. When they were two feet apart, Potter withdrew the content from the pouch.
"Yes. Well, then, all right. But fifty points is my limit to give points to a student. Go ahead, Malfoy, cast your Patronus." Professor Dakarrt ordered the class to give Draco some space.
"You almost form a corporeal
"I…I… " Potter reached up and unwrapped the scarf.
"Do you think it refused to repair my wand because the wand saw it as its rival?" Draco asked Potter.
"Bloody hell! Potter, you'll pay for this!" Draco reluctantly removed his platinum ring and whispered the Latin incantation that parted it into two. He put back on the ring with the Malfoy crest and slipped the other one around Potter's middle finger. After he saw swirl of magic from the ring seeped into Potter and a faint of magic spark around Potter's neck, Draco repeated his earlier command and when Potter nodded, Draco returned to the dungeon and got back to work.
"Malfoy, even me, the wand's master couldn't make it fix the wand," Potter said softly.
"Yes, Professor." Draco swallowed. Did she know?
"Hm? Dunno. Perhaps because I didn't get enough food when I was little?" Potter shrugged, leaning against the chair.
"Who are you?" Draco pointed his wand to the Auror.
Draco watched the class staring at his
"You know," Draco walked closer, making the Gryffindor pause in his act. "I never really hated you, Potter."
"Mr. Malfoy, I understand your concern over your parents' safety. But your safety is also my concern as your headmistress. You should have informed me before you made the decision to leave Hogwarts without my knowledge. And you too, Mr. Potter." McGonagall looked at them behind her spectacles.
"Why did it stop being so violent?" Potter asked Draco.
"Not so fast, Potter. We still have an unsettled matter." Draco raised his chin.
They spent the rest of the day discussing Quidditch, and that night Draco let Potter sleep in his bed again.
"Bloody hell!" Draco turned his head toward the Gryffindor table and his eyes met Potter's. He walked quickly back to the doors.
"Er…guess I fell asleep when I waited for you to wake…Ah! What time is it now?" Potter jumped out of Draco's bed and took his wand from beneath another bed's pillow.
Draco took the basket cover made from cloth material, put it down in front of him and then resized it enough for them to sit on it. He grabbed the basket, placed it on the wide cloth layer then sat beside it to have his lunch. Potter grinned and sat on the cloth, facing Draco.
"You don't look fine. What is it? Did he hex you or something?" Potter grabbed Draco's left arm.
"Mmm Malfoy, this is delicious!" Potter chewed the sweet greedily. Draco chuckled.
"That's not called nice if they want something from you, Potter." Draco continued reading the papers.
Definitely extreme deafening silence as Draco couldn't hear what was Potter saying.
"Ginny! What are you doing here?" Potter shouted back.
"I was so worried, Harry… Why didn't you tell us? We could have gone with you." Granger put her hands over her heart, as if showing Potter how much she had been worried and hurt that her friend was keeping things from her. Draco felt his nausea rising at the show.
"Potter?"
"Just…trust me, this once. Look, everybody in Hogwarts knows your wand is broken and at lunch I heard words about students who don't fancy you might hex you because you are now defenseless." Potter nibbled his bottom lip, staring at Draco's silver eyes. Draco stared back and thought about the offer.
"I say you have the right to do so, Potter. I think you need some time alone now. I'll see you…tomorrow then?" Draco hesitated to ask next, but he thought it was the right thing to do right now. "Or, er…if you need company, I…"
"Now now, behave young Malfoy." The Auror swung his wand above Draco's mother. "Doesn't matter who I am. What's important is that you're here. Now we can start the ritual." Then the Auror freed the three petrified dark wizards. One of the dark wizards snatched their stolen wands back from Draco and Potter, taking the two boys' wands in the process.
"I…people around me got hurt before – when my magic went wild and reached them. The magic would hit them and throw them away – hard. It felt like a burn when my magic touched their skin." Gradually, Potter's voice had faded as he spoke, and the last words were spoke in the last breath of a pained whisper.
"What do you mean, Professor? What does that mean?" Potter looked between the portrait and Draco.
Draco felt Potter flinch. And when Potter started to pull away from him, Draco tightened his arms around him and pulled the boy back against him.
As soon as Draco stepped inside his room, he pulled out the letter and the soothing vial from his robe.
"He's not a Death Eater!" And of course, all eyes went straight to Potter at that. "He can produce a
"No, ma'am." Weasel said lowly and sat back down.
"Playing secret, are we?" Draco lifted his eyebrow.
"Watch your step." Draco laughed heartily when he saw Harry jumped backward after he looked down. The floor was made by thick glasses. Below the thick glasses was a foot depth pool. The glasses were reflecting lights into the water, playing waves of lights dancing around inside the house. "Let's go upstairs."
"I can-" Potter cut off and his cheeks tinted red. Draco studied his face.
"Death Eaters can't cast
"And you're not, dear?" Narcissa raised an eyebrow toward Draco.
"Mr. Malfoy, I had not expected the Daily Prophet to have such information. But I talked with and assured both professors and students before you came in that you are not guilty of the charges pressed against you, and that you are faithful to the light." said McGonagall. "And for your safety, Malfoy, from now on you are not allowed to leave Hogwarts at least until all the remaining Death Eaters are captured."
"Potter, I'm sorry if I caused you trouble with what I said in the common room. But surely your friends took it wisely, didn't they?" Draco cupped Potter's cheek and turned the boy's face to his.
Draco crossed his arms over his chest, staring at the wand, and put on the bed before him.
So he just sighed instead. He decided to take a long bath in the en suite small bathroom of his room. Oh the joy of not having a roommate. He could stay in the bathroom as long as he wanted.
"Oh, it's cards. Muggle game. Come on, let's play. It's fun!" Potter sat up and gathered the cards spread on the bed.
Draco whirled around, startled, and saw Potter standing about ten feet from him.
"Shut up and kiss me."
"I don't know. He didn't have the time, maybe?" Harry shrugged, "But, I think I have a better idea."
"Very good. Now, try again."
Draco tapped his wand to Potter's chest.
. I discarded our pants since long time ago." Harry smirked. He then locked Draco's waist with his legs and pushed down, eliciting delicious moan from Draco, "And sometimes you think too much, Draco."
"Um…" And finally Draco realized that his arms had been holding Potter the whole time. He hadn't mean to and hadn't actually realized it. Draco detached himself from Potter, arms dropping to his sides.
Potter snapped his head from the ring and looked at Draco in deep disappointment. But, Draco thought, it was more of a sad face than a disappointed one after all. Merlin, his suspicions had been right. Potter thought it had been a gift to him. It was a priceless ring, yes, Draco knew that. But Potter didn't have to be that sad to not have it. He must have been offered much expensive stuff by his friends and relatives before, right? So why should he act as if he had lost a valuable thing?
The boy straddled the bench beside his two friends who had been busy eating since Draco came. They sat at the bench opposite Draco's.
The Thestral nudged Draco and in one swift motion Draco climbed up and straddled the beast behind Potter, afraid of the beast's pointed beak.
They were in their fifth month now. And Draco was getting frustrated by his mother's wand. It seemed the wand wouldn't cooperate well with him. Sometimes, when he casted a complex spell, the effect wasn't at its optimum result and sometimes the spell hit the wrong target.
"What chosen one?" Draco asked the Auror.
"Yes." Draco answered sharply.
could fly off.
"Hurry, boy. I want them to get out of the Manor as soon as possible." Narcissa ignored her son's protests and walked out from the guest room toward the library.
"Ollivander?" Potter suggested.
"Mind your step, Malfoy!" Harper said as he passed.
"Um, maybe we'll still have time before we have to return to Hogwarts…" Potter bit his bottom lip.
if you do!" Draco gripped the boy's arm hard.
"Malfoy. I want to talk to you." Granger stood up and took a step toward him.
"They're here!" Draco pulled out his mother's wand and ran into the wide driveway. He stopped and turned back when he heard Potter's yell.
"Excellent! Now, get a very happy memory and try to boost your
"I…Can we—"
"What cave?" Draco followed, climbing off of the Thestral.
"Try again." Potter walked behind him and put his hands on Draco's shoulders gently. "Relax. Concentrate. Think about a happy memory. Let it fill your mind first."
Apparently Draco didn't need to ask his parents' approval for Harry because their indirect verbal and nonverbal gestures had shown him that they accepted Draco's choice open arms.
"Now, Harry, I want to show you something." Draco nodded to the flower field and Harry tilted his head, puzzled of where and why were they here. Draco watched Harry deeply inhaled the fresh air and pleasant fragrance from the flower field. And then Draco reached up and put his right palm flat in the air.
"Mind your own business, Potter!" Harper raised his wand.
a Dark creature? Something Dark? Oh Merlin, not Nagini, not Nagini, not Na—
"My wand."
Potter replied to Draco's words with a rustle of parchment. Draco looked to his right and saw Potter was preparing a parchment and a quill.
"Uh, yeah. Let's." Potter started to walk.
"Right, whatever. Now we better get back to the castle. Seriously, it's getting dark. I'm positive when we arrive, it'll be dinner time." His scarf now secured around the Gryffindor's neck, Draco let go of it and turned to head for the castle.
That day they didn't avoid each other's eyes again. Understanding was on Draco's rarely-gentle face the first time Potter glanced at him that morning. Potter responded by nibbling his bottom lip. It made Draco warm all over. But the warmth was gone for the DADA class. Draco wanted to choke the professor. Today they were practicing a
"Harry, did you vanish them? I swear if you can—"
"I think helping me fix my wand isn't something against the law, Potter." Draco quirked his eyebrow Malfoyishly. "And Potter, as far as I know, you, as in general, can't fix a broken wand."
"Why a Wyvern?" Potter asked as they both walked toward their chambers.
"All right, Harry?" Draco smirked teasingly.
"Potter, I will keep waiting here until you give me back my wand." Draco crossed his arms before his chest.
"Yes… Professor, can I ask you something? Does Unicorn's blood have negative effect if it makes contact with human's skin?" Draco hoped nobody would hear their conversation. He could see from the corner of his eye that everybody in the Great Hall was watching him.
"Are we still in Scotland?" Draco asked as they search blindly, while Potter made little explosion and melting spells to snow mounds here and there.
"T-the ex-Death Eaters. The ex-Death Eaters who were hiding since last year came out last night. The Aurors couldn't catch any of them yet. The Daily Prophet says they were tracked in Hogsmeade and could be wandering to Hogwarts," a blushing fifth year girl said. Her eyes reminded Draco of Daphne Greengrass'. Draco shuddered.
"How long has she been standing there?" Draco whispered to Potter as they walked toward the manor's entrance hall behind Narcissa.
"Take the desk, Potter." Draco walked toward his own bed and continued reading the papers.
Immediately, Draco's wand was in his hand as he found they weren't expecting any guests and Disapparated to the wrought-iron gates on the driveway. Outside the gates, he saw the familiar silhouette of a wizard approaching. When the wizard had finally arrived before the gates, Draco's jaw dropped to the ground.
"There aren't. It's the Malfoys' heritage," Draco explained shortly. "Oh, and Potter, tell anyone about the box and you're history."
on you to find out?" Draco put his right hand back on Potter's shoulder. When Potter tried to brush his hands away, he just stubbornly tightened his grips. Then Potter sighed heavily, looking down, and Draco knew he had won.
!" Slughorn pointed his wand to the liquid. The liquid was gone in instant. Draco's wand fell down the floor, cracked through the middle. Unconsciously he looked at Potter and their eyes met.
"We continue this tomorrow, Potter."
"What are you talking about?" Potter asked in weak voice.
Draco blinked, turned his head to Potter then to his arm then to Potter again and the act went on and on.
"I heard her." Potter turned his head on the pillow to look at Draco.
There was nothing Draco could do as he arrived at the pitch. The Ravenclaw team was in the middle of practice that morning. Draco watched them for two hours and then it was the Gryffindors' turn to practice. Draco didn't want to see them, so he walked back to his common room and found the room was empty. It seemed the eight-year students were all in Hogsmeade. It was starting to bother Draco, being here without a friend and having nothing to do to pass the time. He decided to end the day locked inside his room.
"We'll see you in the Great Hall, Harry." Granger said and she and her boyfriend Weasel left the common room.
"So, you mean the Unicorn blood did this? Why did it only react now?" Potter furrowed, trying to understand.
"Um, do you wanna take breakfast first?" Potter walked inside the room and stood.
"Labelleza Dormit," Draco explained. "It brings him into an eternal sleep. To wake him up, he has to trade a particular precious thing and submit to the owner of the necklace. Don't worry, it can be broken when the owner sets him free."
"Of course I'm okay. I told you that. You just didn't listen," Draco sneered. Potter stared at the silvery eyes for a while, and then the dark-haired boy broke eye contact. He lowered his head and looked down.
They spent dinner talking about the upcoming N.E.W.T.s – because the whole Slytherin table seemed to be eavesdropping on them – and returned to their chambers after dessert. This time, Potter-
" Merlin, I don't know how I'll cope with your slow brain." Draco sighed dramatically. He stepped forward until there was no more space between them and then put his arm around Harry's waist and his right hand holding Harry's face. Harry blinked, finding himself a moment later drowning into Draco's infatuation kiss. A hard press on his lips and a blink later, Harry set his hands to the place where it belong on Draco and kissing back in equal passion.
At first Draco didn't like the idea of hanging around with Harry's friends – Granger said it was to make Harry study for his N.E.W.T.s – but it was better than holing himself up in his room alone, he supposed. If he was given the option, Draco preferred to be with Harry and tutor him alone in his room; Granger insisted they didn't, saying that the two of them would occupy their time with snogging rather than studying. However, and surprisingly enough, times with Harry's friends were almost bearable, because Draco could talk about lessons with Granger while Harry and Weasel played or debated over something completely silly and useless. Granger also gave Draco very good advice as to how to motivate Harry effectively to study for his N.E.W.T.s.
Draco was about to inform him that his mother was the scariest of the Malfoys when Potter's previous sentence hit him.
"Out. There's nothing to talk about. Out now, Potter. I don't need your pity." Draco held the door.
They Apparated back outside Malfoy manor to ride Tenebrus after they'd deposited the ex-Death Eaters and the spy, and flew back to Hogwarts' forest. Thankfully, the Hogwarts' ward acknowledged them so that they could land in the forest. They arrived at the Hogwarts entrance hall at noon. The four ex-Death Eaters had been handled by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and the Ministry had reunited all Aurors to interrogate them before they were sent back to catch other ex-Death Eaters.
Potter came closer and sat on the ground beside Draco, put something on the ground and then casted
"What?" The boy's friends waited.
"Uh…" For the first time, Draco Malfoy didn't know what to say. Draco tried to remember what had happened before he fell aslee- Oh, his arm! Draco snapped his head to see his left forearm and choked by his own breath as he saw it. "Great Merlin! What happened with my arm?" Draco cried.
"Yes. Yes you did, you git." Harry's words muffled in Draco's neck.
Draco opened his eyes and jolted up. The sudden movement was paused mid air when Draco noticed something beside him. The blond turned his head to his right side. Harry Potter was lying on the bed, sleeping. The Gryffindor's hand was gripping Draco's right arm tight and his leg was thrown over Draco's thigh.
After a moment far too brief, Potter removed his lips from Draco's. The blond gasped softly. His pupils were dilated, until there were only thin silver circles in his eyes. Draco stared at Potter who was staring back at him, hands on the blond's shoulders.
"W-what...I didn't…it was…I mean…uh…" Potter seemed like he wanted to run away.
"Yes. Go to sleep and snore as loud as you like while I turn the gears in my head to solve this Elder Wand problem." Draco moved to his own bed and sat on it, legs folded with the wand in his hand.
"Really? But why? I thought it's an important ring."
"What?!" Draco shrilled.
Draco couldn't tell Potter that he had entered his mind. He mentally thanked his aunt Bella for teaching him
Draco clenched his jaw. Gently, he cradled the crying boy into his arms. Draco let the smaller boy cry mutely, as hard and long as he needed to.
Draco stared at his mother in disbelief. Why had she hugged Potter? She never hugged other people. Draco shuddered. He glanced at Potter who was doing the same to him.
"Er…can I stay?" Potter walked toward the nearest tree and leant against it.
"Of course it can't. Don't want a chance of him losing it. Now, if that's all, I have something important to do." Draco left the common room toward the Quidditch pitch, and figured that he didn't need Peeves' help anymore.
"Sorry, Professor." Potter bowed his head.
"How does it work?" Draco looked at Potter with curiosity and excitement written all over his face.
A second later Potter casted a warmer charm to the room. Draco pulled out his pocket watch from his pocket and checked the time.
All of them were speechless. No one dared to chase Potter. Draco grabbed the parchment from the ground and came after Potter.
"Ah! Now, Draco, cast the same spell with the wand." Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. Draco took the wand from Potter and as soon as he gripped it, the light beam shone from its tip.
Whether the Unicorn understood his words or it was simply relieved that he hadn't left, the Unicorn seemed calmed.
"Don't know. Probably all night." Potter shrugged.
"What time is it now?" Draco asked Potter. Potter casted Tempus; it was two minutes before two. "I have Advanced Arithmancy until three forty-five. We'll talk about this after the class." Draco gave the dark hair boy a chance to decline by making a pause. The other boy nodded hesitantly.
Draco had lunch with Potter and his parents before they had to return to Hogwarts at four. After lunch, the two of them went back to the left wing and chatted leisurely. When afternoon came, Draco walked to his room for his trunk. He didn't ask Tippy to take it because he didn't like anyone, even house-elves, entering his room. After he'd shrunken his trunk and pocketed it, Draco walked to the entrance hall of the left wing where Potter stood and was looking outside the window. Draco smirked and approached the younger boy stealthily. He stood behind Potter and then slipped his arms around Potter's waist.
. While everyone viewed him as strong, it was easier to at least
But that luxury wasn’t part of his life now. Instead, he drifted through each day on an unnerving cloud of polite restraint. Well, mostly politeness, and sometimes only a modicum of restraint. But Draco was always aware of the fine line which it was necessary for him to walk.
“You don’t need to protect Winkleprick from the evil Wizengamot. He’s a big boy. He can take care of himself.”
on your face. That amount of sheer panic. It feels like there’s more to it than just a preference.”
When he next woke, Draco sensed a new wrongness. He could feel that Potter was still draped over him, but that was in satisfying order so didn’t seem to be the issue. Opening his eyes revealed the new problem.
Potter’s cheeks were flushed, his eyes bright. “Why isn’t it?”
. He needed to get her back out.
“You don’t
Harry answered carefully. “That’s not for me to decide.”
At the mention of Snape, Draco was filled with sudden concern. Snape might despise him now for whatever reason, but he’d helped Draco in little ways when he could.
And there was the blush again. It might not be necessary for Potter to utter words, since involuntary flushing was proving to be more reliably honest. But dealing with Potter’s inability to articulate was infuriating.
It seemed to Harry that Draco had censored himself. “What else were you going to say?”
“Tilt your head back. Close your eyes. You don’t deserve to look at me after your poor behaviour.”
“Seriously though,” said Draco. “If you really don’t want to, I can go down and tell him to fuck off. I have
“Malfoy?”
for that, and if he moved now, he’d miss the opportunity to feel Draco rouse beneath him.
“We don’t… have to do anything. But I… need this. For a little while,” Harry whispered.
Malfoy didn’t allow him time to recover before repeating the manoeuvre on Harry’s left cheek.
“You might’ve had some input,” Harry offered.
. There was something wrong with Harry. Somehow, Harry had never viewed his desires in that light before.
Michael’s chin jutted out stubbornly. “You weren’t harmed. I didn’t hurt you.”
“I’m so,
Draco’s eyes were filled with concern. Harry hated that he so often caused Draco to look at him like that but accepting others’ concern was also important. So Harry had been advised, anyway. Although Harry was severely struggling with that. But it was okay to ask for help. And it was okay to
Harry wanted to tell him and
“I… but you…” Potter’s gaze dropped to the mattress as he pulled in his bottom lip.
“For a few minutes,” Draco said as he lowered himself to lie alongside Harry.
Malfoy held him in place, making use of Harry’s body at a rhythm and pace of Malfoy’s choosing, and Harry moaned with the sheer pleasure of it.
No… Harry wasn’t there. He was in the study. Draco and Ron were still staring expectantly at him. Cautiously, he dropped his gaze back down, poised to move away in an instant if necessary.
Harry didn’t know how to react as Malfoy sat back on his heels to regard him.
Potter sat mutely during meals, responding to direct questions or comments from the other diners, but determinedly ignoring all aspects which concerned Draco.
going to be noisy.” Potter tutted, licking again, and Draco wondered what’d happened to the previously uncertain youth. These recent bouts of control were disconcerting. And entirely erotic.
. He wished that Potter would stop sighing like the world was coming to an end. And most of all, he fervently wished that Potter wasn’t such an appealing option, soaking wet and dangerously tempting.
And Draco wouldn’t let Potter go to waste either. If Potter needed help, support, therapeutic insults… that’s what Draco would give him. No matter what else did or didn’t happen between them.
Malfoy didn’t contradict him. “I’m aware of… some of it. I know you told me at the beginning of our relationship that you don’t like to top. I suppose I was thinking that maybe I could find a way that you
Harry could detect the subtle hint of self-mocking. And he knew Draco well enough to know that the best way to react to it was with humour.
Of course, it was hardly the first time he’d held Draco’s cock, but it was a new venture, nonetheless. Through role playing, Harry regularly had this penis in his hand, mouth, or arse; he knew every inch of it. But there were no instructions or demands here, only Harry’s exploration of the flesh which was rapidly hardening under his fingers.

“Can you sit up?” Draco enquired, stroking a hand down Harry’s side.
He looked down at the scroll in his hand. Fix it,
Draco almost hurt his cock during his haste to fasten his trousers. Adrenalin fuelling his sprint, he fought to close the growing distance between him and Potter, made it, grabbed Potter by an upper arm and snatched him back. He swung Potter around to face him, slipping on wet grass and mud.
Malfoy was clearly surprised too. Oops. Harry wasn’t supposed to be making decisions within this context, let alone using accidentally helpful wandless magic. He bit his lip again and blinked up at Draco, hoping for a positive reaction. After a short hesitation, the only reaction Harry received was a shrug before Malfoy pushed in.
… I could simply lie here and have a wank over that one… or many
From the higher vantage point, the mess in the room looked even worse.
He was going to give George a medal for creating such a wonderful thing. The man was a
“I knew you would. Thank you,” Draco replied. “Is it… weird, that I have her?”
“I’m certain that you’re beyond my assistance in
Draco appeared to debate it. “Bath,” he countered. “Must keep our wands nice and shiny.”
Malfoy had to be well aware of Harry’s struggle when he asked, “Do you deserve to come?”
Sinking unhurriedly deeper with shallow, careful thrusts, experiencing the tight grip, Harry realised that Draco’s wasn’t the only pleasure to consider today. Fuck… Harry didn’t think the act of penetrating someone had felt like this… it wasn’t… it
“Attach and treat the handle now, Harry. Then be sure to give it all a good thorough polishing and you’ll be done.” She giggled. “And you’ll have a
Michael stepped forwards, bringing the length of their bodies flush together. The additional contact caused Harry’s breath to stutter in his chest with panic, and with a gasp, Harry threw off the curse.
Harry leant to the side and gave an answering whisper of, “Me too,” into Draco’s mouth before he slid their lips together in a kiss.
“Your wand is working perfectly,” said Luna from behind the front counter.
“Can you hear me?
Soon enjoying a weary, sweaty Draco draped over his torso and between his legs, Harry wasn’t in a hurry to move. Neither it would seem was Draco.
But this was apparently the evening for wishes to come true. A juddering shudder beneath Draco preceded Potter’s orgasm, and that was the last straw for Draco’s tenuous control.
“No.”
No, Draco didn’t. He was entirely unconcerned about Potter, strange personality flips included. Draco let himself focus on Potter’s attentions again but it was no use denying the truth for long.
it has to be because of
Holding his finger about three inches from his face, Ron replied, “Umm… no.”
“And how modest you are,” said Harry as he walked back over to the edge of the bed.
, right. Harry could do this.
Harry didn’t care either way about Michael’s finances; he’d already made his point today. But something about this information didn’t ring true.
Harry separated their mouths and instructed, “Don’t move.”
Potter gave no indication of being offended. “Even taking that into account.”
Drinks were quickly poured and slowly sipped, and Malfoy seemed content. Until of course, the inevitable questioning began.
bloody damn
Harry turned to face an equally naked Draco on the bed. Draco was up, certainly. If would be easy enough to slide back onto the mattress and take advantage of the perkiness of that lovely body, but the propect of the missive had mostly killed Harry’s amorous mood.
“Confused, how?”
“No. That’s enough.” Luna smiled dreamily. “I do have another question though.”
“Even someone as incompetent as you can do better than that.”
He could feel Malfoy’s weight, both hands unrelenting as Malfoy pinned him effectively within a control that Harry knew he could easily escape, but suddenly had no desire to. Harry noticed the cool wood of his desk under his palms and spread his fingers to seek more of its reassuring texture. Most comforting of all was the growing hardness nestled in the groove of his arse; not moving, nor demanding, simply waiting in the chaos within the room. He allowed all the physical contact to ground him, and when he tried again to inhale, air blessedly filled his lungs and he gasped it in noisily and repeatedly. The contents of the office gradually stilled, Harry saw the walls regain their previous structure with a groan of shifting stone, and the shuddering floor settled back into stability.
He landed hard on his face amongst a pile of papers, quills and the wood that had been his desk. And the stupid marble quill holder was now digging into his ribs.

“I don’t want to,” he stated, hoping that was plain enough. “But if
here and let me show you,” Draco snapped. “Lose the clothes first.”
He shook and twitched and shivered and tried to focus on anything other than what was happening to him, but everything that was happening to him right now had become his whole worshipful world.

Draco bit his lip; he looked slightly shaky. Harry wished he hadn’t mentioned it.
Draco should’ve moved away. He shouldn’t have been standing still and defenceless when Potter’s hands reached for him again. And Draco certainly should
“Good.” Draco wondered whose cock Potter might’ve had his fist around. He decided to ask. “Who’ve you done that to before?”
“Well, I don’t think we were previously playing Aurors and Dark Wizards, but we… could. If… you’d like to.” The grin on Draco’s face faltered, then started to fall. “No pressure. I won’t push you to have sex.
“More like avoidance, I think. I hope he lets himself quit and go home soon. He needs a break.”
Shit.
okay to reply in the affirmative. “Magic… pppft,” he offered, aware that it was one of his typically undescriptive explanations of his sometimes-wayward power.
The room didn’t have any resemblance to the last time Draco was here. Instead of burning stacks and walls, Draco stepped into a bedroom. The room was subtly decorated in shades of cream and beige, an unimaginative but inoffensive choice of decor.
Draco lifted his chin. “No, you certainly cannot. But…” Draco sighed. "My family’s always been here. In Wiltshire. In this
Draco had essentially asked the equivalent of
Harry pointedly coughed.
“Oh, good. Not that I care what he says, but his criticism does tend to go on for a while. What did he do?” asked Malfoy as he came closer to stand in front of the bureau next to Harry.
“Fun though that sounds, it seems… a bit risky.” And mortifying.
Harry was starting to believe that.
“Like I said, I told her not to. Interfering doesn’t help. I don’t like it. But she can’t seem to help herself sometimes.”
Yet another nod.
Potter’s amazement was disturbingly endearing, and his beaming smile was crushingly handsome. “Then, we’re even.”

on me, but I couldn’t see who it was. The recordings stored by the surveillance spells within the Ministry building confirmed that it was Michael.”
“You’re sure that I didn’t…” Draco trailed off, expression betraying a different kind of distress.

Harry nodded yet again.
Draco looked affronted. “Whatever it is, it’s not
that caution, but he’d understood that it came from a place of concern. And, if he were completely honest with himself, he’d needed the space. Left to his own devices, Harry would’ve rushed forward regardless and likely have given himself another meltdown. Too many major things had happened in too short a period, and he hadn’t been coping with the changes very effectively. And hadn’t been dealing with
“I’m not exactly anxious to read anything which my father has deemed important enough to disturb my sleep,” Draco conceded, impatient to get past this pointless chatter and back to sleep. Or tonguing.
Feeling uncomfortably exposed by the abruptness, Harry gaped. He was very accustomed to being naked around Draco, but Draco usually took the time to undress him, or instruct Harry to disrobe. It was part of the experience, the build-up, even when Harry was submitting.
Harry’s incredulous look must have conveyed his thoughts, because Malfoy rose from his seat and extended a hand to help Harry stand up.
Harry was mulling over this fact when something hit the side of his head. Glancing down at his desk revealed the offending item to be a bound file of papers. Glancing back up revealed the likely culprit to be the smirking man he could see sitting at the desk in the adjacent office. Stupid interconnecting door; Harry should close it. But he made no move to do so.
“Did I miss a
And that was possibly also the reason why Hermione had been annoyed with him. Harry suddenly needed to
“Oh, god. That’s it. We need to move. Preferably to another country.”
His eyes narrowing, Draco answered, “Well, umm… it’s great that I’m holding your attention.”
Draco contemplated the statement but was perplexed. “I never pretend that I’m happy. And what good will that do either of us?”
Considering the ridiculousness of both his life and this conversation, Harry decided to take Malfoy’s word for it.
Potter took a step away, his back brushing against the drapes. “I don’t think so.”
“Don’t push it,” Harry growled without any real malice. “And the stationer… what was his name again?”
come before Draco. That wasn’t even an
“Well… okay.” Malfoy nodded. “If you’re sure that you want to.” It was Harry’s turn to nod. “No pressure to stick with it though, once you realise how boring it might be.”
“No? I do it every time you fuck me, Malfoy. Your sadistic alter ego demands it.”
Although, in this instance, a stray thought prompted Harry to hope that Draco also knew how long he could leave the pan sizzling on the hob before it would burn. Draco’s attentiveness didn’t often extend to cooking. Somehow, the sight of Harry preparing breakfast had inspired Draco to become interested in other, more carnal pursuits and Harry had eagerly allowed himself to become distracted from his task. Or rather, Harry had been ordered down to the floor by a rumbling growl in his ear, instructed to crawl to the far corner of the kitchen and wait until his services were required. Harry hadn’t felt compelled to argue.
“Oh, yes. I regard you very, very poorly, Potter. That’s why I’m cuddling you on your couch. Blatant contempt, really.”
automatically puts me in good standing. Gringotts owled to offer me a position a few weeks ago. Banking though… ugh. My father would’ve loved that. Not me.” Draco’s shoulders shuddered, reminding Harry just how different from his father Draco was. Not that Harry needed any convincing.
But during his plummet into conformity, he couldn’t prevent his detached analysis of Potter’s strange behaviour. And the more he looked, the more Draco had begun to notice other subtle changes in his sponsor which had occurred since they’d attended the school together before the war.

wanted, even though he’d hated it. He couldn’t face going back to it. That was all supposed to be behind him.
“And I know Ron’s glad that you’re willing to speak with him today,” said Molly with an encouraging maternal smile.
“For fucks sake,” Draco soon said, interrupting the staring competition before it could get properly underway. “What do you
“It’s… a pantry,” observed Harry.
The gleam in Draco’s eyes told Harry that he knew everything there was to report. Luna and those nargles had a lot to answer for.
A few days later, Harry found himself seated at a table in what must surely be the cheeriest, most garish bar in Wizarding Britain.
All physical contact immediately left Draco’s cock and a green gaze rose to meet him.
“It’ll be fine,” Ron said, eyes narrowed as he bent over to peer at one of the open boxes on the desk in front of him. “I haven’t seen one like this before.”
Draco treated Harry to the obligatory raised eyebrow. “Well, I’m not Mary Poppins.”
It hadn’t escaped Draco’s notice that the Gryffindors were as annoyed by this behaviour as he was. After a few unsettling weeks full of one-sided, Gryffindor attempts at conflict and many restless nights during which Draco had feared he may be murdered in his sleep, his living situation had calmed to its current status quo. No-one wanted to talk to Draco. Draco didn’t want to talk to anyone. Why Potter was determined to endanger this uneasy truce was a mystery.
The infraction didn’t appear to rile. “Hmm,” Malfoy hummed. “That was acceptable. I might even let you come.” Harry tried to convey his desire to do that in his appealing gaze. “Even you should be able to manage that. So, you'll come for me. Like this.” Malfoy emphasised his point by squeezing his fingers around Harry’s wrists. “I won’t wait long. I have better things to do.”
, Harry needed to
at the same time. Panting hard with every stroke of Malfoy’s penis over his prostate, Harry wanted Malfoy to wrap his fist around Harry’s throbbing cock and wank him roughly until he screamed, but Harry also wanted Malfoy to deny him that privilege.
“Shut up,” Harry mock-scolded, even though Draco hadn’t commented.
“Good. Thanks,” was all Harry was prepared to add to this subject today. But later. Definitely later. Draco had a

“Yes,” assured Harry with a nod. “But

Maybe it was time to lure Potter in with Draco’s nakedness.

, but Draco had easily succeeded in making him feel uncomfortable in it. Justice was wonderful.
Draco gave a damn still remained beyond him. Perhaps he would simply have to accept it as an unfortunate fact.
Draco didn’t speak. Didn’t move. It felt like Harry wasn’t the only one frozen in place within this precarious moment. The cock in Harry’s hand twitched, but Draco still didn’t utter any demands.
“Well… yes,” Harry answered. Trying to deny it wouldn’t be productive, he supposed. “That’s usually what happens now. Men tell me what needs improving and I try really hard to… improve it.”
“I’m quite safe. You look like you have it all under control.”

“I do,” Harry nodded. “I really,
Although Harry had suspected that he’d be reprimanded for making another noise, Malfoy didn’t acknowledge the infraction. Perhaps he was too busy.
Michael didn’t answer. Harry hadn’t expected him to and didn’t want to hear what he’d say anyway. But there was something Harry did need to know. A matter more important to Harry than Michael.
your father, right?”
“Yeah. Weasley’s Wizard… Whatsits. Can you believe that the owner tried to foist a pink Pygmy Puff with green spots onto me? I mean, have you ever heard of such a pointlessly preposterous thing?”
“He’ll always be Minister to me.” Peering around Luna, Hogswhistle spotted Harry standing further into the shop. When she licked her lips, Harry took that as his cue to flee into the safety of the back room to continue his stock check.
“Good. Stay there for a while.”
“What?” asked Harry. “What? Get to it!” He prompted, impatient with Malfoy’s abrupt muteness and lack of assertive action.
“That’s all you’re getting just now, Weasley.”
“No. There was another, but that one hacked me off. There was an unfortunate accident with turpentine.”
Frowning, Draco appeared to be considering Harry’s words.

“Just in case. I’m not planning leather restraints on a first try, but I won’t do this without one. I’ll need to know if you want me to stop." Then Malfoy grinned, which seemed out of place in that serious moment until he added, “I’ve read about that.”

Exasperated, Harry rolled his eyes and swallowed his next retort. Instead, he snuggled into Draco and aimed to steer the subject back to where it’d drifted from.
In… out… in… out… in… out… in…
It took Draco only seconds to reach Harry. His worried, questioning gaze rapidly examined Harry’s face, roamed down his body and fixed on Harry’s hands.
He wanted to go and fetch her, but he was afraid to leave this disaster unattended. And he wasn’t going to carry it into the shop where other people might be. He considered casting a spell at it but was worried that he’d make whatever he’d done worse.
Draco propped himself up on his elbows for a better look at this mumbling Potter. “Life
None of that made any difference though. It was merely Ministry propaganda. “But after I graduate -”
Draco was gaping at him in disbelief, exactly the way which Harry imagined he’d looked at Draco earlier.
“Good,” Draco replied a second before another wave and the same spell vanished every item of Harry’s clothing.

Ron glanced at Harry, then back to Draco, apparently deciding how to reply.
“Relax,” Malfoy commanded from below him. “Do what I tell you to. Stop thinking for yourself, it isn’t a whore’s place to question me.”
The urgency with which Harry’s request was immediately granted betrayed Draco’s true level of arousal; there was nothing calm or restrained about this kiss. Harry soon lost himself in what became an almost desperate need for intimacy. He wanted to be closer,
“I was down at the joke shop from Hell, so I thought I’d come get you before you got distracted with more wand stuff. I have use for you at home, Harry.”
“Nope.” Harry wasn’t sure if he felt more relieved than disappointed. “We’re going to take Weasley’s sage advice and relocate to the rug.” Draco’s grin was edging towards devious. “That way, I can inform him in detail later exactly how his suggestion played out.”
“Like what?”

Feeling emboldened and spurred on by the needs of his neglected cock, Harry tried to move events along. “Please. I need you to fuck me.”
“Mr Malfoy,” he greeted, trying for polite civility.
obvious. You, on the other hand tend to be a people-pleasing wildcard. I used to think it was peculiar, but I get it now.”
“I hope so. Umm… do you realise that Ron’s probably told everyone in the Tower that we’ve been sharing a bed?” Potter asked, effectively changing the subject.
The incredulous expression on Malfoy’s face was almost amusing. If Harry didn’t feel so much like crying.
after Harry topped. All his partners had done the same. He hadn’t experienced anything else. Harry hadn’t ever personally felt the need to critique anyone following sex, but he understood that people felt it was required with him. Harry did think he’d become skilled through necessity, but there were always a few elements he didn’t get exactly right. Always room for improvement. It was just one of those things.
“I won’t have my whore frowning down at me.” Harry attempted to smooth his concerned features into something more amiable. When Malfoy tutted, he suspected that he hadn’t managed it. “Lift up, move forward a bit.” Harry complied the best he could, adjusting his knees to maintain his balance on the springy mattress. “Come on, at least try to be less useless. That’s it, there,” announced Malfoy when his erection briefly prodded at the correct spot between Harry’s arse cheeks.
“Actually, I think he already knew the answer. But he likes to keep information to himself until it benefits him. Hence the attempt at a deal. Although that was pitiful for him. Maybe the magic’s wearing off the paint or something.”
When Draco turned his head to look at Harry, his eyes were wide and watery. Draco nodded in the direction of the frame.
“I think,” Harry sighed, “that’s enough talking about this for now.”
Harry sighed. He would. In fact, he’d really like not to go into the office at all. Perhaps ever again. But instead of voicing those thoughts, he asked, “Are you hoping that the Ministry might push me out of office for neglect of duty, Malfoy?”
get some well-deserved rest, but when Potter liberated himself from the blanket, followed him to stand and turned, vulnerably naked and wearing a sated smile, Draco knew he didn’t stand a chance of ejecting him. Some battles weren’t worth fighting.
Fuck. Harry shouldn’t have called her in here, but he just hadn’t known what to
Ron was still wearing his Auror uniform, as if he’d just come from work. Harry’s first instinct was shame. So weak, so useless.

from unnecessary details, Draco.”
Harry didn’t bother to get off the bed. He unfastened his jeans and quickly rid himself of all lower garments which he kicked in a heap onto the floor. Draco was proceeding with his own undressing in a more leisurely manner. Keen to get hastily beyond this point, Harry yanked his t-shirt over his head and threw it in Draco’s direction.

it, made Harry feel fulfilled, even if he couldn’t comprehend exactly why.
Draco had. It was pointless to deny it. “I didn’t think it was essential that I stay afterwards.”
“Good,” Harry said, exhaling in relief.
“Fine,” Draco drawled as he settled himself beside Potter on the edge of the bed. “You’re right… it’s none of my concern if you’ve been polishing the Weasel’s shaft or buggering him into any available surface for years.” Potter made a peculiar choking sound. It’d been a throwaway comment to rile his opponent, but Potter’s reaction prompted Draco to ask, “
“Why did you leave?”
, Draco. That’s all. And I was
And worse, Potter had taken to sitting beside Draco in the common room. Draco would always be seated alone, but Potter would saunter in and settle in the space beside him. It didn’t matter if Draco was on a single chair, Potter would then arrange himself on a spot on the carpet nearby. Which was where Potter could currently be found. Why Potter’s friends were not hastily dragging him back into the security of the pack was quite beyond Draco’s understanding.
of it, it was still the middle of the night. There was plenty of moonlight to appreciate all the attractive intricacies of the man next to him though.
safe. It’s not like you were doing anything wrong. You weren’t
“Do you think he’s all right?” Harry asked. “Winklepick, I mean?”
Keen though Harry was to leave, the available exit processes of walking out of the Manor or using the Floo didn’t have their usual appeal. He supposed he could conjure something to make do but wasn’t sure what he’d end up with or if he’d trust them not to disappear at an inopportune moment. And the few items left in the building were not meant to be transfigured.
Shaking his head, Harry took a step back, folded his arms over his chest and contemplated the use of a silencing charm. Harry would’ve felt much more sympathetic if he hadn’t repeatedly warned Ron about touching

“And is what you need any of my concern?”
“I’m just concerned for my personal welfare.”
“In my flat. Not that I’ve been spending much time there with them lately.”
“Yeah… it was slightly awkward. How about in the second drawing room with the boggart?”
Once he was within the dormitory, Draco arranged himself on the centre of his bed, contemplating whether clothing would be a wise option. And if Potter was bright enough to take the bait. Closing his eyes, he elected to remain clothed and protect Potter’s delicate sensibilities. For now.
“I don’t know… you’ve seemed, weird this morning. And then that thing with Wood. Weird, again. The man can’t take a hint to shove off.”

After a pause, Potter answered, “Okay, I guess. And you?”
“But -”
, so there’d be fewer complaints. He really didn’t know how else to top. But maybe he could utilise the same principal here and gain something for himself as well. Harry wanted to learn what Draco liked, because he wanted to give him enjoyment, not just get through the experience as expediently as possible.
With his hands out of productive action, there was nothing Harry could do about the issue as he recommenced his task. He moved, watched and prayed.
Harry’s breath was starting to stutter as it became harder to pull in air. Quickly, he opened his eyes and reminded himself who he was with. He was safe here… but maybe it would be
that we’ve chatted about for the last few years. What
“Oh… bloody… hell… that’s…
Draco came back into Harry’s full field of vision as he bent to briefly stroke his hand tenderly over Harry’s hair before he straightened and stepped back with a low chuckle.
“I didn’t know what it all was, either,” Draco said.
Draco noted that Potter hadn’t corrected the statement about his virginity and inwardly staggered for a second with the realisation that despite being the most eligible bachelor in Wizarding Britain, Potter couldn’t manage to achieve the basic task of getting laid. It’d likely be wise not to mention that though. Or to sound too keen. “I don’t know… maybe. Unless you have delusions of becoming a top.”
“Do you know the answer to this already, Draco?” He’d been lured into that trap before, confirming facts which it turned out that Draco had already been aware of, just because Draco wanted to know if Harry could wandlessly and quickly detect some magical aspect that it’d taken Draco ages to work out with a wand and an army of books.
“I know you can, but I don’t want you to. Did you see the look on his face? That was

“You will
“Are you
Harry was abandoned beside the worktable without a clue why Luna had considered his complete guess to be ‘good’ or whether he was now expected to take some sort of action. Placing the piece of wood and handkerchief carefully back onto the table, he decided that it’d be a safer bet to go home to Draco.
“Is it… acceptable?” Harry asked.
They had existed together in silence during a timescale indefinable to Harry before Malfoy’s hands left him. But they didn’t leave for long. Harry’s wrists were yanked from the desk and tugged behind his back, pulling at his shoulders as they were brought together and held in what felt like one hand. Malfoy used the other to prise the scroll from where it had still been crushed within Harry’s grasp. From his limited vantage point, Harry couldn’t see what happened to it. At the reminder of the contract, Harry’s heartrate spiked with a renewed wave of anxiety and he tried to twist his torso, but strong fingers dug again into his neck to refuse the movement, his wrists were pushed down into his back and the wave ebbed away.

Draco didn’t really see why he should give a shit. So, he didn’t.
And with his brow furrowed as he gasped in air, Potter looked like he was conducting his own internal battle.

As if Draco didn’t have enough to be anxious about, now he was also worried about

loyalty wasn’t the purpose of the exercise. It was about the… transference of ownership. My father willingly giving the last thing he had to offer to the Dark Lord.”
“I’ll be careful,” Potter promised, discarding the blanket to the end of the mattress and arranging his lean form to lie further down the bed as Draco’s hips raised briefly to allow his clothing to be pushed down further.
want to be free of the restrictive denim, so maybe he was overthinking it. Draco made no move to undress him any further. Standing in his t-shirt, briefs and socks, Harry fidgeted awkwardly. During this new interaction, Harry was concerned that the remaining attire might appear too juvenile. But his nervous fidgeting bobbed his erection within the looser cotton briefs, reminding him that he was definitely a grown man.
Having his groin exposed for Potter’s close scrutiny was thrilling, but the notion of doing this without protection from prying ears made Draco feel nervous. “
I'm hoping you know that as well. I also hope you know that you can trust me. I’m… going to stop rambling now.” Malfoy looked at him expectantly. Hopefully, maybe.

But Harry tried to put that out of his mind for the moment. Talking with Molly and Arthur around their worn table, Harry felt like he’d never been away. The only difference was the man now sitting by his side. Who appeared to be as taken by their friendliness as Harry was.
There was an alarming gap in the drapes around the bed, and a very red and astonished Weasley stood where thick fabric should’ve been.
“Yes, I can be a good whore for you.”
Butter was nudged in Draco’s direction, surprisingly from the helpful hand of Granger.
“Ah, yes. Shame, that.” Draco’s fingers briefly thrust again within the snug hole, causing Harry to groan softly before the digits left Harry’s body and Draco extracted his hand back into the open.
“Right,” said Harry. “Good. Umm… I’d prefer if you didn’t tell him any of it in the future though. It’s
The corridor was well-lit, but still somehow seemed gloomy. All that dark wood, Harry surmised as he walked along the plush carpet, viewing a seemingly endless amount of paintings on the walls, some of which were watching Harry with interest. The lines of neatly hanging frames were occasionally interspersed with wall-mounted sculptures that Malfoy had described as “meaningless hunks of brass and gold”. What Harry had seen so far of the interior reminded him of a museum; look, but do not touch.
Remembering the stressful events at the Manor on Saturday, Harry lightly stroked the fur, earning him an adorable squeak.
Draco moved a hand to Harry’s face, index finger clearly trying to smooth out the crease between Harry’s eyebrows
Harry closed his eyes to retreat from that anger, unsure if it was directed at him. “I shouldn't have quit. It
Harry could hear the pitch of Draco’s breathing change as Draco came close to winning. And Harry thought he wasn’t far in front of the race. Or behind, who cared.
bothered. Most of Harry’s short relationships had simply fizzled out with stifled disappointment, but Oliver had been extremely vocal about his opinion.
Malfoy went silent for a long moment before realisation appeared to dawn.
Harry was fucking terrified. But he was also shaking with lust and love and a desire to be connected to Draco in this new way. To
“Kneel over here, facing me. Keep your hands where they are,” Malfoy shortly ordered. Harry moved to comply, turning his head to see where he was being directed to. “Faster, Potter.”
Harry didn’t know much of this movement was due to the charm Draco had cast and how much was a feature of the product. But if didn’t really matter, Harry needed to cope with it either way.
“If you want to.”
“Umm… turns out that a member of the Wizengamot disabled the alarm years ago. Something about infringements of workers’ privacy. And I’m guessing that Michael knew that, or he wouldn’t have risked it. But… apparently, they couldn’t figure out how to disable the rest of your spells, so the information was still being collected, even though we weren’t being alerted to it.” Ron grinned, as if he were satisfied or amused by the strength of Harry’s magic against the Wizengamot’s interference. Maybe he was both.
“I’m sorry,” Draco repeated again.
Harry wondered if it was a bad thing that he was still viewing this act as a technical process. He supposed he’d developed the attitude over the years as a defence mechanism. Or a coping strategy, perhaps. Whatever the difference was. But the intended outcome had always been the same: get it done. And do it
Potter didn’t move. “Want to what?”
Harry watched as Malfoy released his grip on the chair, shoved it aside and straightened to his full height, shoulders shifting back and chin lifting as he no doubt prepared to take a stand against Harry’s fury. Harry was also aware of what
Malfoy leaned across the back of his chair slightly, mouth curving in what he might’ve hoped was a placating smile. It didn’t placate Harry. “We need to have a chat about this, Ha – Potter. We could -”
“Yes,” Draco nodded. “I do.”

“Hello, Harry. The perfect person to solve this.”
“We’re
Potter frowned and fidgeted. “Then why did you stop me?”
It was okay to ask… for… help.
A few hours later, Potter rose to Draco’s challenge. Sitting in silence together during the tedious torture which was listening to the new Transfiguration teacher drone on about theory, a small note was inconspicuously and wandlessly slid from Potter’s side of their shared desk to stop in front of Draco.
Harry was finished with him.
Potter was bluffing, that had to be it. It wasn’t possible to be as inexperienced as Potter had previously portrayed and provide that performance. But that was fine, Draco’s bluffing skills were surpassed by none.
The process of appointing the new Head of MLE had to be ending soon. Ron clearly believed that Harry’s approval could help to push Michael into position. But the Ministry was furious with Harry, so his approval would most certainly
“Nothing is without risk, Potter. And you know that I could persuade you. All I’d need to use is a particular tone of voice and you’d be longing to please me.”
name which no-one in Britain is going to want to be associated with. No money. No assets of my own. No friends to assist me. No lovely house to retreat to and live a peaceful, beautiful life. Nowhere. To. Go,” he repeated, hoping that Potter’s useless excuse for a brain could grasp the concept.
!” Ron’s voice bellowed from downstairs.
Malfoy permitted him a little while of basking quiet before he asked, “Did you enjoy pleasing me?”
“I do like him. He’s fun. But… we’re not,” Harry’s voice reduced to a mumble as he continued, “compatible.”
“Harry isn’t Minister anymore,” informed Luna.
Examining the scroll within his grasp, Potter nodded, swished his wand, and restored their previous privacy. “Uhuh.”
Blinking upwards, Harry was startled that Draco was standing right in front of him. Harry hadn’t noticed him leave the bed.
“Not for a second. Well, not after you accidentally snapped my mum’s broom in half. I figured that I was onto a winner after that. I see you’ve bought her a nice one to replace it.”
Harry’s first thought was
“You’re joking, right? Did it not
That was intriguing. And apparently Harry should
“Is there a problem?” queried Draco, dragging a rack of toast closer.
Resigned both to losing the fun of his morning frottage toy as it woke up and being obliged to read the contents of what he was sure would be a letter from Molly, Harry slowly detached himself from Draco and padded towards the noise.
“What should we do?” Luna asked, gesturing to the materials.
Harry stared in horror as the smoke wove a few inches from the tip, then inexplicably reversed its direction and began to curve around the length of wood in an elegant, tight downwards spiral. Like a lazily slow whirlwind moving towards his hand.
Harry shook his head. “There’s nothing here that I want.”
It was Harry’s turn to blush.
, that he shuddered in panic and swung his gaze up and away from the light.
He didn’t know what kind of wood this was, but it also felt oddly watery under Harry’s fingers.
Potter’s smile was resigned and lacking in mirth. “And what would you know about loyalty?”
As if shaking herself out of a daze, Luna turned her head to blink her magnified eyes at Harry.
Harry pondered the question. He wasn’t usually demanding. But he’d asked for something earlier and had
With a start, Harry only realised that he had been staring at the blurriness of the moonlit ceiling in blank shock when Draco curled in beside him and laid his head on Harry’s chest. That was too much for Harry; rolling carefully over to his right, he gently readjusted them both until Draco was lying on his back with Harry’s head on
“I will be expecting the very best wand care, Potter.”
“Not helping,” Harry gulped.

Harry obediently lowered himself to the directed spot. He felt exposed and awkward and incredibly aroused. He didn’t know what to do with his hands, so he rested them on his thighs, palms down, stared at the carpet and waited.
He wondered why
The scones had sounded nice though. Maybe he needed to speak to Draco about the lack of available home-baked goods to snack on immediately after sex. Or actually, as Harry had understood it,
“Financial and employment difficulties do hurt, but I feel that a more… permanent solution would ensure your continued safety.” A bad feeling was growing in Harry’s belly. “We’ve found some intriguing things in the Manor, haven’t we? Within one room in particular?”
“There’s no point.” Potter shrugged again.
With abrupt resolve, Harry made the decision for them. Aiming for greatest efficiency within this precarious situation, Harry let his legs drop and planted the soles of his feet into the deep pile before he spoke loud and clear.
“Look at it.” Harry looked up. Malfoy’s trousers were tented outwards towards him, tantalisingly close to Harry’s mouth. He licked his lips as he anticipated the treat that he knew was hidden beneath the cloth. “Do you think you deserve the right to touch me? To

“You used to be Minister for Magic, Harry. I think you know more than a ‘little bit’.”

Two more requests from Hermione for them all to go out together had been declined by Harry. He was curious about how her persistence was being received by Ron. Harry couldn’t imagine that Ron would want to see
This slowly gathering pleasure was a splendid experience. Harry was used to his arousal building through deliberately stimulating words, gestures or actions which required him to gather the willpower to stamp it back before it crested. And Harry adored the challenge of that. But

“Get your mind out of the filthy gutter, and get
Potter’s tongue suddenly slid up the underside of Draco’s shaft, taking time to explore the entire length. Draco hastily bit down to stifle a moan, but he wasn’t very successful.
“You don’t need to do this, you know,” Malfoy reminded him.
Panicking, Harry froze. He flicked his gaze to Malfoy’s. Grey eyes were slitted in anger. Shit, shit, damn and shit.
Harry tightened his grip, fixed his gaze on the wall in front of him and got on with it. Looking at Malfoy’s derisive sneer would not keep Harry’s orgasm at bay. And after the first few repetitions of the required manoeuvre, the predicable difficulty set in. Harry had been demanded to fuck himself on Malfoy’s cock with a movement he was sure had been designed with particular care to consistently stroke against Harry’s prostate if he did it correctly. Naturally, Harry would endeavour with all his being to do it correctly. This was sadism at its very worst. Or best. Harry was in control, but at the same time, he
Suddenly, Malfoy’s hands were on both of Harry’s hips, moving Harry down before he was ready and pulling an alarmed squeal from his mouth as Malfoy’s cock began to breach his arsehole. But the push, the
Potter claimed Draco’s wand again, cast cleaning charms over both of them, then replaced the wand on the nightstand.
“Actually, yes.” Draco looked sceptical, so Harry continued, “Just restless. Maybe I’m nervous about this thing with Ron and Hermione tomorrow. Feels like a double date or something.”
Harry supposed not.

Draco rocked his hips again and Harry automatically responded with a roll of his own. Just one though. Harry was so

Out of time. Harry sighed and reluctantly parted their mouths, trying to remember why he’d so badly wanted all the Weasleys returned to his life.
“I’m not going anywhere since you keep giving me more reasons to stick around. And now… I’m going to approach this subject extremely carefully… lest you think it’s in any way coercive or expected.” A knot of worry started to twist in Harry’s chest. “But I’d be amenable to doing that again, on occasion.”
for anything that might complicate or prevent your resignation. This whole section,” he pointed to the fateful part of the contract that had been so patronisingly highlighted to Harry by the Wizengamot that morning, “didn’t exist.”

only been last week.
Without relinquishing his position, Draco grappled blindly to locate his wand, hoping that it wasn’t already too late. His incantation was slightly marred by another moan as Potter’s hand took hold of his cock again, but the magic should be good enough. An impenetrable barrier charm would also be a wise addition, but that was beyond Draco’s current ability.
He heard a window behind him shatter.
Fuck, those tears were still falling. Harry wanted to erase them, heal the hurt. He brought his hand back to Draco’s cheek and gently wiped a trail of moisture away.
“Yes, and sometimes I think it’s a ruddy good job that we both understand the difference,” chortled Draco.
“Well deduced,” Draco smirked, keeping his gaze locked on the item tied to the owl’s foot by a length of black ribbon. Although reluctant to accept the proffered scroll, Draco knew better than to refuse. His father’s owl was not above pecking out an eye.
Another wave from Harry, but this one was followed by silence. Harry knew the charm was gone though.
“Potter, are you… under the impression that you’re my boyfriend now?” he rushed out the end of the sentence in a whoosh of unsteady breath, mortified to even be asking.
He looked glumly down at the letter in his hands as he heard Draco stir behind him.
Harry thought he could hear that hand stroking not-quite lubricated flesh, but a displeased tut came from Malfoy and Harry realised what he’d missed. Something that was always expected within their roles.
.” Chuckling, Harry nodded and allowed Draco to arrange them how they’d previously been on the bed, Harry’s head on Draco’s chest. “So, Luna tells me that I should ask you how your day went. Not that I wouldn’t have asked anyway.”
“The Dark Lord didn’t care about whether I wanted it. Neither of them did.

feel obligated to stand in Draco’s way.
Harry rolled his eyes before bestowing the portrait with his own wave. Draco wasn’t so skilled at pretending that Harry couldn’t see through the cracks in his defences. But Harry was hardly one to judge about having defences.
“This doesn’t need to be difficult, Potter. It can be the simplest thing in the world.”
They reappeared in the bedroom a few seconds later, Harry having decided that it would be the handiest site for locating him some clothes. He stepped away from Draco and headed towards the wardrobe. After he’d swung open the doors, Harry considered that this storage was simply not big enough for the both of them. He could magically expand the space, but he didn’t want to fiddle with it. Maybe they could get a second one.
Oliver looked a bit panicked by Harry’s imminent departure. “But -”
“I’ll… try,” was the most honest answer Harry could give.
be. It can be the
Potter sucked in his bottom lip, and Draco mourned his beautiful plan. Draco’s own lips were still too wet from the kiss to think clearly, and Potter’s alarmingly appealing rumpledness wasn’t helping to alleviate Draco’s confusion. Torn between the urge to pick up from where he’d stopped them and the impulse to scream in frustration, Draco managed to reason that the sensible option would be to leave. Or at least shag Potter into the mattress and
He’d agreed to attend Hogwarts for one reason only, because his only alternative was to remain at the Manor. A third option didn’t exist. He couldn’t bear to live in the Manor anymore; it was tainted beyond repair. His mother had asked him to stay home, ostensibly for his own protection, but she’d also made her priorities clear. And those priorities were not Draco.
Harry’s latest meltdown was forcing Malfoy to kneel on the floor again. Knowing how much Malfoy valued his pristine clothing, Harry’s guilt spiked.
Harry was breathing through arousal rather than anxiety by the time Draco eventually spoke again. “Or if you’re too… nervous, then I could get on with it myself while you go cook us some dinner. I might be hungry after.”
“Harry…” Draco yawned again. “…it’s not much of a punishment when you’re so eager.”
Boggart Draco had something to tell Harry: that he didn’t love him. That he’d

“Lots of people. And none of them are us.”
That was an excellent point. “Well… yeah. But I have meetings today.” There were always meetings. It was never-ending.

stupid, he reconsidered as Draco perched on the edge of the bed behind him. Harry could just see Draco’s hand in his peripheral vision, and it seemed that he was getting ready to make a productive move. This was confirmed when Harry felt cool, wet, smooth glass prodding at his arsehole. Draco hadn’t prepared Harry nearly as well as the toy, but the edge of pain only served to make the push inside him more delicious.
“Wouldn’t that get it even more dirty?”
This had been a

there.
“No odder than getting no mail at all,” Draco deflected.
“- wrong? Harry?”
but as Draco breathed into his ear, “I want to fuck you,” Harry realised his attempt at offering comfort had escalated in what felt like the blink of an eye into something which he hadn’t intended.
“It’s not that easy.”
“I can hear you thinking again.”
“That’s not why it isn’t here. Your blood family was already gone. Like you’ve said so many times… this was all just material
Harry hesitated. He hadn’t quite managed to shake off his guilt yet.
After Malfoy’s breathing had steadied, Harry moaned when the softening cock was slowly pulled from his anus.
“Do you not want to?” asked Draco.
And that was one of Harry’s worst fears. He’d been worried about the same prospect with Draco before the first time they’d had sex.
But he seemed ready now, so Harry ventured, “You only signed the paperwork on the estate this morning, Draco. There’s no rush.”

“That’s more than fine. You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to. Neither of us do. We shall be two sexual beings, living in each moment, interested purely in pleasing our own special brand of spontaneous carnal lust.”
At the latter statement, Harry raised his eyebrows.
“Yes, you can,” Harry quietly agreed.
“Hmm… maybe the rug? Looks nice and soft. If comfort is what you’re looking for, anyway.”
Anger reflected in his silver eyes, hard and cold as steel. He wanted nothing more than to destroy that futile facade of a boy Harper. No one was allowed to undermine a Malfoy!
"Salazar! It's nine o'clock! Potter, wake up!" Draco flung his bed curtains open.
Slowly but surely, Draco maneuvered their bodies so that he was now laid on top of Potter. The act caused Potter to kiss him aggressively. A hand was grabbing at Draco's hair hard. Another hand ran from his neck down to his back and stroking Draco's spine. And when the hand arrived on his lower back, it pressed hard, and both boys moaned at the sensation of Draco's hips pressed to Potter's thighs and his stomach to Potter's pelvis.
"Yeah, 'cause he doubted everyone would be able to see them. Hagrid showed it to the Fifth year class last Tuesday. Though, turned out there weren't any who were able to see them. They are Thestrals. Only they who have witnessed death are able to see them," Potter explained.
Draco was awakened by the sharp pain that stressed his left forearm. He rose and rolled the sleeve of his silk pyjama up, and saw the skin beneath what was left of the Dark Mark was red as if it were burnt. It was worse than yesterday. Even the scar was so reddened that it looked about to pop out from the skin. He bolted toward the bathroom and immediately ran cold water over his burnt forearm.
Potter knocked on the door. A moment later it opened itself and the both of them stepped inside. They saw no one there.
Potter walked to the center of the clearing where the largest Thestral stood high.
"Potter, what happened to my scarf?" Draco narrowed his eyes and looked at Potter.
"Tempus," Draco whispered. He smiled at the conjured time. He wiped his smile from his face as he thought about how to explain this to his parents. "Ah! Of course." Draco tsk-ed. His parents didn't know that his Hawthorn wand was broken. So all he had to say when he returned his mother's wand was that Potter gave it back to him. Yeah, as simple as that would do.
"Malfoy? Are you all right?" Potter knelt down in front of him and held his right arm.
Draco swung his mother's wand and heard Potter moan.
"Suit yourself, Potter. I'm going to take a shower." Draco then left the boy to have his shower. When he was finished and returned to the bedroom, he offered Potter to use his bathroom.
"What do I do now?" Lifting the trunk was impossible. Should he call Hagrid then? A long and loud whine from the beast informed Draco that the pain must be unbearable. Confused and not knowing what to do, he jumped over the big trunk and positioned himself beside the wounded beast and started to lift up the trunk. It didn't move a millimeter. He straightened his body, put down his bag, rolled his sleeves to the elbows – because he wouldn't risk his white shirt getting dirty – and tried again.
"Y-yeah…" Draco stood up from the bed. "Uh, I'm tired. I think I'm going to bed now."
"Fine." Draco released his grip on Potter. "So, what were you two talking about today? She- she didn't do anything to you, did she?"
A-ha! Now is a good time to confront the dark haired boy, Draco thought. So when he noticed Potter's hand was trying to reach the door handle, Draco corrected his posture and stepped to the spot before Potter, blocking him from the exit.
"Anyway where did you get this box? I didn't know there were any in Diagon Alley." Potter bowed his head, studying the Delight on his lap. Draco suspected the boy's face had gone red.
"Well, sit down, Potter." Draco pointed to the empty air before him with his chin.
"I can't fix it now." Potter gave him an apologetic look.
"Right then, let's call it a night. I better go back to my room. See you, er, tomorrow?" Potter rose from the bed.
"And my parents will notice I don't take meals in the Great Hall too often. Bad news. They can order our house elf to not provide me food again." Draco pulled out a plate of sandwiches.
"Hit how? When?" Draco was really starting to see red now.
Draco stepped forward and gathered Potter against him. He held him tight, so as not to let him run. Draco would keep holding the boy, until he had calmed down and the tears had stopped falling.
"Potter, that sounds suspiciously like you'll involve something unavailable in Hogwarts." Draco saw a little shock in Potter's eyes. "Fine. I'll wait for Saturday. Until then, guess I'll have to watch my back."
"Warm?" Draco had nonverbally casted a warming charm to Potter.
Draco could feel the tense in Potter's hand. Whether because he was afraid Draco would be angry and would deny his relationship with him, or because he was scared that his friends wouldn't approve of them, he wasn't sure. Draco decided to relieve Potter from his fears by asking Granger and Weasel about it. Not that he needed their approval.
Potter lay on his side with his back facing Draco. Draco walked toward the sleeping boy, attempting to intrude in his mind again, wanting to dig up other memories. Suddenly he wanted to know everything about the boy. But seeing sweat pouring off Potter's forehead, he cut short on the
"Unicorn…blood?" Potter narrowed his eyes.
Draco reached out, grabbed the cupboard knob and spun it. It was locked.
On the way to Wiltshire, where Malfoy Manor was, Draco's mind was split between his parents and Potter. The manor's ward was strong enough that it hadn't been cracked by the Dark Lord in the past. So there was a sure guarantee that his parents would be safe in the manor. But Potter, Draco didn't know what to think about this boy. What was his intention in coming to help him? Another hero-complex act? Another show off to the Wizarding World? Or was he trying to prove that he was still needed? What was it?
Potter studied his face. And then he sighed.
"Malfoy what is it? Are you all right? Malfoy?" Potter was suddenly by his side. His confused and worried face checked Draco from head to toe. Draco kept writhing in pain. His hand holding tightly his left wrist, tears spilling from the corners of his eyes. This time the pain on his arm increased tenfold. "Your arm? What's wrong with it?" Potter took Draco's left arm. He forcefully rolled up Draco's left sleeve and gasped as he saw what was beneath the silky pajama. The color of the Death Mark's scar on Draco's forearm was glaring an angry crimson.
The blond gasped. Once again the scent of spring and fallen rain filled his lungs, the scent he recognised now as the scent of Potter's magic. Gravel on the ground and bushes and leaves rattled wildly, manifestations of the visual magic swirling around Potter. When Draco made a soft noise, the dark-haired boy turned around. His eyes were red, and his expression was one of pure anger.
So the days went by and they never mentioned anything about that conversation again.
Draco didn't answer Potter's first question with words. Instead, he tried to sum up his understanding and his concern within the look that he gave the Gryffindor. Maybe, just maybe, Draco thought, Potter took it as a look of pity, for the boy drew back and tensed. Acting on instinct, Draco reached forward and grabbed Potter's wrist, holding it tight. They spent a few minutes in a stare contest before Potter's face finally softened, and Draco stroked the boy's inner wrist soothingly with his thumb. Draco could see a smile start to form on Potter's lips, when someone interrupted them.
"There's still plenty of warm water there, Potter, if you want to take shower."
"Yes, like that. Relax. Keep your happy memories on your mind… Now, pick one memory and cast the spell." Potter took his hands away from Draco's shoulders. Draco once again moved his wand and casted the spell. Nothing appeared.
"Oh this is ridiculous! I'm calling Hagrid!" Draco reached for his bag on the ground and he startled by a weak cry as he was about to walk away.
They arrived in the forest in a clearing where a group of Hogwarts' magical creatures were lying around. Draco gasped when he saw the beasts. They were the same as the one Draco had met the day he'd saved the Unicorn. That creepy skeletal horse-like beast.
He walked out the green house with the rest of the seventh and eighth years. He rushed down the corridor, passing other students on the way.
Dinner at the Great Hall was as usual – noisy, owls flying in and out delivering letters and packages to their owners. That night Draco saw Potter take a seat at the Ravenclaw table beside Luna Lovegood. Draco himself sat near Millicent, trying to dig information about "interesting" events at Hogsmeade; specifically about the Potter-and-Weaselette incident. It turned out that the Weaselette had caught on that Potter was wearing a scarf that wasn't his nor his friends'. The Weaselette had pulled it off of Potter and smelt foreign fragrances from it. She'd asked Potter whose scarf was it but instead of giving her an answer, Potter had asked her to give it back to him. Suspecting it was from another girl, the Weaselette threw it to the ground and then stomped on it hard. Potter got mad and grabbed the sca-
"You're good at transfiguration." Potter said suddenly.
"Loved to have you inside me, but I need to visit your bathroom." Harry broke the literally-breathtaking kiss, but his arms still wrapped around Draco's neck.
"Potter!" Draco demanded, turning angrily on the other boy.
"Git." Harry bit Draco's neck. Draco chuckled and massaged Harry's scalp.
"What happened actually, Malfoy?" Potter was staring at Draco's arm. They were now sat on Draco's bed facing each other.
"Did you see anything else?" Potter asked, paling visibly.
Draco was stunned.
Draco's jaw opened. Potter chuckled. Soon the chuckle turned into a merry laugh.
With his new reputation as the Dark Lord's apprentice, plus a Thestral – known as omens of evil –, taking a liking to him, the whole body of students in Hogwarts were now even surer that Draco was a dark wizard. Great.
"And your bearing is?"
"Just, let me try, Potter. Please." Draco stared at Potter's emerald eyes. A Malfoy never said please and Potter knew it. He hoped Potter could see his desperation and would give him a chance to try it.
"I believe the Minister has sent you his words about it." Draco lifted his chin. He didn't want to explain it all again to the headmistress.
"Suit yourself." Draco smirked knowingly.
"What's wrong with the one you have?"
!" Potter shouted angrily. He clenched his fists and stared sharply at Draco. Granger and Weasel gave the boy questioning looks, and Draco saw the Weaselette throw Potter a disapproving glare. Whether Potter saw and noticed them or not, his eyes were locked on Draco. Even when Granger approached him and pulled his sleeve, Potter gave her no heed.
"Harry, what is your plan now? I applied a proposal to Minius Vimescafee to assist me in advance potions training and he approved it. I can start immediately; he owled me," Draco asked once they were lying on Draco's bed, wearing out their exhaust system of the previous intense activity at the cottage.
Draco wanted to go back to his room and read his mother's letter straight after dinner that night. But he sensed Potter was holding out dinnertime until all his Gryffindor friends were gone, so he stayed with him.
"What? You expected me to get hurt? Potter, I'm not that weak." Draco said dryly.
when he went out of the common room for breakfast!"
"Croque Monsieur." Draco frowned. He wondered why the house elf had given him two slices of those messy sandwiches.
Prince, Potter," Draco snapped, emphasizing the word 'ice' as he narrowed his eyes. "I have no interest in any form of romantic acts or relationships. I'm a pure blood, a Malfoy. We don't play around. We don't kiss and sleep around before marriage. Merlin knows what they want from me, a Malfoy; prime status and good fortune." Even just thinking about touching someone made Draco want to empty his stomach.
Draco spun timidly to the other boy. They blinked a few times in unison.
"What, Potter! Don't try and stop me. I don't care if you tell McGonagall, I'm still leaving. The ex-Death Eaters are probably on their way to the manor right now. So go away and let me leave. Go, Tenebrus!" Draco cried.
Draco gave the dark-haired boy a suspicious look. A sudden realization hit him.
It was a deafening silence.
"Harry," Weaselette greeted Potter.
"Very well, young men, I'll leave you to Professor Dumbledore. I'll be upstairs when you're done." And McGonagall left them.
"See. Told you." Potter raised his head to see Draco. "Sorry."
"Merlin! How did this happen?"
"Ah, Mr. Malfoy. I believe you came to consult about the recent issue. Come up. Scottish Fold," the headmistress told the gargoyle and the spiral staircase toward her office arose.
They spent another few seconds blinking stupidly at each other. Then Potter's face lit up, and he cupped Draco's face and brought it down against his own and claimed Draco's lips in a quick hard press.
"Malfoy?"
"Malfoy, will you please open the door?" Granger called again.
. Ah, whatever, Draco thought. He'd finally managed to conjure a cloudy silver light anyway, which was much better than all the students in class the previous Friday who were only able to produce silvery strings. Minus some ex-members of the silly Dumbledore's Army, of course.
There was nothing Draco couldn't handle that day. Most of the students were keeping their distance with him when he walked along the hallways and corridors. Only a few stupid mockeries from some sixth and seventh years, and a tripping jinx from Harper before Transfiguration. Draco managed to block his hex nonverbally and looked at the seventh year Slytherin in contempt. A sentence from Potter after that brought a little mood to Draco.
"Malfoy, I can—," Potter paused and cast a silencing bubble around them. "I can fix your mother's wand." Potter blurted out.
"Quidditch!" Ah, yes, Draco had always loved Quidditch. He could fly high and free without having to fear his father's enemies, Death Eaters, and wards. Draco closed his eyes, concentrating on a time when he'd flown high and free above the Quidditch pitch in Hogwarts. Flying as he chased the Snitch, racing with Potter, then smirking at Potter, teasing him so that the boy would lose his concentration over the golden ball. Unconsciously Draco smiled at his memories. And then Draco opened his eyes and started to cast the incantation.
"You are going to Hogsmeade tomorrow?" Draco asked while lying on his bed.
"Oh, Draco. It's nothing. We were just chatting. He's a nice young man and very entertaining. Come visit us again this summer, Potter. I enjoyed your company." Narcissa smiled at Potter, and, once again stomped on her husband's foot when Lucius attempted to disapprove.
"M-Malfoy.." Potter looked surprised and his body became rigid.
"Is that a map?" Draco peered into the parchment. "Merlin, it's a map of Hogwarts! And what are those moving labels?" Draco leant closer.
"Well then maybe I should marry you." Draco said dryly and instantly both boys turned a deep crimson.
"You saw it at the DADA class last Friday," Potter said as he licked his lips. Draco was tempted to do the same, to taste Potter on his lips again, even faintly, but held his tongue – literally.
"It's for your own good, Harry." Draco brushed Harry's bottom lip. It had been two weeks since the last time they'd kissed, and Draco believed that what he had just given to Harry had motivated the boy strongly, for instantly, his nose was buried into his Potions book. Tonight, though, as Draco looked over Harry's study, the dark-haired boy could only answer five questions. Draco patted Harry's shoulder and gave him a look of mock-sadness.
The Slytherin boy blinked twice.
"What?" Potter pouted at him. Pouted!
"I've just received a letter from my mother. My parents couldn't get me another wand."
When Draco turned back toward the exit way, he heard the sound again and this time it sounded clearer, closer.
"You know, Potter, I noticed that in my Hogwarts years you seemed to always know my whereabouts." Draco stepped one foot closer. They were one foot apart now.
"Well, Potter, suit yourself here as long as you want," Draco said understandingly.
Rumbling sounds from Potter's stomach erased Draco's anger.
Obliging, Draco devoured Potter's mouth and didn't stop until they'd lost their breath and when they stopped, Potter was beneath him. His hands were under Draco's pyjamas, touching his back. Draco looked down at the red plump lips and felt a sudden possessiveness. He dove onto Potter's neck and bit it before bombarding it with open-mouthed kisses. Hearing Potter writhing beneath him had made him lose control, and all his blood was rushing south.
"Wait a minute…" Draco narrowed his eyes at Potter. "So is this how you knew my whereabouts?"
"Potter?"
"How am I suppose to find it if it's covered in snow, Potter?" Draco crossed his arms.
"She only listens to Bill. Her obsession to you has reached an unhealthy level, mate. She should be stopped before it makes her crazy. Sorry about that, Harry." Weasel patted Potter again.
Draco panicked.
"Um, two called you Master Malfoy and, um, you have a free house-elf." Potter stuttered suddenly. "W-why did they call you Master Malfoy and not Master Draco?"
Potter's eyes widened and stared at Draco's hand clutching his right wrist.
“Lunch,” Harry announced. “Molly’s invited us both to lunch with her and Arthur tomorrow at the Burrow.”
“He shouldn’t be able to purchase a new wand,” Harry decided. Technically, that wouldn’t prevent Michael from nicking one from someone else, but it would hopefully hamper his efforts to use magic.
Harry went with it. “Yes, Daddy. I have an ache. You can look.”
“Yes, it does sound interesting. For

But Malfoy didn’t seem keen on that plan, if the rapid removal of cock from Harry’s hole was any indication. Harry let out an embarrassingly loud whine as his upper arms were grabbed and he was tugged upright, off the edge of the table and onto his unsteady feet.
“NOW!” Malfoy bellowed over the escalating sounds which prophesied imminent destruction.
Despite Luna’s innocent demeanour, she was as bad as Draco.

“Eleven and three-quarter inches. Nice and wide.”
This whole process had never been so much
When he reappeared at his destination, he shivered in the cold air. It was a pretty morning; the promise of sunshine beginning to permeate white, fluffy clouds. Harry strolled around the corner to the café that he was sure Hermione would already be waiting within. Probably impatiently tapping her watch.
“You conveyed that point to them very effectively. That file clerk seemed grateful that he didn’t disintegrate along with it. But they can’t do anything to

Potter’s eyes flicked up, shining with sudden mischief. “So, you’re saying that I should do whatever I want to?”
, with
Of course, Potter sighed. “Yes.”
Harry felt as though his muddled emotions had taken an unexpectedly sharp bend down an alternate route, but he didn’t question it as he sought out the warm wet of Malfoy’s mouth. Deepening the kiss further than before, feeling Malfoy respond in kind, Harry wasn’t in a hurry to go anywhere. Malfoy wrapped arms around him again, less in comfort this time and more in gradually increasing urgency as fingers grasped the back of Harry’s t-shirt and pulled him closer. Harry’s arms found their own way around Malfoy: his left hand slipping beneath the soft wool of Malfoy’s jumper, exploring skin as it smoothed up Malfoy’s back; his right seeking out the narrow gap between waistband and skin, sliding down to claim the curve of Malfoy’s arse as he became breathlessly aware of the meeting of two thickening cocks.
to know that Harry would find distasteful. Trying to
The blush tinting Draco’s face would’ve been answer enough, but Draco dipped his hand into the pocket and gently extracted a small ball of fluff. It was indeed bright pink with lime green spots.
Draco tugged Harry’s hands down, dropped a kiss to each palm and turned to rise from the bed. As he stood, he turned back to Harry and gestured impatiently. “Shift, I’m hungry. And Weasel might not feed me if I’m not dressed as requested. I’ve even taken the time to pristinely fold your clothes, so they’re ready and waiting for you. A perfect example of the benefits of efficiency.”
“Was it okay?” enquired Potter, furthering Draco’s suspicions. “It was average, but I’m sure we can work on it.”
“Work faster,” Malfoy growled, clearly better understanding how to achieve his desired results from a sleepy Harry. Malfoy always had been a quick learner.
When Ron nodded, Draco continued as he drew his wand. “They have fantastic… facilities which a man of such a
Harry hadn’t mentioned that incident to Draco yet. He decided to amend his oversight.
“Can you swallow a cock?”
“It is only prudent to glean advantages from any situation. People are not nearly as careful in conversation around paintings as they should be, therefore their carelessness does often provide invaluable information.”
A little bit of Harry despaired that he might never stop blaming himself. Harry couldn’t, because he still wasn’t convinced that it hadn’t been his fault, despite all the logical evidence to the contrary. The best Harry could do was keep repeating the facts to himself and attempt to listen to what those who cared for him were telling him. And he was

Harry breathed a muffled warning of imminent climax into Malfoy’s mouth and Malfoy increased his speed, silently demanding that Harry come. Not about to disagree on such an
Harry shifted his legs out from under him, muscles cramping from holding their position. Inevitably, he was spurred on by Draco’s growled impatience.
After a moment of awkward feet-shuffling, Potter spoke again. “Oh, right. Well… we don’t have to do that.”
She did turn briefly though to comment with the

And he doubted that he’d want it to.
Harry’s cock would

But the ground was trembling now. Almost lurching beneath Harry’s feet. As with many times before, Harry fought against the tide. Control his breathing and his magic will calm… he knew how to do that; Draco had taught him. Draco. Draco was in the shop; no more than twenty feet away. But Harry wasn’t going to scream out like a damsel in distress. Harry was more than capable of dealing with this
“Hmm,” Malfoy huffed as he prised Harry’s arse cheeks apart. “This is going to hurt.
“Yeah, I did read that. Was kind of hoping you hadn’t though. Well, how about doing your duties extraordinarily badly? Until they’re practically pushing you out the door. Incompetence is not regarded as harshly as negligence of duty within your contract.”
Harry still liked it; Malfoy had taken no action to remove it and Harry hadn’t prompted him to, the stretch was a steadying point of focus. But something in Malfoy’s quiet chuckle caused Harry to realise that Malfoy had deliberately caused him to lose control.
Although the idea of turning Lucius Malfoy’s portrait into a fireball had previously been entertaining, Harry wasn’t sure it’d be the kindest option for Draco.
. Malfoy knew how to land a blow. Not that Harry had been in any doubt of that; he’d experienced Malfoy’s physical strength many times, before and after the beginning of their relationship. Not quite like this though.
“Harry…”
that I did?”
Five: Draco’s arse ground into Harry’s groin as if he were trying to permanently weld them together.
“I want to take care of you,” said Harry in way of an explanation.
Missed it. Harry sighed again.
His mind still thrumming with questions, Harry pulled back before the urge to slide them both back together to the mattress had time to take hold. Harry suspected that the result of that action would be sleep this time though. Hopefully soon. But questions first
, Harry,” Molly clarified.
As a sponsored student, it was required that Draco reside in the same dormitory as his sponsor. The Ministry had decreed that it would enable the sponsors to carry out their duties with greater ease. But as far as Draco could tell, he was the only sponsored student in Hogwarts. Draco assumed that others had either declined the offer or their sponsors were more subtle than Potter. Lack of interaction with students in other Houses wasn’t conducive to gaining information. And Draco wasn’t going to ask. No, he was keeping his head down, aware that he was being carefully watched.

“Yes, Potter… I could be the Auror, and you could be the nefarious criminal. How do you feel about handcuffs?”
“No, thank you,” Harry ground out through clenched teeth. “But I’m very grateful for your concern,” he added, hoping to appease.
And that permission wasn’t always given, even afterwards.
A wistful expression had settled on Malfoy’s face, causing Harry to think that he might prefer some private time to linger in this room. “I’m just gonna go have a wander along the corridor,” Harry said. “I won’t go far.”

Lucius’ insults reached a new fever pitch of volume as Harry's hand stroked the wood, so, naturally, that was the moment when Draco walked into the room.
a good plan. Molly would be upset if Draco splattered blood all over her scrubbed table.
Harry took a moment to absorb that. Draco didn’t usually babble, but when he did, it betrayed insecurity. Harry hadn’t had a Draco before either, so he felt equally clueless about this small issue.
Draco’s shoulders sagged in relief. “Good. That’s good. Not the panicking thing, the other, the important

“So, don’t. Go back to sleep.”
“Yes, it is.”
“Didn’t you get much sleep last night? I’ve always thought that Wood might be a roaring tiger in bed.” Malfoy's voice sounded gleeful.
Yes, Draco should retreat to where other people were. It would be safer in public company, even if those people were Gryffindors.
Harry had previously noted that the object expanded into a round ball at the base, large enough to be held in a palm to serve as a handle, and he was certain that was what he could now feel separating his buttocks. Draco muttered a charm behind him, but Harry was too distracted by his bum full of glass to catch what it’d been.
“Draco, why didn’t you tell me before about these job offers?”
“You can apologise profusely after you’ve thrown something heavy at me. And until then, only when you’ve actually done something wrong.”
“Thank you so much,” Harry offered to the man seated above him, relishing in the squish of come in his tender arse and wondering when he had last felt so grateful.

. Draco recalled the look of sheer despair that he’d frequently seen on Potter’s face and his worry expanded to fear.
“Naturally.” Draco smiled. “I take both time and care with everything I do.”
His latest attempt at honesty had gone especially badly. Harry wasn’t sure why he’d thought it might be different. He’d frequently tried to shift positions of sex more in his favour, but men were either oblivious to his hints or obstinately ignoring them, Harry wasn’t sure which. They wanted to be under their Saviour, surrounded by his strength. Held in Harry’s care or moulded to his will. The few times that Harry had abandoned the concept of hinting and explained what he’d enjoy, the looks of sheer disappointment on his partners’ faces had soon prompted him to just fuck them and be done with it.
“Your face was tripping you. Like it does every night. And if you don’t want to be out here, then why did you come with me?”
Harry flipped the sign in the window to ‘closed’, locked the door, and wandered into the back room to see if Luna needed him to do anything else.
“They miss you, Harry. They all understand that you were extremely busy running the country but to be honest, I think they might’ve been hurt that you couldn’t find
“No,” Draco replied. “I’ll come back here before we go to the Burrow tomorrow, pick up the boxes and a couple of other things, then I won’t be… returning.”

Harry hadn’t registered that he’d begun to rock slightly against Malfoy’s inner thigh until he was berated by a low growl. “Be still.”
and true gratification came when Draco bucked his hips up to meet Harry’s next downwards motion.
him fall.
Standing behind the counter with his back to the entrance, Harry groaned quietly when the bell above the door jangled cheerily. Urgh. Although he loved his job, Harry was approaching his limit of amiable helpfulness today. Fixing a welcoming smile on his face, he turned in the direction of the noise, and the smile became a genuine grin as he recognised the man sauntering towards him.
Harry looked. Still just a pantry.
“You didn’t resort to mind control and sexual
Potter shook his head. “He did a lot of things.”
Sometimes Harry felt a bit thick when he spoke to Luna.
. As their relationship progressed, Harry often felt confident enough to be marginally brazen within his submission. But sometimes that worked out better than others.

that it was instincts born from the individual way Harry accessed his magic. And recently, Luna had been encouraging Draco to have the same misguided faith in him.

Absently fiddling with the hem of Draco’s jumper, Harry replied, “See that you do. I’m not the only one who could use lessons in communication.”

Getting out of the study seemed a wise first move, so Harry again reached out, relieved this time when Draco removed his right hand from his pocket and fingers interlaced with Harry’s.
it. But I still… am.”
Harry’s mind reeled. A part of him was aware that Malfoy was still talking to him, that the tone might’ve changed, that Malfoy’s hands were still touching him, maybe trying to encourage him to turn around… but he couldn’t concentrate on it anymore through the rushing noise in his ears. So, here it was. Finally bored with accommodating what Harry enjoyed, Malfoy was going to turn into all the rest of them. Into
The sarcasm didn’t dissuade Oliver. “I thought you’d like to come with me.”
An indeterminable time later, Harry heard Draco walk back into the kitchen and a series of clicks which indicated that the flames had been extinguished beneath the frying pan. A stasis charm followed, presumably cast upon the partially-cooked food.
Evenings in the common room had also become a duller experience. Potter no longer attempted to include Draco in conversations or activities, so Draco sat alone and undisturbed while he studied. It was exactly what Draco had wanted, but he hadn’t expected peace to be so boring. And the newfound solitude might’ve been easier to enjoy if he hadn’t noticed that Potter was also still not talking to anyone else.
“Yeah,” replied Harry as he walked from behind the counter. When he reached Draco, he pecked a kiss on soft lips before he headed for the door to flip the sign and lock up.
Returning to the lounge presented a debate of where to sit. He eyed up the couch, but that would be a bit near to Malfoy. Maybe the chair, although Harry didn’t usually prefer that. He could…
. Things happened to Harry, or they didn’t. But according to Draco, that was the wrong viewpoint.
Potter merely shrugged.
Pulling open the appropriate drawer within the cabinet, Harry shuffled to the side to make room for Luna.
The replying whisper from behind him was muffled by a yawn. “Yeah, I know.”
too smug, Harry’s mind was reeling too much to ponder why.
“What?” That wasn’t the type of pillow talk that Harry had been expecting. At the thought of the Minister for Magic being interested in either of them, Harry’s heart skipped what felt like several beats. Harry didn’t even bother to correct Draco’s deliberate mispronunciation of the Minister’s name. If this was important enough for Draco to bring up

, in one way or another. Friends, fuck-buddies or… other.” It was far too early to tell. “I don’t know. We’ll both need to wait and see what each of us wants. Maybe we’ll just want someone available to hurl therapeutic insults at.”
Potter’s bafflement was replaced with a smirk. “Want me to shut the window?”
Draco bit his lip, looking suddenly nervous himself.
Draco’s curiosity was evidently piqued now. Harry tried not to shy away from it.
“Then choose someone from your hoards of adoring fans,” snorted Draco.
here, so I imagine you’ll be back before long.”
Harry wasn’t always allowed to do that, so he replied, “Yes, I’m very grateful.”
. He’s stuck in that frame, remember? He doesn’t have a clue what’s happening out in the world anymore. He’s
Aware of how important the Floo call had been, Harry wondered whether he should ask if it’d been successful. That negotiation was intended to be the culmination of Draco’s hard work. He decided to wait until he and Draco were alone. It was astounding enough to Harry that Draco had accepted Ron’s presence in the Manor; he didn’t want to rock that boat by discussing possibly sensitive topics regarding the disposal of Draco’s heritage in front of him.
For some reason, love seemed to be a recurring theme of today. Harry hadn’t had a great experience of it. Maybe Draco deserved to understand Harry’s reluctance.
A shove to the centre of Harry’s back brought his chest flush with the wood and Harry’s feet were kicked apart.

for a second, but recovered quickly.
“No,” Harry exhaled, worried that he might’ve overstepped in his enthusiasm. “I’m not any of your concern.”

you, Draco. But shift,” Harry lifted a leg to nudge Draco with his foot. “I want some room to get naked.” In truth, Harry didn’t want to wait for Draco to undress him in case he had too much time to lose his nerve.
Harry’s resolve was wavering. “I… please…” he began to plead “I,

“Sit on the bloody couch.”
you?”
?” Draco asked, gently lifting one of Harry’s hands in each of his own.
As they both began to descend the stairs, Harry grinned as he listened to Ron’s shocked squeals and Draco’s stifled laughter.
Potter shrugged his lack of committal. “If you want. But I like it out here. Not so many people.” Potter glanced around them. “
“I’m fine, Draco. It takes more than that to break me,” replied Potter, beginning to re-install himself into the bed.
. It would be a sin to completely ignore that you have that in your sexual repertoire.”
hastily. Like now.
“I haven’t seen much evidence of that.”
Harry did his best, he really did, but he couldn’t completely prevent quiet noises from escaping his mouth when the sadistic git above him began to rock. Just tiny movements, an infinitesimal, graceful rolling of the hips as if Draco was riding him like the gentlest jockey. Draco wasn’t touching Harry’s groin, but he didn’t need to be, each motion was still designed to create friction, driving Harry’s arse into the bed.
"Oh. And what about the free elf?" Potter swallowed hard, and Draco had to notice. Hmm.
"No. Stop right now, Ginny. You're making a scene." Potter yanked his right hand and the girl stubbornly didn't let go. In the process of freeing his hand, Weaselette accidentally rolled the ring so that the emerald that was hidden below the hand was now exposed.
They appeared by a flower field before them. Behind them white sands shone like little diamonds illuminated by the sunrays. The landscape was stunning. But, to enjoy and appreciate the beauty of nature was not their purpose of coming there. It's the land before their eyes that was soon would be the center of scenery.
Harper raised his chin, forcing himself to look down at Draco from the tip of his nose. If this were any other situation, Draco would have laughed at how Harper tried to out-height him. A moment later Harper and his minions were gone.
With a whip of his hand, Potter closed the door.
No, wait. Why did Potter look so happy lately? Had he and the Weaselette settled their differences and got together? Now that disturbed Draco. He should go and find Peeves immediately.
"But-" Whatever the Weasel boy intended to say was cut by the voice of their Headmistress.
Draco sighed, and put his books and the novel book Potter had been reading back into the drawers. Potter wasn't properly lying on the bed; his back and head were half-propped against the headboard. That position would hurt his body in the morning, so deciding to do Potter the favor, Draco slipped his arms beneath the black-haired boy and moved him until he was properly laid on the bed. Then he took off Potter's spectacles and shoes. With a swing of his wand, the bedcover beneath Potter magically drew back and draped itself over Potter. After that, Draco readied himself for bed.
Draco saw Severus Snape's portrait eyeing him.
"Why is he still wearing your ring, Draco?" Lucius glared down at Potter when Draco returned and brought Potter to the entrance hall.
"Like this." Potter planted a chaste kiss on Draco's lips.
"Um, Draco?" Harry blushed, "Pull out?"
"Make it tonight, Harry."
"…Potter? Please tell me you're trying to make a joke? Surely you know that won't happen, Potter! The wand chooses its master. Even if I force it to submit to me, it will never work properly." Draco looked at the younger boy in disbelief.
"Potter, we'll bring them to the Ministry." Draco told Potter, and then ordered Tippy to bring him the aforementioned letter.
!" Nothing happened.
"Looking for this, Malfoy?" A seventh year boy stood in front of the class, holding his bag. Behind him were two others. Slytherins.
In times like that, when he saw the peacefulness on the boy's face, or when the boy smiled and laughed merrily, Draco would do anything to make sure that that happiness never left the boy. Until now, Draco still got shocked and confused whenever he'd feel that way toward Potter. Ever since he'd heard the Dark Lord's blabber about Potter when the man slipped into his mind, pity, turned into remorse and then anger, arose within Draco.
On unsteady legs, with eyes that were beginning to mist with tears, Harry raced back down the corridor, the head of the poor boy being bashed against Harry’s back. The adrenaline started building again, and extra, anxiety-fuelled strength filled Harry’s veins.
“shut the FUCK UP BLAISE” yelled Draco, kicking his friend. Blaise just laughed, and Harry replied “careful Blaise, you’ve been a bit lustful lately too. Don’t get cocky before your balls are served up with a side of bacon” that shut Blaise up somewhat, but Draco looked murderous at the thought that Blaise and Harry had been flirting. Enjoying having the upper hand, Harry shucked his t shirt off before bending down to pick up one of the shirts. He slipped it on, and took his time buttoning it up, hyper-aware of the three pairs of eyes on his muscled torso.
“Harry mate you’ve been spending too much time with Hermione”
Before he could even find a seat, a flapjack was shoved into his hand. Everyone was nattering and chattering around him, and he stood awkwardly on realising there were no seats left around their little table. Hermione, his saviour, noticed and scrambled into Harry’s lap whilst beckoning for Draco to take her chair. He smiled at her, before abruptly closing his mouth, worried that there were flapjack oats stuck in his teeth, and took the seat gratefully.
He heard a click somewhere ahead and then a torch was being shone in his face.
“Rugby training treating you well, Harry.” Cedric said, eyes smouldering as if he could see through the duvet and Harry’s underwear and sleep shorts to what was underneath. Harry resisted the urge to hide his crotch with his book. He felt rage rising up in him. How dare Cedric come in here and eyefuck Harry as if he hadn’t ruined their whole relationship with his condescension and snobbery. As if he hadn’t ended their relationship because he ‘wasn’t looking for anything too serious right now’ (a week before their six-month anniversary! That’s pretty fucking serious when you’re sixteen) and then immediately shacked up with Harry’s ex, Cho.
“no, you pillock. How did you make everyone love you? You were awful for seven years, then you fought in the wrong side of the war, and now you are everyone’s friend. Apart from mine, maybe, but still. Everyone fucking loves you, the pure-blood ex-death eater who terrorized us for years, and yet I’m the one who just made my best friend cry. I’m the one everyone is walking on eggshells around”
After Draco and I called it off, because the war was picking up, everything seemed to get better. Blaise grew up into an attractive man, which seemed to soothe his insecurities, and Draco was so distracted by being Voldemort’s pawn that Blaise replaced him as the king of Slytherin.
“Does Draco not like to share?” asked Blaise, pouting and sitting in the armchair, legs wide open looking like the picture of decadence and debauchery.
He had already lost count of how many sheep he had seen, and as they walked Remus explained a bit about the farm. He told Draco which animals they had and what they were for. The sheep were for wool and cheese, and a lot of the lambs they had just had would be sold for breeding.
“it’s nice to meet you too. I'm afraid I don’t know your surname Mr...?”
“Dray darling can’t you learn to share” she whined. Draco choked on his pasta and Harry heard Blaise laugh for the first time. It was a deep, rumbling sound, and soon Draco’s face matched the colour of the rioja he was drinking. Harry decided he could let out his Slytherin side and have a bit of fun. Blaise seemed to dislike him somewhat, but he sensed an ally in Pansy
“We’ll leave youse two to it, aye? Harry’ll get youse for lunch” Remus said, holding his elbow out for Sirius to hold on to as they walked back to the farmhouse. Draco and Pansy scarpered into the cottage and collapsed onto the sofa. Pansy immediately swung her legs over his and he was transported back to hours spent in her bedroom, the two of them tangled up on top of the covers of her bed, talking about nothing and everything; discussing which boys they found attractive, complaining about their parents, the like.
His hopes are dashed when Rugby boy 2 runs in. now that he is closer to Draco he looks even more like an Adonis. Dark skin, green eyes, curly hair and muscles all over the place. He is sporting a pair of glasses that hadn’t been there in assembly that morning, and he had forgone the Hogwarts school blazer for an irritatingly stylish Polo Ralph Lauren jumper.
“yea, and blonds” replied Harry, giving Teddy his finger to nibble on. Draco coughed, and Harry and Pansy shared a look before laughing. To Harry’s surprise, even Blaise smiled.
“careful mate, she’ll want her own soon” laughed Harry, seeing how excited Hermione was to spend time with Teddy.
Heaven and hell were words to me’
“Hello Draco” Hermione said to him, smiling warmly. she too had a carribbean accent, though less thick than her parents'. her voice was rhythmic and soothing.
Draco’s cheeks burned in embarrassment. His mother would be astounded to see him up at such an uncouth time.
He was standing in the cloisters, watching the cars pull in to pick up their sons for the holidays. Nearby were Harry and Ron, chatting animatedly.
